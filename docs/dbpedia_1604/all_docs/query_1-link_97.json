UIC 2018 FOREWORD High speed rail (HSR) encompasses a complex reality involving many technical aspects, such as infrastructure, rolling stock and operations, as well as strategic and cross-sector issues including human, financial, commercial and managerial factors. High speed has proven to be a very flexible and attractive system that can be developed under various circumstances andindifferentcontextsandcultures.Thisistheresultoffour mainandveryimportantcharacteristicsofferedtocustomers and society: safety, velocity, capacity and sustainability. As a result,HSRisarapidlyexpandingnewtransportmode,often described as the “transport mode of the future”. This brochure aims to communicate and disseminate high speed characteristics, performances, improvements, inno- vations and potential applications. This brochure is published regularly (approximately every two years) on the occasion of the World Congress on High SpeedbyUIC,withcontributionsfromitsnationalhighspeed members which are received with thanks.

Therailsprovidetheguidingsystem.Bycontrollingthedirec- tion of the train, they allow it to go very fast. However, this means that trains cannot overtake one another. Low grip refers to the contact of a steel wheel on a steel rail. As the train glides on the track, it is easy to carry very heavy loads with a low environmental footprint, but very difficult to brake and stop, or to accommodate steep gradients. Because of the huge investment required, rail can only be commercially attractive and financially acceptable asamasstransportsystem.Thisisjustaswell,asitistypically a heavy haul system. Classical rail THE LIMITS OF CLASSICAL RAIL Thespeedincreasesofconventionallinesislimited by several factors : The mix of traffic and particularly of speeds be- cause the bigger the difference between the fastest and the slowest trains the smaller de capacity of the line, The constraints due to the route and particularly the radius of the curves and the human density of the surroundings, The cost of the investiments for the upgrading, The necessity to adapt all the rolling stock fleets using the infrastructure, The difficulty to upgrade while operating HIGHSPEEDRAILPRINCIPLESANDDEFINICTION Classical rail networks are largely spread worldwide. They comply with various gauge standards, but the best perfor- mance is achieved using the 1.435 m track width. Most of these networks are made up of mixed-traffic tracks. Themaximumspeedneverexceeds200km/h(exceptionally 220 km/h). Built during the 19th century, many stations are now located in the centres of large cities where most urban transport lines converge, facilitating door-to-door trips. When compared to other transport modes, classical rail has proven to be very safe and environmentally efficient. Howe- ver, the aviation and automotive sectors have introduced many improvements and are still introducing innovations in their respective systems. This has had a strong negative impact on rail market shares for medium- and long-distance trips. Morethan50yearsago,Japan,followedbyFranceandmany other countries, decided to stop the decline of classical rail in this market segment by introducing brand new concepts for the rail mode rather than upgrading existing structures. This represented the birth of high speed rail.\n\n5. UIC 2018 400 km/h world records maximum commercial speed année 200 1940 1958 1976 1994 2018 0 400 km/h world records maximum commercial speed année 200 1940 1958 1976 1994 2018 0 High speed rail requirements Althoughincreasing the speedhasentailedmanytechnical and operational changes, HSR still fulfils the same quanti- tative and qualitative requirements as classical rail : Ability to accommodate various contexts and cultures Interoperability, Capacity, Reliability Safety and security Sustainability This evolution has also made it possible to benefit from many other innovations beyond those simply enabling higher speeds, as there is no point improving one aspect of a journey chain (travel time) if the other links in the chain remain weak. In addition, a thorough review of all the interfaces between the system components and of all the operating and main- tenance procedures is necessary, as time gained for the passenger by the increased speed can be cancelled out by an unacceptably high ticket price. The definition of high speed rail HSRisstillagrounded,guidedandlowgriptransportsystem : it could be considered to be a railway subsystem. The most important change comes from the speed. As travel times hadtobereducedforcommercialpurposes,speedemerged as the main factor. HSR means a jump in commercial speed and this is why UIC considers a commercial speed of 250 km/h to be the principal criterion for the definition of HSR. However, a secondary criterion is admitted on average dis- tanceswithoutaircompetition,whereitmaynotberelevant to run at 250 km/h, since a lower speed of 230 or 220 km/h oratleastabove200km/h(sinceunderthisspeedconventio- nal trains can do) is enough to catch as many market shares as a collective mode of transport can do. This also applies inverylongtunnelswhoseconstructioncostdependsonthe diameter linked to the square of the speed, at least. For such speeds above 200 km/h, the infrastructure can be categorized in “High-Speed” if the system in operations, complies with : track equipment, rolling stock (generalisation of trainsets), signalling systems (abandonment of trackside signals), operations (long-range control centres), the geographical or temporal separation of freight and passenger traffics, and more globaly with the standards for High Speed. This definition is coherent with the definition of High Speed Rail given by 96/48/EC European directive HIGHSPEEDRAILPRINCIPLESANDDEFINICTION Commercial speeds and speed records\n\n6. 6 HISTORYOFHIGHSPEEDRAIL 1830 19641903 1981 1988 1989 1992 1997 “Rocket” locomotive by George Stephenson reaches 50 km/h Siemens & AEG Electric railcar reaches 210 km/h 1 October, the SHINKANSEN, first HSR system, starts in Japan The TGV, the first European HS train, operates in France at 260 km/h Pendolinoin Italy and ICE in Germany The Atlantic TGVoperates at 300 km/h AVE in Spain HSR in Belgium H ISTORY OF H IGH SPEED R AI L 19th – 20th century : From the birth of the railway to HSR Because the rail mode is a guided and low grip transportation system, the history of the railway is an endless history of speed. S i n c e t h e o r i g i n s o f r a i l i n E u r o p e , d u r i n g t h e I n d u s t r i a l R e v o l u t i o n a t t h e b e g i n n i n g of the 19th century, the speed of passenger trains was of the essence for competition – not necessarily with other transport modes, but with other rail companies. It also provided concrete evidence of technological development in the most advanced countries at that time. If, in 1829, the 50 km/h reached by the impressive “Rocket” locomotive from George Stephenson was understandably regarded as high speed rail, it did not take long to achieve evenmoreimpressiveperformances:100km/hbefore1850, 130 km/h in 1854, and even 200 km/h at the beginning of the 20th century. However, these are just rail speed re- cords. The maximum speed in revenue operation was much more modest but nevertheless important. In the 1930s, the top and the average speeds between two cities using steam,electricordieselpowerwere180km/hand135km/h respectively. However, the emergence of other transport modes, such as aviation (faster) and private cars (point-to- point private travel at any time), prompted railways to take further steps to keep up with competition. 1964 : The birth of Shinkansen After some significant speed records in Europe (in Germany, Italy, UK and particularly in France – 331 km/h in 1955), the worldwassurprisedwhen,on1October1964,theJapanese National Railways began operation of a brand new, 515-km, standard gauge line (1 435 mm, unlike the conventional metre-gauge lines previously built in Japan) : the Tokaido Shinkansen,fromTokyoCentraltoShinOsaka.Thislineaimed to provide the transport system with a capacity commen- surate with the impressively rapid growth of the Japanese economy. JNR promoted the concept of not only a new line, butanewtransportsystem,whichwaslaterextendedtothe rest of the country and became the backbone of passenger transportforfuturegenerationsinJapan.TokaidoShinkansen was conceived to operate at 210 km/h (this was later in- creased), with a broad loading gauge, electric motor units powered at 25 kV AC,Automatic Train Control (ATC),Centra- lised Traffic Control (CTC) and other modern improvements. High speed rail was born.\n\n7. UIC 2018 HISTORYOFHIGHSPEEDRAIL 2003 2004 2007 2007 2008 2009 2018 HS1 in UK KTX in South-Korea 574.8 km/h New HSR record in France Taiwan HS Rail Corporation CHR in China HSR in the Netherlands and in Turkey HSR in Morocco and Saudi Arabia Encouraged by these French and Japanese success stories, several European countries began looking to establish anewgenerationofcompetitivelong-andmedium-distance passenger rail services, either by developing their own tech- nology or by importing it. Italy and Germany in 1988, Spain in 1992, Belgium in 1997, the United Kingdom in 2003 and theNetherlandsin2009joinedtheclubofcountriesoffering high speed rail services in Europe. In the meantime, some similar cases began appear in other countries and regions, such as China in 2003, South Korea in 2004, Taiwan in 2007 and Turkey in 2009. After the 120-km high speed line from Beijing to Tianjin was commissioned in August 2008, China changed scale and moved towards a much wider strategy by implementing more than 20 000 km of new high speed lines and acquiring more than 1 200 trainsets, eventually taking the global HSR lead. Following the example of China, many new high speed systems are now under development, under construction orjuststartingoperation(Morocco,Saudi Arabia,USA,etc.), demonstrating that HSR can operate worldwide regardless ofthegeography,thedemography,theclimate,theeconomic and political context, and the culture of the country. 1981 – 2018 : HSR services spreading throughout the world 1964 – 1981 : The advent ofTGV After the huge technical and commercial success of Shinkansen, several European countries, particularly France, Germany, and Italy, developed new technologies and innovations aimed at overcoming the decline of rail market shares. Despite an uncertain future (introduction of Concorde, political opposition, the first petrol crisis in 1973, etc.), SNCF, the French national railway com- pany, began operation of the first high speed line between Paris and Lyon on 27 September 1981, at a maximum speed of 260 km/h. The new European HSR rapidly proliferated and expanded its services, thanks to its interoperability with the existing rail network.\n\n8. 8 Dali Ürümqi © Input UIC members H IGH SPEED R AI L TODAY The high speed network The high speed network began its development in 1964 in Japan. Its extension, mainly driven by Japan, France, Spain, Italy and Germany, was slow until 2000. At this point an acceleration could be felt, but it was only in 2008 that, thanks to heavy investment by China, the scale of the whole network changed dimension. Today more than half of all high speed lines are in Asia. Some countries or regions, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Taiwan, have completely finished building the extent of their high speednetwork.Somecountriesarecontinuingdevelopmentbuthave alreadycarriedoutthebulkofit,suchasSpain,Italy,France,Germany and Japan. Some countries are still planning significant extensions, such as UK, South Korea and China. Some countries have just started developing and implementing HSR, such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco, USAandRussia.Finally,somecountriesplantoimplementhighspeed rail in the future, such as several Eastern European and Asian states. It is worth noting that not all high speed lines are run at the same speed. Several factors come into the explanation. Firstly, there is the distinctionbetweenthedesignspeedandtheoperationalspeed.The most recent lines are designed to run at 350 km/h (and even 400 km/h), i.e. the infrastructure and the superstructure can withstand this speed. However, the maximum commercial speed (operational speed) may be lower than the design speed because the rolling stock is not suitable for it. The operational speed is determined by the certification process during which evidence must be provided that the rolling stock can successfully run on the line at the targeted speed plus 10%. Secondly, some so-called high speed lines are designed for speeds lowerthan250km/h.Thiscanbeduethemixoftrafficorthenetwork consistency. If the infrastructure is to be run by freight and passen- ger trains or by long-distance and regional trains, the line capacity is increased by reducing the maximum speed. In addition, some lines are sometimes built predominantly to provide networks with consistency by, for example, linking different sections. In this case the maximum speed may be lower. The outcome of this is that the global high speed network is not homogeneous in terms of speed. HIGHSPEEDRAILTODAY Asia\n\n9.

So, the issue of the number of users is crucial. It is excellent if these users come from other transport modes, as high speed rail is environmentally friendlier than other modes, but a portion of the traffic will also come from an increase in mobility, i.e. people will consume fewer goods or save less money in order to travel more. This means that high speed rail has to be more attractive than the other transport modes for some segments of the market and has to create its own demand. As a high speed line is usually built to last at least a century, these two characteristics (be attractive and generate mobility) must be perennial. The commercial appeal In traffic terms, high speed rail has proven to be very successful, as passenger growth is faster than the network extension, when normally the opposite evo- lution would be expected, as once the best are built the latest ones will have a lower marginal appeal. The countervailing facts are grounded on two aspects, insufficiently highlighted : The latest huge network development is taking place in China which is the most populated country in the world; Elsewhere,asinChina,thenetworkeffectworkstoprovide customers with more travelling possibilities. China has taken the global lead in passenger traffic volumes. Thiscompletelyrefutesthelong-standingprejudiceaccording to which high speed rail is only for rich people. If China is factored out, a steady traffic growth between 2010 and 2018 demonstrates the appeal of high speed rail in every geographic, demographic, economic, political and cultural context; in other words, it is universally appealing. COMMERCIALAPPEALOFHIGHSPEEDRAIL HSR market shares in 2016 (PA S S E N G E R S.K I LOM E TE R)\n\n17.

This is particularly the case when high speed lines first open to revenue services, as air ope- rators try to react and resist. However, in the long term the market stabilises around the previous ratios because rail isalwayscheaperthanair,asdemonstratedbyrecentEuropean research carried out by UIC, even when considering low- cost air companies and tour operators who sell complete packages (including accommodation and visits, shows or fairs) better than trips. The competition between high speed rail and air trans- port has been tested in many places, all over the world and around the clock. The major outcome is that, regardless of the rail and air companies involved, modal shares are driven by the relationship between the respective door- to-door travel times. Furthermore, on most Origin-Destination (OD) pairs, the railandairmarketsharescanbeaccuratelypredictedusing just the high speed train travel time : Where rail travel time is less than 2h, HSR completely dominatesthemarketandaircompaniesoftengiveupcom- peting. A good example of this is the Paris-Brussels route; Where rail travel time is between 2h and 3h30 minutes, rail is the dominant mode; Where rail travel time is between 3h30 and 5h, air is the dominant mode; Where rail travel time is more than 5h, rail becomes a marginal actor compared to air. COMMERCIALAPPEALOFHIGHSPEEDRAIL Rail market share on the rail + air market in France (PA S S E N G E R S)\n\n18. 18 High speed rail versus buses Nowadays, competition from bus operators is widespread in all countries. In many cases, it existed before high speed rail services were commissioned. Bus travel is characteristically cheap and able to serve several stops within a city, consequently reducing access or egress times. Generally, when high speed services start operation, the bus offer changes and develops into a low-cost offer, based on economic competitiveness and better on-board services, e.g. free WiFi. This kind of competition can prove quite aggressive towards high speed rail and can give rise to a response in the form of a similar low-cost service. This is the case in France, where SNCF has created Ouigo, a special low-cost TGV service which offers very low-price tickets and also targets families by offering €5 tickets for children, whatever the destination.

Privacy is the primary asset, together with the ability to offer a full door-to-doortrip,thechoiceofthedeparturedateandhour (full availability), the choice of the route, the ease of hand- ling luggage, the absence of any constraints linked to ticket distribution and reservation, etc. In addition, car transport is rapidly evolving due to two nascent possibilities enabled by the collaborative eco- nomy : car-pooling and car-sharing. These two new uses of the car strike a balance between the fully private system, in which the driver is the owner, and public transport with its constraints (meeting places, contracts replacing ticketing and timetables, etc.). In the face of this ever-moving competition, high speed rail remains very efficient over long distances. Over shorter distances, HSR needs to be very inventive but has proven capable of this, with fares based on the phone system (unli- mited subscription) or on-demand trains. The market is pro- gressively moving toward a digital-oriented and multimodal market, particularly for the younger generation. Global market shares Modal shares COMMERCIALAPPEALOFHIGHSPEEDRAIL The respective market shares of rail, air and road depend on many parameters, such as geographic context, national regulations,etc.However,inmostEuropeancountrieswhere HSR is in operation, the car is still the main transport mode for short and medium distances and air is the most popular mode for very long distances. Rail and bus have many as- sets over medium distances. The following graph illustrates the situation in France, as an example of a relatively large European country. High speed rail retains some assets that distinguish it from other public transport modes, including : ground speed, access to city centres, freedom of passengers on-board trains (possibility of standing and walking during travel), passenger comfort.

Statistical adjustment has been performed so that the final data set is representative of the national population in each country in terms of gender, age, social grade, region of residence and car possession. One of the numerous outcomes of this survey is about the criteria driving the modal choice in three different European countries which look very similar. The following graph illustrates one aspect of the survey in which each respondent selects 5 criteria at the most among 14. In the case of UK for example, the “price” criterion is selected by 77% of the respondents, but the “luggage” criterionby4%ofthemonly.Thelessondrawnfromthispoll isthattime(“traveltime”+“wastedtime“+“reliability”and “accessibility” to a lesser extend + “timetable” as a marker of frequency) and price govern the modal choice.

ASinternalrailcompetitionisgoingtobeenforcedinEurope, incumbent operators and new comers will struggle to offer better on-board services for the upper market segments and lower costs for the lower market segments. In any case the norm will be to allow the client to be self-autonomous by providing him with electric plugs to fill up on energy his own devices. In first class the on-board catering will remain as distingui- shing feature. For customers privileging the price and for families low cost services is the best asset of rail against the ever-changing competition from all forms of car uses: private car, carpoo- ling, car sharing and autonomous car in the future. Ouigo in France, Izy by Thalys and Eva in Spain are pioneering this kind of low cost services. On behalf of UIC, surveys have been conducted and focus groups have been consulted in three European countries (France, Spain and UK) in order to identify the main parameters that drive the modal choice of travellers. This process encompassed : A sample of 2 000 respondents per country, representative of the national population; A focus group in each country.

SimilarcompetitionisalsobeingexperiencedinSouthKorea, between the incumbent company (KNR) and a new public company in which KNR holds shares. A particular feature ofthismarketisthateachcompetitorhastheirownterminal station in the Seoul area.

Of course, competition, whether internal (within the rail mode) or external (with other transport modes), relies heavily on the regulation and degree of freedom allowed. Things are rapidly evolving. In Asia, China and Japan do not allow internal competition and South Korea is only now opening the door. In Europe, the unbundling of infrastructure from operation is leading to competition on or for the market.

It has also led to unexpected new business models. Among these, new web actors are trying to carve out a place in the field of train ticket distribution. Through various channels, they take the opportunities provided by the marketing policies of incumbent rail companies or by their yield management systems. Some of these new players also act as trip comparison sites and provide customers with information on trip alternatives and the environmental footprint of trips.

Shift TheadvantagesofHSRintermsofen- ergy consumption and Green House Gas(GHG)emissions,comparedtoits competitors, are one of the main dri- versforreducingthecarbonfootprint ofthetransportsector.AUICstudyon HSR in France and China concluded that the carbon footprint of HSR can be up to 14 times less carbon inten- sivethancartravelandupto15times less than aviation travel, even when measured over the full life cycles of planning,constructionandoperation of the different transport modes. Asaresult,shiftingpassengerstohigh speedrailfromairandroadtransport reduces CO2 emissions. Expectations of a modal shift to rail regarding the corresponding CO2 reductions have been proven by experience across a very large number of corridors. InEurope,theTransportWhitePaper stipulatesthatmostmedium-distance passengertrafficshouldbecarriedby rail by 2050. Improve Since 1964, HSR has constantly introduced improvements and in- novations aimed at reducing high speed rail externalities: vibrations, noise, CO2 emissions, etc. Much has also been done to recycle infrastruc- ture and rolling stock components. Energyefficiencyisattheheartofthe problem. Numerous measures have been taken to : build lighter vehicles; streamline trains; increase on-board seat capacity; use more efficient engines; introduce energy regenerative systems; increase the share of renewable energies; improve all ancillary systems such as air conditioning or lighting; etc. Paradoxically, the energy consump- tion per passenger of high speed trains is usually lower than that of conventional trains running betweenthesamestations,according to several parameters such asamore homogeneous speed profile. Strategies for reducing the environmental footprint Three strategies can be implemented in this context: FASTTRACKTOSUSTAINABLEMOBILITY\n\n24. 24 Carbon balance of a high speed line High speed projects are usually appraised by means of two important balances : economic and environmental. The environmental balance spans the life cycle of the in- frastructure from the very first design to final recycling of its components, through the construction and operation periods. This means that the footprint includes the carbon emissions when : designing the line, because the engineers and draftsmen will need buildings and devices to shelter them and provide comfort and heating or air conditioning, fuel for going in the field or to meetings, etc.; constructing the line, the stations and the rolling stock, including the emissions for extracting and shaping materials (e.g. steel or cement), and for their transport (e.g. moving the earth or transporting the rails); operating trains and stations; maintaining the infrastructure and the rolling stock; distributing tickets; recycling the components of the infrastructure and the rolling stock.

In the case of a 300-km long HS line (such as the Oceane Line in France), the CO2emissions amount to 1.5 million tonnes. However, these emissions are offset during the revenue period because of the CO2 savings due to the traffic shift from road (50 000 tonnes per year) and air (80 000 tonnes peryear)torail.Thismeansthatthecarbonbalance,whichis heavilynegativeattheendoftheconstructionperiod,impro- ves year on year of operation. In the previous example, the carbonemissionbreak-even(carbonneutrality)willbeachie- ved in 2029, i.e. 12 years after the line was commissioned. Therefore, a high speed line project is only environmentally feasibleifthereisastrongcertaintythatthetrafficdiversion volumes will be significant. This is even more important where there are predictions of changes to the technology of all transport modes, such as cars, and even aeroplanes, powered by electricity.

UIC 2018 Protection of the environment during the design and construction phases Asecond studyevaluateswhen and in whatproportionsthe project contributes to the protection of the environment and in particular, the climate. As most of the CO2emissions relatingtoahighspeedlinearereleasedduringtheconstruc- tion of the infrastructure, new methods are now employed to reduce the corresponding carbon footprint of railway infrastructure. When different technical solutions can be envisaged for earthworks or engineering works (bridges and tunnels), the decision-making process now takes the volume of GHG emissions into consideration. One typical example of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is the laying of an asphalt concrete finishing layer. This innovative solution has already been used in the design and the construction of the railway platform. It consists of replacing the conventional solution of a foundation layer of “as dug” gravel (GNT) with a solution that includes a road base asphalt (GB). Not only is the environmental balance better than with the previous thick layer of materials, but durability is also improved. In addition, this asphalt layer makes it possible to reduce the thickness of the ballast be- neath the rail. This also applies to the environmental optimisation of the components of the rail platform and superstructure. Combining carbon offset and modal shift on the California high speed line A carbon-free project has been designed on the new high speed line in California. The project will intrinsically emit 170 000 CO2tonnes of GHG. However, these emissions will be offset by 520 000 tonnes due to a commitment to plant 4 600 trees and to grant $20 million for the replacement of old school buses. In addition, modal shift will help reduce the carbon footprint of the cor- ridor, as planes produce 57 times and cars 43 times more GHG pollution than high speed trains. The calculations of the California High-Speed Rail Authority show that whenallthecarboncorrectivemeasuresenvisagedsofarareconsidered, the high speed line will be globally carbon positive. FASTTRACKTOSUSTAINABLEMOBILITY\n\n26. 26 A good example of friendship between HSR and environment Renewable energy in high speed rail operation SomeHSRinfrastructureand servicesproduceand consume their own renewable energy. An innovative example is the Schoten Rail Tunnel in Belgium, primarily designed for the protection of wildlife in a forest area and to reduce noise from the rail and highway. Here, the infrastructure manager Infrabel has installed 16 000 solar panels on the roof of the railway tunnel of the high speed Antwerp-Amsterdam, line. This covers a total length of 3.4 km and an overall surface area of 50 000 m² (approximately 8 football pitches), has a totalinstalledpowerofnearly4MW,andgenerates3.3GWh of electricity each year. The energy is used to provide both power to fixed infrastruc- ture (e.g. railway stations, lighting, heating and signalling) and traction to trains. The electricity produced by the solar panels powers about 4 000 trains per year. This means that theequivalentofafullday’sworthofBelgianrailtrafficisable to run entirely on solar power generated by the equipment. HSR, as a 100% electrified system, is compatible with renewableenergywithouttheneedforfurthertechnological improvements. Nowadays, HSR is the only transport mode to consume significant proportions of renewable energy in the intercity and long-distance transport market. Decarbonised electricity mix is the main driver of reducing CO2 emissions: the higher the percentage of electricity from renewable sources used for traction, the lower the CO2emissions. One of the advantages of being electrically powered is that, unlike other transport modes, high speed undertakings can easily utilise the main forms of renewable energy (such as on-site renewable power plants) or can purchase Green Certificates through the procurement of Renewable Energy Certificates (GO or REC – market tools defined by European Directives to promote investment in green energy power plants). In this context, some rail companies have recently initiated “greenelectricity”procurementastheyaimtoincreasetheir share of renewable electricity. For example, in Scandinavia, Switzerland and Austria there are entire rail networks which run on electricity that is completely carbon free. Similarly, the Dutch railways have signed a contract to purchase all their energy requirements from newly built renewable en- ergy sources. FASTTRACKTOSUSTAINABLEMOBILITY\n\n27.

What do people do with this saved time? Surveys have shown that the time gained is generally spent in travelling more. Scrutiny at the sources of HSR traffic regularly shows that, for typical HS lines, new rail traffic is made up of three main parts: shifts from road, shiftsfromairandinducedtraffic.Inducedtrafficcorresponds to people who would not have travelled or would have tra- velled less frequently if the HS line had not been created. In other words, induced traffic comes from an increase in mobility. The two pie charts below show that the volume of new traffic depends on the travel time saved and illustrate therespectivesharesforroadandairdiversionsandinduced traffic. They also show that induced traffic is often the main source of new traffic. The increase in mobility means that people find it advan- tageous to travel more along the corridor served by the HS line. Why is there more travel along the corridor ? Several factors explain this behavioural change : access to a wider employment area, benefiting more often from a natural zone or a touristic zone, more frequent visits to family members and friends. These advantages may cause people to move into the cor- responding corridor. Similarly, companies may consider transferring some of their activities towards the corridor or establishing new production locations in the corridor to benefit from the employment basin. Regions and cities, as well as hotels and holiday resorts, may also try to attract tourists and clients by investing in the corridor, as the flows of people are greater. So,thelogical relationship between speed and territoryevo- lutionisaconsequenceofthemobilityincreasewhichisitself a consequence of the time saved by the speed. Much has been said on the subject of HSR and territory management, but the logic of their relationship is rarely explained. Failure to understand this relationship may lead to overestimating or underestimating the real effects of HSR on the served territory.

This is probably the main reason for the progressive extension of the HS network north and south, west and east, once a country has built its first successful HS line. The Japanese, Spanish and Chinese examples all support this theory. An anamorphous map shows how a territory changes when distances are replaced by travel times. If the global shape re- mains the same, as if through an homothetic transformation had been made, it means that every part of the country draws the same benefit from the new network. If some parts of the map shrink while others remain constant, it means that the network effects do not have the same impact on the various areas. Here, we can see that having built a grid of high speed lines China has preserved its relative geography whereas in France the West- Southern end of country is still missing high speed infrastructures. A very explicit representation of the territory shrinking due to faster travel is given by anamorphous maps. Such maps have been drawn for France for 1980, the year before the first HS line between Paris and Lyon was commissioned, and 2018, after 2 700 km of HS lines have been commissioned. They show that the physical geography of the country and its travelling geography do not coincide. The physical map is implicitly based on the assumption that the time spent to travelxkmfromanypointinanydirectionisalwaysthesame.

Consequently, it is not possible for most passengers to walk to these stations and their location must be optimised to take advantage of urban and regional complementarity and to enable conve- nient access for cars and buses. Stations may also be well connected to airports. In other words, the accessibility of stations is key. In view of this, most high speed stations are constructedincitycentresorconsistofoldstationsthathave beenrevampedandadaptedforhighspeedtraffic.Asaccess and egress times form part of the door-to-door trip, these need to be reduced to a minimum. Sometimes, in very large urban areas, it can be worth having more than one station.

They include access (from the origin of the trip to the main means of transport) and egress (from the arrival point of the main means of trans- port to the ultimate destination). These examples highlight the significance of access and egress for high speed rail and consequently the importance of the location of stations.

HIGHSPEEDSTATIONS The following graph show the intricacies of the relationships between theseactors. Thestation governanceplaysacrucial role in organising and managing the function of all these actors, including high speed rail operators who share the station with all the other actors and have to fulfil their own specific needs and constraints to successfully attract long-distance travellers.\n\n35. UIC 2018 High speed rail nodes Infrastructuremanagers,orstationmanagers,andcitieshave followedseveralstrategiesforthelocationsoflargestations. In most cases, there is one large through station in the city centre and all urban and regional transports means are spread around the station star-style, or they go from north to south or from west to east, serving the station in the middle of the line. In very large cities, there are sometimes several large dead- end stations that are very well served by the urban and re- gional network. In this situation, each station is oriented toward oneortwo pointsofthecompass. In such situations, although the city is equipped with two or more stations, customers are only interested in one of them at any time : the station which serves the destination chosen for each particular trip. For example, passengers wanting to go north will necessarily go to the Northern station because there are no high speed trains heading north from the Southern station. This example shows that having several stations in thecitydoesnotactuallyhelp with station accessas,from the traveller’s point of view, there is essentially only one station in the city. Two strategies have been developed to improve this situation of providing customers with just one access point to catch a high speed train heading towards a given destination.

Consequently, high speed stations are expected to handle high traffic flows. “Flow” must be understood to cover trains of all categories, customers, private cars, taxis and local public transport modes. In addition, stations and their nearby surroundings provide the location for railway operatorstocarryouttechnicaloperations,suchasreplacing crews,cleaningand inspectingtrains,waterrefilling,turning around seats, refurbishing catering, etc. Furthermore, com- mercialoperationinstationsrequiresspaceinthestationfor information, ticketing, vending, and in some cases, access control, post-travel services, etc. Strategic value of stations The station is the place where passenger flows, commercial activity and industrial operation are simultaneously dealt with,whilepreservingthefundamentalvaluesoftherailway (environment, energy, safety, security, civil protection, etc.) As high speed stations are generally located in city centres where land is scarce and expensive, planning what, where, why and who is to perform these operations is an essen- tial input for the functional design, productivity and asset management of high speed rail. Where possible, moving commercialorindustrialrailactivitiesoutofmajorterminals and city centres into places where land is less expensive may prove a good economic and land use policy, as well as optimising the quality of operation and service. UIC has benchmarked 32 major stations in various coun- tries around the world, comprising a mixture of through and dead-end stations, of new and old ones, and of those fully dedicated to high speed and those shared by many different kinds of traffic.

Most often the access to the metro network is within the station and all facilities are provided (escalators, for example) to make the transfer between high speed trains and metros as easy and as fast as possible, particularly for people carrying or wheeling luggage, with children, etc. The same principles apply for taxi ranks and car rentals. For the former, the unloading zone and the loading zone are usually distinct, in order to ensure greater proximity to the station’s high speed arrival and departure platforms. For the latter, car parks can even be located within the sta- tion, as in Beijing South station, which is optimally linked to the road network. In some stations, car-pooling meeting points are now being created as this transport mode plays a similar role to taxis and car rental agencies. It is worth noting that in many large stations great care is taken to encourage soft mobility, particularly bicycles. Parking areas dedicated to bicycles are strategically and conveniently placed. Rail-air complementary is also very much sought after because large stations and airports fulfil the same hub function. Superposing two such hubs is beneficial for both transport modes. Sometimes air companies will even “fly” trains instead of aeroplanes when a high speed line is linked to the airport. Frankfurt is a crowning example of this kind of modal complementarity. Modal coordination HIGHSPEEDSTATIONS\n\n39. UIC 2018 High speed stations can be used to promote a high level of architecture. Very new high speed stations are architectural marvels. There was a period when nobody could see a future for rail travel, because people wanted to own their own cars or travel much faster by aeroplane. This trend was typical of the WW2 post-war period and railway stations consequently became far less important for people. Now, however, while airports are still totemic places for large urban areas, the car hastosomeextentlostitsappeal,aspeoplearemoreconscious of the environmental damage it causes. At the same time, rail travel has evolved to produce high speed trains, and stations are becoming legitimately more spectacular. One of the great disadvantages of having a railway station in a city is that the tracks divide the city into two separate parts that can be difficult to adequately link. High speed rail often provides the ideal occasion to overcome this separation by creating an underpass or overpass, thus eliminating the isolation of some districts. Such urban operations are rarely limited to this “joining” function. In most cases, the modifi- cation of the station becomes the stimulus for a deep real estate and renovation development plan. New housing areas, offices, retail shops and public conveniences emerge around the restructured and revamped station, largely beyond the station perimeter. Architecture and urbanism HIGHSPEEDSTATIONS\n\n40. 40 Station and services Stations are not only for passengers. They also play host to plenty of other people, who pop in to buy something, or meet someone, or use one of the many services. In other words, they are public spaces that require excellent signage to en- sure that everyone can achieve their goal with ease. People are increasingly using the GPS on their smartphones to direct themselves in the streets and in public buildings, and stations naturally need to provide WiFi to help people access guidance apps, information and the Internet. High speed services need to take advantage of the WiFi and facilitiesprovidedbyagoodstation,becauseaccesstotheweb is no longer seen as an extra but as a given. Customers are at a losswhentheyaredeprivedofaccesstothevirtualworld.They consider the station to be an extension of their home in terms of virtual navigation and even when boarding a high speed train, they resent any disruption to the connection with their serviceprovider. Formodern customers,trains areno different to the street, their home or their office – but on the move. So, stations have to be connected and ensure connectivity. Incidentally, this connectivity is increasingly useful for disabled people as it enables ac cess to all the apps that can assist them. Similarly, trains and stations must provide customers with sockets so they can plug in their devices. More broadly speaking, the entire railway system should aim to offer customers autonomy. As you are never better served than by yourself, the best service the railway system can offer is to help customers be autonomous. HIGHSPEEDSTATIONS\n\n41. UIC 2018 I N FR ASTRUCTU RE The six key stages for implementing a high speed line 1 - The emerging phase, during which existing and potential traffic is ascertained, determines the main project charac- teristics and functionalities to achieve the performances to beused asassumptionsforthetransportation development master plan and the travel demand estimation. A pre-feasi- bility study is carried out, including traffic forecasts, with an overall consideration of the socio-economic characteristics, the status quo of the transport network, current supply and demandofalltransportmodes,etc.Thepreferredcorridoris determined through technical and economic comparisons, and initial cost estimates are made. 2 - During the feasibility phase, detailed research on the project plan is conducted considering the emerging phase. This phase is divided into six sub-stages: feasibility studies, environmentalassessment,financialandeconomicanalysis, multi-criteria analysis, preliminary design, and empower- ment. Its target is to provide robust support for the decision process. INFRASTRUCTURE 3 - The design phase builds on the feasibility phase and supports the construction phase. It is divided into two parts: operation and maintenance planning, and detailed design. 4-Theconstruction phaseturnstheHSRprojectintoreality. This phase is divided into three steps: construction plan- ning,construction,andtestingandcommissioning(including authorisation). 5 - The operation phase refers to the period during which lines open up to traffic and begin passenger transport after the completion of acceptance tests and upon the receipt of operation certificate. Operation and maintenance are the main priorities during this phase. 6 - The project ex-post evaluation is generally carried out during the first operating decade.\n\n42. 42 Most of the superstructure equipment is stocked at base stations and hauled to the platform by train once the track is laid.These construction bases need to be strategically located to reduce the travel time of the various trains responsible for the work along the line. Such work bases are frequently retained after the line is commissioned and serve as maintenance bases. Most high speed lines are built within five to six years of taking possession of the required land, so long as tunnels and viaducts are not numerousor long. Before construction beings, several administrative proce- dures are compulsory, though these vary from one country to another. However, there are key stages that cannot be avoided whatever the context : Public enquiry aiming at checking that there is an ap- propriate balance between the public interest and private interests. Environmental assessment stating the environmental situation before the project and providing the list of envi- ronmental measures to be performed. Administrative enquiry focusing on the compatibility of the project with other public projects. Institutional and financial scheme to determine who will be the project owner and how the project will be financed, followed by a financial closing. Introduction of the project in official documents and procedures such as treaties (or, if the project crosses a bor- der, National Act) permitting and setting the conditions for the works.

UIC 2018 Typical geometric characteristics for high speed lines One of the most important innovation brought into the rail system by high speed rail are switches that allow trains to deviate from their current direction at 220 km/h (previously 160 km/h), thanks to movable crossing noses. Dedicated versus mixed-traffic high speed lines Oneofthemajorstrategicchoicestomakewhenimplemen- ting a high speed line project is whether the infrastructure will be dedicated solely to long-distance passenger traffic or open to passenger and freight traffic (mixed traffic). In the first case, the power of the trainset allows for steep gradients of up to 4%, as on the Köln HS line. In the second case, the geometric characteristics of the line are driven by freight train capabilities and the permitted gradients are much lower, entailing more or longer tunnels and viaducts, i.e. the infrastructure will be more expensive.

Ballasted track has largely improved its efficiency, in particular by improving the selection of ballast quality and the method of laying it along the track. At the same time, ballastless solutions have appeared whereby the track is laid directly onto concrete slabs. Both solutions are now commonly used worldwide as they each provide the same level of performance for operation.

UIC 2018 Monitoring and maintenance of fixed installations Thesafetyofoperationlargelydependsonthemaintenance of the fixed installations and particularly of the track and the electrification system. With this in mind, special trains, able to record the current parameters of the track and the catenary while running on high speed lines, have been de- signed, built and are in operation. As capacity is key, these comprehensive inspection trains are sometimes able to do their measuring and recording at the same speed as com- mercialtrains.WiththeIRIStrainsetabletorunat320km/h, Francehaspioneeredthisprocessandisnowbeingfollowed by other countries, especially China (CIT 400A). Essentially, these trainsets, based on the original commercial designs, are equipped with special devices to monitor the condition of the track, the wheel-rail force, the catenary, the panto- graph,thecommunicationsystemandthesignallingsystem. They may also have cabins for staff who remain on board for several days or weeks. These trains are also sometimes used for speed tests. All the recorded measurements are transmitted to the corresponding departments and teams to help with planning maintenance works. INFRASTRUCTURE Astrackintunnels(andotherengineeringworks)isoftenlaid on concrete slab, the transition between ballasted and slab track segments must be smoothed out. Such transitions are usually achieved by building a block to provide a gradient of groundelasticityateachborderbetweentheballastandthe concrete slab. If the line encompasses a very large number of such borders, it is better to select the slab track method. UIC 2018\n\n46. 46 Typology of high speed trainsets Articulated or non-articulated trains On articulated trains, most of the bogies are between the carriages, whereas on non-articulated trains each carriage has two bogies. Trains with bogies or isolated wheels Some trains are articulated with independent wheels which are not linked by an axle and therefore do not run at the same speed in curves. Concentrated or distributed power Concentrated power means that all the motors are located at each end of the train, whereas with distributed power, motors are spread all along the train. Tilting or non-tilting A tilting train is equipped with a mechanism enabling in- creased speed through curves by counteracting the dis- comfort due to centrifugal forces. Through a left-hand curve, the train tilts to the left to compensate for the force pushing to the right, and vice versa. The train may either be constructed so that inertial forces cause the tilting (passive tilt)oritmayhaveacomputer-controlledpowermechanism (active tilt). Single or multiple gauges A multi-gauge train can change the width between the wheels on each axle. Single or double decker Double-decker trains provide approximately 50% more sea- ting capacity than a single-decker train.

Today, Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) are compulsory in Europe for both infrastructure and rolling stock. Elsewhere, norms also apply. For historical and un- derstandable reasons, these sets of norms differ from one region to another in the world but they are beginning to converge as the international industrial rail market becomes more and more competitive.

A good example is provided by NTV (Italy), who have entrusted the maintenance of the AGV trainset to Alstom, the manufacturer 2 – Maintenance is ensured by the railway undertaking. This is the most common model in both Asia and Europe. 3– Maintenance is carried out in workshops bringing together the manufacturer and the train operator. This model has been experienced by RENFE in Spain, who have bought rolling stock from various manufacturers. Whatever the selected model, maintenance is generally organized as a 4 to 5-level process. These levels of maintenance are planned to fit with both the commercial schedule of the train and the life cycle of the rolling stock. The life cycle varies from 20 to 40 years ac cording to the operators. Some operators wih to replace the trainsets after 20 year to fit better with the technological progress and the customers’s uses or requests. Other operators try to make the most with their investment but ac cepting a quite expensive overhaul and adaptation after 20 year’s operations. Level 1 (Daily inspection) : Replenishing and repla- cing consumables such as oil and externally inspecting the state of pantographs, brakes and other parts and their performances. This will be done within 48 hours. Level 2 (Monthly inspection) : Conduction in-situ inspection of pantographs, brakes and electric equip- ment, their workings and functions. This will be done within 30 days or 30,000 km. Level 3 (Bogie overhaul) : Inspecting major parts such as motors, gears, wheels and brakes. This will be done within 18 months or 600,000 km. Level 4 (General overhaul) : Train cars are me- ticulously inspected by disassembling each of their parts and reassembling them to conditions identical to brand-new cars. This is completed in 36 months or 1,200,000 km. ROLLINGSTOCK In Japan, for example, JR East, one of a high-speed railway companies operating about 1500 km of lines and 1350 cars for “Shinkansen”.

While building their high speed networks, rail ope- rators have had to acquire appropriate rolling stock fleets. More specifically, the infrastructure and the rolling stock have been designed to complement one another in order to optimise their interfaces. Two options have been considered in this pers- pective: either to create and manufacture the rol- ling stock or to buy it from abroad. Japan, France, Germany and Italy chose the first option because they already had a manufacturing company able to design and build the required trainsets. Spain, Turkey, South Korea and China started by importing trainsets from abroad before setting up the industrial tools and factories to engineer and construct their own rolling stock.

From the point of view of ope- rators,goingfasterandfastermeansbeingmorecompetitive and sometimes more productive. Thisprocessofeverincreasingspeedeventuallyleads,ineach transport mode, to a stabilisation at a permanent or long- term maximum speed level – at least until a trend-breaking technological leap forward occurs. The level around which the speed stabilises for all operators is the optimum speed for each transport mode. For several reasons, all long-distance passenger transport modes have maximum operating speeds stabilised over yearsthatcorrespondtotheoptimumspeedofeachsystem (120 km/h for roads and around 900 km/h for aviation). However, railway proves the exception as the maximum operating speed is continuing to increase as technological improvements arise. Optimum speed Physical operation facts and figures Operating at 300 km/h: 1 km is run in 12 s and 5 km in 1 min Headway: 5 minutes between 2 trains running at 300 km/h means the distance separating them is 25 km. This distance is reduced to 4 km with a 4-minute headway. Distance to accelerate from 0 to 300 km/h : between 10 and 20 km OPER ATIONS OPERATIONS The maximum operating speed for high speed rail has in- creased steadily since the 1960s and continues to increase today. While the “the optimum speed of the system” has not yet been reached, some limits have been imposed by physicalphenomena,technologicalbarriersorsocialcriteria. Expert opinion and analysis of the various phenomena sur- rounding train operation at increasing speeds indicate that the main factors limiting speed increases relate to aerody- namics, the associated noise component, and the electric contact with the catenary. Factors relating to line geometry requirements, rolling stock restrictions,thegrowingneedforacousticattenuationmea- sures and aerodynamic phenomena, point to the optimum speed in the high speed system as ultimately being in the 500-550 km/h range. This optimum speed is close to the record speeds achieved to date by the two main railway technologies – wheel-rail running and magnetic levitation – which have reached 570 km/h and 603 km/h respectively.

UIC 2018 H I G H-S P E E D D E D I CATE D L I N E H I G H-S P E E D M I X E D TR A F F I C L I N E K EYS Capacity optimisation of high speed lines As it is very expensive to build high speed lines, the optimi- sation of their use is of the utmost importance. The capacity of the infrastructure depends heavily on the signalling and traffic management system and the corresponding distance or time between two consecutive trains (headway). At very high speeds (greater than 250 km/h), a headway of about 4 minutes is a good approximation of the highest capacity performances. This is equivalent to a maximum of 15/16 trains per hour and per direction on a 2-track line. However, this level of capacity cannot be maintained for long periods because it would make it impossible to recover from any incident. As a result, the practical average capacity is fewer than 15 trains per hour and direction. The heaviest traffic density on high speed lines in the world is found between Tokyo and Osaka (Japan) and between Paris and Lyon (France). The maximum flow of trains is obtained when all trains operate under the same conditions, at the same speed and with the same stopping pattern. When this homogeneity is not fulfilled, operators are forced to compromise between speed and the stability of operation (i.e. facility to recover the transport plan after an incident) and between the num- ber of trains and the diversity of their speeds. Operational studies and research have shown that the perimeter of the quadranglepointingtowardthesefourindicatorsisconstant, OPERATIONS Stability of the time table Maximum speed Number of trains Types of trains L1 L2 L3 L4 L’1 L’2 L’3 L’4 22 meaning that pushing in one direction (higher speeds for example) will affect the other three dimensions. As the maximum speed when a train deviates at a turnout is 220 km/h, any bifurcation on a high speed line causes deceleration of the train. Similarly, any intermediate stop of a train along a high speed line reduces the line capacity because the stopping train needs to decelerate to deviate towards the station platform and, after the stop, to acce- lerate to reach normal cruising speed. In both cases (bifur- cation and intermediate stop), the line capacity is reduced. This is the reason why there are fewer stations along a high speed line than along a conventional line. Optimization of HSR operations (L1+L2+L3+L4=K)\n\n54. 54 Mixed-traffic high speed lines The reasons above explain why most mixed-traffic high speed lines do not ultimately mix the different categories of traffic, even if they have been designed for this purpo- se. More often, passenger traffic runs during the day and freight traffic runs at night, thus operating the traffic types separately. UIC is benchmarking such mixed-traffic lines after having identified them : France: Tours bypass + Nîmes Montpellier bypass +Montpellier Germany: Hanover-Würzburg + Frankfurt-Mannheim Italy: Direttissima Roma-Firenze Portugal: Lisbon-Porto Spain: Bask Y + Mediterranean Corridor The Netherlands: Betuwe line UK: HS1 USA: North-East corridor France/Italy: Lyon-Turin France/Spain: Perpignan-Figueras France/UK: Eurotunnel Switzerland: Gotthard tunnel Just to give some examples, on HS1, between the Channel Tunnel and London in the UK, no freight trains run during daytime. In Germany, on the Hanover-Würzburg line, the situation is similar. The situation of the North-East corridor in the USA is quite different. Part of the infrastructure belongs to freight ope- rators who consider that passenger traffic, even carried by Acelatrains,cannothog“primetime”slotsandconsequent- ly, on some sections of track, this is less frequent than other passenger and freight traffic. It is worth noting that the first Shinkansen high speed line, operated in 1964, between Tokyo and Osaka, was planned long ago at a time when there were only conventional mixed-traffic lines. The main idea supporting the project was to build standard gauge infrastructure despite the fact that the existing network was narrow gauge. Standard gauge (width between rails of 1.435 m) was used to allow for mixed traffic, with freight trains carrying transversally loadedcontainers.Thisisthereasonwhythewidthbetween the tracks is broader than in Europe. It was only afterwards that, in view of the volume of passengers, it was decided to dedicate the line to Shinkansen high speed passenger trains. So the first stretch of the Shinkansen network was a mixed-traffic line, used as a passenger-dedicated line.

UIC 2018 Signallingandmanagementsystems As a guided system, rail is well-suited for speed since the di- rectionofthevehicleiscontrolledbytherails.Thedownside ofthisisthattrainscannotavoidobstaclesbyswervingright of left, like a car, or by changing altitude, like an airplane. Therefore, the track in front of the train must be totally clear of any obstacle. The specific role of the signalling and management systems is to prevent collisions and/or acci- dents between trains or between a train and an obstacle. In principle, a train can proceed only when the track ahead is free of other trains/vehicles/obstacles over a distance equal to or longer than its braking distance. On conventional lines, this role is currently undertaken by signallingpostsspread alongthesideofthetrack. However, thissolutiondoesnotsuithighspeedoperationbecausedri- verswouldnotbeabletoseethesignalsinduetimebecause of the speed. Instead, all the required information, once deliveredbylightsignals,mustbetransmittedtothedriver’s cab by on-board command and signalling equipment.

In order to help them, a UIC handbook describes the various phases and procedures to fulfil before beginning operation. Furthermore, the optimisation of a whole line or even a whole network needs a control-command centre to supervise the traffic in real time. The mission of control- command centres is broad : Operational timetable Real-time calculation of difference between scheduled/ actual times Display as distance/time graph or station survey Automatic intrusion detection Computer-aided conflict resolution with dynamic train running time calculations Preventative measures Power supply control Passenger information Station equipment control Video security OPERATIONS\n\n57. UIC 2018 Operation under extreme natural conditions A catalogue of difficult natural conditions has been establi- shed by UIC to identify the risks for train operation, bearing in mind that the higher the speed, the greater the potential damage.The following items correspond to the circums- tanceswhentrainoperationsmayrequirespecialattention: High temperatures Low temperatures, frost Snow Change of humidity, high humidity Strong crosswind Sand, dust Heavy rain Flood, tsunami Fallen rocks Seismic events Surrounding fires Fallen leaves So far, strong crosswinds, floods and seismic events have been investigated through the exchange of best practices, and the other items are planned to be analysed over the next few years. For each risk, the work programme consists of defining the risk by means of a measurable physical threshold, under or above which the risk is considered to occur. Then the various practices are compared to recommend actions and measuresatthedesign,constructionandoperationphases.

OPERATIONS\n\n58. 58 ECONOMICS OF H IGH SPEED R AI L On a market, whatever its nature, economic sustainability is based on both the average production costs and the marginal cost. The average production costs should decrease as the producer invests to increase his productivity. The marginal cost is essential, as on a market the price is driven by the marginal cost of the last producer. For HSR, the passenger transport market also encompasses air carriers and the various types of car actors (private cars, car-pooling and car-sharing). The technology of both these transport modes is in a phase of rapid innovation, and new business models are emerging which have a significant effect on the average production costs and the marginal cost. So, in order to keep up with competition, HSR must work on both economic aspects. High speed rail productivity Rail is well known as an economic tool with a growing return.Inotherwords,therailwaysystemhasmanyfixed costs and a low marginal cost. High speed rail has inhe- ritedthiseconomicfeatureanditsproductivityisdriven by three main parameters : the intensity of the infrastructure use, the distance run by a trainset in each time period, train capacity and the average load factor. Thisiswhybuildingahighspeedlineonlymakeseconomic senseoncorridorssupportedbyahealthymarketinorder to justify the investment costs, high frequency services requiring the intensive use of rolling stock and a good reservationsystembackedbyefficientyieldmanagement to optimise the load factor. High speed rail marginal cost The marginal cost for high speed systems is mainly composed of: maintenance of the track and the electric distribution system, maintenance of the rolling stock, train running, energy consumption, on-boardservicesandon-boardticketinspection(ifany). With the liberalisation of infrastructure and operation, the marginal cost of operators now encompasses track access charges. Therefore, the track access charges policy is vital when it comes to the appeal HSR appeal, which is why a special page in this brochure has been dedicated to it. At this stage, it is essential to remember the economic prin- ciple, according to which competition is fair only if the track access charges of each transport mode are adjusted for the social marginal cost.
