        "text": "üåç We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new cross-border multimodal transportation service via the high-speed rail network between China and Laos. This innovative service combines rail and road transportation, utilizing the China-Laos Railway, to provide efficient and sustainable logistics solutions. The launch of this service is not only effective as a BCP measure in the event of disruption in marine transportation and truck transportation, but is also positioned as one of the green solutions that can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions through the use of rail transportation. We aim to expand our multimodal transportation services that efficiently connect major cities in China, where transportation demand is expected to grow further in the future, and ASEAN countries, mainly in the Mekong region such as Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, by rail and truck. China Laos Railway is an international high-speed railway connecting Kunming, China and Vientiane, Laos, and opened in December 2021. Until now, trucks have been the mainstream transportation between China and neighboring ASEAN countries such as Laos, but congestion often occurs at the borders of China and neighboring countries such as Laos and Vietnam, and shortening lead times and further reducing costs have been issues. With China and Laos connected by rail, we can expect to realize mass transportation with stable lead times."
