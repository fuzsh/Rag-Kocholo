        "text": "XJ Electric Corporation Invited to Deliver a Keynote Report at the 20th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission\n\nFrom July 12 to 15, the 20th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission (ACDC 2024) was held in Shanghai. Sponsored by IET (Institution of Engineering and Technology), Tsinghua University, Huairou Laboratory and China Electrical Equipment Group Co., Ltd. and organized by XJ Electric Corporation and other organizations, this conference is a grand event to discuss the innovative development of energy and power, as well as a grand event for experts and friends from all walks of life to seek common cooperation, share development and create the future together. The conference focused on the discussion of topics such as basic components, key core equipment and major AC/DC transmission projects for building a new power system. It contributed intelligent solutions to the innovative development of AC/DC transmission technology, built a bridge linking technical exchanges and cooperation for scholars from all walks of life, and effectively promoted international innovation cooperation in the transmission technology field.\n\nview all\n\nThe voltage control device provided by XJGroup for the China-Laos Railway\n\n16:44, December 3, 2021 Leaders of China and Laos issued a departure order China-Laos railway opens to traffic North from Kunming, China South to Vientiane, Laos The China-Laos Railway is 1035 kilometers long Composed of Kunyu section, Yumo section and Mowan section It is an important part of the central line of the Trans-Asian Railway It is also after the “Belt and Road” initiative was put forward The first investment, construction and operation with the Chinese side as the mainstay The whole line adopts Chinese technical standards and uses Chinese equipment International railway projects directly connected to China's railway network The first electrified railway in Laos It is of great significance for promoting the economic and social development of Laos Complete the supply task ahead of schedule At the request of the customer, the material matching time of the first traction substation was shortened from the normal 45 days to 25 days. The time was tight and the task was heavy. In order to ensure the successful implementation of the project and the performance of the contract on schedule, the first traction substation was successfully supplied in only 21 days. Effectively protect the safe operation of trains The China-Laos Railway adopts the \"AC-DC-AC\" power supply system scheme, and obtains a stable power supply voltage of 10 kV through AC-DC conversion. It provides a strong guarantee for the safe and reliable operation of the system. In response to the large voltage fluctuation of the power grid in Laos and the unstable railway traction voltage, XJ Group successfully developed a voltage control device, which can quickly switch to the backup power supply when the voltage fluctuation is large, effectively protecting the safe and stable operation of primary equipment and trains. Day and night to complete field service commissioning XJ Group actively overcome the dual pressure of the COVID-19 Outbreak epidemics and the tight construction period, and has dispatched 19 domestic and foreign Service personnel, with a total of 1,520 persons/day going to the site for equipment installation and debugging. Due to the need for vehicle operation tests during the day, equipment debugging can only be carried out from 19:00 to 4:00 in the morning, and the project personnel must work day and night. Complete all product delivery tasks with high quality In order to facilitate the follow-up technicians to maintain the system, XJ Group completed the check of 900,000 entries, the dynamic and static tests of the protection measurement and control device and the monitoring system within a week, and realized the whole system of the Chinese and English versions of the traction integrated automation system and the power distribution integrated automation system. Realize unattended traction substation In the domestic section of the China-Laos Railway, XJ Group innovatively adopts the data sharing technology based on the protection measurement and control device of the bay layer, which effectively simplifies the fault location and wiring method, and comprehensively improves the fault location accuracy and operation and maintenance efficiency. In the domestic substation auxiliary monitoring system, new technologies and new applications such as guide rail robot inspection, camera video inspection, image intelligent recognition, and intelligent security are adopted, which truly realizes unattended traction substations. The China-Laos Railway is a landmark project along the \"Belt and Road\" countries It is the road of friendship, prosperity and happiness for the people of China and Laos For Laos to get rid of the \"landlocked country\" dilemma It is of great significance to realize the rapid development of foreign economy Chinese electrical equipment will continue to implementation of the new development concept completely, accurately and comprehensively. Actively participate in the \"Belt and Road\" construction Actively integrate into the domestic and international \"dual circulation\" Strive to build a world-class smart electrical equipment group\n\nview all"
