As he stated in the opening of the national working meeting of the Association of Indonesian Municipal Government (Apeksi), “I challenge regional government capable of constructing high-cost mas transportation systems, such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rapid Transit (LRT), or high-speed trains with regional budgets. Please coordinate with the Minister of Transportation if the regional budget is sufficient. For example, it can be a 50-50 split, 50% from the regional and 50% from the national budgets. Because if not, in 10-20 years, all cities will be congested,” Read more at https://buff.ly/3VdIOZF #news #LatestNews #Jokowi #MRT #LRT #transportation\n\n🚂 《《D̳I̳G̳I̳T̳A̳L̳ ̳R̳A̳I̳L̳W̳A̳Y̳》》 🚂 𝑯𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊 𝑹𝒂𝒊𝒍 is a trusted partner to the world’s best transport organisations. 💯 📍This company is famous for Japan's iconic high speed bullet train🚄, draws on the digital and AI expertise of Hitachi Group companies to accelerate innovation and develop new technologies. Hitachi Rail's mission in the project was to implement the 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝗧𝗖𝗦 𝗟𝟮 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱, utilizing cutting-edge technology to enhance railway safety and efficiency.

This collaboration could involve testing Japanese high-speed trains and systems in the SRTC's controlled environment, providing valuable insights and contributing to the enhancement of railway technologies. The partnership could extend beyond testing to knowledge exchange and skill development, allowing Japanese rail professionals to collaborate with their Singaporean counterparts. This cross-cultural collaboration could result in the development of cutting-edge railway systems that meet the specific needs of both countries. Regional Testing Hub and Knowledge Exchange: Japan and Singapore can explore the potential of establishing the SRTC as a regional testing hub for railway technology. This would involve inviting neighboring countries, including India, to utilize the facilities for testing and integrating their rail systems, fostering regional cooperation and knowledge exchange in the field of rail infrastructure. The SRTC's ambition to serve as a training ground for rail professionals presents an opportunity for Japanese experts to share their expertise with aspiring professionals from Singapore and other regional partners. This collaborative approach can contribute to the development of a skilled workforce capable of supporting the growth of railway networks in the Asia-Pacific region."
