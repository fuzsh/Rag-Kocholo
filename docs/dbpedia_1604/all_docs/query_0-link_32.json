        "text": "According to the GlobalData project database, 250 rail construction projects broke ground in 2023, with a combined cost of $249.8bn. This is roughly the same as the number of railway projects that entered the execution phase in 2022, but the capital expenditure has halved compared to the 2022 figure of $500bn.\n\nIn previous years Asia has dominated the list of rail construction projects, and this year is no different with 42% of all railway projects to break ground in 2023 located in the continent. India is home to the most construction projects with 40 entering the execution phase over the last year, followed by China with 28.\n\nThe most common type of rail construction project to break ground over the last year was mass rapid transit or metro projects. Almost a quarter (24.8%) of all railway construction projects across the globe were mass rapid transit or metro projects, costing a total of over $87.4bn.\n\nOf the top 10 most expensive rail construction projects of 2023, seven are in Asia, showing the continent’s hunger for rail megaprojects. Half of the top ten most expensive rail construction projects in 2023 were mass rapid transit or metro projects.\n\nSo, here are the 10 most expensive rail construction projects to break ground in 2023, according to the GlobalData construction projects database.\n\n10.
