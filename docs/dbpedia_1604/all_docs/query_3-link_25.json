        "text": "UTAR Hosts Empowering Rail Program Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) today hosted the \"Empowering Rail\" program in collaboration with Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) at its Sungai Long Campus in Kajang, Selangor. The \"Professional Short Course\" program, facilitated by UTAR, is tailored specifically for KTMB personnel. The program emphasizes research and innovation in rolling stock, development of training modules and curriculum, and the enhancement of capacity building and human resource capabilities. The event commenced with an address by UTAR President and CEO, Ir. Prof. Dato' Dr. Ewe Hong Tat, followed by remarks from the Head of KTM Academy, Mr. Jamil Nan. This collaboration aims to strengthen academic partnerships with KTMB through the KTM Academy (MyRA), focusing on research and innovation in rolling stock maintenance, ultimately benefiting KTMB‚Äôs workforce. Key attendees included the Head of Electrification Department, En. Ir Mohammad Asri Yusof, the Head of KTM Academy, En. Jamil Nan, along with participating KTMB staff and UTAR delegates. Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR)\n\nMARIC - establishing a footprint in Jakarta, Indonesia There‚Äôs so many possibilities for business and collaboration among the players in ASEAN. Not withholding, the booming rail infrastructure and systems industry in both Malaysia and Indonesia. So, here we are, having serious talks and discussions with the leaders of relevant organisations in Jakarta, Indonesia. Of course, the rail projects is taking place from the very east to the west of Indonesia; from Sumatra to Kalimantan. Our first stop was the Ministry of Transportation, meeting the charming Director of Railways, Pak Mohamad Risal Wasal. He presented on the 2030 National Railway Master Plan of Indonesia. Other attendees including Pak Tuhiyat, President Director of MRT Jakarta and Pak Allan Tandiono, Project Management and Business Development Director of KCIC, the high speed rail operator. Together with us from the Malaysian Embassy, Mohd Najeeb Abdullah, Menteri Penasihat (Ekonomi) gave an excellent introduction on our behalf. After almost 2 hours of discussion, we establish two very key takeaways: 1. MARIC gave a good impression of the rail industry development in Malaysia and established the relationship with the entities, in particular Pak Risal, Pak Tuhiyat and Pak Allan. 2. The Indonesia side open their arms for Malaysian investment and participation in the numerous projects that is and will be happening in this country. And will keep regular contacts with MARIC. Alhamdulillah. We left with a cup of coffee as Pak Risal said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs celebrate our new friendship with coffee‚Äù. But we also left with new friends and new hope for Malaysia - Indonesia collaboration and integration. Insyallah. MARIC is the Malaysia Rail Industry Corporation - the consortium of system works companies and the voice of the rail industry.
