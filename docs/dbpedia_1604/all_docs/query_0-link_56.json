        "text": "Software Validation\n\nEngineers and scientists increasingly rely on software developed by independent professionals or specialized third-party firms. Consequently, before committing to a product, essential questions must be answered regarding the accuracy, validation, competence, documentation, support as well as updates of any engineering scientific software package.\n\nIs the software package:\n\naccurate, and how can this be verified?\n\nwell-documented?\n\nadequately supported (e.g. regular updates & enhancements, state-of-the-art technical support, and prompt provision of fixes or workarounds in case of a bug or other issue)?\n\nReliable and accurate engineering and scientific software must have an adequate validation report, and be supported with sufficient documentation. So while all the above questions are important, the first is crucial for the safety and integrity of any engineering study or design, and the second addresses a fundamental requirement for ensuring an adequate understanding of the subject and usage of the technical software.\n\nSES's engineers and scientists conduct their own R&D and are continuously engaged in providing advanced R&D consulting services to our industry partners. This unique combination allows SES to develop and maintain state‑of‑the‑art software that meets and even exceeds the requirements of the industries we serve. SES's scientific publications, in the most reputable journals, are just one indication of the favorable reputation SES has earned in the scientific community. For more than four decades, SES has been an undisputed leader and a pioneer in the fields of grounding, lightning and electromagnetic interference. The following describes the work and related documentation which are completed to ensure that our CDEGS software complies with the most stringent requirements related to the aforementioned questions, with particular emphasis on the first two.\n\nFor over forty-five years, our software has been subject to extensive scientific validation, using field tests and comparisons with analytical and published research results. This validation, which continues today, is conducted by SES and independent researchers, and is documented in hundreds of technical papers published in peer-reviewed international journals (list of Technical Publications).\n\nEach computation module is tested to ensure that it produces accurate results for multiple cases documented internally at SES, and for several fundamental cases which are made available to users on digital media. Prior to every new release, these cases are retested, and the results are validated by comparing them to previously obtained results, which in turn were validated in preceding years via the following four well-documented mechanisms."
