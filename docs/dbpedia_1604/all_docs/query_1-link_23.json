        "text": "Trying out a new feature this time: videos on STC! Click the relevant buttons to download and view video content.\n\nA beautiful, modern city with numerous glittering buildings overlooking the peaceful waters of an idyllic river, under which many metro lines run, carrying thousands across at each go, every two to three minutes. Above, a robust network of bus lines operated with modern and sleek buses cover the entire city and beyond, plying on paint-marked bus lanes on roads lined with trees and colourful flowers. It is a major economic and business hub for the region, and with its high economic status accorded, life is indeed quite stressful for its millions of inhabitants. Must say though, this city has some really beautiful parks for its inhabitants to chill in when they aren’t actively being stressed at work.\n\nIf you thought this paragraph was describing Singapore, you are dead wrong. This post is brought to you, the reader, from Shenzhen, China, a vast megapolis of 12.6 million, with beautiful skylines and an impressive technologically-backed infrastructure base.\n\n(and the header photo of this article, is Floof chilling by the seaside at the picturesque Shenzhen Bay Park!)\n\nOver the past week or so I have been in mainland China as part of an overseas trip, and the scale, quality, or the design of public transport and urban design in some Chinese cities have blown me away sufficiently many times, despite mentally priming myself knowing how far ahead can be. This post wouldn’t really be about any specific feature that I have found impressive in any particular system I visited over the past week or so, but rather a collation of my observation of the cities I have visited. To be frank, sometimes the beauty of a working transit system or humanist urban planning lies in the small things, more often than not.\n\nHaving been to Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shenzhen and a handful of other smaller cities along the way, each city experience has surprisingly enabled me to take something away, even if I was supposed to be there for other activities. As a bonus, I have managed to take two trips on China’s legendary high-speed rail network so far, so that’s definitely something I will touch upon later, although I must say it has been slightly underwhelming due to how well its supporters have been selling it internationally.\n\nThe country of buses\n\nChinese buses (referring specifically to urban transit buses) are almost everything that Singapore buses aren’t, and lest the comments write themselves, this isn’t a good thing all the time. For one, those pixels on the electronic display signages are more fully used than they are in Singapore, and not just because Chinese characters are more pixel-intensive — many various displays used for other useful informational purposes not seen in Singapore are employed as a mainstay on buses in China.\n\nFor instance, immediately upon stepping out of Guangzhou’s Baiyun airport on the first day, I was greeted by a bus which had the rear EDS doubling up as a literary hazard light indicator:\n\nNo worries even if you are illiterate in Chinese, because it’s pretty obvious what this sign is saying. This feature appears to have already been in place as far back as my 2016 visit to Kunming, and this appears to be a ubiquitous feature across China that we certainly can learn from. It has a sister function, the literary brake light:\n\nIt’s a bit more work for those who don’t know the language, but variations of this sign found on buses across China all read some form of “Braking! Attention!”, to signal to motorists behind to stop.\n\nThese aren’t special EDS scrolls — the displays are programmed to automatically switch to these messages when the bus captain puts his hazard lights, or presses the brakes. To configure the LED displays to enable such coordination with other systems on board the vehicle requires a specific level of technical capability and compatibility that Singapore has yet to achieve.\n\nIt’s not just the rear display that displays something innovative and novel to marvel at. On a day trip to Quanzhou, Fujian a few days after, a chance encounter with a roadside bus terminal enroute to the destination offered me the opportunity to see a rare feature that is far less common even within China:\n\nAlthough it might be treated as overkill in a place like Singapore where such information is already provided on display boards inside bus facilities, posting the specific departure timing of the bus on the front display still comes in very handy in a setting such as end-on bus interchanges, which newer bus facilities being slated for opening in the near future make use of generously. Having the bus itself also state the time of departure gives passengers a psychological assurance that the bus will depart on time, and of course, gives the operator and bus captain less room to mess around and deliberately delay departures for non-operational reasons, since it’s written in black-and-white on the bus itself! How revolutionary such a feature is even more shocking when it took a trip to a city that almost no one outside eastern China heard of for it to be discovered. It’s not a feature unique to Quanzhou buses however — I was informed that some operators in Shanghai also do this too.\n\n… to a fault?\n\nTruly, China is a nation of buses. Lots of them, wherever one finds himself. Heck, public buses in Chinese cities such as Shenzhen perform roles beyond the typical conception of urban public bus services. For instance, ever heard of a public coach bus? Outside of perhaps North America (specifically Canada), one would be hard pressed to find anywhere else operating coach buses as public transit. In China, that’s under the public transport system, to provide affordable express bus rides to its burgeoning urban populations.\n\nThough as time went on, my travels in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Quanzhou leave me with the unshakeable feeling that China might have gone somewhat overboard. Outside the peak periods, I observed buses operating really frequently, so high that they were capable of rivalling that of the metro in smaller Chinese cities. In many cases, said buses were empty, even in downtown areas where demand was expected to be highest. Despite the massive population of cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the operating protocol for buses there appears to be one of operating smaller buses at higher frequencies. This comes as a benefit to passengers’ convenience, but is not exactly the most sustainable practice, even in the Chinese context, given how many Chinese urban transit bus systems have been struggling financially since the pandemic and have yet to fully recover. While I mentioned how this is a highly future-proof approach in anticipation for a future of autonomous buses offering the possibility of superfrequent bus services on a large scale, the short term financial prospects of urban bus service in Chinese cities does not bode well at all. Bus ridership in China took a great hit due to COVID, and never really recovered since then. In the face of acute manpower shortage, financial setbacks and sluggish market recovery due to competition with ridehailing, poorer cities further inland have already been resorting to extreme route and service cuts, with the worst-hit completely ceasing all public bus operations altogether.\n\nBigger cities like Guangzhou, or even the seemingly wealthy but small Quanzhou might think their economic prowess shields them from such a scary prospect, but one can never know. Seeing so many smaller empty buses, even during peak periods, convinces me that Chinese cities can do better with controlled streamlining of routes, consolidating the fleet into larger 12-metre buses. They can always revive the smaller, more “cost-effective” 8m and 10m buses when the autonomous bus transition occurs in about a decade or so, given current progress. The key now is to preserve the current net service quantity through a period of scarcity until the automation era arrives. Of course, consolidating midibuses running every 6 minutes into full-size buses running every 10 minutes still ensures that bus services are frequent enough to be relied upon, but their effect in streamlining the messy bus networks covering big Chinese cities cannot be understated!\n\nElectric Republic\n\nIn 2017, this beautiful city sitting upon the peaceful bays of the Pearl River got a little quieter. That year, all 16,000 of its buses completed the transition to full electric traction, making Shenzhen the first (and only?) city in the world to operate a fully electric public bus fleet since. Well, to make it honest, this process of greening their bus fleet has been ongoing since the early 2010s. In fact, prior to Shenzhen’s introduction of their first BYD K9 fleets, Singapore was ahead in the green public transit game, with all forms of “green” bus (short of electric) undergoing trial operation, and sometimes even at limited scale. Hybrid, biofuel, CNG and hydrogen-powered buses had all been tested to varying extents by SBS Transit by end 2010. If you told someone familiar with both cities back then that one day Shenzhen would leapfrog Singapore in the clean energy race, you’d get stared at with disbelief and laughed off the table. Yet that was exactly what happened, starting in August 2011 with the first batch of 200 BYD K9 buses for the Universaide held that year. Since then, they have never looked back, and we’ve been left in the dust by the rapidly expanding army of electric buses possessed by mainland Chinese municipal governments. Why the sudden turn tables, given our usual advantage in things like RnD and national emphasis on the environment?\n\nGranted, an entire decade is a really long time for about anything to happen, but Shenzhen kick started their electrification campaign harder, so to speak. With an initial fleet of 200 electric buses, this meant that the city’s bus operators could rapidly build up a knowledge pool of operational experience aimed at the unique challenges of operating (battery) electric bus services, which in turn makes scaling up the electric fleet technically easier and also less politically arduous a proposal within internal circles. It also helps that more than 80% of Shenzhen’s public bus services are franchised to three companies all owned by the government, thus making possible the cross-sharing of technical expertise to form effectively one large nationalised entity. Also, their entire fleet is pretty much nothing but BYD, which means less operational complexity from a fleet upkeep level too.\n\nMeanwhile, it would take Singapore until late 2024 (scheduled) to finally introduce at-scale electric bus operations, more than two decades after we made the first step in new energy buses. What have we been doing in the meantime? Well, we did try out one BYD K9 that looked exactly like the ones in Shenzhen, which led to 20 more that looked slightly different, and then…\n\nPut simply, we have been very reluctant to stride forward in embracing electric buses as a whole, be it the more failsafe trolleybus or the more widely used battery electric bus. Translated into tangible action, this means an immense unwillingness to go beyond the stage of merely testing the waters, and lingering far too long upon the trial stage. LTA’s attitude towards electric buses over the past decades can be best summed up in the following quote contributed by an unknown Discord user in an unknown server:\n\nSingapore is the guy taking all the samples in the supermarket when others are already at the checkout counter\n\nUnknown (????)\n\nWhy the tardiness in electrification? The more gruff among industry insiders will point immediately at one flaw in Singapore’s bus facilities and dismiss calls for faster electrification: infrastructure, or specifically that our bus infrastructure (terminals, depots etc.) are simply not equipped to handle the additional consideration of enabling electric buses to recharge. Which is a valid concern if examined only in consideration of immediate context. The lack of charging available to support large electric bus fleets has meant that Singapore’s first bulk order of electric buses was only announced on 26 November 2023, and those buses would be put into service in tandem with new depots entering service soon and equipped with the necessary fixtures to support electric bus operations.\n\nExcept, this line of logic quickly finds itself in a chicken-and-egg endless cycle scenario, which is exactly what LTA found itself in and failed to get out of for the past decade while much of the Asia-Pacific region surged ahead in the electrification wave. Chance after chance was made available to provide adequate charging facilities to support large fleets, in the form of the successive new depots that LTA opened up under the Bus Contracting Model. Between 2016 and 2023, the Bulim, Loyang, Seletar, Ulu Pandan and Mandai depots were put into operation. Of them, the first three offer limited charging points, and the last two come with zero charging at all. These were all chances to sync the introduction of the necessary ancillary equipment needed for viable electrification and potential mass introduction of electric buses. Instead, LTA’s overly cautious approach led to highly limited charging infrastructure provisioned at early BCM-era depots, which further made the case against bulk buying electric buses for years, until a valid reason surfaced that necessitated a mass order of buses in general. That reason would be the impending retirement of the Euro IV Scania buses from the end of the year. An excessive stockpile of diesel buses available as a result of indulgent practices from the early BCM era further weakened any argument for buying large quantities of electric buses as well.\n\nWell, being daring enough to take that leap of faith to skip over the trial phase directly, as well as the other consolidative advantages that Shenzhen had would explain how it attained full electrification (save few private routes) by 2017, but the electric bus storm was not just a Shenzhen phenomenon. It was a phenomenon across all of mainland China, especially from the late 2010s onwards. How then, did the rest of China progressively ramp up electrification so quickly, such that they made up 98% of all operational electric buses in the world by 2021?\n\nThe answer is also the key to breaking the endless logical cycle of not ramping up electric bus operations. As you can probably guess, it’s strong government willpower to proceed with such a project requiring great initial investment that private enterprise would find financially unviable for the shorter return cycles they work with. In this respect, the Chinese, in part due to their higher stakes in this environment-concerned project, had governments at all levels committing greatly toward mass electrification of bus fleets. When Singapore’s LTA was waiting for the results of personal electric automobiles before committing, cities around China had their bus fleets take the lead, before battery electric vehicles began making their way into personal automobiles and other commercial vehicles. With almost every public bus parking lot observed to be equipped with a charger, to make such provisions so thoroughly is a great endeavour that cannot be accomplished without a serious government commitment towards the goal of electrification. The resolute and decisive voice of leaders in the relevant agencies is key to breaking out of the self-justifying loop of not charging ahead (pun intended). Having fleet electrification as a priority drives swift action, so much so that smaller cities in China have actually electrified their bus fleets before they attained wheelchair accessibility! Case in point: Quanzhou with the eye-grabbing departure function on the EDS only announced their first wheelchair-accessible buses two days after I visited, while their entire fleet of buses numbering in the thousands had long ago been electrified, evident from the front styling of the fleet dating back to the early 2010s.\n\nA city where every bus parking lot has a charger, be it plug-in or overhead opportunity charging. The average Singaporean would drop his jaws in amazement at this seemingly impossible feat, but hey, it’s a staple sight in the East!\n\nSingapore finally confirmed, on 26th November 2023, it’s first purchase of 360 electric buses, 240 of which supplied by BYD and the other 120 by Zhongtong. We are horribly late to the party, but better late than never.\n\nA two-wheeled tradition\n\nDuring my stay in Shenzhen, I had the chance to visit one of their more significant universities, the relatively new Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), for a series of academic talks.\n\nIt boasts a magnificent campus in harmony with the natural elements the campus is built on, and in terms of its area, it is just slightly smaller than that of Singapore’s NTU. That is already a huge campus for a university situated relatively deep within Shenzhen’s urban area. Yet, unlike NTU or NUS, the students here don’t rely much on the campus shuttle bus to bring them around school. The fact that SUSTech’s ISB is meager and infrequent aside (although it is a significant factor), buses aren’t used as much to get around campus due to a healthy and bustling cycling culture among students and staff.\n\nIn particular, the campus has a somewhat decent network of cycling paths to bring those on their PMDs around town. This may be a “pull factor” towards enabling cycling on the campus, but coming from a place where such a feature is a novelty, there is a reason why cycling paths were installed on the (new) campus in the first place, right?\n\nIt’s part of a larger cycling culture that China has had since the long-gone days where a certain red book was freely distributed across the nation for all to read. Remember these 1980s-era photos that showed a sea of bicycles accompanied by relatively empty roads mainly taken up by buses?\n\nWhile China has become much more affluent since then, this cycling culture has remained largely intact, although the modern observer who bases “cycling culture” off the Dutch experience may find it difficult to draw parallels from Chinese streets. Electric scooters and PMDs continue to remain the mainstay (in numbers) on the roads here, with estimates from last year suggesting that scooters alone number twice as many as cars across the nation. Perhaps the days of every Chinese person owning his bicycle are gone as urbanisation kicks into high gear, but the culture of riding a vehicle on two wheels lives on in yet another form that Singapore is intimately familiar with: bicycle sharing. In case you didn’t notice, of the initial three big bike sharing companies that entered the Singapore market, two of them (ofo and Mobike) were of Chinese origin. Both Singapore and China, having experienced their chaotic era of dockless bikes causing more trouble than benefit, have more or less stabilised their dockless bike sharing industry, with incidents of irresponsible use and operations dying down by the time COVID hit.\n\nPerhaps this would not come across as particularly innovative, but docked bike sharing solutions have continued to maintain a resilient and reliable presence in China through the ebbs and flows of the dockless bike craze. It would probably benefit Singapore to operate a hybrid bike sharing system that can both be accessed from fixed docks or flexible parking areas (the yellow boxes marked with the bicycle sign), and consolidated (at least, given a common platform) to remove access barriers. That would be the ideal that the bike sharing business seeks to aim towards. As always, the hybrid solution works better than its two constituent parts alone.\n\nBut what gives rise to such a profound cycling culture in the first place? If you observed those old pictures above carefully, you might notice something that the modern Chinese city still preserves: rights-of-way for bicycles\n\n车同轨，书同文，行同伦\n\nFor those who can’t read Chinese, the above is the summary of Qin Shi Huang’s unification policies, which were applied across the entire empire upon the Qin dynasty’s formation in 221 BCE. In terms of urban mobility, certain things remain a staple across most Chinese cities beyond a certain size. Others, standardised across the board.\n\nThe most immediate difference a pedestrian would notice in an average Chinese city compared to one elsewhere would be the large swarms of electric scooters and the equally large horde of bicycles, shared or not. From the early days when automobiles began running en masse on the streets of China previously occupied by bicycles, it was apparent that car-bike conflicts would become a huge problem, especially as the vehicle population (in both categories) grew exponentially to meet surging demand in the expanding megapolises of the 1990s and 2000s. The consequence of such concerns was that every Chinese city would implement an extensive network of lanes for two-wheeled vehicles paralleling the roads which cars plied, to separate two-wheelers and four-wheelers, at least within the downtown area where traffic was at its worst. Ostensibly, that requirement, while a noble start to a unified policy direction on dealing with two-wheeled mobility tools, was interpreted very liberally by various cities, leading to vastly differing implementations for the same expected outcome. The key difference lay in what portion of the limited road diet the city was willing to set aside for a dedicated-two wheeler lane, on both sides of the road in both directions.\n\nShenzhen, apparently due to its urban planning being significantly influenced by Singapore during its planning stages, follows a very similar approach to our implementation of bicycle rights-of-way on roads. Placed together with the sidewalk, the two-wheeler lane runs beside the road in spaces primarily for pedestrians. Of course, the shortcomings in such a model are many, and Singapore readers would be very familiar with all the mishaps that occured on these “common paths” between pedestrians, cyclists and PMDs. Or the problems that arise when such paths interface with bus stops, such that riders are typically forced to either ride a PMD through the bus stop directly, resulting in many close shaves. Given how similar the set-ups are, it would be expected that similar issues would arise in Shenzhen too, and more often, with greater injury, as the electric scooters buzzing around Chinese cities are fast, heavy, and exist in overwhelming number.\n\nThat being said, a positive development to bicycle paths observed in Shenzhen is the heavy usage of such paths by the city’s residents on their scooters and bikes speeding back and forth along these ubiquitous paths. A similar observation of the PCN network, Singapore’s equivalent, would show barely any use, and ironically one may spot more recreational joggers than actual cyclists using such PCN infrastructure. Obviously, when such infrastructure is built mostly in far-flung areas with the express intent of connecting recreational zones (mainly parks), one should not expect an interconnective and viable cycling network that the general public can use for their daily travel needs. On the other hand, in Shenzhen, these bicycle lanes beside the road exist along almost every single road in the downtown area! That’s a huge chunk of its 1,734 sq km covered by bike lane. To give a sense of how much this is, Singapore spans only 734.3 sq km, including all islands under her jurisdiction, and yet, we have only just begun catching up in cycling path mileage.\n\nOther cities interpret this directive as setting aside road space for bicycles and similar two-wheeled transport, such as Xiamen, Guangzhou and Kunming. In the case of Xiamen, they appear to take on a mixed approach, with narrower roads seeing space on the sidewalk set aside for cycling infrastructure, and boy must I say, they are one hella generous with the cycling path widths.\n\nAlong the banks of the Dragon Boat Pond in Xiamen’s Jimei education belt, cycling paths measure as wide as 5 meters, flanked with an additional 1.5m of pedestrian path on both sides, as well as another 2m wide pedestrian path on the other side of the vehicular road.\n\nOn a narrower street at night on the island:\n\nI highly regret not going for a bicycle rendezvous on my scraps of free time available… The excellent cycling infrastructure would have made for an exciting experience that I can only sadly imagine of now. Hopefully, the town-wide cycling network in Ang Mo Kio completes sooner so I can somewhat have a taste of what a connective and broadly-accessible cycling infrastructure.\n\nA little blending in trick\n\nWhile chilling at a certain park in Xiamen flanked by a famous lake and the strait, a little gem was found.\n\nHere’s an image of a bus laying over at a bus park. Without further context, attempt to guess its surroundings:\n\nStill struggling? No clue?\n\nHere’s your answer:\n\nThis bus park (I presume?) is located as part of a public park that overlooks the Xiamen Strait looking towards the main Xiamen Island. Located together with a carpark, the facility is just a bare parking lot, and no one would guess its purpose as a bus terminus without the presence of the occasional bus arriving to park, or the signage at the gate indicating its use. Although part of prime waterfront land, integrating the bus park as part of the public park enables buses to terminate near this major tourist attraction (the Dragon Boat Pond opposite) without ruining the view. Xiamen’s light-blue liveried public buses almost perfectly blend into the park landscape surreptitiously. Below is the view a bus captain parking at said bus park would be treated to upon stepping outside his bus after a lengthy shift in the evening:\n\nPanoramic view of the integrated space also captured in the clip below:\n\nA prime example of bite-sized, manageable portions of bus infrastructure that can be conveniently slotted into corners of the city one least expects, while maintaining connective capability to key demand points.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nThat’s the official Indonesian branding for their recently-launched Jakarta-Bandung HSR service, utilising a derivative of the latest Fuxing CR400AF technology developed entirely indigenously.\n\nHaving to city-hop in China, across significant distances (one doesn’t need to check a map to know that Guangzhou to Xiamen and then Shenzhen is a long distance), I have had my luck trying out Chinese high-speed rail, for the first time. Adding to the experience is perhaps being able to try out differing train models on both rides so far, to offer a comparison between the two main series of Chinese HSR rolling stock — older Hexie (CRH) and newer Fuxing (CR) trains.\n\nBeing the first time stepping foot on a Chinese HSR, the first ride was a mix of excitement and expectation management. Legroom was aplenty and the aisles were wide despite the wide seating, which provided for a comfy ride. The CR400AF and its derivatives were also designed with a wide windowsill and large tables that enabled working on the train. In terms of food, I was served a Hakka classic from Guangdong — mei cai kou rou. Not bad, comparable with what I could find in the other restaurants I ate at along the way in Guangdong and Fujian.\n\nPurely from the perspective of amenities, the CR400AF-A offered a great experience.\n\nOf course, some other things I looked forward to was the much-touted “coin test” that was performed on the Fuxing when it first debuted in 2017. According to the videos on the internet, the Fuxing trains operated so smoothly at speeds as high as 350km/h that unstable items like pens, coins and mobile phones could remain upright on the windowsill for dozens of minutes on end.\n\nUnfortunately, my first experience with Chinese HSR (Guangzhou South >> Xiamen North) left me disappointed, as neither of the two claims in the statement above actually came true. Despite being designed for 400km/h (hence the model name), the CR400AF-A barely exceeded 200km/h for many portions of the journey. To further ruin it, the train in question was marked as a “G” service, denoting service that operated faster than 250km/h, rather than a “D” to indicate general EMU service. I could noticeably feel the shaking as the train advanced, which basically cast any hope of passing the coin test out of the window.\n\nAdding insult to injury was the number of stops the supposedly fast “G”-class train made from Guangzhou to Xiamen.\n\n9 stations from Guangzhou to Xiamen, taking almost 4 hours! By comparison, the return train I took from Xiamen to Shenzhen took just a little longer (compared with the Shenzhen-Xiamen sector of G1626), called at more minor stations, and it used older CRH rolling stock meant only for 250km/h service!\n\nHorrible joke scheduling right here. Long gone are the days where a lightning strike would cause a fatal accident on the HSR system, and the nationwide speed limit for HSR trains imposed after 2011 had been lifted as far back as 2016! Why the heck are the trains still being scheduled so slowly, more so the flagship Fuxing designed to operate faster? The tour guide really wasn’t lying when she said the speed limitations imposed on Chinese HSR were excessive. Topping it off, the flagship Fuxing CR400AF-A was repeatedly overtaken by first-generation CRH1 trains (designed for 200km/h, operated at 250km/h) assigned to slower “D” and “C” services. Amazing.\n\nIt didn’t take me long to figure out why:\n\nThe Hangshen PDL which the line operated on, while running on dedicated viaducts and tunnels, was built with ballasted rails, rather than the concrete-based trackbed technology necessary to pass the coin test and ensure smooth high-speed operations. Perhaps it was due to it being an older line, but I should have given myself a disclaimer that a line running on ballasted track shouldn’t be expecting a repeat of the marvels that the Beijing-Shanghai PDL would enjoy. The ballast trackbed also explains why the Japanese Shinkansen, German ICE and French TGV fail the coin test. It also irked me slightly that the interior displays on the Fuxing CR400AF-A kept scrolling through a whole bunch of irrelevant messages rather than keeping it plain and simple with the information that passengers needed or demanded, such as the train speed and next station. Thanks for the constant reminder to not evade fares and commit the “seven railway sins”, but it gets very annoying to read when one sees it for the 428445254562th time on a multi-hour long train journey.\n\nThe subsequent return trip gave a few positives the older Hexie gave over the newer Fuxing stock. Deployed on the trip bound for Hong Kong was the *sighs* Shinkansen-derived CRH2A.\n\nAs per the usual for older Hexie trains built from foreign tech transfers, much of the interior wasn’t as well-thought out (even adjusting for second-class standards) as the later Fuxing models. Surprisingly for something of Japanese origin, the CRH2A’s interior looks pretty drab standard, as compared to the extensive usage of wood facades for the interior of the Fuxing trains.\n\nAt least, it offers the one feature that HSR enthusiasts look out for with a hawkish eye consistently:\n\nI’m not sure if it’s attributed to the difference in train model or different operating bureau (G1626 is handled by CR Guangzhou, G3003 by CR Nanchang), but the announcements on the ride to Shenzhen were actually made by a human voice, as opposed to straight-up using Microsoft text-to-speech to make announcements on the Fuxing 💀.\n\nThe megaplex in itself\n\nUrbanists from around the world blast Chinese HSR stations as being more airport-like as opposed to the typical characteristics of HSR infrastructure that lend it an advantage over airports: far from the city center, huge urban footprint and insane access penalty.\n\nSo far, I haven’t encountered too much issues with accessibility for Chinese HSR stations, although I could see more than a few problems that wheelchair-bound riders would face. Nonetheless, every platform is provisioned with two lifts (one for entry, one for exit), and generally it’s easy to access the large waiting concourse filled with shops after entering the station building itself, with security checks taking up less space than I would have expected — it is integrated seamlessly with the first round of check-ins required to enter the station.\n\nUnfortunately the designers of Shenzhen North station thought it was a good idea to give more airport vibes to it, which isn’t really my main nitpick, but rather that the gate behind, meant to serve as access to two trains simultaneously, is only as wide as the space typically allotted for one single train in many other HSR stations I’ve seen. During the low tourist season, it appears fine, but when Chunyun comes around before Chinese New Year…\n\nThe only station that has had real access penalty issues so far is Guangzhou South, where I began my first HSR ride towards Xiamen. Passengers who came from the metro were dropped off within the station building, while those arriving in buses (public and private) were required to disembark at a rundown carpark some distance away, cross a 6-lane road (which was empty?), and walk through a dimly-lit hallway deep within the bowels of the station building, which did not appear to be intended initially as an entrance passageway. Additionally, Guangzhou South saw boarding passengers go through the most elevation change from street to train — two long escalators up to the main waiting area, and one down to the actual train platforms. For the matter, access via cars and taxis appear to be less than ideal — I saw what appeared to be an intended drop-off point cordoned off and taxis trapped in congestion at one of the station exits. Not the most coherently-planned and integrated HSR station.\n\nBy contrast, arriving in Xiamen North would be a pleasure for passengers connecting to other transport to head into the main urban area. All transport modes that offered access to the railway station, such as the metro, BRT, conventional buses, ride-hailing and taxis were placed under the same station roof, hence fitting the practical definition of an “integrated transport hub”. Granted, the station was ungodly huge which resulted in long transfer linkways, but enabling connections with more transport modes was a step up from what I experienced in Guangzhou.\n\nThe second ride from Xiamen to Shenzhen North was even better, as both stations featured the least access penalty among the 4 stations visited so far. Xiamen railway station (located on the island, different from Xiamen North above) was renovated in 2012 to expand the station facilities, but the lower access penalty arrangements seen in older Chinese railway stations was retained. Shenzhen North station performed even better in this regard: the exit passage that the staircases from all platforms led to directly lead out of the station building at ground level, into a nice urban square which the station overlooks. Integration-wise, Shenzhen North is a bit messy with the bus terminal (?) scattered across two sections (??) some distance away, and the metro exits about 50 meters from the station entrance. Given what I was expecting already, such considerate station design was definitely a welcome surprise.\n\nWhile waiting to depart Xiamen, I had the opportunity to film the Xiamen BRT, which was located right outside the railway station building, level with the waiting hall. The combined frequency of the 10 services operating on 4 intertwined branches gives rise to a form of superfrequency one can only dream of for their buses in many other non-Chinese cities.\n\nWhat’s light rail?\n\nThat was the oldest rail-related question I posed on STC when it was initially launched in July 2020. Since then, there’s been quite some talk about APMs and LRTs and how Singapore is performing so horribly at either there is so much that can be done to improve their standard. In a subsequent post last year, I further clarified the talk on “light rail”, by setting aside its critical difference with trams due to the latter’s resurgent popularity in transit circles locally. The critical difference, and tldr: Where both operate at-grade, light rail is defined by exclusive rights-of-way, a feature the former lacks. So if Singapore’s “light rail” isn’t actually light rail, as we established, what then is the light rail we should be striving toward?\n\nFor quite a while I had been looking for an answer that was appropriate for the feeder/long feeder, lower-capacity and local-oriented solution that our town APMs were built with the intent of resolving. Technologies such as the Innovia Metro light rail systems proved too capital-intensive and thus less appropriate for such applications. Utilising an all-bus system would, even if fully automated, mean compromises made on capacity and even rights-of-way that distinguished these intended LRT corridors from conventional buses.\n\nI suppose that the answer has been found on my first night in Guangzhou. Located near my hotel was Foshan’s Nansha “Tram”, a fully-enclosed, fully automated (GoA4) light rail system operating primarily along road medians in its dedicated right of way, combined with overhead infrastructure at critical sectors to bypass traffic. Despite the official “tram” branding, its ability to keep traffic out of its path altogether makes this a true-blue light rail line. For the matter, the light rail vehicles employed are also able to accelerate considerably quickly, to match those of the smaller buses that ply Guangzhou’s streets.\n\nThe Nansha LRT, as the name suggests, runs through the Nansha region on the official border between Guangzhou and Foshan. Being one of the newer business areas being currently under development, demand for the service is rather sluggish, although trains do fill up to half full during the peak periods, operating about every 4 minutes. Outside the peak, frequencies drop to 8 minutes. In the context of a local light rail service, coupled with the bus-like station spacing every 500 to 700 meters, the Nansha LRT is effectively one big automated bus rapid transit system on rails. Frequency can get a lot better to improve the line’s performance though, that’s for sure, although that would be a policy matter for the relevant agencies in Guangzhou and Foshan to sort out.\n\nFor the more aesthetically-inclined, the Nansha LRT also emulates the Parisian light rail tramways pretty well, with the trackbed lined with grass to improve the visual effects of the running line. Unfortunately, being located in the road median, the design of the stations leaves some to be desired — for such a small train, a large station building built, as well as a massive overhead bridge to access the station. Nonetheless, such a set-up still offers far more value for lower investment, as compared to the APM systems that Singapore has implemented. I believe this form of LRT is what Tehsiewdai had envisioned when he mentioned a “tram-based” alternative to the current APM technology used.\n\nIt has been an exciting and fulfiling week and half travelling around some key cities on China’s eastern and southern coast. I’d probably get accused of being a wumao for saying this, but for all the faults that Chinese urban planning and transport management has thrown, much hope for the future of urban design does lie in these East Asian cities. Despite their own urban woes as a result of learning the American downtown + suburb model excessively, the interesting ways in which Chinese cities handle their own boatload of problems gives some inspiration and insight into possible solutions that Singapore can look at, even if its execution can be botched at times. In a socialist country where the official mantra is to glorify service to the people, their key strength lies in their sheer quantity of production, which enables wide access to infrastructure, be it in mobility or other aspects. In terms of quality, or service levels as it’s described in transit planning, China isn’t quite there yet in most cities — 7 to 8 minute intervals for the metro is common in many cities, to the exasperation of some — but given their tightened economic belts, they’re doing somewhat well, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that the people want better service too. Much work in progress, but with a full suite of achievements and breakthroughs under its belt, Chinese public transport and urban design definitely have something to offer for cities elsewhere, including those who have supposedly “made it” to world-class status. Even if we’ve truly arrived in terms of infrastructure, the vast majority of cities in the world have a long way to go in improving the human habitat, and that itself is a noble project that cities across the world should cooperate upon.\n\nPostscript: I know I haven’t covered much on rail rapid transit in Chinese cities so far, that’s because I haven’t gotten the opportunity to go near or experience them myself. Hopefully my luck gets better as the trip goes along. 😀"
