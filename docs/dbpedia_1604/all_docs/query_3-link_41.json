        "text": "Thailand’s railway network, carrying both passengers and freight, is an intricate web spanning around 5,000 km and connecting 47 provinces. The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) is the primary operator, overseeing the vast expanse of tracks that cross the nation. Thailand’s railway system forms the backbone of the country’s transportation network. The central hub is Bangkok, serving as the starting point for rail lines reaching various parts of Thailand. The Northern Line connects Bangkok to cities like Chiang Mai, while the North-eastern Line links to provinces such as Nakhon Ratchasima. The Southern Line extends to destinations like Hua Hin and Hat Yai, with a crucial link to Malaysia and Singapore. The Eastern Line connects Bangkok to eastern provinces like Chachoengsao and Pattaya.\n\nThis extensive network facilitates the annual movement of 23 million passengers. In addition to intercity routes, regional rail networks, including the Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS) Skytrain, Metropolitan Rapid Transit (MRT) Lines, Airport Rail Link and commuter rail, play a crucial role in local passenger transportation, especially in and around Bangkok. These lines cover a total distance of 146.25 km and operate through public-private partnerships. Beyond passenger services, the SRT oversees freight trains, contributing around 2 per cent to the country’s total freight transportation – equivalent to 11.37 million metric tonnes annually. This integrated rail system not only facilitates passenger travel across the country but also plays a significant role in supporting the movement of goods, reflecting the SRT’s critical role in Thailand’s transportation system.\n\nChallenges\n\nThailand’s extensive railway network confronts significant challenges, necessitating a critical evolution of its infrastructure. The railway tracks feature single (3,392 km), double (1,103 km) and triple (320 km) track systems, intensifying issues of congestion. With this restricted track network, the movement of trains encounters severe restrictions, particularly impeding the fluid transportation of passengers and goods. This congestion is notably acute in freight transportation, with most freight traversing double tracks concurrently used by passenger trains, rendering railways a less preferred option for freight movement. Complicating these challenges is the financial strain borne by the SRT. Burdened with debt, operational losses, project delays and cost overruns, the SRT grapples with a precarious financial landscape. The repercussions manifest in poor operational efficiency, evidenced by a significant decline in ridership – from 22 million in 1994 to 23 million in 2022. This dual conundrum of infrastructure constraints and financial hardships underscores the imperative for strategic interventions and modernisation efforts to revitalise Thailand’s railway sector, ensuring it remains a robust and efficient mode of transportation for the nation.\n\nNew initiatives and expansion plans\n\nThailand has been actively pursuing the expansion and modernisation of its railway network to enhance connectivity, support economic development and improve transportation efficiency. At the core of these strategic initiatives is a profound commitment to elevating connectivity, propelling economic development, and optimising the efficiency of transportation infrastructure. Of the 3,392 km, SRT is working towards upgrading the 3,157 km of single-track network to double track under the Trans Asian Railway and Track Rehabilitation Policy. Currently, double tracking of around 990 km has been completed and the remaining is under construction. Additionally, about 681 km of new railway line length is under construction with upcoming phases poised to add a staggering 2,419 km across a dozen planned routes. The expansion project is part of the National Infrastructure Development Plan in tandem with Thailand 4.0 initiatives, which aims to achieve an annual growth rate of about 5 per cent to become a developed country.\n\nThis expansive vision seeks to not only expand the reach of the railway network but also seamlessly interconnect 61 provinces, going beyond the existing 47 provinces connected through intercity rail. These new rail networks have double tracks. A key focus is on an electrified rapid transit system, with plans to extend the existing Red lines. The dark Red line, stretching 185 km from Ayutthaya in the north to Ratchaburi in the southwest, represents a substantial expansion from its current 26 km length. Simultaneously, the light Red line is set to cover 124 km, linking Nakhon Pathom to Chachoengsao in the east-west direction; its current length is 15 km. Besides, about 124.2 km of MRT Line and 191.4 km of Airport Rail Link is under construction.\n\nConcurrently, the government, in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is steering the Second Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan (M-MAP2) for the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Proposals include 22 km of BTS Skytrain, 18 km of MRT Line, and a 50 km BMA Line. While Bangkok currently stands as the sole city boasting an urban rail transit system, extensive plans are under way to replicate this success in cities such as Phuket, Phitsanulok, Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen and Nakhon Ratchasima to enhance regional connectivity and accessibility. In a significant leap forward,Thailand is venturing into the realm of high speed rail, a first for the nation. The project, spanning 2,656 km across four lines (northern, eastern, north-eastern and southern), is divided into three phases – urgent, medium and long term. Phase 1 of the project is being carried out under the Singapore-Kunming Rail Link (SKRL) Project.\n\nAs part of the broader modernisation push, SRT is diligently procuring state-of-the-art locomotives and coaches to replace outdated models. These are not only integral to supporting the rapid movement of goods but also promise a more efficient and comfortable passenger experience, addressing concerns that have marred the sector in recent years. SRT is also championing the “EV on Train Project,” by promoting the use of locally manufactured battery-electric locomotives, aligning with Thailand’s commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions. Moreover, SRT is working to upgrade its signalling system and adopt the European Train Control System, a standard that boosts capacity and increases the reliability of rail networks.\n\nFuture growth and outlook\n\nThailand Railways is currently in a rapid expansion phase, with numerous ongoing projects and significant future expansions in the pipeline. The goal is to emerge as the largest rail network in Southeast Asia by 2027, covering an extensive distance of 5,162 km. As per industry projections, freight transportation is expected to surge to 46 million annually by the year 2027. In conclusion, Thailand’s ambitious railway expansion and modernisation initiatives signal a transformative era for the nation’s transportation infrastructure. With a focus on connectivity, efficiency and international integration, the railway network is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping transportation as w"
