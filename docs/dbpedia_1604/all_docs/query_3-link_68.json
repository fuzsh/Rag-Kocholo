        "text": "Smart Substation\n\nThe concept of \"standardized design, factory prefabricated, integrated construction” has realized the transformation of substations from “construction” to “procurement” The construction period of substations can be shorten by 50% and occupied land can be reduced by 30%, and the overall investment cost is reduced by about 5%, which can be applied widely in power grid substation, new energy power generation booster station, rail transit traction substations and substations in the industrial and mining fields.\n\nXJ has won CET's COA-SOA Interconnection Link Project in Saudi Arabia\n\nRecently, XJ Electric Corporation has been awarded the Contract of the Supply of DC Control and Protection Equipment for the Project of Construction of New HVDC Converter Stations for COA-SOA Interconnection Link in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd.(CET). The project is a national-level major project under Saudi Arabia’s 2030 Vision and also a VSC-HVDC Transmission project with hybrid bridge topology and the highest voltage level and maximum transmission capacity in the rest of the world except China. This marks a significant breakthrough of XJ Electric Corporation’s realization of \"Going Global\" in the field of UHV power transmission and equipment manufacturing.\n\nview all\n\nXJ Electric Corporation Invited to Deliver a Keynote Report at the 20th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission\n\nFrom July 12 to 15, the 20th IET International Conference on AC and DC Power Transmission (ACDC 2024) was held in Shanghai. Sponsored by IET (Institution of Engineering and Technology), Tsinghua University, Huairou Laboratory and China Electrical Equipment Group Co., Ltd. and organized by XJ Electric Corporation and other organizations, this conference is a grand event to discuss the innovative development of energy and power, as well as a grand event for experts and friends from all walks of life to seek common cooperation, share development and create the future together. The conference focused on the discussion of topics such as basic components, key core equipment and major AC/DC transmission projects for building a new power system. It contributed intelligent solutions to the innovative development of AC/DC transmission technology, built a bridge linking technical exchanges and cooperation for scholars from all walks of life, and effectively promoted international innovation cooperation in the transmission technology field.\n\nview all\n\nElectric-Vehicle Charging System for Electric Buses from the Land Transport Authority（LTA）of Singapore\n\nXJ Electric Corporation has successfully signed the Contract for the Project of Electric-Vehicle Charging System for Electric Buses from the Land Transport Authority（LTA）of Singapore, which is the largest and most technically demanding charging station project in Southeast Asia. The Project Owner is the Land Transport Authority, which plan, design, build and maintain Singapore’s land transport infrastructure and systems. The scope of the work that XJ undertakes under the Project is the supply, commissioning and O&M of three bus depots, including 82 sets of 360kW DC Electric Vehicle Charging Station, and 10 sets of 60kW DC Electric Vehicle Charging Station. Upon completion, the project will be a big push for Singapore’s plan to realize zero net emissions. 360kW DC Electric Vehicle Charging Station 60kW DC Electric Vehicle Charging Station\n\nview all"
