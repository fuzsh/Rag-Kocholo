History

With the Golden Gate and the Highland Gate, the Green Gate spans the Long Market and Long Street, together comprising the Royal Route. The Green Gate was clearly inspired by the Antwerp City Hall.[1] It was built 1568-71 as the formal residence of Poland's monarchs.[2] It is a masterpiece by Regnier (or Reiner van Amsterdam), an Amsterdam architect,[3] and reflects Flemish architectural influence in GdaÅsk. Hans Kramer from Dresden was responsible for the construction plans.

On 11â20 February 1646 the future Queen of Poland, Marie Louise Gonzaga, was entertained here. In the late 18th century the Nature Society was housed here, but soon moved to the Naturalists' House (Research Society House).
