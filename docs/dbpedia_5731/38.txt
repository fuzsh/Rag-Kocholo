The cinematography and editing here are striking. Ayer color codes the bullets' paths so that incoming and outgoing are easily identified, and the interior workings of the cramped tank are given remarkable clarity without the use of explanatory dialogue. The device of the "rookie" character is a little worn, but then this entire movie harkens back to a simpler age, when war movies were made by tough guys; when they feel pain, it really matters.

Though he has a few duds on his resume, writer/director David Ayer is best known as the writer of Training Day and the writer/director of End of Watch, two movies that focus on the detail-rich workday of cops on the street. After a pause for a disappointing action flick, Sabotage, he's back in that same vein with the FURY. And rather than using his small, focused story to heavily underline themes about the horrors of war, Ayer simply follows characters and moments, letting viewers draw their own conclusions.
