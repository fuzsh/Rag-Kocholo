        "text": "Rhaenyra\n\nThe dragonseeds part before Rhaenyra as the sea of courtiers once had for her father, hushed whispers echoing in the gloom of the Dragonmount. For all the times Rhaenyra had come here, there was something otherworldly about the size of the cavern around them - something that made noises echo in a way they shouldn’t. And the gloom hid far more of the cavern than the few torches illuminated.\n\nThe dragonseeds - those that have heeded her call, at least - are a motley bunch. SIlverhaired, but ranging from old men to a few youngsters that were more boys than men. Rhaenyra wondered how many were the sons of Lysene seamen rather than the get of Targaryen Princes. The shining silver hair of Valyria might be rare in Westeros save for those who carried the dragon’s blood, but in Lys or Old Volantis it was as common as brown-haired Andal boys were here.\n\nPerhaps a few might not even know they are merely the seed of a dockside tryst - what whore wouldn’t want her son to think himself the son of a prince when in truth his father could have been any of half a hundred men?\n\nThe scent of ash is heavy in the air as it always is here, but so too is the scent of ale. Perhaps a few of the would-be dragonseeds found the need to banish their cravenness for a time. It might well serve them - dragons could smell fear - but they could smell drink too. One of the Lords of Dragonstone before the Conquest had tried to claim Meraxes when he’d been drunk. And the way Daemon told that particular tale, Meraxes hadn’t even had the decency to kill him on the spot, instead letting him linger on for days until he finally succumbed to his burns.\n\nRhaenyra turns, surveying the sea of men. There are too many. Entirely too many. Perhaps a few of the eldest could be Maegor’s, but Jaehaerys had been faithful to Alysanne for all they had their differences, and all of Jaehaerys’ brothers had died by Maegor’s hand. Perhaps Aemon and Baelon had sown their seed as young men, but not this many. As for Rhaenyra’s own father - perhaps. It is an odd thought that perhaps one of the drunk men might be as much Rhaenyra’s brother as Aegon. That only left Daemon, and for all Rhaenyra’s uncle certainly had the reputation for indulging in the pleasures that princes were afforded, his only dragonseed already dwelt within the castle.\n\nRhaenyra turns to the infinite gloom and hums softly. Perhaps one of the men is a true dragonseed. Perhaps two. As for the others - the penalty for impersonating a prince is death. It is only their due.\n\nThe words of the song are unpracticed - more the task of the dragonkeepers than the dragonlords - but Rhaenyra sings them still, and something stirs far away, beyond the gloom. She smiles. The noises are soft - surprisingly so - but the floor of the cavern, far below them, is the same sand that forms the few beaches Dragonstone has. Men can move silently across it, and dragons - even ones as large as Vermithor - are likewise remarkably quiet.\n\nRhaenyra closes her eyes for a long moment as she continues to sing, her thoughts running through what she is to say. What must be said.\n\nThe collective gasp behind her signals Vermithor’s arrival, and she opens her eyes once more. Vermithor’s enormous head looms out of the gloom, the rest of his bulk still shrouded by darkness. His blazing bronze eyes shine as he regards Rhaenyra coldly, and Rhaenyra thinks of her father’s grandfather.\n\nShe’d met the Old King before he’d died, but the memories are faint and she more remembers an old man laying in his sickbed than anything else, not the mighty king who’d once threatened to burn Braavos to the ground or who’d ended the Fourth Dornish War in an hour. Had his eyes blazed as Vermithor’s did when he and his sons set upon Prince Morion Martell and his fleet? Rhaenyra thinks that they must have. There is something, when one rides a dragon. Something that can’t quite be put into words.\n\nHer father had once told her that some portion of a rider lived on in their dragon. That it was the piece of Visenya which dwelt within Vhagar that had rendered her mount so ornery. That Aemon’s fierceness lived in Caraxes. What piece of the Old King would still live on in Vermithor, then? His might, perhaps? Or his wisdom. But looking into the shining eyes of the great dragon that looms over her, Rhaenyra sees not wisdom, but fury. Not the hot-tempered fury of the Baratheons, rather the icy fury that Ser Braxton Beesbury had faced when he’d chosen trial by combat. The King had been nigh on fifty while the fiery young knight had been twenty. Still, as the maesters told it there had been no contest. The King had taken every blow with his shield until the knight tired, then cut him limb from limb with Blackfyre as Princess Saera looked on.\n\nPerhaps it would have been wiser to begin with Silverwing - Queen Alysanne had loved her daughter to the end while Jaehaerys had called her a whore - but Rhaenyra needed to face Vhagar. Vermithor could do that alone. Silverwing could not.\n\nYet the way Daemon told it, Saera’s whoring of herself had not been what incensed the Old King so. Rather, it had been her insistence that she would wed all her suitors, taking three husbands at once as Maegor the Cruel had taken his Black Brides, forgetting what her father had endured at Maegor’s hands as a boy. Once Jaehaerys had been a third son, but Maegor and Balerion had smote Aegon Uncrowned above the God’s Eye. And even that had been a mercy compared to the face of Viserys, tortured until none could recognize him and then left to rot in hopes Dowager Queen Alyssa would come to claim his body. No, Saera’s whorish ways would have sent her to the Faith for a few years and then she would have been married off. It was the comparison to Maegor that had raised Jaehaerys’ true fury.\n\nStill, perhaps that piece of Jaehaerys that lived within Vermithor - if one did - would see the bastards of his sons and grandsons and scorn them. He’d certainly scorn the drunks and the sons of seamen. But surely one would catch his interest.\n\nRhaenyra holds her hand out, the word echoing through the chamber.\n\n“Serve.”\n\nVermithor gives a low sound at that, but allows Rhaenyra to touch his snout. Even through the hardened scales of a dragon that had seen nearly a century, his fire warms her skin.\n\nHe stills, and Rhaenyra turns, gazing upon the dragonseeds.\n\nThere are no dragonkeepers to sing the songs or speak the words, only guards to bar the gate.\n\n“Behold these worthy dragonseeds of House Targaryen.” There is no recognition on any of the dragonseeds’ faces. They have no High Valyrian, but that could come with time. And Rhaenyra’s usurper brother had somehow taught his dragon the common tongue, though Rhaenyra suspects the Old King’s mount will be entirely less likely to be so open. But Valyrian can be taught. As can the songs, though when the dragonkeepers see Rhaenyra’s triumph they will return to her.\n\nJace doesn’t approve, even with Luke gone, but his motivations are purely selfish. He thinks of the day he will be king, not understanding that if Rhaenyra is not queen then his life is forfeit. He will be equal to the task when the time comes.\n\nRhaenys will see the pragmatism of it all - she’d escaped Rook’s Rest, but had perhaps the healthiest understanding of all of them of Vhagar’s might and Aemond’s bloodlust. Still, Rhaenyra imagines her good mother’s raised eyebrow, the one that could always cow the mighty Sea Snake in a way that nothing else ever could. But that eyebrow and the doubt it sowed was on Driftmark. Rhaenys and Meleys might have escaped Vhagar with their lives, but they hadn’t been entirely unscathed.\n\nAs for Daemon - Rhaenyra’s husband would have his thoughts on the matter, though Rhaenyra isn’t sure she cares just now. She’d given leave for him to take Harrenhal, not to reside there. Was he to be another usurper like her treasonous brother? Her ravens had been unanswered. Her husband had his pragmatism, but he would also see the danger in it. Of course there was danger in it. Rhaenyra had never denied that. Not to Jace, not to anyone. But there was danger too in not sowing the seeds.\n\nRhaenyra’s eyes flick over the dragonseeds once more. Would Daemon recognize any of them as his own? There were a few young enough that perhaps it was possible.\n\nAnd then there was Daenys, freshly arrived from flying the width of the Narrow Sea four times in two days. The maps made Pentos look ever-so-close, but flight over the sea could be deceptively long if the winds were up, and longer still with squirming children for passengers. It had been a thankless errand Rhaenyra had sent her husband’s only claimed bastard on, but the girl had done it without complaint. Flying first to Pentos and securing the hospitality of the magister that Daemon seemed fond of, that her young children might remain there for the rest of the war such as it was. That had been all Rhaenyra had asked of her, but Daenys had bundled all the children onto Clouddancer’s back and she’d flown the Narrow Sea again to bring them there despite the ship Rhaenyra had ordered prepared. It was too dangerous, Daenys had said. The Usurper had made common cause with the Triarchy.\n\nAnother reason for Rhaenyra to curse her absent husband. And perhaps the reason he seemed to prefer a war far from the sea.\n\nStill, what would she think? Daemon had extracted a boon from Viserys to see that Daenys had been given a dragon’s egg for her cradle, and as much as Rhaenyra remember how jealous she’d been of the clear evidence her uncle desired another, Alicent’s fury when Daenys’ egg had hatched into twin dragons while Aemond and Helaena’s eggs both grew cold had given her no small measure of pleasure.\n\nThe first of the dragonseeds - an older man, but a brave one - took a tentative few steps forward, holding out his hand to Vermithor. His trembling, terrified hand. Daemon said dragons could smell fear, but when it was this bad Rhaenyra suspected they could also see it.\n\n“Serve.” The man’s accent is atrocious, but he tries to pronounce the same word Rhaenyra had.\n\nRhaenyra had thought to remove herself to a balcony for exactly this reason before the seeds made their attempts, but it was too late for that now.\n\nThe expressions on the dragonseed’s faces tell Rhaenyra everything she needs to know as they contort from merely fearful to terrified for their very lives. Had they thought that any who failed would simply sail back to the city with the next tide?\n\nThe distinctive wave of heat is the first thing Rhaenyra notices, and a moment later the torrent of fire rains down on the unfortunate dragonseed. Or perhaps that one had been the son of a sailor. But the Old King’s dragon doesn’t stop there, flames pouring from his maw as men scream and burn and die. A scarce few attempt to flee, but the guards block their way until Vermithor bathes the great doors in flame, killing guardsmen and dragonseeds alike.\n\nHow long had it been since it all began? A moment, surely, but as Rhaenyra’s gaze flits around, all she sees are ashen bodies and bits of flame.\n\nThere are still two dragonseeds left, though Vermithor dispatches both soon enough. First comes a man who seems to have realized there is no way out - that he will become a dragonlord or perish trying. He is naught but ash when Vermithor turns his attention to the pathetic crying man who had hoped to go unnoticed in the corner. A fool, through and through.\n\nThe heat bathes the room once more, and Rhaenyra closes her eyes. There is some deep euphoria to it all, though her rational mind is displeased. It doesn’t matter, not now.\n\nRhaenyra isn’t sure why, but she kneels when she turns back to Vermithor.\n\nThe tradition to name dragons after the gods of Old Valyria had started even before the Doom, but Rhaenyra had paid little mind to it as she named her own dear Syrax, or even as she’d guided Jace, Luke, and Joff to name their own mounts. But now, with the ash in the air brushing across her skin and the blazing eyes firmly fixed upon her, she understands. Dragons are more gods than men, are they not?\n\nNo sound heralds Silverwing’s approach, but Vermithor shifts to allow his mate to perch beside him, and another dragon head looms out of the gloom. If Vermithor’s eyes blazed with the Old King’s fury, then Silverwing’s twinkled. Rhaenyra had been born before the death of the Good Queen, but only by a little and she did not remember her father’s grandmother.\n\nDaemon had not been fond of the woman, but there is something gentle and mischievous in Silverwing’s sparkling eyes that Rhaenyra cannot help but smile at.\n\nShe reaches out her arm once more, the motion instinctive.\n\n“Serve.”\n\nSilverwing moves with a deceptive grace, avoiding Rhaenyra’s arm to gently nudge Rheanrya herself, as if urging her back to her feet.\n\nThey made quite the pair, the two dragons before her, and even with the still-burning remnants of cloth and men providing extra illumination the chamber was so very dim.\n\nPerhaps Rhaenyra had gone about this all wrong. She’d been chosen. Not by A Great Council, but by the King himself. She was to be Queen, and Viserys had never faltered. Not when she’d spurned the suitors or followed Daemon to the pleasure house or when the viper that was Alicent Hightower had proclaimed her boys bastards. Not even when she’d demanded her own half-brother - a bleeding boy of ten, and as much kin to her as some of the dead dragonseeds, no doubt - be sharply questioned. Never.\n\nNo man ever had more than one dragon - every Targaryen child knew as much. Even Daenys with her twin dragons only ever mounted Clouddancer. It was known. A truth like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.\n\nRhaenyra starts down the long stone stairs that will take her to the sandy bottom of the cavern, the blazing and twinkling eyes of Vermithor and Silverwing still on her.\n\nNo man may claim a second dragon, even if the first one should die. But Rhaenyra was no man.\n\nThe two dragons are more shadows than clear silhouettes when Rhaenyra looks up as she reaches the bottom of the steps.\n\n“Follow.” She doesn’t turn back or even hone her ears to the soft sounds dragons make on the sand, simply making her way to the mouth of the great cavern, walking to the distant sunlight. There was much to be done.\n\nShe finds herself humming and then softly singing Daemon’s dragonsong as she muses on it all. Vermithor and Silverwing have largely slept since the deaths of the riders, and their endurance will be nothing compared to Meleys or Clouddancer. They will need to fly as much as they can. To build endurance for when they hunt Vhagar and the traitor Aemond down. For without Vhagar, the Usurper will be lost.\n\nVermithor and Silverwing call out as they emerge into the sunlight, and Rhaenyra gives a soft hum as the warmth caresses her. Valyria had been a place of warmth and fire.\n\nSyrax answers the call of the two great dragons, eyeing Rhaenyra in a strange way. Not accusatory, but not the lazy affection her golden lady’s eyes usually held. She’d understand, and Rhaenyra would apologize to her in time. As much as she treasured her dear lady, sacrifices had to be made.\n\nSilverwing doesn’t so much as wait for Rhaenyra’s command before she takes flight, dancing through the air with a lazy grace that belied Alysanne’s great love of flying. It brought a smile to Rhaenyra’s face as the silver dragon circled higher and higher with ease. Perhaps Vermithor and Silverwing were not so rusty as she’d thought. The dragonkeepers would know, and as much as they hadn’t been fond of Rhaenyra’s plan, they’d be back and on their knees soon enough, groveling at Rhaenyra’s feet the same way Alicent always made such a show of groveling before the statues of her beloved seven who were one.\n\nVermithor’s great roar sounds over the island as Rhaenyra watches Silverwing flit amongst the clouds. Let the Usurper tremble in his sickbed. Let his kinslaying brother shake in his boots. Let the viper queen tremble fear what was to come.\n\nRhaenyra was chosen by Viserys to be Queen, but also by Vermithor and his mate for something more. And she would not be denied.\n\nAemond\n\nThe sound of a dragon brings Aemond’s mind back to the present in an instant. He’d been trying to puzzle out his uncle’s intentions as his small council droned on and on.\n\nThe roars of the dragons that reside in King’s Landing are familiar - Vhagar’s is booming while Dreamfyre’s is musical and Sunfyre’s had been grating. Shyrkos and Morgul were too small to be recognizable. But as much as Aemond is tense, he knows the roars of the his uncle’s Caraxes and Lady Velaryon’s Meleys and even his cunt sister’s spoiled Syrax. And this is none of them either. Neither is it the bastard’s Vermax or even the late Ser Laenor’s Seasmoke, though as Aemond’s eyes find the dragon in the sky for an instant he does think it is the dragon of Rhaenyra’s first husband.\n\nBut despite how the empty sky can make sizes so deceptive, this dragon is much too large. Not Seasmoke. Though it is a similar color, if more silver than gray. Certainly not Seamoke, then. And not Gray Ghost. No, the only silver dragon was Silverwing, riderless since the death of Queen Alysanne. Had Rhaenyra finally found a dragon willing to take Daemon’s dragonless daughter? Rhaena had still be carrying around a pink egg streaked with pearl the last time Aemond had seen her.\n\nBut he doesn’t have time to consider such things. Whoever the rider is, they are foolish to come and he would be a fool to pass up what is such a glorious opportunity. Lady Velaryon might have escaped him due to the fool Aegon, but Aegon certainly won’t be getting in his way now. Or ever, if the Grand Maester was to be believed.\n\nThe ride to Vhagar is entirely too long. Aemond’s father had said the old she-dragon had outgrown the dragonpit, but that wasn’t entirely true. Balerion himself had laired there for the last decades of his life. The pit was plenty big. In truth the issue had two parts. The first was that the smallfolk had built houses entirely too close to the pit - so much so that the landing space just outside the pit was very limited. And while younger dragons could do a more vertical landing straight into the pit with ease, Vhagar needed a more gradual approach. Aemond had already ordered the city watch to clear that particular issue. The second problem was Vhagar herself. The dragon had seldom dwelt in the pit throughout her long life as by chance her riders tended to mostly be creatures of Dragonstone. So Aemond’s great dragon had never grown used to the pit in the first place, and as much as Aemond didn’t like to admit it, Vhagar was not a dragon that would do her rider’s bidding without question. She did as she pleased. His commands were more suggestions that she usually humored.\n\nThe old she-dragon of Queen Visenya is awake and ready to take off before Aemond even makes it all the way to the saddle at her shoulder, eyes already fixed on the silver dragon as she flies lazily over the city. What fool was it that the bitch queen had sent against him? There likely wouldn't be enough left of the man to tell, but Aemond dearly wanted to know for his own curiosity if nothing else. Rhaena? As much as she was a girl, Aemond’s uncle’s progeny were not usually so stupid.\n\n“Fly.”\n\nVhagar is tensing her muscles and launching them into the air a moment later, and only then does the silver dragon turn back, heading on a straight course over the bay. Of course the craven who flew upon Silverwing’s back would flee as Lady Velaryon had. But it was a long way to Dragonstone, and such flamboyant flying tended to tire out man and beast. Vhagar and Aemond would catch Silverwing and her fool long before then.\n\nBut the gap between them holds firm even as Aemond nudges Vhagar, urging her to fly faster. Her blood is up the same way his own is, yet Silverwing proves infuriatingly out of reach.\n\nAemond scans the horizon, looking for any of the rocky outcrops that passed for navigational points. By direction, they were headed for Dragonstone, but he wasn’t sure anymore. Vhagar was not the sort of dragon that would let Aemond ride her for hours and hours on end, and so as much as he was loathed to admit it, when it came to navigation he had to be far more careful than Lady Velaryon or his princely uncle, or even his bitch sister and her bastards. Not that it had saved little Luke. In high winds or storms the larger dragon would always triumph, and Aemond’s was the largest in the world.\n\nThe island of Dragonstone does appear on the horizon, but it grows so very slowly and Aemond’s mind will not be quiet. He and Cole had set their trap at Rook’s Rest. It had been a good trap, one that Aemond had been proud of. One he’d been hoping his uncle would fall into. Because if his uncle fell there was little the bitch could do. Her husband was her strength. So he’d been disappointed when Lady Velaryon had been the one to come, but still a dragon was a dragon.\n\nThen Aegon had arrived and ruined everything. Aemond’s idiot of a king and brother had managed to get his own dragon badly mauled by Meleys before Aemond himself had even joined the fray, and even when they had, it had gone from bad to worse. Aemond had ordered Vhagar to blast the red dragon from the sky, but Lady Velaryon must have seen it coming and Meleys had dragged Sunfyre in front of the blast. Aemond had been expecting Aegon to be singed based on how close the dragons had been, but Sunfyre and Aegon had taken the full force of Vhagar’s wrath, falling from the sky as Meleys made a break for it over the waters of the bay. And Aemond hadn’t followed. Lady Velaryon’s dragon was fast in a way he envied, and he’d never have caught her save for an ambush. The ambush that Aegon had ruined.\n\nRook’s Rest was still a victory as they’d taken the castle, but such a hollow one. And as much as Aemond knew what had happened in the sky - that it was Lady Velaryon who was in truth responsible for Aegon’s burns - the way Cole looked at Aemond bespoke a sort of fearful doubt that implied something else entirely had happened.\n\nWas this too a trap? Did Daemon Targaryen wait, circling over Dragonstone? Had Lady Velaryon joined him? What of Rhaenyra’s eldest bastard? Or even Daemon’s bastard?\n\nLord Larys still insisted that Daemon was at Harrenhal, but dragons were oft more swift even than ravens.\n\nAemond scans the sky, looking for red, his hands gripping Vhagar’s saddle differently, ready to turn back at a moment’s notice. He would not have the same advantage of speed that Lady Velaryon had as she fled, and so he could not afford to fall into a trap. But Silverwing’s idiot rider - whoever they may be - is so tempting a prize, and the sky seems empty.\n\nThe roar that echoes through Aemond’s bones can only be that of Vermithor. Had Rhaenyra found a second rider too? Ice flows through his veins as his eyes search the sky even while Vhagar answers with a great roar of her own. Silverwing is looping around the island with a lazy grace, and there are a pair of dragons much higher overhead. Daenys, perhaps. There had been no reports of any sightings of Aemond’s bastard cousin since that all had begun.\n\n“Flee, Vhagar.” They’re outnumbered, and while the bitch of Dragonstone can afford to lose Silverwing or Vermithor if Vhagar is brought down, Aemond does not have the luxury of dragons’ lives to spend.\n\nBut Vhagar doesn’t begin to turn, instead giving another great roar.\n\n“FLEE.” Aemond shouts, pulling on the saddle as hard as he can. It doesn’t really work with a dragon the size of Vhagar - the dragonkeepers had more taught it to the whore’s bastards as their dragons were such tiny things.\n\nThe dragon of Queen Visenya does turn at last, but instead of a clear sky before them there is Silverwing, looking rather larger than she had when Aemond and Vhagar had pursued her over the bay. Vermithor gives another roar behind them, and Aemond glances back to see the great bronze dragon taking flight. And surely the bitch would be here too as well. Somewhere. Or perhaps she amused herself by watching from the battlements.\n\nPart of Aemond thinks to go right at Silverwing, but as much as Vhagar was more than a match for the silver dragon, Vermithor would fall on them before they could disentangle themselves, and the same is true if they go straight for Vermithor. Aemond glances over his shoulder to see the bronze dragon approaching more swiftly than he would have thought.\n\n“Turn.” Vhagar does turn, flying between Silverwing and Vermithor, her head swinging to and fro, snapping at both of them as they each grew closer for a moment before retreating.\n\nThere is the noise of a smaller dragon, but Aemond can only spare a tiny glance up and he is soon blinded by the sun overhead. If his uncle is there, then that will be a problem for the Aemond that will exist in five minutes.\n\nVhagar turns again with Silverwing and Vermithor as the two dragons push at them, in a sense. Herding them. Vermithor comes closer as they turn yet again, slowly climbing, and unleashes a great blast of fire. It falls short, but Vhagar responds in kind, snarling at Vermithor as she does, and Silverwing takes the opportunity to send yet another blast of fire straight at them. Vhagar senses it enough to dive a little, and Aemond is grateful for it - if she hadn’t he would have met the same fate as Aegon.\n\nThe standoff continues as Vermithor and Silverwing fly with them - close enough to exchange great bursts of fire, but far enough that Vhagar’s gigantic teeth and claws are useless. And always retreating when Vhagar turns to make a run at one of them, only for the other to force Vhagar closer to the ground.\n\nHow are they to escape? Aemond isn’t sure exactly when his line of thinking changed, but it certainly had. Battle is longer on his mind, and the fog of bloodlust has been lifted at least from him. They need to leave before Vermithor and Silverwing force them to land, or worse, force Vhagar into the sea. Because if they continue like this that is what will happen.\n\n“Up!” Aemond shouts, and Vhagar obeys, gaining altitude.\n\nTechnically speaking, Aemond sees the shadow on Vhagar’s back a moment before the dragon’s claws close around him, plucking him from his seat, but he has no time to secure himself or to dodge, and instead flails helplessly against the talons even as Vermithor and Silverwing are moving in again against Vhagar. His great lady does see him, but she’s soon sending fire toward Vermithor as Aemond himself is dragged higher and higher, away from the titanic dragons.\n\nAemond beats at the dragon’s cream-colored claws with his fist to no avail as the dragons below trade great bursts of fire. The sight reminds Aemond altogether too much of a pack of hounds and a cornered bear, though the size difference is not nearly as great. Vermithor is every bit as bulky as Vhagar, though he is still a touch smaller. Silverwing meanwhile is a much slimmer dragon - one that rather reminds Aemond of Helaena’s Dreamfyre - but just as long as Vermithor and plenty large enough to trouble Vhagar all on her own.\n\nAemond gives another punch to the cream-colored claw that holds him. It won’t help - even if Clouddancer were to drop him, they are too high now and even if Vhagar somehow caught him the fall would be deadly. But he has to do something.\n\n“Flee!” Aemond shouts, though he doubts Vhagar can hear him. The three large dragons circle again before Silverwings shifts closer to Vermithor, offering a gap between them. Vhagar gives one last roar, but takes the gap, heading off into the distance, and Aemond wonders if she will circle back for him. His lady is loyal, but will she brave another fight with Vermithor and Silverwing for him? And, a small part of his mind adds, that’s assuming the bitch of Dragonstone lets him live that long. Which seems unlikely given that he’d killed her precious bastard.\n\nClouddancer descends gracefully, and Aemond catches Shadowdancer flying behind as they do. Part of him thinks it would have been better if the bitch’s dragon had been the one to pluck him from Vhagar’s back - Syrax would be as wrathful as her rider and he would have died instantly. But instead it had been Daenys, and his bastard cousin was ever the show-off when it came to such things. Well, that was her reputation. Aemond had met Daemon Targaryen’s bastard daughter exactly once.\n\nClouddancer probably lands gracefully too, but Aemond wouldn’t know. He only gets half a face full of sand, though soon enough he’s looking at black riding boots.\n\n“Cousin. What a way to meet again.” Daenys’ Valyrian is perfect and almost singing.\n\nAemond tries to spit out the sand that had found its way into his mouth. He tries to move, to do anything, but Clouddancer is a surprisingly large dragon for being from Daenys’ cradle egg and the claws pinning him into the sand remain unyielding.\n\n“I don’t suppose you have any last words?” Aemond glares at his bastard cousin, imagining his uncle in her place. It’s an easy enough comparison to make. She moves like him, speaks like him, and her face is his.\n\n“I guess not.” She gives a soft snort. “Leave the face. I like him pretty.”\n\nBoth dragons’ teeth and claws are tearing at Aemond a moment later.\n\nAemond’s blood splatters Daenys as the dragons tear him apart, splashing over her riding leathers, onto her face, and into her hair. Clouddancer and Shadowdancer squabble over the still-bloody pieces - once that’s done they’ll move onto cooking him - but Daenys instead paces over to where Prince Aemond’s head had landed, a good few steps away from the dragons.\n\nThe little knife whose purpose is to cut the leather straps that hold a rider to their dragon in a moment of urgency easily severs the leather band that holds Aemond’s eyepatch, revealing the sapphire beneath.\n\nDaenys picks up the head, one hand on each cheek. It’s heavy, surprisingly so, and more blood drips over her hands.\n\n“You know, cousin, I heard once that the head lives on for a minute after it is removed from the body. So maybe you’ll even hear me.” She strokes his cheek.\n\n“At that dinner - the one your father forced on us all - I thought you so very handsome. I nearly asked my father to marry me to you. What wasn’t to be wanted? A dragonlord, and of all Lady Cunttower’s brats, you were most properly Valyrian. Heavens, I thought to try and find you after the meal. To say that we should run away to the east. It’s not like we were needed. Who would miss a second son and a bastard? We could have been worshiped as living gods, and there would have been no need for all of this.” She gives an exhale. “But then you went and called the boys strongs and your mousy mother kept you all to herself for the night. Perhaps it’s the thought of a lovesick girl, but it was a nice dream.”\n\nShe kissed his still-warm lips, tasting blood. It was heady and intoxicating.\n\n“And I always thought you looked so much more handsome like this.” Her hand stroked Aemond’s cheek near his sapphire eye.\n\n“But best not to keep the Queen waiting.” Daenys smiles, shifting her grip so one hand was twined in Aemond’s bloody white-blonde tresses. She gave the dragons - done cooking their meal and now stripping the bones that had once been Aemond Targaryen of any flesh - a brief glance and noticed a faint glint on the sand between them. Taking cautious steps so as not to disturb them, she made her way to the object. It was a sheathed dagger, and by the weight alone it had to be Valyrian steel.\n\nDaenys gave the dragons one last look before starting down the beach, towards Vermithor and Silverwing. The Queen would be with them, as would Syrax.\n\nRhaenyra\n\nSilverwing and Vermithor landed on either side of where Rhaenyra stood with her golden lady, and it was now that Syrax’s heritage was clear as day. Her scales might be more golden yellow than Vermithor’s bronze or Silverwing’s silver-gray, but her horns were the same as Silverwing’s while her head had the same shape as Vermithor’s.\n\nFor all Silverwing had laid a good many eggs, Syrax alone had hatched. Most of the young dragons were of Dreamfyre and Quicksilver’s get. They had not been mated for long, but still Dreamfyre continued to lay eggs that could only have been sired by him.\n\nThe dragons give gentle songs, courtship songs almost, and Rhaenyra wishes that Daemon were here. Not so much for herself - there are words she must have with Daemon as his Queen, not his wife, but for Syrax. Her golden lady was so very fond of Caraxes.\n\nShe’d thought a few times that she might mount Syrax and join the large dragons, but decided against it in the end. Syrax was too large to pluck Aemond from his seat as Daenys and Clouddancer had done, but far too small to stand against Vhagar. She was the Queen, and Silverwing and Vermithor were hers too. Sometimes the hardest lesson to learn was when it was best to do nothing. But in this, Rhaenyra had been correct.\n\nDaenys approaches soon enough, trudging down the beach, no Aemond in sight. Had Clouddancer picked him up a little too roughly and squashed him like an egg? Would the fishermen be pulling in pieces of the one-eyed kinslayer just as they’d found Arrax’s wing?\n\nBut as Daenys gets closer, Rhaenyra can see there is something in her hand. Something with silver hair. And Daenys herself is rather covered in what can only be blood.\n\nFor a long time Rhaenyra hadn’t been quite sure what to make of Daemon’s bastard. The girl seemed like a piece of the Daemon who had come before he’d been Rhaenrya’s. The man who was well known throughout the Street of Silk, and the one who was every bit the Rogue Otto Hightower feared.\n\nNow Daemon was more mellow, more fatherly. Rather like Rhaenyra’s own father in a way. Still unmistakably Daemon, but not the type of man Otto Hightower would call a demon any longer.\n\nRhaenyra had been jealous, once. She’d been Crown Princess, a hundred suitors begging for her hand, but she’d been jealous of the small child in Daemon’s arms. The one who had so clearly had Daemon’s affection in a way it seemed Rheanyra never would.\n\nPerhaps it had been for the best that Daemon had been banished, for it had not been until they finally did wed that Rhaenyra had the proper intuition to understand what would have come if she had wed Daemon as her first husband, as much as they had both wished for it.\n\nAs cruel as Alicent had been to her for the crime of holding a place in her own father’s heart, she would have done the same to Daenys, furious at the prospect of sharing Daemon with anyone. Dragons could be such jealous and possessive creatures. The thought - of becoming like Alicent - had frightened her more than anything, even more than childbed. She’d sworn from then on she’d treat Daemon’s daughters as her own, and Baela and Rhaena had taken to her quickly while Daenys still remained more distant.\n\nThe girl gives as much a curtsey as one can in riding leathers with both hands full.\n\n“Your Grace. Lucerys is avenged.” Daenys holds up the still-dripping head by its bloodstained hair, and Rhaenyra cannot help but smile as she gently touches Aemond’s cheek before nodding to Daenys that she could drop the head. It landed and rolled a few paces on the sand. Rhaenyra would have liked to hand it off to a dragonkeeper, but they still needed to get on their knees and give a proper apology for doubting her as they had. The dragonseeds they’d so hated were only a distant memory, after all.\n\nDaenys’ other hand holds Viserys' dagger, but Rhaenyra drops it alongside the head. The prophecy lived now in her, not in a blade.\n\nWhich only leaves Daenys herself, covered in blood that can only be Aemond’s. Rhaenyra takes Daemon’s bastard’s hands and pulls the girl closer. Daemon had the gall to flee from her, to ignore her ravens. Not the ravens of his wife, the ravens of his queen. Perhaps she ought to take a hostage from him as lords did with unruly bannermen. Though hostage felt like entirely the wrong word for it. Ward, perhaps. Even that seemed wrong. It was more that Daenys would cease to be her step-daughter and become her daughter in truth.\n\nShe lent forward, pressing a kiss to Daenys’ brow. It tasted of Aemond’s salty blood and the smoke of dragonfire.\n\n“I’m going to legitimize you.”\n\nThe girl looks confused.\n\n“As Prince Daemon’s, Your Grace?”\n\nRhaenyra waves her hand.\n\n“As my daughter.”\n\nDaenys still looks confused, but she will understand Rhaenyra’s meaning in time.\n\n“Now come. The stink of dragon and battle is on us both.” The scent is heady, but it suited Daemon better than Rhaenyra or Daenys.\n\nAnd there were plans to be made. Plans that ought not to stink of bloodlust. The war was won. But there was still so much to do. Viserys had cleaved far too close to the Andals. Rhaenyra was Chosen. She would remake the Seven Kingdoms in her image instead of being corrupted in theirs as so many Targaryens had been."
