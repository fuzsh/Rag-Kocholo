        "text": "According to the Seafarer’s Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code (STCW), a crucial competence for any officer in charge of a navigational watch concerns the correct use of IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) as well as a more general use of English in written and oral form. Straightforward as this may seem in principle, the reality of performing an officer’s duties while working with an international and multilingual crew however often entails ‘navigating’ the hazards of mutual incomprehension. For, even if mastery of SMCP already significantly reduces the inherent risks of maritime misunderstanding, matters such as pronunciation and prosody remain sufficiently important to warrant complementary communicative competences. The matter moreover becomes especially pressing in situations not covered by IMO-approved phrasing, yet which in practice may prove just as hazardous. Designed to address precisely these very issues, the INTERMAR project – a consortium of communication specialists based at maritime and naval academies across Europe – accordingly proposes the notion of intercomprehension to demonstrate the necessity of recognizing the ‘intercultural’ aspects of communication alongside its purely linguistic ones. Indeed, by acknowledging that English (maritime and otherwise) is spoken in a wide range of different accents by speakers of extremely mixed abilities, our paper will posit that a methodological focus on strategies of signification across manifold signifying systems and cultural frameworks allows us to present intercomprehension as a heuristic concept, and thus contribute to better-targeted teaching tools and learning outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to introduce a new methodology in the Maritime English (ME) teaching based on an incorporation of English fiction literature into the Maritime English curricula and classes. As the English language is “lingua franca” of Maritime field it is very important for ME teachers to engage the students in the learning process, to make it as interesting and as efficient as possible for them in order to get the best possible results. This article will focus on a particular teaching perspective where fiction work can be used as a source material for ME courses and how this material can have a positive effect on students’ motivation to learn English. Thus, the objective of this paper is to offer new methodology which includes incorporating pieces of English fiction literature on maritime themes in ME classes. In order to implement this it is very important to choose the adequate pieces of literature for this purpose, find the most efficient extracts containing a lot of maritime terms which will help the future seafarers to have some ideas about their future profession. In our opinion, this approach will engage students in the learning process and they can maximally benefit from it. Besides, we think that this could be a good way to interest young generation in fiction literature and learning of English at the same time. ME teachers can incorporate fiction literature into their language programs, and exploit these reading passages through a combination of strategies drawn from literature lessons and ME methodology. In our opinion, this choice will allow both to attain the goals of ME courses and to initiate students into reading literature in foreign language.\n\nIn today’s time of economic constraints, class hours are being cut in many MET institutions and academic staff is required to bring students to at least the same results as they used to, but in fewer hours of class. Despite these facts, we have chosen to spend some class time in individual oral examination of officers of the watch, because we felt that if the students’ capacity to actually “do the job” was never assessed in simulated communications, their certification would have no value. The solution we proposed relies on the principles of MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) to “flip” the classroom, moving lessons and the transmissive part of the training out of the classroom, so that more practice time was made available in class. This article will first describe the organization of the course, and then explain how (and with which digital tools) it was implemented. A final part will try to assess the efficiency of the new course in comparison with its previous form.\n\nProficiency in Maritime English sits on a substantial lexical basis. Indeed before a mariner can effectively communicate in maritime English, he/she needs to learn (i.e. memorize) a significant number of new words, some of which are uncommon even to the native speaker. Ship parts, standard position indicators, or VHF pro-words, for example, make up a whole new vocabulary, which must be learnt before being able to re-use it in sentences compliant with the very specific SMCP grammar. This paper is two-fold. The first part will present a collection of rapid-learning tools which learners can use to facilitate the memorization of lexical items. These are digital tools, designed to ease learning by enabling drilling, and all stem from the concept of flashcards. In the second part of this article, we have curated a list of e-learning suites and/or authoring tools. These are programs that allow for the easy creation of automated and/or interactive multimedia learning documents, particularly in a context of blended learning. Finally, a third part will list utility programs that all teachers who wish to implement blended learning should know.

Here lies a \"needs\" related effective Maritime English curriculum and effective pedagogical techniques towards producing outstanding professional seafarers culturally competent in communication and negotiation. The safety of life and ship at sea essentially lies on the seafarers\" skillful communication in Maritime English. Behind this promising global standpoint, this paper strives to cater to a pragmatically effective Maritime English for making global skilled maritime professionals. To this end, this paper uses secondary and primary sources of information. The analytical result shows that in teaching, IMO Standard Marine Communication Phraseology & terminology, linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects of language should be the part of Maritime ESP course curriculum and teachers\" professional training is needed.\n\nThe paper aimed to look at the perceptions of teachers and students about the teaching and learning of Maritime English in the Philippines. The study involved selected HEIs offering maritime education and training in the country. Descriptive survey method was used in the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools such as percentage, mean weight and standard deviation. Findings reveal that the teachers consider Maritime English as a course that focuses on the improvement of student's proficiency in English as required by the STCW 1995 Code and the 2010 Manila Amendments. Maritime English provides students wide-ranging opportunities to practice communication in English for maritime and general purposes. The students generally manifested a positive attitude towards learning Maritime English. They consider learning Maritime English an important goal which could help them in the future since their job would require communicating to people of different nationalities and English is a language that they can understand. As future seafarers, maritime students strongly agree that it is a mark of respect to foreign crewmen and passengers to learn their language, particularly English as a universal language.\n\nThis paper reports on the development of the EU funded Leonardo project called MarTEL. MarTEL concerns the development of a novel set of Maritime English Language Standards. MarTEL is designed to test mariner’s Maritime English through a series of online tests designed to cater for all types and ranks of seafarers. A number of major piloting exercises have been carried out with the target groups, viz., cadets, officers and senior officers within the MarTEL partnership. The paper also outlines the reason for MarTEL and reports on one of the methods used to evaluate its value to the target groups. The subject of validity has been the core of MarTEL development activities for any given test. Validity is the appropriateness of a given test or any of its component parts as a measure of what it is expected to measure. A test is said to be valid to the extent that it measures what it is supposed to measure. Furthermore, test developers,not only have to ensure that the material included in ...\n\nLifelong learning (LLL) is a very important phenomenon in the modern world for people occupied in different fields after being educated by different specialties. It is especially significant for graduates of Maritime institutions, future seafarers, due to specifics of this field as specialists of Maritime field need to constantly update their knowledge and qualifications. After receiving education and formal learning in MET institutions they have a good basis for further effective non-formal and informal learning in the field. The aim of the article is to consider good knowledge of English as a means for lifelong learning process in MET as it is the language of information in the modern world and the language of vast majority of internet resources. In addition, English is an official international language of maritime field recognized by International Maritime Organization. Therefore, good knowledge of both General and Maritime English would facilitate process of acquisition of new information for seafarers and could motivate specialists of maritime field for lifelong learning. Lifelong learning implies non-formal and informal learning; both of them are selfmotivated and are often conditioned by life circumstances. Knowledge of English and selfmotivation could give tremendous opportunities to those interested in their specialty in order to enhance information about the field, profound knowledge of specialization, borrow experience of other countries and integrate innovations of the field. Lifelong learning approach in Maritime Education and Training can be considered as mandatory and using such approach to Maritime English, that implies constant enriching of Maritime English vocabulary and improving language skills, is a guarantee of successful career for seafarers in contemporary maritime world. Application of lifelong learning is significantly important in Maritime Education and Training due to the following factors: technological progress, constant updating of IMO documents and Conventions, necessity to take training courses and revalidate certificates, familiarization with technological innovations, demands of labour market. The influence of these factors on lifelong learning process of specialists of maritime field will also be discussed in the article."
