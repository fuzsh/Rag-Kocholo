Chronic trauma occurs over a longer period of time, and includes racism, bullying and neglect. Finally, vicarious trauma is the trauma people can get due to empathising with another personâs trauma and feeling their pain.\n\nPaul also outlines the hypothesis of âmultiple hitâ trauma. This is the idea that after multiple traumas it can became too much for a person to cope with, and even a small trauma can then push a person over the edge. This hypothesis completely disproves the idea that what doesnât kill us makes us stronger.\n\nListen to the full episode here -\n\nSpotify- https://g2ul0.app.link/CtWAMbYKTLb\n\nApple -Â Â https://g2ul0.app.link/TIVYc9ZjNu\n\nWatch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos\n\nPaul: https://drpaulconti.com/\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

According to Daniel, it is essential to create a diverse portfolio of assets, such as a strong personal brand or a vibrant company culture, because income naturally follows assets. Daniel also discusses the importance of investing your disposable income in personal development, such as taking courses to enhance essential skills, as well as in your personal relationships. One of the ways that you can strengthen your connections is by hosting dinner parties or taking successful mentors out for lunch.
