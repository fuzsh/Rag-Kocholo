        "text": "âStation Eleven is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nBreaking Down a Station Eleven Essay Prompt\n\nWe've explored themes, characters, symbols and provided a summary of the text over on our Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down a Station Eleven essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt: 'The distortion of memories can be harmful.' Do you agree?\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing to note about this prompt is that it's a theme-based prompt, focussing specifically on the theme of memory, which plays a significant role throughout the novel! But more specifically, it's asking directly about the impacts distorted (i.e. misrepresentative/twisted/warped) memories have on individuals, and whether this is harmful or not. So ultimately, you have to look at which memories are distorted throughout the novel, and evaluate whether this process is ultimately helpful to the characters or not.\n\nNot sure what we mean by âtheme-based promptâ? Then, youâll want tolearn more about the 5 types of essay prompts here.\n\nâStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nMany characters' memories are altered significantly from what actually occurred - this is especially relevant for the characters living after the pandemic, as memories naturally distort over a 20-year period\n\nThe two main characters we see whose memories are altered the most are Tyler and Kirsten - both of whom were children during the collapse of civilisation\n\nFor Tyler, his recollections of the past are all dominated by violence and this has a significant impact on his worldview. One could very easily argue that it is this distorted view of reality that ultimately leads to the formation of his cult and the subsequent harm he inflicts\n\nThus, in the case of Tyler, it is quite clear that the distortion of memories has been quite harmful\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Kirsten has had to commit unspeakable acts, (as implied by her being unable to remember her past/childhood), but this is seen as a coping mechanism, allowing her to move forward in life\n\nThus, for Kirsten, the manipulation of her memories through her forgetting is ultimately rather positive!\n\nMemory distortion doesn't just relate to these two characters - it also affects Clark quite severely\n\nHe is shown to be quite unhappy in the pre-apocalyptic world, which is a stark contrast to his fulfilment by the end of the novel. What causes this?\n\nThis can be attributed to his distortion of memories which allows him to view the old world in a far more positive manner, with significant nostalgia\n\nThus, like Kirsten, Clark's distortion of memories is also presented as largely beneficial\n\nSo ultimately, while there are downsides to manipulating one's memories (Tyler), Mandel shows that distorting memories is largely a positive coping mechanism for many characters!\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nFrom my brainstorming, I'll be approaching the essay with the following contention:Â\n\nDistorting memories can be harmful but more often is beneficial.\n\nNow it's time to work out our paragraph ideas.\n\nP1: Tyler's distortion of memories is largely detrimental and therefore harmful because they are tainted with violence and thus exacerbate his suffering.\n\nP2: However, Kirsten uses this as a coping mechanism, enabling her to move forward from the trauma associated with the collapse of society and therefore the distortion of memories is necessary in her case.\n\nP3: Further, Clark's rose-tinted view of the past world allows him to come to terms with the collapse of society and again is beneficial.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nWhile Emily St. John Mandel's post-apocalyptic novel Station Eleven illustrates the harm which can be associated with the distortion of memories, it ultimately expounds on the benefits which can be garnered by those who alter their perceptions of reality given how this can serve as an invaluable coping mechanism to process trauma. The non-linear structure of her novel, achieved through the interweaving of pre- and post-lapsarian scenes (1), allows her to sculpt parallels between her characters who are able to accurately recall both the positives and the negatives of the 'modern world'. She thus advocates that whilst the distortion of memories can perpetuate and enable violence, it can alternatively result in tangible benefits when utilised in a positive manner, thus exposing Mandel's credence in how this can actually serve to benefit individuals and entire communities as a whole.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) It is really useful to show an understanding of how the novel has been constructed and why - so through Station Eleven not following a traditional model of time, this allows Mandel to really contrast between her characters - namely Kirsten and Tyler.\n\nMandel expounds (2) how the distortion of memories can ultimately exacerbate the suffering experienced by vast sectors of the community, arguing that it is this which actively perpetuates harm due to the inability of humans to adequately process trauma, particularly trauma which stems from one's childhood given the loss of innocence which accompanies this. Indeed, Tyler, who was characterised as a young boy during the 'neutron bomb' of the Georgia Flu and the subsequent destruction of civilisation 'had the misfortune of remembering everything', ultimately resulting in dire consequences for the majority of characters who interact with him. Mandel condemns Tyler's innate desire to justify the pandemic, arguing his inability to forget, process and fully comprehend âthe blood drenched years of the collapseâ drives the creation of his cult which eventually perpetuates great suffering. This ultimately results in significant consequences, thus allowing her to denounce how the distortion of memories (with Tyler's recollections largely being defined by extreme violence and gore) can be extremely harmful. Indeed, 'ruling with a combination of charisma, violence and cherry-picked verses from the Book of Revelations', Tyler damages the overwhelming majority of people he comes into contact with, from having numerous 'child brides' to rendering the town of St. Deborah by the Water 'unsafe' to his cult containing only a few 'true believers', (3) serving as the embodiment of humanity's insatiable lust for power. Through his reciting of only phrases from the Book of Revelations, labelled the most exclusionary and brutal book of the New Testament (4), Mandel condemns the selectivity of Tyler's beliefs, advocating that his internalisation of only the most harmful and violent phrases exemplifies the lack of benefits associated with violently distorting memories given the inability of humans to process such immense trauma and suffering. Whilst Mandel explains Tyler's actions as stemming from the violence underpinning his childhood, particularly given that he was raised by a 'lunatic' whom others deemed 'unsaveable', she dispels the notion that this excuses them, arguing the degree of hardships inflicted by Tyler himself are unjustifiable, thus further exposing her credence in the necessity of being able to forget harmful memories in order to overcome them. Ultimately, through her portrayal of Tyler's inability to forget his childhood as 'a boy adrift on the road', Mandel reveals the potential for harm to be imposed due to the distortion of memories so that they are marked by violence, arguing that this can indeed be overwhelmingly dangerous.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(2) It is great to use action words such as 'expounds' instead of the basic 'showsâ as this demonstrates a more in-depth understanding of the authorâs views and values (ensuring you meet VCAA Criteria 2: Views and Values).\n\n(3) When making claims such as that Tyler harms 'the majority of people he comes into contact with', it is great to show multiple examples, so that your claims are properly backed up with appropriate evidence!\n\n(4) This is a really great point to draw out that other students may not consider - Tyler never references any other components of the New Testament and only focuses on the most violent sections of one particular book.\n\nHowever, Mandel also displays a belief in the positives which can be gleaned by those who inherently distort their memories as a mechanism to process traumatic times in their lives, arguing this can provoke significant, tangible benefits. Conveyed through the non-linear structure of her novel, Mandel sculpts parallels between Tyler and Kristen given their similar ages and respective connections to protagonist Arthur through him serving as their father and father figure respectively, with the significant difference being that only the latter was able to forget 'the year [she] spent on the roadâ¦the worst of it' (5). As such, only Kirsten is able to adequately move on from this extremely traumatic period in her life, exemplifying Mandel's credence in how the distortion of memories can truly serve as an invaluable coping mechanism allowing individuals to overcome significant harm, with Kirsten experiencing a large degree of post-lapsarian fulfilment given her 'friendships' with her fellow members of the Travelling Symphony, her 'only home'. Despite Kirsten's past being underpinned by significant violence, with her having three 'knife tattoos' to commemorate those she has had to kill in order to survive, her continued ability to adapt her memories into less traumatic ones is applauded, with her murders having been portrayed as occurring 'slowlyâ¦sound drained from the earth' as a way for her to process 'these men [which she] will carry with [her] for the rest of [her] life', thereby exposing Mandel's credence in the necessity of being able to overcome trauma through distorting memories. As such, she ironically went on to perform Romeo and Juliet following one such event which, given Mandel's depiction of the unparalleled significance of artistic forms of expressionism facilitating human wellbeing as Kirsten 'never feels more alive' than when she performs, exposes Mandel's illumination of how altering false realities (6) can ultimately provoke tangible benefits given Kirsten's ability to simply move on despite the traumatising nature of the truth. Ultimately, through the juxtaposition between Tyler and Kirstens' distortion (7) of memories, Mandel expounds how distorting memories can wield both consequences and benefits, with the latter occurring when employed subconsciously by individuals to process harmful memories.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(5) It is quite sophisticated to go back to the construction of the novel throughout the essay (as opposed to just briefly mentioning it in the introduction!). This shows you truly understand why the author structured the novel the way she did, which in this case is to highlight the similarities and differences between Kristen and Tyler.\n\n(6) Try to avoid repeating 'distortion of memories' every single time - it is great to use synonyms such as 'false realities', but make sure you're using the right words (see annotation 2 for more information).\n\n(7) Note how this links back to paragraph 1 (given that these two points are so similar and go off of one another) which makes the essay flow better. We are showing that our argument is well-structured and follows logical patterns.\n\nFurthermore, Mandel similarly explores the benefits of utilising the distortion of memories as a coping mechanism and how, especially when this is done through the lens of nostalgia, it can facilitate unprecedented satisfaction. Indeed, Clark is depicted to be the literal embodiment of post-lapsarian fulfilment (8) given his ability to, albeit through rose-tinted glasses, appreciate the 'taken-for-granted miracles' of the 'former world' through his position as the 'Curator' at the 'Museum of Civilisation'. Subsequently, he serves to expose Mandel's belief in the benefits of altering one's recollections in an overwhelmingly positive manner. As such, Clark 'spend[s] more time in the pastâ¦letting his memories overtake him' as he maintains integral cultural artefacts which 'had no practical use but that people wanted to preserve'. This ultimately eventuates into a significant degree of fulfilment for not only Clark himself, but also the other residents of the Severn City Airport, the children of whom 'like all educated children everywhereâ¦.memorise abstractions' of the pre-lapsarian society, with the entire Airport community revelling in the everyday 'beauty' of objects not typically appreciated by the general populace. In doing so Mandel highlights her belief regarding the significance underpinning the benefits which can be gained from those whose memories are distorted to cope with losses in a positive manner, arguing this can enable a substantial increase in wellbeing. This is exacerbated through the juxtaposition in Clark's pre- and post-lapsarian fulfilment, for in the former he is denigrated as merely an unhappy 'minimally present...high functioning sleepwalker' (9). Overall, through her portrayal of Clark's satisfaction despite his elderly status and the loss of everyone dear to him, Mandel exposes her belief in the value of distorting one's memories in an overwhelmingly positive manner, advocating this can facilitate the forming of one's intrinsic purpose and thus fulfilment.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) You want to show how characters correlate to specific themes, and if one embodies a particular idea, then you should clearly state that! It shows examiners you really know your stuff. See this blog for more about the themes and characters in Station Eleven.Â\n\n(9) Again, you want to clearly highlight how Clark is distorting his memories, including by providing evidence to back up your claim.\n\nUltimately, Emily St. John Mandelâs Station Eleven exemplifies the limitations of the human psyche when affected by trauma, arguing that the distortion of memories can have either a positive or negative impact upon the individual. Whilst she cautions her audience against the dangers of adhering to selective recollections, she simultaneously presents the benefits which can be garnered from this, alongside the ability to liberate oneself from such harmful memories.\n\n---\n\nFor more Station Eleven writing samples, check out this blog post, which compares three different paragraphs and analyses how they improve upon one another.\n\nIf you found this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our Station Eleven Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!\n\nUpdated 14/12/2020\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nDefinition of Metalanguage\n\nExamples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nConclusion\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough it appears on criteria sheets, many students never really understand the termÂ metalanguage. Strangely, it is something that is rarely addressed in classrooms. While the word may be foreign to you, rest assured that metalanguage is not an entirely new concept you have to learn. How come? Because you have been unknowingly using metalanguage since the very beginning of high school.\n\nIt's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes.\n\nSo, let's find out exactly what metalanguage is.\n\n2. Definition of Metalanguage\n\nMetalanguage isÂ language that describes language.\n\nSo, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles, and trying to analyze what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nThe simplest way to explain this is to focus on part 3 of the English exam â Language Analysis. In Language Analysis, we look at the authorâs writing and label particular phrases with persuasive techniques such as: symbolism, imagery or personification. Through our description of the way an author writes (via the words âsymbolismâ, âimageryâ or âpersonificationâ), we have effectively used language that describes language.\n\nNow, if we look at the bigger picture, our analysis of an authorâs language can be applied to Text Response, and even Reading and Comparing. To learn more about why metalanguage is important in Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Otherwise, for those interested in Comparative, head over to our Ultimate Guide to VCE Comparative.\n\n3. Examples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nNovel\n\nTone\n\nNarrator\n\nGrammar and punctuation\n\nCharacterisation\n\nForeshadowing\n\nFor example\n\nAchilles isÂ characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he isÂ inside a womb.Â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve*, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award\n\nAs you can see, the word 'foreshadows' pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyze what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used.\n\n*If you happen to be studying this text, check out our All About Eve Character Profiles.\n\nFilm\n\nMise-en-scene\n\nCamera angles\n\nMusic\n\nLighting\n\nFor example\n\nWhen Terry leaves Friendlyâs bar, the thick fog symbolises his clouded moral judgement as he decides whether he should remain âD and Dâ, or become a âratâ. (On the Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nPlay\n\nStage direction\n\nSoliloquy\n\nMonologue\n\nProp\n\nMotifs\n\nFor example\n\nThe miniature set Zac creates is designed with a white backdrop, symbolising his desire to wipe away reality since he âcanât stand real things'. (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nThis student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs indicated earlier, you should be familiar with many, if not all the terms mentioned above. Take note that some metalanguage terms are specific to a writing form, such as camera angle for films. If you need help learning new terms, we have you covered - be sure to check out our metalanguage word banks for books and our metalanguage wordbank for films.\n\nAs you discuss themes or characters, you should try and weave metalanguage throughout your body paragraphs. The purpose of this criteria is to demonstrate your ability to understand how the author uses language to communicate his or her meaning. The key is to remember that the authorâs words or phrases are always chosen with a particular intention â it is your job to investigate why the author has written a text in a particular way.\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. Today, I'm really excited to talk to you about metalanguage. Have you guys ever heard of metalanguage before? It's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes. So, let's find out exactly what is metalanguage.\n\nSimply put, metalanguage just means language that analyses language. When authors write anything, we make certain decisions when it comes to writing. So, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles and trying to analyse what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nMetalanguage comes in really handy, especially if you're somebody who struggles with retelling the story - I have a video on how to avoid retelling the story, which you can watch. Metalanguage essentially takes you to the next level. It prevents you from just saying what happened, and forces you into actually looking at how the ideas and themes are developed by the author through the words that they choose to use. So, let's have a look at a couple of examples to give you a better idea. I'm going to show you two examples. One uses metalanguage and one doesn't, and you'll see how a massive difference in how the student understands the text is really clear.\n\nNumber one, foreshadowing.\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz emphasizes Eve's sorrowful expression as she accepts her award.\n\nVersus\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award.\n\nAs you can see, as soon as we put in the word foreshadows, it pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyse what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used. So, in this case, it's foreshadowing.\n\nâ\n\nLet's have a look at another one, motif.\n\nIn Medea, Euripides commonly refers to animals when describing Medea's actions and temperament.\n\nVersus\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nSee how, in the first example, it was really just telling you what we might already know through just reading the book, but when it comes to the second example, this student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\nSo, those are some examples of metalanguage. There are so many more different types of metalanguage out there...\n\nIntroduction\n\nPoetry. Students tend to have strong feelings about it, some love the melodic rhythm and the eloquent way in which it encapsulates life and others hate it, either because they find it a snooze-fest and would rather read the dictionary, or they simply donât know how to approach analysing it. Whatever boat you may be in, by the end of your study of Peter Skrzyneckiâs New/Old World poems, youâre bound to have a new appreciation for the art that is poetry and find analysing poems less of a daunting prospect and more a something easy to nail.\n\nBefore we begin diving into Skrzynecki, Iâd highly recommend that you check our LSGâs Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Itâs jam-packed with awesome, FREE advice for how to ACE Text Response.\n\nAnalysing Poetry in Old/New World\n\nUnlike other forms of text, a collection of poems is not one continuous body of writing, instead a poetry collection is more like a series of vignettes, snapshots into poignant moments, in this case, of an authorâs life. Whilst many students may struggle with this form and ask âHow many poems do I analyse? Do I need to know all of them?â, poems are easier than most texts to prioritise and categorise into themes and often have a significant amount of metalanguage. And in answer to your questions, whilst its best you analyse the whole collection to some extent, knowing 10 or so strategically chosen poems really well, covering all themes and types should hold you in good stead for any question thrown at you in the exam.\n\nContext\n\nPeter Skrzynecki wrote his poems over a significant amount of time, starting in 1970 and ending in 2006. This has given the collection a unique perspective, not only demonstrating a migrantâs journey through narrative, but also by providing the different attitudes and feelings of belonging, experienced by one individual as they try to assimilate in their new world over a period of time. This gives us, as students, a wonderful opportunity to look deeper into the text and identify Skrzyneckiâs differing positions in regard to identity, family and belonging, through the perspective from which he writes his poems at different stages of his life.\n\nTo learn more about the importance of context in VCE English, check out this blog post.\n\nThe Structure\n\nSkrzyneckiâs collection tends to feature three types of poem, by identifying these, analysing each piece can be made easier as similar types of poem often focus on similar themes. The three categories of poetry to look for are:\n\nNature Poems\n\nPeter Skrzynecki showcases his connection to Australia through poems that depict often idyllic landscapes, or the lives of common fauna of Australia, such as birds and fish.\n\nThe Immigrant Experience\n\nThese poems such as Immigrants at Central Station, Migrant Hostel and The Polish Immigrant offer an insight into the emotionally turbulent and difficult journey migrants go through to live in Australia. These poems also demonstrate the experiences of relief and joy felt when arriving, as well as emotions of fear, trepidation and disconnect in regards to both their new home and their old world.\n\nFamily Poems\n\nOften the most emotionally pulling, these poems tug at the heartstrings and showcase the relationships between Peter Skrzynecki and his family, as well as his exploration of his heritage, his ties to his Polish background.\n\nThe new/old world structure, similar to the old and new testament of the bible are used to highlight the old world of Skrzyneckiâs Polish roots and childhood, whilst the new world is his new life in Australia.\n\nRecurring Characters in Old/New World\n\nPeter Skrzynecki\n\nThe author of this text, as well as a character in his own right, Peter describes his triumphs and struggles of immigrating to Australia in his poems.\n\nFeliks Skrzynecki\n\nThe Polish adopted father of Peter, a âgentle manâ who immigrated to Australia with him family from Germany often demonstrates the struggle of the older generation to fully âbelongâ, as they have grown up amongst different customs. This difference in the two generationsâ assimilation is depicted in the poem Feliks Skrzynecki, as we see Feliks as attached to his Polish customs and traditions, as he âreminisce[s]â with his Polish friends. We also discover that he struggles with the English language, is a hard worker and has had cancer twice in his foot. Peter in comparison is seen to have far more of a disconnect with his Polish ancestry he âinherited unknowinglyâ and forget his âfirst Polish wordâ as he learns of a culture âfurther South of Hadrianâs Wallâ.\n\nThemes in Old/New World\n\nAs we all know, themes are an integral part of Text Response overall, and that still rings true for Skrzyneckiâs poetry. To learn more about how to implement themes into different types of Text Response prompts, check out our blog on LSGâs Five Types of Text Response Prompts!\n\nBelonging\n\nOne of the most central themes of Skrzyneckiâs poems is that of belonging. As the poems detail an immigrantâs emotional journey, alternating between feeling that they belong and donât belong, we are invited to grapple with what it means to belong both mentally and physically as well as what elements are required to feel a sense of belonging in community and country.\n\nIdentity\n\nIdentity is another central theme, one that runs closely to that of belonging, as a main part of oneâs identity is the culture/place/family to which they feel they belong. Old/New World: New and Selected Poems explores the formation and changes in a migrantâs sense of identity as they try to find belonging in their new Australian home as well as later, when they try to reconnect with their European heritage. To explore the theme of identity itâs best to break it down into several influential factors, which are listed below:\n\nPlace\n\nThe surroundings in which a person finds themselves, as well as the place they call home is an essential part of identity, as it showcases what place one identifies with and feels safe in. Â Several of the poems are set in places of transition, such as at a train station, this helps to emphasize the displacement some migrants may feel as they struggle to acclimatise to their new home. In poems such as Immigrants at central station Skyznecki illustrates an environment of anxiety and trepidation, however, he finishes the poem with sentiments of hope of the new future, the new world the immigrants were travelling to, along âglistening tracks of steelâ.\n\nHeritage\n\nAn individualâs heritage, that is the places and people from which they come to identify with, is seen to have a profound impact on the characters in Skrzyneckiâs poems. There are several poems set in graveyards or in Europe where Peter questions his knowledge of where he came from, and his sense of connection to these people and places. One of the most interesting set of poems regarding heritage is the poems regarding the different sections of a graveyard for the different groups, through this Skrzynecki touches on how most will never fully part with their heritage, instead, even in death, most will reconnect with their upbringing and hold on to their roots.\n\nCustoms\n\nThe difference in a culturesâ customs is a struggle seen throughout the text. However, customs are also seen to be the way in which migrants make themselves at home whilst being able to still identify with their past. Through the generational gap between Peter and his father, we can identify the difficulty older generations may have in letting go of customs, whilst the younger new Australians often find it far easier to attach themselves to new traditions.\n\nLanguage\n\nAn integral part of identity and in cultivating a sense of belonging is the language that we speak, as the way in which we are able to communicate ourselves and who we have accessible conversation has a large impact on oneâs sense of belonging or disconnect from a culture . This is due to language barriersâ ability to foster or inhibit connection. We see this as Peter demonstrates his struggle at times to identify with his Polish roots, symbolised in his loss of Polish language as he âforgot [his] first Polish wordâ. Despite his father repeating it until he never forgets, this forgetfulness illustrates the effort which is often required to remain connected to heritage when physically distant from it. Languageâs ability to also expose the differences between people and make them feel like outsiders is also explored in First day of school and The Polish Immigrant as people such as teachers struggle with the pronunciation of Polish names and inevitably have to ask âboy, how do you pronounce that?â. We see through these poems how disconnect can be fostered due to the struggle of communication as the picking apart of their names make the new immigrants feel âtiredâ, âembarrass[ed]â and as if their name was that of a âEuropean diseaseâ. Language is also seen to hold migrants back as seen in Migrant Bachelor where a lack of a familiar language relegates a migrant to âfactory chimneys and punch card clocksâ which âask no proof of speechâ. Â This struggle with language, both the disconnect and joy that comes with communicating and the opportunities it affords individuals, is essential in determining how one identifies themselves.\n\nFamily/Ancestry\n\nHow connection to family members and knowledge of ancestry impacts sense of identity is investigated through many family poems and through Skrzyneckiâs somewhat frequent admissions of remorse in regard to not knowing the history behind objects or people. We also see how a difference in sense of belonging can affect relationships, in that we see Peter and his father donât have the closest of relationships, likely due to Peter feeling he belongs to Australia whilst Feliks still had strong connections to his Polish upbringing. Â We also see this regret of disconnect when Skrzynecki writes about his mother and the photograph he has of her and the man that was his father, and how he wishes he had asked about it more. Whilst Skrzynecki mainly describes the immigrant experience in his poems, we can also find an overarching warning to not take loved one, and their knowledge for granted, as often we donât have them for as long as we would hope.\n\nMemories\n\nSkrzynecki often reminisces about his childhood and uses it as a way to explore both his experience in his new world of Australia, and his old world of his Polish roots. We see Skrzynecki in Migrant Centre Site, revisiting the location where he first lived after arriving in Australia, noting that there was nothing to âcommemorate [their] arrivalâ, this perhaps demonstrates his desire for a legacy, to leave a footprint of the journey so many âthousandâ migrants travelled and not just a âslab of cementâ as if his home was a dead âcemeteryâ. He also reminisces in Old Hostel Site where he explores the âimmense souvenirsâ and âunclaimed baggageâ that is one of the first sites in Australia his parents arrived at. Using this jargon regarding travel, Skrzynecki reminds readers of the many miles migrants often have to travel to reach Australia.\n\nNature\n\nSkrzynecki often uses nature to symbolise the migrant experience, as demonstrated by the birds in his poem Migrant Hostel. In this poem migrants are compared to a âhoming pigeon/circling to get its bearingsâ as Peter remarks on the struggle of taking someone out of their previous home, like an animal out of its natural habitat.\n\nNature is also a major element in Skrzynecki's effort to become an Australian poet, his frequent referencing of Australian landscapes signposting his journey to identify as an Australian, as well as an Australian poet.\n\nHope and Loss\n\nNot only does Skrzynecki detail the hope for a new future and loss of home common in a migrantâs experience, his poems also cover other common situations of love and loss, such as his emotional poem Leukemia which details the journey of his father as a leukemia patient. This shows belonging and identity in a far different light, not in relation to a country but being identified by your sickness which âowns your nameâ. This explores the common experience where a patient feels defined by their condition and struggles to imagine/remember what life is like as a healthy individual.\n\nMetalanguage, Symbols and Motifs in Old/New World\n\nâ¢ Feliks Skrzyneckiâs garden: due to his strong bond to his Polish roots Feliks arguably never felt a sense of belonging in Australia. Instead we find he creates a sense of belonging by cultivating a home of his own, a garden.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses the natural world such as fish and birds to mirror the migrant journey.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki litters his poems with heirlooms such as watches, hammers and photos, often to illustrate how despite having these possessions Peter frequently finds that he doesnât know the full story of his heritage and his parentâs life. In his rediscovery of the heirlooms we often see his disconnect from his background and his regret of not learning more about it.\n\nâ¢ The use of a colloquial idiom of âkept pace only with the Joneses'' in Feliks Skrzynecki, to reference how his belonging only feels surface deep. However, as they are only the Joneses of âhis own mindâs makingâ it also showcases his commitment to not simply copy and to still be individual.\n\nâ¢ Skrzynecki often uses places of transit such as train stations or hostels to showcase the uncertainty often experienced in a migrantâs journey.\n\nQuick Tips\n\nResearch the places referenced in Skrzynecki poems such as Mt Warning\n\nLearn to spell the authors last name\n\nDonât just analyse the poems individually, try and see the big picture and apply the overarching themes\n\nFor a more detailed guide on how to ACE VCE Text Response, I think youâd love the free sample of our top-rated eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response!

Rookeâs primary conflict is his choice between his moral conscience and duty as a soldier. Because he is aware from an early age that he is out of step with the world, he tends to be more reasonable in his way of dealing with conflict. His final response to his inner conflict is to stand strongly by what he believes.\n\nThe Lieutenant at its core is a journey of self-discovery as Daniel Rooke navigates the immoral waters of British imperialism and its impact on the indigenous Australians. Becoming closer to Tagaran, Rooke attempts to bridge cultural barriers through the transformative power of language. Rooke observes the scissions created by violence and the perhaps misplaced Western superiority and is perpetually torn between his moral intuitions and his obligations and duty as a Lieutenant.\n\nTIP: Have an understanding of the historical context behind The Lieutenant as well as the real life people that Grenville loosely based her novel off of. This means having a grasp on the first fleet, the British colonisation of Australia and important figures such as Bennelong.\n\nThemes\n\nTIP: I have included some examples from the text but this list is by no means exhaustive, occasionally there is a repetition of examples. Itâs important to remember that examples are versatile and can be applied to many different themes and ideas. Feel free to add and explore how other examples might enhance these themes.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage dictates commonality and communication, yet to Rooke he discovers that central to the power of language is the willingness to cooperate, patience and respect. Throughout Grenvilleâs novel, however, it is clear that language can not only dispel the lasting vestiges of misunderstanding but it can also form the basis for racism and violence. It is through our language itself that reveals our biases.\n\nThe language of racism\n\nWeymark refers to the Indigenous men during their first encounter as âmister darkieâ etc. each a patronising euphemism concealing his arrogant notions of superiority\n\nThe limitation of language to accurately portray and convey a moment\n\nâwhat had passed between Tagaran and himself had gone far beyond vocabulary or grammatical formsâ (pg186)\n\nThe language of violence\n\nâwhat it said was I can kill you. He did not want her to learn that language. Certainly not from himâ (pg224)\n\nâViolence had an enlivening effect. As long as someone else was the victim it made the blood pump, gave the world an edge of glamourâ (pg239)\n\nâGamekeeper. He wondered whether that word had killed Brugdenâ (pg240)\n\nâThe gun is the only language the buggers will understandâ (pg241)\n\nâwar was a species of conversationâ (pg108)\n\nAssumed cultural superiority of British empire\n\nThe hierarchical nature of British Society stands in diametric opposition to the community-oriented system employed by the Indigenous Australians. This hierarchy defines their people by their contributions to âHer Majestyâ and shames and âpunish[es]â all those who fail to comply with the loose morals and violence condoned by the British colonists. This notion is elucidated through the exploitation of the natives and the nations reliance on oppression and servitude to maintain its imperial status, put simply: their strength is an accident arising from the weakness of others. It is on this foundation that Grenville explores the violent treatment of the natives by the British and even their treatment of their own people.\n\nâIn the world of Church Street, Benjamin Rooke was a man of education and standing and a father to be proud of. At the Portsmouth Naval Academy a mile away, he was an embarrassmentâ (pg6)\n\nâSo we punishâ¦. Every man is the same. If he steals, he is punishedâ¦ It was interesting to hear that magnificent idea â the product of hundreds of years of British civilisation â spelled out so plainâ(pg195)\n\nThis was justice: impartial, blind, noble. The horror of the punishment was the proof of its impartiality. If it did not hurt, it was not justice.â (pg197)\n\nâBy god they are savageâ¦ Dirty too, look at the filth on themâ\n\nâthey may be savages, we call them savages. But their feelings are no different from oursâ\n\nWeymark resorts to derogatory name calling, urging on âmy black friendâ and âMister Darkieâ in his base supplications\n\nPower of conscience\n\nThe morality that is ingrained in Rooke from the onset aligns quite naturally with our own moral standards. Yet Grenville encourages readers to explore the difficult choice between morals and disobedience. Rooke faces such a choice. To obey an order to accompany an expedition to capture or kill six indigenous men, this forms the central conflict of Grenvilleâs novel. As elucidated through both Rooke and Gardiner, moral acts that defy the expectations and âorders of Her Majestyâ are deeply frowned upon.\n\nâBut Rooke, think: this is not a request, it is an orderâ (pg246)\n\nââ¦spell out the consequences of refusal.â (pg248)\n\nââ¦ the service of humanity and the service of His Majesty were not congruentâ (pg249)\n\nâI am sorry to have been persuaded to comply with the order. I would not for any reason ever obey a similar orderâ (pg285)\n\nâyour orders were a most gravely wrong thing, I regret beyond my words my part in the businessâ (pg285)\n\nViolence\n\nViolence is central to the operation of imperialists as the British tightens its grip on the Indigenous Australians. Grenville emphasises that the power sought out by the British empire will always come at the expense of the natives. Violence and force are used to assert power, confirm boundaries around usurped land, promulgate fear and discourage resistance. The gun becomes a symbol of the violence and force of the settle and they show little intention of relinquishing the dominant position that the gun affords them.\n\nThe punishment for the mutineers of the Renegade reinforces Rookeâs understanding of institutional power and violence as one lieutenant is hanged in a gruesome spectacle and the others dispatched into a nameless void.\n\nWeymark is determined to affirm his dominance and establish the white man as a powerful force\n\nBrugdenâs increased freedom with a weapon results in violence towards the natives which culminates in the kidnapping of the two native men who are âgrabbedâ against their will\n\nBrugdenâs unchecked brutality, and Gilbertâs excessive use of force, highlights the colonialistsâ use of violence as a means of achieving their goal\n\nDuty, service, obedience and the military life\n\nConforming to the pressures of the British Empire, Rooke joins the marines and complicitly serves without attempting to question the morality behind his actions. Importantly, he joins the marines not out of patriotic pride, but because he believes it will aid him to pursue his academic curiosities and steer away from violence. Yet it only brings him closer to the reality that lurks behind the ostensibly moral quest of British imperialism.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nTIP: Whilst The Lieutenant focusses on Rookeâs experiences, you canât neglect the minor characters in the novel, they are there for a reason! Think about how these characters are similar or different, how their stories contribute to Grenvilleâs overall message and their relationship with the central protagonist Rooke. â\n\nDaniel Rooke\n\nAnalysis\n\nLieutenant on the first fleet\n\nAwkward\n\nStruggles to articulate his thoughts and emotions as he is afraid of being âout of step with the worldâ\n\nFrom a young age, Rookeâs interactions with others has made it clear to him that he is different.

And what unique perspective does Grenvilleâs choice of narrative perspective offer us?\n\nLanguage\n\nGrenvilleâs language reflects Rookeâs love for language. Her choice of imagery reveals Rookeâs way of seeing the world. For example, âcrescent of yellow sand like a punctuation markâ accentuates Rookeâs tendency to observe his world as a linguist might and Â highlights Rookeâs deep connection with language. Likewise, Rookeâs perception of a gun that speaks a language that âdoes not require listenersâ emphasises his natural tendency to think as a linguist. Grenville does not write in an overly complex, dense or poetic way in order to mirror Rookeâs tendency to view things logically\n\nSetting\n\nHow does the setting that Rooke finds himself in mirror or parallel the emotions that he experiences?\n\nNaval Academy (Portsmouth)\n\nâjust another world that wrenched him out of shapeâ\n\nâsucked out of his spirit and left a shell beingâ\n\nâclosed in on itselfâ, ânarrowâ, âsqueezed tightlyâ\n\nSydney Cove\n\nâThere is nowhere in the world that I would rather beâ(pg97)\n\n\"On the northern shore, high dark prows of headlands hung over the water, the sombre woods pressing down into their own reflections. To the south the land was lower, each bay and promontory shining with the glossy leaves of mangroves. Now and then between them a crescent of yellow sand was like a punctuation markâ (pg89)\n\nTIP: Just like the minor characters I mentioned before, meaning and themes come from all aspects of a novel not just plot points and major characters. By including niche examples such as the setting or the narrative perspective, you can demonstrate that you have a really thorough understanding of the text!\n\nâ\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nâ\n\nThis videoâs takeaway message focuses on tackling essay prompts that include quotations. The extra quote with the prompt can seem superfluous, but often, they can provide hints about how to tackle or challenge the essay topic. It is there for a reason, and if you are familiar with the quote, I would recommend that you try to incorporate it into your essay!\n\nBefore we unpack todayâs essay topic, letâs have a look at background information.\n\nKate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant explores the commonality of the human spirit amidst tumultuous conflict during the First Fleetâs arrival in Australia in 1788. Drawing upon the true experiences of William Dawes, a British astronomer and one of the lieutenants to travel with the First Fleet, Grenville crafts a work of fiction inspired by Dawesâ âtwo little blue notebooksâ detailing his growing understanding of the Aboriginal language Gadigal and his conversations and connection with Patyegarang, a young Aboriginal girl.\n\nThe ability for two individuals from completely different worlds to transcend their differences in order to share cherished moments and understandings together is exemplified in The Lieutenant, alongside the rife external and internal conflicts which threaten such relationship.\n\nTodayâs prompt is:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â\n\nHow does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStart off with focusing on the keywords in this prompt, especially the phrases that resonate with you for Steps 1 and 2 of brainstorming (which I have previously covered in other essay topic breakdowns.)\n\nIn particular, letâs have a look at the phrase âconflict of conscienceâ as this captures the essence of the prompt and what you will need to discuss in your essay. Â\n\nConflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we will need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and âsidesâ need to be taken. Â\n\nConflict itself is a central theme of The Lieutenant, however, it is important to recognise that this topic considers conflict through the narrower lens of âconflict of conscienceâ. This means that in your discussion, the relevance to the prompt is crucial to keep in mind to ensure you are actually answering the question! Â\n\nBut first, letâs analyse the quote:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different pathsâ\n\nThis quote alludes to Rookeâs realisation regarding the reality of his identity, not only as Tagaranâs friend or âkamaraâ but also as a soldier or âBerewalgal\". The resignation and recognition of the impossible â that is, for Rooke to continue attempting to appease both âsidesâ without making critical decisions about who and what he ultimately valued more - is evident in this quote. Hence, this quote refers to the conflict of conscience he experiences and provides us with an insight into not only his character but also conflict itself.\n\nWhy is it not possible for a man to travel along two different paths?\n\nWhat would happen if he tried? Â\n\nWhy was this realisation important for Rooke, especially for his character and development?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions coming to mind upon seeing that quote alone, which all provide hints as to how I might tackle this prompt. Â\n\nNow that we have looked at a few ideas related to the question, weâll now move into potential paragraphs for this essay.\n\nParagraph 1: Grenvilleâs utilisation of Rookeâs perspective in detailing his thought processes, observations and realisations reveals the facets of Rookeâs character contributing to his internal conflicts.\n\nRemembering this is a âhowâ prompt, we want to be analysing ways in which Grenville explores Rookeâs conflict of conscience. In this paragraph, I have chosen to focus on the raw and intimate expression of his inner thoughts and consciousness as the âhowâ aspect. Â\n\nThe detailed perspective reveals Rookeâs naivety in assuming the possibility of maintaining a peaceful connection with Tagaran and the Aboriginal community amidst turbulent and violent times. Consequently, it highlights his realisations regarding the morality of the conflicts he is involved in, and how despite oneâs admirable intentions, âa man could not travel along two different pathsâ without facing dire consequences for their actions. Â\n\nQuestions I might ask myself here include: why does Rooke initially try to deny the reality of his situation? What does his preference for a peaceful and accepting approach towards the Indigenous Australians suggest about his approach to conflict?\n\nThis cognitive dissonance ultimately contributes to his internal conflict between the value he places in his connections with Tagaran and her community and in his duties and obligations as a lieutenant. As readers, we come to realise the duality of this conflict in Rookeâs mind through the limited omniscient third person perspective, which provides us with an insight into Rookeâs shifting understandings of Indigenous people, conflict and even himself. Â\n\nI would then continue unpacking these changing understandings, especially ones relevant to his character which reveal his internal conflicts further. â\n\nParagraph 2: In addition, the stark contrast between Rookeâs approach to his conflict of conscience and other soldiersâ approaches underscores the rationale behind his actions and the stakes ineluctably linked with his choices and morality. Â\n\nThis paragraphâs analysis revolves around Grenvilleâs inclusion of a host of different characters and outlooks - from Indigenous Australians to intransigent Colonial perspectives. I would emphasise the importance of juxtaposition between these different perspectives as it elucidates the values and beliefs underpinning each individualâs choices, especially during conflict. Â\n\nAlthough the core of the essay discusses internal conflicts, highlighting the connection between internal and external conflict would add another layer of complexity to your essay. Rookeâs conflict of conscience results in his permanent departure from Australia, and fleshing out the ramifications of dissent and opposition towards other Colonials is key in demonstrating your understanding of the complex and intertwined nature of conflict.\n\nParagraph 3: Through the detrimental implications of Rookeâs initial conflict avoidance, Grenvilleâs focus on his subsequent self-awareness to unite his morals and his actions highlights the strength of his character to resolve his internal conflicts to prevent further perpetration of injustice towards the Aboriginal population. Â\n\nHere, I am having a closer look at how Rooke's encounters with his conflicts of conscience and the repercussions of his actions in attempting to take a âmiddle-groundâ stance catalyse his development as an individual - in particular, how it solidifies his moral stance and his decision to act in a manner that reflects his beliefs. Â\n\nBy showing Tagaran how to load the gun but not how to fire it, or by accepting the navigator role but distancing oneself from the group, he endeavours to avoid conflict with either âsideâ. However, passivity is a stance within itself, and in the case of the treatment towards Indigenous Australians, Rookeâs silence in not rejecting the actions of other âBerewalgalâ inevitably enables injustice to continue. Â\n\nIt is only through his understanding that non-committal actions also incriminate him as a perpetrator that his choice to sacrifice his Colonial obligations for taking an active stance to fulfil his moral obligations comes to light. This reveals the role that internal conflicts may have in inciting powerful change and realisations in an individual. Â\n\nThe complexity of internal conflict can be difficult to discuss, but by using the quote provided in the prompt and asking yourself questions about the implications of the quote, we are able to delve into and construct a sophisticated understanding of The Lieutenant and of conflict itself.\n\nLSG-curated sample essay topics for The Lieutenant\n\nNow it's your turn!

Sample Essay Topics\n\n6. A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nStation Eleven is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nâTwenty years after the end of air travel, the caravans of the Travelling Symphony moved slowly under a white-hot sky.â\n\nWhen you think about post-apocalyptic science fiction stories, what kind of thing comes to mind first? Maybe an alien invasion, Pacific Rim style monsters perhaps, and almost always the mad scramble of a protagonist to stockpile resources and protect their loved ones from the imminent chaos and destructionâthese are tropes which are tried and tested in this genre.\n\nWhat mightnât come to mind as immediately is a story about a travelling Shakespeare troupe wandering the North American continent decades after the actual apocalypse has struck, which is exactly the story that Mandel tells in Station Eleven.\n\nWhile post-apocalyptic tales tend to focus on the action around the impact of a fictional disaster, Mandelâs novel speaks to the attitudes and characteristics of people which drive any action that occurs. She interrogates central questions about human society, inviting readers to consider what human qualities can endure even an apocalypse, what qualities are timeless.\n\nCharacters\n\nA tale of two timelines: part one\n\nââ¦once weâre seen, thatâs not enough anymore. After that, we want to be remembered.â\n\nPart of the novelâs ambition is that while itâs set 20 years after the apocalyptic Georgia Flu, it constantly reaches decades into the past to search for meaning. In particular, the novelâs central character is Arthur Leander, an actor whose death coincides with the breakout of the Flu. Tracing his origins from obscurity to fame, Mandel juxtaposes his philandering and untrustworthy behaviour with repeated attempts to be a better person, or perhaps just be more true to himself, before his death. Weâll eventually see that many of his actions have consequences years into the future.\n\nArguably equally important in legacy is his first wife, Miranda Carroll, whose comics lend the novel its title. Take this with a grain of saltâsheâs kind of my favourite characterâbut the time and energy she invests in the Station Eleven comics are arguably the most valuable investment of the novel. Her comics survive her in the years following the Flu, and are a source of escape and purpose for others just as they had been for herself.\n\nBoth of these characters come into contact with Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo and journalist who regularly follows Arthur though his career, photographing Miranda in a vulnerable moment before her divorce, and booking an interview with Arthur years later as he plans to leave his second wife Elizabeth Colton. We see Jeevan struggle with his purpose in life throughout the novel, though it can be said that he ultimately finds it after the Flu, when he is working as a medic.\n\nFinally, thereâs Clark Thompson, Arthurâs friend from college who remains loyal, though not necessarily uncritical, of him all throughout his life. As the Flu first arrives in America, Clark is just leaving for Toronto, but a Flu outbreak there causes his flight to be redirected to Severn City Airport, where he and others miraculously survive in what will become a key setting of the novel.\n\nA tale of two timelines: part two\n\nââI stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.â\n\nAll of this finally puts us in a position to think analytically about characters in the âpresentâ timeline, that is, 20 years after the Flu. We experience the present mostly through the perspective of Kirsten Raymonde, a performer who survived the Flu as a young child. Because she was so young when it happened, many of the traumas she experienced have been erased by her mind, and she struggles to piece together what she lost in a quest for identity and meaning, largely driven by her vague memories of Arthur. She travels with the Travelling Symphony with others such as Alexandra, August and the conductorâthey have collectively adopted the motto, âsurvival is insufficient.â\n\nThrough the story, they are pursued by the prophet, later revealed to be Tyler Leander, the child of Arthur and Elizabeth who survived and grew up in the decades following the Flu outbreak. A religious extremist, he becomes the leader of a cult of fanatics who amass weapons and conquer towns by force. Both Kirsten and Tyler pursue the Station Eleven comics, quoted aboveâthey each possess a copy, and resonate strongly with the struggles of the characters created by Miranda.\n\n(CW: suicide) Also important is Jeevanâs brother, Frank, a paraplegic author who was writing about a philanthropist in the last days before his death, whereby he kills himself so as to give his brother a better chance of surviving. While he isnât a particularly major character, his writing on morality and mortality (quoted with the first batch of characters) are symbolically and thematically important.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nThemes\n\nPart 1\n\nâThatâs what passes for a lifeâ¦thatâs what passes for happiness, for most peopleâ¦theyâre like sleepwalkersâ¦â\n\nThese characters already speak to some of the major themes that formulate the novel. On one hand, Mandel explores various meanings of contemporary or modern civilisation. We live in a technology-driven age where constraints of time and space mean less than ever before. For example, people are mobile through space thanks to airplanes and telephones, and the internet means that any and all information is available to anyone, all the time. Mandel constantly looks back at this society and describes it in terms of our technology: for example, âthe era when it was possible to press a series of buttons on a telephone and speak with someone on the far side of the earth.â On one level, she comments on how many of these minor miracles are taken for granted in our every day lives.\n\nOn another level, these elements of society also give rise to the culture of celebrity in our lives, as high-profile figures are put under increasing pressure to maintain appearances at all times, and lead increasingly âperfectâ lives as a result. These were pressures that Arthur struggled to live up to, and his âfailed marriagesâ accompanied his career at all stages. The flip side of this is that people who follow celebrities, such as Jeevan, lead increasingly emptier and more vacuous livesâand Jeevan is well-aware of this, telling Miranda that he doesnât seek a greater purpose in life beyond making money. This lack of purpose, this ennui, is something that tints much of society through the eyes of Mandel.\n\nAnother major theme which the lives of these characters start to explore is the value of art as a source of purpose. While civilisation is portrayed as fragile and meaningless, artâin all its forms, including creating, reproducing, performing and consumingâis a way for people such as Miranda to understand, process and escape their lives. This theme is arguably the most important, as it tethers different parts of the novel together; even after the apocalypse, people turn to art as a way of understanding and connecting to others as well as to themselves.\n\nPart 2\n\nââThe more you remember, the more youâve lost.â\n\nInevitably with this genre, survival and mortality are major themes, as massive populations of people have died and continue to die due to the impacts of the Georgia Flu. To some extent, survivorâs guilt motivates many to search for a deeper meaning to their survival, hence the motto of the Symphony. It also drives them to turn to art as weâve explored, since bare subsistence isnât enough to give their lives the meaning they desire. Maybe this is what it means to be human.\n\nOn the other hand, the Flu also turns others to religious extremity, as is the case with Elizabeth, Tyler and the rest of their cult. This speaks to broader ideas about faith, fate and spiritualityâare there greater forces out there who manipulate events in our world? Certainly, there are enough coincidences in the novel for this theory to be valid; even just Kirsten and Tyler both having copies of Station Eleven and both acting under the influence of Arthur is so coincidental.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important theme here is memory. Mandel ultimately puts this as the central question to readers: is memory more of a blessing or a burden? Is it preferable to remember everything youâve lost, or be ignorant of it all? Iâm not sure she really answers this one, to be honest. Various symbolsâand even the constantly shifting narrative perspectiveâevoke the epic sense of loss in the apocalypse, and yet encountering characters like Alexandra, who never really knew what the internet was, makes you rethink that loss; perhaps it is better to have experienced the internet at all.\n\nSymbols\n\nââPeople want what was best about the worldâ\n\nThereâs a category of symbols in the novel that represent memories of technology. Consider the discarded phones and credit cards in the Museum of Civilisations, all mementos of what the world lost. Note that, given Mandelâs ambivalent commentary about modern society, not all that was lost is badâthe credit card embodies the materialism and consumerism that drive our world today, and shedding it may be construed as a form of liberty, in fact.\n\nIt is airplanes, however, that serve as the greatest reminder. Their sudden disappearance from the sky becomes a constant reminder of how the world changed, and people still look up in the hopes of seeing an airborne plane; they cling onto the hope that maybe, just maybe, all of this can somehow be reversed. The last flights of the human raceâpilots attempting to return home to be with their loved onesâare also made in hope, though their outcomes are consistently unclear.\n\nIn this sense, airplanes can also be seen as a source of fading hope, or rather, despair. For one, it was the very mobility afforded by planes which caused the Flu to spread around the world so rapidly. Now, confined to the ground forever, they represent the immobility of humans in the present. They also take on meanings of death, and in particular, the final airplane that landed at Severn City Airport, quarantined with people still on board, represents the difficult decisions that have to be made in order to survive. The mausoleum plane also pushes Tyler further into religious extremism, as he reads the bible to the now-artefact in an attempt to justify the deaths of everyone on board.\n\nThese symbols highlight the jarring difference between the world before and after the Flu, but on the other hand, there are also symbols which connect the two worlds; the importance of print cannot be underemphasised here. Anything that was printedâphotographs, comics, TV guides, booksâare all enduring sources of knowledge and comfort for Flu survivors, and basically become the only way for children born after the Flu to remember our world, a world that they never actually lived in.\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\nThe following essay topics are extracted from our Station Eleven Study Guide: A Killer Text Guide:\n\nâFirst, we only want to be seen, but once weâre seen, thatâs not enough anymore.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHave a watch of this video to see how we broke down an essay topic:\n\n[Video Transcript]\n\nAlthough this is something that might be a little more text-specific, the main takeaway of todayâs video is to be flexible in how you mentally arrange a textâs plot. This is especially handy in stories that are non-linear, so stories that flip between perspectives or timelines, as this one does. Being across a text like this will give you greater flexibility in putting together your ideas. I think this might be clearer if I just show you!\n\nIn the meantime though, letâs have a bit of a chat about the text.\n\nStation Eleven is Emily St John Mandelâs take on the tried-and-tested sub-genre of post-apocalyptic science fiction. Only, her attempt doesnât actually explore new forms of technology, nor the immediate action-packed grab-and-dash that we normally associate with an apocalypse. Instead, she takes us two decades down the track to look at how human society has changed as a result. She also highlights some elements of society that are eternal and timeless, that survive and persevere no matter what.\n\nTodayâs topic is:\n\nDespite his virtues, Arthur Leander is essentially a bad man. Do you agree?\n\nIf youâre familiar with what we do at LSG, you might be familiar with our Five Types strategy. Basically, itâs a method for students to group categorise prompts into types, and by doing so, you get an immediate idea of how to approach an essay question and some things that you must include, along with things you mustnât.\n\nAnd out of the 5 types, this prompt is character-based, through and through. It poses us the difficult task of deciphering the ethics and morality of an individual in the text. Immediately, if you write on this prompt, you must know Arthur pretty damn well! It pays to be strategic â if you donât know Arthur all that in a SAC or exam, pick another question if possible.\n\nThe key words in this one are fairly self-explanatory. Youâve got âvirtuesâ on the one hand, which basically refers to being good or having good morals, and âbad manâ on the other. Whatâs important is how we define them in the context of the essay, so we need to consider the ways in which Arthur is both virtuous and bad and make sure these are clear in our intro.\n\nAlso, the prompt is suggesting that Arthur Leander is âbadâ at his core, because of the word âessentially.â This is the part where thereâs a little bit of room to challenge, since there is a lot of evidence that might suggest he isnât all bad.\n\nBefore we dive into the plan, you might want to pause here for a minute and write down what you find to be Arthurâs top two virtues and worst two flaws. Go on, do it!\n\nFor me, I think that heâs ambitious and determined in his career, and he can be kind to others in his personal life. However, he also has a philandering or womanising side, and can be neglectful of his family and friends. I would also consider whether or not his legacy was favourable, unflattering, or mixed. Did he leave behind more positivity in the world, or less, when he died?\n\nLetâs arrange this into paragraphs.\n\nParagraph one\n\nArthur is flawed in the way he treats others, manifested in his inconsiderate actions, misogynistic tendencies and raising of Tyler.\n\nI think itâd be hard to argue that Arthur is a flawless character whom it would be unfair to call âbad.â We know that Arthur was unfaithful, and many saw his life as being âsummed up in a series of failed marriages.â We know that he treats women as interchangeable objects rather than as people, not only his wives but also his childhood friend Victoria. We also know that he neglects his children, missing Tylerâs birthday for work, as well as his friends, with his increasingly disingenuous and strained relationship with Clark.\n\nIn terms of mentally rearranging elements of the story, it might be worth noting here how his bad traits manifested in his son, Tyler. Making a connection between these two timelines may help us realise that in many ways, Tyler is just a more perverse version of his fatherâhe too treats women like possessions, and doesnât really have a family so much as a community of followers.\n\nParagraph two\n\nArguably, Arthurâs selfish traits stem from his Hollywood fame, career and lifestyle.\n\nFundamentally, he was never this flaky, unreliable person before he was swept away by fame. From a young age, he was determined that he was âgoing to be an actor andâ¦going to be good,â and the drive with which he pursues this career is undoubtedly virtuous and admirable. Along the way, he offers Miranda a way out of her abusive and one-sided relationship, validating her own âpursuit of happiness.â\n\nSo looking at the âbookendsâ of Arthurâs life, it can be argued that heâs actually essentially a good person. Before Hollywood taints him, and after he realises how much he has been tainted, Arthur does actually demonstrate a lot of virtue.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, overall, Arthur leaves behind a positive legacy that reflects that despite his shortcomings, he is fundamentally a good man who has been tainted by immoral habits and attitudes.\n\nHere, the discussion surrounds Arthurâs legacyâis he remembered as a good person? In what ways does Arthur live on? The photographs that Kirsten finds along her journey depict Arthur shielding Miranda from the paparazzi and spending time with his son, and these are lasting memories of his virtues which havenât been destroyed by the Flu. Consider also the âwhispersâ and âglancesâ that plagued him during his life, and we canât help but wonder what kind of man he wouldâve been in a world with less people and less scrutiny.\n\nAnd there you have it! Hopefully, you can see what I meant at the start about rearranging bits of the book. For example, these photographs belong in Kirstenâs timeline and are discovered through her point of view, but there isnât any reason why you canât connect them to elements of Arthurâs character more broadly. Also, even just by looking at the start and end of Arthurâs life without the middle changes how we interpret him as a character. Itâs this kind of flexibility that will serve you well in this text study.\n\nIf you'd like to see an A+ essay on the essay topic above, complete with annotations on HOW and WHY the essays achieved A+ so you can emulate this same success, then you'll definitely want to check out our Station Eleven Study Guide: A Killer Text Guide!

(Creative Writing Criteria)\n\nLiterary Elements (Characterisation, Themes, Language, Symbolism, Imagery)\n\nLSG's unique REPLICATE and IMAGINE strategy\n\nSample A+Â Creative Response\n\nWriting The Written Explanation\n\nResources To Help You Prepare For Your Creative Response\n\n1. What Is The Creative Response?\n\nThe Creative Response, which forms part of the âReading and creating textsâ component of the study design, is part of the 1st Area of Study (AoS 1) - meaning that the majority of students will tackle the Creative Response in Term 1. Unlike the analytical text response, in the Creative Response you will be asked to write your own imaginative piece in response to a selected text.Â\n\nYou are expected to read and understand the selected text, analyse its key features, and write a creative piece which demonstrates your comprehension of the text.\n\n2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Creative Writing Criteria)\n\nThe creative writing task assesses your ability to combine features of an existing text with your own original ideas. The key intention here is to demonstrate your understanding of the world of the text. You can achieve this by exploring and applying selected elements from the text, such as context, themes, literary devices like symbols, and/or characters. You should also consider the values embedded within the text - this includes explicit values (which can be seen on the surface of the text) and implied values (values we uncover through analysis of the textâs deeper meaning). Try to reflect these values within your writing.Â\n\nYour piece will be a creative response, after all, so you should apply the conventions of this style of writing. Firstly, your creative should follow the structure of a beginning, middle, and end. We can also think of this as rising tension, climax, and resolution. Secondly, you should develop an authentic use of language, voice and style to make your writing more engaging and sophisticated. Thirdly, you can use literary devices to build meaning and depth within your piece. As always, your writing should be consistent with the rules of spelling, punctuation, and syntax (that is, written expression) in Standard Australian English.\n\nPart of this assessment is the Written Explanation, which is a chance for you to explain and justify your creative writing choices. Within the Written Explanation, you should reflect on your writing process and analyse your own work. The primary goal here is to explain the links youâve made to the original text, by considering features like purpose, context, and language.Â\n\nUltimately, to put it simply, you are expected to understand the selected text and demonstrate this in your creative piece.Â If you're looking to quickly increase your creative skills, watch our incredibly popular video below:\n\nâ\n\n3. Literary Elements (Characterisation, Themes, Language, Symbolism, Imagery)\n\nLiterary elements are different parts of the creative writing equation that ensure your piece is consistent with the expected features of this type of writing. When selecting which literary elements to include in your piece, remember to consider the original text and ensure that your work, while creative, also demonstrates your ability to replicate some of its elements.\n\nCharacterisation\n\nAs we know, characters are fictionalised people within the world of a creative text. Almost an entire century ago, the English writer E. M. Forster famously introduced the concept of flat and round characters in his 1927 book, âAspects of the Novelâ. According to Forster, flat characters can be defined by a single characteristic; in other words, they are two-dimensional. For example, the characters of The Simpsons could arguably all be defined as flat characters; Homer is characterised as a slob, Flanders is defined by his Christian faith, Lisa is stereotyped as the âteacherâs petâ, and Bart is portrayed as rebellious. We can define all of these characters as flat because they are labelled to the audience in these two-dimensional ways.\n\nIn contrast to this, round characters have multiple characteristics, which brings them closer to seeming like real, human figures. The personality of these characters extends beyond a single attribute. In Harry Potter, Harry himself is a round character because of how much we learn about him over the course of the series. For example, we find out about Harryâs difficult childhood, his personal challenges, his love interests, and we see his personality grow from book to book.Â\n\nWhether the characters of your creative are flat or round will depend on their involvement within, and importance to, the storyline of your piece. Generally speaking, however, you should aim for the central character(s) to be round, while any minor characters are likely to be flat. Developing round major characters will ensure that they are realistic and believable. In turn, youâll be able to better demonstrate your imaginative skills and understanding of the text through these characters.Â\n\nThemes\n\nThemes are the key ideas and issues that are relevant to the storyline of a fictional text. We can identify themes by labelling the main areas of meaning within a text and thinking about the messages that emerge throughout the text. To build your understanding of themes within a particular text and to evaluate the themes of your own creative, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the text really about, beyond superficial elements like plot and character?\n\nWhat is the text saying to its reader?\n\nWhat are the core idea(s) or issue(s) within the text?\n\nWhat idea(s) or issue(s) do the message(s) of the text correspond with?\n\nTo return to our example of The Simpsons, we could say that the themes within this sitcom include love and family, neighbourliness, and social class. From episode to episode, The Simpsons comments on these different issues. For example, Marge and Homerâs relationship, with its domestic setting and marital ups and downs, is a core aspect of the Simpsons household. Likewise, family is a major component of not only the Simpsons themselves, but also the broader Springfield community. The interactions between parents and children is evident on Evergreen Terrace with the Simpsons and the Flanders families, as well as in other settings such as Springfield Elementary School (where even an adult Principal Skinner is seen through his relationship with his elderly mother). These broad areas can be identified as the key thematic concerns of the series because each episode centres around these ideas.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage refers to the way in which a piece of writing is expressed. We can define this as the âstyleâ, or âtoneâ, of a text. The words and phrasing chosen by a writer determine how ideas are communicated. Effective language will be appropriate for the world of the text and contribute to the narrative in a meaningful way. There are a number of ways in which a piece of writing can be articulated and you should consider the nature of your piece and the language of the original text when deciding what type of language is most appropriate for your creative.\n\nDialogue, on the other hand, is an exchange of conversation between characters. Dialogue is often used to provide context to a text, develop its storyline, or offer direct insight into a characterâs thoughts, feelings and personality.â\n\nSymbolism\n\nA symbol can be defined as a thing that represents something else. Symbols are typically material objects that hold abstract meaning. For example, in Harry Potter, Harryâs scar is a symbol of his difficult childhood. Because Harryâs scar causes him pain in Voldemortâs presence, it can also be said that the scar is symbolic of the connection forged between Harry and Voldemort when his attempt to kill Harry failed. As this example suggests, symbols are often associated with the textâs themes - in this case, Harryâs scar relates to the themes of childhood and death.Â\n\nThe key with symbolism is to connect a particular theme or idea to a physical object. For example, the theme of grief could be portrayed through a photo of someone who has died. Likewise, the theme of change might be represented by a ticking clock, while a characterâs clothing could be a symbol of their wealth or status.\n\nâ\n\nFor more literary elements, also known as metalanguage, check out our lists:\n\nPart 1 â Metalanguage Word Bank For Books\n\nPart 2 â Metalanguage Word Bank For Films With Examples\n\nAnd if that's not enough, you'll also want to check out our How To Write A Killer Creative Study Guide where we unpack these elements in more detail AND analyse imagery, foreshadowing, flash-backs and flash-forwards!Â\n\n4. LSG's unique REPLICATE and IMAGINE Strategy\n\nOverview\n\nIf we think about the criteria of creative writing, weâll see that much of this task involves demonstrating your understanding of the text. For this reason, being able to replicate the world of the text will enable you to showcase your understanding and, in turn, to meet the criteria your teacher will be looking for. Letâs consider how you can strengthen your creative by taking the time to understand the text on a meaningful level and reflect this within your writing.\n\nStep 1: Read\n\nWriting a strong creative piece begins with reading. Reading the text (or watching, in the case of a film) is essential to developing an informed creative response. The more closely you read, the more confidently youâll be able to engage with the important ideas and textual elements necessary to take your creative from good to great.Â\n\nWhile reading the text for the first time, focus on developing your understanding and clarifying any uncertainty. I would recommend taking the time to read a plot summary before beginning on the text - this will allow you to go in with a reasonable idea of what to expect, and also provide a security net to minimise your likelihood of misunderstanding the plot.Â\n\nWhile reading the text once is sufficient, you will benefit from reading it twice. A second reading enables you to take the time to annotate key sections of the text and to further your initial understanding. If you choose to read the text a second time, pay extra attention to the themes and inner-workings of the text. This means reading between the lines and starting to form an analytical understanding of what the text is about, beyond surface ideas like plot and character.Â\n\nAnnotating the text (or note-taking, in the case of a film) is an important aspect of any academic reading. The key intention is to ensure your annotation approach is as convenient and accessible as possible. To achieve this, I suggest listing the key themes, allocating a different coloured highlighter to each, and colour-coding sections of the text which you think relate to each specific theme. This will give your annotating process more direction compared to the common approach of simply leaving notes in the margin, which may be time-consuming to read over later.Â\n\nI would also recommend making the most of coloured tabs - these enable you to immediately see the key sections of the text, rather than flicking through aimlessly. If you can colour-code these tabs according to the same key as your highlighters, youâll be able to instantly spot which sections correspond with which theme (and trust me, this will come in handy if you decide to replicate these themes in your own creative).\n\nAside from annotating the text itself, try to ensure that the notes you write are concise - not only will this save you time, but itâll mean you focus on condensing the key information. In turn, youâll have less material to sift through later on, giving you the ability to jump straight into planning and drafting your own piece. This video, How to effectively annotate your books for school! and this blog post, How to effectively annotate your texts in VCE will provide you with more helpful strategies to get the most out of annotating.â\n\nStep 2: Understand the World of the Text\n\nâRegardless of how many times you read the text, your understanding will be strengthened by seeking out resources to help you think about the text on a deeper level. A good starting point for this is to have a look for LSG blog posts and videos that are about your specific text.\n\nWatching or reading interviews with the author of the text is a fantastic way to hear directly about their intention in writing the text - after all, they are the single most authoritative source on the text. The goal here is to understand the authorâs intent (something weâll expand on in Chapter 8: Strengthening Your Creative) so that you can reflect this within your own writing. Focus on how the author explains certain aspects of their text, as well as any points they make about its context and background.Â\n\nAdditionally, peer discussions and asking questions in class will help you to further develop your understanding of the text and clarify any uncertainty. Seeing the text from anotherâs perspective will develop your knowledge beyond a superficial understanding of the text and introduce ideas you may not have otherwise considered.\n\nRemember to take notes as you go - these will be useful to reflect on later.â\n\nStep 3: Implement Your Understandingâ\n\nOkay, so youâve taken the time to read and annotate the text, and youâve sought out external resources to further develop your comprehension. Now we want to apply this understanding within a creative context. Reflect on what you know about the text. Think closely: What have you learnt about its context, characters, and themes? What elements of the text stand out? The goal here is to draw inspiration from the text and begin to think about which aspects of the text you might like to replicate within your creative piece. Begin to put together a shortlist to keep track of your ideas. The aim here is to develop a picture of the parts of the text you might decide to replicate in your own writing.Â\n\nAlthough understanding and replicating the text is important, if we were to only do this, your piece wouldnât have much creative flair or originality. Here, weâve taught you the âReplicateâ component of this strategy .

Sample A+Â Creative Response\n\nHere's a sample excerpt from a creative piece written by Taylah Russell, LSG tutor and 47 study scorer, in response to the short story 'Waiting' in Cate Kennedy's anthology, Like a House on Fire:\n\n\"The clinician presses forcefully into my lower abdomen, refusing to stop and accept my reality. The poor thing, deprived of such hopelessness as I, seems to honestly believe that the longer he agonises over finding something, the more likely it is that some form of life will appear. That those horoscopes in those grimy magazines, written by journalists whoâve probably been fired from their former reputable jobs, may actually hold some validity. I place my hands over my eyes, tentatively pressing against my eyelids, turning my surroundings a dark black and blocking the stream of water that has readied itself to spill when the time comes, when that young boy finally gives up and realises that his degree holds no value in providing me with happiness.\"\n\nAs we can see in this paragraph, the writer is replicating certain themes from the original text, such as grief. Additionally, this piece is written from the perspective of the original protagonist, which means that its characters and context are also directly inspired by Kennedy. Ultimately, by carrying across these text elements of theme, character, and context, the writer is able to clearly demonstrate an extensive knowledge of the text, while also showcasing their creativity.
