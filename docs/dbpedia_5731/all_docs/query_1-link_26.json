        "text": "I wasn’t familiar with Laura Mulvey or her Male Gaze theory until the show “Sex and the City.” I was talking about the latter with a friend of mine (we’ll call her Cindy) and my main reason for liking it. I liked the show, I said, not because I thought it was exceptional television, nor because it was a stellar example of feminism writ large on television.\n\n“The female characters,” I said. “It’s the first thing I’ve ever seen, in T.V. or film, where a woman isn’t being seen solely from the perspective of a male character.”\n\nCindy was, at the time, the director of a research organization that focused on the imagery of girls and women in film.\n\n“The Male Gaze,” Cindy said casually, assuming (as well she should have) that I knew the term. (I have always been a greater consumer of film itself over film theory or criticism.) Then, she explained it to me. The “Gaze” is a widely accepted cinematic theory is that female characters in film exist solely through the eyes of the male characters.\n\nIt’s far easier to make a list of films that are examples of the male gaze than not, especially for 20th century film and television. Women mostly are shot from the perspective of what Mulvey described as “the pleasure of the male viewer.” It’s in every movie you can name that’s worthy of praise, from the first simmering shot of the glorious Faye Dunaway in “Chinatown,” to anything and everything that the major studios made in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nName a film from any period before, say, the indie film bubble of the 90s and you’ll only name films whose female characters are in the gaze, films like “The Graduate,” “The Godfather,” “Raging Bull,” Hitch’s entire canon, “The Sound of Music,” “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” and…all of them. Literally every last one of them. Even in the rare instances in pre 1980-something cinema when the woman was the protagonist (and not a whore or a mother), she was typically transformed into the object of man’s desire.\n\nIt makes perfect sense why: men made everything. Women are only now starting to see a marginal increase in directing and producing roles. Female characters existed in the male gaze for understandable reasons: men were the ones making all the figurative and literal shots.\n\n90s Cinema: the Subtle Shift\n\nWhen you’re young, you’re not always aware when you’re witnessing a sea change. Gen X women are the children of the ERA movement, and our mothers were still mostly secretaries, teachers, and nurses. We were still seeing the world through a male-dominated experience because that’s all there was. (For some perspective: in the 1980s, all of two women served in the U.S. Senate, and five as governors, total, for an entire decade.)\n\nThere was a lot of talk about women being equal that started during my lifetime and has been evolving, albeit slowly. In the 1990s, the independent spirit born in the 1970s with films like “Easy Rider” matured into a cottage industry, and with it, a new generation of filmmakers who saw the world, and taught me to see the world, differently. Granted, they were mostly men, but they were unquestionably feminists.\n\nMike Leigh was one. His early work with the BBC, including the great “Abigail’s Party” is about British class struggle. His women aren’t so much as driven by men in his work, but are drivers right along with his male characters. They are by no means perfect, but here’s the thing: nor are they pretty for the sake of it. They are human, flawed, at times helpless victims of their environment, snowed under by a world that doesn’t see their pain. Leigh, though, always sees their pain, and puts their struggle on par with any man in any of his extraordinary films.\n\nI learned to love Leigh when I saw “Life is Sweet,” his 1991 ensemble comedy that featured a heavy hitting cast of actors who would almost all go on to become hugely successful including Jim Broadbent, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Stephean Rea and the transcendent Jane Horrocks (of “Absolutely Fabulous” fame). It was Horrocks who touched me, as a fractured, young, loveable but nearly hopeless unemployed 20-something with an eating disorder.\n\nIn Leigh’s universe, Horrock’s Nicola isn’t saved by a her male lover (played with sensitivity and originality by a very young Thewlis), but by her twin sister, the very tomboyish Natalie. The film doesn’t even really suggest, ever, that it’s rescuing that Nicola needs so much as witnessing, which her sister attempts to provide in one of the film’s tenderest scenes (clock in for it here at about the five-minute mark; please police your own spoilers from here on out).\n\nThe moment is short, and, not insignificantly, the film’s last. I don’t think I’d ever seen a movie before where the film closes on the image of two relatively awkward-looking girls, only with each other for company, without the promise of a man lurking on the horizon. Yet, the moment is hopeful, and loving, and cements the film’s statements about the strength of women’s relationships. It’s a statement Leigh echos throughout his career and in countless other films like “Secrets and Lies,” “Career Girls,” and, of course, “Vera Drake.”\n\nLeigh camera doesn’t gaze upon his women so much sees them, and so his audience sees them, too. It’s the kind of cinema that I would grow to love. Because of its relative rarity even in the 90s, even with the burgeoning popularity of indie films, when I saw it: I appreciated it and rarely forgot it.\n\nI saw it in Todd Hayne’s still incredible “Safe,” his first collaboration with Julianne Moore which garnered her considerable critical acclaim. In 1995, it was easy enough to count the number of films in which women starred that weren’t romantic comedies on a single hand. Moore’s Carol White is an enigma both to herself and the audience. She is attractive, but decidedly unglamorous. She is sympathetic and somewhat unlikeable. Haynes easily could have capitulated to Moore’s considerable beauty, as he would later in “Far from Heaven.”\n\nCarol is something completely unforgivable in American cinema: she is plain.\n\nCarol never gets a makeover. She never blossoms. The film isn’t concerned with her sexuality. Haynes doesn’t cover Moore’s blemishes or freckles, and with those natural imperfections, he gives us one of the rawest female characters of the decade.\n\nI loved P.T. Anderson’s “Boogie Nights” (another film featuring a staggeringly good Julianne Moore) because of its women. In “Nights,” eroticism is somehow taken off the table entirely, even though it’s about porn. In Anderson’s lens, sex is surgical and particularly unsexy. These women aren’t so much objects of desire, but victims of it.\n\nMoore and Heather Graham (pictured above as Rollergirl) are simultaneously central characters and no one’s love interest. Sure, Moore’s Amber Waves has a bit of a fling with Mark Wahlberg’s Dirk, but that relationship is more awkward than it is sexually gratifying for either of them. Their sex is symbolic of an era and a culture, rather than romantic. With these characters, Anderson, in a sense, indicts his own audience for their own participation in Amber and Rollergirl’s downfall.\n\nThis film is not about its women, to be clear. It’s about it’s central male character and his likely involvement in the real-world murder on which the film, and that character, are based. However, I’d never seen a moment like this, either, where two women, unattached to men, come completely unhinged in front of no one but each other:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f4gZTQhgTM\n\nThis scene from 1997 may play as provincial now. Certainly, it is far less remarkable by today’s standards. Which is my point: it was so unusual in mid 90s America that I couldn’t, as a woman (who was also making a film at the time), forget it. But there is a singular piece of cinematic masterpiece from that same era that deserves a cavalcade of praise for its lead actor, narrative singularity, and groundbreaking storytelling.\n\nFargo: the Game Changer\n\nLooking at it today, if you were too young (or not born) to appreciate the magnificent contribution the Coen brothers made with their masterwork “Fargo”, it’s challenging to put its significance in context. American movies, certainly not Hollywood, had ever seen a protagonist like Frances McDormand’s Marge Gunderson. It would take until 1996 for Hollywood to deliver a female hero (a pregnant one no less) whose sexuality is irrelevant to her success.\n\nMarge is a lot of things. She is the chief of police in her small town. She is rational, competent, and fair. She is unquestionably brave, moral, and heroic. She is the counterpoint to the film’s bad guy, a moral black hole played with exceptional control and economy by a then relatively unknown William H. Macy. Where Macy’s Jerry Lundergaard is petty, selfish, greedy, and foolish, Marge is smart, giving, and the film’s authority on goodness. Marge is the classic hero, by the most literal definition.\n\nMcDormand is stellar in the role, and her Best Actress Academy Award was a given that year. The narrative choice of how this character is written, though, is not the point. It’s how she is filmed that’s relevant here. She is never, not once, sexualized. The visual storytelling of the movie exists outside the notion that Marge needs to be sexy. It’s impossible to understate how rare this was (and to some degree, still is in narrative American cinema).\n\nIt is only during one chilling scene where she is suddenly objectified. However, her strange encounter with a lost friend, Steve Park playing the pathological Mike Yanagita, a deranged oddball from Marge’s high school days, creates a staggering contrast about women and desire in the film. Marge flanks his advances with precision and strength. The film is almost challenging its audience to see her differently by suddenly reminding the viewer that the world may see her as anything but an authority figure.\n\nHer femaleness and the way she is depicted goes beyond narrative. In 1996, women in film were not covered head to toe in a parka during most of the film. Most directors would have recast their lead if she were pregnant (even if that actor were the filmmaker’s wife) instead of embracing the imagery of it. Marge’s pregnancy defies the myth (propagated successfully by directors like James Cameron with films like “Terminator 2”) that to be strong, a woman must be male-like.\n\nMarge is defined by her womanness and her strength without the camera idling on her beauty. She is feminine without being beguiling. She is powerful without sacrificing the humble nature of her character. 1996, as it turns out, was a decent year for U.S. cinema. “Slingblade”, “The English Patient”, “Scream”, and “Bound” all came out that year. Scanning down the list, though, you can still quite literally count the number of films with a female lead (Madonna’s questionable turn as Evita happened that year, too) on one hand; most of those films are affixed and defined by the conceit of the male’s perspective.\n\nFargo marked a significant sea change in how women were depicted and framed. While the male gaze lived on (and lives on) throughout 90s cinema, the then burgeoning cable T.V. industry would change it forever.\n\nSex and the City: Shifting Past the Male Gaze in the 21st Century\n\nSex and the City is surely a show about how women feel about men. These women were all straight (except for Samantha’s brief flirtation with lesbianism), and the show was, at its core, a sitcom about dating and relationships. From the storytelling perspective, that may not be all that remarkable. While we can argue all day about whether or not the show defined, or defied, third-wave feminism, it was the show’s perspective that was altogether groundbreaking.\n\nAlthough SATC was produced by two men, it endowed its four female leads with certain aspects of masculinity. That is: they were the hunters, they were the seekers of their own desires. It was the women doing the hunting, and therefore, the seeing, rather than the other way around. We didn’t see Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Miranda though anyone’s gaze but their own. Because Carrie is always our omniscient narrator, she is our gaze, taking us through her sexual misadventures those of her three friends.\n\nThe show was careful, whether this was purposeful or not, to maintain a point of view from the women and never towards them. Audiences, at least American audiences, had never seen women from this perspective, not in television and certainly not in film, or for this duration. This is less true of live audience sitcoms, but even those are few and far between. The Mary Tyler Moore Show, for example, was a workplace comedy where the woman was clearly the most competent and the defacto leader. Because Moore was a three-camera sitcom, POV was irrelevant (although its subject matter, from a feminist perspective, is anything but).\n\nSATC’s significance has everything to with the fact that it was filmed on location, making it a very cinematic show (style-breaking in its own right outside of the narrative or subject matter). The show was at the vanguard of a lot of things: a new wave of critically-acclaimed, prestige television; the rise of cable T.V. networks; the shift from three-camera sitcoms to filmed comedies; and a welcome change from male-dominated imagery in film and television.\n\nTo shift away from the male gaze necessitates a shift in both narrative and style. Narratives with female leads who exist outside of their relationships to a male protagonist are as important as how those female leads are presented. SATC is far from a perfect show, but it stands alone as a show about and told from the perspective, both dramatically and visually, of women.\n\nEnd of the Gaze? Well, No, But…\n\nIn preparing to write this article, I started making a list of films and television that were noteworthy for their imagery of women. It’s long. It’s too long to include here, at any rate. While women still have a lot of headway to make as producers, directors, and writers, the last several years has seen an all out revolution in how female characters are featured.\n\nLet’s take the estimable Denis Villeneuve and his considerable skill as a director. There is a moment in his excellent Sicario when Emily Blunt, an FBI agent, enters a room full of what she assumes to be CIA and DEA agents. She is a fish out of water. We see the room from her eyes, full of secrecy, shadows, and danger. The camera frames her, and while the moment is about her outsider status (and all the danger that implies), it’s impossible not to make a correlation about women in a male-dominated workplace.\n\nThe film visually constantly isolates her as both a character and a female heroine, mostly keeping her at the back of the line of armed and informed men. She is visually left in the dark often. She is constantly in danger. She is never, though, not for five seconds in the film ever visualized through the eyes of another male character. The film would still be propulsive, enthralling and a bold statement on the failed war on drugs without her (or a woman) in the lead. With Blunt playing the central role, however, the film represents a new wave of compelling, complicated, female protagonists.\n\n“American Honey” probably wouldn’t have been made in the 90s. As far as its story, it’s a bit of a standalone. It stars a young woman of color (breakout star Sasha Lane), an almost non-starter for indie films pre this decade. Also: it’s a road film. Road films starring women are few and far between as it is, let alone one with a young woman of color in the lead role.\n\nThe film is hard to describe, as it’s singular in its frank subject matter and perspective. Its protagonist, Star, is a beauty, and she surely knows this. The film is not optimistic, in any way, about her, or America’s, future. It’s not how the film sees her that is striking; it’s shot mostly from her vantage, her scarred and traumatized perspective, a perspective haunts the film’s visual storytelling.\n\nBritish director Andrea Arnold and her film won the 2016 Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival (one of three of those she’s taken home). “Honey” is quirky and dark. It’s troubling and touching. Star struggles throughout the film to find her footing amongst the strange group of travelers she’s found herself caught up in. ‘Honey” deserves heaps of kudos for its diversity outside of Star, with a cast of young newcomers that is so kaleidoscopic, they look visually jarring against the backdrop of the white suburbs where they spend their days selling magazine subscriptions door to door.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the head of this merry, ragtag, band (a modern take on Neverland?) is also a woman, played to searing perfection by Riley Keough. Her character is a man killer, though still a welcome twist on the typical male predator. She is also relatively young, unabashedly greedy, and cruelly manipulative. Cinema needs villains as much as it needs heroes. This film, refreshingly, casts women in both roles without either of them existing inside of the lens of any man’s desire.\n\nWhen complex women fill the frame, the frame naturally has to change. The story, and subsequent imagery, could devolve into a battle between Keough’s Krystal and Lane’s Star for the affections of Jake (Shia LeBeouf). To an extent, that is a driving force in the film visually and narratively. Its director respects its characters too much for that, however, and the resulting film is singular in its achievement as a female coming of age story.\n\nMy list goes on…and on. Some more examples: because there are women directing episodes of the HBO series “The Deuce”, its visual depiction of women is complex and harrowing. Speaking of that network, “Big Little Lies”, a complicated tale of white female privilege, is saturated in fascinating and complicated visual storytelling about its mostly middle-aged cast. While I personally find the film “Winter’s Bone” to be a bit clumsy and sentimental, it deserves heaps of credit for its gritty heroine and gripping performance from Jennifer Lawrence (for which she got her first Oscar nomination). Of course, “Orange is the New Black” deserves the heaps and piles of praise it’s received for cramming as many complicated and fascinating women as it can get into every single season, episode, and shot.\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” is a woman’s movie, an epic that defies the male gaze at every turn. It’s male lead (Tom Hardy as the rebooted Max) is literally a passenger in this story, with Charlize Theron the figurative (and literal) driver. There were discussions up and down the internet the summer it was released of whether or not the film was indeed a feminist story (I happen to think, for the record, it very much is). The entire narrative is about a woman’s quest for liberation. When the camera alights on the many, many actresses in the cast, they are so far beyond the male gaze, it smashes it entirely. Only once do we really gaze upon Theron through the loving perspective of Max, and she looks like this:\n\nHe is literally gazing up at her, too, as he disappears into the crowd below the victorious Furiosa. This shot is the first time we feel his longing, his respect, and his gratitude. It doesn’t matter if it’s love or not. That’s not the question the film wants us to ponder. The film demands that we see her, this battered, torn up woman, as its, and yes his, hero.\n\nIt has become one of my very favorite images in cinema, maybe ever, for that very reason.\n\nProgress is still too slow in the arena of narrative cinema when it comes to women behind the camera. This list assembled by metacritic of the 25 best reviewed films directed by women mostly features documentaries (and two of the films included are cartoons). Surely, a list of films directed by men would almost solely feature narratives and not docs. That shows how rare films helmed by women remain. We should all remain very troubled by the male-driven statistics that plague the business of film.\n\nThe world of storytelling is still very much dominated by men, and for men. The tide, however, is shifting. Audiences have higher expectations for women characters and directors have broader imaginations. I never thought I’d live to see the day. I’m grateful and excited that I have."
