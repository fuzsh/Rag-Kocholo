        "text": "These are the highest-grossing, primarily non-English language films in the world. The vast majority of highest-grossing non-English titles are in Chinese.\n\nIn terms of gross revenue, English-language films are vastly over-represented among the highest-grossing films of all time. Among the top 100 highest-grossing films, 97 of them are in English, with the other three being the Chinese films The Battle at Lake Changjin, Wolf Warrior 2 and Hi, Mom.[1]\n\nOne factor behind the relative financial success of English-language films is because of the function of the English language as the world's lingua franca. It is the first language of 400 million people, the second language of another 400 million, and a foreign language of an additional 700 million. It is thus understood by 1.5 billion people, which is almost 20% of the world population. The Chinese language, especially the standard variant, has over twice as many native speakers as English, but much fewer foreign-language speakers.[3]\n\nAnother major factor is the difference in cinema box office ticket prices around the world, with developing countries and newly industrialized countries having lower ticket prices than developed countries, due to lower currency value, less average income and lower living costs.[4] A number of Chinese, Indian and Soviet films sold more than 100 million tickets at the box office,[5][7] but at relatively low ticket prices compared to Hollywood films[5][8] and thus limiting the amount of gross revenue generated.[5] Up until the 1990s, US and UK ticket prices were significantly greater than Chinese, Indian and Soviet ticket prices.[a] As of 2017 , the average cinema ticket price was $9 in the United States,[9] compared to CN¥35 ($5.10) in China[10] and ₹134.38 ($2.06) in India.[11]\n\nAs of 2022, the world's largest market in terms of box office admissions is India.[12] The former Soviet Union (before it dissolved in 1991) had a similarly large box office market,[13] with relatively lower ticket prices than North America due to lower living costs.[8] Indian films had a large overseas audience in the Soviet Union between the 1950s and 1980s,[14] and were significantly more popular than Hollywood films there.[15][16]\n\n† indicates films playing in the week commencing 9 August 2024 in theaters around the world.\n\nTop 50 highest-grossing films that are not primarily in the English language Rank English title[b] Original title Primary\n\nlanguage(s)[c] Country\n\nof origin Worldwide\n\ngross (in US$) Year Ref 1 The Battle at Lake Changjin 长津湖 Mandarin China $913,000,000 2021 [17][18] 2 Wolf Warrior 2 战狼2 Mandarin[19][20][21] China $870,325,439 2017 [22] 3 Hi, Mom 你好，李焕英 Mandarin China $841,674,419 2021 [23] 4 Ne Zha 哪吒之魔童降世 Mandarin China $742,718,496 2019 [24] 5 The Wandering Earth 流浪地球 Mandarin China $699,992,512 2019 [25] 6 Detective Chinatown 3 唐人街探案3 Mandarin China $686,257,563 2021 [26] 7 Full River Red 满江红 Mandarin China $673,552,250 2023 [27] 8 The Battle at Lake Changjin II 长津湖之水门桥 Mandarin China $626,571,697 2022 [28][29] 9 The Passion of the Christ The Passion of the Christ United States $612,054,506 2004 [30] 10 The Wandering Earth 2 流浪地球2 Mandarin China $603,971,973 2023 [31] 11 Operation Red Sea 红海行动\n\nMandarin\n\nArabic\n\nChina $579,330,426 2018 [32] 12 The Mermaid 美人鱼 Mandarin\n\nChina\n\nHong Kong\n\n$553,810,228 2016 [33] 13 Detective Chinatown 2 唐人街探案2 Mandarin China $544,185,156 2018 [34] 14 Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train 劇場版「鬼滅の刃」 無限列車編 Japanese Japan $507,127,293 2020 [35] 15 No More Bets 孤注一掷 Mandarin China $541,001,696 2023 [36] 16 Lost in the Stars 消失的她\n\nMandarin\n\nThai\n\nChina $488,719,815 2023 [37] 17 YOLO 热辣滚烫 Mandarin China $479,597,304 2024 [38] 18 Pegasus 2 飞驰人生2;

This list varies from revenue-based rankings due to the huge difference in the price of admission tickets from place to place as well as from one moment in time to another.\n\nThe following table lists known estimated box office ticket sales for various high-grossing non-English films that have sold at least 100 million tickets worldwide.\n\nNote: Some of the data are incomplete due to a lack of available admissions data from a number of countries.
