        "text": "HIST 11004. Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations III: South Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore major themes in the history of women, gender, and sexuality in modern South Asia. We will address reform, legislation, nationalism, and rights discourses across periods of colonialism and independence in the nineteenth and twentieth century. This includes examining how colonial reforms and criminal codes impacted women with respect to education, marriage, abortion, infanticide, and prostitution, as well as how laws targeted gender expression and criminalized forms of queerness. In independent South Asia, we will consider the development of gender and queer rights discourses and how these have been shaped by the politics of patriarchy, religion, caste, and class. We will also examine instances of gendered and sexual violence during moments of rupture such as the Partition of India and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Students in this course will draw on a range of primary and secondary texts across written and visual mediums to critically think about the place of women and gender/sexual minorities and their expressions of resilience and defiance in modern South Asia.\n\nInstructor(s): Zoya Sameen Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This is an optional 3rd quarter of GNSE Civ. Students must have taken the first two quarters to be able to count this as a Core class.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 15005, GNSE 15005\n\nHIST 11301. Global British Empire to 1784: War, Commerce, and Revolution. 100 Units.\n\nThis course traces the origins, development, and revolutionary transformation of the British Empire. Students will explore the English Civil War, King Philip's War, Bacon's Rebellion, the development of slavery, the Revolution of 1688, the making of British India, the rise of Irish discontent, the Scottish Jacobite Rebellions, the causes of the American Revolution, and the transformation of the British Empire into an authoritarian state. Students will read selections from Locke, Defoe, Swift, Franklin, Burke, and many others.\n\nInstructor(s): S. Pincus Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Assignments: one short paper, a classroom presentation, and one longer research-based paper.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DEMS 11301\n\nHIST 11703. Jewish Spaces and Places, Imagined and Real. 100 Units.\n\nWhat makes a ghetto, a ghetto? What defines a Jewish neighborhood? What determined the architectural form of synagogues? Taught in Special Collections in Regenstein Library and making extensive use of the textual and visual sources there, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. Sources will include: Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides. We may also take a field trip to the Oak Woods Cemetery. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa and the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures and texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues. Assignments include: presentations (individual or collaborative), short papers, Canvas postings, and there will also be the option of making a digital map or an on-line exhibition. This is a limited-enrollment, discussion-based course. No previous knowledge of Jewish history is expected.\n\nInstructor(s): Leora Auslander Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): In order for a Spring course to qualify as a civilization course for the general education requirement, the student must also take Jewish Civilization I and II. A Spring course, however, may also be taken as an independent elective.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 22015, JWSC 12006, NEHC 12006\n\nHIST 12203. Italian Renaissance: Petrarch, Machiavelli, and the Wars of Popes and Kings. 100 Units.\n\nFlorence, Rome, and the Italian city-states in the age of plagues and cathedrals, Petrarch and Machiavelli, Medici and Borgia (1250-1600), with a focus on literature, philosophy, primary sources, the revival of antiquity, and the papacy's entanglement with pan-European politics. We will examine humanism, patronage, politics, corruption, assassination, feuds, art, music, magic, censorship, education, science, heresy, and the roots of the Reformation. Writing assignments focus on higher level writing skills, with a creative writing component linked to our in-class role-played reenactment of a Renaissance papal election (LARP). First-year students and non-History majors welcome.\n\nInstructor(s): A. Palmer Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Graduate students by consent only; register for the course as HIST 90000 Reading and Research: History.\n\nNote(s): Assignments: short papers, alternative projects.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 22203, FNDL 22204, KNOW 12203, MDVL 12203, CLCV 22216, ITAL 16000, RENS 12203, SIGN 26034\n\nHIST 12706. Diaspora(s) 100 Units.\n\nThis class will orient students to the practices, frameworks, and geographies of diasporic communities from the early modern period to the present. The term's initial origins in Jewish experiences of forced dispersal and migration underscores how its meaning is shaped by histories of collective displacement and loss, as well as invention and heritage. The discourse of diaspora remains foundational for several interdisciplinary fields, including Black studies, Asian American studies, Indigenous studies, Latinx studies, and more. Within these intellectual orientations, diasporic identities are notably expansive and unfixed. As observed by the late cultural theorist Stuart Hall, \"diaspora identities are those which are constantly producing and reproducing themselves anew, through transformation and difference,\" bridging old and new traditions of worldmaking, resistance, and solidarities within and across distinct diasporic sensibilities.\" Students in this class will work with scholarly, literary, sonic, and visual materials demonstrating how use of diaspora alternately mobilizes and roots people, in ways that claim pasts and futures at once.\n\nInstructor(s): Adom Getachew Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 12200, CRES 12700, PLSC 22200, GLST 22700\n\nHIST 13802. The Russian Empire. 100 Units.\n\nEmpire is back in contemporary Russia. Old imperial insignia have replaced hammers and sickles on government buildings, the bodies of the last tsar and his family have been exhumed and venerated, and Putin's foreign policy stakes imperial claims on the nations on Russia's border. This course examines what the Russian empire was, how it worked, and the legacies that it left behind. Themes to be considered include the culture of the autocracy and the tradition of reform from above; imperial expansion and multiethnic society; the construction of class, ethnic, and estate identities; and the causes and consequences of the Old Regime's collapse. Mondays and Wednesdays are reserved for lectures, Fridays for discussion. Note(s): First-year students warmly welcomed; no prior Russian history, culture, or language assumed. Equivalent Course(s): REES 13802\n\nInstructor(s): F. Hillis Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): First-year students warmly welcomed; no prior Russian history, culture, or language assumed.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 13802, DEMS 13802\n\nHIST 14504. The History of Everyday in Modern Korea. 100 Units.\n\nEveryday\" is easily perceived as too trivial to discuss its importance or mundane to have no historical value. In contrast, postcolonial, postmodern, poststructural, and even posthuman seem to have attempted to deconstruct pre-existing systems, social structures, our relationships with other people, objects (either living or not living), environment, and cultures (from ideology to affects, you name it). Yet, what we easily call macro-level or meta-narratives feels too heavy to lift. We will try to learn how to fill the gap between abstract and concrete and try to understand history as something specific and commonplace: Everyday. Using modern Korea as a lens, this course will address topics related to everyday-from what we do everyday (housing, eating, and clothes) to how we do everyday (earning, spending, meeting, thinking, feeling, etc.) How does food reflect the history of any society's culture? What historical situations have created so-called \"the Apartment Republic\" in South Korea? Why did the Korean public become crazy about dancing in the 1950s? How has SPAM become a popular holiday gift set? Likewise, we can ask various questions about our notions of everydayness and discuss the multiple meanings of everydayness, the politics of everyday, and its relationships in modern Korean History.\n\nInstructor(s): E. Park Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 14504\n\nHIST 14601. Twentieth-Century China through Great Trials. 100 Units.\n\nThis course surveys China's turbulent twentieth century through the lens of great trials. From communist show trials to international courts, from struggle sessions to investigative journalism, and from trial by mob to trial by media, students will witness public and private \"justice\" in action both in and beyond the courtroom and across the long century's radically different governmental regimes. Our view of China will explore both the sweeping events of revolution and individual experiences. There is no prerequisite for this course.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Ransmeier Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 14601, LLSO 24600\n\nHIST 14602. Production and Reproduction: Women in Modern China, Japan, and Korea. 100 Units.\n\nThe course introduces both women's history and theories concerning production and reproduction in modern China, Japan, and Korea. By bringing both production and reproduction into the discussion, the course extends the definition of \"work\" from workplaces to households, from formal work settings to informalities. We will read and analyze women's economic engagements in different contexts and localities (e.g. factories, households, political mobilizations, global trade, and sex work) together with scholarships from socio-economic historians, anthropologists, and feminist scholars. Historians have provided a broad chronological framework and empirical studies, such as the birth of feminist movements in twentieth-century East Asia, the pattern of gendered and highly specialized economic development, and women's work as handicraft makers, factory employers, and sex workers. Anthropologists have established such analytical categories as \"skill,\" \"practical knowledge,\" and \"gynotechnics\" that were largely overlooked when discussing women's work. Recent Marxist feminist scholars have extended Marxist examination of value to female labor, and contributed to our understanding of social reproduction by theorizing capitalism and its supporting system. With different concepts and frameworks, students are encouraged to reassess the complex meanings of differences outside of contemporary Western feminist theories.\n\nInstructor(s): Yuanxie Shi Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 14750, GNSE 12129\n\nHIST 17000. Myth and Its Critics. 100 Units.\n\nMyth is essential to how humans make sense of the world: our foundational stories explain the nature of the world; they justify and explore social and sexual difference; they teach and test the limits of human agency. The course will survey contexts and uses of myth-making in the ancient Mediterranean world. We will also explore the many traditions of critique and anxiety about myth-making, among philosophers, literary critics and religious authorities.\n\nInstructor(s): Carolina López-Ruiz Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CLCV 15000, RLST 28498, SIGN 26037\n\nHIST 17206. The United States in the 21st Century. 100 Units.\n\nThis discussion-based common-year seminar is open to first- and second-year students interested in the discipline of history. The ambition of the course is to offer a \"history of the present\" of the United States. When does history give way to the present? When does the present become the proper subject of history? Asking these questions, the course underscores the ability of the historical method to find interconnections among subjects, whether it is culture, economy, climate, society, or politics, often kept separate by other disciplines. Topics covered will include: the US-led globalization of the turn of the second millennium and its fate; 9/11 and the War on Iraq; the rise of genomic science; transformations of identity, including gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity; the economic origins and aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession; the elections of Obama and Trump; the birth of social media; the problem of climate change; the future of American democracy. Course materials will include political speeches, fiction and nonfiction books and essays, works of scholarship, film, music, and other media.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Levy Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CCCT 17206\n\nHIST 17800. Formations of Indigeneity. 100 Units.\n\nWhose land are we on? What does it mean to be Indigenous, for generations past and in the twenty-first century? From debates over claims of Indigenous ancestry by political actors to the struggles of sacred lands protection against natural resource extraction, understanding the stakes of these concerns for Indigenous peoples and nations is more relevant than ever. This seminar-part of the sequence for majors in the Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity-introduces students to core texts and concepts in the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS). Topics will include sovereignty and governance, settler colonialism, citizenship and nationhood, blood quantum and racialization, diasporas and urban indigeneity, and relationships to land and environment. Course activities may include engagement with Indigenous films, dialogues with visiting Indigenous scholars, and field trips to Chicago-area cultural institutions.\n\nInstructor(s): Teresa Montoya and Matthew Kruer Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 12300, CRES 12800, CHST 12300, ANTH 12800\n\nHIST 18101. Democracy in America? 100 Units.\n\nIs the United States a democracy? Has it ever been? Why has the concept of democracy-as genuine ideal or false idol-been so central to Americans' self-understanding, and so constitutive of their politics? Throughout its past, the United States has been defined by endless and unpredictable struggles to establish and extend self-government of one kind or another-even as those struggles have encountered great resistance and relied on the exclusion or subordination of some portion of society to underwrite expanding freedom and equality for those enjoying the fullest benefits of citizenship. Indeed, for most of US history the right to self-government was not exercised by most people, and its denial was at times justified in the name of openly undemocratic ideals, including elite wisdom, male prerogative, slavery, empire, and economic efficiency. The enemies of democracy have been just as determined as-and perhaps better endowed than-its advocates. Yet at critical junctures in US history, citizenship and political life have expanded to articulate the meaning and practice of self-government anew. In this class we will critically examine these junctures using empirical case studies and classic works of US political philosophy in order to uncover the historical realities lurking behind enduring statements of democratic principle.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Sparrow Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): 1st and 2nd years get preference\n\nNote(s): Assignments: a short essay, a presentation, discussion thread entries, and a final research paper.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DEMS 18101, LLSO 28101\n\nHIST 18405. Histories of Native America. 100 Units.\n\nModern Americans often think of their history beginning with the European discovery of the \"New World.\" But those Europeans did not \"discover\" anything. In the Americas, they encountered an Old World filled with diverse Indigenous peoples, cultures, and polities; a world alive with its own dynamic histories. This courses explores the world of Native North America from the evolution of complex city-states in the centuries before European invasion to the seismic changes that Indigenous peoples have navigated in the era of colonization (1492-present). Topics include Native struggles to create a shared world with settlers in the seventeenth century; movements to maintain independence from European empires and the new United States; nineteenth-century experiences of conquest, removal, confinement to reservations, and coercive assimilation; twentieth-century resurgence, battles in the courts, and \"Red Power\" activism; and twenty-first century struggles for sovereignty, self-determination, and environmental justice. Students will engage with a variety of primary and secondary sources, focusing on texts produced by Native people and centering Native points of view.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Kruer Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 18405\n\nHIST 18503. Consent in American Life. 100 Units.\n\nConsent brims with possibility. It is an ethic, a legal principle, a physical act, and a measuring stick of social capacity and interaction. It can express enthusiasm or ambivalence or a range of other conflicting emotions, and enable human flourishing or suffering. This course explores the history of consent in the United States across these vast terrains, and seeks to understand how gendered and sexual bodies have served as the anchor for consent despite its many meanings, ambiguities, and contradictions. We will examine debates over consent-and consenting or non-consenting bodies­-in various realms of life: sex, marriage, labor, medicine, consumption, visual culture, and the social sciences, among others. We will consider how and why consent differs from its conceptual cousins, such as choice or free will, and discuss the historical, ethical, and political challenges of studying and writing about consent.\n\nInstructor(s): Evelyn Kessler Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This course counts as a Foundations course for GNSE majors\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 12133\n\nHIST 18702. Race, Politics, and Sports in the United States. 100 Units.\n\nThis lecture-discussion course explores how racial identity has been experienced, represented, and contested throughout American history. We will examine the major historical transformations that have shaped the development and understanding of racial identity, by engaging historical, legal, literary, and filmic texts. A diverse set of primary sources will be read against historical works. Moving along both chronological and thematic axes, themes of ambiguous, hidden, and hybrid identity will be critical to investigate the problems of racial mixture, mixed-race identity, racial passing, and racial performance across historical periods. The interplay of the problems of class and gender in the construction of racial identity will also be explored.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Briones Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): History in the World courses use history as a valuable tool to help students critically exam our society, culture, and politics. Preference given to 1st- and 2nd-yr students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 18702\n\nHIST 18808. Asian American History through the Novel. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the interwoven histories of migration, language, and identity formation and re-formation in Asian American experience. How are migrant and diasporic identities represented in fictional (or quasi-fictional) terms? How have factors such as race, religion, class, gender, and sexuality shaped everyday Asian American life? Course readings consist primarily of novels, representing a variety of Asian ethnicities and experiences, by writers of Chinese, Filipina/o, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese descent. These works are supplemented by selected historical documents and short lectures to shed additional light onto the sociohistorical contexts under study.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Kubler\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 18808, GNSE 18808\n\nHIST 19902. Workers of the World: Global Labor History, 1600-present. 100 Units.\n\nWorkers of the world, unite!\" But who are the workers of the world? Why would such a diverse group be considered as one? In this class, we look at the making of the modern world from below, through the perspectives, experiences, and movements of those who worked the plantations, mills, mines, and households where capitalism was forged. How did diverse experiences of free and unfree labor relate to each other? What have been the historical relationships between class, gender, race, and nationality? How have workers' movements related to the great ideological struggles between liberalism, socialism, fascism, and colonialism? We will both study the social history and political economy of work-who did what jobs where, when, under what circumstances?-and the efforts to make common political meaning out of those diverse experiences of work.\n\nInstructor(s): G. Winant Terms Offered: Spring\n\nHIST 20007. Africa in the Middle East and the Middle East in Africa. 100 Units.\n\nFrom Mansa Musa's Hajj in 1324 to the contemporary Afrobeats scene in Dubai, African and Middle Eastern societies share long histories of interconnection. This course examines these interconnections from the early modern to the contemporary era through a series of case studies ranging from traditions of exchange on the Swahili Coast, to the Ottoman Scramble for Africa, to the creation of a long-standing Lebanese diaspora in West Africa and a more recent Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel. Students will examine debates that animate this field of scholarship including conversations about race; histories of slavery and its legacies; conceptions of indigeneity, nativism, and settler colonialism; religious encounters; gender and society; shared and divergent experiences of European colonialism and struggles for independence; and transnational collective-building projects such as Pan-Africanism and Pan-Arabism. In addition to scholarship based on textual analysis, students will develop skills to investigate cultural sources such as music, photography, film, fashion, literature, and sports. No prior coursework in Middle Eastern or African studies is required. However, a background in African Civ, Islamic History and Society Civ, or Islamic Thought and Literature Civ is recommended.\n\nInstructor(s): K. Hickerson Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Assignments: Short papers; long paper; in-class presentation\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 20007, GNSE 20007\n\nHIST 20008. East Africa and the Indian Ocean. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the long history of East Africa in the Indian Ocean world. Areas of concentration will include trade and cultural interaction with the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, new dynamics in the context of European colonization, and East Africa's important place in decolonization and the Non-Aligned Movement. Along the way, we will ask some broad questions about the region. How are societies formed through processes of migration and interaction? What dynamics bind people together as distinct communities, and what factors lead them to break apart? How have ideas about gender and sex changed over time in East Africa? How are all these matters shaped by religion and cosmology? East African lives were shaped by forces external to the continent - but East Africans shaped those forces too. Along the way, we will analyze a wide variety of materials and viewpoints, including ones that are not conventionally used to tell stories about the past. These include archaeology, linguistics, oral traditions, environmental sources, written and archival materials, life histories, and visual and performed art.\n\nInstructor(s): Daly Samuel Fury Childs Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nHIST 20091. Field Archaeology. 100 Units.\n\nThis course entails four weeks of full-time, hands-on training in field archaeology in an excavation directed by a University of Chicago faculty member. At the Tell Keisan site in Israel, students will learn techniques of excavation and digital recording of the finds; attend evening lectures; and participate in weekend field trips. Academic requirements include the completion of assigned readings and a final written examination. For more information about this archaeological field opportunity in Summer 2020, see http://keisan.uchicago.edu. Students who are enrolled in this course will pay a Summer Session tuition fee in addition to the cost of participation in the dig. UChicago College students are eligible to apply for College Research Scholar grants to fund their participation.\n\nInstructor(s): David Schloen\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEAA 20091, CLCV 20091, ANTH 26612, CLAS 30091\n\nHIST 20205. Race in African History. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the category of race in African history from the nineteenth century to the contemporary era. It references the legacies of earlier identity constructions in the creation of these categories, as well as analyzing its transnational and trans-imperial dimensions. The class combines intellectual, cultural, and social history to illuminate the actors, encounters, and debates animating this dynamic field of study-moving beyond assumptions of African societies as spaces of ethnic-and not racialized-identities to examine the construction of difference through transnational history of science, gender and sexuality studies, histories of slavery, Middle Eastern colonial projects, as well as the invention of the category of \"native\" in European colonial discourse. Are categories of differences primarily due to European colonialism, as many claim? Or are they embedded in a more complex configuration coming from settler colonial projects, national liberation struggles, and postcolonial nativist discourses? Students examine case studies from across the continent-from Ghana to Sudan to South Africa-paying close attention to experiences of Asian, Arab, and mixed-race peoples navigating colonial and postcolonial African states; while keeping an eye on how debates about difference, diaspora, and nationalism in North America and Europe inform discussions of race in Africa, and how Africans shape discourses of race in colonial metropoles and the United States.\n\nInstructor(s): K. Hickerson Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Students who have not take African Civiliizations I, II, and III are asked to read African History: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2007) in preparation for this course.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIPS 20205, GNSE 22225, CRES 20205\n\nHIST 20509. Collecting the Ancient World: Museum Practice and Politics. 100 Units.\n\nWhere is this artifact from? Who does it belong to? How did it get here? Who's telling its story? Critical inquiry into the practice and politics of museums has reached a new zenith in contemporary discourse. From discussions of acquisition and repatriation to provenience (archaeological findspot) and provenance (an object's ownership history) and the ethics of curation and modes of display, museum and art professionals-and the general public alike-are deliberating on the concept of museums and the responsibilities of such institutions towards the collections in their care. This course will explore the early history of museums and collecting practices and their impact on the field today, with a focus on cultural heritage collections from West Asia and North Africa. We will first spend time on such topics as archaeological exploration of \"the Orient,\" colonial collecting practices, and the antiquities trade, as well as the politics of representation and reception in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Next, we will look at critical issues presently facing museums, including ethical collection stewardship, provenance research, repatriation, community engagement, and public education. The course will be structured in a seminar format, with lectures devoted to the presentation of key themes by the instructor and critical discussion as a group. Meetings will include visits to the ISAC Museum at UChicago.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Aristophanes's Athens. 100 Units.\n\nThe comedies of Aristophanes are as uproarious, biting, and ribald today as they were more than 2,400 years ago. But they also offer a unique window onto the societal norms, expectations, and concerns as well as the more mundane experiences of Athenians in the fifth century BCE. This course will examine closely a number of Aristophanes' extant plays (in translation) in order to address topics such as the performative, ritual, and political contexts of Attic comedy, the constituency of audiences, the relationship of comedy to satire, the use of dramatic stereotypes, freedom of speech, and the limits of dissent. Please note that this course is rated Mature for adult themes and language.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Empires and Peoples: Ethnicity in Late Antiquity. 100 Units.\n\nLate antiquity witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of peoples in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Vandals, Arabs, Goths, Huns, Franks, and Iranians, among numerous others, took shape as political communities within the Roman and Iranian empires or along their peripheries. Recent scholarship has undone the traditional image of these groups as previously undocumented communities of \"barbarians\" entering history. Ethnic communities emerge from the literature as political constructions dependent on the very malleability of identities, on specific acts of textual and artistic production, on particular religious traditions, and, not least, on the imperial or postimperial regimes sustaining their claims to sovereignty. The colloquium will debate the origin, nature, and roles of ethno-political identities and communities comparatively across West Asia, from the Western Mediterranean to the Eurasian steppes, on the basis of recent contributions. As a historiographical colloquium, the course will address the contemporary cultural and political concerns-especially nationalism-that have often shaped historical accounts of ethnogenesis in the period as well as bio-historical approaches-such as genetic history-that sometimes sit uneasily with the recent advances of historians.\n\nInstructor(s): R. Payne Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Open to advanced undergraduates and graduate students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 20802, MDVL 20902, CLAS 33718, NEHC 30802, HIST 30902, CLCV 23718\n\nHIST 21206. The Reformation in Britain, 1450-1660. 100 Units.\n\nThe Reformation in Britain is one of the most contested areas in early modern history. Was it mostly a political event, triggered by Henry VIII's desire for a divorce? Was it an organic movement from the ground up, inspired by the enthusiasm of ordinary believers in the same way as many reform movements in continental Europe? Did it have a distinctive theology of its own: can we call this 'Anglicanism'? Should we be studying the 'British Reformation' on its own terms at all, or should it be viewed simply as an offshoot of the continental European Reformations? And did the puritans really want to cancel Christmas? This course will give students a thorough grounding in the Reformation in Britain c.1450-1660, paying especial attention to the complex historiographical issues that still plague the topic to this day. Students will have the opportunity to study a range of key primary texts from the era, from John Foxe's Book of Martyrs to the letters of Queen Elizabeth I, as well as to examine the modern-day legacies of English reform.\n\nInstructor(s): Kirsten Macfarlane Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 31206, HCHR 32604, RLST 22604\n\nHIST 22110. Renaissance Demonology. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we analyze the complex concept of demonology according to early modern European culture from a theological, historical, philosophical, and literary point of view. The term 'demon' in the Renaissance encompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but also synonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, we read selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, and a recent translation of the infamous \"Malleus maleficarum,\" the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We pay close attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the best secondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's \"The Possession at Loudun.\" We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa of Avila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy is concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's \"Platonic Theology\" and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizing autobiography. We also investigate the connection between demonology and melancholy through a close reading of the initial section of Robert Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" and Cervantes's short story \"The Glass Graduate\" (\"El licenciado Vidriera\").\n\nInstructor(s): Armando Maggi Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Course taught in English.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ITAL 26500, CMLT 27602, GNSE 26504, RLST 26501\n\nHIST 22207. The Social History of Alcohol in Early Modern Europe. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the multifaceted role that beer, wine, cider, and spirits played in European society and will challenge students to consider how a seemingly familiar commodity was a key component in shaping early modern social relations. It will focus on several major themes that have guided historical inquiry and show how hard drink intersects with and entangles these histories. Major themes will include alcohol and gender relations; state legality and taxation; moral policing; environmental projects and crises; labor and technology; and colonialism. Using both primary and secondary sources will push students to look below the surface to see how drink alternately challenged or reinforced social hierarchies, much as it continues to do in the present time.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

Almost all people in this period, from peasant to prince, accepted it as a real and powerful presence in their lives. They respected its credibility and practices in general, even if they might question particular claims. In this course we address why it was so ubiquitous, what it involved, and why, in the end, it seemed to decline. The course will introduce students to the major arguments that historians in this field have advanced, and provide critical perspectives on the interpretation of the range of practices falling under the term \"magic,\" from witchcraft and necromancy to alchemy. Among the topics likely to be discussed are demonology, natural magic, astrology, the witch craze, the roles of memory, orality, and literacy in sustaining and qualifying magical cultures, and the relationships between magic, medicine, and science.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

The Witch Craze in 17th-Century Europe: Scotland, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and Moravia. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we look carefully at the reasons for and repercussions of the \"witch craze\" in the long 17th-century, focussing on primary texts such as trial reports, legal literature, pamphlets, woodcuts, scholarly dissent, and other paraphernalia. The course follows a sweep of the craze from Lancashire in Scotland, where trials began in the 1590s, to Poznań in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to the Russian village of Lukh on the outskirts of Moscow, where between 1656 and 1660 over twenty-five individuals, most of them male, were tried and several executed, and finally to Northern Moravia under Habsburg rule where inquisitor Hetman Boblig presided over the burning of almost 100 \"witches.\" In each region, trials followed different customs-Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic-and answered to different legislative discourse-ecclesiastical, laic, secular-yet all can be said to be the product of a common desire and collective fear. To supplement our understanding of the multifaceted anxieties that are expressed in works such as King James' Daemonologie (1597), and to ask more questions of the intersectional phobias around gender, sexuality, religion, and class (rural-urban; colony-metropole), we take up theory from Foucault, Federici, and Mbembe, and others.\n\nInstructor(s): Malynne Sternstein Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 24426, HIST 32315, GNSE 34426, REES 34426, GNSE 24426\n\nHIST 22402. Anglo-Saxon England. 100 Units.\n\nThe kingdom seized by William the Conqueror in A.D. 1066 had been centuries in the making. Founded by pagan warlords following the retreat of the Roman legions, the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons were already old when missionaries arrived from Rome in A.D. 597, bearing icons and Gospel books. What happened when their kings converted to Christianity? How did their language, law, politics, culture, society, and economy change? What roles did monks, warriors, women, merchants, and poets have in crafting a kingdom so richly endowed that William coveted it as his prize? This course charts the making of Anglo-Saxon England through close readings of primary sources, including histories, epic poems, liturgies, and laws, alongside archeological surveys and works of art. Special attention will be given to the links that the Anglo-Saxons cultivated both with Rome and cultures even further south and east.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Religion and Politics in Modern European History, 1789-1965. 100 Units.\n\nThe general theme of the colloquium is the relationship between religion and civil society in Central Europe, the United Kingdom, and France between 1740 and the end of World War II. We will use this broad theme to explore a variety of important issues in modern European history, including the history of the relationship of the church and state; the contribution of religious consciousness and culture to the construction of class, gender, and national identities; and the role played by religious movements in the creation of a liberal, adversarial political system and the formation of a bourgeois public sphere. Special topics will include the role of religious disputes in the formation of administrative reform agendas in the Eighteenth Century, the shifting patterns of religious practice that developed in the Nineteenth Century; the role of religiously-based political movements in the crisis of the Liberal state in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries; the ambivalent relationship of the churches to National Socialism and the Vichy regime; the role of organized religion in the reconstruction and transformation of the European state system at the conclusion of World War II; and patterns of religious renewal in Europe in the 1960s.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Get Cultured in Nine Weeks: Historical Perspectives on Art and Education. 100 Units.\n\nGet Cultured in Nine Weeks: Historical Perspectives on Art and Education: What does it mean to 'get cultured'? Why-and how-do we do it? Does an education in the arts and letters make us more moral, more intelligent, more resistant to authority-or perhaps more submissive? These questions are at the center of debates about the place of cultural learning in the contemporary world, but our century was not the first to think critically about the social and political functions of this form of education. This course investigates how students, educators, writers, and artists conceptualized the aims and means of becoming cultured from the 1700s forward, focusing on European history and connecting it to the concerns of the present. We will pay particularly close attention to both formal and informal means of cultural education, and to the ways in which these practices have been understood to produce social structures of class, gender, and race. Readings will draw from the fields of history, literature, philosophy, sociology, and art history. At the end of the quarter, students will be asked to design their own fantasy syllabus for \"getting cultured in nine weeks.\"\n\nInstructor(s): Sophie Salvo and Alice Goff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 26225, GRMN 36225, GNSE 36255, GNSE 26255, HIST 32510\n\nHIST 23006. Looting, Plunder, and the Making of Modern Europe. 100 Units.\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century Europeans recognized the seizure of enemy property to be a time-honored practice of warfare and subjugation. At the same time, however, new ideas about human rights, cultural heritage, and international law began to reshape the place of looting in the exercise of power. This course will take up the history of looting in European cultural and political life from the late eighteenth through the twentieth centuries as a tool of nationalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and scholarship. How was looting defined, who defined it, and what kinds of ethical and legal codes governed its use? How was the seizure of personal property, cultural artifacts, and sacred objects legitimized by its practitioners and experienced by its victims? In what ways did looting change the meaning of objects and why? How do we understand looting in relationship to other forms of violence and destruction in the modern period? While the focus of the course will be on Europe, we will necessarily be concerned with a global frame as we follow cases of looting in colonial contexts, through migration, exploration, and during war. Course materials will including primary texts, images, objects, and historical accounts.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Themes in the European Reformation(s) 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the study of the Reformation(s) in early modern Europe. As well as covering the key theological ideas of famous Protestant reformers (Luther; Zwingli; Calvin), it will give ample space to the impact that these religious revolutions had on contemporary society, including attitudes to gender, politics, economics, and visual/material culture. It will cover the reformations and renewals undergone by Catholicism in the same period, and discuss the key arguments, questions, and concerns which have preoccupied historians of the Reformation since the nineteenth century. Students will have the opportunity to read and engage with famous texts from the period (for instance Erasmus's On Free Will; Luther's 95 Theses; Calvin's Institutes) as well as lesser-known but still influential works (e.g. the poetry of the female Italian humanist Olympia Fulvia Morata and the writings of early Jesuit missionaries to China and Japan), in addition to historically significant documents (such as contemporary witchcraft confessions and extracts from Reformation demonologies). Finally, there will be time devoted to unpacking the complex legacies of the Reformation and the 'unintended consequences' attributed to it, focusing especially on the afterlives of Max Weber's analyses.\n\nInstructor(s): Kirsten Macfarlane Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 22655\n\nHIST 23210.

Central concerns include politics, society, conflict, and Jewish-Palestinian entanglements and mutual formation in Israel and Palestine; space, place, power, poverty, and wealth in contemporary Jewish life; questions of community-society relations in American and French societies riven by questions of race and racism and intercommunal tensions as well as enduring questions of democracy and inequality; divergent Jewish identities and the ideas, histories, and affects that shape them with special attention to mizrahiut; Jewish religious revival with particular attention to various forms of Orthodox, pietistic, mystical, and illiberal religiosity on the one hand and the impacts of feminism and other liberation movements on the other; Jewish culture and literature in Israel and the diaspora in a post-secular age; rising disagreements over Zionism, identity, politics, and the Jewish future roiling Jewish communities.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

How Dictatorships Come to Power. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we will consider how dictators come to power, liberation schemes deteriorate into tyranny, and the democratic process paves way for authoritarianism. We will examine the seizures of power (revolutions, coups d'etat, elections) and the tools of authoritarian governance (state violence, censorship, emotional and political mobilization, militarism) in a comparative perspective, ranging across case studies from the 20th century. Our readings will consist of scholarship and primary documents. The impetus for this course is my attempt to understand historically and comparatively the profound transformations that have taken place in Russia itself before and after it invaded Ukraine.\n\nInstructor(s): E. Gilburd Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nHIST 23706. The Soviet Union. 100 Units.\n\nThis lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature, but in the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation-from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab-will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques of Stalinism; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.\n\nInstructor(s): E.

(Re)Branding the Balkan City: Comtemp. Belgrade/Sarajevo/Zagreb. 100 Units.\n\nThe freedom to make and remake our cities (and ourselves) is one of the most precious yet most neglected of the human rights,\" argues David Harvey. In this course, we use an urban studies lens to explore the complex history, social fabric, architecture, infrastructure, and cultural transformation of the former Yugoslav capitals. Since their inception, these cities have relied on multifaceted exchanges of peoples and political projects, forms of knowledge, financial and cultural capital, means of production, and innovative ideas. Among others, these exchanges produced two phenomena, Yugoslav architecture, embodying one of the great political experiments of the modern era, and the Non-Aligned Movement, as explored in recent documentary films (Turajlić 2023), museum exhibits (MoMA 2018, \"Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia 1948-1980\"), and monographs (Tito in Africa: Picturing Solidarity). Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnography of the city, we consider processes of urban destruction and renewal, practices of branding spaces and identities, metropolitan citizenship, arts and design, architectural histories and styles, and the broader politics of space. The course is complemented by cultural and historical media, guest speakers, and virtual tours. Classes are conducted in English.\n\nInstructor(s): Nada Petkovic Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 31333, BCSN 31303, REES 31303, ARTH 21333, GLST 21301, BCSN 21300, ARCH 21300, REES 21300\n\nHIST 24009. Invasion Culture: Russia through its Wars. 100 Units.\n\nThis course looks at contemporary culture through Russia's invasions, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Broadly, this course explores how war shapes cultural life. How do the policies and strategies of war, and the art and literature of wartime, convey ideas about power and the state, traditional vs. modern values, civilizational mission vs. cultural pluralism? Beyond Russian literature and film, we consider voices from Afghanistan, the Caucasus, Chechnya, Syria, Belarus, and Ukraine, asking, How are Russia's wars fought and resisted in the domain of culture?\n\nInstructor(s): Ania Aizman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 24425, REES 34425, CMLT 24425\n\nHIST 24122. Buddhist Meditation: Tradition, Transformation, Modernization. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the Satipaṭṭhāna sutta of the Pāli canon to the \"mindfulness\" boom of recent years, Buddhism and meditation often appear inseparable. The aim of this seminar is to historicize and critically question this seemingly natural intimacy, for while it certainly cannot be denied that the various Buddhist traditions have always had on offer a plethora of techniques for mental (and physical) cultivation, it is far from clear how or even if all these could be subsumed under the in its current usage relatively recent category of \"meditation\". Drawing on Buddhist meditation literature from various traditions, historical periods, and literary genre, in this seminar we will take up a twofold question: First, how has the encounter with Buddhist techniques of cultivation shaped the modern understanding of \"meditation\", and second, up to which extend, and at what cost, has this very modern understanding conversely conditioned us to see Buddhism as a \"meditative religion\" par excellence?\n\nInstructor(s): Stephan Licha Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SALC 34600, SALC 24600, RLST 24600, EALC 34600, HREL 34600, HIST 34122, EALC 24609\n\nHIST 24123. History of Food in Japan. 100 Units.\n\nAlthough food is an essential part of human existence, it has only recently become the object of historical analysis, and historical research has drawn attention to its significance in relation to issues of health, gender, class, technology, and culture. This course explores the history of food in Japan in the period from c. 1600 to the postwar era. Topics to be examined include changing practices of consumption and production, medical discourse and conceptions of a proper diet, the impact of introduction of new foods and new methods of preparation, the rise of nutritional science, the development of a \"national cuisine,\" and the impact of war and defeat upon food culture.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Post-empire: Japan and East Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is on the post-imperial and postcolonial history in East Asia. After Japan declared defeat on August 15th, 1945, the empire has officially ended. Yet, the aftermath and afterlife of Japan's empire still deeply influenced the social and political environment in this region. How did the post-imperial connections shape Japan and its Asian neighbors? How did different actors react to this sudden change of political environment? This course pays close attention to the imperial and post-imperial continuity and changes.\n\nInstructor(s): Y.

We will be concerned with tracing the circulation of new medical knowledge and understanding its cultural and social implications. Topics to be explored include the introduction of \"Western medicine\" and its impact for \"traditional\" medicine; the struggles over public health, gender, medicine, and modernity; consumer culture; and medicine. No knowledge of an East Asian language is required, but those with reading skills will be encouraged to utilize them.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

The History of the Book in East Asia: From Bamboo to Webtoon. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar offers an overview of the development and history of the \"book\" and its physical forms, broadly conceived, in East Asia from ancient times to the present. Drawing on recent scholarship, selected primary sources, and rare books housed within the library system, this course familiarizes students with the evolution of the book and methods of book production in China, Korea, and Japan, the principles and practices of material bibliography and the application of such to physical and digital objects, and selected topics salient to the social and cultural meanings of books: authorship, the book trade, reading, censorship, and more.

New Histories of Chinese Labor. 100 Units.\n\nPast scholarship has often reduced the history of Chinese labor to the history of the Chinese labor movement or the history of the Communist Party in its function as \"the leading core\" of the proletariat. The factory proletariat, of course, was never more than a small segment of the Chinese labor force - less than five percent under the Republic, less than ten in the People's Republic. Recent work has been more inclusive, looking at work outside the formal sector, in agriculture, handcrafts, and service industries; at the work of women in formal employment and at home; at sex work and emotional work; at unemployment and precarious work; at the work of internal migrants; at Chinese workers abroad; at coerced work in private industry (the 2007 \"kiln slaves' incident\"); and at carceral labor in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Most of the readings will deal with work in the Mao and post-Mao years, right up to the present. We will combine readings on Chinese labor history with more general texts on the relationship between productive and reproductive work, wage work and non-wage work, male and female work, autonomous and heteronomous work. The guiding question throughout the course is if a new Chinese labor movement is necessary, possible, or probable, and if it is not, under which conditions it might become so.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

We will examine major works of early modern Korean literature in translation, investigate elite and popular literary culture, and explore the status of novels according to contemporary critics. The course highlights questions of cosmopolitan and vernacular language, translation, script, the materiality of texts, readership and reading practices, gender, class, canonization, cross-cultural influence with China and Japan, and the legacies of Chosŏn literature in contemporary North and South Korea.\n\nInstructor(s): G.

By reading and discussing significant scholarly works, this course will help students extend their understanding of modern South Korean society and its relationship to the family, the state, civil society, popular culture, class, and the economy in both local and global contexts.\n\nInstructor(s): E. Park Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 24408\n\nHIST 24512. Everyday Maoism: Revolution, Daily Life, and Material Culture in Socialist China. 100 Units.\n\nThe history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns, from land reform to the Cultural Revolution. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, the promise of socialism was as much about material transformations as it was about political change: a socialist revolution would bring better living conditions, new work regimes and new consumption patterns. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the \"new objects\" of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning - or at the persistence of an older material life under a new socialist veneer. In this course, we will analyze workplaces in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked, and look at rationing and consumption in the households to see how socialism affected them at home. We will look at how specific objects came to stand in for the Maoist revolution, for socialist modernity, or for feudal backwardness. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will read some of the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people's life experiences out of the material record of their lives?\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Women and Work in Modern East Asia. 100 Units.\n\nWorldwide, women do about 75 percent of the world's unpaid care and domestic work. They spend up to three hours more per day cooking and cleaning than men do, and anywhere from two to ten hours more per day looking after children and the elderly. Women's underpaid work at home and in industry subsidized the early stages of industrialization in nineteenth-century Britain, early twentieth-century Japan, and contemporary China, and women's unpaid contributions to their households enable employers worldwide to keep wages low. We know, at least in outline, how women came to carry double burdens in Europe and North America, but little research has been done so far about this process in East Asia. In this course, we will discuss when and how China, Japan, and Korea developed a division of labor in which most wage work was gendered male and reproductive work was marked female. Are current divisions of labor between men and women rooted in local cultures, or are they the result of industrial capitalist development? How do divisions of labor differ between the three East Asian countries, and how did developments in one East Asian country affect others?\n\nInstructor(s): Jacob Eyferth Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Not offered in 2023-24.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 24501, GNSE 20121, EALC 34501, HIST 34518, GNSE 30121\n\nHIST 24519. Li Zhi and 16th Century China: The Self, Tradition, and Dissent in Comparative Context. 100 Units.\n\nThe 16th century Chinese iconoclast Li Zhi (Li Zhuowu) has been rightly celebrated as a pioneer of individualism, one of history's great voices of social protest, an original mind powerfully arguing for genuine self-expression, and more. He was a Confucian official and erudite in the classics, yet in his sixties he takes the Buddhist tonsure, and late in life befriends the Jesuit Matteo Ricci. He sought refuge in a quiet monastery devoting his life to scholarship, yet invited constant scandal. His A Book to Burn \"sold like hotcakes,\" and attracted enough trouble that reportedly readers would surreptitiously hide their copies tucked up their sleeves, and was later banned by the state soon after his death. In this seminar, we will place Li both within the context of the history of \"Confucian\" thought, and within the literary, religious, and philosophical conversations of the late Ming. Using his writings as a productive case study, we will think about topics including \"religion,\" tradition and innovation, \"spontaneity\" and \"authenticity,\" and the relationship between \"classics\" and commentaries. Throughout, we will bring our discussions into comparative analysis, considering views of thinkers and traditions from other times and places. Chinese not required; for those interested, we will read select essays of Li's in Chinese and students may choose translation as a final project.\n\nInstructor(s): Pauline Lee Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course meets the HS or CS Committee distribution requirement for Divinity students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DVPR 33202, HREL 33202, HIST 34519, FNDL 23202, RLST 23202, EALC 33202, EALC 23202\n\nHIST 24615.

Tutorial: Evolution Beyond Darwin. 100 Units.\n\nOne of the most identifiable images associated with evolution is the visage of Charles Darwin. Historical narratives of evolution center on Darwin's work, and scientific publications today still note whether or not Darwin pre-empted their ideas. This course aims to build a narrative of evolution that brings the story up to today, asking why so many see Darwin as a shorthand for evolution and what consequences that might have for the development and communication of the science. In addition, it will interrogate other \"iconic\" images and narratives in evolution, like the tree of life. We will ask where our ideas about evolution have come from, how they are perpetuated, and what consequence that might have for the discipline of evolutionary biology. The course has three aims: 1) to provide a historical understanding of evolution after Darwin; 2) to reflect on how evolution is communicated between scientists and to the broader public, and to ask how \"icons\" or Darwin himself suggest implicit meanings counter to the work of the scientists; and 3) to more broadly examine what is a science-a process or a body of knowledge?\n\nInstructor(s): E.

Pacific Worlds: Race, Gender, Health, and the Environment. 100 Units.\n\nThis discussion-based course will introduce students to both classical and recent scholarship in Pacific World historiography. By adopting micro-historical, comparative, and transnational methods, students will examine the formation of three overlapping \"worlds\": The Antipodes, Polynesia, and the northeastern Pacific. Analyzing the myriad intersections of race, gender, health, and the environment, we will explore a range of large-scale historical processes that shaped and reshaped the Pacific between the mid-eighteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries. These processes include European exploration, settler colonialism, and indigenous sovereignty; sex, depopulation, and race science; labor, migration, and urbanization; industrialization and environmental exploitation; and imperial expansion and citizenship. The course is intended for students with an interest in the Pacific Islands, Australasia, and the North American West, as well as those interested in race, gender, health, or the environment within indigenous, immigrant, or settler colonial contexts. Required readings - which will consist of book chapters and academic articles - will be used to contextualize and critically analyze a variety of primary sources during each class session.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Kindell Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts towards the ENST 4th year Capstone requirement.

Climate Change, Environment, and Society. 100 Units.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of 21st-century planetary emergencies, this discussion-based course will investigate how natural and anthropogenic climate change have influenced historical relationships between humans and their environments. Organized chronologically, the course's three thematic units will focus on: (1) natural variations in regional climates before the advent of fossil fuels; (2) the emergence of greenhouse gases as a result of fossil fuel dependency, technology, and infrastructure; and (3) climate change science and global politics. Students will employ historical methods to explore periods of social, political, economic, technological, and ecological transformation, including but not limited to: the rise and \"collapse\" of Central American populations; European exploration and the Little Ice Age; colonization, Indigenous dispossession, and slavery in the Atlantic World; the Industrial Revolution and the consolidation of global fossil fuel infrastructure; population growth, (sub)urbanization, and the Great Acceleration of the mid-20th century; and the development of modern climate change science and denialism. Required texts consisting of scholarly book chapters and journal articles will be used to contextualize and critically analyze a variety of historical documents. Grades will be based on attendance, in-class participation, weekly reading responses, peer review, and a series of scaffolded assignments that culminate in an 8-page final research paper.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Kindell Terms Offered: Autumn Spring\n\nNote(s): Students who have taken ENST 21201: Human Impact on the Global Environment may not enroll in this course.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 20001, GLST 21001, ENST 20011\n\nHIST 25032. The Politics of Environmental Knowledge. 100 Units.\n\nHow has \"nature\" been understood and investigated in the modern world? Building upon diverse approaches to environmental history and philosophy, the history of science, and cultural studies, this discussion-based course surveys the major frameworks through which the environment has been understood, investigated, and transformed since the origins of global modernity. Because of its outsized impact (intellectually and materially) on the globe, North American environmentalism and understandings of nature are used as our point of departure. Starting with debates about what to name our current epoch, the course approaches shifting definitions of environmental knowledge through decreasing scales of analysis, from the global, to communities and ecosystems, to species and individuals, ending with the microscopic. The course asks questions such as: What historical and cultural trends shape our current understandings of nature and the environment? At what scales can and should we intervene to shift the ways we know and interact with the natural world? How and to whom should the answers to these complex questions be communicated? Grades will be based on attendance, in-class participation, assigned discussion leading, written papers, and a final project organized as an exhibition proposal.\n\nInstructor(s): Jessica Landau Terms Offered: Autumn Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 20012, CEGU 20002, GLST 21002\n\nHIST 25033. Disease, Health, and the Environment in Global Context. 100 Units.\n\nRecent concerns about monkeypox, COVID-19, Zika virus, and Ebola have attracted renewed attention to previous disease outbreaks that have significantly shaped human political, social, economic, and environmental history. Such diseases include: smallpox during the 16th-century Columbian exchange; syphilis during the 18th-century exploration and settlement of the Pacific; bubonic plague in the late-19th-century colonization and urbanization of South and East Asia; and yellow fever during America's 20th-century imperial projects across the Caribbean. Through readings, discussions, library visits, and written assignments that culminate in a final project, students in this course will explore how natural and human-induced environmental changes have altered our past experiences with disease and future prospects for health. First, we will examine how early writers understood the relationship between geography, environment, hereditary constitution, race, gender, and human health. We will then analyze the symbiotic relationship among pathogens, human hosts, and their environments. Finally, we will explore how social factors (e.g. migration, gendered divisions of labor, poverty, and segregation) and human interventions (e.g. epidemiology, medical technology, and sanitary engineering) have influenced the distribution of infectious diseases and environmental risks.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Kindell Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts towards the CEGU/ENST 4th year Capstone requirement.

History of Cartography. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers a grand overview of the key developments in mapmaking throughout history worldwide, from pre-literate cartography to the modern interactive digital environment. It looks at the producers, their audience, the technologies and artistic systems used, and the human and global contexts in which they developed. The course also features experiential learning components with field trips to map collections at Regenstein Library and Newberry Library.\n\nInstructor(s): Yue Lin Terms Offered: Autumn 2024–25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHST 28800, GISC 38800, ARCH 28800, GISC 28800, HIST 35121, CEGU 28800\n\nHIST 25205. The Scientific Image. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the broad field of scientific image-making, focusing in particular on problems of formalism, abstraction, and realism. What makes a \"good\" scientific image? What kind of work do scientific images do? What philosophical, ideological, and political constraints underwrite attempts to render the complexity of events and entities in the world in stylized visual vocabularies? And how might we approach the work of aesthetics and style in image-making? We will examine these questions through a survey of several contemporary scholarly frameworks used for thinking about problems of representation in scientific practice, and will attend to such image-making practices as graphing, diagramming, modeling, doodling, illustrating, sculpting, and photographing, among other methods.\n\nInstructor(s): M.

Magic, Miracles, and Medicine: Healthcare in the Bible and the Ancient World. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.\n\nInstructor(s): Richard Zaleski Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HLTH 20223, KNOW 20223, RLST 20223, CCTS 21021, HIPS 20223, JWSC 20923\n\nHIST 25318. Wonder, Wonders, and Knowing. 100 Units.\n\nIn wonder is the beginning of philosophy,\" wrote Aristotle; Descartes also thought that those deficient in wonder were also deficient in knowledge. But the relationship between wonder and inquiry has always been an ambivalent one: too much wonder stupefies rather than stimulates investigation, according to Descartes; Aristotle explicitly excluded wonders as objects of inquiry from natural philosophy. Francis Bacon called wonders \"broken knowledge.\" Since the sixteenth century, scientists and scholars have both cultivated and repudiated the passion of wonder; On the one hand, marvels (or even just anomalies) threaten to subvert the human and natural orders; on the other, the wonder they ignite inquiry into their causes. Wonder is also a passion tinged with the numinous, and miracles have long stood for the inexplicable in religious contexts. Above all, wonders demand attention and interpretation. This seminar will explore the long, vexed relationship between wonder, knowledge, and belief in the history of philosophy, science, and religion.\n\nInstructor(s): Lorraine Daston Terms Offered: Spring.

Tutorial: Mathematical Knowledge: Race, Politics and Materiality. 100 Units.\n\nMathematical knowledge is commonly treated as objective and neutral, even though it is produced through specific societal contexts and in turn impacts those same contexts. In this course we will take a thematic approach to studying how mathematical and quantitative knowledges are produced and used through political processes from which they cannot be separated. We will look at examples such as the connections between plantation slavery and the precise measurement of molasses barrels in the 18th century, the gendered nature of the prestigious Tripos exam in the 19th century, 20th century attempts to quantify and manage reproduction, and 21st century issues of algorithmic policing. We will consider multiple angles for approaching the study of mathematics by connecting mathematical knowledge to topics such as labor, racial sciences, pedagogy, material tools, masculinity, nation-building, and embodiment. This will allow us to move beyond simply considering representation (of women in STEM, for example) to think about how gender and race are part of the construction of mathematical knowledge. In particular, this course will encourage students to think creatively about other possibilities for how we could justly and effectively use mathematics in our lives. There are no mathematical pre-requisites; students with a variety of experiences with mathematics will be able to participate fully in this course.\n\nInstructor(s): Abigail Taylor-Roth Terms Offered: Spring.

A History of Cell and Molecular Biology. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will trace the parallel histories of cell and molecular biology, primarily in the 20th century, by exploring continuities and discontinuities between these fields and their precursors. Through discussion, attempts will be made to develop definitions of cell and molecular biology that are based upon their practices and explanatory strategies, and to determine to what extent these practices and strategies overlap. Finally, the relevance of these definitions to current developments in biology will be explored. The course is not designed to be comprehensive, but will provide an overall historical and conceptual framework.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Ancient Empires IV: the Achaemenid Empire. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to the Achaemenid Empire, also known as the First Persian Empire (ca. 550-330 BCE). We will be examining the political history and cultural accomplishments of the Achaemenids who, from their homeland in modern-day Iran, quickly rose to become one of the largest empires of the ancient world, ruling from North Africa to North India at their height. We will also be examining the history of Greek-Persian encounters and the image of the Achaemenids in Greek and Biblical literature. The students will visit the Oriental Institutes' archive and object collection to learn more about the University of Chicago's unique position in the exploration, excavation, and restoration of the Persian Empire's royal architecture and administrative system through the Persian Expedition carried out in the 1930s.\n\nInstructor(s): Mehrnoush Soroush Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is not required.

Islamic Thought and Literature I. 100 Units.\n\nIn the first quarter of Islamic Thought and Literature, students will explore the intellectual and cultural history of the Islamic world in its various political and social contexts. Chronologically, the course begins with emergence of Islam in the 7th century CE and continues through the Mongol conquests until the rise of the \"gunpowder empires\" circa 1500. Students will leave the course with a historical and geographical framework for understanding the history of the Middle East and a familiarity with the major forms of premodern Islamic cultural production (e.g., history-writing, scriptural exegesis, poetry, philosophy, jurisprudence, etc.). Students will also develop the skills and contextual knowledge necessary for analyzing these sources in English translation; they will thus come to appreciate premodern Islamic cultural products on their own terms while engaging in the collective work of historical interpretation. No prior background in the subject is required. This sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies.\n\nInstructor(s): O’Malley, Austin , Jack Buredn Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SOSC 22000, MDVL 20601, RLST 20401, NEHC 20601\n\nHIST 25613. Saints and Sinners in Late Antiquity. 100 Units.\n\nBetween the third and seventh centuries, Christian communities came to flourish throughout the Middle East and neighboring regions in the Roman and Iranian empires as well as the kingdoms of the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Ethiopia. This course will examine the development of Christian institutions and ideologies in relation to the distinctive social structures, political cultures, economies, and environments of the Middle East, with a focus on the Fertile Crescent. The makers of Middle Eastern Christianities were both saints and sinners. Holy men and women, monks, and sometimes bishops withdrew from what they often called \"the world\" with the intention of reshaping society through prayer, asceticism, and writing; some also intervened directly in social, political, and economic relations. The work of these saints depended on the cooperation of aristocrats, merchants, and rulers who established enduring worldly institutions. To explore the dialectical relationship between saints and sinners, we will read lives of saints in various Middle Eastern languages in translation.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Armenian History through Art and Culture. 100 Units.\n\nWho are the Armenians and where do they come from? What is the cultural contribution of Armenians to their neighbors and overall world heritage? This crash-course will try to answer these and many other similar questions while surveying Armenian history and elements of culture (mythology, religion, manuscript illumination, art, architecture, etc.). It also will discuss transformations of Armenian identity and symbols of 'Armenianness' through time, based on such elements of national identity as language, religion, art, or shared history. Due to the greatest artistic quality and the transcultural nature of its monuments and artifacts, Armenia has much to offer in the field of Art History, especially when we think about global transculturation and appropriation among cultures as a result of peoples' movements and contacts. The course is recommended for students with interest in Armenian Studies or related fields, in Area or Civilizations Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, etc.\n\nInstructor(s): Hripsime Haroutunian Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 20692, NEHC 30692, ARTH 20692, NEHC 20692\n\nHIST 25714.

It examines the profound transformations that have occurred in Israel's urban and spatial policy over 70 years and asks how the Israeli case illuminates global trends comparatively. Foci include: the dramatic shift in Israel's urban policy from state-driven to neoliberal logics; uniqueness and comparability of Israel's urban policy; impacts of major global crises (the 2007/8 economic crisis; Covid-19; climate change); urban policy's impacts on different population groups within Israel: Jewish and Palestinian Israelis, secular and Orthodox, Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews, Ethiopian Jews. We will also discuss possible impacts of the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 and the ensuing war.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Brazil: Another American History. 100 Units.\n\nBrazil is in many ways a mirror image of the United States: an almost continental democracy, rich in natural resources, populated by the descendants of three continents, shaped by colonialism, slavery, and sui generis liberal capitalism. Why, then, has Brazil's historical path been so distinct? To explore this question, this course will focus on the history of economic development, race, citizenship, urbanization, the environment, popular culture, violence, and the challenge of democracy. Assignments: Weekly reading, participation in discussions, weekly journal posts, and a final paper.\n\nInstructor(s): B.

A History of Youth in Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the history of youth-as a social category, and as an experience-in Latin America. We will consider histories of childhood, student activism, and youth culture across the region to consider how young people experience everyday life, and how they effect change. Course materials will combine primary sources including film, music, and other visual and performance artworks with scholarship on childhood and youth.\n\nInstructor(s): Diana Schwartz-Francisco Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHDV 21816, LACS 21816, GLST 21816\n\nHIST 26305. Covid-19 and other epidemics in Latin American History. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is designed as an introduction to the history of epidemics and pandemics in Latin America from the XVI century to the present. Emphasis will be on using epidemics and pandemics as historical lenses to illuminate key dimensions of Latin America's society like discrimination, citizenship, authoritarianism, popular resilience and globalization. We will discuss the relationship between epidemics and pandemics and international commerce, analyze the role played by structural inequities and inadequate responses by governments in the intensification of disease outbreaks, and assess popular reactions to government's action and inaction. An organizing principle of several sessions will be \"Necropolitics\" (a concept originally coined by Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe) applied to social studies of health. These studies indicate that it is misleading to consider epidemics and pandemics as equal-opportunity threats since widespread disease outbreaks are usually more acute and tragic for vulnerable populations. A distinctive feature of necropolitics and Covid-19 was a misplaced hope for \"herd immunity\", embraced by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, namely the natural protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune through previous infection, with the assumption that a large number of people had to die.\n\nInstructor(s): Marcos Cueto Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 36305, LACS 35132, LACS 25132\n\nHIST 26306.

Spectral Archives: Asian Diasporic Literature in the Americas. 100 Units.\n\nAre minor lives worth documenting? How do we have access to the lives of the multitude, the dispossessed, the outcasts and the enslaved-the lives that archival documents have little to tell us about? Is it ethical to recreate and recover the unheard lives of peoples historically perceived as illiterate, undesirable, \"diseased\" and unassimilable? What is the power of imagining and writing about existing otherwise? We will consider these questions throughout the course by turning to the under-explored history of Asian diasporas in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will contextualize examples of life writing (broadly-defined) spanning from late seventeenth-century to the twenty-first century, both by members of the Asian diasporas themselves and as they have been re-imagined by contemporary authors. Some examples of primary texts include the spiritual biography of a seventeenth-century Mughal princess-slave who became a mystic in colonial Mexico, queer imagination of a Chinese \"coolie\" in late nineteenth-century Jamaica, the memoirs of Japanese-Peruvians in the internment camp during WW2, semi-autobiographical poems and short stories by contemporary Asian-Latinx writers. With the help of supplementary critical readings on radical life writing, we will consider throughout the course how imaginative, anti-racist, feminist and queer narratives may expand our current knowledge of the lives of the marginalized and the racialized.\n\nInstructor(s): Yunning Zhang Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Students will engage with course materials through collaborative discussion and presentation, and the creation of a public-facing website that will include blog posts and a multimedia final project, where each student crafts a creative piece for an Asian diasporic subject of their own choosing.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 21090, GNSE 23166, EALC 21090, GLST 21090, ANTH 21090, LACS 21090, CMLT 21090, RDIN 21090, SPAN 22090, CMLT 31090\n\nHIST 26309. The Economic History of Latin America. 100 Units.\n\nThe course explores Latin America's historical evolution, analyzing the factors that have promoted or limited its economic development from the 16th century to the present. It seeks to familiarize students with the main debates on the economic history of the region, including the most recent literature. Despite its diversity, Latin American countries share several common traits, linked to its past, that have resulted in lower levels of income and greater poverty than the Global North, and very high inequality by international standards. This course aims to acquaint students with Latin America's diversity and, at the same time, identify its common characteristics. The course will delve into the following traits, that although unevenly distributed through the region, have shaped Latin America's economic development: indigenous legacies, colonial extraction, slavery, European migration, political fragmentation and instability, integration into the global economy through commodities' exports, low educational levels, poor innovation and financial development, limited industrialization, and frequent macroeconomic crises.\n\nInstructor(s): Aurora Gómez Galvarriato Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LACS 35135, HIST 36309, LACS 25135\n\nHIST 26318.
