        "text": "Here are some notes I have culled from the youtube talks by Jordan Peterson – the bits that struck a chord with me. Dr. Jordan B Peterson is a professor and clinical psychologist at the psychology department, University of Toronto.\n\n* * *\n\n“There’s something about the human being – whatever it is that makes us conscious that interacts with the chaotic potential that constitutes reality and extracts out from that the order within which we live and that there’s something divine about that, and that’s the value of the human being.\n\n“The idea that each individual – even criminals, murderers & the worst and most reprehensible people have to be treated with the respect due a divinity because we partake in the capacity to extract habitable order from chaos with our consciousness, with our speech and with our capacity to communicate and we recognize insofar as we each recognize the other as valuable. It’s predicated on that observation we each have something to offer each other and something vital, and you know that if you engage in a real conversation with someone – a meaningful conversation that suspends your sense of fragile mortality for a moment – you understand that in that communication between people, something of inestimable value emerges that you have to pursue and if you live for that, you live for that relationship with yourself. You live for the discovery of that relationship when you’re engaged in an artistic pursuit. It’s the core of meaning in life, and it’s not an illusion. In fact it’s a manifestation of the highest functions of your nervous system because what your nervous system does is signal to you that you’re in a place and time that you cannot see when you’re engaged in something meaningful you need comes upon you and it’s secure for the catastrophes of tragic mortality that wonderful engagement in what’s meaningful that you do you can and do experience and that you can get better at experiencing if you practice and that’s because your nervous system which has evolved over billions of years has learned to tell you when you’re standing on the border between chaos and order and keeping them in balance and that’s what manifests itself is meaningful and that’s the same phenomena that’s referred to in the creation stories in Genesis and it’s the same idea that’s reflected in the strange Christian assistance that the thing that saves mankind.\n\nViktor Frankl came through the Nazi prison camps and he developed logotherapy as a consequence of that. The principles of logotherapy were laid forth in his book man’s search for meaning, and one of Frankel’s propositions was essentially that because life is suffering, and can be unbearable suffering, that it’s necessary for people to have our countervailing meaning to buttress themselves against the tragedy of existence. Frankel basically claimed, and this is an existential claim, that if you that you could find that meaning in collective belief, but that there were terrible dangers associated with that.\n\nConscientiousness keeps your neuroticism in check. So clean your room, establish disciplined habits, get up and go to bed at the same time.\n\nDisciplining yourself: wanting to do something positive with your life – making your own life better.\n\n“Our true path should be something like: Imagine the noblest aim that you can conceptualize and then sacrifice your life to attempting to attain it.”\n\nEverything that there is in the world at any given moment is right where you are, so pay attention!\n\nIf you really want s t you’ll make the sacrifice for it, so unless you are willing to make the necessary sacrifices, you don’t really want it.\n\nLife is suffering, right, indisputable, what do you do about that? You voluntarily accept it and then strive to overcome the suffering. You do that in a way that makes it better for other people and then one question might be how well does it work and the answer is that the only way that you can find out is by trying. That’s the extension element of it – the proof is to be derived by the incarnation of the attitude in your own life. No one can tell you how it will work for you, it’s your destiny to discover that and you have to make the decisions to begin with. It’s like because you can’t do this without commitment – you have to commit to it first – that’s the act of faith that the Kierkegaard was so insistent upon. You have to say I’m going to act as if being is good, I’m going to act as if truth is the pathway to enlightenment, I’m going to act as if I should pursue the deepest meaning possible in my life and there’s reasons to do none of those -they’re real reasons, so it’s really a decision. But you can’t find out what the consequence of the decision is unless you make the decision.\n\nThe culture that we grow up around has to be given its due respect because we owe everything to it, because it shapes us into everything we value.\n\nYou’re all in no matter what you do. You’re all in*. This is going to kill you, so I think you might as well play the most magnificent game you can while you’re waiting, because you don’t have anything better to do really.\n\nWhy not pick the best thing possible that you could do? Why not do that? Maybe you could justify your wretched existence to yourself that way.\n\n[*To be fully committed to a task or endeavor; to give or be prepared to give all of one’s energy or resources toward something]\n\nFind something better to do. Set your sights high, make a plan, figure out who you could be, and see if the obsessive use of a smart-phone (or whatever) fits into that vision of nobility.\n\nThe more you sacrifice the more potential you gain.\n\nBy absorbing that information, which is learning, essentially you build yourself into a different person – a stronger and more informed person. Also a more a more intact person – a person with more integrity and with more strength and with more direction, and at the same time you differentiate your map so you’re living more and more in the real world. So as you approach your specific goal, even if it’s a culturally conditioned goal, the learning that you do along the way transforms you and it transforms the nature of your goal. Things shine forth – there’s a reason for that, and you know that because when you’re attending to something you’re interested in, and you’re engaged, that’s when you’re alive and that’s when life is worthwhile. It’s so worthwhile that in those moments you don’t even ask the question about it. The question itself goes away because the meaning that you’re united with is so powerful that it can push back the adversity that would otherwise characterize life. Nietzsche said the person who has a ‘why’ can bear any ‘how’ and that’s a really useful thing to know because you think, “Well we’re very vulnerable creatures in our life, and catastrophically and terrible things happen, and how can we bear that?” And the answer to that is and always has been that you have to be in sync with it, it’s the resurrection stone it’s up to you… It’s a diamond, it’s a jewel, the idea is that if you follow the thing that manifests itself to you is interesting it will lead you through adversity you’ll lead yourself to do things that are difficult, but not beyond your capacity because it’s tempered for that, and what will happen is as you hit yourself against the world pursuing what you’re interested in, you’ll tap yourself into alignment – your molecules, your structure, internal structure, will become non-contradictory like the internal structure of a jewel which is something that reflects light that makes you hard and durable and able to bear the terrible conditions of existence without becoming corrupt. TS Eliot said something about this: “we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and to know the place for the first time.” That’s a five line summary of the most remarkable elaboration of the nature of the relationship between individual human consciousness and reality itself -that’s to follow what you’re interested in and it’ll take you over adversity and then through it, it’ll transform you from a citizen into an individual and then the doors will open again and at that point you’re strong enough to have your life and at that point you’re strong enough not to fall prey to pathological belief systems.\n\nYou need to know that which you want to sacrifice so that you set yourself down a path which interests you. Your nervous system gives you flags letting you know that which is truly necessary because without out you just can’t live without it. What are you sacrificing to become that which you want to be most and what is it that you want to become? As you work towards that which you are most interested the parts of life that seem dull disappear and you become so immersed in that thing, you transform yourself into something that has so much experience in the world that you bring yourself into an alignment that is no longer self- contradictory.\n\nImagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.\n\nHow to make yourself more productive and smarter? Get up early in the morning and get to work.\n\nJordan Peterson says:\n\nYou take people and you expose them voluntarily to things that they are avoiding and are afraid of and know they need to overcome in order to meet their self defined goals, if you can teach people to stand up in the face of the things they’re afraid of they get stronger. You don’t know what the upper limits to that are because you might ask yourself if for 10 years you didn’t avoid doing what you knew you needed to do by your own definitions within the value structure that you’ve created to the degree that you’ve done that what would you be like? well you know there are remarkable people who come into the world from time to time and there are people who do find out over what they could be like if they were who they were. We do not know the limits to that and so you ask yourself well what would happen if you just stop wasting the opportunities that are in front of you – who knows how much more efficient you’d be?\n\nWORK:\n\nWork as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens. Jordan Peterson\n\nDon’t avoid doing what you know you need to do.\n\nExpose yourself voluntarily to things that you are avoiding and are afraid of and know you need to overcome in order to meet your self-defined goals. If you learn to stand up in the face of the things you’re afraid of you get stronger.\n\nI made mine (rules). And so can you. I’ve been as happy as I can be ever since.\n\nI think you can find what compels you and what might enable you to live in a high quality manner despite the suffering that’s associated with life. I think you can discover that and I think part of the way you discover that is by watching yourself and learning when it is that you’re meaningfully engaged. You have to notice that it’s something that happens to you in some sense rather than something that you do. You have to notice when you’re meaningfully engaged and then you have to work to expand the amount of time that you spend in that state.\n\nI would say that if you’re going to set up your life so that you maximize your meaningful engagement there’s a number of other things that you have to do at the same time, and one of those is that you have to get very clear about who you are and what you’re doing.\n\nI think that one of the things that you have to do if you’re going to attempt to maximize meaningful engagement is that you also have to do such things as endeavour to stop deceiving yourself and other people in every way you possibly can.\n\nThere are things that you can do, find yourself engaged with the world at such a level that your existential concerns could disappear. And we can even understand that biochemically, to some degree, because if you’re really interested in something you got a dopamine release – an exploratory dopamine release. That’s great!\n\nIt’s frequently the case that people do everything they can to lighten their load, but the problem with carrying a light load is that then you have nothing that’s useful to do, and if you have nothing useful to do all you have around you is meaningless suffering and there’s nothing worse for your soul than meaningless suffering.\n\nNothing I’ve ever done (in terms of effort and soul) in life has been wasted. Something of value always accrued to me when I made the sacrifices necessary to do something worthwhile. So go do something!\n\nCommitment and sacrifice are the same thing.\n\nTreat yourself as if you were a creature of value. Then there’s a recognition of your divine worth.\n\nIf you don’t understand a phrase, that actually means you’ve missed something. It doesn’t mean that that’s not germane to the story, it means you’re stupid & you didn’t get it. Mmmm!\n\nIf you forthrightly pursue that which God directs you to pursue then all things are possible.\n\nThere’s no reason to bow down before evil because we’re capable of so much more.\n\nYou have to make sacrifices, and what you have to sacrifice is that which is most valuable to you currently that’s stopping you. God only knows what that is, it’s certainly the worst of you. It’s certainly that, and God only knows to what degree. You’re in love with the worst of you, so you move from the unbearable present to the ideal future. And you can’t help that.\n\nAn answer is if not that, then something. What if it’s a mistake? It’s a mistake rest assured, what do you know? You’re going to stumble around, right, and what’s going to happen is this…you’re going to move, you’re not going to stay in stasis, you’re not going to wander around in circles and I see people like that. They said, “Well, I never knew what to do and now I’m 40.” It’s like, that’s not so good. That’s not so good and you might say, “Well, there is a literature, too, that suggests that people are a lot more unhappy when they look back in their lives about the things they didn’t do than they are about the mistakes they made while they were doing things.” That’s really worth thinking about, too, because there’s redemptive mistakes and a redemptive mistake would be a mistake that you make when you go out and try to do something. You actually think, “Okay, I’m going to try to do this.” When you’re not good at it you make a bunch of mistakes. It’s like, the consequence if you pay attention is you’re not quite so stupid anymore. That’s the thing! You’ve been informed by the results of your errors and so what happens is you follow the beacon, you follow the light.\n\nThe willingness to be a fool is the precursor to transformation.\n\nWhen you realize that there is no distinction between you and your experience – they’re the same thing – then when you put together your house you’re putting together yourself.\n\nYou’re going to suffer anyway, no matter what, so why not go that extra mile and then relax, instead of doing nothing and feeling guilty? It’ll put the suffering in context & give it meaning. Re: a JP comment\n\nYou have the voice of culture within you but it’s old and dead and out-of-date, and it’s not fully articulated and updated. Then what happens is that if you enter into a dialogue with it, and you hammer yourself against the world, then you get hammered into shape and so does your conscience. So you both become elevated, and so I think that’s ridiculously cool because it means that you don’t have an infallible guide. But you do have something within you that you could build into an infallible guide if you cooperated with it. So the picture that I have in my mind of the cultivation of virtue in general is like taking a block of wood and trying to carve out a sphere out of it. It’ll never be perfectly round, but the more you carve the rounder and rounder it’ll get.\n\nShould you doubt your conscience, like what are things that we should watch out for?\n\nWhat your father, for example, says is probably not true, but some of it’s true. If someone can tell you why you’re wrong they’ve given you a great gift because then you don’t have to be wrong anymore.\n\nStop doing the things you know to be wrong, and you’ll discover just how worthwhile and rich life can be!\n\nOne of the experiences I’ve had in my life fairly commonly – their variety of different ways this is especially true when I was paying a lot of attention to my dreams which I did for about 15 years. I guess that now and then I would feel like I’d learned some things and had sort of consolidated them, and then before I went to sleep I’d think, “Okay, I’m ready to learn something else.” I didn’t say that without trepidation, and usually because when you learn something you know it’s not that pleasant because you usually learn something about why you’re wrong. The deeper the thing that you learn the more you learn about why you’re wrong, and there’s a death that’s associated with that because then you have to let that part of you that’s wrong die and that’s where the sacrifice is. So you have to make a sacrifice, you have to be willing to make a sacrifice before you’re going to learn something. Perhaps what you’ll learn is in proportion to your willingness to make a sacrifice, and I really do believe that. I also believe that because I think that if you commit to something that means that you don’t do a bunch of other things. So that’s the sacrifice of all those other things if you commit to it. You set your sights on it if you really commit to it, and you get the sacrifice right, so to speak, then the probability that that thing will be successful vastly increases. I also think that’s not a naive way of thinking, or a foolish way of thinking. My experience has been that that’s the case, and so back to the dream, I mean, I do think that we learn in trepidation…\n\nWrite for 30 mins a day about what you’ve understood of what you’ve read, and formulate clear questions and answers about it.\n\nA piece of art opens your eyes to the domain of the transcendent. The right way of thinking about a real piece of art is as a window into the transcendent. That’s what you need in your life because you’re finite and limited, and bounded by your ignorance and your lack of knowing. And unless you can make a connection with the transcendent you don’t have the strength to prevail, and that’s part of the covenant with God.\n\nIf the place that you’re in has any degree of possibility, if it isn’t inhabited by demons, so to speak, the best way to act is to lift your aim upward and attempt to get your act together, to tell the truth, to live a meaningful life and to do difficult things. All of that, and that is the best way of mastering a new territory. The degree to which you’re able to act that out is precisely proportionate to the degree to which you’re going to become a master in that territory. It’s really quite remarkable how fast you can move forward if you can establish yourself somewhere and prove yourself useful, assuming that you’re around people to whom proving yourself useful actually matters.\n\nIf you have an ideal of any sort, how is that not transcendent? It transcends you, that’s the first thing, and it doesn’t exist in reality. It exists in a place of possibility, and believe me we treat places of possibility as if they’re real because people will call on you about your possibility in your potential. They’ll say to you you’re not manifesting your full potential, and you might say, “Well, what do you mean by that?” Potential doesn’t exist. It isn’t here now. You can’t measure it, or weigh it. You can’t get a grip on it. They’ll say, “Don’t rationalize. You know perfectly well what I mean when I’m talking about your potential.” And so we could, and you do and everyone does, and everyone knows exactly what that means. So that’s a metaphysical reality that we’ll immediately accept as real, and we’ll also castigate ourselves and others for not fulfilling it because we’re just not happy when the people around us don’t fulfil their potential. You really feel that something has gone wrong, and so there’s a transcendent reality and potential. Then when you hypothesize an ideal that you might pursue, which you always do if you pursue anything, because to pursue something means you don’t already have it. You’re pursuing something that doesn’t exist and you’re probably not pursuing something that’s worse than what you already have because why would you? That’s completely counterproductive, so in in the mere fact of your pursuit of a transcendent reality that you can journey towards, that’s more valuable than the reality that you have now. That’s predicated in some sense on something like an eternal verity or an eternal truth.\n\nIf you’re suffering, ask what errors you’re making.\n\nIf there’s something holding you back, you have to let it go. You seriously have to let it go because there isn’t anything more important than progressing forward, and cheap sympathy, cheap empathy and cheap nostalgia…none of that is sufficient, none of that will work because the consequences of not putting things together immediately are dire and there’s no time to wait.\n\nStay on the Goddam path…and be careful!\n\nIf you’re not getting from people what you need, there is some possibility that you’re not approaching [them appropriately?] – especially if this happens to you repeatedly across people, and this is a virtual certainty if it happens to you repeatedly across people – especially if you have the same bad experience with people, it’s not them it’s you. That is, you get what you evoke.\n\nThere’s no excuse whatsoever for not getting at what it is that you should be doing. Don’t use catastrophe as an excuse to not do what you should, to move forward. It’s absolutely reprehensible to justify your inaction with a catastrophe that extracts mercy from other people.\n\nWhen I look at people who are bitter, and who want revenge, it’s generally because their sacrificial efforts have failed.\n\nEven when people have the kind of history that if they revealed it to you, you would say, “Well, it’s no wonder you turned out that way. The people who turn out that way still know that it’s wrong, they still know that however deep their own suffering, however arbitrary their own suffering, however much that’s caused by the malevolence of others as well as the tragedy of existence, that that does not in any way justify their turning away from the good. I believe everyone knows that. I believe that they know it implicitly, even if they don’t allow themselves to know it explicitly. I believe that. If they violate that idea then they violate themselves and that they end up in Cain’s position, which is the position of the man who’s been given a punishment that is too great to bear.\n\nDreams could be revelatory, and you can include in the dream all genuine art, all genuine literature, all the elements of human creativity that we would consider fine arts or humanities based. Anything that’s like that, that’s not ideological, would fall under the rubric of compensatory fantasy. So Jung’s idea was that the ego basically attempted to impose a coherent and somewhat simplified perspective on the world which would be like Betty’s initial viewpoint (in Lynch’s film), and that the fantasy world did everything it could to account for what that system could not account for and then to try to start making sense out of it, and the reason it used fantasy and dreams and artistic productions and so on – even rituals – is because the non-understood reality has to be acted out and presented as an image before it can be understood in any articulated manner.\n\nFor Jung the intellect and articulated knowledge occupied a very limited and circumscribed space, and then outside of that area there was the dream world which included all of artistic production and then outside of that was the unknown itself and the way the unknown was transmitted to the conscious articulated mind was through a lengthy process of dreamlike representation, and every time you go see a movie or every time you read a book of fiction or every time you have a fantasy or a dream, you’re participating in the process by which what’s truly unknown is transformed through the dream into articulated knowledge, and in any way any genuine artist does that. Psychoanalytic thought can easily become ideological as happened very frequently with Freud’s followers. It happened in the case of artists like Salvador Dali who would take Freud’s excavation of symbolic language and then use it consciously in a manner that that aped or mimicked true spontaneous symbolic expression.\n\nA real artist is someone who is isn’t using symbols to express what they’re attempting to express. A real artist is attempting to express what has not yet been expressed and has no choice other than to use imagistic or symbolic representations because there isn’t anything else yet, and you can really see this when you read someone like Nietzsche but even more so in the case of Jung who is quite obscure, but the reason he’s obscure is because of the things he was writing about, especially in his writings about alchemy.\n\nWith this act, she was better than perfect. She was perfect in the way that will make her more perfect in the future and that’s meaningful. She’s on that border between chaos and order and that’s meaningful. So what I would say is what your brain does for you is tell you when you’re in the right place at the right time by infusing your life with significance and engagement, and it’s saying, “Look, you’ve got the cosmos lined up around you. It really, truly is.” You’re in the right place at the right time. You’re in your domain of competence but you’re stretching yourself so that you’re actually improving at the same time, and that’s Perfect. I think for a long time we’ve cast doubt on the reality of meaning, and that’s part of the death of God. There’s nothing more real in life than the sense of meaning. Meaning is an unerring guide. If you’re going to allow your sense of meaning to guide you, you don’t want to lie to yourself because you pathologized the instinct.\n\nImagine someone, critically minded and rational, is standing behind you in the street as you’re listening to the great strains of a symphony and taps you on the shoulder to say, “Well, you know that Symphony is going to end, so what makes you think it has any meaning?” It’s just not the right question. It’s like, the symphony has no meaning because it ends? Well, you’re not paying attention to what’s going on. If that’s the way you think, or maybe you’re thinking too much. Yes, you’re thinking too much and not paying enough attention.\n\nThe reason you have to change is because you’re suffering unbearably, yeah, it’s as simple as that. You have to change if your life isn’t everything that it could be, unless you want to continue the suffering.\n\nBeing better is better than being who you are. It’s as simple as that. Do you want to be better than who you are, or do you want to be who you are? If you want to be better, then you welcome error. You say bring it on. I’ll try to listen. I’ll try to make the changes as rapidly as I can without tearing myself into shreds, because that can happen. I mean, you want to maintain some of your structure, but there’s such an optimistic idea that the human capacity for internal eternal transformation is the antidote to unbearable tragedy.\n\nThe thing I said before about how connecting this personal growth to the idea of the logos was really powerful, and reframing this I’ve heard you speak about this in a certain way as almost like a heroic mission. You take on ultimate responsibility for your words, you take on responsibility for moving the world either closer or further from chaos that this is really, you take on responsibility for moving the world closer to heaven or hell.\n\nWe need a message that allows you to reframe your own life in that same heroic way. You think we need a heroic story of our own to combat it? Well, what do you have otherwise? You have a life of pleasure seeking, and you have no admiration for yourself if you live a life like that.\n\nCould you describe what you mean by the rebirth of the logos? In that context, well, part of it is taking voluntary responsibility for the appalling condition of your life and the willingness to take responsibility for the shape of destiny. Essentially, that you’re a suffering creature that’s mortal and that you’re the locus of evil. Both of those things, and that it’s your response. That your life is about responsibility, and it’s your responsibility to voluntarily accept that and then to do what you can about it even though it’s in some sense you know it’s an enterprise doomed to failure. In some sense because you’re going to die, and the world is a place of carnage, and that you can accept that. If you can’t accept it, then what that means is that you’re not integrated enough because if you’re integrated enough then you can accept it. It’s the test of the integration. So your character isn’t forged sufficiently if you cannot tolerate that, and it’s not like it’s an easy thing to tolerate. Often what people do, is they just don’t think about it. They just push it out of their mind, and no wonder. But they pay for that with shallowness and with self-contempt, and with the inability to bear…\n\nAdopting responsibility is the appropriate thing to do and we need a rationale for that, because why the hell would you adopt responsibility without a rationale? It’s like the default position is aimless, impulsive, pleasure-seeking and inertia because all you have to do to have that is do nothing and that’s easy. So then the immediate question is well why not just do that? One of the answers is because you and the world will go to hell, and very rapidly. That’s a pretty good answer, and it’s actually true. You know what that means in any eternal sense is not an easy thing to say, but the proximal sense is true enough. So even if action is not morally acceptable in the face of the unkempt unfinished state of being, I guess that’s a reasonable way of thinking. Mmmmm!\n\nThere’s no better pathway to self-realization and the ennoblement of being than to posit the highest good that you can conceive of and commit yourself to it. Then you might also ask yourself, and this is definitely worth asking, “Do you really have anything better to do, and if you don’t well why would you do anything else?” So, if you orient yourself properly, and then pay attention to what you do every day…that works! I actually think that that’s in accordance with what we have come to understand about human perception, because what happens is that the world shifts itself around your aim.\n\nThe world shifts itself around your aim. You’re a creature that has an aim. You have to have an aim in order to do something. You’re an aiming creature. You look at a point and you move towards it. It’s built right into you, and so you have an aim. Let’s say your aim is the highest possible aim, well that sets up the world around you. It organizes all of your perceptions. It organizes what you see and don’t see. It organizes your emotions and your motivations so you organize yourself around that aim. Then what happens is the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems, and if you solve them properly then you stay on the pathway towards that aim and you can concentrate on the 8th day. So that way you get to have your cake and eat it too, because you can point into the distance – the far distance, and you can live “in the day”. It seems to me that that makes every moment of the day supercharged with meaning. That’s how, because if everything that you’re doing every day is related to the highest possible aim, you can conceptualize well. That’s the very definition of the meaning that would sustain you well in your life. Then the issue is back to Noah. Well, all hell is about to break loose and chaos is coming. It’s like, when that’s happening in your life you might want to be doing something that you regard as truly worthwhile, because that’s what will keep you afloat when everything is flooded and you don’t want to wait until the flood comes.\n\nNotes from the youtube video ‘Jordan Peterson – The Tragic Story of the Man-Child’\n\nPeter Pan is this Magical boy and Pan is the God of everything.\n\nChildren are magical and they can be anything. They’re nothing but potential and Peter Pan doesn’t want to give that up.\n\nThe problem with being a child is that all you are is potential and its really low resolution as you could be anything. But you’re not anything.\n\nNo, I’m not sacrificing my childhood for that….\n\nIn Neverland, while Neverland doesn’t exist, and who the hell wants to be king of the lost boys?\n\nAnd he also sacrifices the possibility that held a real relationship with a woman because that’s Wendy, and she’s kind of conservative and middle-Class.\n\nLondon dwelling girl wants to grow up and have kids and have a life. She accepts her mortality and her maturity\n\nPeter Pan has to content himself with Tinkerbell who doesn’t even exist. She’s like the fairy of porn and she’s the substitute for the real thing\n\nThere’s a sacrificial element in maturation – you have to sacrifice the Plural Potentiality of childhood for the actuality of a frame.\n\nThe question is well, why would you do that? Well, one reason is it happens to you whether you do it or not, so you can either choose your damn limitation or you can let it take you unaware when you’re 30 or older. Even worse when you’re 40 and then that is not a happy day you see, and I see people like this.\n\nAnd I think it’s more and more common in our culture because people can put off maturity without suffering an immediate penalty. But all that happens is the penalty accrues later.\n\nChoose your damn sacrifice because the sacrifice is inevitable. But at least you get to choose it.\n\nWhen you adopt an apprenticeship at least you become something and when you’re something that makes the world open up to you again. You know, like if you’re a really good plumber.\n\nThat child you left behind as you were an apprentice, but then you get to be something and regain that potential at the same time. You get to pick your damn sacrifice. You’re sacrificial whether you want to be or not.\n\n**\n\nIt’s like I’m not hearing what you think. I’m hearing how you’re able to represent the ideology you were taught, and it’s not that interesting because I don’t know anything about you. I could replace you with someone else who thinks the same way, and that means you’re not here. That’s what it means. It’s not pleasant, as you’re not integrating the specifics of your personal experience with what you’ve been taught. To synthesize something that’s genuine and surprising and engaging in a narrative sense as a consequence, and that’s the pathology of ideological possession. It’s not good, and I know where you stand on things once I know a few things. It’s like, why have a conversation? I already know where you stand on things.\n\nThe narrative they’ve been trying to paint recently is, well you know, the more identity politics leaning media types that have been covering what I’m doing have a very difficult time with it because they can only see the world through their ideological lens. The lens that they use basically assumes that the world is populated by groups, above all. They assume that every individual within that group is nothing but a mouthpiece for the group, and its claims for power. I’m trying to help people put themselves together as individuals, but that isn’t part of their narrative because within that narrative framework, which I’ve characterized in other people as well as postmodern/neo-Marxist, and even those two things don’t fit together logically very well in that narrative as there aren’t any individuals. We are just groups and power, and so when they talk about me they have to put me in a group oriented category of one form or another.\n\nIf you could be who you could be, how would you configure yourself, career, education, family? Who would you admire? You need a meaning (by adopting as much responsibility as you can) to offset the tragedy of life. So you need a noble goal. Something that ennobles you.\n\nTell the truth, or at least don’t lie.\n\nStrive to be positively predisposed towards being, towards existence, despite its fragility and suffering. So classically speaking, the two highest virtues are truth and love, and it’s difficult to put one of those ahead of the other. Love means something like hoping, hoping and striving forth.\n\nGood things tend not to happen randomly, right things fall apart randomly, so you need a vision. You need a plan for the future.\n\nCarl Jung believed that psychotherapy was unnecessary if a sufficient moral effort could be substituted. So he thought of psychotherapy as a fundamentally moral process, and really believed that it was a consequence of truth. I would say that’s true of all the clinical psychologists and psychiatrists that I’ve studied. In the final analysis, their fundamental claim is that something like a combination of courage and truth is redemptive. It’s very interesting, because it’s a restatement of a very old idea, the oldest idea in the West, perhaps, that courage and truth are redemptive.\n\nIf you’re in Freudian psychoanalysis you go into your past, and what you haven’t yet been able to process, because perhaps you’ve avoided it – that might be repression – I think it’s not a bad example of repression although sometimes you avoid something because you cannot understand, and sometimes you avoid because you will not understand. But the confrontation with what you found intolerable in the past is curative, and that’s generalized across the psychotherapeutic disciplines because … there are certain truths that are considered intolerable. In some sense you’re encouraged to voluntarily confront, to analyse, then to articulate, then to accept, and then to adapt to. And so there’s a call to courageous truthful being in the psychotherapeutic process that looks to me like a recapitulation of the psychotherapeutic process that looks to me like a recapitulation of a much older religious idea. That’s another good example of the truth that people act as fundamental moral agents. Then there’s a more prosaic element, and you can think about this. I think it’s worth thinking about the spirit of the human being as being so powerful in its potential that it could be confronted and accepted as a fundamental responsibility, and then transcended and repaired as a consequence, and so that was an inversion of the most pessimistic possible view, I suppose, which is that life is erratically suffering and malevolence. The opposite view, which is that if that is taken on voluntarily, then it’s something that can be transcended and rectified and that’s the sacred responsibility of every single person.\n\nIn a recent Atlantic Monthly article review of a political science paper, the guys took the political spectrum from radical left to radical right and then identified the racial and economic constituents of each of the groups. The most racially homogeneous group were the radical leftists – they’re all white – they’re the ones who are least convinced that current political practice is a problem, whereas the minority groups that they purport to serve are convinced in the majority that political correctness is already a problem, and they have a mean income of more than a hundred thousand dollars a year. So they’re also rich and they’re much more likely to be well educated. So paradoxically the most racially and an economically homogeneous group, the most patriarchal group across the entire political spectrum, is the radically collectivist leftists who are almost all Caucasian, well-educated and rich. In imposing their neo-colonial view of the oppression of minorities on minority groups who by a majority of above 80% across the minority groups think that political correctness has gone too far.\n\nFrom J P’s 12 Rules for Life tour in Portugal:\n\nWhat I’ve said to you tonight is that some of the fundamental elements of life is suffering, and it’s contaminated by malevolence. We need a deep meaning in order to be able to withstand that without having it corrupt us, because life is very difficult and bitter. That deep meaning is to be found in something like the adoption of responsibilities, heavy responsibility for your own well-being in the highest possible sense for the well-being of your family, and for the stability and integrity of your community. And if you fail in that, not only do you fail to bring out what’s best in you and then fail in life, and suffer for that because you certainly will; but the hole you leave in the structure of reality that could have been filled by what you could have been is going to be filled by something positively hellish. That’s on you, and so that’s a useful thing to know, because if you’re going to buttress yourself against the catastrophe of his existence with a meaningful goal, let’s say a meaningful set of responsibilities, then you actually have to understand that you have a canonical role to play. The idea in the West is that each individual is the sovereign pillar of the state, that’s what we’ve decided. We took the old Egyptian idea of sovereignty and it became universalized. It took thousands of years, so that everybody became in principle the conjoined union of Osiris and Horus, the embodiment of tradition and the vision of life. That’s the ideal person, and it’s upon that ground that the idea of this state itself, a modern democratic state where everyone’s equal before God in the law. It’s predicated on the idea that each of us are sovereign individuals, and that sovereignty carries with it a tremendous responsibility; and what’s remarkable about that responsibility is that bearing that voluntarily, is exactly the same thing as finding the most meaningful thing you can possibly do in life. That sustains you psychologically against this suffering, but it also puts the world together. It’s because if you take on that responsibility, not just psychologically, if you’re there for yourself you can put your life together and there can be a lot less foolish suffering and malevolence associated with your conduct. Then if you can get your act together in some reasonable manner, then maybe you become someone that your family can rely on, and then there’s more people you can carry. That’s the definition of strength. We have this idea that the tyrannical patriarchy is only predicated on power, and the power is associated in some fundamental manner with the arbitrary exercise of tyrannical constraint. It’s complete nonsense! Functional hierarchies are predicated on their ability to encapsulate and to utilize genuine strength, and genuine strength is the ability for you to rely on yourself, and for other people to rely on you as well. That’s way more powerful than any casual utilization of tyrannical power. Those sorts of organizations are neither stable nor productive as we know, if we look at how dictators comport themselves around the world. So the idea that our hierarchical structures, when they’re healthy, are predicated on power is absolute bloody rubbish, and it’s unbelievably dangerous. It’s an offshoot of a particularly toxic form of resentful Marxism, and it’s time for us to abandon that as a particularly bad theory. Functional hierarchies are predicated on the integrity of the individual, and an individual with integrity is not only reliable for themselves and their extended self across time which is a complicated thing, but they’re capable of bearing many people along with them and maybe the entire community. You may ask if we are capable of doing that, and well, the basic answer to that is something like…well, what’s the alternative? Perhaps we’re not capable of doing that because it’s a hell of a burden. It’s something to take on voluntarily, but the alternative as far as I can tell is if you abdicate your responsibility then terrible things happen. That’s the burden that’s placed at your feet if you are in fact the sovereign entity upon which the state rests. It’s truly on you. You think, “Well, my life has no meaning…” It’s like, well you’re not looking very hard for the meaning! Maybe you’re avoiding it because of its weight. You say, “Well, we should pursue happiness…” That’s an idea: we should pursue self-esteem or some transient idiocy of that sort. That’s not going to sustain you through the storms of life. There’s no possible act of fate that can be sustained through tragedy and catastrophe by happiness, but you can find deep meaning and responsibility. So you take that responsibility on as much as you possibly can. Then you stumble uphill with it and that stabilizes the hierarchies and keeps them healthy as long as you’re alert, and that keeps the catastrophes at bay and makes everything stack up properly.\n\nFrom JP’s talk in Slovenia:\n\nBy adopting a heroic mode of being meaning will be produced or discovered.\n\nYou’re more than you think you are. [What could this mean?]\n\nIf you look long enough into an abyss, that abyss will look at you and you’ll discover something at the bottom of it.\n\nWhat if you subject yourself to the highest possible level of necessity? Maybe then the possibility is that the best there is called forth out of you, and that’s a union with all the great – that’s the union with what’s greatest about Humanity in the past. Because that’s in you but it’s not going to come out without compulsion, and the compulsion that you set upon yourself. So that’s the antidote to the collectivist viewpoint. It’s like, it’s your problem and thank God for that because you need a problem to justify your miserable existence! It has to be a problem of sufficient magnitude so that you could look yourself in the mirror when you wake up in the morning, and you can think, “Well, despite my inadequacy and all the things about me that are insufficient, at least I’m bearing up under this worthwhile load.”\n\nAim high, but compare yourself with who you were yesterday. Incremental movement is unstoppable!\n\nAsk yourself, “How could I conceive of my life, so that if I had that life it would clearly be worth living so I wouldn’t have to be bitter, resentful, deceitful, arrogant, and vengeful?” Because that’s what endless failure does to you. It’s not good, and that’s what life without purpose and the goal does to you as well, because life is very hard.\n\nConsider saying, “I need to adopt a mode of being that would justify my suffering.” You can ask yourself the question, “What would make this niche worthwhile?” I quote Nietzsche. He said, “He who has a why can bear almost any how.” That’s a lovely line, man, I mean it’s a lovely line and it’s really worth thinking about.\n\nJP on resentment:\n\nResentment is a key human motivation, and I would say it’s a great teacher to listen to your resentment. It’s one of the best things you can possibly do. You have to admit that it exists, first, and then you have to admit to the fantasies that it’s generating. You have to admit to what you would regard as the way out of it, and that’s all very difficult because it means learning things about yourself that you probably don’t want to learn. Resentment only means one of two things. It means either shut the hell up, grow up, quit whining, and get on with it. That’s one thing it means, or someone is playing the tyrant to you. It might even be you, and you have something to say and do that you should say and do to put it to a stop. So maybe resentment can show you the pathway to doing that. It’s a meditation on resentment. One of the principles that I extracted from that is an outspoken person wants other people to change, and if you’re resentful then your motivations aren’t trustworthy. In fact, they’re very, very dark and that’s why you went to the extreme. So if I could just set it right I could learn, and I could set it right! So, I’ve been thinking about that for a very long time, and I think, if your life isn’t going the way you’d like you can find someone else to blame, which is pretty convenient for you. It’s also relatively easy or you could think, “Okay, I don’t like the way my life is unfolding. Maybe I don’t like life in general because it’s tragic and tainted with evil. How do I know if my judgement is accurate?” The question is, “Have I really done everything I possibly could to set my life straight, because maybe I shouldn’t be judging it?” It’s quality, or the quality of life itself, or being itself for that matter. If I haven’t done everything I possibly could to set my life straight….well, so there’s a task!\n\n*\n\nThe idea that what you should do if you’re feeling resentful about the nature of being, or suffering too much in your own life, let’s say, is straighten the damn thing out. Seriously! Try it for a year even, try it for a week. Try not doing the things you know you shouldn’t do. Try not saying the things you know to be false, and just watch what happens. You might as well give it a shot, right, because you say, “Well, I’m all in for a year, you know, I’m gonna do things right and then I’ll just stand back and watch how things unfold, and maybe I’ll reconsider at the end of that year. Try it, I mean, I would say I’ve had thousands of letters now from people who are saying, “Hey I tried that, you know, and hey it worked!”\n\nThe winning of an argument is not to be right, but to fix the problem.\n\nIf people are not listening to you stop talking to them, and that’s really the best piece of advice that I can give you. What happens is that if you stop talking to people who aren’t listening to you and start watching them instead, they will tell you what they’re up to. So if you have things to say and you find people that will listen, talk to them. The ones who aren’t listening will pull back because you’re devaluing what you have to say by offering it to an audience that does nothing but reject it, and that’s a good guideline to life in general. So pull back.\n\nWhat you don’t know is more important than what you know, because you just don’t know enough.\n\nYou learn things painfully, and when you learn something painfully a part of you has to die. That’s the pain you know when a dream is shattered, for example. A huge part of you that constituted that dream, maybe even the biological substrate of that gene, has to be stripped away and burned. So life is a constant process of death and rebirth, and to participate in that fully is to allow yourself to be redeemed by it. So the good is that process of death and rebirth voluntarily undertaken. You’re not as good as you could be, so you let that part of you die, and if someone comes along and says, “There’s some dead wood here, man.” It needs to be burned off and you think, “Well that other stuff’s still a bit alive.”\n\nYou have a hierarchy of values otherwise you can’t act, or you’re painfully confused. So you have a hierarchy of values and whatever is at the top of that hierarchy of values serves the function of God for you now. It may be a god that you don’t believe in, or a god that you can’t name, but it doesn’t matter because it’s God for you and what you think about God has very little impact on how God is acting within you, whatever God it is that you happen to be following.\n\nIt’s not that easy to be a good person, and once you don’t trust someone you really don’t trust them. It’s really hard for them to recover. If you don’t trust them you’re not gonna play with them, not if you have any sense and we’re really good at relationship tracking. We’re especially good at tracking behaviour that’s ethically suspect, and we remember it. One mistake will blow your reputation. It’s harsh, but it just shows you how important trust is. If you act in a trustworthy manner, and if you’re someone that can be trusted, then the probability that you’ll at least move towards some degree of success in your domain is radically increased. That’s a good deal, and then the other thing, too, is that what makes you a contender in a hierarchical game is courage, because it’s paradoxical courage which is one of the things I really like about the narrative structure of Christianity…\n\nIf you want to straighten out your brain there’s almost nothing you can do that’s better than writing. It really straightens you out to the highest level of your personality, or verbally. So you have to have an account of yourself, you have to have an articulated account of yourself, that’s where you talk to people all the time about what’s going on in your life. And if you’re disorganized at the level of the articulated account you fall into a pit. It’s a bad thing – it’s like you have a map but there are stains everywhere and there are big holes torn in it that’s half drawn in crayon. You’re not getting anywhere good with a map like that, and so you have to be able to articulate yourself. Otherwise you’re not going to move forward with a plan like that.\n\nWe know already that human perception is or around aim. Everything about us is organized around it and even the way we use our eyes is organized around aim. We’re aiming creatures, and how do you not hit something if there’s a target there? How do you miss it? Well, if one has not specified the target! So how are you gonna hit something if you don’t specify it? It sounds like, and I know that for most people life is something that happens to them, they’re reacting to things all the time. This means that they’re tangled up in someone else’s story, or they’re pawns in someone else’s aims, or they’re pawns of the aims of their own unconscious processes. You know that’s the case when you find yourself doing something that you can’t believe you did, right? I can’t believe I did that!\n\nFantasizing about how you’d like to take revenge…the reason is the inescapable brutality of life, but there’s no excuse for it just because things are terrible. It doesn’t mean that you’re justified in making them worse, so you don’t have the right to use your tragedy to make the world a worse place. I don’t say that lightly because I know that people can have brutally difficult lives, and that some people have lives that are so brutally difficult that it’s almost unimaginable.\n\nI think that we confront reality as divine centers of consciousness. I don’t think there’s a better way of saying that, and the reason I’m saying ‘divine’ is because we don’t understand consciousness at all. We don’t understand its relationship to material reality, and we do know that it’s integrally involved with consciousness. No one experiences what is there. Well, you can’t even say there’s a ‘we’ to confront potential consciously. We interact with it. How much potential is there? We’re very finite and constrained like a genie in a bottle. That’s where that idea exists. We’re constrained and there’s a reason for that. It’s a complicated reason, but what we confront seems to be something that’s essentially infinite in its potential. So then you think, well if you have an impossible problem, and you do you have an impossible problem, and so does everybody else, what do you need to solve an impossible problem? You need something infinite. You need it for the potential to solve an impossible problem. Maybe you have that right in front of you, and I actually think this is true. I think that if you conducted your life as if what you had in front of you was infinite potential then you’d find out. If what you had in front of you was infinite potential, you’d find out that was true and I think that in interacting with that you’d also find what you needed to justify the catastrophe of your life because that’s what you need to do.\n\nThat’s how we act, I think it’s what we expect. I think it’s what we need to know because you have to say that’s part of standing up straight, right? Accepting the tragedy and catastrophe of existence. This is partly why I think the West got it right, because as the central story we’re a judeo-christian culture and there’s a central story at the bottom. The story is about the radical acceptance of fragility. That’s what the crucifixion represents – the fact that that’s a voluntary act, and it’s about everybody. That’s, well, you’re gonna die. You’re gonna be betrayed. Those things are going to happen, and so you can either shrink from that and maybe envelop yourself with bitterness and hatred, and no wonder! Alternatively you can say, “Bring it on, bring it on!” So I would say, “Well, I’ve looked at dark things as much as I can.” You know what I think? That’s probably hurt me in many ways, but that’s been unbelievably helpful, you know, because the thing about darkness is it makes the light stand out, and as I look deeper and deeper into terrible things I’ve also realized that there’s something amazing about human beings, you know, because our lives are bounded by tragedy and we are capable of deep malevolence more so than you can almost imagine. But I don’t think that’s what defines us, I really don’t! I think what defines us is the ability to transcend. I truly believe that! So I’m not pessimistic. I’m optimistic and no, I do believe that people are embodied miracles!\n\nJordan Peterson on why people are deeply confused about structures of value…and Price’s Law etc:\n\nYou have to do something otherwise the consequences are dire. To do something you have to value something. It’s a definitional issue, because to do something is to act out the proposition that the thing you’re doing, the thing you’re aiming at, let’s say, is preferable to the thing you have. Preferable means you’ll do it, so those things are tied together so tightly you can’t disentangle them. If you say, “I’m aiming at X but I don’t value it.” then there’s something wrong with the way that you’re conceptualizing the statement. Because to aim at something and to work to bring it into existence is the same as valuing it, and if you say, “Well, I don’t value it.” then something’s out of kilter. Either you’re acting out a falsehood or you don’t know what you’re talking about. It’s one of those two things, and you meet people like that who are deeply confused. They’re their action patterns, and their verbal self-representation don’t mesh. That doesn’t mean that they’re critics of value, it just means that they’re deeply confused, so you have to act or you suffer in order to act. You have to have a value structure, because to act you have to value one thing more than another which means that you have to inhabit a structure of value. You have to, so you need a structure value because it’s the antidote to catastrophe. Now, if you act out a structure of value socially, which you will because you’re social, you’re not going to pursue your aims in isolation because you’re not a solitary animal. You’re a social animal, a tribal animal, deeply tribal. We live in groups. We live in families, in communities, in large societies. We’re social at every level of analysis, and we’ve been social for as long as we’ve been primates. Maybe that’s at least six million years, and it might be more like sixty million years. It’s really a long time, so it’s not an arbitrary social construction, it’s far deeper than that. Now, what happens when you act out a structure of value in the social environment? You produce a hierarchy, inevitably. Well, let’s think it through why. Let’s say that you say that one thing is more worth doing than another – whatever happens to be – and then you tell a bunch of people about what you’re doing, and they decide that they’re going to come along and help you do this thing that’s valuable because they also think it’s valuable. Maybe you get 20 people together to do this thing, whatever it happens to be, and the first thing you discover is that some of the people are way better at doing whatever it is that they’re doing than other people. Who knows why? That’s because it depends on what you chose to do. If you chose A then it would be a different group of people who were good at it, than if you chose B because people differ in their abilities. So, if you make an organization to do something valuable, the brute fact is that it will be a minority of the people who are good at doing it and there’s actually a law. It’s called Price’s Law, and it’s a real law. It even governs the size of cities, the mass of stars and the heights of plants in the jungle. It doesn’t just govern human interactions. Price’s Law says that the square root of the number of people engaged in an enterprise will do half the work, so if you have ten people doing something three of them will do half the work. But…\n\nIt’s often the case that you wake up at four in the morning, or at least sometimes the case, that you wake up at four in the morning when things haven’t been going that well and wonder just what the hell the point is of your futile and miserable life. You have to have something real to set against that. It can’t be just rationalizations about how, you know, you are a valuable person among others. Even though that’s true, that’s not good enough. You need something that’s more realistic to set against that. And observing courage in yourself is definitely one of the things that can help you sleep soundly at night, when things are destabilized a little bit around you.\n\nAs a clinical psychologist I’ve learned how to talk to people very rapidly, and I have the most amazing adventures with people in cabs when I travel, because I’ll talk to them directly right away and they’ll tell me the wildest stories and show me the craziest things because I’m actually interested in what they have to say. I’m not afraid, well I’m somewhat afraid, but I’m not I’m not sufficiently afraid to have that stop me. I’m acting on the presupposition that the person has something of great interest to reveal, because one of the things that’s really cool about people, and you really learn this as a clinical psychologist, is that if you can get people talking they’re so damn interesting. You can hardly stand it! They have these idiosyncratic experiences that are only theirs, they’re only theirs personally, no one else could tell their story. Those are the kind of stories that you want to hear, and when they tell you those stories you learn something you didn’t know. What that means is that you can treat the landscape of strangers as an endless vista of places to learn things you didn’t know. If you know enough so that you’re satisfied with your life and everything has ceases to be a tragedy around you, then you can be comfortable in your circumscribed domain of totalitarian knowledge. But if your life is insufficient and you’re suffering more than you want to, and everything isn’t what it should be, then you need to look where you haven’t looked for what you don’t have. Then you can look outside beyond you, and then you can make friends with what you don’t understand and that’s a huge part of what this story is about.\n\nThe implicit presupposition in our legal structure is that no matter who you are, even if you’re a murderer, even if you’re a condemned murderer, there’s something about you that’s of transcendent value. That has to be respected by the law, by the law and by other people. There’s something about us that has to be respected by ourselves in relationship to ourselves by ourselves, in relationship to other people. Even more strangely by ourselves in relationship to criminals even, to vicious criminals. You can’t remove that transcendent element, and to me that’s also a mirror, a miracle of conceptualization, because who the hell is going to think that even the most vicious of murderers has a touch of the transcendent that needs to be respected.\n\nThe nobler your aim, the better your life:\n\nThe idea of the noble aim is the bread that people cannot live without. That’s not physical bread, it’s the noble aim, and that was encapsulated in part of the story of Marduk – that’s tough. It’s to pay attention, it’s to speak properly, it’s to confront chaos, it’s to make a better world, it’s something like that, so that you can stand up without cringing at the very thought of your own existence, so that you can do something that’s worthwhile to justify your wretched position on the planet.\n\nJordan Peterson on the emasculation of human male:\n\nI have a hypothesis about the feminist end of the postmodern radical leftist movement, and this isn’t something I’ve talked about much in public but here goes. This should give me lots of trouble, and there’s a variety of things that are tangled together here. We don’t know how female biology would manifest itself politically. Male biology does, female biology is going to and that’s because female political activity on the largest possible scale is a relatively new phenomenon. It isn’t obviously the case that men and women’s views of the world are going to dovetail precisely, so here’s a hypothesis. One thing that a woman really wants to know about a man, or perhaps you might say one thing that a female wants to know about masculinity is that he’s not a predatory tyrant. What I mean first of all is there’s fragility, and feminine sexuality is so to a greater degree than there is in male sexuality because women bear a higher price for sexual misadventure. They are perhaps more prone to exploitation by force, but more than that part of being a woman is having the possibility of bringing something extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable and valuable into the world. The first concern might be if you are a predator. Fundamentally are you a predator, and so what I see happening in the in the feminist disciplines like gender studies is the politicization of that accusation, and the accusation is to prove to me that you’re not predator-like in the fundamental element of your masculinity. Not only historically but now, because the cost of you being a predators is too high. Now I feel that that’s inappropriate, I think that’s what’s driving the demolition of the idea of presumption of innocence, for example. We’ll start with presumption of guilt and you’ll have prove to me that you’re innocent. I think the problem with that isn’t that there are no predatory men, because there are plenty of predatory men. The problem is that the courageous way to deal with the problem of the predator, is to offer a hand in courageous trust and to invite forward a partner from the monster. That’s the mythological manner in which this is supposed to be undertaken. The courageous a part of the woman’s journey, let’s say, is to face the monstrosity of a man and to invite out of that something more noble to emerge, and there’s courage in that in genuine risk. I think that that’s foregone in the accusation process, and then the other element of that seems to me to be that if you are a predator, and you’re irredeemable in your predatory nature, then the best thing to do is to render you harmless. If we’re going to obscure the relationship between competence and power, and assume that all of your striving upward is merely a manifestation of power, then what we’ll do is weaken you as much as possible, so that harmlessness can replace virtue. I see all of that driving these resentful disciplines in there, and their ideology. That’s the evil queen who’s lurking there somewhere.\n\n*\n\nThat which is religious is what you act out. Anything you act out. Everything you act out is predicated on your implicit axioms, and the system of implicit axioms that you hold as primary is your religious belief system. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an atheist or not, that’s just surface – that’s just surface noise. It has nothing to do with divinity or dance, or it doesn’t necessarily have to do with those. It probably has to do with it, too, but it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with your voluntarily articulated statements about whether or not you believe in something like a transcendent deity. I mean, what you act out is much more what you are than what you say about yourself, and what the hell do you know about what you believe, anyways? You’re complicated, man! We’re not transparent to ourselves at all, that’s why we have to go to university and study psychology.\n\nHow the hell can we propose to understand ourselves? You know, I’m existentially oriented, which is to say that I think that what you hold to be true is best determined as a consequence of an analysis of your actions, rather than as a consequence of an analysis of what you purport to believe.\n\nA valid goal is, by necessity, something valued. We experience much of our positive emotion in relation to goals. We are not happy, technically speaking, unless we see ourselves progressing — and the very idea of progression implies value. Worse yet is the fact that the meaning of life without positive value is not simply neutral. Because we are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering that is intrinsic to Being. We must have the meaning inherent in a profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes paramount. Then, nihilism beckons, with its hopelessness and despair. So: no value, no meaning. [P.17 in 12 Rules…]\n\nI have some sympathy for the naive fundamentalist. What they’re basically saying is something like this, “Look, we have an ethos that’s valuable. You scientist types are casually dismantling it. What the hell are we supposed to do?” The fundamentalists don’t know what to do about that. They say, “Well, creationism is science.” Well, no it’s not, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t have a point. Their point is there’s something valuable here, it’s like …don’t break it casually. What are we gonna replace it with? The new atheists wish that everybody becomes rational. It’s like, yeah sure, that’s gonna happen!\n\nThe truth is something that burns, it burns off dead wood, and people don’t like having their dead wood burned off.\n\nThe more responsibility you take on, the more meaning your life has.\n\nDo feminists avoid criticizing Islam because they unconsciously long for masculine dominance?\n\n“Life is suffering. Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated. Truth is the handmaiden of love and dialogue is the pathway to truth. Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small. So speech must be untrammelled, so that dialogue can take place, so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward to the Kingdom of God”\n\nIn the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all.\n\nJordan Peterson says you need to know who you are and where you are, what you should be doing, and determine where you are going…\n\nYou need to consider the future and think, “What might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly? What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences? What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?” You need to know where you are, so you can start to chart your course. You need to know who you are, so that you understand your armament and bolster yourself in respect to your limitations. You need to know where you are going, so that you can limit the extent of chaos in your life, restructure order, and bring the divine force of Hope to bear on the world.\n\nYou must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel. You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play. You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself. You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person. It would be good to make the world a better place. Heaven, after all, will not arrive of its own accord. We will have to work to bring it about, and strengthen ourselves, so that we can withstand the deadly angels and flaming sword of judgment that God used to bar its entrance.\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of vision and direction. These are irresistible forces, able to transform what might appear to be unconquerable obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunities. Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your Being. As the great nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so brilliantly noted, “He whose life has a why can bear almost any how.”\n\nYou could help direct the world, on its careening trajectory, a bit more toward Heaven and a bit more away from Hell. Once having understood Hell, researched it, so to speak—particularly your own individual Hell—you could decide against going there or creating that. You could aim elsewhere. You could, in fact, devote your life to this. That would give you a Meaning, with a capital M. That would justify your miserable existence. That would atone for your sinful nature, and replace your shame and self-consciousness with the natural pride and forthright confidence of someone who has learned once again to walk with God in the Garden. [12 Rules… pp. 53-4]\n\nJP meditation:\n\nWho are you? You think you know, but maybe you don’t. You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave. You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs). You are interested in some things and not in others. You can shape that interest, but there are limits. Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.\n\nYou have a nature. You can play the tyrant to it, but you will certainly rebel. How hard can you force yourself to work and sustain your desire to work? How much can you sacrifice to your partner before generosity turns to resentment? What is it that you actually love? What is it that you genuinely want? Before you can articulate your own standards of value, you must see yourself as a stranger — and then you must get to know yourself. What do you find valuable or pleasurable? How much leisure, enjoyment, and reward do you require, so that you feel like more than a beast of burden? How must you treat yourself, so you won’t kick over the traces and smash up your corral? You could force yourself through your daily grind and kick your dog in frustration when you come home. You could watch the precious days tick by.\n\nOr you could learn how to entice yourself into sustainable, productive activity. Do you ask yourself what you want? Do you negotiate fairly with yourself? Or are you a tyrant, with yourself as slave? When do you dislike your parents, your spouse, or your children, and why? What might be done about that? What do you need and want from your friends and your business partners? This is not a mere matter of what you should want. I’m not talking about what other people require from you, or your duties to them. I’m talking about determining the nature of your moral obligation, to yourself. Should might enter into it, because you are nested within a network of social obligations. Should is your responsibility, and you should live up to it. But this does not mean you must take the role of lap-dog, obedient and harmless. That’s how a dictator wants his slaves.\n\nDare, instead, to be dangerous. Dare to be truthful. Dare to articulate yourself, and express (or at least become aware of) what would really justify your life. If you allowed your dark and unspoken desires for your partner, for example, to manifest themselves—if you were even willing to consider them—you might discover that they were not so dark, given the light of day. You might discover, instead, that you were just afraid and, so, pretending to be moral. You might find that getting what you actually desire would stop you from being tempted and straying. Are you so sure that your partner would be unhappy if more of you rose to the surface? The femme fatale and the anti-hero are sexually attractive for a reason. [12 Rules… pp. 69-70]\n\nAim small. You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility. Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning. Then you ask yourself, “What could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward?” Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly. Then you give yourself that damn coffee, in triumph. Maybe you feel a bit stupid about it, but you do it anyway. And you do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that’s magic. That’s compound interest. Do that for three years, and your life will be entirely different. Now you’re aiming for something higher. Now you’re wishing on a star. Now the beam is disappearing from your eye, and you’re learning to see. And what you aim at determines what you see. That’s worth repeating. What you aim at determines what you see. [12 Rules… p. 72-3]\n\nYou have a religious substructure whether you or know it or not. So you might as well know it because if you knew it, things would work better.\n\nRe-read and understand this:\n\nThere’s a profound idea in the ancient Vedic texts (the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, and part of the bedrock of Indian culture): the world, as perceived, is maya — appearance or illusion. This means, in part, that people are blinded by their desires (as well as merely incapable of seeing things as they truly are). This is true, in a sense that transcends the metaphorical. Your eyes are tools. They are there to help you get what you want. The price you pay for that utility, that specific, focused direction, is blindness to everything else. This doesn’t matter so much when things are going well, and we are getting what we want (although it can be a problem, even then, because getting what we currently want can make blind us to higher callings). But all that ignored world presents a truly terrible problem when we’re in crisis, and nothing whatsoever is turning out the way we want it to. Then, there can be far too much to deal with. Happily, however, that problem contains within it the seeds of its own solution. Since you’ve ignored so much, there is plenty of possibility left where you have not yet looked.\n\nImagine that you’re unhappy. You’re not getting what you need. Perversely, this may be because of what you want. You are blind, because of what you desire. Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for. And that brings us to something else: the price that must be paid before you, or anyone, can get what they want (or, better yet, what they need). Think about it this way. You look at the world in your particular, idiosyncratic manner. You use a set of tools to screen most things out and let some things in. You have spent a lot of time building those tools. They’ve become habitual. They’re not mere abstract thoughts. They’re built right into you. They orient you in the world. They’re your deepest and often implicit and unconscious values. They’ve become part of your biological structure. They’re alive. And they don’t want to disappear, or transform, or die. But sometimes their time has come, and new things need to be born. For this reason (although not only for this reason) it is necessary to let things go during the journey uphill. If things are not going well for you — well, that might be because, as the most cynical of aphorisms has it, life sucks, and then you die. Before your crisis impels you to that hideous conclusion, however, you might consider the following: life doesn’t have the problem. You do. At least that realization leaves you with some options. If your life is not going well, perhaps it is your current knowledge that is insufficient, not life itself. Perhaps your value structure needs some serious retooling. Perhaps what you want is blinding you to what else could be. Perhaps you are holding on to your desires, in the present, so tightly that you cannot see anything else — even what you truly need.\n\nImagine that you are thinking, enviously, “I should have my boss’s job.” If your boss sticks to his post, stubbornly and competently, thoughts like that will lead you into in a state of irritation, unhappiness and disgust. You might realize this. You think, “I am unhappy. However, I could be cured of this unhappiness if I could just fulfil my ambition.” But then you might think further. “Wait,” you think. “Maybe I’m not unhappy because I don’t have my boss’s job. Maybe I’m unhappy because I can’t stop wanting that job.” That doesn’t mean you can just simply and magically tell yourself to stop wanting that job, and then listen and transform. You won’t — can’t, in fact — just change yourself that easily. You have to dig deeper. You must change what you are after more profoundly.\n\nSo, you might think, “I don’t know what to do about this stupid suffering. I can’t just abandon my ambitions. That would leave me nowhere to go. But my longing for a job that I can’t have isn’t working.” You might decide to take a different tack. You might ask, instead, for the revelation of a different plan: one that would fulfil your desires and gratify your ambitions in a real sense, but that would remove from your life the bitterness and resentment with which you are currently affected. You might think, “I will make a different plan. I will try to want whatever it is that would make my life better — whatever that might be — and I will start working on it now. If that turns out to mean something other than chasing my boss’s job, I will accept that and I will move forward.”\n\nNow you’re on a whole different kind of trajectory. Before, what was right, desirable, and worthy of pursuit was something narrow and concrete. But you became stuck there, tightly jammed and unhappy. So you let go. You make the necessary sacrifice, and allow a whole new world of possibility, hidden from you because of your previous ambition, to reveal itself. And there’s a lot there. What would your life look like, if it were better? What would life itself look like? What does “better” even mean? You don’t know. And it doesn’t matter that you don’t know, exactly, right away, because you will start to slowly see what is “better,” once you have truly decided to want it. You will start to perceive what remained hidden from you by your presuppositions and preconceptions — by the previous mechanisms of your vision. You will begin to learn.\n\nThis will only work, however, if you genuinely want your life to improve. You can’t fool your implicit perceptual structures. Not even a bit. They aim where you point them. To retool, to take stock, to aim somewhere better, you have to think it through, bottom to top. You have to scour your psyche. You have to clean the damned thing up. And you must be cautious, because making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.\n\nWhat if it was the case that the world revealed whatever goodness it contains in precise proportion to your desire for the best? What if the more your conception of the best has been elevated, expanded and rendered sophisticated the more possibility and benefit you could perceive? This doesn’t mean that you can have what you want merely by wishing it, or that everything is interpretation, or that there is no reality. The world is still there, with its structures and limits. As you move along with it, it cooperates or objects. But you can dance with it, if your aim is to dance — and maybe you can even lead, if you have enough skill and enough grace. This is not theology. It’s not mysticism. It’s empirical knowledge. There is nothing magical here — or nothing more than the already-present magic of consciousness. We only see what we aim at. The rest of the world (and that’s most of it) is hidden. If we start aiming at something different—something like “I want my life to be better” — our minds will start presenting us with new information, derived from the previously hidden world, to aid us in that pursuit. Then we can put that\n\ninformation to use and move, and act, and observe, and improve. And, after doing so, after improving, we might pursue something different, or higher — something like, “I want whatever might be better than just my life being better.” And then we enter a more elevated and more complete reality. 12 Rules… p. 74-5\n\nPeople who don’t stray from their security won’t find the security contained within chaos.\n\nYour identity is what you use to operate in the world. It’s what makes you a functional person, and not only as far as other people are concerned but also as far as nature itself is concerned. An identity is more like the tool-kit with which you use to operate in the world. So being black, white or gay isn’t a tool-kit to operate in the world – at best it’s a shallow description of one dimension of your being. It’s not some subjective whim. An identity is something that you have to negotiate with other people because they need to trade with you. You have something to offer, and if I have something to offer then we can communicate. Hopefully it’s good for you and for me, and we both benefit from that. That’s identity!\n\nWhen I finished my first provisional examination of the sorts of motivations that drove people to set up concentration camps, and to torture people terribly in those camps, I came to understand why it is that people are dependent on their group identity in their cultural identification. It’s because that helped them protect themselves from their own vulnerability. You have to believe things, because you just don’t know everything. So you have to believe things. They fill in the gaps, the beliefs fill in the gaps. If the beliefs are stripped from you, then your defences against the infinite are stripped, and it’s no wonder that people will defend their beliefs. I thought, well you do. If you’re too involved in defending your beliefs, you’re going to be willing to kill other people in their defence. We’re so technologically powerful now that we can no longer be willing to kill other people in the defence of our own beliefs because the time for that is passed. I realized, that if you don’t stand up for your beliefs you leave yourself bereft. You’re open to the depredations of the infinite, and that’s equally intolerable.\n\nJordan Peterson’s Summary on Tragedy vs Evil:\n\nI said that tragedy is a precondition for being. Being is the interplay between the finite and the infinite, and in that interplay there’s tragedy. There’s no way out of that. Evil is something different. Evil is the conscious attempt to make the conditions of existence more pathological than they have to be, and it’s motivated by conscious intent. The motivations arise because people pay a terrible price for their self- conscious awareness, and that awareness is their awareness of their vulnerability and that is a terrible thing to be aware of. That vulnerability can be confronted if forthrightly accepted, and the appropriate decisions made. Alternatively people can retreat into their own rationalistic arrogance and attempt to deceive themselves and everyone else about the nature of their own existence and about the nature of reality. That pathway leads to nothing but destruction. I think that there’s good reason to assume that it’s too late in the developmental course as a species for that path to be acceptable anymore because we’re too powerful. If too many people stay on that path we’re going to do ourselves in, and so I would say as we’ve become more technologically powerful an increasing moral burden is being placed on each of us. It matters to the destiny of the cosmos whether or not you get your moral act straight, and I don’t mean that in a trivial way. I believe that that’s as close to an empirical fact as anything that can be demonstrated. I also believe that’s as terrifying a thing to consider as anything you could possibly imagine, and maybe it’s too much to ask of people but you know our great religious traditions do continually remind us that inside every human being there’s a spark of divinity and that idea is a precondition for our entire system of law. There’s always the possibility that it’s true, and if it’s true it means that there’s an infinite avenue of potential that lays open to every single person and that the ability to transform the terrible conditions of reality into something not only acceptable but worthy of celebration actually lies within our grasp. An alternative to that is the continual generation of a kind of hell that’s so incomprehensibly awful that by any reasonable personal standards it has to be regarded as something to avoid. That’s all I have to say about that.\n\n*\n\nPeople think often in the Mephistophelean manner, although they seldom act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of school, college and theatre. Whenever we experience injustice, real or imagined; whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the machinations of others; whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own apparently arbitrary limitations — the temptation to question Being and then to curse it rises foully from the darkness. Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody, horrible planet is this, anyway? [12 Rules… p. 102]\n\nThings that terrify you contain things of value.\n\nBeing is worth the suffering, so find a mode of being that allows you to make that claim in reality. I would say that’s your existential destiny, and if you’re here at university rather than a trade school your job is to figure out how to be a human being, and that’s a much more important job than any specific time limited concrete pragmatic plan. You have an unlimited possibility for good.\n\nSome of the time you’ll be bored, in which case you’re either undisciplined or you’re probably pursuing something you don’t want to pursue, and some of the time you’ll actually be engaged in life. The times that you’re engaged in life you won’t notice that you’re there, right? The distinction between subject and object disappears when you’re engaged in something that you find meaningful. The purpose of life, as far as I can tell, from studying mythology and from studying psychology for decades, is to find a mode of being that’s so meaningful that the fact that life is suffering is no longer relevant, or maybe that it’s even acceptable. I would say as well that people know when they’re doing that. You know when you’re doing that, in part, because you’re no longer resentful. You think, “Jesus, I could do this forever!” Right? There’s a timelessness that’s associated with that state of being from a mythological perspective that’s equivalent to brief habitation of the kingdom of God. That’s the place where you are that’s so meaningful it enables you to bear the harsh preconditions of life without becoming resentful, bitter or cruel, and there’s nothing that you can pursue in your life that will be half as useful as that. Your nervous system being an evolved structure, is evolved for a universe that is composed of the interaction between chaos and order. Those are the most fundamental constants that we know. They transcend the mere perception of objects.\n\nExtract from “Dr Jordan B Peterson | *full-length* 2014 interview”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis&index=69&t=41s&list=WL\n\nSo there’s no doubt that empirical science has kicked the slats out of the way people think about religion because it wasn’t easy for people to understand that there could be different – that different systems of thought might have different purposes. You have to be a philosopher of thought to think about that, even. And I don’t think it was – I don’t think that became obvious at all until after Nietzsche. Not all belief systems serve the same masters, so to speak. And so you can’t assume that every system of thought is doing the same thing. And then, you can’t assume also, that there’s only one way to formulate your basic assumptions about the nature of reality. I mean, Heidegger. I didn’t discover the relationship between the system of thought that I derived say, from Nietzsche and Jung and some other people that I read, and Heidegger, until much after I had written Maps of Meaning. But Heidegger’s study of being is predicated on the idea that being is the fundamental reality, and that is not objective reality. It’s not material reality. It’s lived experience, something like that. Lived experience is real. OK? That’s a pre-supposition. So you start with that pre-supposition, then you ask yourself, well, what are the basic elements of lived reality? And then, what happens there – or at least what seems to have happened – is that Heidegger identified the same basic elements of lived reality that I identified in Maps of Meaning. And one was the social world – the world that’s constructed by humans – which I think is basically an elaborated dominance hierarchy. And it’s permanent. So this is where the issue about what constitutes reality. Dominance hierarchies are 300 million years old. They’re older than trees. So if you think that one definition of what’s real is what’s persistent across time, then it’s almost impossible to find anything more real about life than a dominance hierarchy.\n\n*\n\nSometimes, when things are not going well, it’s not the world that’s the cause. The cause is instead that which is currently most valued, subjectively and personally. Why? Because the world is revealed, to an indeterminate degree, through the template of your values. If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore, it’s time to examine your values. It’s time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. It’s time to let go. It might even be time to sacrifice what you love best, so that you can become who you might become, instead of staying who you are. [12 Rules… p. 113]\n\nThere’s lots of other things that work better than thinking. Paying attention is better than thinking. It’s much better than thinking. Paying attention allows you to listen to people who don’t agree with you. Paying attention allows you learn things that you don’t already know. So you know, if it’s thinking or attention that should be the God, it’s like, attention rules. Thinking, that’s a subordinate phenomena.\n\nYou could say that the image of Christ is the West’s attempt to most accurately represent the path of being that constitutes success across an infinite set of dominance hierarchies. That’s essentially – or that’s at least one way of looking at it. Christ is like a hero, but he’s sort of a meta-hero, right? He’s the amalgam of many, many, many heroes. But the hero has key attributes. Like the hero, for example, is always encountering chaos and defeating it. Well, that’s the human path. You know, we encounter chaos. It’s often a snake. Well, that also points to its deep evolutionary roots.\n\nIf you’re studying information, you can’t study it objectively. Because as you study the information, you get informed. That changes you. And so the problem with studying this sort of thing is that you can’t study it without being changed. Because if you’re not changed by studying it, you’re not studying it. You’re no anthropologist who’s outside of this. You can’t be. Because if you’re outside of it, you don’t understand it. Because if you understand it, then you’re not the same person anymore. So you can’t keep it at bay.\n\n*\n\nOne of the things I realized when I started studying this was that virtually everything I said was a lie. I would say 99%. And by lie, I mean, it was manipulative. It was unclear. It was vague. And that was all often motivated. Or, it was a false attempt to gain dominance status, which is typical of someone who’s intellectual. It’s like, well, I’ve got these ideas. I’ve taken them from places. And now I can use them as, say, a status weapon, something like that, which is what people do when they’re trying to win an argument, say. It’s like, that’s all lies. Well, that’s rough when it’s 99% of what you say. First of all, the first thing you realize is how much you aren’t. You’re not Nietzsche. You have your experiences, your claim to reality, and it’s often pretty thin. But the development of authentic speech is worth the price that you have to pay for it. But you just can’t stay detached from this. This isn’t the phenomenon to study. It’s the basis of being.\n\nI think there are ways of living that are worse than death. That’s why people commit suicide. That’s their decision. So obviously, hell is worse than death given how I described it earlier. So it isn’t death that’s the problem. It’s complexity that’s the problem, that things are beyond us. And because of that, they always exceed what our models tell us they’re going to do. Or, they always transform themselves in some ungainly way so that we don’t get what we want. So then the question is, well, how do you best deal with complexity? And the reason I think truth is so useful is because generally it reduces complexity.
