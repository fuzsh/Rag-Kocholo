        "text": "Ingrid Bergman was one of the greatest actresses from Hollywood's lamented Golden Era. Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, tied with Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand, all three of them second only to Katharine Hepburn.\n\nIngrid Bergman was born on August 29, 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, to a German mother, Frieda Henrietta (Adler), and a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman, an artist and photographer. Her mother died when she was only two and her father died when she was 12. She went to live with an elderly uncle.\n\nThe woman who would be one of the top stars in Hollywood in the 1940s had decided to become an actress after finishing her formal schooling. She had had a taste of acting at age 17 when she played an uncredited role of a girl standing in line in the Swedish film Landskamp (1932) in 1932 - not much of a beginning for a girl who would be known as \"Sweden's illustrious gift to Hollywood.\" Her parents died when she was just a girl and the uncle she lived with didn't want to stand in the way of Ingrid's dream. The next year she enrolled at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm but decided that stage acting was not for her. It would be three more years before she would have another chance at a film. When she did, it was more than just a bit part. The film in question was Munkbrogreven (1935), where she had a speaking part as Elsa Edlund. After several films that year that established her as a class actress, Ingrid appeared in Intermezzo (1936) as Anita Hoffman. Luckily for her, American producer David O. Selznick saw it and sent a representative from Selznick International Pictures to gain rights to the story and have Ingrid signed to a contract. Once signed, she came to California and starred in United Artists' 1939 remake of her 1936 film, Intermezzo (1939), reprising her original role. The film was a hit and so was Ingrid.\n\nHer beauty was unlike anything the movie industry had seen before and her acting was superb. Hollywood was about to find out that they had the most versatile actress the industry had ever seen. Here was a woman who truly cared about the craft she represented. The public fell in love with her. Ingrid was under contract to go back to Sweden to film En enda natt (1939) in 1939 and Juninatten (1940) in 1940. Back in the US she appeared in three films, all well-received. She made only one film in 1942, but it was the classic Casablanca (1942) opposite Humphrey Bogart.\n\nIngrid was choosing her roles well. In 1943 she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Wem die Stunde schlägt (1943), the only film she made that year. The critics and public didn't forget her when she made Das Haus der Lady Alquist (1944) the following year--her role of Paula Alquist got her the Oscar for Best Actress. In 1945 Ingrid played in Ich kämpfe um dich (1945), Spiel mit dem Schicksal (1945) and Die Glocken von St. Marien (1945), for which she received her third Oscar nomination for her role of Sister Benedict. She made no films in 1947, but bounced back with a fourth nomination for Johanna von Orleans (1948). In 1949 she went to Italy to film Stromboli (1950), directed by Roberto Rossellini. She fell in love with him and left her husband, Dr. Peter Lindstrom, and daughter, Pia Lindström. America's \"moral guardians\" in the press and the pulpits were outraged. She was pregnant and decided to remain in Italy, where her son was born. In 1952 Ingrid had twins, Isotta and Isabella Rossellini, who became an outstanding actress in her own right, as did Pia.\n\nIngrid continued to make films in Italy and finally returned to Hollywood in 1956 in the title role in Anastasia (1956), which was filmed in England. For this she won her second Academy Award. She had scarcely missed a beat. Ingrid continued to bounce between Europe and the US making movies, and fine ones at that. A film with Ingrid Bergman was sure to be a quality production. In her final big-screen performance in 1978's Herbstsonate (1978) she had her final Academy Award nomination. Though she didn't win, many felt it was the most sterling performance of her career. Ingrid retired, but not before she gave an outstanding performance in the mini-series Golda Meir (1982), a film about Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. For this she won an Emmy Award as Best Actress, but, unfortunately, she did not live to see the fruits of her labor.\n\nIngrid died from cancer on August 29, 1982, her 67th birthday, in London, England.\n\nMax von Sydow was born Carl Adolf von Sydow on April 10, 1929 in Lund, Skåne, Sweden, to a middle-class family. He was the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his partial German ancestry.\n\nWhen he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including Yvonne Lombard, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school (1948-1951), together with Lars Ekborg, Margaretha Krook and Ingrid Thulin. His first role was as Nils the crofter in Alf Sjöberg's Rya Rya nur eine Mutter (1949). After graduation, he worked at the city theatres in Norrköping and Malmö.\n\nHis work in the movies by Ingmar Bergman (especially Das siebente Siegel (1957), including the iconic scenes in which he plays chess with Death) made him well-known internationally, and he started to get offers from abroad. His career abroad began with him playing Jesus in Die größte Geschichte aller Zeiten (1965); Hawaii (1966) and Das Quiller Memorandum - Gefahr aus dem Dunkel (1966). Since then, his career includes very different kind of characters, like Karl Oskar Nilsson in Emigranten (1971); Father Lankester Merrin in Der Exorzist (1973); Joubert the assassin in Die drei Tage des Condor (1975), Emperor Ming in Flash Gordon (1980); the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Sag Niemals Nie (1983); Liet-Kynes in Der Wüstenplanet (1984) the artist Frederick in Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986); Lassefar in Pelle - Der Eroberer (1987), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination; Dr. Peter Ingham in Zeit des Erwachens (1990); Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002) and The Renter in Extrem laut & unglaublich nah (2011), which earned him his second Academy Award nomination.\n\nHe became one of Sweden's most admired and professional actors, and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. He was nominated twice: for Pelle - Der Eroberer (1987) in 1988 and for Extrem laut & unglaublich nah (2011) in 2012. He received the Guldbagge Award for Best Director in his directing debut, the drama film Ved vejen (1988). In 2016, he joined the sixth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011) as the Three-eyed Raven, which earned him his Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nMax von Sydow died on March 8, 2020, in Provence, France, and was survived by his wife Catherine Brelet and four children. He was 90.\n\nAssumpta Serna was born in Barcelona, Spain. She studied Law but abandoned it for her real passion, acting. Her career has spanned over 227 films, 27 as a lead and 43 TV projects in over 20 countries. She has won more than thirty best actress awards throughout the world (Spain, France, Italy, USA, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay...). She has worked as an actress in all six of the languages she speaks: Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and English.\n\nA few of her many films are: Uncertainty - Kopf oder Zahl (2008) with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, Pedro Almodóvar's Matador (1986), the 1993 Spanish Oscar entry El maestro de esgrima (1992) directed by Pedro Olea, María Luisa Bemberg's film, Ich, die Unwürdigste von allen (1990), Der Hexenclub (1996) for Columbia Tri Star, Samuel Fuller's The Day of Reckoning, Wilde Orchidee (1989), opposite Mickey Rourke.

Murray Abraham, Im Bann der Leidenschaft (1983), with Max von Sydow, The PianoTuner of EarthQuakes (2004) by the Quay Brothers and produced by Terry Gilliam and Teufel im Paradies (1994) with Charles Dance.\n\nHer performances have been acclaimed in popular British TV series such as Sharpe where she played the feisty guerrilla leader Teresa opposite Sean Bean and in Henry VIII, with Ray Winstone, playing the King's first wife Catherine of Aragon. In Spain she was a regular on the country's most popular TV show Aquí no hay quien viva (2003). In 2011, she played Vanozza, the mother of Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, in the series Borgia (2011), written and produced by Tom Fontana, shown in 35 countries.\n\nShe was elected to the board of the European Film Academy representing Spain for 6 years and responsible for the organization of the European Film awards (2004) in Barcelona (with a 1.8 million euro budget). Whist living in Los Angeles she was an active member of the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences, serving on the committee for Foreign film. She was the first Spanish actress to be honored with membership to AMPAS. She has been a proud member since 1993 and has served on the Executive Committee of the Actor's Branch.\n\nShe has sat on juries in International film festivals around the world, such as Chicago, Venice, San Sebastian, Mar del Plata (Argentina), Biarritz, Rio de Janeiro, Montreal, Karlovy Vary, Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), Brussels, Cluj (Romania), and Rome.\n\nShe was elected President of AISGE in 2002. AISGE is the organization in Spain that deals with the task of managing and protecting the intellectual property rights of actors. She was also voted vice-president of ARTIS, the European Association of intellectual property rights for actors. After the release of her first book she began teaching workshops in Universities and Film Schools on the subject of screen-acting. In 2005 founded with Scott Cleverdon first team an international non-profit film foundation.

Based in Spain, first team offers a pioneering university course on Screen Acting for actors, believed to be the first of its kind in the world and tuition programs for directors and scriptwriters.\n\nHer book, El trabajo del actor de cine was the first to be written in Spanish regarding the craft of film-acting. She followed it up with Monologues in V.O, a resource for auditioning actors.\n\nShe continues to work and teach in Madrid, Barcelona and throughout the world as actress and acting coach.\n\nTogether with Scott Cleverdon , they have taught over 13,000 hours and trained over 4,000 actors, actresses, filmmakers and business people.\n\nJoaquim de Almeida was born in Lisbon, Portugal. Son of two pharmacists and the sixth of eight kids, Joaquim showed signs at an early age that his future lay not in the family business. At the age of eighteen, after attending the theater course at the Lisbon Conservatory for two years, he left Portugal to pursue his studies after the Conservatory was temporarily closed following the 1974 democratic revolution. He lived a year in Vienna, Austria, working in various jobs from the Künstlerhaus-Theater to gardening. He moved to New York City in 1976. There, he studied with Lee Strasberg, Nicholas Ray and Stella Adler while working as a bartender. After doing some theater and small roles in Soap Operas, he finally landed his first role in a film \"The Soldier\" in 1981. The following year he had his first important role in \"Honorary Consul\", working next to Richard Gere, Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins. But it was his third film \"Good Morning Babylon\", directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, that opened the Cannes Film Festival in 1987, that propelled him to an international career. Being fluent in six languages has helped him to work everywhere in the world. He hasn't stopped since then. He has been in more then 90 films and Television shows acting with actors and directors like Harrison Ford, Gene Hackman, Kim Basinger, Antonio Banderas, Robert Rodriguez, Steven Soderberg, Benicio del Toro and Kiefer Sutherland among others.

He wrote and directed many acclaimed stage plays and led numerous international theatrical productions.\n\nHe was born Peter Alexander Freiherr von Ustinow on April 16, 1921 in Swiss Cottage, London, the son of Nadezhda Leontievna (née Benois) and Jona Freiherr von Ustinow. His father was of one-quarter Polish Jewish, one-half Russian, one-eighth Ethiopian, and one-eighth German descent, while his mother was of one-half Russian, one-quarter Italian, one-eighth French, and one-eighth German ancestry. Ustinov had ancestral connections to Russian nobility as well as to the Ethiopian Royal Family. His father, also known as \"Klop Ustinov\", was a pilot in the German Air Force during World War I. In 1919, Jona Freiherr von Ustinow joined his own mother and sister in St Petersburg, Russia, where he met his future wife, artist Nadia Benois, who worked for the Imperial Mariinsky Ballet and Opera House in St Petersburg.\n\nIn 1920, in a modest and discreet ceremony at a Russian-German church in St Petersburg, Ustinov's father married Nadia. In February 1921, when she was seven months pregnant with Peter, the couple emigrated from Russia in the aftermath of the Communist Revolution. Young Peter was brought up in a multilingual family. He was fluent in Russian, French, Italian and German, as well as English. He attended Westminster College (1934-37), took the drama and acting class under Michel St Denis at the London Theatre Studio (1937-39), and made his stage debut in 1938 at the Stage Theatre Club in Surrey. He wrote his first play at the age of 19. In 1939, he made his London stage debut in a revue sketch, then had regular performances with the Aylesbury Repertory Company. The following year, he made his film debut in Hullo, Fame! (1940).\n\nFrom 1942-46, Ustinov served with the British Army's Royal Sussex Regiment. He was batman for David Niven, and the two became lifelong friends. Ustinov spent most of his service working with the Army Cinema Unit, where he was involved in making recruitment films, wrote plays and appeared in three films as an actor. At that time he co-wrote and acted in The Way Ahead (1944) (aka \"The Immortal Battalion\").\n\nUstinov had a stellar film career as actor, director, and writer. Among his numerous screen acting gems were his unparalleled, Academy Award-nominated interpretation of Nero in Quo vadis? (1951) and roles in Max Ophüls's masterpiece Lola Montez (1955), Barefoot in Athens (1966), Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967), Robin Hood (1973) and Flucht ins 23. Jahrhundert (1976). He also wrote and directed such brilliant films as Die Verdammten der Meere (1962), Lady L (1965) and Memed, mein Falke (1984). He was awarded two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor, one for his role in Spartacus (1960) and one for his role in Topkapi (1964), and received two more Oscar nominations as an actor and writer. His career slowed down a bit in the 1970s, but made a comeback as Hercule Poirot in Tod auf dem Nil (1978) by director John Guillermin. In the 1980s, Ustinov recreated Poirot in several subsequent television movies and theatrical films, including Das Böse unter der Sonne (1982) and Rendezvous mit einer Leiche (1988), while his cinema work in the 1990s also includes his superb performance as Professor Gus Nikolais in George Miller's excellent dramatic film, Lorenzos Öl (1992), a character partially inspired by Hugo Wolfgang Moser, a research scientist who had been director of the Neurogenetics Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nHis expertise in dialectic and physical comedy made him a regular guest of talk show hosts and late-night comedians. His witty and multidimensional humor was legendary, and he later published a collection of his jokes and quotations summarizing his wide popularity as a raconteur. He was also an internationally acclaimed TV journalist. Ustinov covered over 100,000 miles and visited more than 30 Russian cities during the making of his well-received BBC television series Russia (1986).\n\nIn his autobiographies, \"Dear Me\" (1977) and \"My Russia\" (1996), Ustinov revealed his observations on his life, career, and his multicultural and multi-ethnic background. He wrote and directed numerous stage plays, successfully presenting them in several countries. His drama, \"Photo Finish\", was staged in New York, London and St. Petersburg, Russia, where Ustinov directed the acclaimed production, starring Elena Solovey and Petr Shelokhonov. Ustinov also served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF and a president of WFM, a global citizens movement. Ustinov served as Rector of Dundee University for six years. He was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal from the Royal Society of Arts in 1957 and was knighted in 1990.\n\nFrom 1971 until his death in 2004, Ustinov's permanent residence was a château in Bursins, Vaud, Switzerland. He died of heart failure on March 28, 2004, in a clinic in Genolier, also in Vaud. His funeral service was held at Geneva's historic Cathedral of St. Pierre, and he was laid to rest in the village cemetery of Bursins. He was survived by three daughters (Tamara, Pavla, and Andrea) and one son (Igor). His epitaph may be gleaned from his comment, \"I am an international citizen conceived in Russia, born in England, working in Hollywood, living in Switzerland, and touring the World\".\n\nThis gorgeous Teutonic temptress was one of Hollywood's most captivating imports of the 1960s. Blonde and beautiful, Berlin-born Elke Sommer, with her trademark pouty lips, high cheekbones and sky-high bouffant hairdos, proved irresistible to American audiences, whether adorned in lace or leather, or donning lingerie or lederhosen.\n\nShe was born to a Lutheran minister and his wife as Elke Schletz in Berlin-Spandau on November 5, 1940. The family was forced to evacuate to Erlangen, during World War II in 1942, a small university town in the southern region of Germany. It was here that her parents first introduced her to water colors and her lifelong passion for painting was ignited. Her father's death in 1955, when she was only 14, interrupted her education and she relocated to Great Britain, where she learned English and made ends meet as an au pair. She eventually attended college back in Germany and entertained plans to become a diplomatic translator but, instead, decided to try modeling.\n\nAfter winning a beauty title (\"Miss Viareggio Turistica\") while on vacation in Italy, she caught the attention of renowned film actor/director Vittorio De Sica and began performing on screen. Her debut film was in the Italian feature, Uomini e nobiluomini (1959), which starred DeSica and was directed by Giorgio Bianchi. Following a few more Italian pictures, which included her first starring role in Luxusweibchen (1960), also directed by Bianchi, Elke began making a name for herself in German films, as well, and gradually upgraded her status to European sex symbol. A pin-up favorite, she appeared fetchingly in both dramas and comedies, with such continental features as Zarte Haut in schwarzer Seide (1961), Sie nennen es Liebe (1962) and her first English-speaking picture, Herein ohne anzuklopfen (1961), to her credit.\n\nHollywood naturally became intrigued and she moved there in the early 1960s to try and tap into the American market. Her sexy innocence made a vivid impression in the all-star, war-themed drama, Die Sieger (1963), the Hitchcock-like thriller, Kein Lorbeer für den Mörder (1963), for which she won a \"Best Newcomer\" Golden Globe Award, and, especially, Ein Schuß im Dunkeln (1964), the classic bumbling comedy where she proved a shady and sexy foil to Peter Sellers' Inspector Clousseau. She grew in celebrity, which was certainly helped after showing off her physical assets, posing for spreads in Playboy Magazine. In the meantime, she was appearing opposite the hunkiest of Hollywood actors including Paul Newman, James Garner, Glenn Ford and Stephen Boyd.\n\nAlways a diverting attraction in spy intrigue or breezy comedy, she was too often misused and setbacks began to occur when the quality of her films began to deteriorate. The tacky Hollywood entry, ...denn keiner ist ohne Schuld (1966), the Bob Hope misfire, Völlig falsch verbunden! (1966), the tired Dean Martin \"Matt Helm\" spy spoof, Rollkommando (1968), and her title role in the tasteless Cold War comedy, The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968), starring Ein Käfig voller Helden (1965) alumnus, Bob Crane, Werner Klemperer and Leon Askin, proved her undoing.\n\nThe multilingual actress, whose career took her to scores of different countries over time and benefited from speaking seven languages fluently, resorted to a number of low-budget features in Europe, including two Italian horror movies directed by Mario Bava that have now gone on to become cult classics: Baron Blood (1972) and Der Exorzist (1973) rip-off, Lisa und der Teufel (1973). The latter movie actually was a guilty pleasure. \"Lisa\" was re-released in 1975 as \"The House of Exorcism\" and added more footage of a demonic Elke, Linda Blair style, spewing frogs, insects, green pea soup and a slew of cuss words! In England, she good-naturedly appeared in the \"comedy\" films, Percy - Der Spatz in der Hand (1971), and its equally cheeky sequel, Percy - Der Potenzprotz (1974), which starred Hywel Bennett (later Leigh Lawson) as the first man to have a penis transplant(!). She also showed up in one of the later \"Carry On\" farces, entitled Der total verrückte Mumienschreck (1975).\n\nElke fared better on television, where she appeared in the television pilot, Probe (1972), opposite Hugh O'Brian, as well as the well-made 1980s miniseries, Inside the Third Reich (1982), Jenny's War (1985), Anastasia (1986) and Peter der Große (1986). In addition, she made a few TV guest appearances on such popular shows as \"Fantasy Island,\" \"The Love Boat\" and \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nA delightful personality on the talk show circuit, the lovely Elke also made appearances as a cabaret singer and, in time, put out several albums. She found a creative outlet on stage too with such vehicles as \"Irma la Douce\", \"Born Yesterday\", \"Cactus Flower\", \"Woman of the Year\" and \"Same Time, Next Year\".\n\nDividing her time between here and in Germany in later years, she added her usual charm to films both here (Verheiratet mit einem Star (1984), The Thing - Gene außer Kontrolle (1992)), and in Germany (Himmelsheim (1988), Flashback - Mörderische Ferien (2000), Das Leben ist zu lang (2010)).\n\nThe veteran actress has since focused more time on book writing and painting than she has on acting. Holding her first one-woman art show at the McKenzie Galleries in Beverly Hills in 1965, her artwork bears an exceptionally strong influence to Marc Chagall and she, at one point, hosted a mid-1980s PBS series (\"Painting with Elke\"), that centered on her artwork, which has now exhibited and sold for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, on occasion, she tackles an acting role, often in her native Germany. Divorced from writer and journalist Joe Hyams, whom she met when he interviewed her for a Hollywood article (he recently died in November 2008), she has been married since 1993 to hotelier Wolf Walther.\n\nKnown outside her native country as the \"Spanish enchantress,\" Penélope Cruz Sánchez was born in Madrid to Eduardo Cruz, a retailer, and Encarna Sánchez, a hairdresser. As a toddler, she was already a compulsive performer, re-enacting TV commercials for her family's amusement, but she decided to focus her energies on dance. After studying classical ballet for nine years at Spain's National Conservatory, she continued her training under a series of prominent dancers. At 15, however, she heeded her true calling when she bested more than 300 other girls at a talent agency audition. The resulting contract landed her several roles in Spanish TV shows and music videos, which in turn paved the way for a career on the big screen. Cruz made her movie debut in El laberinto griego (1993) (The Greek Labyrinth), then appeared briefly in the Timothy Dalton thriller Eiskaltes Duell (1992). Her third film was the Oscar-winning Belle Époque - Saison der Liebe (1992), in which she played one of four sisters vying for the love of a handsome army deserter. The film also garnered several Goyas, the Spanish equivalent of the Academy Awards. Her resume continued to grow by three or four films each year, and soon Cruz was a leading lady of Spanish cinema. Live Flesh - Mit Haut und Haar (1997) (Live Flesh) offered her the chance to work with renowned Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar (who would later be her ticket to international fame), and the same year she was the lead actress in the thriller/drama/mystery/sci-fi film Virtual Nightmare - Open Your Eyes (1997), a huge hit in Spain that earned eight Goyas (though none for Cruz). Her luck finally changed in 1998, when the movie-industry comedy Das Mädchen deiner Träume (1998) won her a Best Actress Goya. Cruz made a few more forays into English-language film, but her first big international hit was Almodóvar's Alles über meine Mutter (1999), in which she played an unchaste but well-meaning nun. As the film was showered with awards and accolades, Cruz suddenly found herself in demand on both sides of the Atlantic. Her next big project was Woman on Top (2000), an American comedy about a chef with bewitching culinary skills and a severe case of motion sickness. While in the US, she also signed up to star opposite Johnny Depp in the drug-trafficking drama Blow (2001) and opposite Matt Damon in Billy Bob Thornton's All die schönen Pferde - All the Pretty Horses (2000). Cruz says she's wary of being typecast as a beautiful young damsel, but it's hard to imagine disguising her wide-eyed charms and generous nature. Fortunately, with Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky (2001) (a remake of Virtual Nightmare - Open Your Eyes (1997)) and a John Madden collaboration looming in her future, Damsel Penelope isn't likely to disappear just yet.\n\nThe 1/2 Taiwanese and 1/2 Japanese Takeshi Kaneshiro may have started out as a puerile teen idol in the Chinese entertainment scene, but he's since become a proper film star in his own right. Whether by his own design or not, the boyishness that marked his first steps into showbiz has evolved into a cool, somewhat reticent demeanor that has now become his trademark. Despite being effortlessly good-looking, he chooses to strike a sometimes uneasy balance between the commercially pleasing and the quirky in his choice of film roles -- a move that's unusual for Asian leading men. But whether he's the faithful lover in the Japanese AIDS drama Kamisama mousukoshi dake (1998), the canned-pineapple-eating cop in Chungking Express (1994) or awkward in his role in Misty (1996), a remake of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon - Das Lustwäldchen (1950), Asian audiences love his style. Other memorable roles include his turn as a lovelorn student in Sam dung (1999), an angel in Fan yi cho (2000) and the leader of a trio of robbers in Supêsutoraberâzu (2000). There hasn't been an Asian actor quite as versatile as Kaneshiro, who is able to straddle the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japanese film industries because of his proficiency in various languages. Still, one wonders if the reason why he's so sought after is because he is so elusive. No one really knows what he does outside of film commitments, and his reluctance towards being in the spotlight is legendary.\n\nAsin was born in Cochin, Kerala, India in the Malayalam-speaking Thottumkal family which consists of her businessman dad, Joseph, and mom, Dr. Seline, who practices in Ernakulam. She attended Naval Public School in Cochin, and after obtaining her Matriculation, was enrolled in St. Theresa's Higher Secondary School. After successfully obtaining her Higher Secondary School Certificate, she enrolled in St. Theresa's College to continue studying in the Arts Faculty. After obtaining a Degree in B.A. English Literature, she assisted her dad in his business (which includes software, export of furniture and antiques) and also took up modeling on the side. Her modeling assignments included Colgate Toothpaste, and Fairever Cream.\n\nThis exposure got her noticed and she made her debut on the tinsel screen through director Sathyan Anthikad's \"Narendaran Makan\" with Malayalyee actor Kunjachacko Boban.\n\nAfter her initial success, she was offered Telugu movies, and warmly welcomed in the Telugu film industry. It was a smooth transition from Telugu to Tamil with the film \"M Kumaran s/o Mahalakshmi\". Asin starred in the original Telugu version, so she was the obvious choice for the Tamil remake, opposite Jeyam Ravi. The movie was a super hit. What makes Asin hot in the Tamil film industry, apart from her looks, is that she has teamed up with all the top heroes -- Vijay, Ajith, Surya and now Vikram, in \"Maja\".\n\nShe speaks a wide range of languages such as Malyalam, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit, English, French, and may well be the only Indian actress with a Blogspot in French. She is very active in various functions throughout Southern India, and credits her good upbringing to her parents, who she considers her role models. She was the winner of an entrepreneurial award as a teenager. She is fond of reading and has a huge collection of books.\n\nAsin, along with her mom and dad, have left their Harrington Road apartment at Chetpet, Chennai, and have re-located to an apartment in Lokhandwala Complex, in Andheri (West), Mumbai, in order to enable her to debut in Bollywood movies.\n\nShe has had a taste of success at a very young age in Indian regional movies, it remains to be seen if her success will continue in Bollywood also."
