He defended his dissertation for the degree of Dr. Oecon on june 15th 2006. The dissertation is on Telecommunications Economics. The research is focused on economic mechanisms at work when networks are being interconnected. Internet peering, mobile roaming and termination of telephony are being studied. The research results are of relevance both in a business strategy and a in regulatory context.\n\nRecent Work\n\nNetwork competition: Empirical evidence on mobile termination rates and profitability  April 2009 version, Joint work with Kjetil Andersson.\n\nWe analyze a model of multi firm competition between mobile network operators. The model assumes inelastic usage demand and full penetration, and allows for asymmetric termination rates, differences in marginal costs and vertical differentiation. A key property is that operators equilibrium profit is unaffected by an identical change in all termination rates in the market - we call this the profit neutrality hypothesis. The model is well suited for econometric implementation. We use a panel data set comprising north western European mobile operators to estimate equilibrium profit functions and find that we cannot reject the profit neutrality hypothesis. The results suggest that a reduction in mobile termination rate levels in mature markets will not necessarily benefit consumers.\n\nFacility based competition in telecommunications - Three essays on two-way access and one essay on three-way access\n\nBI Series of Dissertation, 05 / 2006\n\nAbstract\n\nIn order to reap all benefits from telecommunications, competing firms typically have to cooperate in order to exploit economies of scale and scope. Thus, firms being active in the same market are supposed to compete in some dimensions and cooperate in other dimensions. There is potentially a trade-off between cooperation and competition. In this dissertation four cases of interplay between competition and cooperation are investigated and we find that in some cases there is indeed a treade-off. In some cases (but not all cases) firms can arrange their cooperation such that they are able to soften competition and increase prices. Whether such effects are present or not depends on technology and market characteristics. It is accordingly necessary to carry out case by case analysis in order to assess the interplay between cooperation and competition. A common feature of the four papers in the dissertation is that they take as a starting point a concrete and policy relevant issue where telecomunications firms have to cooperate. Game theoretic models are adapted to each case and particular care is taken in capturing relevant market and technology features.\n\nNetwork Competition when Costs are Heterogeneous\n\n(updatet april 2006)\n\nIn this paper we study network competition when costs differ among interconnected networks. Such cost differences are observed in the mobile sector as well as in fixed networks. In the paper we find that cost based regulation will not result in first best market shares. The low cost firm will be too small in equilibrium. This is partly due to tariff mediated network externalities. This result is in contrast to the standard result in the literature on network competition where one assumes symmetric cost structure. In the present paper, the regulator can induce a first best market equilibrium by combining cost based regulation of termination rates with a tax based on the number of subscribers. If such a tax is not an available instrument, the regulator can improve welfare by granting a termination margin to the low cost firm as compared to cost based regulation.\n\nTermination Rates and Fixed Mobile Substitution\n\n(updatet april 2006)\n\nIn this paper we consider fixed mobile substitution in a model of mobile network competition. We demonstrate that the profit neutrality result from the standard model of network competition (Laffont Rey Tirole1998a) holds if the number of mobile subscribers is given. Thus the mobile termination rate does not have an impact on profits in the mobile sector in a mature market where all consumers are hooked up to a mobile network and fixed mobile substitution results in subscribers disconnecting from the fixed network. However, if fixed mobile substitution results in an increased number of subscribers in mobile networks, then the mobile termination rate will have an impact on profits in the mobile sector. The implication of the analysis is that there is a case for regulating mobile termination rates in the growth phase, whereas there is less need for regulation in mature markets characterized by a stable size of the mobile sector. This seems to be the opposite of the approach taken by regulators in Europe, where mobile firms were free to set termination rates in the growth phase and regulation of termination rates is introduced once markets mature.\n\nResearch\n\nMy current research interests are as follows: Industrial Organization.
