        "text": "Atmospheric aerosols are suspensions of liquid, solid, or mixed particles with highly variable chemical composition and size distribution (Putaud et al. 2010). Their variability is due to the numerous sources and varying formation mechanisms (Figure 1). Aerosol particles are either emitted directly to the atmosphere (primary aerosols) or produced in the atmosphere from precursor gases (secondary aerosols).\n\nPrimary aerosols consist of both inorganic and organic components. Inorganic primary aerosols are relatively large (often larger than 1 μm) and originate from sea spray, mineral dust, and volcanoes. These coarse aerosols have short atmospheric lifetimes, typically only a few days. Combustion processes, biomass burning, and plant/microbial materials are sources of carbonaceous aerosols, including both organic carbon (OC) and solid black carbon (BC). BC is the main anthropogenic light-absorbing constituent present in aerosols. Its main sources are the combustion of fossil fuels (such as gasoline, oil, and coal), wood, and other biomass. Primary BC and OC containing aerosols are generally smaller than 1 µm.\n\nSecondary aerosol particles are produced in the atmosphere from precursor gases by condensation of vapours on pre-existing particles or by nucleation of new particles. A considerable fraction of the mass of secondary aerosols is formed through cloud processing (Ervens et al. 2011). Secondary aerosols are small; they range in size from a few nanometres up to 1 µm and have lifetimes of days to weeks. Secondary aerosols consist of mixtures of compounds; the main components are sulphate, nitrate, and OC. The main precursor gases are emitted from fossil fuel combustion, but fires and biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are also important. Occasionally volcanic eruptions result in huge amounts of primary and secondary aerosols both at the ground and in the stratosphere (Boulon et al. 2011).\n\nThe size and chemical composition of the particles evolve with time through coagulation, condensation, and chemical reactions. Particles may grow by uptake of water, a process that depends on chemical composition, particle size, and ambient relative humidity. The different particles have varying impacts in the atmosphere depending on composition, and the numerous sources and large range in size distributions further complicate a quantification of their effects. Both particle growth and the mixing of different particle types influence the climate effect of aerosols.\n\nAll atmospheric aerosols scatter incoming solar radiation, and a few aerosol types can also absorb solar radiation. BC is the most important of the latter, but mineral dust and some OC components are also sunlight absorbers. Aerosols that mainly scatter solar radiation have a cooling effect, by enhancing the total reflected solar radiation from the Earth. Strongly absorbing aerosols have a warming effect. In the atmosphere, there is a mixture of scattering and absorbing aerosols, and their net effect on Earth's energy budget is dependent on surface and cloud characteristics. Scattering aerosols above a dark surface and absorbing aerosols above a bright surface are most efficient (see Figure 3a). Scattering (absorbing) aerosol above a bright (dark) surface are less efficient because the solar radiation is reflected (absorbed) anyway. Absorbing aerosols are particularly efficient when positioned above clouds, which are a main contributor to the total reflection of solar radiation back to space.\n\nAerosols are vital for cloud formation because a subset of them may serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). An increased amount of aerosols may increase the CCN number concentration and lead to more, but smaller, cloud droplets for fixed liquid water content. This increases the albedo of the cloud, resulting in enhanced reflection and a cooling effect, termed the cloud albedo effect (Twomey 1977; Figure 3b). Smaller drops require longer growth times to reach sizes at which they easily fall as precipitation. This effect, called the cloud lifetime effect, may enhance the cloud cover (see illustration in Figure 3b) and thus impose an additional cooling effect (Albrecht 1989). However, the life cycles of clouds are controlled by an intimate interplay between meteorology and aerosol-and-cloud microphysics, including complex feedback processes, and it has proven difficult to identify the traditional lifetime effect put forth by Albrecht (1989) in observational data sets.\n\nAbsorbing aerosols also have the potential to modify clouds properties, without directly acting as CCN and IN, by: (1) heating the air surrounding them while reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, which stabilizes the atmosphere and diminishes the convection and thus the potential for cloud formation, (2) increasing the atmospheric temperature, which reduces the relative humidity, inhibits cloud formation, and enhances evaporation of existing clouds. This is collectively termed the semi-direct aerosol effect (Hansen et al. 1997). The net effect is uncertain (see Figure 3b) and highly depends on the vertical profile of BC (Koch & Del Genio 2010).\n\nIn addition, BC and other absorbing aerosols deposited on snow or ice surfaces may reduce the surface albedo, leading to reduced reflectance of solar radiation, and hence a heating effect (Hansen & Nazarenko 2004).\n\nRadiative forcing (RF) is often used to quantify and compare the potential climate impact of the various aerosol effects. RF is defined as a change in the Earth's radiation balance due to a perturbation of anthropogenic or natural origin.. The total aerosol forcing probability density function (PDF), in addition to individual aerosol components, indicating both the magnitudes and uncertainty of the effects, is shown in Figure 4a. The wider a PDF, the larger is the uncertainty. Combining all aerosol effects (blue dashed curve in Figure 4a) enhances the uncertainty compared to considering only the direct aerosol effect and cloud albedo effect."
