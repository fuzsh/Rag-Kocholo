        "text": "One gray morning in Oslo, a class at Fagerborg High School is making its usual hash of Ibsen’s play “The Wild Duck.” The atmosphere is a Monday mixture of lassitude, cockiness, and routine. Elias Rukla has been teaching this play, in this school, for twenty-five years. Dignified, resigned, he subsists on the medicine of his own cynicism: he tells himself that it is not his job to excite the kids, merely to lay the foundations of their cultural heritage. He thinks of himself as a cog in the Norwegian pedagogical machine, an “officially appointed educator.”\n\nBut as he reads a scene to the class Elias Rukla is snagged, perhaps for the first time in a quarter century, by a detail. It is a moment in Act IV, when Mrs. Sørbye announces that she is going to marry the merchant Werle. Dr. Relling, a minor character who overhears her, responds, “This can’t possibly be true?” Elias now notices Ibsen’s parenthetical stage direction—that Dr. Relling should ask the question “with a slight tremor in his voice.” All at once, Elias feels “an unendurable excitement,” because he senses that he is “on the track of something to which he had not previously paid any attention when trying to understand The Wild Duck.” Relling is known for his role as someone who comments sarcastically from the sidelines of the play, rather as a jaundiced teacher might do. One of his pronouncements is celebrated in Norwegian literature: “If you take the life-lie away from an average person, you take away his happiness as well.” Elias had never been very interested in Relling, and yet he realizes, on this Monday morning, that Relling’s “slight tremor” is the key to a new opening. For a second, Elias thinks, Relling becomes a major character, and we see him “caught in his own bitter fate as a perpetual, unsuccessful admirer of Mrs. Sørbye, throughout her two marriages, first to Dr. Sørbye, now to Werle, and for a brief moment it is his fate, and nothing else, that is frozen into immobility on the stage. The moment of the minor figure.”\n\nThe teen-agers do not share their teacher’s excitement, and quickly file out when the lesson is over. It’s starting to rain. Elias stands in the schoolyard, trying to open a recalcitrant umbrella. Suddenly, the morning of anger and disappointment and the years of frustration and impotence come to a flash point. The senior schoolmaster now makes a fool of himself, savagely smashing his umbrella against the school’s fountain, cutting his hand, as the students look on. Worse, he takes the umbrella, holds it like a sword, and lunges toward some of those students, who move, pityingly, out of the way. As he marches from the yard and starts toward the center of Oslo, he realizes he can never return. His career is over.\n\nWe are thirty-eight pages into “Shyness and Dignity” (1996), by Norway’s most distinguished contemporary novelist, Dag Solstad. A conventional novel might follow Elias home, depicting the expected domestic consequences: Elias telling his wife, quarrelling with his children, seeking a colleague’s advice; Elias’s isolation and perhaps his ultimate renewal. These orderly, dramatic scenes would come appointed with the usual novelistic conveniences—dialogue, authorial stage directions (“with a slight tremor in his voice”), rising and falling action. Because it’s a novel by Dag Solstad, none of these conventionalities are entered into. Elias walks along the street and stops at a traffic circle, in sight of the Bislett sports stadium. The rest of this short novel—a hundred or so pages more—takes place at the traffic circle, as we circle around the interior of Elias’s mind. He thinks of his wife, Eva Linde, and how she’ll receive the calamitous news. What will they live on? He remembers meeting Eva for the first time, toward the end of the nineteen-sixties, when she was dating his best friend, Johan Corneliussen. The rest of the novel unspools as a single anguished remembrance, an internal monologue assisted by Solstad’s characteristically lengthy sentences, and paragraphs that go unbroken for many pages.\n\nWhen Elias met Johan Corneliussen, they were students. Johan was marked out as a mind to watch, the one whose Ph.D. on Kant would be a major event, and who was sure to establish himself as a great philosopher. Elias was full of admiration: for Johan’s intellect, his life force, his glamorous success with women, the breadth of his interests. (“Johan Corneliussen moved without difficulty from ice hockey to Kant, from interest in advertising posters to the Frankfurt school of philosophy, from rock’n’roll to classical music.”) Modest Elias was full of gratitude that Johan had plucked him for friendship, and the asymmetry persisted when Johan introduced his girlfriend, Eva Linde. Elias was so dazzled by Eva’s beauty that he had to look away. Eva and Johan married in 1970, had a daughter later the same year; Elias remained the stunned, appreciative spectator—the lesser one, the comfy friend whose task was to reflect and accompany, the mirror to the lamp.\n\nStanding by the traffic circle, Elias casts his mind over this strange love triangle and its unforeseen contortions. Johan did not become a great philosopher but quit academic life and quit his family, moving to the United States and leaving his wife and daughter behind. Within two years, Elias had married the abandoned Eva, overwhelmed that she would accept him. The French theorist René Girard would call this “mimetic desire,” but Elias doesn’t need Girard’s help: he is all too humbly conscious that, by a twist of luck, he has stolen into his best friend’s life “as the shadow of Johan Corneliussen that I am.” And he transfers to Eva the humble admiration that he once had for Johan. He is the rapt voyeur of her beauty. She remains oddly unapproachable. When they make love, she half turns her face from him. He surmises that she must love him, but she never says so. They are now two middle-aged people who are not intimate with each other. On this important day, as he gathers his spousal courage, he is “struck by a dreadful sense of estrangement.”\n\nMy outline is just the perimeter of this novel’s rich acreage. There is much comedy and real subtlety, both intellectual and human, in Solstad’s internal explorations. At no point does he make explicit the link between Elias’s charged discovery in Ibsen’s play and his subsequent reflection on the kind of life he has lived. The connection is for us to make, which means that we resemble Elias’s students: we must choose to notice the dramaturgy, the “slight tremor” that links Relling and Elias, and so choose to consider, with new empathy, “the moment of the minor figure.” For twenty-five years, Elias has overlooked Relling, because he has overlooked himself. The slight tremor in Relling’s voice alerts him to a human connection that is, in some sense, outside the language of literary criticism, or at least outside the protocols of pedagogy. It is unspeakable, as a tremor is barely detectable. But today Elias detects it, and Relling’s unimportant anguish prompts Elias to think about his own—as a loyal satellite of his best friend and then of his friend’s wife.\n\nOr so we infer. But perhaps Elias’s apprehension is unconscious? Solstad’s refusal to spell out the explicit connection holds open the possibility that, even now, Elias may have failed to make the connection that is so obvious to the reader. The tremor can be detected but not quite measured.\n\n“Shyness and Dignity” is a deeply humane book, committed to a single character’s interiority, but Dag Solstad’s gaze is not merely domestic. He is as politically searching as he is humanly subtle, always attentive to a character’s civic plight. Elias is not only a disappointed husband; he is a disappointed Norwegian citizen, a bureaucrat in a prosperous European country who has been let down by contemporary society. The last third or so of “Shyness and Dignity” is a wonderful aria in which Elias—still standing at the Bislett traffic circle—voices a long internal complaint about his cultural and political isolation. Something has been happening to him, which he can only think of as “a slowly growing sense of having been put out of the running.” The newspapers and TV news programs are no longer addressed to him; the shapers of public opinion look past people like him. He is increasingly revolted by what he thinks of as the democratization of culture, but he refuses to think of himself as undemocratic. He hungers in vain for “a running conversation” about books, religion, ideas, politics. In the teachers’ lounge at school, his colleagues seem to be afraid of serious engagement, and instead talk about mortgages, debt, and the latest superficial cultural news:\n\nOh, how Elias Rukla would at times pine for someone to talk to. Oh, how he longed for someone to break out of this and say something, if nothing else than a reference to the fact that life has other things to offer. He was really looking for someone to allude to that, if only in a kind of code—yes, if only someone or other, during one of those quick exchanges in the teachers’ lounge, would suddenly point his index finger at the heavens and in that way signal that there existed a long religious tradition, based on Christianity, in our part of the world, and that consequently one often pointed straight up like that, toward the heavens . . . then Elias Rukla would have thrown his arms around his neck, regardless of how ironic such an index finger would have appeared, both to the one who performed this act and to the others. For Elias Rukla, it would have been a sign, replete with seriousness, even if just then it had been dressed up in the conventional language of irony.\n\nThe novel’s magnificent closing spasm, constructed out of a single paragraph that throws itself across eighteen pages (the supple, “running” English in this translation, from 2006, is by Sverre Lyngstad), mimics the very “running conversation” that Elias feels exiled from: in the end, Elias can conduct a running conversation only with himself.\n\nThe Norwegian literary critic Ane Farsethås, who interviewed Solstad for The Paris Review in 2016, likens his long career to Philip Roth’s. Solstad, who has just turned seventy-seven, has been as prolific and as various as Roth. Like Roth, though less raucously, he is an ironist, a comedian, and an experimenter. There have been about thirty books, starting with his first novel, in 1969, “Irr! Grønt!” (roughly translated as “Corroded! Green!”). Like Roth, Solstad has continually broken the available forms, trying out and combining new approaches—conventional and postmodernist, realist and formalist. He co-wrote five books about soccer, one after each World Cup tournament between 1982 and 1998. He apparently prefers matches that “end in goalless draws,” a detail that perhaps points less toward a stereotypical Nordic gloominess than toward his committed, ironic playfulness, which can be sensed in the comic brinkmanship of his novels’ titles: “High School Teacher Pedersen’s Account of the Great Political Awakening That Has Swept Our Nation” (1982); “Novel 1987” (1987); “The Insoluble Epic Element in Telemark in the Years 1591-1896” (published in 2013, it’s the novel with which Lydia Davis taught herself to read Norwegian).\n\nI’ve become accustomed to hearing Norwegian writers and editors express dismay at the small amount of Solstad in English. Until this year, you could find only three of his novels, published by Graywolf and Harvill Secker: “Shyness and Dignity,” “Novel 11, Book 18” (translated by Sverre Lyngstad, in 2008), and “Professor Andersen’s Night” (translated by Agnes Scott Langeland, in 2011). They have now been joined by two more novels: “T. Singer” (originally published in Norwegian in 1999, and translated by Tiina Nunnally) and “Armand V.” (originally published in Norwegian in 2006, and translated by Steven T. Murray), both from New Directions.\n\nAttempting an account of Solstad’s bounty from this piecemeal evidence feels a bit like launching a description of a city from a locked hotel room. But “T. Singer” and “Armand V.” certainly develop emphases evident in “Shyness and Dignity” and “Novel 11, Book 18.” You could hang the motto “The moment of the minor figure,” like a lackey’s badge, around the necks of the protagonists of all these books. Bjørn Hansen, in “Novel 11,” lives a quiet life in the provinces, where he is troubled by the lustreless, arbitrary nature of his existence. He complains to his doctor that “existence has never answered my questions.” He’s furious that he has reached middle age, and “this was it.” T. Singer (we never learn his first name) has moved to the small town of Notodden, to work as a librarian and “to live incognito.” People like him, Solstad writes, spend their whole lives trying to avoid embarrassing situations, trying not to stand out. Though he falls in love with a woman in Notodden, and becomes the stepfather of her daughter, he lives as if these events had happened to someone else, as if he were an indifferent witness to his own existence. “The days passed, one after the other, and were gone without him really missing them,” Solstad writes toward the end of the book, “but now and then he would be taken aback and think: where did they go? He didn’t know whether he was happy or unhappy, but I can’t be unhappy, he thought, it would be meaningless to make such a claim.”\n\nAll these novels are engaged by a paradox of decentering: the characters drift at the periphery of their own lives, yet here they are at the unhappy centers of Solstad’s stories. Into the opening made by this paradox, Solstad inserts his playful irony, which often announces itself as an unexpected detachment. These are novels at once intense and restrained. Solstad writes up the lives of his heroes as if he were producing finished case studies, each sealed and beyond the power of his intervention. This novel “is the only extant description of Singer’s life, and most likely also the only possible description,” he writes in “T. Singer.” “It may seem mysterious that Singer can be the main character in any novel at all,” but “it’s precisely this mysteriousness that is the topic of the novel.”\n\nElias, in “Shyness and Dignity,” loves Thomas Mann’s fiction, in part because he has decided that Mann is the only novelist who could have written about him “without self-pity, without whining, and with a rare irony.” Mann’s irony, Elias thinks, offers a hint that the fate of someone as unimportant as he “certainly is a fate and as such must be studied, as it certainly can be.” Unimportant, yet rising to the dignity of a fate that “must be studied”—that is the shadowy destiny of Solstad’s men, the mystery that keeps the reader engrossed, even when the books risk tedium.\n\nAnd tedium, in Solstad’s work, achieves a kind of hallucinatory power. Long stretches of “T. Singer,” perhaps Solstad’s most challenging work, revolve around the “astonishingly monotonous inland route” of Singer’s train journey from Oslo to Notodden, the internal workings of the Norwegian hydroelectricity company Norsk Hydro, and how the sport of hammer throwing has become unexpectedly popular in Notodden. As ever, Solstad is at once demanding and funny. For years, Singer has been trying to write a novel, which has stalled at its opening sentence: “One fine day he stood eye to eye with a memorable sight.” He has been trying to determine what the memorable sight might be.\n\nIf I had to choose a single passage to illustrate Solstad’s droll originality, it would be the long central section of “Novel 11, Book 18.” Bjørn Hansen, who lives alone in a modest apartment and works as the town treasurer of Kongsberg, has not seen Peter, his son from a previous marriage, for six years. Peter arrives to attend a local college, where he will be studying to become an optician. He moves in with his father, which initially makes Bjørn happy. In the next few months, however, Bjørn begins to dread his son’s presence. Peter talks too loudly, and has “a rather preachy manner.” Bjørn is irritated by Peter’s “slovenly but neatly arranged young man’s clothes,” by the weirdly unironic poster (of a bright-red Ferrari) that Peter puts up on his bedroom wall. He resents that his son has started eating at home, rather than on campus, and a strange phrase begins to sound itself in his mind: “Peter eats my food, he’s very welcome.” Bjørn cannot respect his son’s decision to become an optician. Yet Peter is condescendingly sure that, unlike his middle-aged father, he has his finger on the pulse of the times, and that the key to the future will be the ability to make really fashionable spectacles. Bjørn finds this self-satisfaction repellent:\n\nHis son as an optician. As he comes up with the right pair of glasses for his client. Displaying a gloating pride as he plunges his hand straight into his own time and in an almost mysterious way pulls out a pair of glasses that is perfectly adapted to the shape of the client’s face.\n\nSolstad conveys this slow curdling of affection without a single conventional dramatic scene, and with a minimal amount of direct dialogue. The passage stretches for more than seventy pages, and is written as a third-person shadowing of Bjørn’s mind. As in Thomas Bernhard’s work, the long sentences circle repetitively and somewhat obsessively. The niggling phrase “Peter eats my food, he’s very welcome” appears three times.\n\nAnd Solstad describes this change of emotional climate without really taking sides. Both father and son are rendered with enough sympathy to engage us; but both seem narrow-minded, intolerant, and a little pathetic. Dr. Relling, Elias thinks in “Shyness and Dignity,” has a fate that is “bitter for him, on the verge of the ridiculous for the rest of us.” That might be a fair description of Bjørn Hansen, the provincial town treasurer, whose son is sure he will be able to dip his hand into his own time and fish up a pair of spectacles.\n\nTo move through Solstad’s world is to be continually shifting between boredom and involvement, imprisonment and freedom. Solstad’s ironies throw the reader off balance, adding and subtracting in turn. On the one hand, we spend an entire novel inside Elias Rukla’s head; on the other, we understand that this is merely his tiny Relling moment—that for an instant his unimportant fate, like Relling’s, has been “frozen into immobility on the stage.” Think of the titles: “Shyness and Dignity” sounds like a work of academic theory; “Novel 11, Book 18” wearily suggests nameless serialism; “T. Singer” and “Armand V.” dangle without forename or surname, as if plucked from a register of Identikits.\n\n“Armand V.” is subtitled “Footnotes to an Unexcavated Novel,” and it tells the life of its title character, a senior Norwegian diplomat, only by recourse to numbered footnotes; we aren’t privy to the main text. Armand is, by conventional standards, a man of weight and importance, who has been his country’s Ambassador to Jordan and has now crowned his career with the top job in London. But he is a hollow cynic, a man who has learned how to play the game and suppress his actual political instincts. A student of history, he is amazed that it “had proceeded as it had and not in some other way.” So things appear to go for his own life: Armand is afflicted by something akin to T. Singer’s resigned voyeurism, as if he were the indifferent student of the already completed history of his own life. Although his son is blinded while serving abroad as a soldier in support of an unspecified American-led war, Armand expresses no anger. Because Armand has no hope, no plan, no sense of destiny, Solstad writes, no novel about him could be “readable, or writable.” Instead, as burnt offerings to an omniscient God, the ultimate Author, Solstad gives us this series of footnotes, the mere hints and scrapings of a life. Elsewhere, Solstad says, somewhere “up there,” is the “invisible” or “original” novel of Armand’s life. Down here, on paper, is what we have to make do with, “the novel as it now exists,” footnotes to that original novel.\n\nSolstad’s inventive approach allows him to reflect on the freedom and obligations of the novelist who is tasked with telling someone else’s life story. It also inscribes, in the novel’s very form, Solstad’s way of writing about people who are not quite the protagonists of their own lives. Early in “Armand V.,” we get a digression of forty or fifty pages, as a long footnote fills us in on the early life of one of Armand’s university friends, a character who appears once again in the book, but only briefly. In “T. Singer,” something similar occurs when, early in the novel, T. Singer encounters Adam Eyde, a local business executive, who dominates the next forty or so pages, only to disappear from the rest of the book (“He had nothing more to do with Adam Eyde”). We think that we know, reading a novel, what a “digression” is—a swerve from the main action—because we think we know what the main action is. But what if an entire life were merely a collection of digressions, a slalom of such swerves? What if a life—even an apparently consequential one, like an ambassador’s—had no discernible narrative, no coherent main action? Actual lives look nothing much like conventional novels. That is the challenge Solstad accepts and rigorously joins.\n\nSolstad’s skepticism has an edge. As a young man, he was a leading figure in the Norwegian Workers’ Communist Party (A.K.P.), a movement dedicated to overthrowing the state, and his fiction has, in some respects, remained true to this existential radicalism. A literary child of the nineteen-sixties, he takes seriously those dilemmas posed differently by Sartre and Camus: what if the self is a kind of nothingness, always trying to become a something, and failing to do so? Isn’t life a constant drama of bad faith? Given these absurd terms, what would escape or revolt look like? Actually, if you are a Norwegian writer, you don’t need Camus or Sartre, because there is Knut Hamsun (an acknowledged influence on Solstad), who, in a book like “Hunger,” strips the self to a madly rational void. And there is Ibsen.\n\nRecall Dr. Relling’s celebrated pronouncement from “The Wild Duck”: “If you take the life-lie away from an average person, you take away his happiness as well.” The “life-lie,” in Solstad’s work, can be understood as those stories we tell ourselves in order to survive, at the cost of appraising life honestly. Solstad’s protagonists identify the life-lie in its many dimensions. Religion might be a life-lie, but so might a certain kind of politics, the art of diplomacy, a pointless job, an aimless love affair, a tediously bright dinner party. Elias Rukla’s intimate life is a lie; but so is his teaching life (the imparting of official wisdom to students who couldn’t care less); and so is his political and civic life. He longs for someone to break out and “say something,” the something that would stop the vampiric life-lie in its tracks.\n\nBewilderingly, the protagonists of Solstad’s fictions have coldly identified the life-lie but seem to have resigned themselves to yet more of it—a resignation so unillusioned that it almost resembles rebellion. Cynicism, Nietzsche said, is the only honesty available to mediocre souls, and characters like T. Singer, Armand V., and Bjørn Hansen have perfected a cynicism that rises to a form of weak protest. To move to a dull town for no reason, to take on a nondescript job like town treasurer, to have mute and indifferent relations with your son or your wife or your stepdaughter, to think with relief that you won’t have to celebrate your birthday—these are ways of dying while alive, and thus come close to a kind of living suicide, the one form of protest that Camus argues against, in “The Myth of Sisyphus.”\n\nBut one character, the protagonist of “Novel 11, Book 18,” does something more than accept his living death. It is Bjørn Hansen who tells his doctor that he is troubled by the arbitrariness of his existence: “You know, I find myself in this town by pure chance, it has never meant anything to me. . . . But if I hadn’t been here, I would have been somewhere else and have led the same kind of life.” He adds, “However, I cannot reconcile myself to that.” With this doctor, he develops a secret scheme, a trick that he thinks of as “his No, his great Negation.” He travels to Lithuania, where he pretends to have been in a traffic accident that has rendered him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He returns to his home town, and relishes his role as an actor, a man who cons everyone he meets, sitting “of his own free will” in a wheelchair.\n\nThe novel ends with an extraordinary scene, in which Bjørn, in his wheelchair, visits an old friend for dinner. He is tempted to let his friend in on the secret; he thinks he would understand. But Bjørn holds back. The unwilling public actor has just become a willing secret actor. Bjørn’s transformation is certainly a negation of sorts, but does it vanquish or even resist the terms of his existence? Does it turn anything upside down, or just leave everything as it was before? Once the slave of arbitrariness, Bjørn has emancipated himself only by a sovereign exaggeration of arbitrariness.\n\n“Novels arise out of the shortcomings of history.” That pronouncement, by the German writer Novalis, appears as an epigraph to “The Blue Flower,” Penelope Fitzgerald’s great historical novel about him. It’s a resonant assertion, and it properly flatters a certain kind of novelistic achievement: the disclosure of intimate worlds, which official history cannot reach. The novel thus presents itself as something like the private answer to history’s public questions. Yet Dag Solstad’s novels arise not only out of the shortcomings of history but out of the shortcomings of life—the heaped disappointments of existence. Whether they resist those shortcomings or ironically embody them is hard to say, and the uncertainty is a good part of Solstad’s quizzical comedy. The life-lie has a way of stubbornly hanging on. ♦"
