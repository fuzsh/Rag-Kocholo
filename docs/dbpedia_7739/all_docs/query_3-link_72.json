        "text": "I had a moment last night. A moment that has resulted from hundreds of thousands of moments. We won the ESG Project of the Year for MindSeed at the Digital Finance Function Awards from the team at GENCFO Community Our vision is for SMEs to be at the forefront of sustainable business practices, driving growth, enhancing team well-being, and protecting our environment. We aim for a future where sustainability is ingrained in every business decision, leading to enduring success and a healthier planet. To make this happen I believe it's truly only possible with a human-led, tech-enabled proposition. MindSeed is our tech enabler. I'm super proud of this award, partly because I still have to google how to do an xlookup üòÇ, but mainly because of the team of people who have contributed to this over the past four years. I want to give a specific shout-out to Atomic Innovation our tech strategy partners who have supported me since year 1 - translating my vision into something practical. No mean feat. They are an amazing innovative & resilient tech organisation (with a female co-founder ü•≥)- connect with them. Thanks to Christopher Argent for creating the opportunity. Huge congrats to my fellow nominees Dr. Michael Goerz from Siemens Energy and Sandhya Sriram from Narayana Health keep flying the flag to a brighter future üß° SMEs remember that you can have it all, you need to find the right guidance to make it happen. #femalefounders #techforgood #financeleadership\n\nSustainability Tech at Deep Tech Innovation Alley! Sustainability is strategic imperative for any forward-thinking company today. Hence, we have a power packed panel discussion as part of the Deep Tech Innovation Alley.

Our Esteemed Panelists are : Vijay Sethi: Sustainability Evangelist & Former CIO at Hero Motors Sunila Sahasrabudhe: Head of ESG at Biocon Chhaya Sehgal: CEO & Founder at The Winning Edge The panelists will share their wealth of expertise, discuss the intersection of technology and sustainability, and delve into strategies for achieving Net Zero and ESG goals. It's a unique opportunity to gain invaluable insights from leaders driving change in the sustainability tech landscape. Stay tuned for a thought-provoking discussion that will shape the future of sustainability in the tech industry. Let's chart a course towards a greener, more sustainable tomorrow! #SustainabilityTech #ESGGoals #DeepTechInnovationAlley #TechLeadership #InnovationForGood #networkscience\n\nIn designing the inaugural Systemic Investing Summit, our ambition was to create an experience that would last into the aftermath of the conference proper. That‚Äôs why we used the mental model of an ‚ÄúAction Forum‚Äù for guiding the design of the agenda, focusing on building relationships and seeding collaborations. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there wasn‚Äôt any ‚Äúreal work‚Äù done at the Summit. Activities such as listening to other people talk about their work, building new relationships, and exploring a wide array of ideas are just as critical in the process of forging collaborations as the more technical work around planning projects, forming coalitions, and soliciting commitments. But we‚Äôre cognizant that most conferences leave it up to serendipity whether or not actual collaboration between participants will happen once the closing bell at the conference has rung. This is why the TransCap Initiative is going to actively incubate, accelerate, or elevate many of the ideas that have come out of the Summit.\n\nüìäVenture capital is the best-performing asset class of the past 25 years. VC can also drive massive significant social and environmental benefits. ‚Üó The trend in Europe is promising: Climate investment in Europe has tripled to more than $20bn in 2023 over the past three years and sustained its growth in 2023, bucking the trend of overall VC investment. üíö For catalysing step-change innovations in technology that can tackle the world‚Äôs biggest challenges we need more funding from institutional investors into venture. More on how we could achieve this and the value of diversity in the 4th Flagship Report of European Women in VC: \"BEYOND RETURNS: Venture and growth investing fuel sustainability & societal change\" with Founders Forum Group Forum and Technation. Let`s shape an impact-driven and diverse European venture capital ecosystem - happy to collaborate with üöÄKinga Stanislawska, Kasia Piasecki, Selma Meryem Peters, Marcia Maciel, and all other members of European Women in VC.
