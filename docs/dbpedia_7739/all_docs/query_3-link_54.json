        "text": "If you were starting to feel exhausted by the all-pervading march of the Danish art of hygge (the business of cosiness and comfort), it would be understandable. Hygge has invaded bestseller lists, interiors stores and ceramic mugs to a most un-hyggeligt point of discomfort.\n\nFinally, there is a way out. Say farvel (farewell in Danish) to hygge – and hallo to koselig (Norwegian for hygge): Norway’s writers are here to save us.\n\nStruggling with the work of non-fiction giant Karl Ove Knausgaard has made me wary of Norwegian writers. The country is well served for crime fiction and the “Scandi crime” cult following has spawned a huge readership for writers such as Karin Fossum (the Inspector Sejer series) and Gunnar Staalesen (known for his stories about private detective Varg Veum). But it has taken a while for anything in between crime and Knausgaard to filter through in translation.\n\nIt has taken a while for anything in between crime and Knausgaard to filter through. Now finally, several key Norwegian authors have had their work translated to international acclaim\n\nKnausgaard’s style of Proustian minutiae is the definition of “Marmite” writing. He is the author of the six-volume autobiography My Struggle (described by Zadie Smith as “like crack” and by Rachel Cusk as “the most significant literary enterprise of our times”) and there was great excitement about the Norwegian cultural scene when his work first appeared in English in 2012.\n\nNow, finally, doubtless benefiting from the Knausgaard effect, several key Norwegian authors have had their work translated to international acclaim.\n\nIt was a radio interview with Agnes Ravatn, author of psychological thriller The Bird Tribunal, that converted me to the joy of Norwegian writing. She was sparky and unusual and talked about her frustration with social media and how it had prevented her from writing.\n\nThe novel, set in a remote forest, is about Allis Hagtorn, who cuts herself off from her previous life, having been publicly disgraced as a popular television presenter. Just as Allis reinvents herself in the middle of nowhere (all the while having a strange, ambiguous relationship with Sigurd Bagge, the man who hires her as a gardener), so Ravatn had to lock herself away to write the book.\n\n“I told myself I was having really bad writer’s block. But deep down I knew very well that I was just a lazy, procrastinating internet addict with no self-control.”\n\nAgnes Ravatn\n\n“I told myself I was having really bad writer’s block,” she has written, “but deep down I knew very well that I was just a lazy, procrastinating internet addict with no self-control.”\n\nShe went off-grid for three weeks and came back with a manuscript. Her non-fiction book on digital addiction, Operation Self-Discipline, has yet to be translated into English. (Hurry up, someone, please.)\n\nThe trail from Ravatn leads directly to her favourite author, Dag Solstad, dubbed Scandinavia’s answer to Philip Roth. He’s so amazing that the short-story writer Lydia Davis, winner of the 2013 Man Booker International Prize, forced herself to learn Norwegian by reading one of his books in the original. Haruki Murakami translates his work into Japanese.\n\nSolstad is the master of middle age solipsism. His best-known novel, Shyness and Dignity – about an academic who finally loses it when his students respond with apathy to an Ibsen lecture – was listed by James Wood, the New Yorker‘s famed book critic, as one of his favourite reads of all time.\n\nSilence In the Age of Noise, due out this autumn asks: “What is silence? Where can it be found? And why is it more important than ever?”\n\nAnd his most recent – Novel 11, Book 18, the tale of Bjørn Hansen, a town treasurer who turns 50 and realises his life has been a waste of time – won this year’s Nordic Prize.\n\nWhat finally boosted Norway’s fortunes, however, and operated as a rival to the hygge phenomenon, was Lars Mytting’s cult bestseller Norwegian Wood, about the art of collecting firewood.\n\nThe publisher of that book, Erling Kagge – co-founder of the Oslo publishing house Kagge Forlag – happens to be an adventurer in his spare time. The first person in history to reach the “three poles” (north, south and the summit of Everest), he once spent 50 days walking in Antarctica with nothing but a broken radio for company.\n\nIn his book, Silence In the Age of Noise, due out this autumn, he asks: “What is silence? Where can it be found? And why is it more important than ever?”\n\nIn the face of the deafening sound of hygge, this seems a very appropriate Norwegian response indeed.\n\nNorway lit: five to read\n\nEncircling by Carl Frode Tiller (translator Barbara J. Haveland)\n\n“What happens when the only memories you have are someone else’s?” Part one of a trilogy (the translation of part two came out earlier this year), Encircling is the story of David Hugsar, a man who has lost his memory. The book consists of written recollections of Hugsar’s life by his friends and family, an altruistic perspective on identity that has seen Frode Tiller awarded the enviable title “the anti-Knausgaard”.\n\nIn the Darkness by Karin Fossum (translator James Anderson)\n\nKnown as “the Norwegian queen of crime”, Fossum is best known for her 12-volume Inspector Sejer series, which became a popular TV adaptation. This one’s the first in the series, first published in Norway in 1995. Known for being more intellectual than gory, Fossum blends tension and detail brilliantly.\n\nProfessor Andersen’s Night by Dag Solstad (translator Agnes Scott Langeland)\n\nNorway’s greatest living novelist’s existential tour de force about a professor who witnesses a murder, fails to report it at the time and can’t decide what to do afterwards. Then he goes out for sushi and encounters the murderer. A hefty but entertaining dose of Solstad’s cerebral soul-searching satire.\n\nNorwegian Wood by Lars Mytting (translator Robert Ferguson)\n\nA weird and wonderful guide to chopping, stacking and drying wood in the Scandinavian way which became a surprise bestseller last year and went on to win Non-Fiction Book of the Year 2016 at the British Book Industry Awards. When Lars Mytting isn’t chopping wood, he’s writing novels: his third is published this summer, The Sixteen Trees of the Somme, about a boy growing up on a remote Norwegian farmstead with his taciturn grandfather.\n\nThe Blue Room by Hanne Orstavik (translator Deborah Dawkin)\n\nDon’t let it put you off that this is a book recommended to fans of Fifty Shades of Grey. (Who they?) Influenced by Marguerite Duras, Orstavik’s writing is more literary than erotic. This is a novel about a young woman who dreams of escaping to America with her boyfriend, only to find herself locked in her room by an authoritarian mother, with only her sexual fantasies for company. A favourite author in Norway, annoyingly this is the only one of her novels to be translated so far."
