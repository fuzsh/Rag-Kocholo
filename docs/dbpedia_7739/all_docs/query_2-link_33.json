This is one of them.\n\n(Shortcut: GoFundMe / website / Vipps at 4151 4638)\n\nIcepeople is again facing an immediate existential crisis due (of course) to hardships largely inflected by the pandemic. In short, 1) the website needs $22 U.S. (190 NOK) to stay online for another month and 2) the editor needs any and all help possible to avoid homelessness in the middle of polar winter (not that it’s legal here any other time of the year).\n\nSo if you appreciate Icepeople for its unique stories about Svalbard and/or critical news during these critical times, as well as its features about the more colorful aspects of life here (today’s feature about the upcoming Polarjazz festival is for the event that first drew our editor’s attention to Svalbard way back in 2008) please do whatever you can during what are admittedly incredibly harsh times for many.\n\nDonations can be made at:\n\n• Icepeople’s GoFundMe\n\n• Icepeople’s direct website donation link (image below)\n\n• Vipps at 4151 4638"
