        "text": "Background and purpose: In Norway, comprehensive molecular tumour profiling is implemented as part of the public healthcare system. A substantial number of tumours harbour potentially targetable molecular alterations. Therapy outcomes may improve if targeted treatments are matched with actionable genomic alterations. In the IMPRESS-Norway trial (NCT04817956), patients are treated with drugs outside the labelled indication based on their tumours molecular profile.\n\nPatients and methods: IMPRESS-Norway is a national, prospective, non-randomised, precision cancer medicine trial, offering treatment to patients with advanced-stage disease, progressing on standard treatment. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing, TruSight Oncology 500, is used for screening. Patients with tumours harbouring molecular alterations with matched targeted therapies available in IMPRESS-Norway, are offered treatment. Currently, 24 drugs are available in the study. Primary study endpoints are percentage of patients offered treatment in the trial, and disease control rate (DCR) defined as complete or partial response or stable disease in evaluable patients at 16 weeks (W16) of treatment. Secondary endpoint presented is DCR in all treated patients.\n\nResults: Between April 2021 and October 2023, 1,167 patients were screened, and an actionable mutation with matching drug was identified for 358 patients. By the data cut off 186 patients have initiated treatment, 170 had a minimum follow-up time of 16 weeks, and 145 also had evaluable disease. In patients with evaluable disease, the DCR was 40% (58/145). Secondary endpoint analysis of DCR in all treated patients, showed DCR of 34% (58/170)."
