        "text": "By Jon Fredrik Skauge\n\nEditor’s note: On Friday, April 12, a very special weaving symposium was held under the auspices of Her Royal Majesty Crown Princess Mette-Marit, “Samlede Tråder” [Unifying Threads]. Many of the invited weavers posted in social media about the gathering. Jon Fredrik Skauge wrote a heartfelt memory of the day in an essay on his Facebook page. He agreed to share it.\n\nI noticed it as soon as I walked in the door of Queen Sonja’s Art Stable [Dronning Sonjas KunstStall], a feeling that is still with me. All the staff members stood waiting to receive the assortment of weavers. And if it wasn’t all of the palace staff, it was many. Everyone greeted and directed us; it was like being led into a safe textile embrace.\n\nWhen I attended my church meeting on Saturday, Bishop Ragnhild Jensen asked, “How was the weaving symposium yesterday?”\n\nYes, it felt nice. The stable was converted to a weaving studio for that day and Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess invited 260 women weavers and a few men to gather to pay tribute to weaving.\n\nFor that day the stable made for Queen Maud wasn’t filled with sawdust. No, it was as if the large hall was wrapped in the softest and finest of textiles. I felt like I was lifted in the finest woven comforter filled with down.\n\nI and many others have our favorite textiles, “hobby horses,” those we like to take out and ride in and out of season, and that would have been fine in the stable. But no, the Crown Princess made us put them away that day.\n\nEveryone was there for weaving – multi-faceted weaving that joins fibers of different threads into one another and creates the most beautiful expressive textiles in various techniques.\n\nWhy was this day at the palace so special? I pondered this between the long sessions of my church meeting. Because it was exceptional, a true red letter day for Norwegian textiles, a day I’ll never forget.\n\nWhat was it that the Royal House and Crown Princess did that day? They did what the Royal House is so good at, acting as a host – a host who sees and values everyone. Because there I sat, with noted artists, weaving teachers, researchers and talented craftspeople, weaving students, and us everyday weavers. We who love to throw a shuttle.\n\nThere were many fine presentations that day, and conversations. I was lucky enough to participate in one of them.\n\nAll of the elements were so well-arranged the program couldn’t have been better. The content was like colorful stripes in a weaving, and Kare Slaatsveen brought this fabric together by leading in her safe and warm manner of speaking.\n\nBut there is one conversation I especially remember: Her Majesty Queen Sonja’s brilliant dialogue with weaver Anne Britt Lotsberg, born in Fjærland, who has taken it upon herself to copy the weavings at Gamlehaugen in Bergen. There was an even playing field at that moment, the Queen and vevkjerringa [weaver] on the same level. And they played on stage, weaving words about this meticulous craft together. Because yes, it is painstaking work, weaving that takes quite a long time. The Queen was probably curious about whether Lotsberg would manage to copy everything at Gamelehaugen, so the Queen asked how old the weaver was.\n\nLottsberg replied, “It’s not a question of how old I am, but how old I can get.” Because that’s the way it is; good handwork takes time, and it takes the time it takes.\n\nA huge heartfelt thank you to Crown Princess Mette Marit for allowing me to participate and contribute to this memorable day. I thank the good Lord that the Crown Princess found weaving, and hope she will continue for many, many years. I will attend the last day of the church meeting in thankfulness.\n\nLong live weaving!\n\nJon Fredrik Skauge posted this on Facebook on April 14, 2024.\n\nJon Fredrik Skauge is a historian, bunad maker, cultural mediator and farmer from Orkdal, Norway. His book, Dei tapte tinga [The Lost Things], came out this year from Dreyer Publishing. When thieves broke into the family farm in 2022, objects worth hundreds of thousands of kroner and priceless sentimental value disappeared. In the weeks after the burglary, he spent a lot of time cleaning up every room, every cupboard and every drawer. He had to find out what was missing. In this process, he began to write down the stories of the things.\n\nSkauge was recently awarded first prize in the Holdbart håndverk [Lasting Handcraft] competition from Husflid magazine.

Thank you! Tusen takk!\n\nHer Royal Highness Mette-Marit, the Crown Princess of Norway, is an avid weaver. On April 12, 2024, in honor of her 50th birthday, she held a weaving symposium, “Unifying Threads.” These are her opening remarks.\n\nWelcome to Queen Sonja KunstStall [Art Stable] and to the weaving symposium.\n\nToday we are gathered in what is Queen Maud’s old riding stable. Imagine that a hundred years ago, Queen Maud sat up on that balcony and looked down on her beautiful horses. They were her great passion. And today, in the same place, we get to highlight and hold on to some of what is most important to us. I think there is something very beautiful about that.\n\nAnd had it not been for our beloved Queen Sonja’s ability to take care of culture and history, this beautiful room would not appear as it does today.\n\nSo I would like to thank the Queen for allowing us to gather here, but most of all for the fact that throughout your work you have held fast to the fact that culture and traditions are a vital part of being human and an important part of the task of the royal house.\n\nLast year I turned 50, and I really only had one wish: To be able to invite people from all over the country to a national weaving event. And so, dear all, I am very, very happy to be here with you today.\n\nI am so lucky to have been surrounded by handicraft throughout my upbringing. My mother and my three aunts sat bent over their handwork early and late. And if someone knitted, that was what all four were doing, and if someone embroidered, all four were doing it… I discovered quite early on that I was never very good myself. I don’t think I ever finished knitting a sweater. I just didn’t get it. Maybe I’m too imprecise. Maybe too impatient.\n\nBut that was until I discovered weaving.\n\nI started weaving just before the pandemic, and for me it has been a revelation. I want to say something about what it has meant to me. The first thing I learned was that warp and weft are only part of what creates a weaving. Perhaps the most important ingredient is patience. Patience is not something I was born with. And the times we live in and the technology we surround ourselves with have done something to our patience – the amount of information and the expectation of an immediate response has meant that our attention and our patience are divided into ever smaller pieces. But as with anything else, you get better with practice. Sitting at the loom trains patience. You can’t rush when you have to weave, and you gain patience with yourself and others. Have I become a more patient person from weaving? I don’t know what the Crown Prince would answer, but at least no less patient!\n\nI have also realized that “handcraft” and “handwork” are perhaps slightly misleading terms. That they are a bit mundane. Because the work may be done with the hands, but weaving is a complicated interaction, both in the loom and in the weaver. A direct connection is opened between the head, the heart – and the hands.\n\nIt also means that the loom becomes a mirror in many ways. The weaving is affected by how you feel about yourself. And if I am ever in doubt as to what kind of mood I am in, it becomes very clear when I sit down at the loom.\n\nI think everyone needs to have a space that is just for ourselves. And for many of us, our loom is that space.\n\n***\n\nElisabeth Haarr once said that stepping into the world of weaving is stepping into a world that is wide, beautiful and full of love. I have really felt that.\n\nFor one thing, the work is there at the loom – you and the loom. It is something else when you are lucky enough to have a place in a weaving community. This generous, wonderful community, where people ask and help and support each other, has really been a revelation for me. When I sit at the loom and can’t get things to work, all these lovely ladies come – with experience, smiles and often a good story. I learn something new, gain some new self-confidence – and the result is always better.\n\nI have realized that starting to weave is really the same as learning to ask for help. And it’s quite beautiful, because every time a human asks another human for help, when we help each other, the bonds between us are strengthened. In this sense, a weaving studio not only produces weavings, but also community. And really, we should all get better at asking each other for help when we need it – both within the weaving studio and without.\n\n***\n\nThese are exciting times for weaving. Most people sitting here today know that weaving and textile art have not always received the recognition they deserve. Therefore, it is incredibly gratifying to note that textile art is really on the rise. Interest and recognition in the textile field has increased considerably in recent years. All over the world, prestigious galleries and art institutions now showcase new and old textile artists on an equal footing with other art forms.\n\nIn Norway, we have been weaving since time immemorial, and fortunately there are quite a few men in the Norwegian weaving community. But weaving in Norway has traditionally been a women’s arena. And when you feel this strong community that arises around weaving, you sense a timelessness. You can hear the echo of weaving women who have sat shoulder to shoulder and helped each other.\n\nThe threads you work with stretch back, so to speak, hundreds of years, to the looms of the past. And these long lines emphasize how important it is that we take care of this history and its traditions. Therefore, we must make sure that there is a future for weaving.\n\nWhen I sit in the weaving room, I am often among the youngest – the hair colors in a weaving room tend to be – without offending anyone – 50 shades of grey. That is why it is so heartening to see that there are many young people now who want to study the old traditions, that more people choose weaving when they want to express themselves artistically, and that the Norwegian weaving community is growing. But for it to continue to flourish, we have to ensure good soil and good growing conditions. We have to make sure that the craft is not taken out of curricula and does not disappear from schools, and we have to make sure that it is possible to obtain a practical education in weaving.\n\nThat is part of the reason why we are gathered here today. Because the more densely woven something is, the more durable it becomes. Therefore, today we will try to gather some of the threads that make up the Norwegian weaving community. Because we really are diverse! There are 260 people here – weavers and weaving enthusiasts from art and handcraft, from organizations, educational institutions, galleries and museums. From small spinneries and large producers of wool products. Many of you already know each other, but we still hope that you will make some new connections during the day.\n\n***\n\nNow I’m really looking forward to the program. We have tried to bring out the great diversity in the craft and art to which we all belong. Everything from great artists with names we all know, to the many anonymous women and men who make everyday life more beautiful. I would like to thank each and every one of you sitting here today for your contribution to holding on to our culture and our traditions.\n\nAnd with that, I think we can welcome the woman who will lead the day with a somewhat strict but very friendly hand, Kari Slaatsveen.

Thank you! Tusen takk!\n\nBy Karin Bøe\n\nThe kvitveis tour that became the kviletjeld tour, part 2. See part one here.\n\nIn the previous post I wrote about finding four old wool duvets in a pile of old building materials. They looked awful after a winter outside, but for a craftsman interested in history they looked exciting. Now I want to tell you about the woolen duvet which looked the least exciting – won’t that be interesting?\n\nThis woolen duvet turned out to have a cover of cotton fabric on the outside. I tore it off. Then it was a wool duvet with a machine-woven wool blanket on one side and red fabric on the other side.\n\nWoolen duvets were made from old wool coverlets and pieces of woolen fabric, anything that could provide warmth. That’s why I had to look inside this boring woolen duvet and tear off the red fabric. There was a coarse burlap. Not so exciting. So then I had to tear that off as well.\n\nWait a minute, what color was the warp actually? It’s not just white, even if it’s very gray now. There are both some white and some dark threads! And there is no regular system for them! They appear helter skelter. How could this happen? If you run a warp with four threads at a time and have one white and three grey, they will of course repeat themselves. But they don’t.\n\nThen there were old quilts that had been patched together. They were quite grey, but I could see the red of the stripes that were woven into dark brown woolen yarn. A familiar and dear sight.\n\nI called a friend. I consulted with Annemor Sundbø and she believes that it is yarn that is spun with wool in different colors according to a random method, as you often see in warps on old Turkish carpets. Wow! Very cool. This gives a great effect in the background with dark stripes on it.\n\nI want to take care of this blanket. I brushed away all the fluff that was in the edges with a soft toothbrush and pulled out loose threads, because there were many of them when it was sewn together, layer upon layer. I took it up to the river and washed it. I could probably have washed it longer. It’s still quite grey, but it feels much better. A gray treasure!\n\nSo now I’m inspired to learn how to spin using the random method. I am practicing spinning with a drop spindle from rolls of fleece. I’ve learned from the old people that the warp should be spun on a drop spindle. This avoids a weak point every time you take a new roll. So you just have to keep at it, practice and practice.\n\nThink how much work went into these quilts and then the woolen duvets. A lot of wool was plucked, carded, spun, spun — many hours lie there, and a lot of love and not just toil, I hope. I am both impressed and humbled by our foremothers. Where would we be without their knowledge, experience, technique and courage?\n\n🤍🐏🪡🐏🤍🐏🪡🐏🤍🐏🪡🐏🤍🐏🪡🐏🤍\n\nKarin Bøe moved to Valle in Setesdal in 1995 as a craft instructor.

Skald Forlag, 2024.\n\nThe whole pattern looked like a cubist flower meadow strewn diagonally, sprinkled with small scintillating stars in a jumble of colors, cheerful and smiling… all talking over one other, yet playfully and without fuss. (Review of a coverlet exhibition in Kristiansand, 1925)\n\nSo begins the chapter on square-weave in the long awaited book, Vevd Fargeglede: Sengetepene i Vest-Agder [Woven Delight: The Coverlets of Vest-Agder]. With vibrant textiles pictured on nearly every page, author Nanne Støhlmacher presents the distinctive bed covers that were once prevalent in her district of Norway, from coverlets of serviceable yet decorative plain weave, to those woven in the unusual danskbrogd [Danish-weave] technique, an anomaly even in Vest-Agder.\n\nMany of the coverlet types from this southern district were also typical in other areas Norway – krokbragd and square weave, overshot and rya. But there were significant differences in the preferences of Vest-Agder weavers. Of particular note are the color nuance and pattern choice characteristic of the area’s square-weave coverlets. Unusual as well are the weft-faced techniques that often served as the groundweave in both rya and monk’s belt coverlets.\n\nThe book’s introduction by Bjørn Sverre Hol Haugen, curator at the Norwegian Folk Museum, provides the context for Vest-Agder’s coverlet tradition. Hol Haugen notes the social differences to be found between Vest-Agder’s narrow band of well-to-do and outward-looking coastal towns and the relatively conservative interior farming communities, with accompanying contrasts in what was typical for a bed and its accoutrements. He touches on the creation of bedding as an accustomed part of the yearly cycle on Vest-Agder’s mostly self-sufficient farms, and he introduces the work of pioneer textile research Anna Grostøl. Grostøl, a teacher who grew up in the coastal town of Lista, documented many Vest-Agder traditions that were fast disappearing by the early and mid-20th century. Her substantial collection of notes, photographs and samples, now held by the Norwegian Folk Museum, provides a rich resource on which Støhlmacher draws throughout the book.\n\nIn her thorough treatment of the coverlet tradition, Støhlmacher begins with a chapter on the materials, tools and dyes needed to make the coverlets, describing the enormous amount of work required before weaving could begin. She then devotes a chapter to each coverlet type, with sections on technique, materials, pattern and color. Støhlmacher’s grounding in textiles, from her own training in textile techniques at the Statens lærerskole i forming [Norwegian Teacher’s College in Handcraft] to her several years as a board member of Norges Husflidslag [the Norwegian Handcraft Association], is evident in her treatment of the subject and combines nicely with her enthusiasm for the textile traditions of her district. Building on the foundation provided by Anna Grostøl, she has seemingly left no stone unturned, perusing estate documents for indications of past coverlet usage and visiting remote farms on the chance that coverlets might be tucked away and forgotten in trunks or storehouses.\n\nAbove, detailed images of krokbragd, square-weave and skillbragd coverlets.\n\nThe text of this book is in Norwegian, with English summaries at the end of each chapter, but the visual impact of the book may compensate non-Norwegian readers for the inevitable loss of some historical detail. Each coverlet type is represented by a mix of full and detailed images that convey pattern and color, and the ornately carved or painted beds on which some of the coverlets appear allows one to appreciate the context in which these textiles were used.\n\nBeyond her textile knowledge, Støhlmacher’s interest in the cultural history that the coverlets represent is unmistakable. Visually striking among the many coverlets are the photos of both farm life and the women at the heart of this textile tradition. Most of these images are in black and white, pictures taken nearly a hundred years ago by Anna Grostøl while recording the recollections of her interviewees. The weather-beaten faces of these older women speak to a time and a way of life that is now gone, bringing to mind the countless women behind the textile traditions that are portrayed in this book.\n\nOn a personal note, it has been my pleasure to consult with Nanne Støhlmacher for over 10 years on this project, watching it grow from a sparsely outlined idea to a fully realized and impressive presentation of Vest-Agder’s coverlet tradition. Perhaps my own family’s roots in the district explain why I find these coverlets particularly appealing, with their patterns “all talking over one other, yet playfully and without fuss.”\n\nMay 2024\n\nKatherine Larson is an Affiliate Assistant Professor, Department of Scandinavian Studies, University of Washington.

Thank you! Tusen takk!\n\nBy Lill-Karin Elvestad\n\nOne day in 1863. Joy ignited in her chest as she closed the door behind her. It was chilly in the room, but she would soon warm up. The evening light that wandered past the window made the colors in the cloth stand out clearly. Green at the bottom and horizontal lines in red, black and blue. She knew each thread, they had slipped through her fingers as she spun them, and the colors were hers too. She still wondered how moss, lichen and birch leaves that were always just there, out in the landscape, could be transformed into strong colors and give life to grey-white wool.\n\nThey said she was good. They said she had her own flair for weaving, that what she created was beautiful. And maybe it was like that, but she thought mostly about getting the next thread as smooth as the previous one.\n\nShe settled herself, tightened the knot of hair at the nape of her neck and spread her arms over the weave like a pianist over the keys. Soon the rhythm found her and she fell into it and danced along.\n\nWomen’s Day, March 8, 2024. Today I think of my great-great-grandmother Ane Marie Aleksandersdatter, who was only 16-17 years old when she wove the dress you see in the picture. The thin, thin wool threads are perfectly even, and the pattern stands out clearly in four colors. Most likely she had carded and spun the wool herself, and perhaps also sheared the sheep. She gathered plants and vegetation to dye the yarn, and knew exactly which plants produced which color.\n\nThe whole painstaking process from wool on the sheep until she could put on the beautiful dress life and accompanying skirt, required knowledge, accuracy and creative urge.\n\nBut Ane Marie could not write. Maybe not read either. I know that because when I wrote the book Til livet skilte oss ad – skilsmissehistorier 1879-1909 [Till Life Did Us Part – Divorce Stories 1879-1909], in which her and her husband Theodor’s divorce is one of the stories, I saw that all the documents she had signed include m.p.p. underneath, which means med påholden penn [with held pen] – someone had held the pen for her.\n\nWas she illiterate? I don’t know.\n\nBut what I know today is that she had great abilities in textile art, on the same level as many other women of her time. Perhaps Ane Marie would have had a career as an artist and weaver if she had been placed in another place, in another time. But like thousands of other women whose significant knowledge and artistic abilities were given little recognition, Ane Marie came to live a quite anonymous life, a cog in the wheel of grey everyday existence.\n\nFortunately, Ane Marie’s daughter Anna, my great-grandmother, was far-sighted enough to give the dress life as a gift to the Tromsø museum sometime in 1935. Thanks to this, one day earlier in February this year I was able to join a conservator in the magazine at the museum and look at the art created by my own great grandmother.\n\nWhich again says a lot about the importance of preserving our cultural history! Happy Women’s Day!\n\nEditor’s note: Lill-Karin Elvestad wrote this tribute to her great-great-grandmother on Instagram recently, and I asked if I could include it with her other article, “Old Clothing Tells our Story.” She responded, “I’m just thrilled that the story of Ane Marie gets known. Her fate became somewhat dark and miserable, but she had outstanding skills that today would have brought her out in the great world, I think.”\n\nLill-Karin Elvestad is a writer, journalist and historian from Troms. Her interests lies in cultural history of Northern Norway, and she’s written several books and a lot of articles for various magazines through the years. She lives at a little farm in Balsfjord, in the midst of Troms, with a husband, two cats and two nearly grown up kids. On the farm there’s a house from 1926 which she restored in 2022 and now uses as a meeting place for arrangements, writing-courses and story-nights.

Thank you! Tusen takk!\n\nBy Emelie von Walterstorff\n\nTranslator’s note: This is an English version of the section on monk’s belt, or Swedish munkabälte, from the online Hemslöjds Guiden [Handcraft Guide] published by the Föreningen Sveriges Hemslöjdskonsulenter [Association of Swedish Handcraft Consultants]. I became interested in this monk’s belt variation with stars when I saw a beautiful coverlet purchased this year by my friend Annelie Holmberg. I found the Swedish guide describing these special star-filled monk’s belt weavings and received permission to share the information in English. Robbie LaFleur\n\nMunkabälte [monk’s belt], from the Scanian word for certain common four-shaft fabrics, is now widespread in Sweden. Two shafts are used to form the ground or base weave, and two for the pattern element, which, as in upphämta technique, lies loosely over the surface. The pattern threads are of two different lengths, for example over six and under two warp threads. The colored pattern threads, usually of wool (or cotton), contrast with the white linen ground weave. Certain weavings in southern Skåne have a black wool ground weave.\n\nIt has been debated whether monk’s belt is a technique or just a pattern. It is a weaving technique that was done earlier with a pick-up stick. One of the pioneers of the revival of Scanian textile methods near the end of the 1800s, Mrs. Thora Kulle in Lund, described how monk’s belt earlier was woven with a wide pick-up stick that was raised behind the ground weave, to lift the pattern threads. The square “star” or the two different stitch lengths of which it consists, in different combinations, was characteristic of what is called monk’s belt. However, the star has not always been woven with loose pattern threads. Here we can surmise that it probably became known partly through the famous Dutch dräll (weaves in which warp-float areas contrast with weft-float areas) satin weave. These dräll weavings dated to the 1600s are preserved in upper-class homes.\n\nRetrieved from Svenska vävnadstekniker och mönstertyper: Kulturgeografisk undersökning [Swedish Weaving Techniques and Pattern Types: Cultural Geographic Survey]. By Emelie von Walterstorff. Proceedings of the Nordic Museum: 11. Stockholm, 1940.\n\nMonk’s belt on Scanian blankets\n\nOr why not call them “flower blankets from the region of the green hills,”1 as it is so romantically described in Gammal allmogeslöjd fra Malmöhus län [Historical Handicraft from Malmöhus County] about the large decorative blankets in monk’s belt technique that were woven in large quantities in the areas around Vemmenhög county in Skåne.\n\nThat the beautiful weavings are described as “flower blankets” is not so strange considering that the weaving technique has been used in such a way that the pattern shapes imitate flowers. “It’s as if the women in Wemmenhög set out to create their own ‘garden’ with their work within the farm’s walls, which would be in bloom all year round.”\n\nThe monk’s belt technique is the simplest among the Scanian art weave techniques and has therefore perhaps not received as much attention as blankets and cushion covers in, for example, röllakan, flamskväv and krabbasnår. Despite the relatively simple technique, the women around Vemmenhög developed the pattern shapes and the technique into something very special and the textiles are well worth highlighting and admiring. “They give a telling testimony of the Scanian people’s passion and ability to compose patterns even in simple forms.” What gives a monk’s belt pattern its basic character is the so-called monk’s belt star. This basic shape has since been assembled into a variety of patterns.\n\nThe monk’s belt star\n\nThe ground weave of a monk’s belt fabric consists of a plain weave, or two-shaft weave. The pattern is formed by a number of pattern elements that float above and below the base fabric. According to Anna-Maja Nylén2, monk’s belt is a Scanian dialectal term for a four-shafted fabric where two of the shafts form the base fabric and two form the pattern. Technically, monk’s belt and, for example, tärningsväv fabric are similar, but the pattern shapes differ. In tärningsväv fabric, the monk’s belt star does not occur.\n\nZickerman3 writes that the name monk’s belt does not really denote the name of an individual technique but a variation of the dräll technique, “but this form has come to – in some localities – make such a strong contribution to the village, that it has been counted as a separate technique.” Both in terms of pattern and technology, monk’s belt has a clear connection with textiles that were imported during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nMonk’s belt fabrics of various types have been manufactured throughout the country, mostly on linen bottom fabric with an interlaced pattern so that the textiles have cross-striped pattern formations. But in south-west Skåne, the monk’s belt technology developed in a very special way. In the areas around Vemmenhög’s district (see map) large magnificent weavings have monk’s belt stars that have been picked star by star in different colors so that the blankets have the expression of blooming meadows. The ground fabric of these weavings usually consists of black or black-brown plain weave in wool on a linen warp.\n\nIn an inventory of older textiles, dating from the 17th century to 1840, carried out by Lissie Möller under the auspices of the Malmöhus läns hemslöjdsförenings [Malmöhus County Handcraft Association] during the years 1918-1925, no fewer than 561 monk’s belt blankets were inventoried in Malmöhus County, mainly around the Vemmenhögs, Skytts and Oxie districts. This can be compared with how many blankets were inventoried in other weaving techniques at the same time in Malmöhus County: 122 blankets in röllakan, 97 blankets in krabbasnår, 34 in dukagång, 6 in flamskvävnad, 94 in rosengång, and no less than 2,205 blankets in opphämta.\n\nThrough the inventory, it can be established that blankets in monk’s belt technique were the second most common technique when it comes to woven blankets in Malmöhus County during the period. However, we cannot know for sure whether all of these 561 weavings were of the “flower blanket” type with inlaid pattern details. It is possible that also blankets with only inlaid patterns appear among the inventory material.\n\nThrough Möller’s inventory, we can also deduce that the monk’s belt technique in Malmöhus county was mostly used for blankets and not for cushion covers. In terms of woven cushions, only 59 in monk’s belts have been inventoried in the county compared to 1,232 in röllakan, 852 in opphämta, 462 in flamskvävnad, 355 in tränsaflossa [a half-pile technique], 297 in krabbasnår, 68 in dukagång, and 20 in rosepath.\n\nWhat is characteristic of the flower blankets around Vemmenhög is that the monk belt stars are picked in different colors and not shuttled across (which is more common). On the vast majority of blankets, the stars also form diamond-shaped patterns over the surface. There are two main groups within the blankets – those with a striped bottom and those with a solid color. In addition, there are four different ways to insert the monk’s belt pattern. The different pattern placements depend on how the warp is threaded, or alternatively how the pick-up stick has been used in the weaving.\n\nStriped Ground Weave\n\nThe striped blankets are considered to be the oldest1 and on some there are both picked and shuttled monk’s belt patterns. The bottom striping can consist of only wide fields in different colors, color fields that are separated by one or more narrow stripes, or stripes with shuttled monk’s belt patterns. Examples of different stripes can be found in pictures 1, 2 and 3. Sometimes the shuttled pattern has been excluded in favor of the picked one (for example on the blanket in picture 1). You can guess that the blanket was then woven with a pick-up stick and not with a threaded pattern. When a shuttled monk’s belt pattern occurs, the entire star is often not included vertically in the stripes (see examples in pictures 2 and 3). Sometimes the stars have been placed colorwise so that diamond shapes form across the surface, but this is not as common as on blankets with a plain base. Diamond shapes on the surface often become a little more indistinct and harder to perceive on blankets with a striped bottom because you are distracted by the stripes. Borders around the edges seldom occur on striped blankets. On the other hand, they are very common on those with a solid color base.\n\nPlain Ground Weave\n\nMost of the blankets have been woven with a plain base, usually in black or black-brown. On blankets with a plain background, the stars have almost always been placed in terms of color so that diamond patterns are formed over the surface in different ways. You can see that in pictures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Most of them also have a border of some kind either in monk’s belt or krabbasnår (the blankets in pictures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 all have a border in krabbasnår but with slightly different pattern shapes). Picked-up krabbasnår stars are also often included in the center of the pattern shapes, as on the blankets in pictures 4, 5 and 7. On blankets with a single-colored base, pattern stripes with shuttled monk’s belts never occur. Often the bars have been used so that large coherent diamond shapes show clearly in the patterns. In picture 8 you can clearly see this (green bars). On the blankets in pictures 4 and 7, the bottom has been kept solid black and not filled with bars, here only the independent monk’s belt star has been used in the pattern shapes together with the krabbasnår stars. On the weavings in pictures 5 and 6, there are also no bars used as padding between the monk’s belt stars. Here, instead, it is the visible ground weave between the stars that highlights the diamond pattern formed by the monk’s belt stars.\n\nEvery one is unique\n\nThe main thing that can be said when you look at the monk’s belt blankets from south-west Skåne is that there are great variations in pattern compositions and expressions. Many blankets seem quite similar at first glance, but upon closer inspection you will see that there are differences. This is probably due to the fact that a development of the pattern forms has been ongoing. A blanket was woven, another weaver used it as a template and changed something a little in the pattern composition or treadled differently. Perhaps she moved a star, wove a different border or chose a different color combination. The blankets have been given different expressions depending on the patterns, tools, aids and knowledge the weavers had. One might think that the monk’s belt star as a flower shape has been the central thing and not the technique itself.\n\nOne can’t help but admire these women who had such imagination and skill to compose different flower blankets and one has to agree with the statement that “Nowhere has it flourished as in the green hills.”1\n\nBelow are more examples of how the blankets could look.
