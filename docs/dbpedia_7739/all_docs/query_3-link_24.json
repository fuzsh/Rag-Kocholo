        "text": "Can Norwegian journalism be meaningfully understood as constituting a social field in Pierre Bourdieu ́s sense? And if so, how did this field emerge historically, and what is its fundamental structure? Following a structural history of the rise of journalism in Norway, a model of this field in 2005 is sketched through correspondence analysis using survey data on Norwegian journalists and editors. The analysis suggest a bipolar structure: a first dimension of capital volume that is closely linked to age, gender and medium type, and a second dimension that opposes agents with different degrees of internal recognition (symbolic capital), which in particular separates specialized news journalists in national and larger regional journalistic publications from journalists in the local press and magazines. Special attention is given to the link between this social cosmos and a specific cosmology of journalistic beliefs and position-takings, the relation between journalistic power and social class, and the intertwinedness of symbolic and economic dominance in this field.\n\nThis dissertation analyses the power and democratic function of political commentators writing for legacy newspapers in contemporary Norway. Although such commentators are highly visible in the public debate, this study finds that their overall readership has decreased significantly in the last decade. Commentators increasingly form and inform an elite group of writers and readers. Whilst the limited scholarly literature is predominantly critical of commentators, this study argues that the increasing fragmentation of the public sphere calls for reappraisal. Commentators, benefiting from a privileged access to elite political sources, are in a position where they may inform the electorate by interpreting, analysing, and explaining complex political processes. To fulfil this remit and thus live up to their democratic function, legacy newspapers must strive to meet new demands of accessibility and representation. By employing a mixed methods research design, this dissertation analyses Norway’s fraught media landscape through the frameworks provided by Bourdieu, Habermas, Anderson and Sunstein, with the aim to analyse commentators in a new context – the age of social media.\n\nPhotojournalism might be the media practice experiencing the fastest technical, normative and ideological change in the field of journalism today. At the same time, photojournalism practitioners seem to have become the proverbial canary-bird in the media, as staff photographers are laid-off and photo departments in both Swedish and international newspapers have been diminished or even closed down. Yet hitherto, much of the scholarly in-depth research on the on-going changes in journalism has focused on changes in journalist’s practice, norms and ideals. Thus, this pilot study will try to identify which photojournalistic routines, values, norms, and ideals might still be in use and examine how and if they have changed within the evolving field of journalism. Trying to fulfil this aim, a series of semi-structured interviews with in total six photojournalists where conducted, in addition to two mail interviews based on the interview questions and a one-day participant observation with a collective of Swedish freelance photojournalists in photo agency. The findings were later categorized to facilitate a deeper understanding, studied through Bourdieu’s sociological concepts, to identify the field’s different structures, struggles and ideologies. Keywords: Photojournalism, Bourdieu, field theory, doxa, in-depth interviews, participant observation.\n\nIs journalism going through ‘de-professionalization’ or is it just entering a new phase – taking a different shape? And what is the meaning of professional ideals such as scrutiny and autonomy in these processes? In my thesis, “Journalism in Transition”, I discuss these matters, focusing on the case of Swedish journalists. Empirical support is drawn from a national survey conducted five times since 1989 on the Dept. of Journalism, Media and Communication at the University Gothenburg (JMG). Questions about journalists’ perceptions of various ideals offer excellent opportunities to explore possible homogenization vs. fragmentation, and what the attitudinal dimensions actually say about the professional content of Swedish journalism. The results are analyzed by the conceptualization of Bourdieu’s field theory, along with current professional theory, and point at a possible separation of professional levels where a few ideals constitute an over-arching professional identity, while the flora of attitudes below is more diverse and dependent on factors of organizational affiliation, gender and age. Professional ideals may furthermore be regarded as a form of symbolic capital, used as legitimizing tools in journalism’s struggle for maintaining status quo. A main conclusion is that journalism is not de-professionalizing on ideological level, but going through a re-formation. Traditional journalistic ideals have attained increasing support over time and the efforts to fix professional boundaries are fierce. These boundaries are, however, subjects of negotiation: In the professional identity formation of Swedish journalists between 1989-2005 I also detect and increasing orientation towards liberal- and market values, which I interpret as the incorporation of organizational values into the professional identity – thereby legitimizing those. A second conclusion is that social attributes such as gender, age and formal qualifications mean less to the professional identity formation in 2005 than they did in 1989. The reason for this is the increasing homogenization of journalistic ideals – all journalists think increasingly alike, no matter social background. Factors still being highly relevant, though, are gender, journalistic training and place of work. Those factors determine journalists’ positions in the field and consequently form their professional identities into various shapes. Keywords: Journalism, professionalism, professional identity, fragmentation, homogenization, Bourdieu, professional discourse, journalistic field, gender identity, organizational identity, managerial discourse\n\nThe NSA/Snowden revelations represent a case for studying the degree of journalistic autonomy versus the political field, in a situation where national and international security is at stake. In an era of rapid digital transition the revelations constitute a unique moment for studying field relations. This article examines the coverage of the NSA/Snowden revelations of massive transnational surveillance in six national Norwegian newspapers, with a main emphasis on opinionated articles. By way of content analysis we find that a clear majority of the editorials demonstrate a supportive attitude to Edward Snowden and treat him as a whistleblower, while treating the publishing journalists in The Guardian as situated within a proud tradition of investigative journalism, albeit with some diversity of opinion. In external opinionated contributions, a majority of the items reveal a critical attitude towards this surveillance and a supportive attitude towards Snowden. With a few exceptions, politicians do not take part in these exchanges, and are challenged for their low degree of engagement by several editorials. The article demonstrates a strong field autonomy vis-à-vis a political field where only a few parliamentarians came out in support of Snowden.\n\nPutting a Face on It analyses and discusses how subjectivity and exposure of individuals now affect most journalistic topics and genres: from politics to sports journalism, from science journalism to journalism about terrorism. Individual exposure and subjectivity affect news and features, photos and front pages, and are at the core of an increasing dialogue with digital media users. One aim of this book is therefore to present some of this variation. Another is to contribute to the discourse about the present state of journalism and where it is heading. Putting a Face on It will appeal to researchers, teachers, students, writers, journalists and other media-interested readers.\n\nThe article addresses the following questions: How newsworthy were the global unrests as phenomena and which areas did the Norwegian press focus on? Did the global protest become a part of the Norwegian media agenda in 1968? Did the party commitments of the selected newspapers influence their reporting of protests and revolts as phenomena? Which of the Norwegian newspapers had the most extensive coverage of the protests and revolts? Furthermore, with respect to the Nordic countries: Did geographical and cultural proximity to events in Scandinavia lead to a more comprehensive coverage of these events? Based on a quantitative analysis of the total coverage of demonstrations, strikes and riots in selected Norwegian dailies in 1968, this article disputes Galtung and Ruge's classical hypothesis about geographical and cultural proximity as one of the most important news criteria."
