        "text": "Ulla Abildgaard, born in Denmark 1961\n\nI was inspired by my mothers drawings when I was a little girl . I started secretly to draw whilst hidding in my own room when I was 15 - often spening hours in my \"naughty room\" killing time while producing numerous of drawings which are still a precious belong of mine. Im mainly self taught and have developed my own destinct tecnique by using plastic cards and other \"tools\" instead of brushes. I have also studied printmaking and artphotography.\n\nI became more more devoted to my art and in 2006 I started to participate in exhibitions allowing me to sell and creating a name for myself\n\n~\n\nBjorn Hansen, born in Denmark 1953.\n\n40 years ago I had fun combining images in the darkroom, but my current enthusiasm and interest was dormant for a long time. A few years ago I started taking a lot of landscape shots which allowed me to combine many of them with images of models I had taken. Iâ€™ve always experimented and one day the images fused together perfectly and I knew this was a new path for me\n\nI am a very curious and inventive person by nature and have the ability to see in my mind how images could come together. Slowly in Photoshop I changed the original images with different plug-in's in order to create the final images - what I call Photographic Fusion Art.\n\n~"
