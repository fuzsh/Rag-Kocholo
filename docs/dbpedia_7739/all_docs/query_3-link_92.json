        "text": "While Oslo has the most venues and might be the preferred destination for most international artists and bands, the large student cities like Bergen, Trondheim, Tromsø, and Stavanger also have a myriad of gigs all year round. The fact that artists now tour more extensively makes it more likely that the top-notch bands will come to several cities in Norway during a tour.\n\nOslo Spektrum and Telenor Arena are the venues for the largest concerts in Oslo, while Rockefeller Music Hall and Sentrum Scene are typically used for the mid-sized ones. If you’re into clubbing and electronic music, Blå (placed in one of Oslo’s most striking locations) and Parkteatret are clubs with a good reputation worldwide. Not to mention the capital’s very active and exciting underground scene.\n\nIn Bergen, Grieghallen and Ole Bull Scene are popular venues, while Koengen has hosted outdoor events with major artists like Bruce Springsteen and Foo Fighters. USF Verftet and Kvarteret have a somewhat younger and more adventurous profile.\n\nIf you’re more into classical music, The Oslo Philharmonic has its home in Oslo Konserthus (a venue that also hosts pop and rock concerts), while the Norwegian Opera and Ballet also regularly hosts more traditional concerts. The Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, which had Edvard Grieg as its artistical director in the 1880s, performs regularly as well, mostly in Grieghallen."
