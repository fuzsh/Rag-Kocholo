        "text": "The Reformed and Anabaptist traditions ignore each other at the best of times, yet there are genuine contributions to be gained from bringing elements of these traditions into dialogue. Perhaps the Anabaptist attention to the association of Satan with earthly kingdoms in Scripture may enrich the Reformed understanding of antithesis. In this paper, the author makes efforts towards a Biblical Theology of Satanâ€™s kingdom by examining the instances where Satan or the Devil is associated with earthly states in the Bible. For the purpose of this paper, a state refers to refer to a socio-political organisation of human beings in a physical location structured hierarchically and characterising an inward and outward dimension. It is argued that Scripture pervasively identifies not only unbelievers but also unbelieving institutions with Satan. The paper concludes with a reflection on the relationship between churches and the State via 2 Corinthians 6:15-7:1. Keywords: Satan, the Devil, the State, Church and State, Biblical Theology, political theology.\n\nThis essay will examine the biblical presence of demons and evil spirits within the biblical text. It is the intent of this author to steer a path through the biblical clues in an attempt to reveal who these evil spirits and demons are said to be. It will be shown that within the biblical text one can find the terms angels, demons, and spirits being used synonymously. And that this fact that these terms are being used as synonymous support the view that fallen angels are in fact these same evil spirits and demons. There will be some arguments of scriptural reasoning within this essay that will be an attempt to highlight contradictions of other views of who these evil spirits and demons might be. This essay is not intended to be a one stop information bag for considering the multiple views of who these demons and evil spirits are within the biblical text. However, it is the intent of this essay to give one biblical view of what the Bible has to say about who these demons and evil spirits might be."
