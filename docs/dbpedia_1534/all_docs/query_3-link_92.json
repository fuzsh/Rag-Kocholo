Poland was even said to be “the most cheerful barrack of the people’s democracies”. Political jokes were a popular form of commenting on reality, following in the wake of every important event. They described the social, political, and economic conditions, often constituting the base for cabaret performances, entertaining the public. However, before performing, the cabarets had to obtain the consent of the censorshipCensorshipcensorship office (the Main Office of Press, Publication and Event Control). Political humor developed in the Polish cinema as well. Popular comedies, such as those by Stanisław Bareja, showed the absurdity that surrounded the Poles every day in a crooked mirror. A similar role was fulfilled by the Orange Alternative founded at the beginning of the 80s. Its peculiar happenings (such as “There is no freedom without dwarves” or „Revolution of Dwarves”) served as derision for the actions of the authorities.\n\nUnfortunately, everyday life was not as jolly as presented in the movies and cabaret performances. The bleak reality of the Polish People’s Republic entailed everyday struggle against basic good shortages; the goods themselves were rationed (ration stampsRation Stampsration stamps, the lines were extremely long, and the work compensation was barely worth anything outside of Poland. On the other hand, everyone had a job, since unemployment did not exist (it was hidden), and enjoyed cheap workers’ dining facilities and vacations. The official celebrations of state holidays were an indispensable element of life in the Polish People’s Republic as well, often accompanied by processions.\n\nThose times also featured rich cultural and sports life, with the Poles achieving great success in both camps. In particular, the 70s were a successful decade for Poland. The Polish Olymplic team won a great many medals in Munich, and the Polish football team thrived under the representation coach, Kazimierz Górski. The Polish posters and movies triumphed culturally, especially the moral inquietude movie genre represented by Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Zanussi.\n\nTask 1\n\nRg7DC75sEVeEV\n\nTask 2\n\nRemind me what was celebrated on July 22 in the Polish People's Republic.\n\nRyrWTXng6omjM"
