        "text": "Political changes in Slovakia after 1989 initiated new economic trends which significantly affected the structure of cities and rural municipalities. The process of suburbanization has changed the rural landscape with a widespread increase in new residential areas. Based on an analysis of residential suburbanization, the aim of the paper is to describe the encroachment of residential construction in the suburban zone of Nitra through increase in the size of the housing stock, number of housing types and the spatial localization of suburban construction. Such analysis of residential development contributes to the knowledge of the extent and intensity of the residential suburbanization process in the outskirts of the city of Nitra. Theoretical analysis of residential suburbanization is based on the relevant literature, placing it into context alongside the works of authors from Western and Central Europe. The research is based on standard geographical methods including field research....\n\nExamining the urban sprawl around middle-size cities in Hungary and Central Europe the rural change and suburbanization can be characterized by residential out-migration from cities and at the same time by immigration from the rural areas. These processes have intensibed in the former socialist countries after the 2000s and a number of problems have not been addressed, which have become apparent during the eighties and nineties in Western countries. A fast urban sprawl took place with a low level of special control and planning but under the pressure of economic and financial development. The rate of spatial growth often exceeds the rate of population growth, it even occurs in the absence of population growth. In Central European countries, the main destination for migration is the capital cities and their suburbs, therefore suburbanisation studies focus on these areas. However, our aim is to focus on regional centres and their agglomerations, comparing them to capital cities and ru...\n\nUrban sprawl is an unfavourable phenomenon not only in economic terms, but also due to the social and spatial effects. The failure to implement a coherent spatial policy in suburban areas may result in a chaotic distribution of residential buildings and cause spatial disorder. The main aim of this study is to present the classification of residential housing in the Krakow Functional Urban Area (FUA). Another objective of the study is to analyse the distribution of residential buildings in selected area. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the chaotic suburbanization causes an uneven distribution of residential buildings in Krakow FUA. The urban transect method was selected to illustrate the spatial distribution of residential buildings in this area. Additionally, GIS analyses were performed based on official spatial data describing the location and type of residential buildings. Thanks to the combination of both methods, a classification of residential housing and its spatial di...\n\nThis article concerns the challenges related to the management of public funds in the context of suburbanization phenomena. Theories of economic development and their implications for the directions of state intervention are presented. Based on the example of spending European funds in Poland, the rationale for this intervention is discussed. Systematic research concerns the surroundings of two urban centers in Poland-Wroc≈Çaw and Kielce. Examples of projects and conclusions from direct surveys conducted among stakeholders are analyzed. Although any suburbanization processes are important for the analyzed regions, they are not adequately included in development programs implemented with the support of the EU funds."
