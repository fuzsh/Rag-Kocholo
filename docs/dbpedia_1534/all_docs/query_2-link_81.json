        "text": "This article presents the life and activity of Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa, education organiser and socially engaged journalist, who made it possible for hundreds of women to enjoy higher education, ensured access to scientific publications, and brought to attention an awareness of the need for social work. Co-creator of specific forms of education for adolescent girls and women. Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa was active in an epoch of the underprivileged social and economic status of women in a country whose entire population was deprived of political rights. By means of her actions and publications she contributed to inspiring not only women aware of their rights but also citizens of a non-existent state. Even though Jadwiga Szczawińska-Dawidowa was, first and foremost, a person of action she remained, at the same time, a pragmatic visionary. K E Y W O R D S : Adult education, women's education, 'flying university', women's journalism. The aim of this article is to portray a single person, whose importance for Polish adult education deserves more attention than it has hitherto received. Despite Szczawińska-Dawidowa's attainments not many studies described and analysed her prominence in the history of adult education. Only two scholarly articles are devoted entirely to her educational and social achievements. Today, the article by Stanisław Jedlewski (1956) is difficult reading because it is \"tainted\" by Marxist-Leninist drivel. Nevertheless, it contains a number of useful facts, sober observations, and thoughtful assessments. The second article (Muszczyńska, 2017) is more of a summary of known information, and thus does not contribute much to our knowledge about Szczawińska-Dawidowa. Therefore, the main source of information about her life and achievements\n\nThis article discusses the early life of Maksymilian Boruchowicz (1911–1987), a Jewish writer, publicist, and literary critic known in interwar Kraków, who changed his name to Michał Borwicz after the Second World War. Biographical information on his life before the outbreak of the war focuses mainly on his studies of Polish language and literature at the Jagiellonian University, where he was actively involved in student literary and cultural circles, as well as political journalism. During his studies and immediately thereafter, Borwicz published prolifically in various magazines and literary journals, and before the war published the novel Miłość i rasa (Love and Race), which was received positively by literary critics.\n\nSchool chronicles are one of important but sometimes underestimated sources of information for the history of education. The difficulties with their use result from their dispersion, lack of availability and subjective nature. However, despite their subjectivity, they can provide extremely interesting in­ formation, e.g. on biographies of individual educators. This article focuses on the war fate of school teachers in the Eastern Greater Poland. Almost all of them lost their jobs as a result of the closure of schools. Many were deported to the General Government or to forced labour in Germany. Those who stayed undertook off-an-on work or jobs that had nothing to do with the teaching profession. Despite the threat to their lives, some of them were also engaged in secret teaching. Unfortunately, there were also those who decided to collaborate with the German occupier. The research included in this article should be considered an introduction to research in this source area.\n\nThis article evaluates the situation of two renowned scientists in Poland, namely the microbiologist and serologist Ludwik Hirszfeld (1884-1954), and the metallurgist Jan Czochralski (1885-1953), during the time of the German occupation from 1939-45. Both scientists strove to continue their scientifi c work even under the conditions of occupation but faced substantially different treatment by the occupiers: Hirszfeld was forced to live in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Czochralski was allowed to stay in his home and work at the former Technical University of Warsaw. The article takes a comparative approach and will analyse the life situation of both scientists. This means looking at the limits of action for both scientists on one side, and on the other, at the room for manoeuvre, which, under the conditions of a brutal occupation, either emerged for the two of them or they actively created."
