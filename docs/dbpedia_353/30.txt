The Logic One Automated Building Control System consists of programmable executive modules and a network of intelligent controllers, designed to provide control systems from single and stand-alone sites to complex networks of remote buildings. The executive modules offered are Lingo® (for applications with multiple buildings at multiple sites), Savvy® (for medium to large buildings at multiple sites), and Envoi® (for small buildings at multiple sites). The user can communicate with Logic One via the Web, making it easy to monitor or modify buildings, manage energy usage, and analyze alarms, states the company.
