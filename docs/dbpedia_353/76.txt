NOVAR 1106 and NOVAR 1114 power factor controllers are fully automatic instruments that allow optimum control of reactive power compensation. They take their design concepts from the NOVAR 1xx/2xx line of instruments, bringing up a number of improvements and new features while keeping same proven control methods.

It features a precise voltage and current measurement circuit with high accuracy of both true RMS values of voltage and current as well as accurate power factor measurement. The built-in temperature sensor measures the temperature inside the distribution board cabinet.

The instrumentâ€™s installation is fully automatic. The controller detects both the connection configuration and the value of each compensation section connected. Entering these parameters manually at a later stage is also possible.
