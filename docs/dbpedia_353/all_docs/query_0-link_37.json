        "text": "Trend Controls\n\nWith a Global focus on Energy and CO2 emissions, the Trend system is well suited to provide on going monitoring of energy consumption and environmental conditions, allowing for optimization of plant operation and a potential reduction in associated energy costs whilst ensuring that comfort conditions are maintained. The Trend package of advanced products, specialist services and a tried and tested route to market, not only provides systems that are fit for purpose but also ensures lowest lifetime costs.\n\nBuilding Energy Management Systems (or BEMS) are computer-based systems that help to manage, control and monitor building technical services (HVAC, lighting etc.) and the energy consumption of devices used by the building. They provide the information and the tools that building managers need both to understand the energy usage of their buildings and to control and improve their buildingsâ€™ energy performance.\n\nBy applying a range of HVAC control and monitoring routines a Trend Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is capable of operating the building services in strict accordance with demand, thereby avoiding unnecessary use of energy."
