        "text": "Lowering costs is a challenge every facilities manager faces and, at present, it’s a particularly pressing one. In broad terms, meeting the challenge successfully means maximizing asset usage and improving operational efficiency. The latter is particularly important because simply upgrading or replacing assets to get better results isn’t always a practical approach. Sometimes, it makes far more sense to make sure the assets you already have are primed to operate more efficiently. That’s possible if you can achieve greater control of their performance. However, as we’ll see below, it isn’t always straightforward to do. So, let’s look at what steps we can take.\n\nThe unitary controller issue\n\nThe key step we’ll discuss in this blog relates to unitary controllers for both HVAC and lighting. To understand why we need to know what these are and what role they play so let’s start with some definitions. What, exactly, are these?\n\nUnitary controllers are a technology that sits within the domain of building automation. Their use leads to improved overall performance of HVAC and lighting systems, mainly by making them more energy efficient. These unitary controllers report to an executive controller which acts as the lead automation device for the building. Both unitary and executive controllers can be sourced from different manufacturers.\n\nController technology is fast developing, and this has created something of a problem because the latest, improved functionality is desirable. In many cases, a new executive controller can provide a bevy of new features and functionality. Facilities managers thus want the freedom to choose their executive controllers without being locked-in to their legacy products which may well no longer be meeting their evolving requirements.\n\nPresently, many managers are reported to be dissatisfied with the performance of their existing executive controllers, but they feel constrained because swapping them out in what amounts to a vendor lock-in situation isn’t easy.\n\nAmong available executive controller options, the NexRev Freedom solution allows for flexibility with an open platform design. NexRev also continues to develop new features and functionality within their Freedom solution.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe Novar replacement issue is important because facilities will - over time - have invested significant sums in the hardware infrastructure which exists downstream of their Novar executive controllers. This means that they can’t cost-effectively solve the problem by simply ripping and replacing their executive controllers if the result is that various downstream devices are impacted and need to be replaced too. What can they do?\n\nAt NexRev, we’ve developed an answer: the N-Net Driver that allows NexRev Freedom to integrate directly to Novar unitary controllers. This driver allows the end user to upgrade their executive controller to a NexRev Freedom solution, without requiring replacement of downstream Novar legacy hardware and thus allowing the user to end its Novar relationship. As a result, our N-Net driver dramatically reduces the cost of achieving increased efficiency and improved performance by delivering the benefit of a new system without the expense of one.\n\nTo summarize the benefits in simple terms, installing the driver:\n\nEnds the Novar lock-in\n\nAllow reuse of existing unitary hardware\n\nSwaps out the Novar executive controller with the NexRev panel\n\nProvides access to IoT enabled EMS\n\nSupports AI based insights and recommendations\n\nEnables access to robust analytics and reporting\n\nImproves customer service\n\nImproved user experience that helps drive innovation\n\nFurthermore, moving to the NexRev panel via the N-Net driver also gives facilities managers access to NexRev Enterprise, a powerful cloud-based EMS / BMS for managing multi-site operations.\n\nImprove operational performance and maximize returns\n\nThe bottom line here is simple. Facilities managers today require a general, integrated control platform to optimize the performance of their HVAC and to better control costs.\n\nMany times, such a platform will need to accommodate existing Novar system functionality easily and cost-effectively. NexRev’s N-Net Driver has been built to enable the desired outcome to be achieved. In so doing, it allows existing Novar investments to continue to be leveraged while the user simultaneously severs ties with Novar itself.\n\nAt NexRev, we’ve been unlocking the power of facility and energy management data with over a million connected devices across North America. Our team of experts is focused on helping you deliver more with your budgets, infrastructure, and assets to create sustainable savings in operations and energy, reducing your risk and increasing operational confidence."
