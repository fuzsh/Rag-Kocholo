        "text": "When the temperature in a Staples store in Orlando, Fla. climbs to 76 degrees, Amanda Turack wants to know why. From her computer monitor in Cleveland, Turack, a technician at Honeywell's Novar energy management business, suspects a rooftop air-conditioning unit might be on the fritz. She pinpoints the problem in one AC unit remotely--it's loaded with Honeywell diagnostic circuitry that communicates via the Internet to Cleveland--and dispatches a repairman to fix a failed fan motor, ensuring that the unit won't waste electricity and cut Staples' profits.\n\nNovar is just one part of the net Honeywell has cast worldwide. With energy controls in 150 million homes, 10 million businesses and the bulk of the world's largest oil refineries, Honeywell is cashing in on worries over power costs and greenhouse gases. Its Novar operation, just one part of the Automation & Controls System division, serves 40,000 retail stores, which account for 1% of U.S. energy consumption. All told, 60% of sales at ACS come from products and services that relate to energy efficiency. Products include $450 Prestige programmable home thermostats and multimillion-dollar automated combustion controls used by refiners and chemical manufacturers. \"Their number one input cost is natural gas and oil,\" says ACS Chief Roger Fradin. \"They will kill for a half-percentage point more efficiency.\"\n\nWhile Honeywell's Aerospace division remains the most profitable of Honeywell's businesses, generating 47% of net income last year, ACS is the fastest-growing (and now largest) segment. Last year ACS revenue increased 12% to $14 billion, 38% of the company total. ACS profit rose 15% to $1.6 billion. Aerospace profit grew 5%.\n\nSome of Honeywell's upgrades are of the Duh! variety. It might replace a store's incandescent lights with compact fluorescents, or install a variable-speed fan control on a heater and link it to a programmable thermostat. Light and ventilation account for 80% of retailers' energy use. Mundane efficiency fixes can cut 20% from energy bills, says Fradin.\n\nNovar installed smart meters in Staples' California stores that cut their combined peak-hour draw by 1.5 megawatts. Novar's command center can check if gadgets in any of Staples' 1,500 stores nationwide are on after hours. An \"employee lighting program\" automatically turns on just a few lights when workers arrive before store hours and alternates which lights get turned on each day to extend bulb life. Honeywell's system knocked 15% off Staples' power bills, paying for itself within two years. \"Having another set of eyes and ears paying attention to energy use makes a big difference,\" says Bob W. Valair, Staples' energy manager.\n\nHoneywell has been in the energy management business since 1886, when its predecessor, Minneapolis' Butz Thermo-Electric Regulator, introduced the first automated furnace control. Honeywell released its trademark round thermostat in 1953 and has sold 85 million of the devices. Fifteen years ago the focus of its building controls business and of Novar (which Honeywell purchased for $1.5 billion in 2005) was to provide comfort and, in industrial settings, safety. But as energy prices have risen, efficiency has become a focus.\n\nHoneywell's next big opportunity may come with the jihad against carbon, as embodied in the pending cap-and-trade legislation. Consulting company McKinsey & Co. estimates that cost-saving industrial and building efficiency upgrades could cut U.S. end-use energy demand 17% below 2008 levels by 2020. Honeywell is already in the green gold rush in Europe. At a Toyota plant in Derby, England, regulated under Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme, Honeywell installed \"predictive controls\" to model how the temperature of air flowing into the factory's power-hungry paint booth system will affect quality. The system heats or cools the air just enough to meet paint booth requirements, cutting its energy use by 25%, says Ikuo Kasahara, Toyota's head production engineer in Europe.\n\nIf efficiency is such a good deal, why isn't everyone signing up? \"At the C-level energy has always been considered a fixed cost that you couldn't have much impact on,\" says Dean Lindstrom, who heads the Novar unit. But, he says, the payback--for the customer and for the atmosphere--often comes faster in efficiency than in alternative energy, like solar.\n\nThe upfront costs scare off businesses during a recession. That explains why Honeywell's automation and control revenue fell 17% in the June 2009 quarter. But the U.S. has 130 million buildings and 6 billion energy-hungry devices, and retrofitting will someday provide a lot of revenue for Honeywell and for competitors like General Electric , Siemens and United Technologies ."
