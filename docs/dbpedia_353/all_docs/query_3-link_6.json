        "text": "The NOVAR 2700 power factor controller is a new high-end model built on a powerful new G3 platform with improved measurement core and extended communication options. The fast three-phase power factor controller also functions as a panel meter, data logger, and class S power quality analyzer - all in one instrument. It supports up to 24 controlled outputs, new input and output options, communication peripherals, improved fast control algorithm and offers a portfolio of communication protocols to transfer data across various networks.\n\nA SCADA system can remotely supervise and control the cabinet operation over the Ethernet or RS485 communication port. The Ethernet option offers complete native support for a web server, Modbus TCP, network management and network time protocols, and other usual network features.\n\nNOVAR 2700 can also transparently transfer its data across the networks via an existing MQTT infrastructure. Manipulation with instrument data and configurations can be restricted only to authorized users, while the PFC can optionally encrypt all its communication payload. NOVAR 2700 offers a proprietary local bus port to extend its features with supported peripherals for branch monitoring, IO modules, precise time synchronization, and other functions.\n\nNOVAR 2700 is an evolution of its NOVAR 2100, NOVAR 2200, NOVAR 2400 and NOVAR 2600 predecessors.\n\nKey features"
