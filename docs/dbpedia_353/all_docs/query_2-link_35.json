        "text": "I'm working on a project that took over a big box store that has a NOVAR lighting control system. I'd like to make some adjustments to the switching times for the lights, but I have no experience with NOVAR systems. A quick search on the interwebz said that NOVAR is a licensed system and the end user needs to purchase a license to use (or make adjustments) to their system. I'm hoping I'm wrong and that there's a simple program I can throw on my laptop and plug into the NOVAR panel and make the time adjustments.\n\nIt's a NOVAR Savvy Panel with a XCM10S controller.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA quick look at NOVAR shows me why they restrict access to their certified techs and not just anybody who thinks they can throw a program on their laptop to make some adjustments.\n\nIf indeed the system is licensed to the user then your customer needs to purchase a license to use the system and then have a NOVAR tech make the changes.\n\nETA: Another search might indicate that NOVAR isn't around anymore and a certified contractor might be hard to find. Looks like the solution is to change it out or upgrade to another system.\n\nhttps://hvac-talk.com/vbb/showthread.php?2044861-Novar-Opus-Jace&styleid=41\n\n-Hal"
