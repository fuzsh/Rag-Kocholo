Air 1 Heating was awarded the contract to design/build an HVAC system for a new airport valet parking service being constructed in Seatac, WA.\n\nAir 1 Heating is providing the complete installation of all equipment, ducting, venting, and gas piping. Air 1 Heating selected Armstrong Air gas furnaces and air conditioner and Honeywell thermostats for this project.\n\nAbout the products being used for the project:\n\nArmstrong Air A951E model Gas Furnace. Some of its features include: 95% AFUE Efficiency Rating - This means 95% of the fuel is converted into usable heat. Compared to an older furnace, this can potentially save hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. Constant Torque Motor - Like a variable speed furnace, constant torque furnaces provide lower operating costs and increases to overall system efficiency. Compared to standard PSC motors, constant torque delivers more consistent airflow and quieter operation. ENERGY STAR® Certified - The ENERGY STAR program is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy-efficient products and practices. Quiet Combustion™ Technology - Uses a smaller Btu input per burner for quieter start-up and operation while providing more even heat distribution. Advanced Heat Exchanger - Made from stainless steel for maximum strength and crimped, rather than welded, Armstrong Air heat exchangers are highly resistant to thermal fatigue and other stresses caused by repeated heating and cooling. During the testing process, they are subjected to temperatures that far exceed normal operating ranges, to ensure they will stand up to years of use. EHX™ Technology - Every Armstrong Air furnace is engineered and built with EHX Technology, a patented design that eliminates the hot spots that can shorten furnace life. EHX Technology makes heat exchangers more durable, and with its advanced airflow system, more air contacts the heat exchanger surface area for greater heat exchange, enhancing efficiency and comfort.\n\nArmstrong Air 4SCU13LB model Air Conditioner. Some of its features are: Up to 14 SEER Efficiency Rating - SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rates the energy efficiency of the cooling equipment. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficiently the unit operates, saving money on utility bills. MHT™ Technology - Armstrong Air’s proprietary heat transfer system. A specially designed fan shroud pulls air evenly throughout the air conditioner’s coil surface. The coil features rifled tubing to enhance refrigerant flow, while lanced coil fins increase surface contact between metal and air. All combine for maximum heat transfer and efficiency. High-Pressure Switch - This feature prevents operation of the cooling unit in the event that refrigerant pressures exceed safe levels, protecting the compressor. Single-Stage Scroll Compressor - A time-proven design chosen for its consistent performance, incredible durability and long operating life, the single-stage scroll compressor works hard year after year. Louvered Coil Protection - Attractive cabinet shields the coil from damaging elements like hail and debris. Louvered panels are also easier to remove, so annual maintenance can be performed quicker.\n\nArmstrong Air – Since 1928, Armstrong Air has been the smart choice for those who expect more from their heating and cooling system. Built with durable materials and incorporating brilliant technology throughout, Armstrong Air is not only the brand to trust with your home comfort, it’s also the brand more dealers would choose for themselves.
