        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Novar ES3.S functions as an executive control module in Novar Opus Magnum building control supervisor, this PopOff Pop-On design fits into XCM.10S and Savvy base-plate to provide easy migration. This document provides instructions for installing the Novar ES3.S Executive Controller into an existing base-plate, and checking the installation.\n\nFig. 1. Novar ES3.S electronics assembly and bottom cover plate are included. XCM.10S and Savvy Base-plate is currently a piece installed on site and is fully compatible with the new system (separate piece).\n\nPRECAUTIONS\n\nTake the following precautions during installation:\n\nOBSERVE NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTRICAL CODES.\n\nReduce the risk of electrical shock or fire. Do not interconnect the outputs of different Class 2 circuits.\n\nDo not rely on the Novar ES3.S as a final safety device.\n\nMake sure that the 24-VAC power wiring is connected to a dedicated transformer. No other devices (including the outputs) should be powered by the transformer connected to the Novar ES3.S\n\nDo not ground the transformer for this module on the secondary side.\n\nMake sure that the Novar ES3.S power cannot be switched off accidentally. The Novar ES3.S requires continuous power for proper operation.\n\nIf the Novar ES3.S has been provided as a replacement for an xcm.10S and Savvy Controller, the instructions in this document for wiring a Digital Outdoor Light Sensor (OLS) and/or an Outdoor Temperature Sensor (OTS) to the Novar ES3.S must be followed carefully.\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\nFig. 2. Dimensions in in. (mm).\n\nINSTALLING EXECUTIVE CONTROLLER\n\nThe Novar ES3.S Executive Controller can be mounted on the Savvy or EC base-plate when replacing an existing xcm.10S, Savvy or EC controller.\n\nNOTE: Size #2 Phillips screw driver and size 5/64 Hex wrench is required for this installation.\n\nCAUTION\n\nSome installations will require the OTS and OLS to be rewired and/or replaced. See “Wiring” section for details.\n\nMounting on Base Plate\n\nWhen removing the existing controller from the base plate, first verify that the Network Expansion Interface connectors have been unplugged. Failure to observe this caution may result in damage to the Network Expansion Interface, Network cables or both.\n\nUse the procedure below to mount the Novar ES3.S Executive Controller on the xcm.10S or Savvy base-plate.\n\nLoosen the two screws at the bottom of the Savvy or EC base-plate with the hex wrench included with the executive controller and lift off the cover.\n\nSlide the Novar ES3.S electronics assembly down from the top of the base plate assembly and over the mounting posts.\n\nGuide the DB25 and DB37 connectors on the Novar ES3.S electronics assembly over the corresponding connectors on the Savvy transition circuit board.\n\nTighten the two retaining screws with the hex wrench to secure the Novar ES3.S Executive Controller to the baseplate.\n\nConnect an Ethernet Cable to the appropriate ports.\n\nConnect Expansion networks (COM-3,5,6) to COM Expansion Interface\n\nCheck all wiring connections and replace with appropriate base-plate cover.\n\nWIRING\n\nReplacing Legacy Savvy and EC Panel\n\nOnly if the Novar ES3.S is replacing a very old Savvy panel or an EC panel, the 3 mov components on the back of the transition board (terminals 58-62) must be removed before the Novar ES3.S is installed. See Fig. 3. If is replacing an xcm.10S this will not apply.\n\nFig. 3. Mov components on back of EC transition board.\n\nLegacy Outdoor Temperature and Light Sensor\n\nIf the Savvy or EC system is using one of the 8 analog inputs for a Relative Humidity sensor, it may have been installed with an external current limiting device (#680002000) connected in series with the sensor (See Fig. 4). Unlike the Savvy or EC controller, the Novar ES3.S does not require an external current limiter for Relative Humidity sensors and should therefore be removed during the Novar ES3.S installation.\n\nFig. 4. Current limiting device.\n\nIf the site being upgraded to Novar ES3.S is currently utilizing an OTS (part # 70700000), digital light sensor (OLS) (part # 70800000) they must be replaced. The OTS (part # 70700000) must be replaced with the OTS-2 (part # 735070000) or equivalent. The OLS (part # 70800000) must be replaced with the ALS (part #’s 708100000, 708101000, 813000101) or equivalent. If wiring was done with a 30VA transformer previously, it must be replaced with a 40VA transformer (part# 730090000).\n\nOutside Light Sensor Connections\n\nThe Novar analog (4-20 mA) outdoor light sensor should be connected to the Novar ES3.S according to the following instructions.\n\nNOTE: The xcm.10S/ Savvy base-plate transition board is available in two versions. One displays the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., (UL) label at the top; the other does not. The terminals used for the Analog Light Sensor (ALS) connections differ, depending on the version of the transition board being used. Use the appropriate procedure outlined below.\n\nTransition Board – with or without UL Mark\n\nConnect the white (+) wire from the ALS to the transition board at:\n\nBoard with UL Mark: Terminal #59 (+) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections.\n\nBoard without UL Mark: Terminal #62 (+) at the Outdoor Temperature Sensor Input connections.\n\nConnect the black (-) wire from the ALS to the transition board at:\n\nBoard with UL Mark: Terminal #58 (-) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections.\n\nBoard without UL Mark: Terminal #59 (+) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections\n\nConnect the shield wire from the ALS to the transition board at Terminal #61 (Shield).\n\nVerify that the Outdoor Light Sensor current mode switch is in the enabled (on) position.\n\nOptional Universal Input Wiring\n\nIf the Outdoor Light Sensor input is to be used in the optional Universal Input configuration mode, the input wiring will be different than that used in current mode. Refer to the steps below for proper wiring.\n\nTransition Board – with or without UL Label\n\nConnect the signal wire (+) from a 0-10V source or, one terminal of a thermistor, resistive or dry contact digital type input to the transition board at\n\nBoard with UL Label: Terminal #58 (-) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections.\n\nBoard without UL Label: Terminal #59 (+) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections\n\nConnect the return or ground wire (-) from a 0-10V source or, one terminal of a thermistor, resistive or dry contact digital type input to the transition board at:\n\nBoard with UL Label: Terminal #61 (Shield) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections.\n\nBoard without UL Label: Terminal #58 (-) at the Outdoor Light Sensor Input connections\n\nVerify that the Outdoor Light Sensor current mode switch is in the disabled (off) position.\n\nOutdoor Temperature Sensor\n\nThe Novar standard OTS is not supported by the Novar ES3.S; therefore, installation of the Novar 4-20 mA Outdoor Temperature Sensor (OTS/2) with xcm.10S or Savvy retrofits will be required. Refer to the steps below for installation.\n\nConnect the white (+) wire from the sensor to the transition board at Terminal #62 (+) at the Outdoor Temperature Sensor Input connections.\n\nConnect the black (-) wire from the sensor to the transition board at Terminal #60 (-) at the Outdoor Temperature Sensor Input connections.\n\nConnect the shield wire from the sensor to the transition board at Terminal #61 (Shield).\n\nVerify that the Outdoor Temperature Sensor current mode switch is the enabled (on) position.\n\nOptional Universal Input Wiring\n\nIf the Outdoor Temperature Sensor input is to be used in the optional Universal Input configuration mode, the input wiring will be different than that used in current mode. Refer to the steps below for proper wiring.\n\nConnect the signal wire (+) from a 0-10V source or, one terminal of a thermistor, resistive or dry contact digital type input to the transition board at Terminal #60 (-) at the Outdoor Temperature Sensor Input connections.\n\nConnect the return or ground wire (-) from a 0-10V source or, one terminal of a thermistor, resistive or dry contact digital type input to the transition board at Terminal #61 (Shield) at the Outdoor Temperature Sensor Input connections.\n\nVerify that the Outdoor Temperature Sensor current mode switch is the enabled (on) position.\n\nRS485 Communications Networks\n\nLegacy modules use a different RS-485 polarity standard than Opus or generic “open” controllers, which follow the EIARS-485 standard. Refer to Table 1 and Fig. 5 to determine the correct standard used on the various Novar ES3.S network\n\ninterfaces.\n\nTable 1. Communications Table\n\nNetwork NameLocationCOM- #Wiring Polarity StandardModule NetworkBaseplate2Novar LegacyNetwork DBaseplate4Novar LegacyCOM-3Expansion Interface3Opus/EIA RS-485COM-5Expansion Interface5Opus/EIA RS-485COM-6Expansion Interface6Opus/EIA RS-485\n\nThere are not LEDs showing the transmit/ receive status of COM Port 2. The RS485 COM Port is labeled MODULE NETWORK on the transition board of the Savvy Base (Terminals 39, 40, 41).\n\nThe RS485 COM Port is labeled NETWORK “D” on the transition board of the Savvy Base (Terminals 71, 72, 73).\n\nXCM.10S/Savvay Baseplate\n\nNovar ES3.S\n\nFig. 5. Wiring Guidelines Diagram\n\nNOTE: Honeywell recommends adding a termination resistor for BACnet at the executive’s communication and terminals as well as the last module on the network. These termination resistors are required on each end of the network daisy chain.\n\nRefer to the following steps when wiring:\n\nConnect communications network wiring to remote modules using the polarity guidelines provided above.\n\nAlways use communications wire specified for EIA/TIA 485. (Novar Part Number 33201001)\n\nAlways use proper RS-485 wiring techniques (e.g. Daisy chain) when wiring remote modules.\n\nMake sure RS-485 wiring connected to the controller is routed through ducting to prevent physical access.\n\nIf the shield is to be earth grounded, tie the shield terminal to ground at the xcm.10S for Novar ES3.S and see Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for grounding.\n\nIf the expansion interface is used, secure wiring using the Wire Clamp provided on the left side of the Novar ES3.S (See Fig. 6).\n\nCHECKING INSTALLATION\n\nHardware\n\nWhen the unit has been mounted and the wiring connections have been completed, the procedure provided below can be used for the initial power up and checkout.\n\nMake sure power wiring to base-plate is ready.\n\nVerify that the unit is seated on the base correctly and that (if used) the HOA Lockout bracket has put all switches into the down (auto) position. Power will be applied upon completion of this step.\n\nVerify Ethernet cable is connected.\n\nCheck the status of the LEDs.\n\nSoftware\n\nContact your Honeywell Multisite representative for programming or additional information related to software download.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nAgency Approvals\n\nListed device: CUL/UL E90949\n\nStandards used: UL 916 5th Edition, Energy Management Equipment CSA C22.2, No. 205-17 3rd edition\n\nPower Requirements\n\nVoltage: 24 VAC, Class 2 (22 to 30 VAC), 50/60 Hz\n\nConsumption: 40 VA\n\nInput / Output Ratings\n\nAnalog Inputs: 4 to 20 mA current loop (Accuracy +/- 2% of span)\n\nNOTES:\n\nPrior to installation, verify that the existing xcm.10S or Savvy base was wired with an appropriate 24VAC 40VA Class 2 transformer.\n\n4-20mA sensors used with the analog inputs must be capable of producing 20mA with a sensor supply of 13.25V.\n\nLoop Source: 24VDC at 500mA max\n\nDigital Inputs: Contact closure only\n\nUniversal Inputs\n\nThermistor: Type 3, 10K. -10 to 135 F (-23.3 to 57.2C)\n\nVoltage: 0-10VDC, Input impedance > 5Kohms\n\nCurrent: 0-20mA (Switch selectable)Resistance: 0 – 100K Ohms\n\nDigital: Contact closure only.

Power and IO Module Status on Interface Board\n\nIndicator NameDescriptionSystem Status\n\nOff: If the Novar ES3.S has been powered for at least 10 minutes and the System Status LED fails to illuminate, this may be an indication of a system or I/O module fault. Contact Novar technical support for assistance.\n\nOn: I/O module is configured and OK and is ready for operation.\n\nOff or Blinking: If the Novar ES3.S has been powered for less than 10 minutes and the System Status LED fails to illuminate, or is blinking, the I/O module may be receiving a system update.\n\nPowerWhen lit, the green Power LED indicates that system power has been applied. If the Power LED does not light while power is applied, contact Novar for technical support.Power FaultWhen lit, the red Power Fault LED indicates that the Novar ES3.S power circuiting has detected that the AC voltage applied to the Novar ES3.S is greater than the maximum specified and has shut down. Once the Power Fault LED illuminates, power will remain off until the over voltage situation has been corrected.AC FaultWhen lit the red ‘AC Fault’ LED indicates that one side of the transformer powering the Novar ES3.S is tied to ground. Although the unit will have functionality in this condition, performance will be reduced. Therefore, the cause of the fault must be identified and corrected for proper operation.\n\nTable 4.
