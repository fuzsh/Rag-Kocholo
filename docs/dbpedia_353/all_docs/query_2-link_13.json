        "text": "The Multi-Site Manager (MSM) is an interactive, Web-based system that captures data produced by building management systems or plant equipment and processes it into energy analytics. The application analyzes the daily transfer of site energy utilization data from all sites and compiles it into an easy-to-use system, the company states. Users can review site energy consumption on a daily basis and compare a site's daily consumption over time to measure savings from corrective actions. Users can rank each site by one of nine metrics: energy usage measured in kWh/thousands of square feet, peak power measured in kW/thousands of square feet, occupied-to-unoccupied energy usage ratio, occupied site-to-profile energy usage ratio, unoccupied site-to-profile energy usage ratio, number of overrides, the site's total energy-to-peak power load factor, the site's power demand as compared to its profile, and the cost differential of operating a site relative to its profile for a given period.\n\nNovar Controls, 3333 Copley Rd., Copley, OH 44321; 800-348-1235 or 330-670-1010; 330-670-1029 (fax); info@novarcontrols.com; www.novarcontrols.com.\n\neProduct #188"
