Novar Controls Introduces Its 962 Supervisor and 915 CE Handheld: Web-Based Client/Server Software Supports Web Browsers and Microsoft CE Mobile Devices

Copley, OH - Winter 2002 - Novar Controls' Web-based client server software allows building managers to communicate with the Novar Controls' IQ Family building control system regardless if they're on the roof or half-way around the world.

The capabilities of the Novar Controls' 962 Supervisor software enables operators to use Web browsers to monitor and command system operation via the Internet or facility-wide intranets. This eliminates the need to have proprietary software installed on every workstation that is used for interacting with the Novar Controls' IQ Family. The 962 Supervisor provides a familiar and convenient method for building managers and system users to interact with the system, without vendor specific control system expertise.

Novar Controls' epiCenter, epiLoad and epiMeter: The Epitome of Savings

Novar Controls now has the ability to offer customers the opportunity and technology to integrate their controls with electrical equipment to reduce on-site installation time. This is accomplished through the epiCenter, which houses building controls and meters such as epiLoad and epiMeter, eliminating the need for separately mounted contractor and relay panels.

Novar Controls' epiCenter integrates electrical distribution, environmental control, energy management, monitoring and power quality for single- or multi-site projects. epiCenter is controlled by Novar Controls' Logic One®, Novar's energy infosystem.

epiLoad: Several Lighting Controls - One Panelboard

epiLoad lighting control equipment provides circuit protection, switching and control in the same space as a traditional panelboard, replacing the need for separately mounted or multi-pole lighting contactor and relay panels. epiLoad contains the features associated with a lighting panelboard, including remote operated circuit breakers. And thanks to its Class 2 chassis, it is designed to house Novar Controls' NCH-1000 lighting controller.

epiMeter: Software to Control Your Peak Point

By installing epiMeter software into an epiCenter, building managers have the ability to monitor and control their buildings peak demand. This can be done two ways - either by shedding loads or changing the peak point to a pre-determined alternative setpoint. epiMeter provides revenue grade information to ensure total accuracy.

Hawki® Advanced: Stand-Alone Mode Increases Control
