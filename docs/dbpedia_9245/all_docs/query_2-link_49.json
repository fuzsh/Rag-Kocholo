        "text": "The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire and of the Soviet Union However, today only Russia, Belarus and Transnistria use currencie with the same name. The ruble was the first currency in Europe to be decimalised, in 1704, when the ruble became equal to 100 kopeks. In 1992 the Soviet ruble was replaced with the Russian ruble at the rate 1 SUR = 1 RUR. In 1998 preceding the financial crisis, the Russian ruble was redenominated with the new code \"RUB\" and was exchanged at the rate of 1,000 RUR = 1 RUB."
