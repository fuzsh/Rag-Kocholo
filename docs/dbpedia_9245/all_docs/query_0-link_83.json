        "text": "Now available, original Rubles from the Soviet Union. These rubles were previously on display at the KGB Museum in New York City. They were showcased to demonstrate how the KGB used cash for operational funds.\n\nWhen the KGB museum closed in 2020 during the pandemic shutdown, all of their artifacts were auctioned off, including these rubles.\n\nThis set includes one bill each in the denominations of :\n\n1 руб\n\n3 руб\n\n5 руб\n\n10 руб\n\n25 руб\n\nThese notes are from the 1961 and 1991 issued series. All available banknotes are well worn, having passed through many hands and many transactions over the years before they made their way into the KGB museum's collection. It's hard to imagine all the ways they might have been used during the Cold War.\n\nAlthough Soviet rubles are available elsewhere, these are the only available rubles in the world with provenance from a KGB museum display. Get yours now before they're gone."
