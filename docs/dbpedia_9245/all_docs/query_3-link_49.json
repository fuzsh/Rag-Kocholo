        "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAgainst initial expectations, comprehensive sanctions did not plunge Russia into a currency crisis. Unlike other emerging market currencies during times of stress, the Russian ruble experienced a short-lived depreciation. After plummeting in the early days of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the ruble has staged a remarkable comeback and has more than doubled against the US dollar from its March slump, becoming the best-performing emerging market currency so far this year.\n\nSeveral factors explain why Russia averted a currency crisis despite the freeze of most of its central bank reserves. The current account surplus soared to a record USD58bn in the first quarter of 2022, and could climb as high as USD250bn (in the absence of a comprehensive embargo on energy exports and a sanctions-induced compression of imports). The Russian authorities also took timely countermeasures to orchestrate an “FX intervention by delegation,” including stringent capital controls, a temporary gold-fixing of the ruble and asking energy importers to switch payments to rublestogether with a steep policy rate rise to stabilize the ruble after it plummeted.\n\nHowever, the ruble’s rapid ascent might have reached a turning point and could eventually backfire. Since the ruble trades in a very thin market (and mostly domestically, given the dramatic drop in demand outside Russia due to sanctions), its recent appreciation belies a struggling domestic economy, which is expected to slump into a severe recession this year - but it has real consequences. Since most energy exports remain FX-denominated, a stronger ruble hurts the government’s budget balance by lowering the local currency value, which could be further impacted by the potential for EU tariffs on Russian energy exports during the phase-out of oil imports. Last week, the central bank responded with the third rate cut since April to tame the currency’s appreciation. Going forward, the current upward pressure on the ruble is likely to subside over time as some of the Russian countermeasures expire, Russian energy exports become less competitive and the deteriorating economic outlook begins to weigh on the FX rate.\n\nBeyond the effects on Russia’s currency, the “weaponization of finance” aimed a paralyzing Russia’s economy could also have long-lasting consequences on the global financial system. While some of the sanctions, such as the freezing of almost two-thirds of Russia’s FX reserves, were politically expeditious, they also raise questions about financial sovereignty in a strongly USD-dominated monetary system. We could reasonably see some countries start diversifying away from the US dollar and/or the Western-dominated global financial architecture over time, especially those that feel they could be targeted by sanctions at some point. Furthermore, Russia’s short-lived gold-fixing might serve as blueprint for a more serious attempt by countries that have sufficient gold reserves (or commodities exports) to depart from the current system of fiat currencies.\n\nRussia has managed to avert a currency crisis despite heavy sanctions.\n\nWhile the concept of the “weaponization of finance” is not new, it reached an unprecedented scale in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Overnight, about 55% of Russia’s USD630bn of pre-war FX reserves (Figure 1) were frozen and therefore unable to be used, leaving the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) mostly with domestically held gold reserves. In addition, the exclusion of most Russian banks from the international SWIFT payment messaging system, which was eventually broadened to also include the termination of correspondent bank relationships, made it virtually impossible for Russian banks to transact with their Western peers (Annex, Table 1). These financial sanctions were accompanied by export bans across different sectors, the blacklisting of certain supplies and targeted restrictions on economic activities by companies and individuals, including a partial embargo on energy exports. However, sanctions did not completely close Russia’s external account. Key commodities-related companies and banks were not affected by the sanctions, which has allowed the gas and oil flows to continue, but also money inflows into Russia.\n\nFigure 1: Russia - International reserves by currency (January 2022, USD bn)\n\nHow has Russia managed to avoid a currency crisis? In response to the sanctions, the Russian authorities adopted a set of mutually reinforcing counter-measures. First, they imposed stringent capital controls (adding to slowing capital outflows due to trade sanctions on imports to Russia) by asking banks, exporters and households to cede most (80% ) of their FX holdings to the CBR. The aim of “rubelizing” the current account surplus was to prevent an excessive depreciation of the ruble while building – whenever possible – FX reserves that could substitute for the frozen ones.\n\nThe CBR also more than doubled (from 8.5% to 20%) the reference policy. Faced with comprehensive sanctions, monetary tightening was needed to discourage financial outflows (not covered by existing capital controls) - rather than reining in a surge of imported inflation (by reducing aggregate demand). Unlike during the last crisis in 1998 (and compared to other central banks during currency crises in the past), the CBR responded decisively and quickly. Since then, the CBR has lowered the policy rate to 11%, with two subsequent rate cuts, the latest one on 26 May.\n\nAlthough short-lived, fixing the currency to gold provided additional support for the ruble. Russia had increased its gold reserves significantly since 2005 but stopped buying gold after Q1 2020 when the ruble weakened and the gold price soared. At the onset of the invasion, the CBR announced that it would resume its gold purchases to shore up its reserves in case monetization would be needed. However, it soon had to halt its purchases from banks, which had to satisfy increasing retail demand for gold amid a dramatically depreciating ruble. With domestic demand easing by the end of March, the CBR re-started its gold purchases from banks at a temporarily fixed price of 5,000 rubles per gram (which, at the prevailing RUBUSD exchange rate and international gold price was expensive, i.e., the fair value of the ruble in gold terms was lower; Figure 3). This arrangement (which was supposed to be in effect until end-June) was soon abandoned (on 08 April), and the price is again negotiated based on money demand. A closer analysis of Russian monetary aggregates and gold reserves suggests that it would have been challenging for the CBR to permanently install the gold-fixing of the ruble (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Russia-Gold-fixing of the exchange rate and monetary aggregates\n\nIn a complementary move to support the gold-fixing, the Russian authorities have tried to re-denominate gas exports into rubles. Since lower money demand reduces the flow of FX revenues from energy exports to the central bank, Russia required customers from unfriendly countries to directly pay for their gas imports in rubles. In combination with the gold-backing of the ruble, the measure effectively pegged Russian gas exports to the gold price. This way, the CBR could also mitigate the freeze of its foreign-held reserves due to sanctions by effectively delegating an FX intervention to banks providing rubles to energy importers.\n\nThe “rubelization” of Russian gas has likely contributed to a recovering FX rate. While the mandatory payment rule was announced in April, the exact timing remained unclear until two weeks ago. However, the announcement itself already had an immediate impact on the currency. Since reaching its trough in April, the ruble has appreciated by more than 50% against the euro, thanks to rising external demand for rubles through energy trade, and the exchange rate now stands at pre-Ukraine war levels. Note that the Russian ruble has become the best-performing currency year-to-date against the USD (+30%).\n\nMost European countries have adopted a payment solution that would allow them to meet the Russian demand without falling afoul of current financial sanctions. The current arrangement foresees hard currency payments of “unfriendly importers” being intermediated by Gazprombank (which, in turn, provides rubles to Gazprom) . The European Commission issued a recommendation last week stating that such payment would not run afoul of current restrictions if “EU operators […] make a clear statement that they consider their contractual obligations to be completed when they deposit EUR or USD with Gazprombank [rather than after the payment is converted into rubles]”. At the same time, the EU operator should seek confirmation from the Russian side that the payment is finalized as soon as the EUR / USD transfer is made; this implies also that no fee for the FX transaction is due from the EU operator (Figure 4). This way, importers steer clear of dealing in rubles, which would violate current sanctions.\n\nFigure 4: Proposed procedure by the CBR for RUB payments\n\nHowever, the first dominoes have already fallen in Russia’s gas “rubelization” gambit. Almost one month after announcing that “unfriendly” countries would have to pay for imported gas in rubles, Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on 27 April after the countries refused to agree to new payment terms. Several weeks later, on 21 May, Finland was also cut off after applying for NATO membership. Refusing countries cited concerns that the “two-accounts payment arrangement” (via Gazprombank) proposed by the Russian central bank might still run afoul of current sanctions. Nevertheless, the combination of all three measures have amounted to a de facto “FX intervention by delegation” through Russian banks, satisfying the external demand for rubles (given the constrained firepower of the CBR).\n\nCould the appreciation of the ruble backfire?\n\nThe recent ruble rally astonished financial analysts, who were speculating on further selling pressure. The ruble even strengthened briefly to 51 to the US dollar, a level last seen in 2015, having briefly slumped past 150 in early March. However, the liquidity of ruble trading has decreased dramatically, with a considerable amount of rubles changing hands at prices outside the CBR’s official ruble fixing (Figures 5 and 6). Since the ruble trades in a very thin market (and mostly domestically given the dramatic drop in demand outside Russia due to sanctions), its indicative price could be misleading and belies a struggling domestic economy, which is expected to slump into a severe recession this year. Since most energy exports remain FX-denominated, a stronger ruble hurts the government’s budget balance by lowering the local currency value. Given that the US sanctions’ carve-out of coupon payments of Russian government debt has expired, a deteriorating fiscal balance could provide incentives for Russia to default on its outstanding debt, especially given its rapidly declining dependence on international capital markets.\n\nThe CBR has stepped in to tame the recent appreciation of the ruble by loosening its monetary stance. Last Thursday, Russia’s central bank slashed its main interest rate by 3pp to 11% (down from 14%) on the back of slowing inflation. The stronger ruble has made imports cheaper, helping to keep a lid on inflation, which has begun to ease in recent weeks. Annual inflation slowed to 17.5% as of 20 May, from 17.8% in April amid a noticeable decrease in inflationary expectations. The third rate cut since early April helps further unwind the initial rate hike to 20% at the end of February to stabilize the ruble after it plummeted during the initial phase of the war in Ukraine.\n\nFigure 5: Russia – Volume of next-day settlements at official exchange rate fixing\n\nWhile the current developments are very unlikely to create near-term damage to the current USD-centric financial system (or the USD’s dominant status), they play into the narrative of a potential transition towards a different monetary regime in the long run.\n\nWhile its share in central banks’ reserve assets has been declining over the last decade, the US dollar remains by far the dominant reserve currency globally (Figure 10). As the largest and most open economy with the largest financial system, the US is the world’s foremost importer of capital (with two thirds of global assets denominated in US dollars). In addition, more than 40% of global trade is invoiced in US dollars (Figure 11). Even the euro is not a close substitute for the US dollar. Nonetheless, the emergence of China and the rapidly evolving financial system, including the digitalization of payment systems, beg the question of whether if the dominance of the US dollar and its anchoring role in the post-Bretton Woods monetary system could decline over time (Box 1).\n\nFigure 11: Financial openness"
