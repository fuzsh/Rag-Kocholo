        "text": "Topline\n\nRussia’s ruble slipped past 100 per U.S. dollar on Monday morning, a nearly 17-month low that has sparked internal discord over monetary policy as economic pressures from its ongoing war in Ukraine mount and international sanctions erode Moscow’s income streams.\n\nKey Facts\n\nContra\n\nOreshkin’s finger pointing at the central bank is a rare sign of public discord among Moscow’s governing institutions since the invasion of Ukraine began. The central bank, which hiked interest rates at a sharper rate than anticipated in July and stopped purchases of foreign currency for the rest of the year last week to shore up the ruble, offers a different explanation for the ruble’s decline, notably the country’s deteriorating trade with foreign partners. The central bank is expected to raise rates again soon.\n\nNews Peg\n\nThe ruble has been on something of a rollercoaster since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. On the back of immediate reactions to the war, it fell to record lows against the dollar before recovering to the highest levels against the greenback since 2015 and becoming one of the world’s best performing currencies. International trade conditions have been a key driver of the ruble’s value, particularly for Russia’s key energy exports. Russia is a key exporter of oil and gas and Europe, previously its main buyer, has been weaning itself off and imposing sanctions like price caps, dampening prices. These prices are rising now as oil demand soars and Moscow looks to Asia—particularly China and India—to find other buyers.\n\nFurther Reading"
