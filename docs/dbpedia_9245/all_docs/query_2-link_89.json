Russians mostly took the news in stride.\n\nThe Moscow Exchange from Thursday halted trading on several markets involving dollars and euros after the company, also known as Moex, was targeted along with its settlement depository unit under US restrictions aimed at further isolating Moscow from the international financial system over its war in Ukraine. The UK followed the US with sanctions on the exchange."
