        "text": "What Is the Russian Ruble (RUB)?\n\nThe Russian ruble (sometimes spelled rouble) is the national currency of the Russian Federation. The ruble is the second-oldest currency still in circulation, behind the British pound. It is made up of 100 kopeks.\n\nUnderstanding the Russian Ruble (RUB)\n\nThe ruble (RUB) has been used since the 13th century and has been through a number of incarnations during that time, including multiple revaluations and devaluations. The most recent changes occurred before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 and during the redenomination in 1998. The 1998 redenomination made one new ruble worth 1000 old rubles.\n\nIn recent years, the currency's exchange rate has generally tracked global commodity prices, especially oil prices, because Russia's economy heavily depends on exports of oil, natural gas, and other natural resources. The ruble collapsed in the second half of 2014, losing about half its value versus the U.S. dollar as global oil prices plunged. Economic and financial sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union on Russia in July 2014 over its invasion and annexation of Crimea also helped weaken it.\n\nThe Ruble and Geopolitics\n\nThe ruble’s exchange rate is not only affected by economic factors, but also by geopolitical events and tensions involving Russia and its neighbors. In recent years, the ruble has experienced significant volatility and depreciation due to several crises and conflicts that have strained Russia’s relations with the West and other countries.\n\nOne notable event was the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, which triggered international sanctions and condemnation from the United States, the European Union, and other countries. The sanctions targeted key sectors of the Russian economy, such as energy, finance, defense, and trade, and restricted access to foreign capital and technology. The ruble plunged to record lows against the dollar and the euro in late 2014 and early 2015, as investors fled Russian assets amid uncertainty and risk. Prior to this event, the USD/RUB exchange rate was around 30 rubles to the dollar; following the invasion it rose to 50-60 rubles to dollars, where it remained for several years.\n\nFollowing Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S., the EU, and other nations imposed another round of even stricter sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institutions and enterprises, including Russia’s central bank and energy giant Gazprom. At the same time, many Western corporations suspended or ceased doing business inside of Russia. These measures sent the value of the ruble plummeting to record lows against foreign currency, and briefly touching nearly 135 rubles to the dollar.\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine conflict has raged, the ruble settled into a trading range of around 70 to 80 RUB per USD; however, it remains volatile. For instance, in June of 2023, when the private military contractor Wagner Group mutinied and briefly marched toward Moscow, the ruble sank to 87 to the dollar — its weakest level since the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — as it revealed internal political tensions and fragility for Putin's regime.\n\nRussia's Economy\n\nRussia is more than twice as large as the contiguous 48 U.S. states and is blessed with enormous natural resources. Yet Russia’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) ranked only 11th worldwide in 2021, is only 7.72% the size of the U.S. economy. That's because Russia relies heavily on exports of natural resources, rather than higher-value-added industries. In fact, in terms of GDP, Russia trails much smaller countries, such as Italy and France.\n\nOngoing political tensions have hurt the Russian economy, as the country has repeatedly faced sanctions from the international community. The value of the ruble along with many Russian companies plummeted after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe Digital Ruble\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin announced in 2017 that the Bank of Russia would issue a Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC). Though many countries are now exploring CBDCs, Russia was one of the earliest countries to do so. In December 2021, a prototype of the digital ruble was completed and the first transfers using the digital ruble's platform were successful. The Bank of Russia announced that 12 Russian banks were ready to begin using the digital ruble.\n\nIn February 2022, many commentators suggested Russia could evade international sanctions using cryptocurrency. Though a CBDC is much different from a private cryptocurrency, a digital ruble could limit Russia's dependence on using foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Russian Ruble (RUB), among the oldest currencies still in circulation, is heavily influenced by global oil prices, considering Russia's key role as an exporter of oil and natural gas. The Ruble has witnessed multiple transformations since its inception in the 13th century, with the latest changes occurring due to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 and the redenomination in 1998. Geopolitical events, particularly Russia's conflicts with Ukraine and the sanctions imposed from various nations, have played substantial roles in devaluing the Ruble's exchange rate. Despite the tumultuous economic climate, Russia has pioneered in the digital currency space with the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency. The Bank of Russia maintains control over the Ruble's value through various monetary policy tools."
