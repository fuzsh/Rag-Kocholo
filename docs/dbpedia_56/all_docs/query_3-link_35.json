Completed, it will consist of 54 parts, machined and ground with precision. It will hold the quartz \"heart\" of a Collins transmitter which will beat millions of times per second. Final accuracy will be within five parts in a million. In every department of the 40,000 square feet of Collins' plant similar highly specialized technical Jobs are being done. Unique, in¬ genious, painstaking, this work is responsible for the wide acceptance of Collins equipment. Collins Radio Company/ Cedar Rapids, Iowa ADVANCED ENGINEERING ORGANIZATION today can hope to maintain an engineering staff that, in itself, can lead in all the modern radio developments. The Halli- crafters' engineers are as competent and capable as any, but even they do not rely entirely upon their own resources. The finest brains of radio science have contributed to the design of Hailicrafters receivers as the list of over 200 patents under which Hailicrafters receivers are licensed will testify. Look for the license tags on the chassis of any receiver you purchase, they are your guarantee of advanced design, of medern engineering.

The new 20 to 40 me. range in this latest model is the result of painstaking research and engineering, and is not just a casual makeshift! Two steps of R.F. amplification are used in this range as well as in the remaining four ranges from 20 down to 1.25 me. This provides an image rejection ratio of 150 to 1, and a sensitivity of 0.8 micro-volt (30% modu¬ lated) with a signal-to-noise ratio of 6 to 1 at 28 me.! The 2000 kilocycle span on the 28 to 30 me. band is covered by 90 degrees of the band spread dial. Tuning is so arranged that all amateur bands fall in the center of the scale as the band switch is turned. All the other popular features that contribute to the success of the standard 15 to 560 meter \"Super- Pro\" also have been retained in this model, viz.— direct tuning, accurately calibrated 3 to 16 kc. band¬ width panel'control, graduated audio and sensitivity controls, calibrated beat-oscillator control, 8 metal and 8 glass tubes, stand-by switch, AVC-manual switch, C.W.-mod. switch, phone-speaker switch, rugged self-contained tuning unit with trouble-free cam operated knife switch, variable crystal filter, etc. Complete details on this model and the standard model appear in a special booklet.

It is an incorporated association without capital stock, chartered under the laws of Connecticut. Its afi'airs are governed by a Board of Directors, elected every two years by the general membership. The officers are elected or appointed by the Directors. The League is non-commercial and no one commer¬ cially engaged in the manufacture, sale or rental of radio apparatus is eligible to membership on its board. \"Of, by and for the amateur,\" it numbers within its ranks practically every worth-while ama¬ teur in the nation and has a history of glorious achieve¬ ment as the standard-bearer in amateur affairs. Inquiries regarding membership are solicited. A bona fide interest in amateur radio is the only essential qualification; ownership of a transmitting station and knowledge of the code are not prereq¬ uisite. Correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary. HIRAM PERCY MAXIM, FOUNDER OFFICERS President .Eugene C. Woodruee, W8CMP State College, Pa. Vice-President .GEORGE W. BAILEY, WlKH Weston, Mass.

Address all general correspondence to the adminis¬ trative headquarters at West Hartford, Connecticut 8 THE MILL AS ONE result of the great floods early this year, the Federal Communications Com¬ mission has sent two investigators into the area to study emergency communication requirements and is now to receive a report from them which, rumor says, will recommend a complete national disaster communication system involving both wire and radio. What aids or what dangers such a program may offer to amateur radio it is too early to say, but in any event the subject is impor¬ tant. We hope that all concerned will bear in mind that amateur radio’s important contributions to emergency communication are not susceptible to regimentation. In the first place, the very par¬ ticipation of an amatem: is voluntary. In the sec¬ ond place, our unique ability to serve derives primarily from our vast numbers, the fact that there will always be some of us in position to help. An emergency is, by nature, an unpredictable thing, and it will never be devoid of confusion. Improvements can be made, of course, and we believe in broad-gauge advance planning, but any attempt to detail specifications of what stations will handle what classes of traffic for whom is doomed to failure and would choke off our per¬ formance ability in a tangle of red tape. Better confusion and duplication than that precious relief be endangered by paper rules. The amatem’s aid in the recent emergency was a mighty one. We are proud of our fellows. We find pride, too, in the weight of this demonstra¬ tion of the widsom of the national policy of en¬ couraging amateur radio. We do not propose to lose those advantages by having amateur radio subordinated to any other agency in time of emer¬ gency. We can do the job better alone and that is how we want to do it. The very greatness of our performance early this year now attracts many agencies who would like to commandeer, direct, liave assigned, and so on. Let them xmderstand that this service conies/rom us, of our own voli¬ tion as free agents. We shall want to help them all as much as we can, but of our own accord, not by direction. There are important improvements that need to be made in our planning and co¬ ordinating but they are interior problems of ama¬ teur radio, and the job is to be done only by us amateurs within our own structure. ^OMES April and the realization that the ^ A.R.R.L. Board of Directors will soon be meeting. All members with new ideas or sugges¬ tions for the solution of current problems or for the betterment of amateiu radio should com¬ municate with their division directors, 'f he ad¬ dresses are in the directory in each issue of QST. A.R.R.L. decisions are made by divisions and each director wishes to know how his “gang” feels about the questions of the day. although QST is now a landmark in ama- teur radio, it still depends upon advertising support to pay the printer. It is doing a swell job for its advertisers but it is just as important for our members nowadays to mention QST in writ¬ ing advertisers as it was in the old days. There is, we suppose, a temptation not to do this these days, simply because QST is now an institution, sort of like the telephone company, which nobody ever bothers to credit. Membership cooperation —mutual support—^has built this great journal of the American shack. Let’s keep it up, fellows: “Say you saw it in QST —it identifies you and helps QST.” '^HERB is not so great an occupancy of the upper half of the 28- to 30-Mc. band as we would like to see. Other people may be making bedroom eyes at those frequencies. Moreover, interference, particularly at week-end, is getting pretty tough. Obviously we ought to spread out. The ’phone stations can’t spread out, being as¬ signed only half the band, so the move ought to come on the part of the o.w. stations. We suppose the heavy population in the low-frequency half derives from the use of crystals primarily used in lower bands. That’s a small consideration in com¬ parison with the advantages of a clear frequency. What do you say, you 10-meter c.w. fellows— how’s to spread out a bit, get out from imder the ’phone carriers, and give that upper-frequency half some needed population? K. B. w. April, 1937 9 The Maxim Memorial Relay T his event, held on February 17th, on the first anniversary of the passing of our founder, Hiram Percy Maxim, was most successful. It parallels in its magnitude of success the A.R.R.L. 20th Anniversary Relay held three years ago. The League’s Official Broadcasting Stations and Official Phone Stations each trans¬ mitted President Woodruff’s commemorative message each hour, between 7 and 11 p.m. local time, on the evening of the 17th, the stations covering the entire country. At this writing radiograms are stUl coming in, and many hundred acknowledgments of reception have been re¬ ceived. A commemorative card signed by our A.R.R.L. president is being mailed to each in¬ dividual who took part in the relay, in apprecia¬ tion of the amateur spirit shown on this occasion! The Connecticut station line-up for receiving relayed messages functioned admirably. Outside of the Headquarters station, the Connecticut operators receiving most messages were WIHSX (C.W.); WISZ (3.9-and 14-Mc. ’phone); WIHSX (c.w.) and WIIMV (1.7 Me.). At WlAW a 30- hour watch was kept. Chief Operator Hal Bubb taking the bulk of the operating, shifts being taken by Don, and FH. Members sending and rela 3 dng e-Kpress themselves as enthusiastic for having the relay made an annual event. In the future we might make the commemoration an “opening season” activity, starting on the 1938 date (September) nearest that of the birthday of our foimder. Connecticut stations were ready for even a greater volume of traffic than developed, and the Nutmeg gang covered every band thoroughly for the whole period of the relay. Three score stations on the dehvery end received the special acknowledging messages sent to A.R.R.L. The League is grateful to the valuable assistance rendered by all Connecticut operators in this relay. The deliveries, except for 50 miscel¬ laneous mailed messages, were made by these stations as follows: CONNECTICUT STATION REPORTS 3.5-7-14-Mo. telegraph: WlAW * 106; WIHSX 30; WIBDI 31; WIIKB 29; WlAFB 27; WIGMB 17; WIJPE 13; WIES 12; WIKV11; WIFE WIITIWIJMY 10; WIGVV WIIYB WITD 9; WlCSC WIJXP 8; WIGKM WIJUD 6; WIBIH WIFAJ WIUE 5; WIBHM WIGC WIHPI WIIBT WIJHN WIJXV WIKAY WITS 4; WICEJ WIFIY WIGYT WIIGR 3; WIBNB WIDMP WIINP WIJJL WIKBJ WINI 2; WIBFS WIBGJ WIBUE WICJZ WlCUH WIDF WIFKQ WIGCX WIHKF WIJBS WIJOR WIJTX WIJXR 1.

We would like to list the calls of every ham who sent a message, but it would take more space than possible here. One message of special interest came from Michigan’s governor (via W8GJK), the text as follow’s: ’Tt is a pleasure to pay tribute to the memory of Hiram Percy Maxim. The organization he formed and sponsored is deserving of congratulations and commendation on this aimiversary. Its splendid accomplishments are universally respected.”—Frank Murphy, Governor, State of Michigan. In addition to the relay aspects of this com¬ memorative activity, the program was a test of the coverage of these field organization stations both individually and as a group. Of course not aU the listeners reached sent acknowledgments, but the coverage indicated is most satisfactory. Re¬ sults of course depend on the number of transmis¬ sions made, the frequencies and power used, the time employed in the caU to “collect an audience” and the like. The fact that some stations worked in “extra” transmissions, and that one station known to have sent the message on schedule five times received no reports at all indicate a condi¬ tion of “competition” between stations transnoit- ting—the louder stations or those best situated in the band perhaps producing the acknowledg¬ ments. At any rate, the list of reports on stations is here presented as a factual accoimt of results as compiled from the messages received: TRANSMITTING STATION REPORTS 3.5-Mo. telegraph: WlAW 136; W8AQ 24; WIBDI N8DME 19; WSAAX 14: W9IGZ 9; W3BWT 6; W2AZV ,5; WIBVR W5FZJ W8HWT W8JQE W9HPQ W90EL 4; W3CKL W5DAQ W9BNT 3; VB3KM WIFPS W2ENZ W3BZ W6FBW W9HVO 2; VEIHH VE3PL WlASI WIBVF WIEEY WIFFL W6LFE W7EMT W8AQS W8EEQ N8HPA W9IAW W9RVW W9SUE 1. 7-Mc. telegraph; WlAW 34; W80FN 10; W30DQ W9NUF 8; W9BYV W9KEI 3; W3BGD 2; W8AFE W9BYS 1. 14-Mc. telegraph: WlAW 11; W9CWW 2; W9DEI 1. 28-Mc. telegraph: W9GTO 1. 1.8-Mc. ’phone: W8IAI 44; WIIDY 4; W2ECO W2HFB W8DGL 3; VE3AHK W2IDZ W8GJM 2; WICEA WIGZL W5DAD W6LFZ W6LPE W8FIP 1. .3.9-Mc. ’phone: WISZ 27; W8LUQ 15; W2CBO W2DC 10; W8CKC 8; WlAPK 7; VB2HT 6; VE3KM 5; W8JFC 4; WIHKK W8HFR 3; W2ACB W3EZ W4DGU W5BHO W8LIG WSLIQ 2; WIDWP WIEAO W2CBD W4QI W6ELW WaETX W7FET W8DKP W9BDT W9RNX W9WC 1. 14-Mo.

Since the activity was aU carried on progressively through one evening in making the president’s message known, {CorUinwd on page 98) 10 QST for ''In the Public Interest, Convenience and Necessity\" A Detailed Account of the Amateur Emergency Work In the Flooded Ohio River Valley: January 21st—February 5th By Clinton B. DeSoto* On the desk before me lies a pile of noteSf reports^ letters, clippings easily ten inches high. Hundreds of indi' viduals have contributed to that file, each telling a story of high significance. Reduced to type, compiled into detailed manuscript form, this material tvould fill a dozen ordinary books—each crammed with epic achieve¬ ment and the warm, tense excitement of great deeds done against difficult odds. It is the complete record of the amateur radio emergency work during the January Ohio River Valley flood. Prom this incredible mass of data I have endeavored, in the follotving account, to distill the details of major significance and fit them into the general picture of the emergency as a whole. Obviously, the summary of so great a work in limited space Tniue be sketchy and brief. The activity as a whole has, however, I think, been circumscribed, if not completely covered. Every effort has been made to include the call of every amateur station participating —and every operator, as ivell, for the cooperative spirit displayed by those who left their own stations idle to help in manning that of another was one of the finest features of the ivork. . . . But an end to tributes* Let us content ourselves with facts. They are, indeed, enough. T o RADIO, sunspots bring DX; to most of the Unitod States they brought a winterless winter. To the Ohio River Valley they brought rain. OS in the North Atlantic, Uke a giant, invisible Zeppelin, a slowly-moving circular air mass stalled. Stationary, it held in abnormal static fixation a train of other moving air currents that covered northern United States. Under the moisture-laden tropic air above the Ohio Valley crept a cold polar air-front, precipitating a deluge of endless rain. Through most of the month of .January the torrential downpour continued—falling at the average rate of nearly an inch a day in places. Water covered the countryside, running water covering the face of the earth, running down to reach rushing rivers, drowning out the very rivers themselves. Sixty billion tons of water—a mass too great for the human mind to measure, a force too great for mankind to control—-gathered in the tribmt^ * Assistant Secretary, A.K.R.L. HIGH WATER . . . rios of the Ohio and then roiled slowly, relentlessly down the great river. Hour by hour, in savage crescendo, the crisis grew. State after state found its toes dipped in muddy yellow water that crept inexorably upward. One by one the old records were eclipsed—the while human minds, stultified by the overpowering horror of it all, strove vainly to anticipate calamity’s end. Tolls of death and damage mounted higher and higher, until at the end there were himdreds upon hundreds dead, a million and a quarter homeless, property damage approaching a billion dollars.^ nation’s geeatest flood catastrophe It was the greatest emergency since the World War, said Admiral Cary T. Grayson, Red Cross head. I No complete official figures on death tolls exist; with censored “official” figures for Louisville—where for local reasons the true figures will never be known—the total is in the neighborhood of 400. The Red Cross reports 750,000 refugees in their c^re, a total of * 250,000 homeless. Pub¬ lished property damage figures Td entirely nebulous, there being no adequate method of computation and aggregation. , . . LEAVES DESOLATION II April, 1937 To say that is to make superfluous the state¬ ment that amateur radio, in providing emergency relief commimications, made the greatest con¬ tribution to public service in its history. Bkom one end of the Ohio to the other, and along much of the Mississippi, existing com¬ munications systems were either broken down entirely or severely overloaded. From almost the beginning it was essential that radio step in. And from the very beginning radio amateurs were on LEFT TO RIGHT: C. H. HOFFMAN, JR., WSHD, R. B. CREIGHTON, NDE-W8ALI, .AND WM. W. LAMB, W8CXR, ALL OF WHEELING, AT NDE- W8AAO the job, adding a helping hand wherever it was needed. Through the early part of the week of January 17th the waters rose steadily. By the 20th the probability of a communications emergency became apparent. The next day the threat of a major flood became literal and a general mobiliza¬ tion began, with Eed Cross, Coast Guard, American Legion, Army and other units preparing to aid civil authorities. That day—January 2lBt—the two amateur military affiliates, the A.A.R.S. and N.C.R., were ordered into continuous active duty. At the same time, A.R.R.L. Communications Manager Handy dhocted the S.C.M.’s of eleven states to proceed with the organization of emergency nets in all affected areas. The West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee state traffic nets were placed on active duty, new recruits added at strategic points. Throughout the region informally-organized emergency networks swung spontaneously into action—the 4-Mc. ’phone net for the IJ. S. Army Engineers, the Northwest and the East Coast IBO-meter emergency nets, and others. Where organized nets did not exist groups of stations cleared through central clearing stations, as on the 75-meter ’phone band through W8YX. That night emergency traffic started to flow through the various organized nets in appreciable quantities. The work of lining up these other nets generated endless conversation. The bands began to fill with flood talk to overflowing. Through the weekend the pressure rose. Every station in the United States, it seemed, was on asking, “Can I help in the emergency?” It was bedlam. On the “clear-channel” c.w. nets the traffic was forced through, although even they had their troubles. But desultory amateur work—especially on the ’phone bands—was often hopelessly jammed. Pleas for coSperation by the F.C.C. and the League abated the QRM some¬ what, but not enough. Drastic action was required. It was taken on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 26th. The Commission, after a telephonic conference with League officials, issued the now historic “F.C.C. ban”* on all but emergency amateur operation below 4000 kc. A picked corps of sixty amateur stations was chosen by the A.R.R.L. Communications Department to broad¬ cast the band and thereafter to serve as “vigi¬ lantes” in “piping down” offending stations and policing the bands. INTEBPEBENCB ABATED BY P.C.C BAN .Almost immediately the QRM was cleared up, reported the beleaguered stations in the flooded zones. In a half hour it was largely dissipated ; by nine o’clock that evening it was non-existent— except perhaps among the large number of emergency 160-meter stations iocated right in the valle.v, and occasionaily on 75-meter ’phone. But by and large, the consensus of opinion goes, every channel was a clear channel, every contact “100 TOE OPERATING PO.SITION AT WIM/WSGZ, WITH WINDY ON WATCH per cent.” Even the Canadian amateurs co¬ operated wholeheartedly, responding to the seven- times broadcast plea of Canadian General Manager Reid. From that time on until the emergency was officially declared over, on February 5th, amateur radio provided a service of incalculable value to » Actual text of the F.C.C. order; “To aE amateur li- ceneees: The Federal Communications Com mi ssion has been advised that the only contact with many flooded areas is by amateur radio, and since it is of vital importance that communication with flooded areas be handled ex¬ peditiously, IT IS ORDERED that no transmissions except those relating to relief work or other emergencies be made within any of the authorized amateur bands below 4000 kilocycles until the Commission determines that the present emergency no longer exists. By the Commission: John B Reynolds, Acting Secretary.’* 12 QST for every official agency participating in the relief and rescue work. It is believed that some five hundred stations were active in the primary emergency zone (representing the affected states) , manned by more than a thousand amateur operators, and that as many again stood more or less constant watch throughout the country aiding or waiting to aid in the relaying and dispatch of the emergency traffic. It is believed that perhaps 100,000 mes- .sages of an official nature were handled by these sta¬ tions during the emergency period. It is believed that, almost without e.’cception, every city and village and rural community along the Ohio River received greater or less benefit from this amateur work. What these prosaic figures add up to in terms of lives saved or suffering averted none can say. Certain it is that death tolls now mun- bered in hundreds would have been in thousands had it not been for radio ama¬ teurs, that hundreds of thousands of the million and a quarter homeless would have experienced additional agonies of starvation or ill¬ ness or mental turmoil had it not been for their work. Have you ever seen a man die? Have you ever seen a child suffer in torment? Multiply these by a thousandfold and you will begin to grasp the use of amateur radio. We speak of amateur radio—but not in the sense that amateur radio alone served in the Ohio River Valley floods, or even that amateurs as individuals deserve credit far exceeding anyone else. It was a work of aU Radio, with all services— military, broadcasting, police, Coast Guard, amateur—commingled into one whole, a sur¬ prisingly-unified whole. All types of stations worked each other, sometimes invading each other’s frequency bands. There is no way of isolating credit or blame for the work performed, for aU worked together, toward the same ends— brothers in the democracy of common need. No, all that was done we cannot claim for amateur radio. But this we can claim for amateur radio: that again it was the great reservoir of trained per- sormel from which all services drew, for behind the operation of practically every piece of radio equipment of whatever origin participating in the emergency we find a licensed amateur—and that again it has been proved that through amateur radio all other radio in this country finds being. And that is glory and to spare. Pennsylvania: The January, 1937, floods took over where the March, 1936, floods left off. Pittsburgh last year experienced the greatest debacle in its history, bearing the brunt of the waters from the flooded Conemaugh, Allegheny and Monongahela rivers—the bottle-neck through which Pennsylvania flood waters drained off into the Ohio. But this was an Ohio River Valley flood, and Pittsburgh was located pre¬ cisely at its source. High water being a cumulative affair, Pittsburgh this year barely got its toes wet. Such communications emergency as existed was due to over¬ loading of existing facilities and the difficulty of main¬ taining contact down the river. Within the scope of this limited need Pittsburgh ama¬ teurs performed successfully. The most important activity was the organization of a 7.5-meter ’phone network, extended by other stations down the entire Ohio Valley, on behalf of the IJ. S. Army Engineers. Key station for the Pittsburgh office in this set-up was Gilroy M. Barker, W8PX. He was linked to the 5-meter station at the Engineers’ office in the Federal Building—W8BBV, operated by Harmon W. Armstrong assisted by W8BGJ— by a 160-meter relay through L. G. Fabian, W8GJM. Theodore Fabian aided in the operation of W8GJM. The Engineers’ network was of the highest value. A considerable quantity of official traffic was handled via W8BBV-W8GJM-W8PX {W8PX also used the call WYDO on 4035 kc. c.w.) to W8CXR and W8YX, providing the engineers with required information on flood stages, etc., which enabled them to evacuate various communities before the water reached dangerous levels. Hourly river reports were transmitted for the period from January 20th through January 26th. Charles Affelder, W8HLM, and Henry E. Schurman, W8DJE, also aided in the Army Engineers’ network, as well as handling Red Cross traffic with W8YX as key station. W8DJE, where Stewart Dixon, Louis Luchardt and Ed Lips were assistant operators, secured flood reports from a river transportation company. Both stations used 4-Mc. ’phone. Henry Wicken- hiser, W8KWA, and W. K. Thomas, W8QAN, also participated in the Pittsbiugh work, on c.w. Elsewhere in Pennsylvania a large number of WM. R. HODGES, W8MOL. HUNTING. TON, WAS A MAJOR LINK IN THE U. S. ARMY ENGINEERS’ CHAIN April, 1937 13 stations were active, so great a number in fact that space limitations prevent individual descrip¬ tions of their work. The following calls have been noted, asterisks indicating apparently better- than-average work while the numbers show the wavelength-bands used: W3ADE 80, W3ADM 80, coordinated Trunk Lines A, C and E for the period of the emergency. The Wheeling station in the U. S. Army Engineer's network was W8CXR, T.^meter 'phone operated by Wm. W. Lamb, relieved by W8BTV. Three-quarters of the traffic handled during 56 hours watch was W3ADN 80, \\V3AKB 80, W3AMD 80, W3BES (W3DMQ,W3CHH,W3AGV, W3KT, W3ENX, W3FLH, W3DRJ, W3COZ)* 80-40, W3BFZ 76, N3CHL 80, W3ECA 80, W3EOP/ WLQB* 80, W3ETM/ WLQF 80, W3FFX 80, W3FXZ 80, W3NP* 75-80, W30K/ WLQA 80, W3QV 7.5-80, W31TA (W3ART)* 75-20, W3ZN (W3EMR) 80, W8BHN* 75, W8BRC* 75, W8BWH 75, W8CHT 75-20, W8CMP 80, W8FLA/ WLQC* SO. W8HHO 80, W8HTX 80, W8INE* .SO, W8IXC 75, WSKUNt 80, W8LMY* 75, W8LYK 80, for the Engineers, the rest mostly Red Cross. A groat deal of information on river conditions, instructions, etc., was transmitted on regular schedule. Down the river the crisis grew more severe. The city of Parkersburg, with perhaps a quarter of its 30,000 inhab¬ itants homeless, was Isolated. To its aid went Herbert V. Romine, W8GDF, of West Milford, who hurriedly as¬ sembled several transmitters —consisting of 45 tubes as oscillators modulated by other 45’s—from a service¬ man’s parts stock, and estab¬ lished stations on fire boats W8NDE 80, W80FO* 80, HAROLD a. sturm. wsptj, in the located in that city. This and W8UR 76. N.C-R. net at Huntington work unquestionably saved West Virginia; a number of lives. Returning home, WSGDF secured his own transmitter and Down from Pittsburgh the yellow water rolled. West Virginia and Ohio creeks and rivers added to the volume with a record 9.41-inch rainfall during January. At XVheeling the river remained above flood stage for a fuU week. Wheeling Island, South and Bast Wheeling, were almost entirely evacuated— 20,000 homeless, a third of the city inundated. Even so, damage did not compare with last year’s flood, for the crest was seven feet lower, the current not nearly so swift. More than that, people were prepared, willing to accept any warning, however fantastic. They had had their lesson just ten months before. . . . The communications emergency resulted only from overloading of wire systems, for these re¬ mained largelyin tac t. But there was plenty of oppor¬ tunity for Wheeling hams to serve—and they did. At Wheeling Courthouse the N.C.R. station, NDE/iS8AAO, was operated by Ensign A. B. Creighton, N8ADI, Ensign R. W. LaUy, N8AAO, and Radioman G. A. Prostinak, N8LBI, assisted by other non-amateur Naval Reservists. A total watch of 181 hours was maintained, 161J4 hours of it continuous, handling Coast Guard, iVrmy and Naval Reserve communications, with a message total of 416. C. S. HoSman, W8HD, operated in the highly- effleient West Virginia State O.R.S.-A.A.R.S. net for 100 hours or more, handling Red Cross, A.R.R.L. official, and personal traffic. He also transported it back to Parkersburg, setting up and operating from WPAR. Several times he had to dismantle ids station and move it by boat as the water climbed relentlessly higher. Throe miles from Parkersburg, at the trans¬ mitter budding of WPAR, Ray Spence, W8BRE, using an emergency 160-metor rig, worked into a net composed of Marietta, Ohio, amateur sta¬ tions. Naval Reserve communications at Parkers¬ burg were provided by Ensign E’. D. Masters, W8DNN, using the tactical call CE5C. Elsewhere in West Virginia tributaries of the Ohio bulged with the abnormal rainfall and pro¬ duced subsidiary emergencies. At Leon, W. Va., on the Kanawha, Clarence A. Casto, W8JJA, was the sole means of communication for that isolated community. Off the air for nearly three years, he hurriediy assembled emergency apparatus that enabled him to contact W8LII. He’s coming back into the game now! At Point Pleasant, W. Va., whore the Kanawha joins the Ohio, the entire business section was under water and all communications lost. I’rom West Charleston came Corporal Wm. B. Stone, W8MAO, with a portable rig using 35 watts on e.w., 26 on ’phone, with which he notified author¬ ities at Charleston via W8DMF, resulting in the early dispatch via airplane of medical supplies. For two days this station provided communica¬ tions for the Army, Red Cross, West Virginia National Guard, State Police, and State Board QST for of Health, the Army Engineers, Coast Guard, American Legion, WPA, telephone ompany, and others. When Corporal Stone was called back to Charleston, John A. Kramer, W8LS, also of Charleston, took over. Sent on a relief survey by boat for the Red Cross, he had taken along his transmitter and receiver. Finding them badly needed, he stayed, set up on the judge’s bench in the courtroom, and aided in the direction of relief communications handling 260 messages. W8JTW, on the other hand, who wont into the city with emergency gear, was ordered out by local authorities. .Although not flooded. Charleston was the major refugee center of the state, and the ama¬ teurs there performed an emergency communica¬ tions job deserving of mention. In this city W8CZ, although himself partially ilisabled, provided invaluable Red Cross contact. WSIRV and W8PM A assisted him. At the fixed station of W8MAO, located in the Armory, W8DMF handled quantities of relief traffic for various official bodies. W8PQQ relayed flood traffic on 7-Mc.; W8JQP guarded the T.'i-meter ’phone band. WSKYJ, also aided in the emergency work, as did W8PTX, 160, and W80BA, 80. It was in the 100 miles from Parkersburg to Huntington that the January flood transformed itself from just another flood into the country’s major natural cataclysm of all time. 'From there on, the Ohio was a vast inland sea full of foam and mud and debris, an engine of death and destruc¬ tion systematically and relent¬ lessly scourging everything in a path often ten miles or more wide. Faced with an emergency of the first magnitude, Huntington ama¬ teurs came through in typical ham st>le. Functioning in the uniformly effective Army Engineer’s net¬ work was W8MOL, operated on 4-Mc. ’phone by Wm. R. Hodges and XYI;, assisted continuously by W8AHF. in 198 hours of operation 784 messages were handled, two-thirds for the Engi¬ neer’s (their river telephone lines were broken, although other wire systemsintoHuntingtonremained intact), the r&st being Red Cross, American Legion, police and about 100 personal messages. This does not coimt 1600 additional contacts involving official information. An active N.C.R. station was W8EZR, owned by F. D. Reynolds, who, as the flood waters engulfed his home, moved his equipment to the telephone building and, aided by W'8BDI5, operated there imtil an accident beyond their controi rendered the equipment inoperative. Meanwhile they handled 886 messages, provided weather reports and aided the telephone company to maintain contacts with branch offices. Radio¬ man Harold F. Sturm, N8PTJ, first handled personals in the ham bands, then Red Cross and Engineers’ traffic. Water threatening his home, with the aid of W8DUO he moved his rig to the City Hall, where it was taken over and manned by the Coast Guard for two days. Lieut. Ramey, N8PSR, operated in the A. A.R. S., W. Va., and N.C.R. networks at times, although his principal job, as Communications Officer of Units 2 and 4, was in coordinating local communi¬ cations activities, as well as organizing bhnker systems in cooperation with the State Police for use in isolated sections. Out in Guyandotte, completely inundated suburb of Huntington, T. E. Bobbitt, WSHIX, was the sole communications link after telephone service went out. He operated on c.w. continu¬ ously for some days, handling 336 messages even though under a physician’s care with influenza, serving the police and Coast Guard with vital information. Arthur Wolf, W8DGZ, trav¬ eled to Huntington from WiUiam- son and set up a station at American Legion headquarters there, scheduling G. K. Ball, W80FG, at Williamson, for the purpose of enabling the Legion to control dispatches of men and supplies for relief work, as well as directing transportation of refugees. Active also in Huntington, untU overcome by influenza, was George H. Gunnoe, Jr., W8MEK. R. W. Nixon, W8BDD, and Wm. .1. Parker, W80IC, built a 160- meter ’phone rig which was used for police patrol work; WSWK’s ’phone was used for the same purpose. W80IC was also active at his own station, as were Lee F. Lister. W8MQF, and Wm. C. Toney, W8MZT, 160-’phone. Throughout West Virginia other amateurs were on at all hours of the day and night, many of them working in the West Virginia State net. This net is a combination A.A.R.S.-A.R.R.L. net, working as an Army miit Monday nights and as an O.R.S. group the rest of the week. W8KKG/WLHP, Dr. W. H. Riheldaffer, S.C.M. for the state, heads it. The other stations were. W8CFB/WLHF, W8MCL/ WLHQ, W8AKQ, W8LII, and W8NAU, as well as those previously mentioned. FROM THIS ROOF JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, JR., W8MRU, AND HIS F.AMILY BOARDED A COAST GUARD BOAT AFTER OPERATING HIS EMERGENCY STATION UNTIL WATER AL¬ MOST REACHED THE CEIL¬ ING OF THE LOWER FLOOR (WATER IE:VEL MARK IS VISIBLE) April, 1937 15 W8BOK, 75, W8ATT,. 160-80, W8DMU, W8PNE, W8QJS, W8ELO, and W8LXF, com¬ plete the roster of West Virginia amateurs recorded as active in the ernergency. Ohio: Rivers have no gratitude. To the state to which it owes its name the Ohio River last January brought holocaust and destruction, smashing first the 1913 record, then topping the disastrous flood of 1884. First warning of the emergency came to Marietta amateurs on Sunday, January 23rd, when they discovered that telephone service to Pittsburgh had been cut off by the rising waters. Receiving a plea for aid via 160-meter ’phone from W8BBE, located at the WPAR transmitter across the river, H. F. Babb, W80IL, lined up a network in which Carl J. Anderson, W8VZ, handled local and out of town messages, while Charles Clarke. W8KWZ, W80IL and W8KyC, the Marietta Amateur Radio Society’s station .operated by club members, handled local traffic. To flooded Gallipolis (tell this to O. O. McIn¬ tyre) went Rod Meany, W8JTW, with his emergency gear, after officials had ordered him out of Point Pleasant. Operating at the sheriff’s office in the county jail, Gallipolis, assisted by George Bovie, he handled the city’s emergency traffic on 75-meter ’phone. All along the river the water rose. Past Hun¬ tington, at Ironton, on the Ohio side, W8EUN carried on with relief communications until the high water drove him from his home. Then the National Guard station, PG, took over. TAKING IT EASY AFTER ELEVEN DAYS’ WATCH, RICHARD WRIGHTSEL, WSKYQ, PORTSMOUTH, IS SEEN WITH HIS EMERGENCY LAYOUT Further on, at Wheelersburg, Russell W. Banks W8PGL, aided by W8PFT, provided the only contact for a community, cut off for a full week after the flood crisis. Operating on 75-meter ’phone at times from a 32-volt converter powered with banks of freely-contributed automobile batteries, this station secured all supplies and aid for the flooded commxmities of Wheelersburg, Allen Township and Soiotoville. Warning was also given lower cities of thousands of gallons of gasoline which filmed the river water forming a gigantic fire hazard. Just down the river, at New Boston, Ohio, Clyde Meadows, W8NSV, 1920-kc. ’phone and WSPGL, WHEELERSBURG, SOLE MEANS OF COM- MUNICATION FOR SEVERAL ISOLATED COM 1 MUNITIES Standingf Russell BankSf WSPGL; seated, Joe Price, ^ WSPi^, relief operator, Wm.

Portsmouth—“the city of refugees’’—bore the s maximum brunt of the flood. Thinking themselves * safe behind their 62-ft. levee, the citizens watched the Scioto, tributary of the Ohio, rise until it ^ became a vast mile-wide lake. With sudden dis- \"t may they realized their vaunted sea-wall would 5 not save them. Sewage gates in lower sections were opened, with the hope of saving the rest of C the city. But the water rose interminably, !( covering their levee waist-deep in swirling i yellow water. 1 Thousands of people had to be evacuated— !( instantly. Telephone service was largely out. ' Only radio remained. From January 21st through February 4th a W8DQM was on the air on 3950 kc. 24 hours a day, except for four hours in which the station, threatened by high water, was moved. It was manned by Vernon C. and Glenn Warnock and W8KVP. A total of 2376 written messages was handled, not coimting large quantities of orally- relayed information. The station’s principal activity was in the Army Engineer’s network, but it regularly scheduled a dozen other stations and tied in with half a dozen local agencies, providing a strikingly effective local network. . H. E. Saylor, W8DHD, assisted by W8BTB and Harold Price, operated on 14 Mo. as emer¬ gency police station when the regular equipment failed, rebroadcast on 2430 kc. by John P. Bauer, W8CCS. Many marooned persons were saved through this operation. In addition to'working into the local amateur network, calls were also semt to receivers at boat landings, health and 16 QST for safety notices broadcast to the public, etc. A total of 2800 messages were handled in eight days of continuous operation. Richard Wrightsel, W8KYQ, aided by .lack Augustine, operated throughout about the same period as WSDQM, handling most of WSPGL’s traffic from Wheelersburg. Through WPAY, the cooperative Portsmouth broadcaster, delivery of local traffic from the amateur stations was greatly expedited. WSKYQ’s message total approximated 500. Operating on behalf of the Ohio National Guard in Portsmouth was Joseph B. Kennedy, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI’S W8YX IN ACTION Jr., W8MRU. He used battery power at his home imtil water almost touched the first floor ceiling, whereupon the Coast Guard transferred his gear to the Pranklin Avenue M. E. Chinch Tower. There he carried on. At times when power was off W8MRU was the only station operating in Portsmouth. The steamer ILS.S. Kentucky, stationed at Portsmouth for a time, which operated under the calls WZBA and W8MGR, was operated by Cincinnati hams—WSMC^, W80DU, W8PBE. Down the river at (Believe It or Not) Ripley, Ohio, completely isolated, an unusual com¬ munications set-up operating under the call W8FKX comprised the old 160-meter transmitter of Charles W. Boyd, ex-W8EGTJ, and the receiver from a portable station brought into the region by T. Ross Liming, W8LCK, at the request of the Ohio State Highway Radio patrol. R. W. Bloss, W8KFX, owner of the oaU, operated the station. Combined with this, a Western Union office and a temporary Bell Telephone exchange were set up at the same location, Boyd’s home (where tradi¬ tion has it Eliza of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” found refuge after crossing the ice). Outside of Paducah, the devastation at Ports¬ mouth was probably more complete than in any other of the larger cities along the river. But many smaller commimities were almost entirely wiped out. One of these was New Richmond, to which with emergency equipment went Eugene W. Klein, W8UW/WLHI/FX, from Batavia. Working in the National Guard and A.A.R.B. nets from New Richmond hill and later at Bethel, he assisted in dispatching rescue boats and supplies, and also warned of escaping gas tanks on the river. These floating gas tanks brought alarm to Cincinnati, but it was a small fear barely pene¬ trating the numbness that followed the rise of the river to 70, 74, then 79 feet. Safe on its hills, Cincinnati proper tried to absorb 66,000 homeless, watched the water rise to depths of 20 ft. in the streets along “The Bottoms,” wondered where it would end. No matter where it would end, W8YX, the amateur station of the University of Cincinnati was prepared. Faced with a possible loss of power. Prof. Wi C. Osterbroek, Chief Operator C. E. Grinstead, W8LNK, and Richard E. Walker, W8BRQ, connected up two 15-kva. tractor- driven alternators and waited, l^ut the power did not fail. Meantime, secure on high ground, the staff of 15 operators served for 15 days as the central traffic-clearing station in the 4-Mc. ’phone band for the entire flood zone. Messages totaUing 2139 were handled, 90% of them official. Regular schedules were maintained with 36 stations, with innumerable additional contacts, nearly a dozen receivers were used to continually monitor various bands, including 56 Me., 7 Me., A.A.R.S. and 3.6-4 Me. amateur channels, 160 meters and the b.c. band. Key station in the U. S. Army Engineer’s net¬ work for the entire lower valley was W8FIC, THE EMERGENCY POWER EQUIPMENT SET UP AT WSYX, CINCINNATI The McCormick-Deerinz tractor drove two IS-kva. alternators* operated by Roger A. Burrus, assisted by Walter Wilks, W8NMS. W8NUP, W8AEH, W8JFC, W8EDX, W8FHW, W9FS, W8NLQ also operated. This station controlled the proceedings of various river boats used by the Engineers, as well as contacting the other amateur stations in the network on schedule. April, 1937 17 W8MGD, operated by Corporal Geo. E. Cively, Corporal Ray Murphy and Private Howard Goodrich, assisted by Lieut. George B. Hart, was the National Guard station in Cincinnati, operated at the Freeman Ave. Armory. Among other feats, this station assisted in the evacuation of 2100 refugees from New Richmond. The Cincinnati N.C.R. unit was, of course, on the job for the entire period of the emergency. At NEG/W8NC, three operators and one officer under the command of Section Commander Lieut. Elmer H. Schubert, W8ALW, were constantly on duty. At the Naval Reserve Armory other opera¬ tors manned stations WSALW-WSCCT and NEGl, while on the motor launch U.S.S. Winifred W8DSR and NEGA were operated on 3555 kc. and 60 Me. Finally, Lieut. Sdiubert used a Navy portable under the call AX9B on a motor launch on the river for fom days. Other Cincinnati amateurs were effectively active. Jacob W. Schott, W8FGX/WLHR, handled Red Cross and poUce traffic, working in the A.A.R.S. network. Nicholas M. Glaug, W8NMR, pinch-hit in the National Guard net at times, handled some personals including one for fllmactor Robert Montgomery, and aided gen¬ erally. J. W. Klotter, W8LPD, operated on 160- meter ’phone, as did James W. Ringland, W8JIN, Ivan L. Heavey, W8MGN, and Wm. Thren, W8FN, at Cheviot. In Connection with Army Engineers activity, there is to be listed Harry S. Gantz, W8QMN, Paul Fisher, W8LOD, andLeonard Ball, WSOH, all of whom operated on the U.S.S. Scioto: and John M. Hohman, W8MGR, Chris C. Pfitzer, W9ELL. LOUISVILLE. OPERATED BY BOB LA. VIELLE ON 7S-METER ’PHONE UNTIL POWER FAILED W80DU, and Glenn Walker, W8PBE, who operated on the U.S.S. Kentucky. A number of imidentifiod 60-Me. stations per¬ formed useful local service in the Cincinnati area for the Red Cross. WSFAT' was established as a base for this work in the center of the city. At Columbus, the state capital and also the center of the Ohio radio networks, amateur radio activity naturally reached a high point. Loren G. Windom, W8GZ/W8ZG/WLH, who is Chief Radio Aide of the A.A.R.S., served as N.C.S. during the emergency and boro a heavy load of responsibility. His own message total of 801 was made up very largely of government and Red Cross traffic. He was relieved as N.C.S. by Dana THE OPERATING POSITION AT W9AVH, LOUIS¬ VILLE The station tvas poivered hy tioo sasoline-driven generators for the duration of the flood. A. Young, W8BBH/WLHA of Columbus—who handled 270 messages—as woH as by W8AFZ/ WLHY, W8UW/WLHI, aided at times by W8JC/WLHN, W8CMI/WLHH, and W8CIO/ WLHC. W8LEK, operated by Charles K. Walker, W8HXQ, W8FXN, W8FYS, W8HHU, W8NPF and W80VB, had a message total of 847 on 7.5-metcr ’phono. Cooperating with the National Guard and other relief agencies, as well as broad¬ caster WHKC, this station centralized emergency communications in general for the State of Ohio. The Ohio National Guard control station at Columbus, which operated under the call AB, u,sed amateur frequencies and equipment and was manned by amateur operators. Working both c.w. and ’phone, a toW of 450 messages were handled bv W8IJV, W8IZQ, W8P.TN, W8.1BI, W8JHE, W8LPN and W8ISK/WLHO. W8CKG and W8VE were also associated with the w'ork of the station. Also active on 75 meters in Columbus were W8EQ,V and W80VB. On 160 meters there were W8BBH-80,’ W8IMB, W8BPE, W8HAM, W8NBO and W8()LO. W8BBH and W81MB were on 80. James D.

Kentuckyi The Ohio River, they say, is a thousand miles long. For more than half its length it provides the northern border of the sovereign State of Kentucky. Kentuckians often believe no good can come’from the North. Last January they may have had reason for the thought, for in their half of the Ohio it roused to peak fury—leaving behind more than 300,000 homeless, hun¬ dreds dead, and property damage of many milhons. Defying havoc-dealing Na¬ ture, a few-score radio ama¬ teurs occupied front-line trenches in the defensive battle in which the nation joined. Near Ashland the Ohio leaves West Virginia, joins Kentucky. So badly hit was this region that for a time supplies were dehvered by parachutes dropped from airplanes which flew down from Columbus by request at frequent intervals N9HNV, on 75-Mc. ’phone, was the Ashland link in the U. S. Engineer’s network, as well as guarding N.C.R. frequencies and serving the Red Cross, National Guard, etc. It was operated by J. Lyrm Rhodemyre, aided by W9BEW and N.C.R. Unit personnel including W9GAQ, W9.IDI, W9WUR, Ed Carr and Ray Glancy. All Red Cross suppHes from Columbus—delivered by airplane—were ordered through this station, and all relief traffic along the river between Ashland and Portsmouth through W8DQM. On 160 meters Harry J. Harris, W9WXL, re¬ lieved at times by W9WTJR, performed a wide variety of services, including a relay through W8NYY to Dayton requesting the parachute de¬ liveries mentioned above. Working W9TXC, this station was for a time the principal relay point for official Louisville traffic. WfiJDI and W9TKO, both on 160, also aided in the Ashland work, as did Ernest V. Herrider, W9VYY. Ehner G. Leachman, in addition to relief opera¬ tion at other Ashland stations and hitches at WCMI, operated his ownstation, W9BEW, in the A.A.R.S. 75-meter ’phone net which stretched from Huntington to Cincinnati, as well as 3810. Continuing along the Kentucky shore, beyond .Portsmouth at MaysvUle, E. S. Young, W9AEN, and J. E. Manion, W9YHD, provided emergency commrmications facihties, not only for Maysville but many sur-rounding communities. W9AEN, on 75-meter ’phone, transmitted urgent Red Cross traffic to Washington; aided by Leshe Bennett and George Yazell, W9AEN served as pohee radio and local broadcast station, as well as for the Na¬ tional Guard, Coast Guard, etc. W9YHD, on 160, han¬ dled some official and much personal traffic, including files of messages for Western Union. On the Kentucky side of the river near Cinciimati, to be mentioned are Bejt Brown, WOPS, who operated his own station on 80 at Newport for the Red Cross with a direct line to Cin¬ cinnati until power failed and then stood watches at W8PIC, and Albert M. Barnes, W9EDQ/WLHT, who operated in the Ken¬ tucky State and A.A.R.S. nets from a special power line to the City Building in Ludlow after being flooded out of his home, handhng nearly 500 messages with the aid of W9TLZ and George HiU, ex-Navy op, and W9NAR. Control station of the Kentucky Net, he handled mostly Red Cross and police stuff, maintaining close contact with police. IN DRIVING SLEET, THE TEMPER- ATURE 12- ABOVE ZERO, W9MWC STARTS OUT WITH HIS RADIO GEAR ACROSS A TREACHEROUS MILE OF SWIFT WATER IN HIS HEROIC AT- TEMPT TO REACH SHAWNEETOWN April, 1937 19 Remember the dramatic newspaper stories of the tense scenes at Frankfort, as 1500 families took to the hills when the state capital flooded and the 2900 panic-struck prisoners in Frankfort Reformatory revolted? Well, it was an amateur group associated with a broadcast crew that pro¬ vided Frankfort—and the Governor of Kentucky and his staff—with emergency communications. Providing the Kentucky Net’s principal contact with Frankfort was Carl A. Newman, W9AZY, sent from Louisville. Undaunted by power failure, he set up an emergency rig built from an old con¬ denser tester, and that buzz saw carried the traffic of the Governor and Adjutant-GeneraL Realizing Frankfort’s desperate state, on the 23rd Henry Hah, W9MGT, D. B. Farmer, W9MWR, and Asa Adkins, W9VBO, along with Sanford Holt, chief engineer of WLAP, set out from Lexington with emergency equipment. An 8 -meter b.c. pick-up unit was set up at the relief chairman’s office in the courthouse; two miles away, in the State Capitol, W9MGT operated on 4-Me. ’phone and in the Kentucky net. After an initial period of operation in Frankfort, W9MWR returned to man his own station at Lexington, working in the Kentucky net, aided by W9CRJ, W9IFM and E. L. Darsey. On January 22nd WHAS, LouisviUe, broadcast the information that Carrohton, Ky., pop. 2500, half-way between Cincinnati and Ixjuisvihe, was isolated, added a plea for an amateur to go there with emergency equipment. W. 0. Bryant, W9NKD, answered the cah and thereupon be¬ came one of the flood’s ham heroes. Aided b.y Charles Carter and Eugene Moore, W9NKD was met by boat, set up his gear, and for ten days was the only communication means available to the Army, Coast Guard, Red Cross, and the mayor of Carrollton. ’Phone on 75 and 160 was used, with 20 watts power. Best performance: Getting ambulances for emergency operations from Madison, Ind. (via WSYX); average time, 30 minutes. The toll of the flood in Louisville will never be known. The horror of those days and nights will never be told. Even the full record of the amateur radio emergency work in Louisville will never be estab¬ lished. . . . Hundreds dead, 230,000 homeless, disease, fire—a river crest of 56.9 feet, everything within the city limits flooded, water two to six feet deep in all the principal streets—power gone, homes flooded, yet dozens of radio amateurs carry on, somehow, someway. . . . It was all too big—too big to be visualized, even believed. The early loss of power at Louisvflle created a situation whereby there were many operators available, few stations in commission. Some form of coSperative organization was patently essen¬ tial. By mutual agreement, general responsibiUty in this direction was assigned to Lieut. W. B. R. LaVieUe, N.C.R., who until power failure had maintained consistent watches on the 75-meter ’phone band under his amateur call, W9ELL. Aided by L. N. Whitfield, he there handled 187 messages in the Kentucky, N.C.R. and ’phone nets. After power failed, from his office at the airport he directed and co6rdinated the operation of the half-dbzen Louisville stations with self- ROBERT T.

Using battery power and later two gasoline generators shipp^ from Chicago for use at W9ELL but inadequate to handle the kw. ’phone load, G. W. Mossbarger, W9AUH, carried on after power failure to handle 443 messages, work¬ ing in the KYN and N.C.R. As Kentucky’s S.C.M., his was also the job of coordinating state¬ wide communications, with special emphasis on the Kentucky net. On with battery power immediately after power failure, and later with a gasoline-driven a.c. generator, W9FQQ, operated by John M. Gates, Jr., W9HZL and W4DDZ/9, provided a consistent 80-meter traffic outlet. Of the 318 mes¬ sages handled, a third were in connection '.with WHAS, a third for official agencies, and a third personals. WHAS characterized the work as “of Inestimable value.’’ Operating on 75 and 160-meter ’phone, Glen Cook, W9TXC, with W9LZS and W9UXT reUev- ing, used emergency power from a Delco 32-volt plant driven in by W9LZS over 160 miles, which in turn operated two 32-v.d.c. to 110-v.a.c. gener¬ ators—with an S8 background of hash! A total of 274 messages were handled, many of vital im¬ portance. On January 30th the transmitter was pressed into service to replace the defimct Louis¬ viUe poKce radio station, being remotely-con- troUed from the City HaU five miles away. Robert C.

Rhombic Systems with Steerage Control to Suit Transmission Conditions By Morton E. Moore,* W6AUX, and F. L. Johnson,** W6CNX I T HAS been shown by E. Bruce and A. G, Beck' of the Bell Telephone Laboratories that by altering the physical shape of a rhombic or diamond antenna, the radiation pat¬ tern of the antenna in the vertical plane may be changed, the effect being to rotate the radiation pattern through a limited region in the vertical plane, without essentially altering the horizontal pattern. An antenna so designed that its con¬ figuration may be altered is said to have “Steer¬ age Control.” In other words, its vertical radiation may be steered at will. To take advantage of this, the supporting poles are set back some distance from the apexes of the wires in order that the physical shape of the antenna may be changed by adjusting the halyards. Provision should be made for altering the distance between the end apexes by at least 10%. The antenna systems ® used in the tests to be described consisted of two horizontal rhombic antennas (more commonly known as diamonds), operated on 14 Me., each 334 wavelengths on a side, approximately a wavelength above ground, and terminated in their characteristic impedance.

The two antennas were di¬ rected along great circle paths, one being aimed westward at South Africa, the other being aimed north by northeast to Europe. Each antenna was supported on four sixty-five foot poles, and fed by a 600-ohm two-wire open transmission line, the feed line for the South African radiator being some 350 feet in length. Since, when correctly terminated, a horizontal rhombic antenna of the dimensions of the ones employed presents an impedance of slightly less than 800 ohms at the sending end, if the antenna is connected directly to a standard 600-ohm feed line a mismatch of impedance will result. This will in no way affect the performance of the antenna for transmission. FIG. 2—VERTICAL RADIATION PATTERN OF THE HORIZONTAL RHOMBIC ANTENNA Heijght, length and tilt angle are the same as in Fig* 1» Only the major lobe is shotvn, though it will introduce standing waves on the feeders. For reception, however, reflection at the sending end of the antenna will ensue. The mag¬ nitude of these effects is slight and for most pur¬ poses may be forgotten. K one desires to establish perfect conditions for one frequency, an imped¬ ance transformer consisting of a quarter-wave¬ length transmission line (“Q” matching system) should be installed. The surge impedance of the matching transformer is given by and will be greater than that of the feed line (Zs) and less than that of the antenna {Zn). The one employed by the authors consisted of No. 12 wires on 12-inoh spacers. Aside from the terminating impedance, the construction of the diamond is simplicity itself. The terminating impedance should have the properties of a pure resistance and should possess the ability to dissipate energies ranging from a few microwatts up to several hundred watts, without change of impedance, in order that the antenna may be used both for transmission and reception without change of characteristics. April, 1937 21 These limitations remove from consideration such terminating devices as incandescent lamps, because of their temperature coefficient of re¬ sistance; and wire wound resistors, because of their very appreciable inductive reactance at high radio frequencies. The ideal terminating impedance would consist of a bank of large carbon resistors, large enough to ffissipate several hundred watts without heat¬ ing. A value of ^ about 780 ohms will be found satisfac- \\ ^ tOry in most cases Une^ Xfarmery ^ for the terminating —-- impedance, although after checking this may have to be al- tered. At the time of construction, such resistors were not available, and a cheap,practical substitute was sought. The prob¬ lem has been solved by commercial communica¬ tion companies by the use of transmission Hnes constructed of iron wire, shorted at the end, and extending a distance of several thousand feet from the antenna. But such a line was not feasible in this case. It is understood, of course, that the pur¬ pose of the terminating impedance is to dissipate the energy which would otherwise be reflected back along the antenna. This will be treated in more detail later. To terminate the antennas, open wire trans¬ mission lines of 783 ohms surge impedance were constructed employing No. 2.5 nichrome wire spaced 6 inches, the resistance of the line dissipat¬ ing the energy. To simulate an infinite line, the lines were terminated in 785 ohms of carbon resistors at a ^ ^ point 200 feet from the antenna, ™ the energy level at the end of the x, line having been determined to u, „ be of the order of 60 watts with '| full 1-kw. power input to the ^ antenna. The phase angle of the ,0 line, as determined from the ' o _ equation \" ' J antenna is shown in the graph of Fig. 4. In the course of changing the terminating impedance, it was noted that the radiation pattern of the antenna in the vertical plane was materially affected by these changes. This observation was made with the South Airican antenna, which had been in use some three weeks, and with which //kfirame line Cffrhon Resistors H was found to be approximately 3 degrees. Hence the line could be considered as presenting a pure resistance to the antenna. It is now possible to obtain suitable carbon resistors ® for this purpose, which might be incorporated into the antenna in the last few feet at the far end, thus obviating the necessity for a dissipating line.

Upon changing the terminating imped¬ ance to its correct value, we were unable to con¬ tact any South African stations in the following two days, and it was reasoned that the radiation pattern had been altered by this change. We then changed the physical shape of the antenna so as to raise its radiation pattern in the vertical plane. This was done by elongating the antenna, and the following morning we contacted five South Afri¬ can stations with S9 reports from all of them. It vras also noted that the back end reception had dropped considerably. With these observations as a basis, we set upon a systematic survey of the results to be ob¬ tained by raising and lowering the radiation pattern in the vertical plane. Tests were con¬ ducted with numerous stations in both South Africa and Europe -over a period of more than four w WAVELENGTHS^ mouths. The procedure was first to set the antenna at an adjust¬ s' ment which had given consistent ENGTHS resuits m the past. Upon con¬ tacting a station, the radiation pattern in the vertical plane then was lowered to its position of lowest angle radiation and gradu¬ ally raised during the course of the test until it was in the position of highest angle radiation possible with the set-up used. With but few exceptions the results showed that: 1. At the lowest angle of radiation the signals were either entirely absent or extremely weak at the receiving end. 22 QST for fhifM above ground = 6B' iengthof sides = 214' Objects marhsd Ware Counter weights Pu/iegs P, should have 6“sheaves ana good fric tioniess beas-ings Same fbrpuHegs Pi except that friction less hearings are not absolutely essential. 4- Z.

The vertical pat¬ terns of the antennas employed were not sharp enough for an exact de¬ termination, but the re¬ sults did show that the two are contained in a fairly narrow region, al¬ though not necessarily the same. Upon correlat¬ ing the residts of the ob¬ servations we arrived at the following conclusions; 1. That, just as for reception, so likewise for transmission there is an optimum angle in the vertical plane. 2. That the optimum angles for transmission FIG. 5—CONSTRUCTIONAL DIAGRAM OF THE 14-MC. RHOMBIC ANTENNAS WITH MECHANI¬ CAL ARRANGEMENT TO VARY THE TILT ANGLE FOR STEERAGE CONTROL IN THE VERTICAL . PLANE 2. That upon reaching a certain definite critical angle in the vertical plane the signals suddenly increased in strengh to S9. 3. That as the radiation pattern was raised still further the signals remained practically constant for some time and then gradually fell off in strength. This is exactly what would he expected if the region of useful transmission were confined to a very limited, region in the vertical plane, when studying the phenomena with an antenna which possesses a sharp cut-off on the top side of the radiation pattern and a broad cut-ofi on the under side, as is the case for the antennas used. The tests indicated that on 14 Me. the useful region of transmission was under 25 degrees and for 7 Me. under 40 degrees, above the horizon, which confirms the observations of other ob¬ servers. Under abnormal conditions exceptions were noted in that there were apparently several paths of transmission. These conditions were almost always characterized by very noticeable fading and echo at the receiving end. Messrs. Bruce and Beck ^ have demonstrated that there is an optimum vertical angle for re¬ ception, and at times when there are several paths from transmitter to receiver, by employing an¬ tennas of high vertical directivity, signals from some paths might be sharply discriminated against, and fading reduced, if the vertical pattern THE “TROLLEY” DEVICE FOR DETECTING UN- . BALANCE AND STANDING WAVES ON THE FEEDER AND TERMINATING LINES, AS DE¬ SCRIBED IN THE TEXT and reception are close together although not necessarily coinciding. .3. That there is, under normal conditions, but April, 1937 23 a very limited region in the vertical plane in which useful radiation takes place, and that energy directed into any other region in the vertical plane is largely wasted. 4. That the optimum angle of transmission changes from time to time with changes of season and conditions, but that there is no material change within a given short interval of time. 5. That controlled directivity in the vertical plane is relatively more important than directiv¬ ity in the horizontal plane. Inasmuch as the vertical pattern of the an¬ tennas used has a vertical spread of some 15 degrees, it was impossible to determine definitely the optimum vertical angle. An accurate de¬ termination could be made only by an antenna which has a vertical spread of a very few degrees; but the fact that a definite optimum region was observed with an antenna the pattern of which was not confined to a very limited region in the vertical plane lends considerable emphasis to the conclusions. The results are quantitative only since none of the observers used calibrated equipment. NOTES ON CONSTBUCTION AND ADJUSTMENT In the course of the experimental work it was found that a mismatch of terminating impedance caused considerable back-end radiation and re¬ ception to ensue. One of the beauties of this antenna is the absence of back end radiation and reception. The authors derived no small amount of pleasure from contacting South African sta¬ tions the west way aroimd without interference from stations in the U.S.A. The authors wish to bring once again to the attention of amateurs the fact that, except for most unusual conditions, signal propagation follows the great circle route. In laying- out the great circle routes and de¬ termining the necessary spread of coverage in the horizontal plane to cover South Africa and Eu¬ rope, a small geographical globe fitted with an encircling metal band, as shown by the photo¬ graphic illustration, was foimd to be of inestima¬ ble value. The band is pivoted at two points, one at the home location, and the other at its anti¬ podes. Swinging the band through any given point on the globe automatically lays out the great circle comse to the given point. A SMALL GLOBE FITTED WITH A METAL BAND PIVOTED AT THE TRANSMITTING POINT IS HANDY FOR LOCATING GREAT-CIRCLE PATHS In the sketch of Fig. 5 is shown the mechanical method of varying the angle of tilt of the antenna. The control rope may be run right into the oper¬ ating room, if desired, or the winch may be mounted at the base of the mast. The authors used the manual method of control. Since the vertical pattern, of this par¬ ticular antenna is quite broad, there is no necessity to make provision for a nmn- ber of fine adjustments of the angle, and therefore there is no particular ad¬ vantage in installing a motor driven winch. K a much larger antenna with a corre¬ spondingly narrower vertical pattern were constructed, then the motor driven winch with its continuously vari¬ able settings would be ideal. With the antenna used here two or three settings were suliicient to insme ad¬ justing the vertical pattern to the correct angle.

You will aU remember the high Cana¬ dian score of 23,431 points, made by VE4QZ, and the high U. S. A. score of 15,120 made by WIBPT in last year’s contest. All U. S. A. amateurs are extended a ve^ cordial invitation to join with the VE boys in this fast stepping week-end contest. This will give many W’s a chance to work all VE districts and it will also give the VE’s a chance to grab off the last few States needed for W. A. S. The Canadian General Manager, Mr. Alex Reid, VE2BE, has heartily endorsed this contest, which is sponsored by the Queen City Amatem: Radio Club of Toronto, with the following committee in charge: Mr. Gordon Coleman, Mr. George Cooper, VE3ACI, and Mr. Fred H. B. Saxon, \\rE3SG. Logs should be mailed to the chairman of the committee, Mr. Fred H. B. Saxon, 302 Lee Ave., Toronto, Ont., not later than midnight, April 30, 1937. Here are the simple rules: Dates: Starts—Friday, April 16th, 6 p.m. local time. Ends—Sunday, April 18th, midnight, local time. Duration: 54 hours. Frequencies: Any or all amateur bands may be used. Object: Each VE will work as many W stations as possible, in as many United States A.R.R.L. sections (see list page 5, QST) as possible. Each W will work as many VE stations in as many VE sections as possible. Scoring: The same log form as used for the Sweepstakes contest will be used. (See page 31, Nov. 1936 QST). Message preambles will be exchanged. Each preamble sent will count one point and each one received will count one point. It is not necessary for preambles to be exchanged both ways before a contact may count, but one must be sent or received before credit is claimed. All preambles must be handled under approved A.R.R.L. pro¬ cedure. Mark each new section as worked. Standard mess^e preambles will be used; the Check portion will consist of the EST report of the station worked. Sample preamble: NR 1 VE3QK CK 599 Windsor Ont 7:05 P Apr. 17. W stations multiply number of points by number of VE sections worked and multiply final score by nine (there beir® nine times as many U. S. A. sections). VE stations multiply number of points by number of U. S. A., A.R.R.L. sections worked. Power and Operator Handicap: Each station using less than 50 watts input to the final stage may multiply the score by IJ^. If there is more than one operator at a station, the score of the highest operator will be the score for the station. Prizes: A.R.R.L. certificates of merit wiE be awarded to the leader in each of the 69 A.R.R.L. sections in U. S. A. (and possessions) and Canada. In addition, member companies of the Radio Manufacturers Association in Canada are donating prizes for the highest scoring Canadian stations. Canadian Marconi Ltd. is donating a cup to be known as The Marconi Trophy. Canadian Westinghouse Ltd., Canadian General Electric Ltd., and R.A.C.-Victor Ltd. have made donations of splendid prizes and are hereby publicly thanked for their interest in amatem: radio. The Contest Committee members will not be eligible for prizes, but may aid W stations in obtaining a higher score.

League held a routme meetmg at L-ommittee headquarters on January SOth under the chairmanship of President Woodruff, with all the officers in attendance. Eight clubs were affiliated and three conventions approved. The Board meeting was called for May 7th. The administration of the Hiram Percy Maxim Me¬ morial Award was accepted on behalf of the League. The Committee adopted recommenda¬ tions to the directors for improvements in the regulations governing the eligibility of candidates for director and S.C.M. Several I.A.R.U. matters were passed upon. Walter Stiles, Jr., W8DPY, was named as the A.R.R.L. nominee for the C.B.S. Award for 1936. During the floods of March, 1936, Mr. Stiles transported emergency radio equipment, after tremendous hardships, a distance of more than fifty miles to Renovo, Pa., and gave a brilliant amateur performance in seeming essential relief aid for that city when no other means of communication existed. C C I R John C. Stadler, \\nE2AP of pf ' * ‘ Montreal, and James J. Lamb, 1 tans QST’s technical editor, representa¬ tives of the International Amateur Radio Union to the fourth meeting of the C.C.I.R. at Bucarest, are busy these days with their studies. The Union has submitted several technical contributions to the preparatory work, and in recent weeks the documents of the conference have been issued in considerable profusion. Mr. Stadler recently spent several days at West Hartford, going over plans at the headquarters. They sail from New York on May 4th, accompanying the U. S. delegation. En route Bucarest, they will visit in Berlin for a few days as the guests of the D. A.S.D., and upon returning they plan similar stops in Dsndon and other cities as may be possible, pro¬ viding not only admirable amateur contact but an insight into recent technical work in those coun¬ tries.

The figures on amateur stations are those previously reported in QST, a total of 46,850, compared with 45,561 the year before, a gain of 1289 or 2.8%. During the fiscal year, 11,164 amateur applicants took the code test before examiners, 8687 passing, 22% failing. The written examination was administered to 11,850 candidates, 9190 passing, again 22% fail¬ ing. This figure for failures is an average, dividing 21 % for Class A, 23% for Class B, 22% for Class C, and 24% for abridged examinations under Rules 405-6. An interesting paragraph, significant of the constant world-wide growth of radio, appears in the comments of the Telegraph Section on general aOocation matters: “During the past year many new assignments were made to stations in all parts of the world, and the problem of finding adequate space in the needed portions of the spectrum for the United States was more difficult than at any time before. To show the tremen¬ dously rapid growth in the use of radio frequen¬ cies during the last few years, a comparison with the original international frequency list estab¬ lished by the Berne Bureau in December 1928 is illuminating. In the original list of December 1928 a total of approximately 1700 stations were listed. Five years later the number of stations was approximately 17,000 or a 10-fold increase. A rough check of the latest list dated March 1936 shows a total of 25,000 stations. These figures are for stations at fixed locations and do not include ship, aircraft, amateur, and portable stations.’’ Kansas State Convention (Midwest Division) Wichita, Kansas, April 17th--18th ATTENTION GANG! The Wichita Amateur Radio Club has a responsibility this year in being the sponsors for the regular Kansas State Convention which will be held at the Hotel Lassen, Wichita, Kansas, on April 17th and 18th. A cordial invitation is extended to all A.R.R.L. members and radio amateurs in this state as well as all adjoining states. The program will be most interesting with unusual features such as a dem¬ onstration of two-way police radio by the Wichita Police Department, demonstration and lecture by a large airline radio engineer, NCR and AARS meetings, etc. The co mmi ttee has made it possible for those attending to enjoy themselves fully and the regis¬ tration fee is ONLY $1.98; it \\yill cover two meals (one a swell banquet).

April, 1937 27 A New LF» Coupling System for Superhet Receivers An Efficient Electro-Mechanical Filter Transformer of High Selectivity By James J. Lamb* I N RECENT years QST has chronicled a number of significant developments in i.f coupling systems .which have contributed to the constant improvement of our superhet re¬ ceivers. The inevitable trend of these develop¬ ments has been toward the ideal in adaptable selectivity; that is, toward selectivity that can be instantly and exactly fitted to the particular re¬ quirement of the type of signal and the receiving conditions of the moment. In amateur communi¬ cation this means selectivity ranging from the 6-fcc. order of bandwidth for ’phone to less than 100-cycle width for o.w. telegraph. In practice, modern high-selectivity tuned transformers in a two-stage i.f. system give us selectivity approxi¬ mating the 6-kc. order, along with all the gain that can be used; and quartz crystal filters intro¬ duced into these i.f. systems obtain the c.w ex¬ treme at the other end of the selectivity scale. Moreover, variable-selectivity transformer sys¬ tems allow us to broaden the bandwidth in a range greater than the 6-ko. order; and the variable selectivity crystal filter gives us a con¬ trollable range of from less than 100 cycles up to a kilocycle or so of bandwidth at the higher extreme. But between these two lies an extremely useful mid- selectivity range which is not reached, on the one hand, with our current transformer-coupled sys¬ tems at their sharpest; nor, on the other hand, with our present crystal filters at their broadest. Practical utilization of this inter¬ mediate selectivity range is an ac¬ complishment now made possible by a new type of electro-mechani- ed transformer-filter which is the culmination o"
