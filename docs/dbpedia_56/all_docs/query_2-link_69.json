        "text": "Our Sixth Form prepares young men and women for future study and employment, combining academic excellence with guidance on applying to university, a rich careers programme, a plethora of extra-curricular activities, and strong pastoral support.\n\nWe are exceptionally proud of our Sixth Form and our amazing students. Our A Level Results Day 2023 saw around Over a 1/3 of students have secured places at Russell Group or top 10 ranked UK Universities, and they will complete their studies in subjects ranging from Medicine to Theoretical Physics, and from Law to Geography. A record number of students will start degree courses at universities from Edinburgh to Exeter. Other students hold places on competitive and prestigious degree apprenticeships. Staff at Palace Street are immensely proud of all these students have accomplished throughout their two years especially as this was the first time having the experience of opening public examination results.\n\nWithin our Sixth Form, you'll enjoy more freedom and independence than your previous years in education but our supportive learning environment means you will be guided by highly skilled teachers in small classes, whilst our pastoral support and extra-curricular activities help you develop into confident and independent young men and women. Our facilities include a state-of-the-art Sixth Form study suite and common room, with outdoor space.\n\nOur central London location places you in the heart of the capital, within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. This ensures you can go beyond your A Level subjects by attending workshops or lectures with business leaders, participating in conferences or research programmes at top universities or simply visiting the many museums, galleries, theatres, exhibitions and more that are found across London.\n\nOur location has also helped us build strong links with nearby organisations, like Polar Capital, an investment company near our Sixth Form. Thanks to generous funding from Polar Capital, our sixth formers will benefit from a fantastic suite of further support. All students joining our Year 12 will receive a free laptop and those thinking of university study can apply for one of two generous university bursaries, worth over Â£20,000 a year, for each year of future university study.\n\nChoosing a sixth form is a major decision, so our webpages and our prospectus provide further information about life in our Sixth Form, while our Vimeo channel contains helpful videos about our A Levels."
