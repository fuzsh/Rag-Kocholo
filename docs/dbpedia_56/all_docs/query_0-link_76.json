The station broadcasts on 100.7 MHz and 100.1 MHz in downtown Baltimore, and markets itself as the only station in the Baltimore market dedicated to the classic rock format. The station's city of license is Westminster, Maryland.Originally known as WTTR FM Westminster, after its move to Baltimore and the World Trade Center at the Inner Harbor the station operated under the call letters WGRX, 100GRX, and featured such diverse formats as classic rock, modern rock, and even country at various times in its history.After broadcasting in a classic rock format for many years, the station moved over to a modern rock format for a time in the mid-1990s. While in its modern rock format, it was known as \"the X\", and featured the popular \"M&M\" morning show.Suddenly one day, the station started broadcasting its modern rock DJ-free in a repetitive 10-song loop for a few days, which led into an unannounced weekend-long transition period of disco music as Polyester 101, before eventually switching to a country music format dubbed \"Froggy 100.7, and later New County 100.7\".\"Froggy 100.7\" having proven a failure, the station switched its call letters to WZBA and became known as \"The Bay\", advertising its format as \"Rock without the hard edge\". The station played mostly classic rock at this time, but only songs without heavy guitar. Occasional forays into mixing more modern \"rock without the hard edge\" in with the classic rock of that variety were attempted, but abandoned quickly, as they did not seem to have support from the station's listeners.Just hours after the Baltimore market's generalized classic rock station, 104.3 WOCT FM, switched to a smooth jazz format, WZBA abandoned its theme and switched to its current straight-forward classic rock format."
