Just thought u should know. Have a great day.\n\nPaul\n\nI listen to this station everyday at work. Mostly 90’s and early 2000 alternative music. Need to cut out the 2000, not Classic enough. Need to play more 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. What happened to Fleetwood Mac, Eric Clapton, The Beatles & more of The Who. You can’t claim to be Classic without playing the Beatles. Missing 2 for Tuesday.\n\nJim\n\nToo much 90's n up music not enough real classic rock (60' thru 80's)\n\nhollie\n\nI listen to this station from the time i wake up until i go to bed..I know every song that comes on"
