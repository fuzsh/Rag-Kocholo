        "text": "Westminster, city, seat (1837) of Carroll county, northern Maryland, U.S., 31 miles (50 km) northwest of Baltimore. It was founded in 1764 by William Winchester and was commonly called Winchester in its early years. Because the town was confused with Winchester, Virginia, it was renamed for the London borough of Westminster. It was an important supply base for the Union army during the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War. The city is now primarily a residential community. It is the seat of McDaniel College (1867; formerly called Western Maryland College). Of interest are the Historical Society of Carroll County (museum), Carroll County Farm Museum, and the Union Mills (Shriver family) Homestead (1797). The first rural free mail delivery in the country began at Westminster in 1899. Inc. 1837. Pop. (2000) 16,731; (2010) 18,590."
