        "text": "Like most areas of the country, Westminster gets a lot of its information from neighboring larger cities, Baltimore and Washington, with whom it shares some things in common, though it has its own issues as well. To what degree are the local voices able to be broadcast or published? As mergers and acquisitions have gobbled up so much U.S. media, being home to independents is rare. The purpose of this page is to explore how independent and how local are the local media of Westminster.\n\nWhen Congress set itself up as the traffic cop for the airwaves, it established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue free licenses to broadcasters if they met certain requirements, one of which was to “serve the public interest, convenience or necessity.” The notion of “public interest” has changed over the decades. Its original intent was seen as serving the good of the public. Now, after almost a century of domination by commercial media, a popular definition is to provide the public with what it’s interested in – which too often is gratuitous sex and violence.\n\nI’m still working on the following list with the aim of indicating who owns the media in Westminster. But first, a few words about networks.\n\nNewspaper Chains and Broadcast Networks\n\nThe main purpose of a newspaper chain or a broadcast network is to benefit its owner who purchases air time on channels or space in papers, sells it to advertisers, and provides content and programming as vehicles for the ads. Because of the nature of the broadcast spectrum, a broadcast station is rarer than a newspaper, so the power of networks is greater than that of a chain. At the same time, the existence of newspaper chains should not go unexamined. If a single entity owns most or all of the media in any municipality, it becomes difficult for local residents to become aware of differing views on issues. For this reason, Congress instituted caps on the amount of media any one company could control in one area as well as nation-wide. Those caps, however, keep increasing along with the power of a few companies. Since federal deregulation began in 1980, bigger media began swallowing up smaller ones, until by the 1990s there were about 10. For about a decade only 6 multinational corporations have controlled most of the media outlets — print, cable, telecomm, television, film, and radio — in the United States today — Disney Corporation, General Electric, CBS, Time-Warner, News Corporation, and Viacom. These companies produce the media products, and own the means of disseminating them.\n\nTo give an example of how this looks, Disney publishes or buys the rights to a book like Harry Potter, produces the film version, advertises the film on its TV channels including ABC, interviews the film actors across its channels, allows ABC news to cover the popularity of Harry Potter, manufactures ancillary products based on the film characters, creates scenarios at its theme parks based on Harry Potter. It’s hard to escape hearing about and knowing about Harry Potter, and the public gets a sense that Harry Potter must be important, and maybe even good. When the media are devoted to such blockbuster hits, the voices of millions of people, each with some degree of talent, some stories to tell, have difficulty finding an outlet. Now we have the internet and need to continue to protect it from corporate dominance that finds ways to crowd out a multiplicity of voices.\n\nThe history of networks in the U.S. is not a simple story of talented people making technological inventions and smart business deals. Rather, it’s peppered with government prods and perks and anti-trust suits.\n\nWhen British Marconi wanted to buy from General Electric (GE) exclusive rights to a radio part that GE had perfected during the war, this bothered the U. S. government who feared foreign control over US radio communication with Europe. They especially feared Great Britain who already was the most powerful country in shipping and oil. To counteract this threat, the government in 1919 blocked the deal, forced Marconi to sell its US interests, and encouraged GE and AT&T to pool their patents. The partnership spawned the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) which ran broadcasting stations, leaving GE to manufacture the equipment. Westinghouse joined the pool in 1921. Within 8 years the NBC network emerged out of stations that had been affiliated with AT&T’s telephone network connecting New York City, Chicago and Kansas City via telephone cable. In 1930, US Justice Dept filed an antitrust suit breaking up RCA. It later filed another anti-trust suit which caused ABC to spin off of NBC.\n\nThe CBS network began in the 1920s as a defense against the radio industry’s reliance on American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).\n\nNetworks can own stations outright, or stations can choose to affiliate with a network in exchange for its name-brand and programming. A station also has the option of remaining independent, though that status is quite rare these days. Networks bestow power and wealth on their owners. This wealth and power is widely believed to enable networks to produce higher quality programming than can be obtained form independent producers. This tenet bears some scrutiny.\n\nLocal Media\n\nPrint\n\nCarroll County Times is a daily newspaper in Westminster, Md. Its website says: “The Carroll County Times was founded on October 6, 1911 as The Times. Owner and publisher George Mather, whose father owned the once-prominent Mather’s Department Store in Westminster, sold The Times in 1947. The Times expanded and became theCarroll County Times in 1956. The newspaper changed hands several times over the next twenty years. It was a twice-weekly paper when purchased by current ownersLandmark Community Newspapers, a subsidiary of Landmark Media Enterprises LLC, in 1974. Landmark tells us on their website: “From a small printing cooperative formed by rural Kentucky publishers has grown a nationwide media company with publications from Florida to Iowa and from New Mexico to Maryland. Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC (LCNI) traces its history to 1966, when eight small-town publishers pooled resources to build a printing plant in Shelbyville, Kentucky to take advantage of the growing trend toward offset technology. Two years later, they incorporated to become Newspapers, Inc. and began buying other newspapers in Central Kentucky. Within five years, Newspapers, Inc. owned 18 newspapers and four printing plants. That drew the interest of Landmark Communications, Inc. Landmark bought Newspapers, Inc. in September 1973. The company kept its headquarters in Shelbyville next door to the first printing plant. Today, under the leadership of LCNI President Michael Abernathy, the company has 54 paid newspapers in 13 states, 40 free newspapers and shoppers, 16 offset commercial printing plants, seven collegiate sports publications, and 30 special publications such as real estate guides and homes magazines. Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC continues to uphold today, even as it did when it was first formed, the philosophy that the only first-rate newspapers are those which are independently operated by people who live in the community and who are responsive to community needs.” You can reach them at 601 Taylorsville Road, Shelbyville, KY 40065 (502) 633-4334″ Circulation: 24,746 copies\n\nWestminster Community Times is a weekly newspaper that began publishing in 1928 covers Reisterstown, Owings Mills, Glyndon and Greater Randallstown with a circulation of 12,000 copies. It is also owned by Landmark Community Newspapers, LLC.\n\nCarroll Magazine is owned by Kohn Creative Solutions in Westminster. Sherwood D. Kohn, listed as publisher, lives in Owings Mills, Maryland. He has been a reporter and editor on three major daily newspapers, a TV, film and theater critic, and editor on two national magazines. The magazine’s address is 83 E. Main St., Westminster MD 21157 tel: 410-840-3805. It seems to be a bona fide, locally owned and operated magazine that should get a lot of community support!\n\nTelevision\n\nCarroll Media Center http://www.carrollmediacenter.org/ is the local community access TV studio. Carroll County residents can sign up to use the studio for their own productions. Providing community access is a requirement specified in the contract that Comcast has with the county.\n\nCable TV Regulation: http://www.carrollcable.tv/ These are the local laws spelling out what Comcast has agreed to do in order to get its right to operate cable television for Carroll County citizens.\n\nSome Radio Stations Audible in Westminster\n\nOnce upon a time, local radio stations were actually local. Most of them carried a variety of programming to appeal to an array of listeners. There has always been some degree of business involved in running a radio station, but many of the local broadcasters went into radio because they loved the intimacy it gave them when connecting with their local audiences. Today, the broadcast media are primarily vehicles to deliver our eyeballs to the advertisers. We, the audience, are the product that’s packaged and sold. Ratings provide the proof — not of what it is we actually want to see or hear, but proof that a certain number of us are available to see a particular advertisement. For many reasons, our broadcasting system is not democratic, though a great deal of marketing has gone into trying to prove otherwise.\n\nCall Freq – Location – Category Description\n\nWAMU 88.5 FM Washington – News, talk\n\nWCSP 90.1 FM C-Span: Public Affairs\n\nWBJC 91.5 FM Baltimore Classical\n\nWERQ 92.3 FM “92Q” Baltimore Hip Hop\n\nWPOC 93.1 FM Baltimore Country\n\nWRBS 95.1 FM Baltimore Religious\n\nWPGC 95.5 FM “Jams 95.5 FM” Morningside Hip Hop\n\nWDLD 96.7 FM Halfway Top-40\n\nWIYY 97.9 FM “98 Rock” Baltimore\n\nWFRE 99.9 FM Frederick Country\n\nWZBA 100.7 FM “100.7 the Bay” Classic Rock. Originally WTTR FM Westminster, this station moved to the Inner Harbor. It is owned by RadioTime, a privately held Dallas-based company whose website describes its founder and CEO Bill Moore: “Bill founded RadioTime in 2002 because it was too hard to tune radio on connected products. Before RadioTime Bill led two profitable self-funded software businesses from scratch through acquisition. His 20 years of technology experience includes management, marketing, sales, and development. Prior to RadioTime, Bill was vice president and general manager of the access software business unit for Efficient Networks selling over eight million copies of consumer client software through broadband providers around the globe. His career includes VP for sales, marketing, product management, and business strategy for the IP management software startup Network TeleSystems in Sunnyvale California. He has also held senior management roles in sales, marketing, and support in his nine years at UB Networks in Santa Clara and Dallas. Bill has a BBA/MIS degree from Texas State University.” Does this describe a music lover who wants to connect with his listeners, or what?\n\nTo give you an idea of how confused this company is about Maryland geography, one of the pages on this station that lists its address as Westminster says, “Local radio for Cockeysville, MD 21030”\n\nWWDC 101.1FM “DC 101” Washington DC Rock\n\nWLIF 101.9 FM Baltimore Adult Contemporary\n\nWQSR 102.7 FM Baltimore Oldies\n\nWAFA 103.1 FM Middletown Adult Contemporary\n\nWXFB 104.3 FM Baltimore Classic Rock\n\nWAYZ 104.7 FM Hagerstown Country\n\nWXYV 105.7 FM “Live 105.7” Catonsville Hot Talk\n\nWWMX 106.5 FM “Mix 106.5” Baltimore Hot AC\n\nWARX 106.9 FM Hagerstown Oldies\n\nAM Stations\n\n*WCBM 680 AM Baltimore News/Talk\n\n*WXTR 820 AM Frederick News\n\n*WFMD 930 AM Frederick News/Talk\n\n*WBAL 1090 AM Baltimore News/Talk\n\n*WJEJ 1240 AM Hagerstown Easy Listening\n\nWJFK 1300 AM Baltimore Sports Talk\n\nWTHU 1450 AM Thurmont Nostalgia"
