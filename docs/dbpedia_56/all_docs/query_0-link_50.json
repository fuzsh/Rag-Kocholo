One of the region’s major international airports that I frequent is in Baltimore, and I am often in the city for various reasons. Although Baltimore is nearby, the radio dial is just different enough to warrant a separate DX log from my master home DX log.\n\nThe log below represents the first logging of every signal I received in this area. Changes (i.e. new call letters, formats, etc.) observed in these signals upon subsequent visits to this area are noted in the “Information” column, where appropriate. RDS and HD Radio screenshots shown below may be from different loggings of the same station.\n\nPage last updated: 10/21/2019"
