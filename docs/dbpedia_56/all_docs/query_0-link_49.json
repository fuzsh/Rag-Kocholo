        "text": "Veteran broadcasting executive Steve Borneman has been hired as general manager of Times-Shamrock Communications’ classic rock station, WZBA/100.7, in Baltimore.\n\nBorneman replaces Jefferson Ward, who announced his retirement in September after 10 years as general manager. Ward has stayed on to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nBorneman’s first day will be Jan. 10, 2022.\n\n“Steve wanted the opportunity to come back and work with a company that embraces a family culture, empowers managers to create compelling content and drive revenue through creative marketing concepts and strong client relationships,” said Times-Shamrock Chief Executive Officer Jim Lewandowski, who announced the hiring. “We are excited to have Steve back on the team.”\n\nBorneman served as general manager of Times-Shamrock’s Scranton/Wilkes-Barre radio stations from 2014 to 2016 before becoming chief operating officer for Pamal Broadcasting. He left Pamal in 2020 to become COO for Jam Media Solutions.\n\nBorneman began his radio career in Boston as an account executive before joining WPLJ and WABC, New York, working at the two stations for more than 20 years, the last six years as president and general manager.\n\n“I’ve known and admired Jefferson Ward for many years, and I’m honored that he and Jim Lewandowski have invited me to return to the company as the next manager of The Bay,” said Borneman. “Jefferson, Joe Heffron, Steve Huber and the entire 100.7 team have created one of America’s truly great radio stations and I will do my absolute best to live up to the amazing legacy of 100.7, The Bay!”\n\nTimes-Shamrock Communications is a 125-year old family owned media company with radio properties in Baltimore, Milwaukee and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre."
