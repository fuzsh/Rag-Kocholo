        "text": "Radio station in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nThis article is about the current radio station. For the radio station that used this call sign from 1973 to 1997, see WCTO. For the unrelated 1950s television station, see WLEV-TV.\n\nWLEV (100.7 FM, \"100.7 WLEV\") is a commercial radio station licensed to serve Allentown, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Cumulus Media, Inc, through licensee Radio License Holding CBC LLC, and broadcasts an adult contemporary music radio format.\n\nThe station covers the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania.[2] The station's antenna is located on the WFMZ-TV broadcast tower[3] on South Mountain south of Allentown.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n100.7 frequency\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station began operation in 1947 as WFMZ. On November 1, 1947, it moved from 105.1 MHz to 95.9 MHz concurrent with an increase in power to 1 kW.[5]\n\nThe station originally played classical and jazz music at various times of the day. Following this, in the 1950s, the station began playing blocks of instrumental easy listening music as well. In 1965, the station was sold to a Christian local group called Maranatha Broadcasting. At that point, WFMZ flipped to a religious/easy listening format. For many hours daily, the station sold blocks of time to churches. The rest of the day was filled with only instrumental easy listening music known as beautiful music. The station initially played no vocalists.\n\nIn the 1970s, WFMZ began cutting back the religious programming to very early mornings and middays and late evenings, replacing it with more easy listening music. By the mid-1970s, the station added some soft vocals by standard and adult contemporary artists; they began playing one or two per hour. In 1976, Maranatha signed on a television station on channel 69, WFMZ-TV. (A previous owner of the radio station operated an earlier WFMZ-TV on channel 67 in the 1950s.) The television station ran mostly religious shows along with about six hours a day of classic sitcoms and drama shows.\n\nIn the 1980s, WFMZ continued with the beautiful music format cutting the religious shows down to a couple hours a day at most. A boost in the ratings occurred when WQQQ dropped easy listening for Top 40 in 1983. WFMZ began gradually mixing in more vocalists and began playing about four an hour by 1987. By 1990, they were about half vocal and half instrumental. In 1991, the station overhauled the format and dropped most of the standards artists and focused on soft hits from popular AC and CHR artists. The station was now mostly vocal with an instrumental each hour. By 1994, WFMZ evolved completely into a soft adult contemporary format.\n\nMaranatha put WFMZ radio up for sale in 1996. Citadel Broadcasting, owner of WLEV (96.1 FM), bought the station late that year. The rumor was they would flip WFMZ to country. Upon closing though, both stations retained their AC formats with WFMZ being softer.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, it was determined that Allentown only needed one adult contemporary station, while a country station was also needed. That July, WLEV (96.1 FM) became WCTO, a country music station known as \"Cat Country 96\". Half of the WLEV airstaff remained on 96.1 and many new airstaffers were hired to carry out the country format.\n\nWFMZ had only a couple of air staffers and was mostly automated. The WLEV staffers who did not stay on WCTO moved to fill daytime hours on 100.7. The intellectual properties of WLEV and WFMZ were combined onto 100.7, under the WLEV call sign. The format overall became a straight adult contemporary format, with WFMZ's religious programming being dropped. Delilah's love songs show was added in the 7 p.m. to midnight time slot. Citadel's 1400 WEST was sold to Maranatha Broadcasting.\n\nWLEV intellectual unit\n\n[edit]\n\nWLEV began in 1947 as WEST-FM on 96.1. For decades the station simulcast WEST's middle of the road music format. In 1973, 96.1 became WLEV and began offering an automated soft rock/adult contemporary format that played the softer rock hits of the 1960s and 1970s along with current product. They were known as \"Hit Parade Music\" at one point. The station was owned by Sound Media and then by Telemedia Group.\n\nThrough the 1970s and into the 1980s, WLEV continued as a straight-ahead adult contemporary station with no dramatic changes. More personalities were added in the late 1980s. By the 1990s, the station bordered on being a hot AC, though the texture of the station remained consistent.\n\nIn 1995, the station was sold, along with WEST, to Citadel Broadcasting; the adult contemporary format on 96.1 continued until the consolidation with WFMZ and launch of WCTO's country music format in 1997.\n\nWLEV competes today with WBEB and WODE-FM as adult listening radio stations. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.[6]\n\nSignal note\n\n[edit]\n\nWLEV is short-spaced to two other Class B stations operating on 100.7 MHz: WZBA 100.7 The Bay (licensed to serve Westminster, Maryland) and WZXL 100.7 ZXL (licensed to serve Wildwood, New Jersey). The distance between WLEV's transmitter and WZBA's transmitter is only 105 miles (169 km), while the distance between WLEV's transmitter and WZXL's transmitter is only 106 miles (171 km), as determined by FCC rules.[7] The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.[8]\n\nHD programming and translators\n\n[edit]\n\nW257DI (Loud 99.3) began broadcasting a rhythmic CHR format in Reading on August 18, 2017, branding as \"Reading's Hip Hop Station\".[9] On January 17, 2022, Loud 99.3 moved to 98.5 FM.[10]\n\nBroadcast translator for WLEV-HD2 Call sign Frequency City of license FID ERP (W) Class Transmitter coordinates FCC info W225CF 92.9 FM Reading, Pennsylvania 155464 99 D LMS\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia in the Lehigh Valley\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
