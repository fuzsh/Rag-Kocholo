Digital healthcare assists and improves the services to healthcare providers, hospital administrators, insurance companies and most of all patients, especially in marginalized communities. Previously, patients had to come to healthcare but now healthcare can come to where they are. No one will be left behind. It is more important then ever, now that our women healthcare is on systematic assualt. I am thinking about this for children in Gaza where doctors can perform surgeries through remote robots and remote machines. The best care they need. This is also Lean thinking where equipment are on wheel, mobile and small footprint with value add services. That’s why now digital healthcare conferences are very important where all the stake holders can meet and share their knowledge, vision and research for better healthcare.
