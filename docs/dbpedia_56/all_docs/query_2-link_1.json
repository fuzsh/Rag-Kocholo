        "text": "City in Colorado, United States\n\nHome rule municipality in Colorado, United States\n\nThe City of Westminster is a home rule municipality located in Adams and Jefferson counties, Colorado, United States.[1] The city population was 116,317 at the 2020 United States Census with 71,240 residing in Adams County and 45,077 residing in Jefferson County.[3] Westminster is the eighth most populous city in Colorado. The city is a part of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. The Westminster Municipal Center is located 9 miles (14 km) north-northwest of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGold discovered in the South Platte River Valley in 1858 brought national attention to the area that would become Westminster, Colorado. The promise of fortune and The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged many pioneers from the east to settle in Colorado rather than continue on to California.[6] Before the settlements came, wildlife like antelope and buffalo made their homes in the area. There is also evidence of Arapaho Indians near the Crown Point (Gregory Hill) area.[7] Westminsters' first permanent settler was Kentucky farmer Pleasant DeSpain, who built his home in 1870 on 160 acres (near what is now West 76th Avenue and Lowell Street).[8] The area became known as DeSpain Junction and attracted other settlers including Edward Bruce Bowles, who in 1881 constructed a brick Italianate house now known as the Bowles House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The village of DeSpain Junction grew into a small farming community and continued to attract new settlers despite the difficulty of farming in Colorado's arid climate.[6] Connecticut real estate developer C.J. Harris arrived in DeSpain Junction in 1885 and purchased the DeSpain farm, among others. Harris combined the separate homesteads and divided it into smaller tracts of land, which he sold to fruit farmers. Harris renamed DeSpain Junction with his own name and the area was referred to as Harris, Colorado.[6] In 1890, New Yorker Henry T. Mayham convinced the Denver Presbytery to build a university on land that he owned in Harris. After delays caused by the depression of 1893, the school was built from red sandstone quarried in Colorado's Red Rocks region. The curriculum was patterned after Princeton University and was referred to as the \"Princeton of the West\". The school was incorporated as Westminster University of Colorado, and classes began in 1908 with one year's tuition costing $50 ($1,411 in 2018).[9] The school ceased operating in 1917, when all students in attendance left to fight in World War I.[10] In the following decade it operated as a church and school. In 1911, Harris voted to incorporate as a city and changed its name to Westminster, in honor of the university which is now on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn July 2006, it was ranked as the 24th best place to live in the US by Money magazine.[11]\n\nBell Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nWestminster City Hall features a 14-story bell tower topped by a pyramid shaped steel mesh structure. The 130-foot spire, which is widely known and referenced as a community landmark, was first conceptualized as a symbolic tie and tribute to the clock tower of Westminster Palace in England known as Big Ben.[12] The unveiling of the Bell Tower in 1986 was attended by the then mayor of Westminster, England. An English Oak can be seen on the City Hall property today- a gift to Westminster, Colorado, from Westminster, England.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nWestminster is located in western Adams County and northeastern Jefferson County. It is bordered to the north by Broomfield, to the northeast by Thornton, to the east by Northglenn and Federal Heights, to the southeast by Sherrelwood, Twin Lakes and Berkley, and to the south by Arvada.\n\nAt the 2020 United States Census, the town had a total area of 21,695 acres (87.796 km2) including 1,480 acres (5.990 km2) of water.[3]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1920235—193043685.5%194053422.5%19501,686215.7%196013,850721.5%197019,51240.9%198050,211157.3%199074,62548.6%2000100,94035.3%2010106,1145.1%2020116,3179.6%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nWestminster, Colorado – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Approximately 1,546 people per weekday board at this facility, with approximately 498 buses per day serving this park-n-Ride.[18]\n\nRTD opened the B Line to the public in 2016 which brings commuter rail service between downtown Denver and Westminster Station. The 6 miles of commuter rail transports riders from the historic center of Westminster to the dynamic Union Station Transit Center where they can connect to the C/D, E, and W light rail lines, the A Line to Denver International Airport, as well as Local and Regional buses, and the FreeMallRide and FreeMetroRide downtown shuttles.[19]\n\nWestminster is served by Denver International Airport and nearby Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nCompanies based in Westminster include DigitalGlobe, Ball and the Western Fuels Association.\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nWestminsters' top employers represent leading companies in high-tech, medical, energy, and other expanding fields.

The highlight of the trail system is the Big Dry Creek Trail which extends approximately 12 miles (19 km) from the eastern boundary of the city to Standley Lake. Other trails parallel the Farmers' High Line Canal, Walnut Creek, and Little Dry Creek.\n\nWestminster began preserving open spaces in 1985 when voters first approved a sales tax specifically earmarked to acquire and maintain open space. The city now owns more than 3,000 acres in all parts of Westminster.[24] The city has preserved large expanses of land in the Standley Lake Regional Park Archived February 28, 2012, at the Wayback Machine, and the Westminster Hills area, among others.
