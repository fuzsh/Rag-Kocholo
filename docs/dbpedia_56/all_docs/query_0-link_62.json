The city is under 60 miles from my house, but mountains make the local FM dial much different than what I can receive at home.\n\nThe log below represents the first logging of every signal I received in this area. Changes (i.e. new call letters, formats, etc.) observed in these signals upon subsequent visits to this area are noted in the “Information” column, where appropriate. RDS and HD Radio screenshots shown below may be from different loggings of the same station.\n\nPage last updated: 3/13/2019"
