As RBR+TVBR shared with readers on April 1, Steve Clendenin has decided to sell WHGM-AM 1330 in Havre de Grace, Md., and FM translator W263CQ in Chesapeake City, Md.

While the second FM translator used for WHGM, W284BE, remains the property of Hope Christian Church of Marlton Inc., Clendenin’s Maryland Media One is now parting ways with FM translator W298CG in Bel Air, Md.

Who’s buying this mini FM? Look no further than “The Bay,” perhaps.

That’s because W298CG at 107.5 is already being used as a simulcast partner of Westminster, Md.-licensed WZBA “The Bay,” with a Class B signal that on paper covers all of Baltimore County but infamously has signal holes in various locales. This explains the use of a FM translator at 100.1 MHz in downtown Baltimore, aiding “The Bay” in the most urban of areas within its listening zone.

Now, Bel Air is getting similar treatment.

“We are so excited to be coming in clearly to all of our listeners in Bel Air and the surrounding communities,” the Huber in the Morning show posted Monday afternoon on TheBayOnline.com.

Buying the FM translator is Shamrock Communications, the licensee led by President Jim Loftus.

With David O’Connor of Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP serving as his legal counsel, Shamrock is paying $200,000 to Clendenin for the 107.5 MHz FM translator.

There is no broker or finder associated with this deal, which includes a time brokerage agreement that allowed Shamrock to assume control on Monday of W298CG.
