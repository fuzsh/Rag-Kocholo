The role of chairman of the council of ministers was, historically, rotated among the members of the Cabinet. So Dutch PMs traditionally had only informal sources of influence. They first and foremost had to be good diplomats and effective back-room operators to keep their fractious multiparty coalition cabinets together. And they had to do so with relatively few formal powers."
