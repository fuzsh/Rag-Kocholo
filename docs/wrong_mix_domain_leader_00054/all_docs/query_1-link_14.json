        "text": "293. Memorandum of Conversation1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nIEA and OECD Ministerial Meetings\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\nState\n\nSecretary Kissinger\n\nDeputy Secretary Ingersoll\n\nUnder Secretary Robinson\n\nAssistant Secretary Enders\n\nMr. Ernest H. Preeg (Notetaker), Director, EUR/RPE\n\nTreasury\n\nSecretary Simon\n\nUnder Secretary Bennett\n\nAssistant Secretary Parsky\n\nAssistant Secretary Cooper\n\nWhite House\n\nL. William Seidman, Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs\n\nNSC\n\nMr. Robert D. Hormats, Deputy for International Economic Affairs, NSC\n\nSecretary Kissinger: We must find a better method for dealing with speeches. There is no way to get a speech written with such a large group of people involved. Is every passage marked in red to be negotiated?\n\nMr. Seidman: We tried to pick out the major issues. We have substantial agreement that there are three basic issues we need to consider.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: I understand these to be the new economic era, commodity policy, and buffer stocks. The rest can be negotiated by the various parties. I don’t pretend to run the State Department. Enders runs State while Bill lets Parsky run Treasury. On this basis, we will be at war in three weeks.\n\nWith regard to the new economic era let me explain my view. I believe we have to avoid an international dispute where Americans say the existing system is great and the LDCs call for a new economic order. This is a losing wicket. The Europeans won’t support us. Nobody will support us, particularly since there are so many socialist governments [Page 1007] in industrialized countries. And given the fact of Marxist domination in the thinking of LDCs, it is suicide to defend the existing system. We would be like the Austrians in the 19th century.\n\nWe can take concrete issues—like energy—on technical grounds and make progress. In fact, we cannot resist the new economic order if we don’t act on concrete issues. My view is to stake out our positions so as to prevent people like Uyl2 running around poor-mouthing us. We should be more forthcoming on the rhetoric, and have substance that supports a more positive response. As for the specifics of the substance, I won’t fall on my sword on particular technical points.\n\nAs for the text of the speech, on page 14 you are against me saying we want a system that we “perceive to be just.”\n\nSecretary Simon: That is not a problem for us, but we do oppose reference to new economic era, new attitudes, new approaches etc.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: Okay, I am willing to change from new to “willing to deal with imagination and compassion.” On pages 23–24, for example, all I want to achieve is to sound forthcoming without linking to specific programs.\n\nUnder Secretary Bennett: More forthcoming, yes, but not new.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: I am willing to fix the speech so as to convey a forthcoming attitude and fight where necessary on substance.\n\nAssistant Secretary Parsky: We have said commodity by commodity approach. But when we say new programs, it means something else. You should be forthcoming, but in a way …\n\nSecretary Kissinger: Parsky is moving ahead in his thinking—from 1860 to 1865.\n\nUnder Secretary Bennett: The other industrialized countries want to coddle the OPEC.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: No, they haven’t been bad on energy. On the broader North/South question I want to split them. The biggest challenge in the UN is the non-committed countries. That is why we have Moynihan going up there to take them on.3 On Portugal, we are isolated even though we are right. I would like to split the LDCs at the UN Special Session and keep some of the industrialized countries with us. And I am willing to give them something on rhetoric to accomplish this.\n\nCan we rework this draft this afternoon? Enders and Parsky should be able to work this out together.\n\n[Page 1008]\n\nMr. Seidman: The President would like to see the draft. Alan Greenspan also has an interest.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: Yes, but not for the President to arbitrate. We should have an agreed State/Treasury draft to put forward.\n\nNow regarding buffer stocks …\n\nSecretary Simon: The problem on buffer stocks is not only us, but\n\nBurns also …\n\nSecretary Kissinger: Okay, this is not an essential point. We will put it to the EPB or somewhere else later, for decision.\n\nAssistant Secretary Parsky: There is also the question of earnings stabilization.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: I would like to keep something in on this one. The new language seems fine. It merely conveys the thought we are willing to discuss this subject.\n\nAssistant Secretary Parsky: I agree. Now with regard to the introduction to the commodities section, if we say “new”, there are many in the government who have an interest in such a change in policy.\n\nSecretary Kissinger: I want a more forthcoming posture now. The substance will be needed before the UN Special Session. Let’s get together on this. We need a small State/Treasury/White House group to do this. We should not kick this issue into big forums.4\n\nSecretary Simon: I agree.\n\nAssistant Secretary Parsky: With respect to the Agricultural Development Fund, the President is committed to it5 but the impression in this speech is that there is new money.\n\nAssistant Secretary Enders: It is not a new budget item, but it is an increase above the 1974 level.\n\n[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Kissinger’s OECD speech.]\n\nMeeting ended 4:15 p.m."
