        "text": "The origins of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) go back to 1954 when the Soviet Union first proposed a European security conference in the hopes of formalizing the political boundaries established in Eastern Europe following World War II. The United States and the other Western nations were reluctant to engage in such discussions during the 1950s and 1960s, since they thought it would strengthen the Soviet position and lead to an expansion of communism. With the advent of d√©tente during the early 1970s, the Western leaders reconsidered their stance and began negotiations.\n\nWhen Gerald R. Ford became President of the United States in August 1974, planning and negotiations for the CSCE were already well underway. Having recognized the need to improve political and economic tensions between Eastern and Western Europe, participating countries had begun negotiating an agreement in 1973. After two years of negotiations, known as the Helsinki Process, 35 nations signed the Helsinki Final Act at a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in the summer of 1975."
