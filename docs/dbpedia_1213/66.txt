Saddle up, Miranda Lambert fans. The country star has dropped a snippet of an unreleased track, “No Man’s Land.”

“No Man’s Land” is a midtempo love song that chronicles a woman’s unrestrainable, free-spirited heart.

“Even when she’s in your arms she’s still no man’s land/ So love her like a mustang/ Like a wild thing/ Better let her run free/ If she wants to love you/ You let her love you/ You give her everything,” Miranda sings in the preview clip.

“No Man’s Land” is off Miranda’s forthcoming new album, Postcards From Texas. Arriving Sept. 13, the 14-song project also includes the recently released “Alimony,” “Dammit Randy” and its lead single, “Wranglers.”
