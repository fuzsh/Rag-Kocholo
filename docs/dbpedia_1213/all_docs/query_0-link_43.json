        "text": "Bonding with Your New Baby\n\nParents can take job-protected, paid time off to bond with their newborn within the first 12 months of the child’s birth.\n\nSome important information about Paid Family Leave for bonding with your new baby:\n\nPaid Family Leave may only begin after birth and is not available for prenatal conditions.\n\nParents who work for the same employer and want to take Paid Family Leave at the same time may do so unless their employer objects.\n\nYour employer’s insurance carrier will receive and process requests for Paid Family Leave, and make your benefit payments.\n\nYou may be eligible to take up to 12 weeks of Paid Family Leave at 67 percent of your pay, up to a cap. See below for complete instructions on how to apply.\n\nEstimate your Paid Family Leave benefits\n\n2024 Wage Benefits Calculator\n\nHow to Apply\n\nRequesting Paid Family Leave is easy. Start by planning your leave:\n\nLeave can be taken either all at once or intermittently, but must be taken in full-day increments.\n\nYou must notify your employer at least 30 days before the start of leave if foreseeable; otherwise, notify your employer as soon as possible.\n\nEmployees who hold more than one job may take Paid Family Leave from both jobs, but they must do so with both employers at the same time.\n\nImportant notes regarding intermittent leave: The maximum number of leave days you can take is based on the average number of days you work per week. For example, if you work an average of three days per week, you can take a maximum of 36 days of Paid Family Leave (3 days x 12 weeks). If you take intermittent leave and more than three months pass between days of Paid Family Leave, your next day or period of PFL is considered a new claim under the law. This means you will need to submit a new Request for Paid Family Leave.\n\nOnce you're ready to apply, follow these three steps:\n\nCOLLECT YOUR FORMS AND DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe forms are available from your employer, employer’s insurance carrier or you may download: Bond with a Newly Born, Adopted or Fostered Child (Forms PFL-1 & PFL-2)\n\nRequired Forms\n\nThe form package for bonding leave includes the following forms:\n\nRequest for Paid Family Leave (Form PFL-1)\n\nBonding Certification (Form PFL-2)\n\nRequired Documentation\n\nBirth Parent\n\nA copy of the child’s birth certificate, if available, or an original copy of a health care provider certification of birth.\n\nNon-Birth Parent\n\nA copy of the child’s birth certificate, if available, naming you as the second parent, a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage (Form LDSS-5171), or a Court Order of Filiation.\n\nOR\n\nSame documentation as birth parent and a second document verifying the relationship to the birth parent (for example, marriage certificate, civil union, or domestic partner document).\n\nCOMPLETE & ATTACH\n\nFORM PFL-1\n\nForm PFL-1 has sections that need to be completed by you and by your employer.\n\nFill out your section.\n\nMake a copy and give the form to your employer.\n\nYour employer is required to return Form PFL-1 to you within three business days.\n\nIf your employer fails to return the form to you, submit the Form PFL-1 that you have filled out, along with the rest of your request package, to your employer’s insurance carrier.\n\nFORM PFL-2\n\nComplete Form PFL-2.\n\nAttach copies of your supporting documentation.\n\nSUBMIT TO INSURANCE CARRIER\n\nYou must submit your completed request package to your employer's insurance carrier within 30 days after the start of your leave to avoid losing benefits.\n\nIf you cannot get documentation to support a leave request within this timeframe, the insurance carrier can deny the request.\n\nMail or fax your Form PFL-1, Form PFL-2, and all supporting documentation to your employer’s insurance carrier.\n\nTo find out who your employer’s insurance carrier is, you can:\n\nLook for the Paid Family Leave poster in your workplace.\n\nAsk your employer.\n\nSearch your employer’s name to look up their insurance carrier.\n\nEmployer Search\n\nIf you cannot find your employer’s insurance carrier, call the Paid Family Leave Helpline for assistance: (844) 337-6303. The Helpline is available Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIf you believe your employer is uninsured, you can submit your request for Paid Family Leave to the NYS Workers’ Compensation Board:\n\nNYS Workers’ Compensation Board\n\nPaid Family Leave\n\nPO Box 9030,\n\nEndicott, NY 13761-9030\n\nIn most cases, the insurance carrier must pay or deny benefits within 18 calendar days of receiving your completed request or your first day of leave, whichever is later. Your request cannot be considered incomplete solely because your employer failed to fill out Form PFL-1 Part B within three business days.\n\nIf you have a question regarding the status of your request, contact your employer's insurance carrier.\n\nIf you disagree with the insurance carrier's decision:\n\nYou may request arbitration for a denial or any other PFL claim-related dispute, such as timeliness of the carrier’s payment.\n\nArbitration for Paid Family Leave is handled by NAM (National Arbitration and Mediation).\n\nIf you are denied or partially denied for Paid Family Leave, your insurance carrier (or employer, if self-insured) must provide you with the reason for denial and information about requesting arbitration, or you can visit the arbitrator’s website at https://nyspfla.namadr.com.\n\nIf your request for Paid Family Leave is denied and you have already started your leave, you are not considered to be on Paid Family Leave, and it will be up to your employer to determine how to treat the time off.\n\nFor details on how to request arbitration view:\n\nYour Rights and Protections\n\nIf you need further assistance, call the Paid Family Leave Helpline at (844) 337-6303.\n\nGetting Paid\n\nIn most cases, the insurance carrier will pay benefits or deny your claim within 18 days of receiving your completed request or your first day of leave, whichever is later. After the initial payment, payments are made biweekly. Your insurance carrier may provide options for how you will be paid, for example, via direct deposit, debit card or paper check.\n\nNote: Pursuant to the Department of Tax Notice No. N-17-12 [PDF], Paid Family Leave benefits are taxable. Taxes will not automatically be withheld from benefits, but employees can request voluntary tax withholding. Questions related to the taxability of Paid Family Leave contributions should be referred to the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance.\n\nRequired Documentation\n\nWhen requesting Paid Family Leave for bonding with your new baby you will need to provide documentation that proves you are the child's parent.\n\nThe documentation that you must provide depends on your relationship to the newborn child.\n\nBirth Parent\n\nBirth certificate, if available, or\n\nDocumentation of pregnancy or birth from a health care provider (includes birth parent's name and due/birth dates)\n\nNon-Birth Parent\n\nBirth certificate, if available, or\n\nVoluntary acknowledgment of parentage or court order of filiation; or\n\nA copy of documentation of pregnancy or birth from a health care provider (includes birth parent's name and due/birth dates) and a second document verifying the birth parent's relationship with the birth parent or child\n\nIn a same-sex relationship and only one parent or neither parent is the biological parent:\n\nA non-birth parent must submit documentation establishing their legal role as the child’s parent, and demonstrating their relationship to the birth parent.\n\nAcceptable forms of documentation include:\n\nLegal role as child’s parent – birth certificate, Court Order of Filiation, or Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage naming that parent\n\nRelationship to birth parent – marriage certificate, or evidence of a civil union or domestic partnership\n\nIf none of these documents are available, a parent may submit other documentary evidence of parental relationship to the child, to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPFL and Other Types of Benefits\n\nFamily And Medical Leave Act (FMLA):\n\nIf you have an event that qualifies for leave under both FMLA and Paid Family Leave and your employer is covered under both laws, your leave should run concurrently.\n\nFor example, in 2019, if you are eligible to take 12 weeks of leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, the first ten weeks would be classified as both Paid Family Leave and FMLA, and the remaining two weeks would be classified as FMLA leave.\n\nIn order for the two types of leaves to run together, your employer must notify you that your leave qualifies for both FMLA and Paid Family Leave and that it will be designated as such.\n\nIf you have a qualifying event for FMLA and a different qualifying event for Paid Family Leave (for example, caring for your own medical condition using time with FMLA and bonding with a new child using Paid Family Leave), you may take these leaves at different times.\n\nShort-term Disability:\n\nAfter giving birth, a worker may be eligible for both short-term disability benefits and Paid Family Leave. While the two benefits cannot be taken at the same time, eligible employees can choose how they can use both benefits to support the needs of their families.\n\nFor example, a new parent who qualifies for short-term disability after giving birth can choose to:\n\nImmediately take all or any portion of their available short-term disability weeks and then take Paid Family Leave at any time within the first 12 months; or,\n\nTake Paid Family Leave immediately, without taking any short-term disability.\n\nYou cannot take more than 26 weeks of combined short-term disability and Paid Family Leave in a 52-week period.\n\nParental Leave:\n\nCheck with your employer on how Paid Family Leave works with your employer’s leave policies.\n\nIf I completed paperwork for short-term disability, do I still need to do it for Paid Family Leave?\n\nIf you are requesting short-term disability and Paid Family Leave, you have to complete separate requests for each. These are separate benefits, which are not taken at the same time, and which require separate documentation from you and your employer.\n\nFor more information on how Paid Family Leave interacts with these and other benefits, visit:\n\nPaid Family Leave and Other Benefits"
