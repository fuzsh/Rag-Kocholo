        "text": "A judge has to approve how you’ll divide your property and debts\n\nPart of your divorce involves dividing your property and debts. Property is anything you can buy or sell or has value. For example, a house, car, or furniture. It’s also things like a bank account, pension, 401k, or stocks.\n\nEven if you divided everything informally when you separated, a judge still needs to make a formal order about these issues. This doesn’t mean you have to go to court. A judge could formally approve an agreement you and your spouse write up. If you can't decide, a judge can decide for you at a hearing or trial.\n\nCalifornia divides property into two categories\n\nTo tell the judge what you want to happen, you'll need to understand some legal terms and some California property law. You’ll see terms like separate and community property on many court forms. These are important to know because this is how a court will decide how to divide your property. In general, you keep your separate property and split your community property.\n\nCommunity property\n\nCommunity property: What you own or owe together during your marriage\n\nSeparate property\n\nSeparate property: What you each own or owe individually from before you married or after you separated, and any gifts or inheritance\n\nCommunity or separate? You need to know your date of separation\n\nYou need to know when you married and when you separated to figure out what's separate property and what's community property. The day of your marriage is generally easy to figure out. Separation can be trickier.\n\nDate of separation:\n\nThe day that one of you let the other one know (by actions or words) that they wanted to end your marriage\n\nAfter that day, your or their actions were consistent with wanting to end your marriage\n\nFor some people, this is the day they moved out. For others, this is a day the two spouses agreed together that their marriage was over, and they made plans to divorce. Generally, from that day forward, what you or your spouse earned or loans you took out were no longer community property.\n\nHow to tell when something is community property\n\nGenerally, this is what either of you earned (or debt you took out) after you married, but before you separated. The “community” is you and your spouse. The property belongs to you both equally.\n\nCommunity property is:\n\nAnything you earned while married\n\nAnything you bought with money you earned while married\n\nDebt you take on while married\n\nProperty you didn’t earn, like a gift or inheritance one of you received while married, is not community property.\n\nYou may have more community property than you realize. Many people don’t think about retirement or pension plans. You have the right to part of the money in that plan if any of it was earned during your marriage.\n\nYou may have more community debts than you realize. Your spouse may have debt in only their name that you don’t know about. Usually, these debts belong to you both.\n\nHow to tell when something is separate property\n\nGenerally, separate property is:\n\nAnything you earned or owned (or a debt) from before you married or after you separated\n\nAnything you buy with separate property or you earn from separate property\n\nGifts or inheritance (to one of you) even if it was given or inherited when you were married\n\nIf you have separate property, it belongs only to you, as long as it was kept separately. Kept it separately means you didn’t give it to your spouse.\n\nSometimes property is part community, part separate\n\nProperty can be part community and part separate. This is called commingling. This just means that separate property and community property got mixed together.\n\nThis often happens with big purchases, retirement plans, and bank accounts.\n\nHow to divide your property and debts\n\nIn general, after a divorce, a judge would order that you:\n\nKeep your separate property\n\nDivide your community property equally\n\nYou and your spouse can agree to something different if you both think it’s fair. But, if you do not agree that’s usually how a judge will divide your property.\n\nWhen property is complicated, talk to a lawyer for advice\n\nThe property and debts part of a divorce can be complicated, especially if you have anything of high value or a lot of debt. You may want to talk to a lawyer before you file or sign any property agreements. You can consult a lawyer just to help with the property and debts part of your case.\n\nSome reasons to talk to a lawyer:\n\nYou disagree about what to do with a house or business you own\n\nYou have a lot of debt, you may even be facing bankruptcy\n\nYou signed a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement\n\nYour spouse took out debt or bought something for someone without your knowledge (like a gambling debt or used your community money for a relationship with someone else)\n\nIf either of you has a retirement plan, especially a pension"
