        "text": "When you purchase your leased vehicle, you change the ownership of the vehicle. The lessor owns a leased vehicle with the lessee listed on the registration. Following a lease buyout, you must re-register and re-title the vehicle in your name. When you do this, the registration on your leased vehicle ends, and you begin a new registration term; the time remaining on the leased vehicle’s registration does not transfer to the new vehicle.\n\nIf you renew the registration on a leased vehicle immediately before you buy out your lease, that registration time will not transfer to the new vehicle.\n\nWhen you purchase a leased vehicle, the lessor should provide you with the title of the vehicle signed over to you. Bring that title and bill of sale to any DMV office to re-register and retitle the vehicle in your name.\n\nYou will be responsible for a new registration fee, title fee, and 6% purchase and use tax on the vehicle's residual value. You may keep your existing plates, but the time on those plates will start over when you re-register the vehicle.\n\nIn-Person: Complete the Replacement Registration Form (form #VD-040) and schedule an appointment to visit a Vermont DMV Office.\n\nBy Mail: Complete the Replacement Registration Form (form #VD-040) and mail with any required fees to:\n\nVermont Department of Motor Vehicles 120 State Street Montpelier, VT 05603-0001\n\nOnline: Go to mydmv.vermont.gov, and log into your myDMV account. Once logged in, select the ‘Update My Address’ link in the I Want To panel. The first address available for changing is your mailing address for the vehicle; you can choose to change this address or not. The next address displayed is the physical address, which you can choose to change. Selecting ‘Yes’ to either of these options will bring up fields where you can enter the new address. At the end of the process, click ‘Submit’ to process the request.\n\nBoth owners listed on the title must sign it over to whoever will remain on the title (in section one on the back of the title). Fill out sections 1-4 and 8 on the registration application and mail the title and registration application to our main office in Montpelier with the appropriate fees.\n\nYou must also provide an updated odometer reading.\n\nIf one of the owners is deceased, attach a copy of that person’s death certificate."
