        "text": "All that and we're still not oversold. Last week, the Nasdaq fell more than 3% and entered correction territory, while the Dow and S & P 500 each shed more than 2%. But according to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator — our most trusted indicator of how to act during big upswings or huge downdrafts in the market — we're still overbought. At Friday's close the reading was 1.37%. Anything above 4% indicates the market is overbought, anything below a minus 5% means the market is oversold.) How can we get a meaningful bottom, let alone a meaningful bounce, if we aren't oversold? The answer: We can't. A 1.37% reading just doesn't get us very far. So what's wrong with this market? I mean, what's really wrong? Myriad issues. Front and center: This weekend, we learned the revered Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut his Apple position in half last quarter and chopped his Bank of America position, too. These are both bad news because he has been sanctified as the greatest investor of all time, and here he is selling one of the best of the Magnificent Seven stocks and the big bank that arguably had the best quarter. These moves are sending signals that will chill the summer stockholder. Buffett's endorsement of Apple was always seat-of-the-pants. It was never based on valuation. I am not going to play the guessing game of why he sold it. I am just prematurely predicting other investors fleeing the stock because they think Warren knows more than them. That's just a game. Do your own thinking. I have been saying that Apple is getting away from its handheld dependence because of its ever-growing —and accelerating — service revenue. Apple's strategy of getting the best of AI without having to pay for it, a free ride, is also brilliant. (In June, Apple announced a partnership with Microsoft-backed OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems.) Of course, it takes truly superior products to do that. And what a great deal, especially because Microsoft does not get your data when they give Apple Chat GPT. Do you think any of that influenced Buffett to sell? Do you think he pondered the possibility that enterprises might use Apple more now since it was unaffected by the CrowdStrike -Microsoft outage, which shut down millions of non-Apple screens? Maybe not. But what angered me was that some of the sale was attributed to weakness in China. There was no weakness. As CEO Tim Cook patiently walked me through the Apple-China scenario, you realized that things have actually gotten better there. I know that seems uninformed but I got it from Cook, for heaven's sakes. It reminds me of when billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn sold his considerable position in Apple at the end of April 2016 — on China worries. Look, Apple has a higher multiple than it has ever had. But if it is losing the cyclicality of hand-held devices and going to the razor and blades model — in which one item is sold at a low price or given away in order to increase sales of other supplies or services — it deserves the higher valuation. But I am not a fool. Warren killed Apple Saturday. Given that it was the second-best performer in the Mag Seven, we didn't need to see the shiv stuck into its side this weekend, complicating the bottoming process. The endless selling of Bank of America may be more infuriating because it, too, had nothing to with the bank's performance, which was excellent. But Warren's selling gives investors pause: Did he sell the bank stock because he's fearful that things could go upside down? The problem is that during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Buffet didn't take any evasive action at all. So his timing may not be all that exquisite. I wonder if this isn't the twilight of Warren's time. That's just as good an explanation as any for the brutal slicing of these two stocks. Nonetheless, the banks and tech were among the worst sectors last week. The banks have given up everything they made since reporting very good quarters. I say if you want to follow Buffett and sell Apple, be my guest. But can you at least give me a reason of your own that is not China to justify the sale? As for the banks, we sold some Wells Fargo at $60 a share in early July, realizing a big gain of 77% on stock purchased in January 2021. We are looking to rebuild the position. The weekend augurs badly, what can I say? It shouldn't? You go tell the hoard of humanity that mimics Warren. I'd rather just take the pain. Apple may have been misunderstood by Buffett. Amazon was misunderstood by the market. Many investors thought that Amazon was the best set up of the Mag Seven going into earnings. Oddly, it was. The quarter was a strong one . But that didn't matter. The sellers seemed shocked by the forecast for Amazon retail and totally excised the greatness of the much more lucrative Amazon Web Services. That cloud business has great gross margins that bottomed two years ago and have been pretty much straight up since. Investors periodically turn on Amazon. They turned on the AWS slowdown to 10% and now that it has almost doubled they pay no attention. Instead, all that mattered was the weak Amazon retail forecast. First, many didn't understand that events can slow down shopping. Take the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump. Before it happened, that day was a good one for shopping. After, shopping plummeted. People don't want to accept that the Olympics could slow shopping. But given the incredible performance of the U.S. and the viewing numbers Comcast is getting, it seems reasonable that the U.S. may have a different shopping pattern for a couple of weeks. Was it right for Amazon to lower its sales forecast because of this? Who knows? Maybe management believes this is the start of something big based on the consumer slowing? Maybe the company is worried about its mix? But then again, the mix Is being driven by same-day toiletries and staples so the margins aren't as high and the forecast may be driven by that. I will take that as a win though, because these same sales are at the expense of Walgreens and CVS , both of which have to close thousands of stores. This leads to a virtuous circle for Amazon and a vicious cycle for the dwindling margins of the drug store world. If Amazon, Bank of America and Apple all turned out to be vulnerable, what isn't vulnerable? Lets go back to another thing slapping us in our faces: the Federal Reserve. Sure, I would have liked it if the Fed cut after its last meeting. Things had been slowing down. But the economy is still creating jobs and the price of some things like housing haven't come down. You can't be too harsh on the central bank. It doesn't work for investors. But let's dissect the anger. I have seen the end of many tightenings. Some finish with emergency cuts and some end with whimpers. Almost none end calmly. That's by nature. The Fed doesn't look much at corporate data. But if it did, it would see that July was a weak month and the consumer is holding back. We had the spendthrift consumer, then the prudent consumer, the frugal consumer, the tightfisted consumer and then the consumer who substituted for cheaper goods and, finally, the consumer who went on strike. The strike is recent and it is happening in unimportant months. So who knows if Fed chief Jerome Powell is really wrong or just off by seven weeks — the time til the next Fed meeting. Those seven weeks, though, could bring pain because we have retail earnings coming up and we have lots of discussion about the slowing of the consumer and its impact on everything from advertising — think Snap , Pinterest and Alphabet 's YouTube, but not Meta 's Instagram and Amazon Ads, a selective memory of pain. We must also account for the incredible, continual dismissal of generative AI and the expensive spend for the data center. I don't mind the spend, and not just because we have a position in Nvidia , the chief beneficiary. I don't mind it because this could be like 2000-2001 and we don't know who is going to be shaken out. If you are Amazon or Alphabet, survivors of that era because of their tech and their balance sheets, you better believe they are going to spend what's necessary. We know that Microsoft with its Copilot chatbot is going to spend as it did in 2000. Funny and ironic: We question the spending of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft now, but isn't it reasonable to give the three winners of the post-dot-com era the benefit of the doubt? Meta shouldn't even be criticized. It's already got a game plan that could include sights set on a humongous portion of all advertising. Should Meta be selling at 23 times next year's earnings? Should we be able to get it for or 19 times? To me, getting one of the premier growth stories of our time for 23 times earnings with a huge buyback and terrific balance sheet seems incredibly reasonable. What else went awry? How about the dissolution of Intel ? Shares of the chipmaker had their biggest drop since 1974 on Friday, plummeting 26%, after the company reported a big miss on earnings and said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees. The misinformation here is legion. First comes the notion that CEO Pat Gelsinger, because he was an apostle of the late Andy Grove, could right the ship. How do we really know the relationship between the taciturn, humorless Grove and what was then some youngster at Intel? He may have been the company's first chief technology officer (good), but he was forced out in 2009 because of problems in his graphics chip unit (bad, especially as that would have been the division that could have stopped Nvidia). Gelsinger spent 30 years at Intel, but so what? It's been a second-tier company ever since Craig Barrett retired as CEO in 2005. Gelsinger came back in 2021 with the mission of returning Intel to greatness, which included building semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs. The problem is fabs are real expensive and they are much cheaper to build in Taiwan, which has far more engineers and cheaper labor. Sure, he gets money from the government, $8.5 billion, to help build two fabs in the U.S. But that's not enough. Intel has shrewdly roped in Brookfield, the alternative investment manager, to help build its Arizona plant and Apollo to help out with its new Irish plant. But this mammoth spending spree for the two fabs in the U.S. lacks one thing: clients. It doesn't have them. Shouldn't it have thought about that? It doesn't have the business to utilize the fabs itself. Plus, Intel's relationships with Lenovo, Dell and HP have got to be stretched by all of this disappointment and failure. Do you think these companies are sitting around desperate to help Pat? They don't care. They just want a steady supply of chips and Intel may not be able to deliver that supply. None of this seemed to matter to the market which thought, somehow, that Intel wasn't in trouble. It was revelatory only to those who never listen to us as we have been saying this endlessly. You could chide us for acting too soon by buying Advanced Micro Devices , but that one will work out because it's a small position. Do not mistake this though: Intel's loss is AMD's gain. Let's put together all of these thoughts and toss in some others for good measure. We have a considerable number of investors who don't realize that you can't have a terrific bull market while the fundamentals are downshifting, but you can't have a bear market when the Fed is about to cut interest rates. We are right smack in a most perilous moment because the Fed doesn't want to move too fast but the stock market does and the Fed does not care about that. We have the bonds signaling the Fed will screw it up, but the bond market always thinks the Fed is going to screw it up. So it will flail and rates will continue to go down — except now it is bad for stocks. We are in no man's land and that's awful for stocks. We have lots of discredited theories that shouldn't be discredited. We have dozens of big-cap companies dedicated to stopping climate change and those companies are toast if one candidate wins and are rocket ships if another triumphs. We have companies devoted to a consumer who, Olympics viewer or not, seems to have gone AWOL. We have Mag Seven and friends who are no longer to be trusted because only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to know what to do with his H100 AI chips and we have too many rumors that the next generation chip is late to the market. Meanwhile, we should be saved by health care, but the sector is riddled with problems about Chinese spending. The foods, another hiding please, are in trouble because of GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs. The only thing working is the utilities which, too most, means recession. I don't think we will have a recession, but it is a guessing game and the current estimate is that the Fed screwed it up and we will have one. I don't think a presidential election is all that conducive to the market. Neither candidate is going to do anything but chill the consumer, as one candidate gets nasty and the other has to hold her tongue. I can't see a scenario where either candidate seems friendly to business. That means that over the next seven weeks we should have a dead cat bounce, or a short recovery, and a chance to sell some more shares. Then we'll see another downturn as the guessing game won't end until the negative numbers are clear and the Fed feels compelled to cut. Only then is anything but a trend.
