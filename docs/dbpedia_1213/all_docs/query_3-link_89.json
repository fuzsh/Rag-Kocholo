It is also used to calculate use tax on motor vehicles brought into Texas that were purchased from a private-party out of state. For more information, please see Private-Party Purchases and Standard Presumptive Values.\n\nRates\n\nSales: 6.25 percent of sales price, minus any trade-in allowance. The taxable value of private-party purchases of used motor vehicles may be based on the standard presumptive value.\n\nUse:\n\nTexas residents – 6.25 percent of sales price, less credit for sales or use taxes paid to other states, when bringing a motor vehicle into Texas that was purchased in another state.\n\nNew residents – $90 new resident tax due in lieu of use tax on a vehicle brought into Texas by a new resident, if the vehicle was previously registered in the new resident's name in another state or foreign country.\n\nEven exchange: $5\n\nGift: $10\n\nDue Date\n\nThe dealer will collect motor vehicle sales tax from the purchaser when a motor vehicle is purchased from a dealer in Texas, if the motor vehicle has a gross weight of 11,000 pounds or less. The tax is a debt of the purchaser until paid to the dealer. The dealer will remit the tax to the county tax assessor-collector.\n\nA private party purchaser must remit the appropriate motor vehicle tax to the county tax assessor-collector as follows:\n\nwithin 30 calendar days of purchase for motor vehicle sales tax on private-party sales;\n\nwithin 30 calendar days from the date a vehicle purchased outside Texas is brought into Texas for motor vehicle use tax or the new resident use tax;\n\nwithin 60 calendar days from the date of purchase or first use in Texas for active duty military personnel;\n\nwithin 30 calendar days of purchase of a motor vehicle in Texas with a gross weight in excess of 11,000 pounds, if the dealer did not collect the tax;\n\nat the time of title transfer for the even exchange tax or the gift tax.\n\nTitling and Registration Requirements\n\nMotor vehicle sales tax is remitted to the local county tax assessor-collector's office with Form 130-U, Application for Texas Title and/or Registration (PDF). The form must be signed by the purchaser.\n\nLate Registration Penalty\n\nIf tax is paid 1-30 days after the due date, a 5 percent penalty is assessed.\n\nIf tax is paid over 30 days after the due date, a 10 percent penalty is assessed.\n\nAdditional Resources"
