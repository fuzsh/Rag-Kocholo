        "text": "Vehicles Purchased in a Different State\n\nVehicle Inspection Requirement\n\nAny vehicle from another state that is being titled in Indiana, including vehicles owned by new Indiana residents and vehicles assigned to an Indiana resident on a manufacturer's certificate of origin, must have a vehicle inspection. The inspection will confirm the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the vehicle. The inspection may be performed at any Indiana branch or BMV certified full or partial service provider at no charge or may be performed by a law enforcement officer who may charge up to five dollars ($5.00). If the inspection is performed by a law enforcement officer, the officer must provide to you a completed Physical Inspection of a Vehicle or Watercraft - State Form 39530.\n\nLiens on Vehicles from Different States\n\nIf there is a lien on the vehicle and the title is being held by the lienholder in another state, you must visit a branch to complete a Request for Title - State Form 1014. The branch will mail the request to the lienholder. Once the title has been received from your lienholder, the branch will contact you and request that you return to the branch to complete your application for the Indiana certificate of title. For more information on liens, please visit the Releasing a Lien webpage.\n\nRequired Documentation and Application Options\n\nApplicants who purchased a vehicle from a dealer located in a different state may mail their application for certificate of title to the BMV.\n\nThe Transfer of Out-of-State Title to Indiana Vehicle and Watercraft Title Application Packet provides a detailed list of the documents required to be submitted with the application. Prior to submitting each application, verify that all required information is included.\n\nDownload the Application Checklist for Transfer of Out-of-State Title\n\nSales and Use Tax\n\nWhen you purchase a vehicle in Indiana, you must pay sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle. If a vehicle is purchased from an Indiana dealership, the dealer will collect the sales tax and provide proof of the sales tax paid on an ST108 – Certificate of Gross Retail or Use Tax Paid – State Form 48842. If a vehicle is purchased privately, the sales tax must be paid at a branch when you apply for the Indiana certificate of title.\n\nIndiana residents who purchased a vehicle from a state other than Indiana, including non-Indiana dealers, will receive credit for the sales tax paid in that state. If you paid less than the amount of sales tax Indiana would have assessed, you must pay the difference to Indiana at the time of the application for the Indiana certificate of title.\n\nNew Indiana residents are not charged sales tax when transferring their vehicle’s certificate of title from their prior state of residence to Indiana."
