        "text": "Netflix original TV shows and movies are typically released globally at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time.\n\nFind these titles by looking for the red “N” on the title’s artwork. You can also search for “Netflix” to see them all, or visit netflix.com/originals.\n\nSome Netflix titles are originals in one country but not in another. In that case, the title usually follows this schedule:\n\nTitle is an original in your country (has a red \"N\" on the title artwork): available at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time\n\nTitle is not an original in your country: available at 12:00 a.m. local time\n\nNote:\n\nThis may vary for episodes that are released weekly or that follow their original broadcast airing.\n\nYou may need to refresh your browser, reload the Netflix app, or restart your device and relaunch Netflix to watch a newly released title.\n\nThough there is no set schedule, we’re always adding new titles for our members to enjoy."
