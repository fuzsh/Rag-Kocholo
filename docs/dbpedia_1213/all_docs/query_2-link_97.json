For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,\n\nNIV Donât let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.\n\nNASB No one is to deceive you in any way! For it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,\n\nCSB Donât let anyone deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.\n\nNLT Donât be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed â the one who brings destruction.\n\nKJV Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
