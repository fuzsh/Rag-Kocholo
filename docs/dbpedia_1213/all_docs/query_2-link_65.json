Judas is a devil.\n\n(44) No man can come to me.--The subject is still the mystery of the varying effects of His revelation on the minds of men. These depend upon their present mental state, which is itself the result of acceptance of, or rejection of, divine influence. The Father which sent Him had, by law, and prophets, and worship, been preparing them. The history of each individual life had been a succession, in every conscious hour, of influences for good or for evil. The mind stood between these, and willed for one or other. He who day by day, with all his light and strength, however little that all might have been, had sought the pure, and true, and good--had sought really to know God--was drawn of God, and he only it was who could now come to Him whom God sent. Others were drawn of evil, because they had submitted themselves to its power. They had chosen darkness, and could not now see the light; they had bound themselves in the silken cords of sin, which had hardened into fetters of iron; they had lost themselves in the labyrinths of what they thought wisdom, and did not recognise the true and living way which was opened for them.\n\nThe word \"draw\" need not perplex us; and all the theories opposed to the width of divine love and influence, and to the freedom of human will and action, which have been built upon it, are at once seen to be without support, when we remember that the only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs in a moral sense is in the declaration: \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me\" (John 12:32).\n\nParallel Commentaries ...\n\nGreek\n\n“No one\n\nοὐδεὶς (oudeis)\n\nAdjective - Nominative Masculine Singular\n\nStrong's 3762: No one, none, nothing.\n\ncan\n\nδύναται (dynatai)\n\nVerb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular\n\nStrong's 1410: (a) I am powerful, have (the) power, (b) I am able, I can.
