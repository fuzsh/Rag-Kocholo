        "text": "Pregnancy discrimination is against the law. The EEOC enforces three federal laws that protect job applicants and employees who are pregnant.\n\nThe first law is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which is called “Title VII.” It prohibits sex discrimination, including pregnancy discrimination. “Pregnancy” discrimination under Title VII can be based on:\n\nCurrent pregnancy;\n\nPast pregnancy;\n\nPotential pregnancy;\n\nMedical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth including breastfeeding/lactation;\n\nHaving or choosing not to have an abortion;\n\nand Birth control (Contraception).\n\nThe second law is the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which is called the “PWFA.” The PWFA requires a covered employer to provide a reasonable accommodation to a worker’s known limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship.\n\nThe third law is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is called the “ADA.” The ADA prohibits discrimination against an applicant or employee based on a disability, including a disability related to a pregnancy such as diabetes that develops during pregnancy. While pregnancy itself is not a disability under the ADA, some pregnant workers may have one or more impairments related to their pregnancy that qualify as a “disability” under the ADA. An employer may have to provide that worker with a reasonable accommodation for the pregnancy-related disability.\n\nThe ADA also requires that employers keep all medical records and information, including those that are pregnancy-related, confidential and in separate medical files.\n\nPregnancy & Work Situations\n\nTitle VII and the ADA cover employment discrimination in all aspects of employment, including:\n\nHiring or the job application and selection process;\n\nPay, job assignments, or promotions;\n\nTraining, employee benefits, or any other term or condition of employment; and\n\nFiring from a job, reduction of hours, layoff, or termination of employment.\n\nPregnancy & Workplace Accommodations\n\nUnder the PWFA, an employer must accommodate a worker’s known limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, absent undue hardship. The PWFA also prohibits an employer from forcing a worker to take an accommodation, absent certain steps, and prohibits an employer from requiring a worker to take leave if there is another accommodation that does not cause an undue hardship that will allow the worker to stay on the job.\n\nWorkers may also be entitled to accommodations under Title VII or the ADA.\n\nPregnancy & Harassment\n\nIt is unlawful to harass a worker because of pregnancy, childbirth, or a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth or because of a pregnancy-related physical or mental disability.\n\nLearn more about harassment.\n\nWorkers with Caregiving Responsibilities\n\nDiscrimination against working parents and others with caregiving responsibilities outside of work violates Title VII if it is based on sex. Under the ADA, employers cannot discriminate against employees because they associate with a person with a disability by caring for that person, for example.\n\nLearn more about caregiver discrimination.\n\nRetaliation & Interference\n\nTitle VII, the PWFA, and the ADA protect workers against retaliation. It is illegal for an employer to retaliate against workers for participating in the equal employment opportunity process or opposing any practice made unlawful under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe PWFA and the ADA also makes it illegal to interfere with rights under the PWFA and the ADA.\n\nLearn more about retaliation and interference.\n\nPregnancy & Other Workplace Laws\n\nPregnant workers and new parents may have additional rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Workers needing to express breast milk in the workplace may have additional rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Both of these laws are enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.\n\nSome state laws provide additional protections including accommodations for pregnant workers, unpaid and paid job-protected leave, protections from discrimination, and additional rights regarding lactation.\n\nWhat to Do If You Think You Experienced Discrimination\n\nIf you are a job applicant or an employee who believes that an employer has discriminated against you because of your pregnancy or your pregnancy-related disability, you can file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Learn more about filing a charge of discrimination."
