        "text": "Whether you've loved or hated the past year in entertainment, it must be said that great new love songs have come out of it. But, no offense to Harry Styles, none of them even remotely compare to all the '90s love songs we once listened to on repeat. From sappy pop hits to sexy R&B beats, the '90s produced a love ballad for pretty much everyone. And the best part? Most of the songs still slap. (Oh, and the music videos from this era are truly something else and will take your mind off of our current reality…if only for three minutes and 20 seconds.)\n\nIf you haven't noticed, the '90s are v much having a ~moment~ rn, with everything from '90s fashion trends to '90s beauty looks hitting the streets again. (Are we mad about it? Absolutely not.) But nothing will take you right back to the time before the new millennium quite like an older love song—except, perhaps, for a classic '90s rom-com. Here, we've ranked the 82 most banging '90s love songs for your listening pleasure. Get ready to feel like you're starring in a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie.\n\n82. \"You Make Me Wanna\" by Usher\n\nLet's face it: Usher can make anything sound romantic and sexy. Case in point: \"You Make Me Wanna,\" a hit single in which he declares that his friend is just so attractive and cool, she makes him want to dump his girlfriend. Modern romance!\n\n81. \"When She Loved Me\" by Sarah McLachlan\n\nYes, this song is technically about a doll realizing that her owner has outgrown her, but it will break your heart and stomp all over the pieces. And if that's not a true love song, I don't know what is.\n\n80. \"I Want You to Want Me\" by Letters to Cleo\n\nWho among us hasn't listened to \"I Want You to Want Me\" and danced around, pretending to be Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You? Just me? Well, you should really try it sometime.\n\n79. “I Want You Back” by NSYNC\n\nAs if this list would be complete without a friggin' NSYNC anthem. Girl, you thought. The boy band's most famous love ballads came out in the early 2000s, but that doesn't mean their more upbeat love songs, like \"I Want You Back,\" weren't just as swoon-inducing.\n\n78. \"Dreaming of You\" by Selena\n\nThere's just something so romantic and fantastical about \"Dreaming of You,\" it makes you want to fall in love immediately so that you can relate.\n\n77. “I Wanna Love You Forever\" by Jessica Simpson\n\nIn case you forgot about Jessica Simpson's career as a pop star, let me take you on a trip down memory lane with \"I Wanna Love You Forever,\" aka her cute lil' love song about how one lifetime isn't enough to love someone.\n\n76. “Baby, Baby” by Amy Grant\n\nIf you haven't heard \"Baby, Baby\" before, you deffinitely need to give it a listen. Not only is it so classically '90s, but the lyrics are adorable.\n\n75. “Weak” by SWV\n\nNever have I ever heard a song that so instantly made me think it belongs in a '90s rom com, because with R&B vocals as smooth as SWV's, it really, really does.\n\n74. “That’s The Way Love Goes” by Janet Jackson\n\nLeave it to Janet Jackson to make the chaos and intensity of falling in love sound smooth and light.\n\n73. “Sometimes” by Britney Spears\n\nA (kinda cheesy) pop love ballad sung by Britney Spears?? Yeah, I'll get that on repeat, thanks!\n\n72. “I Need You” by LeAnn Rimes\n\nLeAnn Rimes had one of the most distinct voices in the '90s country scene, and although this might not be her most well-known song, it's def worth a listen.\n\n71. “Right Here Waiting” by Richard Marx\n\nMan oh man does this have such a '90s love song vibe or what? When that chorus kicks in it's simply perfection.\n\n70. “You’re Makin’ Me High” by Toni Braxton\n\nYou know what this list needs? More Toni. Remember that feeling when you're so in love with someone that it feels like it feels like you're getting a high? Yeah, this song's about that.\n\n69. “From This Moment On” by Shania Twain\n\nThere's a reason that this song is still a veryyy popular wedding song choice. And why wouldn't it be?? Shania really knows how to belt out a love ballad.\n\n68. \"Lovefool\" by The Cardigans\n\nThis song is all about wanting someone to love us because life isn’t a picture-perfect rom-com all the time! Sorry! Plus, the music vid involves a man lost at sea and a note in a bottle. You just don’t get kitschy gold like that anymore, folks.\n\n67. \"I Don't Want to Wait\" by Paula Cole\n\nYes, this is the Dawson's Creek theme song, and yes, it is going to be stuck in your head for the rest of the day now.\n\n66. \"Amazed\" by Lonestar\n\n\"Every little thing that you do, baby, I'm amazed by you.\" —Us to our dogs.\n\n65. \"I Turn to You\" by Christina Aguilera\n\nWho knew our fave ~Dirrty~ girl could be such a softie?\n\n64. \"Have You Ever\" by Brandy\n\nAnyone who says they haven't related to this song at some point in their life is just lying to themselves, plain and simple.\n\n63. \"Diamonds and Pearls\" by Prince and The New Power Generation\n\nWhile we agree that diamonds and pearls aren't necessary to win our heart...we're not gonna lie: They definitely help.\n\n62. \"Always and Forever\" by Luther Vandross\n\nIf this song doesn't put a huge, dopey smile on your face, then you are clearly part android and we can't trust you.\n\n61. \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\" by Def Leppard\n\nThis one is dedicated to: the one that got away.\n\n60. \"Something to Talk About\" by Bonnie Raitt\n\nYa know when you're crushing hard on someone, and you have a feeling they're crushing hard on you, too, but you're just not sure? Yeah, Bonnie gets it.\n\n59. \"I'll Never Let You Go\" by Steelheart\n\nIf you've never heard of glam-metal band Steelheart, it's probs because their 1990 hit \"I'll Never Let You Go\" was a one-hit wonder—but at least it's a good one!\n\n58. \"I Love the Way You Love Me\" by John Michael Montgomery\n\nIs this song cheesy as hell? Ofc it is. But that's what makes it so romantic!! (And tbh, it deserves more attention.)\n\n57. \"Now and Forever\" by Richard Marx\n\nIn need of wedding vows? Just borrow some lyrics from Richard Marx's weepy '90s love ballad. We're sure he won't mind.\n\n56. \"When You Love a Woman\" by Journey\n\nHere's the thing: If someone were to ever serenade us with this song, we'd probs marry them on the spot, no questions asked. Just saying.\n\n55. \"Back at One\" by Brian McKnight\n\nWho knew that presenting a logical argument in numbered form could sound so romantic??\n\n54. \"She in Love With the Boy\" by Trisha Yearwood\n\nOkay, but this isn't just a classic '90s country love song. It's a whole damn love story.\n\n53. \"Love Is All Around\" by Wet Wet Wet\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think of Four Weddings and a Funeral when they hear this song, and those who think of Billy Mack's Christmas-themed version from Love Actually when they hear this song.\n\n52. \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" by En Vogue\n\nWhen En Vogue sang about lovemaking, heartbreaking, and soul shaking, we FELT that.\n\n51. \"It Must Have Been Love\" by Roxette\n\nUgh. If this one doesn't wrench your heart right TF open, then we don't know what will.\n\n50. \"November Rain\" by Guns N' Roses\n\nPro tip: This song is best enjoyed while sipping a glass of Cab by the light of a flickering candle.\n\n49. \"Always\" by Bon Jovi\n\n\"I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine, 'til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme, and I know when I die, you'll be on my mind.\" The drama!!\n\n48. \"It's Your Love\" by Tim McGraw\n\nEven if you're not a country person, it's impossible to resist the sweetness of this song, agreed?\n\n47. \"Nobody's Supposed to Be Here\" by Deborah Cox\n\nSometimes, love finds you when ya least expect it, and no one sums up that feeling quite like Canadian songstress Deborah Cox.\n\n46. \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor\n\nNothing compares to your first love, y'all. *Sigh.*\n\n45. \"No Ordinary Love\" by Sade\n\nNot only is this song a total mood—the music video is a legit masterpiece. Sade Adu running through city streets in a two-piece wedding dress? ICONIQUE.\n\n44. \"I Live My Life for You\" by FireHouse\n\nThe song title kinda says it all, no?\n\n43. \"I Swear\" by All-4-One\n\nEven if you don't *think* you know this one, we can assure you that you most definitely do.\n\n42. \"At Your Best (You Are Love)\" by Aaliyah\n\nIt's been decades years since Aaliyah tragically passed away, but this gorgeous love ballad continues to live on.\n\n41. \"You Were Meant for Me\" by Jewel\n\nIntroducing: the best drunk karaoke ballad of all time.\n\n40. \"Love Like This\" by Faith Evans\n\nThere's no denying it: This song crushed when it first came out in 1998, and it still crushes just as hard today.\n\n39. “Can’t Stop Loving You” by Van Halen\n\nNo one wants to hear someone say, \"Yeah, I might stop loving you one day.\" Enter this song, which is the exact opposite of that. It’s basically a wedding vow, saying that love will persist through thick and thin.\n\n38. “More Than Words” by Extreme\n\nEssentially, this song brings us back to the good ol’ actions speak louder than words concept. The track pretty much encapsulates every love language except for words of affirmation, obvi, with an emphasis on quality time and physical touch.\n\n37. “Only Wanna Be With You” by Hootie and the Blowfish\n\nWho wouldn’t want to be told they’re the only one? That’s the main thing you need in a relationship, right? Doesn't seem like too much to ask.\n\n36. “I’ll Make Love To You” by Boyz ll Men\n\nClearly, this is a song you want to have on your sex playlist, but, BUT, it's also super romantic because anyone who calls sex \"making love\" only does that if they're in love. Presumably, that is. Or they think it's what their partner wants to hear. Who knows?\n\n35. “There She Goes” by The La’s\n\nHonestly, this song doesn’t have many lyrics to unpack—it’s straight to the point and basically the ‘90s version of saying your crush lives in your mind rent free. The lyrics literally say “there she goes again, racing through my brain” practically on repeat. And it brings back mems of The Parent Trap, so points for that.\n\n34. “Wonderwall” by Oasis\n\nDo we even need to explain this one? K, fine, for the people in the back, we'll do it with maybe the most relatable lyric in the song: “There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how.”\n\n33. “I’ll Be” by Edwin McCain\n\nIf you don’t immediately think of that one scene in A Cinderella Story when Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray are dancing when you hear this song, we can’t be friends.\n\n32. “If You Had My Love” by Jennifer Lopez\n\nJ.Lo perfectly exemplifies how to lay down the law in this epic bop. She’s not taking any BS–no lies, no cheating, and especially no fake love. There’s no time to waste, and unnecessary pain can be avoided once you weed out the weak links with basic and decent requests.\n\n31. “Friday I’m in Love” by The Cure\n\nTell us the first few beats of this song don’t pump you up and make you want to scream-sing the entirety of the lyrics once they start. It perfectly captures a love for both Fridays and being in love on a Friday—an intoxicating combo.\n\n30. “2 Become 1” by Spice Girls\n\nIt’s a sappy Spice Girls song about ~making love~ with someone you’re super into for the first time. Need we say more?\n\n29. “Angel of Mine” by Monica\n\nWe're 110 percent convinced that we have this song to thank for the “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” pick-up line, but we won’t hold that against it because this song undeniably still slaps. It covers every aspect of the fairytale love story, from knowing they were right for you from the start to them having your back through thick and thin. Cute, right?\n\n28. “Because of You” by 98 Degrees\n\n98 Degrees' first major hit was a love ballad—surprise, surprise—with a ridiculously catchy chorus that you can't help but bop along with.\n\n27. “I Wanna Grow Old With You” by Adam Sandler\n\nIf you’ve seen The Wedding Singer, you know why this song is a total tear-jerker. If you haven’t, let's put it like this: Imagine the dude you love writing a song about wanting to spend the rest of his life growing old with you. (And the song was actually v cute and really good.)\n\n26. “Un-Break My Heart” by Toni Braxton\n\nOkay, this song is technically about heartbreak, but there’s something so romantic about the fact that the only person who can un-break Toni’s heart is the one who broke it in the first place. Don’t you wish your ex was bumping this about you right now? Actually, forget wishing they would do this—let’s just pretend they for sure are.\n\n25. \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye\" by Boyz II Men\n\nLet's be honest, this entire list could just be Boyz II Men songs. The harmonies, the heartbreak, and did I mention the harmonies?\n\n24. “Head Over Feet” by Alanis Morissette\n\nYes, it first came out decades ago. But with lyrics like “You treat me like I’m a princess, I'm not used to liking that,” we think anyone with a low-key f*ckboy addiction will agree it’s still v relatable.\n\n23. “As Long As You Love Me” by Backstreet Boys\n\nYou know when it’s 2 a.m. and the bar’s about to close, and you’re wondering why the hell that hottie who made eyes at you when you first walked in still hasn’t talked to you? This song is basically, like, a way more romantic version of that.\n\n22. “I Love You (Always Forever)” by Donna Lewis\n\nWe love this song because it can relate to more than one love of your life. In other words, you can relate it to the love you feel about your BF and the love you feel for your BFF. Versatile!\n\n21. “Truly, Madly, Deeply” by Savage Garden\n\nDare you to listen to this song and not feel like you’re suddenly starring in the happy ending of your very own ‘90s rom-com and Freddie Prinze Jr. is going to sensually take your glasses off any minute now. DARE YOU!\n\n20. “Crash Into Me” by Dave Matthews Band\n\nThis is more than just a romantic song. This is a quintessential sex song and probably the most bang-able song on this list. Play it and make some love, sweet love, ‘90s style. Might we suggest you dress as Pam Anderson and your suitor dress as Tommy Lee?\n\n19. “I Can Love You Like That” by All-4-One\n\nWe dedicate this song to you when the lame AF boys on Hinge aren’t impressing you with their Office pick-up lines. Let this song remind you of the sort of love you deserve.\n\n18. “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” by Elton John\n\nThis is a great song to play when you’re feeling hopeless that the whole love thing is never going to happen to you. With lyrics like “There’s a time for everyone,” it’s reassuring AF. Oh, and it’s also one of the greatest songs in Disney history, so this one gets an A+ from us.\n\n17. “All My Life” by K-Ci & JoJo\n\nNext time you get home from yet another subpar Tinder date, play this song and tell yourself that your dream person just got home from their own subpar Tinder date and is sitting there wondering when they're going to meet a bomb AF person like you.\n\n16. “I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing” by Aerosmith\n\nOkay, so this guy literally doesn’t want to fall asleep because he’s worried about missing you. Normally, we'd think that’s clingy AF. But this song is such a jam that it somehow makes it cute. Also, if you’re not requesting this song at the club around 2 a.m., WYD?\n\n15. “My Love Is Your Love” by Whitney Houston\n\nA good ‘90s love song makes you want to do a lot of things (e.g., make out, have sex, and/or get chased by a hottie who’s in love with you at the airport), but it doesn’t usually make you want to get on the dance floor and break it down. This one does.\n\n14. “When A Man Loves a Woman” by Michael Bolton\n\nThis song rules, because it sets some seriously high standards. If your ~lover~ doesn’t do everything this song says (put you on a pedestal, stick up for you to their friends, shower you with gifts, etc.), SEND 'EM BACK.\n\n13. “How Do I Live” by LeAnn Rimes\n\nYou know when you’re the absolute worst version of yourself crying to your best friend in a bar bathroom about how your crush hasn’t texted you yet and you literally might die if they ghost you? This song somehow takes that emotion and turns it into a super-beautiful song.\n\n12. “Kiss Me” by Sixpence None the Richer\n\nNo matter how old you are, this song is guaranteed to make you feel like you’re back in middle school swinging on the swing trying to seductively make eyes at your crush the way you saw Carrie do to Big that one time your older sister let you watch Sex and the City with her.\n\n11. “(Everything I Do) I Do It For You” by Bryan Adams\n\nThe title of this song says it all. Everything this dude does, he does for the woman he loves. That’s the kind of devotion we all deserve, tbqh.\n\n10. “Iris” by Goo Goo Dolls\n\n“Iris” literally has a dude saying he would “give up forever to touch you,” so, um, yeah it’s obviously romantic AF—oh, and peak '90s goals.\n\n9. “This Kiss” by Faith Hill\n\nThis song is obvi called “This Kiss,” but it’s about way more than that. It’s about having a fireworks-level connection with someone, who you just so happen to have fab sexual chemistry with (aka the dream). Oh, we also dare you to play it in the car and not wind up screaming the lyrics to yourself at the top of your lungs because, well, it happens.\n\n8. “Kiss from a Rose” by Seal\n\nNGL, we still have no idea what “I’ve been kissed by a rose on the gray” even means, but w/e!!\n\n7. “I’ll Stand By You” by The Pretenders\n\nThe best part of being in a relationship is having someone who will have your back through all of the absolute worst moments life throws your way. This song is about exactly that. And it will probs make you cry, even if it’s your 100th time listening to it.\n\n6. “Have I Told You Lately” by Rod Stewart\n\nIf you’ve been feeling single AF lately, give this song a little listen. It’s not exactly the person you’ve been seeing without a label for six months telling you they want to be official, but Rod Stewart telling you he loves you can be oddly reassuring.\n\n5. “My Heart Will Go On” by Celine Dion\n\nThis song is so timelessly romantic that they made it the theme song for Titanic…aka one of the most romantic movies of all time. Don’t really think we need to elaborate much outside of that, right?\n\n4. “Always Be My Baby” by Mariah Carey\n\nWith lyrics like “You can’t escape me” and “You’re never gonna shake me,” MiMi masterfully manages to take all of the thoughts of your most psycho post-breakup self and turn them into a legitimately romantic song that seriously gets your heart pumpin.'\n\n3. “You’re Still the One” by Shania Twain\n\nHot take: Shania walked so T-Swift could run.\n\n2. “Because You Loved Me” by Celine Dion\n\nFreakin’ duh this song was going to make the top two. She's *everything* she is because he loved her. He was her strength when she was weak! Her voice when she couldn’t speak! (Okay, we'll stop quoting the song and let you listen.)\n\n1. “I Will Always Love You” by Whitney Houston\n\nThis. Freaking. Song. Envision the love of your life and sing it at the top of your lungs next time you do karaoke and tell us it’s not the greatest love song of all time. Because it is, and it's ranked number one. You honestly can’t even argue either, sorry."
