We use no one more than nobody in writing:\n\nI knew nobody at the party.\n\nNo one moved; no one said anything.\n\nWe write no one as two separate words or with a hyphen: no one or no-one but not noone.\n\nNobody or not … anybody, etc.\n\nNobody, no one, nothing, nowhere are stronger and more definite than not … anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere:\n\nI did nothing. (stronger than I didn’t do anything.)\n\nShe told no one, not even her mother. (stronger than She didn’t tell anyone …)\n\nWe don’t use not + anyone/anything/anywhere as the subject of a clause:\n\nNothing will make me change my mind.\n\nNot: Not anything will make me change my mind.\n\nWe don’t use nobody, no one, nothing, nowhere after no, not, never or other words which have a negative meaning (hardly, seldom). We use anyone, anybody, anything, anywhere:\n\nI can’t do anything.\n\nNot: I can’t do nothing.\n\nShe talks to hardly anyone.\n\nNot: She talks to hardly no one."
