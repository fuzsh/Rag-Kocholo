        "text": "The City of New York will auction vehicles that have been seized or abandoned.\n\nThe vehicle’s owner must pay all tickets that are in judgment, plus penalties and interest, to redeem the vehicle. Vehicles are sold at auction if they are not redeemed within 10 business days of being towed.\n\nProceeds from the auction, after expenses, are used to pay the judgment debt. All vehicles are sold \"as is” and the purchaser must pick them up where they are located.\n\nUpcoming Auction(s):\n\nAugust 14, 2024 - Bronx\n\nAugust 15, 2024 - Bronx\n\nAugust 15, 2024 - Queens\n\nAugust 16, 2024 - Bronx\n\nAugust 16, 2024-2 - Bronx\n\nAugust 16, 2024 - Brooklyn\n\nAugust 16, 2024 - Queens\n\nAugust 21, 2024 - Queens\n\nAugust 22, 2024 - Bronx\n\nAugust 23, 2024 - Brooklyn\n\nAugust 26, 2024 - Bronx\n\nBidding on a vehicle\n\nBe sure you know the lot number of the vehicle you’d like to bid on.\n\nVehicles are sold to the highest bidder.\n\nIf there is a dispute about the highest bid between two or more bidders, the bidding process will begin again.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office may refuse any bid and cancel the sale at any time.\n\nAfter you have purchased a vehicle at auction\n\nYou must pay with cash in full as soon as the sale is final. We will waive the sales tax if you present a resale certificate.\n\nIn many cases, you may need to tow the auctioned vehicles from the yard. Vehicle keys are not available.\n\nYou must remove the vehicle from the tow yard by 5:00 p.m. on the day of the auction or you will be charged a storage fee of $20 per day. If you do not take the vehicle within 96 hours of 5:00 p.m. of the auction date, it will be considered abandoned and will be removed.\n\nOnce you remove a vehicle from the tow yard, you cannot park it on the street or drive it unless the owner has proper registration and license plates.\n\nYou must take the Certificate of Sale to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get a title issued in your name. We only issue one certificate of sale per owner – no exceptions. We cannot issue duplicates for second copies or replacements of the original.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles may consider the vehicle as salvage. This means the vehicle may have to be examined before a new title or registration is issued.\n\nThe tow yard may charge a tow fee to remove a purchased vehicle from the yard.\n\nProperty auctions\n\nThe Sheriff may sell real or personal property to satisfy an unpaid judgment. This is known as a “private asset auction.”\n\nAuction dates are advertised in New York City newspapers and posted in each county's Sheriff's and county clerk offices. The money from the auction goes to the creditor.\n\nSale of real property\n\nAt an auction, the successful bidder must pay at least 1O percent of the bid price (not less than $2,000). Cash, money orders, and certified checks are accepted for payment. A Memorandum of Sale is issued immediately.\n\nIf partial payment is made at the auction, the balance of the bid price must be paid no later than three business days after the auction.\n\nIf the successful bidder does not pay the balance within three business days, the sale will be voided and the property re-sold.\n\nA successful bidder who fails to comply with the terms of the sale may be liable for damages to the judgment creditor.\n\nAny taxes or transfer/delivery fees must be paid by the bidder.\n\nThe Sheriff reserves the right to approve or deny all bids.\n\nSale of personal property\n\nPayments must be made in cash.\n\nThe Sheriff sells the right, title, and interest only.\n\nThe Sheriff reserves the right of approval on all bids.\n\nUpcoming property auctions\n\nNew York County Sheriff Auction - September 8, 2021\n\nVehicle auctions — frequently asked questions"
