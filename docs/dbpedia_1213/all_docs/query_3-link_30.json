It is not necessary for you to obtain a new certificate of title removing your previous lienholder. You may keep the stamped paid certificate of title from your lienholder and use this title for future sale or transfer of the vehicle.\n\nPlease note: Connecticut does not participate in any electronic title or electronic lien holder programs.\n\nRequesting a title record/history\n\nA title search will verify who the current titled owner of record of a motor vehicle is in the State of Connecticut. If you want more information, such as odometer readings or a complete ownership history on record, then note it in Section 3 (Miscellaneous Request) of a Title Copy Records Request (form J-23T).\n\nStep 1: Gather what you’ll need:\n\nComplete a title copy records request Form J-23T to request a title search.

Instead, request a photocopy of the cancelled title. Requesting a certified copy will cost an additional $20.)\n\nAdditional title information\n\nRecently applied for titles\n\nWhen a title isn’t needed\n\nOwnership transfer in absence of a title\n\nAdditional lienholder information\n\nDefinition of a joint or common ownership\n\nBranded titles (legends)\n\nTitle information by state\n\nRecently applied for titles\n\nTitles will be issued about 30 days from the registration date.\n\nWho receives the title?\n\nIf there is no lien on the title, the title will be mailed to the new owner (the name that appears on the registration).\n\nIf there is a lien on the title, the title is mailed to the lienholder.\n\nWill the CT DMV accept an electronic title?\n\nWe do not participate in any electronic title or electronic lien holder programs and are unable to receive an electronic title or lienholder record.\n\nA lot of time has passed, and I haven’t received my title. What should I do?\n\nYou have 90 days from the transaction date to re-apply for a title at no cost. Please fill out a statement of non-receipt of title and mail it to:\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\n\nRoom 305, Specialized Registry Services\n\n60 State Street\n\nWethersfield, CT 06161\n\nOnce the form is received, we will verify if you’re eligible to receive a title at no fee. The process will take about 30 days.\n\nWhen a title isn’t needed\n\nTitles aren’t required in all circumstances. Exceptions include:\n\nVehicles more than 20 model years old. This letter can be used as proof of title exemption\n\nSpecial mobile equipment\n\nAny trailer having a gross weight not in excess of 3,000 lbs.\n\nA snowmobile or ATV\n\nVessels older than the year 2017.\n\nAdditional information can be found online or by calling 860-263-5710.\n\nOwnership transfer in absence of a title\n\nIf your title has been misplaced and you are selling your vehicle to a Connecticut resident:\n\nFill out Application for Replacement Certificate of Title (Form H-6B).\n\nComplete an Original Connecticut DMV Supplemental Assignment of Ownership Form (Q1 Form).\n\nThe transfer of ownership won’t be valid unless the Supplemental Assignment of Ownership (Q1 Form) is completed. Additionally, the lien release letter needs to be provided if the lienholder is listed on the title.\n\nAdditional lienholder information\n\nYou need to get a lien release letter from your loan company. The letter should be on loan institution letterhead. Information and must include owner(s) name, vehicle description: year, make, identification number, state the loan has been paid in full or there is no interest in the vehicle and signed by authorized agent.\n\nIf the loan is more than ten years old, and you are unable to obtain a lien release, please complete section 2 on the H6B form. (Lien status for lien over 10 years old)(e.g., out of business, change name, etc.), the Motor Vehicle Ownership Affidavit (Form H-115) can be completed in lieu of the lien release.\n\nThe legal representative must provide documentation (e.g., power of attorney or probate with proper identification required).\n\nDefinition of a joint or common ownership\n\nJoint ownership is characterized by the right of survivorship. When a Certificate of Title is in two names and one owner dies, the surviving owner would acquire the interest of the deceased owner. Joint ownership is identified by use of the conjunction or. Both owners are required to sign the original Application for Registration and Title (form H-13B). However, only one signature is required to change ownership of this vehicle.\n\nExample of Joint ownership: John Jones or Mary Jones.\n\nCommon ownership is characterized by the lack of the right of survivorship. Upon the death of one of two owners of a motor vehicle, the Probate Court will appoint a fiduciary (Administrator or Executor) to convey the deceased owner’s interest. A copy of the probate document will be required and should be attached to the Certificate of Title. In those cases where the estate of the decedent falls within certain monetary limits, the court may authorize the transfer of the deceased owner’s interest by letter. In this instance, a copy of the letter should be attached to the Certificate of Title. Common ownership is identified by use of the conjunction and. Both owners are required to sign the original Application for Registration and Title (form H-13B), as well as all future transactions for this vehicle, unless probate documents are shown as mentioned above.\n\nExample of Common ownership: John Jones and Mary Jones.\n\nWhen there isn't a conjunction listed either party can transfer ownership; only one signature is required.\n\nTo transfer ownership on a titled vessel, signatures from both owners are required regardless of conjunction.\n\nBranded titles (legends)\n\nLegends are used when a title is branded based on previous title history. Here are the different types of legends that may appear when making an inquiry.\n\nRebuilt:\n\nThis vehicle has gone through a salvage inspection after the vehicle has been declared a total loss and the title has been stamped salvage by an insurance company.\n\nThis is a duplicate title and may be subject to the rights of a person under the original certificate:\n\nThe customer has lost the original title and has been issued a duplicate title.\n\nThis vehicle may be subject to undisclosed lien:\n\nThis legend is recorded when the vehicle was either last registered in a state that doesn’t title that model year vehicle or a state in which the title is not the exclusive means of recording a lien on a motor vehicle.\n\nBond posted under section 14-176 C.G.S.:\n\nCustomer did not have necessary documents for proof of ownership and a surety bond was required to protect the State of Connecticut against any ownership claims.\n\nGlider kit:\n\nThe vehicle was constructed from kit.\n\nTrue mileage unknown:\n\nMileage was not submitted at time title was applied for. May also indicate some discrepancy in the odometer reading.\n\nManufacturers buyback:\n\nVehicle was returned to manufacturer by previous owner.\n\nFlood:\n\nVehicle has sustained flood damage and has been declared a loss by an insurance company.\n\nOdometer exceeds mechanical limits:\n\nThe odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of its mechanical limits. (The odometer started at zero again).\n\nWarning odometer discrepancy:\n\nThe odometer does not reflect the actual mileage.\n\nSalvage\n\nWhen a vehicle has been declared a total loss by an insurance company. It is illegal to operate this vehicle upon any road in Connecticut.\n\nNot actual mileage\n\nThis when a vehicle odometer reading cannot be determined.\n\nTitle information by state\n\nState (State with asterisk are not all titled) Type of vehicle Title boats?

The system allows for the vehicle titling history to be accessible to motor vehicle departments and consumers to verify key vehicle titling information, such as Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), odometer information and state \"brand\" information describing the vehicle's current or prior condition, such as \"junk,\" \"salvage,\" or \"flood.\" With the implementation of NMVTIS, Connecticut will be able to verify a vehicle title by immediately checking electronically against the titling history of approximately 81 percent of the motor vehicles in the U.S. If the information returned by NMVTIS raises any questions, the vehicle will not be titled until further research is conducted to mitigate the potential for fraud.\n\nNMVTIS is a major step forward in helping to prevent vehicle titling fraud. For more information on the benefits of NMVTIS, read the Frequently Asked Questions | NMVTIS.\n\nFor more information about NMVTIS, visit NMVTIS Homepage."
