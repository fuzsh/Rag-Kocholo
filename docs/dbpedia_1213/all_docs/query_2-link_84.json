        "text": "When a friend or loved one has cancer you may wonder how best to help and support them.\n\nAt first you might feel unsure about what to say or do, being open and sensitive to how they are feeling is what most people need. Knowing you are there for them can really help.\n\nEvery person with cancer has a different experience so try not to assume how they might be feeling. They may feel happy one day and sad the next. Try to be mindful of their mood.\n\nRemember that they might not want to talk or think about their cancer all of the time. Having a normal conversation about everyday things and sharing a joke can sometimes be very welcome.\n\nTry not to take it personally if they don’t want to talk about their cancer and respect their need for privacy or to have some quiet time.\n\nThis video has tips from people with cancer about talking to someone with cancer. It lasts for 54 seconds.\n\nThe emotions they might feel\n\nYou might find that their mood changes from one moment to the next. This is a normal response to a diagnosis of cancer. There are a whole range of emotions that they might experience including:\n\nanger\n\nsadness\n\nuncertainty\n\nfear\n\nguilt\n\nfrustration\n\nloneliness\n\nisolation\n\nresentment\n\ngrief\n\nAn understanding of these emotions can help you to support them.\n\nWe have a section all about cancer and emotions, which you may want to look at.\n\nEmotional support\n\nResearch has shown that emotional support from family and friends can make a big difference to the quality of life of someone with cancer.\n\nPeople are often afraid of saying the wrong thing to someone with cancer. If you are open, honest and show your concern then you can be a great support. Here are some tips that might help you.\n\nDo:\n\nSay if you feel awkward – it acknowledges the situation rather than pretending it’s not happening.\n\nGive them a friendly hand squeeze or hug – it can go a long way.\n\nRing them up, send a card, note or text to say you’re thinking of them.\n\nLet them know that if they want to talk you’ll be there to listen - then make sure you are available.\n\nListen actively and without judgement.\n\nRespect their need for privacy.\n\nOffer support throughout the whole diagnosis - at the beginning, during and after treatment.\n\nShare a joke or laugh with them if this seems appropriate.\n\nKeep your relationship as normal and as balanced as possible.\n\nTake them for a coffee or a short walk (if it seems appropriate), being outside in nature can help.\n\nTry not to:\n\nSay you know how they feel – we can’t ever know exactly how someone with cancer feels.\n\nTell them to ‘be strong’ or ‘be positive’ or 'fight it' – it puts pressure on them to behave a certain way.\n\nTake things personally if they seem angry or upset or don’t want to talk.\n\nOffer advice that they haven’t asked for.\n\nCompare their situation to somebody else you know, each person’s experience with cancer is unique.\n\nBeing a good listener\n\nA good listener tries to be aware of someone’s thoughts and feelings as much as they can. You don’t need to have all the answers. Just listening to a person’s concerns or worries can be hugely helpful.\n\nA good listener tries to really tune in and listen to a person in the moment. Listening is an important part of providing emotional support.\n\nHere are some tips on how to listen well.\n\nTry to keep the setting private, relaxed and with few distractions.\n\nMaintain eye contact but don’t stare.\n\nLet the person with cancer lead the conversation and try not to interrupt. You can nod or smile to show you are listening.\n\nGive your full attention to what they are saying.\n\nIf you’re finding it difficult or upsetting don’t change the subject – say how you feel, this can prevent any awkwardness.\n\nIf they cry, don’t try to cheer them up. Reassure them that it’s OK to be sad and that it’s a normal response to what’s happening to them.\n\nA friendly touch of the hand can help but if they pull away give them space.\n\nTry not to give advice unless they have asked for it.\n\nDon’t use humour unless they have used it themselves.\n\nSilences are OK, don’t feel like you have to fill them with words.\n\nWalking outdoors, side by side can often encourage an open and relaxed conversation.\n\nThis video has top tips from people affected by cancer on how to listen to someone with cancer. It is 54 seconds long.\n\nPractical support\n\nAs well as supporting someone emotionally it can help to offer practical support too.\n\nCheck in with your friend or loved one and ask if there is anything specific that they need help with.\n\nSome people don’t want help or they may find it hard to accept it. They might want to remain as independent as possible. Try not to take this personally. Respect their decision but let them know that if they change their mind you are there.\n\nYou could offer to help again in the future, or set up a rota so that you and friends can take it in turns to help out. Make sure that you are able to commit to any offers of help that you do make.\n\nHere are some practical ideas:\n\nmake some meals that they can put in the freezer\n\noffer to do some gardening\n\ndrive them to the hospital for blood tests and appointments\n\nhelp with the cleaning or laundry\n\ntake any pets for a walk or to the vet\n\noffer to do the shopping\n\nreturn or pick up library books\n\noffer to take the children to and from school\n\nbring them lunch and stay for a chat\n\nrun any errands that they might need doing\n\nask before you visit, in case they are feeling too unwell\n\noffer to pick up any medicine that has been prescribed"
