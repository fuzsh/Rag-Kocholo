        "text": "What documents do I need to update after a name change?\n\nChanging your legal name does not automatically update your IDs, bank accounts, or any other records. You will need to inform various agencies and organizations of your new name. You must:\n\napply for a replacement Texas driver's license or ID within 30 days of the name change; and\n\nget an updated Social Security card as soon as possible. Your Social Security number (SSN) will stay the same, but updating your legal name is essential for employment, benefits, and taxes.\n\nYou will also need to update your passport, green card, and other documents as needed. Depending on your situation, you may also need to inform certain people and other organizations. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nyour employer\n\na child's school or daycare\n\nfinancial institutions\n\ninsurance companies\n\nsocial services\n\nhealthcare providers\n\nHow do I update my documents with different organizations?\n\nEach institution will have their own policies for updating names and the proof you'll need to present. In most cases, submitting a name-changing court order or a certified copy of your marriage license will be enough. Specifics will depend on the organization's policies and the type of name change.\n\nLinks with instructions for updating common state and federal documents are listed below."
