        "text": "When you schedule an office visit, you will be able to select a time and day convenient for you.\n\nWe recommend scheduling a visit, so you can be served on time and be back on your way in about 20 minutes. When you schedule a visit, the system will walk you through everything you need to bring with you for your transaction, helping you to avoid having to make a return visit.\n\nVisits may be scheduled up to six months in advance. To schedule your visit, visit Online Services or call 888-SOS-MICH (888-767-6424).\n\nIf youâ€™re unable to schedule a visit, you can stop by an office and staff will serve you if there is availability, invite you to wait or return for the next opening the same day, or assist you in scheduling a visit convenient for you, often for the next day.\n\nOffices are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time (8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time) on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time (10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Central Time) on Wednesday. Some offices may close for lunch or may only be open on certain weekdays. All offices are closed on state holidays. On the first Thursday of each month, offices don't open until 10 a.m. Eastern Time (9 a.m. Central Time)."
