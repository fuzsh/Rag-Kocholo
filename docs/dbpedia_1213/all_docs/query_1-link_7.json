        "text": "When Taylor Swift has just introduced 31 brand new songs to the world, as she did in April with the deluxe double-album that is “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,” it may be a fool’s errand to immediately assess where where all that fresh grist fits into the overall scope of her catalog. Foolish, and also irresistible. Angels roll their eyes, but anyone who considers her one of pop history’s great songwriters — on top of being one of the most prolific — can’t help getting a quick start on contextualizing where brilliant new songs like “The Black Dog,” “How Did It End?,” “loml,” “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me” and “Down Bad” will ultimately be seen as sitting alongside “Dear John,” “Clean,” “Cardigan” and “New Romantics.” So never mind if it took the world a few years to catch on en masse to the classic that is “Cruel Summer” and finally chart-certify its greatness. She’s the kind of artist who makes you want to certify new classic in the moment.\n\nWith that in mind, I’m updating my previous list of Taylor Swift’s 50 Best Songs, first published shortly after the release of “Midnights” in late 2022, to expand the ranking to 75, including 11 of the 31 songs from “Tortured Poets Department” and tossing in a few oldies that were previously left out besides. I haven’t messed with the order of the previously included songs too much; that is to say, I haven’t given in to the peer pressure to make “All Too Well (10-Minute Version)” No. 1, even though docking it even as far down as No. 2 is just asking to get pilloried. (Trust me, at any given hour of the day, I will agree that “ATW10” is the best song of the last 20 years… but then, on a moment’s whim, you might catch me saying that about the other three dozen top songs on this list, too.) So here we go — out of the roughly 260 original songs that Swift has released, here is a very studied ranking of the 75 best. Are you ready for it?"
