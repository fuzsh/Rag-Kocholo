To celebrate the launch of WORLDS - PART I, we are launching No Man's Sky's ninth Twitch Drops event. Twitch Drops are free items awarded to players for watching selected streams on Twitch.tv.

Simply link your Steam, PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo account to your Twitch account using the links below then sit back and enjoy any of the No Manâ€™s Sky streamers with Drops Enabled from Thursday 18th to Monday 22nd July. See below for more details.

Unlocked rewards should be claimed on Twitch within 24 hours. They can then be found in-game in the Quicksilver store aboard the Space Anomaly, which is summonable on your first sojourn into space after you have established your first base.

Players can earn rewards on Twitch before downloading version 5.0 of the game, but will need to download the update to redeem them in-game.
