Dear Friend and Fellow Soujourner,

We hope this letter finds you well. We invite you to an exciting event today: NU BREED Day of Faith. The event will occur at Port Naz, located at 2005 W Olive Avenue, Porterville, CA 93257, starting at 9 AM.

At NU BREED, we believe in the power of community and the exploration of faith. Our Day of Faith is an opportunity to unite as a community and embark on an adventure of discovering and deepening our faith. It is a place where you can truly belong, be embraced with love, and your voice will be heard and valued.

Upon arriving at the event, our warm and welcoming NU BREED family will wait at the front entrance to greet and guide you to your selected seating. We want to ensure that you are seated near friends and familiar faces so you can enjoy the day together.

We firmly believe that the relationships we build and nurture throughout our lives are the most valuable treasures we possess. The people we choose to do life with shape us, support us, and create a sense of belonging. At NU BREED, we strive to create a space where you can connect with like-minded individuals who share your faith journey.

We would be honored to have you join us at NU BREED Day of Faith. It promises to be a day filled with inspiration, spiritual growth, and the joy of community.
