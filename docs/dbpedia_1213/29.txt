Netflix original TV shows and movies are typically released globally at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

Find these titles by looking for the red “N” on the title’s artwork. You can also search for “Netflix” to see them all, or visit netflix.com/originals.

Some Netflix titles are originals in one country but not in another. In that case, the title usually follows this schedule:

Title is an original in your country (has a red "N" on the title artwork): available at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time

Title is not an original in your country: available at 12:00 a.m. local time

Note:

This may vary for episodes that are released weekly or that follow their original broadcast airing.

You may need to refresh your browser, reload the Netflix app, or restart your device and relaunch Netflix to watch a newly released title.

Though there is no set schedule, we’re always adding new titles for our members to enjoy.
