with the past. But this is the link of superposed plates of our memory. In a cultural context with aspirations to universality, in which the individual seems to have won the ﬁght with his own memory, living only in the present and future, there is a risk that superﬁcial perceptions may substitute themselves for more profound forms of knowledge. In the landscape of the global world, ‘Romania’ is vaguely, confusedly or conﬂictingly identiﬁed, as are most small and medium-sized countries. Romania is at the same time an imagined reality and a real country, populated by people with qualities and defects. Romania’s recent history is not a positive or negative exceptionalism, but is the sum of tragic or fortunate experiences. The temptation to answer the Great Questions such as ‘What is Romania?’ (Boia 2001: 7) or ‘What are Romanians?’ with the methods of social psychology (Drăghicescu 1996) is risky, as it involves the danger of uncertain generalizations. The ambition to ﬁnd the Great Explanation for long-term processes such as modernization (Vlăsceanu and Hâncean 2014) can prove scientiﬁcally imprudent, as factors such as ‘time’ and ‘historical context’ are expelled in order to allow generalizations intended to superﬁcially validate grandiose theories. Historians know that facts, or rather their documentary representations, are hard to establish and control in a causal relation. Prudence and gnoseological scepticism are the predominant attributes of the historian. That is why I am not venturing in search of some ‘total’ or ‘ultimate’ explanation of Romania’s recent history. My purpose is more modest: to answer the question ‘What important events happened in Romania after the Second World War?’ Of course, following the evaluation of the facts, partial answers also emerge concerning the Great Questions such as ‘What is Romania?’ and ‘What are Romanians?’ My undertaking does not unfold on an empty ﬁeld. The subject of Romania’s history after the Second World War is present in the specialized literature in English. Valuable studies about Romania were published in the West starting in the communist period (Ionescu 1964; King 1980; Shaﬁr 1985; Turnock 1986; Gilberg 1990), but these are inevitably obsolete due to the ‘historiography revolution’ that resulted from the opening of the archives. After the fall of communism, histories of political life during communism were published (Tismăneanu 2003) as well as several other monographic studies around various issues (Verdery 1995; Kligman 1998; Kligman and Verdery 2011; Stan 2013; Stan and Turcescu 2007; Deletant 1999; Leuştean 2008). The scholarly literature on the 1989 Revolution (Siani-Davies 2005; Roper 2000) and the transition period, especially with regard to political (Gallagher 2005, 2009; Light and Phinnemore 2001) or economic 1\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\n(Cernat 2006) aspects is vast. This is not the place for an exhaustive bibliographic inventory. Individual (Georgescu 1990; Fischer-Galati 1991) or collective (Giurescu and FischerGalati 1998; Giurescu 2013) eﬀorts to oﬀer works of synthesis on Romania’s history are praiseworthy. The most recent synthesis of Romania’s history (Hitchins 2014) undoubtedly represents a valuable contribution, but by its conception is limited to general aspects. Another attempt at synthesis in French concerning the transition period (Petre and Durandin 2008) mainly approaches political aspects. Until the present book, a history of Romania including communism and the transition period alike and not limited to political or economic aspects or to particular aspects of socio-cultural life was missing. My undertaking seeks to ﬁll a gap in the historiography concerning Romania, by an individual eﬀort which has the advantage of unity of conception and analysis. I am not seeking here to demystify Romania’s history by excessive emphasis upon negative elements; neither do I wish to mythologize it by inventing fake victories and heroisms. The reader will ﬁnd a balanced and nuanced analysis of the main events and processes in Romania’s recent history, as a basis for understanding the complexity of the Romanian nation’s past. The book is structured chronologically and thematically. The ﬁrst sequence refers to the period of the Second World War, because the establishment of the communist regime is the result of the world conﬂagration and cannot be understood outside of the consequences of the Hitler–Stalin Pact (1939). The part dedicated to the communist regime is more reduced than the part dedicated to the post-1989 period, because the history of communism is treated in a rich and accessible historical literature, which can easily be accessed, while for the transition period historical studies in English are only now emerging. I have included a distinct chapter about social and demographic phenomena in order not to fragment information which must be analysed as a whole. I would like to thank James Christian Brown, Radu Ciuceanu, Remus Pricopie, Octavian Roske, George Tiugea and Marius Turda for their support towards the accomplishment of this project.

Florin Abraham Bucharest, January 2016\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER 1 UNDER THE SIGN OF THREE DICTATORSHIPS (1938–44)\n\nWhen enemies become allies, and nations prey Barely one week before Nazi Germany attacked Poland and started the Second World War, the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact, ironically dubbed a ‘non-aggression treaty’, was being signed in an eerily happy atmosphere in Moscow. In the secret annex of the Soviet– German document, in the third paragraph, it was stated that: ‘With regard to Southeastern Europe attention is called by the Soviet side to its interest in Bessarabia. The German side declares its complete political disinterestedness in these areas’ (Bold and Seftiuc 1998: 145). The broader signiﬁcance of this seemingly impossible agreement between Stalin and Hitler is the brutal return to manifest spheres of inﬂuence, drawn and maintained with the help of military force, which seemed to have disappeared with the conclusion of the First World War. Then, new states had been formed from the ruins of old empires by application of the Wilsonian principle of self-determination of nations. The Hitler–Stalin agreement of 23 August 1939 marks the symbolic entry of Romania into a tunnel of history, along a path set by the interests and geopolitical ploys of the Great Powers. Prior to the understanding between Hitler and Stalin, the collective security principle enshrined by a system of treaties after the end of the First Wold War had collapsed with the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938. The partition of Czechoslovakia in favour of Germany, sanctioned by France, Britain and Italy, was also a mighty blow to Romania, since one of its Little Entente allies (the alliance created in 1920–1 between Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) had become unable to defend its borders against the aggression of Great Powers and revisionist states, mainly Hungary (Gardner 1995: 45–68). While the totalitarian Great Powers went on with their unexpected non-aggression pact, and France and Britain still lived with the illusion of appeasing Hitler, Romania was more unprepared than ever to defend its strategic interests. Through a cunning and undeterred policy, King Carol II had managed to discredit the fragile democracy and political parties and establish his own authoritarian regime in February 1938. The democratic constitution of 1923 was repealed and replaced by a new fundamental law, conferring wide powers on the monarch. The traditional political parties were dissolved, while Mişcarea Legionară (ML – the Legionary Movement), inspired by the European far right, gained increased popular support despite its illegal status (Feldman 2008). The abolition of parliamentary democracy was welcomed by street crowds in the main Romanian cities, against a wider European setting in which dictatorships were considered to regenerate nations. The single party created by Carol II , called Frontul Renaşterii 3\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nNaţionale (FRN – the National Renaissance Front), was incapable of mobilizing the positive energy of the nation, in spite of its very large formal popular support (more than three and a half million members). The main outcome of Carol II ’s internal policy was the marginalizing and subsequent dissolution of political elites. The beginning of the Second World War found Romania politically, diplomatically and militarily unprepared, in a sea of geopolitical turmoil.\n\nDismantling Greater Romania The invasion of Poland by Germany on 1 September 1939, and subsequently by the Soviet Union on 17 September 1939 conﬁrmed the darkest expectations of Romanian decision-makers. Romania and Poland had been bound by a defensive alliance convention since 1921, which provided for military aid in case of foreign aggression. The convention was not applied, however, since although Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, they did not take any eﬀective action, living with the consequences of illusory appeasement against the brown totalitarianism. The realistic argument of King Carol II and Armand Călinescu’s government was that any Romanian intervention in favour of Poland could only be successful if supported by French and British military operations against Germany, otherwise the Romanian army would not stand a chance of defeating the Wehrmacht. On 6 December 1939, Romania declared its neutrality in the new war, following the prudent path it had taken at the beginning of the First World War, when it had remained neutral from 1914 to 1916, before joining the war on the side of France, Britain and their allies. Despite not intervening in the military defence of its Polish ally, it nonetheless allowed the evacuation of the Polish treasury (worth around $45 million) to Britain through the Port of Constanţa, while three tons of Polish gold were safely stored in the mountains with the Romanian treasury, and returned to Poland in 1947. The Romanian state allowed the transit of weapons to Poland, provoking the obvious resentment of the Germans. Furthermore, Romania oﬀered asylum to many Polish military and civilian refugees (Refugiaţii polonezi 2013). The dissolution of Poland conﬁrmed Romania’s worst fears. With a Soviet Union whose borders had become even more extensive after the occupation of Poland (the Romanian–Soviet border had increased from 812 kilometres to 1,158.6 kilometres), a Horthy regime in Budapest bent on dismantling the Versailles system in the hope of restoring Greater Hungary, and a Bulgaria seeking to recover the Quadrilateral (southern Dobrogea), which it had lost in the Second Balkan War in 1913, the geopolitical situation of Romania was very fragile. On the internal political stage, the successes of German militarism in Poland encouraged the ML to become more aggressive. On 21 September 1939, it assassinated Armand Călinescu in plain sight, the second of the three serving or former prime ministers killed by this fascist organization. The murdered prime minister had promoted close relations with Britain and France instead of Nazi Germany and Italy, which brings 4\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\ninto question the geopolitical implications of this political assassination. Political life in Bucharest was dominated by uncertainty, as the Anglo-French security guarantees of 1939 proved increasingly delusive. For the Romanians, the bottom line of the entire Phoney War (September 1939 to April 1940) was that the country sorely needed to review its foreign policy in the search for new guarantors of its unity. The reorientation towards Germany and Italy, decided by King Carol II , was seen as a necessary measure to ‘adapt to realities’. On 7 March 1940, Romania signed an oil agreement with Germany, completed on 27 May, whereby the Romanian state undertook to export oil predominantly to Germany, in exchange for weapons and war supplies (the Armament–Oil Pact). On 28 May 1940, Romania abandoned neutrality, but without becoming an actual belligerent. Carol II , as a symbolic gesture of courtesy to Hitler, replaced Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu, known for his Anglo-French sympathies, with the pro-German Ion Gigurtu (Scurtu and Buzatu 1999: 369). The opportunistic change of Romania’s foreign policy vector towards the Axis was the result of despair: increasingly challenged internally by the ML , Carol II was in need of foreign allies. Germany was quickly emerging as the new dominant power in Europe after the invasion of Denmark and Norway, the occupation of the Netherlands, and the less than expected resistance put up by France. The surrender of France, Romania’s traditional ally, on 22 June 1940 produced a genuine shockwave in Romanian society, with collective anxiety taking over the country. On the day of France’s surrender, Carol II , in an attempt to emulate the totalitarian system of Germany, decided to turn the FRN into a ‘single and totalitarian party, under the name of the Party of the Nation’. However, the greatest threat came from the East. After the end of the ‘winter war’ with Finland (Edwards 2006), the Soviet Union became increasingly anxious to restore the former Tsarist empire. It had already occupied Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania as early as the autumn of 1939. On 29 March 1940, in a speech to the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet foreign aﬀairs minister, V.M. Molotov, raised the issue of the annexation of Bessarabia in 1918, when the mostly Romanian-populated former Tsarist province decided to reunite with Romania (27 March/9 April 1918). Molotov’s statement represents the oﬃcial onset of the USSR’s campaign to annex Bessarabia, thus enforcing the secret agreement of 23 August with Nazi Germany (Constantiniu 2010: 359). The spectacular military and political failure of France against Hitler bolstered the imperialist disposition of the Soviet Union. In June 1940, pro-Soviet governments were imposed in the three Baltic States, and in August, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia were annexed by the Soviet Union (Lache 2012: 11). On 23 June 1940, the Soviet Union informed the German ambassador in Moscow, Count von Schulenburg, that it intended to request Romania to cede Bessarabia and Bukovina, and to use military force if met with resistance. Two days later, with the Red Army amassing at the Romanian border (Văratic 2000: 334–7), Germany informed Bucharest that it did not plan to prevent a Soviet attack. During the German–Russian diplomatic exchanges, Hitler argued that the annexation of Bukovina, which had belonged to Austria between 1775 and 1918, was not acceptable, being ‘a new element’ in 5\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nrelation to previous understandings (the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact). Thus, to avoid a premature antagonization of Germany, Stalin limited his demands to northern Bukovina, including the city of Chernivtsi (Corneanu 2007: 78–87). Having reached a (temporary) agreement with Hitler on how to divide the spoils of war, Stalin decided to perform the public ritual of sacriﬁcing yet another nation: Romanian. On the evening of 26 June, the Romanian plenipotentiary minister to Moscow was summoned to Molotov, and presented with an ultimatum: ‘to return Bessarabia to the Soviet Union; to cede northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, with the frontiers as depicted in the attached map’ (Dobrinescu and Constantin 1995: 40). In Bucharest, the ﬁrst reaction of King Carol II was to resist, or at least negotiate the Soviet demands, but the diplomatic representatives of Germany and Italy advised yielding to the Soviet requests in order to ‘maintain peace’ in the Balkans. On 27 June, after two meetings of the Crown Council, an advisory body to the king, it was decided to accept the territorial losses without military resistance. Messages from Athens and Belgrade pointed towards giving up the territories without a ﬁght; only Turkey was ready to provide military support to Romania against any Bulgarian aggression. On the night of 27/28 June, the Soviet Union submitted a second ultimatum, requesting Romania to evacuate Bessarabia and northern Bukovina within four days, starting with 28 June, at 14.00 hours. Without even waiting for the four-day deadline, on 28 June, at 13.00 hours, the Red Army crossed the Dniester and occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. On 3 July, the Prut border was closed, and the Soviet Union could begin harsh reprisals against the inhabitants of the reconquered territory. In short, following a genuine political and military diktat, Romania lost 50,762 square kilometres of territory with a population of 3.9 million, of whom more than 2 million were ethnic Romanians (53.49 per cent). The USSR took over Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Hertza region (which had not been part of Tsarist Russia), and subsequently, a few small islands of the Danube Delta. The loss of major territories to the Soviet Union with the manifest consent of the Axis powers generated a tremendous political problem for Romania. Sensing the weakness of the Carol II regime, Hungary and Bulgaria restated their intention to call for an immediate revision of their borders with Romania. The political legitimacy and moral authority of King Carol II had been lost. The result of his policy-making was merely the international isolation of Romania and the loss of important territories. Both in 1940 and later, the question as to why Romania had not resisted the Soviet aggression as had Finland was raised. At the end of June 1940, pragmatic arguments prevailed, focusing on the need to preserve Romania’s statehood and avoid the fate of Poland. Subsequently, an increasing number of voices held that the Romanian Army should have resisted the Soviet aggression, with Romania thus earning a moral right to demand reuniﬁcation at the end of the war. But the die had been cast, and the survival instinct of politicians gained the upper hand over moral arguments and political visions for an uncertain future. However, the irony of history turns great successes into even larger disasters. Dominating continental Europe, though unable to defeat Britain, Hitler informed his close collaborators on 29 July 1940 of his decision to attack the Soviet Union in May 1941 6\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\n(Stahel 2009: 33–8). The aim of the ‘crusade against Bolshevism’ was part of the genetic code of National Socialism to begin with, but attacking the Soviet Union became a strategic priority for Hitler after gaining supremacy over the continent. In the new geostrategic equation, Romania held an important role as both an oil-rich country and a springboard for attacks against the Soviet Union. In Hitler’s new strategic vision, Romania would have to relinquish part of its territories to ensure the loyalty of Hungary and Bulgaria. The Romanian state did not have to be wiped out, however, but merely weakened to a large extent, since its resources had to be employed in the ﬁght against ‘Bolshevism’. The Soviet aggression against Romania was received by Hungary as a long-overdue opportunity to reverse the consequences of the Trianon Peace Treaty on 4 June 1920. Concurrently with the occupation of Bessarabia by the Red Army, Hungary asked Germany for permission to attack Romania, in return for free passage of the Wehrmacht on Hungarian territory. Hitler did not agree with such unilateral action from Budapest, as he could not dismiss the possibility of Romania ﬁghting to defend itself, thus sparking a war in South-East Europe. Moreover, Germany could not rule out that the Soviet Union might cross the Prut to occupy an even larger share of Romania and send it to Poland’s fate. Germany had a vital interest in keeping oil-rich southern Romania secure to ensure the supply of the Wehrmacht (Simion 1996: 190–204). However, the Romanian decisionmakers did not fathom the importance of Romanian oil to Germany, and in the dramatic summer of 1940, they failed to leverage this in their relations with Berlin. In a letter of 15 July 1940, Hitler requested King Carol II of Romania to reach a territorial agreement with Hungary and Bulgaria or face the destruction of its statehood (Simion 1996: 205–11). Without any allies, Romania could not withstand the pressure and started negotiations with Hungary (16 August 1940) in Turnu Severin, and with Bulgaria (19 August 1940) in Craiova. Romania handed southern Dobrogea, also called the Quadrilateral, over to Bulgaria on 7 September. This contained Caliacra and Durostor counties, on an area of 6,826 square kilometres with 0.42 million inhabitants, only a minority of them Romanian. However, the negotiations with Hungary proved much more diﬃcult, since Budapest initially demanded 75 per cent of Transylvania, with 2 million ethnic Romanians. Faced with such demands, the strategy of the Romanian government was to procrastinate, and the talks stalled on 24 August. Three days later, von Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, called his Italian counterpart, Ciano, informing him that ‘the Führer believed that the Romanians should relinquish 40,000 square kilometres to the Hungarians, who in turn claimed 60,000 square kilometres (actually, 66,000 square kilometres)’ (Simion 1996: 316). Germany and Italy invited Hungary and Romania for ‘arbitration’ in Vienna. Hungary accepted the invitation in the hope of a reconﬁrmation of its claims. Romania also agreed to arbitration, believing that it would keep its western borders or relinquish no more than 18,000 square kilometres. Both Romania and Hungary were, however, under the threat of a German invasion should they not accept the Berlin ‘solution’. The Italian–German ‘Arbitration Tribunal’, obviously assembled outside of international law, decided the following on 30 August 1940: Romania had to cede 43,492 square kilometres to Hungary (an area 7\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nlarger than that of the Netherlands), with a population of 2.66 million people, of whom 50.1 per cent were Romanians, 37.1 per cent Hungarians and 2.7 per cent Germans (Constantiniu 2010: 368). The new Romanian boundaries were ‘guaranteed’ by Germany and Italy. As with the relinquishment of Bessarabia, the Vienna awards were the subject of painful debates, with several Crown Council sessions being summoned by King Carol II . Important voices (Nicolae Iorga, Iuliu Maniu, Gheorghe Brătianu) demanded the refusal of any negotiations and armed resistance. The result was the same as with the Soviet threats: Romania agreed to cede signiﬁcant territories in the hope of maintaining its statehood, waiting for history to change before recovering its lost territories (Case 2009: 199–217). The dream of Greater Romania, for which hundreds of thousands had sacriﬁced their lives in the First World War, fell apart in less than seventy days. Romania lost one-third of its territory to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria (approximately 100,000 square kilometres, more than the territory of Austria) and an equal share of its population, including 3 million ethnic Romanians, without the Army ﬁring a single shot to defend its land, in total contrast with the stance of the Poles or the Finns. This political and psychological trauma would mark Romanian history in the short, medium and long term. The safeguarding of national borders became the fundamental matrix in deﬁning national interests, with all other interests subordinated to this goal.\n\nThe Antonescu regime The loss of northern Transylvania gave rise to a strong state of revolt, both against Germany, Italy, and Hungary and against King Carol II . Street marches took place in the main cities of the country, expressing support for Transylvania and even for armed defence of its northern part. Scorned internally, isolated externally, Carol II looked for a way to save himself. He called for the support of the democratic parties Partidul Naţional Liberal (PNL – the National Liberal Party) and Partidul Naţional Ţărănesc (PNŢ – the National Peasant Party) which he had banned several years before, but their leaders, Iuliu Maniu and Constantin (Dinu) Brătianu, declined any talks, instead seeking his abdication. Carol II then turned to General Ion Antonescu, seen as the rescuing leader, who was appointed prime minister on 4 September 1940, after release from the house arrest previously ordered by the king (Watts 1993: 282–90). The next day, Carol II was forced to grant ‘full state powers’ to General Antonescu. One day later, on 6 September, Antonescu compelled the king to abdicate and leave Romania. At barely nineteen years old, Michael I became King of Romania, with Antonescu assuming the position of Conducător al Statului (state leader), with the authority to initiate and enact legislation. Berlin did not ﬁnd the installation of Antonescu unpalatable, for although the state leader was not pro-German by conviction, he could nevertheless ensure order in the country, avoid a military conﬂict with Hungary during the Romanian Army’s withdrawal from northern Transylvania, and ultimately, turn Romania into a valuable 8\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\nally for the Third Reich. Antonescu’s desire was to create a government backed by all the important political forces, hoping to include both the PNL , PNŢ and the ML in the cabinet. The party leaders rejected this project, which would have deprived the country of any political alternative as regards its traditional allies, France and Britain (Deletant 2006: 55). The only option available to Antonescu remained the ML , which frantically supported a speedy and full cooperation with Germany by virtue of its ideological compatibility with National Socialism. On 14 September 1940, Romania was proclaimed a ‘National Legionary State’ after the entry of the ML into the government. Horia Sima, the Legionary leader, became Deputy Prime Minister, and four important ministries (Internal Aﬀairs, Foreign Aﬀairs, Education, and Work and Health) were run by the fascist organization (Heinen 1999: 414). The ML was the ‘only recognized movement in the new state’, but the regime was a mixed one: a military dictatorship with the ideological support of a totalitarian-inspired movement. As regards foreign aﬀairs, Romania fully entered a mechanism of extended cooperation with Germany, which was, in fact, full subordination. Antonescu renewed Carol II ’s request for a German military mission to Romania for the military training of Romanian troops, and then, on 23 November 1940, signed the Tripartite Pact, concluded between Germany, Italy and Japan, on 27 September 1940. Relations between Antonescu and the ML became increasingly tense, as the fascist organization sought to take full control of Romania. On 26/27 November 1940, the ML assassinated sixty-four political prisoners at Jilava prison (where they had been held as enemies of the Legionaries), together with other prominent intellectuals and politicians (the historian Nicolae Iorga, the economist Virgil Madgearu) (Veiga 1995: 292–3). The army could not condone assassinations as a means of reprisal against political enemies without running the risk of losing credibility, which overstrained relations with the ML , particularly as Antonescu disbanded the Legionary Police, which had been responsible for murders and repeated unrest, on 2 December 1940. Similarly to General Francisco Franco of Spain, Antonescu was a staunch conservative and heartfelt anti-Bolshevik, and boasted paternalist views on society. In contrast, the ML sought a ‘revolution’ to overturn the entire social and political order (Traşcă and Stan 2002: 21). While in Romania the Antonescu government was under constant attack by the ML ,‘Directive 21’ was being wrapped up on 18 December 1940 in Berlin, preparing for ‘Operation Barbarossa’, the oﬀensive against the Soviet Union. Without consultation, Romania was identiﬁed as the main ally for the southern ﬂank of the attack against the Soviet Union (Stahel 2009: 66–9). Against a confused backdrop of internal aﬀairs and without a clear-cut German approach to relations with the ML , Antonescu was determined to put an end to the murders and disorders of the Legionaries, while the latter were bent on a full seizure of power. The days of 21 and 22 January 1941 saw the so-called ‘Legionary rebellion’, in fact a bloody confrontation between the Army and the ML in the pursuit of total political and military control over Romania. Eventually, Hitler chose to support Antonescu, who managed to crush the ML with the help of the Army. The orchestrators of the Legionary rebellion were taken under German political protection, removed from the country and 9\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\ntransferred to Germany. Hitler’s message became clear: Antonescu was the only person capable of maintaining order and preparing Romania for a war in the East. On 27 January 1941, Antonescu formed a military government and Romania entered the stage of military dictatorship (the National Legionary State was oﬃcially abolished on 14 February 1941). The image of the Leader became the main insignia of the Antonescu military regime, which was based on the ideologies of traditional nationalism and conservatism, and bolstered by anti-Semitism (Ciucă et al. 1997–2008; Achim 2013). In preparation for the launch of ‘Operation Barbarossa’, Hitler met with Antonescu on 12 June 1941 in Munich and informed him of the decision to attack the Soviet Union, but without specifying an exact date. At this meeting, Hitler cleverly manipulated the hopes of his Romanian counterpart: he did not bluntly request participation in the war, but said that he ‘expected Romania to act solely in its own interest, in order to ease the course of this conﬂict’ (Traşcă 2001: 156–60). Antonescu hoped to bring up the issue of northern Transylvania and its reuniﬁcation with Romania at the end of the war. Hitler hinted that in exchange for her participation in the war, Romania would receive territorial compensation in the East, on the territory of the Soviet Union. This also revealed the Nazi vision of Lebensraum: Romania had to transfer the centre of gravity of its statehood towards the East, by taking up territories in the Slavic space. On 22 June 1941, Romania joined and marched alongside Germany in the war by attacking the Soviet Union in the Army Group ‘South’, within which the ‘General Antonescu Army Group’ was formed. Following Antonescu’s personal decision, Romania entered the war against the USSR without a formal declaration (Deletant 2006: 80). By 25 July 1941, supported by the German Army’s oﬀensive, Romania had recovered the losses it had incurred during the previous year. Romania rejoiced and felt that it had achieved a great victory, albeit not a total one. The fundamental issue of northern Transylvania still lingered. On 26 June 1941, Slovakia, a natural enemy of Hungary given Hungarian revisionism, joined the war on the side of the Wehrmacht. The following day, Hungary also declared war on the Soviet Union, joining the same coalition with Romania and Slovakia in the hope of not losing Hitler’s support in territorial matters. Hitler’s strategy was paying oﬀ: Romania, Hungary and Slovakia were committed to the German objectives through the very eﬀective manipulation of ethnic and territorial issues. The decision-makers in Bucharest, Budapest and Bratislava believed that Germany could not be defeated by the Anglo-Soviet coalition, and that they had to pay with military sacriﬁces for a suitable position in the post-war negotiations. On 27 July, Hitler requested that Antonescu continue the anti-Soviet operations across the Dniestr, beyond the borders of the Romanian state. The leader of the Romanian state referenced an ideological motivation of the war against the Soviets: ‘I shall march to the end in our action in the East against the great enemy of civilization, Europe and my country: Russian Bolshevism’ (Constantiniu and Schipor 1995: 97–8). The crossing of the Dniestr was one of the most controversial unilateral decisions made by Antonescu. The leaders of the traditional parties, and particularly the PNŢ president, Maniu, still expecting a Soviet-British victory, branded it as an act of overt aggression. Antonescu had military arguments on his side: once in a war, an alliance should be maintained until 10\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\ncomplete victory, or all achievements (recovery of lost territories) would be unsustainable. It would also have been political nonsense to abandon the alliance with Germany as long as the latter guaranteed reuniﬁcation with Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. All Antonescu’s political and military designs relied on the assumption that Germany and its allies would be victorious. Instead, the Nazi military failure made Romania responsible for the attack against the Soviet Union. Romania’s participation in the war alongside Germany and its allies provided the opportunity for territorial gains by which the Germans meant to compensate for the loss of northern Transylvania to Hungary. Romania was assigned to manage a territory of 40,000 square kilometres between the rivers Dniestr and Bug, called Transnistria, with Odessa as the largest city. This territory was under Romanian civil administration between 19 February 1941 and 29 January 1944, headed by governor Gheorghe Alexianu (Verenca 2000). Out of a population of more than 2.3 million according to the December 1941 census, ethnic Romanians represented merely 8.5 per cent (Pântea 2008: 176–7). Despite Hitler’s repeated urging Antonescu refused to annex Transnistria to Romania and refused to incorporate the conquered territory for several reasons: he wanted a restoration of the status quo ante 1940, including the recovery of northern Transylvania; the war against the Soviet Union was deﬁned as defensive by Antonescu, with the civil administration of Transnistria being regarded as a temporary measure until the end of the war; and, in the words of the Antonescu government, Transnistria was ‘economic and ﬁnancial collateral’ for the reparations owed by the Soviet Union to Romania (Deletant 2006: 166–7). As regards the rise to power of communism in Romania, a few important issues between the joining by Antonescu of the war against the Soviet Union and the removal of the military dictatorship on 23 August 1944 have to be considered. Antonescu was not an ideological follower of Hitler, but thought that the alliance with Nazi Germany and the maintenance thereof were prerequisites for the restoration of the status quo ante 1940 (Hillgruber 2007). The Romanian army took part in the war against the Soviet Union, crossing the internationally recognized border on the Dniester, and ﬁghting at Stalingrad and in the battles of the Don bend, the Kalmuk Steppe and the Caucasus (Duţu 1999: 67–124). Despite the unpreparedness of the army for a war against the Soviet Union, Antonescu believed that the Romanian nation should pay for the reuniﬁcation of Romanian territory in blood, as had happened in the First World War. During more than 20 meetings with Hitler, the Romanian leader raised the issue of winning the competition with Hungary for northern Transylvania, under the illusion that the Nazi leader would be attracted to the Romanian cause by mere loyalty and regard for its sacriﬁces on the Eastern front. Antonescu had joined Germany in the war without an alliance treaty, in the hope that Romania would beneﬁt from a future Pax Germanica. He lived with the irrational and very damaging conviction that he had a personal relationship with Hitler based on mutual trust, rather than on formal state treaties. Both Antonescu and Hitler had built their cult of personality around their being saviours of the people: strong leaders delivering their nations from the ‘decadence’ and ‘corruption’ of bourgeois democracies. 11\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nEven after the loss of the Battle of Stalingrad (November 1942 to February 1943), which reversed the course of the war (Geoﬀrey 2002), Antonescu remained conﬁdent of a ﬁnal German victory. However, he became more cautious both with the allocation of food and oil resources for the Reich, and in internal politics, allowing the leaders of the opposition parties to come to contact with representatives of the Western states. Romania did not condone an alliance with Germany, but the popular feeling of the 1940 to 1942 period was that, according to a traditional Romanian proverb, ‘one should make a pact with the devil to cross the bridge’. The Axis’s military failures on the Eastern and Mediterranean fronts at the end of 1942 and in 1943 brought a wave of hostility towards Germany, and several channels of negotiations were opened with the United Nations for an early exit from the war. Diplomatic negotiations or mere attempts to probe the United Nations’ positions were initiated by the Antonescu government and the leaders of the democratic parties. The essential element inﬂuencing armistice negotiations between Romania and the Anglo-Americans was the ‘doctrine of unconditional surrender’ of the Axis and their allies, established by the Conference of Casablanca (14– 24 January 1943). The most important negotiation channels from 1943 to the Romanian exit from the war against the USSR were Stockholm (used by government and opposition alike), for direct contact with the Soviets; Ankara, for talks between Antonescu and the British and Americans; and Cairo, where Barbu Ştirbei represented the government and the opposition parties, together with Constantin Vişoianu in the search for an agreement with the Anglo-Americans (Puşcaş 1995a). The common theme of the diplomatic talks between the Antonescu government and leaders of the political parties was the preservation of the pre-1940 borders. The dynamics of the negotiations and of the mutual interests of the Great Powers ﬁghting the Axis on all fronts proved that maintaining a greater Romania was not a realistic aim in view of the advance of the USSR . After reversing the tide of the war at Stalingrad and Kursk (5 July to 23 August 1943), Stalin was interested in a speedy advance to Berlin, and Romania’s exit from the war would clear the path to the whole of South-Eastern Europe. Before the Allied landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944, and with the Red Army reaching the Dniester on 24 March 1944, the Soviet Union oﬀered Romania the most lenient surrender conditions ever accepted by the Allies: none of the territories lost in 1940 were to be returned, but Transylvania (‘or the largest part thereof’ – British wording in the hope of removing Hungary from its alliance with Germany) could be recovered, provided the Romanian army took part in the military action for its liberation. Antonescu declined the Soviet conditions. He tested whether Maniu would accept such armistice conditions, in which case he was prepared to relinquish power in his favour. Hoping for better conditions from the Anglo-Americans, Maniu refused to take responsibility for losing such extensive territories. Thus, Antonescu did not accept the Soviet proposal, counting on a spectacular German victory with the help of ‘secret weapons’. Maniu made a desperate attempt, on behalf of the democratic Romanian parties, to secure new surrender conditions from the Anglo-Americans. However, tied up with preparations for the western oﬀensive against Germany, the latter were not interested in Romania, and as far as the British were concerned, Eastern Europe could remain, at least for the time being, in the Soviet sphere of inﬂuence. 12\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\nThe interesting side of the negotiations for the Romanian exit from the war against the United Nations (Great Britain had declared war on Romania and Finland on 6 December 1941, at the request of the USSR ; on 12 December 1941, at the behest of the German and Italian representatives in Bucharest, Romania had declared war on the US , reciprocated only on 5 June 1942, at Russian insistence) was the fact that although the Soviets and the Anglo-Americans carried out separate negotiations with various Romanian emissaries, they all considered Antonescu to be the most capable of achieving an armistice, as he controlled the army. In turn, Antonescu was of the opinion that any Romanian exit from the war had to be agreed in advance by the Germans, which was absolutely naïve. While Hungary was preparing to leave the war, it was occupied by Germany on 19 March 1944, in operation ‘Margarethe I’. Germany also had a plan for the military occupation of Romania (‘Margarethe II ’), but never carried it out, Hitler saw Antonescu as a faithful ally, who was in control of both the country and the army (Traşcă 2013).\n\n23 August 1944: from responsibility to adventure The military victories of the Red Army and the reoccupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina gave rise to new anguish in Romanian society and prompted in the political elite a frantic search for solutions to cope with the new military realities. Iuliu Maniu’s hopes for an Anglo-American landing in the Balkans were quashed by the Normandy landings. For anyone with a grasp of the dynamics of the war, it became increasingly obvious that Germany would be clenched between an oﬀensive of the Red Army in the east, and another oﬀensive by the Anglo-Americans and their allies in the west and south. The biggest riddle of the summer of 1944 was how the post-war peace would be shaped by the armies of the United Nations in Europe. The ﬁrst step towards a political solution was the formation of Blocul Naţional Democratic (BND – the National Democratic Bloc) by Partidul Comunist Român (PCR – the Romanian Communist Party), the PNŢ and the PNL , the main objective being a Romanian withdrawal from the war against the United Nations. The acceptance by the democratic leaders of an alliance with the Communist Party, which had been outlawed since 1924, was meant as a gesture of goodwill to provide for a channel of negotiation acceptable to Stalin. The Soviet Union had suggested one way of involving the Communists in post-war public life in the closing lines of the armistice proposal of 12 April 1944: ‘Fifth: if Romania also wishes (. . .) a political representative for political matters, the Soviet government does not have any objections’ (Corneanu 2007: 421). That was a concrete sign of the Soviet post-war vision: the spheres of inﬂuence would depend on the military positions of the Great Powers, while the political and social systems of the USSR-controlled zones would be aligned as closely as possible to the communist model. The cooperation between the democratic parties and the communists was also proposed by the Anglo-Americans during the negotiations for the Romanian exit from the war, in the spirit of the then cross-ideological mindset of the Great Alliance (Constantiniu 1997: 123). 13\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nOn 2 April 1944, the Russian oﬀensive on the Romanian front was halted, and calm installed throughout the summer. On 23 June, the Red Army began a strong oﬀensive against the Wehrmacht’s Army Group Centre of Byelorussia. On 20 August, the Red Army also attacked the Romanian-held territories, hastening the political decisions, as the Prut line was breached and the new front line lay between Chişinău and Iaşi, continually moving westward. Aware of the weakness of the Romanian forces against the Russians, Antonescu requested help from the Germans. The defence of the Romanian front by the Germans was neither welcome in Berlin, nor was it possible in such a short time frame. In the new military situation, Ion Antonescu looked to resume the armistice negotiations with the USSR (Djuvara 2012). As the military pressure upon Romania grew, an ad hoc coalition between the representatives of the BND parties, the young King Michael I and a few army commanders decided to act in a plot against the state leader. The action against Antonescu was scheduled for 26 August 1944 to avoid the occupation of the country by the Red Army. On 23 August, Antonescu requested an audience with the king to discuss the new situation in the wake of the Russian oﬀensive in Moldavia. Michael I urged Antonescu to sign the armistice with the United Nations. On the afternoon of 23 August 1944, he was arrested and taken into custody by a team of communists led by Emil Bodnăraş. He was in a safe house, transported to the USSR , and was only brought back for his trial in 1946. This was an undoubtedly bold action on the part of Michael I, taking advantage of the fact that Antonescu had not de jure abolished the monarchy. The position of state leader was equivalent to that of prime minister, and thus subordinated to the king. On the evening of 23 August, the king broadcast his ‘Proclamation to the Country’, announcing Romania’s exit from the Axis, the cessation of the war against the United Nations (USSR , Britain and the US ) and of ‘any hostilities against the Soviet Army’. The king stated that ‘the United Nations have guaranteed the independence of our country and nonintervention in our internal aﬀairs. They have recognized the injustice of the Vienna Awards, through which Transylvania was taken away from us’ (Scurtu 2005: 102–3). A new government was formed, led by General Constantin Sănătescu, with the political support of the BND parties. PNŢ leader Iuliu Maniu, PNL leader Dinu Brătianu, Partidul Social Democrat (PSD – the Social Democratic Party) leader Constantin TitelPetrescu and Communist leader Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu became ministers of state to underscore the wide political support for the new government. Pătrăşcanu also took over the Justice portfolio for a short period, to facilitate the release of Communist political prisoners. The removal of Antonescu from power and the abolition of the military dictatorship came as a stunning surprise. Hitler ordered the arrest of King Michael I – who had already left Bucharest – and his replacement with a pro-Nazi puppet regime. The Germans did not ﬁnd any volunteers among the Romanian generals, and the Wehrmacht attacks were eventually repelled. Moreover, as an amicable agreement for the retreat of the German troops could not be reached, Romania declared war on Germany on 25 August 1944 (Duţu 2000: 220–8). 14\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\nThe removal of the Antonescu regime was also unexpected for the United Nations. Even if armistice negotiations had been carried out on behalf of the major parties and King Michael I, neither Moscow, London nor Washington had anticipated a successful overthrow of the Antonescu government. The entire 23 August operation was a tragic improvisation. The Romanian troops found themselves in an impossible situation: on the one hand, they were supposed to resist German attacks, and on the other, the Red Army began to disarm and deport Romanian military personnel to the USSR . Romanian documents mention 60,000 to 160,000 troops taken into captivity without a ﬁght (Duţu 2000: 234–5) with 100,783 troops going missing in the period between 24 and 31 August 1944. Soviet sources conﬁrm the arrival of 97,000 prisoners of war in NKVD (People’s Commissariat for Internal Aﬀairs) detention facilities, having been captured following the liquidation of ‘enemy groups encircled in the Chişinău area’ (Prizonieri 2013: xxi). The Romanian ﬂeet was compelled to surrender to the Soviet ﬂeet. In fact, King Michael I and the other participants in the coup against the Antonescu regime acted ‘blindly’: the ﬁrst steps towards signing an armistice agreement were taken only on 24 August. The Anglo-Americans left the entire political and military responsibility for relations with Romania to the Soviets. A delegation led by the Communist leader Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu was sent to Moscow to negotiate and sign an armistice convention. The choice of Pătrăşcanu was not random, as he was expected to attract Soviet sympathy for Romania. The negotiations were delayed by the Soviets and the British (the latter, under the pretext of requesting the agreement of the Dominions for their own proposals) until an important share of Romanian territory was under occupation. The ‘Agreement Between the Governments of United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, on the one hand, and the Government of Rumania, on the other hand, concerning an Armistice’ was eventually signed in Moscow (Oﬃcial Journal no. 219 of 22 September 1944). For Romania, this was the end of staking its statehood on the German card. A new historic cycle began, in which communist totalitarianism would generate profound changes throughout Romanian society.\n\nVictims of war and of racial and class hatred Europe’s entry into destruction, caused by national rivalries and exacerbation of racial or class hatred, generated tremendous loss and suﬀering. War crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, deportations and mass arrests, rapes and other atrocities were unleashed with the onset of the Second World War. To these victims must be added those dead, wounded and missing on battleﬁelds, losses which took a heavy toll on the Romanian population. The misfortunes of the war and conﬂicts between various ethnic and racial groups have had a long-lasting eﬀect through the creation of a traumatic collective memory, manifested both during the communist period and after the end of the Cold War. The crimes and horrors of the war are still unhealed wounds in the memory of the nation. 15\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nThe ﬁrst to suﬀer in the aftermath of the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact were the Bessarabians and Bukovinians, as the Soviet Union began mass deportations just as it had in Poland and the Baltic countries. After the incorporation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina into the Soviet Union, repressive action began against the civilian population (mainly against ‘anti-Soviet elements’ and ‘counter-revolutionary organizations’), culminating in the deportations of 12–13 June 1941, when 24,360 people were transported to Siberia and Kazakhstan out of a total of 29,839 people removed from their homes. Families were separated, and the long journey to the forced labour camps was completed in inhumane conditions, in cattle wagons (Caşu 2000: 32–3). The winning of a large share of Transylvania by Hungary following the German– Italian Vienna decision was seen by some ethnic Hungarians as an opportunity for revenge against local Romanian elites. The Hungarian army, together with the Hungarian police, paramilitaries and locals undertook arrests, torture and murders. According to a report by the Bucharest Secretariat for Nationalities, between 30 August 1940 and 1 November 1941, 919 murders, 1,126 cases of torture, 4,126 beatings, and 15,893 arrests were recorded (Fătu et al. 1985: 56–99; Grad 1998: 154–68). Symbols of the crimes against civilians are the villages of Ip and Trăznea in Sălaj County (Puşcaş 1995b: xxii– xxiii). The redrawing of borders meant waves of refugees ﬂed to Romania. More than 200,000 people ﬂed immediately from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in the summer of 1940, some of them returning to their homes after the reconquest of those territories by the German and Romanian armies in 1941. By the end of 1943, 218,919 deportations from northern Transylvania were recorded (Istoria României. Transilvania Vol. II 1997: 24). To this must be added those people who ﬂed northern Transylvania on their own initiative, bringing the number of Romanians who left their homes following the Vienna Award of 30 August 1940 to nearly half a million. In the same context, more than 100,000 Hungarians from southern Transylvania left Romania to live in Hungary, with approximately half a million ethnic Hungarians remaining in Romania between 1941 and 1944. The war started in Europe was an opportunity for the supporters of anti-Semitism to attempt to solve the ‘Jewish problem’. The broader ideological objective was the achievement of an ‘ethnically pure’ nation, by assimilation, then, due to war conditions, by the physical elimination of ‘undesirable minorities’. These were Jews and Roma. The process was called ‘Romanization’, becoming ever more extended and violent and acquiring the character of mass crimes during the war (Heinen 2011; Solonari 2009). Anti-Semitic economic and administrative policies had been applied in Romania as early as 1938, but anti-Semitism became criminally violent after the beginning of the war and Nazi military victories. The Legionary rebellion of January 1941 caused 416 deaths, including 120 Jews in the Bucharest pogrom (Raport ﬁnal 2005: 112; Ioanid 2006). The loss of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union resurrected older ‘Jewish-communist’ stereotypes. In 1940, rumours of hostile acts by Jews against the retreating Romanian army created the psychological conditions for the incitement of latent anti-Semitism among some Romanians. After the attack of Germany and its allies 16\n\nUnder the Sign of Three Dictatorships (1938–44)\n\nagainst the Soviet Union, Antonescu assumed the time had come to apply the plan for the removal of Jews from Moldavia, Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Iaşi pogrom in the summer of 1941 left 14,850 Jews dead. Antonescu’s plan was to ‘cleanse’ Bessarabia and northern Bukovina of the Jewish population by massive deportations to Transnistria. There, measures for the extermination of Jews were carried out by both the Romanian and German armies. In this context, the human condition of Jews witnessed an unimaginable degradation. Many Jews died following executions by Einsatzgruppe and units of the Romanian army, but also due to starvation, freezing and disease. The massacre of Odessa Jews (October 1941), accomplished as repressive measure for an attempt against the Romanian military command, was ordered by Antonescu. Twentytwo thousand Jews were shot or burned alive in Odessa and another 65,000 were deported, many of them dying in the process (Ancel 2012: 315–429). The total number of Jews deported from Romania to Transnistria is estimated at between 154,449 and 170,737 people (Raport ﬁnal 2005: 176). In Transnistria, the Romanian authorities found between 150,000 and 200,000 local Jews. An estimated 220,000 died under the Romanian administration in Transnistria during the Holocaust, but the number could be as high as 270,000 (Raport ﬁnal 2005: 178). In addition, the approximately 132,000 Jews deported from northern Transylvania to Auschwitz between May and July 1944 by the Hungarian authorities cannot be ignored. The Antonescu regime employed a diﬀerent policy towards the Jews of the Old Kingdom and southern Transylvania. Although an application of the German ‘Final Solution’ (Die Endlösung) was also being envisaged for these Jews, deportations to Transnistria were halted in October 1942, for fear of post-war consequences: the Romanian army was in a fragile situation on the Eastern front, and Hungary had not yet surrendered its Jews for extermination. Antonescu was increasingly mindful of the future, as Germany’s ﬁnal victory was no longer certain anymore. In the Old Kingdom and Transylvania, the ‘Jewish problem’ could be solved not by deportation, but by emigration. It would resurface again in Romania during the communist regime. Another ethnic group who suﬀered during the Antonescu regime was the Roma: 25,000 were deported to Transnistria, where approximately 11,000 died; 14,000 survived and returned to Romania (Raport ﬁnal 2005: 240; Achim 2004a). The joining of the war by Romania on the German side brought the recovery of the territories lost in 1940, but it also brought high human sacriﬁce. The Romanian army lost 71,585 dead, 243,622 were wounded and 309,533 were missing (mostly prisoners of war) on the Eastern front (Duţu 1999: 251).\n\n17\n\n18\n\nPART I COMMUNISM\n\nFor more than four decades the Romanian nation was led by a political regime which had not been expected or wanted, but which was accepted as an immense but not unique historical tragedy. Caught behind the Iron Curtain, Romania was forced to break relations with Western civilization, to which it had been organically bound since the second half of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the regime, national sovereignty was drastically limited by the Soviets; though after 1960, Romania enjoyed relative political autonomy within the Soviet bloc. The Communists brutally eliminated old elites in the name of class struggle and brought about a reset of the social elevator according to Marxist-Leninist ideological values. While for some, communism was a collective disaster, due to loss of wealth and freedoms, for others the communist regime represented an opportunity to overcome the condition of marginal individuals and turn into new elites. In the name of the utopia of the New Man and of a society free from social exploitation, a criminally repressive regime was established, which committed abominable abuses, strangled freedom and destroyed destinies. The collectivization of agriculture represented both loss of land and a chance for millions of peasants to escape the trap of subsistence agriculture and to become ﬁrst-generation townspeople. Following a huge social mobilization, Romania built a broad industrial sector. The rhythm of economic accumulation was quick, but this did not turn into prosperity because the population was deprived of a decent living, especially after 1982. Lies and social hypocrisy became mandatory conditions for survival and success. The regime tried to compensate for tyranny through social stability: safe jobs, aﬀordable housing, universal medical insurance and free education. Communism failed in the authoritarian modernization of society, although this was its fundamental project. When the economy most needed an opening in order to consolidate the accumulated modernization of previous decades, Nicolae Ceauşescu made the fatal mistake of pursuing an autarkic policy, wasting the dramatic eﬀorts and sacriﬁces that had been made by the population to develop the country. Started under the ﬂag of a social revolution, Romanian communism ended up under the despotic leadership of the Ceauşescu clan, which exhausted the whole capital of hope in Romanian society with an aberrant personality cult. The communist regime was not uniform from the beginning. There were two main periods, which may be labelled according to the names of the main political leaders, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (1948–65) and Nicolae Ceauşescu (1965–89). Between the two eras there are both fundamental elements of continuity and signiﬁcant diﬀerences. In spite of the crimes committed by the state and the terror against society until 1964, 19\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nthe communist regime imposed a new social contract, based on the promise of mobility and rise in the social hierarchy, which was tacitly or sometimes genuinely enthusiastically accepted by a part of the population. Communism created its own legitimacy by a skilful use of national feelings, which collapsed with the humiliation and hunger to which the population was submitted at the end of the Ceauşescu regime. The signal given by Mikhail Gorbachev, that he would not intervene militarily to support the regimes of obsolete dictators such as Erich Honecker, Nicolae Ceauşescu or Todor Zhivkov, resulted in the fall of communism in Europe. The Ceauşescu regime collapsed because it was internationally ostracized, the population no longer supported it, and the repressive apparatus would no longer assume the risk of supporting a leader who had lost contact with reality.\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 2 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME (1944–47)\n\nFrom the Grand Alliance to the Cold War: the sovietization of Eastern Europe Romania’s entrance into the Soviet Union’s sphere of inﬂuence and its subsequent communization, as a guarantee of its relation of geopolitical subordination, must be understood as part of a global process of transformation within the international system. The complexity and contradictory character of the transformation concerning relations between the Great Powers in just three years, from an alliance aimed at defeating the Axis Powers to open confrontation between the former partners of the anti-fascist coalition, makes the evaluation of the sovietization of Eastern Europe diﬃcult. In order to understand developments in Romania, some main elements may be recalled. In the concept of US President F.D. Roosevelt, it was vital that international security was not threatened by another power. Germany, not the Soviet Union, was also considered the main threat in the future. In the international policy vision of the Roosevelt administration, the space between Germany and the Soviet Union did not present a special importance, being a periphery of the West, which only held political signiﬁcance due to the fact that Polish immigration to the US was a factor that had to be attended to during presidential elections (Kissinger 2008: 348–9). In an unrealistic manner, Americans considered that territorial issues, power balances and the fate of colonial empires had to be solved within a global political framework, ignoring the role of the presence of Soviet military forces in the conquered areas. Far from illusions of Wilsonian idealism, Britain’s Winston Churchill had two strategic objectives: preserving the colonial empire and restoring the European power balance, together with France and, eventually, Germany, in order to counterbalance the rise of the USSR . Eastern Europe was a space of variable geometry; it could be an area of ‘compensations’ and a future ‘buﬀer’ zone against the Soviets. The British Prime Minister considered that London had at best a moral duty towards Poland, to which it had oﬀered security guarantees and in defence of which it had declared war on Hitler. Italy, Greece and Turkey were deﬁned as vital states for the strategic interests of the British Empire, as they allowed the preservation of trade routes towards the East (Anton 2013: 66). The Soviet Union’s expansionist interest in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE ) became visible through the Hitler–Stalin Pact in 1939. Finland, the Baltic States, a part of Poland and a part of Romania were incorporated into the USSR , in order to extend the borders of the Soviet state to the west by a few hundred kilometres, under the pretext of either legitimate security needs or an ‘historical right’ over territories that had at some point been part of the Tsarist Empire. After the Battle of Stalingrad, which marked the 21\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nturning of the tide in the war, Stalin informed the Anglo-Americans of his wish to keep what he had won after the agreement with Hitler, preserving the USSR’s borders as of June 1941 (Gaddis 2009: 25–6). De facto, after the Tehran Conference in 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt considered as desirable Stalin’s claim of a return to the borders resulting from the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact, although such a tacit acceptance was never made public, as it went against the Atlantic Charter of August 1941. Ensuring a ‘friendly neighbourhood’ for the USSR was considered a legitimate objective for both London and Washington, without meaning, ab initio, an acceptance of the region’s communization. In October 1944, Churchill and Stalin met in Moscow. The main result was the socalled ‘percentages agreement’, which brought with it an insidious return to the politics of spheres of inﬂuence. According to the ﬁnal result of the negotiations, Stalin recognized a 90 per cent British inﬂuence in Greece and Churchill accepted a similar Soviet share in Romania. Britain got from Stalin recognition of a 50 per cent inﬂuence in Yugoslavia and Hungary, but only 20 per cent in Bulgaria, the rest being attributed to the Soviets (Constantiniu 1997: 96). Thus, the USSR had a free hand in the political and military control of Romania, without fearing a serious response from the Anglo-Americans. Stalin had the strategic advantage of the Red Army presence in the CEE , but turning it into an occupation force in countries ‘liberated’ from the leadership of ‘fascist’ regimes could only be legitimized in terms of spheres of inﬂuence, which tolerated the right of the fait accompli. After Roosevelt’s death, when the US became conscious of the nature and purposes of the USSR’s international policies, in light of George F. Kennan’s ‘Long Telegram’, the Cold War began. The Soviet Union had to be ‘contained’, as stated in the ‘Truman Doctrine’ of March 1947, because it represented a danger; it was as totalitarian as Nazi Germany. Eastern Europe was already under Soviet military control, but Greece and Turkey had to be helped in order to save them from communization. Thus, the demarcation of antagonistic blocs was achieved. At the Yalta Conference of 4 to 12 February 1945, relations among the Great Powers were apparently cordial, and understanding about Europe’s future seemed complete (Harbutt 2010). Stalin acquired an important advantage from the fact that President Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and Churchill lost the parliamentary elections in the UK on 26 July 1945, being forced to give up the leadership of the government to Clement Attlee, a Labour politician lacking international experience. During a crucial period for the post-war setting, Stalin was the most experienced leader within the Grand Alliance. At the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, Stalin was the winner at the negotiations: he obtained a modiﬁcation of Poland’s borders, proposed territorial ‘compensations’ to the USSR in exchange for establishing a new Polish western border, to Germany’s detriment and, on the rivers Oder and Neisse; the German populations of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were relocated, oﬀering Moscow an important advantage in relation to those nations. Peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania and Hungary were considered secondary issues, assigned to the level of the Great Powers’ foreign aﬀairs ministers, so the Soviet Union could manoeuvre to impose friendly governments in countries where the Red Army was present. The 22\n\nThe Establishment of the Communist Regime (1944–7)\n\nSoviets also made political use of the border issues between Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria. Stalin considered that Eastern Europe’s sovietization (by the creation of satellite states and the communization of institutions, society and the economy) would ensure the military and economic security of the USSR . Stalin’s plan could be achieved as the Soviets controlled the region militarily and the Anglo-Americans were not psychologically, politically or militarily prepared for a new conﬂagration with a new superpower. The hypothesis of using the atomic bomb against the USSR , in order to avoid the sovietization of Romania, Poland and Hungary was considered unacceptable in political and military evaluations in Washington (Constantiniu 2010). Sheltered by the Iron Curtain, Western leaders initially hoped to avoid direct military confrontation with Moscow; they hoped that communist regimes would liberalize. Communism persisted in Eastern Europe longer than was hoped at the end of the world conﬂagration and less than was anticipated during the 1980s. Beyond this Great Power game, the drama of some nations went on, often in silence: nations whose only ‘fault’ was being too close to aggressive and greedy neighbours.\n\nThe ﬁrst steps in Romania’s sovietization The Armistice Convention laid the basis of Romania’s satellite status towards the USSR . Romania was forced to pay war reparations amounting to $300 million, within a period of six years, which was a signiﬁcant economic burden. Soviet and Allied troops could move freely over Romania’s territory, without assuming their withdrawal until after the end of the war. The Romanian government was subordinated to the Allied (Soviet) Control Council (12 November 1944), with the Romanian authorities being forced to apply capitulation provisions. Within the Commission the Soviets had the ﬁrst and the last word, as the representatives of the US (Cortland Van R. Schuyler) and the UK (Donald Stevenson) had speciﬁc instructions not to generate conﬂict with them. The Anglo-Americans knew precisely what was happening in Romania, but considered they lacked the necessary instruments to stop communization (Chiper, Constantiniu and Pop 1993). Immediately after removal of the Antonescu regime, a new government was formed, led by General Sănătescu. Its ﬁrst political decision was to return to a democratic political regime of constitutional monarchy. The 1923 Constitution was thus reinstated (albeit with the introduction of some limitations on citizens’ rights). Multi-party democracy was revived and the minute communist party, together with traditional political groups, had a legal framework for beginning the power struggle through parliamentary elections. According to the Armistice Convention, Romania went from one war to another, having to provide ‘no less than twelve infantry divisions with auxiliary technical services’ to ﬁght against Germany and Hungary. Romania participated, together with the Red Army, in the liberation of its own territory from German and Hungarian troops. On 23\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\n25 October 1944 the last Romanian towns, Carei and Satu Mare, were liberated. Hoping to get better terms during the peace conference, Romania also participated in the liberation of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Romania’s war materialized in participation on the Western front with the deployment of 560,000 military personnel, resulting in the liberation of over 900 villages and towns, at the price of 169,822 dead and wounded. During the Hungarian campaign, the Romanian army lost 42,700 soldiers, and in Czechoslovakia it had 66,995 dead and missing in action (Duţu 1999: 251). While the Romanian army was participating in the war against Germany, leaving the country without any defences, at the political level, important events were taking place. While any faint hopes of regaining Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from the USSR had been shattered by the Armistice Convention, the fundamental national stake was the recovery of northern Transylvania. The Armistice Convention stipulated: ‘19. The Allied Governments regard the decision of the Vienna award regarding Transylvania as null and void and are agreed that Transylvania (or the greater part thereof) should be returned to Rumania, subject to conﬁrmation at the peace settlement, and the Soviet Government agrees that Soviet forces shall take part for this purpose in joint military operations with Rumania against Germany and Hungary.’ Introduction of the phrase ‘or the greater part thereof ’ was made at the demand of the British, who hoped that the ambiguity of this formula could attract Hungary onto their side. Romania participated in the military eﬀort against the Axis, as it had vowed, but the Soviet Union turned the territorial issue into a blackmail tool for satellization and communization. On 14 November 1944, the whole Romanian administration of northern Transylvania was withdrawn, and replaced by a Soviet military administration. The decision to impose a Soviet military administration in Transylvania was communicated in Bucharest by A.Y. Vyshinski, Deputy People’s Commissioner for Foreign Aﬀairs, Soviet chargé d’aﬀaires for the application of the provisions of the Armistice Convention with Romania (Constantiniu 2001: 70). Thus Bucharest decision-makers were inﬂuenced by an important blackmail factor, with multiple purposes: continuing war eﬀorts on the Western front; giving up Bessarabia and northern Bukovina indeﬁnitely; and accepting a government controlled by the Soviets (Sălăgean 2002: 39). Simultaneously, the communists began an intense activity of subversion in order to achieve power. On 24 September 1944, Frontul Naţional Democrat (FND – the National Democratic Front), was formed by the PCR and PSD, joined by other satellite parties. Following political pressure, the communists, with Soviet support, obtained six ministries and secretariats in the second Sănătescu government (4 November 1944). New political tensions caused by the communists followed and a new government was established, led by General Nicolae Rădescu (Giurescu 1996). He was not favourable to the communists and in a harsh radio address, on 12 February 1945, he criticized the agitations they had produced. New street violence followed and the Red Army disarmed the Romanian army in Bucharest. Moscow demanded the resignation of the Rădescu government, which was dismissed by King Michael I on 27 February. A.Y. Vyshinski arrived in Bucharest to pressure Michael I to accept a pro-communist government led by Petru Groza (Ciuceanu et al 1997). The Anglo-Americans present in the Allied Control Commission could not 24\n\nThe Establishment of the Communist Regime (1944–7)\n\nprevent the Soviet undertaking. On 6 March 1945, a government led by Petru Groza was established, made up of communists, social democrats and dissidents from the traditional parties (PNL – Gheorghe Tătărescu, and PN Ţ – Anton Alexandrescu). The Soviets tried to create the perception of a grand coalition, which could be presented to the AngloAmericans as a democratic and representative government. As Romania proved to be docile, on 9 March 1945 the Romanian administration was restored in northern Transylvania. The PCR could thus present to the nation that it wanted to dominate a ﬁrst success in relations with Moscow. The Communists had made a ﬁrst important step in their conquest for power, but Hitler was not yet defeated and uncertainty reigned in relations among the Big Three. Achieving power required thorough preparation.\n\nConsolidation of communist power Immediately after the Soviets imposed the Groza government, the communists went on consolidating power. The ﬁrst major decision after taking power was the agrarian reform. According to the agrarian reform law of 23 March 1945, the properties of ethnic Germans and Romanians who had collaborated with Nazi Germany were expropriated, as well as the lands of ‘war criminals and those guilty of the country’s disaster’ and individual properties larger than 50 hectares. Great landowners were also dispossessed of agricultural machinery and equipment. Almost 1.46 million hectares were expropriated; 1.1 million hectares were given to 0.91 million people, the rest remained state property. The size of allotment properties could not go above 5 hectares. In order to avoid fragmented properties, as had happened after the 1921 agrarian reform, the beneﬁciaries of allotments could not sell or mortgage their new property. The agrarian reform attracted the sympathy of a part of the peasantry for the communists, but this did not guarantee that they could win free elections. For this reason, the communist leaders, supported by the Soviets, undertook systematic action to weaken the democratic parties. First, the Communists hid behind alliances with various obscure political groups, such as Frontul Plugarilor (the Ploughmen’s Front), in order to create the impression that they were numerous and strong. Second, the PN Ţ and PNL were submitted to various administrative chicaneries by the Groza government and the members of these parties began to be eliminated from the administration. Third, dissidences from the traditional parties were encouraged. In December 1944, liberal Gheorghe Tătărescu formed a new liberal party, which was kept in government until November 1947. In February 1945, dissidence emerged in the PN Ţ, led by Anton Alexandrescu, who became Minister of Cooperation in the Groza government. He was eliminated from the government after the 19 November 1946 elections. One dissidence which the Communists did not want was that from the PSD (March 1946). At their congress, partisans of an alliance with the communists (Lothar Rădăceanu and Ştefan Voitec) prevailed, and Constantin Titel-Petrescu founded a new party 25\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\n(PSD -Independent), close to the PN Ţ and PNL . Accidental allies of the communists (‘fellow travellers’), they were useful both for creating confusion in Romanian society and for gaining international legitimacy for the Groza government by including some non-communist parties. After the Potsdam Conference the ﬁrst great political crisis occurred. The USSR recognized the Groza government on 6 August 1945, but the Anglo-Americans refused, as they did not consider it suﬃciently representative from a democratic point of view. Encouraged by this situation, on 19 August King Michael I asked Prime Minister Groza to resign, in order to allow the formation of a new government recognized by the Big Three. The latter refused, knowing that he was supported by Stalin. As a reaction, Michael I refused to validate governmental documents and meet with ministers (a ‘royal strike’). Following the Moscow Conference in December 1945 of the foreign aﬀairs ministers of the Big Three, the US and the UK agreed to recognize the Groza government on condition that it included some representatives from the PN Ţ and PNL . Emil Haţieganu from PN Ţ and Mihail Romniceanu from PNL were accepted in minor governmental positions. As a result of this solution endorsed by the Anglo-Americans, Michael I resumed relations with the Groza government, which was recognized by the US and the UK on 5 February 1946. Meanwhile, political confrontations took place in the country. On 8 November 1945, the PNL and PN Ţ organized a support rally for Michael I in Bucharest, on the occasion of his name day. The Groza government, backed by the Soviets, repressed the rally (leaving eleven dead). Winning Romanians’ sympathy was diﬃcult for the Groza government, as it had undertaken the application of the Armistice Convention, under the trusteeship of the Allied (Soviet) Control Commission in Bucharest. From May 1945, no less than sixteen joint Romanian-Soviet companies (Sovrom) were set up for the purpose of ‘increasing economic cooperation’. Also, the abusive manner in which war reparations payment were made was perceived as a Soviet spoliation helped by their local instrument, the PCR . Punishment of those guilty of war crimes, according to article 14 of the Armistice Convention, was a diﬃcult issue, as the perception of the victors was diﬀerent from that of the population. In 1945, legislation was adopted to punish not only war criminals, but also those responsible for ‘the country’s disaster’. The task of judging was attributed to the People’s Court, an ad hoc judicial court. In the beginning, fourteen ‘fascist journalists’ were judged, although not all of them were Legionaries. In 1946, the so-called ‘Great National Betrayal Trial’ took place. Brought back from detention in the USSR in order to be judged, Antonescu and other leaders of his regime were either sentenced to death or to long prison terms. The former Leader of the state and three of his collaborators were executed in the Jilava penitentiary on 1 June 1946. The PCR managed to take over power institutions, subordinate the secret services and dominate the Army by means of political activists from the ‘Tudor Vladimirescu’ Division, formed in 1943 from among Romanian prisoners in the USSR . The rhythm of power-acquiring actions was dictated from Moscow, which had control over the whole process of Eastern Europe sovietization. 26\n\nThe Establishment of the Communist Regime (1944–7)\n\nThe PCR: from political sect to mass party Established in 1921, the PCR had been dissolved in 1924 on the grounds that it was a section of the Comintern, which had been involved in violent events in Bessarabia, with the purpose of destabilizing Greater Romania. Mostly made up of ethnic minority members, the Communists considered the Romanian state to be ‘artiﬁcial’ and ‘imperialist’. Until 1944, the PCR was just a ‘messianic sect’ (Tismăneanu 2003), marked by inﬁghting, without any real appeal to society. At the time of its entry into legality, the PCR only had around 1,000 members. The Communist leaders’ main objective was to increase the number of party members. The presence of Soviet troops in Romania and their status as an occupation force was the main element which from the ﬁrst part of 1945 indicated the entrance of the Romanian state under Soviet hegemony. The PCR was seen as a political opportunity or a protecting shield for people with a past in the ML . PCR leaders (mainly Ana Pauker), assisted by Soviet advisors encouraged massive party registration, without taking into account the political past or the human and political quality of new members. Numerous ML members and sympathizers were accepted within the PCR’s ranks. In folklore there was even the saying ‘Comrade, don’t be sad, the Guard [ML ] continues in the Communist Party!’ The statistics of PCR members indicate an upward trend: October 1944 – 5,000 members; February 1945 – 15,000; April 1945 – 42,653; June 1945 – 110,041; October 1945 – 256,863; June 1946 – 717,490; December 1947 – 799,351 members (Cătănuş and Neacşu 1998). The PCR’s numerical ascent hid the terrible struggle for power among factions. The logic of the power struggle was merciless: those who lost power could even lose their lives. Within the PCR , there were three factions at the moment of taking power (Tismăneanu et al. 2007: 119–25). The ﬁrst was the party leadership, whose head, Ştefan Foriş was removed from the helm of the party as early as April 1944, and was killed in 1946. The second group was made up of communist illegalists from prison (mostly ethnic Romanians) whose main leader was the railway worker Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (imprisoned since 1933, he had escaped only ten days before 23 August 1944). The third group was made up of émigré communists from Moscow (most of them ethnic minority members), their undisputed leader being Ana Pauker. She occupied an important position following her activity within the Comintern. In October 1944 the PCR had a collective leadership, made up of Gheorghiu-Dej, Pauker and Vasile Luca (the latter also from the ‘Muscovite’ group). Following a visit to Moscow, in September 1945, Gheorghiu-Dej obtained Stalin’s agreement to take over the PCR leadership as secretary general, a situation which was formalized on the occasion of the National Conference of October 1945. The imposition of Gheorghiu-Dej at the helm of the PCR (instead of Ana Pauker) can be explained by the fact that he was an ethnic Romanian and had a ‘healthy social origin’ (he was a worker) while Pauker was a woman of Jewish origin and had not spent time in jail. During this acquisition of state power there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences of vision between the three factions. The communist leaders all agreed with Soviet satellization 27\n\nRomania since the Second World War\n\nand political and institutional change according to the Soviet model. All displayed a humble fear towards Stalin, as they knew their political and human destiny depended on the decisions of the Soviet leader. All important state and party decisions were taken following orders from Moscow or at least with Soviet approval.\n\nRigging the 19 November 1946 elections The promises made to Europeans by the Great Powers in the Yalta ‘Declaration on liberated Europe’ concerning their right to decide their governments, following free elections, meant that at least an appearance of fairness had to be maintained. Parliamentary elections were thus organized in the countries occupied by the USSR . They were relatively fair in Hungary in 1945 and Czechoslovakia in 1946, but completely rigged in favour of local communists in Bulgaria and Romania in 1946 and Poland in 1947 (Ţârău 2005). After the Anglo-American recognition of the Petru Groza government on 5 February 1946 and the resumption of diplomatic relations, the grounds were created for elections which could be recognized as ‘free and fair’ by the Great Powers. Conscious of their weak popular support, but also of Soviet backing for their conquest of power, the communists established a political alliance on 17 May 1946, called Blocul Partidelor Democratice (BPD – the Bloc of Democratic Parties), which included the PSD, the Ploughmen’s Front, the Union of Patriots, the two dissidents from the PN Ţ and the PNL , and the Jewish Democratic Committee. In contradiction with the 1923 Constitution, the Senate was abolished and the Romanian Parliament was left with only one chamber, elections being organized only for the Assembly of Deputies. Simultaneously, a new electoral law was introduced, according to which mandates were attributed following a proportional method. The main novelty was giving the right to vote to women and the military, thus making voting truly universal. However, there were also seven categories of people considered to be ‘shameful’ who were barred from participating in elections. This blocked the candidacies of some from the democratic parties, who were generically labelled as ‘fascists’. The electoral campaign from July to November outdid in violence the interwar elections, which had also been mar"
