You may also experience some issues with your browser, such as an alert box that a script is taking a long time to run.\n\nWould you like to continue?\n\nLegislation is available in different versions:\n\nLatest Available (revised):The latest available updated version of the legislation incorporating changes made by subsequent legislation and applied by our editorial team. Changes we have not yet applied to the text, can be found in the ‘Changes to Legislation’ area.\n\nOriginal (As adopted by EU): The original version of the legislation as it stood when it was first adopted in the EU. No changes have been applied to the text.\n\nTimeline of Changes\n\nThis timeline shows the different versions taken from EUR-Lex before exit day and during the implementation period as well as any subsequent versions created after the implementation period as a result of changes made by UK legislation.\n\nThe dates for the EU versions are taken from the document dates on EUR-Lex and may not always coincide with when the changes came into force for the document.\n\nFor any versions created after the implementation period as a result of changes made by UK legislation the date will coincide with the earliest date on which the change (e.g an insertion, a repeal or a substitution) that was applied came into force. For further information see our guide to revised legislation on Understanding Legislation."
