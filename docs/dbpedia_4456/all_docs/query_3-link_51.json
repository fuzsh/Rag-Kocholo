This document is a directive from the European Parliament and Council establishing a single European railway area. Some key points:\n\n- It recasts three previous directives on developing the EU's railways, licensing railway undertakings, and allocating railway infrastructure capacity in order to render railway transport more efficient and competitive. \n\n- Infrastructure managers and transport service providers should be managed separately with separate accounts, though infrastructure managers can outsource administrative tasks. \n\n- Member States should ensure railway undertakings have independent commercial status and adapt to market needs, while retaining responsibility for infrastructure development. \n\n- Rules are needed for allocating infrastructure costs among railway undertakings in a non-discriminatory manner.",
