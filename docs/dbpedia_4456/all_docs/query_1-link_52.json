        "text": "Note4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS)\n\nMains level: Read the attached story\n\nCentral Idea: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) conducts investigations into train accidents, including the recent tragic train crash in Odisha.\n\nAbout Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS)\n\nRole of CRS: CRS is a government body responsible for railway safety oversight and carries out inspectorial, investigatory, and advisory functions as mandated by the Railways Act, 1989.\n\nHeadquarters: The CRS is headquartered in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and operates under the administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).\n\nEvolution of CRS and Safety Oversight\n\nEarly Railways in India: Private companies constructed and operated the first railways in India in the 1800s, with the British Indian government appointing consulting engineers for control and oversight.\n\nEstablishment of Government Inspectors: The consulting engineers were later designated as government inspectors, and in 1883, their position was recognized statutorily.\n\nInclusion in the Railway Board: In the early 1900s, the Railway Inspectorate came under the Railway Board, established in 1905, making the board the safety controlling authority for Indian railways.\n\nSeparation of Safety Oversight and Railway Board\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935: The act stated that an independent authority, separate from the Railway Board, should be responsible for ensuring the safety of railway operations.\n\nDelayed Implementation: The outbreak of World War II in 1939 delayed the separation, and the Railway Inspectorate continued to function under the control of the Railway Board.\n\nMount Panel Report: In 1939, the Mount Panel recommended the separation of the Railway Inspectorate from the Railway Board, acknowledging the board’s agreement with the proposal.\n\nTransfer of Railway Inspectorate’s Control\n\nCentral Legislature’s Endorsement: In 1940, the Central Legislature endorsed the separation of the Railway Inspectorate from the Railway Board.\n\nAdministrative Control Shift: In May 1941, the Railway Inspectorate was transferred from the Railway Board’s control to the Department of Posts and Air.\n\nRenaming as CRS: The Inspectorate was renamed as the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) in 1961 and placed under the administrative control of the ministry overseeing civil aviation.\n\nFunctions and Responsibilities of CRS\n\nRailway Safety Oversight: CRS is responsible for ensuring the safety of rail travel and operations in India.\n\nInspectorial Functions: CRS conducts inspections of railway infrastructure, equipment, and operations to ensure compliance with safety standards.\n\nInvestigatory Functions: CRS conducts thorough investigations into serious train accidents to determine the causes and make recommendations for

collaborates with other agencies and organizations involved in railway safety, such as the National Safety Council and the Indian Railways Institute of Civil Engineering.\n\nWhy does it function under MCA?\n\nInsulation from Railway Establishment: CRS operates under the administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation to maintain independence and prevent conflicts of interest.\n\nObjective Decision-Making: Independence from the railway establishment ensures impartiality in accident investigations and safety oversight.\n\nEnhanced Credibility: The separation of CRS from the Railway Board enhances the credibility of safety oversight and investigations.\n\nFuture Challenges and Priorities\n\nModernization and Technology Integration: CRS focuses on integrating advanced technologies and modernizing railway infrastructure to enhance safety.\n\nSafety Culture and Behavioral Change: Promoting a strong safety culture and fostering behavioral change among railway staff and passengers are key priorities.\n\nAddressing Emerging Risks: CRS continuously assesses and addresses emerging safety risks, such as cybersecurity threats and climate change impacts, in railway operations.\n\nInternational Collaboration and Best Practices\n\nKnowledge Sharing: CRS actively participates in international forums and collaborates with global railway safety organizations to exchange best practices and enhance safety standards.\n\nBenchmarking and Learning: CRS benchmarks its safety practices against international standards and adopts relevant best practices to improve railway safety in India.\n\nHarmonization of Safety Regulations: CRS contributes to the harmonization of safety regulations and standards with international frameworks to ensure interoperability and seamless rail connectivity.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now"
