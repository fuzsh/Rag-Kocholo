Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2005/30/EC (OJ L 106, 27.4.2005, p. 17).\n\nArticle 2 Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, ‘machinery’ designates the products listed in Article 1(1 )(a) to (f).\n\nThe following definitions shall apply:\n\n(a) ‘machinery’ means:\n\nan assembly, fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system other than directly applied human or animal effort, consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, and which are joined together for a specific application,\n\nan assembly referred to in the first indent, missing only the components to connect it on site or to sources of energy and motion,\n\nan assembly referred to in the first and second indents, ready to be installed and able to function as it stands only if mounted on a means of transport, or installed in a building or a structure,\n\nassemblies of machinery referred to in the first, second and third indents or partly completed machinery referred to in point (g) which, in order to achieve the same\n\nend, are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole,\n\n an assembly of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves and which are joined together, intended for lifting loads and whose only power source is directly applied human effort;\n\n‘interchangeable equipment’ means a device which, after the putting into service of machinery or of a tractor, is assembled with that machinery or tractor by the operator himself in order to change its function or attribute a new function, in so far as this equipment is not a tool;\n\n‘safety component’ means a component:\n\nwhich serves to fulfil a safety function,\n\nwhich is independently placed on the market,\n\nthe failure and/or malfunction of which endangers the safety of persons, and\n\nwhich is not necessary in order for the machinery to function, or for which normal components may be substituted in order for the machinery to function.\n\nAn indicative list of safety components is set out in Annex V, which may be updated in accordance with Article 8 (1) (a);\n\n‘lifting accessory’ means a component or equipment not attached to the lifting machinery, allowing the load to be held, which is placed between the machinery and the load or on the load itself, or which is intended to constitute an integral part of the load and which is independently placed on the market; slings and their components are also regarded as lifting accessories;\n\n‘chains, ropes and webbing’ means chains, ropes and webbing designed and\n\nconstructed for lifting purposes as part of lifting machinery or lifting accessories;\n\n‘removable mechanical transmission device’ means a removable component for transmitting power between self-propelled machinery or a tractor and another machine by joining them at the first fixed bearing. When it is placed on the market with the guard it shall be regarded as one product;\n\n‘partly completed machinery’ means an assembly which is almost machinery but which cannot in itself perform a specific application. A drive system is partly completed machinery. Partly completed machinery is only intended to be incorporated into or assembled with other machinery or other partly completed machinery or equipment, thereby forming machinery to which this Directive applies;\n\n. . .\n\n§32 The products covered by the Machinery Directive\n\nArticle 1 (1) sets out the scope of the Directive, that is to say the products to which the provisions of the Directive are applicable. Each of the seven categories listed in Article 1 (1), (a) to (g) is subject to a definition given in Article 2, (a) to (g). Consequently, Article 1 must be read together with Article 2. In the following comments, each of the seven categories of product subject to the Machinery Directive is examined in turn, together with its definition.\n\n§33 The use of the term ‘machinery’ in the broad sense\n\nThe first product category referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) and defined in Article 2 (a) is machinery. In Article 1 (1) (a) and Article 2 (a) the term ‘machinery’ is used in the strict sense. However, the definitions of the product categories set out in Article 2 are preceded by a sentence explaining that the term ‘machinery’ is also to be understood in a broad sense to refer to the six product categories referred to in Article 1 (1), (a) to (f).\n\nThe obligations set out in the articles of the Directive that apply to machinery shall thus be understood as applying both to machinery in the strict sense referred to in Article 1(1) (a) and also to the products referred to in Article 1(1) (b) to (f): interchangeable equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing and removable mechanical transmission devices.\n\nThis is the case, for example, for the obligations set out in Article 4 (1) on market surveillance, Article 5 (1) relating to placing on the market and putting into service, Article 6 (1) on freedom of movement, Article 7 (1) and (2) on presumption of conformity and harmonised standards, Article 9 on specific measures to deal with potentially hazardous machinery, Article 11 on the safeguard clause, Article 12 on the procedures for assessing the conformity of machinery, Article 15 on installation and use of machinery, Article 16 on CE marking, Article 17 on non-conformity of marking and Article 20 on legal remedies. The obligations set out in these Articles do not apply to partly completed machinery referred to in Article 1 (1) (g).\n\nWhere obligations apply to partly completed machinery, this is explicitly stated, for example, in Article 4 (2) on market surveillance, Article 5 (2) relating to placing on the market, Article 6 (2) on freedom of movement and Article 13 on the procedure for partly completed machinery.\n\nWhere obligations apply both to machinery in the broad sense and also to partly completed machinery, this is also explicitly stated, for example, in Article 4 (3) on market surveillance and Article 6 (3) on freedom of movement.\n\nIn the essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to the Machinery Directive, the term ‘machinery’ is generally to be understood in the broad sense to designate any of the product categories referred to in Article 1 (1), (a) to (f). Where certain essential health and safety requirements are applicable to only one or more of these categories, this is explicitly stated or can be inferred from the context. For example, in part 4 of Annex I, certain requirements explicitly apply only to lifting accessories.\n\n§34 Machinery in the strict sense\n\nThe product category referred to in Article 1 (1) (a), that is to say machinery in the strict sense, is defined in Article 2 (a). The definition includes five indents. In the following comments, the different elements of each indent of the definition are examined in turn.\n\n§35 The basic definition\n\nThe first indent of the definition of 'machinery' includes the following elements:\n\n. . . an assembly . . . consisting of linked parts or components . . .\n\nProducts with parts or components that are not linked together in an assembly are not considered as machinery.\n\nThis does not preclude the supply of machinery with certain parts disassembled for storage or transport purposes. In such cases, the machinery must be designed and constructed in order to prevent errors of fitting when the separate parts are assembled. This is particularly important if the machinery is intended for untrained non-professional users. The manufacturer must also provide adequate assembly instructions, taking account, where appropriate, of the level of general education and acumen that can reasonably be expected from non-professional users – see §225: comments on section 1.5.4, §259: comments on section 1.7.4.1 (d), and §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I.\n\n. . . at least one of which moves . . .\n\nProducts without moving parts are not considered as machinery.\n\n. . . fitted with or intended to be fitted with a drive system . . .\n\nThe moving parts of machinery are powered by a drive system using one or more sources of energy such as thermal, electric, pneumatic, hydraulic or mechanical energy. The machinery may have a motor using its own source of energy such as thermal energy or energy provided by a battery. It may be connected to one or more external sources of energy such as a supply of electricity or compressed air. Machinery may use mechanical energy supplied by other equipment such as, for example, towed agricultural machinery that is driven by the power take-off of a tractor, or test beds for motor vehicles that are driven by the vehicles being tested; machinery may also be powered by natural sources of energy such as wind or water power.\n\nUsually the manufacturer of complete machinery supplies the machinery fitted with its drive system. However, machines intended to be fitted with a drive system but supplied without it may also be considered as machinery. This provision takes account, for example, of the fact that certain users of machinery prefer to have a homogeneous stock of motors for their machines in order to facilitate maintenance.\n\nFor machinery to be supplied without a drive system:\n\nthe manufacturer's risk assessment must take into account all the risks associated with the machinery, including those relating to the drive system to be fitted to the machinery – see §158: comments on General Principle 1 of Annex I;\n\nthe machinery manufacturer must set out in his instructions all the necessary specifications for the drive system to be fitted such as the type, power and means of connection, and provide precise fitting instructions for the drive system – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I;\n\nthe conformity assessment of the machinery must cover the specifications of the drive system to be fitted and the fitting instructions;\n\nthe CE-marking on the machinery and the EC Declaration of Conformity that accompanies the machinery must cover the specifications and instructions relating to the drive system to be fitted.\n\nIf the above conditions are not fulfilled, machinery without a fully specified drive system must be considered as partly completed machinery (PCM) – see §46: comments on Article 2 (g). In that case, the combination of such partly completed machinery and the drive system must be considered as the final machinery and must be subject to a specific conformity assessment – see §38: comments on the fourth indent of Article 1\n\n(a).\n\n. . . other than directly applied human or animal effort . . .\n\nThe moving parts of machinery subject to the Machinery Directive must be driven by a source of energy other than directly applied human or animal effort. Machinery driven by directly applied human or animal effort, such as, for example, hand-driven lawn mowers, hand drills or hand-pushed trolleys, which cease to operate as soon as the manual effort is no longer applied, are not subject to the Machinery Directive. Lifting machinery is the only exception to this general rule – see §40: comments on the fifth indent of Article 2\n\n(a).\n\nOn the other hand, the Machinery Directive is applicable to machinery driven by manual effort which is not applied directly but stored, for example, in springs or in hydraulic or pneumatic accumulators, so that the machinery can function after the manual effort has ceased.\n\n. . . which are joined together for a specific application . . .\n\nMachinery must be useable for a specific application as applying to the complete machine and its intended use. Typical machinery specific applications include, for example, the processing, treatment, or packaging of materials, or the moving of materials, objects or persons.\n\n§36 Machinery supplied without connection components\n\nThe second indent of the definition of machinery recognises that the characteristics of the components needed to connect a machine on site to the sources of energy and motion may depend on the site where the machinery is to be used or installed. Machinery may therefore be supplied without these components. In that case, the machinery manufacturer must set out in his instructions all the necessary specifications for the safe means of connection – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I.\n\n§37 Machinery to be installed on a specific support\n\nThe third indent of the definition of machinery refers to machinery intended for installation on a means of transport or in a building or a structure.\n\nMeans of transport are, in general, excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive, but machinery mounted on means of transport are subject to the Machinery Directive – see §54: comments on Article 1 (2) (e). Examples of machinery mounted on means of transport include, for example, loader cranes, tail lifts, tipper bodies, vehicle or trailermounted compressors, vehicle-mounted compaction systems, vehicle-mounted concrete mixers, skip loaders, powered winches, tippers, telescopic lifting arms and vehiclemounted mobile elevating work platforms.\n\nWhere such machinery is mounted on road vehicles, road trailers or tractors that are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive, the requirements of the Machinery Directive do not apply to the road vehicle, road trailer or tractor itself. However, the requirements of the Machinery Directive apply both to the mounted machinery and to all aspects of the interface between the machinery and the chassis on which it is mounted which may affect the safe travel and operation of the machinery. Machinery mounted on means of transport is therefore distinguished from self-propelled mobile machinery such as, for example, self-propelled construction machinery or self-propelled agricultural machinery, which is subject to the Machinery Directive in its entirety.\n\nThe third indent of the definition of machinery implies that the manufacturer of machinery intended to be installed on a means of transport or installed in a building or a structure is responsible for the conformity of the machinery with the relevant essential health and safety requirements. He must affix the CE-marking on the machinery and draw up and sign the EC Declaration of Conformity. The manufacturer of such machinery must take into account in his risk assessment all the risks associated with the machine, including those relating to installation of the machinery on the chassis of a vehicle or trailer or on a supporting structure – see §158: comments on General Principle 1 of Annex I. The machinery manufacturer shall set out in his instructions the necessary specifications for the supporting structure and provide precise installation instructions – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I.\n\nManufacturers of machinery intended to be installed on means of transport must therefore specify the vehicles or trailers on which the machinery can be safely installed, either by reference to their technical characteristics or, where necessary, by reference to specific models of vehicle.\n\nIf a product intended to be installed on a means of transport is not supplied ready to install, for example, if important elements such as the supporting frame or stabilisers are missing, it should rather be considered as partly completed machinery – see §46: comments on Article 2 (g). In that case, the person who assembles the partly completed machinery and the other elements on the means of transport is to be considered as the manufacturer of the final machinery.\n\nManufacturers of machinery intended to be installed in a building or structure such as, for example, gantry cranes, certain lifts or escalators must specify the characteristics, in particular the load-bearing characteristics, of the structure needed to support the machinery. However, the machinery manufacturer is not responsible for the construction of the building or structure itself – see §262: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i), and §361: comments on 4.4.2 (a) of Annex I.\n\nThe person who installs such a machine on a means of transport or in a building or structure is responsible for carrying out the machinery manufacturers’ installation instructions.\n\nThe conformity assessment of machinery intended to be installed on a means of transport or in a building or structure covers the machinery itself, the specifications for the supporting structure and the installation instructions. The necessary tests and inspections must be carried out on the machinery installed on its support in order to check the conformity with the essential health and safety requirements. The CE-marking on the machine and the EC Declaration of Conformity that must accompany the machine cover the conformity of the machine itself and the specifications and instructions relating to its installation.\n\nIn the case of machinery intended for lifting operations, the manufacturer is responsible for checking the fitness for purpose of the machinery ready to be put into service – see §350 to §352: comments on section 4.1.3, and §361: comments on section 4.4 2 (e) of Annex I.\n\nCertain categories of machinery to be installed in buildings are also subject to Directive 89/106/EC on Construction Products, such as, for example, powered gates, doors, windows, shutters and blinds – see §92: comments on Article 3.\n\n§38 Assemblies of machinery\n\nThe fourth indent deals with assemblies of machinery consisting of two or more machines or partly completed machines assembled together for a specific application. Assemblies of machinery may be constituted by two units such as, for example, a packaging machine and a labelling machine, or by several units assembled together, for example, in a production line.\n\nThe definition of assemblies of machinery indicates that assemblies are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole in order to achieve the same end. For a group of units of machinery or partly completed machinery to be considered as an assembly of machinery, all of these criteria must be fulfilled:\n\nthe constituent units are assembled together in order to carry out a common function, for example, the production of a given product;\n\nthe constituent units are functionally linked in such a way that the operation of each unit directly affects the operation of other units or of the assembly as a whole, so that a risk assessment is necessary for the whole assembly;\n\nthe constituent units have a common control system – see §184: comments on section 1.2.1, and §203: comments on section 1.2.4.4 of Annex I.\n\nA group of machines that are connected to each other but where each machine functions independently of the others is not considered as an assembly of machinery in the above sense.\n\nThe definition of assemblies of machinery does not extend to a complete industrial plant consisting of a number of production lines each made up of a number of machines, assemblies of machinery and other equipment, even if they are controlled together by a single production control system. Only if the plant (which may be any combination of machinery, partly completed machinery and other equipment resulting in machinery subject to the Machinery Directive) forms a single integrated line is it subject to the Machinery Directive as an assembly. So for the purpose of applying the Machinery Directive, most industrial plants can be divided into different sections, each of which may be a distinct assembly (of machinery) or even an independent machine (e.g. a mixing vessel). Even a single production line may be divided into separate assemblies and/or machines if there is no safety related connection between constituent assemblies or machinery.\n\nHowever, where risks are created by the interfaces with other sections of the plant these must be covered by the installation instructions – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I.\n\nIt should also be noted that the placing on the market of equipment installed in industrial plants that is not in the scope of the Machinery Directive may be subject to other EU internal market legislation – see §89 to §92: comments on Article 3.\n\nThe person constituting an assembly of machinery is considered as the manufacturer of the assembly of machinery and is responsible for ensuring that the assembly as a whole complies with the health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive – see §79: comments on Articles 2 (i). In some cases, the manufacturer of the assembly of machinery is also the manufacturer of the constituent units. However, more frequently, the constituent units are placed on the market by other manufacturers, either as complete machinery that could also operate independently according to the first, second or third indents of Article 2 (a), or as partly completed machinery according to Article 2 (g).\n\nIf the units concerned are placed on the market as complete machinery that could also operate independently, they must bear the CE marking and be accompanied by an EC Declaration of Conformity – see §103: comments on Article 5 (1). If they are placed on the market as partly completed machinery, they must not bear the CE-marking, but note that if other legislation providing for CE marking also apply (e.g. ATEX Directive, Radio Equipment Directive, etc.), a CE marking will have been applied, in which case the Declaration of Conformity should state it only covers that legislation. In all cases the partly completed machinery must be accompanied by a Declaration of Incorporation under the Machinery Directive together with assembly instructions – see §104: comments on Articles 5 (2), and §131, comments on Article 13.\n\nAssemblies of machinery are subject to the Machinery Directive because their safety depends not just on the safe design and construction of their constituent units but also on the suitability of the units linked together and the safety of the interfaces between them. At the interface modifications to or extra, guarding/protection devices may need to be designed and fitted so that the assembly as a whole is compliant. The risk assessment to be carried out by the manufacturer of an assembly of machinery must therefore cover both the suitability of the constituent units for the safety of the assembly as a whole and the hazards resulting from the interfaces between the constituent units. It must also cover any hazards resulting from the assembly that are not covered by the EC Declaration of Conformity (for machinery) or the Declaration of Incorporation and the assembly instructions (for partly completed machinery) supplied by the manufacturers of the constituent units.\n\nThe manufacturer of the assembly of machinery must:\n\ncarry out the appropriate conformity assessment procedure for the assembly of machinery – see §127 to §130: comments on Article 12;\n\naffix a specific marking (for example, a specific plate) to the assembly of machinery with the information required by section 1.7.3 and, where appropriate, sections 3.6.2, 4.3.3 and 6.5 of Annex I, including the CE marking;\n\ndraw up and sign an EC Declaration of Conformity for the assembly of machinery - see §103: comments on Article 5 (1).\n\ncompile the technical file which must contain the results of the risk assessment and the design details of the interfaces (e.g. guards, linking conveyers, hoppers, feeders and electronic interface devices) between the items. It must also document any modifications that have been made to the constituent units when incorporating the new items into the assembly. The EC Declaration of Conformity for complete machines and the Declaration of Incorporation and the assembly instructions for partly completed machinery incorporated into the assembly of machinery must also be included in the technical file for the assembly of machinery – see §392: comments on Annex VII A 1 (a).\n\n§39 Assemblies comprising new and existing machinery\n\nThe Machinery Directive applies to machinery when it is first placed on the market and put into service in the EU. This is, in general, new machinery – see §72: comments on Article 2 (h). Consequently, the assemblies of machinery referred to in the fourth indent of Article 2 (a) are often new assemblies of new machinery. For machinery in service (used at work), the employer must ensure that the conformity and safety of the machinery is maintained throughout its working life, according to the national regulations implementing Directive 2009/104/EC – see §140: comments on Article 15 and following the manufacturer’s instructions – see §272, comments on section 1.7.4.2 (r) of Annex I.\n\nWhere, one or more of the constituent units of existing assemblies of machinery may be replaced by new units, or new units may be added to an existing assembly of machinery, the question arises as to whether an assembly of machinery comprising new and existing units is, as a whole, subject to the Machinery Directive. It is not possible to give precise criteria for answering this question in each particular case. In doubt, it is therefore advisable for the person constituting such an assembly of machinery to consult the relevant national authorities. However, the following general guidance can be given:\n\nIf the risk assessment[1] shows that the replacement or the addition of a constituent unit in an existing assembly of machinery does not add a new hazard, nor increase an existing risk, no action is required according to the Machinery Directive for the parts of the assembly that are not affected by the modification. The same applies where there is a new hazard, or an increase in an existing risk, but the existing protective measures present on the assembly before the modification are still sufficient so that the assembly can still be considered safe after modification. However, for those parts of the assembly that are affected by the replacement or the addition of a constituent unit, action under the Machinery Directive will be required. The employer remains responsible for the safety of the whole assembly according to\n\nthe national provisions implementing Directive 2009/104/EC – see §140: comments on Article 15.\n\nIf the risk assessment[2] for the new unit shows it does not have any safety implications (e.g. by requiring modifications) on the existing assembly and it is a complete machinery that could also operate independently, that bears the CE-marking and is accompanied by an EC Declaration of Conformity, then the addition of this new unit (as a complete machinery) into the existing assembly is to be considered as the installation of the new unit (machinery) and this does not give rise to a new conformity assessment, CE marking or EC Declaration of Conformity for either the new unit (machinery) or the assembly to which is added..\n\nHowever, if the new unit to be added to the assembly comprises partly completed machinery (PCM) as defined by Art. 2 (g) , which must be accompanied by a Declaration of Incorporation and assembly instructions, the person incorporating the PCM into the assembly is to be considered as the manufacturer of the new unit (as by incorporating the PCM in the assembly, ‘new’ machinery is being put into service). He must therefore assess any risks arising from the interface between the PCM, other equipment and the assembly of machinery, fulfil any relevant EHSRs that have not been applied by the manufacturer of the PCM, apply the assembly instructions, draw up an EC Declaration of conformity, compile the technical file for the modified parts of the assembly (essentially how the PCM has been put into service, including any changes to the existing assembly) and affix the CE marking to the new unit as assembled. For example, if a new automatic reel change unit, which is a partly completed machinery, is added to the end of a paper making line which will not affect the main parts of the line, then only the interface design and any modifications to the control system or to the existing assembly will need to be assessed for the purposes of CE marking the unit, as fitted.\n\nIf the replacement or the addition of new constituent units in an existing assembly of machinery has a substantial impact on the operation or the safety of the assembly as a whole or involves substantial modifications of the assembly, it may be considered that the modification amounts to the constitution of a new assembly of machinery to which the Machinery Directive must be applied. In that case, the whole assembly, including all its constituent units, must comply with the provisions of the Machinery Directive. This may also be required if a new assembly of machinery is constituted from new and second-hand units.\n\n§40 Manually powered machinery for lifting loads\n\nThe fifth indent of the definition of machinery sets out an exception to the general rule that manually powered machinery is excluded from the Machinery Directive. Manually powered machinery intended for lifting loads, whether goods or persons or both, is subject to the Machinery Directive – see §328: comments on section 4.1.1 (a) of Annex I. Examples of such machinery include manually powered hoists and cranes, jacks, lifting tables, pallet and stacker trucks and mobile elevating work platforms. Products which do not lift a load but simply maintain it at a given height are not covered by this definition.\n\n§41 Interchangeable equipment\n\nInterchangeable equipment referred to in Article 1 (1) (b) is defined in Article 2 (b). It should be noted that interchangeable equipment is also designated by the term\n\n‘machinery’ used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of\n\nArticle 2.\n\nIn the following comments, the different elements of the definition of interchangeable equipment are examined in turn.\n\n. . . after the putting into service of machinery or of a tractor . . .\n\nInterchangeable equipment is equipment that is designed and constructed in order to be assembled with machinery after the basic machinery has been put into service. Equipment that is assembled with machinery by the manufacturer when the machinery is placed on the market and that is not intended to be changed by the user is not considered as interchangeable equipment but is considered as part of the machinery.\n\nOne or more items of interchangeable equipment may be supplied by the machinery manufacturer together with the basic machinery or by another manufacturer. In either case, each item of interchangeable equipment shall be considered as a separate product and must be accompanied by a separate EC Declaration of Conformity, bear the CE marking and be supplied with its own instructions.\n\n. . . is assembled with that machinery or tractor by the operator himself . . .\n\nThe fact that interchangeable equipment is intended to be assembled with the machinery implies that the combination of the basic machinery and the interchangeable equipment functions as an integral whole. Equipment that is used with the machinery but not assembled with it is not to be considered as interchangeable equipment. Equipment that requires significant modifications to the “parent machine” by the user when adding and removing the item or it is not designed to be removed or added on a routine basis, is not regarded as “interchangeable equipment”.\n\n. . . in order to change its function or attribute a new function, in so far as this equipment is not a tool . . .\n\nInterchangeable equipment should not be confused with spare parts that do not change the function of the machinery or attribute a new function to it but that are simply intended to replace worn or damaged parts.\n\nInterchangeable equipment is also distinguished from tools, such as, for example, blades, bits, simple earthmoving buckets, etc. which do not change or attribute a new function to the basic machinery. Tools as such are not subject to the Machinery Directive (although the machinery manufacturer must specify the essential characteristics of tools which may be fitted to the machinery – see §268: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (n) of Annex I.\n\nExamples of interchangeable equipment include equipment assembled with agricultural or forestry tractors for functions such as ploughing, harvesting, lifting or loading, and equipment assembled with earth-moving equipment, for functions such as drilling or demolition. Work platforms intended to be assembled with lifting machinery in order to modify its function for the purpose of lifting persons are interchangeable equipment – see §388: comments on Annex IV, item 17. Other examples of interchangeable equipment are supports intended for assembly with portable hand-held machines to convert them into fixed machines and interchangeable power-feed units for woodworking machinery.\n\nInterchangeable equipment may be placed on the market by the manufacturer of the basic machinery or by another manufacturer. In either case, the manufacturer of the interchangeable equipment must specify in his instructions the machinery with which it can be safely assembled and used, either by reference to the technical characteristics of the machinery or, where necessary, by reference to specific models of machinery. He must also provide the necessary instructions for safe assembly and use of the interchangeable equipment – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) of Annex I.\n\nThe manufacturer of the interchangeable equipment must ensure that the combination of the interchangeable equipment and the basic machinery with which it is intended to be assembled fulfils all the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Annex I and must carry out the appropriate conformity assessment procedure.\n\nIt should be noted that the assembly of interchangeable equipment with basic machinery may have the effect of creating a combination that belongs to one of the categories of machinery listed in Annex IV. This may be the case, for example, if a support is assembled with hand-held woodworking machine to convert it into fixed machinery such as a circular saw bench or a vertical spindle moulding machine; or when a work platform is assembled with lifting machinery in order to modify its function for the purpose of lifting persons.[3] In such cases, the manufacturer of the interchangeable equipment must carry out a risk assessment for the combination of the interchangeable equipment and the basic machinery and apply one of the conformity assessment procedures foreseen for Annex IV machinery – see §129 and §130: comments on Article 12. The conformity assessment must ensure that the assembly of the interchangeable equipment and the type or types of basic machinery with which it is intended to be assembled complies with all the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Annex I.\n\nThe requisite information relating to the conformity assessment of the combination of the interchangeable equipment and the basic machinery shall be mentioned in the EC Declaration of conformity for the interchangeable equipment. The instructions for the interchangeable equipment must also specify the type or types of basic machinery with which the equipment is intended to be assembled and include the necessary assembly instructions – see §264: comments on section 1.7.4.2 (i) and §416: guidance document on interchangeable equipment for lifting persons.\n\nArticle 2\n\n. . .\n\n(c) ‘safety component’ means a component:\n\nwhich serves to fulfil a safety function,\n\nwhich is independently placed on the market,\n\nthe failure and/or malfunction of which endangers the safety of persons, and\n\nwhich is not necessary in order for the machinery to function, or for which normal components may be substituted in order for the machinery to function.\n\nAn indicative list of safety components is set out in Annex V, which may be updated in accordance with Article 8(1)(a);\n\n§42 Safety components\n\nSafety components referred to in Article 1 (1) (c) are defined in Article 2 (c). It should be noted that safety components are also designated by the term ‘machinery’ used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2.\n\nThe safety function serves to fulfil a protective measure to eliminate or, if not possible, to reduce a risk: this action being either inherent in the design or triggered either automatically, or through intervention by the operator on the safety component (as is the case with an emergency stop device, seat belt or two-hand control device).\n\nMany machinery components are critical for the health and safety of persons. However, purely operational components, by virtue of the fourth indent in Article 2 (c) above, are not considered as safety components. Safety components are components intended by the component manufacturer to be fitted to machinery specifically to fulfil a protective role, in addition to any operational duty. Components placed independently on the market that are intended by the component manufacturer for functions that are both safety and operational functions, or that are intended by the component manufacturer to be used either for safety or for operational functions are to be considered as safety components. For example, a hydraulic valve designed and specified as being capable of performing a safety function as well as normal production use, is a “safety component” where other parts of the definition are met. However, a similar valve where the manufacturer markets it only for normal production use would not be considered a safety component.\n\nThe exclusion of low-voltage switchgear and control gear set out in the fifth indent of Article 1 (2) (k) does not apply to electrical safety components – see §68: comments on Article 1 (2) (k).\n\nThe last sentence of the definition refers to the list of safety components given in Annex V. Annex V lists categories of safety component that are commonly fitted to machinery.\n\nExamination of the list helps to understand the definition of 'safety component'. However, the list is indicative, not limitative. In other words, any component that complies with the definition set out in Article 2 (c) is to be considered as a safety component subject to the Machinery Directive, even if it is not it is included in the list given in Annex V.\n\nIf, in future, safety components are identified which are not included in the list given in Annex V, for example, innovative safety components, the Commission can adopt an implementing Decision to update the list, after consulting the Machinery Committee according to the Regulatory procedure with scrutiny – see §116: comments on Article 8 (1) (a), and §147: comments on Article 22 (3). However, this procedure is not a requirement for the item to be considered as a “safety component” as this list is only indicative, this guide includes, at §389, some other items that meet the definition of “safety components” that are not currently on the list in Annex V.\n\nThe second indent of the definition set out in Article 2 (c) implies that only safety components independently placed on the market are subject as such to the Machinery Directive. Safety components manufactured by a machinery manufacturer to be incorporated in his own machinery are not subject to the Directive as such, although they must enable the machinery to comply with the relevant essential health and safety requirements. It should be noted that when such a manufacturer supplies safety components as spare parts to replace the original safety components on machinery he has placed on the market, they are not subject to the Machinery Directive – see §48: comments on Article 1 (2) (a).\n\nWith respect to the conformity assessment procedure applicable to safety components, it should be noted that certain safety components are listed in Annex IV – see §129 and §130: comments on Article 12, and §388: comments on items 19 to 23 of Annex IV.\n\nSpecific guidance on safety fences as a safety component is given in §411.\n\n§43 Lifting accessories\n\nLifting accessories referred to in Article 1 (1) (d) are defined in Article 2 (d). It should be noted that lifting accessories are also designated by the term ‘machinery’ used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2.\n\nLifting machinery usually has a device for holding the load such as, for example, a hook. Such load holding devices incorporated into lifting machinery are not to be considered as lifting accessories. However, given the varied shape, size and nature of the loads to be lifted, equipment is often placed between the holding device of the lifting machinery and the load, or on the load itself, in order to hold the load during the lifting operation. Such equipment is referred to as a lifting accessory. Products that are independently placed on the market to be incorporated into loads for this purpose are also considered as lifting accessories.\n\nEquipment placed between the holding device of lifting machinery and the load is considered as a lifting accessory, even if it is placed on the market with the lifting machinery or with the load.\n\nThe last part of the definition of ‘lifting accessories’ states:\n\n. . . slings and their components are also regarded as lifting accessories\n\nThis implies that equipment intended to be used as an independent sling or in a variety of combinations in slings to be made up by a user, for example, to make up a multi-leg sling, is considered as a lifting accessory. On the other hand, components that are intended to be incorporated in slings and that are not intended to be used independently to make up a sling are not considered as lifting accessories – see §358: comments on section 4.3.2 of Annex I.\n\nThe Machinery Committee has drawn up a list of various categories of equipment used for lifting operations, indicating which categories are considered as lifting accessories: see section §412. The list is not exhaustive but is intended to facilitate uniform interpretation and application of the Machinery Directive to lifting accessories.\n\nLifting accessories are subject to certain specific essential health and safety requirements in Part 4 of Annex I – see §337 to §341: comments on sections 4.1.2.3,\n\n4.1.2.4 and 4.1.2.5, §358: comments on section 4.3.2, and §360: comments on section 4.4.1 of Annex I.\n\n§44 Chains, ropes and webbing\n\nChains, ropes and webbing referred to in Article 1 (1) (e) are defined in Article 2 (e).\n\nThe products designated by the terms 'chains, ropes and webbing' are chains, ropes and webbing designed and constructed for incorporation into lifting machinery or lifting accessories for lifting purposes – see §328: comments on section 4.1.1 (a) of Annex I. Chains, ropes or webbing designed for purposes other than lifting are not subject to the Machinery Directive as such. However, chains, ropes or webbing that are designed, constructed and specified by the manufacturer for dual or multiple purposes including lifting purposes are subject to the Directive.\n\nSince chains, ropes and webbing for lifting purposes are among the products designated by the term ‘machinery’ used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2 - manufacturers of chains ropes and webbing for lifting purposes must fulfil all of the obligations set out in Article 5 (1) – see §103: comments on Article 5 (1).\n\nIt should be noted that the products designated by the terms 'chains, ropes and webbing' are the products placed on the market by the chain, rope or webbing manufacturer in the form of bulk reels, drums, rolls, coils or bundles of chain, rope or webbing. They may be supplied by the chain, rope or webbing manufacturer to distributors, to manufacturers of lifting machinery or lifting accessories, or to users.\n\nThe obligations set out in Article 5 (1) apply when the chains, ropes or webbing are first placed on the market. The distributor or user does not become a manufacturer in the sense of the Directive by cutting individual lengths for incorporation into lifting machinery or lifting accessories. Therefore, the obligations set out in Article 5 (1) do not apply again to lengths of chain, rope or webbing cut from the products already placed on the market by the chain, rope or webbing manufacturer. Such lengths are to be considered as components of the lifting machinery or the lifting accessories into which they are incorporated.\n\nHowever, distributors of chains, ropes and webbing must ensure that the relevant EC Declaration of Conformity, the reference of the certificate setting out the characteristics of the chain, rope or webbing and the manufacturer's instructions are supplied with the cut length of chain, rope or webbing to manufacturers of lifting machinery or lifting accessories or to users – see §83: comments on Article 2 (i), and §357: comments on section 4.3.1 of Annex I.\n\n§45 Removable mechanical transmission devices\n\nRemovable mechanical transmission devices referred to in Article 1 (1) (f) are defined in Article 2 (f). It should be noted that removable mechanical transmission devices are also designated by the term 'machinery' used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2.\n\nRemovable mechanical transmission devices are subject to specific essential health and safety requirements in Part 3 of Annex I – see §319: comments on section 3.4.7 of Annex I.\n\nIt should be noted that guards for removable mechanical transmission devices are included as item 1 in the indicative list of safety components set out in Annex V. When they are placed on the market independently, such guards are therefore subject to the Machinery Directive as safety components. However, according to the second sentence of the above definition, when a removable mechanical transmission device is placed on the market together with its guard, it is subject to the Machinery Directive as a single\n\nproduct.\n\nWith respect to the conformity assessment procedure, it should also be noted that removable mechanical transmission devices including their guards are listed in Annex IV, item 14, and guards for removable mechanical transmission devices are listed in Annex IV, item 15.\n\n§46 Partly completed machinery\n\nPartly completed machinery (PCM) referred to in Article 1 (g) is defined in Article 2 (g). It should be noted that partly completed machinery is not among the products designated by the term 'machinery' used in the broad sense – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2. Partly completed machinery cannot be considered as interchangeable equipment.\n\nThe placing on the market of partly completed machinery is subject to a specific procedure – see §104: comments on Article 5 (2), §131: comments on Article 13, §384 and §385: comments on Annex II 1 B, and comments on Annexes VI and VII.\n\nPartly completed machinery subject to the Machinery Directive is a product intended to form machinery that is in the scope of the Machinery Directive after incorporation.\n\n'An assembly which is almost machinery' means that partly completed machinery is a product that is similar to machinery in the strict sense referred in Article 1 (1) (a), that is to say, an assembly consisting of linked parts or components at least one of which moves, but which lacks some elements necessary to perform its specific application. Partly completed machinery must thus undergo further construction in order to become final machinery that can perform its specific application. As an example, industrial robots are usually designed without a specific application until incorporated into the final machinery – see Article 2(g) of the Machinery Directive. The manufacturer of the final machinery takes the necessary measures so that the robot can perform its specific application safely within the assembly. In practice, only an industrial “stand and function alone-robot” provided with both an end-effector and control system so that it can itself perform a specific application, is a complete machinery under the Machinery Directive.\n\nThis further construction is not the fitting of a drive system to machinery supplied without a drive system where the drive system to be fitted is covered by the manufacturer's conformity assessment – see §35: comments on the first indent of Article 2 (a) – or the connection on site or with sources of energy or motion – see §36: comments on the second indent of Article 2 (a). Partly completed machinery should also be distinguished from machinery ready to be installed on a means of transport or in a building or a structure – see §37: comments on the third indent of Article 2 (a).\n\nMachinery that meets the definition in the first three indents of Article 2(a) so it can in itself operate independently, performing its specific application – see §35: comments on the first indent of Article 2 (a) – but which only lacks the necessary protective means or safety components, such as guards, is not to be considered as partly completed machinery. Such incomplete machinery does not meet the requirements of the Machinery Directive and must not be CE marked and cannot be placed on the EU/EEA market – see §103: comments on Article 5 (1).\n\nMachinery constructed in situ is not to be considered a PCM because on arrival at site it comprises a number of parts which may not be compliant (unless one or more of those parts meet the definition of a PCM, which includes being specifically intended for incorporation). It is still a machinery to which Machinery Directive applies so it must undergo conformity assessment and CE marking before it is first put into service.\n\nSometimes complete machinery missing some parts is confused with a PCM. If the missing parts are not constitutional parts of the machinery (e.g. a motor as a source of energy) and do not give rise to substantial impact on the safety of that machinery (so must be considered as part of conformity assessment) and the machinery manufacturer’s instructions provide clear information for the installation of the missing parts such that the safety and compliance of the final machinery is guaranteed with the\n\nMachinery Directive, then the completion of the machinery can be made later according to those instructions, prior to being put into service for the first time, according to Art 2(a) second indent.\n\nSince partly completed machinery is 'almost machinery', it is to be distinguished from machinery components that are not subject to the Machinery Directive as such – see §35: comments on the first indent of Article 2 (a). Machinery components can usually be integrated into a wide range of categories of machinery with different applications.\n\nThe second sentence of the definition of partly completed machinery states:\n\n. . . A drive system is partly completed machinery.\n\nThis provision also applies to drive systems ready to be fitted to machinery and not to the individual components of such systems.\n\nFor example, an internal combustion engine or a high voltage electric motor placed on the market ready to be fitted, i.e. with the connections necessary for the fitting, to machinery that is subject to the Machinery Directive are to be considered as partly completed machinery. Electric motors that are marketed for a wide variety of uses and hence not specifically designed or equipped for fitting to a particular type of machinery are not partly completed machinery.\n\nIt should be noted that most low voltage (50 - 1000 volts a.c. or between 75 and 1500 volts d.c.) electric motors are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive and are subject to the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU, unless they are subject to ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU – see §69: comments on Article 1 (2) (k) –, or form part of the drive system discussed above as PCM. It should also be noted that low voltage electric motors for ATEX application are excluded from the LVD. Consequently such motors fall under the scope of the Machinery Directive – see §69: comments on Article 1 (2) (k).\n\nMachinery Directive does not prescribe requirements for PCM manufacturers to meet the EHSRs of Annex I. All EHSRs met by the PCM must be declared on the accompanying Declaration of Incorporation – see §385: comments on Annex II 1 B. PCMs must be accompanied by assembly instructions which should include the essential information to enable safe incorporation, including, where relevant, for the final machine's control system, the relevant data on safety performance/reliability.\n\nManufacturers of final machinery are advised to check the Declaration of Incorporation, technical specifications and the assembly instructions prior to purchasing, to satisfy themselves that the PCM is suitable for integration into the final machinery.\n\nThe Machinery Directive does not apply as such to separate machinery components or subassemblies such as, for example seals, ball-bearings, pulleys, elastic couplings, solenoid valves, hydraulic cylinders, and the like, that do not have a specific application and that are intended to be incorporated into machinery; unless they fulfil one of the other definitions of products, e.g. a safety component, that are in the scope of the Machinery Directive by virtue of Art 2 (b) to (f), or are partly completed machinery as defined by Art. 2(g). The complete machinery incorporating such components must comply with the relevant essential health and safety requirements. The machinery manufacturer must therefore choose components with adequate specifications and characteristics. Component manufacturers may provide customers with relevant technical documentation to allow such subassemblies and components, to be installed correctly and safely. As these items are not in the scope of the Machinery Directive, the component manufacturers are not required to provide any declarations of conformity or to produce a technical file according to Annex VII or assembly instructions to Annex VI.\n\n§47 Products excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive\n\nThe scope of the Machinery Directive set out in Article 1 (1) is limited in two ways:\n\nCertain products corresponding to the definitions set out in Articles 2 (a) to (g) are explicitly excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive. The list of explicitly excluded products is set out in Article 1 (2), (a) to (l).\n\nAccording to Article 3 – Specific Directives, the Machinery Directive does not apply to products listed in Article 1 (1) for the risks covered more specifically by other EU legislation. When these specific Directives cover all the risks associated with the products concerned, such products are entirely excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive. When the specific Directives only cover certain of the risks associated with the products concerned, as for example ignition sources (according to the ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU), such products remain in the scope of the Machinery Directive for the other risks – see §89 to §91: comments on\n\nArticle 3.\n\n§48 Safety components intended to be used as spare parts to replace identical components and supplied by the manufacturer of the original machinery\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (a) concerns only components identical to components manufactured by the machinery manufacturer and fitted to their own machinery. Such components are not subject to the Machinery Directive as such because they are not placed on the market independently – see §42: comments on\n\nArticle 2 (c).\n\nWhen such a machinery manufacturer supplies identical components as spare parts to replace the original components, those spare parts do not thereby become subject to the Machinery Directive. It is important not to take the term “identical” too far, it should be taken to refer to the identical parameters of the unit. This means the exemption also applies in cases where the exact same components are no longer available and the machinery manufacturer supplies spare parts with the identical safety function and with the identical safety performance as the components that were originally fitted to the machinery.\n\n§49 Equipment for use in fairgrounds and/or amusement parks\n\nEquipment designed and constructed specifically for use in fairground or amusement parks is excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive by Article 1 (2) (b). The design and construction of such equipment is not subject to any EU legislation and may therefore be subject to national regulations. It can be noted that there are two European standards for such equipment[4].\n\nUse of such equipment by workers (for example, during erection, dismantling or maintenance operations) is subject to national provisions implementing Directive 2009/104/EC on use of work equipment by workers at work – see §140: comments on\n\nArticle 15.\n\n§50 Machinery for nuclear purposes\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (c) concerns machinery specially designed for the purposes of the nuclear power industry or for the production or processing of radioactive materials, the failure of which may result in an emission of radioactivity.\n\nMachinery used in the nuclear power industry, such as fork lift trucks, cranes and generators, which do not give rise to a risk of emission of radioactivity and/or failure of which do not directly generate radioactive emission, are not excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive.\n\nThe machinery concerned by the exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (c) is also to be distinguished from machinery incorporating radioactive sources, for example, for the purposes of measurement, non-destructive testing or preventing the accumulation of static electric charge. As they are not designed or used for nuclear purposes and thus are not excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive – see §232: comments on section 1.5.10 of Annex I.\n\nIt should be noted that the use of radioactive sources may be subject to authorisation and control according to the national provisions implementing Directive 96/29/Euratom and Directive 2003/122/Euratom[5].\n\n§51 Weapons, including firearms\n\nAs explained in Recital 6, the exclusion of weapons, including firearms, set out in Article 1 (2) (d), is to be understood in light of the scope of the EU legislation on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons set out in Annex I to Council Directive 91/477/EEC18. Section III (b) of that Annex excludes devices designed for industrial or technical purposes provided that they can be used for the stated purpose only.\n\nConsequently, the exclusion of weapons, including firearms, from the scope of the Machinery Directive does not extend to cartridge-operated fixing and other cartridgeoperated impact machinery designed for industrial or technical purposes – see §9: comments on Recital 6.\n\n§52 Means of transport\n\nThe exclusions relating to various means of transport are set out in the five indents of Article 1 (2) (e). In the following comments, these indents are examined in turn.\n\n§53 Agricultural and forestry tractors\n\nThe exclusion set out in the first indent of Article 1 (2) (e) concerns agricultural and forestry tractors covered by Regulation 167/2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles (Tractors) which replaced Directive 2003/37/EC on 1st January 2016. The amendment brought to Article 1(2)(e) of the Machinery Directive, is removing the reference to the exclusion being only for the risks covered by that Directive. Such tractors supplied under Regulation 167/2013 as of 1 January 2016 are completely excluded from the Machinery Directive. However, there is a two-year transition period where tractors supplied under national legislation implementing Directive 2003/37/EC can still be supplied up to 31st December 2017, and are thus also in scope of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC.\n\nOJ L 256, 13.9.1991, p. 51.\n\nArticle 1(2)(e) was amended by Regulation (EU) 167/2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles.\n\nThis change was made because at the time the new Machinery Directive was adopted; the Tractors Directive did not deal with all the risks associated with the use of tractors. The new Regulation 167/2013 was drafted to cover all risks including those previously covered by the Machinery Directive, and so a complete exclusion could be made. This change was anticipated when the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC was adopted, the following joint declaration was made by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission:\n\nThe Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, in order to cover all aspects related to the health and safety of agricultural and forestry tractors in one harmonising Directive, the Directive 2003/37/EC on type-approval of agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units needs to be modified so as to address all the relevant risks of the Machinery Directive.\n\nSuch a modification of Directive 2003/37/EC should include an amendment of the Machinery Directive, in order to delete the expression “for the risks” in Article 1 (2) (e), first indent.\n\nThe Commission recognises the need to include in the agricultural and forestry tractors directives further requirements for risks not yet covered by these directives. To this end, the Commission is considering appropriate measures that include references to United Nations regulations, CEN and ISO standards and OECD codes.\n\nIt is important to note that the exclusion relating to agricultural and forestry tractors applies only to the tractors themselves and not to their trailers, to towed or pushed machinery or to mounted or semi-mounted machinery on the tractor.\n\nExamples of mounted and semi-mounted machinery that are in scope of the Machinery Directive are: telescopic booms; digging equipment; post drivers; cutting devices mounted under tractors and equipment for vegetation maintenance. Where the tractor is designed with such items fitted in the production process, whether an integral part of the tractor or not, they are still considered as being “mounted” and so are in scope of the Machinery Directive. Where the “vehicle” is primarily designed for a task such that it does not meet the definition of an agricultural vehicle in Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, such as some models of telescopic material handler, then it is considered a product under the Machinery Directive.\n\nTrailers and interchangeable towed machinery are in the scope of both Tractors Regulation 167/2013 and the Machinery Directive.\n\nThe requirements for the safe road circulation of such trailers and towed machinery are harmonised by Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 while the health and safety requirements of such machinery remain subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\n§54 Four-or-more-wheeled road vehicles and their trailers\n\nThe exclusion set out in the second indent of Article 1 (2) (e) concerns motor vehicles and their trailers. When Directive 2006/42/EC was adopted, the type-approval of such vehicles was covered by Council Directive 70/156/EEC. As from 29 April 2009, Directive 70/156/EEC is replaced by Directive 2007/46/EC[6] This Directive applies to powerdriven vehicles having at least four wheels, with a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, designed and constructed in one or more stages for use on the road, and of systems, components and separate technical units designed and constructed for such vehicles, as well as non-self-propelled vehicles on wheels designed and constructed to the towed by a motor vehicle.\n\nArticle 2 (3) of Directive 2007/46/EC foresees the possibility of optional type-approval or individual approval for mobile machinery, while stating that such optional approvals shall be without prejudice to the application of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. Consequently, any mobile machinery subject to type-approval or individual approval for circulation on the road remains subject to the Machinery Directive for all risks other than those linked to road circulation.\n\nVehicles not intended for use on the road such as, for example, off-road quads, ATVs, go-karts, golf-carts buggies and snowmobiles, are subject to the Machinery Directive, unless they are exclusively intended for competition – see §56: comments on Article 1 (2) (e) – fourth indent.\n\nThe same is true of vehicles with a maximum design speed not exceeding 25 km/h such as, for example, certain compact road sweepers.\n\nMachinery mounted on road vehicles or trailers such as, for example, loader cranes, taillifts, vehicle or trailer-mounted compressors, vehicle-mounted compaction systems, vehicle mounted concrete mixers, skip loaders, powered winches, tipper bodies and vehicle or trailer-mounted mobile elevating work platforms, are subject to the Machinery Directive – see §37: comments on Article 2 (a) – third indent.\n\n§55 Two- and three-wheeled road vehicles\n\nThe exclusion set out in the third indent of Article 1 (2) (e) concerns vehicles covered by Directive 2002/24/EC[7] which applies to two or three-wheel motor vehicles, whether twin-wheeled or otherwise, intended to travel on the road.\n\nThe exclusion does not apply to vehicles not intended for use on the road such as, for example, off-road motorcycles, which are thus subject to the Machinery Directive unless they are exclusively intended for competition – see §56: comments on Article 1 (2) (e) – fourth indent.\n\nThe exclusion does not apply to vehicles with a maximum design speed of less than 6 km/h, pedestrian controlled vehicles, vehicles intended for use by the physically handicapped, off-road vehicles, or electrically power assisted cycles (EPACs or pedelecs) that are outside the scope of Directive 2002/24/EC. These categories of two or three-wheel motor vehicles are therefore subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\nHoverboards or self-balancing scooters, which commonly have a single or pair of wheels on either side, are also subject to the Machinery Directive unless explicitly covered by the Toys Directive 2009/48/EC[8].\n\n§56 Motor vehicles intended for competition\n\nThe exclusion set out in the fourth indent of Article 1 (2) (e) concerns motor vehicles intended for competition. Such vehicles are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive whether they are intended for road use or for off-road use.\n\nThe exclusion concerns vehicles exclusively intended for competition, thus, for example, vehicles intended for leisure use that may also be used for informal competitions are not excluded. The main criterion to be applied to judge whether vehicles are to be considered as exclusively intended for competition is whether they are designed according to the technical specifications laid down by one of the officially recognised racing associations.\n\nFor competition motorcycles, competition quads or All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) and competition snowmobiles, the technical specifications are laid down by the FIM (Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme) and its national affiliated federations. To assist market surveillance authorities to distinguish competition models from others, the FIM publishes on its Website the list of competition motorcycles, quads and snowmobiles that comply with its technical specifications and that participate in national or international motor sports competitions organized under the auspices of the international federation and its national affiliates.\n\n§57 Means of transport by air, on water and on rail networks\n\nAccording to the exclusion set out in the fifth indent of Article 1 (2) (e), the Machinery Directive does not cover any kind of aircraft or means of water-borne transport. This exclusion applies as well to hovercrafts[9].\n\nCraft subject to the Recreational Craft Directive 94/25/EC as amended by Directive 2003/44/EC are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive. The Machinery Directive does not therefore apply to inboard and stern-drive engines that are considered as part of the craft.\n\nConcerning \"unmanned aerial vehicles\" or \"drones\", they can be considered as covered by the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC as long as they are not treated as \"means of transport\", so not in the specific exclusion for aircrafts stated in the Directive (e.g. specially designed and constructed for military or police purposes or designed and constructed for transporting loads, as well as drones covered by the Directive 2009/48/EC for toys). In addition, other EU legislation can apply to drones according to the specific characteristics of the product, such as the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive 2014/30/EU or the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) 2014/53/EC.\n\nHowever, the Machinery Directive is applicable to outboard engines, with the exception of the requirements that are specifically included in the Recreational Craft Directive\n\n2013/53/EU relating to the owner’s manual, the handling characteristics of the craft, the starting of outboard engines and exhaust and noise emissions.\n\nMachinery mounted on water-borne vessels, such as, for example floating cranes, drills, excavators and dredgers, are not excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive. It should be noted that lifting appliances fitted on a means of transport are subject to the Machinery Directive – see §151: comments on Article 24.\n\nThe exclusion of means of transport on rail networks concerns machinery intended for the transport of persons and/or goods on international, national, regional, suburban or urban rail networks or on rail systems connected to such networks. Railway turnouts (also known as points or switches) are not covered by the Machinery Directive[10] and they are subject to Directive 2008/57/EC[11] on the interoperability of the rail system.\n\nOn the other hand, machinery intended for use on rail systems not connected to such networks such as, for example, self-propelled machinery running on rails for underground work, are in the scope of the Machinery Directive.\n\nMachinery intended for use on rail networks that is not intended for the transport of persons and/or goods such as, for example, railbound machinery for the construction, maintenance and inspection of the rail track and structures, is also in the scope of the Machinery Directive. The same goes for machinery mounted on railbound vehicles, such as, for example, loader cranes and mobile elevating work platforms.\n\n§58 Seagoing vessels and mobile offshore units and machinery installed on board such vessels and/or units\n\nSeagoing vessels and mobile offshore units such as, for example, mobile drilling rigs, and machinery installed on them are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive by Article 1 (2) (f) since they are subject to the Conventions of the International Maritime Organisation.\n\nSome of the equipment concerned by this exclusion may also be subject to the Marine Equipment Directive 96/98/EC[12] as amended by Directive 2002/75/EC[13].\n\nA mobile offshore unit is an offshore unit that is not intended to be located on the oil field permanently or for the long term, but is designed to be moved from location to location, whether or not it has a means of propulsion or of lowering legs to the seafloor. There are three main types of offshore units for drilling: jack-up; semi-submersible and drill-ship.\n\nHowever, permanently placed floating units intended for production, such as, for example, FPSOs (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading installations – usually based on tanker designs) and FPPs (Floating Production Platforms – based on semisubmersible vessels) and the machinery installed on such units are not excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive.\n\nMachinery on permanently placed offshore platforms such as, for example, oil production rigs, and machinery which is designed to be used on both fixed and mobile offshore units is also subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\n§59 Machinery for military or police purposes\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (g) applies to machinery specially designed and constructed for defence purposes or for the purpose of maintaining order. Ordinary machinery used by the armed forces or by the police but which is not specially designed for defence purposes or for the purpose of maintaining order is subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\nIn some countries, certain fire services belong to the military, however machinery designed for use by such fire-fighters is not thereby considered to be designed and constructed for military purposes and is thus subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\n§60 Machinery for research purposes\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (h) was introduced since it was not considered reasonable to submit to the requirements of the Machinery Directive laboratory equipment specially designed and constructed for the needs of particular research projects. Consequently, the exclusion does not apply to machinery permanently installed in laboratories that may be used for general research purposes or to machinery installed in laboratories for purposes other than research such as, for example, for testing purposes.\n\nThe exclusion only applies to equipment designed and constructed for temporary research use, that is to say, equipment that will cease to be used when the research projects for which it was designed and constructed have been completed.\n\n§61 Mine winding gear\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (i) concerns lifts equipping mine shafts. Mine winding gear is also excluded from the scope of the Lifts Directive 95/16/EC. It was considered that such lifts were specific installations the characteristics of which varied according to the site and which gave rise to few obstacles to trade. Mine winding gear thus remains subject to national regulations.\n\nIt should be noted that this exclusion concerns installations in the mine shaft. Lifts installed in other parts of a mine are not concerned by the exclusion and thus may be subject to either the Lifts Directive or the Machinery Directive, as the case may be – see §90: comments on Article 3, and §151: comments on Article 24.\n\n§62 Machinery intended to move performers during artistic performances\n\nThe exclusion set out in Article 1 (2) (j) concerns machinery intended to be used to move performers in the course of the artistic performance. Such equipment is excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive and the Lifts Directive 2014/33/EC (replacing Directive 95/16/EC from 20 April 2016), since application of the requirements of these Directives could be incompatible with the artistic function of the equipment concerned – see §151: comments on Article 24.\n\nThe exclusion does not apply to machinery intended only to move objects such as, for example, scenery or lighting, or to machinery intended to move persons other than the performers such as, for example, technicians.\n\nIt should also be noted that the exclusion does not concern other equipment, such as escalators or lifts, designed for moving persons in theatres or other entertainment premises for purposes not directly linked to the execution of the artistic performance. Such equipment is subject to either the Lifts Directive or the Machinery Directive, as the case may be – see §90: comments on Article 3, and §151: comments on Article 24.\n\n§63 Machinery covered by the Low Voltage Directive\n\nOne of the objectives of the revision of the Machinery Directive was to clarify the borderline between the scope of the Machinery Directive and the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU[14] (replacing Directive 2006/95/EC from 20 April 2016) in order to provide greater legal certainty.\n\nArticle 1 (2) (k) lists the categories of low voltage electrical and electronic machinery that are excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive.\n\nElectrical machinery that is not in any of the categories listed in Article 1 (2) (k) (and that is not concerned by one of the other exclusions) is in the scope of the Machinery Directive. When such machinery has an electrical supply within the voltage limits of the Low Voltage Directive (between 50 and 1000 V for alternating current or between 75 and 1500 V for direct current), it must fulfil the safety objectives of the Low Voltage Directive – see §222: comments on section 1.5.1 of Annex I. However, in that case, the manufacturer’s EC Declaration of Conformity should not refer to the Low Voltage Directive.\n\nOn the other hand, low voltage electrical equipment placed on the market independently for incorporation into machinery is subject to the Low Voltage Directive as such[15].\n\n§64 Household appliances intended for domestic use\n\nConcerning the exclusion mentioned in the first indent of Article 1 (2) (k), several clarifications are necessary:\n\nthe expression ‘household appliances’ designates equipment intended for housekeeping functions such as washing, cleaning, heating, cooling, cooking, etc. Examples of household appliances include washing machines, dish washers, vacuum cleaners and machinery for food preparation and cooking, and machinery for domestic personal care, such as hair dryers, shavers, etc. On the other hand, electrical gardening machinery or electrical power tools intended for construction and repair work in the home are not concerned by this exclusion and are subject to the Machinery Directive;\n\nthe exclusion concerns appliances ‘intended for domestic use’, in other words, appliances intended for use by private persons (consumers) in the home environment. Thus appliances for the housekeeping functions mentioned above\n\nthat are intended for commercial or industrial use are not excluded from the scope of the Machinery Directive;\n\nelectrically operated furniture, such as beds, chairs, tables, storage furniture including kitchen furniture, remain subject to the Machinery Directive as they are not household appliances of the types indicated above. However, where provided for medical purposes such that they are within scope of the Directive 93/42/EEC (as amended)[16] concerning medical devices, that Directive applies instead of the Machinery Directive.\n\nWhile it is possible for a consumer to acquire an appliance intended for commercial use or for a commerce to acquire an appliance intended for domestic use, the criterion to be taken into account for determining the intended use is the use intended and stated by the manufacturer of the appliance in his product information or his Declaration of Conformity. Evidently, this statement must accurately reflect the foreseeable use of the product.\n\n§65 Audio and video equipment\n\nThe exclusion mentioned in the second indent of Article 1 (2) (k) concerns equipment such as, for example, radio and television receivers, tape and video players and recorders, CD and DVD players and recorders, amplifiers and loud speakers, cameras and projectors.\n\n§66 Information technology equipment\n\nThe exclusion mentioned in the third indent of Article 1 (2) (k) concerns equipment used for the processing, conversion, transmission, storage, protection and retrieval of data or information. The equipment concerned includes, for example, computer hardware, communication network equipment and telephone and telecommunication equipment.\n\nThe exclusion does not extend to electronic equipment incorporated into machinery such as, for example, programmable electronic control systems, which is considered as an integral part of the machinery subject to the Machinery Directive and must enable the machinery to fulfil the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to the Directive. Certain devices incorporating information technology equipment may also be subject to the Machinery Directive as safety components.\n\n§67 Ordinary office machinery\n\nThe exclusion set out in the fourth indent of Article 1 (2) (k) applies to electrical equipment such as, for example, printers, copiers, fax machines, sorters, binders and staplers.\n\nThis exclusion does not concern machinery with similar functions intended for use in industries such as, for example, the printing or paper industries.\n\nThe exclusion of ordinary office machinery does not extend to electrically powered office furniture which is subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\n§68 Low-voltage switchgear and control gear\n\nLow voltage switchgear and control gear referred to in the fifth indent of Article 1 (2) (k) are devices for making and breaking the current in electrical circuits and associated control, measuring and regulating equipment for the control of electrical energy using equipment.\n\nSuch equipment is not subject to the Machinery Directive as such. Where such equipment is incorporated into machinery, it must enable the machinery to fulfil the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to the Machinery Directive.\n\nIt should also be noted that this exclusion does not apply to low voltage electrical safety components – see §42: comments on Article 2 (c).\n\n§69 Electric motors\n\nThe exclusion set out in the sixth indent of Article 1 (2) (k) implies that electric motors that are in the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU (that is to say, electric motors with an electricity supply within the voltage limits and that are not listed in Annex II of that Directive) are subject to the Low Voltage Directive only.\n\nAn electric motor is a device for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. The exclusion applies to the motor itself without a specific application and without additional mechanical elements of a drive system.\n\nThe exclusion also applies to low voltage electric motor-generators which are similar devices for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. On the other hand, generator sets, comprising a source of mechanical energy such as, for example, an internal combustion engine, and an electric generator, are subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\nThe exclusion does not apply to electric motors that are intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres and that are subject to the ATEX-Directive 2014/34/EU, because such motors are excluded from the Low Voltage Directive. Electric motors that are intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres are therefore subject to the Machinery Directive.\n\n§70 High-voltage electrical equipment\n\nThe high-voltage electrical equipment excluded by Article 1 (2) (l) comprises switch gear and control gear and transformers forming part of or connected to a high-voltage electricity supply (above 1000 V for alternating current or above 1500 V for direct current).\n\nThis high-voltage electrical equipment is not subject to the Machinery Directive as such. Where such equipment is incorporated into machinery, it must enable the machinery to fulfil the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to the Machinery Directive – see §222: comments on section 1.5.1 of Annex I.\n\n§71 The definition of ‘placing on the market’\n\nThe term 'machinery' in the definition of ‘placing on the market’ is used in the broad sense, that is to say, the definition applies to the placing on the market of any of the products listed in Article 1, (a) to (f) and defined in Article 2 (a) to (f) – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2 – as well as to partly completed machinery.\n\nThe Machinery Directive applies to machinery or partly completed machinery placed on the EU market. It does not apply to products manufactured in the EU with a view to being placed on the market or put into service in countries outside the EU, although certain of these countries may have national regulations based on the Machinery Directive or accept machinery on their market that complies with the Directive.\n\n§72 New and used machinery\n\nMachinery is considered as placed on the market when it is made available in the EU for the first time. The Machinery Directive therefore applies to all new machinery placed on the market or put into service in the EU, whether such machinery is manufactured in the EU or outside the EU.\n\nIn general, the Machinery Directive does not apply to the placing on the market of used or second-hand machinery. In some Member States, the placing on the market of used or second-hand machinery is subject to specific national regulations. Otherwise the putting into service and use of second-hand machinery for professional use is subject to the national regulations on the use of work equipment implementing the provisions of Directive 2009/104/EC – see §140: comments on Article 15.\n\nThere is one exception to this general rule. The Machinery Directive applies to used or second-hand machinery that was first made available with a view to distribution or use outside the EU when it is subsequently placed on the market or put into service for the first time in the EU[17]. The person responsible for placing on the market or putting into service such used machinery for the first time in the EU, whether he is the manufacturer of the machinery, an importer, a distributor or the user himself, must fulfil all the obligations set out in Article 5 of the Directive.\n\nThe question arises as to when a transformation of machinery is considered as construction of new machinery subject to the Machinery Directive. It is not possible to give precise criteria for answering this question in each particular case. In doubt, it is therefore advisable for the person placing such rebuilt machinery on the market or putting it into service to consult the relevant national authorities.\n\n§73 The stage at which the Machinery Directive applies to machinery\n\nThe definition of ‘placing on the market’, together with the definition of ‘putting into service’ given in Article 2 (k), determines the stage at which machinery must comply with the relevant provisions of the Directive. The manufacturer or his authorised representative must have fulfilled all their obligations relating to the conformity of machinery when it is placed on the market or put into service – see §103: comments on Article 5.\n\nPlacing on the market refers to each individual item of machinery or partly completed and not to a model or type. The relevant provisions of Directive 2006/42/EC therefore apply to all items of machinery or partly completed machinery placed on the market as from 29th December 2009 – see §153: comments on Article 26.\n\nThe Machinery Directive does not apply to machinery before it is placed on the market or put into service. In particular, machinery transferred by the manufacturer to his authorised representative in the EU in order to fulfil all or part of the obligations set out in Article 5 is not considered to be placed on the market until it is made available with a view to distribution or use – see §84 and §85: comments on Article 2 (j). The same goes for machinery still under construction, transferred by a manufacturer from manufacturing facilities outside the EU with a view to its completion in manufacturing facilities in the EU.\n\nThe manufacturer may need to operate or test the machinery or parts of it during construction, assembly, installation or adjustment before it is placed on the market or put into service. In that case, he must take the necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of operators and other exposed persons when carrying out such operations, in accordance with the national regulations on health and safety at work and on the use of work equipment implementing the provisions of Directives 89/391/EEC and 2009/104/EC – see §140: comments on Article 15. However, the machinery concerned is not required to comply with the provisions of the Machinery Directive until it is placed on the market or put into service.\n\nParticular rules apply to machinery exhibited at trade fairs, exhibitions and demonstrations – see §108: comments on Article 6 (3).\n\n§74 The legal and contractual forms of placing on the market\n\nPlacing on the market is defined as making machinery available with a view to distribution or use. Making machinery available implies that the machinery will be transferred from the manufacturer to another person such as a distributor or a user. However, it could be that the distribution operation is part of the manufacturer's own business, in which case it is when the item moves from the production area/factory to the distribution warehouse ready to be supplied. There is no restriction as to the legal or contractual form of this transfer.\n\nIn many cases, but not exclusively, placing on the market involves a transfer of the ownership of the machinery from the manufacturer to the distributor or user in exchange for payment (for example, sale or hire-purchase). In other cases, placing on the market may take other contractual forms (such as, for example, lease or rental). In such cases, the right to use the machinery is granted in exchange for payment, without transfer of ownership. The Machinery Directive applies to such machinery when it is first subject to a lease or rental contract in the EU. The Machinery Directive does not apply when used machinery that was first placed on the market according to the Machinery Directive is subject to subsequent lease or rental contracts in the EU. Rental or lease of used machinery may be subject to national regulations – see §140: comments on Article 15.\n\nPlacing on the market includes any offer for distribution, consumption or use on the EU market which could result in actual supply (e.g. an invitation to purchase, advertising campaigns) and this includes the general offer to supply into the EU on the internet. Therefore, if a machine is offered or advertised for supply (and hence use) on the internet into the EU it is considered as being placed on the market in the same way as a machine may be advertised for supply in a newspaper or magazine, and so the machinery must comply with the Machinery Directive.\n\nMachinery is also considered to be placed on the market if it is made available with a\n\nview to distribution or use free of charge (for example, as a gift or a loan).\n\nPlacing on the market is considered not to take place where a machine is introduced from a third country in the EU customs territory and has not been released for free circulation. This includes the cases of products in transit, placed in free zones, warehouses or temporary storage[18].\n\n§75 Auctions\n\nAuctions held in free zones\n\nOne of the ways in which machinery is placed on the market is through auctions. Such auctions may be held in a free zone[19]. The main purpose of holding auctions in a free zone is to sell new and used machinery from outside the EU for use in countries outside the EU. Machinery sold for that purpose is not considered to be placed on the market in the EU.\n\nOn the other hand, the machinery offered for sale at such an auction is considered to be placed on the market or put into service in the EU if and when it leaves the free zone in order to be distributed or used in the EU. If the machinery concerned is new or is used machinery that is placed on the market or put into service in the EU market for the first time, and if the manufacturer of the machinery concerned or his authorised representative has not fulfilled his obligations according to the Machinery Directive, the person who purchases the machinery at the auction and brings it from the free zone into the EU with a view to its distribution or use is to be considered as the person placing the machinery on the market or putting it into service in the EU and must fulfil all the obligations set out in Article 5.\n\nAuctions held outside free zones\n\nIf an auction is held in the EU outside a free zone, it can be assumed that the machinery is being offered for sale with a view to its distribution or use in the EU and it is therefore to be considered as placed on the market in the EU.\n\nIf machinery offered for sale at an auction held in the EU outside a free zone is new, whether manufactured in or outside the EU, it must comply with the relevant provisions of the Machinery Directive. The same goes for used machinery offered for sale at such an auction if it is placed on the market in the EU for the first time – see §72: comments on Article 2 (h).\n\nIf the manufacturer of the machinery concerned or his authorised representative has not fulfilled his obligations according to the Machinery Directive, the person offering the machinery for sale at such an auction (the consignor) is to be considered as the person placing the machinery on the market in the EU and must therefore fulfil all the obligations of the manufacturer set out in Article 5. These obligations include ensuring that the machinery satisfies the relevant essential health and safety requirements, ensuring that the technical file is available, providing the instructions, carrying out the appropriate conformity assessment procedure, drawing up and signing the EC Declaration of Conformity of the machinery and affixing the CE-marking – see §81: comments on Article 2 (i).\n\nThe auctioneer who organises the sale by auction of such machinery offered for sale by consignors is be considered as a distributor and must therefore ensure that the machinery bears the CE marking, is accompanied by the EC Declaration of Conformity drawn up and signed by the manufacturer or his authorised representative and is accompanied by instructions – see §83: comments on Article 2 (i).\n\n§76 Placing on the market of assemblies of machinery\n\nAssemblies of machinery that are assembled in user’s premises by a person other than the user are considered to be placed on the market when the assembly operations have been completed and the assembly is handed over to the user for use – see §38: comments on Article 2 (a) – fourth indent, and §79: comments on Article 2 (i).\n\n§77 Placing on the market of partly completed machinery\n\nPartly completed machinery is considered to be placed on the market when it is made available to a manufacturer of complete machinery or of an assembly of machinery into which it is to be incorporated – see §46: comments on Article 2 (g).\n\n§78 The definition of ‘manufacturer’\n\nThe obligations created by the Machinery Directive relating to the conformity of machinery and partly completed machinery fall on the manufacturer or his authorised representative. These obligations are summarised in Article 5. The definition of ‘manufacturer’, together with the following definition of ‘authorised representative’, determine who shall fulfil these obligations. It is important to understand that the term manufacturer used here is not the same as used in general language, this is explained below in §79.\n\nThe term 'machinery' in the definition of ‘manufacturer’ is used in the broad sense, that is to say, the definition applies to the manufacturer of any of the products listed in Article 1, (a) to (f) and defined in Article 2 (a) to (f) – see §33: comments on the first paragraph of Article 2. The definition also applies to the manufacturer of partly completed machinery.\n\n§79 Who is the manufacturer?\n\nA manufacturer can be a natural or legal person, that is to say, an individual or a legal entity such as a company or association. The process of design and construction of machinery or partly completed machinery may involve several individuals or companies, but in this case one of them must take the responsibility, as the manufacturer, for the conformity of the machinery or partly completed machinery with the Directive. However, the term manufacturer in this Directive also can apply to other persons who have the responsibilities for conformity assessment and CE marking – see §81: comments on\n\nArticle 2 (i).\n\nSince the essential health and safety requirements of the Directive mainly concern the design and construction of machinery, the person who is in the best position to fulfil these requirements is clearly the person who actually designs and constructs the machinery, or who at least controls the design and construction process. In some cases, the manufacturer may design and construct the machinery himself. In other cases, all or part of the design or the construction of the machinery may be carried out by other persons (suppliers or sub-contractors). However, the person who assumes the legal responsibility for the conformity of the machinery or the partly completed machinery with a view to its being placed on the market under his own name or trademark must ensure sufficient control over the work of his suppliers and sub-contractors and possess sufficient information to ensure that he is able to fulfil all his obligations under the Directive as set out in Article 5 – see §105: comments on Article 5 (3).\n\nA person constituting an assembly of machinery is considered as the manufacturer of the assembly – see §38: comments on Article 2 (a). Usually, the elements constituting an assembly of machinery are supplied by different manufacturers, however one person must assume the responsibility for the conformity of the assembly as a whole. This responsibility can be assumed by the manufacturer of one or more of the constituent units, by a contractor or by the user. If a user constitutes an assembly of machinery for his own use he is considered as the manufacturer of the assembly – see §80 below.\n\n§80 A person manufacturing machinery for his own use\n\nA person who manufactures machinery for his own use is considered as a manufacturer and must fulfil all the obligations set out in Article 5. In that case, the machinery is not placed on the market, since it is not made available by"
