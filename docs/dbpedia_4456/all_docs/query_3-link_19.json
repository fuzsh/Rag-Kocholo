        "text": "A case study on the assessment process based of the EN standards and the TSIs\n\n1 - Introduction\n\nThis article shows the relationships between EU directives and the European standards by means a case study related to the application of the foundation standards for the electronic equipment on board of rolling stock. The assessment process of this equipment deals with two main stages:\n\na) The assessment process of the CE declaration of the manufacturer of the equipment.\n\nb) The assessment process of the TSI’s requirement\n\nThe function/equipment used for this case study is the Energy Measurement System described by the EN 50463:2017 series.\n\nOnly some function/equipment require conformance to the TSIs but all electronic equipment requires conformance to the standards. This case study applied to the EMS can be seen from both points of view. This example can be applied to all electronic equipment installed on board also if not involving the TSIs.\n\nThe stage a) involves the foundation reference standards for the on board electronic equipment, the EN 50155:2017 and the EN 50657:2017.The requirements of the case study application are in the EN 50463 series describing the Energy Measurement System.\n\nThe stage b) is based on the application of the interoperability requirements of EU Directive 2008/57/EC amended by Commission Directive 2011/18/EU on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community and the related Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) to an electronic equipment for on-board application. The mandatory “interoperability requirements” are defined by the Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI).\n\n2 - Reference documents\n\nEU Directive 2008/57/EC on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community (Recast) (Text with EEA relevance), now being replaced by Directive (EU) 2016/797 (which is part of the 4th Railway Package)\n\nDirective (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (Text with EEA relevance)\n\n2014/897/EU: COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION of 5 December 2014 on matters related to the placing in service and use of structural subsystems and vehicles under Directives 2008/57/EC and 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (Text with EEA relevance)\n\nCommission Directive 2011/18/EU of 1 March 2011, amending Annexes II, V and VI to Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community Text with EEA relevance\n\nTSI “Locomotives and Passenger Rolling Stock” (REGULATION (EU) No 1302/2014 of 18 November 2014)\n\nTSI “Energy” (REGULATION (EU) No 1301/2014 of 18 November 2014).\n\nCorrigendum to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1301/2014 of 18 November 2014 on the technical specifications for interoperability relating to the ‘energy’ subsystem of the rail system in the Union\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/868 of 13 June 2018 amending Regulation (EU) No 1301/2014 and Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014 as regards provisions on energy measuring system and data collecting system (Text with EEA relevance.)\n\nEN 50155:2017 - Railway applications - Rolling stock - Electronic equipment\n\nEN 50657:2017 - Railways Applications - Rolling stock applications - Software on Board Rolling Stock\n\nEN 50463:2017 series - Railway applications - Energy measurement on board trains\n\n3 - Legal and technical framework\n\n3.1 Legal framework\n\nThe Directive 2008/57/EC, amended by Directive 2011/18/EU, now being replaced by Directive (EU) 2016/797, drives the railway regulatory framework. The minimum requirements to assure interoperability are stated in the TSI “Locomotives and Passenger Rolling Stock” (REGULATION (EU) No 1302/2014 of 18 November 2014) and in the TSI “Energy” (REGULATION (EU) No 1301/2014 of 18 November 2014).\n\nThe COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/868 of 13 June 2018 amends the TSIs 1301/2014 and 1302/2014 in order to close the open points and give the deadline of 4 July 2020 to implement the settlement system.\n\nThe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) also introduces a hierarchy of norms within the secondary legislation. It establishes a distinction between:\n\nlegislative acts (Article 289 TFEU). These are legal acts adopted by an ordinary or special legislative procedure;\n\ndelegated acts (Article 290 TFEU). These are non-legislative acts of general application which supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act. The power to adopt this type of act may be delegated to the Commission by the European Parliament or the Council;\n\nimplementing acts (Article 291 TFEU). These acts are generally adopted by the Commission, which is conferred with implementing powers; in certain cases the Council may also be called upon to adopt implementing acts.\n\nThe Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) are delegated and implementing acts and the application is mandatory. Figure 1 shows the hierarchy and level of detail of the specifications mentioned in recommendations 26 to 30 of the COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 2014/897/EU (see ref. 3)\n\nFigure 1 - Hierarchy and level of detail\n\nFigure 2 - Relationship between Directive and TSIs\n\nThe TSIs are based on \"minimum interoperability requirements\" of the requested functions. The minimum interoperability requirements listed in the TSIs address mainly a subset of the function requested for the equipment. In starting a TSI based assessment process, following the approach of the \"minimum interoperability requirements\", you have to figure out that you have to declare your own \"Rule Reference List\" (RRL). The RRL is the list of the standards and best practices you state to use in that project; such list will be used for the verification of the requirements and the performance. The content of your Rule Reference List can contains any of the items shown in figure 3, taking into account that you have to declare the version/edition you will use.\n\nFigure 3 - Standards hierarchy\n\nThe recent versions of the ENs contain in some cases the informative Annex ZA (CEN standards) or ZZ (CENELEC Standard). The annex indicates relationship between essential requirements (or safety objectives) of a Regulation/Directive aimed to be covered and the applicable clauses, there are as many Annexes ZA/ZZ as Regulations/Directives aimed to support. The standards containing these annexes are defined harmonised standards.\n\nA harmonised standard is a European standard developed by a recognised European Standards Organisation: CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI. It is created following a request from the European Commission to one of these organisations. Manufacturers, other economic operators, or conformity assessment bodies can use harmonised standards to demonstrate that products, services, or processes comply with relevant EU legislation. The references to harmonised standards must be published in the Official Journal of the European Union\n\nCompliance with the normative clauses of the standard given in Table ZA/ZZ confers within the limits of the scope of the standard a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of that Directive, and associated EFTA regulations. As the minimum requirements are derived from standards, so if you fulfil the requirements of that standard you can have an high degree of confidence in fulfilling the related clauses of the TSIs as well.\n\n3.2 - Overview of the Standards\n\nIn this case study, the edition 2017 of the standards EN 50155, EN 50657 and EN 50463 series are used.\n\n3.2.1 - EN 50155 edition 2017 - Railway applications - Rolling stock - Electronic equipment\n\nThe EN 50155 applies to the design, manufacturing, testing of any electronic equipment installed on board rolling stock. It also describes the electrical and environmental operating conditions including the requirements resulting from the specific location of the on board installation. This standard contains the design, the documentation and the testing requirements. This standard applies to all electronic equipment for control, regulation, protection, diagnostic, energy supply, etc. installed on rail vehicles. For the purpose of the EN 50155, electronic equipment is defined as equipment mainly composed of semiconductor devices and recognized associated components. Sensors (current, voltage, speed, etc.) and Semiconductor drive unit (SDU) for power electronic devices are covered by this standard. Complete Semiconductor drive unit (SDU) and power converters are covered by EN 61287-1.\n\nFigure 4 - Overview of the EN 50155 edition 2017\n\n3.2.2 - EN 50657 edition 2017 - Railways Applications - Rolling stock applications - Software on Board Rolling Stock\n\nThe EN 50657 specifies the process and technical requirements for the development of software for programmable electronic systems for use in rolling stock applications. Outside the scope of this standard is software that: - is part of signalling equipment (CENELEC sub-committee SC9XA applications) installed on board trains, or - does not contribute to, and is segregated from Rolling Stock operational functions.\n\nFigure 5 - Overview of the EN 50657 edition 2017\n\n3.2.3 - EN 50463 edition 2017 - Railway applications - Energy measurement on board trains\n\nThe EN 50463 describes the primary purpose of the EMS, which is to meter energy consumption for billing and provide compiled energy billing data CEBD to a Data Collecting Service DCS. The EMS may also be used for other functions such as energy management. In addition, this European Standard also describes the primary purpose of a DCS and its interactions with an EMS and settlement system. This part of EN 50463: - gives requirements for the complete Energy Measurement System and also requirements for all devices implementing one or more functions of the Energy Measurement System; - applies to newly manufactured Energy Measurement Systems for use on board railway traction units, powered by AC. and/or DC. supply voltages as listed in EN 50163; - does not apply to portable Energy Measurement Systems. The series is composed of 5 parts:\n\nPart 1 - General,\n\nPart 2 - Energy measuring\n\nPart 3 - Data handling\n\nPart 4 - Communication\n\nPart 5 - Conformity assessment\n\nFigure 6- Overview of the EN 50463 edition 2017\n\n3.3 - Relationship between Directive, TSIs and standards\n\nThe approach followed by the TSIs is based on the definition of the \"minimum interoperability requirements\", it means that only a subset of the requirements of a standard is mandatory from the point of view of the TSI. In the figure 7 these standards and the European Directives and Regulations are shown, where the \"minimum interoperability requirements\" are identified.\n\nFigure 7 - Relationship between Directive, TSIs and standards\n\nThe minimum interoperability requirements are stated in the TSIs with direct reference to the clause of the mentioned standard, e.g. the TSI LOC & PAS defines the reqiurements of the EN 50463 in the Appendix D, so these are mandatory requirements. The figure 8 details the relationship between the TSIs and the EN50463,\n\nFigure 8 - Relationship between Directive, TSIs and EN50463\n\nThe EN50463 specifies the requirements of the different functions: Voltage Measurement Function VMF, Current Measurement Function CMF, Energy Calculation Function ECF, Data Handling System DHS and Communication Function EMS - DCS while the EN50155 specifies the electrical, environmental and mechanical requirements. The EN50155 is the foundation standard for the on-board electronic equipment, the overview of the EN50155 is in figure 9. The allocation of the hardware and software resources to the functions is managed by the EN50155 system design guidelines, while the development of the software for the on-board electronic equipment is managed by the EN50657; in figure 9 you can see the overview of the EN50155 and the relationship with the EN50657.\n\nFigure 9 - Overview of the EN 50155 edition 2017\n\nThe manufacturer's technical dossier (documentation) of the equipment implementing the function of the Energy measurement System of this case study become the foundation document for the assessment figure 10 shows the relationships while the figure 11 put in evidence the test requirements.\n\nFigure 10 - Relationship between the standards\n\nFigure 11 - EN50155 and EN50463 test requirements\n\n4 - Methods of conformity assessment\n\n4.1 General methodology\n\nThe technical dossier will provide the test specification and the test procedure that will be used in the performance test of the EN50155. The performance test is the functional test of the equipment performed in the conditions requested by the EN50155; in the case study is the functional test the of the actual implementation of the EMS under assessment. The test reports shall be included into the technical dossier.\n\nThe technical dossier will allow the manufacturer to issue the \"Declaration of Conformity\" of the equipment under assessment, at least as generic application (more information on CE marking can be found here, search for the keyword \"Railway\"). From the technical dossier all the items will be extracted which necessary for the assessment of the requirements requested by the TSIs.\n\nThe conformity assessment is undertaken using the following methods:\n\na) device design review;\n\nb) device type test;\n\nc) device routine test;\n\nd) equipment integration design review;\n\ne) equipment integration type test;\n\nf) equipment installation design review;\n\ng) equipment installation type test;\n\nh) equipment installation routine test.\n\nFurthermore the following methods cover re-verification and replacement:\n\ni) equipment periodic re-verification;\n\nj) equipment device / ancillary component replacement.\n\nFigure 12 - Methods of conformity assessment\n\nMethods a) to c) are used at device level and the conformity assessment arrangements are covered by EN 50463-2, EN 50463-3 and EN 50463-4. Methods d) to j) apply at EMS system level and are described in part 5 of the EN 50463 series. Each method described generates evidence of conformity; see figure 12, 13 and 14.\n\nThe generic application, independent from a vehicle type, of manufacturer “ABC” can be suitable for all voltage systems, traction unit power ranging from 500 kW to 8 MW, expandable acquisition channel, different bus interface (e.g. CAN, MVB, Ethernet), different communication channels (e.g. GSM-R, LTE, Wi-Fi). Methods from a) to e), see figure 13, could be used as general methods for every kind of equipment:\n\nFigure 13 - Methods of conformity assessment of a generic application\n\nThe specific application aim is the tailored energy measurement system for the vehicle under assessment: e.g. a multi voltage locomotive with 3kVdc, 15kVac, 25kVac systems, maximum power 6,5MW, equipped with GSM-R, LTE and wi-fi communication channels and interfaced to the TCMS using the MVB; until now, we are dealing with the stage a) of the assessment process described in the introduction.\n\nIt is the subsystem level that requires the Notified Body’s assessment for the compliance to the TSI. This part deals with the stage b) of the assessment process described in the introduction. The technical dossier will provide the test specification and the test procedure that will be used in the performance test at the installation stage it is the test of the specific application.\n\nFigure 14 - Methods of conformity assessment of a specific application\n\nThe technical dossier will provide the test specification and the test procedure that will be used in the routine test process including the tests used to verify the replacement of devices and ancillary components of the equipment. It is worth noting that it is important to consider the traceability of the documentation related to TSIs mandatory requirements through all the phases of the project. Take note that the production, collation and assessment of the documentation requested by the involved Agencies could have a big impact in terms of time and effort.\n\n5 - Acronyms"
