        "text": "Accreditation is recognized by the government and by institutions as an effective instrument for guaranteeing confidence in certifications, inspections, tests and calibrations, supporting public policies for environmental protection, agrifood quality, the safety and security of people, products and information.\n\nAccredia supplies technical support with regard to the competences of the Public Authorities and plays an increasingly important role in ensuring the good functioning of rules in many sectors, from public tender contracts to professional people in non-regulated areas, from health to the environment, energy, preservation of digital information and the treatment of personal data.\n\nAccredia, through its contractual agreements with Government Ministries, qualifies certifications, inspections, tests and calibrations in the mandatory sectors which include agrifood and other consumer products, industry and infrastructures, all regulated under EU or national regulations and laws.\n\nAccredited CABs intending to operate in these areas, which often require use of the CE marking on products, must obtain accreditation to have ministerial authorization and, where necessary, notification status of the European Commission granted by the Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy. In the mandatory areas, therefore, accreditation is a pre-requisite necessary for performing conformity assessment activities."
