        "text": "We are a research institute operating for over 70 years in the railway transport area. Not only do we have our own test track but also facilities and equipment necessary to perform tests and scientific research in the field of rail transport.\n\nThe main activity of the Institute focuses on initiating and carrying out scientific research and development, tests and studies and their implementation. The Instituteâs organizational structure includes four research and testing departments, four laboratories, Quality and Certification Centre, Information and Standardization Centre, as well as the Facility in another location â Test Track in Å»migrÃ³d. All laboratories hold accreditation granted by the Polish Centre for Accreditation.\n\nThe Railway Research InstituteÂ is a Notified Body No. NB 1467 to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2016/797 of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system in the European Union for the assessment of all interoperable structural subsystems, i.e. Infrastructure, Energy, Control-Command and Signalling Track-side and On-board subsystems, rolling stock and traffic operation and management subsystems. The notification is for indefinite time.\n\nIt also holds safety authorization of the German Federal Railway Authority (EBA) to perform tests of railway vehicles. Moreover, it cooperates with many international organizations and associations (UIC, OSÅ»D, ECTRI, ERRAC, EURNEX, ELCF) as well as national and international research institutions.\n\nThe dynamic development of railways all over the world, High Speed Rail including (at least 250 km/h), and an important role assigned to railways within the European Union set new research and development tasks. Pitting high-speed against conventional rail systems, so often mentioned in various discussions, does not seem justified. Not only does the Railway Research Institute have a broad experience concerning conventional rail but it possesses and has acquired specialist knowledge and expertise in the progress and construction of High-Speed Rail , which should be intensively developed.\n\nIn 2017 the Railway Research Institute is celebrating its 65th anniversary. Since its establishment, it has changed the name four times.\n\nInitially it was set up on the basis of the Research Unit for Locomotives at the Ministry of Transport as the Scientific and Research Railway Institute (INBK), then in 1958 it was transformed into the Research and Development Centre for Railway Technology (COBiRTK) and in 1987 it was renamed as the Railway Scientific and Technical Centre (CNTK). The last change into the Railway Research Institute (IK) took place in 2010 and as before it was caused by changing the current Polish legal regulations.\n\nFor many years, up to 2000, the Institute (as CNTK) had beenÂ a part of the Polish State Railways (PKP). However, due to the Polish State Railwaysâ restructuring and commertialisation the Institute became an independent entity, subordinated directly to the minister responsible for transport.\n\nSince the beginning of its establishment, the Institute has been playing a vital role in the rail transport system in Poland. Many specialists who have worked in its departments, laboratories, centres and units have recorded outstanding achievements and gathered profound knowledge in technology, science, organization and operation. Numerous solutions have been developed and implemented here, due to which the railways have noted significant progress in many areas of their activities.\n\nÂ"
