        "text": "A knowledge sharing workshops for Indian Railway artisan staff was organised by NHSRCL in collaboration with Western Railway & Central Railway at a steel fabrication workshop in Vapi, Gujarat. Total 16 attendees including Welder, Welding inspectors, Chief technicians and Welding engineers from various railway facilities attended the session.\n\nTwenty-eight steel bridges are currently under construction for the Bullet Train project across six workshops situated in various locations throughout India. Stringent technical standards are being implemented for the fabrication and welding processes involved in constructing these bridges. NHSRCL is seizing this opportunity to disseminate best practices in steel fabrication and welding techniques to our counterparts in the Indian Railways.\n\nNHSRCL organised a knowledge sharing workshops for Indian Railway artisan staff in collaboration with Western Railways and Central Railways at a steel fabrication workshop in Vapi, Gujarat\n\nThe training of Indian engineers and work leaders has started for High-Speed Rail Track system for Mumbai Ahmedabad HSR corridor (MAHSR), for T-2 Package (covering 237 km between Vapi and Vadodara).\n\nIt is envisaged that only trained and certified engineers/work leaders are to work at site for track construction works. This will also help in ‘Transfer of Technology’ of Japanese HSR track system.\n\nThe ballast-less Slab Track system (popularly known as J Slab track system) as used in Japanese Shinkansen HSR will be used for India’s first HSR project. The training will be imparted by JARTS (a non-profit organization in Japan), nominated by JICA (funding agency of MAHSR project), through Japanese Experts in relevant field.\n\nThere will be 15 different courses covering all aspects of Track work, which includes, training for Site Managers, Track Slab Manufacturing, RC Track Bed construction, Reference Pin survey and data analysis, Slab Track installation, CAM installation, Rail weld finishing, Enclosed Arc welding of rails and Turnout installation.\n\nNearly 1000 engineers/work leaders/technicians are planned to be trained. Training facility with 3 (three) trail lines, has been specially created at Surat Depot for this.\n\nJapanese track system is unique in the world and requires very high level of skill to lay it. Track is the most important component of HSR system and needs to be laid to very high degree of accuracy. 20 (Twenty) Japanese experts will impart intensive training to the Indian engineers, supervisors & technicians and certify their skills.\n\nTraining for High-Speed Rail Track System for MAHSR Corridor starts for Indian Engineers\n\nTo give impetus to the National Skill Development Program, NHSRCL is organizing training programmes for the civil engineering students at the Geo Technical investigation lab, which is set up by M/s L&T in Surat for Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project (M/s L&T is executing the civil works between Vapi and Ahmedabad).\n\nThe laboratory is considered as Asia’s biggest Geotechnical Laboratory and has generated employment for an about 900 (500 at field and 400 at laboratories) persons including Engineers, Technician and Skilled Laborers. The lab is equipped with state- of-the- art investigation equipment. The facility can conduct 3500 tests per day through 20 geotechnical engineers and 188 lab technicians.\n\nDuring the training, the students are familiarized with the instruments being used for various geotechnical investigations.\n\nBesides lectures, field tests like Plate Load Test, Pile Load Test to determine the soil characteristics through laboratory testing are also demonstrated. The first batch of 35 students from Sardar Vallabh Bhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT),Surat have already received training in this facility.\n\nThe MAHSR project has also given a boost to the local Geotech investigation setup in upgrading their old equipment. About 15 laboratories at Valsad, Surat, Vadodara, Anand and Ahmedabad have upgraded their infrastructure to comply international standards required for the project. Fully Automatic and Semi-Automatic ground testing machines have also been deployed at project sites.\n\nStudents from Sardar Vallabh Bhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) attending a training session at Asia’s largest Geotechnical Lab in Surat"
