        "text": "Citation preview\n\nStudies in Private International Law Series Editors’ Preface For even the most dedicated private international law scholar or practitioner, it has become increasingly difficult to keep up in recent years with the tidal wave of EU legislation and judgments of the ECJ that impact upon the discipline. Ever more fields are the subject of harmonised rules of private international law in the European Union, or proposals for harmonisation. As the ambit and influence of those harmonised rules develops, so the role of national rules of private international law is diminished. In compiling this volume, Professor Stefania Bariatti, a leading figure in the field of private international law, has performed an outstanding service for those engaged in the study and practice of private international law. Professor Bariatti has assembled and catalogued a remarkable range of cases and materials covering the panoply of private international law matters which have been subject to harmonisation at a European level. Beginning with a most interesting chapter in which Professor Bariatti charts the development of EU private international law and reflects upon its future directions, the author goes on skilfully to organise, present and analyse a vast array of materials in a format that is extremely accessible to the reader. Professor Bariatti includes extremely helpful summaries and extracts of ECJ judgments, including the numerous rulings on the interpretation of the Brussels I Regulation, which are organised by reference to the Article or Articles to which they relate. There are also chapters covering such matters as: the law applicable to contractual obligations; the law applicable to non-contractual obligations; insolvency; companies; rights in rem, securities and intellectual property; social security; personality rights, status and family relations; succession; and judicial assistance in civil matters. The book addresses other initiatives that may influence the application of European rules of private international law. It includes Regulations and Directives in relation to particular matters that affect the operation of European rules of private international law. It also incorporates international conventions to which Member States are parties and which affect the application of European rules of private international law. The author also considers in some detail the impact of general principles of European law, such as the concept of citizenship, the protection of fundamental rights and the role of public policy and overriding mandatory provisions. The author has incorporated recent developments in European private international law, including, most notably, the Commission Proposal of 14 December 2010 to reform the Brussels I Regulation. The author reflects that the proposed extension of the Brussels I Regulation generally to defendants domiciled in non-Member States, coupled with the universal scope of other recent harmonisation initiatives, suggests that, in the future, all, or almost all, aspects of private international law will be the subject of European rules.\n\nv\n\nvi\n\nSeries Editors’ Preface\n\nProfessor Bariatti has produced an indispensible resource and we are delighted to welcome Cases and Materials on EU Private International Law to the Studies in Private International Law series. Paul Beaumont (University of Aberdeen) Jonathan Harris (University of Birmingham) 21 March 2011\n\nPreface This book aims primarily to provide a support for university courses on private international and EU law, as well as an instrument for practitioners who face conflicts of laws issues in their day-to-day legal practice. The development of EU legislation in this field has affected the competence of national legislatures and has substantially reduced the scope of domestic law. A considerable number of provisions have been adopted and are scattered throughout many legislative instruments based upon Article 81 TFEU or on other provisions of the Treaty (directives on consumer, labour and insurance contracts, company law, IP rights, securities, privacy, and so on). Moreover, the European Court of Justice has issued many interpretative judgments that concur with the acquis communautaire in this field. The cases and materials are presented in chapters, devoted to specific issues or relationships. An introduction provides an overview of the development of the competence of the European Union, from Article 220 of the EEC Treaty to Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and of its external dimension, as well as a preliminary tentative assessment of the principles and solutions adopted in respect of the general issues of private international law for further discussion. I wish to express my gratitude to the team of young scholars who – after two Italian editions in 2002 and 2009 – have helped me in preparing this English edition, Professor Carola Ricci, PhD Serena Crespi, PhD Giuseppe Serranò and Dr Eva De Goetzen. Comments and suggestions by readers will be most welcome and will help in limiting errors and gaps in a new edition. Stefania Bariatti Milan, 20 December 2010\n\nvii\n\nThe Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\n1.\n\nCooperation in the Field of Justice and Home Affairs under the Treaty of Maastricht\n\nCooperation among the Member States of the European Union on matters of justice and home affairs was formally established by the Treaty of Maastricht on the European Union in 1991, which entered into force in November 1993. Under Title VI, at Articles K–K9 numerous ‘matters of common interest’ deemed relevant for purposes of realising the free movement of persons — such as asylum policy, the crossing of the external borders and related controls, immigration policy and, more generally, policy vis-à-vis citizens of third countries, the ongoing fight against unauthorised immigration, residence and work by nationals of third countries, the fight against drug addiction, the fight against fraud on an international scale, judicial cooperation in civil matters, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, customs cooperation, police cooperation to prevent and fight terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crimes — were governed at the inter-governmental level (Article K.2 Treaty on the European Union (TEU)). At the institutional level, this sector fell under the responsibility of the Council, which was supported by a Coordinating Committee. The Commission was involved in these works, while the European Parliament was merely informed or consulted on the main issues. The Council could take joint positions or actions, whose effectiveness was not mentioned. In addition, it could draw up conventions to be submitted to the Member States for ratification. The Court of Justice had no duties or responsibilities with the exception of those conferred under such conventions. It was possible to establish an enhanced cooperation among a restricted group of States and the Council could decide to submit the adoption of measures in any of the above-mentioned fields to the procedure set out under the former Article 100c EC, subject to a decision by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. In reality, the Member States had already commenced intensive cooperation on these matters at the inter-governmental level, which had developed over time. In fact, some of these activities date back many years, even prior to the conclusion of the Single European Act, with the aim of completing the freedoms envisaged under the EC Treaty. From the very outset, Article 220 of the EEC Treaty (which later became Article 293 EC) assigned to the Member States the power to commence negotiations to the extent necessary in order to guarantee their citizens, inter alia, the protection of persons, the enjoyment and protection of the rights under the same conditions granted by each State to its own citizens, the mutual recognition of companies, the retention of legal personality in the event of 1\n\n2\n\nThe Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\ntransfer of their seat within the EC, the possibility of mergers of companies subject to different national legislations, the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments and arbitration awards. In these matters and in that initial phase of the European Economic Community, the selected method was the inter-governmental method, through the establishment of treaties among the Member States on certain specific matters. It is well-known that various texts based upon this provision were negotiated, but only one of them, the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters was adopted in 1968, was ratified by the Member States and entered into force in 1973. Its objective was to guarantee legal certainty for citizens and economic operators and equality of rights in raising their claims and in obtaining satisfaction for their rights, allowing for the exercise of what has come to be known as the ‘fifth freedom’, ie, the free circulation of judgments. The Brussels Convention marked the beginning of the European judicial area and established over the years a complex system that was extended to some third countries through the Lugano Convention of 1988. This area was based from the outset upon certain fundamental principles, which were later explicitly expressed at the Tampere summit in December 1999. In particular, access to justice in any Member State was guaranteed to all persons domiciled in the Community, at the same conditions applicable to the citizens of such State, both as plaintiffs (Articles 2(2) and 4(2) of the Brussels Convention), and as defendants (Article 4(1) of the Convention). The enjoyment of these rights was ensured regardless of citizenship, and therefore also for citizens of third countries, well beyond what would be imposed under the principle of non-discrimination set out under Article 12 EC. The automatic recognition of judgments and a facilitated uniform enforcement procedure throughout all of the Member States have facilitated the circulation of decisions and reduced discriminations among individuals in this phase as well. Moreover, Article 44 permitted legal aid in order to ensure that the same treatment in place in the State of origin would be available in the State of enforcement of the judgment, as it is generally available nowadays for all cross-border disputes under a specific directive. Subsequently — but outside the provisions of former Article 220 EEC — on 19 June 1980 the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations was concluded, which was supposed to be followed shortly thereafter by a parallel agreement on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. While this latter project was later abandoned, the Rome Convention was ratified by the Member States and entered into force a few years after its signing, on 1 April 1991, contributing to legal certainty before the courts of the Member States and reducing the effects of forum shopping. It is important to recall that the Rome Convention contained conflicts rules that were universal in scope, and therefore rendered applicable also the law of third countries, thus replacing national conflict rules within its scope of application. On the basis of the new provisions set out under Title VI of the Treaty of Maastricht, over just a few years a broad range of acts were formulated — resolutions, common positions, common actions, decisions, recommendations, agreements and conventions among the Member States, which created a quite vast body of provisions that produced varying effects, depending upon the type of act used. As regards judicial cooperation in civil matters, two conventions based upon Article K.3 were adopted and negotiations were initiated regarding other matters. In particular, a Convention on service of documents, as\n\nThe Area of Freedom, Security and Justice in the Treaty of Amsterdam 3 well as a Protocol on its interpretation by the Court of Justice (1997) and a Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters (known as Brussels II) (1998) were signed. A short time prior, in 1995, the Convention on insolvency procedures had been adopted, based upon Article 293 EC, that concluded a process which had continued over the span of many years in a sector falling under civil and commercial matters, that had been excluded from the outset from the scope of the 1968 Brussels Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Area of Freedom, Security and Justice in the Treaty of Amsterdam\n\nWith the Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force on 1 May 1999, very important changes were made to the third pillar of the European Union and the prospects of achieving cooperation in the justice and home affairs area changed dramatically with regard to both the scope of cooperation among the Member States and the instruments and institutional structure used in order to take into account the requirements related to the future development of the European Union. The cooperation in this area changed its name and objectives as the result of, on the one hand, the expansion of the matters that remained under the scope of Title VI TEU, and on the other, the communitarisation of a portion of activities which fell under its scope and which became an integral part of the EC Treaty, with important consequences from an institutional and regulatory standpoint. The notion of ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ had already been used in Article B (later Article 2) TEU, which indicated among the objectives of the European Union that of preserving and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons was guaranteed, together with measures for the control of external borders, asylum, immigration, the prevention of crime and the battle against crime. It was only with the Treaty of Amsterdam, however, and with certain acts which immediately followed it that the notion’s contents became precise. We are talking about, first of all, the Action Plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice, prepared prior to the entry into force of the said Treaty and adopted by the European Council of Vienna in December 1998 (known as the Vienna Action Plan), and later developed in the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council held in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999. The Vienna Action Plan states that the notion of freedom, which is based upon the Schengen system, does not only lead to free circulation within the European Union, but also to the freedom to live in an environment that is respectful of the law and is subject to control by public authorities in order to prevent the abuse of such freedom and to punish those who commit such abuse. It leads to the enjoyment of human rights, including the protection from any form of discrimination, as well as protection of personal data and privacy, which are particularly important from a criminal law standpoint. In the field of immigration and asylum, the primary objectives are the battle against clandestine immigration and the integration of legal residents, and the protection of those who require international protection even if they do not officially meet the parameters and conditions\n\n4\n\nThe Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\nof the Geneva Convention. Their transfer to Title IV EC, which we will return to later, allows for the adoption of binding acts and the establishment of control procedures. The need to guarantee security in the European Union does not lead to a need to call upon the duties and responsibilities of the individual Member States for the maintenance of internal safety, nor is it meant to lead to the creation of a common investigation area. On the contrary, it has to do with improving and reinforcing cooperation on criminal law matters, including in favour of the Union. The objective is the battle against crime (whether organised or not), such as terrorism, human trafficking, crimes against minors, unlawful trafficking of drugs and arms, corruption and fraud. The pursuit of the objective of justice, finally, should facilitate the day-to-day life of citizens, in affirming a common sense of justice and legal certainty throughout Europe, which ensures that those who pose a threat to the area of freedom and security are called before courts of law. This area encompasses both access to justice and legal cooperation among Member States on civil law matters (aimed at facilitating the identification of the competent court, the applicable law, the conduct of fast and fair proceedings, and effective enforcement procedures) and on criminal law matters (especially through the coordination of courts, equality in procedural guarantees through the establishment of standards and codes of conduct, in addition to the guarantees provided under the European Convention on human rights). The facilitation of cross-border proceedings through the development of more streamlined instruments for the exchange of documents and information, the use of multi-lingual forms, the creation of mechanisms for consultancy and legal assistance such as legal aid are also mentioned. The European Council at Tampere also specified the need for conditions ensuring that security and justice are accessible to all. In the European area of justice ‘people can approach courts and authorities in any Member State as easily as in their own. Criminals must find no ways of exploiting differences in the judicial systems of Member States. Judgements and decisions should be respected and enforced throughout the Union, while safeguarding the basic legal certainty of people and economic operators. Better compatibility and more convergence between the legal systems of Member States must be achieved’. Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, cooperation on justice and home affairs has made great progress. The cooperation on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters remained in the third pillar of the European Union, while the other areas of cooperation on matters of justice and home affairs were transferred under the first pillar, the Community pillar, where a new dedicated heading was created concerning ‘visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons’ (Title IV, Articles 61–69) after Title III concerning the four freedoms of circulation of goods, persons, services and capital. In particular, responsibilities on the following matters were transferred under the EC Treaty: a. measures concerning the implementation of free movement of persons and directly related flanking measures with respect to controls on external borders, asylum and immigration, indicated in Article 62 and intended to be introduced within five years from the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, aimed at governing the movement of citizens of Member States and third countries at internal borders, and controls at external borders and various matters concerning visas for stay and the freedom of stay for non-EC citizens;\n\nJudicial Cooperation on Civil Matters in the Treaty of Lisbon\n\n5\n\nb. measures on the matter of asylum, in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 1951 and any other treaty on the matter, and related to the temporary acceptance and protection of refugees and displaced people, and on the matter of immigration policy in order to govern in a uniform manner visas and stays of lawful immigrants and the entry and stay of clandestine immigrants (Article 63); c. measures in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, which include measures aimed at improving and simplifying the system for the cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents, cooperation in the taking of evidence, recognition and enforcement of judgments on civil and commercial matters, including decisions in extrajudicial cases, to promote compatibility of the national rules on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction, to eliminate impediments to the proper conduct of civil proceedings, possibly promoting compatibility of national procedural rules (Article 65); d. measures aimed at encouraging and reinforcing administrative cooperation on the above-mentioned matters (Article 66).\n\n3.\n\nJudicial Cooperation on Civil Matters in the Treaty of Lisbon\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, has introduced various important changes, both at the institutional level, and specifically with regard to the area of freedom, security and justice. From the first standpoint, two treaties were adopted: the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), containing provisions of a general institutional nature, and the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to which the provisions on the policies of the Union were moved. From the second standpoint, the area of freedom, security and justice is now governed under Title V TFEU, into which the activities related to cooperation on criminal law matters are integrated as well. As regards private international law, a separate chapter is now dedicated to judicial cooperation in civil matters (Chapter 3, comprised only of Article 81), which finally overcomes the limited and limiting reference to the policy on visas, asylum and immigration. It has to be noted, however, that the new Title still expresses itself in reductive terms with respect to the forms and contents of the activities falling in this field and which have been and will be carried out by the Union and by the Member States. The European legislature, unfortunately, did not take advantage of this opportunity — after the attempt made at the European Constitution, which never entered into force — to adopt a text which best reflects the actual situation of cooperation on this matter. Indeed, on one hand it is simplistic to talk about ‘judicial’ cooperation since these provisions do not involve merely cooperation among judicial authorities; but, on the other hand it is simplistic to speak of merely ‘cooperation’ if, as has occurred so far, regulations will continue to be adopted which lead to the uniformity of national legislations. In addition, it is also highly simplistic to condense these matters at Article 67(4) TFEU, at the beginning of Title V, mentioning as the sole express objective that of access to justice, which should be achieved ‘in particular through the principle of mutual recognition of judicial and extrajudicial decisions in civil matters’, when in reality the scope of the action is much broader.\n\n6\n\nThe Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\nFrom a standpoint of substance, Article 81 TFEU is broader than Article 65 EC since not only does it cover mutual recognition and enforcement between Member States of judgments and of decisions in extrajudicial cases; cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents; compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning conflict of laws and of jurisdiction; cooperation in the taking of evidence; elimination of obstacles to the proper functioning of civil proceedings, if necessary by promoting the compatibility of the rules on civil procedure applicable in the Member States; but it also covers effective access to justice, the development of alternative methods of dispute settlement, and support for the training of the judiciary and judicial staff.\n\n4.\n\nThe Type of Acts to be Adopted on the Basis of Article 81 TFEU\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, unlike the Constitution, does not affect the traditional and consolidated type of legislative acts of the Union, which instead, as regards the matter of judicial cooperation on civil matters, had been revolutionised by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Indeed, the communitarisation decided in 1997 had led to important changes to the prior structure as regards the instruments used, the adoption procedures and the related controls, as well as the relationships with other EU and international acts. First of all, as regards legislative acts, the inclusion of these matters within Title IV EC had led to the possibility of making use of all binding and non-binding acts, whether typical or atypical, provided under the same or which had affirmed in practice. From a concrete standpoint the communitarisation has therefore resolved two problems related to the nature and adoption of international conventions, which had served so far as instrument of the cooperation in this field. On the one hand, through the adoption of a Community act the timeframe for the entry into force of the agreed rules is greatly reduced as compared with a convention, which requires long negotiations and long ratification procedures by Member States. Consider for instance the outcome of the protocols to the 1980 Rome Convention which, after being adopted eight years later, entered into force in 2004. On the other hand, the law of the European Union is meant to produce the same effects throughout all Member States simultaneously. The text of Article 81 TFEU now retains the flexibility that had already made its appearance in Article 65 EC with reference to the type of measures that may be adopted. In practice, besides certain general acts which indicate future plans for the implementation of the area of freedom, security and justice and besides Directive 2003/8/ EC on access to justice, until now the legislature has adopted regulations on virtually an exclusive basis and would appear to be leaning toward continuing along this route, which better ensures the uniformity of the rights of the parties within the Member States through uniformity of applicable rules. On the other hand, differences deriving from the domestic implementation of directives already adopted in other fields and setting out rules of private international law — eg on consumer protection, employment and insurance — did not lend supporting evidence in favour this instrument in an area that is so close to the ambit of personal, and not only economic rights of individuals.\n\nThe Procedure for the Adoption of Acts Based upon Article 81 TFEU\n\n7\n\nAs for the lawfulness of this practice, the Protocol on the application of principles of subsidiarity and proportionality attached to the EC Treaty established under point 6 that ‘[o]ther things being equal, directives should be preferred to regulations and framework directives to detailed measures’. However, when the Commission proposed a draft directive on service of documents in May 1999, the European Parliament submitted an amendment (No 1) in order to have a regulation adopted due to the advantage of guaranteeing a fast, clear and consistent implementation of the text in line with its objectives,1 which was approved without any roadblocks. The following use of regulations should not be criticised. It is true that in the context of an international organisation the institutions have to comply with the instituting treaty and with all related acts, as the Protocol on subsidiarity certainly is; and it is also wellknown that, according to the ECJ, ‘a mere practice on the part of the Council cannot… create a precedent binding on Community institutions with regard to the correct legal basis’.2 The provisions of Title IV EC, however, vest the institutions with a certain level of discretionality in the selection of the measures to be adopted. Moreover, the role of subsequent practice in the application of treaties and the will of the Contracting Parties in interpreting and applying them, including treaties instituting international organisations, cannot be forgotten.3 In addition, the regulation constitutes the EU act whose effects most resemble those of an international treaty, such as the conventions entered into among the Member States that have been transformed into Community instruments. Article 81 TFEU does not introduce any substantive innovations in this regard, except the indication that ‘measures for the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States’ may be adopted (paragraph 1). Moreover, the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and of decisions in extrajudicial cases is expressly identified as the basis for actions in this area. Article 81(2), however, is more precise than Article 65 EC in defining the objectives, which no longer consist in merely improving and simplifying the matters subject to cooperation, but in guaranteeing their effective implementation.\n\n5.\n\nThe Procedure for the Adoption of Acts Based upon Article 81 TFEU\n\nThe procedure for the adoption of acts based upon Article 65 EC, as in all cases of application of Title IV EC, was governed by Article 67, which provided for a range of different procedures and majorities, depending upon the moment in which the act was adopted and the type of measure. The power in such regard was initially granted exclusively to the Council, which for the first five years from the entry into force of the Treaty of\n\n1 Amended proposal for a Council Regulation for the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, COM (2000) 75 of 29 March 2000, paragraph 2.1. 2 Judgment 23 February 1988, case 68/86, United Kingdom v Council. 3 The importance of the practice followed by Member State is also highlighted by A Borrás, ‘Derecho internacional privado y Tratado de Amsterdam’, (1999) 1 Revista Espanola de Derecho Internacional (1999) 395, 400 et seq.\n\n8\n\nThe Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\nAmsterdam, and therefore until 30 April 2004, would have decided unanimously,4 upon the Commission’s proposal or the initiative of a Member State, and after consulting the European Parliament. After such date, the power of initiative of the Member States ceased to apply and the acts have been adopted only upon proposal by the Commission, which has gathered the Member States’ requests. The Treaty of Amsterdam had also granted to the Council the power to directly amend certain of such provisions, without waiting for future amendments to the Treaties. Article 67(2), second hyphen, provided that the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, could take a decision with a view to providing for all or parts of the areas covered Title IV to be governed by the co-decision procedure. This would entail a closer involvement of the Parliament in the decision-making process and the abandonment of unanimity within the Council. The Treaty of Nice, entered into force on 1 February 2003, had added in Article 67 EC a fifth paragraph, pursuant to which the Council, as an exception to paragraph 1, could adopt measures based upon Article 65 EC through the co-decision procedure set out under Article 251 EC, with the exception of family law matters. Ever since, such measures have been enacted in accordance with the co-decision procedure. The Treaty of Lisbon maintains this procedure — now defined ordinary legislative procedure — for all of the acts based upon Article 81 TFEU, except for family law measures having cross-border implications, with respect to which the Council decides by unanimous vote, in accordance with the special procedure, and following consultation of the European Parliament. Through a special decision, also adopted unanimously and following consultation of the European Parliament, the Council may establish that certain acts on family law matters may follow the ordinary procedure. National parliaments may oppose the adoption of such decision within six months from the date on which the proposal is notified to them. In such case, the decision may not be adopted.\n\n6.\n\nThe Judicial Control over Acts Based upon Article 81 TFEU\n\nActs adopted under the framework of Title IV EC were already subject, in principle, to the control procedures set out under the Treaty, with certain exceptions that had been widely criticised precisely with regard to the acts in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters. The Court of Justice had jurisdiction to issue a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the provisions set out in Title IV and on the interpretation and validity of acts adopted on its basis pursuant to Article 234 EC, which was explicitly cited at Article 68(1) EC. The obligation to refer a question to the ECJ, however, was imposed only to courts of last resort and did not cover any ‘measure or decision taken pursuant to Article 62(1) relating to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security’ (Article 68(2)). 4 Reference was made to the unanimity of the Member States which participate in Title IV EC, from which Denmark was always excluded and from which the United Kingdom and Ireland could opt in (see below, at para 7).\n\nThe Judicial Control over Acts Based upon Article 81 TFEU\n\n9\n\nThe first limit, in particular, was difficult to justify considering the positive experience within the system created by and around the 1968 Brussels Convention, where the 1971 Luxembourg Protocol permitted courts of second instance to turn to the Court, thus guaranteeing uniformity of interpretation and unified control by the ECJ starting from the decision on the merits. Upon invitation by the European Council, the Commission had presented a proposal for a decision aimed at rendering Article 234 EC fully applicable to issues related to the interpretation of Title IV EC or the validity and interpretation of acts adopted on the basis of its provisions.5 The proposal was then abandoned in view of the entry into force of the European Constitution, first, and the Treaty of Lisbon, later, which achieved this aim. Indeed, the TFEU does not provide for any exception in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters to the general rules on the control over the lawfulness of acts and preliminary interpretation, now governed by Articles 263 and 267 TFEU.6 The full application of the general provisions of the Treaty in this field is proved by the infringement procedure under Article 227 EC (now Article 259 TFEU) that was commenced by Latvia against Italy in 2008 alleging the violation of Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 on matrimonial matters. In particular, the case concerned a decision of the Rome Tribunal that had ordered the return of a child to Italy after his removal to Latvia. The Commission, however, found that the Italian court had not infringed either the provisions of the Regulation or Article 24 of the Charter of fundamental rights, the UN Convention on the rights of children, and the principle of due process.7 It should be noted that in 2006 an urgent procedure for deciding upon references for preliminary rulings in the area of freedom, security and justice was introduced, which allows for the timeframe for proceedings before the Court of Justice in this area to be significantly shortened (Article 104(b) of the Rules of procedure).8 The urgent nature of the situation is not clearly defined, but the Information note provides the example of ‘proceedings concerning parental authority or custody of children, where the identity of the court having jurisdiction under European Union law depends on the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling’. The national court must set out the matters of fact and law which establish the urgency and, in particular, the risks involved in following the normal preliminary ruling procedure. The case is decided by a special chamber and significant simplifications in the procedure are envisaged, from the limited number of persons entitled to submit written observations (generally, only the parties involved in the national proceedings, the Member State to which the requesting court belongs and the\n\n5 COM (2006) 346 of 28 June 2006. The request was set out in the Hague Programme of 2004 (OJ, C 53 of 3 March 2005). 6 With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty also the power of the Council, the Commission and Member States to request the ECJ to interpret Title IV EC and the acts based upon it pursuant to Article 68(3) EC was abandoned. The ECJ rejected a request for preliminary interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 presented by a French court of first instance and based upon the Treaty of Lisbon prior to its entry into force (judgment 20 November 2009, case C-278/09, Martinez). 7 R Baratta, ‘Un recente procedimento di infrazione ‘interstatale’ dinanzi alla Commissione europea’ (2010) 115 Rivista di Diritto Internazionale, 115. It is worth mentioning that proceedings were initiated by Belgium against Switzerland before the International Court of Justice concerning the application of the 1988 Lugano Convention: see ICJ, Press Release No 2009/36 of 22 December 2009. 8 Council Decision 2008/79/EC, Euratom dated 20 December 2007 (OJ, L 24 of 29 January 2008), and the ECJ’s ‘Information note on references by national courts for preliminary rulings’, as amended after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (OJ, C 297 of 5 December 2009), at para 34 et seq.\n\n10 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules Commission), to the reduction of the written phase, to the use of electronic communication means. This procedure has proved very effective since some judgments have been adopted in less than three months from the application.\n\n7.\n\nThe Position of Certain Member States and Enhanced Cooperations\n\nNot all of the Member States of the European Union participate in the judicial cooperation in civil matters. Since the Amsterdam Treaty, a special form of enhanced cooperation has been established which in principle excludes the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, with the following clarifications. Under Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland entered into in Amsterdam and updated in Lisbon, these States may participate in the adoption of a measure already proposed by notifying their intention to the President of the Council within three months from the presentation of the proposal itself, and may notify at any time their intention of participating in a measure that has already been adopted. The two States had, however, already issued a general declaration in which they expressed their willingness to be included in the judicial cooperation on civil law matters at the meeting of the Council JHA held on 12 March 1999. Ireland has renewed such declaration in Lisbon, undertaking to review once again the functioning of the Protocol within three years from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.9 Both countries have participated in all of the acts adopted so far, but the United Kingdom has decided to participate in the Rome I Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 on maintenance obligations only after their adoption.10 The Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland adopted in Lisbon further provides, under Article 4a, that the above-mentioned provisions also apply in the event of amendments to acts already adopted and binding upon these two States. However, if their non-participation in the amended version of an act in force were to render its application inoperable for the other Member States or for the European Union — in case it consists of a ‘unitary’ act that could not be applied in different versions on a bilateral basis — the Council may invite Ireland and the UK to notify their participation in accordance with Article 3. The two States have two months to submit the notification. Should they fail to do so, the act in force would cease to apply to such States. This situation is addressed also by Declaration No 26 on non-participation by a Member State in a measure based on Title V of Part Three TFEU, according to which, if a Member State opts not to participate in such a measure, the Council will discuss the implications and effects of that Member State’s non-participation in the measure. Moreover, any Member State may ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 TFEU.\n\n9 See Declaration (No 56) by Ireland on Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice. 10 See the Commission Decisions 2009/26/EC of 22 December 2008 (OJ, L 10 of 15 January 2009) and 2009/451/EC of 8 June 2009 (OJ, L 149 of 12 June 2009).\n\nThe Position of Certain Member States and Enhanced Cooperations\n\n11\n\nDenmark’s position is different, since it may not render any declaration of participation in individual legislative acts, but — in accordance with the Protocol entered into in Amsterdam and renewed in Lisbon — it may accept one or more parts of Title V TFEU, thus becoming bound to all of the acts adopted until such declaration. From a standpoint of external relationships, Denmark is not bound by any conventions concluded by the Union in this field. This situation, which has generated difficulties and complications that emerged with clarity at the time of the transformation of the 1968 Brussels Convention into a regulation, has resulted in the need for the execution of two agreements between the Community and Denmark, based upon Article 61(c) EC, in order to render applicable to Denmark the Brussels I Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service of documents, later amended through Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007. The exclusive competence of the Community to enter into these agreements has never been called into question and, in any case, they were entered into on 27 April 2006, following the ECJ opinion 1/03 concerning the Lugano Convention. The agreements with Denmark entered into force on 1 July 2007. It is interesting to note that they also provide for a procedure that allows Denmark to adapt to any amendments to Regulations (EC) No 44/2001 and No 1348/2000 (see Article 3 of the agreements). A similar provision concerns the measures adopted in accordance with Article 17 and the opinions of the committee referred to under Article 18 of the Regulation on service. Article 8 of the Protocol attached to the Treaty of Lisbon, however, allows Denmark to revisit its constitutional position and to put itself in a situation substantially analogous to that of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Protocol, indeed, includes a schedule which Denmark may render applicable by way of notification to the other Member States at any time, which amends Articles 1–4 of the Protocol through provisions that are virtually identical to those set out in the protocol concerning the other two States. The judicial cooperation in civil matters has thus been since the beginning a sort of enhanced cooperation as not all of the Member States did participate in it. Very recently in this same field the first enhanced cooperation formally founded upon Article 20 TEU and Article 326 et seq. TFEU has been proposed in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation. In fact, following lack of unanimity within the Council on the proposal for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters (‘Rome III’),11 10 Member States12 requested the Commission to submit a proposal in the area of applicable law in matrimonial matters. The Commission proposed two draft instruments, aimed respectively at authorising the establishment of the enhanced cooperation and at implementing it. The former was adopted by the Council on 12 July 2010, while the Council adopted the latter on 20 December 2010. The enhanced cooperation will initially bind 14 Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia).13\n\n11\n\nCOM (2006) 399 of 17 July 2006. Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Romania and Slovenia. Greece later withdrew the request. 13 See Council Decision No 2010/405 authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation and Council Regulation No 1259/2010 of 20 December 2010. 12\n\n12 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\n8.\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters: Actions Already Performed and Plans for the Future\n\nAs anticipated above, prior to the Amsterdam Treaty the Member States had already established a solid intergovernmental cooperation in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters, both among themselves and with third countries. First of all, over the years the Members States have signed numerous conventions in this field, both among the Member States and with third countries. Certain of them have undergone considerable developments, so much as to be considered a self-standing system, such as the above-mentioned Brussels Convention of 27 September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments on civil and commercial matters, which was based upon Article 220 EC and has been in force since 1 February 1973 and updated repeatedly on the occasion of accession by new States to the EU. It was accompanied by a Protocol on interpretation entered into force in 1971 and by the parallel Lugano Convention of 1988, which was also binding upon Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, and has now been replaced by the new Convention signed in 2007 between the Community and these States.14 The Brussels Convention was followed by the Rome Convention of 19 June 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations, in force since 1 April 1991, which, while lacking any legal basis under the Treaty, was aimed at continuing ‘in the field of private international law the work of unification of law which has already been done within the Community, in particular in the field of jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments’. The Convention of 23 November 1995 on insolvency proceedings was also based upon the same provision of the EC Treaty. The Convention was concluded following lengthy and difficult negotiations, but it never entered into force and was eventually superseded by Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 to which we will return shortly. In the area of intergovernmental cooperation without any basis in specific provisions of the Treaties, two conventions were signed aimed at facilitating relations between the Member States, but they never entered into force at the international level. These were the Convention dated 25 May 1987 abolishing the legalisation of documents in the Member States, which is applied on a temporary basis on the basis of reciprocal declarations among Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and France, and the Convention dated 6 November 1990 on the simplification of procedures for the recovery of maintenance claims. Finally, Article 31 (formerly K.3) TEU had provided a legal basis for the Convention of 26 May 1997 on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters and the Convention of 28 May 1998 concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of matrimonial judgments (known as Brussels II). These agreements also never entered into force, but their provisions have been introduced to the new regulations adopted under Title IV EC.\n\n14 The Lugano Convention of 2007 entered into force in the relationships with Norway and Iceland on 1 January 2010 and will enter into force in relationships with Switzerland on 1 January 2011.\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters 13\n\n8.1.\n\nThe Vienna Action Plan of 1998\n\nBetween the signature and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, in December 1998 the Council and the Commission adopted an Action Plan on the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in the area of freedom, security and justice, which acknowledged the acts already adopted under Article 293 CE and Article 31 TEU and indicated certain priorities following a rather precise timetable. The Vienna Action Plan defined the priorities and the programme of future works on judicial cooperation on civil matters, with the aim ‘to make life simpler for European citizens by improving and simplifying the rules and procedures on cooperation and communication between authorities and on enforcing decisions, by promoting the compatibility of conflict of law rules and on jurisdiction and by eliminating obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings in a European judicial area’. This is clearly a paraphrase of the text of Article 65 EC, which is supplemented with the improvement of coordination of European judicial bodies and knowledge of the laws and regulations of the Member States, which did not appear in the text of the Treaty. The Action Plan further indicated certain measures to be adopted over the short term (two years) and certain others over a longer term (five years). The first included, first of all, the revision of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions, which had already been commenced prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam following a Communication of the Commission ‘Towards greater efficiency in obtaining and enforcing judgments in the European Union’ and a draft text of a new Brussels Convention, limited at such time to the Member States of the Union.15 Secondly, the Action Plan envisaged the drafting of a legal instrument, which was not better specified, on non-contractual obligations (known as Rome II); thirdly, it envisaged the revision of certain provisions of the Rome Convention on contractual obligations (Rome I) in order to implement a coordination between it and the choice-of-law rules provided in numerous directives, which in many cases had led to divergences and confusion. Finally, the possibility of creating a judicial European network in civil matters based on the model already in place in the criminal law area was proposed in order to facilitate the knowledge of the law of the Member States and the coordination of the proceedings. For the medium term, the Vienna Action Plan included a study on the possibility of adopting two legal instruments, respectively on the law applicable to divorce (Rome III) and on jurisdiction, applicable law and the enforcement of judgments on matrimonial property and successions. The first instrument, given the existence of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), was supposed to be aimed at identifying the applicable law in order to avoid forum shopping in this field. The second was supposed to take into consideration the connection between the two matters and the work conducted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Further, the Action Plan proposed the preparation of models for non-judicial solutions to disputes, mainly in family law matters; the identification of procedural rules to be harmonised in order to facilitate access to justice and the measures necessary in order to improve the compatibility of the rules on civil procedure, such as the rules on the deposition of security for litigation costs and expenses or those related to legal aid; 15\n\nOJ, C 33 of 31 January 1998.\n\n14 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules cooperation among judicial authorities in the taking of evidence; the assessment of the possibility of approximating certain areas of civil law through, for example, uniform private international law rules applicable to the acquisition in good faith of corporal movables.16 In this initial phase, therefore, certain studies were announced aimed at allowing for the analysis of prospects for development in certain areas or matters, but most importantly, the regulatory model of the convention was maintained, which had been successful for many years.\n\n8.2.\n\nThe Conclusions of the European Council at Tampere (1999)\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Vienna Action Plan was confirmed at the Tampere European Council of December 1999 and by a subsequent Draft Programme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters, which was quite ambitious, presented at the end of 2000 upon the European Council’s request. The Tampere conclusions, in particular, indicated three priorities for the development of a European judicial area. First of all, improved access to justice in Europe, to be guaranteed through a series of actions, the preparation of which had been assigned to the Commission, also in cooperation with other competent bodies such as the Council of Europe. The plan involved starting with the launch of an information campaign on judicial cooperation in the European Union and on legal systems of the Member States, with the publication of user guides and the establishment of an easy access information system, delegated to a network of competent national authorities. It also envisaged the drafting of minimum rules in order to ensure an adequate level of judicial assistance in cross-border disputes and common procedural rules to simplify and accelerate the resolution of small cross-border claims on commercial matters regarding consumers, disputes on maintenance obligations and on non-contested claims, including through the establishment of alternative national out-of-court procedures; the preparation of multilingual forms and documents for cross-border disputes, which would be accepted in all proceedings within the EU; the preparation of minimum rules for the protection of victims of crimes, particularly on the matter of access by victims to justice and the right to receive compensation for damages. Secondly, the Council of Tampere, as already mentioned, had approved the principle of mutual recognition of court decisions, which was meant to apply to both judgments and other decisions issued by judicial authorities, on civil and criminal matters, in order to facilitate cooperation between authorities and judicial protection of the rights of individuals. In the field of civil matters, the Commission was requested to present a proposal to reduce intermediate procedures for the recognition of judgments, first for\n\n16 It should be noted that there is a discrepancy among the various language versions of para 41(f), on the acquisition in good faith of movables: while the Spanish, Italian, English, Danish and Dutch texts refer to the adoption of rules of uniform private international law, the French and German versions make reference to uniform provisions of private law. Perhaps it is the second version that is correct, given that the approximation of certain areas of civil law is at stake.\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters 15 small claims in commercial matters or consumers disputes or for certain family disputes, clearly accompanied by minimal rules on certain procedural matters. Finally, the European Council had indicated the need to achieve greater convergence in the area of civil law, at both the procedural and the substantive level. The Council and the Commission had been asked to prepare legal provisions on certain procedural aspects pertaining to cross-border disputes, such as preliminary measures, taking of evidence, payment orders, and the commencement of a study on the approximation of national legislations on civil matters. It is clear that over the course of one year, from the Vienna Council to the Tampere Council, the prospects of this sector had changed considerably and the scope of Article 65 EC had expanded significantly. It is also worth noting that the structure of the programme was independent of the list of measures set out under Article 65 EC — which was nonexhaustive and thus did not pose any limit upon Community action in the field of civil justice — and made no reference to it, even when the planned measures would have fallen under its scope. Many acts have been adopted since 2000 implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the indications of the European Council of Tampere. Certain are the result of activities already under way, which have been adapted to the changing legal framework, while others represented a development of the same, which has not always been natural. As regards the first priority of Tampere, access to justice, Directive 2003/8/EC was adopted, with a view to improving access to justice in cross-border disputes through the definition of minimum common rules related to legal aid. It addresses various aspects of assistance in legal proceedings and legal advice, including exemption from legal expenses, free legal representation and contribution for legal expenses. In addition, on 28 May 2001, the Council adopted a Decision on the establishment of a European judicial network in civil and commercial matters, modelled after the one already in place in the criminal area, having the objective of improving judicial cooperation and providing information to the public in order to facilitate access to justice.17 More recently, a Directive on compensation to victims of crimes has been adopted (2004/80/EC of 29 April 2004), which establishes cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in order to ensure compensation for harm suffered as the result of an intentional crime committed in a Member State against life, health and personal integrity. It is based upon Article 308 EC (now Article 352 TFEU) since, as stated in the attached report, the State compensation is strictly related to civil law, but it is not a civil matter pursuant to Article 61(c) since it does not pertain to rights and duties between individuals. As for the third priority, ie, the convergence in the civil law sector, the Commission responded to the Tampere Council’s exhortation with a Communication on European contract law of September 2001,18 that opened a debate on the legal options in order to 17 The legal basis for the funding of all activities necessary for the development of the European judicial area in civil matters is set out in Regulation (EC) No 743/2002 of 25 April 2002 establishing a general Community framework of activities to facilitate the implementation of judicial cooperation in civil matters (OJ, L 115 of 1 May 2002). 18 OJ, C 255 of 13 September 2001. The reactions to the Communication are available on the website europa.eu.int/comm/consumers/policy/developments/contract_law/comments/summaries/sum_it.pdf. The Commission also submitted to the Council a draft report of the Council on the need to approximate the law of the Member States in civil matters (11621/01 REV 1-JUSTCIV 110, of 2 October 2001).\n\n16 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules harmonise private law. This Communication has been subject to significant discussion since it traces a direct link between this action and judicial cooperation in civil matters under Title IV. It was followed by an Action Plan in 2003 and more recently by a Common Frame of Reference for European contract law.19 Many acts have been adopted for purposes of implementing the second priority and the principle of mutual recognition, which is now the explicit basis for judicial cooperation in civil matters under Article 81 TFEU. At the time of the revision of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions, a few days prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was already clear that an international treaty could no longer be maintained as a viable legislative instrument and that the cooperation would have to be implemented by means of the standard EU acts provided under Article 249 EC (now 288 TFEU). We have already mentioned that the regulation was chosen since, according to the Commission, it best guarantees legal certainty for citizens and economic operators and meets the needs for clarity and homogeneity of Member States. In addition, the European Court of Justice’s interpretation was thus made possible without any additional instruments.20 Within slightly over a year, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses (known as Brussels II), Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (known as Brussels I) and Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters.\n\n8.3.\n\nThe Draft Programme of 2000\n\nThese acts were part of the Draft Programme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters mentioned above, adopted by the Council on 30 November 2000. This plan addressed both the methodological aspects and the substantive aspects of the sector, also indicating the subsequent deadlines, which provided a precise idea of the future of private international law in the European Union in the following years. The document laid down various levels of recognition, corresponding to the status of the areas in question and their future development. The minimum level is that of sectors that are not yet governed at EU level, which are subject to the national rules of the requested State and international conventions in force. Just above that, there is the first level, comprised of the procedure of the Brussels Convention and the Brussels II Regulation: the recognition is automatic and the enforcement is granted under a facilitated procedure, generally simpler than that envisaged at the lower level. The rules are common\n\n19\n\nSee ec.europa.eu/consumers/cons_int/safe_shop/fair_bus_pract/cont_law/common_frame_ref_en.htm. Proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, COM (1999) 348 of 14 July 1999 (OJ, C 376/1999 E). 20\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters 17 to all of the Member States and the recognition and enforcement may be refused only on the basis of reasons provided under the relevant act. At the higher level, the second level, we find the proceedings of the Brussels I Regulation and the Regulation on insolvency: the recognition is automatic, the enforcement must be granted after few formalities and it is possible to challenge it only subsequently, in any case after the grant of the exequatur by the judge receiving the request. At the even higher (‘new level’) of recognition, there is no longer any control over the foreign decision by the requested court: in certain areas, judgments may circulate freely and the European enforcement order is instituted. With regard to the matters for which the Community proposed to intervene, the intensity of the action was graduated depending upon whether they involved areas for which acts had already been issued by the European Union or areas newly subject to communitarisation. As for the first, it was deemed necessary to improve the functioning of the existing mechanisms, reducing or eliminating the obstacles to free circulation of court decisions, passing in other words to higher levels of recognition. In the area of family law, for example, an instrument was envisaged for the facilitation of the procedure for the recovery of maintenance claims, possibly through the elimination of enforcement proceedings. It should be recalled that the Member States had already entered into a convention on this matter in 1990, which never entered into force. In the context of commercial law, on the other hand, passage to the higher level of recognition was envisaged, involving the suppression of intermediate procedures, for noncontested claims and for small claims. The reduction of intermediate procedures involved the reduction of grounds for the refusal to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, and the introduction of the possibility to obtain temporary enforcement thereof, to enforce precautionary injunctions throughout the European Union on the basis of a decision issued in a Member State, and to carry out precautionary seizures over bank accounts at the European level. The elimination of intermediate procedures led to the complete free movement of the foreign judgments, no longer subject to any jurisdictional control. Where no prior Community acts existed, a lower level of recognition was envisaged, with the exception of particular cases, including certain aspects of disputes related to divorce or personal separation falling outside the scope of the Brussels II Regulation, such as parental custody and family situations falling outside the matrimonial sphere, matrimonial property regimes, wills and successions. Finally, certain supporting measures were indicated, such as the adoption of minimal common rules of procedure or, on occasion, harmonisation of procedures to ensure access to fair proceedings and, in any case, compliance with the European Convention on human rights, and to improve and accelerate the service of judicial documents, the preparation of measures aimed at improving efficiency in enforcement, such as the exchange of information on the debtor’s assets, in compliance, moreover, with the rules on the protection of personal data and on the confidential nature of certain information; the improvement of cooperation between judicial authorities of the Member States through the judicial network on civil and commercial law matters and the Regulation on the taking of evidence, mentioned above, the guarantee of access to justice for all, and the harmonisation of conflicts of laws rules. It is well-known that this latter measure has beneficial effects at the procedural level, since it reduces both forum shopping and the need for control over the law applied by the foreign court, particularly used in sensitive areas such as family law.\n\n18 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules Actually, the subsequent developments were achieved particularly in the area of family law through an amendment to the Brussels II Regulation, replaced by Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (Brussels IIa). An initiative by France for the adoption of a regulation the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children21 and a proposal by the Commission for a regulation related to jurisdiction, recognition and the enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility22 had been presented to the Council, but the debate had expanded to reconsider the private international law framework applicable to the entire area following the publication of a complex working paper prepared by the Commission on the ‘Mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility’.23 A discussion was opened also on the signing and ratification by the Member States of the Hague Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children of 1996. Parallel to the adoption of the decision which authorised the Member States to sign this Convention, a draft regulation of the Council had been presented, which was adopted in 2003.24 More recently, the Council adopted a decision which finally authorised the Member States to ratify the above-mentioned Hague Convention, thus posing an end to a deadlock situation which persisted for many years and which, after the latest expansion of the Union, had led to an asymmetry in international obligations of the Member States on this matter. In fact, for certain of the new Member States, the 1996 Hague Convention was already in force. In the area of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of decisions on civil and commercial matters, a draft amendment to Article 20 of the Brussels I Regulation had been presented by the Netherlands, in order to allow the employer to lodge a claim against the employee upon the termination of the employment contract also in the State where the employee habitually carries out his work or, if he carries out his works in more than one country, before the court of the place where the business which engaged him is situated. The Commission, on its part, had presented a ‘two phase strategy’: on the one hand, a draft regulation aimed at instituting a European enforcement order for non-contested claims, ie, a sort of ‘certificate’ for a judicial decision related to such claims in order to guarantee the free circulation of the same and the enforceability in all Member States without the need for any exequatur, to complement the procedure for recognition and enforcement of the Brussels I Regulation; on the other hand, a Green Paper on a European order for payment procedure and on measures to simplify and speed up small claims litigation, with the view to adopting an act aimed at completing Directive 2000/35/EC of 29 June 2000 on combating late payment in commercial transactions through the establishment of a special harmonised procedure for the recovery of non-contested claims. These were two complementary initiatives which were neither mutually exclusive nor overlapping.\n\n21\n\nOJ, C 234 of 15 August 2000. COM (2001) 505 of 6 September 2001. 23 COM (2001) 166 of 27 March 2001. 24 The Commission’s proposal included a provision aimed at amending Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 with reference to maintenance obligations, but this provision was abandoned. The Regulation was eventually amended in this respect by Regulation (EC) No 4/2009. It is worth mentioning that a European Parliament Mediator for international parental child abduction was created in 1987, with the task of helping children from binational marriages who have been abducted by one of their parents (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/ staticDisplay.do?id=154). 22\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters 19 On the contrary, according to the Commission, ‘the existence of a European order for payment procedure would not only create a level playing field for creditors and debtors throughout the Member States in terms of affording them equal access to justice. It could also bring about further progress in the field of recognition and enforcement by rendering superfluous even the requirement of certification envisaged under the proposal for a European Enforcement Order’.25\n\n8.4.\n\nThe Hague Programme of 2004\n\nSubsequently, the objectives of the judicial cooperation in civil matters were confirmed in the Hague Programme on the reinforcement of freedom, security and justice, adopted by the European Council on 4 November 2004, which proposed to reinforce mutual trust and to develop gradually a European judicial culture based upon the diversity of the legal systems of the Member States and the unity of European law. As regards the measures to be adopted,26 it stated that the programme of measures on mutual recognition was supposed to have been completed in 2011 with the adoption of instruments on the law applicable to contractual and extra-contractual obligations, on the European order for payment procedure and on the European small claims procedure. The standardisation of procedures and documents and the elaboration of minimum rules concerning aspects of procedural law were also envisaged, such as service, the commencement of proceedings, the enforcement of judgments and the transparency of costs. In the field of family law and successions, the Commission was asked to present a proposal for an instrument on the recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning maintenance obligations and some green papers on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction in the area of successions, matrimonial property regimes and divorce. It is worth pointing out that in the field of family law it was not required that the acts be based upon harmonised concepts of ‘family’ or ‘marriage’: uniform provisions of substantive law could constitute merely supporting rules and were not deemed necessary.27 Finally, the Hague Programme of 2004 purported to guarantee consistency and improve the quality of the Community legal framework, particularly through the adoption of provisions which allowed the Council to proceed with a more systematic review of the quality and consistency of the legal instruments concerning cooperation on civil matters. The Hague Programme was implemented over a very short period of time. Within four years, regulations were adopted which established a European Enforcement Order (No 805/2004), a European order for payment procedure (No 1896/2006) and a European Small Claims Procedure (No 861/2007), in addition to Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1348/00 on service, Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 on 25 26\n\nCOM (2002) 746 def of 20 December 2002, para 2.9. On developments of the external action in this area, as envisaged under the Plan of 2004, see para 10\n\nbelow. 27 This should not be surprising: private international law has developed for purposes of providing a solution for cross-border cases which present points of contact with more than one State, having different substantive laws. The harmonisation of national substantive laws was neither deemed necessary nor required for the adoption of national rules of private international law, and it has developed in certain areas through international conventions and model laws.\n\n20 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules maintenance obligations and the above-mentioned Directive 2004/80/EC on compensation to victims of crime. In the area of conflicts of laws, Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) were adopted.28 Instead, as mentioned above, the draft regulation which was supposed to amend the Brussels IIa Regulation only with respect to jurisdiction and which aimed at introducing rules on the law applicable in the matrimonial area (Rome III) was abandoned in June 2008 since unanimity could not be reached. The Council concluded that the conditions set forth by Article 20 TEU for the establishment of an enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation were satisfied and, upon the request of nine Member States, the Commission submitted two proposals to this end, which were adopted by the Council in 2010.29 In addition, the Commission answered the European Council’s invitation, presenting a draft regulation on successions and a green paper on matrimonial property.30\n\n8.5.\n\nThe Stockholm Programme of 2009\n\nFinally, in October 2009 the European Council adopted the Stockholm Programme, providing guidance for the activities in the area of freedom, security and justice for the period 2010–2014.31 The future actions will be centred on the citizen and other persons for whom the EU has a responsibility and will aim at promoting European citizenship and fundamental rights of individuals, and developing the external dimension. The European Council has noted that the development of legislation has been impressive, but it has shortcomings in terms of overlapping and a certain lack of coherence, and the quality of the legislation could be improved. As concerns the protection of fundamental rights, the European Council has invited the Commission to submit a proposal on the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. The protection of personal data at international level should be enhanced through the adoption of a recommendation for the negotiation of a data protection and, where necessary, data sharing agreements for law enforcement purposes with third countries. The European Council has underlined the improvements achieved in respect to the application of the principle of mutual recognition, and has considered that the process of abolishing all intermediate measures should be continued, to be accompanied by a series of safeguards, especially regarding judgments taken by default. Mutual recognition should be extended to succession and wills, matrimonial property rights and the property consequences of the separation of couples. The harmonisation of conflict-of-law rules\n\n28 It should be noted that in the meantime, on 1 August 2004, the two Protocols on the interpretation by the Court of Justice of the 1980 Rome Convention had entered into force. The Rome Convention remains in force for contracts entered into prior to the date of application of the Rome I Regulation, ie 17 December 2010. 29 See above at fn 13. 30 COM (2009) 154 of 14 October 2009 and COM (2006) 400 of 17 July 2006. 31 On 10 June 2009 the Commission had adopted the communication ‘An area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizen’ (COM (2009) 262).\n\nThe Scope of Judicial Cooperation on Civil Matters 21 should also continue in the areas of separation and divorces, company law, insurance contracts and security interests. The European Council also requested the Commission to follow up on the recent study on the possible problems encountered with regard to civil status documents and access to registers of such documents and to submit appropriate proposals with the aim of setting up a system whereby citizens would be able to obtain their own civil status documents and eventually the effects of civil status documents would be mutually recognised. Moreover, the possibility of abolishing all formalities for the legalisation of documents between Member States should be studied with the aim of creating, in the long term, authentic European documents. In order to support economic activity in the single market the Commission was invited to assess the need for, and the feasibility of, providing for certain provisional, including protective, measures to prevent the disappearance of assets before the enforcement of a claim, and to submit a proposal for improving the efficiency of enforcement of judgments regarding bank accounts and debtors’ assets. As concerns the external dimension, the European Council noted that the Lugano Convention is open to the accession of other States and it should be assessed, in cooperation with the other Contracting Parties, which third countries could be encouraged to accede to it. The participation in the Hague Conference should help in promoting the widest possible accession to the most relevant Conventions and to offer as much assistance as possible to other States with a view to the proper implementation of the instruments. More generally, the European Council noticed that the Lisbon Treaty offers new possibilities for the European Union to act more efficiently in external relations and that the new legal basis for concluding international agreements will ensure that the Union can negotiate more effectively with key partners, ie candidate countries and countries with a European Union membership perspective, European neighbourhood countries, EEA/ Schengen States having a close relationship with the EU, the United States of America, the Russian Federation and other strategic partners, other countries or regions of priority, in terms of their contribution to EU strategic or geographical priorities, international organisations such as the UN and the Council of Europe with whom the Union need to continue to work and within which the Union should coordinate its position. On 20 April 2010 the Commission adopted the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme,32 and announced the presentation of proposals for regulations amending the Brussels I Regulation (which was actually presented on 15 December 2010), the Brussels II Regulation (2011) and the insolvency Regulation (2012), as well as proposals for instruments on matrimonial property regimes, on a European attachment of bank accounts and on contract law by the end of 2010. Finally, the Commission announced that it will carry out studies concerning the recognition of civil status documents with the aim of presenting a green paper in 2010 and a legislative proposal by the end of 2013, when also a proposal for a regulation on the transparency of debtor’s assets with the aim of improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments and a legislative proposal on the abolition of legalisation would be ready. A green paper on private international law aspects relating to companies, associations and other legal entities is scheduled for 2014.\n\n32\n\nCOM (2010) 171.\n\n22 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules\n\n9.\n\nThe Relationship of Article 65 EC and Article 81 TFEU with other Provisions of the Treaty\n\nOne problem that was debated at length by the first commentators on the communitarisation of the judicial cooperation in civil law matters related to the position of art 65 CE within the system established by the Treaty. This problem concerns primarily the existence of possible limits upon the Community’s activities, ie, whether Articles 61 and 65 EC granted to it a general competence in this field or if the Community’s powers were limited to only what is necessary in order to develop the other matters falling under the scope of Title IV. An additional issue was connected and interwoven with this one, concerning possible connections with Article 293 (formerly 220) EC and with Article 95 (formerly 100a) CE. While the issue of the relationships between Article 81 TFEU and Article 293 EC is no longer relevant, since the Treaty of Lisbon definitively abrogated the latter, the other problems still remain open.\n\n9.1.\n\nThe Relationship with Article 293 EC\n\nAs concerns the relationship of between Article 65 EC and Article 293 EC, it had been argued that the former should be positioned within Title VI TEU since the provisions and the position of the new Title IV EC had been designed for the free circulation of persons and for the Schengen acquis and not for cooperation in the field of private international law. The inclusion of this cooperation within Title IV EC would have led to an overlapping with Article 293 EC, which had remained unaltered from 1957, and which ordered the commencement of negotiations among the Member States in order to mutually ensure to their citizens, through international conventions, the protection of persons and the enjoyment of rights, the elimination of double taxation, mutual recognition of companies, maintenance of legal personality in the event of transfer of a registered office and the merger of companies subject to different laws, the simplification of formalities for the recognition and enforcement of judgments and arbitration awards.33 This view could not be shared and, in any case, it has been superseded by practice over the past 10 years. Indeed, Article 293 EC did not apply to all of the matters falling under the scope of Article 65 EC, but concerned only certain aspects of procedural law in cross-border matters. In fact, the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations had been entered into outside the EC Treaty as a continuation and completion 33 According to the scholarly position under discussion here, since under the Commission’s proposal to the inter-governmental conference which led to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 220 EC was supposed to disappear, the fact that it remained (see Article 293) confirms the nature and scope of Article 65: this would be limited to what is necessary in the area of visas and free movement of persons, while choice-of-law rules would remain included under Article 293 and subject to the inter-governmental method: Ch Kohler, ‘Interrogations sur les Sources du Droit International Privé Européen après le Traité d’Amsterdam’ (1999) Revue critique 8 et seq, 11, 15, 22. On the theory that Article 65 is limited to the measures necessary for purposes of the policies indicated under the heading of Title IV and would have merely the function of supplementing Article 95 EC, see also J Basedow, ‘The Communitarization of the Conflict of Laws under the Treaty of Amsterdam’(2000) Common Market Law Review 697.\n\nThe Relationship with Article 114 TFEU (Formerly Article 95 EC)\n\n23\n\nof the 1968 Brussels Convention. In addition, the scope of Article 293 EC was limited to measures in favour of citizens of the Member States, while the provisions contained in Title IV EC also concerned the citizens of third countries. In any case, Article 293 EC already appeared to have been superseded following the Treaty of Maastricht: Article K.3 TEU, indeed, has provided the basis for certain of the above-mentioned conventions, with the sole exception of the Convention on insolvency proceedings concluded in 1995. It was therefore difficult to avoid concluding that Article 61(c) EC was broad in scope and capable of vesting the Community with the powers to adopt acts related to any aspect of judicial cooperation in civil matters, of which the rules on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction are only one of the sectors, indicated by way of example (‘shall include’, stated the text of Article 65 EC). The same wording appears now in Article 81 TFEU, with reference to the Union, which also restates the two conditions already provided under Article 65 EC, ie, that there are cross-border implications and that the action is taken ‘particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market’.\n\n9.2. The Relationship with Article 114 TFEU (Formerly Article 95 EC) The notion of ‘proper functioning of the internal market’ has a rather wide scope, not limited to persons, but also encompassing entire sectors of economic life. Consequently, Article 81 TFEU, like Article 65 EC beforehand, does not supplement Article 114 TFEU (formerly Article 95 EC), which provides for measures aiming at the approximation of rules of law having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It has been properly noted, inter alia, that if until the Treaty of Amsterdam the main provisions on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction were those founded upon Article 293 EC or Article K.3 TEU or agreed in an inter-governmental context, there is no reason why the communitarisation should bring them under the scope of Article 114 TFEU (formerly Article 95 EC). Indeed, in sectors that are not related to the free movement of persons in which this provision could well have fully applied in the past, it was never used: the unification of the rules on the law applicable to contractual obligations, which was deemed necessary given the existence of ‘legal fields in which the differences between national legal systems and the lack of unified rules of conflict definitely impede the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital among the Member States’,34 was reached through the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations, concluded outside the scope of Article 220 EC. The reference to the internal market contained in the two provisions — Article 65 CE/81 TFEU and Article 95 CE/114 TFEU — must therefore not lead to confusion as to their respective scopes and objectives. In addition, as it has been highlighted, the practice of EC institutions in these years from the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam has gone in the direction of a 34 M Giuliano and P Lagarde, Report on the Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations, OJ, C 282 of 31 October 1980, at para 2, citing the speech by the general director Vogelaar at the inaugural meeting of the government experts in charge of drafting the Convention.\n\n24 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules utilization of Article 65 EC and, in any case, of the reference to the ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ or the ‘European judicial area’ as a basis for the measures adopted or planned. No mention has ever been made of Article 95 EC, although in various cases the measures for harmonisation of substantive law adopted on the basis of the latter may contain, and in fact do contain, provisions on conflicts of laws and jurisdictions. Moreover, the last acts adopted on the basis of Article 65 EC show that the presence of a rule granting general competence to the institutions ensures greater attention to the matter and tends to ensure better coordination among provisions contained in different acts than has occurred in the past. As a final note on this point, the conclusions in the Fundación Gaia-Salvador Dalí case are worth recalling. In that case, in order to rule out the possibility that Directive 2001/84/EC on the resale right contains choice-of-law rules for the identification of the beneficiaries after the author’s death, Attorney general Sharpston stated that ‘had there been any intention to harmonise choice of law rules in the field of succession, the Directive could not have been based, as it is, simply on Article 95 EC, but would have had to refer… to Article 61 EC and 67 EC’.35 The limit posed upon the adoption of measures within the context of Article 81 TFEU — ‘particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market’ — merits further discussion. While it is certainly different from the general limit under Article 115 TFEU (formerly Article 94 CE) concerning measures that ‘directly affect the establishment or functioning of the internal market’, it is not so clear precisely what the former consists of. On the contrary, the limit established at Article 81 TFEU appears close or similar to the limit posed on measures referred to under Article 114 TFEU, having ‘as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market’, so much so as to lead to refer to the criteria laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment concerning the Directive 98/43/EC on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products. According to the ECJ, the objective of Article 95 EC does not allow for it to be interpreted as granting to the Community (now to the Union) the general power to regulate the internal market. This would not only be contrary to the tenor of such provisions, ‘but would also be incompatible with the principle embodied in Article 3b of the EC Treaty [now Article 5 TEU] that the powers of the Community are limited to those specifically conferred on it. Moreover, a measure adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty must genuinely have as its object the improvement of the conditions for the establishment and functioning of the internal market. If a mere finding of disparities between national rules and of the abstract risk of obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms or of distortions of competition liable to result therefrom were sufficient to justify the choice of Article 100a as a legal basis, judicial review of compliance with the proper legal basis might be rendered nugatory. The Court would then be prevented from discharging the function entrusted to it by Article 164 of the EC Treaty (now Article 220 EC) of ensuring that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaty’.36 These considerations still apply with reference to Article 81 TFEU, but with one clarification: the institutions have not been granted general carte blanche power to render uniform or to promote the compatibility of national rules on conflicts of laws and 35 36\n\nand 84.\n\nCase C-518/08. The judgment was given on 15 April 2010. Judgment 5 October 2000, case C-376/98, Germany v European Parliament and Council, points 83\n\nThe Conflict-of-Law Rules Set Out in Acts Based upon Other Provisions of the TFEU\n\n25\n\njurisdiction, but only to the extent necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. This notion appears to have a more complex meaning than the mere ‘functioning’, so as to be capable of forming the basis of Union power in a broader number of cases as compared with Article 114 TFEU, which always had a broad scope of application. If the existence of divergences between the legal systems of the Member States and the resulting risk of impediments to the fundamental freedoms or distortions in competition are perhaps insufficient, the qualification of the functioning as ‘proper’ might suggest a more incisive evaluation and control. Furthermore, Article 81 TFEU would appear to diminish the role of the need for the measure adopted with reference to the functioning of the internal market where it grants to the institutions regulatory power in this field ‘in particular if necessary to the proper functioning of the internal market’.\n\n10.\n\nThe Conflict-of-Law Rules Set Out in Acts Based upon Other Provisions of the TFEU\n\nThe significant production of laws, which in just a few years reduced the scope of national systems of private international law, does not constitute the entire legal framework of reference of the Union in this field, which includes numerous acts and instruments adopted in the context of other policies, containing rules on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction. Take, for example, the directives on employment, insurance and consumer contracts, the regulations on EU intellectual property rights, and so on. As we may see from the vastness of the material presented in this volume, the provisions that are relevant for purposes of our analysis are very numerous and may be found in an extensive range of acts pertaining to a very broad range of areas. In addition, the presence of the general rule on the matter, Article 65 EC and today Article 81 TFEU, has granted greater attention to the problems of private international law, thus facilitating and improving coordination between provisions contained in various acts. This is a concern which has been the focus of attention on the part of the Member States since the adoption of the Rome Convention, which included as an attachment a common declaration that, in order to avoid the possible ‘dispersion of choice of law rules among several instruments and differences between these rules’, trusted that the institutions would ‘endeavour’ to adopt provisions that were consistent with those set out in the Convention, to the extent possible. Recital No 35 of the Rome II Regulation leans in this direction, where it states that ‘[a] situation where conflict-of-law rules are dispersed among several instruments and where there are differences between those rules should be avoided. This Regulation, however, does not exclude the possibility of inclusion of conflict-of-law rules relating to non-contractual obligations in provisions of Community law with regard to particular matters.’ Substantially the same wording appears at Recital No 40 of the Rome I Regulation.37 The fact that the general provisions on conflicts of laws and jurisdiction in certain areas are gathered together under general acts, leaving the possibility of providing only\n\n37\n\nRecital No 40 of the Rome I Regulation states that ‘this regulation should not exclude’ (italics added).\n\n26 The Development of EU Private International Law: Instruments, Principles, Rules for exceptions that may be necessary or opportune in particular areas precisely to the acts dealing with those particular areas, better ensures the consistency of the system and the uniformity of the connecting factors used and the objectives to be achieved.38 Indeed, it should be noted that actually these widely dispersed provisions adopted so far in specific areas not only reflect the complexity of the decision-making mechanisms which govern the division of powers within the EU institutions, but document the presence of incongruities and the lack of uniformity even within the same area. By way of example, in order to illustrate the difficulties deriving from the fragmentation of the legal framework, we may mention the directives related to consumer contracts39 in which the objective of guaranteeing a minimum common level of protection of the weaker contractual party was achieved using modalities which changed over time. The first directives provided only substantive rules, with a provision of the scope of application and on minimum treatment, as well as provisions that could not be derogated by the parties.40 Some later directives, however, such as that on distance contracts, that on unfair terms and that on the sale of consumer goods and associated warranties, operate also at the level of private international law where they provide that the consumer may not be deprived of the protection granted by the directive through the choice of the law of a third country where the contract is connected to the territory of one or more Member States. This provision, which apparently reiterates Article 5 of the Rome Convention, in reality adds certain elements: on the one hand, the protection is granted for all contracts entered into by the consumer using the modalities envisaged under the directive in question; on the other hand, the protection is granted only if the law of the non-EU country, in theory less protective, was chosen by the parties (Article 5(2) of the Convention and Article 6(2) of the Rome I Regulation), but no protection is granted if such law applies pursuant to Article 5(3) of the same Convention (or Article 6(1) of the said Regulation, ie, as the law of the consumer’s State of residence lacking any choice by the parties). Therefore, the rule protects only the consumer domiciled in the EU, who enters into a contract where the parties contractually agree that the law of a third country will apply. The Directive on timeshare provides an exception, in so far as, for obvious reasons, it links the protection to the presence of the real estate asset within the Union, regardless of the location of the consumer and the law governing the contract.41\n\n38 See the Position Paper presented by P Beaumont, at the hearing on the proposed directive on services held at the European Parliament on 11 November 2004, and the Position of the European Group of Private International Law on the draft directive of the European Parliament and the Council on services in the internal market of 24 November 2004, www.drt.ucl.ac.be/gedip/DirservicesE.html. 39 In this area, directives contain rules of general application, such as those on misleading and comparative advertising, on unfair terms, on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, and directives which specifically concern sales sectors and methods, such as food products, cosmetics, denominations in the textile sector, pharmaceutical for human use, ‘all-inclusive’ travel packages, consumer credit, timeshare, distance contracts (see for the related data the EC Commission’s communication ‘Green paper on the protection of consumers in the European Union’, COM (2001) 531 of 2 October 2001). Recently, the Commission presented a proposed directive on consumer rights which aims at reformulating certain of the above-mentioned directives (COM (2008) 614 of 8 October 2008). 40 See Articles 5(3) and 8 of Directive 90/314/CEE on package travel, package holidays and package tours (OJ, L 158 of 23 June 1990). 41 The relevant provisions of these directives are set out below under Chapter VI, as well as the decision issued by the Court of Justice in case C-70/03, Commission v Spain, concerning the implementation of the protection clauses contained in Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms.\n\nThe Conflict-of-Law Rules Set Out in Acts Based upon Other Provisions of the TFEU\n\n27\n\nThe limitation of protection in favour of solely the EU consumer is explained by the objective of the above-mentioned directives, ie, the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or adminis"
