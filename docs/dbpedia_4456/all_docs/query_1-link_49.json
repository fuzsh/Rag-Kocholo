        "text": "Standards are requirements, typically technical and engineering in nature, which railway companies must follow to ensure a safe and secure rail transportation system. Some (engineering standards) are submitted by industry and approved by the Minister of Transport, others are developed by Transport Canada or other regulating entities.\n\nBelow is a list of Rail related Standards.\n\nOther Standards\n\nVehicle Traffic Control Signal Heads: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Circular Signal Supplement, section 4.2 Chromaticity, prepared by the Joint Industry and Traffic Engineering Council Committee, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, June 2005.\n\nThe Vehicle Traffic Control Signal Heads: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Circular Signal Supplement of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, was prepared by the Joint Industry and Traffic Engineering Council Committee. The purpose of section 4.2 Chromaticity, is to specify the chromaticity requirements for light emitting diode (LED) vehicle traffic signal modules while in service. This section is referenced in the Grade Crossings Standards. To obtain a copy of the document, search online or contact the Institute of Transportation Engineers.\n\nPedestrian Traffic Control Signal Indications - Part 2: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Pedestrian Traffic Signal Modules, prepared by the Joint Industry and Traffic Engineering Council Committee, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, March 19 2004\n\nThe Pedestrian Traffic Control Signal Indications - Part 2: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Pedestrian Traffic Signal Modules of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, was prepared by the Joint Industry and Traffic Engineering Council Committee. The purpose of this specification is to provide the minimum performance requirements for the “walking person” and “hand” icon pedestrian signal modules. This specification is referenced in the Grade Crossings Standards.\n\nTo obtain a copy of the document, search online or contact the Institute of Transportation Engineers.\n\nMethod 1010.8 Temperature cycling - MIL-STD-883H, extract of Test Method Standard, Microcircuits, MIL-STD-883H, published by the Department of Defense of the United States, February 26, 2010\n\nMethod 1010.8 Temperature cycling - MIL-STD-883H is an extract of Test Method Standard, Microcircuits, MIL-STD-883H, published by the Department of Defense of the United States. This test is conducted to determine the resistance of a part to extremes of high and low temperatures, and to the effect of alternate exposures to these extremes. This method is referenced in the Grade Crossings Standards.\n\nTo obtain a copy of the document, search online or contact the Department of Defense of the United States."
