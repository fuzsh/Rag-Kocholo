        "text": "This Statutory Instrument (SI) has been made under the European Union (Withdrawal)\n\nAct 2018 to ensure that the UK statute book is ready, on Exit, to comply with The\n\nHague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the 2005 Hague\n\nConvention). The 2005 Hague Convention aims to ensure the effectiveness of choice\n\nof court agreements made between parties to international commercial contracts.\n\nThe UK and EU have agreed that during the implementation period, the UK is to be\n\ntreated as a Member State for the purposes of international agreements, including the\n\n2005 Hague Convention. This Statutory Instrument therefore would only apply in\n\nthe unlikely event that the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU is not concluded.\n\nThe UK currently participates in the 2005 Hague Convention by virtue of EU\n\nmembership, the EU itself having concluded the Convention in 2015 and thus being a\n\nContracting Party. UK participation will therefore cease on Exit.\n\nAs explained in the Government's ˜Providing a cross-border civil judicial\n\ncooperation framework “ A future partnership paper' (August, 2017), the UK\n\nremains committed to continuing to participate in the 2005 Hague Convention after\n\nthe UK leaves the EU.\n\nThis SI is required as part of the UK's overall preparations to achieve full independent\n\ncontracting party status to the 2005 Hague Convention after we leave the EU and to\n\nensure an effectively functioning statute book. It will underpin the UK's future ability\n\nto meet its international treaty obligations by ensuring the smooth continuation of\n\nexisting domestic implementing legislation relating to this Convention, on and after\n\nexit day.\n\nThis SI will ensure that the rules of the 2005 Hague Convention on the recognition of\n\nexclusive choice of court agreements can work effectively between the UK and all the existing contracting parties to this Convention including the EU, Denmark,\n\nMontenegro, Mexico and Singapore. It will also ensure that the UK can operate the\n\n2005 Hague Convention with any future contracting parties to this Convention.\n\nThis Statutory Instrument (SI) has been made under the European Union (Withdrawal)\n\nAct 2018 to ensure that the UK statute book is ready, on Exit, to comply with The\n\nHague Convention of 23 November 2007 on the International Recovery of Child\n\nSupport and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (the 2007 Hague Convention).\n\nThe UK and EU have agreed that during the implementation period, the UK is to be\n\ntreated as a Member State for the purposes of international agreements, including the\n\n2007 Hague Convention. This Statutory Instrument therefore would only apply in\n\nthe unlikely event that the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU is not concluded.\n\nThe UK currently participates in the 2007 Hague Convention by virtue of EU\n\nmembership, the EU itself having concluded the Convention in 2014 and thus being a\n\nContracting Party. UK participation will therefore cease on Exit.\n\nAs explained in the Government's ˜Providing a cross-border civil judicial\n\ncooperation framework “ A future partnership paper' (August 2017), the UK remains\n\ncommitted to continuing to participate in the 2007 Hague Convention after the UK\n\nleaves the EU. This SI is required as part of the UK's overall preparations to achieve full independent\n\ncontracting party status to the 2007 Hague Convention after we leave the EU and to\n\nensure an effectively functioning statute book. It will underpin the UK's future ability\n\nto meet its international treaty obligations by ensuring the smooth continuation of\n\nexisting domestic implementing legislation relating to this Convention, on and after\n\nexit day.This SI will ensure that the rules of the 2007 Hague Convention on the recognition\n\nand enforcement of cross-border maintenance decisions (including for child\n\nmaintenance) can work effectively between the UK and all the existing contracting\n\nparties to this Convention including the EU, USA, Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine\n\namongst others. It will also ensure that the UK can operate the 2007 Hague\n\nConvention with any future contracting parties to this Convention.\n\nThe Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (S.I.\n\n2018/634) ( the 2018 Regulations ) implement the EU Package Travel Directive\n\n(2015/2302) ( the Directive ). The 2018 Regulations protect consumers buying\n\npackage holidays or linked travel arrangements (LTAs) and impose obligations on the\n\norganisers of package holidays ( organisers ) and traders which facilitate LTAs\n\n( traders ): the degree of protection is greater in the case of packages. Those\n\nprotections include the provision of information to travellers, so that travellers have\n\nclear information about their package holiday or LTA and their statutory rights, as\n\nwell as a requirement that organisers put in place adequate insolvency protection to\n\ncover, in the event of the organiser's or trader's insolvency, the refund of payments\n\nmade by or on behalf of passengers and, if necessary, their repatriation. The 2018 Regulations are being changed to make them to work effectively, for the\n\nprotection of travellers, after exit. In particular the changes are made because, on EU\n\nexit, the UK, as it ceases to be a Member State to which the Directive applies, will no\n\nlonger benefit from the mutual recognition provisions of the Directive. In\n\nconsequence, the remaining Member States will no longer be required to recognise\n\nthe insolvency protection put in place under the 2018 Regulations by UK organisers /\n\ntraders (requiring them to comply, potentially, with multiple regulatory regimes) and\n\nit is also unclear whether the insolvency protection put in place by organisers / traders\n\nestablished in the remaining EU states will continue to protect UK travellers. As a\n\nresult, the Department does not consider it appropriate to continue to recognise the\n\ninsolvency protection put in place by traders established in remaining Member States.\n\nThe three Statutory Instruments (SIs) on the safety of organs, tissues and cells, and\n\nreproductive cells (gametes and embryos) for treating patients are ˜no deal' SIs. They\n\nhave been developed as part of contingency planning and will be needed in the event\n\nthat the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union (EU) in March 2019 with\n\nno agreement in place; i.e. a ˜no deal' scenario.\n\nWithdrawal from the EU without a deal would mean that the law in this area will no\n\nlonger work as it is intended to. This is because it contains a number of references\n\nthat will no longer be appropriate, such as references to obligations that the UK is\n\nrequired to comply with as an EU Member State. Additionally, as the UK and EU\n\nMember States will consider each other to be third countries, amendments have been\n\nmade to reflect this.\n\nThe SIs are being made under powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\n\n(referred to here as the EU (Withdrawal) Act). There are three separate SIs:\n\n¢ the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) (Amendment)\n\n(EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Tissues and Cells SI';\n\n¢ Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations\n\n2019 “ referred to here as the ˜HFE SI'; and\n\n¢ the Quality and Safety of Organs Intended for Transplantation (Amendment)\n\n(EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Organs SI'.\n\nThe SIs are being made on a UK-wide basis. The Tissues and Cells and Organs SIs\n\nare being made with the agreement of each of the Devolved Administrations (DAs)\n\nand the HFE SI is reserved to Westminster.\n\nThe SIs have been drafted separately as each amends different underlying legislation.\n\nThe purpose of the SIs is to ensure that, in the unlikely scenario that the UK leaves the\n\nEU with no deal, the law in this area will still function properly and the UK regulatory\n\nframework for the safety and quality of organs and tissues and cells (including\n\nreproductive cells) is maintained.\n\nIt is proposed that these SIs should be grouped and debated together.\n\nThe three Statutory Instruments (SIs) on the safety of organs, tissues and cells, and reproductive cells (gametes and embryos) for treating patients are ˜no deal' SIs. They have been developed as part of contingency planning and will be needed in the event that the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union (EU) in March 2019 with no agreement in place; i.e. a ˜no deal' scenario. Withdrawal from the EU without a deal would mean that the law in this area will no longer work as it is intended to. This is because it contains a number of references that will no longer be appropriate, such as references to obligations that the UK is required to comply with as an EU Member State. Additionally, as the UK and EU Member States will consider each other to be third countries, amendments have been made to reflect this. The SIs are being made under powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (referred to here as the EU (Withdrawal) Act). There are three separate SIs: ¢ the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Tissues and Cells SI'; ¢ Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜HFE SI'; and ¢ the Quality and Safety of Organs Intended for Transplantation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Organs SI'. The SIs are being made on a UK-wide basis. The Tissues and Cells and Organs SIs are being made with the agreement of each of the Devolved Administrations (DAs) and the HFE SI is reserved to Westminster. The SIs have been drafted separately as each amends different underlying legislation. The purpose of the SIs is to ensure that, in the unlikely scenario that the UK leaves the EU with no deal, the law in this area will still function properly and the UK regulatory framework for the safety and quality of organs and tissues and cells (including reproductive cells) is maintained. It is proposed that these SIs should be grouped and debated together.\n\nThese Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) to (d)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of cross-border insolvency. These Regulations also contain minor amendments to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and to employment legislation in Northern Ireland bringing that legislation into line with EU law. These amendments are made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 21) ( the ECA ) and come into force on the day after these Regulations are made.\n\nThe EU Regulation on insolvency proceedings ((EU) 2015/848) ( the EUIR ) determines in which member State main insolvency proceedings may be opened and provides that decisions opening proceedings are to be recognised in other member States. Main proceedings may only be opened in the state where the centre of the debtor's main interests, or COMI, is located. Secondary proceedings may be brought in a state where the debtor has an establishment. The EUIR makes other provisions to facilitate the operation of cross-border insolvency proceedings including for co-operation between courts and insolvency practitioners.\n\nThese Regulations address the deficiencies that will arise from the absence of mutual application of the EUIR. It is not appropriate to continue to apply the EUIR unilaterally in respect of EU proceedings when member States will not apply the Regulation to UK proceedings. There is however a saving and transitional provision in regulations 4 and 5 which continues to apply the EUIR, the previous EU insolvency regulation and the associated domestic law where main proceedings have been opened before exit day. The court may decide not to apply these Regulations in the circumstances set out in regulation 5.\n\nThe three Statutory Instruments (SIs) on the safety of organs, tissues and cells, and reproductive cells (gametes and embryos) for treating patients are ˜no deal' SIs. They have been developed as part of contingency planning and will be needed in the event that the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union (EU) in March 2019 with no agreement in place; i.e. a ˜no deal' scenario. Withdrawal from the EU without a deal would mean that the law in this area will no longer work as it is intended to. This is because it contains a number of references that will no longer be appropriate, such as references to obligations that the UK is required to comply with as an EU Member State. Additionally, as the UK and EU Member States will consider each other to be third countries, amendments have been made to reflect this. The SIs are being made under powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (referred to here as the EU (Withdrawal) Act). There are three separate SIs: ¢ the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Tissues and Cells SI'; ¢ Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜HFE SI'; and ¢ the Quality and Safety of Organs Intended for Transplantation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 “ referred to here as the ˜Organs SI'. The SIs are being made on a UK-wide basis. The Tissues and Cells and Organs SIs are being made with the agreement of each of the Devolved Administrations (DAs) and the HFE SI is reserved to Westminster. The SIs have been drafted separately as each amends different underlying legislation. The purpose of the SIs is to ensure that, in the unlikely scenario that the UK leaves the EU with no deal, the law in this area will still function properly and the UK regulatory framework for the safety and quality of organs and tissues and cells (including reproductive cells) is maintained. It is proposed that these SIs should be grouped and debated together.\n\nIn the event of a disorderly ( ˜No Deal') exit from the European Union, the UK would not have an agreement in place to continue participating in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The UK would therefore leave the EU ETS on exit day, making the existing legislation inoperable. The instrument revokes certain provisions that will cease to apply on exit day and amends others so that they will continue to be operable after exit day. This will ensure legal certainty for existing UK participants to the EU ETS in the event of a 'No Deal' exit from the EU. No substantive policy changes have been made in this instrument (this is in line with the powers of section 8 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018). The instrument maintains, and makes technical fixes to, the elements which will continue to be operable, namely the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of greenhouse gas emissions. As well as ensuring transparency over greenhouse gas emissions, MRV will also provide information to allow the implementation of HM Treasury's ˜Carbon Emissions Tax' (announced in the 2018 Autumn Budget). The Tax will temporarily replace the lost EU ETS carbon price in a 'No Deal' scenario, maintaining a carbon pricing policy for industry in an interim period (i.e. from exit day until a long-term alternative is established). However, the substance of this interim carbon pricing policy will be included in a power under the Finance Bill 2018-19, which will be debated by Parliament separately, and does not form part of this instrument. The interim policy is without prejudice to any final decision on the UK's future approach to carbon pricing; the UK is considering a range of options, including continuing to participate in the EU ETS, a UK ETS (linked or standalone) or a carbon tax.\n\nThis instrument is being made in order to address deficiencies in retained EU law in\n\nrelation to public procurement arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom\n\n(UK) from the European Union (EU), ensuring the legislation continues to operate\n\neffectively after the UK leaves the EU. The EU legal framework for the regulation of public procurement by public\n\nauthorities and utilities consists of a package of directives (the EU Procurement\n\nDirectives) that govern procedures for the award of public contracts over specified\n\nfinancial thresholds to suppliers of works, goods and services. They are aimed at\n\nensuring that the EU public procurement market is open and competitive and that\n\nsuppliers are treated equally and fairly.\n\nThe EU Procurement Directives were implemented for England, Wales and Northern\n\nIreland by the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Utilities Contracts Regulations\n\n2016 and the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 (the Regulations).\n\nThis instrument also relates to certain directly applicable EU legislation in the field of\n\npublic procurement, such as Regulation 2195/2002 on the Common Procurement\n\nVocabulary that aims to standardise the references used by contracting authorities and\n\nentities to describe procurement contracts. This instrument addresses deficiencies in retained EU law that arise as a result of the\n\nwithdrawal of the UK from the EU. It amends or removes provisions that are\n\ninoperable, inappropriate or would otherwise prevent the legislation from functioning\n\neffectively after exit day within the meaning of section 8 of European Union\n\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018. For example, provisions that relate to the publication of\n\nnotices in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) and to the submission of reports to\n\nthe European Commission (the Commission) would no longer be appropriate because\n\nthey impose requirements and confer functions in respect of EU entities that no longer\n\nhave such functions in relation to the UK after exit. These have been removed or\n\nreplaced with provisions that relate to the functions of ˜domestic' bodies and entities.\n\nThis instrument transfers a series of legislative functions that are currently conferred\n\nby European Union ( EU ) legislation upon the European Commission ( the\n\nCommission ), to be exercisable instead by public authorities in the United Kingdom\n\n( UK ), so that they can be exercised at national level after the UK leaves the EU. The EU Regulations concerned cover persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ); timber;\n\nthe European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register; transfrontier shipments of\n\nwaste; the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable\n\nsharing of benefits; mercury; leghold traps; and the Convention on the International\n\nTrade in Endangered Species ( CITES ). This instrument also concerns one\n\nlegislative function contained in a Directive relating to industrial emissions. In each case, the legislative function is conferred upon the Commission so that it can\n\ndevelop the technical details of the specific regime, without the frequent need to refer\n\nback to the EU Council and EU Parliament. Examples of these functions include\n\nspecifying forms to be used, amending technical annexes to reflect advances in\n\nscientific and technical knowledge, and updating annexes to reflect international\n\nagreements. This instrument does not make changes to substantive policy content. It provides for\n\nthe legislative function in each case to be exercisable by the appropriate UK authority.\n\nThis is to ensure that the regimes continue to function smoothly, without the need for\n\nprimary legislation every time a change in technical matters is required. The regimes will continue to function in a similar way to how they did previously.\n\nThis instrument changes the identity of the bodies carrying out the specified functions\n\nand converts the EU procedures to UK procedures as appropriate.\n\nThis instrument provides for a series of legislative functions that are currently\n\nconferred by European Union ( EU ) legislation upon the European Commission\n\n( the Commission ) to be exercisable instead by public authorities in the United\n\nKingdom ( UK ), so that they can be exercised at national level after the UK leaves\n\nthe EU. The EU Regulations concerned cover animal health and welfare. The powers were\n\nprovided to the European Commission through directly applicable European\n\nRegulations agreed with the member states. In each case, the legislative function is\n\nconferred upon the Commission so that it can develop the technical details of the\n\nspecific regime, without the frequent need to refer back to the EU Council and\n\nParliament. Examples of these functions include specifying forms to be used and\n\namending technical annexes. This instrument does not make changes to substantive policy content. It provides for\n\nthe legislative function in each case to be exercisable by UK authorities. This is to\n\nensure that the regimes continue to function smoothly, without the need for primary\n\nlegislation every time a change to technical matters is required. Without establishing\n\npowers we would be unable to bring forward measures which the European\n\nCommission currently has authority to do on behalf of member states. The regimes will continue to function in a similar way to how they did previously.\n\nThis instrument changes the identity of the bodies carrying out the specified functions\n\nand converts the EU procedures to UK procedures as appropriate.\n\nThis instrument provides for a number of legislative functions that are currently\n\nconferred by European Union ( EU ) legislation upon the European Commission\n\n( the Commission ) to be exercisable instead by public authorities in the United\n\nKingdom ( UK ), so that they can be exercised at national level after the UK leaves\n\nthe EU. The EU Directives concerned cover aquatic animal health and plant health. The\n\npowers were conferred on the European Commission by Council Directive\n\n2006/88/EC on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products\n\nthereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (OJ\n\nNo. L 328, 24.11. 2006) ( Directive 2006/88/EC ) and Council Directive 2000/29/EC\n\non protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms\n\nharmful to plants or plant products and against their spread in the Community (OJ No.\n\nL 169, 10.7.2000, p.1) ( Directive 2000/29/EC ). The legislative functions were\n\nconferred upon the Commission to enable it to develop the technical details of the\n\nspecific regimes, without the frequent need to refer back to the EU Council and\n\nParliament. Examples of these functions include amending technical annexes\n\ncontaining diseases and pests. This instrument does not make changes to substantive policy content. It provides for\n\nthe legislative function in each case to be exercisable by UK authorities. This is to\n\nensure that the relevant regimes continue to function smoothly and can be updated to\n\nreflect changes in disease and pest risks. This instrument confers functions on UK authorities which are equivalent to various\n\nlegislative functions exercisable by the European Commission in relation to EU\n\naquatic animal health and plant health legislation and converts the EU procedures to\n\nappropriate UK procedures.\n\nThis statutory instrument corrects deficiencies in the Railway (Licensing of Railway\n\nUndertakings) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005/3050) ( 2005 Regulations ) arising from\n\nthe UK's exit from the European Union. It will also revoke Regulation (EU) 2015/171\n\nwhich will become redundant after exit day. It is being made to ensure that the 2005\n\nRegulations continue to operate effectively in the event of the UK leaving the\n\nEuropean Union without an agreed deal with the EU. After exit day the 2005 Regulations will not be able to operate effectively unless the\n\nreferences they contain to Europe and European Union institutions are corrected.\n\nMost of the deficiencies that need to be corrected are minor and technical. The most\n\nsignificant change is to rename the European licence  “ it will in future be known as\n\nthe railway undertaking licence . Other changes are mostly to remove references and\n\nobligations to provide information to European Union institutions, such as the\n\nEuropean Railway Agency. Regulation (EU) 2015/171 will become redundant after exit day either because the\n\nprocedures it sets out have already been adopted into the UK licensing regime or\n\nbecause they will no longer be relevant after the UK leaves the EU (e.g. providing\n\ninformation to the European Commission). It is therefore being revoked. This instrument will enable the legal framework for train operator licensing in Great\n\nBritain provided for in the 2005 Regulations to continue after exit day. Operators that\n\nhold licences issued by the ORR will not need to take any action. Operator licences do\n\nnot expire, so these licences will continue to be valid in GB indefinitely. However,\n\nORR issued licences will no longer be valid in EEA Member States after exit day.\n\nAny operators who intend to operate in an EEA Member State would have to apply\n\nfor a licence from a licensing authority in an EEA Member State. Operators that\n\nprovide train services in Great Britain and hold a licence issued by an EEA Member\n\nState other than the ORR will not need to take any immediate action. The instrument\n\nprovides for those licences to continue to be recognised in Great Britain for two years\n\nafter exit day. At the end of that two-year period any affected operators will require a\n\nlicence issued by the ORR to continue to operate legally in Great Britain (there is currently only one such operator, Europorte Channel SAS, a freight operator). This\n\nposition was set out in a rail technical notice issued in October. No other requirements of the licensing regime under the 2005 Regulations will be\n\nchanged.\n\nThis instrument does not provide for the long-term, mutual recognition of operator\n\nlicences issued by EEA-member states and held by cross-border service operators\n\n(e.g. services which operate through the Channel Tunnel). Mutual recognition of these\n\nlicences is contingent on any future bilateral agreements with Member States. The UK\n\nGovernment is engaging with a range of European counterparts, including member\n\nstates, to discuss cross-border services once the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThe General Food Law (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 ( the\n\ninstrument ) amends Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 which provides the basic\n\nprinciples underpinning food safety. The instrument also amends Regulation No.\n\n931/2011, that implements Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, in order that it can be\n\nretained in an operable form after EU Exit.\n\nThis instrument also revokes Regulation (EU) No. 16/2011 which concerns EU\n\nMember State responsibilities under the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed\n\n( RASFF ); unless negotiated otherwise the UK will not retain access to that system\n\npost Exit.\n\nFinally, the instrument makes minor amendments to ensure continued operability of\n\ndomestic enforcing regulations in England, the Food Safety and Hygiene (England)\n\nRegulations 2013 ( 2013 Regulations ).\n\nThe instrument designates responsibilities currently incumbent on the European Food\n\nSafety Authority ( EFSA , the body that provides scientific advice on food to the\n\nEuropean Commission, the European Parliament and EU Member States) to the ˜Food\n\nSafety Authority' (i.e. the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) in England, Wales,\n\nNorthern Ireland, and Food Standards Scotland ( FSS ) or other devolved\n\nadministration organisations able to take up this role subject to further agreement) and\n\ndesignates responsibilities incumbent on the European Commission to Ministers in the\n\nfour UK countries.\n\nThis instrument amends the 2013 Regulations to ensure they are operable after EU\n\nexit, so that Schedule 1 of those regulations gives effect to amendments to the\n\nAnnexes of retained EU instruments listed in that schedule and also to ensure that the\n\nlegislative references of specific provisions in its Schedule 2 are suitably updated.\n\nAs a responsible government, we will continue to proportionately prepare to ensure\n\nreadiness on exit day in all scenarios. The purpose of this instrument therefore, is to\n\nensure that there will continue to be a functioning statute book on exit day which\n\nmaintains continuity in relation to General Food Law policy and legislation.\n\nThis instrument will correct deficiencies arising from the UK's withdrawal from the\n\nEU and guarantee legal operability; without operability amendment and restatement\n\nof the Regulations policy absurdity would occur due to the references to the EU State\n\naid regime and process. This instrument will do no more than is appropriate in\n\nensuring that deficiencies are corrected upon leaving the EU, and where appropriate,\n\nthat retained EU law is stated in a clearer and more accessible way.\n\nThis instrument complements the State Aid (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 Statutory\n\nInstrument ( the State Aid Framework SI ) laid by the Department for Business,\n\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The State Aid Framework SI will stand up the\n\ndomestic regime and amend deficiencies in retained EU law including the General\n\nBlock Exemption Regulation (No 651/2014) and the General De Minimis Regulation\n\n(No 1407/2013). It also transfers monitoring and reporting functions from the\n\nEuropean Commission to a UK domestic regulator “ the Competition and Markets\n\nAuthority (CMA).\n\nThis instrument ensures that the current agricultural, fisheries and CAP exemptions\n\nfrom the EU State aid regime are operable. It corrects deficient references throughout\n\nthe amended Regulations to, for example, the Commission, Member States, and the\n\ninternal market. For example, in Article 5 of Agricultural Block Exemption\n\nRegulation, references to Commission Notices are being replaced with references to\n\nCMA statements of policy. The instrument transfers a number of minor Commission\n\nfunctions to the domestic regulator. For example, when the UK has exceeded its\n\nannual State aid budget, certain categories are then only exempted from State aid rules\n\nfor a 6 month period. The instrument gives the CMA the power to extend this 6 month\n\nperiod. The instrument also makes minor amendments to other CAP legislation in the\n\narea of State aid. This is to ensure that these State aid clauses, which ensure the proper\n\noperation of funding arrangements under the retained CAP Regulations, continue to\n\noperate effectively after EU Exit.\n\nThese Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a) and (g) of section 8(2))\n\narising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. They amend the Road Vehicles and Non-Road Mobile Machinery (Type-Approval) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/648) ( the principal Regulations ) to ”\n\n” vary the period during which the increase in permitted production limits for National Small Series Type Approval provided for by the principal Regulations applies. This is necessary due to the change in exit day from the original 29th March 2019. (See regulation 2(a).)\n\n” replace the multiplication factor applied to the figures in Table 1 of Regulation 25 of the Road Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/717) by the principal Regulations relating to vehicle categories M1 and N1 with a limit of 1000 vehicles. (See regulation 2(a).) The multiplication factor applied to figures relating to all other vehicle categories remains as provided for by the Principal Regulations.\n\n” revoke Regulation (EU) 2019/26 (which makes provision in EU legislation for the United Kingdom ™s withdrawal from the European Union) and make transitional provision in respect of that revocation. (See regulation 2(b).)\n\nThe net costs imposed on business, the voluntary sector and the public sector by these Regulations have been assessed as being less than £5m in any year and therefore a full impact assessment has not been prepared.\n\nThe purpose of this instrument is to make technical operability changes under Section 8\n\nof the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ( the Withdrawal Act ) to existing EU\n\nlegislation. Relevant EU legislation delegates to the EU Commission the legislative\n\npower to add, vary or remove a country from lists of approved third countries. This\n\ninstrument makes these legislative powers that are contained within EU Directives\n\noperable upon EU withdrawal and allows the UK to align with the EU and approve\n\nthird countries for the purpose of animal and product imports.\n\nThis instrument supports the UK ™s application to be listed as a third country by the EU\n\nfor live animals and animal products. The UK ™s application was approved by the EU in\n\nApril 2019 as having met the minimum requirements at that time. Given the change in\n\nexit day to 31st October 2019, we are using this opportunity to ensure we are as\n\nprepared as we can be to support all possible requirements of listing.\n\nIn transferring EU Commission powers to approve third countries for the purpose of\n\nanimal and product imports, this will ensure the UK could adapt its own list of\n\napproved countries to retain its EU listing, should the long-term situation change after\n\nexit day. It will also allow for the longer-term removal of third countries from our\n\napproval list, should their biosecurity risk change significantly after exiting the EU,\n\nsupporting our existing powers to exercise import controls.\n\nParts 2 and 3 of this instrument transfer these delegated legislative powers from the\n\nCommission to the Secretary of State if consent is given by the Welsh Ministers in\n\nrelation to Wales, the Scottish Ministers in relation to Scotland, and the Department of\n\nAgriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs ( DAERA ) in relation to Northern Ireland\n\nfollowing their involvement in an assessment of the suitability of a third country to be\n\napproved to export such goods and animals into the United Kingdom.\n\nParts 4 and 5 of this instrument also makes further operability amendments to a\n\npreviously made EU exit statutory instrument, and into domestic regulations in England\n\nand Northern Ireland relating to the trade in animals and animal products. No policy\n\nchanges are being introduced by these amendments, which are technical in nature.\n\nHowever, the Secretary of State with the consent of devolved appropriate authorities\n\nmay publish lists of those animals and products that require or are exempted from\n\nborder veterinary checks.\n\nPart 6 makes an amendment to correct a cross-reference to the Veterinary Surgeons and\n\nAnimal Welfare (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 ( ˜the Veterinary Surgeons\n\nInstrument ™).\n\nThis instrument amends: the Marketing of Vegetable Plant Material Regulations 1995\n\n( the 1995 Regulations ); the Seeds (National Lists of Varieties) Regulations 2001\n\n( the 2001 Regulations ); and the Seed Marketing Regulations 2011 ( the 2011\n\nRegulations ).\n\nThis instrument is required to ensure that the United Kingdom fulfils its obligations\n\nunder the Withdrawal Agreement to transpose EU law into domestic legislation until\n\nthe end of the Implementation Period (31st December 2020). We are therefore\n\ntransposing Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/990 amending the list of\n\ngenera and species in Article 2(1)(b) of Council Directive 2002/55/EC, in Annex II to\n\nCouncil Directive 2008/72/EC and in the Annex to Commission Directive 93/61/EEC\n\n( the 2019 Directive ).We are also transposing Commission Implementing Directive\n\n(EU) 2020/432 amending Council Directive 2002/55/EC with regard to the definition\n\nof vegetables and the list of genera and species in Article 2(1)(b) ( the 2020\n\nDirective ). The 2020 Directive rectifies an error made by the 2019 Directive, by reinstating the definition of vegetables in Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of\n\nvegetable seed.\n\nThis instrument changes the common names of certain vegetable species in\n\naccordance with the grouping used in the International Code of Nomenclature for\n\nCultivated Plants. It also brings hybrids between the species and groups listed into the\n\nscope of the 2011 Regulations. The changes aim to provide greater clarity for\n\nbusinesses in terms of the species covered by the scope of the regulations amended by this instrument. This instrument also brings into line the species Cichorium intybus L (Chicory) with\n\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/478. This Commission Implementing\n\nDecision releases certain Member States from the obligation to apply Directive\n\n2002/55/EC to certain species. This instrument therefore extends the derogation from\n\nthe requirement to provide a national list and restrict marketing in the 2001\n\nRegulations, to the entire species.\n\nThis draft Statutory Instrument supersedes the draft of the same title which was laid before Parliament on 13 May 2020.\n\nThis instrument amends deficiencies in Commission Implementing Decision (EU)\n\n2019/1372 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the\n\nCouncil of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the\n\nEuropean Community (INSPIRE) which established a European spatial data\n\ninfrastructure ( SDI ). Directive 2007/2/EC requires Member States to operate\n\nnational SDIs. Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372 replaced\n\nCommission Decision 2009/442/EC. Commission Implementing Decision (EU)\n\n2019/1372 simplifies arrangements for monitoring the use of the SDI and reporting on\n\nthe cost, benefits and governance of implementation. This instrument also makes consequential amendments to the INSPIRE (Amendment)\n\n(EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1338). This will ensure that amendments made\n\nto the UK INSPIRE Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3157) which incorporated the\n\nINSPIRE Directive into UK law covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nreflect the new Commission Decision and will be operable after the UK exits the EU.\n\n2.3 This instrument makes similar consequential amendments to the INSPIRE (EU Exit)\n\n(Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 103/2019), at the request of the\n\nScottish Government. This instrument also makes consequential amendments to The Environment\n\n(Legislative Functions from Directives) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 1350/2019 which\n\nare necessary as a result of the replacement of Commission Decision 2009/442/EC by\n\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372. These amendments are made to\n\nensure that the regulation making power in The Environment (Legislative Functions\n\nfrom Directives) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 1350/2019 can be used as necessary to\n\namend Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372. These amendments are being made to enable the continued operability of the\n\nINSPIRE legislative architecture as retained EU law under the European Union\n\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018, following the UK ™s withdrawal from the EU. The INSPIRE\n\nDirective was implemented in England and Wales and Northern Ireland by INSPIRE\n\nRegulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3157), and in Scotland by INSPIRE (Scotland)\n\nRegulations 2009 (S.S.I. 2009/440).\n\nThe Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement ( the Protocol ) requires that the EU legislation listed in Annex 2 to that Protocol is implemented in Northern Ireland. Annex 2 includes Directive 2014/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of simple pressure vessels (OJ L 96, 29.3.201, p, 45) ( the SPV Directive ); it also includes Directive 2014/68/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pressure equipment (OJ L 189, 27.6.201, p. 164) ( the PE Directive ).\n\nThe SPV Directive was implemented on a UK wide basis by the Simple Pressure Vessels (Safety) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1092) ( SPV Regulations ). The PE Directive was similarly implemented on a UK wide basis by the Pressure Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1105) ( the PE Regulations ). Both of these sets of Regulations have been amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/696) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union but those amendments prospectively (with effect from IP completion day) only extend to England and Wales and Scotland.\n\nThese Regulations amend the SPV and PE Regulations in respect of Northern Ireland only to make sure that the SPV and PE Directives and the Protocol are implemented in respect of Northern Ireland.\n\nThis instrument is required to ensure that the UK continues to have a functioning\n\nstatute book in force at the end of the transition period. Some, but not all, references\n\nto exit day  will be replaced by IP completion day  in: the Railways (Interoperability) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019; the Connecting Europe Facility (Revocation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019; the Train Driving Licences and Certificates (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 ( the TDL Regulations ); the Railways (Safety, Access, Management and Interoperability) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 ( Second\n\nSafety Regulations ) and the Cableway Installations (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. These changes are necessary because these instruments were made prior to exit day,\n\nand were due to come into force from that date onwards. As a result of the UK and\n\nthe EU agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement, the UK has entered the transition period\n\nas part of its withdrawal from the EU which is why some references to exit day  are\n\nno longer appropriate and need to be replaced by references to IP completion day . This instrument amends the TDL Regulations and Second Safety Regulations to\n\nensure that all EU train driving licences, Part A safety certificates and single safety\n\ncertificates (issued pursuant to Directive 2004/49/EC2\n\non the safety on the\n\nCommunity ™s railways and Directive (EU) 2016/7983\n\non railway safety (recast)\n\nrespectively) are recognised for use in Great Britain up to 31st January 2022. It\n\namends the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006\n\nand the Rail Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, to ensure that,\n\nwhere appropriate, the legislative framework takes account of EU documentation\n\nissued under Directive (EU) 2016/798 and makes further provision to ensure the\n\nrecognition of Entities in Charge of Maintenance (ECM) certificates issued pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) No 445/20114\n\nand Commission Implementing\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/7795 which replaces the former during the transition period.\n\nThese amendments also take account of any certificates issued in respect of crossborder services pursuant to the retained EU law version of that Regulation after IP\n\ncompletion day. Finally, this instrument revokes Regulation (EU) No 913/20106\n\nconcerning a\n\nEuropean Rail Network for Competitive Freight and revokes Commission\n\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2019/779 laying down detailed provisions on a system\n\nof certification of ECM, except in relation to vehicles operating a cross-border\n\nservice.\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ( the Withdrawal Act ) converts and\n\npreserves EU law at the end of the transition period between the UK and the EU into\n\ndomestic law ( retained EU law ). If retained EU law relating to the Common\n\nAgricultural Policy ( CAP ) was not amended, it would contain inoperable rules that\n\nwould prevent the UK government and the Devolved Administrations from being able\n\nto deliver agricultural and market support schemes currently run under the CAP to the\n\nagricultural sector. This instrument uses powers in the Withdrawal Act to correct\n\nthese deficiencies. The EU Exit SIs being amended would not have the right effect as\n\nthey would not reflect the change in the legislative position following the Withdrawal\n\nAgreement between the UK and the EU, the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative\n\nContinuity) Act 2020 and amendments which have been made to EU Regulations\n\nsince the EU Exit SIs were made. In relation to public intervention and private\n\nstorage aid, the amendments made by the EU Exit SIs would have the wrong effect\n\noperationally if not amended. This instrument makes a number of changes: Firstly, this instrument makes provision to clarify the position of certain EU\n\nRegulations which were incorporated into domestic law with effect from exit\n\nday insofar as relating to direct payments and incorporated with effect from\n\nthe end of the transition period ( IP completion day ) for remaining purposes,\n\nand amends or revokes a number of earlier EU Exit SIs to\n\nreflect that those SIs will not apply in relation to direct payments following the\n\nwithdrawal agreement and the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative\n\nContinuity) Act 2020 and regulations made under it. Secondly, this instrument makes some limited amendments to previous EU\n\nExit SIs where retained EU law is affected by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Thirdly, this instrument makes amendments to previous EU Exit SIs to ensure\n\nUK paying agencies are able to continue complying with EU rules for the\n\npurposes of Article 138 of the Withdrawal Agreement. Fourthly, this instrument amends previous rural development EU Exit SIs,\n\nwhich were made before a Withdrawal Agreement was signed between the\n\nUK and the EU, and which now consequently need to be updated to reflect the new position; a small number of additional amendments are made in order to\n\nensure rural development rules continue to function effectively at the end of\n\nthe transition period. Fifthly, this instrument makes amendments to earlier EU Exit SIs that set rules\n\nfor Public Intervention ( PI ) and Private Storage Aid ( PSA ) schemes set out in the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets ( CMO ) regime.\n\nThese amendments will ensure provisions relating to the setting of prices for the intervention tendering process can be run administratively, which is in\n\nkeeping with domestic processes and will allow relevant authorities to mirror the current system of administering PI and PSA as closely as possible at the\n\nend of the transition period, to ensure producers and operators do not experience any change in how the schemes are run immediately after the end\n\nof the transition period. Sixthly, this instrument makes a small number of minor drafting amendments to update drafting and correct errors and oversights in earlier EU Exit SIs, for\n\nexample missed cross-references that needed amending and substituting a reference to Pounds Sterling for a reference to Euro. Seventhly, this instrument amends retained EU law concerning producer\n\ngroups, producer organisations, notifications in the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors, and notifications of agricultural market\n\ninformation to domestic authorities. These amendments should be read in conjunction with The Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural\n\nProducts (Producer Organisations and Wine) (Amendment Etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which also make operability corrections to Commission\n\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/891 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2017/892.\n\nThe EU Exit SIs and EU regulations amended by this instrument are: the Common Agricultural Policy (Financing, Management and Monitoring)\n\n(Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/763); the Common Agricultural Policy (Financing, Management and Monitoring Supplementary Provisions) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit)\n\nRegulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/765); the Agriculture (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I.\n\n2019/748); the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Organisation of the Markets in\n\nAgricultural Products (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations\n\n2019 (S.I. 2019/1405); the Common Agricultural Policy and Agriculture and Horticulture\n\nDevelopment Board (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/733); the Rural Development (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I.\n\n2019/764); the Rural Development (Rules and Decisions) (Amendment) (EU Exit)\n\nRegulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/770); the European Structural Investment Funds (Common Provisions)\n\n(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/785); the Market Measures Payment Schemes (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations\n\n2019 (S.I. 2019/823); the Agriculture (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019\n\n(S.I. 2019/831); the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019\n\n(S.I. 2019/1402); the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products and\n\nCommon Agricultural Policy (Miscellaneous Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) (No.2) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1422); Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 laying down\n\ndetailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in respect of the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors; Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors and supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European\n\nParliament and of the Council with regard to penalties to be applied in those sectors and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011; Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/892 concerning producer\n\ngroups, producer organisations and notifications in the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors; and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1185 relating to\n\nnotifications of agricultural market information to domestic authorities. The EU Exit SIs revoked by this instrument are: the Common Agricultural Policy (Direct Payments to Farmers) (Amendment)\n\n(EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/207); the Common Agricultural Policy (Rules for Direct Payments) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/208); regulation 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy and Market Measures (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/812); and part 4 of the Food and Farming (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/759).\n\nThese Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The SI substantially replaces provision made in S.I. 2019/1343, the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products (Producer Organisations and Wine) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, the scrutiny period for which expired on 7 January 2020 without the instrument having been approved.\n\nPart 2 of these Regulations makes amendments to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 880/2012 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/232 concerning transnational cooperation.\n\nIt also amends provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council in relation to protected geographical indications, protected designations of origin and traditional terms in the wine sector.\n\nIt also makes amendments to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/892 concerning producer organisations and notifications in the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors.\n\nPart 3 amends the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products and Common Agricultural Policy (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to replace a reference to exit day with IP completion day, to provide more detail on the appeal mechanism, and to revoke a provision which is replaced by this instrument.\n\nPart 4 revokes certain implementing acts relating to EU wine designations of origin, geographical indications, and traditional terms.\n\nThe purpose of this instrument is to ensure that the UK statute book works coherently\n\nand effectively following the end of the transition period.\n\nIt clarifies how certain terms, including EU-related definitions, should be interpreted\n\nin domestic legislation on or after IP completion day. As part of this, the instrument\n\nclarifies how cross references to EU legislation should be read.\n\nThe instrument makes technical repeals to redundant provisions within primary\n\nlegislation arising from the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ( EUWA ).\n\nThese are primarily repeals of amending provisions, in particular relating to the\n\nEuropean Communities Act 1972 ( the ECA ), where EUWA has already provided\n\nfor the repeal of the amended provisions. The purpose of the repeals in these\n\nRegulations is to tidy up the statute book and they have no substantive effect.\n\nThe instrument amends the Interpretation Act 1978 (and the devolved equivalents) in\n\nrelation to the interpretation of references to relevant separation agreement law .\n\nThe instrument also amends EUWA to provide for how existing references to EU\n\ninstruments that form part of relevant separation agreement law and how existing nonambulatory references to direct EU legislation should be read. It also makes\n\nconsequential amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\n\n(Consequential Modifications and Repeals and Revocations) (EU Exit) Regulations\n\n20191\n\n(S.I. 2019/628) ( the 2019 Regulations ) and the Financial Services and\n\nMarkets Act 2000 (Qualifying EU Provisions) Order 2013.\n\nThe instrument makes new interpretation provisions in light of the European Union\n\n(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (WAA), to remove uncertainty about which\n\nversion of an EU instrument applies, whether the retained version or the version\n\napplied by the Withdrawal Agreement. The instrument provides a general gloss to\n\nensure that the correct interpretation of the EU instrument applies. SIs being prepared\n\nby other departments in order to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, including the\n\nNorthern Ireland Protocol are relying on these glosses. These SIs are required for IP\n\ncompletion day.\n\nThese Regulations amend the Road Vehicles and Non-Road Mobile Machinery (Type-Approval) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/648) ( the 2019 Regulations ). These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 8(1) and 8C of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, and to give effect to the United Kingdom ™s obligations under the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland to the EU withdrawal agreement ( the Protocol ).\n\nThe 2019 Regulations made temporary amendments to legislation in the field of type approval for road vehicles and non-road mobile machinery and, in particular, provide for an interim arrangement allowing the Secretary of State, or Northern Ireland Department, to issue type approval certificates to holders of EU type approval granted other than in the United Kingdom and (in respect of road vehicles) for those type approval certificates to be the basis for the issue of certificates of conformity used for the purposes of vehicle registration. These interim arrangements are to have effect for a period of two years.\n\nThese Regulations amend the interim arrangements, following the inclusion of the relevant EU Type Approval legislation in Annex 2 to the Protocol, so that they continue to operate effectively Great Britain and also to allow vehicles which are qualifying Northern Ireland goods to be registered in Great Britain.\n\nThe 2019 Regulations are also amended to allow various engines, components and technical units within scope of the type approval legislation to be entered into service or placed on the market in Great Britain if they comply with the relevant legislative requirements as they apply in member States or Northern Ireland. These arrangements will also have effect for a period of two years.\n\nThese Regulations also make necessary consequential amendments to other related legislation.\n\nThese Regulations also amend Commission Regulation (EU) 1230/2012 of 12 December 2012 implementing Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to type-approval requirements for masses and dimensions of motor vehicles and their trailers (OJ L. No 353 21.12.20012, p.31). This amendment is to allow for the type approval in Great Britain of vehicles within scope of that Regulation which have a height exceeding 4 metres.\n\nThese Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 8(1), 8B(1) and (2) and 23(1) and (2) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) ( the Withdrawal Act ), and section 41(1) and (5) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1). Chapter 9 of Part 2 of these Regulations (extradition) is also made in part in reliance on various powers in the Extradition Act 2003 (c. 41).\n\nPart 2 of these Regulations amends the Law Enforcement and Security (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/742) ( the law enforcement regulations ), and Part 3 amends the Criminal Justice (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/780) ( the criminal justice regulations ). These instruments were the means by which amendment was made to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and to make savings and transitional provision in respect of certain law enforcement matters and procedures which had begun but not been completed before the end of the transitional period.\n\nThe purpose of these Regulations is to amend the law enforcement regulations and the criminal justice regulations in light of Title V and, in so far as it relates to police and judicial cooperation, Title VII of Part 3 of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community ( the withdrawal agreement ). Title V makes provisions in respect of ongoing police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, relating to certain EU instruments for law enforcement cooperation and information exchange. Title VII makes provision in respect of data and information processed or obtained before the end of the transition period or in relation to ongoing proceedings under the withdrawal agreement. Similar provisions are made in Title III and Title IV of Part 3 of the Agreement on arrangements between Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the EEA Agreement and other agreements applicable between the United Kingdom and the EEA EFTA States by virtue of the United Kingdom ™s membership of the European Union ( the EEA EFTA separation agreement ) . These provisions are referred to in both agreements as other separation issues .\n\nGenerally, the other separation issues preserve the application of particular EU measures in respect of any matters or procedures begun (but not completed) before the end of the transition period. In addition, they preserve the applicable law on personal data and confidential treatment and restricted use of data and information, in respect of data and information stocks accrued or exchanged in relation to those transitional cases. By virtue of sections 7A and 7C of the Withdrawal Act, rights, powers, obligations, remedies etc as they arise or are created from time to time in the withdrawal agreement are given legal effect in the legal system of the United Kingdom (and sections 7B and 7C make similar provision in relation to the EEA EFTA separation agreement).\n\nAdditionally, these Regulations make further provision to address deficiencies in retained EU law (in particular under section 8(2)(a) to (d) and (g) of the Withdrawal Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, in relation to EU law in the law enforcement and security sphere that has come into force since the law enforcement regulations were made, or where further deficiencies in existing retained EU law have been identified.\n\nThis instrument will ensure that retained European Union (EU) legislation and\n\ndomestic implementing legislation relating to the protection of animals at the time of\n\ntheir killing, during transport and the criteria for animals being kept in control posts;\n\nthe use of leghold traps, the import of pelts and manufactured goods of certain wild\n\nanimal species; and the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of\n\ninvasive non-native species remains operable now that we have left the EU. The\n\nproposed changes will ensure that the strict protections that are in place are\n\nmaintained by addressing failures of EU law to operate effectively, as well as other\n\ndeficiencies, arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.\n\nThis instrument includes provisions related to EU Exit for Great Britain and Northern\n\nIreland, as well as changes to domestic enforcement legislation for the United\n\nKingdom. Changes to retained EU legislation (EU legislation preserved in UK law for\n\nlegal continuity after EU Exit) and domestic (UK developed) legislation are being\n\nmade in order to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol of the Agreement on the\n\nwithdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the\n\nEuropean Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the Withdrawal\n\nAgreement). Furthermore, the changes ensure that imports of pelts and pelt products\n\nfrom the EU will be treated the same as imports from any other third country. This\n\nchange is in line with wider government policy regarding the United Kingdom™s exit\n\nfrom the EU.\n\nThis instrument also includes provisions to improve enforcement, which will enable\n\nenforcement officers to use discretion when transferring seized specimens to\n\nappropriate facilities, ensure the civil sanction provisions work as intended, and\n\nenable the effective implementation of emergency measures under domestic\n\nlegislation for invasive non-native species.\n\nThis Statutory Instrument supersedes the draft of the same title which was laid before Parliament on 8 October 2020.\n\nThe purpose of this instrument is to ensure that the UK statute book works coherently\n\nand effectively following the end of the transition period.\n\nIt clarifies how certain terms, including EU-related definitions, should be interpreted\n\nin domestic legislation on or after IP completion day. As part of this, the instrument\n\nclarifies how cross references to EU legislation should be read.\n\nThe instrument makes technical repeals to redundant provisions within primary\n\nlegislation arising from the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA).\n\nThese are primarily repeals of amending provisions, in particular relating to the\n\nEuropean Communities Act 1972 (the ECA), where EUWA has already provided\n\nfor the repeal of the amended provisions. The purpose of the repeals in these\n\nRegulations is to tidy up the statute book and they have no substantive effect.\n\nThe instrument amends the Interpretation Act 1978 (and the devolved equivalents) in\n\nrelation to the interpretation of references to relevant separation agreement law.\n\nThe instrument also amends EUWA to provide for how existing references to EU\n\ninstruments that form part of relevant separation agreement law and how existing nonambulatory references to direct EU legislation should be read. It also makes\n\nconsequential amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\n\n(Consequential Modifications and Repeals and Revocations) (EU Exit) Regulations\n\n20191\n\n(S.I. 2019/628) (the 2019 Regulations).\n\nThe instrument makes new interpretation provisions in light of the European Union\n\n(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (WAA), to remove uncertainty about which\n\nversion of an EU instrument applies, whether the retained version or the version\n\napplied by the Withdrawal Agreement. The instrument provides a general gloss to\n\nensure that the correct interpretation of the EU instrument applies. SIs being prepared\n\nby other departments in order to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, including the\n\nNorthern Ireland Protocol are relying on these glosses. These SIs are required for IP\n\ncompletion day.\n\nThe purpose of this instrument is to ensure that legislation relating to animal and\n\naquatic health, invasive alien species, plant propagating material and seeds remains\n\noperable following the Withdrawal Agreement, the Protocol on Ireland / Northern\n\nIreland (the Protocol), and recent updates to EU law. The amendments in this\n\ninstrument are technical in nature with no changes to policy. The amendments made by this instrument will address deficiencies in domestic\n\nlegislation including previously made EU Exit legislation, e.g. by removing\n\nreferences to EU institutions that are no longer appropriate; removing obligations to\n\nreport to, or seek approval from, the European Commission; and removing provisions\n\nrelating to reciprocal arrangements and provisions that will no longer exist or operate\n\nfollowing the end of the transition period.\n\nIn addition, the instrument will: amend retained EU law; replace references to the EU™s Trade Control and Export System (TRACES)\n\nwith references to the UK™s new system for import notifications and controls, the Imports of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System (IPAFFS); remove transitional measures which expire at the end of the Transition Period; make operability changes to recent amendments to EU law that were settled in the EU too late to be covered by the earlier EU Exit legislation; make reference to the special transitional import arrangements set out in Schedule 5 to the England Trade Regulations or equivalent provisions in the Wales Trade Regulations or the Scotland Trade Regulations, and the new Annex 6 to the Official Controls Regulation (EU) 2017/625; apply a reciprocal approach to the EU, in particular so that EU breed societies are subject to the same recognition and listing process as third country breeding bodies by the UK as the EU is applying to UK breed societies post Transition Period. This is subject to a six month transitional period during which EU breed societies will be automatically listed by the UK; make a few very minor corrections to drafting errors in earlier EU Exit SIs; and make minor amendments to domestic legislation using section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in order to ensure regimes can be made operable at the end of the Transition Period.\n\nThe purpose of this instrument is to amend the table at paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of\n\nthe Energy Information Regulations 2011 (the 2011 Regulations). This table lists\n\nthe EU energy labelling measures that currently have effect, and that can therefore be\n\nenforced by the UK market surveillance authorities (MSAs) under the 2011\n\nRegulations. This instrument adds to the table new energy labelling measures coming\n\ninto force from 1 November 2020 pursuant to Commission Delegated Regulations\n\nmade under the EU Energy Labelling Framework Regulation (EU) 2017/1369. Transitional provisions in most of the new Commission Delegated Regulations came\n\ninto force on the 25 December 2019 to allow manufacturers to make the product\n\ninformation sheet available through the EU product database (EPREL), but the\n\nsubstantive provisions relating to the design of the labels and the information they\n\nprovide come into force on 1 November 2020 or 1 March 2021. This instrument will provide MSAs with the legal basis to enforce new energy\n\nlabelling requirements for: household washer-dryers, household washing machines,\n\nhousehold dishwashers, household refrigerating appliances and electronic displays. This instrument will not be in force by the 1 November 2020, and so there will be an\n\nenforcement gap of a few weeks. However, as products take many months to go\n\nthrough product design, testing and distribution, and energy labels are prepared well\n\nin advance of sale, the risk that companies may take advantage of this temporary lack\n\nof enforcement is very low.\n\nArticle 18 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union makes provision for consent to be provided by the Northern Ireland Assembly to the continued application of Articles 5 to 10 of that Protocol. Consent must be given every 4 or 8 years depending whether it is given on a simple majority or cross-community basis.\n\nThese Regulations make provision for that democratic consent process. They do so by inserting a new Schedule 6A in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c. 47). Part 3 of that Schedule makes provision for the process that will apply in circumstances where there is a functioning Northern Ireland Executive. Part 4 makes provision for the process that will apply in circumstances where there is not a functioning Executive in place. This is consistent with the undertaking made by the United Kingdom Government in its declaration concerning the operation of the Democratic consent in Northern Ireland provision of the Protocol made on 17 October 2019 (unilateral Declaration).\n\nWhere consent is given on a simple majority rather than cross-community basis, then Part 6 of new Schedule 6A requires the Secretary of State to commission an independent review into the functioning of the Protocol and the implications of any decision to continue or terminate alignment on social, economic and political life in Northern Ireland. Again, this is consistent with the undertakings made by the Government in the unilateral Declaration."
