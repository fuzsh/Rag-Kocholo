        "text": "What’s in today’s article?\n\nWhy in news?\n\nWhat is National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR)?\n\nWhat is Indian Railways Institute of Disaster Management (IRIDM)?\n\nWhat is Commissioner of Railway Safety?\n\nNews Summary: Railway officers to be trained in disaster management\n\nReasons behind this step\n\nWhy in news?\n\nThe Ministry of Railways has made training in disaster management mandatory for railway officers.\n\nThe National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR), Vadodara, and the Indian Railway Institute of Disaster Management (IRIDM), Bengaluru, would work together in imparting the comprehensive training programme.\n\nNational Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR)\n\nNAIR is a training institute for Indian Railways (IR) officers.\n\nIt was established in 1930 as the Railway Staff College and moved to its current location in Vadodara, Gujarat in 1952.\n\nRecently, the Railway Board has ordered NAIR to hand over all its assets, including buildings and other infrastructural facilities, to the Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV).\n\nGSV is a central university in Vadodara, Gujarat, India.\n\nIt was established in 2018 as the National Rail and Transportation Institute (NRTI) and upgraded to a central university in 2022.\n\nThe university is sponsored by the Ministry of Railways and is mandated to work across railways, shipping, ports, highways, roads, waterways, and aviation.\n\nIndian Railways Institute of Disaster Management (IRIDM)\n\nIRIDM is a national institute in Bengaluru that offers disaster management courses and training.\n\nIRIDM envisioned in High Level Committee (HLC) on Disaster Management in Indian Railways, was Commissioned in the year 2019.\n\nIn the year 2021, it was brought under Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical & Electrical Engineers (IRIMEE), Jamalpur, a century old Centralized Training Institute.\n\nCommissioner of Railway Safety (CRS)\n\nAbout\n\nCRS is a statutory body. It is headed by the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety.\n\nIt deals with matters related to safety of rail travel and operations, as laid down in the Railways Act, 1989.\n\nInvestigating serious train accidents is one of the key responsibilities of the CRS. The commission also makes recommendations to the government.\n\nHeadquarters: Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAdministrative control\n\nThe CRS does not report to the Ministry of Railways of the Railway Board.\n\nIt is, in fact, under the administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).\n\nThe reason is to keep the CRS insulated from the influence of the country’s railway establishment and prevent conflicts of interest.\n\nNews Summary: Railway officers to be trained in disaster management\n\nReasons behind this step\n\nInvestigation into the Odisha train tragedy highlighted the need of faster disaster response\n\nThe move comes after investigation into the devastating Odisha train tragedy that the disaster response could have been faster.\n\nIn June 2023, three trains collided in Balasore district in Odisha which left about 290 passengers dead and scores injured.\n\nIn the recent floods in southern districts of Tamil Nadu, a Superfast Express was stopped at Srivaikuntam railway stations after the railway track got breached a few hundreds of metres ahead.\n\nThe first help arrived several hours later after the Indian Air Force helicopters hovered over the railway station and dropped food packets.\n\nThe report of the Commissioner of Railway Safety\n\nMore emphasis on disaster management was laid following the report of the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Eastern Circle.\n\nAs per this report, Railway Board should review the system of disaster response in the Zonal Railways.\n\nReliance on the State administration and Central agencies for relief and rescue operations\n\nThe railways have Accident Relief Trains stationed at major junctions across the railway network with adequate manpower and equipment to reach accident sites or any scene of disturbance.\n\nHowever, the focus would be more on restoring rail traffic.\n\nThe railways rely more on the State administration and Central agencies for relief and rescue operations.\n\nQ1) What is National Rail and Transportation Institute (NRTI)?\n\nThe National Rail and Transportation Institute (NRTI) is a central university in Vadodara, Gujarat, India. It was established in 2018 and is now known as Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV).\n\nQ2) What is the function of Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA)?\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) is responsible for developing and regulating national policies and programs for civil aviation in India. The MoCA also regulates air transport services within, to, and from India.\n\nSource: Railway officers to be trained in disaster management | NAIR | IRDIM\n\nRailway officers to be trained in disaster management"
