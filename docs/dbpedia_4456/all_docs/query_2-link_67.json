        "text": "Now operating as Transport Life & Leisure (TL&L), the Railway Institute was established in 1891 to provide for the education and welfare of railway workers in NSW.\n\nIn recent times the Institute has become a member benefits service, providing Life and Leisure activities at discounted rates for members. Though the TL&L still has a focus to support rail Transport workers, membership is open to the general public. So anyone can become a member and enjoy the benefits.\n\nThe New South Wales Railway Institute affectionately known as “the Institute”, was initially established to provide a higher standard of educational learning for NSW railway employees. As well as employment related training, the Institute was tasked with stimulating growth and intellectual development of employees in the arts, social, leisure, and physical recreations.\n\nThe NSW Railway Institute was formally opened on the 14th March 1891 and at the time was the only institution of its kind in the Commonwealth. Subsequently other Institutes were founded in Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania.\n\nIn the late 1980’s Institute turned its attention to improving and developing better social, lifestyle, leisure and sporting pursuits for members with the purchase of a holiday cabin which was to be made affordable for members to rent while on holidays. Over the next ten years more and more cabins were purchased with member subscriptions and placed in beach caravan parks along the NSW coast.\n\nA member card program offering discounts to hotels, motels, restaurants, and family attractions was introduced in 1997.\n\nOn 24 December 1998 the Institute was devolved from the State Rail Authority and was registered under the Incorporations Act as the “NSW Railway Institute Inc.”, a not for profit social club.\n\nThe Institute, as a not-for-profit organisation, prides itself on offering cost effective quality services and benefits to all of its members.\n\nThe Institute actively facilitates, promotes and encourages members to realise healthy lifestyles by interacting and engaging in social and competitive sport and leisure activities."
