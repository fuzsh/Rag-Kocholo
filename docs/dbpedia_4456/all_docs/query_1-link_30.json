        "text": "KRRI Applies Digital Block Augmented Reality to Railcar Maintenance Training\n\n- Digital block augmented reality demonstration for digital transformation of the railroad industry - UIWANG, South Korea – JUNE 26 – The Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI) (President: Dr. Seok-Youn Han) held a demonstration for the pilot operation of 'Digital Block Augmented Reality (AR)' developed in collaboration with Busan Transportation Corporation (President: Byung-jin Lee) for maintenance and training of rail vehicle operators at Busan Transportation Corporation on June 25. Digital block augmented reality technology is a digital transformation technology that provides all information of railway products such as mutual compatibility, disassembly, combination, and integration during the development, production, and utilization of railway products. KRRI has been developing the 'Platform for Railway Digital Engineering and Digital Block (TRain Open Software Architecture, hereinafter referred to as TROSAR Platform)' as a national research and development project since 2021 for the digital transformation of the railway industry. Through this demonstration, the applicability and effectiveness of the TROSAR Platform at the rail vehicle operation site were confirmed. In addition, they plan to discuss the utilization of the reviewed AR content and detailed application plans. KRRI and Busan Transportation Corporation plan to pilot the developed railway virtual environment technology (Trosar CyberSpace) in a training program to foster rail vehicle maintenance experts. “The application of railway virtual environment technology will accelerate the digital transformation of the domestic railway industry from the development to production, utilization, and maintenance of railway products,” said KRRI researcher Jung-geun Oh, who leads the research. Byung-jin Lee, President of Busan Transportation Corporation, said, “At a time when it is necessary to foster rail vehicle maintenance experts who can respond to advanced future technologies, the development of digital block augmented reality technology will be of great help to railway operating institutions, including Busan Transportation Corporation, which is promoting digital transformation.” “We will continue to work with KRRI to develop augmented reality content that can be directly applied to the field.” President Seok-youn Han of KRRI said, “The railroad industry is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, and digital transformation, which requires huge investment, is difficult, and the industry is in dire need of help from the government and public institutions.” “We plan to expand the development and application of TROSAR Platform technology that enables small and medium-sized enterprises to easily achieve digital transformation at minimal cost using their own technologies.” References: 1.

More than 50 transportation experts from 13 Asian countries, including government officials from Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Georgia, Laos, Maldives, and Azerbaijan, as well as international organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Transport Forum (ITF), and companies attended the seminar. The participants shared examples of inclusive transportation policies in Asian countries for socially disadvantaged groups such as the disabled, the elderly, pregnant women, infants and children, and discussed standards and measures for promoting inclusive transportation policies in Asian countries in the future, including available transportation and ICT technologies. KRRI introduced the S-BRT (Super Bus Rapid Transit) transportation technology that can be used for inclusive transportation policies. Dr. Jun Lee, head of KRRI's Railroad Policy Research Department, proposed S-BRT technology that improves punctuality and transportation capacity by separating high quality and large capacity bus from general vehicles, and the use of low-floor bus vehicles that improve the convenience of the transportation vulnerable through horizontal boarding and disembarking. “The transportation infrastructure that has developed with urbanization has provided various opportunities and economic enrichment to members of society, but the distribution has not been fair to all,” said Weimin Ren, Director of UNESCAP's Transportation Division. ”For the sustainable development of society, it is important for Member States to work together to promote inclusive transportation policies that provide equal mobility opportunities for various members of society.” “Transportation infrastructure has played an important role in the rapid development of Korea's economy, and in recent years, Korea has been making great efforts to build transportation infrastructure that is inclusive of the socially disadvantaged,” said Yong-jang Kwon, director of the Innovative Transportation and Logistics Research Center of the Korea Railroad Research Institute, adding, ”Let's work together to build transportation infrastructure for the sustainable development of society and expand KRRI's cooperation in various public transportation technologies.” ※ Attachment: Photos from the seminar Press Contacts Yoonju YI Korea Railroad Research Institute yjyi@krri.re.kr +82 31 460 5189"
