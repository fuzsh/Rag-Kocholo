        "text": "Broadly speaking, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management consists of three sections: policy, implementation and inspection. In addition, the ministry has several support agencies to ensure that the top political and civil service layers as well as the employees are able to perform their work.\n\nThe Secretary-General is the ministry’s top administrative official and provides direct leadership to the directors general, inspector general and heads of directorates who report directly to him.\n\nThe Secretary-General is Jan Hendrik Dronkers and the Deputy is Marc Konings.\n\nIn the policy section, four Directorates-General are concerned with developing policy in the areas of mobility, water management, aviation and maritime affairs and the environment. The Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat, RWS) ensures that policy is implemented. Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) oversees compliance with statutory regulations by private individuals and companies. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) gathers information on the weather, climate and seismology and performs research. The Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management, Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT), the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and the KNMI are agencies of the ministry.\n\nDirectorate-General for Aviation and Maritime Affairs\n\nThe Directorate-General for Aviation and Maritime Affairs is responsible for policy development in the fields of:\n\nmaritime affairs;\n\naviation.\n\nThe Directorate-General for Aviation and Maritime Affairs is headed by Director-General Ruth Clabbers.\n\nDirectorate-General for the Environment and International Affairs\n\nThe Directorate-General for the Environment and International Affairs is responsible for policy development in the fields of:\n\na clean, safe, healthy and sustainable human environment;\n\nair quality;\n\ncircular economy;\n\nsustainability;\n\nenvironmental security and environmental risks.\n\nFuthermore the Directorate-General coordinates the international component of the ministries policy.\n\nThe Directorate-General for the Environment and International Affairs is headed by Director-General Afke van Rijn.\n\nDirectorate-General for Mobility\n\nThe Directorate-General for Mobility is responsible for policy development in the fields of:\n\nroads;\n\nroad safety;\n\npublic transport and railways;\n\nbicycle traffic;\n\nsustainable mobility.\n\nThe Directorate-General for Mobility is headed by Director-General Kees van der Burg.\n\nDirectorate-General for Water and Soil Affairs\n\nThe Directorate-General for Water and Soil Affairs is responsible for policy development in the fields of:\n\nwater policy and flood risk management;\n\nclimate adaptation;\n\nwater projects in specific areas;\n\nwater and soil issues.\n\nThe Directorate-General for Water and Soil Affairs is headed by Director-General Jaap Slootmaker.\n\nRijkswaterstaat\n\nRijkswaterstaat is the executive organization of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. Rijkswaterstaat manages, maintains and develops the three major infrastructure networks of our country: the main road network, the main waterway network and the main water system.\n\nMore than 10,000 Rijkswaterstaat employees are working across the country to make the Netherlands accessible, safe and liveable. From one of the seven regional organizational units or one of the seven nationally operating organisations, they work daily on the implementation of Rijkswaterstaat's core tasks:\n\na sustainable living environment;\n\nflood protection;\n\nsufficient and clean water for all water users;\n\nsmooth and safe road and water traffic;\n\nreliable and useful information and data.\n\nImportant actual focal points in the organizational development in this are working on a climate-proof Netherlands and working on the major replacement and renovation task for the main infrastructure of our country with professional asset management.\n\nRijkswaterstaat is managed by deputy director-general Patricia Zorko.\n\nHuman Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT)\n\nThe Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) ensures compliance with statutory regulations pertaining to sustainability and physical safety.\n\nThe ILT is organised into seven inspectorate domains, which adopt an integrated approach in their supervision wherever possible. This reduces the burden of supervision and facilitates collaboration with other inspectorates and enforcement organisations. The inspectorate strives for an unequivocal supervisory relationship with its supervisees, increased collaboration with other inspectorates and a risk-oriented supervision policy based on trust and aimed at a reduction of supervision and administrative burdens.\n\nSavings are achieved in eliminating duplications as a result of the merger and in reducing the number of executive and support functions. In the primary process, the inspectorate sets course for new supervision formats (digital inspections, system supervisions in case of diligent compliance), which render the inspections less labour-intensive and keep the level of compliance up to par. The simplifications in legislation and regulations and the decentralisation of responsibilities will also affect the staff capacity and deployment of the inspectorate. In this, central government confines itself to upholding state interests.\n\nThe inspectorate is led by Inspector-General Mattheus Wassenaar.\n\nNetherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL)\n\nThe Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) is the national institute for strategic policy analysis on environment, nature, and spatial planning issues of national and international significance. The agency contributes to political and administrative decision-making by conducting outlook studies, analyses and evaluations that take an integrated approach. Policy relevance is the prime focus in all studies, which are commissioned by the Ministry, other national bodies, and international agencies. These studies investigate current environmental, nature and spatial quality, and identify and explore future social trends and evaluate potential policy options.\n\nPBL is headed by Director Mr. J.T. Mommaas.\n\nFor more information, see: www.pbl.nl/en/\n\nRoyal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI)\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute is the national institute for weather, the climate and seismology. The KNMI provides weather information in the areas of safety, the economy and a sustainable environment to the public, the government, the aviation sector and the shipping industry. In addition, the KNMI performs research into climate change and earthquakes and related phenomena.\n\nThis combination of infrastructure, technology, science and service provision is unique in the field of weather, the climate and seismology. At the global level, the KNMI works in close collaboration with other institutions and research institutes.\n\nThe major task of the KNMI is to make available the knowledge, data and information it has at its disposal. From its central weather room in De Bilt, the institute provides weather forecasts and warnings 24-hours a day. The KNMI delivers meteorological data and provides services on location especially for Schiphol national airport and Rotterdam Airport.\n\nThe climate research the KNMI performs is focused on observing, understanding and predicting changes in the climate system. The choice of research subjects is based on national and international climate research and on questions submitted by the government and civil society.\n\nThe KNMI is an agency of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. The duties of the institute are set forth in the KNMI Act.\n\nThe Managing Director is Dr. Maarten van Aalst.\n\nKnowledge, Innovation and Strategy\n\nKnowledge, innovation and strategy are important themes for Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management in which additional resources will be expressly invested in the years ahead. I&W has a Knowledge, Innovation and Strategy Agenda.\n\nStrategy Department\n\nStrategy Department is a small, high-quality unit supporting the Secretary-General as the knowledge, innovation and strategy portfolio holder for I&W.\n\nNetherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM)\n\nThe Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM) performs research in the area of mobility. Through exploratory studies and policy analyses, the institute lays the basis for the mobility policy. The institute’s products are independent of policy-based and political steering. The policy Directorates-General of I&W and the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) are involved in drawing up the research programme of the KiM.\n\nThe Director is Mr H.L. Stipdonk.\n\nAdministrative and Legal Affairs Department (HBJZ)\n\nThe Administrative and Legal Affairs Department (HBJZ) contributes, in its role as ‘policy partner’, to the realization of the policy objectives of the Ministry. The department concerns itself with legislation, legal and administrative advice, covenants, agreements and basis for decisions and conducts legal proceedings. HBJZ connects the various topics which fall within the scope of the Ministry from a legal perspective. HBJZ is responsible for legal quality assurance for the whole of the Ministry and also functions as a guardian of the principles of proper governance and the rule of law. HBJZ acts as an advisor for its colleagues from the implementation and inspection departments, and is working, through a network with other Ministries, on the further development of national policies on (the quality of) legislation. On an international level, HBJZ cooperates with its partners in other member states on developments in European legislative policies (Better Regulation). HBJZ is headed by its managing director, Ms G.M. ter Huurne."
