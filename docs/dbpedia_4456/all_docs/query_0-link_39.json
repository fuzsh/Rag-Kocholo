        "text": "The study &quot;Towards a Single and Innovative European Transport System&quot; is developing action plans for the establishment of an integrated transport system in Europe. This report was created in a joint effort between VDI/VDE Innovation + Technik GmbH (Germany), Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy (Germany) and the Centre of Research and Technology Hellas, CERTH (Greece) on behalf of the European Commission&#39;s DG MOVE. Focus of the report is the international assessment of six different countries - Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, USA - in five focus areas across all transportation modes. It provides actions plans on how to overcome existing European barriers towards a single and innovative European Transport System based on best practices and lessons learned in the countries under study. In addition to the actions plans, the study also provides recommendations for international collaboration.\n\nThe reliance on private parties is a global tendency in modern regulation. One peculiar regulatory technique which foresees a core role for private parties is that of European standardization. The employment of standards for regulatory purposes delivers enormous benefits for the harmonization process and is today a key factor in the EU's trade policy; however, the process of European standardization raises a number of concerns from a rule of law perspective, which are linked to 'hybrid nature' of the process, which foresees an intertwined public and private decision-making process. The aim of this contribution is to discuss the role of public law in the process of European standardization. After discussing the legal nature of European harmonized standards, the current application and potential applicability of general principles of administrative law is discussed and the necessity and availability of judicial control is examined.\n\n1 The literature on this topic is extensive. Without any claim to exhaustiveness, see, for example, Franklin Edward Powell, Some Aspects of Standardization and Economic Theory (Catholic University of America 1947); H Landis Gabel, Product Standardization and Competitive Strategy (Elsevier Science 1987); H Landis Gabel, Competitive Strategies for Product Standards: The Strategic Use of Compatibility Standards for Competitive Advantage (McGraw-Hill 1991); Peter Grindley, Standards, Strategy, and Policy: Cases and Stories (Oxford University Press 1995); Carmen Matutes and Pierre Regibeau, ‘A Selective Review of the Economics of Standardization. Entry Deterrence, Technological Progress and International Competition’ (1996) European Journal of Political Economy 12(2): 183–209.
