        "text": "Abstracts Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a high impact on income and revenue generation to various countries in developing and developed countries. Some countries via their companies used FDI and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) to advanced and control flow of investment to their mother countries. Similarly, global pattern of foreign direct investment has shifted from developed countries to developing countries with more inflow to countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Despite domination of FDI by triangle of trade (TRIAD) countries of America, European Union, Japan and United Kingdom as countries with higher inflow of foreign direct investments. Consequently, most of the countries among BRICS and TRIADS uses Tax haven for tax evasion and manipulations. Capital flight is another advantage used by United States of America to have more FDI due to power of its currency. Within last decade a significant shift FDI to developing countries has indicates change in global pattern in FDI. African countries suffer more from capital flight due to lax custom and border regulation and laws.\n\nJust published: Karl P. Sauvant, Padma Mallampally and Geraldine McAllister, eds., Inward and Outward FDI Country Profiles (New York: VCC, 2013), 2nd edition. This second edition (available free of charge as an ebook from VCC's website, at http://www.vcc.columbia.edu/books ) contains 77 standardized country profiles dealing with the inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) performance of 40 economies. The profiles were peer-reviewed by a global network of experts. The publication is intended to contribute to the analysis of FDI trends and policy issues related to them. More specifically, the individual profiles discuss FDI trends and developments (country-level developments, the corporate players); effects of the recent global crises; and the regulatory and policy scene. Each profile also contains a standard set of tables, including on FDI stocks and flows, sectoral and geographical FDI distributions, the largest M&As and greenfield investments, the principal foreign affiliates (for inward FDI), and the principal multinational enterprises (for outward FDI). The standardized template used to produce the profiles allows cross-country comparisons. The volume is meant to be a reference tool for anyone interested in foreign direct investment.\n\nThe paper is divided into two major parts, i.e, FDI inflows and FDI outflows along with subdivisions of sector wise and country wise analysis of FDI flows. The section on foreign investment flows gives an overall picture of the total invests inflows into India as well as investment outflows by India. The core objective of the paper is to: - Analyze the FDI inflows into India in country wise and sector wise from 2000 to 2012. - Analyze the FDI outflows from India in country wise and sector wise categories. - Analyze the policy constraints for FDI inflows to India. - Make suggestions for promoting FDI inflows and thereby adequate supply of capital for domestic industries in India.\n\nThis second edition of this publication provides an overview of important contemporary issues relating to foreign direct investment (FDI) and multinational enterprises for all those who are interested in this subject, but are not always in a position to follow diverse perspectives and what is being written in the various corners of this field. The contributions are grouped under the following headings: attracting FDI and its impact; the rise of emerging market investors; national policies; sustainable international investment; and international investment treaties and arbitration. The volume brings together all Perspectives published since the inception of this series until 2012.\n\nForeign Direct Investment, FDI, is often, it is argued, one of the ways developing economies have to develop faster and catch up with developed economies, from which most of the FDI activities come from. There are complications, however, and FDI can have various unforeseen and even unfavourable consequences for the economy. As such, it is vitally important for policy makers to understand those limitations and potential effects of FDI, especially in the context of sustainable economic development: FDI is a double-edged sword that must be handled with care. The following paper offers an introduction to the literature of the subject with some thoughts of the author regarding some of the potential consequences of FDI. Special emphasis is on four aspects: FDI and economic growth, FDI and other capital flows, FDI and the balance of payments and FDI and financial stability.\n\nThe types of investment that are made abroad are known as foreign and have majorly affected countries that engage in these activities of business. The various factors which are to be considered such as-political factor, social factor and economical factor as these factors affect the allocation of international capital. This research paper will examine and analyze the literature review which is focusing on movement of capital under foreign direct investment. Existence of a positive effect on the economy of a country that is injected with these substitutes has led to a better performance of the overall GDP and increase in national output. The same is related to economic growth. It is argued that the study based upon verified documents involves all the countries irrespective of their geographical area whereas the fact is that many of them are concerned with largest recipients of foreign direct investment such as-Asian and Latin American countries."
