        "text": "The Fourth Railway Package is a set of six legislative texts designed to finalize the establishment of the Single European Railway Area. Since 2001, the Eu-ropean Commission has enacted a series of «Railway Packages» with the aim of enabling privately owned train operators to access the European rail market on a competitive basis. The separation of train operators and infrastructure managers is often considered to be a prerequisite for the authentic competition in passenger rail operations. However, the latest step in the EU legislative process, the Fourth Railway Package, does not make the final leap of requiring full separation between train operators and infrastructure managers. Moreover, the Government of the UK, which has one of the most liberalized rail markets in Europe, has announced the possible combination of train operations and infrastructure management known as «vertical integration». The paper will deal with these problematic issues, even focusing on comparative experiences in different Member States. SOMMARIO: 1. The long path to EU railway liberalization.-2. Modes of competing in the railway sector and governance structure of railway operators.-3. The Court of Justice and its jurisprudence on the structure of governance.-4. The new provisions in the Fourth Package: a compromise solution.-5. The predictable effects of the Fourth Package.-6. The separation of infrastructure manager and service providers: suggestions from different experience in other network markets."
