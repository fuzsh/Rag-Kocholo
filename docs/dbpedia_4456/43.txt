Testing of electronic equipment for railway and subway use

Sicom Testing it is a recognized point of reference for companies that operate, or are emerging, in the train and subway sectors. The laboratory is qualified by RINA for carrying out tests on signaling, communication and control systems in the railway sector and for carrying out environmental tests according to the standard EN 50155.

Sicom Testing assists companies that develop projects in the railway sector and that want to achieve full compliance with the European directive 2008/57/CE relating to the interoperability of the community railway system,

Italy has implemented this rule with the D.lgs-n. 191/2010 and through standards EIRENE.

Railway GSM testing

The laboratory carries out tests on cellular communication systems used in the railway sector, including in band GSM-R for voice and data transmission.

In the years, Sicom Testing has developed special tests with simulation of radio communication for speeds up to 500 km/h with which numerous products intended for high-speed railway vehicles have been tested.

The service is dedicated to manufacturers, distributors and importers of electronic and communication devices installed on board railway vehicles, tram vehicles, high-speed trains and subways.
