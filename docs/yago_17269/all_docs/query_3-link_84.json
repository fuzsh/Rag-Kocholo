        "text": "Seven highly anticipated Chinese films, including projects from renowned directors Wuershan, Guan Hu, and Feng Xiaogang, were unveiled at a special event during the 26th Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF) on June 17.\n\nFilmmakers pose for a group photo at a special event to promote the \"Chinese Epic Showcase\" initiative during the 26th Shanghai International Film Festival in Shanghai, June 17, 2024. [Photo courtesy of SIFF Organizing Committee]\n\nThe \"Chinese Epic Showcase,\" co-hosted by Alibaba Pictures and the SIFF Organizing Committee, marked the 10th anniversary of their partnership. The two parties announced a mission-driven initiative to unite Chinese filmmakers in a bid to drive the high-quality development of the country's cinema industry. Numerous industry insiders, filmmakers, and company representatives attended the event.\n\n\"I believe that, with the collective efforts of many filmmakers, Chinese cinema will usher in an even more brilliant tomorrow. Every effort of the filmmakers will be respected, every story will be remembered, and every emotion will be conveyed,\" said Fu Ruoqing, chairman of China Film Group Corporation.\n\nLi Jie, president of Alibaba Pictures, announced the launch of the \"Chinese Epic\" co-production plan during the event, pledging the company's unwavering commitment to the initiative. \"We hope to collaborate with Chinese film creators to unlock the potential of the 'Chinese Epic' and elevate the Chinese film industry to new heights,\" Li said.\n\nThe \"Chinese Epic\" initiative will prioritize quality, industrialization, and grand-scale production in film development, focusing on four key themes: individual destinies, national sentiments, humanistic concerns, and contemporary resonance, according to the announcement.\n\nOne notable example is \"Dongji Island,\" which has been in development for four years and is set to begin filming on June 24. The film, starring Zhu Yilong and Wu Lei, tells the true story of courageous Chinese fishermen who rescued British prisoners of war held by the Japanese army during the sinking of the Lisbon Maru in World War II. The production's scale and complexity present unprecedented challenges in Chinese film history, featuring set replicas on a real island location, actual sea filming, and a full-scale reconstruction of the Lisbon Maru. Director Guan Hu described the scale of the production as \"equivalent to the volume of three big movies.\"\n\nFollowing the success of \"Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms\" last year, director Wuershan is set to release his new fantasy action epic \"Under One Person\" on July 26. Wuershan described the film as \"urban mythology and contemporary wuxia,\" blending Chinese traditional style with a supernatural world.\n\nOther highly anticipated films showcased at the event include Xu Zheng's realistically-themed \"Upstream,\" set for release on Aug. 9, which focuses on the stories of delivery workers. Anthony Pun's \"City in Flames,\" starring Andy Lau, delves into the complex interplay of natural disasters and human calamity, and is the first Chinese film to address radiation disaster themes, according to veteran producer Bill Kong. Legendary martial arts director and choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping aims to revive the Chinese kung fu legacy with \"Blades of the Guardians,\" featuring producer and lead actor Wu Jing.\n\nThe event also featured Zhang Disha's sci-fi adventure film project, \"The Decisive Moment,\" which promises to blend authentic scientific details with imaginative storytelling in a distinctly Chinese sci-fi narrative that celebrates the spirit of Chinese aerospace exploration.\n\nRounding out the presentations was \"I Know Who You Are,\" the latest project from renowned Chinese director Feng Xiaogang, marking his return to the period drama genre after a seven-year hiatus following his acclaimed film \"Youth.\" Starring popular actors Lei Jiayin and Hu Ge, the film chronicles a cop's pursuit of a deeply disguised spy over a span of 40 years.\n\nAlibaba Pictures' Li Jie emphasized the importance of epic productions in drawing audiences to theaters for a big-screen experience, especially in light of concerning data showing low cinema attendance and viewing frequency this year.\n\n\"The market needs to regain confidence, requiring the releases of big productions and major tentpole films,\" he said. \"From plateau to peak, there are no shortcuts. To understand why cinema is what it is, we must return to the essence of cinema itself.\""
