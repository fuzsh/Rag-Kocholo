        "text": "A candid chat with Vashon Film Institute president Mark Mathias Sayre\n\nBy Sara Michelle Fetters\n\nIt’s year three for the Vashon Island Film Festival (VIFF), and the president of the Vashon Film Institute Mark Mathias Sayre is ready for the audience to grab their seats. \"It’s an exceptionally busy time right now,” says Mathias with a lively chuckle. \"I’m very excited about it.”\n\nThe idea remains the same as it was at the festival’s inception in 2021: program major titles and award-winners from festivals from earlier in the calendar year like Cannes, Sundance, and Tribeca, showcase them at the historic Vashon Theatre, and let audiences (residents, visitors, press, guests, everyone and anyone) enjoy themselves.\n\n\"Yes,” agrees Sayre, \"we’re still committed to curating notable and award-winning films, both features and shorts, from the preceding festival season. This year, we have films that won grand jury prizes at Sundance, Un Certain Regard at Cannes, took home top prizes at Tribeca, and a number that performed extraordinarily well, whether it was audience award winners or grand jury prizes or special jury prizes, at SXSW.”\n\nAnd what are some of those titles? Nicholas Colia’s comedy Griffin in Summer starring Melanie Lynskey, Owen Teague, Abby Ryder Fortson, and Kathryn Newton. Cannes Film Festival Un Certain Regard award-winner Black Dog, directed and co-written by renowned Chinese filmmaker Hu Guan. Grand Jury Prize recipient at January's Sundance Film Festival and Golden Space Needle winner for Best Documentary at this May’s Seattle International Film Festival Porcelain War. Jane Schoenbrun’s critically lauded I Saw the TV Glow. SXSW Audience Award-winner Songs from the Hole. Those are just a few noteworthy features VIFF is bringing to the island.\n\n\"We also have a new screening section called The Local Spotlight,” adds Mathias. \"We have Inheritance from local filmmaker Rachel Noel James [who stars and co-wrote the screenplay] that will be screening, as well as The Sound, which is a pilot episode of a new series focused on First Nation people. Has a supernatural thriller vibe to it, which is very cool.\n\n\"We are also going to showcase some short films that have been submitted to us from [Vashon Island] locals in a new screening section that’s kind of festival-within-the-festival called Shortcuts. It’s like a little mini competition for local shorts.”\n\nBut it’s not only about bringing a variety of cinematic confections to Vashon for a celebratory weekend in early August. Mathias also views VIFF as a showcase for the island itself, one that could inspire filmmakers to make future features there.\n\n\"Decker Sadowski, who's on our jury, who was one of the stars and producers of Juniper that was in the festival two years ago, she actually with her team just shot a new movie on the island earlier this year,” he says with pride. \"It’s really awesome, because they found the island by going to the festival. They fell in love with it and then decided to shoot a movie for a million bucks [here]. You can see the success of the festival really spilling back into the local economy. It’s great.”\n\nIt's this aspect, non-resident attendees discovering the majestic beauty and everything it has to offer, that arguably excites the Vashon Island Film Institute president the most.\n\n\"That's probably the most exciting thing to me about the festival,” says Mathias. \"It’s now become really representative of the other stuff that we want to do with the Film Institute, which can show how even celebrating indie film here is directly resulting in empowering people to make art, whether it’s film or something else in the Pacific Northwest, here on the island more specifically. That was the goal from the beginning. At the end of the day, we knew we’d be most successful if we were able to engender the creation of more art. Seeing that already starting to happen as we go into year three of the film festival? It’s super-duper exciting to me, and it puts motivation into all of us working at the Film Institute as we open up our new programs.”\n\nSome of those new programs include the Quartermaster Lag, otherwise known as \"QLab,” a collective of filmmaking programs decided to facilitate local productions, and VFIpresents, a sales, distribution, and release arm, which focuses on organizing community events outside of VIFF, such as a Night Market at the Backlot, an outdoor space at the Vashon Theatre scheduled to take place the first Friday of each month.\n\n\"We just had our first Night Market [on July 5],” says Mathias. \"Where we had a variety of vendors selling antiques, vintage clothing, and handcrafted goods. We had a DJ play, a beer and wine garden, and all sorts of leisure games. I was just so pleased, especially for what we would call probably like a beta test without a ton of marketing. People just poured in. As soon as they saw what was going on, it was just a magnet for activity. I can only imagine how much that will grow.\n\n\"And then we have more big plans. We’re talking about doing a music festival and a theater festival and all sorts of other stuff. I’m very excited for the immediate film festival, obviously, but also for everything that we have in the future at the Vashon Film Institute as well.\n\n\"I felt like we were onto something, and this community has always been such a big arts advocate. I knew if our goal was to empower artists and celebrate their art, we would have the community a hundred percent behind us and, certainly, we have been proved nothing but right on that front. Things are moving really even quicker than we probably anticipated.”\n\nNot bad for a festival originally imagined to be a way to help a local historical movie house out when it was struggling to get back to financial viability in a post-COVID world.\n\n\"That’s really how the Institute was founded to begin with,” Mathias explains. \"I had been having conversations with [Vashon Theatre owner] Eileen Wilcott. I’m friendly with them, and we knew they would probably be having difficulties coming out of the pandemic keeping the doors open. So, the film festival’s genesis really was as a special event coming out of COVID that we thought would increase the chances that people would come to the theatre, would come back to see independent film. And it’s only grown from there.\n\n\"The relationship between VFI and the Vashon Theatre now is so strong that we're partnering on multiple different events and projects, and I think we’ve really found this synergy where they can be a home base for us for events and activities. This lets us support them to help keep the doors open and to keep the community coming to an institution that for a ton of us is seminal. I mean, both my career as a filmmaker and now as a sales agent and distributor outside of VFI, I owe to the theatre. I also own and operate The Forge, which is a motion picture sales and distribution company. I do not think I would be doing what I am had I not gone to the Vashon Theatre as a child.”\n\nAnd what does Mathias envision for VIFF by the time of its 10th or 20th anniversary?\n\n\"I think in some ways we’re limited to sort of the size and scope of how big the program can be,” he candidly admits. \"But we do have plans to expand to a couple of other venues where we can start putting on seminars, workshops, and lecture series during the festival, which will probably start to happen in the next few years. We’re immediately very focused on continuing to try to attract as many off-islanders and out-of-staters as possible to get respect, awareness, and exposure.\n\n\"I think, what will come with that, is you will start to see in addition to the way that we curate the greatest hits that we will start to premiere a number of movies at this festival. I think that’s where the program will grow. It’ll start to be a launchpad for filmmakers who want to say to the world, ‘We premiered at the Vashon Island Film Festival! We got in there!’ I think that will mean something inherently positive.\n\n\"Mostly, I’m just so pleased with every filmmaker that we’ve had come to the festival has had nothing but the most positive things to say to me about their experiences. To me, that’s the best metric of success you could possibly have.”\n\nThe third annual Vashon Island Film Festival will take place at the historic Vashon Theatre Aug. 8-11. Ticket holders can form a queue one hour before each screening and will be admitted at the scheduled showtime on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Located off the coast of Washington State, the island festival will screen 12 features and 10 shorts, plus three local projects.\n\nVIFF will also feature a selection of other events for patrons to experience, including the Red Bicycle Awards Ceremony, hosted on Sunday, August 11, at the Vashon Theatre and its outdoor pavilion The Backlot, which is a newly renovated and family-operated cultural landmark on the island.\n\nFestival founder and CEO of the Forge distribution and sales company Mark Mathias Sayre said, “I don’t envy our jury’s job,” says Sayre. “Our line-up is as strong as it’s ever been—it truly is the best of the best from this year’s festival season.

Founded by veteran film producer Mark Mathias Sayre, VFI is dedicated to fostering independent filmmaking in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), with a Board of Directors that currently includes Isaac Mann, Peter Serko, and newcomer Kim Voynar.\n\nVFI’s two nascent divisions are the Quartermaster Lab (“Qlab”), a collective of filmmaking programs, and VFIpresents, its sales, distribution, and release arm, which will also focus on organizing community events outside of VIFF, such as a Night Market at the Backlot, a world- class outdoor space at the Vashon Theatre, the first Friday of each month.\n\n“The quintessential goal in founding VFI was to support independent filmmaking in the Pacific Northwest,” says Sayre. “To that end, VIFF has already brought compelling indie features and documentaries to local audiences and will continue to do so. But that’s only part of the game-plan: We’re equally committed to engendering the creation of new films as much as we are thrilled to celebrate them. In this sense, the Qlab will focus on developing new projects that VFIpresents can bring to life. Their commonality will be the PNW, whether that means the films are set or produced here, or the filmmakers call it home.”\n\nVIFF will return to Vashon from Thursday, August 8, to Sunday, August 11, 2024, with another curated program of award-winning film screenings from the current festival season and other events, including yet-to-be-announced live music performances. Screenings and concerts shall be held at the Vashon Theatre, with ancillary festival events held at various locations around the town of Vashon. Funded to date entirely through charitable contributions, donations can be made through VIFF’s funding portal on its official website, where donors can identify the intended use of the funds (i.e., for general use or for facility improvements at the Vashon Theatre).\n\n“VIFF is our flagship program and that isn’t going to change,” adds Sayre. “I was very proud to watch how it grew in its second year, and we’ve got big plans to continue harnessing all of the potential our beautiful island offers. We may be limited by the quantity of our screenings, but that just means we can focus on the quality of our program, both on- and off-screen.”\n\nThis year’s jury awards will be selected by actress and filmmaker Melora Walters and VIFF alumni Nick Richey (1-800-Hot-Nite, VIFF22), Olivia Kuan (The Herricanes, VIFF23), Paris Zarcilla (Raging Grace, VIFF23), and Decker Sadowski (Juniper, VIFF22). Last year’s top prizes went to Charlotte Regan’s Scrapper (Quartermaster Award for Excellence in Feature Filmmaking), Lloyd Lee Choi’s Closing Dynasty (Burton Award for Excellence in Short Filmmaking), Jordan Albertsen’s BOOM: A Film About the Sonics (Audience Award for Best Feature), and Sarah Hanner’s Bläckfisk (Audience Award for Best Short).\n\nTicketing is now open to the public here, with three discounted ticketing tiers available for early-bird purchase: a three-film package (10% off), a six-film package (15% off), and a ten plus-film package (20% off). Single screening tickets are also available for purchase at regular price. Ticketing is subject to availability. Ticket Link"
