        "text": "Chinese film director\n\nGuan Hu (Chinese: 管虎; pinyin: Guǎn Hǔ, born August 1, 1968) is a sixth generation Chinese film director.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nA graduate of the class of 1991 of the Beijing Film Academy, Guan became the youngest director in the Beijing Film Studio. In the 1990s, Guan directed a handful of films making a name as an important voice of the sixth generation, most notably with his debut, 1994's Dirt. A portrayal of Beijing's rock music scene, Dirt was filmed on a shoestring budget and was funded primarily by lead actress, Kong Lin.[2] Dirt is often compared with another major sixth generation film about the Beijing rock scene, Zhang Yuan's Beijing Bastards. Unlike that film, Guan Hu paid nearly US$2000 for state studio affiliation, allowing the film to be distributed in China and screened abroad with approval from state regulators.[2]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English Title Chinese Title Notes 1994 Dirt 头发乱了 Directorial debut 1996 Cello in a Cab 浪漫街头 Also known as The Street Rhapsody 1999 Farewell Our 1948 再见，我们的一九四八 Huabiao Awards for Best New Director - Won 2002 Eyes of a Beauty 西施眼 Beijing College Student Film Festival for Most Popular Film - Won 2009 Cow 斗牛 46th Golden Horse Film Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay - Won 2012 Design of Death 杀生 49th Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay - Nominated 2013 The Chef, the Actor, the Scoundrel 厨子戏子痞子 Beijing College Student Film Festival for Best Director - Won China Film Director's Guild Awards for Best Director - Nominated 2015 Mr. Six 老炮儿 China Film Director's Guild Awards for Best Director - Won 20th Huading Awards for Best Director - Won 2017 Golden Rooster Awards for Best Writing - Won 52nd Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards for Best Original Screenplay - Nominated 10th Asian Film Awards for Best Director - Nominated 2016 Run for Love 奔爱 2019 My People, My Country 我和我的祖国 [3] 2020 The Eight Hundred 八佰 The Sacrifice 金刚川 2024 Black Dog 狗阵 Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival[4][5]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\n2017: The Weasel Grave\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
