These are old stories, the stuff of a million episodes of VH1: Behind the Music, and they are boring.\n\nIt’s worth asking who thought this was a good idea to begin with? Mötley Crüe was an enormously popular band in its day, and sold a lot of albums — but so did Poison, Def Leopard, etc. This is boomer nostalgia writ large, offering a generation of a certain age the chance to get their vicarious hedonistic thrills by proxy. But despite the ample sex, copious nudity, and drug-fueled hotel room rampages, The Dirt feels shockingly tame. There’s a pat arm-chair psychology to the whole endeavor, the suggestion that these guys weren’t bad, they just had shitty parents or a degenerative disease or they liked fucking too much. Women are accessories in the film, which is probably true to life, but makes for a dull, flat dramatization. The band cheats on their wives and girlfriends, Nikki descends into heroin addiction, and Vince kills a guy in a drunk driving accident. These are old stories, the stuff of a million episodes of VH1: Behind the Music, and they are boring. To top it all off, screenwriter Rich Wilkes uses the death of a beatific child as a kind of moral cleansing for all the band members, as if to say haven’t these men suffered enough? This clears the way for a tired montage of the Crüe’s triumphant reunification, ready to grace the world once again with their presence. The kids are all right! Of course the band produced the film and licensed their own music to the filmmakers, so the entire thing is essentially a commercial for their catalogue (and it worked, apparently, as Crüe record sales spiked after The Dirt was released on Netflix). But don’t be fooled: This a self-congratulatory circle-jerk masquerading as a feature film."
