        "text": "Be swept up by MIFF 2024’s stories from Africa and the Middle East, spanning the contemporary experience across the region.\n\nDive into sweeping, splendid and spirit-lifting tales from across the Asia Pacific region, including the latest from festival faves Tsai Ming-liang and Hong Sang-soo; stories from New Zealand, Vietnam and Japan; and award-winners from the Berlinale and Cannes.\n\nMIFF is the world’s largest showcase of exceptional Australian filmmaking. This scintillating line-up of the festival’s local fare tells the nation’s story through documentary, drama, comedy and innovative First Nations filmmaking.\n\nMIFF’s film competition, Bright Horizons, recognises the new, the next, the breakthrough and the best, with an extraordinary international line-up of first- and second-time filmmakers competing for the Bright Horizons Award.\n\nTruth is definitely stranger than fiction in the Documentaries strand, which presents – and probes – the many facets of real life. From famous and not-so-famous faces to spectacular and far-flung places, these films are inspiring, blood-boiling, entertaining, educational, emotional and true.\n\nIndulge in European cinema’s very best – from the latest by Agnieszka Holland, Víctor Erice and Olivier Assayas; to star turns from Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan; to the winners of the Teddy Jury Award, the Cannes Caméra d’Or and San Sebastián’s Golden Shell.\n\nExpand your understanding of narrative filmmaking with these works that foreground their formal qualities and challenge with bold approaches to sound, sight and storytelling.\n\nMelbourne’s best restaurants and bars are walking distance from MIFF. Fire up the group chat, book your cinema tickets and reserve a table for a fabulous meal and conversation.\n\nRoll out the red carpet and celebrate MIFF’s 72nd edition in style with these unmissable events.\n\nThe most anticipated new works from some of the world’s most revered auteurs, presented alongside exciting new talents. See films from Francis Ford Coppola, Jia Zhang-ke, David Cronenberg and Mohammad Rasoulof, and starring Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett, Demi Moore and Sebastian Stan.\n\nIranian New Wave: 1962–79 and the original film program it is based on are curated by Ehsan Khoshbakht, Codirector, Il Cinema Ritrovato, with Joshua Siegel, Curator, and La Frances Hui, Curator, Department of Film, The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nTravel to Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Mexico and beyond with MIFF’s selection of Latin American films, including a sex-hotel-set erotic thriller, poignant filial portraits and a reimagining of Sappho.\n\nStreaming Australia-wide via ACMI Cinema 3, MIFF’s digital offering has a limited selection of festival highlights, including new films and free short films, with select access services made available.\n\nA program to enhance students’ cinema and language learning, intercultural understanding, and media-analysis skills – but also open to all learners, regardless of age, beyond the classroom.\n\nThe much-loved MIFF Shorts program highlights the art of saying more with less. This year’s selection includes animation, documentary, experimental, and Australian and international fiction shorts.\n\nGo beyond the screen and get closer to the themes, ideas and talent of the 2024 festival through MIFF’s engaging panel and conversation events.\n\nMIFF’s program of extended reality (XR) experiences – spanning virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) – rewrite the frontiers of storytelling through total audiovisual immersion. Add three or more XR session tickets to your cart to receive 15% off.\n\nAlways one of MIFF’s most popular programs, Music on Film presents a cine-sonic smorgasbord that thrusts the aural onto the big screen.\n\nA special collection of nonfiction films that observe and dissect the intersections of humankind and nature."
