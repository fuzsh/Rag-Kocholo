        "text": "Chinese director Guan Hu's latest film, \"Black Dog,\" which won the Un Certain Regard award at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, premiered in Beijing on June 12, garnering widespread acclaim.\n\n(From left to right) Director Guan Hu, actor Eddie Peng, and producer Liang Jing pose for a photo at the premiere of \"Black Dog\" in Beijing, June 12, 2024. [Photo courtesy of Dark Horse Entertainment]\n\nDirected by Guan, known for \"The Eight Hundred\" and \"The Sacrifice,\" \"Black Dog\" is a noir-western blend that tells the story of a man who returns to his remote hometown in northwest China after serving time in prison. His mission to rid the town of stray dogs takes an unexpected turn when he befriends a black dog, leading to a narrative of redemption and companionship that has resonated deeply with audiences.\n\nIn May, \"Black Dog\" won the best film award at the 77th Cannes Film Festival's Un Certain Regard selection. Jury president Xavier Dolan praised Guan's film for \"its breathtaking poetry, its imagination, its precision, and its masterful direction.\" This achievement marks only the second time a Chinese movie has received the Un Certain Regard accolade, the first being Wang Chao's \"Luxury Car\" 18 years earlier.\n\nThe star-studded premiere of \"Black Dog\" took place on June 12 in Beijing, attended by celebrities such as directors Feng Xiaogang, Jia Zhangke, and Xu Zheng, as well as actors Huang Bo and Sun Honglei, who all gave the film a thumbs-up.\n\n\"The praise and awards will transform into a force that helps us overcome various difficulties,\" Guan said in response.\n\nHis wife and general producer of the film, Liang Jing, highlighted the skepticism they faced during the film's development. \"When Guan decided to make this film, he faced many doubters, myself included,\" she said.\n\nGuan explained that the film results from a transformative journey, saying, \"Staying in your comfort zone for too long, or feeling overwhelmed by fatigue, requires the bravery to change your lifestyle.\" Reflecting on his creative philosophy, Guan drew comparisons between his own experiences and the film's core theme of \"starting anew.\"\n\nActor Eddie Peng, who portrays the lead character Er Lang, offered insight into the character's evolution. \"Similar to Er Lang, we all carry the weight of past errors or lingering challenges, yet we can confront them with courage, just as he demonstrates,\" Peng said. \"Everyone will find strength in this film.\"\n\nThe director noted, \"The animal nature hidden within humans is particularly precious; we lose it as we grow up, but this black dog ignites the vigor that Er Lang should possess.\"\n\nA poster for \"Black Dog.\" [Photo courtesy of Huayi Brothers Media]\n\nIt's worth noting that the film's canine star, Xiaoxin, also secured the Grand Jury Prize at the Palm Dog ceremony at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Black Dog\" marks Guan's return to animal-themed filmmaking 15 years after his critically acclaimed movie \"Cow.\" This time, the director worked with hundreds of stray dogs, an unprecedented level of animal involvement in Asian cinema. The endeavor posed significant challenges for the creative team. \"We had to have great patience working with animals,\" he added.\n\nAs the credits roll at the end of the film, a line says, \"Black Dog\" is dedicated to \"all those who have endured pain and chosen to journey forward once more.\" The film also held another premiere event in Shanghai on June 13, just before the opening of the Shanghai International Film Festival. It hit theaters nationwide in China on June 15."
