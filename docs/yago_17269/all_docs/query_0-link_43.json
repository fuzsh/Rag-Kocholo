        "text": "This study considers Chinese youth cinema as a historical object that represents the gamut of social practices and styles of production. The youth films produced in the major Chinese regions—Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong—illustrate how much social practices dominated the film content and style. For instance, youth genre in Hong Kong, once prevalent in the Cantonese cinema of the mid and late 1960s, blended musical and melodrama by dormant with the rise of martial art films. The authors examine the historical development of young people for tracing how different social and historical contexts interpret Chinese young people's world. This study attempts to elaborate some films featuring young people in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and to review the histories of youth cinema in these Chinese regions. Chinese youth film outlines how, in Chinese communities, the category of youth historically functions as a significant site of ideological inscription that displays its struggles towards an idealized future.\n\nObjective – This study considers Chinese youth cinema as a historical object that represents the gamut of social practices and styles of production. Findings – The youth films produced in the major Chinese regions—Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong—illustrate how much social practices dominated the film content and style. For instance, youth genre in Hong Kong, once prevalent in the Cantonese cinema of the mid and late 1960s, blended musical and melodrama by dormant with the rise of martial art films. Methodology/Technique – The authors examine the historical development of young people for tracing how different social and historical contexts interpret the Chinese young people's world. Novelty – This study attempts to elaborate some films featuring young people in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and to review the histories of youth cinema in these Chinese regions. The Chinese youth film outlines how, in Chinese communities, the category of youth historically functions as a significant site of ideological inscription that displays its struggles towards an idealized future.\n\nThis dissertation explores the ways in which postwar East Asian cinema was shaped by the practice of transnational collaborations and competitions between newly independent and still existing colonial states at the height of Cold War cultural politics. More specifically, my aim is to elucidate the extent to which postwar film studios aspired to rationalize and industrialize the system of mass-production by way of co-producing, expanding the market, and co-hosting film festivals. I argue that the emergence of these motion picture studios was the offspring of the Cold War and American hegemony. While providing financial aids to film industries and supporting the cultural elite, U.S. agencies helped to initiate the first postwar inter-Asian film studio network. It is a new attempt to reconstruct East Asian film history. By unveiling these cinematic links, the previously unquestioned history of quintessential national cinema is reassessed. I claim that the concept of national cinema is a fictional construct precariously built upon the denial of the regional cinematic sphere."
