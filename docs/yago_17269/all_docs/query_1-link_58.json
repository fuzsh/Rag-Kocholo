        "text": "As the long-gestating Motley Crue biopic The Dirt heads toward a February production start, the film is in the home sweet home stretch of securing the leads who will play the iconic hair metal band.\n\nGame of Thrones actor Iwan Rheon and The Punisher actor Daniel Webber are in negotiations to star as guitarist Mick Mars and frontman Vince Neil, respectively.\n\nIf the deals go through, the actors will join Douglas Booth, who is on board as Nikki Sixx, and Machine Gun Kelly, who is due to play drummer Tommy Lee, in the movie based on the best-selling autobiography written by the band and author Neil Strauss.\n\nJeff Tremaine, the helmer of the Jackass movies, is attached to direct the pic, which has a script by Rich Wilkes, Tom Kapinos and Amanda Adelson.\n\nThe book was a no-holds-barred account of the group’s rise to top of the ‘80s rock scene, chronicling their ascent from the streets of Hollywood to the heights of international fame while conquering drug addiction and personal demons on their way toward redemption.\n\nA movie adaptation of the book has been in the works since 2003, and Dirt was previously set up at Paramount and Focus Features before landing at Netflix in 2017.\n\nJulie Yorn, Erik Olsen and Allen Kovac are producing. Chris Nilsson, Steven Kline and Rick Yorn are executive producing.\n\nThe bandmembers are co-producers on the film.\n\nRheon gained a following for his role as the vicious and brutal Ramsay Bolton on HBO’s Thrones. He was most recently seen playing Maximus in the Marvel show The Inhumans. He is repped by UTA\n\nWebber did scene-stealing work as a PTSD-suffering soldier in Netflix’s Punisher. He is repped by WME, Industry Entertainment, Sophie Jermyn Management and attorney Tara Kole."
