        "text": "âBlack Dog,â the critically acclaimed Chinese drama that clinched the Un Certain Regard award at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, premiered Wednesday in Beijing. The event, attended by a host of movie industry professionals and guests, marked the filmâs first public showing in China, three days ahead of its national release.\n\nDirected by Guan Hu, whose credit includes such blockbusters as âThe Eight Hundredâ and âThe Sacrifice,â this film follows an ex-con who returns to his remote hometown in Northwest China. Tasked with ridding the town of stray dogs, the protagonist finds his mission taking an unexpected turn as he befriends a dog, leading to a profound journey of redemption and companionship. As stated in the opening credits, the film is dedicated to âall those who have endured pain and chosen to journey forward once more.â\n\nProducer Liang Jing highlighted the skepticism the project encountered during its development. âWhen Guan decided to make this film, many doubted its feasibility, including me,â she said. Reflecting on the conception of this project, Guan drew parallels between his personal experiences and the filmâs central theme of âstarting afresh.â\n\nA scene from Guan Huâs latest film âBlack Dog.âFile photo\n\nâWhen you stay in a comfort zone for too long, or when a sense of fatigue sets in, you need the courage to change your way of life,â he explained, describing the film as the result of this transformative process.\n\nThe premiere was met with applause and positive reviews from critics and industry insiders alike. Chinese director Huang Jianxin praised the film for its intricate portrayal of human nature, calling it a âparableâ that delivers a profound emotional impact. âEvery character in the film feels real,â Huang said. Director Li Shaohong expressed a deep resonance with Guanâs desire to break free from his comfort zone. âI was deeply touched,â she said. ââBlack Dogâ is a film that will not only win audiencesâ hearts but will also leave a mark in the Chinese filmmaking history.â\n\nThe event featured a discussion with the cast and crew, shedding light on the filmâs production process. Eddie Peng, who delivers a powerful performance as the protagonist nicknamed Er Lang, shared his understanding of the character. âMuch like Er Lang, I need to face unresolved issues from my past. I can finally face them bravely just as he does,â Peng said, adding that he hopes the audience may find similar strengths.\n\nThe film won rave reviews when it was shown in Cannes. A Variety review called it âa resonant, visually resplendent China-Noir about taming the mad dog within.â\n\nThe film, set against the backdrop of expansive societal changes, will hit theaters across China this Saturday.
