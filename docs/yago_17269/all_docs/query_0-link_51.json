        "text": "This study is about the development of the Chinese movie industry through the economic and political opening of the country, from 1979 to 2015. It analyzes, in the first place, the demographic changes, as well as the economic and political ones in order to understand the environment in which the movie industry is found. Later on, it overviews the main regulations that have shaped the industry and finally, it goes deep into the business of moviemaking through the analysis of the studio system, the main filmmakers and the use of censorship as a protectionist measure for its cultural assets.\n\nThis article investigates the ongoing absence in China of a system of age-ratings for films. We provide a history of contemporary Chinese debate about establishing age-ratings, comprehensively examining former censor regimes' content restrictions and conceptions of youth. Drawing on archival research and interviews , this history describes the authorities responsible for film regulation, stakeholders advocating for reform, and the techniques involved in restricting content. We show that the Chinese state continues to resist an age-rating system for films, while arguing that this exceptional position masks historical and current similarities between China and elsewhere in governing acceptable content for youth.\n\nThis article investigates the ongoing absence in China of a system of age-ratings for films.

More specifically, my aim is to elucidate the extent to which postwar film studios aspired to rationalize and industrialize the system of mass-production by way of co-producing, expanding the market, and co-hosting film festivals. I argue that the emergence of these motion picture studios was the offspring of the Cold War and American hegemony. While providing financial aids to film industries and supporting the cultural elite, U.S. agencies helped to initiate the first postwar inter-Asian film studio network. It is a new attempt to reconstruct East Asian film history. By unveiling these cinematic links, the previously unquestioned history of quintessential national cinema is reassessed. I claim that the concept of national cinema is a fictional construct precariously built upon the denial of the regional cinematic sphere."
