        "text": "Today’s world is filled with stories of Native Americans struggling to overcome historic trauma and racial inequality. There is a consistent narrative of struggle; however, there are very few stories of hope, history, and understanding that show us what’s possible when people overcome challenges.\n\nFour years ago, former pro cyclist Scott Nydam met a group of optimistic Native American cyclists and saw an opportunity to use a simple tool to bring hope and healing to the Navajo Nation. This small group of mountain bikers had experienced the positive mental and physical effects of cycling for themselves and their friends and wanted to share that with others. The only problem was that within the 28,000-mile Navajo Nation, there wasn’t a single bike shop. They quickly realized that not only were there no bike shops, but there were also no trails, bikes, or instruction to allow a cycling culture to grow. This gave Scott the vision for a non-profit, the Silver Stallion, a grassroots indigenous-led cycling initiative to start addressing these problems from the ground up. What they didn’t realize at the time was that the program would go far beyond anything they ever imagined.\n\nPost-film discussion with José Chacón, Equity and Access Manager, Park City Community Foundation, Ashley Cleveland, “Outdoor Auntie,” Outdoor Afro Alumna, Advisory Board Member -Utah Office of Outdoor Recreation, Jordan River Commission and Scott Nydam, Founder of Silver Stallion. Donna McAleer, Executive Director, Bicycle Collective, will moderate.\n\nPresented with Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter as part of the Reel Community Series and in conjunction with Earth Day."
