        "text": "Director Feng Xiaogang stars as a veteran gangster who comes up against young hoodlums in Beijing…\n\nGuan Hu has been one of the more interesting filmmakers from Mainland China during the last decade or so, finding a second wind in his career in 2009 with the release of the Huang Bo-starring Cow, which won praise at a variety of international festivals. Having followed this with Design of Death and the complex farce The Chef, the Actor, the Scoundrel, Guan now returns with the Beijing-set crime drama Mr. Six, which stars director Feng Xiaogang in the titular lead role. Having gone down well with the critics and local audiences, the film proved another global success for the director, playing at a number of festivals and events around the world.\n\nFeng Xiaogang headlines as Mr Six, a former gangster who now lives a quiet life in a Beijing hutong, watching over the neighbourhood and getting on with the business of growing old, sticking to his traditional values while the world around him changes. His ordered existence is threatened when his son Bobby (Li Yifeng, Forever Young) gets into trouble with a gang of rich kids, being taken prisoner by their arrogant leader Kris (Kris Wu, Sweet Sixteen), who demands a hefty sum to pay for damages to his luxury car. Instead of notifying the police, Mr Six tries to raise the money from his friends and fellow former hoodlums, though matters become gradually more complicated, with a violent showdown looming that he would appear to have little chance of winning.\n\nThough the basic premise of Mr. Six is familiar enough, the whole young thugs vs old thugs plot having been done countless times before around the world, there’s thankfully a lot more to the film that its rather simple narrative setup. While the story itself is predictable enough, Guan Hu is equally, if not more concerned with the underlying themes, and the film works very well indeed as a fascinating and thoughtful look at the changes sweeping modern Chinese society, and the problems caused by the ever-widening generation gaps. For the most part a surprisingly quiet and subtle drama, the film benefits from a sharp and intelligent script that really nails the social criticism angle without ever being crass or too obvious. It’s not a film with easy answers when it comes to the issues it deals with, and Guan shows a talent for balancing this with a powerful humanism and a real skill at storytelling.\n\nAt the same time, the film really excels as a character drama, thanks in no small part to Feng Xiaogang, whose superb lead performance ties things together, being well-deserving of his Golden Horse Awards win for Best Actor. Though Feng has appeared in a number of films throughout his career, including the likes of Kung Fu Hustle and Let the Bullets Fly, he’s usually been restricted to smaller and more comical roles, and it’s great to see him getting a chance to show off his talents properly, displaying range, subtlety and a winningly gruff charisma. The fact that the viewer cares about his character makes the film engaging and increasingly tense, and Feng effortlessly dominates every scene as well as adding depth to his relationship with his son – wisely, Guan prevents things from ever getting too sentimental in this regard, though the film is moving, carrying a genuine emotional punch.\n\nVisually the film also impresses, Guan giving the proceedings the feel of a mix of grounded indie sixth generation and more commercial cinema, managing to combine the best of both worlds. The film is highly atmospheric throughout, with great use of Beijing locations that evoke a very strong sense of place without being touristic, the city and the hutongs acting almost as a supporting character and a symbol of change. A touch on the long side at over two hours, the film’s deliberate pace nevertheless pays dividends for the patient viewer, and Guan patiently builds suspense as the inevitable final battle draws close. While predominantly based around dialogue scenes, the film does have a few flashes of action here and there, though these are more effective and impactful for being used sparingly, helping maintain a grounded realism.\n\nMr. Six is easily one of the better studio films from Mainland China of the last year or so, and a fine effort from Guan Hu which should appeal to viewers of different tastes from around the world. Anchored by Feng Xiaogang’s excellent performance, the film is gripping, insightful and taut, and an entertaining look at modern China and the conflicts arising from the rapid social change sweeping the country."
