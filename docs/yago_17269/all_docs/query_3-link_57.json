It has become the first film to make over 1 billion yuan in the world's second-largest box-office market this year.\n\nThe film currently boasts a rating of 9.2 points out of 10 on the Maoyan platform and a rating of 7.7 on Douban, a review platform.\n\nOne scene of \"The Eight Hundred,\" a Chinese war epic poised to hit the big screen in limited theatrical release in North America on Aug. 28, 2020.
