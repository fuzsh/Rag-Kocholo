        "text": "Here's a free tip for music fans hoping the New Orleans-shot film \"The Dirt\" will do for Mötley Crüe what the Oscar-winning \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" did for Queen. Adjust your expectations before slipping into your leopard-print spandex, teasing what's left of your hair and settling in to watch Netflix's unapologetically rowdy rock biopic.\n\nFor starters, there's the fact that Mötley Crüe just isn't Queen, its catalog not nearly as top-to-bottom sing-alongable. But then, an argument can be made that the four members of the band -- bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee, guitarist Mick Mars and singer Vince Neil -- never intended for that to be the case.\n\nMötley Crüe didn't want to be the next Queen. Mötley Crüe wanted to be the first Mötley Crüe.\n\nAnd so where Queen pushed envelopes musically, Crüe was doing it behaviorally. What emerged was a hard-rocking band with a carefully crafted image casting them as the bad boys of hair metal, four devil-may-care hell-raisers who embraced the rock 'n' roll lifestyle and all of its self-destructive excesses -- the casual sex, the even more casual substance abuse -- with both needle-pocked arms.\n\nI'm not sure how much of \"The Dirt\" is good, old-fashioned hyperbole. Good lord, I hope a lot of it is, although I'm sure the band -- the members of which wrote the book on which the film is based in addition to serving as co-producers -- would swear everything in it is true.\n\nWhere was 'The Dirt' filmed? A rundown of New Orleans shooting locations\n\nYou know the stories: the TV tossed out of a hotel room window. The overdose. The deadly high-speed collision. And, of course, the girls, girls, girls.\n\nAll are covered in \"The Dirt,\" which, like the band, seems content to emphasize the bad behavior over the music. Although not rated by the MPAA, it does enough to earn a hard R within its first two minutes.\n\nFrom there, \"The Dirt\" doubles down as it tells a story that is alternately entertaining and cringe-inducing, all the while basking in 1980s nostalgia.\n\nIt's also, it must be said, consistently but casually misogynistic. All the female characters in \"The Dirt,\" just like on the rock scene of the 1980s, are objects of either pleasure or pain, nothing more. It would have been nice to see \"The Dirt\" address that particularly problematic fact of 1980s rockdom -- to say nothing of at least broaching the topic of the inevitable and presumably rampant STD's among the band.\n\nBut I suppose that would've been too responsible of it, and responsible just ain't rock 'n' roll.\n\nIt’s not all fun and games, though. “The Dirt” eventually strays into fairly dark territory, as the band members are each forced to confront their own mortality in one way or another. It’s there, as the hijinks are curtailed, that the film slows a bit. At the same time, it’s also there that it begins to flirt -- however slightly -- with thoughtfulness.\n\nIt's worth noting that \"The Dirt\" is directed by Jeff Tremaine, who is one of the creators of the \"Jackass\" series and the director of the \"Jackass\" films. Consequently, \"The Dirt\" feels like a like a \"Jackass\" film -- or at least like the spiritual cousin of a \"Jackass\" film. It has the same sensibilities: the same sense of humor, the same tastelessness. It's also just as entertaining, in the same guilty-pleasure way, and will, thus, likely appeal to the same target audience.\n\nThat's appropriate, since -- as \"The Dirt\" makes clear -- Mötley Crüe was sort of the 1980s rock version of the \"Jackass\" daredevils. That is, they are gleefully self-destructive and unfailingly sophomoric -- but also kind of fun, in a scuzzy kind of way.\n\nThey apparently knew it. \"We weren't a band,\" Douglass Booth, who plays Nikki Sixx, says in introducing the film via voiceover. \"We were a gang. A gang of (expletive) idiots.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue with that.\n\nAnd just like the gang of idiots from \"Jackass,\" those in \"The Dirt\" -- the thorough reprobates they are -- are equally hard to look away from.\n\nMike Scott is the movie and TV critic for NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune.

Based on the tell-all book of the same name.\n\nWhat works: There's a guilty-pleasure sense of fun to much of the film, which for most of its running time is alternately entertaining and cringe-inducing, all the while basking in 1980s nostalgia.\n\nWhat doesn't: In addition to boasting a tasteless sense of humor that will turn off some viewers, it's problematic in that it's also every bit as casually misogynistic as the 1980s rock scene, one in which women are objects of either pleasure or pain, nothing more.\n\nStarring: Douglas Booth, Iwan Rheon, Machine gun Kelly, Daniel Webber, David Costabile, Pete Davidson. Director: Jeff Tremaine. MPAA rating: Unrated, warrants R for strong language, pervasive nudity, frequent and graphic depictions of drug and alcohol abuse, crude humor and disturbing images. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes. When and where: Begins streaming Friday (March 22) on Netflix."
