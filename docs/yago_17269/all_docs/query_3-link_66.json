        "text": "Jia Zhang-Ke has been a Cannes favorite since “Unknown Pleasures” in 2002. The filmmaker is a leading figure of the Sixth Generation of Chinese directors. That movement follows China’s Fifth Generation of filmmakers, when Chinese cinema rose to prominence in the late 1980s, sweeping the world’s most prestigious film festivals, Cannes, Venice and Berlinale. The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors are Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou.\n\nChen Kaige’s 1993 Chinese-Hong Kong epic “Farewell My Concubine” won the Palme d’Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival and the 1994 Golden Globe for foreign-language film. The following year at Cannes, Chinese master Zhang Yimou won the grand jury prize with “To Live” (1994), which also saw the best actor award go to star Ge You. Zhang returned to the Cannes Film Festival in 1995 with “Shanghai Triad” starring Gong Li, and won the technical grand prize. Five of Zhang Yimou’s films have been nominated for a Golden Globe Award.\n\nBesides competing in the top prize category, Zia Zhang-Ke played the supporting role of Uncle Yao in Guan Hu’s drama “Black Dog” which was honored with a top prize in Un Certain Regard. Guan Hu also belongs to the Sixth Generation of directors in Chinese cinema, as does Lou Ye.\n\nFifteen years after winning the screenplay award for “Spring Fever,” Lou Ye returned to Cannes with his “An Unfinished Film” in the special screening section. The movie is about China’s Covid Crisis in 2020; a film crew reunites near Wuhan to resume the shooting halted years earlier, only to share the unexpected challenges as cities are placed under lockdown."
