        "text": "Reviews\n\n\"Dirt! The Movie celebrates soil and our connection to it. It reminds us of our physical and spiritual connection to the land, and of the perils we face when we ignore those connections between exploitation of the land and exploitation of those who live in a traditional subsistence culture on the land...I hope that it will prompt people to think about, respect, and re-connect with the soil.\"\n\nCraig Cogger, Scientist, Extension Specialist, Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State University\n\n\"This is a great way to introduce people to the importance of healthy soil. Viewers will discover that soil is not just 'dirt,' but a vast community of interconnected species. The health and survival of these communities ultimately affects the well-being of humans. This movie encourages all of us to become better stewards of this irreplaceable living system.\"\n\nDr. Linda Chalker-Scott, Urban Horticulture Extension Specialist, Washington State University, Author, The Informed Gardener and The Informed Gardener Blooms Again\n\n\"This film is a valuable contribution that graphically illustrates the importance of soil within the ecosystem and demonstrates how soil must be properly used and managed.\"\n\nDr. Gary Petersen, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Soil and Land Resources, The Pennsylvania State University\n\n\"A creative, uplifting, energizing production capable of inspiring viewers of all ages to get dirty...A valuable resource for any school, especially those teaching environmental responsibility and the connectedness of Earth's systems.\"\n\nAAAS's Science Books and Film\n\n\"Dirt! flows smoothly and quickly, making connections between fungi growing under a forest log to the lives of farmers in India...Both versions open up many points where discussion might follow, including how the abuse of dirt can be connected to the abuse of human rights and how we might act as positive agents in favor of both dirt and marginalized people...The film introduces a broad range of topics in a short amount of time through an artful medium.\"\n\nEmily E. Thorn, Colorado State University, Teaching Sociology\n\n\"A strong call to renew our ties with the land and protect life-sustaining dirt.\"\n\nBooklist\n\n\"Clearly, dirt doesn't enjoy a good name--just think of 'dirt poor' and 'dirty jokes.' Yet in filmmakers Bill Benenson and Gene Roscow's Dirt! The Movie...dirt emerges as one of the noblest substances on earth...Highly recommended.\"\n\nVideo Librarian\n\n\"A bold and interesting approach...A movie like this has to connect the role of soil in the geological, agricultural, architectural dimensions that accompany it. By using a wide array of interviews, animations and archival footage the film presents the often missed aspects of the role of top soil in the wider economic picture of sustainable agriculture...The audiences for such a film are best found in 8th grade and high school students as part of a science curriculum. The film also has good use in introductory geology courses at the college level, as well as courses which make use of ecological content. The film exists to bring some awareness of the value of biodiversity and soil management to those who might have little or no understanding of food production or life beyond an urban setting. The local community building features of the film are inspiring.\"\n\nTroy Belford, Wichita State University, Anthropology Reviews Database\n\n\"An excellent film to share with students to highlight the importance of soil and its environmental importance...The DVD includes an imaginary story that could be used by itself as an allegorical lesson about our obligation to care for the environment. There is a fire in a forest. All the animals are forced out and they all stand around looking at the fire--except for the hummingbird. It flies to the river, gets a drop of water and flies back dropping it on the fires. Over and over again it returns to the fire while the other animals stand by and watch. When challenged by the other animals, the bird replies, 'I am doing the best that I can.' Sharing that story with my students would alone make this video worth using in my classroom.\"\n\nClaudia Fetters, retired biology and earth science teacher, NSTA Recommends\n\n\"The awards say it all. This is a terrific film, well written and expertly filmed, full of interesting and useful information that flows along. It is factual storytelling at its best. Highly Recommended.\"\n\nJanis Tyhurst, George Fox University, Educational Media Reviews Online\n\n\"An innovative lesson that covers the gamut from the science of dirt filtering water to organic farming to using dirt to build homes to the need for creating green spaces in urban areas...This inspiring, informative program can be utilized in classes across the curriculum.\"\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\n\"Inspiring...Dirt! The Movie is a film with a crucial message, and well worth watching. It's an excellent movie for a teacher or professor to use for any age student, as an introduction to an ecology unit, or to open any variety of topics involving life on the planet...If everyone on the planet were aware of the issues covered in this film, we might stand a chance of actually turning thing around before we exhaust the planet's resources.\"\n\nSally Kneidel, PhD, co-Author, Going Green: A Wise Consumer's Guide to a Shrinking Planet and Veggie Revolution: Smart Choices for a Healthy Body and A Healthy Planet\n\n\"An invigorating look at an invaluable substance we take for granted that makes the case that 'dirt might be more alive than we are.'\"\n\nKenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Bill Benenson and Gene Rosow employ a colorful combination of animation, vignettes, and personal accounts from people to teach us about dirt--where it comes from, how we regard (or disregard) it, how it sustains us, the way it has become endangered, and what we can do about it. The fresh and generous spirit of Dirt! The Movie is simple and energizing.\"\n\nDenver Film Society\n\n\"Single-subject histories have dominated the last decade. Books and films on salt, wine, coffee, gin, corn, and fast food each attempt to tell a larger story by means of a narrow focus. Dirt! The Movie, based on the book Dirt, the Ecstatic Skin of the Earth, by William Bryant Logan, succeeds better than any of them. Bleak and hopeful by turns, the 80-minute documentary by Bill Beneson and Gene Rosow touches on the rise of environmentalism, the postwar industrialization of farming, strip mining, green architecture and city planning, global warming, the origins of the earth, the life cycle of forests, and sustainable agriculture.\"\n\nPopMatters\n\n\"An unrelentingly uplifting film, showcasing environmentalists and other dirt-lovers from all over the world who've planted many seeds to produce a cornucopia of eco-solutions...Dirt! The Movie highlights the interconnectedness of the many environmental issues we face.\"\n\nMother Nature Network\n\n\"Filmmakers Bill Benenson and Gene Rosow create a compelling reason why we need to pay better attention to the earth under our feet. \"\n\nHarriette Yahr, indieWIRE\n\n\"A fascinating documentary that celebrates the soil that covers our planet.\"\n\nDavid D'Arcy, The National\n\n\"A humorous and substantial look into the history and current state of the living organic matter that we come from and will later return to.\"\n\nStephen Hinton, The Humanitarian Water and Food Award\n\n\"An uplifting story about people from all walks of life who are striving to renew our relationship with the ground beneath our feet.\"\n\nShannon L. Bowen, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Thought-provoking...welcome humor and visual pizzazz.\"\n\nAndrew Barker, Variety"
