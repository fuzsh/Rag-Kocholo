        "text": "Mötley Crüe’s first gig, as dramatized in Jeff Tremaine’s Netflix adaptation of the band’s memoir, “The Dirt,” does not go well. The drummer, Tommy Lee, knocks over a cymbal before anyone plays a note; the crowd’s heckling turns into a full-on brawl. But when that fight is over, a guy in the back punctures the silence to scream, “[Expletive] yeah, Mötley Crüe!”\n\nAnd that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid, incompetent biopic.\n\nThe book version, attributed to all four members and the writer Neil Strauss, was a notorious tell-all, reveling in the group’s bad behavior and self-mythologizing. But Tremaine and the screenwriters Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “Bohemian Rhapsody,” complete with many of the same crude devices: embarrassingly bad wigs, hilariously on-the-nose needle drops (the band plays “Take Me to the Top” as they go … to the top) and declamatory, subtext-free dialogue.\n\nThe nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting, but the comedown, in which Tremaine attempts to rearrange the film into a serious character drama, is downright painful. The filmmakers try desperately to have it both ways, flipping from cheerful hedonism to “Reefer Madness”-style moralizing. The complexities of addiction seems out of their grasp.\n\nBiopics love to dazzle us with their try-hard verisimilitude, and this one gives us nearly 10 minutes of end-credit split-screen comparisons between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe, presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication. But that’s cosplay, not moviemaking. Until then, “The Dirt” plays like an ill-advised remake of “This Is Spinal Tap” — one in which all the laughs are unintentional."
