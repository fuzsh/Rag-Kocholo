        "text": "The 77th Festival De Cannes took place in May this year, celebrating the work of talented filmmakers from around the world. Director Guan Hu’s ‘Black Dog’ took home the Un Certain Regard Prize at the 2024 Prix. The film follows Lang, an ex-convict who returns to his hometown in Northwest China with the task of clearing stray dogs before the 2008 Olympics. Lang finds himself bonding with a black stray and the two souls embark on a new journey together.\n\nThe film was shot by Cinematographer Gao Weizhe who once said to the director: “Could we film like students who have just graduated from film school, make a simple and honest film without any ulterior motives?”.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the pair have worked together. Guan Hu hired Weizhe after graduating from the Cinematography Department and they have collaborated on many films since, such as “My people, my country” and “Revolutionist”. Shot in the Gobi wilderness, Black Dog presented different challenges to their previous work.\n\nOne of the aims Weizhe had was to make sure to capture the naturalistic lighting in the film. He chose Cooke Anamorphic/i S35 lenses for Black Dog, having heard of them previously during his time as an undergraduate in the Cinematography Department. Weizhe associated the ‘Cooke Look’ with being unique, soft and understated, words he had heard his professor use when talking about the lenses. This was undoubtedly a large influence on his lens choice for Black Dog.\n\nThe cinematographer first used Cooke lenses in his second year on a commercial, during the era in which cinematic filmmaking was becoming more influential. Weizhe used the Cooke S4/i lenses on the shoot, remarking that the 65mm at f2.8 added an ‘indescribable abstract beauty’ to the image. Having been so impressed with the lenses, he used them again on a later award-winning project “Plastic Goldfish”. Additionally, “Revolutionist” was shot using Cooke Anamorphic/i 1.8x FF lenses, and was the first Chinese film to use them."
