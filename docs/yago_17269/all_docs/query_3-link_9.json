However, they can also be inflexible and resistant to change. This type of person is confident in their analytical abilities while making major life decisions. INTJs frequently find typical classroom environments constricting. They may become easily bored and prefer to learn through solo study or by working on tasks that interest them.

They would rather be right than popular. They know what they want and who they want to be with. Keeping their circle small yet meaningful is more important than having a handful of superficial connections. As long as there is mutual respect, they do not mind sharing the same table with people from different facets of life.\n\nWhich Enneagram Type is Guan Hu?\n\nGuan Hu is an Enneagram Four personality type with a Five wing or 4w5. They are more introverted than the other 2-influenced types who also enjoy being alone. They have unique artistic interests that draw them towards avant-garde and eccentric arts as they represent deviance from what most people see on usually overrated mainstream platforms. However, their fifth wing may drive them to make a grand gesture to stand out among the crowd, or else they may feel unappreciated at all."
