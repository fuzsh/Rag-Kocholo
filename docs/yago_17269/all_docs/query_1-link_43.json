        "text": "In the two minutes before the title of the Netflix biopic “The Dirt” appears on screen, we are introduced meet the four members of Mötley Crüe doing very Mötley Crüe things as a wild party rages in their thrashed apartment around the corner from the Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood.\n\n“That’s Tommy, our drummer. He makes a lot of bad decisions,” says bassist Nikki Sixx, as drummer Tommy Lee, played by rapper Machine Gun Kelly, grabs his date and does a very adult thing that is still technically illegal in some states while the crowd cheers him on.\n\n“Speaking of bad choices, that’s me, trying to prove how punk I am,” continues Sixx, or to be accurate, actor Douglas Booth, as he lights the sleeve of his black leather motorcycle jacket on fire.\n\n“That’s our singer Vince,” the voice-over continues, as Vince Neil, whose role is filled by actor Daniel Webber, entertains another man’s girlfriend in the bathroom where the band’s gig posters decorate the wall. “He’s not thinking about her; he’s thinking, ‘Damn, I look good in that flyer!’\n\n“And Mick Mars – he’s an alien,” Nikki says as Mötley Crüe guitarist Mars, portrayed by Iwan Rheon, lies crankily on his bed, hoping more than anything just to be left alone.\n\nTwo minutes, and already you’ve got a very good idea of what the remaining hour and 45 minutes of “The Dirt,” which arrives on Netflix on Friday, March 22, will deliver: Loud music, bad behavior, gleeful anarchy. Of course, all that catches up with them and things go to hell for a bit, but it all gets resolved when the guys realize that what matters most to them is each other.\n\nThere is so much bad behavior in this film, which A) isn’t a surprise if you know anything about the musical and legal history of Mötley Crüe; and B) is even less unexpected given that director Jeff Tremaine made his name in Hollywood as the co-creator of the “Jackass” franchise. It’s a brilliant match, given that Mötley Crüe had the jackass thing down pat years before Johnny Knoxville ever thought of hiring a guy to chase people down the street wearing nothing but a diaper.\n\n“We weren’t a band,” Sixx says at the end of the title sequence. “We were a gang. A gang of (bleepin’) idiots.”\n\nSo let’s share the dirt on “The Dirt,” which was adapted from the band memoir of the same name written with Neil Strauss. A lot of the story is told from the point of view of Sixx, who ran away from a bad home life in Seattle to seek his fame in rock and roll in L.A.\n\nBut each of the four get their own voice-overs as they’re introduced:\n\nLee was a happy-go-lucky teenager from Covina when he met Sixx and they decided to start the band.\n\nMars, who was considerably older than the others, grew up in Garden Grove and Stanton. He suffered from a debilitating spinal condition even before he joined up, and took the band more seriously than some of his bandmates.\n\nAnd Neil, who lived in Glendora as a teen, was – how do we put this? – a singer in a cover band called Rock Candy who mostly cared about girls, girls, girls.\n\nThe movie shows them coming together to audition Neil as the Mötley Crüe song “Live Wire” plays. They settle on their name, and after a few fits and starts, conquer the clubs on the Sunset Strip. As the Crüe number “Take Me To The Top” plays, we see them at the Roxy opening for Dokken, then on the marquee of the Troubadour opening for Y&T, and finally headlining the Whisky for multiple nights and signing a record deal with a rep from Elektra played by Pete Davidson of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nThere’s a lot of extra-curricular activity that’s difficult to describe – the band receives a regular surprise guest at their booth at the Rainbow Room, for instance, or how Ozzy Osbourne tries to show them that he’s still more barking mad than they’ll ever be.\n\nI had intended to keep a tally of the number of topless performers employed in the film but discarded that idea after the mud-wrestling scene in a strip club. Wouldn’t be surprised if it set some kind of record for rock bio-pics though.\n\nMötley Crüe wasn’t really my cup of Jack Daniels when they were at their peak in the ’80s and ’90s, so take it as a compliment when I say that the movie does end up a more wholesome sum of its very debauched parts.\n\nWhen Sixx gets hooked on heroin, and later is actually pronounced dead for a few minutes until a double-dose of adrenalin shots kickstarts his heart to revive him, you feel for him. Same thing when Neil, perhaps the least likable Mötley man in real life, loses his young daughter to cancer.\n\n“The Dirt” also portrays some scenes of the band’s most inexcusable behavior – Neil’s 1984 drunk-driving car crash in which his passenger, drummer Razzle Dingley of Hanoi Rocks was killed, is part of the film – though it doesn’t touch on later scandals such as Tommy Lee’s sex tape with former wife Pamela Anderson or his six months in jail for spousal battery after a fight with Anderson in front of their son.\n\nIt’s both a tribute to the honesty of the gleefully raunchy storytelling in “The Dirt” and the acting of the four principals that there’s something more than music and titillation in the film.\n\nThe actors deserve a bit of praise, too. Colson Baker, the real name of Machine Gun Kelly, as Tommy Lee has a disarmingly sweet presence on screen. He’s a puppy dog even as he’s running wild in his leopard-print bikini underpants through the halls of the hotel he and the guys are destroying.\n\nBooth, who plays Sixx, is an English actor who prior to “The Dirt” played the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley – I think Sixx and Shelley might have enjoyed sharing clothes and hairstyles – opposite Elle Fanning as Mary in the title role of “Shelley.”\n\nRheon, who plays Mars, is a Welsh actor who played the recurring role of Ramsey Snow, the bastard son of Lord Bolton, on “Game Of Thrones,” and the Australian Webber who plays Neil might be familiar from his roles as Lee Harvey Oswald on the Hulu mini-series “11.23.63” or from his co-starring role as Lewis on the Netflix Marvel series “The Punisher.”\n\nIn “The Dirt” the guys eventually realize that what matters most is their friendship. They get clean, reunite, and play for another two decades after the time at which the film ends, finally wrapping up their live touring career on New Year’s Eve 2015.\n\nAnd that was supposed to be that, but they reunited once more, at least in the studio, to record four new songs for the soundtrack, and teased that they may continue to release new music in the future."
