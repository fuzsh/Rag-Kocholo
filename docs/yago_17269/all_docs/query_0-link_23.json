Starring: Luo Kewang, Ma Siqi.\n\nThe exciting and realistic chronicle of an 'arranged' marriage in northwest China. Will Gubo and Asheeyen understand and love each other?\n\nThe film was shot in northwest China, in a village of the Hui people, a Muslim minority. It tells the story of a young married couple's attempt to build a happy future together. Twenty-two-year-old Li Guoqing, known as Gubo, who suffers from recurrent epileptic seizures, has succeeded against all odds in marrying the lovely Asheeyen. But their marriage has been arranged by their respective families through a matchmaker who has kept the young man's illness a secret and concealed the tragic love previously experienced by the girl.

Having learned of their respective pasts kept secret by their families, the two young people, living together, can begin to know and understand each other and create an emotional relationship.\n\nLiu Miaomiao\n\nBorn in 1962 in Guyuan, in the Ningxia autonomous region, and a member of the Hui minority, Liu Miaomiao was one of the first Chinese directors to gain international visibility thanks to her participation in competition at the 1993 Venice Film Festival with “Chatterbox”. She entered the Beijing Film Academy at the age of 16 and was part of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese cinema, along with directors such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. She co-directed “Red Flowers and Green Leaves” with cinematographer Hu Weijie.\n\nFilmography\n\nStories of the Voyage (Yuǎnyáng yì shì, 1986), Women Soldiers in the Long March (Mǎtí shēng suì, 1987), The Boxer (Quánjí shǒu, 1988), Chatterbox (Zá zuǐzi, 1993), Family Scandal (Jiāchǒu, 1994, co-directed with Cui Xiaoqin), Family Problems (Jiāshì, 1996), The Mountain Has No Words (Dàshān wú yán, 2005), Uptown Girl and Donetown Girl (Xiǎotián jìn chéng, 2008), Red Flowers and Green Leaves (Hónghuā lǜyè, 2019, co-directed with Hu Weijie).\n\nRed Flowers and Green Leaves (Hónghuā lǜyè, 2019).\n\n喜马拉雅之灵 Xǐmǎlāyǎ zhī líng (The spirit of the Himalayas)\n\nby Zeng Yunhui, 2017, running time 109'.\n\nScreenplay: Wang Fei, Zeng Yunhui. Cinematography: Zeng Yunhui. Music: Ricky Ho. Producer: Lin Yong, Shi Yuzhen, Yang Yunfei, Chen Ying. Starring: Phurbu Tsering, Lhak Chong, Shaijikanbin Arbo.\n\nEpic drama set in the background of the Tibetan plateau. To save his tribe from extinction, the warrior Lendon ventures in search of the Source of Life.\n\nThis epic drama is set in the 8th century and features the Bogar tribe, ethnic Lhoba Tani, living in the forests of the Tibetan plateau. Various calamities have brought the tribe to the brink of extinction and the main character, the warrior Lendon, tries to prevent their forthcoming end by finding the Fountain of Life. The making of the film required great passion and tenacity over the three years of production, made difficult by filming in remote locations and at very high altitudes. All the roles, except for the main characters, are played by authentic Lhobas who in real life are shepherds, farmers or hunters. First-time director Zeng Yunhui emphasised that the narrative combines fictional elements and authentic experiences that the small local community shared with him. The film, in addition to its beautiful images, offers a rare glimpse on the ancestral features of Tibetan culture that is disappearing in the face of the encroaching contemporary world.\n\n​\n\nZeng Yunhui\n\nZeng Yunhui made his feature film debut with The Soul of Himalaya, which was shot in Tibetan remote and arduous locations with members of the Lhoba Tani ethnic group. Zeng also handled the cinematography for his debut, which had its world premiere at the 2017 Shanghai Film Festival.\n\nThe Soul of Himalaya (Xǐmǎlāyǎ zhī líng, 2017).\n\n阿拉姜色 Ālā jiāng sè (Drink this good wine),\n\nby Sonthar Gyal, 2018, running time 115'.\n\nScreenplay: Tashi Dawa, Sonthar Gyal.

Starring: Yungdrung Gyal, Nyima Sungsung, Sechok Gyal, Jinpa, Guru Tsedan, Zhang Wenqing.\n\nA young Tibetan woman finds herself seriously ill and decides to undertake a pilgrimage to Lhasa. An initiatory and spiritual journey steeped in humanity.\n\n\"Ala Changso\" is a traditional Tibetan drinking song, inviting people to share good wine, which is part of a key moment in the film. The protagonist, Drolma, undertakes the long and arduous Buddhist pilgrimage to Lhasa, despite her serious illness. After the escape of the two bearers who were accompanying her, the husband Dorje joins her to provide support on the way, together with Drolma's first-born son Norbu, a difficult child who has been brought up by his maternal grandparents. Unfortunately, the aggravation of her illness does not allow the woman to reach her destination. After her death, and after the funeral rites, Dorje and Norbu continue their journey together towards Lhasa, and the route becomes an initiatory path that will bring the two closer together. The director focuses on the protagonists rather than on the obvious magnificence of the landscapes, recounting with feeling and delicacy a story linked to family, spirituality and death.\n\nSonthar Gyal\n\nAfter studying Cinematography at the Beijing Film Academy, Tibetan Sonthar Gyal took his first steps in cinema working on Pema Tseden's The Silent Holy Stones (2005), The Search (2009) and Old Dog (2011).

Cinematography: Lu Songye. Editing: Liao Ching-Sung, Jin Di. Music: Peyman Yazdanian Producer: Huang Xufeng, Jacky Pang. Starring: Sonam Wangmo, Jinpa, Yangshik Tso.\n\nThrough the vicissitudes of a contemporary Tibetan family, director Pema Tseden stages the conflict between modernity and tradition with splendid images and fine lyricism.\n\nThe milky sequence opening the film, seen through a \"balloon\", immediately introduces the element mentioned in the title, at the origin of a series of events for the protagonist family. Darje and his wife Drolkar, their three sons and a grandfather live on the high plateau of Tibet, raising sheep in the grasslands of the Qinghai province. With much effort, the family manages to keep their eldest son Jamyang in school. Despite some concessions to modernity, they respect the traditions and principles of the Buddhist faith in which they were raised. To prevent unwanted pregnancies, the couple uses contraceptives, provided by the public health service to carry out family planning. Their lively children accidentally find condoms in the house and go to play outside using them as balloons, a hilarious episode which also upsets the harmony of the small community. The conflict between modernity and tradition will force them to take difficult decisions.\n\nPema Tseden\n\nDirector and writer, Pema Tseden (in Mandarin, Wanma Caidan) was born in 1969 in the Guide County, east of Qinghai Province and was the first Tibetan student at the Beijing Film Academy.

Cinematography: Xu Ranjun. Editing: Liao Ching-Sung, Jin Di. Music: Xiaohe. Producer: Patrick Mao Huang, Chen Jingsu, Zhang Zhaowei. Starring: Mason Lee, Huang Lu, Gong Zihan, Chen Yihao, Chen Zhihao, Deng Jing.\n\nIn a mosaic between past and present, between the documentation of spaces and the memories that inhabit them, debutant Qiu Sheng’s persuasive talent is revealed.\n\nParallel stories, set in Hangzhou, in southern China, develop on different time frames. In the present day, following ground subsidence in a suburban neighborhood, young engineer Xiahao and his team of technicians, are carrying out inspections in an area where a new underground line is to be built. Wandering through the deserted scenery that the population has been forced to evacuate, he comes across a primary school where he finds the diary of a boy, also called Xiahao, describing the time spent years ago with his schoolmates in that very district at the beginning of its urbanisation. As Xiahao reads the diary, events from his namesake's past resurface. At the same time, Xiahao realises that the diary may contain unexpected prophecies about his own life. With a light and inscrutable touch, newcomer Qiu Sheng constructs a mysterious and fascinating tale, revealing himself as a remarkable talent in China's new independent cinema.\n\nQiu Sheng\n\nQiu Sheng was born in Hangzhou and studied biomedical engineering before earning a master's degree in Fine Arts from Hong Kong Baptist University.

Starring: Lyu Xingchen, Wu Xiaoliang, Wang Jiajia, Wang Weishen, Tao Hai, Chen Yongzhong.\n\nIn the freezing winter of north-east China, siblings Gu Xi and Gu Liang make a painful transition to adulthood in actor Liang Ming's directorial debut.\n\nLeft without a family, Gu Xi and his brother Gu Liang live on their own in a small house in the freezing Heilongjiang province in northeast China, near the border with North Korea. The story takes place in the 1990s, in the middle of winter. An oil spill forces Gu Liang to abandon his job as a fisherman and work for the local mafia, where he is soon seduced by easy money. She feels abandoned by her elder brother, who has always taken care of her but is beginning to neglect her, especially since falling in love with Qingchang, the daughter of the mafia boss on whom he depends.

A harsh contemporary noir, with a jazz musical background.\n\nReturning for his mother's funeral to his rainy hometown on China's southern coast, Song Hao must face the consequences of past events. As a student, he would have deserved the scholarship that was instead awarded to Li Tang, son of the vice-mayor and also his best friend. Furious for this injustice, Song Hao wanted to go to Li Tang's, but because of the typhoon underway, he had entered the wrong house where the owner had attacked him, believing him to be a thief. Song Hao had hit him to defend himself and, thinking he had killed him, had fled without realising that his father and Li Tang were watching. To protect him, his father had then killed the wounded man, while his friend kept quiet about this incident.
