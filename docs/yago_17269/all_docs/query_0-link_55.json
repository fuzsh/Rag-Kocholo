This document discusses Chinese cinema in the context of transnational cultural politics. It notes the rise in popularity and critical acclaim of Chinese films in international film festivals starting in the late 1980s. It also discusses the growing field of Chinese film studies in the West. However, it points out that some of the key terms used in Chinese film studies, such as generational labels of directors, remain problematic and potentially confusing. The document examines issues relating to the screening and reception of Chinese films, as well as naming systems, from the perspective of transnational cultural politics.",
