Comments are solicited. This document contains information affecting the national defense of the United States, within the meaning of the espionage laws, Title 18 USC, Sections 793 and 794, the transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person is prohibited by law. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2000/06/07 : CIA-RDP79TO1003A000900160001-4 Approved For Release 2000/06/07 : CIA-RDP79TO1003A000900160001-4 CONFIDENTIAL EAST GERMANY REVISES EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE VALUTA MARK The East German government in recent months has begun to re- port its commodity trade statistics in a valuta (foreign exchange) mark valued at one eastmark to .95 rubles, in effect establishing an exchange ratio of 4.2 eastmarks to the dollar. The new rate, which is the equivalent of both the East German non-commerical rate for the dollar and the West German official rate of exchange, is a far better reflection of the relative purchasing power of the east- mark than is the current official commerical rate of exchange of 2.2 eastmarks to the dollar,* In a lead article appearing in the official newspaper Neues Deutschland (6 December 1959), Heinrich Rau, East German Minister for Foreign and Interzonal Trade, stated that commodity trade between East Germany and the USSR during 1960-65 will be \"over 50 billion valuta-rubles, which corresponds to a sum of 52-1 billion marks,\" At the current official commercial rate of exchange, the corresponding sum would be only 27.8 billion marks. A subsequent article appearing in the same newspaper (8 January 1960), though containing only a con- fused and inadequate explanation of the rationale behind the adoption of this new valuation of the eastmark, indicates that it now will be the policy of the Ministry to apply this rate when dealing with foreign trade matters. Thus far, however, the East German government has not issued a decree officially announcing the new exchange rate. It should be pointed out that, inasmuch as Satellite currencies are not utilized in international settlements,** the principal effect .of such a revision in East Germany will be felt in its system of domestic accounting for foreign trade transactions. A revision of the foreign exchange rate alone, unaccompaned by revisions in the domestic price structure, will have no effect on the net amount of price equali- zation funds which must be covered. in the national budgets Neverthe- less, this de facto \"devaluation\" of the eastmark automatically reduces the \"profits\" on individual import transactions as well as the \"losses\" on individual exports. The \"devaluation\" also should lessen somewhat the tendency of East German exporters and importers, so prevalent in the past, to claim no responsibility in any given transaction for the wide difference between the eastmark equivalent of the foreign exchange received or paid out and the value of the product at domestic prices, the total amount of which had to be equalized through the domestic accounting system, With the elimination to a large extent of the dis- tortions created by an artificial exchange rate, the remaining differ- ences should now be more representative of variations in the East Ger- man domestic price structure. The values of exports and imports in terms of the new foreign trade mark will more closely approximate average hark-dollar ratios, thus making it more feasible for East German planners to determine to what extent domestic costs are incon- sistent with average industrial costs in other countries, * This is not to say that the real values of the east and westmark .are equal inasmuch as the official rate for the westmark considerably undervalues it. ** In intra-Bloc trade the ruble represents the clearing unit of account whereas in Bloc trade with the Free World clearing accounts are based on the currency of the Western partner involved or on the \"hard\" currency of some third country, e.g., British pounds or U.S. dollars. :L4 March 1960 CIA/RR CB 60-16 Page 2 CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2000/06/07 : CIA-RDP79TO1003A000900160001-4 Approved For Release 2000/06/07 : CIA-RDP79TO1003A000900160001-4 CONFIDENTIAL There are at present no indications that the other European Satellites are planning similar moves to adopt for commericial pur- poses the non-commercial rates established during 1957-58 or any other more realistic valuation of their currencies. It is, never- theless, possible that these steps will be taken eventually. In view of current attempts throughout the Communist Bloc to measure the profitability and efficiency of foreign trade activities,:.it would appear that simplification of their domestic accounting practices alone would be sufficient justification for similar changes in their exchange rates.
