        "text": "I might dream of a day of final triumph of central banking; that is when central banks are so successful in achieving and maintaining price and financial stability that currencies will be freely interchangeable at stable exchange rates. Then, as in Europe today, we could discuss merging independent monetary authorities into a collective central bank designed to preserve and institutionalize a stable common currency.\n\nThat is not for my lifetime—nor for any of yours.\n\nPaul A. Volcker (1990)\n\nIn recent years, many countries have approved legislation granting their central banks autonomy from political power. Within a statutory mandate to pursue price stability, these banks are free to formulate and implement monetary policy. Typically, they have also been freed from the burden of financing the public deficit, given the right to control the supply of base money, and shielded from external pressures by provisions stipulating that they cannot “seek or take instructions” from either governmental or other bodies.1 In essence, they have been made “independent” in the pursuit of price stability.\n\nIn the world of many currencies within which central banks are doomed to operate in our lifetimes, central bank independence depends on the constraints existing foreign exchange arrangements place on monetary policy. These constraints may be powerful enough to define the monetary policy stance completely, leaving no room for “independent” monetary decisions. At a very abstract level, this situation is easy to explain. Monetary policy (for instance, the setting of the nominal money supply) determines the value of domestic money in terms of domestic goods. Foreign exchange rate policy (for example, the setting of the nominal foreign exchange rate) determines the value of domestic money in terms of foreign goods. These two values of money must eventually coincide. In the absence of free capital mobility, the identity between monetary and exchange rate policies is likely to hold only in the very long run. But when capital movements are unrestricted—a condition toward which many countries are now moving—monetary and exchange rate policies become inextricably linked, even in the short run.\n\nThe reciprocal relationship between monetary and foreign exchange policies and, eventually, their identity, is generally accepted at the theoretical level but often ignored at the institutional level. Even the new central bank laws, which give these banks full control of monetary policy, allow the government to control major aspects of foreign exchange policy, such as the choice of the foreign exchange regime, the definition of parities, and the setting of guidelines for foreign market intervention.\n\nThis paper maintains that a central bank cannot be fully independent in the pursuit of price stability as long as the government controls foreign exchange policy. Thus, if a country has opted for central bank independence, exchange rate policy decisions (except for choosing the type of regime, but not the parities) should be made by the central bank. If a country wishes to limit central bank independence, the appropriate solution is to allow a formal government override of both monetary and exchange rate policy decisions, as has been done in New Zealand. This solution is preferable to the alternative—separating monetary and exchange rate policy responsibilities—because it avoids potential conflicts that could result from inconsistency among policy instruments.\n\nThe paper first reviews different “models” of exchange rate policy legislation, and notes that, in general, governments retain major responsibilities in this area. It then shows that monetary and exchange rate policies are not independent of each other and discusses how the separation of monetary and exchange rate policy responsibilities affects central bank independence. Next it addresses the arguments that have been used in favor of this separation, while the final part discusses the degree of latitude that independent central banks should be allowed in their foreign exchange responsibilities.\n\nOne caveat is necessary. The paper focuses on formal responsibility for exchange rate policy. Obviously, political and economic realities differ from formal legislative provisions, for several reasons. For example, the most important foreign exchange (as well as monetary policy) decisions, regardless of formal responsibilities, will (and usually should) be made after consultations between the government and the central bank. Nevertheless, the formal assignment of responsibilities is important, as conflicts may arise between different economic policy decision makers.\n\nAppendix I\n\nThe Genesis of Article 109 of the Maastricht Treaty\n\nArticle 109 of the Maastricht Treaty splits responsibilities for exchange rate policy between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Council.34 Given the attention that this article has received during the debate on central bank independence, it is worthwhile to review its content and genesis. Note that the Treaty refers to the European Community (EC) rather than the European Union (EU).\n\nResponsibilities for the five components of exchange rate policy singled out in Table 1 are assigned as follows.\n\nExchange rate regime: the EC Council of Ministers will determine the exchange rate regime; more specifically, it will have the power to conclude “formal agreements on an exchange-rate system for the ecu in relation to non-Community currencies.” The Council can conclude such agreements “after consulting the ECB in an endeavor to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability,” and the decision must be unanimous.\n\nChange of parities: the Council will also decide on changes in parities and determine when the system should be abandoned. The decision can be made by a qualified majority according to the proposal of the European Commission or the ECB (again after consulting the ECB).\n\nExchange rate policy directives: by the vote of a qualified majority, the Council can “formulate general orientations for exchange-rate policy” These general orientations “shall be without prejudice to the primary objective … to maintain price stability.” Such decisions also require prior consultation with the ECB.\n\nFormulation and implementation of intervention policy: the ECB will be responsible for conducting foreign exchange operations, subject to the “general orientations” set by the Council.35\n\nIn sum, the Council is responsible for choosing the regime (including setting and changing parities) and for formulating general orientations for exchange rate policy. The ECB is responsible for formulating and implementating exchange rate policy in line with those general orientations. The question of whether these provisions are consistent with monetary policy independence for the ECB has been discussed at length. It has been argued, for instance, that the ECB will be protected by the required consultations and that the Council will be constrained by the objective price stability. It has also been noted that the decision to enter into exchange rate agreements must be unanimous. On the other hand, skeptics have stressed that it is not clear who will decide whether exchange rate policy decisions are consistent with the pursuit of price stability and that the consultations are not sufficient to guarantee central bank independence. Most likely, only future economic developments can determine the degree of independence the ECB will have.\n\nIt is worth stressing that Article 109 is the outcome of a compromise whose genesis can easily be traced back in the documents leading to the Maastricht Treaty. A separation of monetary and exchange rate policy responsibilities was already envisaged in the Werner Report, which assigned the choice of the regimes and parities to a “political” center, and of monetary policy and intervention policy to central banks (Baer and Padoa-Schioppa, 1989). The Delors Report reiterated this suggestion but also introduced the concept of the foreign exchange “directives” that would guide intervention policy in a floating exchange rate regime. More specifically, while arguing that intervention “would be made on the sole responsibility of the ESCB,” the Delors Report added that intervention would have to be “in accordance with Community exchange rate policy” (paragraph 60), thus implicitly stating that that policy would not be formulated by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).\n\nThis point—namely the degree of exchange policy independence in a floating rate system—was heavily debated. The Monetary Committee of the European Community (1990) recognized the fact that members agreed the choice of the regime and parities should be left to the EC political authority. However, it also noted the conflict between the majority view, which argued that strategic decisions on exchange rate policy should be made at the political level, and a minority view, which supported full central bank independence in a floating rate regime (paragraphs 8 and 28–33). A disagreement along the same lines emerges in the initial (August 1990) draft of the Treaty prepared by the European Commission (1991, paragraph 2.4), and also in the November 1990 report of the Committee of Central Bank Governors (point f) putting forward the draft statutes of the ECB.36\n\nWhile these official documents do not detail the composition of the “majority” and “minority,” the Bundesbank was clearly included in the latter. As argued by Tietmeyer (1991, p. 184): “… the ESCB can only be successful if it retains full control over the instruments that are necessary for conducting monetary policy. These include instruments not only for domestic monetary policy, but also for external monetary policy. Hence, the ESCB must also be given sole responsibility for exchange market intervention against currencies outside the system.”37\n\nWhile the Bundesbank’s view was eventually defeated, the constraints placed on the ECB in the conduct of intervention policy were milder than those initially envisaged.38 Thus, a compromise solution eventually prevailed and, according to some (Thygessen, 1991, p. 478), made the ECB more independent in terms of intervention policy than the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan—but possibly not as independent as the Bundesbank.39"
