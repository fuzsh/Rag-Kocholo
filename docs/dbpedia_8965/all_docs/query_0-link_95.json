        "text": "126. Memorandum Prepared in the Central Intelligence Agency1\n\nPA M–79–10210\n\nEAST GERMANY: THE CHILLY WINDS OF SPRING (U)\n\nEast Germany recently has initiated a number of repressive measures against dissident intellectuals, some consumers, and Western correspondents. The official pretext was unfair treatment by the Western press of such issues as East German hard-currency shops and the quality of everyday life in East Germany. The government’s actions were no doubt intended to address more deep-seated problems, such as its failing ability to manipulate the populace in support of its policies. And they were further intended to send a message to West Germany that, detente and ostpolitik notwithstanding, East Germany has no intention of modifying its foreign and domestic policies. The government probably felt the need to send such a message to the West because of recent speculation in the Western press, fueled in part by the statements and travels of West German Social Democratic parliamentary leader Herbert Wehner, [Page 392] that a process of German reunification may be in its infancy. [classification not declassified]\n\nThe Regime’s Measures\n\nEast Germany now requires that its citizens convert hard currency into bank certificates before these funds can be used to purchase quality goods in special shops (Intershops). The change acknowledges that the two-currency economy that has developed in East Germany, with the West German mark being the preferred currency, had to be curtailed. The dual-currency system makes special benefits available to those who can acquire foreign funds—many times through transactions outside the official economy. The persons thus rewarded by the system are, by and large, not those the regime wishes to be rewarded—workers and party and government officials. The change in the system was not as restrictive as many East Germans feared, but it will bring home to those who profit from the dual system that the privileges they enjoy are strictly at the sufferance of the regime. [classification not declassified]\n\nThe new measures are designed to reduce the growing number of informal contacts between East and West Germans. The West German media, which reaches a substantial number of East Germans through radio and television broadcasts, has long been a nuisance to the authorities because of their accurate descriptions, collected from local residents, of economic, social and political conditions in East Germany. To reduce these contacts, the regime has enacted controls requiring Western journalists to provide the authorities 24 hours notice and a detailed itinerary of travel plans outside East Berlin. Other restrictions include a ban on interviews with East German citizens without prior government approval and a requirement that, “in carrying out their journalistic work, journalists must abstain from slandering or defaming the GDR, its state organs, and its leading figures, as well as states allied with the GDR.” These restrictions are more severe than those of any other East European state, including the Soviet Union. [classification not declassified]\n\nThe restrictions on foreign travel by dissidents have prevented several regime critics, including East Germany’s most prominent author, Stefan Heym, from traveling to West Germany to attend lectures and conferences. The government also has devised a new legal scheme, apparently to be applied on a selective basis, for punishing authors who publish their work in the West. According to this newly devised legal principle, a citizen who publishes in the West and receives compensation is guilty of violating foreign currency regulations, the penalty for which is a 10 year prison term. This law probably is the basis of the recently instituted criminal proceedings against Robert Havemann, a prominent critic. The measures against dissidents will not halt their activities or the feed-back of information into the country about them, but they will have an inhibiting effect. [classification not declassified]\n\n[Page 393]\n\nThe Timing\n\nThere are probably several reasons why the regime chose to act at this time, despite the risk to its efforts to expand economic ties with the West. At the root is its determination to maintain its identity as a separate German state capable of controlling its internal affairs. The regime may have believed that this had to be emphasized at this time to the West Germans, whose ostpolitik is credited by some for the conditions the East Germans find uncomfortable. Inter-German intercourse has increased at the economic and personal level to a point where some West German quarters could speculate last month about the possibility of eventual German reunification. Such speculation is intolerable to the regime, which this year will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the creation of the East German state, because it raises the fundamental question of the permanence of that state and, thus, the obligation of its citizens to give it their allegiance. [classification not declassified]\n\nThe measures were, no doubt, cleared with the USSR, which has ruled out German reunification. The political concessions made by East Germany to the West—and West Germans, in particular—in the 1970s have, in part, been in support of the USSR’s policy of detente with the West and improved relations with West Germany. The USSR may not be loath to see speculation on the reunification question because it emphasizes to the East German leaders—and to the Poles—their ultimate reliance on the USSR for the perpetuation and integrity of their state, and, thus, their obligation to follow Soviet dictates. But the Soviets would not wish reunification to become a credible notion in East Germany, where it strikes a responsive chord with the public and, perhaps, even with some in the bureaucracy. The Soviets could even have been responsible for the timing of the East German moves. [classification not declassified]"
