        "text": "The demise of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) came as a surprise to most western observers. For historians of modern Europe, its disappearance remains remarkable for at least two reasons. First, East Germany has ceased to exist in an era when new states are constantly being born. Since the French Revolution unleashed the power of national self-determination as an ordering principle more than 200 years ago, new sovereign states have continued to emerge across the globe, whether through the breakup of multiethnic and colonial empires or the dissolution of pan-Slavic states in eastern Europe. Illiberal governments have been swept aside, often with the result that new states have been cast out of imperial entities by the centrifugal force of cultural attachment. In the history of European political sovereignty during the twentieth century, the particular has triumphed over the universal. Except in the case of the GDR. Against the tide of European history, the GDR has gone from sovereign state (East Germany) to regional designation (eastern Germany). In this sense, the story of the GDR's absorption by a larger polity is a tale of modern state-building told in reverse.\n\n16 If the planned economies of eastern Europe were inspired by a compelling critique of the social injustice and alienation produced by capitalism, they never devised a viable alternative to the market. On the contrary, the failure of Marxist economic theory to provide a convincing economic—as opposed to a sociological—account of the price discovery process forced planners to concoct a variety of schemes aimed at translating the social values that animated these regimes into everyday prices. But none of these pricing schemes really replaced market-clearing prices, much less “transformed” the sociological category of value into an economic one. As a result, the methods by which planners arrived at prices were imprecise and vulnerable to manipulation. Whether it was using units of labor-time to measure “socially necessary” labor, deploying ill-defined concepts, such as “robotic,” to permit producers to demand higher prices for machine tools, or employing social “need” to distinguish between luxury and basic goods, these pricing mechanisms scrambled financial information and economic incentives, resulting in waste, pollution, and productivity losses. In addition to these price-oriented critiques, however, I am arguing that the problems of production and consumption in Soviet-style economies began and ended with the communist attempt to suspend the coercive power of money—to cancel out its function as a provider of information about the relative scarcity of resources and thereby to banish the threat of bankruptcy. Thus, prices in the planned economy were not simply distorted reflections of the party's political preferences, but were also expressed in a currency that, like a dead language, had lost its power to communicate the material decisions made by economic actors. As a result, producers operated without regard to consumers, while consumers were confronted by a currency that possessed little purchasing power and a pricing system that contradicted communist promises of a rational and socially just distribution of resources.\n\n24 BArchB, DN10, 1898, VEB Mansfeld Kombinat Wilhelm Pieck, “Abschlußbericht,” February 23, 1988, 1–3. The import-substitution amounted to 1.115 million West German marks in 1986-87, or less than half of the 2.241 million DM economic planners had hoped for—not counting various unanticipated costs, such as the purchase of electric generators. As a result, planners estimated that it would require more than six years for the GDR's investment to start paying off rather than the three years that had made the project attractive to begin with.\n\n68 I realize that my emphasis on the link between economics and politics, and more specifically the role played by the travel law in bringing down the Wall, does not conform to most stories told of the East German revolution. Based on my own research, however, I would argue that the prevailing narrative about the East German revolution, which was first articulated by observers such as Timothy Garton Ash and has been repeated by neo-liberal commentators such as Lothar Kettenacker, relies more on romantic attachments to transhistorical notions of freedom than on empirical evidence about the actual circumstances of the revolution. See Ash, The Magic Lantern, and Kettenacker, Lothar, Germany 1989: In the Aftermath of the Cold War (Harlow, U.K.: Pearson Education Limited, 2009)Google Scholar. For a critique of neo-liberal assumptions about economics and politics and a very different interpretation of the East German revolution, see Zatlin, The Currency of Socialism, epilogue."
