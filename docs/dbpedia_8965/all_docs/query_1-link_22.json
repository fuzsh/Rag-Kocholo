        "text": "East Germany's premier Tuesday rejected West Germany's proposal to move quickly to a common currency and said talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to move the two Germanys any closer toward unity.\n\nCommunist Premier Hans Modrow said before his discussion with the West German leader that his coalition government did not authorize him to approve measures aimed at monetary union during his two-day visit.East German leaders rejected Bonn's call for quickly making the powerful West German mark the official currency in their troubled nation, fearing that West Germany is pushing the reunification process too quickly.\n\nBut West German leaders consider a common currency the only means of giving East Germans immediate confidence in their future. In the East German city of Leipzig on Monday night, demonstrators demanded an immediate currency union or said they would leave for West Germany - joining an estimated 2,000 daily who have left for the West.\n\nModrow was accompanied by 17 Cabinet members and at least 10 other experts and advisers for the West German talks aimed at determining how the two nations should eventually be reunified and how East Germany can be kept financially afloat in the meantime.\n\nThe Communist premier instead pressed for West German financial aid of $9 billion to tide over the ailing East German economy until the country's first free elections March 18.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration unveiled its \"2-plus-4 plan\" after weeks of secret diplomacy, in an effort to clear the way for uniting East and West Germany on terms acceptable to the Soviet Union.\n\nBy the time the plan surfaced in Ottawa, Canada, Monday, State Department officials were describing Moscow as \"quite interested\" in the scheme.\n\nSecretary of State James A. Baker III held an unannounced meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, their second of the day, and the two spoke for about 10 minutes Tuesday. Baker was returning to Washington later from a nine-day trip that also took him to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nThree forces are at work in the no-longer-secret operation:\n\n- A conviction Moscow is beginning to share with Washington that unification is inevitable.\n\n- A Western desire to keep Germany in NATO.\n\n- Anxiety within the countries whose people suffered at Germany's hands in World War II.\n\nThe plan is called \"2-plus-4\" because East Germany and West Germany, joined by the Big Four allied powers of World War II, would work out the formula for the new and stronger state."
