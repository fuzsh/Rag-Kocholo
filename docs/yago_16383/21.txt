Alan and Arlene Alda have been married for almost six decades, and there's a sweet story behind their longtime love.

During a Wednesday morning visit to TODAY, the actor explained how one disastrous dessert brought them together.

"The hostess of the evening had made a rum cake, and she put it on the refrigerator to cool," Alda recalled. "The refrigerator shook, and the cake fell off the refrigerator and hit the floor."

It was a party moment that separated the casual diners from those desperate for dessert.

"Arlene and I were the only two people who went in with spoons and ate it off the floor," he said with a smile. "That's how you know. When two people eat a cake off the floor, that's it for life."

There's no arguing that point. In fact, Alda seems certain today's daters could learn a thing or two from him and Arlene.

"All this matchmaking on the Internet, and they ask them questions â€” just toss a cake on the floor and see who goes for it," he suggested.
