        "text": "Alan Alda plays a divorce attorney in Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” — but off-screen he’s been married to the same woman for 60 years.\n\n“Did you ever contemplate divorce in your six-decade marriage?” former Vanity Fair veteran Krista Smith recently asked Alda on her Netflix podcast. “No, but I’m sure my wife contemplated murder,” Alda, 83, figured. He married his wife, Arlene, in 1957.\n\nAlso on the “Present Company” podcast, Alda opens up about acting with Parkinson’s. He first revealed he has the disease in a “CBS This Morning” interview last year.\n\n“Sometimes I don’t know when I’m shaking … I came back from an interview, I said to Arlene, ‘It’s amazing. I must be getting better. I didn’t shake at all.’ And then I looked at video, and I didn’t realize I was shaking,” he said. But “as long as it doesn’t interfere with the audience’s focus on the scene and the character, it’s just an attribute.” He pointed out, “Lionel Barrymore acted for 15 or 20 years in a wheelchair … all his characters were wheelchair-bound and nobody thought twice about it. I’m playing Ray Donovan’s psychiatrist on ‘Ray Donovan,’ and when they realized I had Parkinson’s, they said, ‘You mind if we write that into the script?’ … But now I’m doing scenes where the character I’m playing has a worse tremor than I have, and I have to fake it.”"
