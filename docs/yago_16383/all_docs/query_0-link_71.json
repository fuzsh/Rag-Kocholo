        "text": "There is a fundamental contradiction or opposition at the core of your personality, but it does not shatter your integrity. However, it causes your inner world to be complex, divided, or even torn, without ever being totally dissociated, because every thought and action is a source of unification. As a result, intellectually you are a talented syncretist. You are able to see the link between heterogeneous and diverse elements which do not appear to be related in the least. You can bring about surprising reconciliation, create unexpected bonds, combine beliefs which seem mutually incompatible. Your imaginative powers also flow from the division in your psyche and are evidenced by inspirations, visions, and abilities which exceed the context of logic and reasoning. You allow yourself to be guided by irrational phenomena like foreshadowing or premonitions, which well up from the depths of your being. You are more of a medium than an intuitive, because intuition requires a clear consciousness of reality. You are borne along by currents and tides of knowledge and live in symbiosis with forces which overwhelm you. In fact, it is because of this relative passivity that you are more or less a medium, because you wish merely to perceive what surrounds you; you have no wish to impose your will. Although this attitude endows you with great potential for productivity, it may also become dangerous, if you find yourself overpowered by forces you can never totally control. You tend to perceive things as undifferentiated; you do not always see the world as an organized, structured, hierarchical entity. Instead, you are sensitive to energy flows, to invisible forces which you perceive and try to interpret. Your consciousness knows no bounds, and you do not feel confined by either space or time. But the image of the infinite imprinted on your imagination has a tendency to manifest itself with a lack of definition, in most of your thoughts and acts. In relation to other people, you usually demonstrate warmth and humanism. You are a fairly pleasant companion, although your sensitivity can be annoying at times. You tend to identify with your friends to a great degree, instead of remaining apart and empathetic. In fact, you are capable of losing yourself in another person at times. You should take time to reflect upon the quality of what you bestow on others and on whom you bestow it. You would doubtless come to the conclusion that your devotion is motivated by guilt feelings; your giving is a way of escaping from yourself, and your broad tolerance sometimes merely hides a weak character. Your basic aptitude for compassion could inspire\n\nArlene Alda finds her work rewarding. Daily life and routine activities are excellent sources of self-fulfillment for her.\n\nArlene Alda’s personality develops mainly in the shelter of the home. She is attached to her family, her heritage, and her past.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Cancer (the Crab), while the sun was passing through the sign of Pisces (the Fish). Both are ruled by the same element, Water, which indicates that your personality will show a certain cohesiveness. A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your character profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension: Sensitivity – Emotionalism – Imagination – Pliancy – Eccentricity – Humility and reserve – Savings and thrift – Idealism – Obstinacy – Intuition – Premonition. Because you are intuitive, impressionable, and inclined to be romantic, you will luxuriate in the feeling of things long before you actually possess them. However, your hypersensitivity exposes you to negative emotions as well as positive ones. You are capable of energy and effort in your professional life, but in other areas you might lack determination. Be sure that your taste for mystery, intuition, philosophy, and imagination do not obscure the demands of the real world. In short, you might want to be careful to moderate your romantic tendencies.\n\nBorn on the three and one-half day after the full moon rose, you are said to be a “full moon” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration gives you an objective, rational, and lucid character. However, since the moon is opposite the sun at the time of the full moon, your objective tendencies are balanced by a more idealistic penchant. Because the forces pull you in two different ways – one toward dreams, the other toward reality – you may be aware of some inner contradictions which are causing practical and social difficulties for you. At times, you are too demanding of yourself or others, comparing them to an ideal, whereas at others, you are too nonchalant and indulgent about life. You vacillate between two poles. One is elitist; the other is more earthy and perhaps vulgar at times. The result is a multifaceted self. Generally speaking, your monthly energy flow is strongest at the time of the full moon. You would be wise to schedule intensive work phases at that time, as well as ambitious and demanding projects.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of her personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of my partner.\n\nArlene Alda’s moon is located at 29° VIRGO. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 20/30° VIRGO or PISCES.\n\nArlene Alda would be well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal she cherishes of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with her ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nArlene Alda’s Venus is located at 11° PISCES. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 5/17° PISCES or VIRGO.\n\nArlene Alda thinks that this type of partner would complement her perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill her ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, her ideal partner would resonate lastingly with her own psychic projections of her ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nArlene Alda is sentimentally romantic. She has a powerful sensitivity and can be somewhat cloying. In love, she yields completely; she enjoys merging with the person she loves. Although it is not easy for her to express the depth of her feelings, she displays them through her limitless devotion and generosity. This type of partner, endowed with great psychic sensitivity, would be an especially good match for her. They would share a taste for mystery and secrecy, keen artistic and musical pleasures, a fertile imagination, and spiritual aspirations.\n\nArlene Alda’s planet Mars is located at 6° Virgo. Her ideal match is a partner with Venus at 0/12° Virgo or PISCES."
