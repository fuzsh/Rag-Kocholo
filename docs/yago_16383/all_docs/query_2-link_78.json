        "text": "“These two gave me faith.”\n\nOn a recent evening after Christmas, my husband and I were walking home along Broadway to our corner at 64th when we crossed paths with an affectionate older couple, walking with arms around each other at waist and shoulder. The man tall and lanky, the woman quite petite, were chatting away as they snuggled and laughed. It was a cold night, so entwined couples might not have been a rarity, but these two gave me faith. The love birds were long-time married couple Alan and Arlene Alda.\n\n— Maria Hartmann\n\n“So do I.”\n\nSo many encounters over the years when I was living on the UWS, but the best came with my old mini-poodle, Pringle. I think my favorite was when I brought Pringle home from a walk. We stopped to talk to the doorman and in came Whoopi Goldberg to visit a resident. While the doorman was calling up, Whoopi started petting Pringle’s lower back. I mentioned that he loves to have “his butt” massaged. Without missing a beat she said, “So do I.”\n\n— Beth Senko (UWS 1998-2018)\n\n“There’s Hope!”\n\nOn a very windy Columbus Avenue last week, I watched what I believed to be a brother (11-ish) and sister (9-ish)) walking home from school weighed down by oversized backpacks. Despite the burden and the biting wind, they kept up a rather animated conversation that I only caught snippets of as the wind whistled by. My impression was that it was a fairly earnest exchange laced with the occasional laughter. As lots of loose newspapers caught by the wind swirled around us on the sidewalk, a page got caught on the toe of the boy’s sneaker. Instead of pushing it off and moving on, he grabbed it off his shoe, carried it for a block and a half until he found a paper recycle bin on the corner, and dropped it in without missing a step or a word of the conversation. What struck me was how natural the action was to him. Someone taught him well.\n\n— Nancy Cocola\n\nUWS Encounters is a weekly column of stories set on the Upper West Side, written by WSR readers.
