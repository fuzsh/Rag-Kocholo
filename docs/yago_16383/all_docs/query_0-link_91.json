        "text": "Growing up in the 1940s, Arlene Alda’s universe was not much larger than the corner of the Bronx where her family lived. Their cramped apartment was one of 96 split between twin six-story buildings that largely housed immigrant Jewish families attempting to get a foothold onto the American dream.\n\nFrom a kid’s point of view, it was utopia, she said, recalling a childhood spent playing in safe streets, knowing all shop proprietors and neighbors by name and—with the advent of television— the excitement of gathering to watch the small screen with the few families well off enough to own their own sets.\n\nArlene, a highly accomplished author, photographer and musician, has always wondered what it was about the Bronx that produced generations of residents who have grown up to become major forces in the arts, science, business, athletics and commerce.\n\nIn conversation with her famous husband Alan during the 26th Annual Bank of America Festival of Arts, Books and Culture of the Katz JCC, she shared her insight.\n\n“Mary Higgins Clark put her finger on it,” mused Arlene. “There are only three places in the world that have a ‘the’ in front of their names: The\n\nVatican, the\n\nHague and the\n\nBronx.”\n\nClark, an author and Bronx native, was one of 64 she interviewed for her book “Just Kids from The Bronx,” in which the Bronx’s most accomplished sons and daughters recall their childhoods. The subjects all grew up in New York City’s northern-most borough from the 1920s to the 1990s. They range from 93-year-old Carl Reiner to 23-year-old Erik Zeidler, a naturalist who as a high school student hunted snapping turtles in the Bronx River. In between are the likes of Al Pacino, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Colin Powell and Bobby Bonilla.\n\nThe Nov. 8 headlining event, which had to be moved from the Katz JCC to Temple Beth Sholom to accommodate the huge crowd, provided an evening of nostalgia. Prompted by Alan asking who hailed from the Bronx, about a third of the audience raised their hands. Others, including a large contingent from Philadelphia, described similar halcyon experiences from their childhoods.\n\n“I included people from different ethnic groups, different professions, and covering decades when the Bronx was not the Garden of Eden it was like when I was a kid,” she said. “(Some of them) grew up in the worst of times and still talked about having innocent childhoods in many ways, but in other ways, not so innocent.”\n\nThe book of recollections includes her own (We lived in a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. Mother, father, older sister, older brother, the mutt fox terrier Spotty, and me). But like many distinguished Bronx natives, Arlene did not stay in the borough long after childhood.\n\nA Fulbright scholar, she realized her dream of becoming a professional clarinetist, playing in the Houston Symphony with Leopold Stokowski. After marrying Alan, an up-and-coming actor not from the Bronx, she retired from professional music to raise the couple’s three daughters and changed career paths by becoming an award-winning photographer and author.\n\nThe couple’s decision to settle in Leonia, NJ, a suburb of New York City, rather than in Los Angeles, was largely shaped by her Bronx upbringing.\n\n“One of the reasons we moved to Leonia was because we wanted a place where our kids could walk to school and where they could play with their playmates just like in the Bronx,” she said.\n\nFor Sandy Schorr, a Mount Laurel resident whose family moved from Brooklyn to the East Bronx when she was 10, hearing Arlene’s recollections was like mining her own memories.\n\n“All that she said about going out for fresh air, that was my childhood,” said Schorr, 84. “We played potsi (hopscotch) and stick ball. And any story you’ve ever heard about everyone being in a house to watch television, that was our living room, especially on Friday nights when the fights were on.” ."
