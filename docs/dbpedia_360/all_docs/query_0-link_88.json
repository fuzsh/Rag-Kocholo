        "text": "A systematic revision of the fossil beaked whales (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Ziphiidae) Ziphirostrum du Bus, 1868 and Choneziphius Duvernoy, 1851 from the Neogene of Antwerp (Belgium, southern margin of the North Sea Basin) is undertaken. It is based on several rostra and partial skulls from the collection of the Institut royal des Sciences naturelles de Belgique. From the previous conclusions about those taxa, dating from the beginning of the 20th century and suggesting only one species in each genus, Mioziphius (Ziphirostrum) belgicus and Choneziphius planirostris, the following modifications are proposed. The genus Ziphirostrum includes three species: Z. marginatum, Z. turniense, and Z. recurvus n. comb. Basicranial fragments and teeth of Z. marginatum are described for the first time. Besides the most common species Choneziphius planirostris, the species C. macrops is identified from Antwerp and the east coast of North America. A new genus and species Beneziphius brevirostris n. gen., n. sp. is described on the basis of two specimens characterized by a short and pointed rostrum. Two partial skulls are placed in Ziphiidae aff. Eboroziphius, a genus known from the east coast of North America. The genus name Aporotus is restored, with a large species A. recurvirostris, and a smaller species A. dicyrtus. A parsimony analysis including fossil and extant ziphiid taxa shows a sister-group relationship between Choneziphius + (Tusciziphius + Ziphius) and Ziphirostrum + Beneziphius n. gen. The poorly known Aporotus seems more closely related to Choneziphius + (Tusciziphius + Ziphius), but additional morphological information is needed. © Publications Scientifiques du Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle,.\n\nIncluding at least 15 extant species, the beaked whale genus Mesoplodon (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Ziphiidae) is by far the most species-rich cetacean genus. Such a high diversity reflects one or several pulses of radiation, most likely involving a sexual selection mechanism affecting shape, size, and position of mandibular tusks. However, the tempo of this diversification is currently poorly constrained due to the scarce fossil record. Based on the reassessment of five partial skulls discovered in Antwerp (north of Belgium), a new fossil species of the genus Mesoplodon, M. posti, sp. nov., is described. Only the second fossil species of the genus currently recognized, it is characterized (among other features) by: transverse sections of the rostrum higher than wide (a feature proposed to correspond to the presence of lower tusks more posterior than the apex of the mandibles); the presence of a basirostral groove at the rostrum base; pentagonal joined nasals; the posterior projection of the premaxilla in the vertex shorter than the nasal backward; and a strong transverse compression of the frontals behind the nasals. Our phylogenetic analysis results in M. posti being nested among extant species of Mesoplodon. Palynological study of the organic-walled phytoplankton from sediment retained in cranial cavities of several specimens indicates an age between 4.86 and 3.9 Ma (Zanclean, early Pliocene). Constituting the first temporally well-constrained fossil species of Mesoplodon, M. posti provides an upper calibration point for the beginning of the radiation(s), having produced a surprisingly high number of extant species in this genus.\n\nAlthough modern porpoises (Phocoenidae, Odontoceti, Cetacea) occupy most oceanic regions of the world, their fossil record outside the Pacific Ocean remains extremely scarce. Based on a partial skull from lower Pliocene layers (Kattendijk Formation, Zanclean, 5-4.4 Ma) of the Antwerp harbour, a new genus and species of fossil phocoenid, Brabocetus gigaseorum gen. et sp. nov., is described. The new taxon is diagnosed by a unique combination of characters including an anterolateraly widely-open antorbital notch, the anteromedial sulcus being shorter than the posteromedial sulcus, the frontal boss being longer than wide, pronounced asymmetry of the vertex, and the possible presence of an additional longitudinal sulcus across the premaxillary eminence. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that B. gigaseorum is not closely related to extant phocoenids; it is included in a clade comprising most north-west Pacific fossil species, two north-east Pacific fossil species, and the only previously described North Sea fossil species Septemtriocetus bosselaersi. Considering the paleobiogeographic distribution of phocoenids, an early Pliocene arrival from the North Pacific to the North Sea may be correlated to the early opening of the Bering Strait and migration via the Arctic. The presence of S. bosselaersi in younger deposits (Piacenzian) of the southern margin of the North Sea Basin could be the result of either a second dispersal event, or of local speciation in the North Sea, whereas an additional trans-Arctic migration from the North Pacific lead to the present occupation of the North Atlantic and North Sea by the phylogenetically distantly related harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena.\n\nExtant beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are deep diving suction feeders and none of them can be considered as a permanent resident of the shallow southern North Sea. The rich fossil record of ziphiids from Neogene deposits of this area is thus surprising. However, chronostratigraphic intervals of most recorded taxa remain poorly constrained, preventing from assessing the evolution of their local diversity. In this work, we describe a new ziphiid cranium from the Neogene of Antwerp (north of Belgium), which is attributed to Caviziphius aff. C. altirostris. Sediment samples were extracted from 15 fossil ziphiid cranial remains from this area (including the one described herein), referred to eight species. The samples were analysed for their palynological content, leading to improved chronostratigraphic ranges for several species. Seven to eight ziphiid species from the southern North Sea, all from the Messapicetus clade, are proposed to originate from a Serravallian to Tortonian (late Middle to early Late Miocene) interval, and three to six more precisely from the mid- to late Tortonian. Added to the fossil record of other regions, these results point to a Late Miocene radiation of members of the Messapicetus clade, possibly related to the synchronous worldwide decline of several hyper-longirostrine dolphin clades."
