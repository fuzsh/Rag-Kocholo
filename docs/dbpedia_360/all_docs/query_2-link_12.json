        "text": "MPA DN5 Bolt Action Muzzle Brake\n\nThread – 5/8-24 or 3/4-24 tpi\n\nCaliber – 6.5mm or smaller\n\nMaterial: Black Nitrided High Tensile Strength Steel\n\nFunction: Significantly Reduces Recoil while keeping the muzzle down\n\nDesign: The multiple blast ports redirects propellent gases to counter recoil from the firearm. The unique port pattern also directs the gas upward, forcing the muzzle down. This allows the shooter to see trace and bullet impact/misses for more concise follow up shoots.\n\nThese brakes are specifically designed to be used in PRS style competitions when extreme recoil reduction is required during the firing of the rifle to allow the shooter to stay on target for follow up shots. Using our special testing system, we have tweaked the design to achieve a 63% reduction in recoil.\n\nThe jam nut collar system utilizes a design that allows the shooter to jam the nut and brake against each other in the appropriate position on the muzzle of the rifle. There are 2 machined flats that are used to both level the brake body as well as interfacing with an adjustable wrench for installation of the brake. It not only eliminates the need for ground shims, but also aligns the ID of the brake perpendicular with the shoulder of the barrel, minimizing initial point of impact shift."
