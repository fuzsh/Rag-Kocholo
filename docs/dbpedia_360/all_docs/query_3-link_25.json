        "text": "Originally posted by Allen Brown\n\nHi\n\nMy notes on the DN3s haven't been updated in some places since the mid-1990s but here's what I can add.\n\nDN-3/1A: was destroyed in P. Revson's accident at Kylami. Though, there are rumors the tub was retrieved, re-built and used in S. Africa locally. You can dismiss those rumours. The wrecked chassis was taken back to Phil Kerr’s workshop and chopped up.\n\nDN-3/2A: used during the '74 seson by JP Jarier, then re-numbered DN-3/2AB for the early part of the '75 season, then destroyed by M. Wilds in the ShellSport series in '76. This car is currently with D. Nichols in Salinas, CA ready for refurbishment. I know who Springett sold the wreck to and I'd love to know how it got back from Leeds to Don.\n\nDN-3/3A: used during the '74 season by B. Redman, B. Roos and T. Pryce. Damaged by T. Pryce, sent to the shop, acquiring plate /5A and used as the spare the remainder of the season. Currently in FL with plate /5AB. I believe this car was Springett's spare but was not used as such and went with DN3/5A to Phil Bennett (Nov 1977) and others before being bought by John McCartney in late 1981. DN3/3A then went to Peter Bloore (early 1982), David Ham (later in 1982), John Brannigan (Sep 1983), via Graham Eccles to Alan Ratcliffe (end of 1983) then to David McLaughlin about 1990. It went to Italy in Feb 1992 but I don't have any further note of it.\n\nDN-3/4A: used as the teams (short wheel-base) spare by JP Jarier and T. Pryce. Currently in Italy. Don't mistake cars for chassis plates. This car was written off by Pryce in Austria but the chassis plate from 4A was then used on a rebuild of 3A because the chassis plate belonging to 3A was then on 5A. The actual car 4A was rebuilt as a show car and went to Jarier. It passed to Marcel Alquier in the mid-1980s then to Ron Murphy then Roy Caitlen (1987) then Roger Cowman then George Stauffer. I think this is the car that went to Alex Polsinello in Toronto in 1996 but my notes refer me to a letter I had from Alex that I now can't find. I have no idea what chassis plate would be on this car now.\n\nDN-3/5A: used to rebuild /3A, driven by T. Pryce the remainder of the '74 season, used as a spare in the ShellSport series, then sold to collectors in England, Canada and the US. Springett - Bennett as above and raced 1978/79. Later to Brian Redman who was just establishing himself as a dealer then to Bradburn then McCartney. 3A and 5A then parted company and 5A went to Harrison (I think) who entered it for John Brindley, then Rod Tolhurst and then Bill Hall and Roger Cowman and the end of 1985. It went to George Stauffer (this is well before 4A did the same trip) in 1986. In Oct 1991, it passed to Dave Swigler in Florida. Dave still had it in 2002.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nIf you have Alex's old car then I think the chassis plate may well be right. That car was just a collection of used bits when it went to Jarier and Ron Murphy later spent years trying to put it straight. Don't read too much into exactly what you find attached to it. Also, bear in mind that 4A never raced so the lack of marking underneath would be consistent.\n\nAllen\n\nHi Allen\n\nOriginally posted by T54\n\nCould not find the belt buckle yet in my junk, but I have found that original DN1 sketch. Note that the wing is placed far forward, above the engine, as I was asked to do (don't even ask).\n\nThe car did not exist then, it was just a project, so I was described the general lines and then corrected when wrong. Barry Crowe and Tony were present, as well as another fellow of which I can't recall the name.\n\nThe drawing is dated 01/72. It is just pencil and ballpoint because I had to do it on spot while they were waiting, and they were in a hurry!\n\nI got it back a couple of years later from Barry and this is when I got the belt buckle too. I did not know that some people would be interested in an old belt buckle but after I posted that, I got a dozen inquiries from NF readers! It's not even gold plated...\n\nThe size is 14\" X 10\".\n\nRegards,\n\nT54\n\n]"
