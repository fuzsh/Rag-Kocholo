        "text": "Distances between DN5 and all other UK Postcodes / Post Codes\n\nThe table below shows the distances between DN5 and all the other postcodes in the UK. The distances between the post codes are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate but they should be pretty reliable. The distances are displayed both in kilometers (km) and in miles and the distances between the postcodes are also offered 'as the crow flies' i.e. point to point from DN5 and by road mileage i.e. driving distances to DN5 etc. These distances by road mean that you can work out the carbon footprint of your journeys from postcode DN5 to other postcodes i.e. your destinations.\n\nContact postcode.org.uk if you want to buy postcode data (e.g. sql data / csv data), journey distance calculator scripts (e.g. php scripts, asp scripts etc), trip cost calaculators for your website, online delivery charge calculators, web functionality to work out courier costs or call-out fees or if you want a desktop software application designing that uses postcode info to determine distances, charges or coverage areas. Basically, if your project uses postcodes then postcode.org.uk would be a sensible first contact!\n\nClicking a hyperlinked post code in the postcode column will display a table like the one below but for the selected postcode area. The table is presented in ascending alphabetical postcode order but you can also view the postcodes sorted by distance from postcode DN5 - viewing the postcode info in this way means that you can easily find all the postcodes that are within say a 50 miles radius of your target postcode!\n\nPostCodes\n\nDistance as the crow flies\n\nDistance by Road\n\nPostcode AB22 DN5 411 km 255 miles 513 km 318 miles Postcode AB23 DN5 413 km 256 miles 516 km 320 miles Postcode AB30 DN5 377 km 234 miles 471 km 292 miles Postcode AB31 DN5 403 km 250 miles 503 km 312 miles Postcode AB32 DN5 409 km 254 miles 511 km 317 miles Postcode AB33 DN5 422 km 262 miles 527 km 327 miles Postcode AB34 DN5 409 km 254 miles 511 km 317 miles Postcode AB35 DN5 409 km 254 miles 511 km 317 miles Postcode AB36 DN5 425 km 264 miles 531 km 330 miles Postcode AB37 DN5 444 km 276 miles 555 km 345 miles Postcode AB38 DN5 458 km 284 miles 572 km 355 miles Postcode AB41 DN5 431 km 268 miles 538 km 335 miles Postcode AB42 DN5 443 km 275 miles 553 km 343 miles Postcode AB43 DN5 462 km 287 miles 577 km 358 miles Postcode AB44 DN5 467 km 290 miles 583 km 362 miles Postcode AB45 DN5 466 km 289 miles 582 km 361 miles Postcode AB51 DN5 425 km 264 miles 531 km 330 miles Postcode AB52 DN5 433 km 269 miles 541 km 336 miles Postcode AB53 DN5 450 km 279 miles 562 km 348 miles Postcode AB54 DN5 447 km 278 miles 558 km 347 miles Postcode AB55 DN5 458 km 284 miles 572 km 355 miles Postcode AB56 DN5 473 km 294 miles 591 km 367 miles Postcode AL1 DN5 207 km 129 miles 259 km 161 miles Postcode AL10 DN5 208 km 129 miles 260 km 161 miles Postcode AL2 DN5 210 km 130 miles 262 km 162 miles Postcode AL3 DN5 203 km 126 miles 254 km 157 miles Postcode AL4 DN5 205 km 127 miles 256 km 159 miles Postcode AL5 DN5 199 km 124 miles 249 km 155 miles Postcode AL6 DN5 201 km 125 miles 251 km 156 miles Postcode AL7 DN5 205 km 127 miles 256 km 159 miles Postcode AL8 DN5 204 km 127 miles 255 km 159 miles Postcode AL9 DN5 210 km 130 miles 262 km 162 miles Postcode B1 DN5 128 km 79 miles 160 km 99 miles Postcode B13 DN5 131 km 81 miles 164 km 101 miles Postcode B14 DN5 134 km 83 miles 167 km 104 miles Postcode B15 DN5 129 km 80 miles 161 km 100 miles Postcode B17 DN5 131 km 81 miles 164 km 101 miles Postcode B2 DN5 127 km 79 miles 159 km 99 miles Postcode B21 DN5 126 km 78 miles 157 km 97 miles Postcode B23 DN5 121 km 75 miles 151 km 94 miles Postcode B24 DN5 122 km 76 miles 152 km 95 miles Postcode B25 DN5 127 km 79 miles 159 km 99 miles Postcode B26 DN5 127 km 79 miles 159 km 99 miles Postcode B27 DN5 129 km 80 miles 161 km 100 miles Postcode B28 DN5 131 km 81 miles 164 km 101 miles Postcode B29 DN5 133 km 83 miles 166 km 104 miles Postcode B3 DN5 127 km 79 miles 159 km 99 miles Postcode B30 DN5 134 km 83 miles 167 km 104 miles Postcode B31 DN5 137 km 85 miles 171 km 106 miles Postcode B32 DN5 133 km 83 miles 166 km 104 miles\n\nYou can move through the table of postcode distances in km and miles from the one postcode to the next / previous set of UK postcodes using the navigation links below...\n\nUK Postcodes 1 to 50 of 2482 First Previous Next Last\n\nIf this page about postcodes has been interesting then here are some other related keywords that you may like to enter into your favourite search engine...\n\nWhatever your postcode project is or requires...
