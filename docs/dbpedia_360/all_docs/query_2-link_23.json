        "text": "Abbie Marchant\n\nI'll start by saying just how warm and welcoming it feels. The staff were all friendly, polite and helpful, as well as being thoughtful and considerate. As we were there to reminisce and share stories of my beloved grandma following her funeral earlier in the day, everything was perfect, even down to the buffet. Can't fault this venue at all\n\nAdrian Marchant\n\nMum passed away recently, and I had instruction to hold the wake at Sprotbrough Country Club. I made contact with Paul by phone, to book a preferred date and time, to coincide with Mums funeral. Then, in the New Year I went in person to make the arrangements, I was helped through the booking, and what arrangements would be available, with Janine. Obviously I had no idea how many people would be attending, but elected for their minimum number of 40 ( on the day it was 37 ). I was offered a service of having a selection of photos projected on a large screen, I think my wife managed 75 photos on to a memory stick, and Paul did a marvellous job of getting them scrolling through during the course of the wake. The buffet was excellently supplied and set out, and was prepared exactly as requested, all freshly prepared on the day. Everybody in attendance agreed it was excellent. A big thank you Paul & Janine. (Very sorry Paul, but I’ve edited Dave out, don’t know where that came from) and thank you again\n\nLiam Mccarthy\n\nWhat can I say about this place and the owners there, absolutely fantastic service from start to finish. Couldn't of wished for a better place for my boys chrisrening. Such polite people, food was amazing, place spotless and very warming venue. Such a nice touch having the photos on the big screen for everyone to see, if you are thinking of a function book here, would recommend 11/10 to anyone. Thank you again"
