        "text": "Suburb of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England\n\nVillage in England\n\nCusworth is a village and suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, located 2 miles (3.2 km) to its north-west within the civil parish of Sprotbrough and Cusworth and the City of Doncaster, with a population of 4,728.[a] It is home to Cusworth Hall, an 18th century country house, and its surrounding parkland. Some buildings in the old village can be dated back to the 16th century.[1]\n\nThe village's historic cottages, semi-rural location and situation on the edge of a plateau has led to it sometimes being referred to as ‘a piece of the Cotswolds in Yorkshire’.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCusworth was first recorded as Cuzeuuorde in the Domesday Book of 1086. By 1560, the original manor house and estate belonged to Sir Christopher Wray, who was once Speaker of the House of Commons, and his family. By 1669, it was owned by the Wrightson family. William Wrightson decided in 1740 to build the current Cusworth Hall, which existed as a home for the family until 1961 when the council purchased it and converted it into a museum, which still operates today.[3]\n\nCusworth has since expanded and is now a relatively affluent commuter village housing professionals working in Doncaster.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe civil parish of Sprotbrough and Cusworth had a population of 12,134 at the 2011 census.[4]\n\nCusworth is interwoven with the suburb of Scawsby to the north, and separated from Bentley and Scawthorpe to the east by the A638 dual carriageway. Cusworth Park and agricultural land separate it from Sprotbrough to the south. To the west is rural countryside protected from development by the South and West Yorkshire Green Belt; the A1(M) motorway (Doncaster Bypass) is not far from the village's western edge. Cusworth Lane is the main thoroughfare through Cusworth running from the A638 and eventually connecting with Sprotbrough. It bypasses the ancient village centre, which is accessed via a narrow one-way system.\n\nAmenities\n\n[edit]\n\nIt hosts several local amenities, including a convenience store, public house (The Mallard) and an Italian restaurant. Within the grounds of Cusworth Hall, there is a bistro and a microbrewery.[5] Larger amenities can be found in neighbouring suburbs.\n\nCusworth is served by the 41 bus service between the Doncaster Frenchgate Interchange and Scawsby, operated by First.[6] The nearest railway stations are in Bentley and Doncaster.\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nAs part of the Roman Ridge council ward, which also includes Scawsby, it elects two councillors to the City of Doncaster Council. The Cusworth ward of Sprotbrough and Cusworth Parish Council elects four councillors to the parish council and covers the north of Cusworth. The Stadium ward currently has two councillors on the parish council and covers the southern half of Cusworth.[7]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nCusworth Hall\n\nEntry to the boathouse on the Upper Fish Pond\n\nFootpath to Sprotbrough with the Upper Fish Pond visible\n\nStables in Cusworth Park\n\nThe Mallard public house\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nListed buildings in Sprotbrough and Cusworth\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
