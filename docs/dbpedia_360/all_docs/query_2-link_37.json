        "text": "Distances between DN5 and other UK Postcodes / Post Codes\n\nThe table below shows the distances between DN5 and all the other postcodes in the UK. The distances between the post codes are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate but they should be pretty reliable. The distances are displayed both in kilometers (km) and in miles and the distances between the postcodes are also calculated 'as the crow flies' i.e. point to point from DN5 postcode and by road mileage i.e. driving distances to DN5 etc. The distances from DN5 to the other postcodes are shown in ascending distance order so you effectively have the postcodes within a radius from postcode DN5... this means the postcode data is ideal for \"where's my nearest\" functionality that some websites require.\n\nContact postcode.org.uk if you want to buy postcode data (e.g. sql data / csv data), journey distance calculator scripts (e.g. php scripts, asp scripts etc), trip cost calaculators for your website, online delivery charge calculators, web functionality to work out courier costs or call-out fees or if you want a desktop software application designing that uses postcode info to determine distances, charges or coverage areas. Basically, if your project uses postcodes then postcode.org.uk would be a sensible first contact!\n\nClicking a hyperlinked post code in the postcode column will display a table like the one below but for the selected postcode area. The table is presented in order of ascending distance from postcode DN5 to the other UK postcodes. As an alternative view of the data you can also see alphabetically sorted list of postcodes and the distances between them and DN5 postcode - rather than scraping the data from multiple pages (and the free version of the postcode data is only about 80% complete anyway!) why not contact us and let us know what you are after?\n\nPostCodes\n\nDistance as the crow flies\n\nDistance by Road\n\nPostcode DN5 DN5 0 km 0 miles 0 km 0 miles Postcode DN1 DN5 3 km 2 miles 4 km 2 miles Postcode DN4 DN5 5 km 3 miles 6 km 4 miles Postcode DN3 DN5 7 km 4 miles 9 km 5 miles Postcode DN12 DN5 7 km 4 miles 9 km 5 miles Postcode DN6 DN5 7 km 4 miles 9 km 5 miles Postcode S64 DN5 10 km 6 miles 12 km 7 miles Postcode DN7 DN5 11 km 7 miles 14 km 9 miles Postcode DN11 DN5 11 km 7 miles 14 km 9 miles Postcode S63 DN5 11 km 7 miles 14 km 9 miles Postcode WF9 DN5 12 km 7 miles 15 km 9 miles Postcode S66 DN5 14 km 9 miles 17 km 11 miles Postcode S62 DN5 14 km 9 miles 17 km 11 miles Postcode S72 DN5 15 km 9 miles 19 km 11 miles Postcode S73 DN5 15 km 9 miles 19 km 11 miles Postcode S65 DN5 15 km 9 miles 19 km 11 miles Postcode DN8 DN5 17 km 11 miles 21 km 14 miles Postcode S74 DN5 18 km 11 miles 22 km 14 miles Postcode S61 DN5 18 km 11 miles 22 km 14 miles Postcode WF8 DN5 18 km 11 miles 22 km 14 miles Postcode S60 DN5 18 km 11 miles 22 km 14 miles Postcode S71 DN5 19 km 12 miles 24 km 15 miles Postcode DN9 DN5 19 km 12 miles 24 km 15 miles Postcode WF7 DN5 19 km 12 miles 24 km 15 miles Postcode S70 DN5 20 km 12 miles 25 km 15 miles Postcode WF11 DN5 20 km 12 miles 25 km 15 miles Postcode DN10 DN5 20 km 12 miles 25 km 15 miles Postcode S81 DN5 22 km 14 miles 27 km 17 miles Postcode S9 DN5 22 km 14 miles 27 km 17 miles Postcode S75 DN5 23 km 14 miles 29 km 17 miles Postcode S35 DN5 23 km 14 miles 29 km 17 miles Postcode S5 DN5 23 km 14 miles 29 km 17 miles Postcode WF10 DN5 24 km 15 miles 30 km 19 miles Postcode WF6 DN5 24 km 15 miles 30 km 19 miles Postcode S13 DN5 24 km 15 miles 30 km 19 miles Postcode DN14 DN5 24 km 15 miles 30 km 19 miles Postcode WF4 DN5 26 km 16 miles 32 km 20 miles Postcode S12 DN5 26 km 16 miles 32 km 20 miles Postcode S1 DN5 26 km 16 miles 32 km 20 miles Postcode S2 DN5 26 km 16 miles 32 km 20 miles Postcode S80 DN5 27 km 17 miles 34 km 21 miles Postcode WF2 DN5 27 km 17 miles 34 km 21 miles Postcode S6 DN5 27 km 17 miles 34 km 21 miles Postcode WF1 DN5 27 km 17 miles 34 km 21 miles Postcode YO8 DN5 28 km 17 miles 35 km 21 miles Postcode DN22 DN5 29 km 18 miles 36 km 22 miles Postcode S10 DN5 29 km 18 miles 36 km 22 miles Postcode S8 DN5 30 km 19 miles 37 km 24 miles Postcode LS25 DN5 30 km 19 miles 37 km 24 miles Postcode LS26 DN5 30 km 19 miles 37 km 24 miles\n\nYou can move through the table of postcode distances in km and miles from the one postcode to the next / previous set of UK postcodes using the navigation links below...\n\nUK Postcodes 1 to 50 of 2482 First Previous Next Last\n\nIf this page about postcodes has been interesting then here are some other related keywords that you may like to enter into your favourite search engine...\n\nWhatever your postcode project is or requires...
