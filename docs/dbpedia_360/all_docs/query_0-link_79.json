This paper presents actual measurements of direct solar radiation in Abu Dhabi (24.43°N, 54.45°E) with the existing meteorological conditions encountered during the measurement throughout the year. High resolution, real-time solar radiation and other meteorological data were collected and processed. Daily and monthly statistics of direct solar radiation were calculated from the one-minute average recorded by a Middleton Solar DN5-E Pyroheliometer. The highest daily and monthly mean solar radiation values were recorded as 730 and 493.5W/m2, respectively. The highest one-minute average daily solar radiation was recorded as 937W/m2. In addition to direct beam radiation, the daily average clearness indexes, surface temperature variations, wind speeds and relative humidity variations are discussed. When possible, direct beam radiation and some meteorological data are compared with corresponding data of the 22-year average of NASA's surface meteorology and solar-energy model. The measured data (direct beam radiation and meteorological) are in close agreement with the NASA SSE model with some discrepancy.",
