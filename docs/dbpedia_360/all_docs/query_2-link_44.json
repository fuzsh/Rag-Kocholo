        "text": "If you are thinking of moving to or anywhere in the postcode, you will want to know what the area is really like, not estate agents telling you what you want to hear. On this page we give you the information no one else publishes. You are not going to find out who the local councillor is here, but you will find out if the area is a street crime hotspot or a ghetto of unemployment or if living in postcode is likely to send you on a downward spiral of ill health. The information everyone wants to know before moving home. It might save you staking the place out of night to see if kicks off after dark with anti-social behaviour and your down time is constantly interrupted by the sound of Police sirens as they race to the 10th reported crime in the street that day.\n\nWhere possible, why try and present statistics down to the Local Super Output Area (LSOA) level or local district council level if not possible. This is the smallest area for which the government publishes statistics. It is roughly equivalent to around 1500 people or a few roads. We use the ‘best fit’ LSOA that includes the postcode and the roads surrounding . Let’s get down to the nitty-gritty and see what the post code really is like:"
