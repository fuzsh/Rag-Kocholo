        "text": "Entrée Gold Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia on July 19, 1995 and continued under the laws of the Yukon Territory on January 22, 2003. On May 27, 2005, Entrée Gold Inc. changed its governing jurisdiction from the Yukon Territory to British Columbia by continuing into British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The principal business activity of Entrée Gold Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Company\"), is the exploration of mineral property interests. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenues from its operations and is considered to be in the exploration stage.\n\nAll amounts are expressed in United States dollars, except for certain amounts denoted in Canadian dollars (\"C$\").\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently earns no operating revenues. Continued operations of the Company are dependent upon the Company's ability to secure additional equity capital or receive other financial support, and in the longer term to generate profits from business operations. Management believes that the Company has sufficient working capital to maintain its operations for the next 12 months.\n\nMarch 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Ann Mason Project (a) $ 39,323 $ 36,853 Other (b) 918 861 $ 40,241 $ 37,714\n\nTitle to mineral property interests involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of certain claims as well as the potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral property interests. The Company has investigated title to its mineral property interests and, except as otherwise disclosed below, to the best of its knowledge, title to the mineral property interests remains in good standing.\n\nThe Company's two principal assets are the Ann Mason project (the \"Ann Mason Project\") in Nevada and its interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi LLC joint venture property in Mongolia (Note 6).\n\na) Ann Mason, Nevada, United States\n\nThe Ann Mason Project is defined by a series of both unpatented lode claims on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management, and title to patented lode claims. The project area includes the Ann Mason and the Blue Hill deposits, several early-stage copper porphyry targets including the Blackjack IP, Blackjack Oxide, Roulette and Minnesota targets, and the Minnesota and Shamrock copper skarn targets.\n\nCertain of the unpatented lode claims peripheral to the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits are leased to the Company pursuant to a mining lease and option to purchase agreement (\"MLOPA\") with a Nevada limited liability company. Under the MLOPA, the Company has the option to purchase the claims for $500,000, which, if exercised, will be subject to a 3% net smelter returns (\"NSR\") royalty (which may be bought down to a 1% NSR royalty for $2 million). The MLOPA also provides for annual advance minimum royalty payments of $27,500 which commenced in 2011 and will continue until the commencement of sustained commercial production. The advance payments will be credited against future royalty payments or the buy down of the royalty.\n\nIn September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement whereby the Company may acquire an 80% interest in certain unpatented lode claims to the southwest of the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits. In order to acquire its interest, the Company must: (a) incur expenditures of $1,000,000, make cash payments of $140,000 and issue 85,000 common shares of the Company within three years (completed); (b) make aggregate advance royalty payments totalling $375,000 between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the agreement ($100,000 of which has been paid); and (c) deliver a bankable feasibility study before the tenth anniversary of the agreement.\n\nIn February 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (\"Sandstorm\") whereby the Company granted Sandstorm a 0.4% NSR royalty over certain of the unpatented lode claims, including the claims covering the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits, in return for an upfront payment of $5 million (the \"Sandstorm NSR Payment\") which was recorded as a recovery to acquisition costs.\n\nIn addition, certain of the patented lode claims peripheral to the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits are subject to a 2% NSR royalty.\n\nb) Other Properties\n\nThe Company also has interests in other properties in Mongolia (Shivee West), Australia (Blue Rose), the United States (Lordsburg) and Peru (Lukkacha and Cañariaco NSR royalty).\n\nEntrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, Mongolia\n\nThe Company has a carried 20% joint venture interest in two of the Oyu Tolgoi deposits in the South Gobi region of Mongolia (the \"Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property\"). The Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property is comprised of the eastern portion of the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence, which hosts the Hugo North Extension copper-gold deposit, and all of the Javhlant mining licence, which hosts the Heruga copper-gold-molybdenum deposit. The Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences were granted by the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia (\"MRAM\") in October 2009. Title to the two licences is held by the Company.\n\nIn October 2004, the Company entered into an arm's-length Equity Participation and Earn-In Agreement (the \"Earn In Agreement\") with Turquoise Hill Resource Ltd. (\"Turquoise Hill\"). Under the Earn-In Agreement, Turquoise Hill agreed to purchase equity securities of the Company, and was granted the right to earn an interest in what is now the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. Most of Turquoise Hill's rights and obligations under the Earn-In Agreement were subsequently assigned by Turquoise Hill to what was then its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oyu Tolgoi LLC (\"OTLLC\"). The Government of Mongolia subsequently acquired a 34% interest in OTLLC from Turquoise Hill.\n\nOn June 30, 2008, OTLLC gave notice that it had completed its earn-in obligations by expending a total of $35 million on exploration of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. OTLLC earned an 80% interest in all minerals extracted below a sub-surface depth of 560 metres from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property and a 70% interest in all minerals extracted from surface to a depth of 560 metres from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. In accordance with the Earn-In Agreement, the Company and OTLLC formed a joint venture (the \"Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV\") on terms annexed to the Earn-In Agreement.\n\nThe portion of the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence outside of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, Shivee West, is 100% owned by the Company, but is subject to a right of first refusal by OTLLC (Note 5).\n\nThe conversion of the original Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant exploration licences into mining licences was a condition precedent to the Investment Agreement (the \"Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement\") between Turquoise Hill, OTLLC, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto International Holdings Limited. The licences are part of the contract area covered by the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement, although the Company is not a party to the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement. The Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences were each issued for a 30 year term and have rights of renewal for two further 20 year terms.\n\nOn February 27, 2013, MRAM delivered notice (the \"Notice\") to the Company advising that the Company is temporarily restricted from transferring, selling or leasing the Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences. While the Company was subsequently advised that the temporary transfer restriction on the mining licences will be lifted, it has yet to receive official notification of the lifting of the restriction.\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV had expended approximately $27.8 million to advance the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. Under the terms of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV, OTLLC contributed on behalf of the Company its required participation amount charging interest at prime plus 2% (Note 7).\n\nJoint Venture Investment  Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV\n\nThe Company accounts for its interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV - as a 20% equity investment. The Company's share of the loss of the joint venture was $46,295 for the period ended March 31, 2016 (March 31, 2015 - $26,146) plus accrued interest expense of $68,847 for the period ended March 31, 2016 (March 31, 2015 - $64,289).\n\nThe Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV investment carrying value at March 31, 2016 was $110,547 (December 31, 2015 - $148,717) and was recorded in Other Assets.\n\nIn February 2013, the Company entered into an equity participation and funding agreement (the \"2013 Agreement\") with Sandstorm whereby Sandstorm provided an upfront deposit (the \"Deposit\") of $40 million. The Company will use future payments that it receives from its mineral property interests to purchase and deliver metal credits to Sandstorm, in amounts that are indexed to the Company's share of gold, silver and copper production from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. Upon the delivery of metal credits, Sandstorm will also make the cash payment outlined below. In addition, the 2013 Agreement provided for a partial refund of the Deposit and a pro rata reduction in the number of metal credits deliverable to Sandstorm in the event of a partial expropriation of Entrée's economic interest, contractually or otherwise, in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property.\n\nOn February 23, 2016, the Company and Sandstorm entered into an Agreement to Amend, whereby the Company refunded 17% of the Deposit ($6.8 million) (the \"Refund\") in cash and shares thereby reducing the Deposit to $33.2 million for a 17% reduction in the metal credits that the Company is required to deliver to Sandstorm. At closing on March 1, 2016, the parties entered into an Amended and Restated Equity Participation and Funding Agreement (the \"Amended Sandstorm Agreement\"). Under the terms of the Amended Sandstorm Agreement, the Company will purchase and deliver gold, silver and copper credits equivalent to:\n\n 28.1% of Entrée's share of gold and silver, and 2.1% of Entrée's share of copper, produced from the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence (excluding Shivee West); and\n\n 21.3% of Entrée's share of gold and silver, and 2.1% of Entrée's share of copper, produced from the Javhlant mining licence.\n\nUpon the delivery of metal credits, Sandstorm will make a cash payment to the Company equal to the lesser of the prevailing market price and $220 per ounce of gold, $5 per ounce of silver and $0.50 per pound of copper (subject to inflation adjustments). After approximately 8.6 million ounces of gold, 40.3 million ounces of silver and 9.1 billion pounds of copper have been produced from the entire Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property the cash payment will be increased to the lesser of the prevailing market price and $500 per ounce of gold, $10 per ounce of silver and $1.10 per pound of copper (subject to inflation adjustments). To the extent that the prevailing market price is greater than the amount of the cash payment, the difference between the two will be credited against the Deposit (the net amount of the Deposit being the \"Unearned Balance\").\n\nThis arrangement does not require the delivery of actual metal, and the Company may use revenue from any of its assets to purchase the requisite amount of metal credits.\n\nUnder the Amended Sandstorm Agreement, Sandstorm has a right of first refusal, subject to certain exceptions, on future production-based funding agreements. The Amended Sandstorm Agreement also contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations, warranties, covenants and events of default. The initial term of the Amended Sandstorm Agreement is 50 years, subject to successive 10-year extensions at the discretion of Sandstorm.\n\nIn addition, the Amended Sandstorm Agreement provides that the Company will not be required to make any further refund of the Deposit if Entrée's economic interest is reduced by up to and including 17%. If there is a reduction of greater than 17% up to and including 34%, the Amended Sandstorm Agreement provides the Company with ability to refund a corresponding portion of the Deposit in cash or common shares of the Company or any combination of the two at the Company's election, in which case there would be a further 17% reduction in deliverable metal credits. If the Company elects to refund Sandstorm with common shares of the Company, the value of each common share shall be equal to the volume weighted average price for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the 90th day after the reduction in Entrée's economic interest. In no case will Sandstorm become a \"control person\" under the Amended Sandstorm Agreement. In the event an issuance of shares would cause Sandstorm to become a \"control person\", the maximum number of shares will be issued, and with respect to the value of the remaining shares, 50% will not be refunded (and there will not be a corresponding reduction in deliverable metal credits) and the remaining 50% will be refunded by the issuance of shares in tranches over time, such that the number of shares that Sandstorm holds does not reach or exceed 20%. All shares will be priced in the context of the market at the time they are issued.\n\nIn the event of a full expropriation, the remainder of the Unearned Balance after the foregoing refunds must be returned in cash.\n\nFor accounting purposes, the Deposit is accounted for as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and the original Deposit was recorded at the historical amount of C$40,032,000. As a result of the Amended Sandstorm Agreement, the deferred revenue amount was adjusted to reflect the $6.8 million Refund which was recorded at the foreign exchange amount at the date of the Refund resulting in a net balance of C$30,865,190. This amount is subject to foreign currency fluctuations upon conversion to US dollars at each reporting period.\n\nThe $6.8 million Refund was paid with $5.5 million in cash and the issuance of $1.3 million of common shares of the Company. On March 1, 2016, the Company issued 5,128,604 common shares to Sandstorm at a price of C$0.3496 per common share pursuant to the Agreement to Amend."
