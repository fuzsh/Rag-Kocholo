        "text": "The Boat Inn has served the local community of Sprotborough for centuries, dating back as far as 1652 where one of our most famous guests, Sir Walter Scott was said to write a tract of the novel Ivanhoe. After suffering damages from flooding, the pub was recently restored to its traditional best, with the utmost care taken to maintain the original interior style.\n\nOur menus are full of hearty favourites and country pub classics, as well as our seasonal dishes, and weâll be ready with a well-stocked bar, including cask ales, fine wines and British gin to suit very taste - which will taste all the better when enjoyed either in our beautiful gardens or by our crackling log fires.\n\nWhether youâre out walking your dog or just exploring the local area, thereâs always plenty to do around The Boat Inn.\n\nThe Boat Inn is a 17th Century pub on the grassy banks of the River Don, next to Sprotbrough Lock. We offer character, history, distinctive surroundings and some lovely riverside walks from the doorstep."
