(202) 622-2960 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 9,2001 Contact: Steve Posner (202) 622-2960 TREASURY TESTS NEW INTERNET TAX PAYMENT FEATURE FOR BUSINESSES The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced today that they are conducting a pilot program to test a new Internet-based application for businesses to pay federal taxes on-line. The new Internet version of Treasury's Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) will allow businesses to enroll in the system, securely make federal tax payments, and receive electronic payment history -- all through the Internet. \"EFTPS-OnLine is a more convenient and cost-efficient way for businesses to pay Federal taxes,\" said Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. \"This program represents another important step in Treasury and IRS efforts to improve service to American taxpayers.\" \"With the introduction of Internet payment capabilities, we look forward to increased participation in the use of electronic tax payments,\" said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. \"Initial reaction to the concept of using the Internet has been very positive, with business owners reporting that moving EFTPS to the Internet would help them consolidate their tax business with all other business applications.\" EFTPS-OnLine will make it possible for businesses to schedule future payments through the Internet and cancel payments if necessary. The Internet site will provide on-line help and how-to pages with step-by-step instructions. EFTPS-OnLine will use the strongest available security features and encryption technology to ensure taxpayer privacy and protection. After evaluating the results ofthe pilot program, Treasury and the IRS plan to offer the feature to all businesses in the U.S. and abroad, as well as individuals who are required to make estimated quarterly payments. \"Allowing businesses to pay their taxes online is another example of how Treasury has adopted new technologies to make the government work better,\" said Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Gary Gensler. EFTPS-OnLine builds on the existing EFTPS program which already serves about 3 million businesses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Instead of the traditional method of using paper coupons and checks, taxpayers can pay by phone, by personal computer using software, or through their financial institution. Since the inception of EFTPS in 1996, more than 180 million transactions have been processed, totaling $5 trillion. -30L8-1111 Far press releases, speeches, public schedules and official biographies, call our 24-hour fax line at (202) 622-2040 ·U.S. Government Pnntrnq Offrce. 1998· 619·559 January 9, 2001 Statement of the Parties Following the Meetings on California's Electricity Situation The Governor of California and the bipartisan leadership of the State legislature met with major generators (including qualifying facilities), marketers, utilities, regulators, and Federal officials, to discuss the electricity situation in California. Recognizing the importance of the issue, as laid out in the Governor's State of the State speech last evening, the participants agreed on the need for cooperation to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy of California utilities, and assure the long-term regularity of market conditions. Crucial elements of a solution include: • The development of approaches to promote long-term purchases of electricity, possible by the State, from generators at an attractive fixed rate. • The willingness of generators, qualifying facilities, and marketers to provide on a short-term basis forbearance of amounts owed by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison in the context of the framework of a comprehensive longterm solution. • The need to find satisfactory approaches with respect to the obligation accumulation of the utilities for the purchase of power, consistent with contractual obligations, and which are in the public interest. • Cooperation to better match supply and demand in the short and long term. • Review of the existing qualifying facilities payment structures. The parties acknowledge that the problem must be addressed while taking into account the regional nature of the market. To advance the process further, working groups will be convened Wednesday to address addition technical details. The principals will reconvene this weekend.

These standards, known as Circular 230, would be revised to include stricter requirements for rendering tax shelter opinions. \"Abusive tax shelters are the most serious compliance problem in the U.S. tax system,\" Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said. \"These proposed measures would deter the purveyance of these shelters, protect the integrity of our tax system, and ultimately reduce the tax burdens of honest taxpayers.\" The proposed regulations would modify existing standards of practice. In particular, the proposed regulations would revise standards for opinions rendered by tax practitioners regarding tax shelter transactions. These opinions give prospective investors an assurance that the purported tax benefit of a shelter is likely to be sustained if challenged by the IRS and may be offered in an effort to provide a potential investor comfort that penalties will not be imposed if the transaction is successfully challenged. The new rules would strengthen the standards regarding factual due diligence and legal analysis. In particular, they would help ensure that practitioners analyze and address carefully whether a particular transaction has a legitimate business reason and is not being done solely for the tax benefits, and that they consider and analyze all potentially relevant judicial doctrines and anti-abuse rules. In addition, the proposed regulations would: • • • prohibit certain contingent fee arrangements where the practitioner's fee is based on the tax benefit being sustained; require that practitioners in firms who have responsibility for a firm's tax practice take reasonable steps to put in place adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the Circular 230 standards; and, authorize the IRS to issue a public reprimand, or censure, in cases warranting a sanction less severe than suspension or disbarment. 18-1119 For press releases, speeches, public schedules and official biographies, call OU1\" 24-hour fax line at (202) 622-2040 ·u.s. Government Pfll1tlng Office. 1998 - 619-559 Secretary Summers announced last February that the Circular 230 opinion standards would be revised to complement Treasury Department and IRS efforts to combat the proliferation of abusive tax shelters. The proposed regulations were completed following a period of public comment and input from the tax practitioner community, including the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants A public hearing on the proposed regulations is scheduled for May 2, 200 I. The regulations will take effect only upon publication in final form in the Federal Register The Treasury Department has also issued regulations requiring the reporting and registration of tax shelters, shut down many tax shelter transactions that have come to Treasury's attention, and proposed legislation to further halt the marketing and promotion of shelters. In addition, the IRS has created an Office of Tax Shelter Analysis to coordinate its anti-shelter activities and stepped up its efforts to curb abusive trusts based in tax havens. -30- PUBLIC DEBT NEWS Department of the Treasury • Bureau of the Public Debt • Washington, DC 20239 TREASURY SECURITY AUCTION RESULTS BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT - WASHINGTON DC CONTACT: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 10, 2001 Office of Financing 202-691-3550 RESULTS OF TREASURY'S AUCTION OF 10-YEAR INFLATION-INDEXED NOTES Interest Rate: Series: CUSIP No: STRIPS Minimum: 3 1/2% A-2011 9128276R8 $1,000 Issue Date: January 16, 2001 Dated Date: January 15, 2001 Maturity Date: January 15, 2011 TIIN Conversion Factor per $1,000 10.054861623 1/ High Yield: 3.522% Adjusted Price: 99.818 All noncompetitive and successful competitive bidders were awarded securities at the high yield.

In 1996, the President brought together a diverse group of manufacturers, consumer groups, labor and rights organizations and universities to form the Apparel Industry Partnership. Out of this partnership, the Fair Labor Association was created, a coalition organization dedicated to ensuring that products purchased by Americans consumers were not made in overseas sweatshops. President Clinton has highlighted the importance ending abusive child labor in several State of the Union addresses. The President has also signed ILO Convention 182, which prohibits the worst forms of child labor and has established the United States as the largest contributor to international efforts to eliminate abusive child labor.

A joint report released today also indicated that the Board and the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision (agencies) will consider ways to enhance their use of voluntarily issued subordinated debt in supervisory monitoring. The Board and the Secretary, however, chose not to recom mend that Congress make subordinated debt issuance mandatory at this time. The report to Congress, required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, called for continued research and, most importantly, continued evaluation offinancial institution supervisors' experience in using information derived from voluntarily issued subordinated debt. Virtually all of the largest banking organizations already issue subordinated debt. The agencies monitor subordinated debt yields and issuance patterns in evaluating the condition of large depository institution organizations. The study found that existing evidence supports the use of subordinated debt to encourage market discipline. But it said that the net benefits of a mandatory policy are not clear enough to justify such a policy. Going forward, if additional evidence suggests that requiring institutions to issue subordinated debt is appropriate, either the Board or the Secretary may recommend legislation. Copies of the report, The Feasihility and Desirability (~fMandatOly 5/llhordinated Deht, are available on'the web sites of the Board, \\V\\Vwfederalreserve.govlboarddocs/RplCongress/, and the Treasury Department, www.uslreas.gQX ### Media Contacts: Federal Reserve: Treasury: LS-1122 Dave Skidmore (202) 452-2955 Bill Buck (202) 622-2960 DEPARTlVIENT OF THE TREASURY NEWS 1REASURY OFFICE OF PUBliC AFFAIRS • 1500 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, N.W. • WASIDNGTON, D.C .• 20220. (202) 622-2960 FOR IMNIEDIATE RELEASE January 16, 2001 Contact: Public Affairs (202) 622-2960 NEW MONEY LAUNDERING GUIDANCE ISSUED The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Department of State, today announced the issuance of new guidance to help US financial institutions avoid transactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign official corruption. The guidance, issued in furtherance of our National Money Laundering Strategy, encourages U.S. financial institutions to apply enhanced scrutiny to their private banking and similar high dollar-value accounts and transactions where such accounts or transactions may involve the proceeds of corruption by senior foreign political figures, their immediate family or close associates. The guidance provides a set of suggested account establishment and maintenance procedures designed to help institutions obtain appropriate information on accounts held by such persons, as well as a list of potentially suspicious transactions that will often warrant enhanced scrutiny. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said, \"Foreign official corruption undermines US. efforts to promote democratic institutions and economic development around the world .. This guidance will help keep US. financial institutions from providing unintended assistance to corrupt foreign officials seeking to hide their ill-gotten gains.\" The guidance, developed by an interagency group led by Treasury Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat, is available on Treasury's web site at www.treas.gov. Each of the issuing agencies will disseminate the guidance through their formal channels, as well. -30- LS-1123 Far press releases, speeches, public schedules and official biographies, call our 24-hour fax line at (202) 622-2040 ·u.s Government Printing Office 1998· 619·559 PUBLIC DEBT NEWS Department of the Treasury • Bureau of the Public Debt • Washington, DC 20239 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 17, 2001 Contact: Office of Financing 202-691-3550 TREASURY'S INFLATION-INDEXED SECURITIES FEBRUARY REFERENCE CPI NUMBERS AND DAILY INDEX RATIOS Public Debt announced today the reference Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers and daily index ratios for the month of February for the following Treasury inflation-indexed securities: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) 3-3/8% 1O-year notes due January 15, 2007 3-5/8% 5-year notes due July 15, 2002 3-5/8% 10-year notes due January 15, 2008 3-5/8% 30-year bonds due April 15,2028 3-7/8% 10-yearnotesdueJanuary 15,2009 3-7/8% 30-year bonds due April 15, 2029 4-1/4% 10-year notes due January 15,2010 3-1/2% 10-year notes due January 15, 2011 This information is based on the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY NEWS OFFICE OF PUBUC AFFAIRS -1500 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, N.W. - WASHINGTON, D.C. - 20220 - (202) 622-2960 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 18,2001 TREASURY RELEASES TWO REPORTS ON CREDIT UNIONS The Treasury Department today released two congressionally mandated reports on credit unions, Credit Union Membership Business Lending and Comparing Credit Unions with Other Depository Institutions, both were prepared in response to the Credit Union Membership Access Act, which President Clinton signed into law on August 7, 1998. In the report, Credit Union Membership Business Lending, Treasury surveyed all 1,514 credit unions that carried member business loans on their books as of June 30, 1999. The report finds that few credit unions are active business lenders. As of June 30, 2000, only 92 of 10,337 credit unions had total member business loans outstanding exceeding their net worth. While this group comprises less than one percent of credit unions, they account for over 46 percent of the unpaid principal balance of all member business loans. The report also finds that over half of all member business loans are collateralized with non-agricultural real estate, and rental properties make up one-third of the dollar volume of all member business loans. In preparing the second report, Comparing Credit Unions with Other Depository Institutions, Treasury compared the federal regulations and statutes applicable to credit unions with those applicable to other federally insured depository institutions, focusing on such areas as safety and soundness, consumer protection, and the product offerings of these different institutions. The report also reviews the history of credit unions' exemption from the federal corporate income tax and estimates the potential revenue that could be raised were Congress to remove that exemption (between $13.7 billion and $16.2 billion over a ten-year period). Finally, the report outlines the steps taken during this Administration to promote the viability of small banks and discusses the tax policy principles that must be satisfied to expand bank eligibility for electing Subchapter S status.

Same as national banks. Federal credit unions may only serve persons within the field of membership who join the credit union. 12 U.S.c. § 1759. Federal credit unions may choose from among three types of charters: (1) single common bond (i.e., occupational and associational); (2) multiple common bond (i.e., more than one group each having a common bond of occupation or association); and (3) community common bond. 63 Fed. Reg. 71,998 (Dec. 30,1998). - The immediate family and those residing in the household of one satisfying the common bond requirement are themselves eligible to join the credit union, whether or not the eligible individuals actually join the credit union. 12 U.s.c. § 1759(e)(I); 63 Fed. Reg. 71,998, 72,027 (Dec. 30, 1998). - -_.. - --- I This table compares statutory and regulatory rules across federally chartered depository institutions (i.e., national banks, federal savings associations, and federal credit unions), although many of these rules apply to all federally insured depository institutions. However, the table does not attempt to catalogue all of the authority available to federally chartered depository institutions; rather, it presents a sample that will illustrate how federal credit unions compare with other federally chartered depository institutions. 39 Rule OeC/FDIC/FRB OTS NCVA Depository Institution Powers 2 Deposits Checking accounts (demand deposits) National banks may offer demand deposits to any customer. Such accounts may not earn interest. However, banks may offer NOW accounts (negotiable order of withdrawal accounts) to individuals and nonprofit organizations. but not to businesses. \\\\ hich may earn interest.

Federal credit unions may offer to their members share draft accounts (i.e., demand deposits). 12 U.S.c. § 1757(6); 12 C.F.R. § 701.35(a).3 Generally, credit unions may only serve individuals. However, community credit unions may accept businesses as members. 63 Fed. Reg. 71,998, 72,037 (Dec. 30,1998). Similarly, credit unions that primarily serve predom inantly low-income members may accept deposits from non-members, including businesses. 12 U.s.c. § 1757(6); 12 C.F.R. § 701.34(a)(I). Unlike national banks and federal savings associations, federal credit unions with businesses as members may pay interest on business checking accounts. Time deposits National banks may offer certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and similar deposits without significant restrictions. 12 U.s.c. § 24(seventh). Same as national banks. 12 U.s.c. § 1464(b), 12 C.F.R. part 557, subpart B. Federal credit unions may offer share certificate accounts. 12 U.S.c. § 1757(6); 12 C.F.R. § 701.35(a).

Activities engaged in through affiliates are discussed elsewhere in this table. 3 Federal credit unions are member-owned cooperatives. 12 u.s.c. §§ 1752( I) and (5).

Asset securitization National banks may directly securitize their assets. 12lJ.s.C. § 24(seventh); 12 C.F.R. § 1.3(g). Same as national banks. No similar authority. Section 84 of the National Bank Act applies to savings associations in the same manner and to the same extent as it applies to national banks. 12 U .S.c. § 1464(u)(I); 12 C.F.R. § 560.93. A federal credit union's lending to anyone member is limited to 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. 12 USc. § 1757(5)(A)(x). According to the NCUA, th is amounts to 10% of the amount equal to a federal credit union's net worth plus its deposits. Lending: Non-Commercial Lending limits~ Lending limits protect the safety and soundness of banks by preventing excessive lending to one person or to related persons. National banks follow federal statutory lending limits, while state banks tilllllW state law in this regard. A national bank's total outstanding credit to one bOfr(mcr g.enerally may not cxceed I S percent or the bank's capital and ~urplu~. An addit ional 10 percent is permis~ible if fully secured by readily marketable collateral (Ie., financial instruments and bullion salable under ordinary market conditions with reasonable promptness at a fair market value deternlined by quotations based upon actual transactions on an auction or similarly available daily bid and ask price market). 12 USc. § 84(a); 12 C.F.R. part In addition, a savings association may make loans to one borrower of up to $500,000 even if its general lending limit is less than that amount. Certain other special rules provide additional exceptions. 12 U.S.c. § 1464(u)(2). The term unimpaired capital and surplus has not been defined in the lending limits regulation,5 although the Federal Credit Union Bylaws define paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus as a federal credit union's shares and undivided earnings. Art. XVIII, §§ I(g) and (h). In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act refers to member shares as equity, 12 U.s.c. § 1757(6). Based on this and the definition of paid-in capital and surplus, the NCUA .t The lending limits apply to all fonns of lending by all federally-chartered depository institutions unless specifically exempted. A similar ternl, \"paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus\" is defined, for purposes of Central Liquidity Facility rules, as generally consisting of the paid-in balance of share accounts and deposits plus undivided earnings. 12 C.F.R. § 725.2(0). However, the regulations governing federal credit union lending limits contain no definition. 43 Rule OCC/FDIC/FRB NCVA OTS interprets the applicable lending limit as including a federal credit un ion's deposits (shares) as equity for purposes of this limit. As a result, the limit for federal credit unions far exceeds that applicable to other federal depository institutions, which are only based on a proportion of capital, rather than on a proportion of the combination of capital and deposits. 32 (GCC). State lending limits generally range from 10% to 20% of capital and surplus. William A. Lovett, Banking and Financial Institutions Law, West, 1992, pp.156-157. Federal credit unions also face restrictions on commercial lending. The aggregate amount of business loans outstanding to anyone member may not exceed 15 percent of reserves or $100,000, whichever is higher. 12 C.F.R. § 723.8. The aggregate amount of member business loans made by a credit union may not exceed 1.75 times the credit union's net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's total assets. 12 U.s.c. § 1757a(a); 12 C.F.R. § 723.16. Exceptions to the aggregate loan limit apply to: (I) lowincome credit unions, or those participating in the Community Development Financial Institutions program; (2) those chartered for the purpose of making business loans; and (J) those with a history of primarily making such loans. 12 U.S.c. § 1757a(b); 12 C.F.R. § 723.17. Generally, federal credit union loans may not have terms that exceed 12 years, except for residential real estate loans. 12 U.S.c. § 1757(5). Usury A national bank may generally charge as much interest as a bank chartered by the state in wh ich the national bank is located. Similar to national banks. 12 U.s.c. § 1463( g)( I ). Federal credit unions may not charge more than 18% on extensions of credit to their members. 12 U.s.c. § 1757(5)(A)(vi)(I); 12 --- 44 -- --- - I I I Rule OCC/FDIC/FRB NCVA OTS C.F.R. § 701.21(c)(7)(ii)(8). 12 u.s.c. § 85.

Federal credit unions may provide business loans to their members. The aggregate limit on outstanding business loans is the lesser of 1.75 times the credit union's net worth or 12.25% of the credit union's total assets. 12 U.S.C. § I 757a(a); 12 C.F.R. § 723.16. Construction and development loans National banks may make these loans. 12 C.F.R. part 34 (secured); 12 U.S.c. § 24( seventh) (unsecured). Federal savings associations may make unsecured construction loans, subject to a limit equal to the greater of total capital or 5% of total assets. They may also make loans secured by nonresidential real estate, up to a limit of 400% of capital. 12 U.s.c. §§ 1464(c)(2)(B) and 1464(c)(3)(C). Federal credit unions may make member business loans to finance the acquisition or construction of income-producing property. Such loans must not exceed 15% of net worth, and the borrower must have at least a 35% equity interest in the project. 12 C.F.R. § 723.3. Federal savings associations may engage in lease financing of personal property subject to a limit of 10% of assets, without regard to residual value. 12 u.s.c. § 1464(c)(2)(C); 12 C.F.R. § 560.41 (d). Federal credit unions lack express authority to engage in lease financing. However, they may engage in lease financing of personal property, provided that such leases are the functional equivalent of secured loans for personal property.
