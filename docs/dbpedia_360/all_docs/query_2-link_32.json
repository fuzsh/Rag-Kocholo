Both were from the factory, pretty sure I've got pictures of one with a V8 210 in it as well as 6V53.\n\nBiggest dillema with the Cummins is electrolisys, make sure it's got inhibitor in it or leave it where it is.\n\nThe AT4's had the V8 185, 160 Cummins, and 6V53's.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106779 by bigcam\n\nReplied by bigcam on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nActually fits in there easier than a 6V53.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106780 by fageol100\n\nReplied by fageol100 on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nI know I'm changing the subject a bit, but did any of the 10 series (LAD cab) Dodges ever have C160 Cummins motors?\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106781 by bigcam\n\nReplied by bigcam on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nAll 361 V8 petrols as far as I know.\n\nSimilar drive line to the Power Giant.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106782 by fageol100\n\nReplied by fageol100 on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nThanks bigcam.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106783 by 600Dodge\n\nReplied by 600Dodge on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nIf you don't want it I'll buy the step tanks and the bullbar.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.\n\n#106784 by waynestr\n\nReplied by waynestr on topic Re: Dodge DN5 700 engines\n\nBy the look of the braces on the bottom of the bullbar you could make money demolishing buildings.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation."
