La variété se caractérise par une très bonne survie à l’hiver, parvient à maturité relativement tard, a une paille de taille moyenne qui résiste très bien à la verse, produit de gros grains de qualité acceptable selon l’usage final et résiste de façon adéquate à la maladie dans la partie ouest des Prairies canadiennes. AAC Wildfire résiste aux races courantes de la rouille jaune, est modérément résistante à la brûlure de l’épi causée par Fusarium et à la carie, réagit mieux à la tache foliaire et tolère le biotype original du puceron russe du blé (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko) en Amérique du Nord. Faute de fongicides efficaces, on ne recommande pas la culture d’AAC Wildfire dans la partie est des Prairies, où sévit la rouille de la tige. [Traduit par la Rédaction]\n\nIntroduction\n\nAAC Wildfire hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Lethbridge Research and Development Centre (LeRDC) in Lethbridge, AB. Tested as LK1064 and W512, registration No. 7857 was granted by the Variety Registration Office, Plant Production Division, Canadian Food Inspection Agency on 27 Nov. 2015. Application No. 15-8742 for Plant Breeders’ Rights has been accepted for filing under the provisions of the 1991 Convention of the Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions végétales (UPOV91).\n\nAAC Wildfire is well adapted to Alberta and western Saskatchewan, the non-hazard region for stem rust in western Canada. The end-use quality profile of AAC Wildfire meets the specifications of the Canada Western Red Winter (CWRW) wheat class.\n\nPedigree and Breeding Method\n\nEarly generation development and evaluation\n\nAAC Wildfire originates from the cross L99-1236/AC Bellatrix made in 2003 at the AAFC, LeRDC in Lethbridge. AC Bellatrix is a registered CWRW wheat cultivar with IDO180*2/Sundance parentage, developed at AAFC, LeRDC and released in 1998 (Thomas et al. 2012b). L99-1236, which was evaluated as W381 in the Western Winter Wheat Cooperative (WWWC) registration trials from 2002 to 2004, is a doubled haploid line developed from the cross AMN4LV/RWA53//IDO337-R1/CDC Kestrel. AMN4LV was tested as W304 and has Norstar*5/PGR16635 parentage; it expresses a high level of cold tolerance and wheat curl mite resistance conferred by Cmc1 (Thomas and Conner 1986). RWA53 represents a complex cross that incorporated Russian wheat aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko) tolerance into adapted germplasm: PI294994/3/I3C//Norwin/Blizzard/4/2*AC Readymade/5/Norstar*5/PGR16635//2*Redwin/3/AC Readymade. PI294994 is a heterogeneous accession from Bulgaria reported to carry Dn5 and several other uncharacterized RWA resistance genes (Zhang et al. 1998). IDO337-R1 is a selection from IDO337 that expresses excellent common bunt [Tilletia tritici (Bjerk.) G. Wint. in Rabenh. and T. laevis Kühn in Rabenh.] and dwarf bunt (T. controversa Kühn in Rabenh) resistance; it has A7257W-71-2-1/A77695 parentage (J. Chen, personal communication, University of Idaho, Aberdeen, ID) and was obtained through participation in the Western Regional Uniform Hard Winter Wheat Nursery. CDC Kestrel is a Canada Western Special Purpose (CWSP) cultivar selected from the cross Norstar*2/Vona (Fowler 1997a). An expanded ancestry of AAC Wildfire is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nFollowing growth of the F1 seeds in a greenhouse, several F2 bulk plots were grown in Lethbridge in 2005, from which 78 spikes were selected and planted as F3 rows. In 2006, 84 spikes were selected from desirable rows based on winter survival, plant type and vigour, plant height, straw strength, and stripe rust resistance. Seed from each spike was inoculated with common bunt and seeded as a row into cold soil in Lethbridge in mid-October. In 2007, 43 of the 84 rows showed bunt infection rates of 0% to 6%, whereas the remaining rows ranged in infection from 10% to 55%. Common bunt infection in the nursery was high, as revealed by AC Bellatrix (the long-term moderately resistant check) with an infection rate of 18%, versus CDC Osprey (Fowler 1997b) (the long-term susceptible check) which showed an infection rate of 49%. From the rows expressing low infection (6% or under), 76 spikes were selected and seeded in an observation nursery in Lethbridge. In 2008, 30 desirable F4-derived F5 lines were harvested and seeded in single replicate preliminary trials and an inoculated bunt nursery. In 2009, promising agronomic characteristics, resistance to common bunt, improved leaf spot reaction, and acceptable end-use quality prompted the advancement of four lines into replicated multi-location trials across western Canada in 2010 and 2011. Concurrently, resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers.: Pers. f.sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) and leaf rust (P. triticina Eriks.) were assessed in collaboration with the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, MB; stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend.), common bunt, and Russian wheat aphid reactions were determined at AAFC, LeRDC. Following 11 site-years of pre-registration testing and two years of detailed end-use quality analysis, LK1064 entered the WWWC registration trial as W512 and was evaluated over three years for registration purposes (2011/2012 to 2013/2014), plus one additional year (2014/2015).\n\nAssessment for cultivation and processing\n\nThe suitability of AAC Wildfire for registration in western Canada was considered relative to Radiant (Thomas et al. 2012a), CDC Buteo (Fowler 2010), Flourish (Graf et al. 2012), and Moats (Fowler 2012). CDC Osprey and AC Bellatrix were also used as end-use quality checks in 2012 and 2013. Agronomic trial sites were in Alberta (Beaverlodge, Lacombe, Lethbridge “dry land”, Lethbridge “irrigated”, Morrin, Olds, Warner), Saskatchewan (Indian Head, Kamsack, Melfort, Saskatoon, Swift Current), and Manitoba (Brandon, Carman, Winnipeg), through the collaborative efforts of AAFC, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, and Canterra Seeds Ltd. Analyses of variance were conducted using a combined mixed effects model where environments were considered random and genotypes were fixed. The least significant difference (LSD) test was used to identify significant differences from the check cultivars.\n\nDuring registration testing, reactions to the major winter wheat diseases of economic importance in both the eastern and western prairies were assessed. Supplementary checks were added as required to aid in making accurate assessments. The adult plant reactions to stem and leaf rust were determined in artificially inoculated field nurseries conducted by the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg using race composites supplied by the AAFC Cereal Research Centre (CRC), and reported using the modified Cobb scale (Peterson et al. 1948). The stem rust races used for one or more years included: MCCFR (P0001), QTHJT (P0005), RHTSK (P0002), RKQSR (P0003), RTHJT (P0007), TMRTK (P0006), and TPMKR (P0004) (Fetch et al. 2015). The leaf rust races were a representative mixture collected in western Canada during the previous field season (McCallum et al. 2013, 2016). Seedling reactions to individual races of stem and leaf rust prevalent in Canada were also determined under controlled-environment conditions. The races of stem rust were the same as those used in the field nurseries, whereas the leaf rust races used for one or more years included MBDS (12-3), MBRJ (128-1), MGBJ (74-2), TDBG (06-1-1), TJBJ (77-2), and TDBJ (11-180-1). Stripe rust and common bunt reactions were rated in nurseries at AAFC, LeRDC. Both natural infection and artificial inoculation using spores collected in the previous year were used to promote localized stripe rust epiphytotics (Puchalski and Gaudet 2011). Common bunt resistance was estimated by inoculating seed with a composite of races that included L1, L16, T1, T6, T13, and T19 (Hoffman and Metzger 1976; Gaudet and Puchalski 1989) prior to planting into cold soil at two locations in October. Fusarium head blight (FHB) {caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schwein.) Petch]} response was determined in a three replicate, mist-irrigated field nursery conducted by the University of Manitoba in Carman. Each line was spray-inoculated with a suspension of F. graminearum macroconidia at 50% anthesis and again 3–4 d later. Equal quantities of two 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and two 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) producing chemotypes were used to prepare the spore suspension at a final concentration of 50 000 macroconidia mL−1. Rating was done using a visual index (% incidence × % severity/100), typically 18–21 d after anthesis or when symptoms were well developed (Gilbert and Woods 2006; Cuthbert et al. 2007). Harvested grain from each inoculated row was used to prepare a 50 g sample to determine the percentage of Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK). This sample was also used to quantify the deoxynivalenol (DON) content using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) at the AAFC Ottawa Research and Development Centre (ORDC) in Ottawa, ON (Sinha et al. 1995; Sinha and Savard 1996). The reactions to powdery mildew [Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer] and unspecified leaf spotting pathogens were recorded at test sites expressing differential symptoms based on natural infection.\n\nRussian wheat aphid reaction was determined annually under controlled environment conditions by infesting two or three replicates of 15 or more seedlings with 20–25 aphids per plant and assessing feeding damage approximately 21 d later. Susceptibility to infestation included typically observed symptoms of chlorophyll loss, longitudinal leaf curling, and white or yellow streaking along the entire leaf blade (Linscott et al. 2001).\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, end-use quality analyses were conducted at the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC), Grain Research Laboratory (GRL), following protocols of the American Association of Cereal Chemists (2000). Following CGC determination of grain grade and protein concentration for the check cultivars at all of the agronomic test locations, a common site blending formula for the checks and all experimental lines was provided to produce composite samples where the mean protein concentration of the checks was approximately 12.5%. Grain from test sites with serious down-grading factors was not included in the quality composites. In 2014, quality analyses were not conducted due to severe pre-harvest sprouting and insufficient quantities of grain from acceptable sites to create sufficiently large composite samples of reliable quality. Data from pre-registration trials generated in 2010 and 2011 by the AAFC Cereal Quality Laboratory relative to several common checks were considered as part of the request for registration in early 2015.\n\nPerformance\n\nGrain yield and agronomics\n\nThe agronomic performance of AAC Wildfire, relative to the prescribed check cultivars for the CWRW wheat class (Radiant, CDC Buteo, Flourish, Moats) was established from data collected at 43 sites over four years across the Canadian prairies. Ancillary data for AAC Elevate (Graf et al. 2015), which was not a check during the evaluation of AAC Wildfire, are also considered because it replaced Radiant as a registration check in 2014/2015.\n\nAAC Wildfire expressed significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) grain yield than the CWRW check mean (109.2%) and all of the CWRW checks: Radiant (+9.3%), CDC Buteo (+12.6%), Flourish (+7.8%), and Moats (+7.4%) (Table 1). It was also 6.2% higher yielding than AAC Elevate (P ≤ 0.05). On a regional basis, AAC Wildfire demonstrated numerically higher yields than all of the checks in all zones, with significance (P ≤ 0.05) shown relative to Radiant and CDC Buteo in southern Alberta (Zone 1); CDC Buteo and Flourish in the parkland region (Zone 2); and Radiant in the eastern prairie rust-hazard region (Zone 4). Provincially, AAC Wildfire was significantly higher yielding (P ≤ 0.05) than all of the checks in Alberta and Saskatchewan, but no significant differences were shown in Manitoba.\n\nTable 1.\n\nAAC Wildfire exhibited excellent winter survival that was within the range of the check cultivars (Table 2). Heading date was 5 d later than Flourish and 3 d later than Radiant, CDC Buteo, Moats, and AAC Elevate (P ≤ 0.05). Maturity was later than all of the checks (P ≤ 0.05), ranging from 6 d later than Flourish to 2 d later than Radiant. AAC Wildfire was 5–6 cm shorter than Radiant, CDC Buteo, and Moats, 6 cm taller than Flourish, and 2 cm taller than AAC Elevate (P ≤ 0.05). Lodging resistance was significantly better than CDC Buteo and Moats, similar to Flourish and AAC Elevate, but inferior to Radiant (P ≤ 0.05). The test weight of AAC Wildfire was within the range of the check cultivars; kernel weight was higher than Radiant, CDC Buteo, and Moats (P ≤ 0.05), similar to Flourish, and lower than AAC Elevate (P ≤ 0.05). The grain protein concentration of AAC Wildfire was within the range of the checks and equal to that of CDC Buteo. Grain protein yield per hectare was significantly greater than Radiant, CDC Buteo, and AAC Elevate (P ≤ 0.05), and similar to Flourish and Moats.\n\nTable 2.\n\nDisease and pest resistance\n\nThree years of disease ratings (2012–2014) for AAC Wildfire were summarized by the Prairie Recommending Committee for Wheat, Rye and Triticale (PRCWRT) Disease Evaluation Team as follows: resistant to stripe rust, moderately resistant to FHB and common bunt, intermediate in resistance to leaf rust, and susceptible to stem rust. The data from 2015 confirmed these assessments (Tables 3 and 4). AAC Wildfire had a mean leaf spot rating that was better than the best check and showed powdery mildew infection within the range of the checks. The combination of disease resistance exhibited by AAC Wildfire is well-suited for Alberta and western Saskatchewan, the non-hazard area for stem rust, and should facilitate reduced usage of seed- and foliar-applied fungicides in this region.\n\nTable 3.\n\nTable 4.\n\nFive years of rating relative to susceptible and resistant checks indicated that AAC Wildfire expresses good tolerance to RWA feeding (Table 5). This resistance is likely to the RWA1 biotype that was prevalent in North America in the mid-1980s, when the local colony was established for screening. Efforts to develop winter wheat cultivars with RWA tolerance were initiated at AAFC, LeRDC shortly after its isolation in southern Alberta, since fall feeding on young seedlings reduces vigour and increases the likelihood of cold injury (Thomas and Butts 1990). Although RWA populations in western Canada are normally eradicated or severely reduced during the winter (Butts 1992), and western Canadian monitoring ended in 2007 following several years of low but stable wheat infestation levels in southwestern Saskatchewan (Anonymous 2007), the threat to winter wheat remains. Significant fall infestations are likely to reoccur in the future via summer migrations from high-density areas of the United States as crops ripen successively northward (Burd et al. 1998), or through climate-change induced overwintering. In 2003, nine years after the successful deployment of RWA tolerant cultivars incorporating Dn4, a new biotype (RWA2) virulent on all but one source of resistance was isolated in Colorado (Haley et al. 2004). Additional biotypes (RWA3/7, RWA6, RWA8) were subsequently identified (Puterka et al. 2014). Despite rapid dispersal of RWA2, such that it dominated populations in Northern and Central Plains states in 2005 (Puterka et al. 2007), a recent shift towards the Dn4 avirulent RWA6 emphasizes that the population dynamics of the biotype complex are not well understood (Puterka et al. 2015). It also suggests that the uncharacterized tolerance of AAC Wildfire may provide some protection against RWA when it is required.\n\nTable 5.\n\nEnd-use quality\n\nFour years of end-use suitability testing, two years (2010–2011) at the AAFC Cereal Quality Laboratory (data not presented) and two years (2012–2013) at the CGC, GRL allowed the PRCWRT Quality Evaluation Team to establish that AAC Wildfire had milling and baking quality suitable for grades of the CWRW wheat class (Table 6). AAC Wildfire milling characteristics were similar to the checks and demonstrated the high flour yield/low flour ash attributes of the CWRW wheat class. The farinograph indicated strong mixing properties, and similar or better water absorption than most of the checks except AC Bellatrix. Remix-to-peak bake attributes for AAC Wildfire were similar to Radiant and CDC Buteo, but with improved baking absorption.\n\nTable 6.\n\nOther characteristics\n\nSeedling: coleoptile anthocyanin pigmentation absent.\n\nPlant: juvenile growth prostrate, leaves medium green; tillering capacity medium high, semi-prostrate to intermediate at tillering; flag leaf medium to dark green, glabrous, slightly waxy, medium long, medium wide, strongly recurved, upright; flag leaf sheath glabrous, medium to strong waxiness; auricle anthocyanin colouration absent to very weak with a low frequency of purple, margins slightly pubescent; culm neck straight to very slightly curved, hollow, glabrous, slightly waxy, yellow at maturity.\n\nSpike: awned, tapering, medium dense, medium length, weak to medium waxiness, reddish brown, inclined at maturity; awns tan, slight to moderate spreading; glumes medium to long, medium wide, glabrous, light brown to brown; glume shoulders square, narrow; glume beak medium long, acuminate; rachis margins strongly pubescent; resistant to shattering.\n\nKernel: medium red, medium hard texture, medium to large size.\n\nPedigreed Seed Development and Maintenance\n\nBreeder Seed production of AAC Wildfire was initiated in 2013 by planting random spikes taken from rogued F4-derived F10 increase plots grown in Lethbridge. In 2014, seed was harvested from 86 of these 110 head-rows grown in isolation from other wheat. Elimination of 24 rows was based on minor differences in plant appearance. The AAFC Seed Increase Unit at Indian Head planted 84 of the 86 pre-breeder seed lines in fall 2014. During the winter of 2014/2015, each potential breeder seed line was screened for RWA resistance, resulting in the elimination of three lines because of inconsistent results. Fifteen additional lines were discarded prior to harvest due to the presence of a low frequency of plants of similar height with white chaff at maturity. The remaining 66 F12 breeder lines were inspected, harvested in bulk, and cleaned to form 439 kg of Breeder Seed, which was released to pedigreed seed growers in fall 2015. AAC Wildfire Breeder Seed is maintained at the AAFC Seed Increase Unit in Indian Head. All other pedigreed seed classes derive from this initial lot of Breeder Seed, with multiplication and distribution coordinated by SeCan Association, 501–300 March Road, Kanata, ON K2K 2E2, Canada.
