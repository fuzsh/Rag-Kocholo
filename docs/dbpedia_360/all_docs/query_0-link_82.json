A total of 24 indices including shrubs growth and soil physical and chemical properties were selected to determine the main affecting factors and parameters in evaluating and classifying the lowly efficient shrubs. There were no obvious correlations between the indices reflecting the shrubs growth and soil quality, and thus, only using shrub growth index to reflect the lowly efficiency level of T. chinensis was not enough, and it would be necessary to combine with soil quality factors to make a comprehensive evaluation. The principal factors reflecting the quality level of lowly efficient T. chinensis shrubs included soil salt content and moisture content, stand age, single tree's aboveground stem, leaf biomass, and basal diameter, followed by soil density, porosity, and soil nutrient status. The lowly efficient T. chinensis shrubs in the Bay could be classified into five types, namely, shrub with growth potential, slightly low quality shrub, moderately lowly efficient shrub, moderately low quality and lowly efficient shrub, and seriously low quality and lowly efficient shrub. The main features, low efficiency causes, and management measures of these shrubs were discussed based on the mean cluster value.\n\nRhus chinensis and Galla Chinensis--folklore to modern evidence: review.\n\nPubMed\n\nDjakpo, Odilon; Yao, Weirong\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe species Rhus chinensis Mill. (Anacardiaceae) is an important representative of the genus Rhus, which contains over 250 individual species found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide. Rhus chinensis has long been used by folk medicine practitioners in Asia. Leaves, roots, stem, bark, fruit and particularly the galls on Rhus chinensis leaves, Galla chinensis, are recognized to have preventative and therapeutic effects on different ailments (such as diarrhea, dysentery, rectal and intestinal cancer, diabetes mellitus, sepsis, oral diseases and inflammation). However, it is critical to separate evidence from anecdote. Fortunately, recent scientific research has revealed that Rhus chinensis compounds possess strong antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal and antioxidant activities. Moreover, compounds isolated from the stem of Rhus chinensis significantly suppressed HIV-1 activity in vitro. Compounds from this plant were also found to inhibit enamel demineralization in vitro and enhance remineralization of dental enamel with fluoride. This review highlights claims from traditional and tribal medicinal lore and makes a contemporary summary of phytochemical, biological and pharmacological findings on this plant material. It aims to show that the pharmaceutical potential of this plant deserves closer attention.

PCBs, DDTs and other organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (e.g., HCHs, HCB, mirex and dieldrin) were analysed in blubber samples of 45 dolphins and 10 prey fishes of S. chinensis collected from 2004 to 2013 in the PRE region to investigate the bioaccumulation and potential biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). DDTs were the most abundant residue in the dolphins, with an average of 6,2700 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww), followed by PCBs (average: 1,790 ng g(-1) ww) and other OCPs including âHCHs, mirex, endrin, âchlordanes, HCB, dieldrin, aldrin, heptachlor, and pentachlorobenzene. The concentrations of PCBs and DDTs in male dolphins significantly increased with age and length. In contrast, female dolphins did not show obvious bioaccumulation trends with age and body length, possibly due to the lactational and parturitional transfer of these compounds. Compared with the POP residues in the prey fishes, the concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, and HCHs in the dolphin blubber increased by factors of 99, 212, and 5, respectively, whereas the residue levels of the other OCPs increased 2-185 times, indicating a potentially significant biomagnification in the top predators. The potential biomagnification factors calculated for most POPs were significantly higher than those in the cetacean species from other regions. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The high concentration of nests in specific points of certain beaches indicates that the selection of nest placement is not random but is related to some geological aspects, such as bar margin inclination and presence of a high, sandy platform. The presence of access channels to high platform points or ramp morphology are decisive factors in the choice of nesting areas. The eroded and escarped margins of the beaches hinder the Amazon river turtle arriving at the most suitable places for nesting. Through the years, changes in beach morphology can alter nest distribution.\n\nComplete Chloroplast Genome Sequence of Coptis chinensis Franch. and Its Evolutionary History\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHe, Yang; Deng, Cao; Fan, Gang; Qin, Shishang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Coptis chinensis Franch. is an important medicinal plant from the Ranunculales. We used next generation sequencing technology to determine the complete chloroplast genome of C. chinensis. This genome is 155,484âbp long with 38.17% GC content. Two 26,758âbp long inverted repeats separated the genome into a typical quadripartite structure. The C. chinensis chloroplast genome consists of 128 gene loci, including eight rRNA gene loci, 28 tRNA gene loci, and 92 protein-coding gene loci. Most of the SSRs in C. chinensis are poly-A/T. The numbers of mononucleotide SSRs in C. chinensis and other Ranunculaceae species are fewer than those in Berberidaceae species, while the number of dinucleotide SSRs is greater than that in the Berberidaceae. C. chinensis diverged from other Ranunculaceae species an estimated 81 million years ago (Mya). The divergence between Ranunculaceae and Berberidaceae was ~111 Mya, while the Ranunculales and Magnoliaceae shared a common ancestor during the Jurassic, ~153 Mya. Position 104 of the C. chinensis ndhG protein was identified as a positively selected site, indicating possible selection for the photosystem-chlororespiration system in C. chinensis. In summary, the complete sequencing and annotation of the C. chinensis chloroplast genome will facilitate future studies on this important medicinal species. PMID:28698879\n\n[Study of quality control on Cuscuta chinensis and C. australia].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Hui-bin; Lin, Jian-qun; Lu, Ning; Lin, Jian-qiang\n\n2007-11-01\n\nTo study the estimate method of C. chinensis and C. australia. HPLC was used to determine the contents of four kinds of flavones of C. chinensis and C. australia growing on different hosts. C. chinensis and C. australia growing on different hosts both had hyperoside, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The content range of hyperoside was 2.790-6.502 mg/g and was higher than other flavones. The content ranges of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were 0.025-0.176 mg/g, 0.001-0.213 mg/g and 0.001-0.077 mg/g, respectively. The contents of hyperoside and quercetin are higher in C. chineasis than in C. australia. The contents of kaempferol and isorhamnetin are lower in C. chinensis than in C. australia. The hosts influence flavones content of C. chinensis and C. australia.\n\n[Study on chemical constituents from Schisandra chinensis stem].\n\nPubMed\n\nZheng, Li-shi; Du, Shu-shan; Cai, Qian\n\n2014-10-01\n\nTo separate and identify the chemical constituents from the stem of Schisandra chinensis. Various chromatographic techniques were used to separate and purify the chemical constituents from 95% ethanol extraction of the stem of Schisandra chinensis. Their structures were elucidated based on the physico-chemical properties and spectral data. Ten compounds were obtained and elucidated as (+)-deoxyschizandrin (1), Î³-schizandrin (2), wuweizisu C (3), gomisin N (4), schizandrin (5), anwuweizic acid (6), (-)-dihydroguaiaretic acid (7), tetradecanoic acid (8), Î²-sitosterol (9) and daucosterol (10). Compounds 6-8 are obtained from the stem of Schisandra chinensis for the first time.\n\nLow Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Variation in the Endangered Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (Sousa chinensis): Inferences About the Role of Balancing Selection.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Xiyang; Lin, Wenzhi; Zhou, Ruilian; Gui, Duan; Yu, Xinjian; Wu, Yuping\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIt has been widely reported that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is under balancing selection due to its immune function across terrestrial and aquatic mammals. The comprehensive studies at MHC and other neutral loci could give us a synthetic evaluation about the major force determining genetic diversity of species. Previously, a low level of genetic diversity has been reported among the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) using both mitochondrial marker and microsatellite loci. Here, the expression and sequence polymorphism of 2 MHC class II genes (DQB and DRB) in 32 S. chinensis from PRE collected between 2003 and 2011 were investigated. High ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates, codon-based selection analysis, and trans-species polymorphism (TSP) support the hypothesis that balancing selection acted on S. chinensis MHC sequences. However, only 2 haplotypes were detected at either DQB or DRB loci. Moreover, the lack of deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation at DRB locus combined with the relatively low heterozygosity at both DQB locus and microsatellite loci suggested that balancing selection might not be sufficient, which further suggested that genetic drift associated with historical bottlenecks was not mitigated by balancing selection in terms of the loss of MHC and neutral variation in S. chinensis. The combined results highlighted the importance of maintaining the genetic diversity of the endangered S. chinensis. Â© The American Genetic Association 2016. All rights reserved.

The hepatic levels of Cr, As, and Cu in these dolphins were among the highest reported for cetaceans globally, and the levels of Zn, Cu, and Hg were sufficiently high to cause toxicological effects in some of the animals. Between same age-sex groups, dolphins from Lingdingyang were significantly more contaminated with Hg, Se, and V than those from the West-four region, while the opposite was true for Cd. Generalized additive mixed models showed that most metals had significant but dissimilar temporal trends over a 10-year period. The concentrations of Cu and Zn increased significantly in recent years, corresponding to the high input of these metals in the region. Body-length-adjusted Cd levels peaked in 2012, accompanied by the highest annual number of dolphin stranding events. In contrast to the significant decrease in HM levels in the dolphins in Hong Kong waters (the eastern reaches of the PRE), the elevated metal exposure in the western PRE raises serious concerns.\n\nEx vivo relaxation effect of Cuscuta chinensis extract on rabbit corpus cavernosum.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Kai; Zhao, Chen; Chen, Xiang-Feng; Kim, Hye-Kyung; Choi, Bo-Ram; Huang, Yi-Ran; Park, Jong-Kwan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe effect of Cuscuta chinensis extract on the rabbit penile corpus cavernosum (PCC) was evaluated in the present study. Penises obtained from healthy male New Zealand white rabbits (2.5-3.0 kg) were precontracted with phenylephrine (Phe, 10 Âµmol l(-1)) and then treated with various concentrations of Cuscuta chinensis extract (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg ml(-1)). The change in penile tension was recorded, and cyclic nucleotides in the PCC were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The interaction between Cuscuta chinensis and sildenafil was also evaluated. The result indicated that the PCC relaxation induced by Cuscuta chinensis extract was concentration-dependent. Pre-treatment with an nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (NÏ nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, L-NAME), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, ODQ), or a protein kinase A inhibitor (KT 5720) did not completely inhibit the relaxation. Incubation of penile cavernous tissue with the Cuscuta chinensis extract significantly increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the PCC. Moreover, the Cuscuta chinensis extract significantly enhanced sildenafil-induced PCC relaxation. In conclusion, the Cuscuta chinensis extract exerts a relaxing effect on penile cavernous tissue in part by activating the NO-cGMP pathway, and it may improve erectile dysfunction (ED), which does not completely respond to sildenafil citrate.\n\nStudy of Commercially Available Lobelia chinensis Products Using Bar-HRM Technology.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Wei; Yan, Song; Li, Jingjian; Xiong, Chao; Shi, Yuhua; Wu, Lan; Xiang, Li; Deng, Bo; Ma, Wei; Chen, Shilin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThere is an unmet need for herbal medicine identification using a fast, sensitive, and easy-to-use method that does not require complex infrastructure and well-trained technicians. For instance, the detection of adulterants in Lobelia chinensis herbal product has been challenging, since current detection technologies are not effective due to their own limits. High Resolution Melting (HRM) has emerged as a powerful new technology for clinical diagnosis, research in the food industry and in plant molecular biology, and this method has already highlighted the complexity of species identification. In this study, we developed a method of species specific detection of L. chinensis using HRM analysis combined with internal transcribed spacer 2. We then applied this method to commercial products purporting to contain L . chinensis . Our results demonstrated that HRM can differentiate L. chinensis from six common adulterants. HRM was proven to be a fast and accurate technique for testing the authenticity of L. chinensis in herbal products. Based on these results, a HRM approach for herbal authentication is provided.\n\n[Chemical Constituents of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis Aerial Parts].\n\nPubMed\n\nYin, Wei; Song, Zu-rong; Liu, Jin-qi; Zhang, Guo-sheng\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo study the chemical constituents of aerial parts of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis . Aerial parts of Paris polyphylla var. chinensis was extracted with 95% EtOH, and separated and purified by silica gel, RP 18 and Sephadex LH-20 col- umn chromatography. The structures were identified by spectroscopic analysis. A total of ten compounds were isolated and iden- tified as Î²-sitosterol (1) ergosta-7, 22-dien-3-one (2), Î²-ecdysone (3), kaempferol (4), daucosterol (5) luteolin (6) calonysterone (7), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (8), quercetin (9), and 3Î², 5Î±, 9Î±-trihydroxyergosta-7, 22-dien-6-one (10). Compounds 2,6 and 10 are isolated from Paris polyphylla var. chinensis for the first time.\n\nEx vivo relaxation effect of Cuscuta chinensis extract on rabbit corpus cavernosum\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSun, Kai; Zhao, Chen; Chen, Xiang-Feng; Kim, Hye-Kyung; Choi, Bo-Ram; Huang, Yi-Ran; Park, Jong-Kwan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe effect of Cuscuta chinensis extract on the rabbit penile corpus cavernosum (PCC) was evaluated in the present study.

The results showed that the high boxing-counting dimension (1.8087) and information dimension (1.7931) reflected a higher spatial occupational degree of L. chinensis populations. Judged by the dispersal index and Morisita's pattern index, L. chinensis populations clumped at three different age stages (0-25, 25-50 and over 50 years). From Greig-Smiths' mean variance analysis, the figure of pattern scale showed that L. chinensis populations clumped in 128 m2 and 512 m2, and the different age groups clumped in different scales. The pattern intensities decreased with increasing age, and tended to reduce with increasing area when detected by Kershaw's PI index. The spatial pattern characters of L. chinensis populations may be their responses to environmental factors.\n\nPreparative isolation and purification of seven isoflavones from Belamcanda chinensis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yeon Sil; Kim, Seon Ha; Kim, Jin Kyu; Lee, Sanghyun; Jung, Sang Hoon; Lim, Soon Sung\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIsoflavonoids from Belamcanda chinensis are known to have a number of physiological benefits including anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-mutagenic properties. However, there have been no reports on the effective isolation and purification of isoflavonoids from B. chinensis. To develop an efficient method for the preparative isolation and purification of isoflavones from B. chinensis by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC). A two-step HSCCC isolation method was developed using solvent system of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-2-propanol-methanol-water (5:6:2:3.5:6, v/v) and of ethyl acetate-methanol-water (10:2:9, v/v). FLASH purification system (45% methanol, isocratic) was also used for further purification. The purities and chemical structures of the isolated compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA), electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), Â¹H- and Â¹Â³C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) and nuclear overhauser enhancement (NOE). HSCCC was successfully used for the preparative separation and purification of seven isoflavones, including tectoridin (145.4âmg, 97.5%), iridin (77.9âmg, 94.0%), irilin D (42.0 mg, 92.0%), tectorigenin (294.1âmg, 98.6%), iristectorigenin A (86.8âmg, 93.4%), irigenin (141.8âmg, 95.8%) and irisflorentin (73.4âmg, 94.7%) from the rhizomes of B. chinensis.

A total of 115 endophytic fungi isolates obtained from bark segments of T. chinensis were grouped into 23 genera based on the morphological traits and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), indicating endophytic fungi in T. chinensis are diverse and abundant. Diaporthe, Phomopsis (anamorph of Diaporthe), Acremonium, and Pezicula were the dominant genera, whereas the remaining genera were infrequent groups. The 13 representative species of the distinct genera were capable of producing taxol verified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among the taxol-producing fungi, the yield of taxol produced by the Metarhizium anisopliae, H-27 was 846.1 microg l(-1) in reformative potato dextrose liquid medium, and the fungal taxol was further validated by mass spectrometry (MS). The taxol-producing fungi (92.3%) were infrequent communities, suggesting that infrequent fungi associated with T. chinensis might be a fascinating reservoir of taxol-generating fungi.\n\nCuscuta chinensis Ameliorates Immunosuppression and Urotoxic Effect of Cyclophosphamide by Regulating Cytokines - GM-CSF and TNF-Alpha.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaju, Nidhi; Sakthivel, Kunnathur Murugesan; Kannan, Narayanan; Vinod Prabhu, Venugopal; Guruvayoorappan, Chandrasekaran\n\n2015-06-01\n\nCancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is commonly used as anticancer drug which causes toxicity by its reactive metabolites such as acroline and phosphoramide mustard. In this study, Cuscuta chinensis (C. chinensis) (family: Convolvulaceae) was assessed for ability to restore mice against CTX-induced toxicity. Coadministration of C. chinensis extract (10Â mg/kg BW, IP, daily) for ten consecutive days reduced CTX-induced (25Â mg/kg BW, IP, daily) toxicity. Treatment with C. chinensis extract significantly (pâ<â0.01) increased the relative organ weight and body weight. Moreover, administration of C. chinensis extract significantly increased bone marrow cellulatity and Î±-esterase activity in CTX-treated mice which suggested its protective role on the hematopoietic system. The GSH content was drastically reduced by CTX administration in urinary bladder which was enhanced by treatment with C. chinensis extract, indicating that preventing acroline-mediated tissue damage or cell toxicity and also the extract decreased the urinary bladder nitric oxide (NO) level which proves recovery over urinary tract injury associated with CTX treatment. The administration of C. chinensis extract decreased serum urea, creatinine, and bilirubin levels when compared to CTX-alone-treated group. Histopathological analysis of the urinary bladder of CTX-alone-treated group showed necrotic damage whereas the C. chinensis-treated group showed normal bladder architecture. The above data clearly demonstrates chemoprotective role of C. chinensis against CTX-induced toxicities by regulating antioxidant and inflammatory mediators.\n\nAllelopathic potential of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha on Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYusoff, Nornasuha; Ismail B., S.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nLaboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to study the allelopathic potential of the aqueous leaf extract and leaf debris (incorporated into the soil) of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha on the germination indices and growth as well as the allelopathic effect response index of Brassica chinensis. Three concentrations each of the aqueous leaf extract (12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 g/L) and leaf debris (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 g/500 g soil) were used in the experiments. The treatments were arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications, and the experiment was conducted twice. The aqueous leaf extracts of both species significantly inhibited all growth parameters of B. chinensis at 50.0 g/L concentration by more than 50% (compared to that by the control). In contrast, the leaf debris of both species at most of the concentrations showed significant stimulatory effects on all growth parameters of B. chinensis. However, M. micrantha leaf debris showed no significant effect on the fresh weight of B. chinensis at all concentrations. The total germination percentage of B. chinensis was significantly decreased as concentration of the aqueous leaf extracts of both species increased. The aqueous leaf extract of both species at concentrations higher than 25.0 g/L, significantly reduced the initial speed of germination as well as the cumulative speed of germination of B. chinensis. The allelopathic effect response index was negative for both species, indicating that the extracts of both species have inhibitory effects on the germination and seedling growth of B. chinensis. Results from the study suggested that the leaves of C. odorata and M. micrantha have phytotoxic properties and have potential for use directly or indirectly on susceptible weeds, and thereby reducing the use of chemical pesticides.\n\nHepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of Cuscuta chinensis against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nYen, Feng-Lin; Wu, Tzu-Hui; Lin, Liang-Tzung; Lin, Chun-Ching\n\n2007-04-20\n\nTu-Si-Zi, the seeds of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. (Convolvulaceae), is a traditional Chinese medicine that is commonly used to nourish and improve the liver and kidney conditions in China and other Asian countries. As oxidative stress promotes the development of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the hepatoprotective effect and antioxidant activities of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of C chinensis on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The C chinensis ethanolic extract at an oral dose of both 125 and 250mg/kg showed a significant hepatoprotective effect relatively to the same extent (P<0.05) by reducing levels of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In addition, the same ethanolic extract prevented the hepatotoxicity induced by APAP-intoxicated treatment as observed when assessing the liver histopathology. Regarding the antioxidant activity, C chinensis ethanolic extract exhibited a significant effect (P<0.05) by increasing levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. In contrast, the same doses of the aqueous extract of C chinensis did not present any hepatoprotective effect as seen in the ethanolic extract, and resulted in further liver deterioration. In conclusion, these data suggest that the ethanolic extract of Cuscuta chinensis can prevent hepatic injuries from APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and this is likely mediated through its antioxidant activities.\n\nMechanism of resistance to cyhalofop-butyl in Chinese sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees).\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Jiaxing; Gao, Haitao; Pan, Lang; Yao, Zhenwei; Dong, Liyao\n\n2017-11-01\n\nChinese sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees) is a serious grass weed in rice paddies. In some areas, L. chinensis has become resistant to the herbicide cyhalofop-butyl because of its frequent and extensive use over the past five years. In this study, whole-plant dose-response assays were conducted, and a L. chinensis population (ZHYH) had a 75.8-fold resistance index to cyhalofop-butyl. Molecular analyses revealed that this resistance was attributed to a tryptophan (Trp)-2027-to-cysteine (Cys) substitution in the CT domain of the ACCase gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the mechanism underlying cyhalofop-butyl resistance in L. chinensis. Furthermore, a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic (dCAPS) assay was developed to rapidly detect the Trp-2027-Cys mutation. Of the 100 ZHYH plants analyzed, 52 were heterozygous mutants and 48 were susceptible homozygous plants. In addition, the cyhalofop-butyl-resistant L. chinensis was cross-resistant to aryloxyphenoxypropionate and phenylpyrazoline herbicides, but not to cyclohexanedione, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and urea herbicides, and had only slight resistance to the hormonal herbicide quinclorac.

By using passive acoustic monitoring, a baseline distribution of data on this species in the Pearl River Estuary during pre-construction period had been collected. Dolphin biosonar detection and its diel, lunar, seasonal and tidal patterns were examined using a Generalized Linear Model. Significant higher echolocation detections at night than during the day, in winter-spring than in summer-autumn, at high tide than at flood tide were recognized. Significant higher echolocation detections during the new moon were recognized at night time. The diel, lunar and seasonal patterns for the echolocation encounter duration also significantly varied. These patterns could be due to the spatial-temporal variability of dolphin prey and illumination conditions. The baseline information will be useful for driving further effective action on the conservation of this species and in facilitating later assessments of the effects of the offshore windfarm on the dolphins by comparing the baseline to post construction and post mitigation efforts.\n\nPassive Acoustic Monitoring the Diel, Lunar, Seasonal and Tidal Patterns in the Biosonar Activity of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in the Pearl River Estuary, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Zhi-Tao; Nachtigall, Paul E.; Akamatsu, Tomonari; Wang, Ke-Xiong; Wu, Yu-Ping; Liu, Jian-Chang; Duan, Guo-Qin; Cao, Han-Jiang; Wang, Ding\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA growing demand for sustainable energy has led to an increase in construction of offshore windfarms.

E.; Bohrson, W. A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Steens Basalts (~16.7 Ma), the oldest and most mafic stage of Columbia River flood basalt volcanism, are known for lavas with conspicuous giant plagioclase laths (2 - 5 cm in diameter). Such flows are intercalated with ones that are nearly aphyric or that bear plagioclase (plag) phenocrysts of 0.5-2 cm. Addition textures are distinctive radial, snowflake plag clusters and sandwich glomerocrysts of plag, with olivine trapped between laths. These clusters and glomerocrysts are typically 1, but as large as 3 cm in diameter. Plag composition of all textural types is limited (An76-60). Plag dominates the phenocryst mode; rare flows, mainly low in the section, have olivine > plag and phenocrystic clinopyroxene occurs rarely, and mainly high in the section. Unlike the flows, dikes have few phenocrysts; giant laths are rare and the snowflake texture has not been observed. Giant plag laths are euhedral and make up a few percent to more than 50% of the rock. Many plag megacrysts are made of several plag crystals that form a mosaic, where the constituent crystals are crystallographically distinct and are overgrown with feldspar to make the crystal euhedral. We describe these composite megacrysts as \"mosaicrysts\". We are exploring magmatic conditions that would trigger oversaturation to spawn rapid growth yielding clusters and overgrowths that form mosaicrysts. Giant plagioclase basalts (so-called GPB) are also described for the Deccan and Emeishan flood basalt provinces attesting to similar magmatic processes. Plag laths typically define strong flow foliation at the flow base, have a swirled distribution in the flow core, and are sparse in the top. Some particularly crystal-rich flows (or sills) have an abrupt transition to a crystal-poor upper few decimeters of the several-m- thick flow. We interpret the crystal-poor top to be the expelled melt from crystal accumulation in the flow, which locally reinjects and is entrained in lower crystal mush.\n\nCytogenetic Diversity of Simple Sequences Repeats in Morphotypes of Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZheng, Jin-shuang; Sun, Cheng-zhen; Zhang, Shu-ning; Hou, Xi-lin; Bonnema, Guusje\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA significant fraction of the nuclear DNA of all eukaryotes is comprised of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Although these sequences are widely used for studying genetic variation, linkage mapping and evolution, little attention had been paid to the chromosomal distribution and cytogenetic diversity of these sequences. In this paper, we report the distribution characterization of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide SSRs in Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to characterize the cytogenetic diversity of SSRs among morphotypes of B. rapa ssp. chinensis. The proportion of different SSR motifs varied among morphotypes of B. rapa ssp. chinensis, with tri-nucleotide SSRs being more prevalent in the genome of B. rapa ssp. chinensis. We determined the chromosomal locations of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide repeat loci. The results showed that the chromosomal distribution of SSRs in the different morphotypes is non-random and motif-dependent, and allowed us to characterize the relative variability in terms of SSR numbers and similar chromosomal distributions in centromeric/peri-centromeric heterochromatin. The differences between SSR repeats with respect to abundance and distribution indicate that SSRs are a driving force in the genomic evolution of B. rapa species. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the SSR sequence distribution and evolution for comparison among morphotypes B. rapa ssp. chinensis.

Mature parental shrimp were exposed to 4 or 10 mg L-1 NFLX for 2 or 5 d. Ovary and eggs of the shrimp were sampled after spawning in order to detect NFLX residue using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that NFLX residue accumulated in F. chinensis eggs after the parental exposure, with the highest residue detected in ovary. To examine the fate of NFLX residue in larvae, we further determined the concentration of NFLX residue in F. chinensis eggs and larvae at 4 different developmental stages after 24-h exposure. From the newly metamorphosed larvae (0 h post-metamorphosis, h.p.m), samples were taken at different time intervals to 72 h.p.m. HPLC assay showed that the concentrations of NFLX residue in zoea exposed to 4 and 10 mg L-1 NFLX were the highest at 1.5 h, i.e., 0.332 and 0.454 Î¼g g-1, respectively. At the two NFLX exposure levels, the elimination time of half NFLX (half life) in nauplius was 45.36 and 49.85 h, respectively, followed by that in zoea (31.68 and 33.13 h), mysis larvae (42.24 and 47.28 h) and postlarvae (24.48 and 30.96 h). Both NFLX exposure levels had a germicidal effect. The distribution and elimination of NFLX residue in F. chinensis tissue, eggs and larvae correlated well with the drug exposure level. The disappearance of NFLX residue coincided with the larval growth, and the half-life of NFLX decreased with the larval development.\n\n[Diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi from Taxus chinensis var. mairei].\n\nPubMed\n\n2014-07-01\n\nA total of 628 endophytic fungi were isolated from 480 tissue segments of needles and branches of Taxus chinensis var. mairei. According to morphological characteristics and ITS sequences, they represented 43 taxa in 28 genera, of which 10 Hyphomycetes, 20 Coelomycetes, 12 Ascomycetes and 1 unknown fungus. Phomopsis mali was confirmed as the dominant species. In accordance with relative frequency, Alternaria alternata, Aureobasidium pullulans, Colletotrichum boninense, C. gloeosporioides, Epicoccum nigrum , Fungal sp., Fusarium lateritium, Glomerella cingulata, Magnaporthales sp. , Nigrospora oryzae, Pestalotiopsis maculiformans, P. microspora, Peyronellaea glomerata and Xylaria sp. 1 were more common in T. chinensis var. mairei. T. chinensis var. mairei were severely infected by endophytic fungi. Endophytic fungi were found in 81 percent of plant tissues with a high diversity. Distribution ranges of endophytic fungi were influenced by tissue properties. The colonization rate, richness, diversity of endophytic fungi in needles were obviously lower than in branches, and kinds of endophytic fungi between branches were more similar than those in needles, thus endophytic fungi had tissue preference. In addition, tissue age influenced the community structure of endophytic fungi. The elder branch tissues were, the higher colonization rate, richness, diversity of endophytic fungi were. Systematic studying the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi in T. chinensis var. mairei and clarifying their distribution regularity in plant tissues would offer basic data and scientific basis for their development and utilization. Discussing the presence of fungal pathogens in healthy plant tissues would be of positive significance for source protection of T. chinensis var. mairei.\n\nReintroduction and Post-Release Survival of a Living Fossil: The Chinese Giant Salamander\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Lu; Jiang, Wei; Wang, Qi-Jun; Zhao, Hu; Zhang, Hong-Xing; Marcec, Ruth M.; Willard, Scott T.; Kouba, Andrew J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCaptive rearing and reintroduction / translocation are increasingly used as tools to supplement wild populations of threatened species. Reintroducing captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders may help to augment the declining wild populations and conserve this critically endangered amphibian. We released 31 captive-reared juvenile giant salamanders implanted with VHF radio transmitters at the Heihe River (n = 15) and the Donghe River (n = 16) in the Qinling Mountains of central China. Salamanders were monitored every day for survival from April 28th 2013 to September 3rd 2014. We attempted to recapture all living individuals by the end of the study, measured their body mass and total body length, and checked for abnormalities and presence of external parasites. Two salamanders at the Heihe River and 10 animals at the Donghe River survived through the project timeline. Nine salamanders were confirmed dead, while the status of the other 10 animals was undetermined. The annual survival rate of giant salamanders at the Donghe River (0.702) was 1.7-fold higher than that at the Heihe River (0.405). Survival increased as individuals were held longer following surgery, whereas body mass did not have a significant impact on survival rate. All salamanders recaptured from the Donghe River (n = 8) increased in mass (0.50 Â± 0.13 kg) and length (5.5 Â± 1.5 cm) after approximately 11 months in the wild, and they were only 7% lighter than wild animals of the same length (mean residual = -0.033 Â± 0.025). Our results indicate that captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders can survive in the wild one year after release and adequate surgical recovery time is extremely important to post-release survival. Future projects may reintroduce older juveniles to achieve better survival and longer monitoring duration.

Tanaka (synonym Tupistra chinensis Baker) on HL-60 cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nYi, Xiaomin; Xiang, Limin; Huang, Yuying; Wang, Yihai; He, Xiangjiu\n\n2018-03-15\n\nOur previous study has revealed that the spirostanol saponins isolated from the rhizomes of Rohdea chinensis (Baker) N. Tanaka (synonym Tupistra chinensis Baker) (Convallariaceae) (a reputed folk medicine) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity. However, the underlying mechanism of purified saponins remains unclear. More studies are necessary to assess the apoptosis and autophagy activities of the saponins from R. chinensis and clarify their antiproliferative mechanisms. The present study certificated the potential antiproliferative activity and mechanism of 5Î²-spirost-25(27)-en-1Î²,3Î²-diol-1-O-Î±-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1â2)- Î²-D-xylopyranosyl-3-O-Î±-L-rhamnopyranoside (SPD), a spirostanol saponin from R. chinensis, against human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). The antiproliferative activity of SPD in vitro was evaluated by MTT assay compared with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II). The autophagic activity was assessed using MDC staining and western blot, cell apoptosis inspection was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and the mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by JC-1 fluorescence dye combined with flow cytometry. The potential mechanisms for protein levels of apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated by western blot. Treatment of HL-60 cells with SPD resulted in growth inhibition (IC 50 value of 2.0Â Â±Â 0.2Â ÂµM, after 48Â h treatment) and induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Results from Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining assay and mitochondrial membrane potential detection showed that apoptosis was happened after SPD treatment. The regulation of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, PARP following SPD treatment contributed to the induction of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Meanwhile, SPD induced autophagy related with Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling and activated of AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, blocking autophagy with bafilomycin A1 reduced the cytotoxicity of SPD in HL-60 cells.

During the past decade, research on plant polysaccharides has gained importance due to their therapeutic value and minimum side effects. In this study, hot water extraction method was employed to isolate polysaccharides from the stems of T. chinensis and stems with hooks of U. rhyncophylla. Size-exclusion chromatography was then used for further fractionation. Separated fractions from T. chinensis were designated as TCP-1, TCP-2 and TCP-3 and those from U. rhyncophylla were termed UC-1 and UC-2. Their sugar compositions were estimated using gas chromatography that revealed the presence fructose, glucose, xylose, arbinose, and rhamnose. Amino acid analysis of these fractions has indicated that they are protein-bound polysaccharides. The antioxidant activities were investigated using DPPH and yeast assays. The ability of these polysaccharide fractions to stimulate mouse macrophages was measured using Griess reagent and ELISA test. The results revealed that some of the isolated fractions (TCP-2, TCP-3, UC-1 and UC-2) displayed significant antioxidant activities and were also found to be effective immunomodulators in a concentration-dependent manner. Outcomes of this research strongly indicate that U. rhyncophylla and T. chinensis have therapeutic potential to be used for the treatment of cancer. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty bovine dentine blocks were divided into two groups and individually treated with two levels of demineralization solutions to form erosive and subsurface artificial carious lesions in vitro. Each group was then divided into three subgroups, each of which were treated with a remineralization solution (positive control), deionized water (negative control), or 4â000 mgâ L(-1) aqueous solutions of Galla chinensis extract. The dentine blocks were then subjected to a pH-cycling regime for 7 days. During the first 4 days, the daily cycle included 21-h deal and 3-h demineralization applications. The dentine blocks were dealt with the entire day during the remaining 3 days. Two specimens from each of the treatment groups were selected and observed under a polarized light microscope. Data collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope were computerized and analyzed. Galla chinensis extract clearly enhanced the remineralization of both erosive lesion and subsurface lesion patterns in the specimens (P<0.05). The level of remineralization of the erosive lesion by Galla chinensis extract was lower than that of the subsurface lesion (P<0.05). In addition, the remineralization of the subsurface lesion by Galla chinensis extract was higher than that of the remineralization solution (P<0.05). No significant difference between the remineralization of erosive lesions by Galla chinensis extract and the remineralization solution was observed (P>0.05). So Galla chinensis extract has the potential to improve the remineralization of artificial root lesions under dynamic pH-cyclic conditions, indicating its potential use as a natural remineralization medicine.\n\nBioaccumulation and detoxification mechanisms for lead uptake identified in Rhus chinensis Mill. seedlings.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Chuifan; Huang, Meiying; Ren, Huijun; Yu, Jiaoda; Wu, Jiamei; Ma, Xiangqing\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA greenhouse experiment was conducted to assay the bioaccumulation and tolerance characteristics of Rhus chinensis Mill. to lead (Pb). The effects of exposing R. chinensis Mill seedlings to increasing Pb concentrations (0, 250, 500, 100mgkg-1) in the soil were assessed by measuring Pb accumulation, subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, photosynthetic characteristics, antioxidative enzyme activity, malondialdehyde content, and phytochelatin content. The majority of Pb taken up by R. chinensis Mill was associated with the cell wall fraction in the roots, where the absorption of Ca increased to maintain cell wall stability, and Pb deposits were found in the intercellular space or in the cell wall structures. In leaves, Pb was primarily stored in the cell wall, while it was compartmentalized into the vacuolar structures in the stem. Pb concentrations adversely affected the morphology of Rhus chinensis Mill cellular substructures. Furthermore, increased Peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity was observed in plants grown in Pb-amended soil, and this may have led to reduced ROS to maintain the function of the membrane. Changes in phytochelatin levels (PCs) that were observed in Pb treated plants suggest that PCs formed complexes with Pb in the cytoplasm to reduce Pb 2+ toxicity in the metabolically active cellular compartment. This mechanism may allow for the plant to accumulate higher concentrations of toxic Pb and survive for a longer period of time. Our study provides a better understanding of how Rhus chinensis Mill detoxifies Pb. Copyright Â© 2017.

We studied the effect of chronic consumption of S. chinensis Baill on blood glucose and lipid profile in STZ-induced diabetic male rats fed high fat diet. Male rats weighing 100-120 g were fed 30% fat diet with and without 10% freeze-dried leaves of S. chinensis Baill for 7 weeks after 1 week of adaptation. The rats were rendered diabetic by intravenous injection of STZ (60 mg/kg) after 6-week feeding of the assigned diets. At 1 week after the injection, the rats were sacrificed after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose (380.2 +/- 14.4 mg/dL), total cholesterol (93.9 +/- 7.9 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels (123.6 +/- 7.5 mg/dL) of the S. chinensis Baill group were significantly lower than those of the control group (418.1 +/- 12.0 mg/dL, 119.9 +/- 9.4 mg/dL, 152.0 +/- 10.3 mg/dL, respectively, p<0.05). Chronic consumption of S. chinesis Baill significantly decreased maltase activity of the small intestinal mucosa (120.1 +/- 8.7 U/g protein) compared with the control group (96.8 +/- 7.0 U/g protein, p<0.05). These results suggest that S. chinensis Baill have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase activity in the animal model of diabetes mellitus.\n\n[Regularity of changes in main active components of Schisandra chinensis before and after being processed with vinegar].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Li; Xiao, Yong-Qing; Yu, Ding-Rong; Ma, Yin-Lian; Zhu, Ming-Gui; Chen, Liang\n\n2012-12-01\n\nTo investigate the regularity of changes in the main active components of Schisandra chinensis preparations before and after being processed with vinegar. High performance liquid chromatography was used to analyze the changes in the content of lignans and organic acids in S. chinensis preparations before and after being processed with vinegar. After being processed with vinegar, the content of lignans in S. chinensis preparations significantly reduced, while that of organic acids significantly increased. The ratio between them reduced from 1:16 (raw product) to 1:21 (vinegar products). The changes in the main pharmacological effects of S. chinensis are related to not only the changes in the contents of lignan and organic acids, but also the significant changes in the ratio relations between the two components. This is of great significance to the correlation among the principle of S. chinensis processed with vinegar and material basis and the changes in pharmacological effects.\n\nNew dicyclopeptides from Dianthus chinensis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Jing; Wang, Zhe; Zheng, Yu-Qing; Zeng, Guang-Zhi; He, Wen-Jun; Tan, Ning-Hua\n\n2014-05-01\n\nOne new dicyclopeptide cyclo-(L-N-methyl Glu-L-N-methyl Glu) (1), together with one new natural dicyclopeptide cyclo-(L-methyl Glu ester-L-methyl Glu ester) (2), and two known dicyclopeptides cyclo-(L-methyl Glu ester-L-Glu) (3), and cyclo-(L-Glu-L-Glu) (4), were isolated from the aerial parts of Dianthus chinensis L.

Rhizosphere soil from field continuously cropped for one-year, three-year and five-year by Coptis chinensis Franch. was collected and analyzed. Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that continuous cropping of C. chinensis resulted in a significant and continuous decline in the richness and diversity of soil fungal population. Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla of fungi detected in rhizosphere soil. Fungal genera such as Phoma, Volutella, Pachycudonia, Heterodermia, Gibberella, Cladosporium, Trichocladium, and Sporothrix, were more dominant in continuously cropped samples for three-year and five-year compared to that for one-year. By contrast, genera, such as Zygosaccharomyces, Pseudotaeniolina, Hydnum, Umbelopsis, Humicola, Crustoderma, Psilocybe, Coralloidiomyces, Mortierella, Polyporus, Pyrenula, and Monographella showed higher relative abundance in one-year samples than that in three-year and five-year samples. Cluster analysis of the fungal communities from three samples of rhizosphere soil from C. chinensis field revealed that the fungal community composition, diversity, and structure were significantly affected by the continuous cropping. Continuous cropping of C. chinensis also led to significant declines in soil pH, urease, and catalase activities. Redundancy analysis showed that the soil pH had the most significant effect on soil fungal population under continuous cropping of C. chinensis.

The results showed that there was no significant difference in these clonal characteristics except spacer length and ramet population density between the two types of L. chinensis, and yellow-green type, with less spacer length and more ramet density than grey-green type, should be more adaptable to the resourceful habitat. Moreover, the V-indices of the clonal architecture of two divergent L. chinensis types were all close to 1, and the difference was not significant. Therefore, both of the two types belonged to typical guerilla clonal plant.\n\nCoptis chinensis Polysaccharides Inhibit Advanced Glycation End Product Formation.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Ye; Li, Yun; Yin, Dengke; Chen, Song; Gao, Xiangdong\n\n2016-06-01\n\nCoptis chinensis Franch (Huanglian) is commonly used to treat diabetes in China. In this study, the effects of the C. chinensis Franch polysaccharides (CCP) on advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation in vitro and in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were investigated. CCP significantly inhibited all the three periods of nonenzymatic protein glycation in vitro, including Amadori product, dicarbonyl compound, and AGE formation (Pâ<â.01). In diabetic mice, the administration of CCP not only improved both bodyweight and serum insulin and decreased fasting blood glucose and glycated serum protein concentrations but also decreased the AGE accumulations and morphological abnormalities in pancreas and liver. The inhibitory effects of CCP on AGE formation afford a potential therapeutic use in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.\n\nBaseline survey of root-associated microbes of Taxus chinensis (Pilger) Rehd.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Qian; Liu, Hongwei; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W; Wu, Jianqiang; Hoffman, Angela; Cheng, Junwen; Qiu, Deyou\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTaxol (paclitaxel) a diterpenoid is one of the most effective anticancer drugs identified.

This paper studied the photosynthetic responses of 2-year-old pot-cultured S. chinensis to different levels of water stress and temperature. The results indicated that under mild and moderate water stress, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of S. chinensis leaves was decreased to 92.3% and 74.3% of the control, respectively, which was mainly attributed to stomatal limitation; and under severe water stress, the Pn was decreased to 44.4% of the control, which might be mainly linked to non-stomatal limitation. The appropriate temperature for S. chinensis photosynthesis was from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C. At 39 degrees C, the Pn, water use efficiency (WUE), and maximal photochemistry efficiency (Fv/Fm) were decreased significantly, while the dark respiration rate (Rd) and transpiration rate (Tr) were enhanced significantly. With increasing water stress and temperature, some photosynthetic parameters including light saturation point (LSP), apparent quantum yield (AQY) and maximal CO2 assimilation rate (Pmax) decreased to certain extents, while light compensation point (LCP) increased, suggesting that both severe water stress and higher temperature were the important environmental factors affecting the survival of S. chinensis.\n\nAntitumor immunostimulatory activity of polysaccharides from Salvia chinensis Benth.\n\nPubMed\n\nShu, Guangwen; Zhao, Wenhao; Yue, Ling; Su, Hanwen; Xiang, Meixian\n\n2015-06-20\n\nSalvia chinensis Benth (S. chinensis) is a traditional herb applied in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Polysaccharides abundantly exist in this plant. However, it remains poorly understood if polysaccharides from S. chinensis (PSSC) contribute to its anti-HCC activity. The in vivo anti-HCC activity of PSSC was evaluated in Kunming mice bearing H22 ascitic hepatoma cells. An array of physiological indexes was measured to evaluate toxicological effects on host animals. Subgroups of immune cells were purified by a magnetic-activated cell sorting system and analyzed by flow cytometry. Reverse transcription real-time PCR and immunoblotting were recruited to determine the effects of PSSC on the cellular signaling of different subgroup of immune cells. PSSC suppressed in vivo proliferation of H22 cells with undetectable toxic effects on tumor-bearing mice. PSSC alleviated tumor transplantation-induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis and dysregulation of serum cytokine profiles, which elevated cytotoxic activities of natural killer and CD8+ T cells. PSSC reduced serum levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Injection of exogenous PGE2 completely abrogated the antitumor immunostimulatory activity of PSSC. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is the second messager of PGE2. In CD4+ T cells, PSSC substantially declined intracellular cAMP. This event elevated protein levels of JAK3, enhancing STAT5 phosphorylation and STAT5-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Cyclooxygenase-2 is the key enzyme mediating biosynthesis of PGE2. PSSC suppressed the transcription and translation of cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor associated macrophages. Our data clearly showed antitumor immunostimulatory activity of PSSC against transplanted H22 HCC cells. Suppressing tumor transplantation-induced PGE2 production was implicated in the anti-tumor immunostimulatory activity of PSSC. These works provides novel insights into the traditional application of S. chinensis against HCC and supported\n\n[Study on the chemical constituents of the fruit handles from Schizandra chinensis].\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Lin; He, Xiao-Xia; Pan, Ying; Han, Ling; Yang, Xiao-Ou; Zhao, Yu-Qing\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTo study the chemical constituents of the fruit handles from Schizandra chinensis.

This study evaluated the separate and combined effects of precipitation and defoliation on net primary productivity (NPP) and composition of a L. chinensis steppe to promote the sustainable development of temperate grasslands through improved management practices. The effects of three precipitation gradients (precipitation unchanged, reduced by 50%, and increased by 50%) and two clipping intensities (clipping once or twice per year) were examined on NPP and composition of the L. chinensis community using a 7-year in situ controlled trial at the Guyuan State Key Monitoring and Research Station of Grassland Ecosystem in China. The results showed that: (1) a 50% reduction in natural precipitation significantly decreased NPP; a 50% increase in precipitation did not significantly increase NPP, but it decreased the importance value of L. chinensis because more water promoted the growth of competing species. (2) Clipping twice per year increased NPP, but the increase was from the dry matter of other species (DMO) component, and not from the dry matter of L. chinensis. (3) The standardized coefficients of a regression model (Î²) for DMO, NPP, and the importance value of L. chinensis were 0.685, 0.532, and -0.608 for precipitation, and 0.369, 0.419, and -0.276 for clipping mode, respectively. This study demonstrated that variation in precipitationis the key driver of NPP and composition of a L. chinensis steppe under the precipitation range and clipping intensities evaluated. This improved understanding of the effects of precipitation and clipping on NPP and composition will allow for improved, sustainable management of L. chinensis temperate grassland steppes.\n\nEffects of precipitation and clipping intensity on net primary productivity and composition of a Leymus chinensis temperate grassland steppe\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Kun; Hannaway, David B.; Li, Xianglin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLeymus chinensis (Trin.) is the dominant vegetation type in eastern Eurasian temperate grasslands but is decreasing due to the combined pressure of reduced precipitation and overgrazing.

The 1740âbp fragment 5'-flanking sequence of the dbat gene was cloned from Taxus chinensis cells. Important regulatory elements needed for activity of the dbat promoter were located by deletion analyses in T.Â chinensis cells. A novel WRKY transcription factor, TcWRKY1, was isolated with the yeast one-hybrid system from a T.Â chinensis cell cDNA library using the important regulatory elements as bait. The gene expression of TcWRKY1 in T.Â chinensis suspension cells was specifically induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Biochemical analysis indicated that TcWRKY1 protein specifically interacts with the two W-box (TGAC) cis-elements among the important regulatory elements. Overexpression of TcWRKY1 enhanced dbat expression in T.Â chinensis suspension cells, and RNA interference (RNAi) reduced the level of transcripts of dbat. These results suggest that TcWRKY1 participates in regulation of taxol biosynthesis in T.Â chinensis cells, and that dbat is a target gene of this transcription factor. This research also provides a potential candidate gene for engineering increased taxol accumulation in Taxus cell cultures.

However, few studies have evaluated the patterns of species distribution that were influenced by the Yellow River. The present work analyzed the demography of two endemic tree species that are widely distributed along the Yellow River, Tamarix austromongolica and Tamarix chinensis, to understand the role of the Yellow River and Pleistocene climate in shaping their distribution patterns. The most common chlorotype, chlorotype 1, was found in all populations, and its divergence time could be dated back to 0.19 million years ago (Ma). This dating coincides well with the formation of the modern Yellow River and the timing of Marine Isotope Stages 5e-6 (MIS 5e-6). Bayesian reconstructions along with models of paleodistribution revealed that these two species experienced a demographic expansion in population size during the Quaternary period. Approximate Bayesian computation analyses supported a scenario of expansion approximately from the upper to lower reaches of the Yellow River. Our results provide support for the roles of the Yellow River and the Pleistocene climate in driving demographic expansion of the populations of T. austromongolica and T. chinensis. These findings are useful for understanding the effects of geological events and past climatic fluctuations on species distribution patterns.\n\nRBF neural network prediction on weak electrical signals in Aloe vera var. chinensis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Lanzhou; Zhao, Jiayin; Wang, Miao\n\n2008-10-01\n\nA Gaussian radial base function (RBF) neural network forecast on signals in the Aloe vera var. chinensis by the wavelet soft-threshold denoised as the time series and using the delayed input window chosen at 50, is set up to forecast backward. There was the maximum amplitude at 310.45Î¼V, minimum -75.15Î¼V, average value -2.69Î¼V and <1.5Hz at frequency in Aloe vera var. chinensis respectively. The electrical signal in Aloe vera var. chinensis is a sort of weak, unstable and low frequency signals. A result showed that it is feasible to forecast plant electrical signals for the timing by the RBF. The forecast data can be used as the preferences for the intelligent autocontrol system based on the adaptive characteristic of plants to achieve the energy saving on the agricultural production in the plastic lookum or greenhouse.\n\nTranscriptome Exploration in Leymus chinensis under Saline-Alkaline Treatment Using 454 Pyrosequencing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSun, Yepeng; Wang, Fawei; Wang, Nan; Dong, Yuanyuan; Liu, Qi; Zhao, Lei; Chen, Huan; Liu, Weican; Yin, Hailong; Zhang, Xiaomei; Yuan, Yanxi; Li, Haiyan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. is a high saline-alkaline tolerant forage grass genus of the tribe Gramineae family, which also plays an important role in protection of natural environment. To date, little is known about the saline-alkaline tolerance of L. chinensis on the molecular level. To better understand the molecular mechanism of saline-alkaline tolerance in L. chinensis, 454 pyrosequencing was used for the transcriptome study. Results We used Roche-454 massive parallel pyrosequencing technology to sequence two different cDNA libraries that were built from the two samples of control and under saline-alkaline treatment (optimal stress concentration-Hoagland solution with 100 mM NaCl and 200 mM NaHCO3). A total of 363,734 reads in control group and 526,267 reads in treatment group with an average length of 489 bp and 493 bp were obtained, respectively. The reads were assembled into 104,105 unigenes with MIRA sequence assemable software, among which, 73,665 unigenes were in control group, 88,016 unigenes in treatment group and 57,576 unigenes in both groups. According to the comparative expression analysis between the two groups with the threshold of âlog2 Ratio â¥1â, there were 36,497 up-regulated unegenes and 18,218 down-regulated unigenes predicted to be the differentially expressed genes. After gene annotation and pathway enrichment analysis, most of them were involved in stress and tolerant function, signal transduction, energy production and conversion, and inorganic ion transport. Furthermore, 16 of these differentially expressed genes were selected for real-time PCR validation, and they were successfully confirmed with the results of 454 pyrosequencing. Conclusions This work is the first time to study the transcriptome of L. chinensis under saline-alkaline treatment based on the 454-FLX massively parallel DNA sequencing platform. It also deepened studies on molecular mechanisms of saline-alkaline in L. chinensis, and constituted a\n\nBaseline Survey of Root-Associated Microbes of Taxus chinensis (Pilger) Rehd\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Wu, Jianqiang; Hoffman, Angela; Cheng, Junwen; Qiu, Deyou\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTaxol (paclitaxel) a diterpenoid is one of the most effective anticancer drugs identified.

Murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with various concentrations of C. chinensis water extraction at different time intervals. The antioxidant effect of C. chinensis on MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated using MTT and TUNEL assays. The effect of C. chinensis on cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide. Lipid peroxidation was measured by the HPLC method. The cellular redox status was determined from the reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) and the enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, including glutathione reductase (GR), Glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The changes in relative mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) in the MC3T3-E1 cells were analyzed with rhodamine 123 staining. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the levels of cytochrome c (cyto c), Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, Sirt3, and IDH2 expressions. The C. chinensis water extraction protects tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated MC3T3-E1 cells from death in a dose-dependent manner. C. chinensis treatment significantly inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), GR, GST, and G6PD. The release of cyto c from mitochondria was reduced by C. chinensis, which increased the expression of antiapoptotic IDH2, Sirt3, and Bcl-2 and decreased the expression of Bax, cyto c, and caspase 3. C. chinensis modulated the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells, probably due to its antioxidant activity and functioning via mitochondria-dependent pathways.

Extended air exposure through water body drawdown is one management action used for control. In North America, the Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis) is an invasive aquatic snail with an expanding range, but eradication methods for this species are not well documented. We assessed the ability of B. chinensis to survive different durations of air exposure, and observed behavioral responses prior to, during, and following desiccation events. Individual B. chinensis specimens survived air exposure in a laboratory setting for > 9 weeks, and survivorship was greater among adults than juveniles. Several B. chinensis specimens responded to desiccation by sealing their opercula and/or burrowing in mud substrate. Our results indicate that drawdowns alone may not be an effective means of eliminating B. chinensis. This study lays the groundwork for future management research that may determine the effectiveness of drawdowns when combined with factors such as extreme temperatures, predation, or molluscicides.\n\nCoptis Chinensis affects the function of glioma cells through the down-regulation of phosphorylation of STAT3 by reducing HDAC3.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jiangan; Ni, Lulu; Li, Bing; Wang, Mingdeng; Ding, Zhemin; Xiong, Chunrong; Lu, Xiaojie\n\n2017-12-06\n\nGlioma remains the most common cause of brain cancer-related mortality. Glioma accounts for 50-60% of brain cancer. Due to their low toxicity and infrequent side effects, traditional herbs have been increasingly popular. Coptis Chinensis is commonly used in cancer treatment in combination with other Chinese Medicine herbs. However, little is known about its biological functions and mechanisms in glioma cells. In this study, the anti-glioma cell effect of Coptis Chinensis was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, plate clone test, scratch tests, flow cytometry, western blotting and a glioma xenograft tumor model. The results showed that Coptis Chinensis significantly suppressed glioma cell proliferation, tumor formation, migration and tumor growth, and prolonged the survival time of glioma cell-bearing mice. The flow cytometry result showed that Coptis Chinensis induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioma cells. Western blotting showed that Coptis Chinensis down-regulated the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation levels and reduced the expression of Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and caspase 3. Coptis Chinensis can inhibit various aspects of glioma cell functions. This study provides favorable scientific evidence for the potential use of natural products such as Coptis Chinensis in the clinical treatment of patients with glioma.\n\nDNA barcoding implicates 23 species and four orders as potential pollinators of Chinese knotweed (Persicaria chinensis) in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, M-M; Lim, C-L; Wilson, J-J\n\n2015-08-01\n\nChinese knotweed (Persicaria chinensis) is of ecological and economic importance as a high-risk invasive species and a traditional medicinal herb. However, the insects associated with P. chinensis pollination have received scant attention. As a widespread invasive plant we would expect P. chinensis to be associated with a diverse group of insect pollinators, but lack of taxonomic identification capacity is an impediment to confirm this expectation. In the present study we aimed to elucidate the insect pollinators of P. chinensis in peninsular Malaysia using DNA barcoding. Forty flower visitors, representing the range of morphological diversity observed, were captured at flowers at Ulu Kali, Pahang, Malaysia. Using Automated Barcode Gap Discovery, 17 morphospecies were assigned to 23 species representing at least ten families and four orders. Using the DNA barcode library (BOLD) 30% of the species could be assigned a species name, and 70% could be assigned a genus name. The insects visiting P. chinensis were broadly similar to those previously reported as visiting Persicaria japonica, including honey bees (Apis), droneflies (Eristalis), blowflies (Lucilia) and potter wasps (Eumedes), but also included thrips and ants.\n\nMorphological beak differences of loliginid squid, Uroteuthis chinensis and Uroteuthis edulis, in the northern South China Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJin, Yue; Liu, Bilin; Chen, Xinjun; Staples, Kevin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe mitre squid ( Uroteuthis chinensis) and the swordtip squid ( U. edulis) are Indo-Pacific cephalopod species that are abundant in the western Pacific Ocean. They are currently exploited in the East and South China Seas and make up a significant portion of the Chinese neritic squid catch. Beaks, the feeding organs of squid, are important for individual size and biomass estimation because of their high resistance to degradation in predator stomachs and consistent dimensions. In this study, 104 U. chinensis and 143 U. edulis individuals were sampled from northern South China Sea with mantle length from 70 to 260 mm and 96 to 284 mm, respectively. The results indicated that morphological beak values were greater for U. edulis, compared to U. chinensis, for upper hood length (UHL), upper crest length (UCL), upper lateral wall length (ULWL), lower crest length (LCL), and lower lateral wall length (LLWL). According to principal component analysis, UHL/ML, UCL/ML, ULWL/ML, LCL/ML, LLWL/ML and LWL/ML could represent the characteristics of beaks for U. chinensis, while UHL/ML, UCL/ML, ULWL/ML, LHL/ML, LCL/ML and LLWL/ML could represent it for U. edulis. According to Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values, a power function was the most suitable model for U. chinensis, while a linear function was the most suitable model for U. edulis. The beak variable-mantle length ratio (beak variable/mantle length) declined with the increasing of mantle length and declined sharply at the early stage of growth in both beaks and species. The ratio changed quickly after achieving the mantle length of 140 mm for U. chinensis, while the ratio changed quickly after 170 mm for U. edulis. Beaks in both species experienced sharper changes through maturity stage I to II than other maturity stages. This study gives us basic beak morphology information for U. chinensis and U. edulis in the East and South China Seas. Geometric morphological methods combined with dietary analysis should be used\n\nMachine learning for the prediction of L.Â chinensis carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents and understanding of mechanisms underlying grassland degradation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yuefen; Liang, Shuo; Zhao, Yiying; Li, Wenbo; Wang, Yuejiao\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe grasslands of Western Jilin Province in China have experienced severe degradation during the last 50 years. Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and support vector machines (SVM) were used to predict the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of Leymus chinensis (L.Â chinensis) and explore the degree of grassland degradation using the matter-element extension model. Both RBFNN and SVM demonstrated good prediction accuracy. The results indicated that there was severe degradation, as samples were mainly concen"
