        "text": "Group 1 chromosomes of the Triticeae tribe have been studied extensively because many important genes have been assigned to them. In this paper, chromosome 1 linkage maps of Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, and T. monococcum are compared with existing barley and rye maps to develop a consensus map for Triticeae species and thus facilitate the mapping of agronomic genes in this tribe. The consensus map that was developed consists of 14 agronomically important genes, 17 DNA markers that were derived from known-function clones, and 76 DNA markers derived from anonymous clones. There are 12 inconsistencies in the order of markers among seven wheat, four barley, and two rye maps. A comparison of the Triticeae group 1 chromosome consensus map with linkage maps of homoeologous chromosomes in rice indicates that the linkage maps for the long arm and the proximal portion of the short arm of group 1 chromosomes are conserved among these species. Similarly, gene order is conserved between Triticeae chromosome 1 and its homoeologous chromosome in oat. The location of the centromere in rice and oat chromosomes is estimated from its position in homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of Triticeae.\n\nAn earlier genetic mapping study with an unidentified Russian Wheat Aphid resistance gene, referred to as Dn? and derived from PI 294994, suggested that the gene occurs close to the centromere on 7DS. Closer inspection of the map data showed that mild segregation distortion occurred at some of the loci (including Dn? which could have affected conclusions regarding the gene order. As a result, and depending on the gene order inferred in the analysis, Dn? could be mapped on either side of the 7D centromere. A telosomic analysis was therefore undertaken in order to confirm the map position or to determine the true location of Dn? However, physical mapping showed that Dn? was not even located on chromosome 7D and it was concluded that it may be the same gene as Dn4 on 1DL. The result cautions that even mildly distorted segregation data could be very misleading and that genetic mapping results based on such data need to be confirmed independently, preferably by physical mapping.\n\nAn octoploid triticale was derived from the F, of a Russian wheat aphid-resistant rye, ‘Turkey 77’, and ‘Chinese Spring’ wheat. The alloploid was crossed to common wheat, and to ‘Imperial’ rye/‘Chinese Spring’ disomic addition lines. F2, progeny from these crosses were tested for Russian wheat aphid resistance and C-banded. A resistance gene(s) was found to be associated with chromosome arm IRS of the ‘Turkey 77’ rye genome. A monotelosomic IRS (‘Turkey 77’) addition plant was then crossed with the wheat cultivar ‘Gamtoos’, which has the 1BL.1RS ‘Veery’ translocation. Unlike the IRS segment in ‘Gamtoos’, the ‘Turkey 77’-derived 1 RS telosome did not express the rust resistance genes Sr31 and Ar26, which could then be used as markers. From the F, a monotelosomic 1 RS addition plant that was also heterozygous for the 1BL. 1 RS translocation was selected and testerossed with an aphid-susceptible common wheat, ‘Inia 66’ Meiotic pairing between the rye arms resulted in the recovery of five euploid Russian-wheat-aphid-resistant plants. One recombinant also retained Sr31 and Lr26 and was selfed to produce translocation homozygotes.\n\nTwo Triticum monococcum accessions were found to be highly resistant to the Russian wheat aphid. An attempt was made to transfer the resistance to common wheat through direct hybridization or by using bridge species. In each of the four crossing strategies tried, a gradual loss of resistance occurred as hybrids with higher ploidy levels were obtained. It appeared that the level of resistance observed was directly proportional to the ratio of the Triticum monococcum genome relative to other genomes. This would indicate suppression of the resistance gene(s) by the added genomes or dilution of its product(s) by those of homoeoloci. The degree of protection afforded by the gene(s) at the hexaploid level may prove to be small. Plants suspected to be homozygous for the resistance gene(s) were identified; however, further backcrossing to common wheat will be required to improve their agronomic types and meiotic regularities."
