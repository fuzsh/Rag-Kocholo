        "text": "Had an amazingly rewarding day yesterday. Started the day working together with our Intergovernmental Affairs team to make tie-blankets for the Children's Assessment Center in San Bernardino. The event was organized as part of an effort to make 2,000 blankets in 2023 for children in the San Bernardino community. The Center is a collaboration between San Bernardino County and Loma Linda University Children's Hospital and plays a vital role in evaluating child abuse allegations while creating a child-focused atmosphere that reduces trauma for young victims and their families. Each child they encounter are given a blanket, and often these blankets end up the only possession of theirs as they move through the foster system. I then ended the day spending quality time with my family and thousands of co-workers at Team Member Appreciation Day at Universal Studios. The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians gave tickets to all employees and their families to take a day away from work and have some fun - they even had the park stay open exclusively for us at the end of the night! It’s truly humbling to work for an employer who cares so much about both their community and their employees. Thank you to the leadership of San Manuel!"
