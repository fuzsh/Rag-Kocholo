However, the area surrounding DN5 0PW, has a female population slightly higher than UK average, with 52.8% of residents being female. Several factors can contribute to this. Women generally live longer than men, resulting in a higher proportion of women in neighborhoods with significant elderly populations. Typically, as people grow older, they tend to relocate from city center addresses to suburban areas, smaller towns, and rural locations. Consequently, these areas often have a higher number of females. A higher female population can also be found in areas with industries that employ more women, such as healthcare, education, and retail.\n\nAcross the UK, the average relationship status breakdown is roughly 44% married, 38% single, 9% divorced, 6% widowed, and 2% separated.\n\nIn the immediate area around DN5 0PW, a significant portion of the population is single, making up 52.6% of the residents.
