        "text": "Mumbai: Earlier this week, there were reports that Preity Zinta is all set to tie the knot with her American boyfriend Gene Goodenough in January. It was believed that she will be flying to the US and it will be a small and intimate ceremony. However, putting rumours to rest, the actress rubbished the reports of her wedding on social media.\n\ntwitter_timeline1\n\ntwitter_timeline2\n\nApparently, Gene is based in Los Angeles and the 30-something works as a financial analyst. As per reports, Preity and Gene met on one of Zinta's trips to the US a few years back. The two have been going steady for some time and it was Gene who stood by Preity throughout her fight with former lover Ness Wadia.\n\nEarlier in an interview, the actress was quoted saying, “I have moved on, he has moved on. There’s someone else in my life. I will not reveal who it is. I don’t like to talk about my relationships…this time I prefer to keep my mouth shut. I am really happy right now.”\n\nLast year on June 12, Preity had filed a police complaint alleging that Ness outraged her modesty at the stadium on May 30 when an IPL match was on between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings, a charge dubbed as “false and baseless” by him. The co-owners have often set aside their differences and have come together as business partners."
