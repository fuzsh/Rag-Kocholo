        "text": "A hush-hush wedding never stays secret for long.\n\nHere are all the deets you may have missed from Preity Zinta's wedding to American beau Gene Goodenough!\n\n1. The LA wedding was plenty traditional, pheras included!\n\n\"It was a traditional Hindu ceremony with a pandit conducting all the rituals, including pheras, and took place in an outdoor mandap with the glittering LA skyline as the backdrop. Preity's mother oversaw the entire arrangement,\" a source from the venue revealed.\n\n2. Here's what the mandap looked like.\n\nThe event designer, an LA-based artist who goes by the name of DJ Amara , let slip a photo of the venue, and was too slow to delete it! Now, it's everywhere:\n\n3. Meanwhile, one of Preity's best buds leaked the shaadi secret!\n\nIt was the new bride's close friend and veteran actor, Kabir Bedi, who let the nuptial news slip on Twitter:\n\n4. What we know about Preity's groom: Her hubby is a corporate hotshot... and a key witness in Preity's case against her ex!\n\nThe actress's groom graduated from the Marshall School of Business and works as Senior Vice President of Finance in a US-based hydroelectric power company. The actress met him during one of her trips to visit her family in the US, reported Hindustan Times.\n\nGene was Preity's crutch during her tumultous break-up with her former flame Ness Wadia. He's also a key witness of the molesting incident that took place at the Wankhede stadium in May 2014.\n\n5. Preity's bridesmaids were all Bollywood stars!\n\nPreity's filmi gal pals flew to LA to celebrate her wedding with her, tabloids revealed.\n\nWhile celebrity jewellery designer Farah Khan Ali could only attend a pre-wedding bash, she sent her good wishes on wedding day:\n\nSussanne Khan stayed back for the shaadi with socialite-fashion designer friend, Surily Goel.\n\n6. She's having a second wedding in Mumbai!\n\nA source close to Preity revealed, \"A big fat Rajput-style reception is being planned in Mumbai for April where Preity will introduce her husband to the film industry. Salman, Sohail and Arbaaz Khan, along with Hrithik Roshan, Bobby Deol, Abhishek Bachchan and other celebrities are on the guest list.\"\n\n7. We'll see more wedding pics soon!"
