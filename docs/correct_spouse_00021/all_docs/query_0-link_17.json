        "text": "What just happened? All this while I thought Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia were “boyfriend-girlfriend” with a classic case of the his-mummy-doesn’t-like-me blues. But now in a missive to her Kings XI Punjab Indian Premiere League team Preity calls Ness a “work buddy – for now.” There’s so much wrong with this picture. Since when did Bollywood belles have to explain themselves to their cricket contingents (well I guess if I’m going to go there I may as well also ask since when did Bollywood belles have a cricket contingent?!)\n\nAlthough there has been widespread speculation about the on-again-off-again relationship Preity and Ness share the actress has now made it official. Preity sent an e-mail to her Kings XI Punjab team explaining that the Bombay Dyeing scion is her “business partner” and they share (at best) a cordial working relationship. Apparently the actress does not want the Kings XI Punjab to be distracted by anything, least of all anything to do with her and Ness. (I’m thinking if they weren’t distracted so far they sure as hell will be now!)\n\nThe other great rumor doing the rounds claims that while “Preity has been open and forthcoming, Ness has not told his parents (Nusli and Maureen Wadia) or his brother (Jeh Wadia) about the changed personal equation with the actress. (But hang on a second wouldn’t mummy be thrilled?)"
