        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDeveika Bhojwani clears the air about the Wadia scion’s role in her son Karan and Lisa Haydon’s breakup\n\nMumbai cops are seeking clarity from actress Preity Zinta on the abuse charges she has levelled against her ex-boyfriend and fellow Kings XI Punjab team coowner Ness Wadia, but there is another person dragged into the controversy.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget and Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates\n\nThere’s intense speculation that Zinta filed the police complaint, termed by Wadia as “baseless”, allegedly b e c aus e o f the new girl in his life — model-turnedactress Lisa Haydon. However, Haydon has found a surprising ally in Deveika Bhojwani, who revealed that Wadia did not break up the model’s engagement to her son Karan.\n\n“Someone started this rumour that Ness had something to do with Karan and Lisa’s breakup. It gained momentum because Ness is in the news,” Bhojwani told ETPanache, “But there is no truth to these rumours. Lisa isn’t seeing Ness.”\n\nLisa’s ex-fiance Karan is currently on a trip to Chennai, but clarified that the reports were “complete rubbish”. “Ness is one of my best friends. Lisa and I get along very well too. We are all on the best terms possible. The people involved know the truth and that is what matters.”\n\nZinta filed a complaint against Wadia on June 14, alleging that he had verbally abused, manhandled and threatened her inside Wankhede stadium on May 30, when their IPL team Kings XI Punjab was playing against the Chennai Super Kings. The next day, newspaper reports quoting sources close to Wadia claimed that Zinta was reacting out of jealousy because she could not take Wadia moving on with a “dusky model-turned-actress who recently broke off her engagement”.\n\nHaydon and Bhojwani, who were engaged in February 2013, broke up in January this year. The actress, who tasted success for her bohemian turn in this year’s hit Queen, attended the Gladrags Mrs India race event in March as Wadia’s guest, sparking speculation that she’s dating the industrialist. Deveika Bhojwani, however, added that Haydon resents being dragged into the Zinta-Wadia mess. “Lisa is very upset with such allegations, as are all of us”.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\nWhy India should be worried about what’s happening in Bangladesh\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nHow WazirX lost USD230 million in India’s biggest crypto exchange hack\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
