        "text": "Actor Preity Zinta often posts cute family photos.\n\nRecently, she took to Instagram to share a picture with her husband Gene Goodenough from her weekend.\n\nShe wrote in the caption, “Weekend. #ting.”\n\nAfter her post, many of her fans chimed in the comment section.\n\nA fan wrote, “So sweet.”\n\n“Love is beautiful. greatest couple of world,” another commented.\n\nPreity and Gene tied the knot in Los Angeles on February 29, 2016. The duo became parents to twins in 2021.\n\nAnnouncing the birth of her children via surrogacy, Preity in 2021 wrote, \"Hi everyone, I wanted to share our amazing news with all of you today. Gene and I are overjoyed and our hearts are filled with so much gratitude and with so much love as we welcome our twins Jai Zinta Goodenough and Gia Zinta Goodenough into our family.\"\n\nShe also opened up about children's safety and in a social media post wrote a lengthy note about the alleged harassment that her kid faced.\n\nPreity wrote, \"The incident was regarding my daughter Gia-where a woman tried to take her photo. When we politely asked her not to she walked away, then suddenly scooped my daughter in her arms & planted a big wet kiss next to her mouth & ran off saying what a cute baby. This woman lives in an elite building & happened to be in the garden where my kids were playing. If I wasn't a celebrity I probably would have reacted badly but kept my cool as I didn't want to make a scene.\""
