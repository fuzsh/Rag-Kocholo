        "text": "Mumbai: Ness Wadia, business tycoon and owner of IPL team Kings XI Punjab, has been sentenced to a two-year-prison term in Japan for possessing drugs.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, Ness Wadia was found in possession of 25 grams of cannabis resin in March.\n\nActress Preity Zinta’s ex-lover Ness Wadia, a business tycoon and heir of the Wadia Group and co-owner of Kings XI Punjab has no doubt found himself in severe trouble after the two-year jail term sentence.\n\nNess Wadia is the son and heir of Nusli Wadia's business empire, the Wadia Group.\n\nWadia was reportedly found in possession of the substance at the New Chitose Airport in the Japanese island of Hokkaido.\n\nMany media house tried to reach out to the Wadia Group for comments on Ness's arrest but were unsuccessful. The family has made no official statement yet.\n\nThe report also states that at the time of arrest, Ness Wadia admitted to possessing the cannabis, which he said was meant for personal consumption.\n\nJapan’s narcotics laws are stringent, and especially ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the judiciary in Japan seems to be in no mood to take such offences lightly."
