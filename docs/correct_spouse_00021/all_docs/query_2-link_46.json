        "text": "Two weddings of Bollywood personalities happened recently, one expected and the other a bit of a surprise. That Preity Zinta would be marrying her American boyfriend Gene Goodenough had been on the cards for sometime. Speculation had been rife as to when the wedding would be with multiple rumours giving different dates.\n\nUltimately, she went ahead and got married secretly in Los Angeles with family and close friends present. Her husband is a finance executive. Interestingly he is said to be a witness in the police complaint that Preity filed against former boyfriend Ness Wadia, who was also co-owner of a cricket team with her.\n\nIt was during a match that Ness and Preity had had an ugly war of words sparked off by Ness not finding seats for his group at the owner’s box. Preity’s decision to finally tie the knot is attributed to her mother who had been keen to see her settling down.\n\nBut while Preity’s marriage didn’t catch anyone unawares, the other Bollywood wedding did come as a bit of a bolt out of the blue. And that was because it had been a long time since Urmila Matondkar had been in anyone’s consciousness when it came to Bollywood.\n\nThere had been a time two decades ago when under the aegis of Ram Gopal Varma she had suddenly burst on the scene as one of the hottest and ablest actresses in the industry, with movies like Rangeela and Satya. But then her career had waned off and by about the mid-2000s it was well into terminal decline.\n\nNews has just come in that she too has tied the knot. Her husband is a businessman and her wedding too had been a private affair. It was reported that the only personality from Bollywood to attend was the fashion designer Manish Malhotra. These weddings indicate that the generation of popular actresses who ruled the roost in 1990s have now well and truly moved on in life. On the other hand, many male actors of that time are still very much in the game.\n\nSplit rumours\n\nFor some time now it was being been said that the Arbaaz Khan and Malaika Arora marriage is going through some troubling times.\n\nThere have been numerous reports of their estrangement. One said that she had moved out from their house with their son and was living in her parents’ home.\n\nAnother said that they weren’t speaking to each other at the set of a television reality show they were hosting together.\n\nDifferent reasons are also given for this alleged split. One attributed it to Arjun Kapoor getting increasingly close to Malaika and another said that she was in a relationship with a UK-based businessman.\n\nWith such a surfeit of rumours, chances are there could be some kernel of truth to the separation. On the other hand, she was spotted at a family dinner of the Khans, once again puzzling people.\n\nBoth Arbaaz and Malaika have refused to comment on their personal lives. Malaika put up a photo-comment on her Instagram account lambasting those who were speculating about them. The image said, ‘Hey, I found your nose. It was in my business again.’\n\nMeanwhile, it is also said that Salman Khan, Arbaaz’s brother, is trying to patch the two up. As a veteran of many failed relationships, it is debatable how much he will be of use here.\n\nA possible tie-up\n\nOne of the things that success does is it makes you many friends. Even those who should be enemies look at you in a different light. Just a few years ago, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, under the shadow of multiple failures, had found himself being ridiculed for his extravagant productions.\n\nBut a few superhits later, he is now the talk of the town, feted and in demand by all actors. Bhansali had made Devdas with Shah Rukh Khan in 2002 and the movie had done well.\n\nHe and Shah Rukh had a good equation but then last December the latter’s Dilwale and Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani released on the same day. Against all expectations Bajirao easily beat Dilwale by a mile in both critical and commercial acclaim.\n\nWhile everyone thought that Shah Rukh would not take such a drubbing well, there was a surprise in store when he came across Bhansali at an awards function.\n\nInstead of ignoring Bhansali, Shah Rukh went up to him. He paid his respects to Bhansali’s mother seated nearby. The actor and director talked at length and, if reports are to be believed, even carried on with their conversation at home after the event got over.\n\nIt is rumoured that Shah Rukh mooted the idea of doing a movie together. If it works out, it will most probably be one of those grand opuses that Bhansali is famous for and Shah Rukh being part of the cast will make it an even bigger spectacle.\n\nPresent for self\n\nIt must be great being Alia Bhatt. She is about to celebrate her 23rd birthday, an age when most people are only starting off on their career while Alia seems to have already touched a few crests.\n\nAnd to celebrate the birthday in style, she is making a gift to herself — an apartment. The house is close to her parents in the expensive suburb of Bandra, which means, considering real estate prices there, she must have paid a fortune.\n\nBut Alia, despite her young age, charges a fee appropriate to her standing as an actress who almost invariably delivers a hit with a rare exception like the recent Shaandaar.\n\nShe is right now at a peak and given her talent and foundations in the industry will probably continue being a successful actress for quite a few years. As with all famous stars, she does get dragged into controversies.\n\nThere were rumours recently that she was a trigger for the Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif split. When asked about it at a media interaction, she replied that it was so ridiculous that she had decided not to issue any clarification.\n\nSend your feedback to\n\n[email protected]"
