        "text": "Bollywood actor filed an official police complaint against ex-boyfriend and Jinnah's grandson four years ago\n\nEntertainment Desk February 21, 2018\n\nBollywood actor Preity Zinta filed an official police complaint on May 30, 2014, against her ex-boyfriend, industrialist Ness Wadia for molestation and intimidation. After four years, a charge sheet has now been filed in the court and lawyers are now looking into the matter, reported The Indian Express.\n\nThe Veer Zara actor and Wadia are co-owners of Kings XI Punjab, an Indian Premier League Team. The episode Zinta has cited in her complaint allegedly happened at Wankhede Stadium during an IPL match in Mumbai. In the official statement, she claimed Wadia was abusing the team staff over the ticket distribution because he was unhappy with the sitting arrangement. He grew aggressive when Preity asked him to calm down, abused her verbally and grabbed her harshly by the arm which gave her bruises. According to reports, the bruises Wadia apparently left on her were documented in pictures by a friend of Zinta’s and submitted to the police.\n\nPreity Zinta's vacay snap with hubby will make you miss your significant other\n\nIn 2014, Zinta’s now husband Gene Goodenough also sent his statement to the police via email. “In his statement, Goodenough supported the claims made by his wife, stating that he had intervened when Wadia molested and abused Zinta. He asked Wadia not to misbehave with a woman,” said a senior official.\n\nSouth African cricketer David Miller’s father Andrew – who was present at Wankhede stadium a the time – also came forth. “Miller, on the other hand, said he saw the estranged couple arguing but did not see Wadia misbehave with her as he was seated far away,” added the same official.\n\nI stared at her open mouthed: Preity Zinta on meeting Jinnah's daughter Dina Wadia\n\nIn May 2016, Wadia recorded his defence wherein he denied all allegations. “In his statement, Wadia had claimed that as co-owners of Kings XI Punjab, both he and Zinta were entitled to 15 seats. On May 30, their team was playing against Chennai Super Kings and since it was his birthday, he had decided to celebrate it with his family and friends and had even bought 35 extra tickets,” added the source. “Also, for the first time since he bought a stake in the IPL team, his mother had agreed to join him to watch the match. However, the front row seats were occupied by Zinta and her friends.”\n\nThe official further added, “Wadia claimed that he first requested Kings XI Chief Operating Officer (COO) Fraser Castellino and then Zinta to vacate the seats. However, the actress refused, which led to bickering between the two. He denied the allegation of molestation and intimidation pressed by the actress.”"
