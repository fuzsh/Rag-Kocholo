Yes the\n\nCall it a mere coincidence or a wise choice. After Harbhajan Singh tied the knot with Geeta Basra and Yuvraj Singh married Hazel Keech, Bollywood babe Preity Zinta has decided to settle down. Yes the 40 year old will tie the knot with her American boyfriend Gene Goodenough. Now who is this guy, you must be wondering. Let us enlighten you that when Preity was going through some legal hassles with her boyfriend Ness Wadia it was this financial analyst Jane Goodenough who stood rock solid by her.

One also hears that no official confirmation has come from Preity, there are speculations of the dimpled beauty flying off to US in January 2016 to tie the knot. A little birdie also tells us that it will be an intimate wedding ceremony with only family and close friends participating."
