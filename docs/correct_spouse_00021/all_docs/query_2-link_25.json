        "text": "Everything was going smoothly, despite Ness’ mother, Maureen Wadia’s now-famous quip, “I don’t care even if Ness gets married to a zebra”.\n\nIn 2008, the couple took their relationship to the next level and bought the Kings XI Punjab team of Indian Premier League (IPL) together. A year later, they broke up, reportedly after Ness slapped Preity in a party.\n\nThe pair decided to continue their business relationship however, and remained co-owners of Kings XI Punjab and sort of “friends”. Preity said in an interview:\n\n“We [Ness and I] had a great relationship. I have a lot of respect for Ness and I always will. But I think sometimes you want to take a different path in life, and if you have the maturity to see that, then life is great for both the people involved. When you date someone for that long, how can you not be friends? But we are not best friends. We don’t talk to each other every day because that’s weird! I’m sure if something ever went wrong he would stand by me and vice versa, but there’s nothing more than that.”\n\nPreity Zinta\n\nMolestation Charges\n\nThe good cheer didn’t last long however. Preity Zinta filed a complaint against Ness Wadia accusing him of molestation, threats and abuse on June 13, 2014. In her complaint, Preity said that the two were only currently in a business relationship and had not been on speaking terms for some time following a couple of heated arguments regarding work.\n\n“During that time he tried to abuse me and used extremely derogatory language and tried to behave in a manner where I was put to shame in front of my colleagues, friends and family... I say that Ness Wadia has gone to the extent of threatening me with dire consequences and intimidating me by boasting of his political clout and connections.”\n\nPreity Zinta in her complaint\n\nThe actor alleged that on 30 May, 2014, during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Wankhede Stadium, Ness was allegedly abusing the team staff over ticket distribution when she asked him to calm down as their team was winning. He, however, allegedly abused and molested her by grabbing her arm.\n\n“Mr Ness Wadia had intimidated me by saying that he could make me disappear as I was a nobody and only an actress and he’s a powerful person. I say that I have been tried to be very normal and nice to him as I wanted peace in my life, but the recent afore-stated incident in Mumbai at the Wankhede stadium has left me shattered and fear for my life.”\n\nPreity Zinta in her complaint\n\nThe actor also submitted four photographs to the police, showing “bruise-like” marks on her right arm, and took to Facebook to comment on the incident.\n\nPreity Zinta also wrote to the then Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, saying that Ness had been aggressive with her on earlier occasions as well.\n\n“Ness’s behaviour towards me is getting more and more aggressive and violent over a period of time. From throwing burning cigarettes at my face to locking me up in rooms and manhandling me, I have seen it all with him... I just want him to be kept away from me so I can live in peace, otherwise one unfortunate day, in a fit of rage, he will kill me and that really scares me.”\n\nPreity Zinta in her letter to Rakesh Maria\n\nNess denied all charges in a statement, claiming they were “totally false and baseless”."
