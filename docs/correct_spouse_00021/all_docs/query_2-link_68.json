        "text": "In 1997, a bubbly-faced girl accompanied a friend to an audition in Mumbai, where director Shekhar Kapur spotted her. The director asked her to go on an audition. He was so impressed by her audition that he insisted she become an actress.\n\nAlthough her debut film with Kapur didnât materialize, she made her acting debut in 1998 with the film âDil Se. . .â followed by âSoldierâ in the same year.\n\nYes, she is the âPretty Womanâ of India: our very own Preity Zinta.\n\nRecently, she made a stunning presence at the May 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

Itâs certainly an exciting time for her fans who are eagerly awaiting her return.\n\nOff-screen Ventures:\n\nThe bubbly talented actress is also a successful entrepreneur. She co-owns the Indian Premier League cricket team Punjab Kings. Her journey as a team owner began in 2008 when she bought the team along with her ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia.\n\nAs a team owner, Preity has been involved in the teamâs operations. Her passion for the game and her team is evident in her enthusiastic presence at the matches cheering for her team.\n\nFormer Punjab Kings player Irfan Pathan has praised Preity for her dedication and emotional investment in the team.
