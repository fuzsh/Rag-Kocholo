        "text": "Preity Zinta got married to her beau Gene Goodenough in a private ceremony in Los Angeles in 2016. The two then had a big fat Bollywood reception in Mumbai. The guest list included PZ’s colleagues, friends and family. They had met in Santa Monica and soon sparks flew between them. After dating each other for 5 long years, they had decided to take the plunge and tie the knot. A while ago, the couple completed 2 years of marital bliss. Preity took to Instagram to share a cute couple photo and wish her hubby dearest. Here’s what she post:\n\nCongratulations to Gene and Preity!"
