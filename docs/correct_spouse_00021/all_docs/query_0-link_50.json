        "text": "Preity has pressed molestation charges against her ex boyfriend\n\nNess Wadia has always been a ladies’ man. His flamboyant image, suave and sophisticated attitude has always worked on the B-town ladies. Besides Preity Zinta, Ness has been linked with quite a few names from the glamour world. While Preity has accused Wadia of molesting her, these other ladies have hardly acknowledged their equation with Ness. Here we take a look at Ness Wadia's other Bollywood connections.\n\nNargis Fakhri: They first met at Karan Johar's birthday party. Nargis was accompanied by the Rockstar actor Ranbir Kapoor at the birthday bash. Though Preity was also present at the do, Ness reportedly spent more time with Ms Fakhri than his business partner. Nargis and Ness's chemistry could not be missed at KJo’s party. Hugs, flying kisses and long conversations were all in place. The duo who were secluded in one corner of the party, apparently spoke for more than a hour and a half before mingling with other guests. Though Nargis denied of anything else except a cordial relationship, Ness maintained his silence on his link-up.\n\nLara Dutta: As per reports in a leading daily, Lara Dutta and Ness Wadia were very close at one point of time. This was when Lara was still trying to establish her foothold in the industry. Buzz suggests that Ness had fallen for Lara; however nothing much came out this relationship. Apparently the duo hasn't interacted since then.\n\nAmeesha Patel: Rumour mills suggest that as a teenager Ness Wadia was head over heels in love with actor Ameesha Patel. The alleged couple met casually a few times, before falling in love. Reportedly they dated for quite long before separating. They apparently shared a lot of love letters and gifts.\n\nManisha Koirala: Though nothing much has been written about this relationship, sources confirm that Manisha and Ness were close at one point of time. Though this hush-hush relationship didn't last long, Ness and Manisha remained cordial post that.\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
