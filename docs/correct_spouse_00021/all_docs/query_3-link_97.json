She has time and again expressed love for her husband and is often spotted with him at award shows and IPL matches.\n\n“Gene and I are overjoyed and our hearts filled with so much gratitude and with so much love as we welcome our twins Jai Zinta Goodenough and Gia Zinta Goodenough into our family.”\n\nThe actor also thanked those involved with the pregnancy. “A heartfelt thank you to the doctors, nurses and to our surrogate for being part of this incredible journey. Loads of love and light – Gene, Preity, Jai & Gia"
