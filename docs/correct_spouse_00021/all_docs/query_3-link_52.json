        "text": "On their sixth wedding anniversary, Preity Zinta posted a candid photo with hubby Gene Goodenough. Preity is dressed as a bride in red, putting a dupatta around Gene as if taking his away in this photograph from their wedding in the United States. In a golden sherwani, Gene Goodenough poses as a delighted groom. Several of Preity's colleagues, acquaintances, and admirers wished her well on this special day.\n\nPreity captioned the photo with a letter to Gene, describing him as her \"best friend and confidant.\" She wrote, \"Happy Anniversary my love. I love you. Thank you so much for loving all of me and for making me laugh all the time. You are my best friend and confidant and I love you more every day. From boyfriend-girlfriend to husband-wife and now mom-dad, I’m loving every new phase of my life with you. Here’s to many more anniversaries and celebrations #Mr&mrsgoodenough #happyanniversary #patiparmeshwar #leapyearanniversary #ting.\"\n\nBobby Deol, Preity's Soldier co-star, wished the actor, “Happy anniversary.” Sonakshi Sinha also commented, “Happy anniversary you guys.” Preity and Gene celebrated their first wedding anniversary following the birth of their twins, son Jai and daughter Gia last November.\n\nThe actor had announced the good news in an Instagram post, \"Hi everyone, I wanted to share our amazing news with all of you today. Gene and I are overjoyed and our hearts are filled with so much gratitude and with so much love as we welcome our twins Jai Zinta Goodenough and Gia Zinta Goodenough into our family. We are very excited about this new phase in our lives.\""
