        "text": "The year was 2005. If she was ruling Bollywood, he was taking the world of business by storm. Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia seemed like a match made in heaven. And when they bought an Indian Premier League (IPL) team, Kings XI Punjab, together, the nation started placing bets on when the good-looking couple would get married.\n\nIt did not matter that Ness's mother, Maureen Wadia, shared frosty vibes with Preity. Maureen had famously remarked that she didn't care if her son was dating \"a Zinta or a zebra\", as long as he was happy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd happy, they were. But Preity and Ness's happiness was short-lived. In 2009, the couple parted ways, after going strong for more than four years. Speculation is rife that a few months before their break-up, Ness lost his cool and slapped Preity at a party. However, neither ever spoke about why they called it quits.\n\nPreity said in an interview shortly after that despite their break-up, they continue to be friends and business partners. So when Preity filed a complaint against Ness Wadia on June 13, 2014, accusing him of molestation, threats and abuse, it sent shockwaves across the nation.\n\nAlmost four years after the complaint, the Mumbai Police have finally filed a chargesheet against Ness Wadia under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nWHAT IS THE MOLESTATION CASE ALL ABOUT?\n\nThings allegedly took an ugly turn at the Wankhede Stadium on May 30, 2014, during a Kings XI Punjab vs Chennai Super Kings match. Ness was allegedly abusing the team staff over ticket distribution when Preity was seated in the Garware Pavilion. When she asked him to calm down, he abused and manhandled her by grabbing her arm, she claimed. To support this claim, she submitted four photographs to the police, showing 'bruise-like' marks on her right arm.\n\nPreity then changed her seat, but her ordeal did not end. She was allegedly verbally abused again by Ness here, as well. He also abused her on the ground in front of their team members.\n\nIn her complaint, Preity said that they had been having work-related disagreements for a while, and \"during that time he tried to abuse me and used extremely derogatory language and tried to behave in a manner where I was put to shame in front of my colleagues, friends and family.\" She had verbally warned him, but he refused to mend his ways.\n\nOn the evening of May 30, 2014, Preity alleged, \"Mr Ness Wadia had intimidated me by saying that he could make me disappear as I was a nobody and only an actress and he's a powerful person... I have tried to be very normal and nice to him as I wanted peace in my life, but the recent afore-stated incident in Mumbai at the Wankhede stadium has left me shattered and fear for my life.\"\n\nNess, in a statement, expressed shock at the complaint and denied the allegations, calling them \"totally false and baseless.\"\n\nClarifying why she chose to file a complaint against her former boyfriend, Preity wrote on Facebook, \"After several warnings over the years I WAS LEFT WITH NO OTHER OPTION..... The whole point of this is that violent physical or aggressive behaviour should not be tolerated by rich or poor, man or woman, celebrity or not! (sic)\"\n\nIn a letter to the then Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, Preity wrote that Ness had been displaying aggressive behaviour towards her even before the May 30 incident. \"Ness's behaviour towards me is getting more and more aggressive and violent over a period of time. From throwing burning cigarettes at my face to locking me up in rooms and manhandling me, I have seen it all with him,\" she alleged.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShe went on to say, \"I just want him to be kept away from me so I can live in peace, otherwise one unfortunate day, in a fit of rage, he will kill me and that really scares me.\"\n\nHowever, it was reported last year that Preity and Ness had put their ugly past behind them. They reportedly crossed paths at a Kings XI Punjab vs Royal Challengers Bangalore match last year and greeted each other cordially.\n\nEven as they have called a truce, a trial is expected to begin soon, with witnesses from both sides in attendance.\n\nALSO READ: Ness Wadia will kill me, claims Preity Zinta as she reveals he threw burning cigarettes on her\n\nALSO READ: Police file chargesheet in Preity Zinta-Ness Wadia molestation case, 4 years after FIR"
