        "text": "As Preity and Ness head forsplitzville, here are our reasons why it just had to happen...\n\nHave they, haven\"t they? Well, you can stop playing the guessing game. Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia have broken their 5- year long relationship. The recently concluded season of IPL saw Ness getting drunk and beaten up in single-men squabbles and Preity sitting in the dug put instead of VIP enclosures as asign of things returning to where they started. As Ness goes back to his rich industrialist partying ways, PZ might have to slug it out and play the field yet again. We got talking to a few relationship gurus to figure 10 reasons why it had to happen?\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Preity is from Bollywood that\"s associated with consumerism and entertainment at the lowest common denominator. Ness belonged the world of royalty, snobbery and old money. While a marriage between the two worlds worked in the 80s with Tina and Anil Ambani, time today somehow favours equal matches from similar worlds.\n\n2. She was always the star, he always her little puppy. Preity really showed him around, as he looked on like a wide-eyed baby who can\"t believe his luck with his new filmy friends and shutterbug flashy way of life. Maybe it was time for her to get an equal.\n\n3. The mother hated her. Maureen Wadia never made an attempt at hiding her dislike for Preity. From almost calling her a zebra to never publically acknowledging her, she did make life tough for the love birds. Ness, clearly being a mamma\"s boy, failed to stand for his fire- brand girlfriend.\n\nInterestingly, mum Maureen Wadia, who is all praise for daughter-in-law Celina ( married to Jeh, her elder son), often resorted to a \" no comments\" stand on Preity., which was bound to hurt any self- respecting girl like Preity. His non- commital stand didn\"t help matters.\n\n4. Preity tried so hard to please.\n\nFrom T-shirt-jeans, without a care in the world sort of girl, she metamorphosed into a hat and glove wearing Derby watching dame. Such a drastic change of personality usually doesn\"t last, as your real self itches to come out and one day you get tired of being who the guy wants you to be.\n\n5. While Preity grew alot in the past five years, from being an actress to an ambassador for causes to a business partner at the IPL; Ness really remained where he was \" a rich kid and her boyfriend.\n\nThis might have bored PZ, who got tired of a boyfriend who just wannts to party and make couple appearances but still not want to move forward.\n\n6. She really was stronger of the two and not in a passive aggressive way like Abhi- Ash, but in an obvious in-your face sort of way. This might have got too much for his ego to handle as he finally realised that if he needs to shine on his own, he\"d have to stop being \" Preity Zinta\"s boyfriend\".\n\n7. While they both clearly aspired to be part of each other\"s worlds, they knew they\"d always be outsiders. She with all her charm could not break into the born with- a- silver- spoon category, where people enjoy having nothing to do as, it was all done for them generations ago and have little regard for those who earn their own living. He, with, all his VIP connection could not become a part of the showbiz where he\"d always be second- tier citizen and she\"d hog all the photo- ops.\n\n8. Speculation. Speculation. Their relationship was too long and too open for everyone to comment, dissect and pass judgments.\n\nIt\"s a known fact that no relationship can stand that kind of scrutiny for long and one side is bound to come under pressure sooner than later.\n\n9. Her tomboy ways could have scandalised him as much as his society-polished ways bored her. Her brave demeanor in taking up causes, speaking her mind and \"huggling\" her team mates after winning could have unsettled the Wadia heir, who might have realised that all he really wants is a girl who can look pretty and behave coy.\n\nadvertisement\n\n10. A business partnership doesn\"t always work. While Ness could\"ve believed that he should run the Kings XI team his way, after all, he along with Mohit Burman have the necessary expertise; Preity was actively involved, cutting down her movie assignments, being present at press conferences and matches.\n\nWhile he might have liked her to just look glamorous at the stands, she would not have liked his indifferent ways, especially when compared to Yuvraj\"s passion for the game."
