        "text": "They were once one of Bollywood’s most celebrated power couples - he, a renowned business tycoon and she, a famous Bollywood star – with their combined star power ensuring they were papped everywhere they went; with Ness playing the quintessential prince charming and Preity Zinta, his smitten lover.\n\nBut when the pair split two years ago, the two went into instant silent mode, refusing to reveal what actually went wrong despite plenty of theories which started circulating Bollywood about how Ness’ roving eye and Preity’s decision to work post-marriage were to blame. But savvy insiders soon fingered a shared money deal, an IPL cricket team investment that ruined their romance.\n\nNow, two years later, we hear it’s the very same business deal that’s been the catalyst in rekindling their romance, as the two were spotted celebrating their team recent Kings XI Punjab’s win at a Mumbai nightclub, with a few party gals spilling that the couple were seen cosying up throughout the night.\n\nHmmm, could this be second time lucky in love for this pair? Fingers crossed that this time Cupid doesn’t give up on these lovebirds!"
