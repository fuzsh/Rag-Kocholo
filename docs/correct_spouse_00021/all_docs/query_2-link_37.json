        "text": "There have been many celebrities in Bollywood who had got married either in a hush hush manner or rather secretly. If the recent reports are to be believed, then, the latest one to join the ‘secret marriage’ club is none other than Bollywood actress Taapsee Pannu. The last couple days, there have been news buzz all over about the Thappad actress getting married to her boyfriend of many years Mathias Boe.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the different celebrities who had got married secretly.\n\nPreity Zinta and Gene Goodenough\n\nAfter having undergone a not so memorable relationship with Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta ultimately decided to end the relationship for good. It was around this time, she met gene Goodenough, who was rumoured to be one of Ness’ close friends, but, was standing by Preity through the entire time. There were many media reports about Preity Zinta being in a ‘happy space with a happy guy from LA’, although there was no mention about the name and other details of the guy.\n\nOn the day and date of February 29, 2016, Preity Zinta walked down the altar with Gene Goodenough in an extremely private ceremony which was held in LA. The ceremony was attended by a few family members of the actress and extremely close friends like Sussanne Khan and Surily Goel. After about two years of their marriage, Preity Zinta decided to add the ‘G’ of her husband’s initials to her name and thus, she became Preity G Zinta.\n\nSidharth and Aditi Rao Hydari\n\nThis is one wedding which was being awaited and speculated by many for quite sometime now. Even though they have always been in the news because of their relationship, neither of them ever officially confirmed their relationship status. But, one thing was for sure, sooner or later, wedding bells for this ‘much-in-love’ couple was very much in the making.\n\nThe lovely couple Aditi Rao Hydari and Siddharth got secretly married on March 26, with the venue chosen to be Sri Ranganayakaswamy Temple Mandapam in Telangana’s Srirangpur. Amidst all the rumours about the secret wedding, the host of Hiramandi’s event Sachin Kumbhar confirmed that the two are getting married while he was reasoning Aditi’s absence from the event.\n\nAs per the reports available, the couple is now going to be making an official announcement about the wedding very soon.\n\nGovinda and Sunita\n\nBy their own admission, in an interview with Bollywood Bubble, the awesome couple of Govinda and Sunita revealed that theirs was a secret marriage. And, when asked for the reason to keep their marriage a secret, Sunita revealed that they had got married in the year 1987, when Govinda was at the peak of his career.\n\nShe added that, during those days, when the hero got married in real life, his fan following would see a drastic drop. She added that, in order to avoid that, she advised him to sign as many films as possible in the coming one year. She also revealed that, they declared their marriage on the occasion of their daughter Tina’s first birthday.\n\nAmrita Rao and RJ Anmol\n\nAfter having made her Bollywood debut, Amrita Rao went onto become one of the busiest and most sought after stars. Just like her ever-so-young looks, even her marriage with RJ Anmol was kept as a secret. Amrita Rao and RJ Anmol spoke about their ‘secret marriage’ on their new YouTube show Couple of Things. Very aptly, Amrita termed her marriage as ‘secret vivaah’.\n\nThe couple shared that, even though Anmol was insisting on getting married, Amrita was the one who kept on putting it off. She revealed that, at that time, when Anmol had asked her for marriage, she feared her career getting hampered because of the marriage.\n\nThat’s when Anmol had suggested to her that, if they could keep their affair a secret for 4-5 years, why can’t they do a secret vivah! In the said video, they went onto declare that, after all that, they got secretly married on May 15, 2014 but announced only in 2016. The two even had a Konkani wedding! Some ‘Vivaah’ story that!\n\nUrmila Matondkar and Mir Mohsin Akhtar\n\nOften referred to as the ‘Chamatkar’ girl and the ‘Rangeela’ girl, the stunning Urmila Matondkar was on top of her game during the nineties. Even though she had undergone the ‘traditional rumoured’ link ups with many of her co-stars, she ultimately decided to get married to the Kashmiri businessman Mir Mohsin Akhtar. But, the duo had kept their marriage a secret one for many days.\n\nLooking back, Urmila and Mohsin had reportedly met each other at Manish Malhotra’s niece, Riddhi Malhotra’s wedding in the year 2014. This was reportedly followed by the romantic pursuing by Mir, who, ultimately managed to get a yes from Urmila to be his life partner. The duo, then, got married in a private ceremony on March 3, 2016, at Urmila’s house!\n\nIn a statement regarding her wedding, Urmila had said, “We kept it an exclusive wedding with just family and friends at the celebration. Since our families wanted the wedding to be a low-key affair. We mutually decided to keep it private. We seek your blessings on embarking this new journey of our lives.”\n\nAditya Chopra and Rani Mukerji\n\nAlways termed as the ‘shy guy of Bollywood’ Aditya Chopra and the queen of hearts Rani Mukerji shocked and stunned everyone with the news of their marriage. The inimitable Karan Johar shared the details of their secret wedding on his show Koffee With Karan’s season 8, that featured none other than Rani Mukerji and Kajol as guests!\n\nRevealing about the secret wedding of Rani and Aditya, Karan Johar said that Aditya Chopra had trusted him with a top secret about his marriage. He said that, Aditya had come to him and said that, he was getting married and that there were 18 people attending the marriage. He also added that, Aditya had clearly warned him that, if the word got out of the wedding, it would be because of him (Karan) only and that he did not want even a single mention of his wedding in any publication! The two Rani Mukerji and Aditya Chopra got married on April 21, 2014 in a typical Bengali style… all the way in Italy!"
