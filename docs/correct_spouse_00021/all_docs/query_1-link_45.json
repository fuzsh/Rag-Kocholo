Though the actress herself has denied the news, sources close enough to the actress have confirmed that she’s about to fly to USA in January. There, she’ll be getting married to her American boyfriend, Gene Goodenough at a small and intimate ceremony. The two have been going steady for a while now and it was Gene who stood by Preity throughout her problems with her ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia."
