        "text": "New Delhi: Actress Suchitra Pillai, recognized for her role as Saif Ali Khan's girlfriend in 'Dil Chahta Hai' and presently appearing in 'The Broken News 2' alongside Jaideep Ahlawat and Sonali Bendre, recently tackled misconceptions surrounding her personal life. She opened up about being unjustly labeled a 'boyfriend snatcher' in the media following Preity Zinta's breakup with her current husband, Lars Kjeldsen.\n\nSuchitra Pillai on being called a 'boyfriend snatcher'\n\nDuring an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Suchitra opened up about her husband's relationship with actress Preity Zinta, who was his ex girlfriend. The actress also shared that she was not the cause of their separation.\n\nDenying the tag of being called a \"boyfriend snatcher\", Suchita said, \"No, that’s another story from somebody else. Preity and I were never friends, we were acquaintances because we had a common friend. But, yes, Lars Kjeldsen did date Preity Zinta for some time but that was the breakup he had before he met me and only this part is true. I didn’t come between them, they split up for a totally different reason.”\n\nReflecting on the incident that led to the misleading label, Suchitra Pillai remembered the controversy that ensued when she returned from England and began dating Andrew Coyne, who had ties to Star Television in India. She was wrongly implicated in Andrew's breakup with model Achla Sachdev. However, it was not her influence, and Achla and Suchitra now share a laugh about the misunderstanding.\n\nSuchitra Pillai and Lars Kjeldsen\n\nThe 'Dil Chahta Hai' fame actress Suchitra Pillai, who has worked in a number of films, television serials and OTT series, tied-the-knot with boyfriend Lars Kjeldsen in 2005. The couple has a daughter named Annika Kjeldsen.\n\nMeanwhile, Preity Zinta married Gene Goodenough in 2016. The couple welcomed their kids through surrogacy in 2021. Preity Zinta is currently all set for her comeback with Rajkumar Santoshi's directorial venture 'Lahore 1947' that stars her opposite Sunny Deol."
