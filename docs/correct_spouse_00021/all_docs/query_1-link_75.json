        "text": "Mumbai: Preity Zinta has always maintained that she will never hide her marriage. However, the sudden news about her wedding with her LA boyfriend has shocked all the close people around her.\n\nLast month, when we got in touch with her about her wedding plans she had said, “People seem to know more about my marriage than me. They are even setting dates for my wedding. They might as well tell me when and where to be there (at the wedding).”\n\nRead: Preity Zinta ties the knot with Gene Goodenough in Los Angeles\n\nDoes she not have any marriage plans? She said, “Of course I plan to get married, yaar!” she shot back. “And probably this year itself. If not for myself then for the sake of my mother.”\n\nPreity’s mother, like all mothers, was becoming increasingly concerned about her daughter’s marriage.\n\n“Mom keeps asking, when, when, when…So it will happen soon. I’ve never hidden my relationships. And yes, I am seeing someone, you know it.”\n\nPreity had been cautious, almost superstitious about her latest relationship, after the public tamasha that her earlier relationship with Ness Wadia had been turned into.\n\nHurt and mortified, Preity had decided to keep her new relationship away from the public eye.\n\nWhen reports of her relationship with Gene Goodenough broke, we had asked her if there was someone else in her life after Ness Wadia.\n\nAnd Preity had said, “That was over in 2009. You think I’d remain single after all these years? Whatever is happening with me is good. People say I am looking happy. That’s because I am.”."
