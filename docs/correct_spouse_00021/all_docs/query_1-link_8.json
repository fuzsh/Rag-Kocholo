        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\n1/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nAccording to a report on Pinkvilla.com, Ness Wadia's mother, Maureen Wadia has finally broken her silence on Preity Zinta's FIR against her son. She spoke up on the issue during the Gladrags Mrs India 2015 auditions. Maureen reasoned that it was totally uncalled for, on Preity's part, to do something like that and that the incident had left some bitterness between the two parties. However, she refrained from commenting about it further.\n\nHere's what Preity had to say about her break-up with the Wadia scion...\n\n2/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nAccording to reports, Preity Zinta is upset that while she would want to focus on cricket and her team's performance, all that gets written about is her link-ups and film career. Eyebrows were raised when she sat next to Wadia at the IPL players' auction last month. Ask her about it and she glares back. \"Why don't you ask him why he came and sat next to me? What did you want me to do, cut the table into two halves? Kings XI Punjab is my team and I've given everything, my hard-earned money. I gave up on my film career to be part of this,\" she says. In an exclusive chat with TOI, the actress has been quoted as saying that, \"What happened between me and Ness was unfortunate. But the franchise is my baby and there's no question of me cutting of my involvement with it,\" she says.\n\n3/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nBollywood's dimpled actress, Preity Zinta is known for speaking her mind. Be it the Ness Wadia case, or speaking against the underworld, Preity has never refrained from telling the truth. The rumour mills are abuzz with reports of her relationship with cricketer Yuvraj Singh but the pretty actress has refuted the claims vehemently. Preity Zinta recently took to Twitter to clear the air on the link-up rumour. Preity wrote, \"Dear Media (Specially International Business times) HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE 2 SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER DATED OR INTENDED TO DATE YUVRAJ SINGH?\" She further went on to add, \"Comments like these are sexist & reek of cheapness at my place of work. Pls refrain from writing that YUVRAJ & PREITY were in a relationship.\" [sic]\n\nWhile Preity has quashed rumours of her link up with Yuvraj, let's take a look at the time when she wrote an open letter talking about her relationship with Ness Wadia.\n\n4/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nPreity Zinta and ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia are once again making headlines. According to a Mumbai Mirror report, an attempt at striking a compromise between the industrialist Ness Wadia and Bollywood star and business partner Preity Zinta has failed. The report says that it is because of her insistence on Ness tendering an unconditional apology.\n\nOut of the five conditions Preity has placed in front of Ness, he has refused to honour one of them which is unconditional apology. While the report mentions that Ness was amenable to the other four stipulations. Preity had filed a complaint against Ness on June 12. The news report dated September 5, 2014 further elaborates that the Wadia family favoured a compromise but their scion Ness didn't want to offer unconditional apology.\n\n5/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nThe Ness Wadia molestation controversy has been hogging media limelight for quite some time now. Ever since the actress lodged an FIR against her former boyfriend Ness Wadia, new facts have been making their way into the media. After reading various reports about her migration to US and selling her stake in the IPL, Preity decided to tweet on the entire issue and clear her stand.\n\nPreity tweeted, \"A big Thank U 2 all the people 4the support. Amazed at how much speculation in the media. No I'm not selling my stake or settling in the US.\"\n\n\"SO called sources says anything & its getting reported. Pls No hearsay. There are many IMP Issues in India which are much more news worthy.\"\n\n6/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nBollywood actress Preity Zinta, who shocked everyone by filing a molestation case against her former businessman boyfriend Ness Wadia now speaks her heart out on the issue. The actress, who made her debut in Bollywood with Dil Se lodged a written complaint against Wadia with the Marine Drive police station on Thursday night. After the entire hullabaloo, Preity chose social media to explain her stand on the issue.\n\nFrom my heart- (Facebook and Twitter)\n\nI may not be super wealthy and powerful but I have truth by my side and Iâ€™ve worked very hard all my life and tried to earn respect for myself as a self made professional.\n\n7/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nIt saddens me that no one at work or around ever stood up for me in the past when I was abused and insulted publicly. This time I was left with no option but to take this stern step as this incident happened in front of way too many people.\n\nSometimes we are so ashamed and humiliated that we fool ourselves to believe that no one saw what happened . Everyone always looks away as if they don't exist or then we donâ€™t exist. People are embarrassed just enough to look away, but not too embarrassed to intervene.\n\n8/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nIronically what happened at Wankade is being diluted by every other fabricated story about my character except the truth of what happened. I'm sure the witnesses will speak the truth and I trust and believe that the police will do their job fairly and quickly.\n\nNo woman likes to be involved in a controversy like this which makes her open and vulnerable for all to take a dig at.\n\n9/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nI have worked for over 15 years in the film industry and have never been subject to such humiliating behaviour and for that I really want to thank all the men that worked with me. Through all our highs and lows my head was always held high.\n\nEvery human being has a limit to how much they can take; some of us foolishly call it strength and try to look ahead focusing on the positives of work and life.\n\n10/ 10\n\nPreity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case\n\nAll these years I have never said anything about him in the media but now I have no choice.\n\nI humbly request the media and my supporters to pls focus on the issue and the incident that happened in Wankade and not turn this and me into a TV soap. This is not easy for me and my intention is not to harm anyone but simply to protect myself and to stand up for myself. I donâ€™t want any sympathy from anyone but I will sincerely appreciate it if people do not try to take away my dignity in the process of my fight for respect at my workplace. I think after all these years I deserve it and Iâ€™m not asking for too much.\n\nThank you.\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nHow to make sattvik Mango Kheer for Sawan Somwar\n\nFood\n\nAshnoor Kaurâ€™s stylish and gorgeous looks\n\nindia\n\nKhushi Kapoor dazzles in a stunning beige lehenga choli set\n\nindia\n\nBad Newz girl Tripti Dimri is a style chameleon\n\nindia\n\nNayantharaâ€™s diet for a healthy and happy life\n\nindia\n\nSadhguru's inspiring quotes on good leadership and success\n\nindia\n\n10 must-try Gujarati dishes during monsoon\n\nFood\n\nWhy is Meena an evergreen beauty?\n\nindia\n\n10 popular Indian chutneys that go best with snacks\n\nFood"
