        "meta_description": "Preity Zinta and Suchitra Pillai collaborated in Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai' in 2001. Recently, Suchitra revealed that her husband, Lars Kjeldsen, had previously dated Preity Zinta. Responding to being labeled a 'boyfriend snatcher' after marrying Lars in 2005, Suchitra clarified during her latest interview, with Siddharth Kannan, that she and Preity were never friends. She explained that Lars dated Preity before they met and emphasized that their breakup had nothing to do with her. Suchitra recounted a misunderstanding that led to her being dubbed a 'boyfriend snatcher' in the media, clarifying that it was because she dated Andrew Coyne. She underscored that Andrew's breakup with his partner was unrelated to her. Suchitra and Lars have a daughter named Annika Kjeldsen. On the other hand, Preity tied the knot with Gene Goodenough, a finance analyst based in Los Angeles, in 2016, and the couple welcomed twins via surrogacy in 2021. Preity's upcoming project is 'Lahore 1947,' where she will star alongside Sunny Deol.",
