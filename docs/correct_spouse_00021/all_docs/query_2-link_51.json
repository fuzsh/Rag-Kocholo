        "text": "Indian actress Preity Zinta, who married longtime beau Gene Goodenough on February 29 in Los Angeles in a secret wedding, has officially announced the news in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nIn what has to be one of the more sporting wedding announcements, the actress, 42, wrote on social media: \"I was holding on the \"Miss Tag\" rather seriously till now, until I met someone \"Goodenough\" to give it up for. So now I join the Married Club folks.\n\n\"Thank you all for your good wishes & for all your love. Love you all. Let the Goodenough jokes begin.\"\n\nFacebook/PreityZinta\n\nThere's a reason why no pictures from the wedding is still out.\n\nPreity and Gene have decided that they will auction their marriage pictures and donate the proceeds to Preity's charity foundation. They have done it for a good cause so they have clearly instructed everyone present to not share any images from their big night.\n\nPreity and Gene, a financial analyst, who are rumoured to have been in a relationship for the past 18 months, will reportedly host a Bollywood-style reception in Mumbai in April.\n\nThe actress was earlier believed to be in a relationship with industrialist Ness Wadia.\n\nNess and Preity, co-owners of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kings XI Punjab, are believed to have dated for five years between 2005 and 2009.\n\nIn June 2014, the actress filed a police complaint accusing the Wadia Group scion of having attacked her at an IPL match in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.\n\nNot many know that Gene was a key eye-witness when Preity had lodged a police complaint stating that her ex Ness molested her.\n\nPreity acted in such as 'Dil Se', 'Chori Chori Chupke Chupke', 'Kya Kehna', 'Mission Kashmir', 'Kal Ho Na Ho' and 'Sangharsh', made a comeback with the poorly-received 'Ishkq in Paris' (2013) which she produced as well as starred in. She was last seen in 2014's 'Happy Ending'."
