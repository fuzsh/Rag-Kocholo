        "text": "Bollywood actress Preity Zinta, who married her long-time boyfriend Gene Goodenough on February 29 in Los Angeles, showed glimpses of her life after marriage and her financial analyst husband in a chat session with fans on Twitter.\n\nPreity made generously use of the phrase 'good enough' in every possible reply of hers saying her husband is a workaholic and is 'trying to save the world' in his own way, and that he will not be visiting India very soon.\n\nShe also shared a picture that explains the 'only' difference between her singlehood earlier and married status now - wearing the traditional red bangles (chuda).\n\nTwitter\n\nYou can't possibly miss the happiness on the new brideâ€™s face. Preity had also shared a selfie of playing holi (festival of colour) with her husband a while back.\n\nPreity and Gene married each other in a hush hush ceremony attended only by close friends and family members.\n\nTwitter\n\nPreity, who co-owns Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab with her ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia, told her fans on Twitter that she will continue visiting IPL matches because she is simply married and not 'kidnapped'. She added that she hopes she is accompanied by Gene.\n\nThe actress who last made an appearance in 'Happy Ending' along with Saif Ali Khan, will be soon seen in 'Bhaiyyaji Superhitt'. However, the release date of the movie is yet to be announced."
