Preity Zinta has been asked by the Bombay High Court to reply to the latest petition filed by industrialist Ness Wadia in the 2014 molestation case. Wadia has asked the court that he wants to 'bury the hatchet' and therefore, a request has been made to Preity to 'quash' the case filed by her against him.

Wadia's lawyer, Abaad Ponda, was quoted by an agency saying, "We (Wadia) want to bury the hatchet. The complainant is married now and has moved on with her life. The two even sit at the same table during the IPL players' auction now".

Zinta, however, hasn't given any response to the latest development in the case. The next hearing in the case, seeking reply from the actress, has been scheduled for August 20, by the division bench of Justices RM Savant and Revati Mohite-Dere.

The case:

It all happened in 2014 during an IPL match at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Both Preity and Ness co-own team Kings XI Punjab. The actress had alleged in a complaint filed on June 13, 2014, that Ness molested her at the stadium on May 30, 2014. As per the complaint filed, Ness was abusing the team staff over ticket distribution issue when he grabbed Preity's arm and abused her, following her attempt to calm him down.

It was only in February this year that a charge sheet was filed in the cast against Wadia. He, however, taking the case to the high court, filed a petition claiming that whatever happened was a "misunderstanding".
