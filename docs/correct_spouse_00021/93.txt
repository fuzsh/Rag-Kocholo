Buzz is that actress Preity Zinta is getting married to long-time beau Gene Goodenough in January 2016.

Preity, who was last spotted at the Bachchan's Diwali bash, is rumoured to be tying the knots in an intimate and small ceremony.

It is reported that the actress will be flying to the US in January next year for the ceremony, which will be held in the presence of only family and close friends, according to Mumbai Mirror.

Preity and Gene have been going steady for some time and it was Gene who stood by Preity throughout her fight with former boyfriend Ness Wadia.

"He supports, encourages and understands her. Gene gave her company during this year's IPL and she flew back with him to the US after the finals, as he had to return to work," Bollywood Life quoted a source as saying.

Gene, who is a financial analyst in Los Angeles, and Preity know each other for a few years. The duo met each other during one of Preity's trips to US.

However, there is no confirmation to the reports, but if the news is true, then well wishers will be happy and excited to see Preity getting settled like her close friend Rani Mukerji. Diwali selfie of the two friends were doing the rounds of the internet recently.

On the other hand, another source close to Preity told Bollywood Life, "Gene is NOT Preity's boyfriend. He is a very good friend. Preity's brother and little niece live in the US and she visits them regularly. She therefore has a lot of very good friends in America."
