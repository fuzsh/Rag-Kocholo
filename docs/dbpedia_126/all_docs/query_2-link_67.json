        "text": "Lisa Duggan\n\nI’ll start by saying that in my field, American Studies, when people write about empire and colonialism, they include discussions about desire, fantasy, libido, as well as race, gender, sexuality, and intimacy. So if you read about empire or colonialism, you’ll find that it’s not just treated as a rational system based solely on institutions. It’s also about fantasy and desire. However, most people who write about neoliberalism are social scientists who overlook fantasy, desire, and libido. But it seems to me that neoliberalism is actually full of these elements. That’s one of the ways people are recruited to support brutal neoliberal policies — through their feelings and fantasies.\n\nMost people start out reading Ayn Rand’s two most famous novels, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, in high school. The novels are a kind of conversion machine. Many people who go on to a wide range of right-wing and pro-capitalist politics start out by being fans of Ayn Rand, and then they encounter Milton Friedman or the International Monetary Fund or the Cato Institute or the Koch brothers. But they’re set up through Ayn Rand’s fantasies of heroic, sexy, entrepreneurial supremacy. She’s a gateway drug. Her work is filled with a sense of aspiration to superiority, a sense of “me against the world” that appeals to adolescents a lot. So it’s a big machine for converting adolescents to a set of feelings and fantasies that then fold into conservative, right-wing, and pro-capitalist politics.\n\nAyn Rand was originally from Russia, and her primary formation was rooted in her opposition to the Bolsheviks. After becoming an expat and coming to the United States, her core belief was against solidarity. She used the term “collectivism,” but what she truly opposed was unity among less successful and dependent individuals. Ayn Rand believed that when inferior people come together, they negatively impact the world.\n\nThis outlook led to feelings of contempt, derision, and a sense of superiority, which shaped her early years. These sentiments carried on throughout the entire twentieth century, leading her to oppose the New Deal due to its perceived compassion issue. She also became anti-communist. Her opposition was not just practical, but strongly felt. Because solidarity is not just an alliance, it’s a feeling. It’s a way of connecting with others and their struggles. It’s not merely a shared set of interests; it’s also an emotional experience. For example, when you witness a teachers’ strike and you are moved to tears, the emotion you feel in that moment is solidarity. This is the feeling she opposed.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nLauren Berlant’s book Cruel Optimism explores the challenging reality of staying motivated and striving for a better life despite facing numerous losses and hardships resulting from the erosion of the social safety net, the disappearance of decent jobs, and other consequences of neoliberal policies. People endure these difficulties by holding onto some version of the good life, even when they can see it slipping away.\n\nThey continue to pursue higher education or job opportunities, even when prospects are bleak. They take on precarious jobs, believing that eventually they will achieve security and improvement. Berlant skillfully examines the emotional traces that sustain individuals in the face of overwhelming odds and evidence to the contrary. To Berlant, cruel optimism is the belief of a better future despite the absence of actual flourishing. She views this optimism as cruel to those who embrace it. This is a consequence of policy.\n\nBerlant is discussing the 99 percent, addressing ordinary people and how they persevere. I wanted to delve into how people begin to identify with the 1 percent, even if they do not belong to that category. I wanted to explore how these identifications form, causing individuals’ aspirations to align, for example, with Donald Trump, even when their own lives do not. Therefore I introduced the term “optimistic cruelty,” and specifically applied it to Ayn Rand’s ideas. These ideas fuel the rise of capitalism in the United States. These forms of cruelty, hierarchies, and brutalities are believed to ultimately lead to the best life for everyone.\n\nOptimistic cruelty is the idea that entrepreneurs will make jobs; and even though people won’t make very much money, they don’t really deserve and can’t really appreciate more than that; and that we’ll get the best world possible if we have brutal, raw, competitive, unregulated capitalism. The premise of Atlas Shrugged is that when the New Deal erodes that kind of raw capitalism, the world disintegrates and collapses, and the entrepreneurs have to escape to their little utopian — or what we would see as dystopian — “Gulch” in order to escape the world that’s collapsing in the face of the erosion of capitalism.\n\nSo that’s optimistic cruelty. I would use the term “optimistic cruelty” to talk about the twentieth-century layering in of Ayn Rand’s feelings as they applied to the rise and triumph of a certain kind of capitalism. But at this point I’m not sure I would call it optimistic anymore. It’s a much grimmer and darker vision that advocates of Ayn Rand have today, whether they’re in the Trump administration or in Silicon Valley. They are no longer investing in a vision of ultimate good and triumph, but rather openly taking everything while it burns to the ground.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nThat’s really key to the influence she has, because the erotic force of her novels works as the conversion machine. She began as a child in St Petersburg, reading imperial children’s fiction. She identified with, say, British captains in India, who demonstrated their superiority over the Hindu masses, among other things. She had a kind of erotic thrill about these characters as a child, and she wrote about them in her journals and so forth. These were very Aryan characters who were physically “perfect,” who were dominant over the lower orders, who were contemptuous — and to her, that was sexiness. Her fantasy was of their superiority.\n\nSo when she wrote her masculine characters, she eroticized these qualities. She does not invent these ideas; rather, she taps into deep threads of civilizational discourse. So people read and they recognize the way that a kind of civilizational domination has been eroticized as part of the project of empire. She incorporates this discourse into her stories, creating romance plots with characters who embody this eroticized civilizational discourse. There’s always a little soft BDSM going on.\n\nThe female characters are also eroticized in a parallel way. She’s kind of an Ann Coulter feminist. She believes in gender equality as long as there’s a strong gender binary, where women are glamorous and men are manly. And women can be equal to men in all aspects — in Atlas Shrugged, the female hero runs a railroad — except sex, where the women are all femme power bottoms. Their power in the world is derived from their glamorous and sexy femininity, which is tied to their whiteness, slenderness, their Aryan blonde looks. The only area where they prove their femininity is through submission to a male hero.\n\nTeenagers read this work and they often find points of sexiness where they identify aspirationally with the heroic characters. Like, “I will be the exceptional creative figure who breaks out from the mediocre, and there’s a set of identifications that attach, and that will make me sexy.” You can see that in the way that, say, Silicon Valley tech moguls who maybe were nerds in high school invent themselves into Ayn Rand heroes. Donald Trump thinks he’s an Ayn Rand hero. He imagines himself to be Howard Roark. In fact, he’s an Ayn Rand villain. He’s a crony capitalist. He doesn’t have the type of body that Ayn Rand would have found powerful and sexy, and she would’ve made hideous fun of him. But he eroticizes his own being in the world as an Ayn Rand hero.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nBecause that would have contradicted her fundamental commitment to a binary gender structure. In her work and novels, femininity itself is defined by submission, though she tries to somewhat mitigate this by suggesting that submission only exists in the bedroom and not in other areas of life.\n\nIn her personal life, things were different. She essentially cast her husband based on her own Aryan hero ideal: tall, handsome, blonde, and slender. But he was a wallflower. Well, he was a florist. He loved peacocks. He dressed beautifully. He was very passive. He did everything she told him to. He sat around and looked glamorous. He was basically almost her butler. And then he died of alcoholism. But she always introduced him as her hero — This is my masculine Ayn Rand hero. He looked like one, but he had none of the other characteristics that she ascribed.\n\nHer life and work are full of incredible contradictions. So here she is, the ultimate rationalist who had a complete mental breakdown when she found out her boyfriend was cheating on her. She’s the ultimate individualist who is the head of a cult where everyone has to follow and believe everything that she says. So her life and even her work itself is just rife with contradiction.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nYeah. It is very Trumpian.\n\nHer vision for herself began in this optimistic arc where she thought she was a genius, and she believed she’d go to Hollywood and she’d really make it there. But in fact, she didn’t understand Hollywood or how Hollywood worked. So she got driven out of Hollywood. She went to Washington. She tried to be part of the anti-communist program there in the McCarthy era. She so misunderstood the message that they didn’t even invite her back for a second day of testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. She went to New York, and she was rude and demanding and alienated everyone. And by the end of her life, she was depressed and alone. She died of lung cancer. She had been a smoker all her life who always denied that smoking had any connection with lung cancer. And she asserted that unto her death of lung cancer, pretty much alone.\n\nShe started out optimistic about the future of herself and of capitalism. By the time she died, which was in 1982 — so right at the beginning of the real state project of neoliberalism — she was grim and depressed and no longer optimistic about anything. She was in constant rage at the time of her death. And you can see a parallel between her personal arc and the twentieth-to-twenty-first-century arc of neoliberalism as well.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nOh, she had a superficial approach to reading. She joined a reading group organized by Isabelle Paterson, another right-wing writer and journalist, and through that she read some secondary right-wing literature, but she never really delved deep into most of these texts. She didn’t have a clear understanding of capitalism, despite being portrayed as its most important advocate. It’s worth noting that when she was in Hollywood, her main criticism of Cecil B. DeMille was that he prioritized pursuing box office success, which is quite remarkable considering what capitalism actually involves.\n\nThe Fountainhead revolves around an architect who stays true to his own vision while facing obstacles from other mediocre architects, pandering newspapers, collectivist bureaucrats, and profit-driven businessmen. The protagonist is portrayed as the hero in this story. This is how she saw herself in Hollywood — the creative intellectual hindered by studio executives and directors and the business of Hollywood, the box office chasing, which prevented her from being the star writer she was supposed to be.\n\nThat’s another example of her misunderstanding. Capitalism is a collectivist and corporate enterprise. It’s a class project. She really didn’t understand that. She failed to grasp that capitalism is inherently a collaborative effort between the state and capitalists, which is a defining characteristic of its history. Instead she perpetuated the fantasy that capitalism is driven by brilliant and superior individuals who are not hindered by mediocre people. Her understanding of capitalism was flawed, and she never self-critiqued or acknowledged that her perspective was incorrect. She simply believed that everyone else was practicing capitalism incorrectly.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nYou know, what is particularly interesting about her and what makes her, in my opinion, the breakout icon that she became, is that she doesn’t just stop at promoting the complacent view of the superiority of European civilization, white supremacy, and capitalism. While she does do that, her personal experiences as a Jewish person in Russia and as a woman meant that she herself faced exclusion and was unable to achieve many of the things she believed she deserved. She was bitterly angry about her own situation, despite having antisemitic views herself and holding a view that femininity ultimately required submission. People patronized and dismissed her due to her Jewish heritage, Russian immigrant background, and gender. She resented not being accepted into the privileged, complacent elite of capitalists and intellectuals she aspired to be a part of.\n\nSo her fiction and her thinking are a combination of advocating the deep hierarchies of Western civilization and expressing her anger about feeling like an outsider. Her plots and characters are influenced by these experiences, providing points of identification for those who also feel marginalized. It is worth noting that she has a significant following beyond just the right-wing. She has a large queer fan base, including those who write fan fiction. An article in a recent issue of Gay & Lesbian Review explored the homoerotic themes in The Fountainhead — without delving into the broader context of the book, which is quite common.\n\nHer representation of marriage in her works emphasizes it as something that holds individuals back, despite her own marriage, which was for citizenship purposes, not producing any children. She portrays the limitations imposed by family, state, and church, and the desire to break free from them. Many teenagers identify with this notion, feeling that the family, church, and state inhibit their true selves, and her work is about how a creative individual can rebel against these constraints. As a result, she has garnered a sizable following, even among progressives who may overlook the broader context of her book.\n\nFor example, a well-respected Belgian social democratic gay playwright named Ivo van Hove recently staged a production of The Fountainhead at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. It was very well-reviewed. It was full of the cultural elite of Manhattan. And it was uncritical. It was very well done, you know, a faithful dramatization of The Fountainhead. He was interviewed about it, and he said someone gave him a copy of The Fountainhead, and he loved it. He loved it so much that he knew he had to stage it. And it was because of this struggle of the creative individual.\n\nTo create what you envision against all the interference of people who want to take you down — he resonated with that. The fact that everybody’s sitting there in this theater and on the stage, I mean, what happens in the end is Howard Roark blows up a public housing project because it isn’t built according to his specifications, and everyone is supposed to cheer.\n\nAnd these are progressives! These are New York anti-Trump liberals, and the author of this document is a European social democrat. They are ignoring the context. I actually went around and talked to people outside the production. I went multiple times, and what I observed is that they simply overlook the context because it is so deeply familiar to them. It is culturally ingrained. They don’t even recognize the brutality, cruelty, inequality, and racism that are present in the story. Instead, they focus on the romantic plot and individual creative achievements, and they’re not even registering the larger context.\n\nSo I think that is, in a sense, the problem of liberalism. Even when it’s advocated by people who are not elite, there’s a dropping away of the political-economic context to focus on one particular kind of struggle without considering the broader context. Ayn Rand facilitates these identifications from outsiders because she was, in a sense, an outsider herself. Her anger about this is not explicitly addressed in her work, but it finds its way into her plots and characters, making it easier for outsiders to resonate with her ideas without fully recognizing the brutality of the larger context. One of the reasons I wrote this book was to make it impossible, or less possible, for anyone to ignore the broader context behind the popularity of her fiction.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nAnd so reproductive labor is a similarly brute animal. It’s like growing a plant, right? You’re no different than the soil. She doesn’t see reproduction as creative or productive labor, either. She just sees it as like a brute bare life.\n\nBecause she saw her escape from Russia as being an escape from the state, the family, and the church, these are aligned to her. She sees them all as the site of a kind of negative solidarity. The family will keep you down, the state will keep you down, the church will keep you down — and the only way to achieve is to escape them. And for Rand, the nanny state is very much like the wife. They do servile labor. They also nag and try to control you.\n\nSo the regulated managerial state is also aligned with the wife, and wives are terrible in her fiction. They’re all horrifying, nagging, controlling harridans. And all the sexy women are all mistresses without children, mostly without husbands, or their husbands are serially discarded. Meanwhile the men, if they have families, their families have a totally destructive impact on them.\n\nThe feeling of wanting to escape the family, the church, and the state is an opening for a certain kind of identification — but she’s not producing a liberation politics out of that, which is an understatement. For her it’s really just that women are a drag. Children are a drag. And the only way a woman can not be a drag is if she basically is a professional, Aryan, achieving coproducer. That’s her route to being a person. Other than that, she’s not a person. She’s a representative of the kind of brute world that brings you down. So there’s tremendous misogyny in her representations. Even as she produces this sort of very limited, specific kind of equivalence, I wouldn’t call it equality.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nThat’s how her understanding, her fantasy of the US was built — entirely on the early Hollywood movies that she went to compulsively when she was in school in St Petersburg. So she would go first to European movies and then Hollywood movies. And she just loved Hollywood. She loved Hollywood movies. She loved the glamor, she loved the sparkle. She transferred her erotic fantasy life and identifications from European imperial children’s fiction to these Hollywood versions of gendered, eroticized, white supremacist capitalism.\n\nThen she came to the US and went right to Hollywood. Her first job was as a script reader for Cecil B. DeMille. So she went right into the Hollywood machine, and her fantasies and the fantasies of those moguls were close. She wanted to be violently assimilationist. She was born Alisa Rosenbaum — she changed her name to Ayn Rand to erase her gender, religious ethnicity, and national origin in order to be able to be aggressively assimilationist. Her fantasy was that she would achieve easy and immediate success and that she would be glamorous and participate in this fantasy. And then she ran up against the ways that the fantasy being retailed in movies clashed not only with the actual material conditions in the United States but also with how the movie business was run, as a capitalist enterprise.\n\nAnd even though she thought she was pro-capitalist, she didn’t realize that the decisions she objected to were a result of capitalism. She had transferred her idealized vision of Europe from children’s fiction to her perception of the United States, shaped by Hollywood movies. She expected the world she entered to be similar to that image, which was created by immigrants like herself within the capitalist system to appeal to a broad audience in the context of the rising US empire. But this vision of American success ignored the underlying conditions that led to that success, including settler colonialism, labor exploitation, mistreatment of immigrants, and other forms of inequality. These issues were conveniently omitted from the films, as well as any acknowledgment of the labor and inequalities that supported the world they depicted.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nTotally. And she’s a preacher. She’s sharing the truth with you through the voice of one of her heroes. So she has her hero go on for sixty pages — subtle, you know. And it’s like just explaining the truth to you, you idiot.\n\nWhen the books came out, they initially received terrible reviews in the newspapers and the literary press, but they had real word-of-mouth growth. People were not only drawn to her melodrama, heroics, and the sexiness of her characters and romance plots, but there was something about this kind of didactic activism that also created believers. The novels worked like Gone with the Wind or Uncle Tom’s Cabin. They functioned ideologically and polemically even more than they did as a novel.\n\nThey circulated those long speeches, and when you read the novel you not only participated imaginatively in the romance plot, but you were also recruited into a belief system. And that was fairly effective. The thousand-page novels became massively popular. And their sales spiked every now and then. Like right after the crash in 2008, their sales spiked again. At all the Tea Party rallies people had signs that said “Who is John Galt?” — John Galt being the hero from Atlas Shrugged. So decade after decade, new recruits and huge sales for what appeared to be almost unreadable novels. And people memorized lines from them, and they can circulate the sayings and characters from them.\n\nLisa Duggan\n\nAgain, this is contradictory, as so much is in Ayn Rand’s works. She did worship technology in the sense that individual inventors, as portrayed in Anthem, which is governed by a socialist government clearly inspired by the Bolsheviks, were not allowed to use the word “I,” and everyone had to use “we.” Technology is forbidden because if one person has invented the light bulb, they try to suppress it because it would jeopardize the livelihoods of candlemakers. And, you know, Ayn Rand can be funny. She can be really funny alongside her didactic and boring moments. Anthem is funny, and the guy who invents the light bulb is her hero.\n\nIn Atlas Shrugged, a guy invents this magical motor that runs without fuel, and he becomes the hero of the story. Technology and the ability to innovate are central to her ideas. She sees the superiority of the West over indigenous populations as being related to technology. However, due to her individualism, her vision is focused on the individual inventor, and she can’t envision a mass collective technological society.\n\nGalt’s Gulch is hilarious in its anachronisms. Here’s this utopia of entrepreneurial inventors. It’s like an Old West town that has been reinvented. It’s very low tech, but each piece of technology there has an individual inventor. There’s an individual inventor who runs the mill that grinds the corn or whatever. But everybody dresses like it’s a Wild West town. It’s the ideal of the individualist American West married to this kind of idealization of the inventor. They don’t go together very well, but that’s what Galt’s Gulch is."
