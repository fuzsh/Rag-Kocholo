Summary\n\nWomen of Troy is a tragedy which takes place in the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war, critiquing the atrocities committed by the Greeks to both people of Melos and Troy. By constructing a play in which women are able to dominate the stage and exude their genuine despair in response to their impending enslavement, Euripides shifts the perspectives from epic tales of Greek and Trojan male heroes to the conversely affected women who suffered at the hands of the heroes, while simultaneously providing both the contemporary and modern audience with a unique insight into the true cost of war. This is especially significant because the society was pervaded by patriarchal values, where women were subordinated to their male counterparts. Euripidesâ proto-feminist works were not well received by his peers at the time of writing as womenâs personal thoughts and pain were not commonly discussed in the Hellenic repertoire.\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nThe Trojan war occurred as a result of the conflict between Greece and Troy and was said to last for over 10 years. According to a tale, during a festival on the Olympus, Athena, Aphrodite and Hera were fighting over a golden apple. They chose a random mortal, which was Paris who would then be the Prince of Troy, to decide who the most beautiful goddess of the three was. As a reward for picking her, Aphrodite promised Paris that he would be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, which was Helen â wife of Menelaus, the Spartan prince. Aphrodite had her son Eros (a cupid) enchant Helen and Paris so that they would fall endlessly in love with each other. Helen then escaped from Menelausâ palace to be with Paris, starting the war between Greece and Troy. Menelaus was enraged and he convinced his brother Agamemnon to lead an expedition to retrieve Helen. The Greek army was commanded to attack the Trojans. The siege lasted for more than 10 years until the Greeks came up with a strategy to abduct Helen from the palace. The Greek soldiers build a giant wooden horse and hid in there to get in the citadel of Troy, attacking them in the middle of the night and winning the war. After the war, the Greek heroes slowly made their way home, however, the journey home was not easy. Odysseus took 10 years to make the arduous journey home to Ithaca because Poseidon agreed to punish the Greeks for the atrocities committed before and after their victory.\n\n3. Themes\n\nWar\n\nLove and Lust\n\nEuripidesâ works often warn the audience of the detrimental effects brought on by excessive passion, asserting that it is best to moderate emotions and exhibit sophrosyne (the power of self-control over oneâs emotions). He often criticises the goddess of love, Aphrodite, for enchanting mortals and leading them into a life governed by love and lust. In this play, he purports that it is inherently Aphroditeâs fault that the Trojans are fighting against the Greeks, as it is Aphrodite who makes Paris and Helen endlessly fall in love with each other.\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nIn Women of Troy, Euripides presents a particularly acerbic critique on Menelausâ 'uncontrollable lust' in 'sen[ding] a hunting party to track down Helen' as he juxtaposes the cost of the Trojan war being and the prize that they receive.\n\n'tens of thousands dead' Â\n\n'giving up the pleasure of his family and children'\n\n'these Greeks [beginning] to die'\n\nâ All that in exchange for one woman - Helen\n\nHis chastisement is further bolstered by Cassandraâs rhetorical question asking 'they kept on dying, for what reason'. This manoeuvres the audience into acknowledging the pointlessness of the Trojan war as it is not worth risking so many lives over Helen or any minor military conflict. In doing so, Euripides once again lambastes the actions of those vindictive and bloodthirsty Greeks.\n\nCost of War\n\nThe play primarily focuses on the loss and pain of the Trojan civilians that survived the war, are sieged in the city after the war and are eventually either killed or enslaved after the fall of Troy. While the Trojan war is the setting of many famous classical works being examined by various different angles, not many focus on the consequences suffered by women. This enables Euripides to raise the question of whether or not such victory is worth fighting for while simultaneously inviting the audience to emulate the playwrightâs disapprobation of such a violent and brutal resolution of conflict.\n\nYou can also use the evidence from the above to justify your arguments on the cost of war. They all aim to magnify the extent to which the Trojan people, as well as the Greeks, have to suffer as result of this pointless war.\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nWe can also discuss how wars affect beliefs and their peopleâs faith. In the Hellenic society, gods have always been a significant part of their life as it is believed that mortalsâ lives are always under the influence of divine intervention. This is evidenced through the ways in which Hellenic people build temples and make sacrifices to the gods, thanking the gods for allowing them to live prosperous lives and begging for their forgiveness whenever they wrong others. This is why it is significant when Hecuba referred to the gods as 'betrayers' in her lamentation, implying that there is a change in attitude in time of tragedy. Events such as this make people question their fate and belief, galvanising them to wonder 'what good [gods] were to [them].\n\nIntegrity and Sense of Duty\n\nSome characters in Women of Troy are also fundamentally driven by their sense of duty and integrity, and act according to their moral code regardless of what the circumstances may be. Hecuba, for instance, sympathises with the Chorus of Troy and acts as a leader even when she loses her title and her home. She is held responsible for her actions but is still governed by her honesty and integrity as Helen makes her plea. Talthybius is also governed by both his sense of duty and integrity. Despite his understanding of Hecubaâs circumstances, he still follows his order and ensures that the Trojan women are allocated to their Greek households. However, he does not disregard her sense of morality and treats Hecuba with understanding and sensitivity.\n\nHelen, on the other hand, does not demonstrate the same degree of moral uprightness. In time of tragedy, she chooses to lie and shift the blame to others to escape her execution. She prioritises her own benefits over everyone elseâs and allows thousands of others to suffer from the impacts of her treachery in eloping with Paris.\n\nGod/Fate\n\nThe prologue of the play opens with a conversation between Poseidon and Athena, foreshadowing their divine retribution against the Greeks. Witnessing the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war, they curse the war which they ironically themselves initiated, thus condemning the horrific injustice of the conflict and the actions of its vengeful and blood thirsty so-called heroes. This is evidenced through the ways in which they punished Odysseus by creating obstacles on his journey home.\n\nHowever, it can also be argued that the gods in Women of Troy themselves act as a symbol of injustice in a way. From the feminist view, the fall of Troy and the enslavement of Trojan women demonstrate the godsâ lack of care as they disregard the monstrosities that occur to women after the Greeksâ victory. The divine intervention which is promised in the beginning casts the following injustices cursed upon the women of Troy in a different light as it can be argued that the gods caused the war. While their retribution against the Greeks can be seen as a means to punish the heroes, it is evident that that they are more concerned about the sacrilege committed and the disrespect they receive after the Trojan war than the injustices suffered by women. This thereby humanises the gods and fortifies the notion that they also have personal flaws and are governed by their ego and hubris.\n\nThe idea that there are forces beyond human control is enhanced, and Poseidon and Athenaâs pride proves that humans are just innocent bystanders at the mercy of the gods. It can be argued that the chain of unfortunate events are unpredictable as they are determined by gods, whose emotions and prejudices still control the way they act. On the other hand, the characters in the play do at times make choices that would lead to their downfall and tragic consequences. For instance, it is Menelaus who decided to go after the Trojans just because of one woman and he was not enchanted or under any influence of divine intervention.\n\nGender Roles\n\nEuripides centres his play on Trojan women, enabling the discussion on the cause and effect of war. Given that females' points of view were not commonly expressed in plays or any forms of art works, Euripidesâ decision to have his play focus on women allows the Athenian audience, comprised of mainly male Athenians, to observe a part of the military conflict that was not seen before.\n\nThe protagonist Hecuba, for example, is portrayed as the archetypal mother. While this image is presented during the aftermath of the Trojan war, Euripides also uses Hecuba as a representative of contemporary Hellenic women as this archetype is universal for all circumstances. It is evident that Euripidesâ play mainly focuses on Hecubaâs grief, with her lamentation dominating the prologue. This implies that the protagonist, in this instance, also acts as a diatribe against the patriarchal society which allows women to suffer greatly as a result of war and military conflict. However, this play differs from other plays written by Euripides in that he also explores a womanâs burden and responsibility as a leader, allowing the audience to understand the difficulties of being a woman of power in time of crisis.\n\n4. Characters\n\nHecuba\n\nMother of Troy\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nIn employing the simile comparing herself to 'a mother bird at her plundered nest', Hecuba reminds the audience of her endless love for the city of Troy, implying that the devastation of her own home also further deepens her pain. In this scene, Hecuba is portrayed as a female leader who rules with her passion and love. Â\n\nThe image her (Hecuba) as an empathetic Queen is also exemplified through the ways in which she 'weep[s] for [her] burning home'. As the term 'home' invokes connotations of warmth and affection, Hecubaâs endearment for the city she governs is established, accentuating the portrayal of Hecuba as a leader with a passion for her duties.\n\nThis in turn propels the audience to be more inclined to feel commiseration for her when she is held responsible for her cityâs destruction. As the representative of Troyâs leadership that enables such brutality to occur leading to the wars, Hecuba bears the guilt and responsibility for '[giving] birth to all the trouble by giving birth to Paris' and consequently, for the cataclysmic consequences that ramified from Parisâ involvement with Helen (although she is simply an innocent bystander) â Social accountability for war\n\nMother of Her Children\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nFrom the outset of the play, the former queen of Troy is portrayed as a miserable mother suffering from the loss of her own children and 'howl[ing] for her children dead' (echoed by the Chorus, referred to as 'howl of agony'). By employing animalistic language in describing Hecubaâs act of mourning over Hectorâs death, Euripides intensifies the magnitude of her emotional turmoil as it is likened to a loud and doleful cry usually uttered by animals â It is almost not humanly possible to endure so much pain.\n\nThis notion is bolstered by the image of Hecuba drowning in 'her threnody of tears' as it engages the pathos of the audience, establishing her as a victim of war and emphasising the poignant story that is to be unveiled.\n\nThe simile comparing herself to a woman 'dragged as a slave' in her lamentation further fortifies Hecubaâs portrayal as a victim of a play. Here, the juxtaposition between her former title 'by birth [as] Troyâs...Queen' and her current state magnifies the drastic change in life and the loss she suffered, compelling the audience to better sympathise with Hecuba. â Powers can be ephemeral in times of crisis.\n\nTalthybius\n\nTalthybius is sympathetic towards women, establishing himself as a complicated figure with a strong sense of integrity. This is epitomised through the ways in which he employs euphemistic language when announcing the dreadful news to Hecuba. He tries his best to be sensitive and mitigate the impacts of Hecubaâs daughter death to her, announcing that Polyxena 'is to serve Achilles at his tomb' and that 'her fate is settled', 'all her troubles are over'. He was being sensitive and subtle instead of abruptly delivering the news. While he represents an enemy state, he shows that men can also be compassionate, contradicting the Phallocentric belief that men should only be governed by cool logic.\n\nChorus of Trojan Women\n\nIt can be argued that Hecuba acts as the paradigm of the Trojan women as her pain (i.e. the deaths of her children, slavery, the devastation of her city), in a way, represents the suffering of the majority of Hellenic women in times of war, which enhances Euripidesâ condemnation of a society where military conflicts can easily be facilitated. The Chorus of the play often echoes her deepest pain, establishing a sense of camaraderie between female characters of the play.\n\nIn this play, the Chorus acts as the voice of the 'wretched women of Troy', representing the views of the unspoken who are objectified and mistreated by their male counterparts. After Troy lost the war, women were seen as conquests and were traded as slaves, exposing the unfair ethos of a society that was seen as the cradle of civilisation. By allowing the Trojan women to express their indignation and enmity as a response to their impending slavery, Euripides is able to present a critique on the ways in which women were oppressed in Ancient Greece.\n\n5. Literary Devices\n\nSimile (e.g. dragged as a slave)\n\nEuphemism (e.g. serve Achilles at his tomb â euphemism for death)\n\nSymbolism (e.g. Hectorâs shield or Troyâs citadel)\n\nAnimal imagery (e.g. howl of agony)\n\nRhetorical question (e.g. for what reason)\n\nWhy are these important?

A+ Essay Topic Breakdown' (below) for an explanation of our ABC approach so that you understand how we've actually tackled this essay prompt.\n\nStaged in a patriarchal society, Women of Troy was set during the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war â a war between the Greeks and the Trojans. Hecuba is the former queen of Troy, who suffered so much loss as the mother of her children as well as the mother of Troy. She lost her son Hector and her husband in the Trojan war, her daughter Polyxena also died and Cassandra was raped. After the Greeks won, women were allocated to Greek households and forced into slavery, including the queen of Troy. Â She was also the mother of Paris, the prince of Troy. It was purported that Paris and Helen were responsible for initiating the war as Helen was governed by her lust for Paris and left Menelaus, the Spartan prince, for this young prince of Troy. Consequently, Menelaus was enraged by this elopement and declared that he wanted Helen dead as a punishment for her disloyalty. Helen defended herself and lied that it was against her will, crying that she was kidnapped and blamed Hecuba for the fall of Troy and for the conflict between the two sides. However, Menelaus did not believe what Helen had to say and decided to bring her back to her home on a separate ship.\n\nThe play ended with the Greek ships leaving Troy, which was then on fire. The Trojan were singing a sad song together as they left to prepare for their new lives as slaves living in Greek households.\n\nThe playâs main focus is on the suffering of women, as exemplified by the way Euripides chose to portray Hecubaâs loss and Cassandraâs helplessness.\n\nSo, our essay prompt for today is\n\n'How does Euripides use the structure of the play to explore the role of women and their suffering in time of war?'\n\nThis is indeed one of the more challenging prompts that VCAA wouldnât probably give, the reason being that it is a language/structure-based prompt. It requires you to have a much more profound knowledge of the text, and it is not always easy to spot language features, especially in a poetic sounding play like Women of Troy. There is just so much going on in the text! While it is not super likely that you will get this prompt for the exam, I have seen a lot of schools give language/structure-based prompts to students for SACs as it gives them an opportunity to challenge themselves and look for textual evidence that will distinguish them from their peers. These types of evidence are definitely worth looking for because they can also be used as evidence to back up your arguments for theme-based or character-based prompts (learn more about the different types of prompts in How To Write A Killer Text Response).\n\nNow letâs get started.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing I always do is to look for keywords. The key words in this prompt are 'structure, 'role of women' and 'suffering'.\n\nWith the structure of the play, we can potentially talk about:\n\nCharacter-related evidence (e.g. strong female character base)\n\nLanguage-related features (metalanguage/literacy devices)\n\nPlot-related features (order of events) â irony, foreshadowing\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIn a male-dominated, patriarchal society, women are oftentimes oppressed and seen as inferior. Their roles in the society were limited, they were only seen as domestic housewives and mothers. It is important to look for evidence that either supports or contradicts this statement. Ask yourself:\n\nIs Euripides trying to support the statement and agree that women are simply creatures of emotions who should only stick with domestic duties?\n\nOr is he trying to criticise this belief by showing that women are so much more than just those being governed by their emotions?\n\nSince this play primarily focuses on the cost of war and how women, as innocent bystanders, have to suffer as a result of the Trojan war, it should not be difficult finding evidence related to womenâs suffering. It might include:\n\nHecubaâs loss (she lost her home and children)\n\nHecubaâs pain (being blamed for Troyâs ruin)\n\nCassandraâs helplessness despite knowing her fate, surrendering and accepting her future\n\nAndromacheâs 'bitter' fate having to give up her child\n\nThe Chorus voicing their opinion â slavery\n\nOnce a prompt is carefully broken down, it is no longer that scary because all we have to do now is organise our thoughts and write our topic sentences.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nP1: Euripides constructs a strong female character base to contradict the prevailing views of the period that women are inferior to their male counterparts.\n\nIt is significant that Euripides chose to have a strong female protagonist, as the character herself acts as a diatribe against the patriarchal society, contradicting any engrained beliefs that pervaded the society at the time. An example of evidence that can support this statement is the way in which Hecuba dominates the stage while giving her opening lamentation. The lengthy nature of the monologue itself enables Euripides to present his proto-feminist ideas and go against the Hellenic gendered prejudice.\n\nWe can also talk about Hecubaâs leadership and her interaction with the Chorus of Trojan women. She refers to them as 'my children' and employs the simile 'a mother at her plundered nest'. The way the Greek playwright constructs the relationship between characters is worth mentioning as Hecuba in this play is portrayed as a compassionate and empathetic leader, showing that women are also capable of leading others in a way that engenders a sense of camaraderie between them.\n\nAnother good thinking point is to talk about how Helen acts as a paradigm of a group of women who had to turn to deception and go against their integrity to survive in time of tragedy.\n\nP2: Euripidesâ selective use of language and literacy devices in portraying womenâs pain and suffering further enables him to portray the ways in which women, as innocent bystanders, are oppressed in time of war.\n\nAn example of a metalanguage used in this play is the animal imagery the Chorus used to depict Hecubaâs pain. By referring to her pain as a 'howl of agony', they intensify the magnitude of Hecubaâs pain as the term 'howl' is usually used to describe a loud cry usually uttered by animals like wolves. This implies that Hecuba, who acts as representative of Hellenic women, has to suffer from an emotional turmoil that is far beyond bearable, which in turn further fortifies the audienceâs sympathy for her, as well as the Trojan women.\n\nAnother piece of evidence that I would talk about is the simile 'dragged as a slave'. It was used to describe Hecuba, the former queen of Troy. By likening someone who used to be at a position of power to 'a slave', Euripides underscores the drastic change in circumstances that occurred as a result of the Trojan war, magnifying the tremendous amount of loss Hecuba experienced. Furthermore, the image of the protagonistâs devastated physical state enhances the dramatistâs condemnation of war as it allows him to elucidate the detrimental impacts such violence and dreadfulness impose on innocent bystanders.\n\nThere is, of course, plenty of other evidence out there such as the way in which Cassandra is portrayed as a 'poor mad child', her helplessness in surrendering to her 'wretched' fate with Agamemnon who wanted her for himself. We can also talk about the inclusive language positing, 'our misery', 'our home', used by the Chorus in echoing Hecubaâs pain, etc.\n\nThe use of symbolism can also be discussed. For instance, the citadel in the city of Troy in the epilogue acts as a metonym for Hecubaâs resistance before entering slavery. The image of it crumbling exemplifies womenâs helplessness and enhances the notion that they are still in positions of explicit subjugation.\n\nP3: While Euripides primarily focuses on portraying womenâs pain and suffering, he does not completely vilify men or victimise women, maintaining an unbiased view so as to underscore the importance of integrity through his characterisation of both male and female character.\n\nThe last body paragraph of our essays is often the one used to challenge the prompt, showing the assessors our wealth of ideas and depth of knowledge. Basically, what we are saying is 'while our playwright is obviously pro-women, he definitely does not condone everything women do and criticise everything men do'. Â In this way, we have the opportunity to explore the ways characters are constructed and the ways they are used in the play to convey its meaning.\n\nIf I were to write an essay on this, I would talk about Talthybius and Helen, mainly because they are both complex characters that the audience cannot fully love or hate.\n\nTalthybius is surprisingly sympathetic towards women, establishing himself as a complicated figure. This is epitomised by the ways in which he employs euphemistic language when announcing the dreadful news to Hecuba. He tries his best to be sensitive and mitigate the impacts of Hecubaâs daughter's death to her, announcing that Polyxena 'is to serve Achilles at his tomb', that 'her fate is settled' and 'all her troubles are over'. He was being sensitive and subtle instead of abruptly delivering the news. While he represents an enemy state, he shows that men can also be compassionate, contradicting the Phallocentric belief that men should only be governed by cool logic.\n\nSimilar to Talthybius, Helen is also a complicated figure as she is both a victim of fate and a selfish character. It is possible for the audience to sympathise with her as she is merely a victim of fortune in that she was bewitched by Aphrodite and governed by her love for Paris, the prince of Troy. However, the ways in which she shifts the blame to Hecuba and makes her pleas preclude the audience from completely sympathising with her they, in a way, render her as a self-absorbed and repugnant character. This notion is further fortified by the fact that she cared so little for the 'tens of thousands' lives taken on her behalf as the phrase quantifies and magnifies the cataclysmic consequences of her lust for Paris.\n\n6.

A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nQuote-Based Prompt:\n\n'Who can forget these sufferings? Time will bring no relief.' There is no villain in Women of Troy because everyone in the play suffers. Do you agree with the statement?\n\nThe following comes essay topic breakdown comes from our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy ebook:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe quote mentions long-lasting sufferings, and the prompt seems to ask who suffers, and who is responsible. If youâve been reading this guide in order, a lot of similar ideas from the last four essays might jump out here - I think thatâs okay, because ideally you do get to a point where you can ârecycleâ some of your quotes and ideas between essays (and the examiner wonât have to read all your practice essays anyway!).\n\nWhile Iâll be doing a little bit of recycling here, I want the main take-away point from this essay to be around framing. Even if youâre using similar ideas that youâve already seen, the trick is to explain and frame your analysis in a way that answers every prompt specifically. This is best done through how you thread your arguments together, and how you make those links. Weâll get into this as we plan.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nFor now, letâs recap these ideas of suffering and responsibility. Hecuba and the Trojan women suffer, and they argue Helen is responsible - but Helen also suffers, and she argues that the gods are responsible. The gods, as we know, are insulated from suffering because of their divine and superhuman status. So, are they the villains?\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nThis is a similar progression of ideas that we have seen before, but I want to ground them in this cycle of suffering-responsibility.\n\nP1: The eponymous women of Troy certainly suffer, and in many of their eyes, Helen is a villain.\n\nP2: However, Helen does not see herself that way - and she is not incorrect. She too seems to suffer, and she sees the gods as the main villains who are responsible.\n\nP3: Euripides may see the gods as careless and negligent beings, but he doesnât necessarily depict them as cruel; rather, the excessively passionate war itself is depicted as the true enemy, and villains are those who revel in its cruelty.\n\nAs you might notice, parts of this plan are recognisable: weâve started a few of these essays with a first paragraph about the Trojan womenâs suffering, developed that in paragraph two by contrasting with Helen, and ending our analysis with the gods. But when reusing some of those ideas, itâs important to make sure they answer the specific question by modifying and adding new ideas as needed - this way, you donât rewrite essays for new prompts and risk losing relevance, but you do reuse ideas and tailor them to new prompts every time.\n\nThe contention for this one will be: the Trojan War undoubtedly has its winners and losers, and few of these characters agree on who the responsible villains are, with some blaming Helen (P1) while she herself blames the gods (P2). However, the gods only form a part of the picture - rather, Euripides depicts war itself as the villain, lambasting those who take pride in inflicting cruelty in the midst of war (P3).\n\nIf you'd like to see an A+ essay on the essay topic above check out our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy ebook.\n\n8.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Crucible, Arthur Millerâs 1953 realist play, is based on the historical events of the 1692 Salem witch hunts. Although partially fictionalised, it depicts the very real consequences of false accusations based on blind religious faith, as Miller displays the dangers of such baseless rumours. However, the play was written during another type of witch hunt: McCarthyism in 1950s America. This was a political movement in which Senator Joseph McCarthy attempted to control the spread of Communism by placing any Communist sympathisers on a blacklist. This resulted in a widespread fear of Communist influences, and a political hunt similar to the Salem witch trials began, as civilians attempted to escape their own charges by accusing other innocent individuals of treason. Thus, given the historical context of the time, Miller uses The Crucible as an allegorical warning for the audience against the dangers of McCarthyism in 1950s America.Â\n\nThese concepts will be fully unpacked later, but it is important to keep these key notions of hysteria, accusation and blind faith in mind as you study the text. These are the fundamental ideas that the play is based upon, and also the elements which make The Crucible hugely relevant in our society today. One could even say that the development of technology has made it easier for false allegations and social rumours to spread - leading to drastic consequences specific to the 21st century, such as the leaking of critical government information and cyberbullying. Not to mention, the anonymity of technology has enabled individuals to start modern-day witch hunts as a nameless, faceless user behind the comfort and security of their screens!\n\nHistorical Context\n\nIn varying degrees, every work of literature reflects its historical context, or the social and political conditions that shaped its time period. The Crucible is a four-act play, which presents a dramatised and partially fictionalised depiction of the 1692 Salem witch trials. It was also published in 1953, at the height of the Second Red Scare, or the heightened fear of Communist influences in America. As such, the play is not merely a play based on historically accurate events, but also an allegory of the disastrous consequences of McCarthyism.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nJohn Proctor\n\nProctor is a strong and hardworking farmer, respected by those in Salem for his power and independence. Possessing a âsharp and biting way with hypocritesâ, Proctor is the symbol of autonomous leadership in the play, acting as another source of social authority to the theocratic leaders of the Puritan Church. He is the protagonist of the play, but a flawed individual - while he has great strength of character, he is also presented in The Crucible as an adulterous husband, who is openly defiant of his church. As such, he is described by Miller as a kind of âsinnerâ - one who experiences an internal moral conflict within himself. Proctor undergoes much personal growth during the plot of the play, redeeming his name and obtaining âgoodnessâ by choosing moral honesty over freedom. This ultimate act of courage symbolises the importance of integrity and honour, and represents the âshred of goodnessâ in his character.Â\n\nElizabeth Proctor\n\nAlthough described by Abigail as a âbitter womanâ, Elizabeth is the quiet yet resilient wife of Proctor. Her husbandâs affair with Abigail renders her resentful towards the former and jealous of the latter, resulting in a wounded and fragile marriage. Her humility is made evident as she blames herself for Proctorâs infidelity, believing she erred in keeping a âcold houseâ. In tandem with this icy imagery, Miller utilises Elizabeth as a symbol of honesty and strict moral justice, despite it often being mistaken as âcoldnessâ by others - Proctor asserts that Elizabethâs justice âwould freeze beerâ. Despite this, Elizabeth proves herself to be a caring source of support for her persecuted husband, believing him to be âa good manâ, and ultimately breaking her characteristic honesty in the hopes of his freedom. Her extreme courage is ultimately made evident by her willingness to lose Proctor to the hangmanâs noose, rather than for him to lose his moral virtue by signing his name to lies.Â\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nDescribed as âa wild thingâ, Abigail is a beautiful, yet manipulative and deceptive adolescent with âan endless capacity for dissemblingâ. Still in love with Proctor after their brief affair, she lies to the court and condemns Elizabeth as a witch, in a desperate, jealous attempt to win him back and take Elizabethâs place as his wife. Abigail is the ringleader of the girls, and the progenitor of the false rumours that spiral into the witch hunt. Thus, she embodies falsehood, in a stark contrast to Elizabeth, who is a symbol of truth. Her violent nature is made evident in the play, as she threatens the girls with physical violence and âsmashes Betty across the faceâ in an effort to silence her. Despite this, Miller makes clear that Abigail is a victim of psychological trauma, as she is revealed to have borne witness to the violent death of her parents - partly explaining her disturbed and devious nature.Â\n\nMary WarrenÂ\n\nMary Warren is a sullen, sensitive and easily manipulated servant of the Proctor household. Her volatile nature makes her an easy target for Abigail, who manipulates her into betraying the Proctors by planting a poppet in Elizabethâs room, which ultimately becomes the leading evidence in her sentencing. Mary is a symbol of mass hysteria, as her easily exploitable nature and weakness in spirit represent the irrationality of those who are quick to believe rumours, such as the persecutors of the Salem witch hunts, as well as the accusers of the McCarthy era.Â\n\nSusanna Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Betty Parris\n\nReferred to as âthe girlsâ throughout the play, these young individuals are manipulated by Abigail to falsely convict Elizabeth and numerous others as practicers of witchcraft. All of these girls possess a common fear of Abigail, and carry out her orders in an attempt to evade their own punishment at her hands. Thus, Miller uses them to emphasise his allegory of the McCarthy trials, in which numerous people accused others of Communism based on their own fear of being charged by the Court.Â\n\nThemes\n\nMass Hysteria\n\nMass hysteria is one of the most significant themes of the play, as Miller depicts the entire town of Salem engulfed by the superstition of witchcraft and devil-worship. The community-wide fear of consorting with the devil is shown to overwhelm any kind of rational thought. As one rumour created by Abigail and the girls leads to dozens of incarcerations and executions in a matter of days, The Crucible depicts the âperverse manifestation of panicâ that can occur from unsubstantiated fear. Miller uses this illustration of hysteria to show the effects of a strictly repressive Puritan society. Although some residents of Salem manipulate the witch hunt for their own benefit, such as Abigail, the majority of the townspeople are launched into the terror-fuelled âfeverâ by their genuine belief that the devil is running amok in Salem. The strict theocracy of the town thus exacerbates the crisis, as joining the accusatory crowd becomes a religious necessity; a virtuous âplane of heavenly combat between Lucifer and the Lordâ. As such, the play demonstrates how uncontrolled religious fervour can lead to the collective indoctrination of âblack mischiefâ, where panic clouds all reason.Â\n\nJudgement\n\nJudgement in The Crucible encompasses three meanings; the legal, personal, and spiritual. The legal judgement in the play is depicted as superficial - mainly illustrated through the characters of Hathorne and Danforth, the theocratical Salem court does not carry out real justice due to its dogmatic focus on its reputation. This is depicted by Danforthâs stubborn refusal to free the innocents accused, due to his belief that it would lead to a tainted esteem of the court. Thus, Miller suggests that the more important judgement is personal - exemplified by the character of Proctor. Believing himself to be a âsinnerâ against his own âversion of moral conductâ, Proctor throughout the play shows limitless remorse and self-hatred for the hurt he has caused Elizabeth by his affair with Abigail. Miller shows the importance of forgiveness through self-judgement, as Elizabeth assures Proctor that there is âno higher judge under Heavenâ than Proctor himself, and he ultimately is able to forgive himself and see the âshred of goodnessâ within him by the end of the play. Furthermore, The Crucible depicts the town of Salem overcome by the fear of Godâs judgement, or what Proctor calls âGodâs icy windâ. The events of the play unfold due to the townâs collective fear of the higher power of an âAlmighty Godâ. As Hale proclaims, âBefore the laws of God we are as swine!â, Miller showcases the extent of the fearsome âpower of theocracyâ in circumstances of confusion and hysteria.\n\nAccusation\n\nThe events of the Salem witch trials detail various types of accusation. Although all are disguised as the dispelling of witchcraft, the false allegations depicted in the play are carried out with a range of different motives. For example, Abigailâs accusation of Elizabeth as a witch is described to derive from a âwhoreâs vengeanceâ due to her passionate jealousy of Elizabethâs position as Proctorâs wife, and Abigailâs wish to take her place. Similarly, Rebecca Nurseâs charge of âmurdering Goody Putnamâs babiesâ is due to the Putnamsâ resentment and jealousy of her numerous children, while they themselves have lost babies âbefore they could be baptisedâ.Â In contrast to this, the accusation of Martha Corey, Giles' wife, of witchcraft is motivated by Walcottâs desire for revenge, as he resents her for the unhealthy âpig he bought from her five years agoâ. Thus, his actions are calculative rather than passionate - a cruel attempt to get âhis money backâ. In his employment of the play as a historical allegory, this depiction of the blind following of rampant accusations depicted in The Crucible represents the similarly irrational proceedings of the McCarthy trials, many of which were carried out without substantial evidence.Â\n\nHonour and Integrity\n\nHonour is one of the most prominent themes in the play, as the majority of the characters strive to maintain their reputations in society. Miller depicts a community in which private and public characters are one and the same, and the consequences of the obsessive desire to uphold the esteem of their name. For example, although Proctor has the chance to undermine the girlsâ accusations by revealing Abigail as a âwhoreâ, he does not do so in order to protect his good name from being tarnished. Likewise, Parris at the beginning of the play threatens Abigail and the girls due to his fear that hints of witchcraft will threaten his already precarious reputation in the church and banish him from the pulpit. Furthermore, the judges of Salem do not accept any evidence that could free the innocent accused, as they uphold a false reputation to honour the Puritan church. Despite this, Miller shows the importance of prioritising personal honour over public reputation through the character of Proctor. As he ultimately makes the valiant decision in Act IV to refrain from âsigning liesâ and thus uphold his name, he is able to redeem himself from his previous sins and is able to die with righteousness.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nSymbols and Motifs\n\nThe Crucible\n\nA crucible is a ceramic or metal container in which metals, chemicals or other substances may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures. As such, Miller in the play employs the violent imagery of a crucible to symbolise the severe and challenging test of the Salem witch hunts. As spoken by Danforth in Act III, âWe burn a hot fire in here; it melts down all concealmentâ, the motif of the crucible represents the merciless nature of both the Salem and McCarthy court proceedings, and their dogged determination to convict, despite the lack of substantial evidence. Crucibles are often used for the chemical process of calcination, during which particles are heated to high temperatures in order to purify them - removing any volatile substances from the compound. As such, Miller also suggests that societal challenges such as those depicted in the play can lead to situations in which the good can be separated from the evil; as the town is split into those who are âwith this court orâ¦against itâ, the witch hunts illustrate the distinction between the individuals who possesses moral integrity and those who manipulate the situation for their selfish pursuits.Â\n\nThe Poppet\n\nIn Act III, Abigail and the girls plant a poppet, or doll, in Elizabethâs house, in an attempt to frame her as an individual guilty of witchcraft. As Abigail stabs the doll with a needle in its stomach before leaving it on Elizabethâs shelf, she is able to pretend that her own stomach is injured from Elizabethâs practice of voodoo with it. The poppet is a symbol of childhood and girlhood, and the playâs depiction of it as a tool for malicious revenge represents the loss of innocence and pretence that arises out of the witch hunts. Miller illustrates the danger of mass hysteria, as he depicts the young group of girls, led by Abigail, become manipulated into condemning innocent townspeople to death; thereby losing their innocence and moral virtue. The poppet is also employed as a symbol of deception, as it emphasises the fact that the Salem persecutions are based on lies and falsehood. As the court ignores Elizabethâs outraged protests that she has not kept a poppet since she was a little girl, Miller chastises a justice system which values convenient deceit over the cumbersome truth.Â\n\nPaper\n\nAlthough traditionally associated with knowledge and truth, the motif of paper in the play symbolises morality and individualism. Paper first appears in the play as the judicial list naming the condemned, then as a document of proof outlining Proctorâs alleged crimes as a practicer of witchcraft and agent of the devil. As such, paper initially symbolises the false accusations that run rampant in Salem, and the destructive consequences of such on the lives of the accused innocents. This idea is furthered by Millerâs depiction of the signed, âseventy-two death warrantsâ of innocents, illustrating paper as a symbol of the unjust punishment and corruption within the Salem court. It is only when Proctor refuses to sign the testimony or have his false confession âposted on the church doorâ, that the symbol of paper begins to serve as a motif of heroism. As Proctor ultimately refuses to âsign [his] name to liesâ, then âtears the paper and crumplesâ the document denouncing him as a devil-consorter in Act IV, Miller portrays paper as a mode for personal redemption in the face of blind injustice. This advocating for personal salvation is supported by the character of Hale, who undergoes a similar transformation. Although initially described as an intellectual whose paper âbooks are weighted with authorityâ, this religious authority loses its value throughout the tragic events of the play, as the injustices of the court lead him to lose his âgreat faithâ in God. Ultimately, like Proctor, Hale is only able to gain personal redemption through his realisation of the immoral nature of the court and his attempts (albeit unrealised) to save the remaining incarcerated innocents from the fate of the gallows.\n\nQuote Analysis\n\nAct I\n\n\"There are wheels within wheels in this village, and fires within fires!â\n\nAnn Putnam speaks this line when she admits to interrogating Tituba about the possibility of witchcraft having caused the early deaths of her seven infants. The audience can perceive her hysteria, as she begins to fear that the rumours of devil worship in Salem may be true, and that she may also lose her last surviving child, Ruth. Her sense of paranoia works to foreshadow the mass hysteria that is to overwhelm the town. This quote is also a direct reference to the prophet Ezekiel in the Bible, who compares his vision of God in his chariot to a gyroscope - an instrument of stability and balance. As such, Mrs. Putnamâs allusion to God is a direct reference to the rigidity of the Puritan values in Salem, disguised as a creed of âunityâ, when in reality itâs the root cause of social paranoia and resentment. The quote also illustrates that she believes that there are more complex and intricate forces present in Salem - the âdeep and darkling forcesâ as described by Miller - which work to determine the fates of the townspeople. Combined with its fire imagery, this quote effectively foreshadows the drama that will unfold in the Salem court, in which Abigail and the girls will invent invisible spiritual forces to accuse innocents, in a court of âhot fireâ, acting to âmelt down all concealmentâ.Â\n\nâWe cannot look to superstition in this. The Devil is precise; the marks of his presence are as definite as stone.âÂ\n\nHale says this to Parris when he first arrives in Salem from Beverley, after he is asked to inspect Betty for signs of witchcraft or possession by the devil. Although Parris is already convinced by the rampant rumours in the town of the existence of the devil and its effect on his daughter, Hale (being a professional âinvestigator of witchcraftâ) is more meticulous in his examination of such a âstrange crisisâ. By calling the devil âpreciseâ, Hale depicts his true and unflinching belief in its existence, representing the inflexible Puritan mindset. This quote is integral to understanding Hale as a character, and thus the nature of his disillusionment later in the play, as it reveals that Hale does not believe in witchcraft due to the mass hysteria and paranoia of the town, but because he possesses genuine and resolute faith in every word of the Bible. As this faith is shown to âbring bloodâ later in the play, Miller displays the dangerous âpower of theocracyâ, as the audience perceives Hale becoming radically disillusioned in his religion and world view.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. âFor twenty week he preach nothinâ but golden candlesticks til he had them!â Are the leaders of the community misguided in The Crucible?

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Essay Prompt: In a theocracy, law and religion are bound together. What are the benefits and challenges of this depicted in The Crucible?Â\n\nStep 1: AnalyseÂ\n\nHere, we are asked to examine the benefits and challenges of a theocratic system, as depicted in The Crucible. Thus, we must consider both the positive and negative aspects of the binding of law and religion. It is a good idea to delegate two paragraphs to the challenges and one to the benefits, due to the fact that Miller wrote the play with the authorial intention of denouncing the repressive rigidity of its government - this means it is easier to think of negatives rather than positives.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs break down the term âtheocracyâ, as this is the focus of this essay topic. The play shows us various effects of such a system, but what does it actually mean? A theocracy is a form of government in which a religion (in this case, Puritanism) is recognised as the supreme ruling authority. Thus, as mentioned in the essay question, in a theocracy the rules of religion are treated as the law. Now, think of some of the words, phrases or key ideas you think of when you conjure up Salemâs version of theocracy. This may include:\n\nStrictness of Puritan values\n\nUnity vs. individualism\n\nExploitation of the name of the church for personal gainsÂ\n\nSocietal repression\n\nSuperfluous power given to the court\n\nOpportunity for individuals to reformÂ\n\nSocial vs. individual redemption\n\nDisillusionment\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWhen planning an essay, it is easy to let yourself go off track, discussing another point that is not quite relevant to the topic given. To prevent this from happening, always keep the topic firmly in your mind - glance at it periodically throughout your planning if needed, and check that every body paragraph that you are planning directly relates back to the topic and answers what it is asking. So, keeping the topic and its focus on theocracy firmly in mind, I chose to approach this essay with the following structured plan:Â\n\nParagraph 1: The Salem theocracy leads to the unjust exercise of power, resulting in a tragedy.Â\n\nHere, our focus is on the overarching injustices that the theocratic nature of the government allows to occur.Â\n\nFocus on the fact that it is because religion is the law, that the crime of witchcraft (believed to be a crime against God) is so severely punished (by death!).Â\n\nAlso discuss that it is due to the rigidity of the theocracy that any slight divergence from a complete adherence to Puritanism is perceived as a crime.Â\n\nExamples of this include the witch hunt itself, and the victimisation of innocents who are condemned to be executed for crimes that they did not commit.Â\n\nParagraph 2: The townâs theocratic belief in God is exploited by individuals who use it for their own personal gain.\n\nOur job here is to highlight the selfish natures of certain individuals, who take advantage of the townspeopleâs theocratic mindsets to utilise the townâs mass hysteria for their own motives.Â\n\nExamples of such characters include Abigail and Parris, who participate in the witch hunt out of vengeance and fear respectively.\n\nParagraph 3: However, the theocratic nature of the government allows opportunity for reform, and the ability to distinguish between morality and immorality.\n\nHere we are discussing the benefit that arises out of the theocracy, namely the idea that the tragedy that results from such allow certain individuals to be enlightened and reformed.\n\nEmphasise the fact that the theocracy does lead to disastrous effects, but it is from this hardship that we are able to distinguish the characters of good from the characters of evil.Â\n\nAn example of a character who undergoes reform is Hale, who becomes simultaneously disillusioned and enlightened by the tragedy of the Salem persecution.\n\nAn example of an individual revealed by the events of the play to be ultimately immoral is Danforth, who refuses to change and reform, despite realising the injustice and cruelty of his actions.Â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Crucible Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

So, weâre going to take a broad look at: Shakespeareâs historical context, his language, and of course, what this means for interpreting his plays. Since Shakespeare has so many plays chances are your text will be excluded. Instead Iâm going to use Othello as a case study.\n\nBefore you start reading, LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response is a must-read for anybody studying VCE English.\n\nBackground\n\nOthello follows the Moorish general Othello and his relationship with his wife, Desdemona. The antagonist Iago is jealous that Cassio was made Lieutenant instead of him, and seeks vengeance on Othello. Iago attempts to destroy Othelloâs reputation, and uses the rich but foolish Roderigo to fund his revenge plot. Through careful manipulation of his Wife Emilia, Roderigo, Cassio, and Othello, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona is unfaithful, sending him into an obsessive jealousy. When Emilia steals Desdemonaâs handkerchief, a token of Othelloâs love, and Desdemona cannot produce it, Othello believes he has all the information necessary to condemn Desdemona. He smothers her to death, before Emilia reveals Iagoâs involvement. Othello, struck by regret, stabs himself, declaring that he âloved not wisely but too wellâ\n\nContext\n\nSo who is this Shakespeare guy? And more importantly, what kind of a world did he live in?\n\nShakespeare was born in England in 1564, in the middle of the Renaissance Period. This period of ârebirthâ was categorised by the increasing reliance on ancient classical authors for information about the world. This is why Shakespeare plots are famously reinterpretations of Ancient histories and Roman plays. Changes in education resulted in the Elizabethan moral and social customs being questioned. This included the Divine Right of Kings, and notions of gender and identity.\n\nReligion is also significant in this period, and the Protestant Reformation is a subject often alluded to by Shakespeare. It is necessary to contextualise Shakespeare within the Renaissance period, because as you will see, themes, words, and references that make very little sense to us were common knowledge in Shakespeareâs time, and understanding them boosts our appreciation of his work.\n\nThe context and intent of the author are important considerations when studying VCE English or Literature. For more on this, read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\nThe Language\n\nNow that we understand when Shakespeare was writing, letâs look at how.\n\nStarting as broadly as possible, Shakespeareâs difficult-to-read language is actually Early-Modern English, and so many words Shakespeare used are either lost or unused in modern English. Any good copy of Shakespeare will have definitions of these words in the margin or opposite page.\n\nMoving in closer, we have the two types of plays, Tragedy and Comedy.\n\nComedy is tonally more light-hearted, and has an apparently happy-ending. These are Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, or As You Like It among others. Despite being made to entertain, they are rarely unsophisticated, and the genre may mask something more sinister. For example, the character of Malvolio in Twelfth Night is entertaining and presented as self-obsessed, but could be used as an example of Shakespeare critiquing masculinity in Elizabethan society, as Malvolio feels entitled to Oliviaâs affections.\n\nTragedies cannot be defined by their tone, however. They are defined by a tragic hero, who has a fatal flaw or Hamartia that results in their downfall. This may be Othelloâs Jealousy, Macbethâs ambition, or Brutusâ naivety in Julius Caesar. These traits all cause the tragic heroesâ demise, as their hamartia leads them to make bad decisions or fail to address the real evil. Tragedies will usually end in the unnecessary loss of lives and an unhappy ending for all involved. Most of Shakespeareâs plays fit into tragedy, including most of those based on historical figures. An analysis considering the conventions of Tragedy--like hamartia and tragic heroes--is a great way to stand out when discussing Shakespeare, and so when interpreting a tragedy you should consider what about it is tragic. For example, is Othello a tragedy because Iago is able to manipulate Othello, or is Othelloâs jealousy and mistrust ever-present? Either of these options reveals Othello to be a tragedy, however they both say different things about the characters and plot. If Iago manipulates Othello, the tragedy is because a fundamental good person is corrupted. However if Othello was always mistrusting, the play becomes tragic as the audience must watch an unloving marriage slowly dissolve.\n\nNext, we have the two ways Shakespeare formats his dialogue. Students will often focus on what the characters say without considering how it is said. Knowing the difference between Verse and Prose and how they are used is an easy way to stand out in an essay.\n\nVerse is essentially poetry, where one line follows another. It can rhyme, but often doesnât. What Shakespeare verse will ALWAYS do, however, is follow the Iambic Pentameter. This is a line of poetry with 10 syllables where every second syllable is stressed. This creates a kind of bounce or flow like a heartbeat. The easiest way to recognise this is to count the syllables in each line: thus / do / i / ev / er / make / my / fool / my / purse. Pay attention to when it is not followed, or when characters are interrupted during the pentameter. When the pentameter is interrupted by another character, look at who is interrupting it. It is likely to reveal a power dynamic between the two characters. Alternatively, a character finishing the pentameter, literally finishing their sentence, could be a symbol of love or affection between them. Using linguistic devices like the iambic pentameter as evidence shows an understanding of the text beyond the words spoken\n\nThe alternative format is prose. Itâs used quite sparingly so look out for it. Is the way we speak normally in conversation, or how a normal novel is written. You can tell a character is speaking in prose as itâs usually just a big chunk of text. Shakespeareâs prose can reveal different things, so it depends on the context and the character using it. In act 1 scene 3 of Othello, Iago speaks to Roderigo in prose and then transitions to verse once Roderigo leaves. This displays Iagoâs ability to code-switch and manipulate those around him with words. Prose is considered more simplistic, so in order to control Roderigo, who is presented as quite dumb, Iago relies on simple language, bringing himself to Roderigoâs level. This is directly contrasted with Iagoâs use of the complex verse form, which he uses at all other times.\n\nInterpreting Shakespeare\n\nWeâve now covered Shakespeareâs historical context, his play styles, and his dialogue, but what should we look for when reading Shakespeare that allows us to use this information in a text response or close passage analysis. Iâve already given some examples of how Shakespeareâs language is relevant to his themes, but Iâm going to give a rough guide of what themes are common in Shakespeareâs plays, and how they are shown in the language.\n\nFate versus free-will\n\nThis is a theme that can lead to a long discussion and gives you the opportunity to express your own opinion. Are the characters acting with free-will, or is some other force impacting their fate? This isnât really in Othello, so letâs look quickly at Macbeth; if we consider fate versus free-will with the characteristics of a tragedy in mind, then the tragic hero must act freely even though his âfatal flawâ will lead to his demise. However, the inclusion of the witches in Macbeth subverts the tragic structure and implies Macbeth is being toyed with. Even though Macbeth believes he is in control his fate is met, so is it a coincidence that his decisions fulfill his fate, or was the Witchesâ prophecy real?\n\nAppearance versus reality\n\nThe different uses of verse and prose are a good way to show when characters are genuine or performing for others. I have already mentioned how Iago âcode-switchesâ by using prose to speak to Roderigo, appearing simple and âlaid-back,â but his revelatory soliloquy in verse displays his true nature, both in the content of the speech, and the way it is presented.\n\nOrder and disorder\n\nIn Othello, disorder could be represented by Iago, destabilising the lives of those around him through his use of rhetoric and manipulation. Order is then returned when Iago is revealed and Othello takes his life, recognising himself as tragically misused. Analysing the theme of order and disorder would support the interpretation that Othello is a good man controlled and abused by disorder and manipulation.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, hopefully this very brief introduction helps you get into Shakespeare! Even if I didnât cover your text, the use of tragic heroes, prose, verse, and iambic pentameter are things evident in all Shakespeare plays, so you just have to make it relevant to your text. And remember that in order to read Shakespeare, one must first read Shakespeare. It may take several readings or viewings to grasp what is happening in the play, only after that can you start to analyse in the way I have today.\n\nContents\n\nSummary\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThemes\n\nCinematography\n\nKey Symbols\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nResources\n\nRear Window is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Summary\n\nWhen most people think of Hitchcock, itâs the screeching violins fromÂ PsychoÂ that first come to mind. Whilst he is indeed known for his hair-curling thrillers,Â Rear WindowÂ is a slightly subtler film which focuses not on a murderer at large, but rather a crippled photographer who never even leaves his apartment.\n\nOur protagonist L.B. âJeffâ Jefferies is portrayed by James Stewart, who was known at the time for portraying cowboys in various Western films as well as starring in an earlier Hitchcock filmÂ Rope. After breaking his leg after a racing accident, Jeff begins to spy on his neighbours, one of whom he suspects of having committed a murder.\n\nDespite some initial misgivings, his insurance nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and lover Lisa (Grace Kelly) also come to share his suspicions and participate in his spying. Their contributions ultimately allow the mystery to be solved.\n\nIntertwined with this mystery is also the rather complex story of Jeff and Lisaâs relationship. Jeff on one hand resembles the âmachoâ men of action whom Stewart is very accustomed to playing. On the other hand, Kelly portrays a character much like herself, a refined and elegant urbanite whose lifestyle inherently clashes with that of an action photographer.\n\nHitchcock ultimately resolves both of these storylines in the filmâs denouement.\n\n2. Historial Context\n\nBefore getting into the nitty-gritty of the film, it is crucial to understand a bit about its historical context. As with any other text, the social conditions at the time ofÂ Rear Windowâs release in 1954 inform and shape the interactions and events of the film.\n\nReleased in theÂ post-war period, the film is undoubtedly characterised by the interpersonal suspicion which defined the era. In particular, there was a real fear in America of Communist influences and Soviet espionage - so much so that a tribunal was established, supposedly to weed out Communists despite a general lack of evidence. This practice of making accusations without such evidence is now known as the McCarthyism, named after the senator behind the tribunal.\n\nThe film undoubtedly carries undertones of this, particularly in Jeffâs disregard for his neighboursâ privacy and his unparalleled ability to jump to conclusions about them. During this era, people really did fear one another, since the threat of Communism felt so widespread. Jeffâs exaggerated interpretations of his neighboursâ actions lead him to an irrational sense of suspicion, which is in many way the basis of the entire film.\n\nAt the same time, the 1950s saw aÂ boom in photojournalismÂ as a legitimate profession. To some extent, this was fuelled by the heyday ofÂ LifeÂ magazine (an American weekly, as well-known then asÂ TimeÂ magazine is today). This publication was almost entirely photojournalistic, and one of their war photojournalists, Robert Capa, is actually the basis of Jeffâs character. This explains the prevalence of cameras in his life, as well as his ability to emotionally distance himself from those whom he observes through the lens.\n\nAnother crucial historical element isÂ the institution of marriage, and how important it was to people during the 1950s. It was an aspiration which everyone was expected to have, and this is reflected statistically - only 9.3% of homes then had single occupants (as opposed to around 25% today). People also tended to marry at a younger age, generally in their early 20s.\n\nConversely, divorce was highly frowned upon, and once you were married, you would in general remain married for the rest of your life. In particular, divorced women suffered massive financial difficulties, since men, as breadwinners, held higher-paying jobs, and women were only employed in traditionally female roles (e.g. secretaries, nurses, teachers, librarians). Seen in this light, we can understand Lisaâs overwhelming desire to marry and settle down with Jeff. The importance of marriage is also evident in the lives of Jeffâs neighbours; Miss Torsoâs 'juggling [of the] wolves', and Miss Lonelyheartâs depression both reflect this idea.\n\n3. Themes\n\nCombining a basic understanding of the filmâs plot, as well as our knowledge of its history, we can begin to analyse some of the themes that emerge.\n\nPossibly the central tenet of the film is the big question ofÂ privacy. Even in todayâs society, the sanctity of privacy is an important concept; every individual has a right to make their own choices without having to disclose, explain or justify all of them. The character of Doyle says almost these exact words:Â\n\n'Thatâs a secret and private world youâre looking into out there. People do a lot of things in private that they couldnât possibly explain in public'\n\nThe tension that Hitchcock draws upon is this other idea of public responsibility, or civic duty - that is, the need to uphold the peace and protect oneâs fellow citizens from harm. These ideas clash inÂ Rear Window, as fulfilling this civic responsibility (which for Jeff means privately investigating Thorwald) means that Thorwaldâs right to privacy gets totally thrown out the window. So to speak.\n\nEvidently, this is a majorÂ moral dilemma. If you suspect that someone has committed murder, does this give you the right to disregard their privacy and surveil them in this way? While the film doesnât give a definite answer (and you wonât be required to give a definite answer), Hitchcock undoubtedly explores the complexity of this question. Even Jeff has misgivings about what heâs seeing:Â\n\nÂ 'Do you suppose itâs ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long-focus lensâuntil you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail? Do you suppose itâs ethical even if you prove he didnât commit a crime?'\n\nIn some ways, the audience is also positioned to reflect on this question, and in particular, reflect on the paranoia that characterised and defined the McCarthy era.\n\nSomewhat separate to these questions is theÂ romanceÂ between Jeff and Lisa, since Hitchcock seems to keep the thriller storyline and the romance storyline separate for a large part of the film. Their contrasting lifestyles and world views present a major obstacle in the fulfilment of their romance, and the murder mystery both distracts and unites them. Hitchcock further alludes to the question of whether marriage will be able to settle those differences after all - a major example is the following scene, in which Lisa not only reveals her discovery of Mrs Thorwaldâs ring, but also expresses a desire for Jeff to âput a ring on itâ as well:\n\n4. Cinematography\n\nItâs impossible to study a Hitchcock film without considering how he impacted and manipulated its storytelling. The cinematographic techniques employed inÂ Rear WindowÂ are important ways of shaping our understanding of the film, and Hitchcock uses a wide array of visual cues to communicate certain messages.\n\nLightingÂ is one such cue that he uses a lot - it is said that at certain points in filming, he had used every single light owned by the studio in which this film was shot. In this film, lighting is used to reveal things: when the lights are on in any given apartment, Jeff is able to peer inside and watch through the window (almost resembling a little TV screen; Jeff is also able to channel surf through the various apartments - Hitchcock uses panning to show this).\n\nOn the contrary, a lack of lighting is also used to hide things, and we see Thorwald utilise this at many stages in the film. Jeff also takes advantage of this, as he often sits in a position where he is very close to being in the shadows himself; if he feels the need, he is able to retreat such that he is fully enshrouded. Low-key lighting in these scenes also contributes to an overall sense of drama and tension.\n\nAnother handy visual cue is theÂ cross-cut, which is an example of theÂ Kuleshov effect. The Kuleshov effect is an editing technique whereby a sequence of two shots is used to convey information more effectively than just a single shot. Specifically, the cross-cut shifts from a shot of a person to a second shot of something that this person is watching.\n\nWe see this often, particularly when Jeff is responding to events in the courtyard; Hitchcock uses this cross-cut to immediately show us what has caused Jeffâs response. This visual cue indicates to viewers that we are seeing what Jeff is seeing, and is one of the few ways that Hitchcock helps audiences assume Jeffâs point-of-view in key moments.\n\nSimilarly, Hitchcock also usesÂ photographic vignettingÂ to merge our perspectives with Jeffâs - in certain shots, we see a fade in clarity and colour towards the sides of a frame, and this can look like a circular shadow, indicating to us that we are seeing something through a telescope or a long-focus lens.\n\nInterestingly, a vignette is also a short, descriptive scene that focuses on a certain character and/or idea to provide us with insights about them - in this sense, itâs also possible to say that Jeff watches vignettes of his neighbours. Since this word has two meanings, you must be careful about which meaning youâre referring to.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\n5. Key Symbols\n\nAs with any other text, itâs important to consider some of the key symbols that Hitchcock draws upon in order to tell his story. That being said, one of the benefits of studying a film is that these symbols tend to be quite visual - you are able to see these recurring images and this may make them easier to spot. Weâll be going through some of these key images in the final part of this guide.\n\nOne of the first symbols we see isÂ Jeffâs broken leg, which is propped up and completely covered by a cast, useless for the time being. Because he has been rendered immobile by his leg, readers can infer from this symbol that he is also incapable of working or even leaving his apartment, let alone solving a murder mystery. The broken leg is in this sense a symbol of his powerlessness and the source of much of his discontent.\n\nAnother interpretation of the broken leg however, is that it represents his impotence which on one hand is synonymous for powerlessness or helplessness, but is on the other hand an allusion to his apparent inability to feel sexual desire. Being constantly distracted from Lisa by other goings-on in the courtyard definitely supports this theory. All in all, Jeffâs broken leg represents some compromise of his manhood, both in the sense that he cannot work in the way that a man would have been expected to, but also in the sense that he is unable to feel any attraction towards Lisa, even as she tries her best to seduce him.\n\nConversely, JeffâsÂ long-focus camera lensÂ is a symbol of his passive male gaze, which is more or less the only thing he can do in his condition. It is the main means through which he observes other people, and thus, it also symbolises his voyeuristic tendencies - just as his broken leg traps and inhibits him, his camera lens transports him out of his own apartment and allows him to project his own fears and insecurities into the apartments of his neighbours, watching them for entertainment, for visual pleasure.\n\nIn this latter sense, the camera lens can also be understood as a phallic symbol, an erection of sorts. It highlights Jeffâs perverted nature, and the pleasure he derives from the act of observing others. Yikes.\n\nOn the other hand,Â Lisaâs dressesÂ underscore the more positive parts of her character. Her initial wardrobe represents her elegance and refinery whilst also communicating a degree of incompatibility with Jeff. However, as she changes and compromises throughout the film, her wardrobe also becomes much more practical and much less ostentatious as the film wears on, until she is finally wearing a smart blouse, jeans and a pair of loafers. The change in her wardrobe reflects changes in her character as well.\n\nFinally,Â the wedding ring of Mrs ThorwaldÂ is hugely significant; wedding rings in general represent marriage and commitment, and are still very important symbols that people still wear today. Specifically, Mrs Thorwaldâs ring means a couple of things in the context of the film - it is firstly a crucial piece of evidence (because if Mrs Thorwald was still alive, she would probably still be wearing it) and it is also a symbol through which Lisa can express a desire for stability, commitment and for herself to be married.\n\nThereâs definitely plenty to talk about with HitchcockâsÂ Rear Window, and I hope these points of consideration help you tackle this film!\n\nTest your film technique knowledge with the video below:\n\nReady to start writing on Rear Window?

If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response because itâll dramatically enhance how much you can take away from the following essays and more importantly, your ability to apply this strategy in your own writing.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTHINK\n\nFilm technique-based prompt:\n\nHitchcockâs use of film techniques offers an unnerving viewing experience. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhile we should use film techniques as part of our evidence repertoire in each essay, this particular type of essay prompt literally begs for it. As such, Iâd ensure that my essay has a greater focus on film techniques (without concerning myself too much over inclusion of quotes; the film techniques will act as a replacement for the quotes).\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nSince the essay prompt is rather open-ended, it is up to us to decide which central themes and ideas weâd like to focus on.

More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you. (Just try not to overcook it, like I have done with this soup metaphor).

Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens s"
