        "text": "Dancer and dance teacher Dorene Richardson has lived in New York all her life – and in Hell’s Kitchen since the 1970s. Here, one of the original members of Alvin Ailey’s renowned dance company shares her West Side Story.\n\nSo, what’s your New York story? Born here, or just arrived?\n\nI was born at Manhattan Medical Center on 68th Street. Both of my parents were from the West Indies — my father was born in Antigua and my mother was born in St Kitts. They came over to the US when they were young adults. My mother went to night school at Barnard College to become an accountant — she was the only black woman in the class — and worked for the IRS. My father was a carpenter and worked for a company that made instrument cases. He used to bring home some of his work and I’d be fascinated just watching a piece of wood grow into a violin case with velvet lining and leather exterior.\n\nMy mother was determined to send me to private school, so at age nine I attended the Walden School on 88th Street next to Central Park. It was a very progressive and interracial school. I think it’s very important that kids are exposed to other races and having that diversity, especially at a young age.\n\nWhat’s your favorite New York minute (or moment) so far?\n\nThe gym teacher at Walden started a dance club. One afternoon she took us to see a matinee performance by Martha Graham. All along, up to that point, I wanted to be a doctor. When I came home, I said to my mother, “Mom, I know what I want to do. I want to be a dancer, like the Graham Company that I saw this afternoon.” My grandmother was stunned. I was 12 years old and my grandmother said, “You’re giving up medicine to kick your legs?!”\n\nThat same gym teacher took me to my first dance class at the New Dance Group on W47th Street between 8th and Broadway on Saturdays. The teacher at the beginner class said I was very good and could skip right up to the intermediate class that took place on weekdays. We lived in Harlem on 129th between 7th and 8th Avenue, so it was convenient enough for me to get there on the number 10 bus.\n\nI ended up teaching at the New Dance Group for 30 years. It’s sort of like a movie, because I started taking classes there as a teenager and then ended up teaching at that same place. I was even on the board of directors at one point!\n\nWhat was your first job? What do you do now?\n\nAs I continued studying at the New Dance Group, one of the teachers couldn’t make it to class one day. The school administrator came to me and said, “Dorene, I want you to teach the class.” At first I was shocked, but the administrator said since I took the class all the time I knew what the teacher gives. It ended up being a huge success and the director put me on the schedule as a teacher for the next term. That’s how my teaching career began.\n\nOne day, I was teaching a class and this guy was standing at the door with a big smile on his face — it was Alvin Ailey. I had seen him perform when he came to New York with the Lester Horton Dance Theater. He had this attitude, this full commitment to whatever role he was doing. At the end of the class he came up to me and said, “Oh, you teach a great class. I’m Alvin Ailey.” He asked about classes and said he was thinking about moving to New York. Alvin took some of my classes and then went back to California.\n\nChristyne Lawson, another dancer who I attended Juilliard with, also lived in California and asked me to come out and visit. I stayed with her for five weeks. One afternoon she said, “Let’s call Alvin and go to the beach!” She had known him since high school. So the three of us went to the beach and we were sitting there when all of a sudden Alvin said, “I’m going to start a company in New York. There are too many black dancers that are fabulous that don’t have the opportunity to perform. I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna give them that opportunity.”\n\nThis was after he had already performed in a few shows on Broadway like House of Flowers and Jamaica (with fellow Hell’s Kitchen resident Nat Horne), so he knew a lot of the black dancers. Alvin said, “When I start the company, I want the two of you to be in it.” So we said OK, we didn’t take it too seriously. At the end of the year, he called and said, “Dorene, rehearsal is Monday, can you come?” — of course I said yes.\n\nRehearsals took place at Michael’s Studio on 47th and 8th, a famous studio rental for dancers. Though the stairs were rickety, the prices were cheap and you had all kinds of dancers working there — tap, flamenco, ballroom. This is where Alvin started working on Blues Suite which debuted at the 92nd Street Y on March 30, 1958.\n\nAnother show I performed in with Alvin was Revelations, which also debuted at the Kaufman Concert Hall of the 92nd Street Y in 1960. When the curtain came down after the performance there was dead silence. We turned to each other and said, “I guess they didn’t like it.” Usually there is at least some clapping. When the curtain came back up, everyone was standing and screaming. I couldn’t believe the reaction, because it was so crazy and it had never really happened before. The director at the Y came out and said this performance will be repeated next Sunday — another shock. Usually these performances were a one time thing. Revelations has continued to be performed for the past 64 years! If you haven’t seen it yet, what are you waiting for?\n\nShare with us how you ended up in Hell’s Kitchen\n\nI met somebody who knew somebody who told me about Manhattan Plaza. I received a card in the mail from Actor’s Equity, who was trying to get as many artists as possible into the building. This was in early 1977, before the building opened. I was living in the Bronx with my parents at the time and my friend told me I should try to get in since I was teaching at the New Dance Group just a few blocks away and commuting down every day for classes and rehearsals.\n\nSo I applied, but didn’t hear anything for a while and I figured I just wasn’t qualified. That same friend told me I was overqualified since I had never done anything but dance and teach — there must have been a mistake. I called and made an appointment with Rodney Kirk, who was the director at the time. When he looked at my application, it turned out that they made a miscalculation with my bank account. Once it was readjusted, I was finally qualified.\n\nAt that time, if you were by yourself, you only got a studio. By the time they fixed my application error there were no more studios left so I was able to move into a one-bedroom apartment. I’ve lived in the same apartment ever since, which is only the third place I’ve lived in my entire life!\n\nBack when I moved to Hell’s Kitchen in the late 70s, people used to say, “Oh you don’t want to live down there, the hookers!” But they didn’t bother you. I’d pass by and they would say, “Hi honey!” That was it — they weren’t going to mug you or kill you. Now it’s bad, with those illegal shops, they are everywhere. I don’t go out after dark unless I’m with someone.\n\nWhat’s your superpower or hidden talent?\n\nI very much take after my mother. When something isn’t right, I fight for it and for everyone who is in a similar situation. If more people would do it, we wouldn’t be in such a mess that this country is in now.\n\nPeople have always said, “Oh Dorene, you’re too direct!” and I respond that I’m not direct, I’m just truthful, but they take it as a negative. But that’s why I was so good at teaching, because I would correct in a kind of nice way and they learned, you know? They took the criticism and worked with it. I’ve always been “take it or leave it, that’s me.” You like it, good? You don’t like it, too bad…\n\nWhat else should we know about you?\n\nI had a companion for 40 years, but we never lived together. We were both only children so we never had any siblings running around when we were growing up. He studied electrical engineering at City College but then he became a sound engineer at a film studio. Unfortunately he passed away about four years ago from brain cancer. He was a lovely, wonderful person.\n\nDorene’s Favorite Hell’s Kitchen Places\n\nWest Bank Cafe — 407 W42nd St (bw 9/10th Ave)\n\nI used to go there every Friday with a friend. We just enjoyed the place because it was so welcoming and homey. People are very friendly.\n\nChez Josephine — 414 W42nd St (bw 9/10th Ave)\n\nI love Josephine’s, it’s a nice treat. I have a neighbor who plays piano there at lunchtime, and I will go watch her and chat with her on her break.\n\nFruit Stand 43 — 593 9th Ave bw W42/43rd St\n\nIt’s always fun shopping there as Dave is always friendly and very generous. I’ve known him since he first set up shop 11 years ago.\n\nThe Marshal — 628 10th Ave (bw W44/45th St)\n\nThe food is fabulous and it’s a cute place. I go there for the ribs.\n\nTarget — 615 10th Ave (corner W44th St)\n\nMy favorite store! I go at least twice a week, but they took away the price match unless you have a cell phone! When I found out, I complained to the manager. I was truly my mother’s daughter that day when I told them not everybody in the world has a phone — what about the senior citizens?"
