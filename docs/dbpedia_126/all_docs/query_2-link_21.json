I think Sarah deserved several apologies, especially from her idiot sister. I don't blame Eddie and his mom needing someone to hate, but I completely do not understand Hannah's reaction. I think we should have seen their reconciliation. There was a brief line about Hannah disliking herself but that wasn't enough to me. Who the hell doesn't talk to their sister for TWO DECADES because their sister chose to save their life. No matter how mad I get at my sister we're never at odds more than 2 days, much less 2 whole goddamn decades. AND if we're gonna nitpick, I'd say Alex's death is Hannah's fault because she's the stupid one who ran off in a car with a stranger. She was 12, not 8. So I see Hannah as a very despicable person tbh.(less)\n\nKiala She got pregnant the week that Sarah and Eddie spent together when they first met.

She stayed at his house for like 7 days straight or something while her parents were taking care of her grandfather when she was visiting back in England for the anniversary of Alex's death. I guessed she was pregnant when she went back to American and talked about being so exhausted and not having an appetite, in my head I said I bet she is going to end up being pregnant. I think it was odd that she didn't let him know but he made it clear he didn't want to and couldn't have any kind of relationship with her. (less)"
