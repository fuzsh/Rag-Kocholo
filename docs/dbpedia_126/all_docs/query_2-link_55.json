        "text": "Forgive us for sounding like Monica from Friends, but sometimes all we need is a bit of organised fun. Whether that's a round of 'never have I ever' for your next prinks, a drinking game for the after party or even dinner party games for a (civilised?) evening. Or how about a good old fashioned game of truth or dare?\n\nHow to play Truth or Dare\n\nA standard Truth or Dare session typically involves you and your mates sitting in a circle, and in a clockwise motion, asking each player if they’d prefer to answer a truth question or do a dare. Once they've picked, either ask them a question to reveal a 'truth' about them, or dare they to do something else.\n\nIf they refuse to answer the question or do the dare, the player usually has to complete a forfeit. And surprise, surprise, it’s usually a shot of something *very* strong.\n\n*Disclaimer - if you’ve never played the infamous game before, it’s pretty straightforward - albeit it can get a little spicy if there’s booze involved - which of course, is optional.\n\nSo, whether you’re having a girly night in at the weekend and you want to ruffle some feathers, or you’re on a hen do and want your bridal party to get to know each other better, there’s nothing better - or more savage - than a classic game of truth or dare.\n\nAnd because it holds such a special place in our teenage house party hearts, we’ve compiled a list of our fave questions and dares (all 250 of them) that are sure to keep the party going alllllll night.\n\n*Please play responsibly\n\nBest truth questions\n\nWhen was the last time you lied?\n\nWhen was the last time you cried?\n\nWhat's your biggest fear?\n\nWhat's your biggest fantasy?\n\nWho's the last person you searched on Instagram?\n\nWhat's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?\n\nWhat's your relationship dealbreaker?\n\nWhat's a secret you've never told anyone?\n\nDo you have a hidden talent?\n\nWho was your first celebrity crush?\n\nHave you ever cheated in an exam?\n\nIf you were going to be on a reality TV show, which would it be?\n\nWhat's your biggest insecurity?\n\nWhat's the biggest mistake you've ever made?\n\nWhat's one thing you hate people knowing about you?\n\nWhat's the worst thing anyone's ever done to you?\n\nWhat's the best thing anyone's ever done for you?\n\nWhat's your worst habit?\n\nWhat's the biggest misconception about you?\n\nWhat's one thing you wish people knew about you?\n\nWhy did your last relationship break down?\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you've been given?\n\nWhat's the most you've spent on a night out?\n\nHave you ever returned or re-gifted a present?\n\nDo you have a favourite sibling?\n\nWhat have you purchased that's been the biggest waste of money?\n\nHow would you rate your looks on a scale of 1 to 10?\n\nWhat celebrity do you look up to?\n\nIf you could be one celebrity for a day, who would it be?\n\nIf you could do any job in the world, what would it be?\n\nWhat's your dream life?\n\nWhat do you value the most - money, fame, success, friends, family, etc?\n\nWhat’s your biggest red flag?\n\nIf you had to marry someone in this room, who would it be and why?\n\nWhat’s one movie you’re embarrassed to admit you enjoy?\n\nWhat music artist do you secretly think is overrated?\n\nWhat’s your most controversial political opinion?\n\nName something you can’t live without\n\nWhere do you think you’ll be in five years time?\n\nWhat's on your 'On Repeat' Spotify playlist right now?\n\nHow well do you think you’d do in a horror movie?\n\nHow many stuffed animals do you own?\n\nDid you ever get in trouble at school?
