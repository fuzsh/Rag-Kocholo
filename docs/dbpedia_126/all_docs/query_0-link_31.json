        "text": "Roll Dem Bones\n\nThe following commentary comes from a discussion on the Savage Worlds Yahoo group.\n\nABOUT MULTIPLE ARCANE BACKGROUNDS…\n\nI don’t normally allow that in all of my Savage World games. I would like to point out that in so doing that it places the magic user with a greater chance for magical backlash to devastate them. Another thing to look at is in the Fantasy Companion is an Arcane Background Edge called Alchemist. It would be easy to adapt the tenets of that to make an Artificer. With some tweaking, you can have a magic user able to craft magical items and still cast under the auspices of one Edge.\n\nNow a magic user that does elemental magic probably should have a primary devotion. Secondary devotions, different trappings, could be used with each new Rank attainment. The secondary devotion would cost one Power Point more than the primary devotion. Trappings would allow them to modify the different elemental focus and what they could do. Finally I would think if they had ie. fire as their primary devotion that the secondary devotion(s) could not be an elemental focus in direct opposition, water."
