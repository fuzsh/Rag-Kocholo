        "text": "Citation preview\n\nKINO: The Russian Cinema Series General Editor’s Preface\n\nCinema has been the predominant popular art form of the first half of the twentieth century, at least in Europe and North America. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the former Soviet Union, where Lenin’s remark that ‘of all the arts, cinema is the most important’ became a cliché and where cinema attendances were until recently still among the highest in the world. In the age of mass politics Soviet cinema developed from a fragile but effective tool to gain support among the overwhelmingly illiterate peasant masses in the civil war that followed the October 1917 Revolution, through a welter of experimentation, into a mass weapon of propaganda through the entertainment that shaped the public image of the Soviet Union – both at home and abroad for both elite and mass audiences – and latterly into an instrument to expose the weaknesses of the past and present in the twin processes of glasnost and perestroika. Now the national cinemas of the successor republics to the old USSR are encountering the same bewildering array of problems, from the trivial to the terminal, as are all the other ex-Soviet institutions. Cinema’s central position in Russian and Soviet cultural history and its unique combination of mass medium, art form and entertainment industry, have made it a continuing battlefield for conflicts of broader ideological and artistic significance, not only for Russia and the Soviet Union but also for the world outside. The debates that raged in the 1920s about the relative merits of documentary as opposed to fiction film, of cinema as opposed to theatre or painting, or of the proper role of cinema in forging of post-Revolutionary Soviet culture and the shaping of the new Soviet man, have their echoes in current discussions about the role of cinema vis-à-vis other art forms in effecting the cultural and psychological revolution in human consciousness necessitated by\n\nGeneral Editor’s Preface vii the processes of economic and political transformation of the former Soviet Union into modern democratic and industrial societies and states governed by the rule of law. Cinema’s central position has also made it a vital instrument for scrutinizing the blank pages of Russian and Soviet history and enabling the present generation to come to terms with its own past. This series of books intends to examine Russian and Soviet films in the context of Russian and Soviet cinema, and Russian and Soviet cinema in the context of the political and cultural history of Russia, the Soviet Union and the world at large. Within that framework the series, drawing its authors from both East and West, aims to cover a wide variety of topics and to employ a broad range of methodological approaches and presentational formats. Inevitably this will involve ploughing once again over old ground in order to re-examine received opinions but it principally means increasing the breadth and depth of our knowledge, finding new answers to old questions and, above all, raising new questions for further inquiry and new areas for further research. The continuing aim of the series is to situate Russian and Soviet cinema in its proper historical and aesthetic context, both as a major cultural force and as a crucible for experimentation that is of central significance to the development of world cinema culture. Books in the series strive to combine the best of scholarship, past, present and future, with a style of writing that is accessible to a broad readership, whether that readership’s primary interest lies in cinema or in Russian and Soviet political history.

Olga Matich and Irina Paperno not only tolerated but encouraged my slippage into the visual; my work has many times benefited from their perceptive suggestions. Linda Williams, Marilyn Fabe and Mark Sandberg make any country more interesting and have been a great source of inspiration and encouragement. Kaja Silverman and Harsha Ram responded very thoughtfully to earlier versions of this book, and Jeff Karlsen and Glen Worthey made invaluable contributions to this project as my research assistants. I am often inspired by the work of my fellow Eisenstein scholars, many of whom have become deeply valued interlocutors: Oksana Bulgakova, Yuri Tsivian, Richard Taylor, Ian Christie, Barry Scherr, David Bordwell, Joan Neuberger and Alexander Zholkovsky are some of those whose questions and comments have improved the shape of my thinking. I am grateful, too, to the many institutions that have given me financial or practical support over the last few years. The Social Science Research Council, IREX, the Hellman Family Foundation and UC Berkeley provided funds that enabled my research in Moscow and elsewhere. The Townsend Center for the Humanities at UC Berkeley gave me not only time but also a sense of community. The staffers of RGALI (the Russian State Archive of Literature and the Arts) proved to be extraordinarily helpful. Edith Kramer and all the amazing people at the Pacific Film Archive have my admiration and gratitude. I would like to express my thanks also to Ann Martin at Film Quarterly, where some of the material now in this book’s seventh chapter first appeared. At I.B.Tauris, Philippa Brewster, Deborah Susman and Susan Lawson have been both patient and helpful.\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements ix In Russia, I learned an enormous amount from conversations with Naum Kleiman, whose dedication to the preservation of Russian and Soviet film history is unsurpassed. Lev and Karma Slezkine knew how to make Moscow feel like home, and Masha and Viktor Zhivov welcomed my family with open arms. My heroic mother, Helen MacPherson Nesbet, came to Moscow one summer and shepherded a volatile two-year-old all around the city while I worked in the archives. I wish she could be here now to see how the child and the book have grown. In every person’s life there are certain essential people without whom nothing would get done. Grisha Freidin has stepped in on a number of occasions to help me out of book-related difficulties. For the moral and practical support provided by him and by Victoria Bonnell, I am eternally grateful. Yuri and Natasha Goroshko made Russian our household language for a while. Lisa Little and Yuri Slezkine make me glad to live in Berkeley. Will Waters knows better than anyone how much words matter and how much better it is to revise book chapters above treeline. Roo Hooke and Sharon Inkelas have repaired my spirits many times over the last few decades, and at home Thera, Ada and Eleanor Naiman keep everything a bit off-kilter in the nicest possible way. There are two people I would like especially to acknowledge. I think the first conversation I ever had about Eisenstein was with Russell Merritt. Russell has a wonderful way of handing over nuggets of wisdom, while insisting repeatedly (and entirely without cause) that you have been terribly, terribly helpful to him. He is the most generous person I’ve ever met. He is also far and away the best person to sneak off to the movies with. And of all the academics I know, Eric Naiman is probably the best reader. He lets nothing steal by. He’s tough. His standards are high. How these sterling qualities got mixed up with a fondness for obscene puns, I confess I have no idea, but Eric is a great coach and a great friend, and I admire him no end. To Russell Merritt and Eric Naiman, then, my favorite teachers, this book is dedicated with equal amounts of admiration and affection.\n\nA Note on Transliteration In the scholarly apparatus I follow the system used by the Library of Congress, but in the text certain names appear in spellings that have become familiar to Western readers: ‘Eisenstein’, for instance, rather than ‘Eizenshtein’.\n\nFrequently Cited Sources Archival materials from the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI, ‘Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyi arkhiv literatury i iskusstva’) are cited by ‘fond’ (collection), ‘opis’’ [‘op.’] (record series), ‘edinitsa khraneniia’ [‘e/kh’] (file) and ‘list’’ [‘l.’] (sheet).

What’s more, they do not mean by this that they will turn into these birds after death, or that in the past their ancestors were parrots. Categorically not. They directly claim that they actually are these very birds. And this is not about a similarity of name or some kind of relatedness, but rather the complete, synchronous identity of the two beings.1 SM Eisenstein\n\nSergei Eisenstein delighted in unlikely juxtapositions: he was apt to cite from Stalin and Walt Disney in the same breath and folded a startling mixture of mythological references, scraps salvaged from the newspapers of the day and pornographic jokes into his films and essays. Although there have been quite a number of books written on Eisenstein, most of them shy away from the heterogeneity underlying his work. This was a man, after all, who could say in all seriousness of an advertisement clipped from an issue of Life magazine, ‘one could write a whole book about this’ and go on to bring its imagery into a thematic series that included Gogol, Freud, circus clowns and the early German mystics. Although he was a passionate Marxist, Eisenstein’s interpretation of dialectics (for one example) was hardly orthodox; he translated all the tenets of ‘dialectical materialism’ into aesthetic terms as flexible as his own intensely plastic imagination. Thus a cream separator could become the very embodiment – no mere illustration – of the transformation\n\nSavage Junctures\n\nof ‘quantity’ into ‘quality’, and the ‘negation of the negation’ could be achieved with mirrors, reflective puddles and film run in reverse. In short, his approach to philosophy (and to political thought) was figurative: he mined Hegel, Engels, Lenin, Freud (and Stalin’s speeches, too) for their figures, their images, which he then threw into sometimes blasphemous conjunction with images borrowed from literature, folklore, popular culture and myth. These habits irritated his contemporaries, made uneasy by, among other things, the effect bawdy jokes had on what in another director’s hands would be straightforward epic and by Eisenstein’s suggestion that Soviet actors could learn a thing or two from the Bororo Indians of South America, who believed they were not just men, but also (and at the very same time) red parrots. I think it is safe to say that Eisenstein’s many different audiences continue even now to be unsettled by his lack of decorum: he is never clearly one thing over another, never philosopher enough or fool enough to be easily categorized, and his political attitudes, too, resist pigeonholing even as they seem to invite it. There is not yet (nor will there ever be) a critical consensus as to whether Ivan the Terrible, the film Stalin first lauded (Part One) and then banned (Part Two), is really a despicably pro-Stalinist or a fearlessly antiStalinist tract. It is, like most of Eisenstein’s work, too many things at once, and some of those things, like Ivan’s playful quoting of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, aren’t even ‘serious’. In fact, Eisenstein could be most profoundly serious at the very points where silliness or obscenity erupted. He did not merely mine philosophy for likely figures, but insisted that the figure, the image, could itself be the basis of serious, even philosophical, thought. At the heart of intellectual thought, a scandalous, blasphemous or perhaps pornographic image: this was a basic rule of Eisenstein’s essays, films and lectures. The device is most plainly bared, perhaps, in Alexander Nevsky, when, as he plans strategy for the battle with the Teutonic invaders, Nevsky overhears an anecdote about a vixen and a hare: A hare leaps into a ravine with a vixen on his tail. He makes for the forest, the vixen after him. So the hare hops between a pair of birch trees. The vixen springs after him – and sticks. Pinned between the two birches, she wriggles and she struggles, but there’s no getting free. Calamity! Meanwhile the hare stands alongside her and says in a serious voice: ‘If you’re agreeable,’ he says, ‘I’ll now put paid to your virginity, all of it…’ The soldiers around the campfire laugh. Ignat [the plain-spoken armourer\n\nIntroduction\n\nwho tells this story] goes on: ‘… Oh, how can you, good neighbor, it isn’t done. How can you serve me such a shameful trick. Have pity!’ she says. ‘This is no time for pity,’ the hare tells her. And he pounces. Alexander turns around and asks: ‘Between two birch trees?’ Ignat replies: ‘He pinned her.’ Alexander’s voice asks: ‘And pounced?’ Ignat replies laughing: ‘He pounced.’2\n\nFrom this story of one animal’s clever capture and rape of another, Alexander Nevsky instantly develops a fail-safe scenario for victory. He splits up his forces and has his troops lure the Teutons onto the ice so that the Russians, like the hare, may ‘pounce’ on them. The difference between Ignat, earthy man of the people, who tells the joke and Alexander Nevsky, who overhears it, is that while the ‘little man’ (and his immediate audience) sees in the joke only a joke, it is the military leader and strategist who is wise enough to recognize that obscenity and conceptual thought are by no means mutually exclusive – and may, in fact, be comrades-in-arms. The tale of the Vixen and the Hare embedded in Alexander Nevsky demonstrates the power of such thinking: if Nevsky, following in the footsteps of the Bororo, can accept seeing his own predicament in that of a mere rabbit, then the enemy, no matter how carnivorous, is doomed. It is entirely appropriate that Eisenstein should have found this anecdote in a collection of pornographic folklore given him by Viktor Shklovsky.3 We know about Shklovsky’s own affection for this genre from, among other things, his seminal essay ‘Art as Device’ (1917), the last third of which explores the dirty joke as a model for the aesthetic function of ‘defamiliarization’: the ‘making strange’ that makes art. If, as Eisenstein suspected, art communicated with its audience by means of unexpected images and juxtapositions, then the shocks that were to precipitate the spectator in an unexpected mental direction were applications not just of force, but of force eroticized. These shocks had the ability to restore the full intensity and vigor of perception (and thus of life) to the spectator, but whether that renewed vision should be confused with thinking was another issue entirely. Indeed, Shklovsky had polemicized in ‘Art as Device’ against the notion of art as ‘thinking in images’, a phrase he attacked at the outset of his essay as an already long-exhausted cliché: ‘“Art\n\nSavage Junctures\n\nis thinking in images.’ One hears this phrase even from gymnasium students and it is also the standard point of departure for learned philologists.’4 For Shklovsky, picture-thinking was something significantly less than art: the deterioration of poetry into the prose of illustrative examples (the image in bondage to the idea). Shklovsky wanted his readers to replace this old chestnut with art as detour and defamiliarization, so that seeing might be rescued from recognition and so that life might be rescued from the deadening effects of automatization. Eisenstein’s work, however, which absolutely insists on the power of ‘thinking in images’, is both an indebted homage to and a travesty of Shklovsky’s revolutionary poetics. In Eisenstein’s practice, images are not merely ‘simpler and clearer’ signs for the abstract ideas they represent (Shklovsky’s objection to art as thinking-in-images): they are as complex, as ‘real,’ as any of the meanings they might convey. The relationship between image and idea in Eisenstein is like that perceived by the Bororo between man and red parrot: neither identity in thrall to the other. Eisenstein, in short, defends a truly image-based – figurative – philosophy as the most profound and relevant goal of modern thought. The union of idea and image was a scandalous juncture not only for staunch defenders (like Shklovsky) of the primacy of aesthetic experience, but also for those who approached the problem from the perspective of the philosophical tradition. Still looming large over the aesthetic debate in the early twentieth century was Hegel’s monument to the temptations of picturethinking, The Phenomenology of Spirit, in which a mighty struggle between ‘image’ (‘Bild’) and ‘concept’ (‘Begriff ’) had been revealed as the motor powering man’s ascent towards transcendent truth. As Hegel told the story, the image might help the philosophical pilgrim learn the lesson of the moment, but it must itself be surpassed, lest the seeker find himself trapped within it. The Russians struggling with these issues in the age of cinema inherited a long tradition of fascination with the paradigms presented in Hegel. In the late 1920s, Eisenstein would tackle this issue head-on, phrasing the goal of cinema as a project of combining the ‘language of images’ and the ‘language of ideas’. For Hegel – and for his philosophical descendants – a philosophy that got itself too mixed up with the image, with art, could only be a mockery of a philosophy, a merely figurative philosophy. ‘One would do better,’ proclaimed Theodor Adorno in 1931, ‘to liquidate philosophy entirely and to dissolve it into its various sciences than to come to its aid with a poetic ideal\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat amounts to nothing other than a poor ornamental cover for false thinking.’5\n\nWhat is it about the mixing of image and idea that lends itself so to warnings about the disaster of ‘faulty thinking,’ that well-dressed usurper of philosophy? The image can become a stumbling block, a trap, not merely attracting the mind, but to some degree arresting it in its tracks. Another philosophical lesson – itself an image – was on the minds of those puzzling through the relationship of thought and picture in the first few decades of the age of cinema: Plato’s parable of the cave from The Republic. Plato’s exemplary spectator, trapped in a cave and watching the shadows of objects projected onto the walls, is quite thoroughly befuddled and imprisoned by these images. Barring the appearance of a rough and undeceiving teacher, the cave-man will never realize that these are merely shadows, that the fire that lights this spectacle is itself a mere shadow of the great sun outside, that outside this cave is a whole world more real than the one he knows. And if that man is taken from the cave, it will be painful for him to adjust to the new light and the new world and even if he succeeds in that, it will be very difficult indeed to convince his companions still living in darkness of the truth of their situation. This allegory of the difficulties involved in true education (Plato says one must take the shoulders of the person one is trying to educate and literally turn him to face the truth) is itself a spectacle, an image, endowed with a remarkable power to infect the mind of the reader, and thus it demonstrates both the potency and the danger of images for philosophy. Its effectiveness as a warning against the allure of mere images depends on the story’s eerily proto-cinematic imagery. In both its imagery and its conceptual concerns, Plato’s allegory of the cave reminds us of the philosophical dilemmas lurking in the movie theater, if that cinema wants not just to attract and imprison its viewers, but also to change and inspire them. When the young Maksim Gorkii, covering the international exposition at Nizhnii-Novgorod in 1896 as a journalist, was introduced to the cinematograph, then making its debut in Russia, he turned to the Platonic model for his metaphors: the new medium was a ‘Kingdom of Shadows’, a deceptive and possibly corrupting trap.6 For those, like Eisenstein, who understood that trapping the viewer might be an integral part of getting one’s point across, the cinema-as-cave’s mixture of seductive spectacle and education could not be seen as merely negative. Eisenstein was tempted to add another layer of analogy to the scenario: if the cave and the cinema could be\n\nSavage Junctures\n\nconflated (and the value of that cave largely shifted from negative to positive), so too could this cinema-cave and that other cave-like space, that central arena of all education and propaganda, the mind of the spectator. In early writings and in his early films, Eisenstein seems taken with the idea that the images projected on the screen would actually become the thoughts in the spectator’s brain. The film serves, in a sense, in the place of consciousness – an aggressive model, certainly, but one with the advantage of limiting the chances for an audience to misunderstand what it was seeing. In this light, Eisenstein must have been pleased by the discussion of The Battleship Potemkin at one of the Association for Revolutionary Cinema’s Thursday discussions (14 January 1926). Leo Mur spoke then of Eisenstein’s montage as an action not limited to the screen: The fundamental method used by Eisenstein he calls the montage of attractions. This name is not entirely correct. Eisenstein does not only edit the reel, but also the cells in the brain of the spectator. Montage not of attractions, but of associations. Montage not only on the screen of the movie theater, but also on the screen of the brain.7\n\nBoth Mur and Vsevolod Pudovkin underscored the power over the spectator achieved by Eisenstein in this film. Mur said, ‘The spectator edits [montiruet] the scenes in his brain the way Eisenstein wants him to’ (l. 2) and Pudovkin agreed: ‘Montage is the forceful direction [nasil’stvennoe upravlenie] of the spectator. Eisenstein brilliantly controls it, leading the spectator almost to pathos’ (l. 4). Although Mur tried to distinguish between the effect Battleship Potemkin had on the cells of the brain and Eisenstein’s own term, ‘montage of attractions’, in fact when Eisenstein coined that phrase in 1923, he himself insisted on the essential importance of what happened within the head of the viewer, claiming that an attraction that had no such effect could only be called a sterile ‘trick’: ‘In so far as the trick is absolute and complete within itself, it means the direct opposite of the attraction, which is based exclusively on something relative, the reactions of the audience.’8 The ‘brain-screen’ was the only proper place for the projection of an Eisenstein film. This analogy attempting to bridge the distance between the cinema screen and the murkier arena of the spectator’s brain responded not only to the desire to gain direct access to that brain (the ‘educational’ project), but also to a widespread, but perhaps deceptive, hunch that said that thinking was a process not unlike watching a movie. Was it, though? To what degree was thinking\n\nIntroduction\n\nbased on images, rather than language and what connection was there between image and word? In Eisenstein’s day, the notion of thinking as ‘inner speech’ was very prevalent, but to what degree that ‘speech’ was like ordinary language was a heavily contested issue. Lev Vygotsky, a psychologist who had a great influence on Russian artists in the early part of the century, described this inner speech as a mercurial substance halfway between word and image: ‘Inner speech is to a large extent thinking in pure meanings. It is a dynamic, shifting, unstable thing, fluttering between word and thought.’9 In an essay entitled ‘Cinema Stylistics’ (1927), the brilliant Formalist Boris Eikhenbaum extended this unstable realm to encompass the response a viewer had to a film. ‘The film metaphor is a kind of visual realization of a verbal metaphor,’ Eikhenbaum claimed, but his explanation becomes complicated as he tries to explain what ‘kind’, exactly, of ‘visual realization’ might be at work and to what degree film communicated by means of some sub rosa reference to already existing linguistic metaphors: A film metaphor is, as it were, a realized metaphor, actually embodied on the screen. How can it be taken seriously? Obviously, the point here is that in cinema, first of all, we are moving within the bounds not of verbal, but of cinematographic motivation; and, secondly, the internal speech of the film viewer, which is forming itself on the basis of shots, is not realized in the shape of precise verbal formulations. We have an inverse relationship: whereas the verbal metaphor is not realized in the consciousness of the reader to the point of forming a clear visual image (i.e. the metaphorical sense shields us from the literal image), the film metaphor is not realized in the consciousness of the film viewer to the point of forming a complete verbal proposition.10\n\nStriking in this description is the degree to which cinematic communication depends upon things half-formed, ghostly entities glimpsed in the process of metamorphosing from one state into another (from language into image; from image into language) and thus never entirely graspable or ‘realized’. ‘Internal speech’ and ‘film metaphor’ are categories blurry enough to trouble the larger outlines of Eikhenbaum’s study of ‘Cinema Stylistics’, dependent as that essay is on linguistic analogy. For Viktor Shklovsky, not only the founding father of formalist criticism but also the Soviet Union’s most astute film critic, cinema inhabited an intermediate realm between pure image and true language. Cinema could be seen as a kind of language, but only if one compared it to those forms of communication most difficult to characterize in their own right:\n\nSavage Junctures More than anything else cinema resembles Chinese painting. Chinese painting lies in between drawing and the word. The people moving on the screen are hieroglyphs of sorts. These aren’t cine-images, but cine-words, cine-concepts. Montage is the syntax and etymology of the cinematic language. When for the first time the film Intolerance was shown in the USSR, the audience couldn’t endure the montage (Griffith’s) and left the screening. Now the audience reads Griffith right from the page. The convention of spatiality, the convention of silence, the convention of colorlessness in cinema – all have analogies in language. The cinematic rule that one mustn’t show how a man sat at a table, began to eat and finished eating – that is, the rule of extracting from an action its single characteristic part, the mark of that action – is also the transformation of the cinematic image into a hieroglyph. For this reason it is incorrect to say that the language of cinema is universally understood. No, it is just easily learned.11\n\nInteresting in this description is the way the intermediary nature of cinema (and of Chinese painting) is characterized: what one sees on the screen, whether painted or projected, is the image caught in the process of becoming more like verbal language, with the ‘hieroglyph’ representing one stage in a broader process of metamorphosis. The notion of the hieroglyph as the model for cinema communication appealed not just to Shklovsky, but also to Eisenstein, who had gained permission to return to Moscow after finishing his Civil War work by applying to study Japanese. Once Eisenstein arrived in Moscow, theater rather than Oriental languages absorbed the bulk of his energies, but he always retained an affection for ‘hieroglyphs’ (as he referred to Chinese characters) and would occasionally use examples taken from the language and culture of China or Japan to illustrate theoretical points.12 Caught somewhere between language and image, both cinema and the sort of thinking it provoked escaped easy categorization. We should probably take Eisenstein’s ‘montage of attractions’ as, to some degree, wishful thinking: the desire to discover and employ cinematic devices that would, by definition, have a determinable effect on the very cells of the spectator’s brain: An attraction (in our diagnosis of theater) is any aggressive moment in theater, i.e. any element of it that subjects the audience to emotional or psychological influence, verified by experience and mathematically calculated to produce specific emotional shocks in the spectator in their proper order within the whole.13\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf only cinema could work like a ‘mathematically calculated’ chain reaction. In all of Eisenstein’s many references to ‘reflexes’, a topic much in evidence in the Soviet Union of the 1920s, one senses this longing: to be able to construct a real chain of cause and effect that would nullify the distance between screen and brain.14 When Eisenstein defined the effect of art in terms of a violent but calculated sort of shock (‘a brilliantly calculated blow of the billiard cue [on] the audience’s cerebral hemisphere’),15 it was partly because the violence promised to cut through the fog of the communicative no-man’s-land in which cinematic image and ‘internal speech’ circled each other so warily. A blow on the head might not be subtle, but it did seem the quintessential example of a universal language, the universality of film language being in some doubt. What kind of philosophy could be based upon ‘shocks,’ however? The shock – or even a montage of shocks – might logically be seen as antithetical to real thinking. That would be Adorno’s complaint about another man seeking a way of reformulating ‘philosophy’ to incorporate the image: Walter Benjamin. Adorno took Benjamin to task in terms strikingly reminiscent of Eisenstein’s language from the period of the ‘Montage of Attractions’ manifesto: Benjamin’s intention was to renounce all open interpretation and to let meanings emerge only through the shock-like montage of the material. Philosophy was not only to overtake surrealism, but also to become surreal itself.16\n\nAdorno, for whom this montage-based approach to philosophy seemed hazardous, meant to suggest that Benjamin’s great project of his last years, the Passagenwerk that remained fundamentally an archival exploration of the nature of the nineteenth century, a great collection of quotes, images and ideas sorted by theme, could not achieve its intellectual aims because it was excessively ‘surrealist’ – that is to say, its contents exceeded the organizational control Benjamin could impose on them. True philosophy, warned Adorno, should not be so willing to cede agency to its raw materials. But for Eisenstein, as for Benjamin, the nature of real thinking, of philosophy, was not such a simple thing to define. Eisenstein, like Benjamin, spent the last years of his life assembling vast collections of texts and images grouped around the fundamental issues (the Grundproblem, as Eisenstein called one great branch of his investigation) that seemed to him to lie at the heart of the mysteries of the human mind. He, like Benjamin, could appreciate the power of a ‘profane illumination’, the revelation of a juncture between\n\n10 Savage Junctures seemingly disparate objects or epochs.17 Benjamin, however, had a different relationship to temporal junctures: his ‘now’ was always in the process of receding into the past. For Eisenstein, who did not feel himself bound by the constraints of ‘late capitalism’ – though socialism undoubtedly imposed its own spectrum of constraints, some cruel indeed – the whole of world history could be surveyed with a strange absence of nostalgia, partly perhaps because the cultural history of the world was not, for Eisenstein, something located in or moving towards an irretrievable past, but rather quite vitally alive in the present. A central part of that living cultural resource was, for Eisenstein, the kind of serious thinking historically called ‘philosophy’. What is it about this old-fashioned and contested term that might allow us to appropriate it for Eisenstein’s radical experiments? Some members of his generation would have argued, after all, that ‘dialectical materialism’ had forever displaced philosophy, that tired arena of bourgeois idealism. For Eisenstein, however, philosophy (like art, for that matter) was something that should be thought of as not only dialectical, but cumulative: The onesidedness of a child’s complex thinking becomes the conscious thinking of the adult, having absorbed into himself also that differentiating beginning. Thus also the consciousness of a person at the dawn of culture becomes the consciousness of a person of a developed cultural epoch. Thus also philosophy out of prehistorical chaos becomes the materialistic dialectic. [Emphasis in the original]18\n\nEven when he was employing the most generic tools of Marxist thought, Eisenstein tended to mould them to his own purposes. Here, for instance, the use of ‘materialistic dialectic’, instead of the more usual ‘dialectical materialism’, shifts the phrase’s emphasis slightly away from a pragmatic focus on materialism (the dialectic made useful) towards the more figurative potential of dialectical thinking per se. Eisenstein found support for his unique vision of dialectical materialism in his equally unique reading of Lenin; he cited again and again passages from a few favorite Lenin articles where the political leader managed to sound remarkably like Eisenstein himself. These writings (Lenin’s conspectus of Hegel’s Science of Logic, ‘On the Question of the Dialectic,’ published in the journal Bol’shevik in 1925 and the writings published in the 12th Leninskii sbornik) were almost always concerned with issues of the ‘dialectic’ itself over and above more local or more political matters. In fact, the Eisensteinian Lenin manages to transcend history in a\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nrather sublime way. Right after describing the ‘materialistic dialectic’ as something developing out of ‘prehistoric chaos’, for instance, in the article previously cited, Eisenstein turns to Lenin for support: ‘In essence we have in this instance that “seeming return to the old” about which Lenin speaks with regard to the question of the dialectic of appearances’ (IP2 386).19 With the help of Lenin, then, Eisenstein explains that prehistory is never exactly left behind, but rather turned into a dialectical component of the present historical or aesthetic moment: even the highest, most developed image bears at least a plastic trace of its most primitive ancestry (IP2 386). The ‘materialistic dialectic’ is more than merely itself; it encompasses also even the ‘chaos’ of its distant past. As dialectical materialism is stretched to incorporate its own prehistory and as Leninist thought is released from its (materialist) ties to local history, Eisenstein’s version of the dialectic encroaches once more upon the territory of that more general term, ‘philosophy,’ which in his definition above had at first seemed to be sundered by the passage of time into the subcategories of ‘prehistoric chaos’ and ‘materialistic dialectic’. Brought into scandalous juncture by Eisenstein’s image-based and dialectical philosophy, prehistory and the present moment could be seen to illuminate each other. Adorno derided the Eisensteinian/Benjaminian project – philosophical thought that would ‘emerge solely through the shock-like montage of the material’ – as a ‘surrealistic philosophy’, for him an oxymoronic concept at best. But perhaps we should take this impossible object seriously for a moment: what would it mean to think of Eisenstein as a ‘surrealist philosopher’? In his fondness for savage junctures, after all, Eisenstein was not so very unlike André Breton, who wrote in his ‘Surrealist Manifesto’ of 1924 of the illuminatory power of ‘juxtaposition’: It is, as it were, from the fortuitous juxtaposition of the two terms that a particular light has sprung, the light of the image, to which we are infinitely sensitive. The value of the image depends upon the beauty of the spark obtained; it is, consequently, a function of the difference of potential between the two conductors. When the difference exists only slightly, as in a comparison, the spark is lacking.20\n\nBreton, however, unlike Eisenstein, admitted and even insisted on the artist’s lack of control over the light produced by these juxtaposed images: Now, it is not within man’s power, so far as I can tell, to effect the juxtaposition of two realities so far apart. The principle of the\n\n12 Savage Junctures association of ideas, such as we conceive of it, militates against it[…] We are therefore obliged to admit that the two terms of the image are not deduced one from the other by the mind for the specific purpose of producing the spark, that they are the simultaneous products of the activity I call Surrealist, reason’s role being limited to taking note of and appreciating, the luminous phenomenon. (Breton 37)\n\nThe depiction of the artist as yet another spectator, ‘appreciating the luminous phenomenon’, would be unacceptable for Eisenstein in the 1920s. As we have seen, only a year prior to Breton’s manifesto, Eisenstein had defined the unit of theatrical com-munication or juncture between performance and audience, the ‘attraction,’ as an ‘aggressive moment… calculated to produce specific emotional shocks in the spectator’(SW1 34). Eisenstein’s combative definition, one that insists on control, analysis and calculation at every step, aims for an active approach to the creation (though not necessarily the reception) of the dialectical image. One might also say that Eisenstein here wants to make very clear that his position is not, like everybody else’s, among the audience. There was an affinity between Eisenstein and the Surrealists that could not be admitted too readily on the Soviet side (where the Surrealists had been deemed unsatisfactory Communists). In France in 1930, however, when Eisenstein was taking questions from the audience, he provided a relatively generous analysis of the connections between himself and the Surrealists: Q What do you think of Surrealism? A It is very interesting because Surrealism works, I may say, in a way that is dramatically opposed to ours. It is always interesting to understand and evaluate things on diametrically opposed ground: I must admit that on one level we might find common ground and speak the same language… I must add to the subject of Surrealism that the extremes meet or, if you take Marx’s formulation, opposite objects have the possibility of changing places and combining. That is probably why the personal sympathies between us are quite strong. But from the theoretical point of view we are very different: the Surrealists seek to expose subconscious emotions while I seek to use them and play with them to provoke emotion.21\n\nAt the end of this wonderfully evasive response, one is left wondering to what degree Eisenstein and the Surrealists, ‘opposite objects’ though they might be, could be said to ‘speak the same language’. The places where ‘extremes meet’ were, in Eisenstein’s terminology of the period, points of ‘unexpected juncture’.22 In\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nany case, Eisenstein’s emphasis was to be on exploiting, rather than merely ‘exposing’ the subconscious: the discoveries of Freud were to be put to work in the service of Marx. From his earliest days as a filmmaker, Eisenstein demonstrated how ‘opposite objects’ might be forced to produce satire. The first bit of film produced by Eisenstein was an insert into a play, Enough Simplicity for Every Wise Man (1923), a wild and woolly remake (with Eisenstein’s playwright friend Sergei Tret’iakov) of Ostrovsky’s nineteenth-century classic. The play was punctuated with circus acts and other shocks, most famously, perhaps, the firecrackers that were supposed to go off beneath the seats of the audience. The short film sequence inserted into the action at the end of the play as another ‘trick’ or ‘attraction’ among many was itself a kind of collage of film attractions, a witty take-off on the trick-films of Méliès, with a central emphasis on the theme of metamorphosis.23 The film (‘The Diary of Glumov’) is supposed to represent the contents of the hero’s stolen diary. Poor Glumov, eternal groveler, is subjected by his patrons (the warmongering Joffre, the fascist Gorodulin, the anti-Soviet émigré Mamaev) to one embarrassing transformation after another: he becomes, in turn, a cannon, a swastika and an ass, in each case the appropriate embodiment of the political ideology being lampooned. The political satire is underscored by a bawdiness that probably owes something to the music-hall inspirations of Eisenstein and Tret’iakov.24 Glumov’s wedding is the planned occasion that the ‘diary’ interrupts and makes impossible, and at every juncture his manhood is whittled away (the cannon is classically phallic in shape, so that Glumov is being forced to embody not only political symbols, but also rude jokes). Another trick sequence shows the ability of a woman, by her mere presence, to reduce a man literally to infancy again. The wedding that the film ends with is highly parodic, involving a woman cross-dressed in a man’s suit, an assemblage of clowns and rude hand gestures, a close-up of which, with the audience as target now, closes the short film. For the young Eisenstein, metamorphosis is part of the bag of cinematic tricks to which characters and audience alike can be subjected, one attraction among others. ‘Opposite objects’ are manipulated so that the character becomes the embodiment of something demeaning to itself, its own satire. As an attraction, this composite satirical object inspires a secondary mutation: the transformation of the spectator, who is altered by emotional and even physiological ‘shocks’ from which he cannot retreat.\n\n14 Savage Junctures Although in ‘Enough Simplicity for Every Wise Man’ the objects manipulated satirically are very much constructions of the director, Eisenstein exhibited throughout his life a particular passion for knick-knacks, curios and oddments that in some respects served his satirical purposes and in other ways undermined satire. Here again the ‘extremes’ of Eisenstein’s cinema and French Surrealism seem to meet, in a pronounced affection for ‘found objects.’ In his 1937 L’amour fou (Mad Love), André Breton explores the nature of the ‘found object’ as instigator of philosophical thought. One of the most striking examples presented there is that of a wooden spoon Breton found one day in 1934 when strolling the Paris flea market with his friend Alberto Giacometti. At first it is not so clear to Breton what it is about this spoon, the only distinctive feature of which would seem to be the little wooden ‘shoe’ on which the handle rests when the spoon is set down, that draws his attention so. It is the revelatory nature of the found object that most fascinates Breton: The discovery of an object rigorously fulfills the same function as the dream, in the sense that it liberates the individual from paralyzing affective scruples, comforts him and makes him understand that the obstacle he had believed insurmountable has been surpassed.25\n\nThe found object is a response to a question that the finder may not even have formulated clearly when he comes across the object; for Breton, in the case of this wooden spoon, the analysis to which he subjects his newly discovered object reveals layer after layer of relevance to those ideas that had been occupying his mind both before and after the discovery of the object upon which, it would turn out, these ideas depended: the spoon is both ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’ in shape; it represents Cinderella’s lost slipper; it speaks of love lost and found. In its wide-ranging, awestruck analysis of the felicitous juncture of ideas made material in this interesting object, Breton’s analysis of the wooden spoon is quite similar to Eisenstein’s notes of the 1930s and 1940s, as ‘found objects’ (which for Eisenstein could be not only objects per se, but also memories, texts and images from all kinds of sources, ranging from medieval manuscripts to advertisements in Life magazine) became a more and more central source of intellectual stimulation. This trend is not limited to the 1930s, although it becomes noticeably stronger as time goes by. Already in his films of the 1920s Eisenstein had demonstrated a fascination with objects that went beyond all ordinary parameters of diegetic usefulness; from the trick tables of Strike, disgorging\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nand swallowing typewriters and cocktails, through the lavishly photographed objects that so dominate much of October (mechanical toys encrusted with jewels, idols from around the world) and The General Line’s laughing porcelain pigs, the satirical function of the object in Eisenstein’s work of the 1920s was always at risk of drowning in the sheer joy of examination and collection. By the 1930s, the found object is no longer restricted to the satirical frame and indeed one suspects that Eisenstein’s reaction to the ‘Cinderella spoon’ would have been similar in some respects to Breton’s. Breton’s fascination with the infinitely regressing series of ‘shoe – with a heel that’s a shoe – with a heel that’s a shoe…’ exactly corresponds to Eisenstein’s affection for the structure of pars pro toto, a part becoming a ‘whole’ of which a ‘part’ again becomes a ‘whole’ of which a ‘part’ etc…26 Eisenstein also shared with the distant Breton an interest in ‘bi-sex’, as Eisenstein called it in his notes: the dialectical presence of male and female elements within a single image, figure, story, or object – of which the wooden spoon of L’amour fou was such a stunning example. The Freud that intrigued both Eisenstein and Breton in the 1930s was the author of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, that contradictory but fascinating essay in which love and protoplasm, death drives and Plato’s Symposium, all found a place.27 All of this abundance is also, of course, excessive. One of the pitfalls the image presents to philosophy is that of leading thought astray from any central idea. Rich in possible associations, every image can also be a seductive lure into infinite byways, regressions and detours. The scandal of excess is another fundamental feature of Eisenstein’s figurative philosophy and throughout this book, I try to respect (rather than repress) the indecorous nature of Eisenstein’s imagination. We are perhaps freer to do so now than ever before. For earlier critics, a relatively unified, more ‘congruous’ Eisenstein was often a philosophical or political necessity. When in 1976 Viacheslav Ivanov introduced the world to the unexpected riches of Eisenstein’s voluminous archives, he did so in a book that could not take the risk of mentioning Eisenstein’s name either in its title (Notes on the History of Semiotics in the USSR) or in the brief summary of the book that graced its copyright page (‘This book is dedicated to the analysis of the most important achievements of Soviet science in the areas of the theory of sign systems…’).28 By taking Eisenstein’s later musings on anthropological and ethnographic themes seriously, Ivanov was rescuing a whole segment of Eisenstein’s work from obscurity; little wonder, then, that Ivanov concentrated on those places in the notes\n\n16 Savage Junctures where Eisenstein seemed to anticipate the discoveries of modern ethnography: Eisenstein as semiotician avant la lettre. The messiness (the indecorousness) of Eisenstein’s thought had, understandably under such circumstances, to be minimized. Writing much more recently in the USA, David Bordwell has given us a magisterial, measured and exhaustive overview of Eisenstein’s work as we in the West have inherited it.29 Bordwell is a principled scholar, well read and logical, who does not suffer foolishness gladly, and so the indecorous nature of Eisenstein’s wit is not what arouses his interest and respect. When he considers the question of the degree to which Eisenstein can be taken seriously as a thinker, apart from his filmmaking, Bordwell’s conclusions are gently skeptical: He raised central questions about film form, style and effect and he made fair progress toward answering some of them. Whatever the defects of his general theory, his intellectual energy, wide learning and immense curiosity bequeathed us a wealth of concrete suggestions about how films work. (Bordwell 198)\n\nThis appraisal may be eminently fair, but it raises questions about the way we judge experiments in thinking: to what degree does serious thought depend on the development of a unified and coherent ‘general theory’? The unruliness of Eisenstein’s ‘immense curiosity’ is evident in the vast array of materials held in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI), Moscow. The very list of items (‘edinitsy’) contained in that archive fills two thick volumes and each of those ‘items’ represents many pages of the most varied material: drafts of essays and scenarios, quotations copied from other sources, clippings from newspapers and magazines, pictures, scraps of paper with scribbled words and phrases. More than 50 years after Eisenstein’s death, the vast quantities of written work left in his archive still remain largely unpublished. Indeed it can be difficult to know quite how to approach the undeniable wealth of specific thoughts and images Eisenstein left behind. It seems important to remember, however, that when Eisenstein became enthusiastic about an idea or pattern he saw repeated throughout history and culture (the ‘circle’ for instance and its thematic ties to the womb), it was the variety of the examples that drove his collecting. He did not lose the specificity of the individual objects in the thrill of the discovery of the ‘general rule’. This passion for particular instances was what saved him from becoming reductive, but it can also make his brand of picture thinking unwieldy.30 Working with Eisenstein’s materials means\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nbeing confronted at once by the competing demands of ‘central questions’, on the one hand, and of innumerable examples and cartoons and jokes on the other, seemingly trivial details that manage somehow to be both distracting and edifying. His films are much like this, too: there is ‘excess’, as Kristin Thompson has termed it, not only in Ivan the Terrible, but in every film he ever made.31 To ignore the distraction of images that seem to lead away from the center, to extract from the huge variety of Eisensteinian material only that which seems most serious in a conventional way, is in the case of Eisenstein to risk losing a part of what matters most of all, since for Eisenstein high and low, general rule and specific instance, were both absolutely fundamental components of serious thinking. At the All-Union Conference of Workers in Soviet Cinematography in January 1935, Sergei Eisenstein amazed the gathered luminati of Soviet cinematography by explaining to them that the most modern discoveries of cinema had their roots deep in ‘primitive’ ways of thinking about the world. The Soviet actor was to be understood as the descendant of the Bororo parrot-men, who ‘claim that they, although people, are at the same time a particular species of red parrot, common to Brazil’.32 That was not all: the power of cinematic metaphor, Eisenstein declared, derived from the same force underlying the Polynesian tradition of throwing open all doors when a woman was trying to give birth. His audience was not amused. Aleksandr Dovzhenko (the Ukrainian director whose intensely poetic visual style had a history of perplexing Soviet audiences) accused Eisenstein of paying too much attention to ‘Polynesian dames’ when, all around him, ‘living’ women were giving birth ‘in new ways’.33 Sergei Vasiliev, who as half of the directorial team responsible for the epic Chapaev (1934) was one of the chief heroes of the conference, advised Eisenstein, rather cheekily (since he himself had been a student in Eisenstein’s film seminars), to ‘throw off your Chinese bathrobe and busy yourself with delving into our contemporary Soviet reality’.34 Not having produced a film since The Old and the New (1929), Eisenstein was vulnerable to accusations of having become stuck in the past and his claims that contemporary artists should study the laws of ‘sensuous thought’ as expressed in the codes governing the lives of the Bororo, the Polynesians and so on, struck his audience as highly suspect: were modern Soviet artists really supposed to learn their trade from ‘primitive’ man? One of the ironies of this occasion was that Eisenstein, who was certainly not incapable of enjoying a scandal, was in this instance\n\n18 Savage Junctures perfectly serious. Eisenstein had brought the Bororo into a Moscow gathering of cinematographers to illustrate something that for him was a profoundly important idea: the power of mythology as an aspect of what Eisenstein called ‘sensuous thought’. Muscovite and Bororo collided, to the obvious distress of the former, at the intersection of ancient and modern practices of image-based thinking: a savage juncture. Eisenstein was the master of savage junctures, both by virtue of his insistence on the physicality, the potential violence, of communication and also because in those ‘savage’ or ‘primitive’ patterns of thinking that had so interested anthropologists like LevyBrühl, Eisenstein saw the potential for effective communication of the most intellectual and profound contemporary ideas. This book explores the varied and evolving role of the juncture in the construction of what I have decided to call Eisenstein’s ‘figurative philosophy’: the role played by the slaughterhouse in Russian modernism’s remaking of the eye; the odd combination of hyperphilosophy, myth and political philosophy that underlies Battleship Potemkin’s attempt to create a new kind of Soviet audience; Eisenstein’s pornographic gloss on Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit in October; the dangers and allures of two kinds of accumulation, capitalist and textual, that provide The General Line with its incendiary underpinnings; Eisenstein’s rediscovery of the power of the ‘flat arts’ on his trip to Mexico; the political potential of animation in High Stalinism’s festivals of laughter and terror; the resurgence of the autobiographical drive in Eisenstein’s final years, as the compulsion to collect ‘opposite objects’ from everywhere and every time accelerates. My working hypothesis here has been that the very collision between specific image and general rule that would seem to disqualify Eisenstein as a philosopher in fact does the opposite. To borrow Bordwell’s language, I would argue that it is in its very ‘defects’ that Eisenstein’s image-based thinking becomes most challenging and most productive. Although not indifferent to the arc of Eisenstein’s biography, this is not a biography. We are fortunate now to have a number of works devoted to synthetic overviews of Eisenstein’s life and art, ranging from Marie Seton’s passionate biography and the soberer presentations of his life by Yon Barna and Rostislav Iurenev, through the erudite and encyclopedic work of Barthélémy Amengual (unfortunately unavailable in English), to the distinguished recent monographs by David Bordwell and Oksana Bulgakowa.35 My focus has been instead the way contexts collide\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nin Eisenstein’s written and visual work: the savage junctures that structure his thinking. These contexts range from ‘local’ Soviet concerns (political debates, clippings from newspapers) to realms much farther afield: the mental makeup of the Bororo or the metaphysical implications of Mickey Mouse. I draw extensively on archival materials, but this book is also not a complete guide to those immense archives. Nor does it attempt to catalogue and analyze all of those projects Eisenstein began, thought and wrote about, but in many cases never completed, although some of those projects are central to my investigation. The aim here is rather to delve into those places where the explosive complexity of Eisenstein’s ‘figurative philosophy’ can take us in surprising or hazardous directions. In a polemical article from 1928, Eisenstein took to task those critics who could see nothing particularly noteworthy in the Kabuki theater then visiting Russia: [T]he Kabuki is dismissed with faint praise: ‘How musical!’ ‘What handling of objects!’ ‘What plasticity!’ And people come to the conclusion that there is nothing to be learned, that (as one senior critic spitefully remarked) there is nothing much here that is new: Meyerhold long ago ‘fleeced’ the Japanese!’36\n\nThese critics, said Eisenstein, were misunderstanding the crucial nature of the Kabuki; indeed they were demanding, as the Russian saying goes, ‘milk from a billy-goat’: ‘Milk a billy-goat? Agricultural practice is unaware of the operation. It is said that a billy-goat provides neither wool nor milk. It has another firmly established reputation and other honorable functions’ (SW1 115) No, it was not food and clothing that one should expect from the Japanese theater, but rather that ‘other honorable function’ upon which the reputation of the billy-goat depended: insemination. The Kabuki demonstrated the possibilities for ‘transference’ available to the cinema as it hovered at the threshold of sound: ‘the transference of the basic affective intention from one material to another, from one category of ‘stimulant’ to another’ (SW1 118). In other words, it was not the exploitation of the Kabuki’s ‘wool and meat’ that should be sought and even ‘celebrated’, as Eisenstein exclaimed in the last line of his article, but rather the juncture of Kabuki theater and Soviet cinema. This juncture was not just a matter of similarity or coincidence, but a copulatory event. The ‘juncture’ that played such a key, but diverse, role in Eisenstein’s intellectual landscape was sometimes, as in the\n\n20 Savage Junctures essay on the Kabuki, a kind of copula, a binding joint where two elements came together in a moment of fertilization. At other points, the juncture being explored was the often violent connection between artwork and audience: the Kabuki’s ‘brilliantly calculated blow of the billiard cue at the audience’s cerebral hemisphere’ being matched by Eisenstein’s description of film’s effect on the audience as that of ‘a tractor, ploughing over the psyche of the spectator from a given class position’.37 The juncture joined, sometimes violently, sometimes sexually, a film and its audience, the Kabuki and the Soviet cinema, an idea and a mind. Already, in the 1920s, Eisenstein’s junctures, violent though they often were, implied a certain degree of connection, even of unity, a theme that would deepen in the 1930s, as he turned his attention to the junctures between the modern mind and patterns inherited from old mythological traditions. In cinema’s transformative potential (stemming not only from its rich repertoire of technical tricks, but also from its omnivorous approach to the myths and paradigms of all of human culture), Eisenstein discovered a perfect modern home for the exhilarating and savage game of thinking, in which ‘abstract’ and ‘concrete’, like bull and matador, circle each other warily, waiting for that ecstatic, painful moment of consummate penetration when even the most intellectual idea and its figure might hope finally to achieve the ‘complete synchronous identity’ of the Bororo parrot-men.\n\n1. Beyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n‘I am the Cine-Eye. I am the mechanical eye. I the machine show you the world as only I can see it.’ Dziga Vertov, 19231 35.

The eye comes to life; on it appears a… lorgnette. the American diaphragm opens slightly. Sergei Eisenstein, 19242\n\nWhen Strike, Sergei Eisenstein’s first full-length film, appeared on Soviet screens in early 1925, reactions were remarkably mixed. Even a positive review was likely to contain expressions of puzzled amazement at the dizzying speed with which images replaced each other on the screen: ‘The furious montage often makes a hash of the action; episode piles upon episode; the fundamental thread is lost. It’s not always clear what is going on on the screen.’3 Strike was a film that made great demands on its audience; its young director, after all, was full of dreams of the power of ‘carefully calculated shocks’4 to startle, unsettle and otherwise educate an audience. Judging from the admiring but flummoxed reactions of critics at the time, the result of Eisenstein’s cinematic efforts was felt to be indisputably energetic and modern, but also very nearly unintelligible:\n\n22 Savage Junctures There’s a big minus with respect to the montage: the short length of the separate segments and the rapidity with which they follow each other; you can’t always manage to see and understand what’s being presented. This decidedly weakens this very valuable film’s accessibility for the mass viewer.5\n\nEisenstein seemed to be exploring the limits of his audience’s faculties; it was, early reviewers cautioned, almost beyond the capability of ordinary eyes and minds to integrate the flood of images contained in his film. In fact, while some reviewers expressed concern that the film’s ideological weaknesses were serious enough to warrant the providing by exhibitors of some sort of accompanying commentary, ‘underscoring the film’s weak aspects’,6 the greater fear seemed to be that the worker might not be able to make anything at all of the film: ‘[T]he working-class spectator will not accept Strike wholeheartedly, but rather with serious criticism and, of course, will not find himself entirely in agreement with the cinematic thinking [kinomyshlenie] of the director; in some places he may simply find it incomprehensible.’7 The distance Strike’s reviewers descried between the film’s cinematic innovations and the perceptive powers of the worker was a particularly vexing problem since Strike had been made under the auspices of the Proletkult, the organization devoted (at least in theory) to the creation of art by the masses for the masses.8 The young Eisenstein had found in the Proletkult financial and material support for his early experiments in theater and, now, cinema, but everything about his character, that of a young intellectual with immense creative ambitions – much more eager to educate and transform the working classes than to identify with them – was as if designed to highlight the class tensions within the Proletkult itself.9 Although Strike was ostensibly not only a Proletkult production, but also a collective project, the film’s reviewers seemed to assume that in fact Strike was the work of one inspired and sometimes overly feverish mind, that of its brash young director. Eisenstein naturally agreed. It was this question of the authorship of Strike that led to the break between Eisenstein and the Proletkult, an acrimonious and noisy divorce that coincided with the film’s opening and that was inspired by Eisenstein’s insistence that he himself, rather than the anonymous ‘Proletkult collective’, be given author’s rights. The quarrel reached its public apex in January of 1925, as V Pletnev, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Moscow Proletkult, testily explained in an open letter to the editors of the journal Kino-nedelia that Eisenstein had not ‘left’ the Proletkult but had ‘been asked to\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n23\n\nleave’ in December 1924, once the Executive Bureau of the Moscow Proletkult had determined that his demands for author’s rights were ‘pretentious’ and the tone in which he had conveyed his demands ‘unacceptable’.10 Eisenstein and the Proletkult had then apparently engaged in a race to see who could ditch the other first: And only after this resolution had been passed and he found out about it did SM Eisenstein attempt to communicate by telephone his decision to resign, which was not accepted from him because an official statement cannot be delivered over the telephone. On the next day a written declaration of resignation was received from him, but that was already unnecessary since SM Eisenstein by resolution of the Executive Bureau had already been removed from the lists of Proletkult workers.11\n\nThus exploded the collective effort that had been one of the cornerstones of the film’s publicity before its opening. An article in Rabochii zritel’ in October had spelled out in rapturous terms the enormous effort devoted by the Proletkult collective over the course of ‘several years’ to the ‘collection and processing of materials’ for the project.12 The exaggeration of such claims is apparent from a stenogram of the ‘evening of reminiscences of participants of the first workers’ strikes’, in which some Old Bolsheviks haltingly attempted to think of something about their experience that would help the members of the Proletkult collective with their film. ‘Comrades,’ admitted one Comrade Shelgunov, ‘I am in great difficulties as to how to propose such images as would be interesting to the spectator. And I don’t, as a matter of fact, know where to begin.’13 The most vivid memory for him was the great weight of the revolutionary ‘literature’ (propaganda) he had had to carry around: ‘about five poods’ worth’, or eighty kilos.14 Eisenstein did take some suggestions from the reminiscences – the Old Bolsheviks remembered meetings in a graveyard and in an outhouse – but only when they stimulated his visual imagination and his affection for contradictory or surprising juxtapositions, such as revolutionary activity being conducted on the toilet. The latter scene would soon be singled out by a reviewer for Vecherniaia Moskva as an ‘unnecessary, rudely naturalistic detail’.15 ‘Rude naturalism’ lay at the very heart of Eisenstein’s cinematic thinking in Strike, however. No sequence in the film elicited as much reaction as the closing scenes, in which images from a slaughterhouse were spliced into the grisly defeat of the workers. Here is how Eisenstein would reflect upon his intentions some years later:\n\n24 Savage Junctures In the first of my films, Strike, I wanted to take the terror of the finale to a high point. The most horrible thing in the representation of blood is blood itself. In the representation of death – death itself. True, this already is a bit of a leap beyond the bounds of artistic means. But we were working with a truly tragic instance: a crushed strike and mass shooting. And so through montage I spliced into the acted scenes of slaughter pieces of real blood and death. The slaughterhouse. ‘They treat people like animals’ (IP4 452).\n\nArt, like life, was subject to the deadening effects of automatization. Only ‘real blood and death’ could break through the ordinary limitations of artistic perception, by means of montage, in this instance the juncture of fiction and blood. The twist in Eisenstein’s use of such ‘rudely naturalistic details’ as outhouses and the carnage of the abattoir, however, is that the most naturalistic image is also the one that desires to convey the abstract lesson; the real death and real blood should not just break through the barriers of art to inflict a shock upon the viewer, but must also be decoded as something more than merely ‘real’, as a verbal message: ‘They treat people like animals’. Eisenstein’s cinematic thinking twisted abstract meaning and concrete image together, sometimes in counter-intuitive ways. An ordinary metaphor compares a local thing (in this instance, the massacre of the workers) with something more distant or more abstract. At the end of Strike, tenor and vehicle seem turned almost inside out: the real blood of the slaughterhouse is brought in to supplement the inadequate realness of the acted massacre. Their blood, the film tells us about the workers, was like… real blood. As a necessary corollary to this message, the dying of the actors becomes abstract, more formal play than simulacrum of the real. ‘Montage’ was supposed to be able to bring together the disparate elements of Strike’s finale: the concrete shock of the slaughterhouse; the metaphorical message and the acted scenes of the workers’ rout. Eisenstein has become so thoroughly identified with montage in standard histories of film that it is unsettling to discover that his first attempt at film-making was found wanting precisely in that area. The director Lev Kuleshov, whose famous experiments in the early 1920s had demonstrated to a new generation of Soviet filmmakers the enormous powers of the film editor to create film meaning, claimed that Strike showed that Eisenstein was someone who knew how to work with single frames but did not yet have proper control over editing techniques:\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n25\n\nHe is a director of the frame – tasteful and expressive – less of montage and of human movement: Eisensteinian frames are always stronger than everything else, they are chiefly responsible for the success of his things. It’s sufficient to recall the flooding with water in Strike, the endless savoring of these photogenic shots, in order finally to be convinced of the good ‘eye’ of the director, of his particular love for the plastic formation of the framed shot. The montage of Strike is significantly weaker. There’s too much excess in it, there’s an as-yet-unsystematized infatuation with rapid changes. Everything is too chopped up, there are places that lack all sense of connection and, what’s most important, any unifying line of action, any unifying line of the siuzhet, is often missing. For instance, in the very weakest final section of the massacre. The associative montage – the slaughterhouse and the parallel slaughter of the workers – hardly has any right to be employed in its present form. This scene in the slaughterhouse, unprepared by a second, parallel line of action, is deficient.16\n\nWith the polemical undertone typical of the period, Kuleshov gets right to the central issue: what is it with Eisenstein’s eye? On the one hand, Kuleshov repeats the early reviewers’ criticism that the montage of Strike goes too far, demands too much, makes a real hash of the narrative: in other words, that this is a film almost inassimilable by the human eye. On the other hand, Eisenstein comes across here as old-fashioned despite himself, a master of stillness rather than motion, almost, one might say, more a painter than a filmmaker (such seems to be the sotto voce dig contained in Kuleshov’s praise of Eisenstein’s ‘good eye’). One important component of Eisenstein’s cinematic thinking, then, is a certain way of looking at the world: his eye. The scene Kuleshov points to as evidence of that eye’s strengths, the sequence in which the strikers are attacked by men wielding fire hoses, is indeed, as Kuleshov suggests, highly ‘photogenic’, even painterly. The beautiful shots of lines of water cruelly etching out the contours of flailing and flooded workers are a kind of homage in celluloid to the pre-revolutionary experiments in the development of a new aesthetic eye on the world, in particular, the Rayonist works of Mikhail Larionov and Natalya Goncharova.17 Inspired by the discovery of the x-ray and radioactivity, as well as by the miraculous achievements of cinema and photography, Larionov and Goncharova used rays of painted light and color to reveal the ‘luminosity’ of objects in works like ‘Rooster, Rayonist Study’, (Larionov, 1912) or ‘Green and Yellow Forest’ (Goncharova, 1912). 18 The motto of Larionov’s 1913 manifesto, ‘Rayonist\n\n26 Savage Junctures Painting’, had run, in part, ‘Rayonism is concerned with spatial forms that can arise from the intersection of the reflected rays of different objects’.19 Rayonism was also, as described by Larionov, an attempt to correct, scientifically, the naive impression created by previous artists that the eye is the true organ of sight: Our eye is an imperfect apparatus; we think that our sight is mainly responsible for transmitting concrete life to our cerebral centers, but in fact, it arrives there in its correct form not thanks to our sight, but thanks to other senses. A child sees objects for the first time upside down and subsequently this defect of sight is corrected by the other senses. However much he desires to, an adult cannot see an object upside down. Hence it is evident to what degree our inner conviction is important with regard to things existing in the outside world… We do not sense the object with our eye, as it is depicted conventionally in pictures and as a result of following this or that device; in fact, we do not sense the object as such. We perceive a sum of rays proceeding from a source of light; these are reflected from the object and enter our field of vision. Consequently, if we wish to paint literally what we see, then we must paint the sum of rays reflected from the object. (Bowlt 97–98)\n\nThis sense that the human eye was an imperfect organ, one in need of new education, radical transformation, or perhaps some really good prosthetic aid, was something that early Soviet culture inherited from pre-war modernism. So many advances in science and technology in the early part of the twentieth century were linked to advances in vision! As Larionov representatively gushed in 1913: ‘Luminosity owes its existence to reflected light (between objects in space this forms a kind of colored dust). The doctrine of luminosity. Radioactive rays. Ultraviolet rays. Reflectivity.’ (Bowlt 98) By the time Eisenstein was beginning his cinematic career in the 1920s, however, such breathless appreciation for the new century’s scientific and technological advances had acquired certain shadows: an increased sense of the fragility of the human body in general and the eye in particular, brought on by the traumas of war, revolution and civil war. The abrupt fragmentation of Eisenstein’s montage in the ‘slaughterhouse’ sequence could be seen as reflecting not just a long history of modernist experiments, but also several years’ worth of frayed nerves and fractured bodies. The First World War had been a watershed for ‘modernity’ across Europe; in Russia that war had been followed and exceeded\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n27\n\nby revolution and civil war. The catharsis of revolution and the violence of war had done something to the way one saw the world; that was the assumption of artists everywhere, though of course the major discoveries of modernism – Cubism, Futurism, the Black Square; the ornate and sometimes ornamental languages of Symbolism and Acmeism; the cinema – had already arrived before the onset of war. Armed with all the prosthetic machinery available to the eye in the early twentieth century – x-ray, stereoscope, camera – modernism preached with ferocious intensity the gospel of seeing life anew. Hope must lie in the prosthesis, for the human body alone had been revealed to be a very fragile thing. Years of war had left behind a legacy of horrified fascination with the mutilations inflicted by one side on the other and in particular on the violence that disfigured faces: On the way into the garden, I spied on the town fields a mass of Bolshevik corpses: the heads of these corpses had been chopped into several pieces, so that it was difficult to make out to which individuals these bodies had belonged… The Cossacks disfigured the bodies of the Bolsheviks so that the relatives of the dead would not be able to identify the corpse.20\n\nIn the literature of the 1920s, this aspect of Civil War culture – the constant threat of comrades being rendered ‘beyond recognition’ by the other side – was to become a recurring motif in, for instance, Isaak Babel’s stories of the Polish Campaign of 1920 (Konarmiia, 1925), stories in which damage to faces and eyes is a central theme.21 Disfigurement is something that happens most fundamentally to a figure, a face, and in the early Soviet period that disfigurement occurred in two vital modes: literally, as physical destruction visited upon faces; and figuratively, in the various attempts to move art beyond the figure into the realms of abstraction. These modes, strangely enough, intersect: in the language, for example, of Malevich’s manifestoes, in which the artist’s desire to transcend figural representation is coupled with virulent attacks on bodies of all kinds, especially ‘female hams’.22 The figure itself – the body as such – becomes a disgusting wound that art must move beyond. At the center of the problem of the figure lies the face. The face is that part of the body we try most fervently to exempt from corporeality: to render, as far as is possible, immaterial. Those wounds or flaws which force us to acknowledge the face as flesh (a missing eye, a harelip, even a badly running nose) owe their peculiar\n\n28 Savage Junctures power to horrify to the obscene connection they draw between the person (thought of most comfortably as somehow trans-corporeal) and that person’s all-too-perishable and material body. Such physical abuses are a kind of vandalism performed against the trompe l’oeil perspective of a corporeal fresco: the real depths of the human face revealed to us by violence or disease reduce the human being to flesh, which in the metaphysical sense amounts to being reduced to mere surface. And if the face is the part of the body traditionally linked to individual identity and the ‘false depth’ of spiritual trompe l’oeil, then the eyes may be said to be the ‘face’ of the face. They are at once the most sentimentalized part of the body, that part that must remain least tainted by signs of fleshliness, the organ most like a machine (all those diagrams of clean rays traversing the lens of the eye and etching trees or stick-figures of people upside down on the retina: just a camera obscura like any other…) and, as Luís Buñuel would show the world in Un Chien andalou (1928), the place where a single pass of a razor blade, reasserting the eye’s identity not just as machine or ‘spirit’, but as meat, is able to inspire the most horror and disgust in the viewer. The eye, in short, is a most perplexing organ, a nexus where abstract and concrete meet, sometimes with disturbing results. This nexus is absolutely central to Eisenstein’s Strike, a film very concerned with the paradoxical nature of the eye. In an early scenario the horrific climax of the film was to come precisely from the transformation of an eye into meat: The butcher moves past the camera (panning) swinging his bloody rope. A crowd runs to a fence, breaks through it and hides behind it (in two or three shots). Arms fall into the frame (film-frame). The head of the bull is severed from the trunk. A volley (of bullets). Soldiers’ feet walk away from the camera. Blood floats on the water, discoloring it. (Close-up) Blood gushes from the slit throat of the bull. Blood is pouring from a basin (held by hands) into a pail. Dissolve from a truck loaded with pails of blood to a passing truck loaded with scrap-iron.\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n29\n\nThe bull’s tongue is pulled through the slit throat (to prevent the convulsions from damaging the tongue). The soldiers’ feet walk away from the camera (seen at a further distance than previously). The bull’s skin is stripped off. 1,500 bodies (lie) at the foot of the cliff. Two skinned bulls’ heads. A hand lying in a pool of blood. (Close-up) Filling the entire screen: the eye of a dead bull. (Title) THE END.23\n\nAs finally edited, Strike’s concluding sequence ended not with the eye of a dead bull, but rather with an extreme close-up, ‘filling the entire screen’ just as its ocular antecedent was supposed to, of the eyes of a living worker who enjoins us to ‘Remember, Proletariat!’ Figure 1. ‘Remember, Proletariat!’ (Strike)\n\nThese eyes are, however, haunted by their dead bovine predecessors. The eye of a dead ox, far from being an unprepared distraction from Strike’s line of action, is in fact the essential hieroglyph under which Strike takes its place in the canon of Russian modernism. Earlier scenarios not only had Strike ending on a dead bull’s eye, but also very nearly beginning with that image. In an early version of the prologue, the eye of the ox floats in a bowl of soup fed to workers in the factory that will soon erupt into spontaneous political activity:24 Shot 37. The hungry faces of the workers, looking down. Shot 38. Close-up. The surface of the soup; on it float a piece of potato and an ox’s eye. The eye approaches the camera. American diaphragm.\n\n30 Savage Junctures Shot 39. The eye comes to life; on it appears… a lorgnette. the American diaphragm opens slightly. (IP6 34)\n\nThis rather surrealist scene would have made very visible indeed the various paradoxes underlying the nature of the eye. Whatever else an eye in a bowl of soup may do, it certainly announces its difference from a potato; perhaps the essence of that difference is that the eye, an organ which as we have seen carries the weight of our human desire to transcend the flesh, resists the transformation into meat. Even if thoroughly dead, the eye seems haunted by life. In Eisenstein’s prologue, that ‘undead’ nature of the eye becomes reality, as the ox’s eye in the soup metamorphoses into the living eye of a human being (since that human being is an unpleasant factory official, the stench of death may not totally disappear upon this transition). The eye of the ox acquires here a second double, however: the eye is compared explicitly to the ‘American diaphragm’, a visual pun constructed on the notion of the ‘iris’, one of DW Griffith’s favorite means of winking in and out of scenes. Not only does the eye approach the camera physically (or, more accurately, the camera approaches the ox’s eye) – but it also approaches the camera in a more essential, if more ineffable, way. The eye of the ox is itself, strangely enough, a ‘camera eye’. The comparison between camera eye and eye of the ox has a history that predates Eisenstein. It was a fancy at one time that the last image seen by a murder victim would be imprinted on the dead person’s retina and this theory was tested on the eyes of slaughtered oxen.25 Fascination with the comparison between fleshly eye and camera eye endured and in the early twentieth century left its own indelible print on the Soviet avant-garde. The ‘cinema eye’ (or ‘kino-glaz’) was a famous component of early Soviet cinematic theory and practice. Dziga Vertov, avant-garde proponent of the documentary, dedicated several manifestoes to the ‘cinema eye’, and in fact at the same time Eisenstein was making Strike, Vertov was filming a feature-length film entitled Kino-glaz (Cinema-eye) that he would later accuse Eisenstein of imitating.26 Dziga Vertov subscribed wholeheartedly to the theory that the human eye was, as Larionov had put it, ‘an imperfect apparatus’. Vertov (born Denis Arkadievich Kaufman in 1896) had studied at the Psycho-Neurological Institute in Petrograd before turning to the cinema, a medium that appealed to his scientific interest in human perception as well as to his enthusiasm for revolutionary aesthetics. He quickly became a great champion of the newsreel\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n31\n\nand in the 1920s engaged in a polemic with Eisenstein over the relative value of ‘acted’ and ‘non-acted’ film. Vertov’s pro­ grammatic manifesto (‘Cine-Eyes. Revolution’, from 1923) is a dizzying, Futurist-inspired hymn to the superiority of the camera lens over the myopic human eye: We cannot make our eyes any better than they have been made but we can go on perfecting the camera forever[…] All the weaknesses of the human eye have been revealed. We reaffirm the Cine-Eye. (Film Factory 91)\n\nThe perfectibility of the camera eye makes it the ideal antidote to the nearsighted imperfections of the human eye, which languishes in a kind of evolutionary dead end. Vertov’s new man sings the praises of a kind of cinematic centaur: ‘I am the Cine-Eye. I am a mechanical eye. I the machine show you the world as only I can see it.(Film Factory 93) A new kind of eye is needed because there is all too much that the old ‘meat’ eye does not manage to see at all. The mechanized appendage, the eye that will no longer be limited by the failings of flesh-and-blood, the eye that can see action, no matter how fast and that can construct points of view impossible for mere mortals, is an appealing object (or subject). When examined closely, however, the ‘kino-glaz’ turns out to be haunted by the flesh it would leave behind. What – or who – is this ‘cine-eye’? Camera lens, camera operator, film editor, spectator? All at points seem to be alluded to; no single identity works all the time. Sometimes the very fervor of the polemic makes it difficult to see how ill-defined the object of Vertov’s attention has become. The junction, in short, between the machine and the flesh, the concrete physical ‘I’ and the abstraction of an ‘I’ as a new point-of-view – all these joints are ragged. The stitches where the cyborg has been sewn together, like Frankenstein’s monster, are blurry enough that it is unclear where machine ends and flesh begins, or how much of ‘machine’ or of ‘flesh’ is ideal in order to achieve the new vision promised by the ‘kino-glaz’. The fleshly prehistory of the cyborg is revealed by the manifesto’s opening lines: LOOK AROUND YOU THERE! I can see as every child can see:\n\n32 Savage Junctures THE INTESTINES ARE TUMBLING OUT. THE ENTRAILS OF EXPERIENCE FROM THE STOMACH OF CINEMA DISEMBOWELED ON THE REEF OF THE REVOLUTION, they are dragged along leaving a trail of blood on the ground, TREMBLING with fear and revulsion. IT IS ALL OVER. (Film Factory 90)\n\nThe hymn to the machine opens with an image of the body as some-thing that must be sliced open in order to be remade. The price of the new kind of vision is high. In Vertov’s manifesto, the human eye is scornfully set aside in favor of the superior mechanical eye, the ‘cine-eye’, but the transformation into cyborg, as we have seen, is unevenly accomplished and the flesh (or the human ‘I’ as opposed to the machine ‘eye’) lingers on. It is well to remember, after all, that cinema, this brave new mechanized and ‘cyborgian’ mode of viewing the world, is fundamentally dependent on the failings of human flesh as much as it is on the advantages of the machine: the illusion of movement is made possible only by the inability of the human eye and brain to distinguish images shown at a rate faster than about 16 frames/second. That effect may be a kind of limp in the human perceptual apparatus, but without the limp, the cinema could not exist and Vertov’s cinematic centaur would no longer be able to place you ‘who were created by me, in a most remarkable room that never existed before and that I also created’ (92) or to achieve any of its other tricks, for that matter. Clearly the exact nature of the joints between machine and flesh – not to mention theoretical consistency – mattered less to Dziga Vertov than conveying his enthusiasm for the new. Certainly in his own cinematic experiments of the 1920s, Vertov delighted in putting the art of the camera through its paces and the films he produced are remarkable for their good humor as well as for their unexpected images and combinations of images. In 1924 he began his documentary Kino-Glaz with the claim that it would catch life ‘vrasplokh’, a term meaning ‘unawares’ but also ‘unexpectedly’, and\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n33\n\nindeed, throughout Cine-Eye the tension persists between presenting a documentary portrayal of Soviet life and showing everyday things unexpectedly, defamiliarization being wielded here not so much for the creation of high art as for amusement (‘see what a camera can do’) and edification (‘see what you have overlooked before’). At issue in this tension is nothing less than the nature of truth and the role of manipulation, or of play, in the production of that truth. One of the sequences in Kino-Glaz where Vertov’s brand of defamiliarization is most clearly demonstrated is devoted, as it happens, to the production of beef. During this section of the film, Young Pioneers wage their ongoing campaign against price-gouging in the market; we see them putting up posters encouraging people to shop in the Cooperatives rather than in the dirty, expensive markets, and we see the same earnest children confronting various unsavory-looking peasants about the quality and prices of their wares. The chief lesson is directed at the thin, beaten-down mother of one of the Pioneers (a girl known as ‘Kopchushka’): disgusted by the meat for sale in the market and discouraged by its price, the mother is inspired by a poster her own daughter has pasted on the wall to retrace her steps and go this time not to the market, but to the Cooperative, where everything is modern, cheap and fresh. Her steps are ‘retraced’ literally: she walks backward. The film is being run backward for us, in that most popular of early cinema tricks. The Cine-Eye wishes to show us what we cannot otherwise usually see: the proof that, as a title boasts, ‘The Cooperative receives its meat directly from the slaughterhouse’. For our benefit, therefore, the next title announces, ‘The Cine-Eye runs time backwards’. This is truly to be a ‘defamiliarization’ of a trip to the slaughterhouse and, yet more ambitious, of the moment of death, that point where the one-way direction of time in our everyday universe is most unforgiving. Dziga Vertov, however, transforms the slaughterhouse into a playroom. He shows us swinging slabs of beef; the titles identify them as ‘that which 20 minutes ago was still an ox’. (Sure enough, the very meat seems still to be quivering.) Then the games really begin: ‘Let’s return the ox his innards’. Gradually we realize we are to be witnesses to the most profound cinematic trick of all: death run backwards. The butchers fold the intestines back into the cow, a procedure not unlike packing a suitcase. The titles keep us moving: ‘Let’s put his hide back on him’. Always that tone of omnipotent good humor: see what I can do, with my ‘cine-eye’! His skin is smoothed back on his body and zipped up magically by the backwards-moving knives. His parts\n\n34 Savage Junctures reassembled, the ox has arrived at the center of the miracle; the ox lies dead on the floor; then his legs twitch and kick; the ox leaps to his feet and the hammer flies away from his head: ‘The ox comes to life.’ The knife is ‘unsharpened’, and the cattle move out of the slaughtering rooms and back into the holding pen (and someone steals a little last milk from a cow). Even at this point, the fantasy continues; the cattle are loaded backwards onto cattle-cars and the train takes them back into the countryside, where they rejoin their herd and motion once again begins to move forward in its usual manner. (To some degree, in fact, the film becomes stuck in the countryside; instead of returning to Kopchushka’s mother’s shopping expedition, the film moves on to the subject of a Pioneer summer camp and the broader topic of friendship between town and country.) In this sequence the most perplexing questions of life, death and cinema’s role in both are brought into play: Vertov, like Eisenstein, turns to a slaughterhouse for the footage that most dramatically demonstrates the power of the movie camera to triumph over the usual limitations of time and space (in order to achieve, as Eisenstein put it, a ‘leap beyond the bounds of artistic means’). The mechanical magic of the camera-eye is applied as a corrective to the most fleshly flesh of a slaughtered cow. But where Eisenstein was counting on the slaughterhouse shots to shock the audience, to force it to see what previously it merely ‘recognized’, Vertov presents us with a slaughterhouse that turns time into a game – into ‘child’s play’.27 Life is not only ‘caught unawares’ in Kino-Glaz (as the film’s motto promises), but it is created from the very material of death. Both uses of the slaughterhouse (to inspire horror or to inspire delight) bring with them certain ideological hazards, however. Eisenstein’s metaphorical montage ‘they slaughtered the workers like oxen’ puts the workers into a strikingly passive position, while Vertov’s metonymic chain of backwards motion ends up in what should (spatially, temporally and ideologically) be marked as the past: the pastoral idyll in the country meadow, where the renascent ox can once again kick up his heels with his friends. The kino-glaz, in the hands of Sergei Eisenstein, becomes, I have suggested above, the eye of a dead ox. The eyes on which the film closes – the eyes of the proletarian ‘educator’ – should be seen, I think, as a composite, haunted by its vanished predecessors: the eye-as-meat, the eye-as-camera, the eye that oscillates so uncannily between life and death, abstract metaphor and concrete flesh. The task of the dead bull that haunts the end of Strike is to make memory possible for the working classes: ‘Remember, Proletariat!’\n\nBeyond Recognition: Strike and the Eye of the Abattoir\n\n35\n\nEisenstein needed to integrate ‘pieces of real blood’ into Strike’s final montage sequence because he was worried that without the blood, the film would not achieve the necessary effect. The problem he was combating was the same peril that Shklovsky had termed ‘automatization’. Shklovsky, as we have seen, proposed that human vision, in its struggle against automatization and algebraization, be renewed in order to rescue life itself from the threat of ‘nothingness’. Shklovsky took his examples from Tolstoy, not only from the description of innocent Natasha’s visit to the opera, but also from the numerous instances in which, through the eyes of an outsider, customs (like flogging) that seem ‘normal’ to their audience only because that audience has ceased to ‘see’ them at all are shown in all their gruesome, often absurd, detail. There are ghosts haunting all levels of this argument, however: behind the Opera and in the wings of Shklovsky’s own discussion, lurks the specter of the slaughterhouse. Of all the examples he culls from Tolstoy, the one that Shklovsky cites in greatest length is a passage narrated by the horse ‘Kholstomer’, from the story of that name. The defamiliarizing equine point-ofview teaches us as efficiently as Tolstoy knows how that ‘people treat (not just workers, but) animals like animals’. In fact, in Tolstoy’s story the most direct mention of those perceptual effects that will later capture the interest and attention of Shklovsky occurs in a part of the tale not cited by Shklovsky: poor Kholstomer learns about defamiliarization at the hands of the people who slaughter him. It is then, as he feels his blood spill out of his neck, feeling ‘more surprised than afraid’, that ‘everything became new for him’.28 The death of Kholstomer could be read as suggesting that if we would see the world anew – if we hope to move ‘beyond recognition’ – a sacrifice must be made. The use of such blood rites to provide a sense of the ‘new’ has a long tradition in human culture, but the difference between the slaughter of Kholstomer and other forms of public sacrifice is that the effect is worked on a different audience. It is not the sacrificers – the slaughterers, the embedded audience – who are to benefit from this surging forth of ‘real blood’; these groups, on the contrary, must treat the sacrifice as entirely routine. Rather, the miracle of defamiliarization and its renewal of life is worked on the victim itself (the slaughtered beast) and on the audience at second remove, the readers or viewers.29 The slaughterers themselves treat their work like any other; their sober routine marks them as part of the great machine, which, it turns out, can be seen as the necessary setting for defamiliarization – the very escape from automatization! – to occur. Tolstoy’s\n\n36 Savage Junctures stories of how perception can be renewed, or defamiliarized, often hinge on a close encounter with one of the two poles of human existence: birth (or the unpolluted and thus ‘strange’ vision of a child or child-like innocent) and death, which for everybody, horses and all, comes as something truly ‘new’ and not yet experienced to the point of automatization. I would suggest that one of the important shifts undergone as the twentieth century reworks the notion of defamiliarization is precisely the focus on the machine, on deautomatization as something necessary because of all of the ‘automatization’ one is surrounded by and yet, paradoxically, made possible by that very automatized context. In this sense, perhaps Shklovsky marks the end of the old era as much as the start of the new, for in his version of the task at hand, ‘automatization’ is the demonic force that overtakes us, something we must struggle against in order to be able to live again. In the Soviet 1920s, however, automation has discovered its positive, modern side: or rather, we find ourselves oscillating between the positive and negative sides of mechanization (between the inspiring and the deadening aspects of ‘automatization’). Automatization and slaughter find a common language in the twentieth century. Tolstoy underscores the usefulness of the slaughtered horse (as opposed to the uselessness in death of most humans); this theme of the efficiency of slaughter, as precursor to industrialization per se, also marks the work of an early Soviet modernist, Boris Pil’niak, who in a story from the early 1920s has Arina, the woman whose strangely compelling but at first indescribable aroma turns out to have its source in the blood of the slaughterhouse she runs, explain her job in terms of efficiency: ‘The skin is used for leather, the fats are used in soap-making, we feed the proteins to the pigs. The bones and sinews go to the glue works. Then the bones are ground to make fertilizer. We waste nothing here.’ Arina’s hands were covered with blood; the ground was running with blood; workmen were skinning "
