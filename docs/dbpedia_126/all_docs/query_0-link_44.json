        "text": "Mary Pickford occupied a precarious place in the 1930s. Clearly, she was no longer the undisputed Queen of the Movies, but she was financially comfortable and still warmly regarded. The 1933 drama Secrets would be her final film, but at the time, no one knew it. As far as the movie magazines were concerned, Pickford was taking a break until she could find a suitable script. And besides, she was hardly sitting by twiddling her thumbs: Pickford was still highly involved with United Artists and charitable work. She also dabbled in radio and expressed interest in the fledgling medium of television, but today we’ll be talking about her brief stint as a novelist.\n\nPickford put out two books during the 1930s. The first was Why Not Try God?, a short book about Pickford’s spiritual convictions. The second was a novel, The Demi-Widow. Technically, Pickford didn’t write The Demi-Widow on her own. It was ghostwritten by Belle Burns Gromer, a prominent short story author of the time.\n\nThe plot is fluff incarnate. Pickford’s heroine is Coralee, a twenty-year-old widow and American-born singer who struggles to eke out a living for herself and her toddler son in 1930s Paris. Coralee was raised with all the niceties of an aristocratic upbringing, but now on hard times, she lives in a tenement flat. Gifted with angelic beauty and a lovely singing voice, Coralee endeavors to find success on the stage, but her nerves and lack of confidence undermine her auditions.\n\nLuckily, Coralee’s desperation is matched by that of a stage producer whose star lead has abandoned his upcoming show. Unimpressed with Coralee’s mousy, genteel manner and convinced the public will not take to it either, the producer comes up with an alter-ego: Mademoiselle Coco, a glamorous femme fatale who loves and leaves ’em. To give her a publicity boost, it’s leaked to the press that Coco was romantically involved with Camillo, a rich young Argentine who recently died in a plane crash. After all, the gentleman in question was a ladykiller and he’s not here to dispute anything.\n\nAt least, that’s what everyone thought. Turns out the Argentine playboy survived the crash and now he’s angered to hear his name being used for such crass purposes. Camillo confronts Coco, only for the two to develop an intense attraction despite his wounded pride and her desperation to convince the world she’s a man-eater.\n\nUnexpected love is hardly Coco’s only problem. Her sister-in-law is dead set on taking Coco’s son away from her, convinced he’s being brought up as a savage. An ardent Soviet official becomes one of her more persistent admirers– and a dangerous one. The producer’s former star wants to steal Coco’s thunder. A nosy journalist smells a rat and believes Coco isn’t the femme fatale she claims to be. And Coco is finding it harder and harder to keep her secret from Camillo, who wants her but would also prefer a woman who’s into childrearing and the simple life. You know– the kind of woman Coralee actually is.\n\nPublished in August 1935, The Demi-Widow received fair if unenthusiastic notices, though according to film historian Scott Eyman, its financial success could best be described as “indifferent.” While there was initial excitement– Pickford was greeted by a crowd of 17,000 at a Los Angeles department store when she visited to autograph copies– royalties dried up by 1936.\n\nPickford seems to have had her heart set on getting The Demi-Widow turned into a movie from the beginning, though not for herself surprisingly enough. The May 1935 of Hollywood Magazine claims Pickford intended the novel to be turned into a stage or screen vehicle for opera soprano Grace Moore, who dabbled with film stardom in the 1930s. According to Eyman, Pickford paid screenwriter Noel Langley one thousand dollars a week to write a treatment, though she never commissioned a full screenplay from whatever he produced for her. Pickford continued pushing for a cinematic adaptation into the 1940s: a 1948 issue of The Film Daily claimed she would be producing a cinematic Demi-Widow in France as opposed to previous plans to shoot it in Britain.\n\nNothing ever came of Pickford’s quest to turn her pages into celluloid, which is a shame considering a film version of The Demi-Widow would likely have been more engaging than its source material. What bothers me most about The Demi-Widow is its tendency to tell rather than show. For example, Coco’s rise to prominence is not dramatized by depicting her first evening before an audience. We never sweat with her or viscerally experience her triumph. No, the book just tells us, “Coco appeared before an audience and she was great” more or less. Pickford and Gromer never mine the book’s multiple antagonistic forces for suspense either. Coco’s dreadful sister-in-law lurks around the edges, but never becomes a true threat. More potent menace emerges in Coco’s angry Soviet admirer or fallen star rival, but their enmity towards the pure and good Coco is quickly evaporated before they can make the story more interesting.\n\nMaybe my big issue is Coco herself. On paper, this character is imbued with comic potential: she’s a good girl pretending to be bad for a noble enough cause. That’s a plot that’s hardly original, but it can be entertaining when done right. However, the book is too saintly about Coco to get her into any genuinely hilarious scrapes. Or maybe the comedy was just a bit too genteel for my nasty, cynical tastes.\n\nI did like the enemies to lovers thing going on between Coco and Camillo, though. He’s a hotheaded Latin lover type who Rudolph Valentino could have played in his sleep. The scenes with them falling in love despite themselves were very sweet, and I did genuinely care about them as a couple. The book also has an undeniable escapist element to it. We get lots of descriptions of delicious picnics at picturesque locations and all the glamor of interwar Parisian nightlife.\n\nSo is The Demi-Widow worth your time? If you’re a Pickford fan, you’ll absolutely want to read it. As a book in and of itself, it’s cute but slight, and really only going to appeal to people interested in Depression-era popular culture and Old Hollywood. It would have made a good movie had it been adapted– maybe with Lubitsch directing, though that may not have been likely given how Pickford and Lubitsch got on poorly when collaborating on Rosita in 1923. Such is life.\n\nHave you read The Demi-Widow? If so, what did you think and do you believe it could have made a fine movie?\n\nSources:\n\n“Along the Rialto with Phil M.

Born Liu Tsong Wong in 1905 to a San Francisco family of second-generation Chinese immigrants, she was an avid film fan as a child. Dreaming of stardom, she secured her first job as an extra in the 1919 Alla Nazimova film The Red Lantern. By the early 1920s, her name was known to film fans due to her distinctive screen presence and youthful beauty, but due to the racist attitudes of the time, Wong’s stardom was often stunted. Due to concerns about miscegenation, she could only kiss her leading man if he was the same race as she. Major roles she was perfect for often went to white actresses by default, even if the character in question was Asian. And often times the roles she did land were either small or stereotypical.\n\nWong has experienced something of a re-evaluation recently– she’s become the first Asian-American on US currency and several books, both fiction and non-fiction, have been published about her in the last few years– but she still isn’t universally known, even among classic film fans. When two fellow classic film fans I know in real life saw me reading a biography about her, they told me they’d never even heard her name. Some critics continue to disparage her as a “dragon lady” who took demeaning roles for a paycheck. Others see her as a trailblazer who fought as hard as she could for better onscreen representation of Chinese and Chinese-descended characters at a time when Hollywood felt no compulsion to offer such.\n\nI’d been aware of Wong for years, though I never knew much about her life or work outside of a few key silent films. She often appears in movie magazines of the 1920s, presented as a madcap flapper in the latest fashions. For this marathon, I read biographical material on Wong while I went through my selected five films to give extra context to her work.\n\nOkay, I do have a confession to make. The maximum number of films you’re allowed to have seen with your selected star is three. When I signed up, I could only come up with three films I knew I had seen with Wong: The Toll of the Sea, The Thief of Bagdad, and Shanghai Express. I felt this blogathon would be a great opportunity to see some Wong pictures that had been on my watchlist for a while now, like Piccadilly and Daughter of Shanghai. It wasn’t until I combed through Wong’s IMDB page weeks later– after watching three of the five prescribed films and reading an entire biography– that I realized she was also in the 1924 Peter Pan, Mr. Wu, and Old San Francisco, three movies I vaguely recall watching as a college undergrad. And by vaguely recall, I mean I only know I saw two out of three of them because they’re logged on my IMDB account. As for Peter Pan, apparently she was Tiger Lily in that (I don’t recall a thing about her performance there), but all I remember from that film was that Ernest Torrance was Captain Hook and that the Darlings’ dog Nana looked like a Cthulu-esque abomination.\n\nAhem. Anyway, even if I don’t meet the hard letter of the “3 films max” rule, I still say I fit the spirit. I can recall exactly three performances of Anna May Wong’s, no more than that. I may as well have had those other films erased from my memory, except for…\n\nWith that out of the way, here are the films I actually remembering seeing with Wong before the blogathon, as well as a brief overview of her life and career threaded throughout:\n\nThe Toll of the Sea was not Wong’s big break as a movie star (that would belong to the anthology film Bits of Life, where she played opposite Lon Chaney), but it is the film that cemented her fame. The second Technicolor feature film, the movie’s story is nothing special, just a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in China instead of Japan. If anything elevates it above being a mere historical curiosity, it’s Wong’s tender performance as a seduced and abandoned young woman.\n\nWong was still in her teens when she made this film, so her performance is not as polished as her later work. However, she is still sensitive and touching, emphasizing the tragedy of Lotus Blossom’s situation as a woman shunned by her own culture for pursuing a relationship with a white man and similarly rejected by the white Americans for her ethnicity. Wong’s girlishly humorous moments in the first half of the movie only throw the constant grief and pain of the latter part into harsher relief. (At the time, Wong’s crying scenes were considered noteworthy both among critics and in Hollywood. As it turned out, Wong was one of a select number of actors who could cry on cue.) In the end, Wong walks away with the film, an impressive feat considering how young she was.\n\nUnfortunately, a leading role in one hit film did not mean Wong was suddenly going to be headlining tons of movies. Throughout the 1920s, her Hollywood career largely saw her in supporting parts, many of them steeped in orientalist stereotyping. The Thief of Bagdad is considered among her more memorable roles in this period, even if it’s a relatively minor one in the context of such a grand fantasy epic and is still stereotypical in nature. Wong plays a beautiful Mongolian slave girl in the Bagdad palace. While she is supposed to serve the princess, she conspires with the ambitious Mongolian prince (Sojin) to overthrow the Bagdad royals. It’s not much of a part and a lesser actress would have been overtaken by the character’s crazy costume and hairpieces, but Wong lends a playful sensual dimension to the role, particularly in a sequence where Fairbanks’ thief has a knife at her back. Wong’s response oscillates between fear and flirtation, using erotic charm to get herself out of the situation, not realizing Fairbanks has already left the room.\n\nThroughout the mid-1920s, Wong continued to act, though the roles weren’t getting any better. In the late 1920s, Wong grew weary of the situation and leapt across the Atlantic to seek better opportunities in Europe. Black Americans like Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson had done the same, finding less racial barriers abroad. Like Robeson, Wong mostly worked in England after a brief stint in Germany. When the talkie revolution swept through the movie industry, Wong worked on her vocal delivery and was able to make the transition with little trouble. In the early 1930s, more famous than ever due to her European journey, Wong decided to give Hollywood another go. She landed a contract with Paramount.\n\nOne of the better roles she got during this period was the prostitute Hui-Fei in Josef von Sternberg’s 1932 potboiler Shanghai Express. Having rewatched the film recently, I have two conclusions: 1) this movie is absolutely style over substance and 2) Wong walks away with the entire thing. The actual main storyline about Marlene Dietrich’s Shanghai Lily and her devotion to the stuffy nitwit doctor played by Clive Brook is melodramatic boilerplate only elevated to classic status by Dietrich’s charisma and the smoky, glamorous atmosphere of Von Sternberg’s direction.\n\nOf all the characters, Wong’s is the only one who measures up to Dietrich in any way. The two women play off one another well due to a shared sense of cynicism towards a world that looks down on them as “fallen women.” However, just as Lily’s self-sacrificial love for Dr. Harvey reveals nobility beneath her “bad girl” persona, Hui-Fei displays similar hidden depths. She has her own sense of honor and obligation, viewing the Eurasian rebel leader Henry Chang played by Warner Oland as a menace to her country (“The government has offered a price of 20,000 for his capture – alive or dead. It will be a great day for China when that price is paid.”) and ultimately killing him after he rapes her. When Lily thanks her– Chang was going to force Lily to become his mistress in exchange for her beloved’s life– Hui-Fei makes it clear she didn’t kill Chang for Lily’s sake, but for her own.\n\nUnfortunately, Hollywood continued to be stingy with good roles for Wong. The greatest heartbreak of her career was being rejected for the role of O-lan in MGM’s The Good Earth, an adaptation of the Pearl Buck novel of the same name. The tale of the hard lives of Chinese farmers, this was a film that largely treated the Chinese with sympathy, yet the major roles were claimed by white actors. Wong was refused the part because her leading man would be Paul Muni (a Jewish actor who initially quipped “I’m about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover” when offered the role) and the Production Code forbade actors of different races from kissing on-screen. Luise Rainer got the role instead.\n\nWong largely worked in B-pictures as the decade wore on. In the late 1930s, she visited China, a longtime dream of hers. However, she was shocked when her reception in China was rather cool, sometimes even hostile. Chinese critics felt Wong was a disgrace, taking on stereotypical and sexualized roles that made Chinese womanhood appear loose and wicked. Wong understood the criticism– she shared it herself– but it still stung, especially since she often fought for better representation of Chinese and Chinese-American characters in Hollywood projects.\n\nDuring World War II, Wong appeared in propaganda films showing the Chinese in a heroic light and did all she could to support the war effort, but her stardom was on the wane. When her Paramount contract lapsed, it was not renewed and she was stuck making films for poverty row studios. Still, Wong worked hard and donated her salary to organizations like United China Relief.\n\nIn the immediate postwar period, Wong stopped working in the movies for a few years. She converted her home into a series of apartments for rent. She returned to film in 1949, appearing in a small role in the movie Impact. Throughout the 1950s, she worked in television. This work was initially promising: Wong got the lead in her own series, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, the first TV program to feature an Asian-American protagonist. A mystery show, it lasted only ten episodes before cancellation. Like much early television, the program is now lost. For the rest of the decade, she had to settle for supporting parts.\n\nWong was unfortunately an alcoholic in her later life and this contributed to her early death of a heart attack at age 56. What makes her ultimate end so tragic is that she may have been on the verge of a comeback. She was offered the role of Madame Liang in the film version of Flower Drum Song, but had to decline due to her poor health.\n\nMy general impression of Wong from the above three films and my reading about her life is that she was a beautiful actress with great presence too often under-served by the material she was given. For my five films, I tried to select films from a variety of genres, as well as from different phases of her career in order to get a fuller picture of her talents and screen image.\n\nDaughter of Shanghai (dir. Robert Florey, 1937)\n\nWhen antiques dealer Mr. Lang (John Patterson) refuses to aid a human smuggling ring, he and his daughter Lan Ying Lin (Wong) end up kidnapped by the villains. They shoot Lang dead, but Lan Ying Lin manages to escape. Swearing justice for her father’s death, she goes undercover to track down the smugglers’ leader, disguising herself as a dancer to infiltrate a dive on a Central American island. She crosses paths with Kim Lee (Philip Ahn), a G-man also on the trail of the criminal gang. The two become reluctant allies, all the while never suspecting the ringleader– and the one who most wants to see them dead– might be someone they know and trust…\n\nBy the late 1930s, Wong was mostly relegated to B-movies. While lacking the clout of A-pictures, some of my favorite movies from the classic period are B-productions as they often had more freedom to experiment or portray things you wouldn’t see in a more expensive movie that needed to be “safe” in order to return the hefty investment. Daughter of Shanghai is one of the most enjoyable B-movies you’re likely to find, not just for its delightfully pulpy narrative but also for its progressive depiction of Asian-Americans as heroes.\n\nWong plays a true badass in this movie. She’s smart, she’s independent, and she doesn’t take anyone’s crap. Wong herself was reportedly delighted with the role, happy to play a Chinese-American who wasn’t treacherous or shady, but openly noble and brave. She makes a great team with Philip Ahn’s G-man, and it’s also great to see her allowed to have a romantic relationship with another character that doesn’t end in misery and/or death.\n\nThe film itself is a delightful ride with all the pulp trimmings: near-death situations, last-minute escapes, dangerous traveling conditions, fistfights. The story is almost paced like a condensed movie serial and it’s never dull. Robert Florey was in the director’s chair, so there’s style to burn. Interestingly, though this film was made while the Production Code was in full force, it often has the feel of a pre-code melodrama due to its emphasis on seduction and potent danger.\n\nThere’s no denying this film is a low budget affair. Shot in a month, it’s hardly a Von Sternberg arthouse object. I don’t care. This movie is a hell of a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great evening watch when they want to be entertained but don’t have two hours to burn. There are lengthy, expensive Netflix series which don’t have the entertainment value this thing does.\n\nDaughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan, 1931)\n\nExotic dancer Princess Ling Moy (Wong) discovers her long-lost father is none other than the notorious Fu Manchu (Warner Oland). Before they have time to do any normal father-daughter bonding activities, he is mortally wounded while killing his nemesis, Sir John Petrie, who he wrongly believes was responsible for the death of his family during the Boxer Rebellion. As he lies dying, Fu Manchu makes Ling Moy promise to kill the rest of the Petrie clan as revenge for their own slaughtered loved ones. Ling Moy swears to fulfill her father’s last request, but her quest for revenge will be complicated by her burgeoning romantic feelings for Petrie’s son Ronald (Bramwell Fletcher) and the efforts of Chinese detective Ah Kee (Sessue Hayakawa).\n\nDaughter of the Dragon was Wong’s first movie under her Paramount contract. In terms of Asian representation, Daughter of the Dragon is the polar opposite of Daughter of Shanghai. This earlier film is far more negative, depicting Ling Moy as a seductress out to snap up clueless white men and murder/mutilate any love rivals without mercy. I cannot imagine Wong was too happy with this film, considering her dismay at the continued Hollywood-approved stereotyping of Chinese people as wicked deceivers.\n\nAdmittedly, the film does have camp value, not unlike the similarly orientalist The Mask of Fu Manchu with Boris Karloff. The production is dripping with over the top Chinese-inspired design and Ling Moy’s costumes are eye-catching. It’s clear the film’s main purpose is not exploration of character or theme, but providing the audience with vicarious thrills and chills as our “heroes” (I cannot put enough quotes around that word, since the so-called good guys are universally boring and mostly passive– also I do not get why Ling Moy is so into Ronald, he’s about as sexy as soggy fish and chips) evade gruesome yet creative death traps. This is certainly a case where the bad guys steal the show, simply because they have so much more drive and seem to be having so much more fun.\n\nThe best I can say about Daughter of the Dragon is that it never drags and Wong never phones it in, though the material is undeniably beneath her. Wong is able to give her character fleeting glimmers of melancholy. You get the sense Ling Moy’s wanted a father figure all her life and once she’s given one, she dedicates herself to pleasing him to fill that void– even if pleasing him means committing multiple murders. This makes Ling Moy a bit more human than she likely was on paper, but it’s not enough to really combat the nonsense in the script or to magically make the movie good. I can’t say I recommend it, but it has its moments in a so bad it’s funny kind of way.\n\nLady from Chungking (dir. William Nigh, 1942)\n\nKwan Mei (Wong) is the leader of a band of Chinese freedom fighters. Surrounded by the occupying Japanese on all sides, they bide their time in a peasant village. One day, a pair of American pilots are shot down near the village and captured by the Japanese. Seeing potential allies, Kwan Mei plans to rescue them as well as gather information about the plans of the invaders. Learning the Japanese leader General Kaimura (Hans Huber) has a taste for refined women, Kwan Mei poses as an aristocrat sympathetic to the occupiers in order to seduce any big plans out of him. Will she succeed?\n\nDuring World War II, Wong was ardent about supporting the war effort, particularly through sending aid to the Chinese through organizations like United China Relief, participating in USO entertainments, and of course appearing in Allied propaganda. However, these films were for Producers Releasing Corporation, a poverty row studio. This effectively marked the beginning of the end of her movie career. The silver lining is that Wong got to play heroic figures.\n\nWhile it’s no Casablanca, Lady from Chungking is a solid programmer, though nothing especially memorable. The comic relief is unbearably corny, such as when one of the American pilots narrates a baseball game in his sleep, much to Kwan Mei’s confusion. Characters are mostly underdeveloped and the story moves swiftly, which works for the movie’s adventure/thriller elements but less so for the interesting tensions that are left unexplored. General Kamimura is a fervent classist, sneering at the Chinese peasants and only taking an interested in aristocratic women as his bedmates. He loses all interest in Mae Clarke’s Russian opportunist when she reveals she is not a noblewoman in exile, but all but jumps onto Kwan Mei when she passes herself as a Chinese aristocrat. Playing on the general’s fantasies and sense of cultural superiority, Kwan Mei is able to charm information out of him, but this sexual entanglement also puts her at odds with her own people, who begin to wonder if Kwan Mei’s loyalty can be cancelled out by the luxury of being a Japanese officer’s mistress.\n\nNone of this goes anywhere interesting, but at only an hour, the film never overstays its welcome and Wong commands the screen easily. She cuts a noble figure and even gets an inspirational speech at the end. Her character is not a damsel needing to be rescued by the brave Americans, but an active heroine in her own right, as are the other Chinese characters. Plus, it’s always great to see Mae Clarke, another actress who deserved a better career than what she ultimately received.\n\nWhen Were You Born (dir. William McGann, 1938)\n\nAstrology expert Mei Lee Ling (Wong) finds herself flocked to during an ocean liner trip to San Francisco. Passengers react to her character readings and predictions with amazement and skepticism, but no one expects her most sensational prediction to come true: that one of the passengers will be dead within two days. When the very man turns up dead in that time frame, Mei is approached by the police. They suspect her, but instead she offers her aid in sniffing out the real culprit by using her knowledge of astrological signs.\n\nWhen Were You Born was intended to be the start of a mystery film series starring Anna May Wong as a Zodiac expert who solves crimes by analyzing suspects based on their astrological sign. This would not come to be as the film didn’t make much of an impact. As much as I have come to love Wong during this marathon, I can see why the series never panned out, because this movie milks its gimmick dry before the slim runtime even ticks down. Much of the film is just Wong explaining everyone’s Zodiac sign and then telling the cops why this or that person did or didn’t do this or that crime because of that sign. The only things that held my interest was Wong’s lovely wardrobe and poised manner.\n\nI don’t really have too much to say about this film. The camerawork is rote, the characters are one-dimensional, and it doesn’t help that I’m not that fond of mysteries as a genre. However, perusing reviews, I noticed that people who are into astrology tend to think this is a cute trifle, so your mileage will definitely vary.\n\nPiccadilly (dir. E.A. Dupont, 1929)\n\nLondon nightclub owner Valentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) has a bit of a dilemma. His biggest draw is the dance team Mabel and Vic. The problem is that Vic has been harassing Mabel (Gilda Gray) to extend their partnership into the romantic realm, despite her constant rebuffs and entanglement with Wilmot. Called out for his unprofessional conduct, Vic quits before he can be fired. Mabel tries to go solo but Vic was the more popular of the two, meaning Wilmot needs a new act to reel customers back in. Enter Shosho (Wong), a young scullery maid with dreams of dancing. Her eastern-inspired act is a hit, cementing Mabel’s fall from grace. When it looks as though Shosho has a grip on Wilmot’s affections as well, Mabel becomes desperate. However, she finds Shosho is unwilling to give up her hard-earned fame and romance.\n\nModern consensus is that Piccadilly features Anna May Wong’s finest performance. Her final silent film, it is a great showcase for how technically dazzling late-period silents were. Though the top-billed star is Gilda Gray, the film is Wong’s show all the way.\n\nOn paper, the plot of Piccadilly is basic backstage melodrama: an older woman (and by “older,” I mean just past the impossibly ancient age of 25– Gilda Gray was in her late twenties when filming this, though she was made to look a bit older) with a waning showbiz career contends with a hot young thing looking to take her place in the limelight. However, the characters are given more depth than you’d expect and there are no clear-cut heroes or villains. Mabel’s career is threatened by ageist attitudes and the fickle tastes of her public while Shosho is up against rampant racism. Both women are sympathetic, and both are capable of pettiness and cruelty.\n\nShosho’s situation is handled with great delicacy. A less inspired movie would have made her a simple femme fatale, but Piccadilly emphasizes that Shosho is not a cold-hearted villainess but a young woman from a lower class background who craves luxury and excitement. Her introduction is one of the most brilliant quick-sketches of a character I’ve ever seen. Shosho dances slowly and sensually atop a table, mesmerizing her fellow scullery workers. When the camera lingers on her legs, we see her tattered stockings. This shot is not merely erotic, but also a keen insight into how dance is a brief escape from Shosho’s dreary everyday life. For a moment, she can transcend being a dishwasher. When she finally makes it big as a dancer and rapturously reads the positive reviews in the newspaper, Wong makes Shosho’s girlish delight so palpable that it’s impossible not to empathize with her.\n\nOf course, Shosho is not a saint. As evidenced by her interactions with Mabel, she can be catty. She also strings along her boyfriend Jim (King Hou Chang), expecting him to be content with taking a backseat while she pursues a relationship with another man. Though she does seem genuinely fond of him, she certainly takes his loyalty for granted and is not above emasculating him, such as when she demands he model her skimpy dancer’s costume for Wilmont.\n\nShosho’s youthful beauty and appeal to the white British audience’s taste for the “exotic” is able to propel her to fame, but her ethnicity still provides roadblocks. Shosho and Wilmot share a mutual attraction, but dare not make their romance public. The two see a racially mixed couple shamed at a bar, a foretaste of what could happen to them should they take a chance on their relationship. Shosho’s dismayed reaction to the fiasco shows her interest in Wilmont is not merely that of a gold-digger.\n\nOverall, Piccadilly is a fantastic film, almost a proto-noir with its shadowy aesthetic and complicated morality. The ironic ending is particularly a punch to the gut. If you’ve never seen a silent film before or if you’ve only seen silent comedy and want to dip your toes into silent drama, this is a great gateway title. But even more so, it’s a great gateway to Wong’s dramatic skills.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter this marathon, I came away with greater respect for Wong, both as an actress and as a person. Hollywood truly did this woman dirty. She could handle drama and comedy with ease. She had a lovely speaking voice. She had great command of her body and an expressive face. Top all that with her undeniable beauty and it’s a crime she was not offered the same opportunities as white actresses of similar caliber.\n\nOf the five movies I marathoned, my favorite was probably Daughter of Shanghai due to Wong playing a badass who doesn’t have to die tragically and just the overall pulpy vibe of the film. Piccadilly is a close second with its noirish intrigue and complicated characters. Lady from Chungking is pretty good for what it is, while When Were You Born is forgettable and Daughter of the Dragon is a tough sell unless you’re looking for something to give the MST3K treatment.\n\nDespite the limits the film industry imposed upon her, Wong took nothing lying down. I admire her for her steadfastness in fighting for better, less demeaning roles, even if she did not win every battle. She was often the high point of many a film and deserves her rediscovery.\n\nSources:\n\nAnna May Wong: From Laundryman’s Daughter to Hollywood Legend by Graham Russell Gao Hodges\n\nBackwards and in Heels: The past, present, and future of women working in film by Alicia Malone\n\nPiccadilly audio commentary by Farran Smith Nehme\n\nThe older I get, the more I realize much of what I relish in my favorite films are the little moments rather than the grand, showstopping sequences: an inspired bit of business from an actor, an odd prop in the background, a charming special effect, subtly clever writing and editing choices.\n\nJames Whale’s Frankenstein is a film celebrated for its large triumphs, among them Boris Karloff’s beautiful performance as the Monster and Colin Clive’s iconic cry of “It’s alive!”, but here are a few things I admire that I feel are sometimes overlooked in general discussions of the movie.\n\nVan Sloan’s warning and the title sequence\n\nFrankenstein does not open with a typical credits sequence. Instead we get a shot of actor Edward Van Sloan emerging from behind a curtain, a twinkle in his eye as he addresses the audience:\n\n“How do you do? Mr. Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning. We’re about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation: life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to, uh… well, we’ve warned you!”\n\nWhale’s horror films got campier as his career progressed and it’s common for scholars to call the original Frankenstein the least campy of the lot. This is true, but this opening can’t be called anything but pure camp. It’s just so playful and William Castle-ish to me.\n\nI wonder how 1931 audiences responded to this prologue. Did some shudder, already anxious from the ballyhoo used to promote the film? After all, there were nurses in the lobby lest anyone pass out from fright! Or were some in on the joke, grinning and ready to be chilled?\n\nI also really love the film’s title sequence. Most films of this vintage have unfussy, undistinguished opening credits. Not Frankenstein, which blares out a macabre tune and serves up its production credits in front of striking images of glowing eyes and demonic, leering faces. The combination of music and illustrations perfectly encapsulates the spooky story to follow.\n\nThe obvious theatricality of the film\n\nAnyone who’s watched this film on bluray or the big screen is apt to notice the exteriors were shot on a soundstage complete with fabric backdrops. The wrinkles are plain as daylight. Voices echo when characters shout.\n\nLike the Van Sloan prologue, the obvious backdrops and soundstages lend Frankenstein a surreal sense of theatricality. That’s often a dirty word when applied to cinema, but there is a difference between a theatrical film and a stagey one. A stagey film is inert, shot with no imagination, forgetful that cinema has its own rules when it comes to depicting and staging action. A film that consciously embraces theatricality is a different beast. The filmmaker is drawing attention to the artifice, either to make a thematic point or to create an unreal atmosphere. Whale is definitely doing the latter. Whale wanted his film to feel like a fairy tale. Background details both suggest medievalism and modernism. Consider the juxtaposition of electrical apparatuses in crumbling stone watchtowers. Cinematography-wise, no one could call Frankenstein inert either, what with the camera gliding through this film’s gorgeous and extensive interior sets.\n\nBeyond the needs of this particular project, Whale’s films often have a layer of intentional artifice anyway. Think of the little paper doll parade that opens his 1936 adaptation of Show Boat or the prologue with a coy Mary Shelley introducing the further adventures of the Monster in Bride of Frankenstein. The characters in Whale’s universe are larger than life types, brimming with passionate enthusiasm. Realism just won’t do.\n\nMae Clarke as Elizabeth and Frederick Kerr as Baron Frankenstein\n\nEven Frankenstein‘s most fervent admirers tend to turn their noses up at the scenes featuring the story’s “normal” characters. I sympathize with their disdain for Victor, the colorless block of wood played by John Boles who exists solely to ensure Elizabeth won’t be alone after Henry dies– but then the studio changed the ending so Henry lives, so Victor lost even that justification. However, I will defend Mae Clarke and Frederick Kerr.\n\nMae Clarke is one of the pre-code era’s finest stars, an actress who could be both tender and hardboiled onscreen. Mental health difficulties curtailed her career in the mid-1930s and she’s become mostly forgotten over time, save for her appearances in The Public Enemy (where James Cagney shoves grapefruit in her face) and Frankenstein.\n\nElizabeth is an atypical character for Clarke in that she’s more innocent and virginal rather than the “bad girls” or “fallen women” Clarke tended to play. In most 1930s horror, the sweet damsel is the second most boring character, usually after, well, “nice guys” like John Boles as Victor or David Manners as anybody. But there’s something about Elizabeth that appeals to me. Maybe it’s the natural, lowkey way Clarke plays her (as opposed to the grating hysteria of Valerie Hobson, who took over the role in Bride of Frankenstein). She comes off as down-to-earth compared to her more intense fiance and she is the film’s symbol for the simple pleasures of a “normal” life outside of Henry’s ambitions to conquer death.\n\nAlso, she wears my favorite movie wedding dress. I love that cap and that long veil.\n\nFrederick Kerr plays Henry’s father, the baron. And I know this all goes down to personal taste, but I think the comic relief he provides is hilarious. To put it plainly, the baron is an a-hole. He openly smack talks underlings when they’re in the room with him and never bothers to put on a pleasant manner when he doesn’t feel like it. His crabby, cantankerous conventionality are the dark side of “normal” life. You can see why Henry is so distant from the guy (“My father never believes in anybody.”).\n\nPut together, Elizabeth and the baron are representatives of conventional society. Elizabeth represents warmth and domesticity, a life far less dangerous and lonely than Henry’s existence in his secret lab. The baron represents the narrow-minded banality that can come with such a life, making him the polar opposite of his son’s fervent romanticism.\n\nThe entrance of the Monster\n\nThe image of the Monster’s twitching hand is technically our proper introduction to him as a living being. However, I ADORE the way the Monster’s iconic visage is first revealed to the audience because of the way Whale builds suspense through sound design and editing.\n\nHenry and Waldman are having a tense chat before the Monster makes his entrance. We hear the Monster before we see him and the impression is one of dread: lumbering, heavy footfalls echo in the corridor beyond, suggesting brute force. The door seems to open on its own as the Monster backs into the room before he turns around. A great, ashen face fills the frame, a pair of dead eyes glowering at the audience from the screen.\n\nNow, to an audience in 1931, totally unaware of the Monster’s sympathetic qualities, this moment must have been tense. Ads for the film proclaimed, “The Monster is loose!” Karloff’s gaunt visage must have seemed ghastly in ways audiences raised on gorier horror fare cannot image. Just six years before, Lon Chaney’s Phantom was sending audiences into hysterics. I can easily imagine such chills rippling through Frankenstein‘s original audience at the mere sound of the Monster approaching. And then consider the dread they must have felt at the sight of the Monster, especially when Whale cuts closer and closer to the Monster’s face.\n\nI once listened to a fan commentary for Frankenstein that criticized this editing choice. “So awkward! So early talkie!” But I don’t see it that way at all. The progressive close-up is aggressive in its refusal to let the audience look away. The underlying rationale behind it is that for all Waldman’s moralistic balking, for all Henry’s regrets, there is no putting the lid back on this Pandora’s Box. Henry must either remain loyal to his creation as a father figure or abandon him. Success is not guaranteed with the former, but tragedy is inevitable with the latter. For a few moments, Henry seems a patient and willing teacher despite the Monster’s childlike simplicity.\n\nAnd then Fritz enters the room…\n\n—\n\nI could go on forever about this movie. It was a key part of my early cinephilia and it remains a movie I rewatch at least once a year. Let these four observations suffice for now.\n\nThis post is part of the 100 Years of Disney Blogathon at the Silver Scenes Blog.\n\nThe Silly Symphonies were born from the excitement of the early sound period. Unlike many in the film industry, Walt Disney did not suffer microphone dread. He was enthused about the new technologies and it would not be an exaggeration to say the talkies gave the Disney Studio a much needed shot-in-the-arm after the drama of losing Oswald the Lucky Rabbit . Steamboat Willie was not the first “talkie” cartoon by a mile, but it smoked its contemporaries. Just compare the stilted My Old Kentucky Home from 1926– the actual first sound cartoon– with the superior synchronization and energy of the 1928 Disney effort.\n\nA discussion between Disney and his first music director Carl W. Stalling about whether the animation or the music should be created first during a cartoon project prompted the creation of the Silly Symphonies. Before working for Disney, Stalling was an organist for the Isis Theatre in Kansas City. Stalling knew how to combine pre-existing music with his own improvisations, a talent which impressed Disney when the two first met in the early 1920s. Stalling suggested the idea for a musical novelty series in which he would provide a score cribbed from classical music, popular songs, and Stallings’ improv, and the animators would sync the images to the music. The first of these cartoons was The Skeleton Dance, released in 1929 to great enthusiasm, marking the start of an astonishing decade-long run for the Silly Symphonies.\n\nThe major gimmick of the early Symphonies is synchronization of sound and image. It’s easy to poke fun at this period of the series, when the plots seem to be little more than smiling flowers/animals/dwarfs/inanimate objects dancing in a line. In our modern cinematic landscape, it’s easy to forget that sound was once a novelty and often enough to delight an audience for its own sake. But as with all novelties, this one died off and so the Silly Symphonies had to justify themselves by continuing to push the boundaries of animation with experiments in color, character design, special effects, and even narrative development. They are the stepping stones from which the likes of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Fantasia would emerge as masterpieces of world cinema, but they remain enjoyable in their own right and so I present to you my top ten favorite shorts from the series.\n\nNote: I’ve tried my best to find uploaded versions of the shorts below, but they are not always available.\n\n10: Springtime\n\nSpringtime is typical of the earliest Silly Symphonies: a bunch of identical characters do eccentric line dances amidst cartoony sight gags. It has some truly bizarre laughs in there, like when a group of stone-faced baby birds slap their behinds in time to the music. It’s also lowkey horrifying. For all the smiles and dancing, the everyday violence of the natural world is frankly depicted in the ways the animals all casually eat each other.\n\nSpringtime was my first ever exposure to the Silly Symphonies, not because I watched it directly, but because excerpts were featured in One Hundred and One Dalmatians! I remember loving the sound effects.\n\n9: The Ugly Duckling (1939)\n\nDisney made two versions of The Ugly Duckling in this series. The first was a black-and-white effort from 1931 and the second was a color version from 1939. The latter is closer to the original fairy tale and it also happens to be the swan song of the Silly Symphony series (pun absolutely intended). Not gonna lie: this short makes me cry every time I watch it. It gets to the heart of what it’s like to be a misfit.\n\n8: Babes in the Woods\n\nDisney had always rummaged through fairy tales for inspiration. The studio’s first cartoon was a 1923 short based on Red Riding Hood. According to film historians Russell Merritt and JB Kaufman, Babes in the Woods was the first time Disney adapted a fairy tale in earnest. The story is more or less “Hansel and Gretel,” only with more dwarfs and less cannibalism. While the peril in Springtime is mostly played for comedy, that’s not the case in Babes. The witch isn’t trying to eat the kids like in the original tale, but her plan to transform them into rats and spiders isn’t that great a fate either, and the ick factor is played up via the creepy interiors of the witch’s cottage and the tortured reactions of her former victims.\n\nThis cartoon is a direct ancestor of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in many ways. The serious attempt to create a Germanic fairy tale atmosphere is plain, and the dwarfs’ ride to the rescue has echoes in the 1937 feature. There’s also a moment where the two children, lost in the woods, encounter frightening imagery in the trees there, not unlike the nightmarish flight scene in Snow White that had 1930s theater owners reupholstering their seats after children soiled them in terror.\n\n7: The Three Little Pigs\n\nArguably the most popular Silly Symphony, The Three Little Pigs was a Depression era sensation with its likable characters and catchy music. Plenty has been said about this iconic short, but what I like most about it beyond the music are some of the background gags, like the framed photos of the pigs’ parents. The image of their dad is pretty hilarious and screwed up.\n\n6: The Cookie Carnival\n\nThis cartoon played on TV all the time when I was a kid, so it’s probably the Silly Symphony I’ve seen the most. The plot is simple: a cookie lady is sad she’s too plain to compete for queen of the Cookie Carnival, a cookie guy dresses her up in icing and other goodies, she wins the crown, and then a bunch of other dessert guys try to compete to be her king. It’s a low-stakes story, but it’s good-natured and filled to the brim with sweet related puns that’ll make any appreciator of dad jokes jubilant. The phrase “wholesome entertainment” usually makes some cringe, but this is a cartoon that fits that bill without being cloying.\n\n5: Hell’s Bells\n\nA perfect cartoon for the Halloween season, Hell’s Bells is a delightfully weird precode cartoon. Devils party it up in hell, which is apparently populated by demon cows with udders that spout flames rather than milk. The king demon tries bullying the others, but gets his comeuppance. To be honest, I cannot see Disney making a cartoon like this today. They’d get a hell of a lot of flack… pun also absolutely intended.\n\n4: The Old Mill\n\nThe Old Mill is the favorite Disney cartoon of animation legend Hayao Miyazaki and it’s not hard to see why. Among the most atmospheric of the Silly Symphonies, its use of the multi-plane camera is nothing less than Disney showing off what technically accomplished animation looked like circa 1937. The world of the short is compelling: the mill seems to have been long abandoned by human beings, but a series of animals have made the rundown structure their home. A storm imperils the small community before calm is restored. While the short was released the same year as Snow White, you can detect a lot of the DNA for Bambi in there, largely in its depiction of a more or less realistic natural world and its final message of life going on despite the slings and arrows of existence.\n\n3: The Goddess of Spring\n\nWithin official Disney history, The Goddess of Spring is usually written off as a failure. An experiment in realistically proportioned characters and more dramatic storytelling, the awkward gait and noodle arms of the titular goddess are often mocked. I mean, yeah, she looks like she’s thrown back a few beers during her first little skip through the fields, but the rest of this short is quite lovely, with a lively operetta style and a fiendishly likable Pluto (the god of the underworld, not Mickey’s dog) who looks more like Mephistopheles than a Greek deity for some reason. I dare you to listen to “Hi-Dee Hades” without having it stuck in your head all day long!\n\n2: Music Land\n\nAnother Silly Symphony I remember seeing often as a kid. In a world populated by sentient musical instruments, the Isle of Jazz and Land of Symphony are perpetually at odds. Despite this, the jazz prince and symphonic princess (an anthropomorphic saxophone and violin, respectively) fight to be together. However, the enmity between their kingdoms comes with the threat of war.\n\nWhat impresses me most about Music Land is its sheer creativity. The characters “speak” through notes played on the instrument in question and yet the “dialogue” is perfectly understandable. There are plenty of subtle gags that reward those familiar with the pop culture of the period. When imprisoned in the Land of Symphony, the saxophone prince sends his father a letter informing him of his whereabouts– the letter is literally the sheet music for “The Prisoner’s Song.” The king of the Isle of Jazz also happens to be a caricature of Paul Whiteland, a popular bandleader.\n\n1: The Skeleton Dance\n\nThe first of the Silly Symphonies is easily my favorite of the entire series. Not a single Halloween season passes without me watching it– usually more than once! The music is ear wormy to the extreme and the skeletons make life after death seem like a rollicking good time. At least until the sun comes up.\n\nWhile the original 1929 audience would have been floored by the synchronization of sound and image, The Skeleton Dance‘s charms go beyond mere technological gimmick. It’s a macabre treat, mixing horror and humor throughout its five minute runtime. Time hasn’t been able to diminish its impact in that regard either. My sister shows this cartoon to her first grade classes and they tend to have some genuine chills during the early moments, like when the first skeleton lunges at the camera in a jarring close-up or one of the last gags, where the skeletons run into each other and then their bones recombine into a four-headed monstrosity even Cthulu might fear. However, the high spirits of the short always come through and the kids tend to be delighted.\n\nThe Skeleton Dance encapsulates what I love best about classic Disney. The accomplished animation. The wonderful music. The creative gags. The strong atmosphere. The ability to make an audience both delight in and shudder at the material.\n\nSources:\n\nWalt Disney’s Silly Symphonies: A companion to the classic cartoon series by Russell Merritt and JB Kaufman"
