The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\n- Directors: Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Mervyn LeRoy, Norman Taurog, Richard Thorpe, King Vidor\n\n- Stacker score: 98\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8\n\n- Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nFew fantasy films have stayed the course like \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which continues to draw in new audiences after eight decades. Upon waking up in a magical land, young Dorothy, played by Judy Garland, sets out to find her way home. It won two Academy Awards for the music, but lost best picture to a little movie called \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\n#2. Spirited Away (2001)\n\n- Director: Hayao Miyazaki\n\n- Stacker score: 99\n\n- Metascore: 96\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Runtime: 125 minutes\n\nHayao Miyazaki's most quintessential effort remains the highest-grossing movie in Japan to this day. A truly singular vision, it follows a young girl into a dangerous parallel world. Part of the film's magic is its ability to pour out of the screen, infusing the viewer's reality with a renewed sense of enchantment.\n\n#1.

If nearly three-and-a-half hours of adventure doesn't suffice, there's an extended version with more than 50 minutes of additional footage.\n\nYou may also like: Movies and TV shows casting across the US\n\nRead First\n\nStacker believes in making the world’s data more accessible through storytelling.
