        "text": "Most Badass Female Characters in Film\n\nWomen’s History Month is a great time to check out some of the most badass women in the history of movies — but face it, there’s never a bad time to settle in for some action and revenge with the likes of Lara Croft, Princess Leia, Domino and more.\n\nWhether you prefer your strong women in animated form like Merida from “Brave,” straight out of the pages of a comicbook like the Black Widow or Carol Danvers in “Captain Marvel,” or wielding a sword like Michelle Yeoh and Uma Thurman, there’s a formidable female movie hero for every taste on this list.\n\nImperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron)\n\nFilm: “Mad Max: Fury Road”\n\nAlthough the film shares a name with Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky, “Mad Max: Fury Road” is really Imperator Furiosa’s story. Throughout her journey to free five wives of Immortan Joe, she proves she has no equal when it comes to driving or shooting — two excellent qualities in their apocalyptic world.\n\nLeia Organa (Carrie Fisher)\n\nFilm: “Star Wars” franchise\n\nCarrie Fisher’s Leia Organa exemplifies moxy, and from the second she’s broken out of her prison aboard the Death Star she’s calling the shots. She eventually goes on to lead the Rebellion against the Empire and later becomes a General in the Resistance against the First Order.\n\nHarley Quinn (on-screen portrayals by Margot Robbie and VO by Kaley Cuoco, Tara Strong and Arleen Sorkin)\n\nMargot Robbie’s portrayal of Harley Quinn (“The Suicide Squad,” “Birds of Prey” and 2016’s “Suicide Squad”) is the perfect cocktail of chaos, charisma and kick-assery. With her signature baseball bat in hand and a devil-may-care attitude, she flips the script on what it means to be a badass female character. From her colorful wardrobe to her unpredictable antics, Harley dances to the beat of her own (often maniacal) drum. But Robbie’s Harley Quinn isn’t the only one who’s a certified badass; voice actors like Tara Strong, Arleen Sorkin and Kaley Cuoco bring their own brand of mischief to the character. From Tara Strong’s iconic rendition in the video game “Batman: Arkham City” to Arleen Sorkin’s classic portrayal in “Batman: The Animated Series” and Kaley Cuoco’s fresh take in Max’s raunchy, animated series “Harley Quinn,” each actor infuses Harley with sass, spirit and a whole lot of spunk, proving that whether it’s in animation or live-action, Harley’s voice is always loud and proud.\n\nEowyn (Miranda Otto)\n\nFilm: “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King”\n\nEowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan with dreams of being a warrior, gets her wish in the final “Lord of the Rings” film when she participates in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. More than fight, Eowyn slays the Witch-king — who no living man can kill — uttering the famous line “I am no man.”\n\nJobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu)\n\nFilm: “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nWeaponizing a vortex-like everything bagel that threatens the entire universe, Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) is the most powerful character in the 2023 best picture winner, which spans multiple dimensions. While initially depicted as a wrathful villain out to get Michelle Yeoh’s Evelyn and the entire human race, Jobu is really an incarnation of Evelyn’s daughter Joy, who is reconciling her complex relationship with her mother.\n\nCassie Thomas (Carey Mulligan)\n\nFilm: “Promising Young Woman”\n\nCassie Thomas frequents nightclubs and bars pretending to be too drunk to function and waiting to see if men will take advantage of her — only to drop the fake drunk act and confront them for their predatory actions. Cassie embarked on this revenge mission against such men following the assault of her friend Nina. Talk about a best friend.\n\nBlack Widow (Scarlett Johansson)\n\nFilm: Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nBlack Widow has appeared in many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films through the years, beginning with “Iron Man 2” and most recently in “Captain America: Civil War” — and it takes a certain kind of bada** to stand against gods and monsters with nothing but guns and gadgets.\n\nLetty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)\n\nFilm: “Fast and Furious” franchise\n\nIn the testosteron-fueled world of the “Fast and Furious,” Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty Ortiz stands at the top of the franchise’s most bada** characters. Since the beginning of the series — as a mechanic and thief on Dom’s squad — she has battled everything from international criminals to dibilitating amnesia to prove she’s one of the squad’s best.\n\nCoffy (Pam Grier)\n\nWith a weapon tucked away in her afro, the iconic Coffy is known as a take-no-prisoners female vigilante. Pam Grier played similar characters in 1970s Blaxploitation movies, including “Foxy Brown.” These movies later inspired Quentin Tarantino’s 1997 film “Jackie Brown,” in which Grier also starred. While the Blaxploitation genre is controversial for its portrayal of crime and violence in the African American community, it is also praised for featuring powerful Black characters with agency who fight against injustice. Coffy and Grier’s other characters will undoubtedly be remembered as mold-breaking roles.\n\nThe Women of “The Woman King”\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood’s “The Woman King” has no shortage of badass women. Based on the group of West African female warriors known as the Agojie, who defended the kingdom of Dahomey during the 17th-19th centuries, Viola Davis leads a group of fearless and bold fighters. When European slave traders arrive and fellow Africans are complicit in the trade, it is up to the Agojie and the young warrior Nawi (Thusu Mbedu) to defend their right to freedom and self-determination.\n\nIlsa Faust Rebecca Ferguson)\n\nFilms: “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”\n\nRebecca Ferguson’s character in “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” and “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” Ilsa Faust, is the epitome of a badass femme fatale. From her awesome motorcycle chases through the winding streets of Morocco to her electrifying skills in hand-to-hand combat, Ferguson commands the screen with a magnetic presence. As a double agent with her own agenda, Ilsa navigates a dangerous world of espionage with skill and cunning — able to outmaneuver even Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt.\n\nGrace (Samara Weaving)\n\nFilm: “Ready or Not”\n\nGrace takes the phrase “in sickness and in health” to a whole new level. From the moment she realizes she’s married into a deadly game of hide-and-seek with her eccentric and murderous in-laws, Grace doesn’t hesitate to fight for her life. Weaving portrays Grace with a perfect blend of vulnerability and determination as she navigates the twisted game night from hell. From wielding makeshift weapons in her wedding dress to outsmarting her wealthy and deranged relatives at every turn, Grace proves that she’s not your average damsel in distress but rather the ultimate badass bridezilla.\n\nRita Vrataski (Emily Blunt)\n\nFilm: “Edge of Tomorrow”\n\nFrom her first introduction, where she effortlessly dispatches alien invaders with precision and grace, to her intense combat training sessions that leave Tom Cruise’s Cage reeling, Blunt’s portrayal shows us why her character is known as the “Full Metal Bitch.” Rita fearlessly leads humanity’s fight against the alien threat, showcasing her remarkable skills in every action-packed sequence: she’s not just a soldier – she’s a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRamona (Jennifer Lopez)\n\nFilm: “Hustlers”\n\n“Start ’em off with a single, then a double, then a triple, then back to a double and back to a single. You want ’em drunk enough to get their credit card then sober enough to sign the check.” This iconic line shows nobody does it better than Jennifer Lopez’s Ramona from “Hustlers” — from her mesmerizing pole dancing routines that defy gravity to her fearless confidence as she orchestrates the ultimate hustle, Lopez commands every scene she’s in. Whether she’s teaching Constance Wu’s character the ropes in a steamy strip club sequence or leading her crew of cunning con artists in a daring scheme to fleece Wall Street wolves, Lopez exudes power, poise and undeniable charisma."
