Well, strap in, kids, because we’re about to kick that era of Disney history into high gear. The Shaggy Dog was technically the beginning of this, but now we’re really in the thick of The Rise of Fred MacMurray!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are capped from my copy of the movie with InstantShot! unless otherwise specified.\n\nIt’s not often that a movie has two pieces of source material, but here we are. I couldn’t find the short story it took inspiration from, A Situation of Gravity by Samuel W. Taylor, which was disappointing. The other thing was a real person by the name of Hubert Alyea, a chemistry teacher who earned the nickname Dr. Boom for his penchant for blowing things up. This is my kind of dude. Apparently, he was Walt’s kind of dude, too, because he watched one of his demonstrations and approached him to tell him the explosions gave him an idea for a movie. Alyea was thrilled and agreed immediately, and Fred Macmurray incorporated several of his mannerisms into his performance.\n\nThe Absent Minded Professor was an immediate success, which might actually be the first time we have two major successes in a row! Yay! Audiences and critics thought it was one of the funniest comedies they’d ever seen and found the special effects impressive. People all over wanted to know how to create their own Flubber, so Time Magazine published the following recipe: “To one pound of salt water taffy add one heaping tablespoon polyurethane foam, one can crumbled yeast. Mix till smooth, allow to rise. Then pour into saucepan over one cup cracked rice mixed with one cup water. Add topping of molasses. Boil till it lifts lid and says ‘Qurlp.” It was even nominated for no less than three Academy Awards for Best Special Effects, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography. It still has an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for AFI’s list of 100 Funniest Movies. All that’s a pretty good sign, so let’s see if it put a little bounce in my step!\n\nSTORY\n\nThe film opens with our title character, Ned Brainard, giving a lecture on acoustical energy. To prove that sound can shatter glass, he tries to break a wine glass with high notes on a trumpet. The wine glass stays put but he does manage to break a kid’s glasses and one of his own beakers. So I guess that’s a success? Unusually for a Disney film, the credits come after this cold open. As the names role past, we get our first glimpse the campus of Medfield College of Technology. We’ll be spending a lot of time here soon. Brainard finishes his class by giving his students their homework. As he flips through his record book, he finds a reminder that he’s getting married that evening. Who needs a reminder of their own wedding? Well, this guy, apparently.\n\nThe bride certainly hasn’t forgotten. Betsy Carlisle gets a lift to the venue from an old friend named Shelby Ashton. Despite her repeated refusals and the fact that she is literally about to marry another man, he decides now is the time to remind her he’s in love with her. Creep. The Reverend comes out and mistakes Shelby for the groom, and he’s very disappointed to find out he’s not. Shelby continues to play the Nice Guy and the Good Friend, warning Betsy that the guy she’s chosen to marry isn’t good for her so she should just marry him instead. Oh, and Betsy’s boss, President Dagget, is “tired of having a spinster for a secretary”. Excuse me?! We’re five minutes in and I’m already steaming. This is a great sign. Can’t wait for an hour and a half of men treating this girl like a piece of meat. Anyway, no one believes Brainard’s actually going to show up because this is the third time Betsy has tried to marry him.\n\nThis time, she has a safeguard in place: she told his housekeeper. Elderly Mrs. Chatsworth has his suit all tidy and pressed with a note to remind Professor “Oh Look a Squirrel” where she put the ring. She’s got this on lock. All that’s missing is Brainard himself, who’s holed up in his lab, completely absorbed in an experiment along with his absolutely precious little doggie Charlie. Mrs. Chatsworth comes down to drag him away from his sciencing, strongly hinting that he’s not good enough for Betsy. He comes very, very close to going to get dressed… and then has a scientific breakthrough. He knows just why his experiment failed! He has to drop everything to try again! Even the dog is done with this nonsense. Brainard flips the switch on the experiment just one more time… and everything explodes. A lot.\n\nIt becomes abundantly clear that Brainard isn’t going to make the wedding. Poor Betsy tries to call his house, but gets no answer. Fed up, she throws her bouquet into the trash and declares that she’s finished with Ned Brainard. Professor Daggert offers to give her some time off, but she just wants to act like none of this ever happened. She asks Shelby to escort her home and it’s worded like she can’t leave the building without an escort because she’s female. I don’t want to scream about gender stuff in this review, guys, but it’s so bad.\n\nThis time Brainard has a good reason not to show up. The massive explosion that we just saw take out most of his garage knocked him unconscious, but he’s otherwise unharmed. The room’s in tact, too, even if his experiment is a shambles. Charlie wakes him up with puppy kisses because apparently dogs can cure massive head injuries. Brainard gets to his feet and surveys what’s left of his work. Frustrated at the loss of all that research, he kicks a canister… and it rises into the air! Astonished, Brainard slowly, carefully opens it to find a mass of gooey stuff congealed within. Kind of like cleaning out my refrigerator. That was a joke, guys, I swear.\n\nFascinated, Brainard balls up a handful of the goo and tosses it on the ground. Normally, a bouncing ball will gradually bounce lower, but this ball just keeps bouncing higher! It’s a new miracle energy source that will never run out! He keeps tossing more and more goo balls around until his whole lab is full of bouncing blobs. Amidst the wacky bouncing balls, Brainard races for a notebook to record his observations with a rapid mouthful of science jargon. And in that journal, he gives his miracle substance a name: Flubber.\n\nThe next experiment is an effort to control it using radioactive material like everybody’s got lying around their garage. Casual. Exposing the Flubber canister to more or less radiation raises or lowers the level at which it flies, which is totally how radiation works. Totally. Mrs. Chatsworth hears the Flubber going qurlp and goes to investigate. She walks in on Brainard discovering that his Flubber can lift a limitless amount of weight, but she’s not interested in that. He gets an earful for missing his wedding again, which confuses him. He thinks it’s almost eight at night, meaning he still has time, but it’s really eight in the morning! Finally, Brainard springs into gear and races off to apologize to Betsy.\n\nThe next day, Betsy’s working as usual despite Dagget’s concerns that she really should take some time off after being left at the altar again. She’s determined, so he carries on. He’s got a letter to dictate to her, asking a loan shark called Alonzo Hawk of the Auld Lang Syne loan company not to foreclose on their college. Brainard pops up outside the door with a big bouquet for her, trying to mouth apologies even though she repeatedly tells him to leave. Dagget spots his pathetic refusal to leave her alone, which he just takes as an opportunity to show them his Flubber. Neither wants to listen to him, but it seems they have bigger problems. Alonzo Hawk is here! But he’s not here about the loan. Oh, no. He’s in a full on Karen rage because Brainard failed his precious special angel son Biff and now he can’t play in the basketball game later. For his part, Biff is mortified at his father’s behavior and Brainard is totally justified in failing a student who can’t even spell the name of the school. Dagget pipes up in an effort to run his own school but Hawk storms out. And now Hawk’s angry and even less likely to extend the loan.\n\nBetsy and Dagget watch him leave in horror. The college president urges Betsy to write letters to whatever donors they can find, pleading for the money to save the school. And what does Brainard do? He continues to beg Betsy to take him back! It’s like he has no inkling whatsoever of what kind of trouble he’s caused! It’s all about the relationship he screwed up! And he’s not even apologizing, he’s just babbling on and on about his discovery and what a breakthrough he made. To her credit, Betsy realizes that this is not an apology and slams the door in his face. She and Dagget have a real solution to find, no matter how much he insists Flubber can bring in all the money they need.\n\nNow it’s time for some evil gloating. Hawk does just that in the back of his chauffeured car while Biff continues to look like he’d rather be anywhere else. He really is planning on bulldozing his own alma mater so he can build profitable housing, which Biff has some misgivings about. So, like any evil businessman worth his salt, Hawk starts monologuing. Profit means crushing the little guy to build bigger and bigger and make more and more money. Wow, guys, this was made in 1961 and it’s presenting late stage capitalism as villainous! How very progressive. Now if only we could do something about the way everyone treats Betsy. Anyway, Hawk thinks he’s just putting a languishing school out of his misery and the money just so happens to come with it. Biff doesn’t buy this either. So Hawk makes a bet with his driver: $10,000 if Medfield loses the big basketball game without star player Biff.\n\nBack at his miraculously renovated lab, Brainard has a new experiment underway. Combining radiation with Flubber in a car engine will make the car fly! And that will surely impress Betsy! Because that’s what all this is about. Not about the scientific achievement. Not because flying cars are cool. It’s all about crawling back to his ex. Dude. The lady said no. Either way, Brainard and Charlie pile into the back of an old Model T and up they go, around the church spire in a scene that totally got ripped off in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Whimsy abounds as they fly through the night sky, and it would be delightful if he wasn’t still absolutely convinced that Betsy is going to fall all over herself to get with him when she sees what he can do.\n\nThe flying car lands smoothly on Betsy’s lawn, and Brainard saunters up to her front door like owns the place. To his surprise, Shelby opens the door! He’s Betsy’s date to the big game, replacing Brainard. Wow, she rebounded fast. Brainard blows past him to get to her and ask her to come with him for a few minutes “if she doesn’t mind”. Clearly, she does mind, or you wouldn’t have to ask. This woman need to file a restraining order like yesterday, especially he physically drags her off of her new boyfriend to haul her towards his car! Not a cool move, dude. He presents the Model T as a “wedding present” for the wedding that she called off. Even worse for him, he won’t show anything with Shelby present so he looks even more insane. Shelby ushers Betsy into his own vehicle and away from her psychotic ex, which… yeah. Yeah.\n\nThe big game arrives! Medfield’s basketball team has to face down the Rutland team, all of whom are a solid foot taller than them. Obviously, they’re at quite a disadvantage. By the way, those 60’s basketball shorts are something else. Hawk gloats about all the money he’s going to get from betting on Rutland while Biff cringes to watch his friends get crushed. Betsy, too, struggles to watch the carnage, not helped by Shelby reciting poetry (he works at Rutland). Late as usual, Brainard squeezes in behind his poor, long-suffering ex.\n\nThe two exchange barbs, like Shelby acting like Brainard is unreasonable for putting students’ grades above sports. And oof, as someone from a big college basketball area, that is too real. I remember a story where one of the players for one of the big schools was functionally illiterate and had never passed a class, but the school kept him around because his basketball games made them tons of money. In return, Brainard snarks that the basketball players at Rutland make more than the professors, prompting Shelby to inadvertently splutter that yes, they do pay their college basketball platers. A lot.\n\nMedfield’s team continues to get demolished, and I’m not entirely sure having Biff around would help them any. It’s so bad that Rutland’s players start openly mocking Medfield’s, no longer taking the game seriously. Why should they, when they can just throw the ball right over the shorter players’ heads? Shelby, representing his school, snarks that the tiny Medfield players need a “lift”. That gives Brainard an idea! So he sneaks into the locker room during half time to iron Flubber onto the heels of all their… back up shoes? I don’t know. That’s a thing they have. And ironing shoes doesn’t cause them to melt. Whatever. This would be a great idea (though still cheating) if it were about helping his students, but no! It’s still about his desperate pleas for Betsy’s attention, and that makes it pathetic. Charlie playing with the bouncing shoes is super cute, though.\n\nThe coach leads the players in for a little half-time pep talk, so Brainard hides behind the lockers. It’s actually a sweet pep talk, too, all about how proud he is of how hard they’re trying. They’re not entirely convinced and I really can’t blame them for just wanting this massacre of a game to be over, but it’s nice that the coach isn’t yelling at them or whatever. He spots Brainard hiding and, without missing a beat, blames Brainard for their loss because he failed Biff. Aaand there goes all my respect for the coach. Dude. You are a school. Your entire purpose is education. If a student neglects their education, they should be punished. I can’t believe this issue dates back to the 60s.\n\nAnyway, Brainard immediately starts babbling until suddenly he’s in the middle of a huge motivational speech that uses synonyms of “hop” and “bounce” a lot. Just in case you couldn’t tell what’s about to happen. Halftime ends and the players make their way back onto the court. Only now something amazing happens. The players can jump super crazy high! Everyone is astounded and thrilled by the miraculous comeback, except Shelby whose school is now losing, Hawk who’s losing his bet, and me because this scene never ends. It’s like five minutes of basketball players bouncing around. There’s one fun gag where one of the players follows the ball through the net (which apparently that actor begged to do) but other than that it’s the same thing over and over and over again.\n\nAt the last possible second, Medfield ekes out a victory, 47-46! Betsy goes wild with the rest of the crowd, and Brainard chooses that moment to tell her he’s the real hero. She and Shelby don’t believe a word of it, thinking he’s just being super egotistical which honestly is not that farfetch’d. Disgusted, the two of them leave. There’s a decidedly awkward cut here that leaves us at Betsy’s door mid-conversation. It seems Shelby’s begging Betsy to let him be her boyfriend literally a day after she got left at the altar, because Brainard isn’t the only one with terrible timing. He finally agrees to give her time to think, but he’ll get a positive answer tomorrow, he just knows it. Why are all the men in this movie just the worst? He leans in for a forcible kiss, but she turns her head turns it into a peck on the cheek. Good.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, Brainard’s Model T is right behind him because the men in this movie are just competing to see who can be more disgusting. I mean, not to suggest that sitting outside your ex-girlfriend’s house to spy on the new man in her life is not a totally normal thing to do or anything. Brainard rambles about how pathetic and desperate he as and how Betsy totally drove him to this and… no. Just no. He catches up to Shelby’s car and rises into the air to prove once and for all what a trash human he is. He actually bounces on top of the poor guy’s roof to scare him! And he keeps doing it, until Shelby’s stuck swerving through town in an effort to escape the unseen thing on his roof! And this is supposed to be the comedic centerpiece of the movie! What?!\n\nShelby’s panic results in a head-on collision with a police car. And this police car just happens to contain the very same Officers Hanson and Kelly that we saw in The Shaggy Dog! Hanson is not happy about spilling boiling coffee all over himself even though that’s probably the best case scenario for a head on collision with a reckless driver. Shelby begs the officers for help from the flying thing that’s been stalking him. The poor guy is clearly scared out of his mind but all Hanson sees is his erratic babbling and decides he must be drunk. It doesn’t help that Shelby refuses to take a breathalyzer test. The screaming protests aren’t helping you, man. Brainard rolls up to innocently ask his good buddy Officer Hanson what’s going on, and he says it’s nothing, just a guy who drank too much at the basketball game. Sports culture. After the officer compliments the restoration job on his Model T, Brainard drives off laughing.\n\nWell, we’ve spent some time with our bad guys, so let’s check in on our villains. Hawk rants and raves in his fury over losing $15,000 betting on the basketball game. His staff slash evil henchmen know nothing, which doesn’t help his mood any. Hope arrives in the form of Biff, who saw “Neddie the Nut” in the locker room during half time. This doesn’t turn out to be super helpful because, as far as Biff can tell all he did was talk to them. Groaning, Hawk turns to the window and spots Brainard’s Model T soaring through the sky! Biff rushes over to confirm that his father isn’t seeing things, and as it happens, Brainard has talked a whole lot about a new energy source in class. Hawk immediately recognizes what a big deal this is, but all he can see is dollar signs.\n\nWithout waiting for Mrs. Chatsworth to announce him, Hawk and Biff burst in on Brainard while he’s fixing up the Model T. He immediately starts prattling on about revitalizing Medfield College, which puts Brainard on his guard. Where, exactly, is the money for a renovation like that going to come from? Why, Hawk is happy to provide it for a very small price: credit for the biggest discovery their university has ever made. Brainard plays dumb, like there’s nothing remarkable at all about the car. Hawk drops the bomb that he saw it fly. And now we’re in trouble. He’s got a plan to sell Flubber to the government for an exorbitant amount of money, but Brainard isn’t just about to use his discovery to commit extortion. He decides to talk to the President himself because that’s a thing anybody can do. With this in mind, he hauls Hawk out of his lab despite Hawk vowing that he’s making a mistake and he’ll regret it.\n\nSo that evil plan was a bust. Hawk grumbles about it on the way home, but Biff has a plan to keep his school from closing while pleasing his father. At first, Hawk orders him to shut up for about the fiftieth time this movie, but for once, Biff doesn’t. He plows ahead with his evil plan: to switch the flying car with an ordinary Model T. That way, the government never sees what it can do and the Flubber will be in their hands, allowing them to take the credit and the money! Hawk is stunned at this moment of genius from his dim-witted son who can’t even spell Medfield, and talks for like five minutes about how proud he is.\n\nOver at a stock photo of the White House, the president’s assistant converses casually with Brainard about his amazing discovery. Because again, you can just ring up the president’s assistant. Brainard is still terrible at carrying on a conversation like a normal person, so the assistant hangs up on his prattling. He tries again with reps from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense, but no dice… or so he thinks. The phone call interrupted a meeting with leaders from the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and all three are rather interested in this amazing new discovery. So they head to Medfield.\n\nAll Brainard knows, though, is that everyone hung up on him, so he thinks he’s out of luck. Mrs. Chatsworth comes in with the suit he’s supposed to wear to the homecoming dance, but he’s already decided he’s going to skip the dance and chat up the government some more. Her main concern is that he’s letting Betsy slip through his fingers, which… hello? She. Said. No. But she gives him a rousing speech about making Shelby jealous and chimpanzees and man I don’t even know, I was too busy bashing my face into the wall at everyone treating Betsy like a prize to be won.\n\nSo Brainard arrives at the dance and walks right past Hawk and Biff, who are hidden behind a wall. To help with his inability to dance, he’s Flubberized his shoes. It doesn’t seem to work terribly well, seeing as he’s struggling to even walk without bouncing, but he gets close enough to see Shelby and Betsy dancing. Perfectly. Happy. That’s all the reason he needs to lunge in there and ruin it, because in case we haven’t firmly established it this guy is a creep. And also there’s some slapstick with the shoes making him fall over stuff. Some stock footage of a plane landing signals the military representatives’ arrival in Medfield. There’s only one taxi leaving the airport, so all three of them pile in. By pure coincidence they all happen to be going to the same place, and by pure coincidence the driver knows just where it is without the address!\n\nBack at the dance, Betsy and Shelby spot Brainard. It’d be hard for them not to, as he’s bouncing all over the ceiling above their heads. Did I say he was a creepy stalker before? Well, now he seizes her and pulls her away from her boyfriend to force her to dance with him. He violently whips her around while she screams and struggles away from his vice-like embrace, and guys this is not a romantic dance this is assault and I am extremely uncomfortable even reviewing this movie. To make matters worse, none of the extras hear her shrieking and telling him to stop. They just laugh at his silly goofy antics and the wacky things Flubber does with his feet.\n\nMercifully, he ends up bouncing high enough to where he’s forced to let her go. She returns to Shelby, panting and out of breath, while Brainard continues to show off and twirl around on the ceiling. Also everyone starts singing The Man on the Flying Trapeze repeatedly in perfect unison for no real reason. Biff and Hawk remain outside the action, so we thankfully cut back to them as they finish shoving the normal Model T into the parking space recently vacated by the flying car being towed in the background. They finish not a moment too soon. The military trio arrives, so they point out that Brainard is the wacko spinning around the beams on the ceiling.\n\nThe military is astonished by Brainard’s wild acrobatics. Finally, Brainard comes back down to Earth with the promise of something even more amazing. He monologues for a solid two minutes just to convince the trio to sit in his car. But when he pulls the lever to rise into the air, nothing happens! He examines every inch of the Model T to find what’s wrong and finds that somebody replaced his Flubber with some birds and a squirrel on a wheel! He begs the military guys to believe him, but they just load into the taxi and drive away.\n\nEveryone who isn’t named Ned Brainard is having a pretty good night, all things considered. Hawk congratulates Biff on mischief successfully managed. Shelby congratulates himself on winning Betsy because it’s obviously a foregone conclusion now that his rival is out of the picture. Oh, wait, never mind, good times are over. Betsy kicks him to the curb after he quotes one too many pretentious, out of context Shakespeare lines at her. Finally, she shows a modicum of self-respect! Aaand she immediately ruins it by going out to comfort Brainard. Why. He doesn’t even seem to acknowledge that she’s there. He’s too busy moping about his failure. After all that, he remembers he has a ball of Flubber in his pocket, which could have easily solved everything. Still babbling incoherently, he instructs Betsy to drop the ball and watch it bounce ever higher, a source of limitless energy.\n\nThe epiphany continues as he notices that the car in front of him doesn’t have a radio. Somebody switched the cars! And he knows just who did it. Betsy interrupts his yammering to say, apropos of nothing, that she finally believes he’s not crazy and he’s created something amazing. They hug, all is forgiven, and she comes crawling back to him. Why?! Why would you go back to a man who neglects you so badly he forgets your wedding three times?! I mean, Shelby isn’t a great option either, but they are hardly the only two options. Ugh. Second-wave feminism started to become widespread in the early ‘60s and I cannot wait until it starts showing itself in these movies. I’ll defend the princesses but the bad writing on this girl is hurting my soul.\n\nNow that she’s found her rightful place as Brainard’s arm candy (ugh), the reconciled couple pay Hawk a visit. They’ve covered a pair of shoes with Flubber just for him, feeding him lines about how much more money he can make off shoes than a flying car. The idea that only 8% of people bought cars in 1961 is mind-boggling to me, but that’s a thing Betsy says. Credit where credit is due, the boys actually listen to her, which is a step forward from other movie’s I’ve watched for this project. Looking at you, Westward Ho. Hawk puts the Flubberized shoes on and bounces so high Brainard and Betsy have to drag him back down. These shoes surely have practical applications that are more valuable than money, not that I ever got the impression Hawk cared. For example, Brainard jumps off the balcony to demonstrate a way to safely escape a hypothetical fire with Flubber shoes.\n\nThorougly convinced now, Hawk jumps off the same balcony after him. Or, more accurately, Betsy pushes him off. Naturally, he bounces. And he bounces. And he bounces higher! The POV camera angle here was a clever idea, but it made me dizzy and I had to look away for a minute. Anyway, Hawk pleads to find out how to stop so he doesn’t become a statistic like Slue Foot Sue, but Brainard will only tell him on one condition. Faced with no other option, Hawk divulges that the Flubberized car is in a warehouse. So Brainard and Betsy drive off and leave him bouncing there! Our protagonist, ladies and germs. Hawk desperately calls Biff for help but, being a teenager, Biff just thinks it’s cool.\n\nOur questionable heroes creep around the warehouse where Hawk keeps all the stuff his company repossesses. Brainard’s foot gets stuck in a harp, and the resulting noise alerts the goons Hawk hired to guard the place. As she tries to free her boyfriend’s foot, something even more tragic happens: Betsy breaks a nail! Yup. That’s something they thought was necessary. Brainard removes his Flubberized shoe and is able to pull his foot out all by himself with a minimum of string twanging, thus sparing the rest of Betsy’s manicure.\n\nThe fire department rushes out to help save the bouncing Hawk, led by Chief Ed Wynn, the Mad Hatter himself! Now, I’m going to come back to this, but Hawk is played by Ed Wynn’s son Keenan, and one of the basketball players is played by his son Ned. So there’s three generations of the Wynn family here! Tragically, Ed was reaching the end of his life by this point and having trouble memorizing lines, but his improv skills were as sharp as ever so his scene is still a comedy highlight. Okay, tangent over, the fire department tries and hilariously fails to get Hawk down. All the while, Biff keeps up a running commentary to a variety of girls, using his dad’s misfortune to show off.\n\nAfter some banter, Hawk’s goons decide to investigate the harp noises. They catch Brainard in the act of trying to break open the garage so he can fly his car out. They charge him, and he bounces right over their heads, causing them to barrel into the garage door. The door shakes, and Brainard has an idea! So he tricks them into charging again. And he jumps over their heads again. The door shakes harder. So they do it again. And again. Like the basketball scene, it goes on forever and does nothing different. Meanwhile, Betsy stands there. Doesn’t help. Doesn’t try to trip up the thugs. Doesn’t cheer Brainard on. Just stands there.\n\nThe Amazing Bouncing Hawk becomes an attraction in the town, drawing a huge crowd and even a hot dog vendor. A reporter shows up to get some comments from the viewers, and he’s played by the legendary Wally Boag! He doesn’t do a whole lot as far as film goes, but he’s all over the parks, originating the role of Pecos Bill at the Golden Horseshoe Revue and voicing Jose in the Enchanted Tiki Room. So while we won’t be seeing much of him, he’s a big deal and it was cool getting to see him. Biff is now the talk of the town, with a groovy and hip girl on each arm to swoon over him. Finally, finally the whole Medfield football team tackles Hawk and successfully grounds him, even though weight isn’t supposed to have any kind of effect on Flubber. Consistency is hard.\n\nOnce he’s brought back to Earth, Hawk snatches Biff and drags him off to the warehouse. The human battering rams are worn out, so Brainard dumps water on them to wake them up and repeat the same gag again. The 867th time is the charm, and one more bash breaks the doors open. Brainard and Betsy hop in the car and take flight, right over the Hawks’ heads! The goons jump in Hawk’s car and our third car chase in a row begins! Biff tries to stop his father shooting his professor, but Hawk has hit that moment in Disney villainy where reason’s kinda out.\n\nAnd how does Brainard get out of this predicament? Why, the good old Shelby Stomp, of course! He bounces on Hawk’s roof just like he did to Shelby, only this time Hawk kinda deserves it. Once again, his victim crashes head on with Officer Hanson. All he needs to see this time is the smoking gun in Hawk’s hand. The loan shark can throw his name and his money around all he wants, but he’s not getting out of this one. Hanson has a personal beef with him, you see, as Hawk repossessed his refrigerator. Brainard casually rolls up to ask for direction to Washington DC, and Hanson watches in astonishment as he flies off into the sky.\n\nThat would have been a perfectly serviceable ending, but this movie refuses to put me out of my misery. So as the flying Model T makes its way to Washington, the air force gets ready to deal with the unidentified flying object invading government air space. Stock footage of Air Force pilots suggests that they’re mobilizing and changes the whole film quality while they’re at it. We return to our couple, spouting some inane dialogue about how beautiful the sky is that ends in Brainard smooching his girl. Suddenly, a plane zooms out of stock footage land, shooting right at them! The stunned pilot recognizes the Model T and reports back to his superior for further instructions. Well, there’s no protocol for flying cars, so he has to check with the colonel, and his superior has to check with the general.\n\nAs the question of how to handle a flying car moves up the chain of command, Brainard lies low inside a cloud. Betsy whines that the wet, cold cloud is ruining her hair, because lol women. It’s not like you’re being shot at our anything. Once the coast clears, they take a whimsical tour over stock footage of Washington DC, chit-chatting about how beautiful while stock footage of missiles prepare for launch. Brainard almost crashes into the Washington Monument and Betsy messes up the names of a bunch of famous memorials because lol women are uneducated it’s so funny guys. Not that Brainard is any better, carrying a map from 1917 in his glove box. Where did he even get that?\n\nSuddenly, an urgent news bulletin interrupts the cheery music playing on the radio, warning of an unidentified flying object flying over Washington DC. Brainard and Betsy are like “that’s weird, I don’t see anything” because good Lord everyone in this thing is infuriatingly stupid. At the same moment, with overblown and synchronized expressions of panic, they realize that the thing the government wants to shoot down is them! It reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas (“they’re trying to hit us!”), except that movie’s actually good and I wish I was watching that instead. Jack might be an idiot, but at least he’s entertaining.\n\nIn the absence of a radio transmitter, Brainard starts yelling down to the ground instead of… you know, landing the car. He promises that he’s an American with the credit cards to prove it, but the general is a couple hundred feet below and inside a building so he can’t hear him. He’s forced to take refuge behind the Capitol dome. The general warns that if he doesn’t hear from them by the count of ten, he’ll blow them up, despite his advisors’ warnings that doing so will murder the whole legislative branch. Only the threat of messing up the Capitol’s new paint job stays his hand. I have to admit, that part was pretty funny.\n\nThe three military guys from before hear the words “flying Model T” and race out to have a look. They can’t believe it! It was true all along! They grab the general’s radio and squabble over which of their bases Brainard should land the car on. Betsy protests that her hair is a mess and she has nothing to wear, because that’s a woman’s priorities lol so funny. Brainard ignores her silly female protests and lands… somewhere. Military personnel swarm the car, not to lead them to a top-secret government prison but to a press release! The President is more than willing to listen to science, in case there was any doubt that this is fictional, and all of America embraces Flubber. Best of all, Betsy and Brainard finally get married!\n\nI talked a lot of smack about this movie. I’m not going to pretend I liked it. But you know what? Like Swiss Family Robinson, I can actually see why this movie was so popular in the early ‘60s. It’s just that its brand of humor hasn’t aged particularly well. The special effects are astounding for the time and there are a small handful of lines that made me smile. Casual sexism was unfortunately par for the course when this was made Totally get all that. I’m still annoyed by it and I stand by my assertion that we’ve seen much better female leads in earlier movies, but I understand the whole “different time” thing.\n\nThere are two major problems with this film. The ever-changing rules on what Flubber can do took me right out of the film. Anything that constantly gains velocity should break the hand of anyone who tries to catch it. Weight has no effect on it when the plot needs it to fly a car, but when the plot needs football players to drag Hawk down, suddenly weight affects it. Come on, writers. The first rule of sci-fi/fantasy is to set your world’s rules and stick to them, and they broke that at every convenience. The other thing is the characters. None of them are likeable, least of all our protagonist. It’s like watching a bunch of sociopaths bickering while the narrative begs us to sympathize with them. The situations they found themselves in would have been so much funnier if I wasn’t tired of dealing with these people.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nNed Brainard is the worst of the bunch, and unfortunately, he’s our protagonist. He’s selfish, he’s stubborn, and he’s completely clueless as to how interpersonal relationships work. I’m not even just talking about Betsy. He acts like a dbag to his housekeeper, his girlfriend’s boss, and his dog, too! His comedic antics weren’t funny or charming in the least. The plot, not his actions, decides he’s a hero, so we’re stuck being told to root for him as he maliciously messes with his rival and stalks his girlfriend who very explicitly wants nothing to do with him. It was enormously frustrating. Fred Macmurray is back for his second Disney film, and I can only hope that the rest of his movies give him more pleasant characters.\n\nBetsy Carlisle is probably the most forgiving woman on the planet. Who gives somebody a second chance after being left at the altar, let alone a third or fourth? Like, girl. He’s proven time and again that you’ll never be a priority in his life. Oh, and I thought Roberta was poorly written? I’ll take her over whatever happened here any day. She’s written like a piece of meat for Brainard and Shelby to fight over, with no agency of her own at all, for the first half of the movie. In the second half, after she decisively picks Brainard, she becomes a brainless ditz only concerned with her hair and makeup. Now, I am not against a girl caring about how she looks, but it’s presented as both the butt of the joke and her only personality trait. Poor Nancy Olson. She got to be so much more in Pollyanna.\n\nProfessor Shelby Ashton is Betsy’s other prospect, and he’s not a great option, either. He’s more pretentious than Frank Goodman from Ten Who Dared, with the same habit of reciting poetry no one cares about. What kind of disaster of a human confesses their love to her woman on the steps of the church right before she marries another man? And he keeps doing stuff like that! He’s 100% convinced that he’s such a catch that Betsy will immediately fall into his arms the second Brainard finally takes a hint. He’s played by Elliot Reid, best known for appearing with Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\n\nAlonzo P. Hawk appears for the first of several times here to antagonize Brainard. Honestly, he’s probably the least unlikable character because at least he’s up front about being evil. It’s also really interesting how early the corrupt corporate executive trope became a thing, when people like this are so widespread in real life society now. He’s played by Keenan Wynn, who, as I previously mentiond, is the son of the legendary Ed Wynn. He’s a pretty big deal in his own right, appearing in classics like Zeigfield Follies, Annie Get Your Gun, and Dr. Strangelove. Animation buffs might recognize his distinctive voice as Captain Cully in The Last Unicorn or the Winter Warlock in the stop motion Santa Clause is Coming to Town.\n\nBiff Hawk reminded me a lot of Draco Malfoy: a snotty, snide rich kid who is a clear product of his environment because he’s nowhere near as bad as his father. Sure, he has moments of active malice, like coming up with the idea of swapping the cars and putting a squirrel in the engine, but he doesn’t want to see Medfield closed or Brainard hurt. Tommy Kirk is playing against type a bit here, playing the popular jock instead of the weedy nerd like Ernst or Wilby.\n\nMUSIC\n\nGeorge Bruns returns to provide the quirky, offbeat score. Honestly, it was the music that provided such a huge disconnect between the presentation of Brainard’s actions and my interpretation of them. For example, the “Shelby Stomp” scene is underscored by a light, whimsical piece like a Looney Tunes chase scene. It didn’t work for me.\n\nMedfield Fight Song is the only song to appear in the movie. Musically, it’s unremarkable, but serves its purpose as, well, a college fight song. However, it is significant to Disney history. This is the first of many, many, many, many Disney songs written by the incomparable Richard M and Robert B Sherman! They’ll go on to write much better and more memorable songs for dozens of movies in the near future. This, though? Not your best work, guys.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nThe Absent-Minded Professor is one of only a few films Disney released in black and white in an effort to keep costs down. The other reason for this is to hide the special effects, just like in The Shaggy Dog. This is where I’m willing to throw this movie a few bones. For the time, these effects are spectacular. The wire work on the bouncing is impeccable, utilizing a new invention called the double piano wire harness. Using two wires instead of the customary one allowed a lot more freedom of movement and increased safety. Filmmakers also used wooden miniatures to great effect, notably in the flying car scenes. The rear projection used to create the illusion of driving through the clouds (or down the street) has aged less well, but it still looks better than the river scenes in Ten Who Dared or Davy Crockett and the River Pirates. They’re learning!\n\nAs far as the look of the film goes, it’s pretty standard. Most of the sets were reused from The Shaggy Dog or Zorro. Some of the exteriors even utilized Disney’s own offices and animation building! The effect is the same Anytown USA vibe we got from The Shaggy Dog, which isn’t unexpected since apparently the two movies both take place in Medfield. And they won’t be the only ones. It’s crazy how many people in this town look exactly like Tommy Kirk.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI really wanted to like this one, guys. It’s such a classic and I’ve seen loads of reviewers rate it quite highly. I just could not stand Brainard and the bad writing on Nancy made Roberta from Swiss Family Robinson look progressive. There are some great ideas here that could make a really fun comedy, but I just don’t think they got there. Yet.\n\nFavorite scene: Charlie playing with the bouncing shoes right before the endless basketball game. Everything’s better with cute doggies."
