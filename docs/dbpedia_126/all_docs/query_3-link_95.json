        "text": "Three for three in favor of Avi Nesher as an underappreciated trash auteur. The kind of movie that is at the same time no-nonsense but also packed with it. Gruner plays a rancher who gets almost-killed by a dude who makes VR games ('Rump Wrangler') for convoluted reasons, comes back as a somersaulting, kickboxing, animal-powered Jesus, complete with a soundboard of lion/tiger/whatever growls. The bad guy looks like a mix of George Costanza & Mark Strong and tries to bargain with Gruner by going \"It's the 90's, let's watch TV\" which is just a little sampler, as a treat.\n\nI've always taken issue with the writers notion that as long as you commit to an outlandish concept, the audience will follow along. Sometimes this is true, but all too often this leads to thoughtless, convoluted worldbuilding which, in this instance, allowed Savage to become the biggest load of insane nonsense I've seen in some time. In fact, I would go so far as to call this a few dead politicians short of a fully realized Neil Breen film. Whether that's a point of praise or not depends on your perspective, I suppose.\n\nOlivier Gruner, AKA Jean Claude Can't-Act, stars as Farmer Savage, a man who's entire family was murdered by Buster Bluth, leaving him susceptible to brain hijacking by…\n\nA warrior of cosmic proportions, destined to avenge the earth, his family, and even his own spirit, uses the power of the land to eviscerate anyone who wishes ill on this world, our minds, or our hearts, but mainly, he's just plain had enough of these VR-based, reality bending, ubercapitalists murdering innocent families wholesale so that they can use the spirit vortex under the family's land to ascend in evolutionary structure and ultimately control the minds of everyone on earth.\n\nTbh, I feel him.\n\n2 movies in, and I feel comfortable calling Olivier Gruner the Brando of 90's DTV cyberaction.\n\n2 movies in, and I feel comfortable calling Avi Nesher the Kubrick of dumpy, cheesy 90's VHStrashcore.\n\nDefend Your Stonehenge\n\nHappy Fucking Fathers Day.\n\n\"Hunk hunt. Beef quest.\"\n\nThis is one of the most 90's thing I've ever seen. In a good way!\n\nOlivier Gruner's perfect life gets derailed by multiple murders, an extended bout of bed-rest and a reawakening of his primal instincts to battle an evil scientist, plus a lot of supernatural weirdness, ancient deities and virtual reality. Along the way, he encounters a bunch of characters named for famous authors, gets a terrible haircut and ruins Jennifer Grant's cop life.\n\nPlot wise, it's just so batshit that it can't possibly work. But respect must be given for attempting to cram so much oddness into one movie. And Gruner is given some time to shine, though mostly just clawing or hopping around at people like Pumaman. Kario Salem also makes an excellent, occasionally giddy and occasionally buoyant villain.\n\nExtra points go to Kristin Minter who, as the big bad's tech support, often seems exactly as incredulous with the latest plot developments as a person should be.\n\nFreewheeling high adventure and off-Broadway Total Recall/Snow Crash/Lawnmower Man futurism from the desk of Avi Nesher (She, Timebomb). Some dated but really cool CGI and lots of visual action set-pieces in a variety of science fictiony environments. This is the second cyberpunk flick I've seen in the past couple of months to feature a nefarious VR game mogul, and this time we actually get to see some of these games, such as a perverse VR sex game, a VR King Kong game, a cat burglar/assassin simulation game. The story totally goes for it and takes a stab at monomythical archaeological cryptography lore that isn't explained until about an hour into the film—that's what we call restraint, kids.\n\nDamn what a disappointment... on paper this gonzo-philosophical scifi affair should be great and one of the French cyborg's best... but damn... the mostly sub-par execution and humdrum action really hold it back. Needed way more 90's CGI as well.\n\nThe idea just isn't enough. May re-visit on VHS in the future.\n\nAvi Nesher cranks the R-rated Sega CD fever-dream vibe up to eleven for this Olivier Gruner action-sci-fi head-spinner about a farmer who is traumatized after seeing his family murdered in cold blood, so after getting checked into a hospital for years he escapes to wander the desert before being transformed into the titular SAVAGE by... Mr. Burns ghosts? Magical cave paintings? Something??!?!\n\nAnd there's a Virtual Reality tech-mogul bad dude who is connected to all of this for some reason? And now Gruner has caveman style strength and jumps around the whole movie making animal noises and clawing dudes in the face?\n\nThis movie is fucking off-the-wall for the entirety of its 100-minute running time. Absolutely un-ratable, but I'd give it a hundred stars and fifteen hearts if I could. This movie is a total mind-melter.\n\nIt also has a CGI skeleton, so extra bonus points times a thousand.\n\nTECHNOLOGY IS GOD!\n\nA very funny story is undone by a lack of solid action. Oliver Grunner fights like he's wielding Mad Monkey Kung Fu, but all we get are a few people thrown through windows. It would have been a flat-out classic if the PM gang had been behind the wheel.\n\nCommits the mortal sin of having Virtual Reality be all over the place, but we never get to see anyone fight in VR.\n\nThe role Olivier Gruner was born to play as he jumps and punches his way into our hearts.\n\nA film that's more 1986 than 1996 and I mean that in a good way.\n\nA farmers family gets iced and he winds up wandering the desert after being held in an asylum. Things get nuts when he winds up in a cave and meets glowing beings.\n\nCheap and a little ropey, that didn't stop me from having a great time. Gruner has almost no dialogue but lots of fight scenes. The cyber tastic finale is something to behold.\n\nKristin Minter is a bombshell as the Evil guys sidekick, what a babe.\n\nFilm #370 of 2023."
