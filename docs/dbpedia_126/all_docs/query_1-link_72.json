He already did a final Rocky flick so what's next, a sequel to Cliffhanger?\n\nThere Will Be Blood This drama, based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, just picked up eight Oscar nominations, including best picture, best actor for Daniel Day-Lewis and best director, Paul Thomas Anderson. Day-Lewis stars as an oil man whose evil knows no bounds. With Paul Dano, Ciaran Hinds and Dillon Freasier.\n\nUntraceable Modern times created a new film genre, the cyber terrorist film. Diane Lane stars as an FBI cyber specialist trying to stop a man using the internet to kill his victims. He then turns his skills toward making her life hell. With Colin Hanks, Mary Beth Hurt.\n\nNOW SHOWING\n\nAtonement A tragic love story, set during the era of World War II, about lovers separated by a lie created in a fit of childish jealousy by a 13-year-old. The film stars Keira Knightly, James McAvoy and Saoirse Ronan. The tragedy is that the trappings and recreation of the era are wonderful, but the characters are one-dimentional. We aren't given enough information about the relationship between the lady of the house and the housekeeper's son before they are separated to care about their fate as much as we should. **\n\nCharlie Wilson's War The story of Charlie Wilson is astounding. A seemingly minor member of Congress, he was able to send more than a billion dollars in covert funds to Afghanistan -- joined in his effort by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Israel -- to help Afghan rebels successfully repel the Soviet empire in the late 1980s. He helped bring down the Berlin Wall and bust up the Soviet Union and its stranglehold on Eastern Europe. The consequences in the short term were globally crowd-pleasing. However, like a Pandora's box, the urge to use force to bring down nations -- covertly or with full disclosure -- has a trickle down effect when that box is leaking. It didn't take long for big chunks of Eastern Europe to explode in civil war once the Soviet fist was gone. Of more direct consequence to the United States, in the poverty of post-war Afghanistan, the Taliban rose to power and we all know how that turned out. A great starting five of film artists -- director Mike Nichols, writer Adam Sorkin and actors Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman -- have put their distinctive spin on the story of Charlie Wilson. Hanks is particularly adept in the colorful title role of a cocaine snorting, womanizing politician. Wilson's skills of browbeating, manipulation, and his own particular brand of patriotism were remarkably effective tools. Roberts and Hoffman add nice supporting turns as, respectively, a society woman who channels her evangelical fervor and anti-communist fury into effective fundraising, and a charmless C.I.A. operative who has the knowledge and contacts to spend the money wisely. Sorkin's political savvy adds to the believability of an unbelievable story, and Mike Nichols orchestrates the Afghan-D.C. war dance with a subtle layer of black comedy. The connection to today's global politics in the Middle East is presented without hitting us over the head, a nice change of pace from the other recent movies that have tried to find a voice for this nation's frustration at the Iraq-Afghanistan-Iran mess. Charlie Wilson's War at least lets us know that the CIA does get it right sometimes, with the help of friends in high places. ***\n\nDinosaurs 3D: Giants of Patagonia is an example of what the IMAX 3D format does to perfection. It is the perfect blend of scholarly information and totally cool dinosaurs brought to vivid life. As an added bonus, Donald Sutherland does the narration. ***\n\nEnchanted Written by Bill Kelly (Blast From the Past) and directed by Kevin Lima (102 Dalmatians), this is a Disney feel-good romantic comedy fable that plays with the classic image of Disney animation. We first meet Giselle (Amy Adams) as a blissfully happy animated creature from the land of Andalasia, whose animal friends -- led by her chipmunk best pal Pip (Jeff Bennett, Kevin Lima) -- help her with her sewing and singing. Her desire to meet a prince charming is granted when her song attracts the rugged Prince Edward (James Marsden). Marriage plans are put on hold, however, when Edward's wicked stepmother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) sends Giselle down a well to the most monstrous land she can think of: modern New York City. That's where Patrick Dempsey shows up as a single dad and divorce attorney, Robert Philip. He helps the damsel in distress, with tons of encouragement from his fantasy-loving daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). The intrusion of the real world into Giselle's perky, animated, life-is-always-perfect mindset clashes big time with the life-is-hard, love-is-fleeting reality of Robert's life as a divorce attorney. The enchantment comes when these two worlds rub off on each other. Giselle finds out that life and love is much more complicated in the real world, and that one's true love isn't always the one that has been drawn for you. Amy Adams provides the pixie dust that turns New York into a land of enchantment. ***\n\nThe Great Debaters Here is the debate topic: should a movie based on true events stick to the true facts or mold them to enhance the drama? Denzel Washington, as director and star of The Great Debaters, takes the latter position in the affirmative. His second film as a director is about a debate team from a small black college in Texas in 1935 that successfully debates a white college, and will eventually challenge Harvard University. The filmmakers have hugely fictionalized the account, including the final showdown, which actually took place against the University of Southern California. Obviously, the historical implications of a win over Harvard seems more David vs. Goliath than a victory over USC. Washington could easily counter my argument that the change of opponent is annoying and unnecessary by noting that his film is not a documentary. Therefore, he and the screenwriters have the right to forge a compelling look at life in the Jim Crow South using the debate team premise as a jumping off point. Point taken. The Great Debaters is an engaging look at a time and place when black men and women who desired an education and a place of honor had to fight for dignity and respect against overwhelming forces. A scene depicting a lynching emphasizes that this second-class citizenship also meant that the ignorant had the right to murder with impunity. In the oasis of freedom and education provided by Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, Washington plays the debate coach and social activist Melvin B. Tolson. His debaters are James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), the 14-year-old son of a theology professor played by Forest Whitaker; Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), articulate, talented and hot-headed; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a play-it-safe type, and Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), an aspiring lawyer and firebrand. As the social ills of the era swirl around them, the Wiley debate team forges an undefeated season. The final showdown with Harvard provides all the underdog vs. top-dog dynamics you'd expect. While Washington and Forest Whitaker add their Oscar-winning heft to the proceedings, the film belongs to the team members, in particular the wonderful Jurnee Smollett, who had proven her acting chops at age 11 with her brilliant performance in Eve's Bayou. She embodies the strength of will and passion needed to succeed as an ambitious black woman in the 1930s. The Great Debaters smooths out the edges too much to be a great film, but it is a good one. ***\n\nI Am Legend Will Smith has a tough assignment in this film. Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, he has to spend most of his screen time as the only human on screen. Of course he has the advantage of a canine companion rather than a soccer ball named Wilson. Thanks to his likable persona, audiences are willing to go along for this desolate ride. Based on a novel by Richard Matheson, the film is a classic end-of-humanity-as-we-know-it scenario. Robert Neville is the last survivor in Manhattan, the epicenter of a virus that wiped out humanity. Despite his feeling that he is all that is left of the human race, Neville is trying to find a cure for the hordes of infected monsters that come out at night. Smith's ability to inject his humanity into the mix makes the bleakness palatable most of the time. The CGI effects, however, especially at the end when we see more of the living dead in action, are distractingly mediocre, like a bad video game. That said, Will Smith manages to survive that distraction and make I Am Legend an intriguing look at a future we pray never happens. ***\n\nJuno When you attend a film festival, you hope for several \"wow\" moments, movies that defy current expectations of cinematic mediocrity. Juno provided just such a moment at the Toronto International Film Festival this past September. Directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking) and written by original thinker Diablo Cody, the film's hilarious dialogue, fresh characters and ability to travel a cinematic path less taken combine to make it a movie that sticks to your ribs. Juno (Ellen Page of Hard Candy fame) is a 16-year-old who doesn't run with the pack at school. She's smart and sassy, and as the film begins, she is confronting a major lapse in judgment. She has gone and gotten herself knocked up via her geeky pal, Paulie (Michael Cera). She confronts this news head-on, weighing her options and confiding in her best pal Leah (Olivia Thirlby), while she decides how to break it to her parents, her gruff, likable dad (J.K. Simmons) and her anti-stereotypical stepmom (Allison Janney). Juno decides to give the baby up for adoption. Leah finds a childless couple, Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman), and the process of getting to know the prospective parents begins. Juno has to deal with a lot of emotional weight, and what is so spectacular about Ellen Page's performance is that she conveys the angst behind her down-to-earth facade and pithy one-liners. The filmmaking team of Reitman and screenwriter Cody have taken the premise of a teen comedy and injected it with an anti-cliché serum. ****.\n\nThe Kite Runner A film that both soars like its kite metaphor on the air currents of good storytelling, and falls to earth when its credibility is cut out from under it. Based on the novel by Afghan-American Khaled Hosseini and directed by Marc Forster (Monster's Ball), is at its best when it is providing an engrossing look at a culture that is mostly known to Americans through the excesses of the Taliban. Putting a human face on the cultures that are currently being disrupted by war reminds Americans that we might not be seeing the agony of innocents mangled emotionally and physically on the nightly news, but that agony is taking place nonetheless. Set in Kabul in 1978, just before the Soviet invasion, we are introduced to childhood friends Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada) whose major passion is kite flying. This friendship, however, is also steeped in the racial pecking order all cultures seem to need in order to justify one race's superiority over another. Amir's father is a well-to-do Pashtun, a Sunni Muslim. His son is deemed worthy of education and standing in the community. Hassan is a Hazara, a Shia Muslim. As descendants of the Mongolians, they are not educated and are given subservient roles in the community. Hassan's father works for Amir's father, Baba (Homayoun Ershadi). Hassan has the guts to stand up to bullies and protects Amir. Amir has overheard his father talking about his lack of guts. Hurt by these words, he will eventually twist that hurt into undeserving hatred toward the loyal Hassan. Not only does he do nothing when Hassan is brutally assaulted, he will lie about Hassan in order to dishonor him and rid himself of his own shame. Years later Amir graduates from college, falls in love, gets married and writes a successful novel. However, when his father's friend Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub) asks him to come back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, he goes against his nature and agrees to the trip. Khan tells him something about his father that shocks Amir, hoping it will inspire him to regain his lost honor and do the right thing by his friend Hassan.\n\nIt is this mission that one finds hard to swallow. The Amir we have known would not risk his life despite his guilt. That he could accomplish the mission of sneaking a child out from under the noses of the Taliban stretches credulity to the breaking point and beyond. It's an ending that makes for an emotionally explosive finish as kites fly again in the freedom provided by America, but there is a bit too much manipulation to manufacture that feel-good finale. The Kite Runner has moments that are emotionally rousing and filled with poetry, but it also comes crashing to earth right before it sends us flying once more on the wings of hope, muting the beauty of that hope. **½\n\nNational Treasure: Book of Secrets Nicolas Cage returns as treasure hunter Ben Gates in this sequel to National Treasure. A weak carbon copy of the original, it lacks the inventiveness of the first film, although adding Helen Mirren as Ben's mom was an inspired casting choice. When a missing page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth surfaces, Ben's great-great grandfather is suddenly implicated as a key conspirator in Abraham Lincoln's death. Co-stars Diane Kruger, Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris, Justin Bartha and Jon Voight. **\n\nNo Country For Old Men While one can make the argument that Joel and Ethan Coen's best movie is a toss-up between Miller's Crossing or Fargo, their debut film Blood Simple is the movie that gave them the opportunity to develop their wonderful, eclectic body of work. No Country For Old Men is a crime story that finds the Coen Brothers in a blood simple state of mind -- their particular, intoxicating blend of bloodletting and dry humor. It pits a psychotic assassin played by Javier Bardem against a good ol' boy played by Josh Brolin in a fascinating chase across Texas border towns. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong and walks away with $2 million. Smart enough to know he probably won't get away with keeping the loot, but determined to try anyway, Moss becomes the target of the man sent to recover the cash, the dead-eyed killer Anton Chigurh (Bardem). Chigurh is a relentless, emotionless killer who uses a coin flip to decide whether someone lives or dies. He leaves a string of corpses in his wake as he continues his deadly pursuit. The Coen Brothers had been in a recent slump, with such stumbles as Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers. Now, joined by an eclectic cast headed by Spanish superstar Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Jones, Irish actress Kelly MacDonald and Josh Brolin -- an actor heretofore better known for being married to a star (Diane Lane) and as Barbra Streisand's stepson -- the Coen Brothers have delivered one of the best films of the year. Combined with his work this year in Grindhouse and American Gangster, Josh Brolin has completed his breakthrough year with an Oscar worthy performance. Bardem, a previous nominee for The Sea Inside, is a shoo-in to pick up another nod, and the Coen Brothers should be on the Oscar list as well. No coin toss needed. ***½\n\nThe Orphanage A creepy, but not exactly haunting, Spanish haunted-house flick. It is about a woman who, along with her husband and son, comes to live in the former orphanage where the wife (played by Belén Rueda) once lived. Bad things happened here under the Franco regime. Her son begins to see children who may or may not be in his imagination. When the boy disappears, his obsessed mother is sure the house has something to do with it and is determined to find him, even when her husband has given up hope. Belén Rueda is terrific as the mother, and the film has several excellent jolts for those who prefer suspense to gore. However, the movie is not quite as good at the end as it was at the beginning. **\n\nP.S. I Love You It's great to see double Oscar winner Hilary Swank flexing her romantic comedy muscles, and Gerard Butler is engaging in a role that lets him be flesh and blood rather than CGI-enhanced (300). There is also great support from Kathy Bates, Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow in this tale of love lost and getting on with it. Swank is the weeping widow who has lost her man to a brain tumor -- the messy details of that are kept off screen -- but keeps hanging on to her grief. It isn't easy to let go when your late husband (Butler) has arranged for letters to be sent to you, giving you a playbook for moving on. The movie, written and directed by Richard LaGravenese, often feels forced, but when the laugh-through-your-tears comedy is working, it is dynamite. LaGravenese worked with Swank earlier this year in the entertaining devoted-schoolteacher drama Freedom Writers. He has a nice rapport with Swank, which helps when his writing hits a maudlin patch or two in this outing. It could have been better, but it's good enough to be a solid girls' night out flick. **½\n\nSweeney Todd Stephen Sondheim's Grand Guignol masterpiece Sweeney Todd has been translated to celluloid by the only filmmaker who would dare attempt it, Tim Burton. With his muse Johnny Depp in the title role, this is a slasher film that unleashes its blood, guts and cannibalism to the tune of a witty Sondheim ditty. The transformation from a stylized stage show, which allowed the audience to separate the music from the mayhem, to the visceral bloodletting that cinema demands was Burton's burden. He succeeds in making us feel both the anguish of Sweeney Todd's fate and the monster that he becomes. Of course, his monstrosity is surpassed by the man who destroyed him (played by the perfectly cast Alan Rickman), and the woman who manipulated him, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). If you're in a glass-half-empty mood, stay away from sharp objects after viewing Burton's tribute to the evil that men do. **½\n\n27 Dresses Katherine Heigl (Grey's Anatomy) is making a nice transition from the small screen to the big first with Knocked Up, and now this romantic comedy about a woman who has been a bridesmaid 27 times. Charming James Marsden co-stars as the guy who falls for her.\n\nThe Water Horse: Legend of the Deep Any fan of Nessie -- a.k.a. the Loch Ness Monster -- has to be intrigued by this fantasy flick about a young boy who finds an egg that hatches into the adorable creature of the title. This helps fill the void left when NBC's comedy-drama Surface was cancelled. The young boy from Millions, Alex Atel, is just as adorable as the CGI-created critter Crusoe, and the story that surrounds them is better than expected. The excellent adult cast is headed by Brian Cox, Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin. ***\n\nMOVIE TIMES\n\nFRI., JAN. 25-THURS.
