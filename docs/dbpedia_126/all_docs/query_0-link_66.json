Effectively. That was also the session in which I got to cement my characters personality. He uses old (and older for him) quotes from various entertainment properties in combat.\n\nThis time it was Starcraft. Part of the CS patrol the heroes came across got hit bad with an 'Atomic Breath' attack (Bear in mind the GM cleverly never made mention that it was Godzilla, he just described it and made us wonder. I got lucky and realized it after.) so my walking tank takes a position so that the blast doesn't deafen allies. It's my turn:\n\n\"I'm gonna drop the hammer!\" Pylons are engaged, counter brace engine spooling up \"And dispense some indiscriminate justice!\"\n\nAnd then proceed to plink the next two high powered, MACH 5 accelerated shotgun blast on the giant beast's torso.\n\nNow, I'm frustrated as the dice don't wanna play nice with me. Or so I was assuming, so I tell my GM that I'm aiming for his balls. I've given up and if I'm going to miss, I'm going to be silly about it! So I roll the dice. The D8 shooting gives me a 2. Yeap, expected. But the Wild Die says, \"Hold up Hoss, where's a couple of 6s and a 2!\" So I actually hit and got at least one raise out of it! Then the damage dice tells me, \"Hoo, buddy, you'll be here a while!\" And then proceeds to stun everyone with literally rolling so high that I stopped counting in the mid 60s, and realized that I had gotten something like 12 ranks of damage on Godzilla's literal ass.\n\nSo that one lucky roll meant that not only did I circumsize the biggest, meanest monster this side of Tokyo, I also misted his tail, ploughed the six forests BEHIND him and probably threw steel 'buckshot' so far Chi-Town has to repaint the wall a bit!\n\nBrock Savage\n\nCosmic Barbarian\n\nJoined\n\nJun 17, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n5,013\n\nReaction score\n\n14,592\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#3\n\nOfficial: Solomon Kane, Realms of Cthulhu.\n\nUnofficial: Hyborian Age (Conan)\n\nThis guy had a real good grasp of the system and did some interesting things with it.

Like, aside from ghost rock - which isn't really steampunk, IMO, as it's just an infernal replacement for coal - you almost have to intentionally work the elements into your game if you want them there. I mean, the city-state of Deseret (Utah, more or less) kinda leans on it, but there's a shit ton to do in the setting without going there.\n\nErstwhile\n\nActive Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nAug 15, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n36\n\nReaction score\n\n71\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#13\n\nI forget it has steampunk elements sometimes.

Where needed, replace [steampunk element] with [supernatural element] but unless you're using published adventures, dial up the supernatural horror - of which there's a lot - and you can pretty much get rid of the steampunk.\n\nAs for Deseret, if I had it in a non-steampunk Deadlands, I'd probably base it off the not-Deseret from Dogs in the Vineyard.\n\nChris Brady\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n3,257\n\nReaction score\n\n3,744\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#14\n\nI only listed Rifts because I don't have any of the SWADE settings. Are there any out yet?\n\nI'm getting back into Rippers (I found the conversion doc), I'm looking for my hard copy of Thrilling Tales.\n\nOH! The Flash Gordon game! This is a solo game, because none of the other usual players like Flash Gordon (I'm like the only true pulp fan) so I'm playing a Power Man, an engineer that specializes in the Hydro Electric field. I actually tried to get Sanitation, but the GM said NO! I think she was assuming I was being silly. She was right. However, I've been really getting into him. He's a Mongo Man named Olm (Which is a play on Ohm, which I can get away with, because Flash Gordon's naming conventions says its OK.) He's a member of the Resistance, because Ming took his wife for his harem. Neither Ming nor anyone else, save the Power Man leader named Ergon, know this, though. It allows Olm to go places in Mingo City without arousing too much suspicion.\n\nThe main claim to fame is that Olm is both incredibly tough and strong, although he is pretty smart, his 6' 10\" frame is what most people remember. That and his 'Martial Arts' is actually WWE style wrestling. The GM is a HUGE 90's wrestling fan, I get bennies whenever I use the more famous moves.\n\nI've Stone Cold Stunned cavernosaurs (Two of them, crushing their skulls). Arm-barred his way through groups of Denizen (these were homebrewed minions, psychic rejects from the Imperial academies) who live in the sewers of Mingo City. German Suplexed most other critters, humanoid and others. And most of it has been done topless.\n\nOh, and inadvertently winning the heart of Queen Desira of Tropica. Which he can't really refuse, because then he'd have to tell why he hates Ming, which opens up to other people finding out... It's a glorious mess that I want to get back to.\n\nAlso, I second Streets of Bedlam suggestion AND if we're going to be going 3rd party, I'll add for those who like street level superhero stuff, I recommend the 'setting kit' Vigilante: Rise of The Powerless.\n\nchuckdee\n\nWelcome To The Terrordome\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 9, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n7,844\n\nReaction score\n\n21,400\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#15\n\nMy Top 5 (in no particular order):\n\nRifts - I've always liked the Rifts settings, but not the rules. And they were too far removed to be readily converted. This implementation is great.\n\nPowder Mage - I love the books and the world- Napoleonic military fiction with magic. More below.\n\nInterface Zero - Great cyberpunk world\n\nThe Sixth Gun - I like the feel of the 6th gun a lot better than Deadlands, though it covers much of the same ground.\n\nTour of Darkness - Vietnam era horror- very useful for my Delta Green campaign set during that time.\n\nIt's hard to get it down to just 5- I don't play Savage Worlds, but I buy a lot for source material because many people are doing amazing things with the system, and SW to Fate isn't that far of a stretch in most cases.\n\nFive others that on any given day might replace one of the above:\n\nNecessary Evil - Villains save the world. Brilliant concept, well executed.\n\nLankhmar - It's Lankhmar! I'd also add Guild of Shadows.\n\nNova Praxis - A great Transhumanism sci-fi setting. So good, I have it twice.\n\nFreeport - One of my favorite settings and goes very well with Lankhmar.\n\nGhost Ops - Modern day action/special ops.\n\nLast edited: Sep 3, 2020\n\nE-Rocker\n\nNot a goose\n\nJoined\n\nMar 25, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n3,895\n\nReaction score\n\n10,286\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#16\n\nchuckdee I've never heard of Powder Mage.

I agree with the general consensus that The Savage World of Solomon Kane was really well done - unfortunately it's out of print, which is the hazard of licensed games. Rippers would be a good choice to scratch the Gothic monster-hunting itch, albeit a couple centuries later. If your monster-hunting tastes run more towards gunplay, I heartily recommend Monster Hunter International. Finally, Heroes of Terra is a fantasy setting where inter-dimensional travelers from Earth fight malicious turtle-dragons on behalf of the humanoid fungi whose princess the reptiles have captured. It's really well thought out for such an outlandish premise.\n\nchuckdee\n\nWelcome To The Terrordome\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 9, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n7,844\n\nReaction score\n\n21,400\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#18\n\nchuckdee I've never heard of Powder Mage. What's its deal?\n\nPowder Mage is based on a series of books by Brian McClellan, starting with the novel Promise of Blood. They are set in a universe of emerging techology (circa early 1800s, I'd say) that has very heavy use of magic in the setting. It reads in large part like military fiction. As far as magic, they have The Privileged, the Knacked, and Powder Mages.\n\nThe Knacked have a single magical talent that is sometimes useful in application, but never overly powerful. They might scent a lie, or never sleep, or be able to tell how much something weighs by picking it up.\n\nThe Privileged are the dominant magical force- not exceedingly rare, but rare enough that they hold much of the power. They are the closest to traditional magic users, and are feared in war and out of it, being able to manipulate energies from an alternate universe (the Else) to a variety of effects. They have a particular focus for their magic- their hands. The right hand draws power from the Else, and the left hand manipulates the effect.\n\nPowder Mages (also called 'Marked') are somewhere between these two extremes, and are pretty much the leveling force against the Privileged. Instead of drawing power from the Else, they draw it from gunpowder. If they imbibe it, it makes them more of pretty much everything- stronger, faster, enduring, perceptive, etc. They can also manipulate gunpowder- the closer the better, but at distance too, making it explode- in large and small quantities. They can also redirect the location that the powder's force is felt, most often used to 'float' bullets, by causing the reaction of powder in their horn to nudge their bullets in flight.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nDumarest\n\nVaquero de Alta California\n\nJoined\n\nJan 20, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n15,721\n\nReaction score\n\n34,533\n\nSep 2, 2020\n\n#19\n\nOH!

Deadlands always seemed interesting, but cold never get a group interested enough to commit money. Then came Savage Rifts, during the first Kickstarter, I wasn't able to back it, but this really caught my attention. What I was able to back was GI Joe... Freedom Squadron, which was a nice nod to some 80s favorites. Then when the second Savage Rifts campaign came along, I was all in. Which, I suppose is another nostalgia buy.\n\nThat said, our group has been running the Shadows of Nxla plot point campaign and I wish there was a bit more support for situations where PCs don't do this one exact thing. Wouldn't exactly call it a game on rails, but there are certainly some points where things feel a bit overly scripted due to the lack of options.\n\nPostmortem\n\nWell-Known Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMar 30, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n77\n\nReaction score\n\n159\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#22\n\nNecessary Evil.

And overall it was just a good dark fantasy setting that I could easily see being adapted to several systems I favoured at the time.\n\nMankcam\n\nHallowed Be Thy Swo\n\nJoined\n\nSep 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n6,088\n\nReaction score\n\n17,868\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#24\n\nNecessary Evil\n\nThrilling Tales\n\n50 Fathoms\n\nSolomon Kane\n\nDeadlands Reloaded\n\nWonderland No More\n\nBunch\n\nThe other Mods are geese!\n\nJoined\n\nAug 16, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n17,269\n\nReaction score\n\n37,952\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#25\n\nSlipstream - Pulp sci fi.\n\nThrilling Tales - pulp done well matched to an excellent pulp system.\n\nNecessary Evil - play the bad guys saving the world.

Good enough that I was entertaining a conversion during my brief SW burnout. Kenneth Hite pitched it as \"Conan: 1948\" but I feel \"Rifts: 1948\" might be a more accurate take.\n\nSolomon Kane is the one that got me into SW and which served as the springboard for my longest running SW game, a Hyborian Age mini-campaign using SK magic, fan material and Mongoose d20 Conan setting books.\n\nI have never played Necessary Evil but would love to. Villains-turned-heroes is a nice pitch that reminds me of the early Thunderbolts run.\n\nDeadlands Reloaded I would use as the base for something a lot more nondescript than canon Deadlands. I'd be happy to raid The Sixth Gun for ideas as well.\n\nHellfrost and Shaintar have some interesting bits (I don't mind a little vanilla D&Desque fantasy but it's not something I usually have in mind when I reach for SW).\n\nIn the same vein, Realms of Cthulhu is something I used to think of as tantamount to heresy but after getting Achtung! Cthulhu and learning Baulderstone used RoC to run Masks of Nyarlathotep, I grudgingly admit it may be a good fit for a certain sort of Mythos game.\n\nTommy Brownell\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nApr 30, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n4,042\n\nReaction score\n\n10,963\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#29\n\nWorth noting that the newest Deadlands has pivoted away from metaplot and such almost entirely, and refocused on localized horror.\n\nRagr\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nOct 23, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n299\n\nReaction score\n\n798\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#30\n\nHellfrost, despite it's generic tendencies provided some good old doom, gloom, miserable \"winter is cumin'\" style fantasy fare. It's original enough to rise above the parapet of blandola.\n\nSolomon Kane is just an absolute blast of olde worlde, righteous, hammy mayhem.\n\nWeird Wars 2 is great when I get the tone just right. Just a little grittier than Commando magazine. A little dirtier than action movie war films. And, a bit odd, like A Midnight Clear.\n\nDay After Ragnarok is so awesomely packed with ideas I actually have no idea what to do with it, or whether I ever will.\n\nStan\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nJul 30, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n2,499\n\nReaction score\n\n6,246\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#31\n\nHaven't played any recent ones but I've enjoyed\n\nSlipstream - it knows that it's not realistic and leans into pulp sf genre. They are in a place where you can breathe in space.\n\n50 Fathoms - pirate fun, ships detailed the right amount, crab characters\n\nSolomon Kane - thorough treatment and a new magic system. Has ideas good for any Reformation or similar era game.\n\nMankcam\n\nHallowed Be Thy Swo\n\nJoined\n\nSep 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n6,088\n\nReaction score\n\n17,868\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#32\n\nWhat do you like about them?\n\nNecessary Evil - I love that this is Supers, except you initially play on the opposite side. Not exactly Super Villains, but Super Rogues who get the chance to redeem themselves by becoming Super Heroes to save the world from an alien threat. It's also a self-contained campaign, with lots of opportunities for sandbox homebrews inbetween the metaplot. It's likely to be the most fun you'll ever have playing in the Supers genre\n\nThrilling Tales - Pure classic 1930s adventure, this is Indy Jones stuff and SW really hums at this level. Lots of good psuedo-historical content as well, it is the gold star for pulp adventure games.\n\n50 Fathoms - This was an early SW plot point campaign which was really cool, mixing 17th Century style seafarers with fantasy elements. It is a self-contained campain, with a huge ammount of sandbox opportunities, and it is presented with a simplisitc charm to it.\n\nSolomon Kane - This book is beautiful, the production, the artwork, and the fact that it is the only game that I know that uses Solomon Kane as a premises. I have never run it, but treasure this immensely.\n\nRippers - Again this is pulp adventure which SW does well. This time it's early Victorian era where you play members of a cabal of monster-hunters. This is pretty much straight out of the Hugh Jackson film 'Van Helsing' (or vice versa). Sort of if Hammer Horror did Steampunk - lot's of great opportunities here!\n\nDeadlands Reloaded - The Weird West concept is a cool one, and Deadlands is the iconic game for it. Given that it was also kind of a forerunner to SW, it was good to see it ported into SW. These days I prefer to run Down Darker Trails (which is Weird West Call of Cthulhu), but Deadlands is still a book I would never part with.\n\nPirates of the Spanish Main - This is pretty much 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Game', so what is not to love here? It's a beautiful big book, it shows you how to run 18th Century buccaneers, and it has lots of content. These days I would actually run this with either BRP or Fate, but this book would still be a huge resource in many ways.\n\nWonderland No More - I have never played this, but it is also one of those books I really want to try out. It is Lewis Carroll's 'Wonderland' setting, and things have taken a turn for the worse. It's a surreal trippy fairy-tale setting that would make for unique stories.\n\nIn truth, I moved on from SW as a generic system, and returned to BRP, as well as stumbling across Fate Core.\n\nI find I can do more with both BRP and Fate Core, and I prefer the mechanics - just personal preference.\n\nHowever I have never felt that Evil Hat presented it's Fate Core settings and campaigns anywhere near half as good as Pinnacle does with it's SW settings.\n\nI do not think I will part with any of the SW plot point campaigns, as they are quite an easy port to Fate Core, and they are so rich in content and useability.\n\nLast edited: Sep 5, 2020\n\nStan\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nJul 30, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n2,499\n\nReaction score\n\n6,246\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#33\n\nHowever I have never felt that Evil Hat presented it's Fate Core settings and campaigns anywhere near half as good as Pinnacle does with it's SW settings.\n\nI do not think I will part with any of the SW plot point campaigns, as they are quite an easy port to Fate Core, and they are so rich in content and useability.\n\nSimilar to that, I thought the presentation of ships in the 5e book about nautical stuff to be half assed. I consulted 50 fathoms for things like cargo and speed for a D&D naval campaign.\n\nI find plot point format is great for borrowing ideas. Since they are not part of a 200 page railroad, they pop right out to put in other games.\n\nMoonglum\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nNov 2, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n1,425\n\nReaction score\n\n3,517\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#34\n\nSolomon Kane probably deserves a nod as among the best uses of SW out there, but I have to say that when I tried to dip back into it a few months ago I re-read some of the original Howard stories and they were absolutely dripping with some of the most extreme racist tropes I've encountered in writing. I understand it was a different era and blah, blah, blah, but I found it so gross that I just tossed the book into the corner and dipped in a different direction instead. For me, Moorcock is twice the writer, has ideas that are just as good inspirations for gaming, and has the added appeal of not being an astonishing racist.\n\nChris Brady\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n3,257\n\nReaction score\n\n3,744\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#35\n\nNecessary Evil - I love that this is Supers, except you initially play on the opposite side.

It's likely to be the most fun you'll ever have playing in the Supers genre\n\nAnd the best part (for me) is that because it's 'Supers', there's more you can do after the Aliens are beaten. I mean, the PC's were villains, so not everyone is going to believe that the PCs are heroes now. The amount of adventures you can have in that alone can last literal years after the initial set up.\n\nThrilling Tales - Pure classic 1930s adventure, this is Indy Jones stuff and SW really hums at this level. Lots of good psuedo-historical content as well, it is the gold star for pulp adventure games.\n\nI also have a book, that I don't I remember the title of that details a 1920s where it's the after math of the War of The Worlds, which happened in the late 1890s.\n\nRippers - Again this is pulp adventure which SW does well. This time it's early Victorian era where you play members of a cabal of monster-hunters. This is pretty much straight out of the Hugh Jackson film 'Van Helsing' (or vice versa).

A slight correction, 1895 is late Victorian.\n\nPirates! - This is pretty much 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Game', so what is not to love here? It's a beautiful big book, it shows you how to run buccaneers, and it has lots of content.

I literally hadn't played a western game in two-decades, until I discovered Deadlands. And I *love* it. The move away from the metaplot in the current edition is a big step in the right direction.\n\nSavage Rifts - The system does so much honor to the original, and let's it breathe without tons and tons and tons of extra mechanics. You can engage in the heart of the gonzo without letting the game get in the way.\n\nHellfrost - Original. Fun. Tons of material. I'm really looking forward to a full SWADE edition I can hold in my hands.\n\nBeasts & Barbarians - One of the BEST Hyborian analogues ever. Superb S&S setting. LOVE IT.\n\nPirates of the Spanish Main - Like B&B above, this setting is pure swashbuckling goodness. The setting is... the Spanish Main. What's not to love?\n\nRippers - I look at Rippers almost as a bookend to my Deadlands. It's wonderful. League of Extraordinary Badasses Darkside-mode.\n\nI could probably name a couple of other honorable mentions... but these are probably my favorite.\n\nChris Brady\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n3,257\n\nReaction score\n\n3,744\n\nSep 3, 2020\n\n#39\n\nRavaged Earth!
