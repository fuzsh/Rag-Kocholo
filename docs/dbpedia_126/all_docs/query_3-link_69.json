        "text": "Morgan Delt is in court. In the preceding hour or so of screen time, he has ignored an injunction preventing him from contacting his ex-wife Leonie, broken into their once shared house, run a sequence of extremely loud animal noises to disturb Leonie and her new partner Charles Napier, exploded a thunderflash under his mother-in-law, and finally, kidnapped Leonie in an abortive attempt to live in the wilderness of deep Wales.\n\nThis rapidly escalating sequence of harassment has been undercut by Morgan's ineptitude, but there's no doubt he's in big trouble. So what does he do? He daydreams. A giraffe is being lassoed by a group of horsemen: then we see a number of these wild animals run free through the veldt. Jerked out of his reverie by the judge asking him whether he has anything to say, he smiles beatifically: \"I don't recognise this court at all.\"\n\nThis scene was not in the first version of this story, which was broadcast as a TV play by the BBC in October 1962, with Ian Hendry in the lead role. The story was written by David Mercer, who had himself experienced severe depression. By the time Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment – directed by Karel Reisz and starring David Warner as Morgan – was released in April 1966, some plot and dialogue remained the same, but the mood was much sharper and harder.\n\nIt's the cultural, social and political difference between 1962 and 1966. Whereas the earlier version remains within genre bounds, Morgan trashes them freely. The tone is all over the place: is it a marital farce, a swinging London romp, or a deeply subversive assault on the British class system and, indeed, all the values that society holds dear?\n\nFormally, Morgan marks the moment when British social realism moved into a surrealistic depiction of inner psychological states. Karel Reisz had already made his name as a founder member of the Free Cinema documentary movement: 1959's We Are the Lambeth Boys was a groundbreaking look at young working-class life, while 1960's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning showed naturalism could be big box office.\n\nHalf a decade and a youth revolution later, Morgan has been living the dream. The grittiness of inner urban life has been replaced by the luxuries of upper-middle-class London. Leonie's flat is full of consumer goodies, while Morgan himself is recast from the original as a painter rather than a writer: his nemesis Charles Napier has a fashionable West End gallery full of mobiles and action sculptures. So does capitalism reinvent itself.\n\nLike Mercer himself, Morgan has made it. But the gulf between his hardcore Stalinist upbringing and the new, apparently classless metropolitan consumer culture is beginning to tear him apart. And so a comedy of manners begins to tip into something darker. Morgan appears to be a bumbling fool, but he is also the fool in an older, deeper sense: the jester who strips away the veils of illusion to reveal an unpalatable truth.\n\nThe plot hinges on the dying marriage of Morgan and Leonie (Vanessa Redgrave). Their early bickering is standard sitcom fare, except Morgan is always ready to amp up the rhetoric: \"Tiresome? Is that what you call it? A human soul eviscerated? A life destroyed?\" He blunders around to the point where you sympathise with Leonie: \"Everyone takes you seriously until they get to know you.\"\n\nBut this is exactly where she is wrong. As the film progresses, you begin to realise that Morgan is not being melodramatic, but actually offering a factual, accurate record of a breakdown as it is happening. As he says to Napier, \"You can't count on me being civilised – I've lost the thread.\" To depict this disintegration – or is it a flight into clarity? – Reisz begins to intercut natural history footage into Morgan's reveries. In one famous scene, he is ascending an escalator in the tube: a young woman comes down on the other side. Morgan leans on the moving hand-rail and envisions a peacock fluffing its feathers as the young girl flutters her mascaraed eyelashes: an ornamental but useless creature. A fat ticket collector yawns and we see the gaping maw of a huge hippopotamus. Civilisation is a thin veneer in the urban jungle, and Morgan wishes himself a gorilla, a big beast.\n\nMorgan's particular problem is that, in the words of his mother – beautifully played by Irene Handl as a 1930s communist who \"refuses to deStalinise\" – he is \"a class traitor\". And the film's fantasy sequences really begin to bite when he returns to his adolescent bedroom, high above the railway tracks in the Holloway Road. He has returned to the parental home, to find that there is no home any more: his hold on reality is coming adrift.\n\nWhile the film was being shot, those within the new, chimerical, classless culture began to hit the wall. In the winter of 1965/66, Ray Davies satirised swinging London in songs such as Where Have All the Good Times Gone? and Dedicated Follower of Fashion. Overwhelmed by global superstardom, Davies had a collapse in February 1966: as he wrote soon afterwards in Too Much On My Mind: \"My poor demented mind is slowly going.\" It was also in February 1966 that the Rolling Stones released their depiction of disturbance, 19th Nervous Breakdown. In tandem with the effects of psychedelic drugs and the acceleration of media culture, during 1966 bizarre psychological states became a pop property with records both serious – Love's Seven and Seven Is, the Move's Disturbance – and ludicrous, such as Napoleon XIV's They're Coming to Take Me Away.\n\nMorgan is already there. His dreams are becoming nightmares. As he admits: \"Nothing in this world seems to live up to my best fantasies.\" After disrupting Charles and Leonie's wedding – dressed up in a gorilla suit, spurred on by intercut clips from the 1933 version of King Kong – Morgan speeds off on a purloined motorbike, his suit smouldering, along a Park Lane still in the throes of redevelopment, in a wonderful shot.\n\nThen his madness overwhelms him. The location is not the West End or Notting Hill, but the vast scrapyards around Battersea, south of the Thames: the hidden London. He imagines he is, like Trotsky or any other enemy of the people, about to be executed: powerless, he is hoisted up by a crane in the straitjacket he has long feared. Fantasy is intercut with reality in a disturbing climax.\n\nThe epilogue is satisfyingly ambiguous. Morgan is where he always thought he would be: in a mental hospital. He is pictured working methodically on a flower arrangement as Leonie visits. Almost without words, he learns she is pregnant with his child – his final revenge. And then he turns away, finally freed from her corrosive ambivalence. The camera pans up to reveal the flower bed design: a hammer and sickle.\n\nReleased in April 1966 – the month Time magazine's Swinging London issue was published – Morgan is both of its time and points forward to the darker popular culture that would ensue later that year and into 1968, the year of international youth revolution. Indeed, its popularity among the young may well have facilitated this radicalisation, certainly within Britain. The film's depiction of madness is deliberately ambivalent. The inner logic of Morgan's statements and his sure self-knowledge, as well as his rejection of the consumer society's superficial trappings, mark him as the only sane character. His madness, therefore, is like the state celebrated by RD Laing: insanity not as a state worthy of condign treatment but as a rebellion, the only possible act of sanity in a mad, mad world.\n\nThe symbol of the imprisoning restraint is echoed by Laing's famous statement, in his book, Sanity, Madness and the Family: \"Society places every child in a straitjacket\". Mercer was heavily influenced by Laing's theories, and employed the psychologist as a consultant on his 1967 drama Two Minds, which related a young woman's schizophrenia to her oppressive family background.\n\nMercer was not alone in espousing Laing's theories, which, as the countercultural writer Jeff Nuttall charted in his 1968 book Bomb Culture, fed directly into the radical aesthetics of the mid-60s underground. In some ways, they were the perfect antidote to the collapse of the old communist left. They would gain an even greater popularity after 1968.\n\nThere would be echoes of Morgan in popular culture as well, in the sharpening divide between youth and its rulers. Just over a year after the film's release, the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards would be failing to recognise the court of the land: \"We are not old men,\" he told the prosecuting counsel in a drug case that had effectively become a show trial for the counter-culture. \"We are not worried about petty morals.\"\n\nMorgan's anarchic disregard for society's conventions would also find another willing adherent. It was, according to his friend and biographer Fred Vermorel, one of Malcolm McLaren's favourite films. As Morgan threatens Charles Napier, you can hear him presage the hostility of the aggressive hippies and the punks they spawned. \"Violence has a kind of dignity in a loving man, and I'm full of love. I shall punish you with love.\" He brandishes a knuckleduster. \"Now, where would you like love?\""
