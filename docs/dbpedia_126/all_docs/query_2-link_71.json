        "text": "Will Friedle is revisiting his comments regarding his relationship with his former “Boy Meets World” co-star Ben Savage after he revealed last year that Savage suddenly “ghosted” the once close-knit cast.\n\nFriedle, 47, and “Cheetah Girls” star Sabrina Bryan, 39, host the new iHeart podcast “Magical Rewind,” where they watch and discuss fan-favorite Wonderful World of Disney and Disney Channel Original Movies, also known as DCOMs.\n\nWhen asked by The Post if there is any update on the “Boy Meets World” cast’s relationship with Savage, Friedle replied, “No, no.”\n\n“Ben is, you know, running for Congress, and I would hope he feels the same way that I feel about him, which is that I hope he’s just happy and healthy and enjoying his life,” he added.\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Savage for comment.\n\nFriedle told Variety in November he hasn’t spoken to Savage, who is campaigning to become the Representative of California’s 30th Congressional District, in three years after allegedly cutting his longtime friends and castmates off without any explanation.\n\nSavage’s dip into politics follows his unsuccessful bid for a seat on the West Hollywood City Council in 2022.\n\n“He disappeared — I wish I knew why, to this day,” the “Kim Possible” actor told the outlet in an interview with his fellow “Boy Meets World” cast members Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong.\n\n“We didn’t have a fight,” he added. “There’s no falling out. There was no animosity. He just woke up one day and decided, ‘I don’t want this person in my life anymore.’ He just kind of disappeared from our lives.”\n\n“He ghosted us,” Fishel added.\n\nFishel, Strong and Friedle reunited on-screen for three “Girl Meets World” seasons from 2014 to 2017. They also launched the “Pod Meets World” podcast in June 2022, which they allegedly asked Savage to join.\n\n“He was very adamant that it was not for him,” Fishel explained to Variety about the podcast, where the trio rewatched the show and discussed it.\n\n“He was also very clear, ‘I don’t want it to stop you. If you guys want to do it, go ahead.’ The time between those conversations and the time we actually started the podcast was a significant amount of time,” she claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, Friedle and Bryan’s “Magical Rewind” podcast takes fans back to the nostalgia of DCOMS, including Friedle’s films “Brink!” and “My Date with the President’s Daughter,” Bryan’s three “Cheetah Girls” installments, as well as the 2015 musical fantasy “Descendants.”\n\nNew episodes of “Magical Rewind” are available Tuesdays and Thursdays on the iHeartRadio app."
