        "text": "IN 1919, when Edward Hopper was earning his living as a commercial illustrator (a job he loathed), he received a congenial assignment: to depict an audience watching a movie. Hopper's drawing accompanied an article that claimed going to films was healthier than hanging around saloons, and his picture had this caption tacked on: \"Movies give cheap, democratic amusement.\" No argument from Hopper, who happened to be both frugal and movie-loving. Taking theaters as a subject -- most famously in \"New York Movie\" (1939), with its enigmatically bored or pensive usherette -- was simply the most obvious way in which films were essential to Hopper. During a long lifetime of moviegoing, what he saw on screen often inspired him indirectly, so that a film like \"Little Caesar\" (1930), with its dramatically lighted scene of thugs in a diner, reverberates years later in Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" (1942). And in turn, the desolate landscape we are now quick to call Hopperesque has had a profound influence on the movies. \"Days of Heaven\" and \"Psycho\" wouldn't be the same without him.\n\n\"Edward Hopper and the American Cinema,\" a provocative series that runs through Aug. 13 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is smart enough not to reach for one-on-one matchups between particular paintings and movie scenes. Instead of nagging at the question of who influenced whom, the series suggests the cyclical way that the movies, Hopper and American culture have shaped one another.\n\nThe series is rich in 1930's and 40's film noir; their expressionist lighting and tales of hunted individuals spoke to Hopper's own sense that a sharp cast of light could turn a city street into a haunted place. The program includes films that powerfully reveal Hopper's influence, but there are also serious omissions and connections so strained that they are silly. \"Edward Hopper and the American Cinema\" is not the dazzling series its subject calls for, but it offers an intriguing glimpse at the way Hopper's paintings and movies function as both pop-culture icons and works of art.\n\nOne of Hopper's earliest jobs was to watch silent movies, potboilers now long forgotten, and design posters for them. Throughout his life, he and his wife, Jo, would escape into what he called \"movie binges.\" Gail Levin's \"Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography\" (to be published in September by Alfred A. Knopf), offers a valuable, detailed chronicle of the Hoppers' moviegoing, featuring everything from \"The Battleship Potemkin\" to \"Marty\" and \"All About Eve.\" And Hopper appreciated the way film could capture a cultural moment. In 1962 he wrote in a letter, \"If you want to know what America is all about, go and see a movie called 'The Savage Eye.' \" By then Hopper had helped shape the image the film echoed, that of America as a land of isolated individuals, where even a man and a woman on the same bed usually look sad and disconnected.\n\n\"The Savage Eye,\" a 1960 fiction film directed by Ben Maddow, Sidney Meyers and Joseph Strick, looks like a Hopper canvas set in motion and filmed in black and white. A newly divorced woman (Barbara Baxley) arrives in Los Angeles, and the film depicts her next loveless year in stark detail, capturing her barren apartment with its Murphy bed, a bar at midday, a faith healer and a pet cemetery. Unfortunately, the entire film is a voice-over dialogue between the woman and the voice of her inner self (spoken by Gary Merrill), who uses ridiculous purple prose. Like the series itself, \"The Savage Eye\" is half dazzling, half misbegotten.\n\nThe use of voice-over and even the title \"The Savage Eye\" recall Jules Dassin's gritty, influential New York police drama, \"Naked City\" (1948). Sometimes the films here have more to do with one another than with Hopper. And sometimes the Hopperesque connection is as vague as something in the air.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
