        "text": "You’re ready to start creating your very own video games, but there is a question to answer first: what is the best programming language for games?\n\nWhile arguably most programming languages can be used to create games – making the question of what coding language is used for games tricky to answer – some choices do have more benefits than others. Additionally, choosing what programming languages to learn how to code may ultimately lock you into certain engines or frameworks as well, which further affects the development process of your game. To make a long story short, choosing the right game programming languages can be a stressful endeavor.\n\nHowever, in this guide, we intend to cover some of the popular game programming languages available to you to learn for game development and provide the necessary information that may help you decide. If you’re ready to learn how to code and jumpstart your game development career or hobby, let’s dive into the best programming language for games!\n\nTable of contents\n\nQuick Comparison Overview\n\nNeed a quick look into the best programming language for games? We have you covered – but be sure to read the rest of the article for more information!\n\nLanguageProsConsJavaScriptGreat for browser-based and mobile games, easy to integrate with JS frameworks, easy maintainability, and better for less resource-intensive development.Limited option for 3D graphics, not highly efficient, limited game scope, smaller community support, not commonly used for console games.C#Beginner-friendly, good for working on Windows, type-safe and relatively efficient, highly scalable, prime choice for Unity engine.Not widely used outside game engines, not as efficient as C++ or Java, less flexible due to .NET framework, less demanded in the gaming industry.C++Highly efficient, large community support, good memory management, scalable, platform-independent, popular with professional developers.Complex to learn, cannot easily develop games without a framework, no automatic garbage collection, lacks some modern features, less secure.JavaPreferred for Android mobile games, can utilize modern technologies for improved performance, suited for server development and multiplayer games, easy cross-platform portability.Limited community support for game development, potential latency issues, lacks game-specific libraries and engines, not supported on most modern consoles.\n\nWhat is a Programming Language?\n\nA programming language is a formal language composed of a set of instructions that produce various outputs. They enable humans to create scripts, applications, and programs that devices such as computers, tablets, and even game consoles can execute. From playing a song to running complex algorithms for scientific research, software of all types relies on programming languages.\n\nWhen it comes to the development of video games, programming languages are the backbone. They’re used to create the logic behind everything that happens in the game. Everything from the rules of the game, the behavior of the characters, to every action taken during the gameplay is dictated by the code written in a specific programming language.\n\nFREE COURSES AT ZENVA\n\nLEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT, PYTHON AND MORE\n\nACCESS FOR FREE\n\nAVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY\n\nProgramming Languages and Game Development\n\nThe domain of game development often feels like an entirely different world. It involves complex calculations, artificial intelligence, real-time rendering, and much more. However, these advanced features would be nothing without the foundation of a proper programming language. Here’s what programming languages bring to the table:\n\nControl Over The Game Logic: Every video game has a unique set of rules. Programming languages help bring these rules to life by forming the game logic.\n\nCharacter Behavior: How characters react, their movements, their artificial logic all rely on programming languages.\n\nUser Interaction: Whether it’s input through a console controller, keyboard, or a mouse, capturing and responding to user interaction is achieved through programming.\n\nIn the following sections, we will delve into our choices for the best programming language for games. We will look at their advantages, their application, and why they may or may not be the perfect fit for your next gaming project. Whether you’re looking to build a simple 2D game, a mobile game, or a high-end PC game, the programming language you choose can significantly influence your game development journey.\n\nIf you just want to jump in and start learning, though, Zenva’s Game Development Mini-Degrees provide a robust foundation. They offer a comprehensive set of courses, covering everything from Unity and Unreal Engine to game design and artwork, that can transform you from a novice into an industry-ready game developer. It is a vital resource, providing hands-on training and practical projects that are perfectly aligned with the growing demands and complexities of modern game development.\n\nJavaScript\n\nOur first best programming language for games is JavaScript – one experienced developers might not expect on the list.\n\nAbout\n\nJavaScript is commonly known as one of the core pillars of web development. It first appeared in 1995 and was designed to suit the new ECMAScript specifications that were attempting to standardize the web and web browsers. While HTML informs web layouts and CSS informs web aesthetics, JavaScript is the true computer programming language that breathes life into websites, adding most amounts of interactivity you see on a day to day basis.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of HTML5, JavaScript has also become the core pillar of HTML5 game development in terms of game programming languages. As it was originally designed with both object-oriented and event-driven systems for web user interaction, this made it the perfect choice to extend for games. Additionally, with Flash now being obsolete, it also made way for these sorts of HTML5 games to rise up and become the mainstay of browser-based game development.\n\nIf the web is your thing, JavaScript is the go-to here for best programming language for games.\n\nPros\n\nAs HTML5 games are based on the web, JavaScript makes it easy to make browser-based games and mobile games.\n\nGiven JavaScript is a core part of the web, it’s easy to integrate such games with JavaScript-based frameworks and libraries, like Node.js and Express, for multiplayer video game creation.\n\nHTML5 games are generally the easiest to share since they can be hosted directly on a website for anyone to visit.\n\nJavaScript is generally less resource-intensive for game development, meaning it’s great if you don’t have a powerful computer to develop games on.\n\nSince JavaScript is an extremely stable coding language due to its need for the web, HTML5 games are easier to maintain and don’t require the same sort of updating games made with engines do.\n\nCons\n\nOptions for 3D graphics are limited to specific frameworks, generally forcing most people to rely on 2D graphics for their video games.\n\nIt is a rather high-level programming language for programming for games, so it isn’t as efficient as other game programming languages on this list in terms of how fast it performs tasks.\n\nDue to not being as efficient, HTML5 games have more limits in terms of scope and size of the games you can make.\n\nWhile JavaScript itself receives lots of support for web development, HTML5 game communities are a bit smaller compared to other popular programming languages and engines for video game development.\n\nYou don’t really see JavaScript being used as much for console games.\n\nRelevant Engines & Frameworks\n\nPhaser\n\nBabylon.js\n\nPixiJS\n\nGDevelop\n\nImpactJS\n\nmelonJS\n\nPopular Games Made with JavaScript\n\nGods Will Be Watching\n\nHexGL\n\nCrossCode\n\nMiner Dash\n\nPolycraft\n\nWhere to Learn JavaScript\n\nHow to Create a Game with Phaser 3 by Pablo Farias Navarro\n\nThe Easiest Javascript Game Ever by KnifeCircus\n\nPhaser Mini-Degree by Zenva\n\nJavascript Foundations\n\nHow To Create A Game Using JavaScript by Dani Krossing\n\nCreating A Simple Multiplayer Game In Phaser 3 With An Authoritative Server by Scott Westover\n\nJavaScript Game Engines by Gamefromscratch\n\nC#\n\nOur next entry for best programming language for games is C# – let’s dive in. It’s also the one people may answer first if you ask what language are games coding in.\n\nAbout\n\nC# is a general-purpose programming language created in 2000 by Microsoft with the specific intent of working with their .NET framework. Given the popularity of C++ and Java, it was designed to take the best of both programming languages and combine it into a new, easy-to-read, object-oriented programming language that had great cross-platform capabilities. However, it also strove to keep businesses in mind so that it could be easily used for software development.\n\nAs for video games, C# also found a home in the industry due to its relative efficiency and scalability. In particular, it became the default programming language for the popular Unity engine, with all modern Unity libraries being built around the language. Given Unity is used for a large percentage of the video game industry, this has given it a tight hold in this regard. This said, it also had huge applications for up and coming player Godot as well.\n\nWith plenty of options, then, C# is truly a best programming language for games candidate.\n\nPros\n\nComparatively, C# is a very beginner-friendly language with fairly easy to read code.\n\nAutomatic memory management means you don’t have to do a deep dive into those aspects and can focus more on just developing your game.\n\nAs a language developed by Microsoft, it is a top choice for games on Windows PCs. However, it is capable of working on most modern systems.\n\nC# is a type-safe language, meaning your games will have more security and won’t exhibit tons of unexpected behaviors.\n\nIt is relatively efficient and scalable, meaning it’s well-suited when used to create game projects.\n\nCons\n\nWith some exceptions, outside of game engines, C# isn’t widely used for games. Thus, an engine is almost required in this case for community support.\n\nWhile more efficient than JavaScript, it isn’t as efficient as C++ or Java, meaning game performance can suffer if the video game is sufficiently complex.\n\nAs the language was designed to work specifically with Microsoft’s .NET framework, it isn’t as flexible as other game development languages on the list.\n\nIn the business world, while in high-demand for general business applications, it isn’t as demanded for game developers as C++ is.\n\nRelevant Engines & Frameworks\n\nUnity\n\nGodot\n\nCryEngine\n\nMonoGame\n\nMicrosoft XNA Game Studio\n\nStride\n\nPopular Games Made with C#\n\nStardew Valley\n\nCuphead\n\nHearthstone\n\nOsiris: New Dawn\n\nWhere to Learn C#\n\nC# Basic Series by Allan Carlos Claudino Villa\n\nUnity Game Development Mini-Degree by Zenva\n\nC# Beginner Programming Series – Your First Day – Unity by SpeedTutor\n\nRPG Academy by Zenva\n\nHow to Program in C# by Brackeys\n\nMultiplayer Game Development Mini-Degree by Zenva\n\nLearn C# Scripting for Unity in 15 Minutes (2020) by Charger Games\n\nAn Overview of Unity and C# by Zenva\n\nC++\n\nContinuing on, no best programming language for games list is complete without C++ – a grandaddy of languages.\n\nAbout\n\nThe C++ programming language was originally called “C with classes.” It was created to take modern principles, like object-oriented computer programming, and combine it with the low-level features seen by languages such as C. In so doing, it would allow users to more easily create their programs with readability, while not losing advanced features such as memory management.\n\nGiven its general-purpose nature, C++ has, all around, become one of the most widely used programming languages, having applications for software and – as is the topic of this article – games. In fact, many modern engines, such as Unreal Engine, are built on the language, so learning to code C++ is considered key by many professional developers. Of the programming languages, then, this can be considered one of the most commonly used in general.\n\nAll combined, the efficiency of this powerhouse makes it a key player in the best programming language for games race.\n\nPros\n\nBeing so close to C, C++ is amazingly efficient and is one of the fastest programming languages to choose if you have lots of complex tasks to run in your games.\n\nC++ has perhaps the largest community and tutorial support given its universal usage almost everywhere.\n\nIts ability to do things like memory management is very handy if you want tighter control on game performance.\n\nIt has a large amount of scalability and can be used for both small and large video game projects.\n\nIt is platform-independent, meaning you can port projects around very easily regardless of OS.\n\nCons\n\nWhile there are plenty of game engines to use, finding lighter-weight frameworks for C++ game development can be a challenge. You also can’t easily develop games with JUST C++.\n\nOf the languages on this list, C++ is probably the most difficult to learn and is the least beginner-friendly.\n\nThough C++ gives you more control over memory management and the like, this comes at the cost of lacking automatic garbage collection – which means more work on the developer’s end.\n\nAs an older language, some modern features seen in other languages are not present or standardized with C++.\n\nSince C++ allows developers to do more, this also allows less security – meaning you could get tons of unexpected behavior in your games without intention.\n\nRelevant Engines & Frameworks\n\nUnreal Engine\n\nGodot\n\nCryEngine\n\nCocos\n\nSimple and Fast Media Library (SFML)\n\nSimple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)\n\nPopular Games Made with C++\n\nSoulcalibur VI\n\nGears 5\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nArcheAge\n\nWhere to Learn C++\n\nHow to Get Started Programming in C++ by Nimish Narang\n\nC++ Tutorial 18 – Simple Snake Game by NVitanovic\n\nC++ Programming Academy by Zenva\n\nMaking A Game #1: Making The Game Loop by Let’s Make Games\n\nBeginner’s Guide to Game Development with Unreal Engine by Daniel Buckley\n\n2019 Ultimate Unreal C++ Guide\n\nUnreal Game Development Mini-Degree by Zenva\n\nJava\n\nAnother unexpected entry, let’s discuss Java and why it’s also a best programming language for games.\n\nAbout\n\nCreated in 1995, Java is an object-oriented programming language created for general computer programming. The design principle behind the language was to have it require as few dependencies as possible – especially compared to other programming languages at the time and even now. In so doing, this meant that programs created with Java could easily run on different systems as they weren’t as dependent on the underlying computer architecture.\n\nGiven this cross-platform nature, Java is used fairly extensively for application development. However, in the realm of games, it also finds a place. Though not as extensively used as other programming languages for game development on this list, quite a number of desktop games are still made with Java. In addition, as the top choice programming language for Android devices, Java is commonly used by a number of developers for mobile games and apps.\n\nOverall, its cross-platform nature makes Java game development a solid choice for the best programming language for games.\n\nPros\n\nAs Java is the foundation for Android devices, it is well-suited to making mobile games.\n\nDespite its age, Java is capable of utilizing modern technologies like multi-threading for better game performance.\n\nAs long as the platform supports JVM, Java games can be run almost anywhere. This includes systems like Linux.\n\nIt is well-suited to server development, so multiplayer games can be made fairly easily with Java without the need for extra libraries and so forth.\n\nCons\n\nEven though successful games have been made with Java, it is not the standard choice for game development in the eyes of most developers. Thus, community support for it in this field is limited.\n\nThough it does have automatic memory management, it is known to have some latency issues for games because of that.\n\nFew engines or libraries specific for game development exist for Java compared to other video game languages.\n\nMost modern consoles do not support JVM, so despite its ability, Java games are often platform-limited in this regard.\n\nRelevant Engines & Frameworks\n\njMonkeyEngine\n\nLightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)\n\nlibGDX\n\nLITIengine\n\nPopular Games Made with Java\n\nMinecraft\n\nRuneScape\n\nProject Zomboid\n\nFIFA 13\n\nWhere to Learn Java Game Programming\n\nZero-Day Java Guide by Mohit Deshpande\n\nJava Game Programming – Develop a Brick Breaker Game by Awais Mirza\n\nMobile App Development Mini-Degree by Zenva\n\nBeginner Java 2D Game Programming Tutorial Series by CodeNMore\n\nHow to Use Classes and Objects in Java by Nimish Narang\n\nJava Programming: Let’s Build a Zombie Game #1 by RealTutsGML\n\nBest Programming Language for Games Wrap-Up\n\nAs we hoped to establish here, there is no wrong or right programming language to learn to code when it comes to games. All of them have different features, different target platforms, and different sorts of developers who prefer them. However, the collection here is, no doubt, some of the best programming languages you can opt to learn when it comes to game development. That being said, don’t be afraid to explore elsewhere as well, as you may find other languages easy to learn and expand your skills.\n\nMany others of the best programming languages still find usage in games, and there are tons of frameworks and engines available that make use of the different programming languages available. So our best programming language for games list is by no means definitive.\n\nRegardless of your choice for which is the best programming language for games, each is set to help you develop your game project.
