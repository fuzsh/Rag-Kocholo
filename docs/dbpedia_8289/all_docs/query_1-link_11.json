        "text": "IoT and embedded tech are at the forefront of the ongoing industrial revolution, driving innovations in manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, and smart city development. Yet, C++ has remained the top choice for writing IoT firmware for years. Also, despite dating back to the 80s, C++ still holds third place among the most popular programming languages in 2023. So what are the reasons behind its popularity in embedded software development?\n\nIn this article, we will look at what makes embedded developers choose C++ and talk about some of the existing alternatives.\n\nC++ Origins and History\n\nC++ was created in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist. Originally the language was called \"C with Classes\" and was developed as an extension to the C programming language to add support for object-oriented programming.\n\nC++ gained popularity in the 1990s, partly because it was adopted by the emerging field of object-oriented programming, which was seen as a more efficient and modular way of developing software. The language was standardized in 1998 by the ISO/IEC, which established the official specification for the language.\n\nSince then, C++ has continued to evolve, with new features added in subsequent versions of the language. Today, C++ is widely used for various applications, including system software, video games, scientific computing, and, of course, embedded systems development.\n\n6 Reasons to Choose C++ for IoT Development\n\nC++ is a complex programming language that can be challenging to learn, particularly for beginners with no prior experience with programming or computer science. Still, several reasons make it worth mastering:\n\nEfficiency: C++ is a low-level programming language that offers excellent performance and efficiency. This is particularly important for IoT devices, which often have limited processing power, memory, and battery life.\n\nHardware access: C++ offers direct access to hardware resources, making it well-suited for low-level programming tasks such as controlling sensors, actuators, and other hardware components.\n\nPortability: C++ is a widely-used language with compilers available for most platforms, making it easy to develop IoT applications that can run on a wide range of devices.\n\nObject-oriented programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which makes it easier to manage complex systems and write reusable code.\n\nExisting libraries: Many existing libraries and frameworks are available for C++, making it easier to develop IoT applications quickly and efficiently.\n\nCommunity support: C++ has a large and active community of developers, which means many resources are available for learning and troubleshooting.\n\nAll in all, C++ is a versatile and powerful language well-suited for developing IoT applications that require efficient hardware access, portability, and object-oriented programming.\n\nExamples of IoT Solutions Written with C++.\n\nLet’s now look at some popular examples of IoT solutions written with C++.\n\nArduino: The Arduino platform, widely used for prototyping and hobbyist projects in IoT, is programmed using a dialect of C++.\n\nParticle: Particle is a cloud-based IoT platform that provides hardware and software solutions for developing connected devices. The Particle firmware, written in C++, provides a low-level API for controlling hardware and communicating with the Particle cloud.\n\nMicrosoft Azure IoT: Microsoft's IoT platform includes an SDK for C++, which enables developers to build IoT applications that run on various devices, including Windows 10 IoT Core devices and Azure Sphere.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many IoT solutions developed using C++. Overall, the language is a popular choice for IoT development because it offers efficient memory management, low-level hardware access, and a wide range of libraries and frameworks.\n\nStill, C++ is not the only programming language suitable for building embedded solutions. We’ll proceed to explore its alternatives in the next section.\n\nAlternatives to C++ for Embedded Development\n\nThere are several alternatives to C++ for embedded software development. Namely:\n\nC: this low-level programming language is often used for embedded software development since it offers efficient memory management and hardware access. It is also a simpler language than C++ and can be easier to learn.\n\nMany popular microcontroller platforms, such as the AVR and ARM Cortex-M, are programmed using C. C is also used extensively in automotive systems, including engine control units (ECUs), anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and airbag control modules. These systems require high performance and reliability, making C an ideal choice for development.\n\nRust: Rust is a systems programming language designed to be safe, concurrent, and fast. It offers memory safety guarantees and is well-suited for developing embedded systems that require high performance and reliability.\n\nRust is becoming increasingly popular in robotics development due to its safety and memory safety features. Rust provides a safe and efficient way to write firmware and control systems for robots. It is also used in developing industrial automation systems such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs).\n\nPython: Python is a high-level programming language often used for rapid prototyping and embedded systems testing. It offers a large number of libraries and has a short learning curve.\n\nPython is commonly used for data logging and analysis applications in embedded systems. For example, a data logger that records temperature and humidity readings from a sensor can be programmed using Python.\n\nPython is often used in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, which can be integrated with embedded systems. For instance, a computer vision system that runs on an embedded device can be programmed using Python.\n\nAda: Ada is a high-level programming language often used for safety-critical embedded systems. It offers strong typing and a high level of abstraction, making it easier to develop complex systems.\n\nAda is frequently used in avionics, railway, and defense systems, including military aircraft, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Ada is also used in developing medical devices and industrial automation.\n\nGo: this programming language is designed for concurrency and offers garbage collection, making it easier to write safe and efficient code for embedded systems.\n\nGobot, a framework for building robots, drones, and other hardware devices, was created using the Go. Gobot provides a simple and easy-to-use API for controlling various hardware devices like sensors, motors, and actuators.\n\nAs you can see, alternatives to C++ do exist, so you can always choose the one that suits you best and matches your project specifics. Ultimately, choosing a particular programming language depends on the requirements of the embedded system, as well as the preferences and expertise of the development team."
