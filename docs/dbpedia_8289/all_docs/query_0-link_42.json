        "text": "The modular architecture and structure of the programming environment supports your daily programming workflow and gives your developers more capacity for the core competencies of the machine. The integrated and standardized IEC 61131-3 languages and perfect ANSI C integration in the IEC world ensure that new users will feel right at home. Other integrated features such as Smart Edit and editor bookmarks make operation easier while boosting productivity at the same time.\n\nAll languages can access the same data types and use the same libraries and variables. In addition, Automation Studio supports simple and secure programming.\n\nThe graphical programming language Ladder Diagram LAD (according to the standard IEC DIN EN 61131-3) is based on the representation of circuit diagrams. Familiar symbols are used for programming, such as normally open and normally closed switches, coils and lamps.\n\nThese are then combined in networks to form logical structures.\n\nThe Ladder Diagram also enables you to integrate function blocks.\n\nAutomation Basic is a high-level language similar to Structured Text.\n\nThis language is well-suited for users who want to use a very easy-to-learn language, but don't want to miss out on the benefits of high-level languages such as structures, addresses, and pointers.\n\nCFC is a language similar to FBD. While FBD editors are network-oriented and arrange the blocks automatically, in CFC the blocks can be placed freely on the screen. Feedback loops can be created without temporary variables.\n\nThis language is especially suited for presenting an overview of an application.\n\nANSI C is a powerful language for programming applications and libraries.\n\nANSI C allows users to call function blocks and access variables from other IEC languages. By integrating the GNU compiler, one of the most widely used C compilers has been made available. This guarantees both portability as well as a nearly unlimited number of already available algorithms and programs."
