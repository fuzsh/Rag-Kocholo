        "text": "A programming language is a formal system for writing programs for computers and smartphones. It is defined by a set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic rules that dictate a program’s appearance and the actions that an executor or computer can perform.\n\nProgramming languages are technical, artificial languages. They consist of specific words, functions, and operators, each of which has a clear meaning that a computer can interpret. Operators are usually English words that indicate which operations should be activated when they are added to the code. Virtually all existing programming languages ​​have this in common. Differences between languages lie in the syntax, approach, or paradigm.\n\nTypes of Programming Languages\n\nLow-level programming languages ​​are languages ​​that are structurally similar to the real or virtual processor’s instructions (for example: Java, Microsoft .NET). Mnemonic notation is usually used to designate machine instructions. This allows commands to be memorized not as a series of zeros and ones, but as meaningful abbreviations of words from human language (usually English). For example: Assembler, Forth.\n\nHigh-level programming languages ​​are languages ​​designed to be quick and easy to use by the programmer. The defining feature of high-level languages ​​is abstraction, that is, the introduction of semantic constructs which briefly describe data structures and their operations. These descriptions are often very long and difficult to understand in machine code or a low-level language. Using a variety of translators and interpreters ensures that programs written in high-level languages ​​can communicate with different operating systems and hardware, while their source code remains unchanged. Examples: C++, C#, Python, Fortran, Visual Basic, Perl.\n\nSafe programming languages ​​are those ​​in which programs that have been accepted by the compiler as correctly formed never dynamically go beyond acceptable behavior. The program may contain errors, but it is not capable of violating the integrity of the data and crashing. Examples: Standard M, Cyclone, Rust.\n\nUnsafe programming languages ​​are the opposite of safe languages. Programs written in such languages may contain errors that can lead to problems with accessing the device's memory or cause the entire program to crash. Examples: C, C++, Java.\n\nCompiled programming languages ​​are those ​​whose source code is converted by a compiler into machine code and written to a file with a special header and/or extension for subsequent identification as executable by the operating system. The compiler translates the program’s source code into machine language immediately and entirely. Compiled programs run quickly and don’t require additional programs to operate, but the need to recompile when editing the code presents challenges in development. Examples: Assembler, C++, Pascal, Ada, Erlang.\n\nInterpreted programming languages ​​are languages ​​whose source code is executed by the interpretation method. If a program is written in an interpreted programming language, the interpreter executes the source code of the program without prior translation into binary code. The program remains in its original language and cannot be run without an interpreter. Interpreted programs run slower than compiled programs, but they can be run immediately after modification, which is convenient for developers. Examples: PHP, JavaScript, Python.\n\nThe Most Common Programming Languages\n\nJavaScript\n\nJavaScript is commonly used as an embeddable language for programmatic access to application objects. It is most widely used in browsers as a scripting language for making web pages interactive.\n\nAdvantages of JavaScript:\n\nFast for the end user: the script is executed on the user's computer, rendering nearly instantaneous results.\n\nSimplicity: The language is easy to learn and implement. It uses the DOM model, which provides a lot of preset functionality for various objects on pages.\n\nVersatility: JavaScript works great with other languages ​​and can be used in a wide variety of applications.\n\nDisadvantages of JavaScript:\n\nSecurity: JavaScript is added to web pages and client browsers and can use the user's system, so malicious code can be run on the client machine.\n\nBrowser Support: JavaScript is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers, resulting in inconsistencies in terms of functionality and interface.\n\nDisabling JavaScript: If you disable JavaScript in the browser, none of the JavaScript code will run.\n\nPython\n\nPython is used in web app and game development. It is convenient for automation, mathematical calculations, and machine learning. Companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Spotify, Quora, and Netflix all used Python at certain stages of development.\n\nPros of Python:\n\nLogical, concise, and understandable. Compared to many other languages, Python has an easy to read syntax.\n\nCross-platform. Works on a variety of platforms, including Linux and Windows.\n\nThere are interpreters for mobile devices and unpopular systems.\n\nIn high demand in the labor market.\n\nMany high-quality libraries (sets of functions and pre-made templates written in one programming language).\n\nCons of Python:\n\nLow program execution speed compared to other languages.\n\nHas strict code requirements (such as indentation).\n\nFeatures of Unicode output\n\nC#\n\nC# is useful for developing websites (ASP.NET), client and web applications, cross-platform mobile applications, and games in Unity 3D and CryEngine.\n\nPros of C#:\n\nMicrosoft support\n\nLots of syntactic sugar, which are elements that make code easier to write and understand (especially when the code is written by another programmer) and do not play a role during compilation.\n\nIntermediate entry threshold. The syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java, making it easy for other programmers to learn. For beginners, it is also one of the most promising languages ​​to learn.\n\nThe Xamarin tool, which allows you to write in C# for Android and iOS.\n\nHigh Demand: There are many vacancies for a C# programmer in all regions.\n\nCons of C#:\n\nOriented towards .NET (on the Windows platform).\n\nOnly provided free of charge for small companies, students, and solo programmers. For large teams, purchasing licenses can be expensive.\n\nJava\n\nJava is a language for distributed programming and comfortable remote collaboration. It is used for creating server applications that receive data from one server, process it, and pass it on.\n\nAdvantages of Java:\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nA high-level language with simple syntax and a smooth learning curve\n\nThe standard for enterprise computing systems\n\nSecurity\n\nIndependent of platforms\n\nMultithreading\n\nCons of Java:\n\nPaid commercial use\n\nLow performance\n\nLacks native design\n\nLengthy and complex code\n\nC++\n\nC++ is used in all areas of programming: from highly loaded systems to microcontrollers. C++ allows you to write web servers, games, computer programs, components, and so on.\n\nPros of C++:\n\nGood compatibility with C\n\nHigh performance\n\nCross-platform compatibility\n\nMultithreading\n\nAvailability of literature and documentation\n\nFunctional programming\n\nFree\n\nVersatility\n\nCons of C++:\n\nNot useful for the Web, although the Apache and Nginx web servers are written in C++\n\nA high entry threshold\n\nConfusing and cumbersome syntax. C++ has a large number of mandatory lines.\n\nDifficult to find errors. By contrast, there are a lot of tools for C# such as ReSharper that will find the errors for you, but for C++ you have to do it manually.\n\nNot suitable for enterprise applications\n\nRuby\n\nRuby is widely used in web development, system administration, and operating systems (Mac OS, Linux, BSD).\n\nPros of Ruby:\n\nRequires 40-50% less development time compared to other programming languages\n\nFlexibility. Applications can easily be changed, improved, or expanded upon release.\n\nSimplified interaction between developers thanks to heredity (there is a clear sequence in the structure and methodology when writing the code).\n\nCons of Ruby\n\nVery few specialists\n\nCostly servers\n\nPHP\n\nPHP is used for creating scripts to run on the server and execute the command line as well as windowed applications that run on the client side.\n\nPHP pros:\n\nMultifunctionality. By using a template engine, not only can you create scripts for web applications, but also full-fledged programs and mobile apps.\n\nCross-platform compatibility. PHP can be run on any operating system, including Unixoids.\n\nSupport for almost any web server\n\nFree distribution\n\nSufficient arbitrariness for web development\n\nPlenty of educational materials\n\nThe language continues to develop and evolve\n\nCons of PHP:"
