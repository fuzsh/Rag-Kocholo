        "text": "Computer systems are completely dependent on human beings to train them to take decisions. Everything a computer does, is somewhere, sometime, instructed by a human being. As computers do not understand the languages human beings speak, in order to instruct the computer systems about the tasks to perform, computer-friendly languages are used which are called programming languages.Â\n\nComputers only understand the language of 0 and 1, but programming in binary numbers is a tedious task and prone to frequent mistakes hence with time high-level languages have been developed which consist of English language words to help human beings program the computer systems easily and perform the required tasks. Different languages are used behind different technologies one sees today like Software, Websites, Applications, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, Machine Learning (ML) processes, Natural Language Processing (NLP) conversational systems, and more.Â\n\nHere is an elaborative discussion of the hardest and easiest programming languages.Â\n\nThings to know before starting to learn any programming language\n\nAny programming language, no matter how easy or hard, requires time and effort to learn. Therefore, it is important to research thoroughly and choose a programming language that is aligned with the career path one is determined to establish. As such, it is important to take note of the factors below that make a programming language easier or harder to learn.\n\nFactors making a programming language easier to learn.\n\nAvailability of free resources: Various courses and tutorials make it easier for learners to grasp the language quickly.\n\nConsistent rules and simplicity: Programming languages that adhere to uniform rules will simplify learning new commands and functions, enabling beginners to grasp the concepts more quickly.\n\nIntegration with other languages: Making it more versatile and user-friendly for beginners.\n\nSyntax resembling simple English: Programming languages with straightforward syntax that incorporates English words and closely resembles the English language structure are more relatable and accessible for beginners to comprehend and learn.\n\nLarge developer community: A supportive community helps learners to grow and troubleshoot any issues they may face.\n\nFactors making a programming language harder to learn.\n\nComplex and unusual syntax: Some languages have complicated rules for structuring code or unconventional ways of organizing it, making it difficult for beginners to understand and write.\n\nMultiple programming paradigms: A language that supports various programming styles can take more work, as it requires understanding different approaches to solving problems, such as functional programming, which emphasizes immutability and mathematical functions.\n\nError handling and predicting output: In some languages, it is challenging to identify and fix errors or bugs, and developers may need to anticipate the results of their code before running it, making it more difficult for newcomers.\n\nTechnical jargon and abstract concepts: Some languages use specialized terms and concepts or involve abstract ideas, making them harder to grasp for people without a background in computer science.\n\nDomain-specific focus and limited code reuse: Some languages are designed for specific purposes, such as artificial intelligence, making them less accessible to general users. Additionally, it can be challenging to reuse code snippets in specific languages, making it harder to learn from examples and build upon existing code.\n\nExpert guidance needed: Some languages require the guidance of an experienced tutor or mentor to understand and learn effectively. Mostly students need coding homework assistance when they get stuck with their advance programming courses.\n\nEasiest Programming Languages to Learn\n\nHTML\n\nHTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. There has been a lot of discussion on HTML language being a complete programming language mainly because of the fact that technically it is not a functionality-based language but a Markup Language. This means that HTML cannot create functions and perform typical programming tasks as it does not support the usage of iterative, conditional statements, or even simple mathematical operations like all the other programming languages.\n\nHowever, HTML has no programming logic and cannot evaluate expressions, perform math, handle events or tasks, modify or manipulate data, declare variables, or write functions. That being said, HTML will be discussed as it is a fundamental language used to structure web pages and content.Â\n\nHTML features the following:\n\nTags that define the type and structure of an element and usually come in pairs.\n\nAttributes provide extra details or functionality to an HTML tag.Â\n\nElements that can be nested within other elements to create complex structures.Â\n\nComments for adding notes within the code.Â\n\nThe syntax of HTML includes angle brackets for tags, attribute name-value pairs within opening tags, and hierarchical relationships through nesting.Â\n\nDespite being necessary for the web development industry, HTML is an extremely easy programming language to learn. It is recommended for fresh learners to get their hands on HTML first while stepping into the programming world and growing their skills onwards.Â Â\n\nWho uses HTML?\n\nHTML is essential for everyone who works on website development and design as it creates all the web pages found on the internet. Front-end website development and Full-stack development are the major departments to use HTML as a base language. To maintain and fine-tune the web pages, HTML gives the most control over customization.\n\nWhat makes HTML an easy-to-learn language?\n\nHTML is one of the easiest programming languages. Its simple and symmetric code syntax makes it easy to learn. There are numerous free courses easily available on the internet that teach HTML in just a few hours. HTML tags adhere to consistent rules, making it simple to learn new commands and functions. HTML is a structuring language, it does not add any functionality but enables the developers to create a comprehensive blueprint of the website.\n\nWhere to learn HTML online?\n\nCourse Title:Â HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers\n\nCourse Author: Yaakov Chaikin\n\nPlatform: Coursera\n\nBrief Description: This hands-on course, offered by Johns Hopkins University, teaches essential web development skills, focusing on creating responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Master the art of crafting mobile-friendly websites without compromising the desktop experience.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nCourse Title: Step-by-step HTML and CSS for Absolute Beginners\n\nCourse Author: Kathleen Farley\n\nPlatform: Udemy\n\nBrief Description: In this beginner-friendly course, participants will master HTML5 and CSS3 to craft their own website, even without prior coding experience. Throughout the course, learners will develop a \"Coming Soon\" webpage using valid HTML5 and CSS3 code, gaining an intuitive understanding of the language's structure and function. By the end, students will confidently employ HTML and CSS while adhering to industry best practices.\n\nPrice: $119.99\n\nIf one prefers to read from books, there are many options on Amazon such as \"HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites\"Â or \"Web Design with HTML5 and CSS: Learn how to design, create and build responsive websites using the best HTML5 and CSS practices\".\n\nFinally,Â W3Schools offers free tutorials on HTMLÂ online.\n\nJavaScript\n\nJavaScript, as the name suggests, is used for scripting. It used not used alone but with the combination of HTML and CSS to add functionality to the webpages and make UI and UX more appealing. This is done by making the pages interactive. Clients can see a certain change on each element while he hovers, clicks, scrolls, or types something. The interactive features may be a change in colors, font, shadow effect, or carrying out some logical functionality with pre-defined inputs. The fact that JavaScript is commonly used to transform HTML elements or provide UI functionality does not imply that these are its only capabilities.\n\nJavaScript can perform more powerful operations including data analysis, search algorithm implementation, or solving complex mathematical equations. JavaScript is not only a client-side scripting language. The project environments like Node.js unlock server-side development capabilities for developers with JavaScript. JavaScript can be used outside of a web browser and on the back end. This enables web applications to run from the screen to the server using a single programming language.\n\nJavaScript's features include:Â\n\nCode execution is triggered by events like user interactions, making it ideal for creating responsive applications.Â\n\nNative support for JSON, a lightweight data interchange format that is easily parsed and stringified.\n\nJavascript syntax involves the following:\n\nDeclaring variables using var, let, or const keywords.\n\nDeclaring functions with the function keyword, arrow functions, or object methods.\n\nCommon control structures for conditional execution and loopingÂ\n\nUsing arrays and objects for managing the collections of values.Â\n\nâ\n\nWho uses JavaScript?\n\nJavascript allows for dynamic content creation, event handling, and asynchronous programming. JavaScript can also manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify HTML elements and attributes and can respond to user interactions through event listeners and callback functions. In addition, JavaScript can interact with web APIs provided by the browser and can be used for server-side development using Node.js.\n\nTo enable interactive features on web pages,Â web developersÂ andÂ full-stack developersÂ should learn JavaScript to implement input-based logical operations.\n\nWhat makes JavaScript an easy-to-learn language?\n\nJavaScript is yet another language that is extremely simple for fresh programming learners yet very useful. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can be readily integrated with other programming languages such as HTML. It is easy to write complex codes in JavaScript and simultaneously run those codes while proceeding as part of the process. It is designed for non-programmers and is user-friendly for people who want to learn. It's an excellent beginner's programming language.\n\nWhere to learn Javascript online?\n\nCourse Title: \"JavaScript for Beginners\"\n\nCourse Author: William Mead\n\nPlatform: Coursera\n\nBrief Description: The University of California's \"JavaScript for Beginners\" course, offered on Coursera, is tailored for those new to programming or seeking a career change.

Some popular online tutorials include W3Schoolsâ âC++ Tutorialâ and Codecademyâs âLearn C++â\n\nHaskell\n\nThe language is named after a mathematician and is usually described to be one of the hardest programming languages to learn. It is a completely functional language built on lambda calculus.Â\n\nHaskel is known for the following features:\n\nPurely functional programming that makes the code more predictable, easier to reason about, and facilitates parallelism and concurrency.\n\nStatically typed, which means that type checking is done at compile time. This helps catch many common programming errors early and leads to more robust code.\n\nType inference reduces the need to annotate types explicitly. This makes the code concise and more readable.\n\nLazy evaluation: Haskell uses lazy evaluation by default, which means that expressions are evaluated only when needed. This allows for more efficient code and infinite data structures.\n\nPattern matching: Haskell supports pattern matching, allowing you to destructure data and match specific values or structures. This makes the code more expressive and easier to read.\n\nAlgebraic data types: Haskell provides algebraic data types, which are a way to define composite data types using sum and product types. This enables you to model complex data structures in a concise and type-safe manner.\n\nType-classes: Haskell has a feature called type-classes, which are similar to interfaces in other languages. Typeclasses allow you to define a set of functions that operate on different types, promoting code reusability and abstraction.\n\nImmutability: By default, data in Haskell is immutable. This means that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This leads to less error-prone code and simplifies reasoning about the program.\n\nHigh-level abstractions: Haskell allows for the creation of high-level abstractions using functions and types, making it possible to express complex ideas concisely and elegantly.\n\nWho uses Haskell?\n\nHaskell is the primary technology that allows the development of high-quality software. The most significant factors for judging software quality are correctness, performance, and maintainability, and Haskell makes it so much easier to write code that excels in all of these areas.\n\nDevelopers use Haskell for the following:Â Â\n\nWeb development with frameworks like Yesod and Servant.\n\nConcurrent and parallel programming.\n\nData processing and transformation.Â\n\nFormal verification and theorem proving with tools like Agda and Coq.\n\nCompiler and interpreter development.\n\nWhat makes Haskell a hard-to-learn language?\n\nHaskell is a statically-typed functional programming language with a strong emphasis on purity and laziness. This means that functions in Haskell are pure by default and only evaluate their arguments when needed.Â\n\nThese features can make Haskell code very concise and expressive, but it can also make learning it more challenging for those used to imperative programming languages. Additionally, Haskell has a rich type system that allows for powerful abstractions but can also require more effort to understand.\n\nWhere to learn Haskel online?\n\nUnfortunately, no online courses on Coursera or Udemy teach Haskell. However, there are some great books available on Amazon that can teach Haskell. One such book is âLearn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginnerâs Guideâ by Miran Lipovaca. Another book is âHaskell: The Craft of Functional Programmingâ by Simon Thompson.\n\nIn addition to books, there are also many online tutorials available. One such tutorial is available onÂ tutorialspoint.com, whileÂ HaskellWikiÂ has a page dedicated to tutorials.\n\nLISP\n\nLISP, short for LISt Programming, was developed in the year 1959. Despite being one of the oldest programming languages, LISP has not lost its charm and is surprisingly still used by a fair number of programmers working on high-level AI applications. Studies reveal that when a similar code is written in C, C++, Java, and LISP, the LISP programs are relatively smaller and run within the least amount of time. LISP was initially designed with the purpose of seamlessly manipulating data strings and is used for the most logical AI applications in the present.Â\n\nLISP features include S-expressions, symbolic computation, dynamic typing, homoiconicity, garbage collection, and support for functional programming. Furthermore, LISP's syntax is characterized by its simplicity and consistency, with programs consisting of expressions that can be atoms or lists.Â\n\nFunctions are applied by enclosing the function name and arguments within a list, making it easy to parse and manipulate programmatically. LISP's ability to handle symbolic expressions and metaprogramming makes it particularly well-suited for AI, mathematics, and computer algebra systems.\n\nStudies showed that when similar code is written in C, C++, Java, and LISP, the LISP programs are relatively smaller and run within the least amount of time.Â\n\nWho uses LISP?\n\nLISP is commonly associated with AI research professionals as it has been widely used in expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning. Furthermore, LISP's homoiconicity and macro system make it an excellent choice for creating domain-specific languages specialized for particular tasks or industries, while LISP dialects, such as Emacs Lisp and Guile, are employed as embedded scripting languages to extend and customize applications.\n\nAdditionally, LISP's dynamic typing, REPL, and interactive development environment allow rapid prototyping to test new ideas.Â\n\nWhat makes LISP a hard-to-learn language?\n\nLearning LISP can be challenging due to its unique syntax, functional programming paradigm, and reliance on recursion and higher-order functions. Its distinct S-expression syntax and abundant parentheses can be overwhelming and error-prone for beginners.Â\n\nAdapting to the functional programming mindset, which emphasizes immutability and the avoidance of side effects, may also be difficult for those accustomed to other programming paradigms. Lastly, mastering LISP requires a strong grasp of recursion and higher-order functions, both of which can be challenging concepts to learn.\n\nWhere to learn Lisp online?\n\nCourse Title:Â The Lisp Programming Language: Learn Lisp basics in one day!Â\n\nCourse Author: Nikoloz SanakoeviÂ\n\nPlatform: UdemyÂ\n\nBrief Description: This introductory course on the Lisp Programming Language is designed to teach the fundamentals of Lisp through practical examples.

Malbolge is by far the hardest programming language to learn, which can be seen from the fact that it took no less than two years to finish writing the first Malbolge code. The code readability is ridiculously low because it is designed to be as challenging as possible, providing programmers with a challenge.\n\nWho uses Malbolge?\n\nMalbolge is not preferred in the software industry as it has no use cases. It is self learned as a test of a programmer's skills.\n\nWhat makes Malbolge a hard-to-learn language?\n\nMalbolge, by nature, is counterintuitive because it has a counter-intuitive âcrazy operationâ, base-three arithmetic, and self-altering code, which makes it very difficult to understand.Â\n\nTo make things worse, Malbolge's syntax comprises of only eight instructions, represented by the characters i, j, p, m, d, r, c, and <. Â The âcrazy operationâ scrambles register and memory values for the instructions providing a huge challenge for aspiring Malbolge programmers.\n\nProgrammers who seek to learn this esoteric language would have to be motivated purely for the challenge of learning this language\n\nWhere to learn Malbolge online?\n\nNo specific Malbolge courses on Coursera, Udemy or books on the subject exist. However, online tutorials are available for the truly dedicated, such as theÂ Malbolge TutorialÂ at matthias-ernst.eu.\n\nConclusion\n\nProgramming language learning can be an intimidating process, therefore, it is recommended to start with the easiest and then grow into the domain that supports oneâs career path. It is always better, to begin with, those programming languages which have a vast community of developers and strong support programs to enable a seamless learning experience.Â\n\nMost software developers prefer learning a set of programming languages rather than a single one. This enables the developers to handle projects single-handedly and adds to their market value at the same time.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ"
