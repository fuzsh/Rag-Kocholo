        "text": "If you're a math guy, then C++ is better than Java or Python, however MATLAB may be fun for you. It sort of has it's own language and there is tons of support and tutorials for matab. In fact, half of the time when I look up butterworth or chebychev filters on wikipedia, they give matlab implementations because the language is designed for pure math. If you are looking for even higher level, then MATLAB's simulink gives graphical representations of functions, filters, or controls that you can play with.\n\nSciPy (pronounced \"Sigh Pie\") is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give SciPy a try!"
