        "text": "I could not possibly disagree with every single sentence in @Owen-Reynolds 's post any harder than I do. Many of them are opinions on the languages that are… let’s say, warped, from my perspective, and those I’ll just ignore, except to say that nearly every single step of developing in C++ requires 12 source files in just the right folders plus a paragraph of boilerplate code pasted in, and in a practical sense the headaches and bugs that ensue from that process negate any pluses the language might have.\n\nMost of the rest of the post is just factually wrong.\n\nUnity has gotten more expert-friendly as time has gone by, but until around Unity ~3 it was absolutely a beginners’ game engine - albeit one that had some power in it if you knew where to look. If it were an expert-first game engine, for example, GameObject.Find wouldn’t even exist, and neither would UnityScript as a language - a language explicitly designed to grab web developers without game dev experience. And even using C#, Unity is far and away the easiest C# development environment I’ve ever used: You create a script and it gives you a small templated script files, and then you fill in some code and alt-tab back to the editor and it compiles it. It’s not only an efficient workflow, it’s absolutely trivial for beginners to pick up development.\n\nUnity is NOT a game engine designed for experts; it’s been adapted by experts because it’s fast and easy (with some power accessible under the hood), and even experts enjoy not having to wrestle with their programs.\n\nMany developers who prefer C++ over C# are also the sort to roll their own game engines, and it’s tough to sell a game engine to that person. There’s a much bigger market if you target people that hate the hurdles that C++ forces you to jump through, and it helps to grow the game developer community as a whole, as well.\n\nI have never seen a question about transparent JPEGs here, but even if I saw one, masking out a color in a shader is absolutely trivial.\n\nOTEE always knew they were going to release a game engine publicly. It seems that early on they intended to also release games built on that engine (not unlike what Epic/Unreal does) and that has fallen by the wayside, but Unity was always a game engine."
