        "text": "C++ is among the top 10 most widely used programming languages in the world [1]. It's a general-purpose programming language (GPL), which means you can use it to build any type of program. The article below further explores the use cases, benefits, and potential drawbacks of C plus-plus. You can use it to determine whether it's the right programming language for you to learn.\n\nWhat is C plus-plus?\n\nC++ (or âC-plus-plusâ) is a generic programming language for building software. Itâs an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website. Typically, a user account contains closely related data like first name, last name, and email address. Bundling this information together into an object makes it easy to replicate the process of creating a new account.\n\nWhat is C plus-plus used for?\n\nOver time, C++ has become a choice language for building fast and reliable software. Its versatility makes it an excellent match for complex applications, embedded systems, and internet of things (IoT) devices. A few of its most common use cases are as follows:\n\nSoftware engineering. A couple of applications you might use daily that were created with C plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon.\n\nOperating system (OS) development. Examples of OS that were created with C++ include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.\n\nGraphical user interfaces. C++ is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI. Â\n\nVirtual reality (VR). C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you want to develop VR applications.\n\nBlockchainÂ technology. The well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be used to create smart contracts.\n\nGame development. You can develop games and gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of Warcraft and the Xbox console.\n\nShould you learn C++?\n\nC plus-plus is a great language to learn if you want to gain a deep understanding of how computers work. It's generally considered to be a good starting point for novice or beginner coders. With knowledge of C++, you may also be able to pick up other languages like Python or JavaScript more easily.\n\nRead more: Python vs. C++: Which to Learn First and Where to Start\n\nAdvantages of learning C++\n\nProgramming in C++ offers several advantages. Because it is object oriented, you can easily organize and classify the code. Instead of rewriting code from scratch, you can reuse it. You can also use C plus-plus to interact directly with a computerâs hardware. As a result, you'll be able to control how a system uses its computational resources, like software, hardware, and memory.Â\n\nRead more: Should You Learn Object-Oriented Programming Languages?\n\nCareer advancement opportunities\n\nHaving experience with C++ can introduce you to job opportunities with high-paying salaries. As of January 2023, Indeed had over 13,000 job listings in the US for C++ developers, programmers, and engineers. Over 8,000 of those jobs are estimated to have salaries above $110,000 [2]. Glassdoor reports that the average yearly pay for C++ developers in the US is $108,260 [3].\n\nRead more: How to Become a Software Developer | 9 Tips\n\nHow to learn C++\n\nC++ basics include storing information, repeating actions through loops, and collecting user input.Â The list below outlines a few key concepts for C++ beginners to explore. Then, check out the next section for recommendations on where to start.\n\nConditionals like âif statements,â âif else statements,â and âswitch case statements,â which tell a computer what to do under certain conditionsÂ\n\nHow to assign classes to objects (data fields with unique attributes)Â\n\nHow to write code using C++ syntax, the predefined symbols, and characters that determine how a computer reads the codeÂ Â\n\nHow to compile and link a C++ file, so that the code can run on a machineÂ\n\nOnline courses and guided projects in C++\n\nHere are a few beginner-friendly online courses and guided projects to get you started:\n\nProgramming in C++: A Hands-on Introduction Specialization by Codio (certificate upon completion)\n\nAccelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (certificate upon completion)\n\nIntroduction to C++ Programming: Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game by Coursera (approximately 2 hours to complete)\n\nYou can practice also basic C++ with exercises like printing âHello, World,â converting Celcius to Fahrenheit, and performing arithmetic operations.\n\nJoining the C++ developer community\n\nIt can be helpful to connect with and learn from other, more experienced programmers. For example, you may consider joining the C++ Slack community. Or, follow questions with the C++ tag on StackExchange. You can also follow relevant YouTube channels like Programming with Mosh. Once you've gained some technical expertise and practiced coding in C plus-plus on your own, you might be ready to apply your skills to a real-life project on a collaborative site like GitHub.\n\nLearn C++ with Coursera\n\nStart building a strong foundation for your programming career today by enrolling in an introductory online course like Coding for Everyone: C and C++ Specialization by the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"
