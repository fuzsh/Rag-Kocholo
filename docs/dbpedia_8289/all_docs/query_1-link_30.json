        "text": "Both Python and C++ are popular, beginner-friendly programming languages. For some, choosing which of these general-purpose languages to learn first is a matter of personal preference. For others, one may be more beneficial to learn for a specific project. The choice depends on your goals, but it can be helpful to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each language.\n\nRead more: What Programming Language Should I Learn?\n\nPython overview\n\nPython is an object-oriented programming language that was released by Guido van Rossum in 1991 [1]. It's commonly used to develop websites and software. Python is also extremely useful for data analysis and visualization. Another common use for Python is task automation, or developing programs to execute repetitive tasks independently.Â\n\nRead more: What is Python Used For? A Beginner's Guide\n\nAdvantages of Python\n\nPython is a popular programming language because it's simple enough for novice coders to learn quickly. It's a high-level language, meaning its simple syntax is designed to be easily understood by humans. It's also an interpreted programming language, meaning users can run individual lines of code immediately after they've been written. This feature can help save time and minimize errors. Here are a few more Python advantages:\n\nCode readability: Python reads like the English language, making it easy for new users to start writing code.\n\nÂ\n\nSimplified error debugging: Python stops executing as soon as an error appears. You will spend less time tracking down and correcting errors in the code.\n\nÂ\n\nFree and open-source: You can use and distribute your own version of Python.\n\nÂ\n\nStandard library support: The extensive Python library reduces your dependence on external libraries. If you need to import a package from another library, you have more than 200,000 third-party Python libraries to choose from as you write code.\n\nDisadvantages of Python\n\nAll programming languages are flawed. A few of Python's disadvantages are listed below:\n\nProgram execution speed: Python performs code execution line by line, which can slow the process. When speed matters, Python may not be the best programming language to use.\n\nÂ\n\nMemory usage: Python requires a considerable amount of memory, which can limit its use for particular projects.\n\nÂ\n\nUsability in mobile computing: Python can take up too much memory to make it usable for mobile devices.\n\nDatabase access: The Python database is underdeveloped compared to similar technologies, and can feel cumbersome to use.\n\nRead more: How Long Does it Take to Learn Python? (+ Tips for Learning)\n\nC++ overview\n\nCreated in 1985, C++ has been around longer than Python [2]. Despite its age, it remains one of the most efficient object-oriented programming languages available. Commonly, C++ is used to develop operating systems, applications, and browsers. It's also used for game development.Â\n\nAdvantages of C++\n\nC++ is a mid-level language, which allows the developer to use it as both a low-level and high-level language. A few more advantages of this language include the following:\n\nPortability: C++ codes you write on one platform can easily transfer to other platforms without producing an error.\n\nÂ\n\nSpeed: As a compiler-based language, C++ is faster than Python. The same code running in both programs simultaneously will generate in C++ first.\n\nÂ\n\nMemory management: C++ does not support garbage collection, so the developer has complete control over the memory.\n\nÂ\n\nSimilarity to other programming languages: If you also know C, C#, or Java, you may find it easier to learn C++.\n\nÂ\n\nExtensive community of users: C++ is such a popular program, you'll find a vast network of support to help you solve problems with your code.\n\nDisadvantages of C++\n\nThe more you understand C++'s limitations, the better you will be prepared to make accommodations as needed. Here are some of the programming language's drawbacks:\n\nÂ\n\nMemory management: Since the user has complete control over the memory, there's a risk of storing redundant data that increases the memory used.\n\nÂ\n\nFlexibility: C++ can feel less flexible because of its strict syntax. Small errors lead to a series of errors that can take time to correct.\n\nÂ\n\nFunctions: C++ lacks first-class type functions like passing and returning values without restrictions and creating functions without restrictions.\n\nÂ\n\nComplexity: As a multi-paradigm language, C++ is not useful for platform-dependent apps.\n\nRead more: What Is C++ (And How to Learn It)\n\nHow to start learning\n\nYou have several options for learning Python, C++, or both. If you prefer to study independently, you might benefit from online tutorials and study guides. For example, you can access free Python programming tutorials and cheat sheets on Coursera.\n\nThose looking for more hands-on guidance may find that instructor-led online courses are a better fit.
