And, of course, we decided to share this information with you.\n\nWe believe that such a list of must-have blockchain development languages will help you kick into gear fast and create an incredible project.\n\nTOP 9 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES FOR BLOCKCHAIN & SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT\n\nSo finally, we’ve come to the best part – we’ll share top blockchain programming languages for modern smart contracts and dApps development. Many programming languages can be used in the blockchain, but in our opinion, the best are Solidity, Go, Rust, С++, Move and Motoko. Choose wisely, and don’t forget to hire experienced developers for your team to get the most out of the language of your choice!\n\nRead: Benefits of Smart Contracts\n\nRust – The best programming language for blockchain development\n\nRust is a relatively young blockchain programming language that has already proven its efficiency. It entered the spotlight not that long ago, brought to the wider audience by Parity, which has developed a relevant Ethereum client.\n\nOne of the Parity founders, Gavin Wood, soon greatly contributed to the mass Rust adoption at his presentation about the interoperable blockchain Polkadot and its framework Substrate. After this, other large players of the blockchain market have started appreciating the Rust language and its advantages. And thanks to that, we can now use high-speed networks like Solana, NEAR, Secret Network, and other young blockchains that work on the technology edge.\n\nWhat is Rust?\n\nRust is a multi-paradigm programming language that was specifically created for enhanced performance and safety. It offers great documentation, a vast set of developer tools, and a friendly compiler with helpful error messages.\n\nRust is probably the most efficient crypto programming language for smart contract development since it enables productive collaborative work for project teams, as well as open source developers who want to contribute to the protocol. The Rust language allows programmers to control low-level details without any hassle or micro-management, providing a great balance of technical capacity and coding experience.\n\nOn top of that, Rust enables top-notch speed and stability by means of the real-time compiler that checks the code through feature additions and refactoring. Thus, this language corresponds to all the primary requirements for blockchain development and much more.\n\nRust advantages\n\nClear development guidelines;\n\nZero-cost abstractions;\n\nSpeed;\n\nMemory efficiency;\n\nReliability;\n\nSelf-upgradability function due to the use of WASM;\n\nConcurrency-based opportunities;\n\nManagement of mutable states.\n\nRust Blockchains Examples\n\nSolana – a high-performance blockchain that provides the fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto. It offers low-cost transactions (less than $0,01 for developers and users) and great speed (400 millisecond block time).\n\nSubstrate – a blockchain framework that allows developers to build customized blockchains for any use case quickly and easily.\n\nNEAR – a full ecosystem that includes a sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain, a Foundation, and a huge network of community members, including developers, businesses, and creatives.\n\nParity.io – a blockchain infrastructure for the decentralized web that allows protocols to operate seamlessly at scale and enter the world of Web 3.0.\n\nPolkadot – a decentralized Web 3.0 blockchain network that enables cross-chain interoperability and scalability.\n\nRust is widely considered the best language for blockchain development due to its strong focus on safety, speed, and memory efficiency.

Discover the intricacies of NEAR smart contracts and unlock advanced development potential.\n\nGo\n\nGo has already made a name in the blockchain world, and similar to the story of Rust, it all started with Ethereum. To be precise, it has begun with Geth, an Ethereum Go-client that is currently the most widespread solution among all Ethereum clients.\n\nThe next stage of the Go adoption in the blockchain community was connected with the introduction of the Cosmos interoperable chain and its Cosmos SDK, the framework for fast blockchain development. Then, the popularization of Go happened due to Tendermint, a BFT consensus that is integrated by many blockchain clients. Eventually, at the moment, Go is a pretty widespread programming language that is used in many ways. Read: Ethereum dApp Development Guide\n\nWhat is Go?\n\nGo (often called Golang) is an open-source programming language that was modeled after C at Google and is currently used for many purposes.\n\nGolang is one of the best blockchain programming languages nowadays since it has an easy and readable syntax and fast compilation time. It is a single language that enables simultaneous programming, which is highly beneficial for many teams. Moreover, it is relatively easy to maintain in the long run and efficient compared to other blockchain coding languages, especially legacy ones.\n\nGo Advantages\n\nVery easy to learn;\n\nReadability and usability;\n\nHigh-speed performance;\n\nEasy to maintain in the long run;\n\nEfficient;\n\nSuitable for high-performing programs and distributed ecosystems.\n\nExamples\n\nGo-Ethereum – one of the three original implementations (along with C++ and Python) of the Ethereum protocol. Currently, it ​​is available either as a standalone client called Geth or as a library that can be embedded in Go, Android, or iOS projects.\n\nCosmos – an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services connected with IBC, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol.\n\nHyperledger Fabric – an open-source blockchain framework hosted by The Linux Foundation. It is modular and versatile, which allows for creating various dApps and blockchain solutions.\n\nChoose Go if you are looking for a programming language that can be easily learned and used both in EVM chains and new alternative chains.\n\nBy the way, Blaize has been providing blockchain consulting services for several years, leveraging our expertise in Golang and other programming languages to help clients build efficient and secure blockchain solutions. Contact us to learn more about our blockchain consulting services.\n\nC++\n\nC++ is an iconic programming language because it was used by Satoshi Nakamoto himself to create the Bitcoin chain. And this means that the whole altchain family, including Litecoin, PIVX, Qtum, Dogecoin, and many more, is built with C++.\n\nBesides, the C++ language is used to develop EOS and Telos blockchains with their framework of smart contracts.\n\nWhat is C++?\n\nC++ is one of the oldest general-purpose programming languages that was also used as a blockchain coding language by many world-famous projects.\n\nEven though C++ was first used in 1985, it remains a popular choice among blockchain developers and DeFi products. The main reason is that it offers exquisite CPU and memory control, which is essential for any blockchain, as well as high efficiency, code isolation, and compile time polymorphism.\n\nC++ advantages\n\nEfficient CPU management and memory control;\n\nEase of running parallel/non-parallel threads;\n\nOption to move semantics for copying data effectively;\n\nCompile-time polymorphism for enhanced performance;\n\nCode isolation for different data structures and more.\n\nExamples\n\nBitcoin – the first blockchain and the first cryptocurrency in the world. Having been created as an electronic peer-to-peer currency, Bitcoin has already exceeded the $60K threshold and is projected to rise in value again.\n\nLitecoin – the second-oldest cryptocurrency that forked from Bitcoin and became one of the first known altcoins.\n\nRipple – one of the leading blockchain solution providers that has created a real-time gross settlement system, a currency exchange, and a remittance network, among other developments.\n\nStellar – an open-source network for currencies and payments that offers a wallet and a decentralized exchange, enabling fast crypto, forex, and securities trades.\n\nEOS – an open-source blockchain protocol that allows programmers to develop, host, and run dApps. EOS aims to handle millions of transactions per second and offer top-notch scalability and flexibility.\n\nChoose C++ if you need an old, reliable programming language that many blockchain developers know. You can use it both for building blockchains and smart contracts.\n\nSolidity – The best programing language for smart contract development\n\nBeing influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, Solidity inherited all the beneficial features of these languages and became the most commonly used programming language for smart contract development.\n\nDevelopers from all over the world choose Solidity for its accessibility, precision, and extreme flexibility, which is highly valued in the blockchain industry. The whole DeFi sphere is built with the help of Solidity, from Uniswap to Chainlink. The majority of projects choose it for smart contract development, which is no wonder as it is concise, well-defined, and pretty easy to learn and use.\n\nWhat is Solidity?\n\nSolidity is an object-oriented high-level smart contract programming language that was created specifically for running smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This makes Solidity a perfect match for developing smart contracts and dApps on blockchain.\n\nSolidity is pretty similar to JavaScript, which means that it is rather easy to learn for most developers. What is more, it is one of the fastest-growing programming languages at the moment, so it’s safe to say that in the future, it will be even more developer-friendly and easy to learn.\n\nSolidity Advantages\n\nDeveloper-friendly;\n\nAccessibility to JavaScript infrastructures, debuggers, and other tools;\n\nStatically typed programming;\n\nThe possibility of inheritance properties in smart contracts;\n\nPrecise accuracy.\n\nExamples\n\nEthereum – all smart contracts that run on Ethereum are made with Solidity. The language was specifically created for developing and running programs on EVMs.\n\nChainlink – Solidity was used for creating smart contracts on Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network that enables computations on and off blockchain.\n\nUniswap – an ecosystem consisting of a protocol, a cryptocurrency exchange, a growing network of DeFi Apps, and many other pieces of the infrastructure all governed by the community. Uniswap was built with the help of Solidity, too.\n\nCompound – a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets. It is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built to create various dApps. Compound smart contracts were created using Solidity.\n\nChoose Solidity for developing smart contracts since it is a perfect language for this purpose.\n\nMOVE\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain development, Move stands out as an innovative beacon, charting new territories in the domain of programming languages. Birthed by Facebook’s subsidiary, Novi, for the then Libra project, Move goes beyond traditional paradigms, blending advanced architectural designs with a unique approach to handling digital assets, setting a new benchmark for blockchain-oriented languages.\n\nWHAT IS MOVE?\n\nBased on Rust, a popular, multi-purpose programming language, Move was meticulously crafted and brought to life for the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain project. Its design philosophy is underpinned by a resource-oriented model, which brings an unprecedented level of safety and assurance to digital transactions.\n\nUnlike traditional languages where data can be easily copied or replicated, Move treats digital assets as resources that are singular in nature. This means they cannot be inadvertently cloned or simultaneously exist in two locations. Such a groundbreaking approach ensures that every transaction retains its authenticity, reducing the risk of asset duplication or theft, especially vital in the context of financial transactions on a blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Move is built to be modular, allowing developers to craft, publish, and manage custom modules, bringing a high degree of flexibility and scalability to blockchain projects.\n\nThis language, operating at the bytecode level, introduces a new era of efficiency. Instead of going through the traditional route of compilation into bytecode as seen in Ethereum’s Solidity, Move leverages its native Move Virtual Machine (MVM). The result? Speed, precision, and a step closer to the machine’s heart.\n\nRead also: Blockchain in Healthcare\n\nMOVE ADVANTAGES\n\nMove prevents the unintentional duplication or deletion of assets.\n\nDesigned with the prevention of asset fraud in mind, ensuring safe and authenticated transactions.\n\nAs a modular language, developers can define and publish custom modules that declare their own resource types.\n\nOffers control over the data layout and how modules interact, facilitating a more predictable and secure environment.\n\nExclusively crafted for blockchain, ensuring seamless transactions and efficient use of resources.\n\nMove stands out with its verifiability. Dynamic dispatch mitigation ensures clarity during execution, and modularity ensures each segment can exist without inadvertently affecting another, simplifying code verification processes.\n\nMove diversity in components and specialized modules, Move aims to preempt potential threats, like re-entrancy attacks, enhancing the security layer.\n\nWorking hand-in-hand with the MVM, the built-in bytecode interpreter ensures seamless executions.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nDiem (formerly Libra) – the primary and most significant implementation of Move is the Diem blockchain itself. The very platform for which Move was created, Diem’s smart contracts and transaction scripts, are written using Move, ensuring security and flexibility at its core.\n\nDfinance – a decentralized platform for issuing stablecoins and creating financial instruments, Dfinance leverages Move for its smart contracts, benefiting from its safety-first approach.\n\nSui – a perfect example of Move’s adaptability in the modern blockchain arena, Sui harnesses Move’s power to craft a blockchain that emphasizes scalability, without compromising on decentralization and security. The “blockchain trilemma”, which posits the challenge of a blockchain being simultaneously decentralized, secure, and scalable, is being addressed head-on by Sui. By leveraging Move, Sui seeks to offer a solution that maintains a balance among these three aspects, differentiating itself from blockchains like Ethereum, which, while being decentralized and secure, struggles with scalability.\n\nAptos – Aptos embodies the essence of Move to develop a blockchain infrastructure that’s both scalable and composable. In a sector seemingly inundated with layer 1 blockchains such as Solana, Avalanche, and Tron, Aptos, powered by Move, has reignited interest and demand for innovative layer 1 solutions. Like Sui, Aptos is also making strides towards resolving the blockchain trilemma, emphasizing a harmony between decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nChoose Move if you want a robust and expressive language tailored for blockchain, designed with asset security and system efficiency in mind.\n\nMotoko\n\nMotoko is a great choice of programming language for blockchain and smart contract development in the DFINITY ecosystem.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of DFINITY yet, it is a non-profit organization that develops the Internet Computer, a public blockchain network platform based on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It is a rather isolated chain that was created from the concept of a world computer that cannot be shut down and was launched only in 2021.\n\nAt the moment, DFINITY has its own isolated DeFi ecosystem, which works similar to the modern DeFi we’re used to. The only difference is that it was written in Motoko and has no connections with regular EVM chains.\n\nDue to the isolated nature of DFINITY, the Motoko language remains in demand and can compete with EVM chains and Solidity.\n\nWhat is Motoko?\n\nMotoko is a relatively new programming language created for developing smart contracts directly on the Internet Computer by the DFINITY foundation. The language was created with blockchain technology in mind, so it is aimed to be secure and versatile while providing all the necessary tools for convenient and fast dApps development, as well as supporting the unique features of the Internet Computer.\n\nMotoko provides native support for the Internet Computer canisters (smart contracts), sequential style, simple modern coding style, and multiple features to help you leverage orthogonal persistence. All of these features make it an easy and safe language for the Internet Computer ecosystem.\n\nRead also: Blockchain in Healthcare\n\nMotoko Advantages\n\nAutomatic memory management;\n\nProductivity and safety features;\n\nBuilt-in support for orthogonal persistence;\n\nFixed-precision arithmetic.\n\nExamples\n\nInternet Computer – a modern public blockchain that allows for deploying secure, autonomous, and tamper-proof canisters (smart contracts) and running them at web speed.\n\nChoose Motoko if you want your project to be a part of the DFINITY ecosystem. Use this language for smart contract development.\n\nJAVA\n\nJava, renowned for its object-oriented approach and platform-independent bytecode, has been a primary force in the software development arena. Its concurrent execution capability, enabled by its robust JVM (Java Virtual Machine), has led to its significant application in distributed systems, including blockchains.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nNEO Blockchain – one of the unique features of the NEO blockchain is its compatibility with multiple programming languages, including Java. Developers can deploy and invoke smart contracts on the NEO blockchain using Java, making it a convenient choice for those familiar with the language.\n\nCorda – Corda, developed by R3, is an open-source blockchain platform tailored for businesses. Corda stands out because of its reliance on familiar enterprise development languages, particularly Java.\n\nJAVASCRIPT\n\nJavaScript’s evolution from a mere browser scripting language to a full-fledged, asynchronous programming environment, especially with the advent of Node.js, has been monumental. Its non-blocking I/O model and event-driven architecture make it exceptionally suitable for blockchain SDKs and real-time dApp interactions.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nweb.js & ethers.js – these libraries are foundational for developers interacting with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. They offer a streamlined interface to communicate with smart contracts and nodes.\n\nHardhat – this is a development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging Ethereum software. Built around JavaScript, Hardhat simplifies the process of building on the Ethereum platform.\n\nPYTHON\n\nPython’s readability and simplicity make it a preferred choice for developers venturing into new domains, including blockchain. Its versatility ensures it serves as a foundation for various SDKs, dialects, and blockchain tools.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nAlgorand – this blockchain platform offers algokit, a suite of tools with Python at its core, facilitating interactions with the Algorand network.\n\nNEO Blockchain – apart from Java, NEO also supports Python for smart contract development. NEO’s developer section offers insights into Python-powered contracts.\n\nProSaga Blockchain – Python plays a vital role in the ProSaga platform, enhancing its capabilities.\n\nCelo SDK – Python forms the foundation for some Celo toolkits, enabling easier blockchain interactions.\n\nVyper – a contract-oriented programming language, Vyper is built around Python principles and is used for EVM smart contracts.\n\nweb3py – similar to web.js, this is an SDK for Ethereum, but tailored for Python enthusiasts.\n\nBrownie – a Python-based framework, Brownie aids in Solidity development and testing.\n\nTYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN PROGRAMMING\n\nBlockchain development extends beyond mere code writing; it encapsulates a spectrum of tasks, each demanding its distinct expertise.\n\nBlockchain Core Development: At the heart of blockchain technology lies the core protocol. Developers in this sphere work to design the architectural foundations: consensus algorithms, data models, and the core logic governing transactions.\n\nSmart Contract Development: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Languages like Solidity and Move are dominant in this space. Developers focus on creating decentralized applications (dApps) on platforms such as Ethereum, Diem, and Polkadot, ensuring contracts are secure and free from vulnerabilities.\n\nBlockchain Software Development: This concerns the creation of tools, interfaces, and applications that are not part of the core protocol but interact with it. For instance, wallet software, interfaces for smart contract interaction, or blockchain explorers fall under this category.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR BLOCKCHAIN DOMAIN?\n\nEmbarking on a blockchain career demands a fusion of technical and conceptual prowess:\n\nStrong Programming Skills: Proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, or C++ is crucial.

According to our experience, Rust suits blockchain development purposes best since it enables productive collaborative work, provides clear development guidelines and offers high speed, stability, and overall efficiency. However, you should choose the blockchain language based on the ecosystem for your project in the first place.\n\nWhat is the best programming language for smart contract development?\n\nSolidity is currently the most popular programming language for smart contract development. Over 200K developers worldwide choose Solidity for its great accessibility, flexibility, and precision.\n\nHow to choose a suitable blockchain coding language for a DeFi project?\n\nWhen building a DeFi product from scratch, you should start by choosing the ecosystem for your project, which will help you select the best-fit blockchain programming language. Decide on where you’d like to see your project, which “neighbors” and potential partners you want to have, and which opportunities you want to enable for users and developers.\n\nIf you’d like to avoid any headache, contact the Blaize team to get a free extensive consultation on blockchain development and get a custom solution made specifically for your project.\n\nWhere can I find professional blockchain developers?\n\nIf you are looking for highly qualified engineers with hands-on experience in programming languages for developing blockchain-based products, the best option is to hire a ready-made outsourced team.

Mastering a blockchain-specific programming language, such as Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Polkadot, is paramount. Familiarity with distributed ledger concepts, consensus algorithms (like PoW or PoS), and smart contract mechanics is crucial. Furthermore, hands-on experience with development tools and frameworks, such as Truffle or Hardhat for Ethereum, will facilitate a smoother entry into practical development.\n\nMove vs Solidity. What’s the key points here?\n\nMove and Solidity are both perfect languages for blockchain development but both of them have certain features. Solidity, Ethereum’s flagship language, is contract-oriented, widely adopted, and has a JavaScript-like syntax, making it accessible to many developers. In contrast, Move, developed for Facebook’s Diem (formerly Libra), introduces the concept of “resources”, which ensures assets are non-fungible and can’t be duplicated, thereby enhancing security. While Solidity compiles into EVM bytecode, Move bypasses some abstraction layers, executing directly on its native Move Virtual Machine, ensuring efficiency. The choice between the two languages depends on the specific use-case, desired blockchain platform, and security considerations."
