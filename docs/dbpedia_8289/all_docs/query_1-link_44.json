        "text": "Audio Software & Plug-in Compatibility\n\nJUCE makes it easy to create both standalone audio applications or plug-ins that can be loaded inside digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Logic, Live, Pro Tools, FL Studio or Cubase. A single JUCE project can be used to create VST, VST3, AU, AUv3, AAX and LV2 plug-ins from the same source code, and also provides the functionality required to host these plug-in formats in your own software.\n\nLearn More\n\nOperating System Compatibility & Mobile devices\n\nJUCE is a cross platform framework allowing a single codebase to compile to native applications and plug-ins with the same user experience on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android, across both desktop and mobile. Native applications can be launched in the iOS and Android device simulators to simplify testing and debugging, and can be packaged up for distribution within the mobile app stores.\n\nAudio Processing & MIDI\n\nJUCE provides an abstraction for processing audio samples and MIDI from the native audio devices on each platform or a host DAW. With JUCE’s library of digital signal processing (DSP) building blocks you can rapidly prototype and deploy different audio effects, filters, instruments and generators.\n\nLearn More\n\nUser Interface & Graphics\n\nJUCE provides a versatile UI abstraction that can run on any platform, with the option of hardware acceleration via OpenGL. JUCE handles the rendering of 2D and 3D graphics, and a selection of image formats and fonts. All JUCE UI widgets can be themed, allowing you to have a consistent user experience across multiple different products and platforms.\n\nBuild System Integration\n\nJUCE is a modularised, open source C++ framework that is easy to integrate into your existing build system. Each JUCE module is distributed as C++14 source code that can either be directly included in your existing build workflow or added to a CMake project via JUCE’s CMake integration. JUCE’s build configuration tool, the Projucer, also allows you to create entire projects in the native development tools on each platform, like Visual Studio, Xcode, Android Studio, Code::Blocks and Makefiles.\n\nLearn More\n\nAccessibility\n\nJUCE hooks into the native accessibility controls on each platform by default, allowing users to interact with JUCE-based software using the standard workflows of each operating system."
