        "text": "While today’s recording software is easier than ever to use, it still takes a while to learn your way around any new music production app. If you’re new to producing music, you might be deciding between Logic vs. Ableton for your main DAW.\n\nIt’s no surprise. Logic Pro and Ableton Live are two of the best DAW platforms for new producers.\n\nSo which one should you choose? What do you need to know to decide and what does it take to learn?\n\nIn this article I’ll break down the pros and cons of each DAW and explain why you might want to choose one over the other.\n\nHow to choose a DAW\n\nBefore we get started, it’s worth mentioning that all DAWs are created for the same purpose—producing music.\n\nWhile it may seem like there are huge differences from one to the next, many of the core functions are the same between programs.\n\nIn fact, today’s major DAWs are all capable of creating professional productions. The gaps in performance or features between different DAWs aren’t as wide as they used to be.\n\nMaking the right choice isn’t a life or death issue, and you can always change it up down the road. Not only that, many producers learn more than one DAW to stay flexible for different projects and collaborators.\n\nThat said, your main DAW should feel comfortable for your workflow and shouldn’t get in the way of your creativity.\n\nLogic vs. Ableton—the key differences\n\nWith the basics out of the way, I’ll break down the key differences between Logic and Ableton and explain who can benefit most from their core features.\n\nWorkflow\n\nWorkflow means the basic process of building tracks in a DAW. There are plenty of different approaches that vary by genre and personal style.\n\nOn the surface, the single biggest workflow difference between Logic and Ableton is the loop-based sequencing environment in Live called the Session view.\n\nOn the surface, the single biggest workflow difference between Logic and Ableton lies in the loop-based sequencing environment in Live called the Session view.\n\nInstead of a traditional left-to-right timeline, Session view lets you quickly capture loops and arrange them into patterns and sequences.\n\nClips in the Session view have their own powerful pane of controls—including the famous Warp function that allows you to manipulate tempo and pitch.\n\nIf you work with virtual instruments, loops or existing audio, you might find this approach faster and more flexible for creating tracks.\n\nWhile Apple has debuted a loop-based view in the latest release of Logic Pro, it still feels more traditional overall.\n\nFor example, the Logic Pro mixer offers a more familiar experience for mixing full songs with features like configurable buses and per-channel EQ.\n\nOn top of that, you may find traditional timeline operations like level automation easier to perform in Logic.\n\nOverall, if you prefer a linear timeline and plan to get serious about mixing, Logic may be the best way forward.\n\nHowever, it’s hard to deny the creative boost of the Ableton Session view for building up loop-based tracks fast.\n\nMIDI\n\nLogic and Ableton handle MIDI equally well although each has their own strong points.\n\nLogic and Ableton handle MIDI equally well although each has their own strong points.\n\nI mentioned above that the MIDI clips in the Session view are easy to arrange in Live.\n\nBut Logic offers deep MIDI editing capabilities that can be helpful for programming expressive parts. Its piano roll editor is sophisticated but not too complex for beginners to jump in and get started.\n\nOn top of that, Logic includes a powerful notation editor that can turn MIDI parts into written music quickly and accurately.\n\nIf you’d like to use MIDI to emulate real instruments or write traditional scored music, Logic might be a good choice.\n\nThat said, Ableton offers perhaps the easiest MIDI control of DAW parameters with external hardware. Simply click the MIDI Learn icon, select any parameter and move any knob, button or slider on your controller—Ableton will map it automatically!\n\nThis lends itself especially well to playing…live…which is a big benefit to choosing Ableton.\n\nToday’s DAWs come with powerful instruments and effects that can be just as good as third-party plugins.\n\nWhile you’ll probably want to curate your own suite of mixing tools over time, it’s good to start out with the basics covered.\n\nAbleton Live is well known for its producer-friendly effects and great instruments. If you need quality synthesis and sampling tools for making beats, Ableton’s built-in options are hard to beat.\n\nTheir signature look and feel also makes these instruments some of the easiest to use, even for beginners.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt intimidated by FM synthesis or powerful wavetable synths, Ableton’s take on these essentials will have you designing sounds in no time.\n\nAbleton Live is well known for its producer-friendly effects and great instruments. If you need quality synthesis and sampling tools for making beats, Ableton’s built-in options are hard to beat.\n\nBut if you’re more concerned with traditional recording techniques, Logic offers some key tools for working with musical performances.\n\nFor example, Flex Time and Flex Pitch offer audio editing capabilities that typically come with paid software like AutoTune.\n\nThey can be a lifesaver when it comes to vocal pitch correction and rhythm editing.\n\nLogic also comes standard with several virtual instruments built to emulate studio favorites.\n\nI’m talking about classic keyboards like the Hammond B3 organ or Rhodes electric piano.\n\nRounded out with the the flexible character compressor and new vintage EQ collection, Logic offers a complete set of tools right out of the box.\n\nExtra features\n\nToday’s DAWs are more flexible than ever and many include features that go beyond typical audio processing.\n\nI’ll list a few important ones here, but head over to our in-depth DAW guides if you want to learn more.\n\nVideo\n\nBoth Ableton Live 11 and Logic Pro feature the ability to add a video to the session. This is especially useful for creating soundtrack music or re-editing tracks for sync licensing.\n\nEditing the video file is limited in both DAWs but at least you’ll be able to sync your work to the action on the timeline.\n\nSpatial audio\n\nRecorded sound doesn’t just come in two channel stereo anymore. There’s home theater configurations like 5.1 and 7.1 and new standards like Dolby Atmos.\n\nApple is betting big on spatial audio with the introduction of Atmos to Apple Music in 2021. Conveniently, Logic Pro contains new features for mixing in this format if you’re interested in trying it out.\n\nLive is a bit more limited in this respect, but Ableton recently released a Surround Panner device for their Max for Live modular environment (more on that in a second) that helps for mixing in these formats.\n\nMax for Live\n\nThis feature is unique to Ableton, but it expands the DAW’s power so much that it’s worth mentioning here. Max/MSP is a famous graphical programming language for audio used by composers and sound designers.\n\nMax for Live is an edition of the software built to run inside Live. You can design and build almost any kind of musical tool you can imagine in Max for Live, but you don’t have to be a programming whiz to use it. There’s a large community out there developing custom devices available to download for free.\n\nPrice\n\nWhile features and workflow are certainly important, cost is a big factor at the end of the day.\n\nWhile features and workflow are certainly important, cost is a big factor at the end of the day.\n\nPro DAW software doesn’t come cheap, but there are still big variations between apps with different tiers and plans available in some cases.\n\nLogic has recently become cheaper than ever at a surprising $199 USD for the full version of the app. Refreshingly, there’s no subscription model either so paying this amount once means you’ll have access to the DAW forever.\n\nAbleton comes in three price tiers with an introductory edition available for just $99 USD. Unfortunately, Live 11 Intro is severely limited in track count and I/O. I’d only recommend this option if you’re looking to experiment with Live’s basic features to see if it’s a good fit.\n\nThat leaves Live 11 Standard at $449 USD and Live 11 Suite at $749 USD. Standard contains all the essential features of Live without limitations, but you’ll need to buy Suite to use the full complement of instruments and effects.\n\nEven with the high price, Live is still worth every penny. However, Logic Pro is cheaper overall.\n\nHardware\n\nFinally, there are a few hardware issues to consider as you decide between Logic and Ableton.\n\nFirst off, it’s worth noting that Logic is only available for Mac computers. It’s one of Apple’s flagship pro apps, so don’t expect a Windows version any time soon.\n\nAbleton works just as well on either platform, so it might be high on your list if you use a PC for production.\n\nWhen it comes to hardware, Ableton has a handful of specialized controllers that have been developed to let you go hands-on with all its features.\n\nWe broke down the whole list in this article, but the most important one to know is the Push. It was built by the Ableton team to be the perfect hands-on companion to Live.\n\nIf you’re planning to play your DAW like an instrument Ableton has the best dedicated controllers.\n\nLogic vs. Ableton—the verdict\n\nAs I pointed out above, there’s no clear winner when it comes to choice of DAW. It’s all about what works for you.\n\nThat said, you may have identified some common threads in my breakdown of Logic and Ableton Live, so here’s my advice in a nutshell:\n\nChoose your own adventure\n\nDeciding on which DAW to use may seem daunting, but it shouldn’t stop you from getting started as a producer.\n\nIn the end, any DAW you choose is a great start, even if you have to make a change down the road.\n\nIf you’ve made it through this article you’ll at least have a head start on two of the most popular DAWs for new producers."
