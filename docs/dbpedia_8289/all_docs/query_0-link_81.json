        "text": "I am surprised that both Java and C are still at the top.\n\nI am an old C programmer. I write my C so it could be converted to C++ easily enough but C++ keeps changing so I stick with C.\n\nI program in Java too but I am curious why anybody still uses it.\n\nI wonder where structured text is in that list.\n\nForgive my ignorance as I am not a programmer but an electrical guy most familiar with ladder. I thought the world ran on Java because of it's portability? In the industrial world I think the largest growing Scada software, Ignition, runs on it.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nForgive my ignorance as I am not a programmer but an electrical guy most familiar with ladder. I thought the world ran on Java because of it's portability? In the industrial world I think the largest growing Scada software, Ignition, runs on it.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nPerhaps Java is just becoming less popular for web programming. There have been a few problems with Java security.\n\nYes, Java is portable but that would only be significant if trying to compatible with OS X, Windows, Linux and a few others. When making an embedded product one usually only cares about the one microcontroller in that product.\n\nAnyway, it is nice to know this old dinosaur knows the 2 most popular languages but to be honest I am much better at C. I use Java only for those applications that need an HMI and I don't like writing HMIs.\n\nSo again forgive my ignorance but what language would be running in say the computers in my car? The radio/navigation system in Java and the rest in C?\n\nI be anything that doesn't have an HMI is written in C. Maybe C++.\n\nMy young kids are very interested in programming an I have been pushing them, and they have been, picking up Java along with Python.\n\nGood choices. I too have play around with Python. What I like about Python is that it has scientific and numerical libraries called scipy and numpy. This allows me to do the same thing that I can do in Scilab. Scilab is a kludge of a bunch of tacked on features so I can't get excited about Scilab. Python is a very modern and clean language. I would put more effort into learning python but I just bought Mathematica ( $2500 ).\n\nI know C++ and C# are popular but in your opinon what foundational language should I be encouraging them to learn? I thought C was about dead?\n\nC, Java, or Python are all worth knowing.\n\nC is a very low level high level language. One can write very efficient code and it compiles down to machine code which is why we use it. C++ compiles down to machine code too. Python and Java do not.\n\nIf one knows Java it will be easy to move to different programming languages. I use Java with Netbeans because Netbeans makes writing HMIs easier.\n\nA lot depends on the interests of your kids and what kind of programming your kids want to do. If they want to control robots I would say C or perhaps C++. If they want to write Android apps then Java is the way to go. If they want to do scientific programming then Python with scipy and numpy. There are all just tools. The main thing is that they learn one well in hopes that they get a broader understanding why the other languages exist.\n\nLong ago I did a couple of machines with about 99% 'C' programming.\n\nThe system was a Prolog STD bus system with an embedded version of MS-DOS. The systems were a PC-XT equivalent. The system had no rotating media (Hard or floppy drives). The NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) was free so I used a free portion of the system timer chip connected to it as a time-slice interrupt.\n\nI wrote a bit of code in assembly to process the interrupt by saving the system and creating a new stack then calling the machine processing code, which was all in 'C'. The interrupt was 50 times a second and provided good responsiveness. Of course the C code had no For/Next loops. Each section of the machine was a Switch/Case structure.\n\nUpon exiting the machine process control returned back to a DOS/C based user display which could observe/modify the status of the machine through shared global variables.\n\nWe had some visitors from ProLog while checking out the third or fourth machine using this setup. They assumed I was using a co-processor card to run the machine because DOS was running just fine. They were interested when I described the setup.\n\nUnfortunately the system interfered with any time-sensitive DOS program requirements like networking. And their next versions of the CPU card appropriated the NMI for memory parity error so that ended that use. We got more into PLCs next."
