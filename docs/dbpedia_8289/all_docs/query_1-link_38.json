        "text": "Discover the best programming languages for kids and teens to learn! There are so many to choose from and they each offer different benefits. But one of the best things about computer science is that even though programming languages can have major differences in their implementation, there are many similarities in fundamental concepts.\n\nSo when your child starts learning one language, they are already gaining skills to apply to other languages! Join along as we reveal more about coding for kids, and the benefits of languages that are great for kids.\n\nHow to Pick the First Coding Language for Your Child\n\nHere, we’ll discuss three of the most common languages new coders learn: Scratch, Python, and Javascript. We’ll outline several considerations for choosing a language, and help you pick the best first coding language for your kid, based on their interests and previous experiences.\n\n1. What’s your child’s previous coding learning experience?\n\nScratch, Python, and Javascript present varying levels of initial difficulty. For students with little-to-no experience, and those in elementary school, Scratch is a great place to start.\n\nScratch coding is a block-coding language, meaning that students code by dragging and arranging logic “blocks” onto a canvas. While its applications are ultimately more limited than the other two languages, Scratch shares many coding fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, and variables.\n\nUnlike Scratch, Python and Javascript are written languages, meaning children type out all their code. Typing is often more of a natural barrier for many children: there is more room for errors and the coding syntax can be a higher initial hurdle. Middle schoolers can experience a lot of success in Python and Javascript, but it is recommended that they have previous coding experience with a language like Scratch.\n\nThat being said, if your child is committed to learning a written language, and is in middle school or high school, Python is more user-friendly in terms of its syntax than Javascript. Python is known for being one of the more human-centric languages, and “reading” the code will be easier in Python than in Javascript.\n\nA final note regarding Javascript - as a web development language, it tends to be used in conjunction with formatting languages like HTML or CSS. If your child is already familiar with HTML/CSS, Javascript will allow them to expand what they can already do.\n\n2. Which learning style does your child prefer?\n\nAnother factor to consider when choosing between these languages is your child’s preferred learning style. A big selling point of Scratch is that it is incredibly friendly for visual and kinesthetic learners. The blocks are color-coded and designed to move easily on the screen.\n\nA tricky Python concept like “nesting code,” for example, is more accessible in Scratch. If you child is less confident with coding concepts like logic and structure, he or she will benefit a great deal from Scratch’s colorful, fun approach.\n\nDoes your middle-schooler love logic puzzles and analytical thinking? Python or Javascript are great options, allowing them to tweak the logic in their code, and control exactly how it behaves and ultimately have more creative control of the end product.\n\nNo matter what language you choose, your child will get practice with major computer science fundamentals and skills, using both sides of their brains to build projects.\n\n3. Why does your child want to learn coding?\n\nLearning computer science is most meaningful for students when motivated by its applications in the real world. Thus, it is smart to choose a first language that enables them pursue their interests and create projects they care about.\n\nDoes your child love the art of storytelling or making games? Scratch is a great choice, because it will inspire them to build games, animations, and other highly visual projects.\n\nIf your child really wants to build a website or app, Javascript is a good language to learn. Javascript enables all of the dynamic (read: moving, changing) content online, and can be used in conjunction with HTML/CSS to create fun, extremely customizable pages. Javascript can also provide a great jumping off point for students who are excited about app development.\n\nIs your child excited about data science or software development? Python is a great place to start. Python, and Python libraries are the gold standard for data analysis, and can be used for everything from creating graphs for a science project to developing advanced data models.\n\nWhat is the best programming language for a child to learn?\n\nPython is the best real-world programming language for a child to learn. It is easy to learn, and the syntax is closer to English than other computer languages. It is super versatile and you can do so many things with Python ranging from building games to analyzing data. Python is also one of the most common languages, so it is a crucial skill for any budding computer scientist to learn.\n\nWhich is the easiest coding language?\n\nScratch coding is the easiest programming language to learn. The visual block structure creates an intuitive environment to finish a task. The Scratch workspace also allows you to easily edit your code by dragging in the blocks you want, quickly removing the ones you don’t, and a large window to test the results of your code. Scratch comes with many cool characters and backdrops which makes it super fun to see your code come to life!\n\nCurious what other programming languages might be suitable for kids? Here's the complete guide.\n\nExplore the best programming languages for kids\n\nFor each of the ten languages we’ve picked below, we’ve included an overview of the languages, its pros and cons, the features of the languages, the best ages to learn the language, and how to get started.
