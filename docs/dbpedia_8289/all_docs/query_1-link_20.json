        "text": "There are a handful of different programming languages out there, so how do you know which one you should learn? From Python to Kotlin and Java to C++, every developer must decide which language to adopt. For many, the choice comes down to Java or C++.\n\nThis article takes a deeper look into these two languages to hopefully give you some guidance in making the choice that best fits your plans.\n\nWhich is easier to learn?\n\nMost experts will tell you that Java is easier to learn. Itâs a newer language than C++ and isnât as complex in its principles or execution. However, thereâs more to consider than a languageâs learning curve. Selecting a programming language comes down to what you want to do with it.Â\n\nIf you want to create mobile apps from your couch, then Java is your answer, but if designing software used inside military planes, C++ is a better choice. To make an informed decision, you need more information, which is why weâll compare the two languages to help you decide which is best for you.Â\n\nWhat is Java?Â Â\n\nJava is the most common programming language used by developers. Itâs a high-level, class-based, object-oriented language that takes a program from concept to completion.Â\n\nWhat are the uses for Java?Â\n\nDevelopers use different languages for different reasons. To pick between languages, you need to think about your goals. What do you want to create? What kind of job do you want? Your response will steer your decision.Â\n\nDevelopers often use Java to:Â\n\nDevelop Android apps\n\nCreate enterprise software\n\nCreate scientific computing applications\n\nManage application servers\n\nDesign wearable tech\n\nLaunch Ecommerce portals\n\nWhat are the advantages of Java?\n\nThere are some advantages to learning Java, which include:Â\n\nSmall learning curve\n\nWhile some coding languages are complex and challenging to learn, Java is not. Developers say the language is easy to pick up. Its syntax is straightforward, making it easy to understand, write, and maintain.Â\n\nWORA\n\nWith Java, developers can write once and run anywhere (WORA). In other words, Java can run on any machine regardless of its operating system. This independence is one of the big reasons developers use it.Â\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nJava is an object-oriented language (OOP), which organizes the software design around objects instead of functions or logic. Simply put, it makes it easier for developers to write the code and reuse pieces of it, which aids in efficiency and scalability.Â\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Java?\n\nThere are downsides to this language too, which include:Â\n\nSpeed\n\nJava requires a lot of memory to function, making its computing speed fairly slow. Other languages, including C++, are faster.Â\n\nMediocre GUI\n\nWhen it comes to the graphical user interface (GUI), Java can be lacking. Plenty of frameworks can improve the GUI, like Swing and JavaFX, but none can create a complex user interface.Â\n\nNo backup\n\nJava utilizes storage and doesnât provide any backups. It makes it difficult for a developer to revert to a previous version of a code. Itâs a significant drawback for some developers who see the value of backups.\n\nWhat is C++?\n\nC++ is an object-oriented programming language that has evolved from a family of C programming languages. Some call C++ âC with Classâ because itâs the first to introduce object-oriented programming, which uses classes as a core programming principle, something the older C programming languages lacked.Â\n\nWhat are the uses for C++?\n\nConsidering which programming language to learn can be a challenge, but if your ideal job focuses on any of these categories, C++ could be right for you:Â\n\nCreation of operating systems\n\nVideo game development\n\nIoT devices\n\nDatabases\n\nWeb browsers\n\nAR/VR applications\n\nWhat are the advantages of C++?\n\nThe upsides of learning C++ include:Â\n\nHigh-paying jobs\n\nIn general, developers are high-paying jobs. The average salary for a software developer in the US is $112,000, according to Glassdoor [1]. However, C++ developers are considered specialized, so their salary may be a bit higher than Java developers.Â\n\nLibrary support\n\nC++ has a Standard Template Library (STL) that can help developers write code quickly and efficiently. These templates can ease some of the burden during the creation process since programs arenât created from scratch.Â\n\nLarge community of support\n\nSince this coding language has been around for decades, a full community of developers is available who can offer aspiring developers support. This support can offer solutions when developers hit a roadblock.Â\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of C++?\n\nLike Java, there are challenges with C++ as well.\n\nLack of security\n\nExperts say C++ isnât as secure as other languages like Java. C++ has what experts refer to as âmemory unsafety,â which refers to vulnerabilities in the memory codes. Many developers donât consider security when theyâre selecting a programming language, but it has become more prevalent as cyber threats evolve.\n\nNo garbage collector\n\nA garbage collector finds and removes unnecessary data from a computerâs memory. Itâs an automatic process that usually goes on in the background, except if youâre working with C++. This programming language forces developers to identify unneeded properties and remove them independently.Â\n\nUse of pointers\n\nC++ and its related programs use pointers, which âpoint toâ the variable whose address they store. If that sounds complicated, youâre right. Developers agree that pointers in the C++ language are difficult to comprehend and utilize throughout the code.Â\n\nAdditional specifics to consider when choosing between learning Java and C++\n\nProgrammers with C++ knowledge are more likely to work with a team of developers on large-scale projects.\n\nC++ is used more in large-scale development, like for banks or governments, whereas Java creates more consumer products like apps, software, and video games.\n\nJava is ideal for creating simple mobile applications, so if your ideal job is to become a freelance app creator, Java is where you should start.Â\n\nBig-name companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple use C++. If your dream job is to work for one of these tech giants, consider learning C++.\n\nItâs common for programmers to learn more than one language.\n\nJavaâs syntax is borrowed from C++, so if you learn C++ first, itâs easy to pick up Java.\n\nHow to learn coding languages\n\nThere are many options to choose from when youâre ready to grow your skill set by learning a coding language. You might consider getting a four-year degree in an area like computer science or application development, or you can take online courses to start building your knowledge now.Â\n\nRead more: Bachelorâs Degree Guide: Resources for Your Undergraduate Education\n\nStart learning Java or C++ today on Coursera\n\nOnce you've chosen a programming language to start with, consider the following learning resources. Each one is 100-percent online and self-paced.\n\nFor a brief yet beginner-friendly introduction to Java programming, consider enrolling in LearnQuest's online course,Introduction to Java. It includes hands-on practice to give students working knowledge of Java syntax, data types, branches, and loops.\n\nIf this is your first time learning a programming language and you want to start with C++, Programming in C++: A Hands-on Introduction may be the right learning path for you. Throughout the four classes included in this Codio program, you will be exposed to everything from programming fundamentals to object-oriented design.Â"
