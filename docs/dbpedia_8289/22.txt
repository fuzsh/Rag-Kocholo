C++ is among the top 10 most widely used programming languages in the world [1]. It's a general-purpose programming language (GPL), which means you can use it to build any type of program. The article below further explores the use cases, benefits, and potential drawbacks of C plus-plus. You can use it to determine whether it's the right programming language for you to learn.

What is C plus-plus?

C++ (or âC-plus-plusâ) is a generic programming language for building software. Itâs an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website. Typically, a user account contains closely related data like first name, last name, and email address. Bundling this information together into an object makes it easy to replicate the process of creating a new account.

What is C plus-plus used for?

Over time, C++ has become a choice language for building fast and reliable software. Its versatility makes it an excellent match for complex applications, embedded systems, and internet of things (IoT) devices. A few of its most common use cases are as follows:

Software engineering. A couple of applications you might use daily that were created with C plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon.

Operating system (OS) development. Examples of OS that were created with C++ include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.

Graphical user interfaces. C++ is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI. Â

Virtual reality (VR). C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you want to develop VR applications.

BlockchainÂ technology. The well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be used to create smart contracts.

Game development. You can develop games and gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of Warcraft and the Xbox console.

Should you learn C++?

C plus-plus is a great language to learn if you want to gain a deep understanding of how computers work. It's generally considered to be a good starting point for novice or beginner coders. With knowledge of C++, you may also be able to pick up other languages like Python or JavaScript more easily.

Advantages of learning C++

Programming in C++ offers several advantages. Because it is object oriented, you can easily organize and classify the code. Instead of rewriting code from scratch, you can reuse it. You can also use C plus-plus to interact directly with a computerâs hardware. As a result, you'll be able to control how a system uses its computational resources, like software, hardware, and memory.Â
