MrYsf:

Hello everyone,

This is a newbie question for the pros of programming, I'm kind of new to programming, I've learned Pascal in school and I quite understand the basics and the logic behind programming and I believe that I can learn quickly to code.

I'm planning to buy an Arduino because I'm a soon going to be an IT student (yay!) and I want to be ahead of my classmates

Anyways my question is fairly simple, I know that Arduino supports so many different language but mainly a little bit of C/C++ which according to experts it's relatively hard to learn so I'm wondering what coding language supported by Arduino do you, pros, suggest for a young student who wants to get into programming?

Thanks in advance!

I've never heard it called "Arduino C". If anything, it would be "Arduino C++", but I've never heard that either. Arduino calls the programming language of Arduino sketches the "Arduino programming language". But it's important to understand that the .ino files of Arduino sketches are compiled as C++ after some minimal preprocessing:

Build Process · arduino/Arduino Wiki · GitHub

So learn the "Arduino programming language", as documented in the Arduino Language Reference:

Arduino Reference - Arduino Reference

then for the many other useful parts of the language that are not documented in the Arduino Language Reference, use a standard C++ reference. I like this one:

You can use C with Arduino if you like, by adding files to your sketch that have the .c extension, but it is fairly rare. People get away with pretending they are writing Arduino sketches in C because C is a subset of C++, but it's silly to think this way, and will lead to a lot of confusion when you encounter the many uses of C++-specific features in Arduino code and can't find any explanation of them in your C references.
