        "text": "Jimmy Wales, 51, is the internet entrepreneur who found fame in 2001 as the founder of Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopedia. Today he lives in Notting Hill, London, with his wife, Kate Garvey, and their two children.\n\nHow did your childhood influence your attitude to money?\n\nI was born in Huntsville, Alabama. My parents were always very practical; we didn’t have a huge amount of money, but we weren’t poor. They certainly had the attitude that work and earning money is really important; standard American middle-class values.\n\nMy father was a grocery store manager, my mother a schoolteacher. But later she went back to school [college] and became a pharmacist. My mother and my uncle were always very entrepreneurial. My mother had a music school and day centre at different times and eventually my parents owned their own pharmacy for a bit, so they were very business-oriented.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nI was a paper boy, a classic American kind of thing to do, when I was 12 or 13. Then I worked in a grocery store.\n\nDo you use cash, debit cards or credit cards?\n\nI mainly use debit cards, and cash because it’s convenient. I don’t use credit cards. I don’t like having debt.\n\nHave you ever had trouble paying your bills?\n\nNot really. Once in my early 20s in graduate school I had a credit card bill that got a little out of control. It was a bit stressful paying that back down, quite annoying. After that I’ve been pretty obsessive about not having a credit card and living on a cash basis.\n\nDo you invest in the stock market?\n\nNo, other than my retirement account.\n\nDoes money make you happy?\n\nNo, it doesn’t. I’m not particularly fussed about money.\n\nWhat have been your best and worst financial decisions?\n\nThe best is being an entrepreneur. The bulk of my personal wealth is tied up in my company, Wikia, the for-profit Wiki company, so I don’t see any cash from that. But it grows and the company’s doing well. So that means I’m a saver. But whatever money I get I tend to spend, so I don’t have other investments outside the company.\n\nHave you ever been ripped off?\n\nYeah. I paid a person $2,000 (£1,528) to install a gas line at my house in Florida, who then vanished and never did the work.\n\nWhat’s the hardest lesson you’ve learned about business?\n\nI think it’s hard for me personally, as a very friendly person, to quickly enough recognise that someone’s not working out and to dismiss them from a job. So at various times I’ve had a person in a role for too long and not realised it, or realised it but didn’t want to deal with it.\n\nWhat personal qualities are important for an entrepreneur?\n\nPersistence, even when things get discouraging. You have to pursue something you find interesting for its own sake rather than just because you think it’s going to make money. It’s important that people see you have passion for what you’re doing and are doing it well.\n\nHave you ever been involved in any lucrative adverts?\n\nI did a watch advertisement for a Swiss brand, Maurice Lacroix. People sent me photos of giant pictures of me on billboards in China, which I found amusing. They had a quote from me about authenticity. I was paid for doing it, but it wasn’t a fortune. They gave me a free watch.\n\nHow does Wikipedia make money (or you make a living), since it doesn’t carry advertising?\n\nWikipedia is a charity and exists on donations from the public. Small donations are the bulk of the money; people donate an average of $20. I don’t take a salary or expenses. I personally make money by giving speeches. I’m also a shareholder in Wikia, the completely separate company I co-founded with Angela Beesley, which gets money because it’s advertising-supported and has done very well. Presumably some day I’ll make something from that.\n\nWould Wikipedia volunteers mind if you made a fortune from speeches?\n\nI don’t think so. I’ve been doing it for a long time now and they are pretty happy with it. I am not an employee of Wikipedia.\n\nFortune.com quotes you saying: “If I never fail again, it’s probably that I’m not doing anything interesting.” Is that off-putting for potential investors?\n\nI don’t think so. It’s a very Silicon Valley approach to say if you’re being a genuine entrepreneur, not everything’s going to work out. Everybody’s comfortable with that, because if you don’t have any stumbles you probably weren’t trying to be different enough.\n\nIs it true, as stated on your Wikipedia listing, that you estimated that Wikipedia was worth $3bn?\n\nI did say that. I was on Larry King [a US American television and radio host] and he pushed me to say what it would be worth if it were a commercial business. It isn’t, so it doesn’t really have a meaning.\n\nBut if you look at the traffic of Wikipedia and you estimate what the revenue could be if you put ads on, that was a rough estimate. But because it’s a charity it’s like asking what the Red Cross would be worth if it became a commercial business.\n\nWhat’s the funniest thing that has ever happened to you concerning money?\n\nThe press has often been very interested in whether or not I’m a billionaire because Wikipedia is so successful. I find it very funny when there’s a headline along the lines of “Jimmy Wales is not a billionaire”, like I’m supposed to be. Oh dear, poor me.\n\nIs making speeches profitable?\n\nI do probably three speeches a month, four including unpaid things, so 40 or more a year. I’d rather not say how much I’ve been paid for them. Less than a billion…"
