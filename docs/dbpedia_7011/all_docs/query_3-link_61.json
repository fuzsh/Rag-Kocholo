That's when he began to experiment with the idea of an online encyclopedia. In 2001, Wales launched Wikipedia, a website where thousands of community members could contribute, edit, and monitor content on just about anything. Today, the non-profit has stayed true to its open source roots and is the fifth most visited website in the world. PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Florence Wetterwald created Blabla dolls â€“ eco-friendly knitted dolls made in Peru.
