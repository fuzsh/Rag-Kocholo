        "text": "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has just done something very bold, and arguably quite unfashionable: he has launched a social network.\n\nBut where Twitter and Facebook were set up largely with the intention of (a) becoming a verb, and then (b) selling advertising, TPO is aiming at something quite different -- making it easier to donate to charity.\n\nSupported by The People's Operator, a mobile network that donates 10 percent of bills to good causes of which Wales is executive chairman, TPO is intended to be \"Twitter but better\" -- and that's both better to use, and better in outcome. The network will not sell ads, but instead provide a platform for commission-free donations to charity partners. The current functionality of the network is fairly standard, but the intent is to grow the project into a genuine alternative to the commercial social media giants.\n\nIt's early days for TPO, of course, with 20 launch charities and causes signed up as partners, and an exclusively early adopter user base posting messages and testing the waters. Wales is betting that the palpable demand for users to try other networks (at least in the short term) can be converted into a long-term win both for TPO and for the causes that form its bedrock.\n\nWIRED.co.uk caught up with Wales to discuss what makes TPO different, how it can harness social media for good, and what it would take to disrupt the entrenched world of the social media giants.\n\nWIRED.co.uk: How long has the TPO social platform been in the works?\n\nWales: The social networking platform has been in the works since late last year. That was when I first started working on the prototype. We've been plugging away building version 1.0, that we're releasing today, since. The US launch of the phone network has been in the works for about the same amount of time -- we signed the deal with Sprint late last year and we've been working on integrating with their systems so we could launch phone service sales in the US. In the UK we've doubled our customer base in the first five months of this year.\n\nWhat was the inspiration and philosophy behind the social network?\n\nOne of the things that's really changed in the existence of the internet is the power of word of mouth. It's much stronger than it used to be. Fifty years ago if you really liked something you might tell five people. Now through social means online you can tell three or four hundred people. What that means is that if you have a great brand and a story people want to tell, if you're supporting something that they care about, they will go out and share the word. Therefore you don't need to spend a huge amount on TV commercials and so forth.\n\nThe concept of the social network is instead of spending all that money on marketing or Super Bowl commercials, we spend it on a cause you care about and we ask you to tell your family and friends. The social network is designed for that -- it's ad-free and anyone is able to use it, you don't need to be a phone customer, it's a general interest social network for all kinds of purposes, but integral to it is the idea that you can raise money for whatever cause you are interested in so it's a donation platform as well, and we don't charge any commissions to the charity.\n\nHow do you go about convincing charities to invest time and money in using TPO, when their audience is on Twitter and Facebook in larger numbers?\n\nYour typical donation platform charges a commission to the charities for raising the money. That can be as high as 8 percent. We're not taking any commission whatsoever. There are bank fees that no one can do anything about but other than that it's something that we're offering for free, to the charities. The main reason is that we want them to give the platform time -- the more people on the platform the more powerful it becomes, and the more phone service we sell.\n\nFor charities, the real money often gets raised when movements 'go viral' -- it's an old fashioned word, but they often do arise out of the chaos of social media. Is that a model you want to replicate too?\n\nThat's absolutely right, and a big part of the design here is that any cause can participate on the platform. Users can do all sorts of things -- and some of those things we expect to come out of this are those you can't control, top down. You never think of these things in advance, they just begin to happen.\n\nIn terms of how do we get to critical mass? It's all about getting the message out there. This is a different business model for a social networking platform. We've built it with all of the modern tools to invite your friends, [and included] Facebook Connect to find your friends -- all of that makes it easier for people to move a part of their digital life here.\n\nAre there other social platforms you've looked at and thought 'we want to do things differently'?\n\nThe funny thing about me -- and I've said this for many years -- is I never really think about the competition. I just like to build cool things and I hope people like them. I think it's a mistake to define yourself against something.\n\nOne element of Twitter's early success was the presence of celebrities, and the chance to engage with them. There are already a few high profile people on TPO, is that something you want to grow?\n\nYes, definitely. That's a very important part of it. A lot of times people are using social media platforms to promote their causes but it's not integrated in any way, here we can say join us and as you're connecting with your fans and followers, you're also raising money.\n\nDo you accept that it's not always straightforwardly positive elements that engage people on social media -- arguments, debate, entertainment and tabloid news all have their place.\n\nThe vision I have is that it is absolutely part of the conversation. It's a general interest social networking platform. It's not a place to come and just talk about causes, though people can do that. It's really about a social space -- share photos, update your friends on your status, all those sorts of things.\n\nJon Ronson recently wrote a book on the idea that social media was established to give a voice to the voiceless, but as it's developed has become more reactive and negative. How do you look at that thesis in regard to your own network?\n\nIn terms of the social policies of the site we want to be really strong against that kind of hating, negativity, that sort of thing. For me, the premise of the book -- which, by the way, I have not read -- as you describe it doesn't ring true to me. I think maybe this guy needs to follow people or have better friends. I find social spaces online to generally be quite positive. Of course there is trending and bad behaviour out there, and you want to have all the right tools to block people and ban people from the platform if they are not behaving. But to me I'm an optimist about human nature from my Wikipedia experiences, I know there are huge numbers of good people out there. For every rare person who is negative there are 1,000 who are positive. Those are the ones you want to empower.\n\nWikipedia has been able to develop a tone which has defied many people's expectations about what would happen if you let a huge number of people edit an encyclopaedia. On social media that's also the case -- you have to create a tone of conversation out of something that could be uncontrollable and chaotic. What kind of things are you doing on the network that could steer that, or could create that sense of collective purpose which is evident on Wikipedia, but isn't always evident on Twitter?\n\nFor us the biggest component of that is the causes, and the cause-driven nature of the platform. There is a unified social purpose in the sense of saying, 'hey, instead of buying our phone service so we can buy super bowl commercials, we're going to support good causes in the world and tell your friends, tell your family'. That already gives it a purpose that you don't really have elsewhere. You have a reason to go and tell your friends and get on the platform and do positive things.\n\nAre you going to open up the site to more partners?\n\nFor our launch partners we've got a certain set who we are working with, and obviously we are looking to expand that. One of the interesting things here is we view this as a platform. The idea here is that it's not just the really big causes but the smaller causes too.\n\nIs there still space for a new social network on what sometimes feels like a very established landscape of Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and the rest?\n\nYeah -- otherwise we wouldn't be doing this. For me I think that the internet is still a place with great opportunities for innovation and change. I think there is an ongoing process of people coming to different understandings, [and] looking at different business models in this case. I'm impressed that at least once a year I hear about something new that has become big before I've noticed it. We're still having a lot of really cool innovation.\n\nThis interview was lightly edited for space and clarity.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
