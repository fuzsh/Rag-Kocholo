        "text": "Job: co-founder, Wikipedia; chairman, Wikimedia Foundation\n\nAge: 43\n\nIndustry: digital media\n\nStaff: 0 (Wikipedia), 47 (Wikimedia Foundation)\n\nNew entry\n\nJimmy Wales is the co-founder and driving force behind Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia that is edited by everyone. Well, potentially everyone, and only if you have an internet connection.\n\nDescribed by Google's co-founder Sergey Brin as \"one of the greatest triumphs of the internet\", Wikipedia democratised knowledge like nothing before it, creating an organic Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nEstablished by Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia now has 15m articles, more than 3.3m of them in English, all of them written and edited by volunteers around the world.\n\nRather than writing about Wales we could simply point you to his Wikipedia entry – but beware of using the website as a single source. Its great strength – that its articles can be written and updated by anyone – can also be its weakness, although inaccuracies, both accidental and deliberate, tend not to last for long.\n\nAlabama-born Wales, who made his fortune as a Chicago futures trader, described Wikipedia as a \"charitable humanitarian effort to create and distribute a free high quality encyclopedia to every single person on the planet\", one in which \"any reasonable person can join us in writing and editing entries on any topic\".\n\nWales said its success was a source of \"great humanitarian opportunity and hope\", a sign that \"genuine collaboration is possible, and comes natural to us\".\n\nThe site is funded entirely by donations and run as a charity by the non-profit-making Wikimedia Foundation. Donors have included Google, which gave it a $2m grant earlier this year.\n\nThe site has not been without controversy, including occasional personal vendettas and long-running spats between contributors with different ideologies.\n\nEarlier this year it also removed some images that could have been considered pornographic. It also faces a challenge from an apparent fall in the number of volunteers willing to write and edit the site.\n\nWales's previous online projects included Wikipedia's predecessor, Nupedia, and the male-orientated web portal Bomis."
