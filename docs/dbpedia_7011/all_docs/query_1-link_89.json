        "text": "We’re used to hearing lurid stories about the wealth and excess of silicon valley internet giants.\n\nWith that in mind, how much is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales worth? And what’s his background?\n\nThis internet entrepreneur’s net worth and lifestyle choices may surprise you.\n\nJimmy Wales, who is sometimes known as Jimbo, is surprisingly only worth $1 million (£751,800).\n\nThat’s a pretty modest pile compared to the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (£53.7 billion), Snapchat’s Evan Spiegal (£2.8 billion) or even MySpace founder Tom Anderson (£43.1m).\n\nAnd yet, at 51, he’s older than all of them.\n\nJimmy was born in 1966 in Huntsville, Alabama. His dad was a grocery store owner and his mum ran a small school.\n\nAs a youngster he became obsessed with the idea of creating the ultimate encyclopedia after pouring over his mother’s encyclopedia in bog standard book format.\n\nPutting this idea at the back of his brain, Jimmy went on to study Finance at university.\n\nIn 1996 he and two partners founded Bomis, an adult web portal featuring entertainment and adult content, which wasn’t hugely profitable but provided the initial funding for the peer-reviewed free encyclopedia, Nupedia.\n\nThat lasted until 2003 and its successor (launched in 2001) was Wikipedia. If you don’t know what Wikipedia is, just Wikipedia it.\n\nThe aim of the project, according to Wales, is: ‘Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.’\n\nDespite the fact everyone’s fave encyclopedia Wikipedia has now been going strong for 17 years, Jimmy – and co-founder Larry Sanger (£468,000) – are not as rich as Croesus.\n\nThat’s because it’s a non-profit site, and will remain so according to the tenets of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, which Jimmy oversees.\n\nHowever, Jimmy’s site-hosting platform Wiki is for-profit. He also tried to develop a search engine but it closed in 2009.\n\nJimmy has also worked as an adviser to such laudable bodies as the UK government. He also offered to help Ed Miliband with his social media campaigning but was turned down.\n\nHe currently lives in London with his wife of five years Kate Garvey, who is Tony Blair’s former diary secretary, and their two daughters.\n\nHe has been married three times, first to Pamela Green, and then secondly to Christine Rohan, with whom he has a daughter.\n\nMORE : What does DNA stand for?\n\nMORE : Where should I land in Fortnite Battle Royale?"
