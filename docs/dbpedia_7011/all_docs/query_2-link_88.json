        "text": "Jimmy Wales is the founder of Wikipedia, the world's largest free online encyclopedia. In its development, Wales created a community of volunteers who have published over 800,000 articles.\n\nI spoke with Wales in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nWhat was the origin of Wikipedia?\n\nAbout two years before I founded Wikipedia I had founded another project called Nupedia. It was based upon the same concept as Wikipedia, which was that it was a freely licensed encyclopedia that was written by volunteers.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't use the wiki software and it was a very top down model, which ultimately wasn't very successful. It was difficult to manage and when all was said and done, it wasn't very much fun for the volunteers. We found the Wiki editing software and began using that, which turned out to be quite a success.\n\nWhere did you first learn about the wiki software?\n\nAn employee of mine showed me a wiki he was working on. He mentioned that he knew we were having problems getting people involved in Nupedia and that it was a lot of trouble and a lot work for people. He suggested we give the wiki approach to open collaboration a try.\n\nAs wikis expand to more and more usages, where do you see the key limitations?\n\nThere are a few things that are going on within the wiki world. One of those is that people are really looking at making wiki editing easier. Part of the design philosophy of wikis is that the editing should be easier. This is in comparison to an HTML page. It isn't as easy as it should be, which is why we are starting to see services such as Wikiwig from SocialText. I also see people trying to expand into structured data and possibly into applications, rather than simple preformed text.\n\nWith its increasing ease of use, do you see wikis expanding their consumer appeal?\n\nThe mass market is clearly interested, as you can see from the large number of wikis that are popping up on a daily basis. Large consumer sites such as Wikipedia, Wikicities and others can definitely do a better job with the user experience.\n\nWith each new approach to consumer content, how does a company leverage this technology into a sustainable business model?\n\nThere are several companies within the space and basically there are two distinct models. One is the corporate enterprise wikis like SocialText and JotSpot. They are providing the software, consulting and support to corporations. There are then the consumer approaches, along the lines of Wikipedia and Wikicities. Wikipedia is funded by donations and Wikicities is supported by advertising.\n\nYou have a core group of submitters for Wikipedia, what will it take to grow this group?\n\nThat is an unknown at this point. For Wikipedia it is really important that we bring in all kinds of smart people, not just smart people that know how to edit wikis. It is important for improving our listings within areas such as fine arts, sciences, etc. I think that is one of the main ways to grow this group. There is a concern that if editing the site is made easier, whether it will bring unqualified people to the site. Personally, that is not a concern of mine.\n\nWikipedia is very well known for its involved core members, who refresh a page within minutes if it has been vandalized. What did you build into the site and the culture to attract this type of community?\n\nMostly it is the social structure and community that is available on the site. People are trusted, and can get involved. It is a pretty geeky hobby to write an encyclopedia for fun. I like to think that means that we are a pretty smart goup of people.\n\nWith Nupedia, we had gathered a large group of talented individuals who were simply frustrated by the software. When we started the Wiki, we were starting off with a large number of people, which was a tremendous advantage.\n\nThe adoption of the wiki software allowed you to scale your efforts.\n\nIt really unleashed the power of our volunteers."
