        "text": "Back in February 2020, Wikipedia Founder and internet pioneer, Jimmy Wales, joined me on the No Bullsh*t Leadership podcast. Jimmy Wales is one of the most influential leaders of the internet age and perhaps the most successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur not to become a billionaire.\n\nMost recently, Jimmy has been working on WikiTribune Social, a social site focussed on news without a paywall or advertising, offering quality news stories that the community are interested in and collaborate on.\n\nDuring the podcast we discussed everything from fake news, to leadership, to the role of failure in entrepreneurship. Here are my top take outs from our chat:\n\nThe importance of bringing people on board\n\nJimmy’s businesses are founded in the principals of a community. He explained that when leading a community of volunteers, you can’t just command people and expect the desired outcome, rather the effective leader brings people on board. Jimmy coaches business leaders with the same advice:\n\n\"…if you think ‘I’m going to tell people what to do and they have to do it because I pay them,’ then you’re going to be sorely disappointed because unless people genuinely want to do the thing, they have genuine buy in, yeah they’ll probably do it because they don’t want to get fired but they’re not going to be happy, they’re going to leave as soon as they can or they’re going to do what you demand in a half-hearted way.”\n\nTop-down, hierarchical leadership doesn’t work anymore. A top-down culture actively disincentivises the majority of people to act and think for themselves. A great leader should strive to create an environment that their people actively choose to be part of.\n\nOrganisational culture\n\nJimmy shared the importance of:\n\n“Trusting people. Training them so they have the capacity to deal with whatever comes up and then trusting them to just deal with it, it is the only way.”\n\nThe purpose of culture in a modern and ambitious organisation or team is to liberate your people to outperform those of your competitors. If your team thinks you are great news for their own personal ambition (whatever that might be), then that is the surest way to keep them motivated, growing, thriving and striving.\n\nThe role of failure in success\n\nIn Jimmy’s opinion, the stories of his failures, rather than his successes, are more interesting and more important in helping to understand how he got to where he is today. He encourages entrepreneurs to ‘Go out and try your thing and fail.’ Joking that the tag line he uses for his speech to young entrepreneurs is: ‘Failure. Jimmy Wales is good at it.’\n\nExploring the topic he said:\n\n“It’s a little embarrassing when a failure happens, but it’s more about saying if you want to innovate, unless you’re on the brink of failure in some sense, you’re probably not innovating. You’re not trying something new. If you’re trying something new and untested, obviously, you’re going to get it wrong sometimes and you’ll get it right sometimes as well.”\n\nPeriods of failure are inevitable and accepting this is a liberating state.\n\n“Every idea has its time.”\n\nAhead of Deliveroo, Jimmy created an internet food ordering delivering service, he built the website and went out to restaurants, but he couldn’t convince them, people weren’t ready for it. No matter how great the effort and how strong your skills, success is never guaranteed. But Jimmy doesn’t bemoan this, but again focuses on the growth:\n\n“One of the fantastic things about the Silicon Valley culture, which has its flaws of course … is the idea that if you try a start-up and it fails, it doesn’t mean your career is over and that you’re a loser. In fact, what it probably means is you’re too early, you’re too late, there’s always reasons and if you learn from it, you’re likely to get a second backing or get a fantastic job at Google or something like that.”\n\nTalk to anybody, in any walk of life, from authors and actors, to entrepreneurs and sports people, about how they made it and they will tell you first of the hardships, of the rejections, the late nights and much worse. Success and failure are equal and necessary parts of growing and learning.\n\nThe joy and pain of entrepreneurship\n\nJimmy shared the entrepreneurs dilemma of whether to persist or pivot:\n\n“So you hit a problem and you think ‘Should I stop doing this and go to something completely different or should I push through?’ And that’s the art of entrepreneurship, it's learning over time to recognise, as fast as you can: ‘Hey this is not working because I need to tweak this, that and the other.’ Or: ‘This is fundamentally a bad idea. This is never going to work, and I need to change completely.’ And you never know. In some ways that’s the joy of entrepreneurship and it is also the pain of entrepreneurship.”\n\nSometimes, the decisions we must make are huge. Yet in practice, many of the decisions we take are two-way doors. The biggest issues around decision making is our natural hesitancy to make mistakes. But getting stuff wrong isn’t failing, it is just getting one decision wrong, and it’s often not obvious what is right anyway. Ultimately, very few decisions are irreversible, so live by the motto: Try it. If it doesn’t work, fix it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason 2 of the No Bullsh*t Leadership podcast, brought to you by Intelligence Squared, is coming soon.
