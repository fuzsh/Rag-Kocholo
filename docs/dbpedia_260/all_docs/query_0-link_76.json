        "text": "USS Forrestal (CVA 59 / CV 59 / AVT 59):\n\nForrestal (CVA-59) was laid down on 14 June 1952 at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia; launched on 11 December 1954; sponsored by Josephine Forrestal, widow of Secretary Forrestal; and commissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 1 October 1955.\n\nChronology and Significant Events:\n\n1 Oct 1955: Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas, RADM Ingolf N. Kiland, Commandant of the Fifth Naval District, and W.E. Blewett, Jr., President of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, attended the ceremony when the ship hoisted aloft her commissioning pennant at 1430 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia; Captain Roy L. Johnson was the first commanding officer. The huge aircraft carriers of the Forrestal class were so large when compared to previous carriers that veterans referred to them as âsupercarriers.â Forrestal commissioned with four steam catapultsâtwo forward and two on her angled flight deckâenabling her to launch aircraft more rapidly. During the post-World War II period several developments prepared naval aviation to provide a credible nuclear deterrent against East Bloc expansion: building Forrestal, reducing the weight and dimensions of nuclear weapons, and developing aircraft capable of dropping them, including Douglas A-3 Skywarriors. From her home port in Norfolk, Virginia, Forrestal spent the first year of her commissioned service in intensive training operations off the Virginia capes and in the Caribbean. An important assignment became training aviators in the use of her advanced facilities, a duty on which she often operated out of Mayport, Florida.\n\nDec 1955âJan 1956: Helicopter Utility Squadron (HU)-2 Detachment 42 operated a pair of Piasecki (Vertol) UH-25B Retrievers on board for search and rescue purposes to winch survivors of downed aircraft out of the water. Meanwhile, a pair of McDonnell Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, one a night attack variant and the other an electronic warfare conversion, together with a couple of Beech TC-45J Kansans, also flew from the ship to qualify their pilots to operate from carriers. Just after the New Year Fighter Squadron (VF)-41 flew 11 McDonnell F-2C Banshees on board for carrier qualifications, joined by 14 Douglas A-1H Skyraiders and one Kansan from Attack Squadron (VA)-42 and 13 Vought F7U-3M Cutlassâ from VA-86. These became the first aircraft to operate from the carrier.\n\n3 Jan 1956: CDR Ralph L. Werner, commanding Air Task Group-1, made the first fixed wing aircraft landing on board Forrestal when he made three touch-and-go landings after which he made the first full-stop landing, in his North American F-1C Fury during the afternoon watch at about 1440. A few hours later he piloted the same aircraft to make the first catapult launch from the huge carrier. Meanwhile, CDR William M. Harnish, commanding officer of VF-21, made the second landing, also in a Fury, at approximately 1445. LT Vincent Darcey of the air group was the landing signal officer for both traps. Sailors painted both aircraft in the Navy's new white and gray 'atomic' paint scheme. The ship sailed to the east of Norfolk.\n\n24 Janâ28 Mar 1956: Forrestal completed her shakedown cruise in Caribbean waters, operating principally off GuantÃ¡namo Bay in Cuba.\n\n23â27 Apr 1956: The ship accomplished her final acceptance trials in Virginian waters.\n\n4 May 1956: The carrier entered the yard for repairs which included replacing her original propeller shafts. Forrestalâs Command History Report noted that completing this work âgreatly improved her performance.â\n\n29 Octâ12 Dec 1956: Worsening tensions in the Middle East erupted into Operation Kadesh, Israeli attacks against the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Suez Canal. The next day the British and French issued an ultimatum to the Israelis and Egyptians to pull their forces back 10 miles from either side of the vital waterway ââ¦to bring about the early cessation of hostilities and to safeguard the free passage of the canal.â The Israelis accepted the terms of the ultimatum but the Egyptians angrily refused to comply. ADM Arleigh A. Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, alerted the Sixth Fleet to standby to evacuate Americans stranded by the crisis in Haifa and Tel Aviv, Israel, Beirut, Lebanon, and Alexandria, Egypt. By 4 November, ships evacuated 1,702 people, naval helos took out 165 more and Air Force crews pulled 310 refugees from harmâs way, often during extremely perilous situations from gunfire, errant bombs or navigational hazards. Just as destroyer Strong (DD-758) arrived at Gaza and anchored 3,000 yards off the port to disembark 21 members of a UN truce inspection team, an Egyptian ammunition dump exploded, showering the area with molten fragments and debris. From their vantage point crewmembers also observed mortar and small arms fire as the Israelis and Egyptians fought over the strategic city, culminating in strafing and bombing runs by Israeli aircraft against Egyptian troops who refused to surrender. The sailors also witnessed the pitiable spectacle as the fighting forced hundreds of people to leave on foot, carrying their few belongings as they drove sheep and goats before them. Meanwhile, the Anglo-French ultimatum expired at 0430 on Halloween, and the two allies dispatched a huge expeditionary force that bombarded Egyptian forces across Egypt. At dawn on 5 November they began Operation Musketeer, landing commandoes, marines and specialized troops at key points along the strategic canal to prevent the Egyptians from closing it by sinking ships or laying mines. The fighting raged into the next day, when British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden announced a cease-fire notice to take effect at midnight of the 6th. Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed the creation of a UN peacekeeping force to separate the combatants, and a majority of that bodyâs members agreed to support his resolution. Orders directed a vast number of American ships to rendezvous and concentrate in Atlantic waters off east coast ports, including Forrestal, which put to sea from Mayport. Due to concerns over possible Soviet submarine attacks should the crisis escalate, CINCLANTFLT authorized ships proceeding independently to do so at high speed âconsistent with weather and sea conditions.â Ships set sail from various U.S. ports, arriving at holding areas and mustering ports as type commanders desired by 10 December. By 17 November, RADM Murr E. Arnold, Commander, Carrier Division 4 and Task Force 26, broke his flag from Forrestal in command of a powerful concentration of ships that rendezvoused near 36Â°30âN, 27Â°18â17âW, in the eastern Atlantic around the Azores Islands, also including; attack aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42), heavy cruiser Des Moines (CA-134), radar picket destroyers Charles P. Cecil (DDR-835), Corry (DDR-817), OâHare (DDR-889) and Stickell (DDR-888), destroyers Douglas H. Fox (DD-779), Healy (DD-672), John Hood (DD-655), Laffey (DD-724), Lowry (DD-770), Robinson (DD-562), Sigourney (DD-643) and Stormes (DD-780), store ship Rigel (AF-58) and oiler Severn (AO-61). Additional ships relieved some of these vessels during the following days to enable the original ships to take on fuel or achieve repairs. The carriers conducted air operations âas practicableâ to enhance their readiness, and utilized their aircraft to evaluate experiments determining the maximum air group loading for âexecuting war missionsâ as they maintained readiness to enter the Mediterranean should their presence be necessary. CINCLANTFLT tentatively scheduled attack aircraft carrier Lake Champlain (CVA-39) to relieve Franklin D. Roosevelt. Forrestal returned to Norfolk to prepare for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.\n\n15 Janâ22 Jul 1957: The ship made her first deployment to the Mediterranean. On this, as on her succeeding tours of duty in the Mediterranean, Forrestal visited many ports to allow dignitaries and the general public to come on board and view the tremendous power for peace she represented. For military observers, she staged underway demonstrations to illustrate her capacity to bring air power to and from the sea in military operations on any scale.\n\n2â3 Feb 1957: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar for the first time and entered Mediterranean waters. During this deployment she also conducted underway demonstration cruises for Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, and for Mohammad R. Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran.\n\n29 Marâ3 Apr 1957: Forrestal steamed off the Greek isle of Rhodes.\n\n5â7 Apr 1957: The ship appeared briefly off Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n17 Apr 1957: VADM Charles R. Brown, Commander, Sixth Fleet, escorted Sir Robert Laycock, the British Governor of Malta, and 26 other high ranking British government and military officials including VADM Durnford Slater, RN, RADM Geoffrey Brittian, RN, and RADM Lee Barber, RN, onto the ship to witness flight operations and aircraft demonstrations. The British officials visited as guests of RADM Arnold and CAPT William E. Ellis, the commanding officer of Forrestal, and VADM Brown arrived on board from his flagship, the heavy cruiser Salem (CA-139).\n\n24 Aprâ5 May 1957: A crisis occurred in the Middle East concerning rising pan-Arab nationalism, the withdrawal of European colonial powers and intrigues between Western and East Bloc factions, which threatened the throne of Jordanian King Hussein bin Talal (also known as King Hussein I). On the evening of the 25th Admiral Burke directed VADM Brown to deploy his forces to the eastern Mediterranean to ensure that the Jordanians maintained their independence and not be subverted from within or attacked from without. âOnce againâ explained VADM Brown in a message to all hands of the Sixth Fleet, âwe find ourselves dropping everything and rushing to the scene of the fire.â By the next day Forrestal, Lake Champlain, heavy cruisers Des Moines and Salem and their destroyers rendezvoused and proceeded eastward at best possible speed into the crisis. Crew members worked at a feverish pace to prepare for action and at 0705 on the 27th, VADM Brown reported that he could launch attack aircraft and fighters at âfirst light tomorrowâ should the emergency escalate. Concerns that they would have to evacuate Americans within the country prompted planning to deploy marines into the Jordanian capital of Amman as armed escorts while helicopters flying from Forrestal covered the evacuations. Meanwhile, amphibious forces made for Beirut, Lebanon, and upon arriving they stood ready to deploy additional troops and equipment ashore or to evacuate United States civilians. These two groups of ships continued to maintain station in the eastern Mediterranean until diplomats diffused the tension. âIn ten short daysâ VADM Brown told his men as they returned on the 5th, âfrom the time of our sudden departure for the eastern Mediterranean the striking fleet is back in Italian waters, for a NATO exercise which begins tonight. While everyone must be pleased to be back, I hope no one loses sight of the larger significance of what has happened. In the brief period of time we have successfully carried out an important national mission in the eastern Mediterranean and we have met an important NATO commitment in the central Mediterranean. The distance between the two assignments is about 1,500 miles as the crow flies. This performance has been a dramatic demonstration of the mobility and flexibility of the fleet and one in which all can be proud to have had a part.â\n\n13â14 Jul 1957: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic. Attack aircraft carrier Randolph (CVA-15) relieved Forrestal at the British dockyard and naval station at âThe Rockâ on 14 July.\n\n22 Jul 1957: Forrestal returned to Norfolk for exercises off the North Carolina coast in preparation for her first NATO exercise in the North Sea, Operation Strikeback.\n\n24 Julâ11 Aug 1957: The carrier completed work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n3 Sepâ22 Oct 1957: During Strikeback, Forrestal drilled in the highly important task of coordinating United States naval power with that of other NATO nations. Forrestal steamed off the Clyde River Estuary in Scotland (14â16 September) and visited Southampton in England (30 Septemberâ11 October). Observers estimated that as many as 65,000 people visited or viewed the ship at the latter port, including U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James John H. Whitney.\n\n20 Dec 1957â20 Feb 1958: Forrestalâs crew and shipyard workers accomplished repairs and upkeep at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n28 Marâ24 May 1958: The ship participated in a series of major fleet exercises off the North Carolina, Georgia and Florida coasts, as well as taking part in experimental flight operations. She also made a brief visit to Miami, Florida (19â21 May). During LantRaEx 1-58 in May, LTJGs Strang and Woods of VA-85 flew two A-1H Skyraiders from Forrestal as she steamed off the coast of Jacksonville nonstop to NAS North Island in California. They completed their flight normally flying at altitudes below 1,000 feet to demonstrate the low level and long range capabilities of their squadron, and then returned nonstop to the carrier two days later.\n\n11â17 Jul 1958: Rival Lebanese political and religious factions clashed resulting in rioting that threatened that Levantine country. Tensions produced a crisis when Muslims rebelled against the Lebanese government at the same time that Iraqi army officers overthrew the pro-Western Hashemite monarchy in a coup dâÃ©tat in Baghdad on 14 July. Lebanese President Camille Chamoun requested assistance from President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the latter initiated Operation Blue Bat on the following day, which included the Sixth Fleet and supporting Air Force and Army commands landing over 14,000 marines and soldiers at Beirut to restore order and protect Americans trapped in the fighting. During the crisis Forrestal operated in the eastern Atlantic to back-up naval operations in the Mediterranean, and to be ready to intervene if the crisis escalated. She sailed from Norfolk to embark CVG-10 at Mayport two days later, and then she patrolled the Atlantic until returning to Virginian waters when the crisis subsided and the Americans ultimately withdrew most troops from Lebanon.\n\n2 Sep 1958â12 Mar 1959: Setting sail from Norfolk at 0800 Forrestal began her second tour of duty in the Mediterranean as she combined a program of training, patrol, and participation in major exercises with ceremonial hospitality and public visiting. The A-4Bs of VA-12 became the first Skyhawks to deploy on board the ship.\n\n12 Sep 1958: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\n16â17 Sep 1958: Forrestal relieved attack aircraft carrier Saratoga (CVA-60) at Augusta Bay, Sicily.\n\n14â27 Oct 1958: The carrier encountered âa major failureâ of her No. 1 Catapult, however, and her crew and civilian technicians accomplished the extensive repairs while visiting Naples, Italy, the first time that they attempted such work outside of a shipyard. Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy led her guest list during this cruise.\n\n2 Dec 1958: RADM Roy L. Johnson relieved RADM Charles D. Griffin as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board Forrestal at Barcelona, Spain.\n\n18 Dec 1958â3 Jan 1959: The crew and civilian workers again accomplished extensive repairs to a catapult while visiting Naples, Italyâthis time to No. 2. The ship then led Task Force 60 in Operation Big Deal, a joint Second and Sixth Fleet exercise.\n\n1â2 Mar 1959: Franklin D. Roosevelt relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay at Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Islands.\n\n3â4 Mar 1959: Forrestal passed through the Strait of Gibraltar westbound.\n\n12 Mar 1959: Returning to Norfolk, Forrestal continued to train new aircrew, constantly maintaining her readiness for instant reaction to any demand for her services brought on by international events.\n\n28 Mar 1959: King Hussein I of Jordan visited the ship for a luncheon while she moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk.\n\n1 Apr 1959: Forrestal entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her first regular overhaul.\n\n30 Sepâ1 Oct 1959: Forrestal sortied to evade Hurricane Hannah as the storm swept toward the Virginia area with winds that peaked at 130 mph on 1 October, however, the hurricane turned to eastward and dropped to an extra tropical storm south of Iceland.\n\nNov 1959: The ship completed a weapons evaluation exercise with USAF pilots.\n\n14 Feb 1960: Forrestal relieved Saratoga at Pollensa Bay. Among the ports she subsequently visited usual to a Mediterranean deployment the ship put into Split, Yugoslavia, a port-of-call that generated heated controversy in the media due to the tensions still existing between the communists and the West.\n\n7 Mar 1960: The Bureau of Ships issued a report concerning the endurance of Forrestal and her sister ships, which stated in part that âConventionally powered Aircraft Carriers should have sufficient range and endurance to allow approach to the target, high-speed run-in, attack, retirement, and a sufficient amount of reserve fuel to replenish Escorts.â\n\n9 Sepâ22 Oct 1960: The carrier completed repairs and maintenance in drydock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n26 Oct 1960: RADM Forsyth Massey relieved RADM Robert E. Dixon as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board at Norfolk.\n\n21 Mar 1961: Archbishop Makarios III, President of Cyprus and ethnarch [national leader] of Greek Cypriots, visited the ship as the guest of VADM George W. Anderson, Jr., Commander, Sixth Fleet, and RADM Massey.\n\n9 Aug 1961: Secretary of the Navy John B. Connally visited the ship and spoke to the crew over her closed circuit television system, congratulating the men for achieving their second coveted Battle Efficiency âEâ award.\n\n25 Aug 1961: By the time Forrestal returned from her fourth deployment to the Mediterranean, CVG-8 amassed 26,000 flight hours, the equivalent of almost three years flying during less accelerated operations. In addition, the ship herself celebrated her 60,000th arrested landing. USMC LTV F-8 Crusaders from Marine Fighter Squadron (VMF)-333 also qualified for carrier operations on board Forrestal.\n\nSep 1961â13 Jan 1962: Forrestal completed work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n18 Janâlate Feb 1962: The ship accomplished a six-week refresher training cruise off the east coast that extended down into Caribbean waters, focusing upon the GuantÃ¡namo Bay area. She also visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In addition, Mercury-Atlas 6 [MA-6] launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 0947 on 20 February 1962. LCOL John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, the 40-year-old astronaut, completed three orbits about the earth in four hours 55 minutes to become the first American to orbit the planet. Glenn flew spacecraft Friendship 7 in her 75,679 mile voyage at a maximum speed of 17,544.1 miles per hour. Describing his re-entry as a âreal fireballâ Glenn splashed down in the Atlantic some 166 miles east of Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas, about 800 miles southeast of Bermuda. Destroyer Noa (DD-841) recovered the astronaut after he spent 21 minutes in the water, and a helo flew him on to antisubmarine warfare support aircraft carrier Randolph (CVS-15) at 1745. Although Glenn did not land nearby, Forrestal stood ready as one of the potential tracking and measuring stations for the epochal flight.\n\n9â14 Apr 1962: Forrestal combined operations with aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVAN-65) for a presidential cruise. President John F. Kennedy and his entourage arrived on board Enterprise on 14 April. The busy day included sea and air power demonstrations for the President and many distinguished guests, including most of his cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, many congressmen and about 30 foreign ambassadors, all hosted by VADM John M. Taylor, Commander, Second Fleet. About 20 ships participated in the exercise off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. A âspectacular displayâ culminating in a mass flyby and recovery by naval aircraft entertained guests. CDR Joseph P. Moorer, commanding officer of VF-62, LCDR Joseph S. Elmer, LT Richard C. Oliver and LT William F. Heiss of that squadron shook hands with President Kennedy on board Enterprise at the conclusion of the demonstration. Forrestal also hosted Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and several senators and congressmen during the cruise.\n\nMid to late Apr 1962: Following the Presidential Cruise, Forrestal returned to the Caribbean for the Atlantic Fleet exercise LantPhibEx 1-62, and took advantage of the opportunity to visit Port of Spain, Trinidad, where the Carrier Division 4 band entertained crowds.\n\nJul 1962: The ship visited New York City for Independence Day festivities. During one of the days of her week-long stay, almost 22,000 âcuriousâ visitors swarmed on board.\n\n6â12 Jul 1962: Leaving New York waters, Forrestal participated with Enterprise in LantFlex 2-62, a nuclear strike exercise under the command of RADM Reynold D. Hogle, Commander, Carrier Division 4 and Commander, TF 24. Enterprise launched eight âpre-plannedâ strikes and six call strikes while operating in the Virginia capes area against targets ranging from the Tidewater area to central Florida.\n\n3 Aug 1962: Forrestal weighed anchor and set sail for another Med deployment. This sail included 12,900 officers and men from commands along the east coast assigned initially to the Second Fleet, manning Enterprise and Forrestal, guided missile heavy cruiser Boston (CAG-1), from which RADM Robert H. Weeks, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 10, broke his flag, heavy cruiser Newport News (CA-148), from which VADM John M. Taylor, Commander, Second Fleet, broke his flag, 13 destroyers from Destroyer Squadrons 8 and 14, ammunition ships Shasta (AE-6) and Suribachi (AE-21) and oiler Chukawan (AO-100). This became the last time that A-1 Skyraiders of VA-85 deployed on board Forrestal, and her first deployment with Mach 2.2 capable McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs of VF-74. Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 [Tu-20] Bears would fly the huge journeyâhundreds of milesâfrom their fields near Murmansk in the Kola Peninsula to find the ship as she crossed the Atlantic. Russian electronic specialists operated their sophisticated sensors probing for the carrierâs radar, and when they discovered her they would drop down for a closer look, but Phantom IIs from the ship would intercept the intruders and escort them out of the area. Even during the tensions of the Cold War most of these encounters were professional and the rivals often waved to each other.\n\n13â17 Aug 1962: Forrestal participated in RipTide III, an exercise with allied aircraft carriers in the eastern Atlantic that demonstrated interchangeability, compatibility and reliance with NATO allies including the British, French and Portuguese.\n\n7 Sep 1962: Forrestal participated in Lafayette II, an exercise that involved 14 scheduled conventional strikes coordinated with aircraft from Enterprise against multiple targets to the French Low Level Route in southern France. French air force and naval aircraft opposed them.\n\n6 Oct 1962: NATO chiefs of staff embarked Forrestal for a one-day cruise.\n\n16â17 Feb 1963: Enterprise relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay.\n\n2 Mar 1963: Forrestal returned to Norfolk. Russian reconnaissance bombers overflew the carrier en route her return home. Her aircraft flew over 10,300 missions and logged over 23,000 hours in the air during this deployment.\n\nEarly-MayâMid-Jun 1963: The ship completed repairs and upkeep at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n9â19 Sep 1963: Forrestal and ships of Task Force 23 visited Boston, Massachusetts, for the annual convention of the East Coast Navy League. The ship moored at the South Boston Naval Annex on the 12th. The next day RADM John J. Hyland, Commander, Carrier Division 4, welcomed more than 400 delegates to the League and their families as they boarded his flagship for a dayâs cruise. The carrier stood out of the port on the 16th to return home.\n\n12 Oct 1963: RADM Samuel R. Brown, Jr., one of the shipâs former skippers, relieved RADM Hyland in hanger deck ceremonies.\n\n30 Oct, 21â22 Nov 1963: LT James H. Flatley, III, and LCDR Walter W. âSmokeyâ Stovall from the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and ADJ1 Ed Brennan, a flight engineer from Fleet Tactical Support Squadron (VR)-1, completed 29 touch-and-go landings and 21 full-stop landings and takeoffs in a Lockheed C-130F Hercules (BuNo 149798) on board Forrestal. Flatley and his crew, who also included at times Ted H. Limmer, Jr., a civilian safety test pilot from Lockheed-Marietta, made some minor modifications to the Herculesâwhich marines loaned to themâby replacing its standard C-130 antiskid braking system with the Hytrol Antiskid Braking System Mk II used in Boeing B-727s and by removing refueling pods from the wings. Crewmembers painted a white center line along the shipâs axial deck from bow to ramp to aid Flatley in guiding the huge aircraft. As they made their first landing on the 30th, surface winds of 25 to 30 knots and the resulting choppy sea caused moderate deck motion with a ânoticeableâ yaw, which forced Forrestal to increase speed an additional 10 knots to reduce the yaw motion and to stabilize wind direction. âI was up on the captainâs bridgeâ recalled Lockheed-Georgia Engineering Vice President Arthur E. Flock. âI watched a man on the shipâs bow and that bow must have gone up and down 30 feet.â Although the Hercules crew encountered 40 to 50 knot winds over the deck, their problems âconsiderably lessonedâ as they landed. The planeâs right wing tip cleared the shipâs island control tower by just under 15 feet as it roared down the flight deck. As Flatley brought the aircraft to a halt crewmembers gathered topside cheered their arrival, and many commented upon the message specially painted on the starboard nose of the fuselage for the occasion: âLook ma, no hook.â Lieutenant Flatley received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts. From these tests the Navy concluded that Herculesâ could carry 25,000 pounds of cargo and people approximately 2,500 miles and land on board a Forrestal-class or larger carrier, accomplishing their missions with gross weights of up to 121,000 pounds. Analysts also decided, however, that using the huge aircraft for Carrier On-board Delivery (COD) flights would be too risky.\n\n6â16 Nov 1963: In between the Hercules trials the ship engaged in various task force operations off the east coast.\n\n4â6 Dec 1963: Forrestal operated with Enterprise in StrikEx I, a combined strike, antisubmarine and air defense exercise conducted in the southeastern United States under Commander, Carrier Division 2.\n\n29 Jul 1964: The ship relieved Enterprise at Pollensa Bay, enabling the latter to rendezvous with guided missile cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) and guided missile frigate Bainbridge (DLGN-25) for Operation Sea Orbit, the first global circumnavigation by nuclear-powered ships.\n\n29 Nov 1964: LT John F. Barr of VA-83 made the 100,00th landing on board, in his A-4E Skyhawk as the ship steamed in the Mediterranean.\n\n1 Mar 1965: Attack aircraft carrier Shangri-La (CVA-38) relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay.\n\n11 May 1965: Miss America 1965 Vonda Kay Van Dyke, Miss Virginia 1965 Mary Montgomery, Miss Portsmouth 1965 and 13 contestants for the Miss Portsmouth crown visited the ship.\n\n21 Nov 1965: RADM Allan K. Fleming, Commander, Carrier Division 4, shifted his flag to Franklin D. Roosevelt at Golfo di Palmas, Sardinia.\n\n14â15 Jan 1966: An Air Force Douglas C-47 Dakota crashed up at 7,680 feet atop Mount Helmos in the Peloponnesian Peninsula in Greece. Later that evening the Sixth Fleet alerted two Kaman UH-2 Seasprite crews (BuNos 149741âan A modelâand 150142âa B) from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron (HC)-2 Detachment 59 embarked in Forrestal, to stand by to assist in the search and rescue. Helo crewmembers assigned included CDR Russellâa doctorâLCDRs Raymond K. McCullough and William S. Munro, LTs Mullenâalso a doctorâand L.R. Grant, II, LT(JG) Michael E. Howe, ADJ1 Ests P. Morrow, ADJ3 John E. Keto, AE3 Richard T. Ream and AMS3 George T. âD and Sâ Vaughn, III. Lieutenant Commander McCullough flew the âAâ Seasprite and LCDR Munro piloted the âB.â The men flew to the Royal Hellenic Air Force Base at Araxos overnight, lifting off from Forrestal at around 2000. After an Air Force captain briefed them on the weather and terrain conditions peculiar to the area, the rescuers set off at 0840 the next morning. Although they enjoyed clear weather, bitter cold, high winds up to 35 knots and dangerous turbulence at the mountain crest hampered the helo crews, who also needed to exercise caution while landing due to their concerns regarding the strength of the ice-crusted snow and whether it would bear their weight. LCDR McCullough persevered through six approaches and had to dump his fuel and auxiliary tanks to lighten the aircraft. He finally found a barely adequate landing spot on a saddle-back ridge a few hundred feet above the crash site where the snow leveled off just enough to allow him to touch down. They rescued two Air Force crewmembers from the wreckage, LCOL Dick N. Crowell, USAF, and CAPT Thomas D. Smith, USAF, and LCDR Munro and LT Grant flew in right behind them and pulled SSGT J.L. Ferguson out in a litter. All of the survivors suffered from frostbite and fatigue. The two crews refueled and returned to the scene and retrieved their crewmembers on the groundâwho disembarked to assist the victims to board the helosâand the bodies of the victims, returning with them to the base camp at 4,000 feet. The weather remained clear until later in the afternoon, when clouds and visibility closed in and caused problems. Because the atmospheric conditions caused their UHF radios to fail, the helo crews relied on a Grumman E-1B Tracer, known as a âWilly Fuddâ and âStoof With A Roofâ to its crew, from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW)-12, and AF 783, an Air Force plane, to relay communications between the rescuers and Forrestal. The Tracer also guided the helos to Araxos during the darkness as the operation began. In addition, an Air Force Kaman H-43 Huskie and Greek mountain climbers assisted the rescuers, and the Huskie evacuated LCOL Frank Bailey, USAF, the last survivor, as well as transporting the bodies down the mountain from the base camp. An Air Force Hercules waited for them at Araxos and when they returned the C-130 flew the casualties out for intensive medical care. Six other crewmembers perished during the crash, and the searchers could not locate two of the bodies due to the extreme circumstances of the crash site.\n\n24 Jan 1966: Forrestal sailed from Taranto, Italy, and in company with guided missile destroyer Conyngham (DDG 17) and destroyers Forrest Royal (DD 872), McCaffery (DD 860), Charles R. Ware (DD 865) and Yarnall (DD 541) comprised Task Group 60.2.\n\n2 Feb 1966: Early in the evening Backwash 100, an F-4B Phantom II, (BuNo 152285), LT William H. Brinks and LT Edward E. Weller of VF-74, launched for a routine night intercept training mission while Forrestal steamed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, at 1802. As 100 climbed through 1,500 feet with both engines at full thrust, a âloud explosionâ shook the aircraft. The Phantom II immediately began to decelerate, though it finished its climb to 2,200 feet before descending inexorably back to earth. Both men checked their instruments, however, they could not regain control of the F-4B and they ejected, approximately three miles from the ship. A UH-2A crew from HC-2 Detachment 59, LT(JG) Howe, LT Louis R. Grant, AME3 Gary Steele and ATN3 Bill Toth, spotted the survivors within four minutes, thanks largely to the flares and strobe lights which the aircrew deployed fortuitously, and rescued the pilot and radar intercept officer and returned the shaken men to the ship.\n\n5â12 Feb 1966: While Forrestal visited Naples a group of men from the ship attended an audience with Pope Paul VI at Vatican City in Rome.\n\n26â27 Feb 1966: Spanish LGEN Avales, that countryâs air defense force commander, visited Forrestal for an underway orientation.\n\n28 Febâ3 Mar 1966: The ship participated in Fairgame IV, a joint exercise with the French, including their aircraft carrier Arromanches (R-95), in the Mediterranean. RADM Leslie J. OâBrien, Jr., Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 10, transferred over to guided missile frigate MacDonough (DLG-8) on the last day of Fairgame IV, from which he broke his flag until returning to the carrier.\n\n22 Mar 1966: Forrestal put into Taranto for a fleet commanderâs conference with the Sixth Fleet. Officers and men from numerous commands arrived on board attack aircraft carrier America (CVA-66).\n\n30â31 Mar 1966: Saratoga relieved Forrestal at Pollensa Bay. The next day the latter passed through the Strait of Gibraltar beginning at 2100 on 31 March into the Atlantic en route her home port. The ship completed a deployment that the Navy extended by an additional two weeks. During this deployment, pilots logged 19,000 flight hours and flew over 11,000 sorties.\n\n11â14 Apr 1966: Forrestal offloaded her ammunition prior to entering Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.\n\n15 Apr 1966â27 Jan 1967: Forrestal sailed up the Elizabeth River as tugboats then eased her into her berth to prepare for what the shipâs Command History Report referred to as a âmassive faceliftingâ at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Vice Admiral Charles T. Booth, II, Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet, inspected the ship on 10 June 1966. The admiral took the opportunity to award CDR Joe D. Adkins, the shipâs air operations officer, the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery while flying missions over North Vietnam as the commanding officer of VA-72, embarked in attack aircraft carrier Independence (CVA-62). Forrestal completed about one-third of the overhaul when she floated from drydock on 10 July. Beginning on 1 August sailors and civilian technicians commenced installing the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) into the shipâs systems. The NTDS, an automatic combat direction system designed to eliminate human error by doing away with âgrease-pencil plotting,â became the principal system of her Combat Information Center. The speed of modern warfare demanded an increase in plotting and disseminating information and the Navy intended NTDS to provide a comprehensive picture of ships, aircraft and subs. Meanwhile, RADM Harvey P. Lanham, Commander, Carrier Division 2, shifted his flag to Forrestal, which relieved Carrier Division 4 (19 October). The admiral awarded LCDR Richard T. Theriault, Forrestalâs First Lieutenant, with the Bronze Star for his distinguished service in Vietnam, on 28 October. The crew celebrated their gradual return to operational status when they lit-off one of their eight boilers on Halloween, which provided the men their own steam and electrical power after receiving pierside services after seven months. Tragedy struck the men at the shipyard at 1333 on 1 November, however, when a UH-2B (BuNo 152193) from amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal (LPH-7), moored across from Forrestal at Berth 35 at Pier 5, crashed onto the pier between the two ships. The Seasprite entered what investigators determined to be an âuncontrolled flight immediately upon liftingâ off from the flight deck of Guadalcanal for a brief test âhopâ to NAS Oceana; after barely reaching four to five feet into the air the heloâs rotor blades struck the flight deck and then the aircraft careened over the starboard side of Guadalcanal onto the pier. The Seaspriteâs impact threw debris and shardsâincluding lethal metal fragments from the heloâs disintegrating rotor bladesâat people working in the vicinity, killing four men: three Navy; LCDR John C. Thoma, AN Joseph A. Anzalone, AN Garry A. Whipp; and one civilian, Mannie McCutcheon of the yardâs riggers and laborers shop, and injured 19 more men. Debris also flew into a railroad car on the pier and at both ships, damaging a pair of boats on the flight deck of Forrestal, and hurtled into nearby buildings with such force that they tore holes into cement block walls. Forrestalâs crew joined other men from across the yard to help their shipmates to provide damage control and to aid victims, and over 100 crewmembers volunteered to donate blood to injured men. Following the catastrophe, the crew held a âfast cruiseââwhich simulates at sea operations while still moored to a pier (10â11 December). Just after the New Yearâs the ship stood down the channel for the first time since her overhaul began for post repair trials off the Virginia capes (0800 on 9â15 January 1967). The ship actually completed her trials, which included limited air operations, at 1300 on Saturday 14 January, however, dense fog rolled in and the shipyard refused the carrier permission to moor due to navigational hazards, so the carrier anchored off Pier 12 at the naval station until the next day, when the shipyard allowed her to return. Forrestal sailed from the yard on the 23rd and returned to Norfolk.\n\n6â10 Feb 1967: The carrier reached the ammunition anchorage to load a full complement of ammunition for the first time since her repairs.\n\n14 Febâ16 Mar 1967: The ship completed refresher training in Cuban waters. Forrestal anchored out at NS GuantÃ¡namo Bay (17â18 February). She attained her 120,000th arrested landing on the third day of actual refresher training (22 February).\n\n11 Aprâ6 May 1967: Forrestal completed a series of exercises in the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range designed to simulate the grueling conditions her men could expect during the Vietnam War, including alpha strikes against major targets. In addition, she took part in Operation Clovehitch III, providing support for ground forces in the all-service exercise.\n\n13 May 1967: While testing her automatic carrier landing system off the Virginia Capes the ship recorded her 124,000th landing using that system, when LT Howard L. Reedy of VA-65 trapped on board.\n\n6 Jun 1967: Embarking CVW-17 the ship sailed at 1630 from Pier 12 at Norfolk for her only western Pacific deployment. Forrestal held drills on most days while sailing into harmâs way and pilots and aircrew studied charts and held briefings during the voyage. Grumman A-6As of VA-65 and Grumman E-2As from VAW-123 embarked as the first Intruders and Hawkeyes, respectively, to deploy on board Forrestal.\n\n13â16 Jun 1967: RADM Lanham and observers from Independence led the shipâs Operational Readiness Inspection.\n\n19â20 Jun 1967: Forrestalâs Command History Report observed that 4,330 pollywogs âfearing for their livesâ revolted and held 500 Loyal Shellbacks captive.â Just after midnight the pollywogs stole many of the shellbackâs cards and held a mock initiation during an âillegal ceremony.â The next day as the ship crossed the equator, however, the shellbacks gained their justice against the âdisloyal and scurvy Pollywogs,â many of the latter sans hair and sporting red tails.\n\n23â25 Jun 1967: While rounding South America en route to Pacific waters Forrestal anchored at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The air wing presented an air show for distinguished visitors including United States Ambassador John W. Tuthill and Brazilian ADM Rademaker, Minister of that Navy, during the morning watch on 23 June, following which the ship anchored in Guanabara Bay, at 1300.\n\n16 Jul 1967: Detachment Charles, a briefing team which flew out from the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, boarded to brief the men on the war they entered.\n\n18â21 Jul 1967: At 0530 the ship moored to Leyte Pier at NAS Cubi Point, at Subic Bay, Philippines. The wing examined survival gear and conducted survival training, installed additional electronic countermeasures equipment and made final aircraft modifications before entering battle.\n\n22 Jul 1967: Forrestal sailed from Subic Bay into war. RADM Lanham broke his flag from the carrier in command of Task Group 77.6, which also included destroyers Henry W. Tucker (DD-875) and Rupertus (DD-851). Aircraft practiced night operations, coordinated attacks and honed bombing accuracy while en route to Vietnamese waters.\n\n25 Jul 1967: Forrestal arrived at Yankee Station and at 0600 she launched her first strikes in the Vietnam War against an enemy often just a few miles over the horizon from the ship. The Americans created two carrier operating areas to prosecute the war in Southeast Asia. Initially designating the northernmost one in the Gulf of Tonkin as Point Yankee, they redesignated it Yankee Station as the primary operations area from which carriers operated against North Vietnam. Evolving as the war continued, Yankee Station actually consisted of several stations. In April 1966, the Navy moved it northward to 125 miles east of Dong Hoi at 17Âº30âN, 108Âº30âE, which reduced the distance aircraft had to fly to reach their targets in North Vietnam, but subsequently reassigned it to its original position in 1968. When the Americans resumed intensive bombing against the north in 1972 they again moved the station northward, and designated it as North, Mid and South, at 19Âº, 17Âº and 16Âº N, respectively. The carrier rearmed from ammunition ship Diamond Head (AE-19) later that evening.\n\n25â29 Jul 1967: The North Vietnamese supplied communist forces fighting in South Vietnam through a variety of well-defended and highly secretive routes collectively known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. To cut these routes pilots flew alpha strikes, reconnaissance, armed reconnaissance and barrier combat air patrol missions against key transportation nodes and supply points supporting the trail, as well as flying radar patrols, from Forrestal as she steamed in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although many of their targets lay within heavily defended areas bristling with North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gunners and surface-to-air missiles, CVW-17 flew more than 150 missions over North Vietnam without losing a single aircraft. Their most significant strike became a massive raid against the Thanh Hoa Bridge Railroad Bypass and Ferry Terminals.\n\n29â30 Jul 1967: Forrestal spent barely five days âon the lineâ when tragedy struck on Saturday. SN K. Dyke of 1st Division fell overboard over the starboard side at 0316. The ship immediately stopped and backed-up 1/3, then maneuvered slowly in the area searching for SN Dyke. At the same time she launched a helo to scour the area, which spotted the man and directed Rupertus to him, which lowered a motor whaleboat to recover the shaken man, the carrier securing from her man overboard orders by 0513. The ship then launched her first strike of the day. Shortly thereafter during the morning watch Forrestal swung her bow into the wind and the crew prepared to launch their second strike as the ship steamed 050Â° at 27 knots about 150 miles off the North Vietnamese coast, at approximately 19Â°9â5âN, 107Â°23â5âE, at 1050; she began an âearly launchâ of two Douglas KA-3B Skywarrior tankers from Heavy Attack Squadron (VAH)-10 Detachment 59, a Grumman E-2A Hawkeye from VAW-123 and a Grumman EA-1 Tracer. Two of the four aircraft launched when suddenly, a Zuni 5â rocket accidentally fired, probably from Aircraft No. 110, a McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II (BuNo 153061), LCDR James E. Bangert and LT(JG) Lawrence E. McKay from VF-11, and slammed into either Aircraft No. 405 or 416, an A-4E Skyhawk, further aft on the port side waiting to launch, less than two minutes later. Within five seconds, the fire, fed by a ruptured 400-gallon fuel tank, rapidly enveloped the Skyhawks on either side of the wounded aircraft. Barely two minutes into the unfolding holocaust the first of many high and low level detonations erupted as the heat started to cook-off bombs, rockets and 20 mm rounds. An explosion shattered the windows of Primary Flight Control, almost bowling CDR David B. Lember over. Rockets and shells shot across the deck, and ejection seats fired into the air. Seven major explosions shook the ship during the first four minutes of the horrific crisis, and some 40,000-gallons of JP-5 jet fuel from aircraft on deck spread the inferno. Huge clouds of black smoke billowed upward, blinding crewmembers racing to battle the flames, which engulfed the fantail and spread to below deck on the 01, 02 and 03 levels, touching off ordnance, trapping some men and wreaking havoc with the crew and ship. Survivors attested to bombs that appeared to be growing red from the heat dropping to the flight deck and blasting holes into the ship. More ruptured fuel tanks spewed volatile jet fuel from beneath aircraft onto the deck, feeding the flames. Some of the liquid sloshed down into the hanger deck where it posed a deadly hazard for men stationed there. Huge gusts of fire shot into the air along the flight deck, trapping pilots in their aircraft with no recourse but to escape through the flames or be incinerated in their cockpits. LCDR Fred D. White, waiting to launch in Aircraft No. 405, leapt out of his Skyhawk. Other men came to his aid but as the first bomb exploded it killed the pilot. LCDR Herbert A. Hope of VA-46 (and operations officer of CVW-17) jumped out of the cockpit of his Skyhawk between explosions, rolled off the flight deck and into a safety net. Making his way down below to the hanger deck, he gallantly took command of a firefighting team. âThe port quarter of the flight deck where I wasâ he recalled, âis no longer there.â LCDR John S. McCain, III, sitting in Aircraft No. 416 preparing to launch, afterward described the horror: âI thought my aircraft explodedâ he recounted as the first blast ripped through the aircraft assembled on the flight deck. âFlames were everywhereâ. The young pilot climbed out of his Skyhawk, poised perilously on the A-4C and then leapt through the flames and ran for his life. As he did so the naval aviator saw another pilot jump and roll clear of his aircraft but the flames caught his uniform ablaze. LCDR McCain turned back to help the man when a bomb exploded and knocked him off his feet and backward about 10 feet. He never saw his shipmate again. The son of the famed pioneering admiral in naval aviation, LCDR McCain would survive being shot down and held as a prisoner of war by the North Vietnamese (1967 through 1973); he eventually received the Distinguished Flying Cross, Silver Star and Purple Heart, and went on to a prominent political career. Nearby LT(JG) Lee V. Twyford also ran in to help a couple of men play a hose onto the conflagration as the detonation bowled him over. Climbing to his feet he saw the hose torn and spilling water over the deck, both men struck down saving their ship. Another man stumbled by LT(JG) Twyford. âHe had no clothes, he had no skinâ explained the lieutenant. Wounded in his ankle and unable to walk, he crawled below to lend a hand among sailors and marines gathering there. A burst of flames which AE3 Bruce Mulligan of VA-106 described as a âfireballâ hurtled toward the crewman, who hit the deck and barely survived as it roared over him. Looking around he spotted two men rolling over on fire, and several near him began to tear at their uniforms in fear and pain as their fabric ignited. As he prepared to help his friends a second explosion knocked him down, and the sailor found himself literally by himself. Undaunted, the young (22-year-old) petty officer headed for a fire hose when fragments flew into him. Nonetheless, AE3 Mulligan helped a friend wounded in the leg down to Sick Bay, and returned to help battle the blaze. Twice more he made his way below to rest, at one point noting that he felt âkinda groggy,â but returned to help his fellows. AE3 Mulligan passed out the second time but a friend brought him topside, where he finally collapsed from exhaustion later that evening, trying to sleep on a life preserver he used as a pillow up on the flight deck, though only resting fitfully. When a chief ran from burning Hanger Bay No. 3 to call for five volunteers, 30 men joined him to attack the raging fires. LT James J. Campbell recoiled for a few moments in stunned dismay as burning torches tumbled toward him, until their screams awoke him to the peril of his shipmates enveloped in flames and he leapt into action to help them. Repeated explosions blew some men overboard, and others made the deadly leap from the flight deck high above the cooling waters below to escape the inferno. Within the first minute the crew had two hoses on deck, and with the crash and salvage officer and chief directing their efforts, already began to ply one of the lines to battle down the flames; mute testimony to their determination to save their ship. Nonetheless, the first bomb explosions hurtled fire and molten fragments into the hose teams, shredding skin and cutting down the men, which temporarily drove back the firefighters moving toward the scene on the flight deck and cost the crew precious minutes as their shipmates bravely advanced into the fray to take their places. Sailors resolutely manned firefighting equipment and played water upon live ordnance to chill it while others braved the flames to disarm bombs and missiles or roll them overboard, and others moved aircraft forward and out of danger. Men frantically jettisoned ordnance from the âbomb farmâ located on the ramp outboard of the island, as well as from the hanger bay and on loaded aircraft, as the fire began to move up the starboard side aft through the row of parked North American RA-5C Vigilantes from Reconnaissance Attack Squadron (RVAH)-11. Fear and the urgency of their emergency produced superhuman strength in some men, and survivors recalled seeing 130-pound LT Otis G. Kight single-handedly carry a 250-pound bomb to the edge of the hanger deck and heave it overboard! LT John E. Carpenter of VA-106 escaped from his aircraft only to discover a man lying on the flight deck with severe arterial bleeding. The pilot remained alongside his shipmate applying a tourniquet to staunch the flow of the precious fluid while bombs and rockets exploded around him, until a corpsman arrived and took over his life-saving efforts. Throughout the day the shipâs medical staff appeared in the midst of fire and smoke to sacrificially assist their comrades. HM2 Paul Streetman, one of 38 corpsmen assigned to the carrier, spent over 11 grueling hours on the mangled flight deck tending to his shipmates. Investigators noted that survivors recalled that ADJ3 James G. Smith âseemed to be everywhereââthrowing bombs over the side, manning hoses in the hanger bay, carrying the wounded out of the 03 level, and at one point hauling a man so badly burned that no one wanted to touch him to first aid, an action that probably saved the wounded manâs life. ABH3 Larry W. Cope of V-1 Division jumped up onto a forklift and completely disregarding his own safety persisted in pushing a Vigilante over the side while flames surrounded him. His shipmates watered him down with a constant stream from a hose while ABH3 Cope persevered through his ordeal. âI am most proudâ CAPT John K. Beling observed âof the way the crew reacted.â At 1117 the ship passed over her 1MC that all men trapped aft by the flames should try to make their way forward via the hanger deck and second deck levels. Beginning at noon the radar systems failed for four crucial minutes, though operators assiduously restored them. SN Milton Parker of S-6 Division fought the fires topside for nine hours, and discovered that the heat of the charred deck literally burned the soles off of his shoes, but commented that âmy feet are okay because I put on some flight deck shoes and went back in.â Down in Hanger Bay No. 2, SFC Daniel H. Ringer of R Division joined a team that could not open the hanger bay doors and had to first cool them down, finally going through the side. At one point they applied salt water to a bulkhead only to watch in dismay as the water turned to steam from the intense heat. The chief made his way up to the flight deck and gathered some men to cut their way through with torches. He finally grabbed some sleep by 1100 on Sunday, but he awoke five hours later to note that fire still re-flashed. âThe majority of the men were all rightâ remembered SFC Ringer. âThere was no trouble in getting them to fight the fire. Most of them were eager to help in any way they could.â The heat, however, became unbearable for many men, and without proper protection some suffered frightful burns as fire ignited their uniforms or literally melted material onto their skin. RADM Lanham reached the bridge and gazed down in horror at the carnage below, noting that the firestorm engulfed the aft end of the flight deck and that men fought to halt the inferno from moving forward. A bosun grabbed his arm and pulled him down, mentioning that the Plexiglas would not be safe. âAs I dropped downâ reflected the admiral, âanother explosion shook the ship. A large piece of shrapnel crashed through the plexiglass where my face was.â CDR John R. Dewenter, Commander, CVW-17, proudly noted that most of his men âchipped right inâ and fought alongside Forrestalâs crew. LTJG Francis R. Guinan observed: âNo one had better say to me that American youth are lazy. I saw men working today who were not only injured, but thoroughly exhausted and they had to be carried away. They were trying so hard to help, but were actually becoming a burden.â Different men reacted to the stress in different ways and the fires trapped 13 sailors in compartment 1-217-4-Q port side aft. As they tried to escape via an alternative door blasts and flying objects forced them back within, and some men bravely attempted to rally their shipmates and seek a way out, while others prayed and still others wept or struggled with their fears. The men finally stumbled over aircraft and yellow equipment and escaped from the hatch near the shop on the hanger deck. The smoke became so thick that even with a few flashlights they could not see more then a couple of feet in front of them and some sailors became separated in the confusion. The large number of casualties quickly overwhelmed the shipâs Sick Bay staff, who worked diligently to treat the ghastly wounds which the disaster inflicted. Meanwhile, the stricken ship signaled her attendant destroyers, Henry W. Tucker and Rupertusâthe latter acting as her plane guardâto âClose to assist at best speed.â Rupertus raced in and her men valiantly played hoses onto the fire, staunchly keeping close aboard to Forrestalâs starboard side, although flames lapped out at them and smoke rapidly enveloped the destroyer. Other ships and aircraft came to the rescue. Destroyer George K. MacKenzie (DD-836) steamed eight miles away as one of attack aircraft carrier Oriskanyâs (CVA-34) plane guards when a lookout spotted the smoke, which her historian described as rising up âhundreds of feet into the air,â from the wounded ship, at about 1100. Oriskany and George K. MacKenzie gathered destroyer Samuel N. Moore (DD-747) and all three ships sped to the scene. George K. MacKenzie recovered three men from the water and took another trio on board from Rupertusâ motor whaleboat, before the destroyer took station on Forrestalâs starboard quarter. The destroyerâs busy crew also directed Samuel N. Moore to pick up a further 11 survivors they spotted in the water. For almost an hour and a half George K. MacKenzieâs firefighting parties sprayed the carrier with as many hoses as they could bring to bear. Henry W. Tucker retraced Forrestalâs route searching for survivors floundering in the water. A Kaman UH-2A Seasprite, ENS Leonard M. Eiland, Jr., ADJ3 James O. James, Jr., and AN Albert E. Barrows of HC-1 Detachment Golf embarked in Oriskanyâbut flying as an additional plane guard for Forrestalâpicked up five men from the water in the first hour alone, and later flew other men to sick bays of nearby ships. Helos from attack aircraft carriers Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) and Oriskany and from the Da Nang area of South Vietnam also raced in to help. Firefighters discovered to their horror that they used their available oxygen breathing apparatuses quickly, but helos from the carriers dropped-off additional apparatuses and canisters to enable men to continue the fight. Antisubmarine warfare support aircraft carrier Intrepid (CVS-11), embarking CVW-10, learned of the fire while en route to Yankee Station from Japanese waters, and she arrived alongside of Forrestal later in the day. Men from Intrepid transferred fog-foam to the smoldering carrier by helos, and sent a medical team over to Oriskany to assist her crew with treating casualties. Explosive ordnance disposal sailors carefully defused unexploded bombs. When LT(JG) Robert P. Cates, the shipâs explosive ordnance demolition officer, noted two bombsâa 500 and a 750 pounderâstill smoking in the midst of the flight deck, he disregarded the danger, resolutely walked over to them, defused the bombs and worked with other men to jettison them overboard. The sailors and marines who survived brought the flames under control on the flight deck by 1215, although they continued to clear smoke and to cool hot steel on the 02 and 03 levels until they reported all fires under control by 1342, and finally declared the fire defeated at 0400 the next morning, due to additional flare-ups. Crewmembers searched through smoky or flooded compartments below deck for their fallen friends. Some 132 officers and men died in the catastrophe, two disappeared (missing, presumed dead), and another 62 suffered injuries. Sixteen ANM-65 1,000, four M-117 750 and eight Mk-82 500 pound bombs ripped seven frightful holes through the armored flight deck, and scorches from the intense heat marked the flight deck, while melted and twisted debris and wreckage choked the area. Twenty-one aircraft also sustained enough damage from fire, explosions and salt water to be stricken from naval inventory, including: seven Phantom IIs (BuNos 153046, 153054, 153060, 153061, 153066, 153069 and 153912); eleven A-4E Skyhawks (149996, 150064, 150068, 150084, 150115, 150118, 150129, 152018, 152024, 152036 and 152040); and three Vigilantes (148932, 149282 and 149305). The crew fought back heroically, however, the men compounded errors due to their lack of intensive firefighting training, and on at least one instance a team beat the fire by laying down a protective covering of foam, only to have a second (well intentioned) team follow them up and wash it away with water, with the flames leaping up almost immediately again and cutting the sailors off. The Navy circulated the lessons which the men of Forrestal re-learned at such cost throughout the Fleet, and the flight deck film of the flight operations, subsequently entitled Learn Or Burn, became mandatory viewing for fire fighting trainees for years. Although investigators could not identify the exact chain of events behind the carnage, they revealed potential maintenance issues including concerns in circuitry (stray voltage) associated with LAU-10 rocket launchers and Zunis, as well as the age of the 1,000 pound âfat bombsâ loaded for the strike, shards from one of which dated it originally to the Korean War in 1953. The fire also revealed that Forrestal required a heavy duty, armored forklift to jettison aircraft more efficiently, particularly heavier types such as Vigilantes. Investigators did, however, absolve LCDR Bangert and LT(JG) McKay of any errors and noted their exemplary service prior to the catastrophe. Henry W. Tucker escorted Forrestal to rendezvous with hospital ship Repose (AH-16) at 2054, allowing the crew to begin transferring their dead and wounded shipmates at 2253. Shortly thereafter destroyer Bausell (DD-845) also reached the carrier to help.\n\n30 Jul 1967: âI donât apologize for my inability to talk to you quite clearlyâ explained LCDR Geoffrey E. Gaugham, a Benedictine chaplain who held mass on board Forrestal in a cluttered hanger at noon. âI was self-contained about this tragedy until I heard confessions this morning. Your emotions became my emotions. We must pray for the dead amongst us, and pray also that we deserve to have lived.â Crewmembers finished transferring their stricken comrades over to Repose at 0220, which allowed the hospital ship to detach at 1410, however, the carrier continued to suffer several brief flash fires, though without casualties. Meanwhile, Intrepid served as host ship for media representatives and VIPs flown out to the scene during the day.\n\n31 Julâ11 Aug 1967: During murky skies laden with monsoon rains Forrestal somberly moored at Subic Bay on the evening of the 31st to make emergency repairs, however, a minor blaze erupted briefly during her navigation and sea and anchor details. As the crew manned the rails and edged the carrier closer in toward Leyte Pier, a fire broke out among a pile of still smoldering mattresses. Some men stepped away from their stations to respond and quickly extinguished the fire without casualties, though with little of the urgency they displayed during the previous disaster. âTheyâre probably immune to it by nowâ mused an officer standing on the pier concerning the reactions of the weary crew, as the fire alarm announcement over the 1MC became clearly audible to people waiting ashore. The damage from the main fire proved to be beyond the means of the facilities there to repair, and the ship continued on to the United States to heal from her wounds. Meanwhile, Henry W. Tucker faithfully shepherded Forrestal to the area and then detached to escort attack aircraft carrier Constellation (CVA-64) toward Vietnamese waters, and Intrepid relieved Forrestalâs place on the line at Yankee Station. Skywarriors from VAH-10 Detachment 59 flew back to NAS Whidbey Island in Washington for immediate redeployment, and Grumman A-6A Intruders from VA-65 transferred to VA-196 embarking Constellation. About 450 relatives and friends of men on board Forrestal attended an inter-faith memorial service at the Chapel of the Good Shepherd at NAS Oceana, on 3 August. As the people left the chapel 16 jets from CVW-17 flew overhead to honor their fallen shipmates. The Navy later dedicated its Farrier Fire Fighting School Learning Site at Norfolk for ABC Gerald W. Farrier, who made the ultimate sacrifice for his fellow crewmembers that terrible day. As the fire erupted the chief grabbed a CO2 bottle and courageously rushed past stunned crewmembers toward the burning aircraft, but the initial explosions killed him instantly.\n\n12â13 Sep 1967: Forrestal returned to the United States when she sailed up the St. Johnâs River and arrived at NS Mayport at 1830. The ship unloaded aircraft and the crews of squadrons based in Florida, before continuing on at 1300 the next day for Virginian waters. CAPT Beling ordered speed increased to an average of 27 knots to enable the carrier to reach home and loved ones as planned.\n\n14 Sep 1967: As the ship hove into sight during the afternoon watch over 3,000 family members and friends gathered on Pier 12 and on board Randolph, Forrestalâs host ship, burst into frenzied cheering to welcome home their loved ones to Norfolk following the tragic deployment.\n\n19 Sep 1967â8 Apr 1968: Forrestal completed extensive repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. She entered Drydock No. 8 (21 September 1967â10 February 1968). While in the yard the crew manned their battle stations for general quarters drills every other Friday morning, and over 1,000 men attended the five-day dual firefighting and damage control course at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Pennsylvania. The ship floated from drydock and shifted to Berths 42 and 43 in front of the drydock to complete repairs.\n\n8â15 Apr 1968: CAPT Robert B. Baldwin sailed the carrier down the Elizabeth River and out into the waters off the Virginia capes for her post repair trials, the shipâs first time at sea in 207 days. RADM John D. Bulkeley,[iv] President of the Board of Inspection and Survey, and his staff inspected the ship for any discrepancies or concerns requiring additional repairs. While accomplishing trials the ship also recorded her first arrested landing since the fire when CDR Robert E. Ferguson, Commander, CVW-17, trapped on board.\n\n23 Aprâ22 May 1968: Forrestal completed refresher training in Caribbean waters. The ship loaded and unloaded her wing at Mayport en route on both voyages, and the crew also went ashore for liberty at Montego Bay in Jamaica.\n\n11â27 Jun 1968: The carrier completed a variety of training exercises and pre-deployment work-ups off Jacksonville, Florida. Although the Navy originally scheduled her training through 5 July, the ship suffered problems with a steam turbine, which forced her to terminate her training before scheduled.\n\n1â20 Jul 1968: Forrestal repaired the turbine at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n27 Jul 1968: Forrestal relieved Shangri-La and commenced operations in the Med, her first return to that sea in three years since the summer of 1965.\n\n17 Aug 1968: LT Robert P. Eicher of VA-34 completed the shipâs 130,000th trap in an A-4C Skyhawk one day out from Marseilles, France, where the ship made a brief stop (9â15 August).\n\n1â3 Oct 1968: Forrestal anchored in Argostoli Bay in Greece for a fleet commanderâs conference held on board Independence.\n\n20 Nov 1968: VADM David C. Richardson, Commander, Sixth Fleet, and Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, visited the ship.\n\n3 Janâ13 Jan 1969: Following a visit to Cannes, France (23 December 1968â3 January 1969) Forrestal operated in the Ionian Sea, before anchoring at the Grand Harbor of Valletta on Malta. Poor weather and high winds caused a cancellation of boating and only allowed a single day of general visiting for curious Maltese.\n\n17â22 Feb 1969: The ship operated in the Aegean Sea after visiting Istanbul in Turkey (10â17 February).\n\n1â17 Mar 1969: Operations in the Adriatic Sea through the 11th afforded the crew the unique opportunity of visiting Trieste in northeastern Italy (11â17 March).\n\n15â19 Apr 1969: Although the ship experienced several uneventful visits to harbors during this deployment, she encountered her second burst of poor weather while making port at Marseilles, when the boating conditions so much that Forrestal cancelled general public visitation.\n\n22 Apr 1969: Attack aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy (CVA-67) relieved Forrestal during the morning at NS Rota, Spain. At 1900 Forrestal weighed anchor and set sail for home.\n\n29 Apr 1969: Forrestal moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk after an uneventful seven day voyage from the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar and across the Atlantic, completing a nine-month deploymentâher longest to the Mediterranean to date.\n\n5â9 May 1969: Following her return the ship spent several days offloading ammunition.\n\n9 Mayâ1 Aug 1969: Forrestal completed a restricted availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\n11 Augâ27 Sep 1969: The ship accomplished a combination of exercises and training evolutions designed to ready her for battle, including refresher training, which took her to Caribbean and western Atlantic waters. Forrestal anchored at GuantÃ¡namo Bay on 20 August, and again on 13 September. She also stopped by both times on her way southward and again returning to Pier 12, Norfolk, to load and offload aircraft and their crews from the wing and ammunition at Mayport.\n\n13â17 Oct 1969: The carrier conducted a firepower demonstration for 400 guests of various service colleges. She spent the first two days rehearsing and performed the demonstration on the 16th and 17th.\n\n11â12 Dec 1969: The ship passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean overnight, relieving John F. Kennedy at Pollensa Bay the next morning. Forrestal then proceeded to operate in the western Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas.\n\n10â20 Jan 1970: The carrier visited Marsaxlokk at Malta. Occasional foul winter weather plagued this visit and the crew could only complete two of their four planned days of general visiting for the public, and limiting a third day, due to the dangerous boating conditions.\n\n16 Febâ2 Mar 1970: Forrestal operated in the Ionian Sea (16â23 February) and then again visited Trieste (23 Februaryâ2 March). CDR Douglas C. Coleman of RVAH-13 made the 150,000th arresting landing on board Forrestal as she steamed in the Ionian Sea, in a Vigilante on 20 February.\n\n10â19 Mar 1970: Heavy weather again restricted boating conditions for visitors and for liberty parties going ashore, when the ship put into Barcelona, Spain, reducing boating visitation from three days to two.\n\n9â15 Apr 1970: After sailing in the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas (2â9 April), Forrestal anchored at Argostoli Bay in Greece. RADM George C. Talley, Jr., relieved RADM William H. House as Commander, Carrier Division 4, during a ceremony on board, on 10 April.\n\n20 Aprâ1 May 1970: The ship anchored off Valletta and St. Paulâs Bay, Malta. Crewmembers contributed to a variety of charitable projects to help people whenever they made port, but this particular visit included a hitherto distinctive event. Some men from the carrier displayed their love of romance when they provided the funds and help to hold a wedding celebration, cake, band and a dowry of $380.00 collected from their shipmates, for the marriage of two Maltese at an orphanage at Gozo.\n\n1â23 May 1970: Following her Maltese call the carrier steamed in the Ionian Sea, broken by a call at the Greek capital of Athens (7â18 May). Chief of Naval Operations (Designate) VADM Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., visited the ship to observe flight operations overnight on 22 and 23 May. During his stay the affable admiral also answered questions from the crew and sailors from WFOR-TV, the shipâs television station, interviewed the prospective and outspoken CNO.\n\n23â27 May 1970: Forrestal anchored at Argostoli Bay. Unfortunately, the ship did not hold liberty call for her disappointed crew.\n\n28 Mayâ4 Jun 1970: The ship put into Corfu.\n\n4â21 Jun 1970: After steaming in the Ionian Sea for Operation Dawn Patrol, a joint NATO readiness exercise to prepare for possible East Bloc attacks in the event of a European war, Forrestal anchored in Souda Bay at Crete (4â9 June). The Sixth Fleet intended Forrestal to visit Naples on 16 June, however, civil strife erupted in Jordan, forcing the ship to curtail her visit and rush to the eastern Mediterranean. The carrier patrolled that area and prepared to provide air support to cover evacuations of Americans from Jordan, but the situation calmed and she came about and made for her abbreviated visit to Naples, on the 21st.\n\n28â29 Jun 1970: Forrestal departed the Mediterranean and conducted an underway turnover with Saratoga the next day.\n\n13 Julâ25 Sep 1970: The ship offloaded her ammunition at Norfolk ammunition anchorage through 17 July; she then moored to Pier 5, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, to complete a restricted availability.\n\n30 Sep 1970: Forrestal hosted the change of command ceremony for Commander in Chief Atlantic Command and Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, when ADM Charles K. Duncan relieved ADM Ephraim P. Holmes, at Pier 12 at NS Norfolk. Secretary of the Navy John H. Chaffee, Jr., led the entourage of dignitaries present.\n\n1â9 Oct 1970: The carrier stood out of Norfolk for post repair trials, returning to onload ammunition (5â9 October).\n\n16â30 Oct 1970: Whenever carriers assigned to the Atlantic Fleet completed restricted availabilities at this time, they normally conducted their refresher training and carrier qualifications in Caribbean waters. As an experiment and economy measure, however, Forrestal accomplished her scheduled training and qualifications off the Virginia Capes, broken only be a brief return to Norfolk on 22 October.\n\n30 Novâ7 Dec 1970: While training and working-up, Forrestal witnessed a unique operation when two Air Force pilots, MAJ George Weeks, USAF, an exchange officer assigned to VF-11, and LCOL Clifford Allison, USAF (the radar intercept officer serving from the staff of Commander, Second Fleet) flying with that squadron, landed their F-4B Phantom IIs for what the shipâs Command History Report referred to as an âall-Air Force carrier landing,â on 5 December.\n\n5â24 Jan 1971: While en route to the Mediterranean, Forrestal onloaded VA-81, VA-83 and RVAH-7, the remaining squadrons of CVW-17, at Mayport on the 7th; she then conducted an operational readiness inspection (13â15 January), and anchored off St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands on the 15th. The carrier then continued onward steaming easterly courses, arriving at NS Rota to relieve Independence on 24 January. Grumman EA-6B Prowlers of Marine Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron (VMAQ)-2 embarked for this initial phase of the deployment. Forrestal steamed through the Strait of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean that night.\n\n29 Janâ3 Feb 1971: The ship made her first visit to a Mediterranean port during this deployment to the Sixth Fleet when she anchored off Vallettaâs sea wall. Choppy seas interfered with liberty ashore and visitation by the normally friendly Maltese, however, and forced Forrestal to restrict visitation.\n\n3â8 Feb 1971: While steaming in the Ionian Sea Forrestal received word that Panamanian-flagged ore ship Flamingo lost power and drifted at the mercy of the wind and tide off southern Italy, on 7 February. Sixth Fleet destroyers attempted to take her in tow, however, rough seas prevented them from aiding the stricken ship. Forrestal sent four Sikorsky SH-3D Sea Kings from HS-3 through winds gusting up to 60 knots and over what the shipâs Command History Report described as âextremely heavy seasâ to rescue all 20 crewmembers and passengers from Flamingo. The carrierâs crew fed and provided medical attention to the survivors, who they flew on to Naval Air Facility (NAF) Sigonella in Sicily the next day to be transported to reunions with their loved ones.\n\n8â10 Feb 1971: As Forrestal anchored in St. Paulâs Bay at Malta, Secretary of the Navy Chaffee and VADM Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., Commander, Sixth Fleet, paid the ship a visit. The secretary appeared on Forrestalâs WFOR-TV for a question and answer session with the crew and presented medals to the 16 men who participated in the rescue of the people from Flamingo. Secretary Chaffee also gave the crew the exciting news that they could wear civilian clothing while on liberty and to store them on board as a feasibility study for wider circulation. The concept proved so popular amongst sailors that the Sixth Fleet later adopted the policy throughout the Mediterranean. Previously, only officers, chiefs and first class petty officers enjoyed that privilege.\n\n10â22 Feb 1971: The carrier operated in the Ionian Sea, during which she hosted a visit on the 18th by the American ambassador to the Netherlands and the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns, who later became the Secretary General of NATO.\n\n22 Febâ2 Mar 1971: As Forrestal put into Valletta poor weather restricted visiting.\n\n12â17 Mar 1971: The ship steamed in the Aegean Sea. Former West German Air Force Chief of Staff GEN Johannes Steinhoff, newly-elected as the Chairman of NATO Military Committee, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe [SHAPE], visited for a carrier orientation (12â13 March).\n\n1â3 Apr 1971: Following a brief visit to Athens, Forrestal transited the Strait of Messina and anchored off Naples to off-load a damaged aircraft, however, rough seas precluded the transfer from the carrier to a barge, so Forrestal stood out of the bay into the Tyrrhenian Sea before she could return the next day as the weather calmed to complete the transfer.\n\n28 Aprâ17 May 1971: Forrestal participated in Operation Dawn Patrol, a NATO air and sea exercise involving more than 60 ships and submarines and over 300 aircraft from the American, British, Greek, Italian and Turkish forces. Dawn Patrol took the carrier from the western Mediterranean to the Tyrrhenian Seas and back again as the struggle for supremacy between the ârival powersâ sea-sawed across the region during the simulated war. A VF-11 Phantom II, LT William G. Pfeiffer and LT(JG) Jake T. Walters, Jr., lost its right main landing gear after bolstering, on 2 May. The crew erected the emergency barricade and LT Pfeiffer landed the Phantom II safely. Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard visited during his tour of American military installations ashore in Europe and ships operating in European waters.\n\n16â22 May 1971: The ship visited Naples. Before Forrestal entered port aircraft performed a âmassiveâ flyover as the height of the 20th anniversary celebration of the establishment of Allied Forces South Europe [AFSOUTH].\n\n25â26 May 1971: Following a transit of the Strait of Messina the carrier anchored at Argostoli. ADM Horacio Rivero, Jr., Commander-in-Chief South, RADM Pierre N. Charbonnet, Jr., Commander, Fleet Air Forces Mediterranean, and RADM George L. Cassell, Deputy Commander, Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe, stayed on board overnight.\n\n11â13 Jun 1971: Following a visit to Corfu (3â11 June) the ship steamed in the Ionian Sea to hold flight operations, during which Belgian MGEN Avi I. Du Monceau, commanding their Tactical Air Force, visited the carrier, on the 12th and 13th.\n\n14 Jun 1971: Forrestal entered the western Mediterranean. Cartoonist Henry K. âHankâ Ketchum, a chief photographic specialist during World War II who created the cartoon character Half Hitch, a naval counterpart to the Armyâs Sad Sack, and who went on after the war to develop his more popularly known comic protagonist Dennis the Menace, visited the ship at the behest of ADM Zumwalt to interview sailors concerning changes in their service and lifestyles since 1945.\n\n27â30 Jun 1971: Saratoga relieved Forrestal at Rota, and VMAQ-2 crossdecked over to Saratoga. The ship then immediately sailed for home on the same day. While en route to the United States three days later, RADM Donald D. Engen relieved RADM Talley as Commander, Carrier Division 4. Meanwhile on the same day, Forrestal attempted an evolution she hitherto never before completed when she offloaded most of her ordnance to ammunition ships while still returning from deployment, alleviating the need to spend time at the ammunition anchorage and the back-breaking hours that her men would spend after doing so after completing an exhausting deployment and while needing rest and time with their families.\n\n2 Jul 1971: At about 1300 Forrestal rounded Sewellâs Point in Hampton Roads and moored to Pier 12 at Norfolk.\n\n16 Jul 1971â10 Apr 1972: Shortly after noon the ship stood down the channel to offload her remaining ammunition, and then she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. Forrestal completed work in drydock (28 Augustâ2 December 1971). Among the many projects which the crew and shipyard workers completed while she remained in drydock, they removed the posts for both rudders to check them for wear, the first time that such work was accomplished since the ship commissioned. She then moored to Pier 5 at the yard, where she remained until 10 April, when ongoing international tensions generated by NATO and Warsaw Pact rivalry over the European balance of power forced her to curtail her work two months earlier than originally scheduled to relieve America, herself ordered to relieve John F. Kennedy, which became overdue to return home.\n\n10 Aprâ28 Jun 1972: At various times during this period the ship completed her type training and carrier qualification exercises off the Virginia Capes instead of in Cuban waters, because her accelerated deployment precluded the usual refresher training conducted off GuantÃ¡namo Bay. RADM Frederick C. Turner relieved RADM William D. Hauser as Commander, Carrier Division 2, during a ceremony on board, on 18 May. During these trials (16â28 June), the ship also celebrated her first operations with Grumman F-14As when two Tomcats (BuNos 158613 and 158614) completed a number of trials on board Forrestal.\n\n10 Julâ18 Aug 1971: A fire broke out on the 03 Level in Flag Country during the early morning hours. The blaze gutted the flag mess and galley, as well as flag living quarters. Peripheral heat and smoke damage extended considerably after and slightly forward of the main fire area. Firemen from Naval Station Norfolk valiantly backed-up crewmembers who rushed to contain and extinguish the blaze, which they finally controlled by about 1500 during the afternoon watch, however, investigators could not penetrate the heat and smoke adequately for almost two days, so heavily did the blaze engulf the area. Although the ship did not report any casualties, investigators later apprehended and charged YNSN Jeffrey Allison, a yeoman assigned to the staff of Commander, Carrier Division 2, for setting the fire, which gutted spaces, destroyed sophisticated CIC electronics equipment and wiring, and inflicted total damages estimated at $7.5 million. Forrestal steamed under her own power to Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs, returning to Pier 12,Norfolk.\n\n29 Sep 1972: Forrestal arrived at Rota during her 10th Mediterranean deployment. Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA)-531, flying F-4B Phantom IIs, relieved VF-74, which transitioned to F-4Js on board Forrestal. The latter squadron deployed with CVW-8 embarking America.\n\n6 Oct 1972: The ship rendezvoused with attack aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42) at Pollensa Bay. Both carriers conducted cross-decking to transfer flag officers and their staffs as Commander, Carrier Division 6 and his staff left Forrestal to embark in Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Commander, Carrier Division 2/Commander, Task Force 60 embarked in Forrestal.\n\n20 Feb 1972: When Forrestal sailed from Istanbul, Turkey, her first visit to that crossroads of the Orient since 1969, she departed without a pair of marines from VMFA-531, who the Turks detained in Istanbul on charges of possession of drugs. The Turks later returned one of the men to U.S. custody, however, the other man remained in the notorious Turkish prison system.\n\n22 Oct 1972: An Olympic Airways NAMC YS-11 airliner crashed after taking off from Athens International Airport during reduced visibility conditions, off the coast of Voula near Athens. Four SH-3D Sea Kings from HS-3 embarking Forrestal, the only helicopter crews in the immediate area qualified for night rescues, flew to the scene and assisted in the rescue of three crewmembers and 16 passengers, however, 37 people (one crewmember and 36 passengers) died during the crash or by drowningâalthough the Sea King crews did not locate survivors they recovered one of the bodies. Ironically, throughout this period controversy concerning the homeporting of a Sixth Fleet carrier in Athens manifested itself through adverse publicity by the media, and servicemembers on liberty ashore experienced a number of altercations with Greek taxicab drivers during several visits to Athens, though not during a stop at Thessaloniki. One of the reasons that the situation gradually diffused became the practice by Forrestal crewmembers of renting a civilian nightclub (a closed discothÃ¨que) near the fleet landing, which offered sailors and marines a reasonable alternative to civilian establishments, of arranging a direct-dial overseas telephone and of improving shore patrol communications system.\n\n8 Nov 1972: A Sea King crew from HS-3 conducted an anti-submarine exercise with Italian guided missile escort cruiser Andrea Doria (C-553).\n\n12â19 Nov 1972: Forrestal participated in National Week 14, a multi-national NATO exercise involving the Sixth Fleet and a number of countries bordering the Mediterranean designed to improved tactics in modern naval warfare, assist NATO commands in training for operations, and to find weaknesses in concepts and communications. A post exercise brief and general board meeting on board the carrier at Souda Bay at Crete concluded the exercise, on the 18th and 19th. In addition, two Sea King crews from HS-3 detached from the carrier to fast combat support ship Seattle (AOE-3) to fly experimental anti-submarine missions from a ânon-aviation shipâ during the exercise.\n\n20 Nov 1972: As Forrestal prepared to leave Souda Bay a ground accident interrupted her departure. Crewmembers taxied Helo No. 007, a Sea King (BuNo 156499) from HS-3, to a wash rack in close proximity to a hanger, when suddenly the rotor blades struck the hanger door. Flying pieces of 007âs rotor blades killed two men, including HM1 Richard H. Nadeau of the shipâs company, and seriously injured a third sailor.\n\n21â27 Nov 1972: When the ship visited Athens unfavorable media reaction reached its peak due to another confrontation between a Greek taxicab driver and a pair of sailors from Forrestal. The Greek government prosecuted the sailors, despite the efforts of CAPT James B. Linder to return the men to U.S. jurisdiction. The attention this incident received across European media prompted the rapid enforcement of the policies ashore that the crew developed during this deployment. During subsequent visits, including an extended stay over Christmas and New Years to enable the crew and their dependents to enjoy charter flights to loved ones, the crew succeeded in reducing these liberty incidents.\n\n28â30 Nov 1972: Aircraft conducted two days of cross-deck operations with their British counterparts from aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal (R-09) in the southeastern Mediterranean.\n\n6â10 Dec 1972: The ship visited Rhodes, however, high seas and a strong tidal current in the Bay of Rhodes prevented normal boating, making it possible only for dependents and their sponsors to disembark the carrier. In addition, AN C.E. Roberts of VAQ-135 leapt into the bay on the 8th. Two helo crews from HS-3 conducted an extensive search but could not recover their shipmate due to the extremely heavy seas, high winds and poor visibility.\n\n18 Feb 1973: Beginning on this date Forrestal participated in National Week 15, conducting the post exercise de brief in Augusta Bay.\n\n28â31 Mar 1973: While preparing to take part in NATO exercises, Forrestal received orders directing her to proceed to Tunisian waters at speed to assist victims of a flood in the Medjerda River Valley of that North African country. The carrier led two other Sixth Fleet ships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship, toward Tunis, where Forrestal appeared at first light on the 29th (about 13 hours after receiving the request) ready to assist the beleaguered people of the area. Altogether, helo crews flew about 40 sorties, pulling 729 persons from the rapidly rising waters, moving 27 tons of cargo, lifting 17 doctors to evacuation centers, carrying an emergency appendectomy to the carrier, and evacuating the entire sheep herdâ227 sheepâfrom one flooded village. Sea Kings flying from Forrestal evacuated about 200 people and airlifted four tons of relief supplies to flood victims. In addition, the carrier's bakery provided 1,200 loaves of bread for distribution, and crew members contributed money to buy supplies for homeless children. Many of the shipâs air traffic controllers joined men from the Operations and Air Operations Departments as a detachment ashore at Tunis Airfield, where they worked from the control center directing flights. In addition to the danger the men faced due to the bitter weather, they also exercised considerable skills dealing with Tunisians who desired to remain with their homes and livestock, regardless of the rising flood waters or incessant downpours. As the crisis began to subside on the third day, Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba decorated RADM Turner and CAPT Linder for their efforts on behalf of his countrymen. French, Italian, Libyan and Tunisian disaster relief teams also supported the efforts of Sixth Fleet crews.\n\n14 Apr 1973: The ship anchored at Kithira, accompanied by several Soviet ships. Forrestal conducted flight operations while anchored, an unusual evolution that appeared to greatly interest the Russians.\n\n4â14 Jun 1973: The ship participated in Dawn Patrol NATO exercises.\n\n25â27 Jun 1973: Forrestal stood out of Palma de Mallorca, where she put in for a brief visit (16â24 June), and from where her âearly birdâ charter flight flew off for home, and steamed westerly courses to Rota. After turning over to her relief, she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic.\n\n6 Jul 1973: By the time the ship returned to Pier 12 at NS Norfolk, aircraft completed 11,957 recoveries and flew 28,355 total flight hours, accomplishing 13,731 sorties, during this deployment. The carrier steamed underway 148 days, and made port 140 days at anchor.\n\nAugâ2 Nov 1973: The first week of the month found Forrestal in Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul, during which a major project became replacing the hanger bay sprinkler system and other firefighting equipment with more modern systems. The crisis that erupted in the Middle East due to the Arab attack against the Israelis (known variously as the Yom Kippur, October, Ramadan or Fourth Arab-Israeli War, 6â26 October), precipitated frenzied shipyard activity and crewmembers joined civilan laborers working at what the shipâs Command History Report described as a âfeverpitchâ for seven days a week for a month. Shipyard workers went into extra shifts and these collective efforts brought Forrestal out of overhaul two months earlier then planned.\n\n26 Nov 1973: Lockheed S-3A Vikings accomplished their first landings on board Forrestal during carrier qualifications as the ship steamed off the Virginia capes. In addition, crewmembers claimed that the ship attained 34-knots during these trials, exceeding her designed speed after years of service and wear.\n\n14 Dec 1973: Tomcats returned to the ship during carrier qualifications on board off the Virginia capes. LCDR Commander Warren B. Christie, Jr., however, ejected from his LTD A-7E when the Corsair II malfunctioned at 22,000 feet. The carrierâs plane guard helo rescued the pilot during his ordeal.\n\n31 Dec 1973â1 Jan 1974: The crew saw the old New Year out and welcomed the new one in with a party in Hanger Bay No. 1, while moored at Pier 12, which many men from ships berthed in company also attended.\n\n7â18 Jan 1974: The ship underwent carrier qualifications off the east coast in preparation for her operational readiness evaluation. Of significance concerns her urgent need to moor at Mayport on the 19th, to investigate Corsair II minor engine problems.\n\n14 Mar 1974: Forrestal relieved Franklin D. Roosevelt in mid-Atlantic waters while en route to the Mediterranean.\n\n20â21 Mar 1974: Forrestal passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived for duty in the Mediterranean, putting into Rota. Extended deployments and long line periods produced a nearly intolerable strain on sailors and marines, fueled by racial tensions endemic throughout the armed forces, and a racial incident flared up on board Forrestal. LTJG Abraham R. Stowe, the shipâs Assistant Electronics Material Officer, recalled that they learned about racial crises on board other ships including attack aircraft carriers Constellation and Kitty Hawk (CVA-63), and then began to experience problems during this deployment. The officerâhimself an African Americanârelated how the operations officer announced during an all-officerâs meeting in the operations department that sailors had discovered a burning cross on board. When the men discussed the hateful symbol and how it could insult shipmates, Stowe replied: ââ¦as a black man Iâm going to advise this group that when a burning cross is found, a white person might wonder, or possibly construe that as a racial slur. But a black person, there is no question about what the meaning of that is.â Stowe recommended to his chain of command that they approach what he described as a systemic problem and quickly diffuse it, though they (apparently) did not locate the culprits of the hate crime, and he spent most of the remainder of the cruise on âpins and needles.â The crew did not experience any additional problems, however, and Stowe noted that most of his shipmates served proudly, and that they returned to a routine of pride and professionalism as quickly as the men could under the trying circumstances.\n\n22 Mar 1974â5 Jun 1975: RADM Brian McCauley arrived in Cairo, Egypt, with a small military planning staff to clear the Suez Canal of wreckage and unexploded ordnance resulting from fighting between the Arabs and Israelis since 1967 (the Six-Day War, War of Attrition and Yom Kippur or October War), which closed the vital artery to international shipping. Operations Nimbus Star directed Navy minesweeping efforts of the canal; Nimbus Moon (water) focused on training and assisting Egyptian mine clearance and salvage operations, and Nimbus Moon (land) directed Army explosive ordnance disposal teams to train and supervise Egyptians ashore. The British and French also participated in the extensive program. The Navy established contingency Task Force 65 on 8 April 1974, the first teams of which began their crucial work from amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima (LPH-2), initially anchored in Port Said harbor. A Sikorsky RH-53D Sea Stallion from Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron (HM)-12 lifted off from Iwo Jima, picked up a Mk 105 magnetic minesweeping sled from support people ashore, and began sweeping the approaches to Port Said, on the 22nd. Task Force 65 grew proportionately to the magnitude of the problem and tank landing ships Barnstable County (LST-1197) and Boulder (LST-1190), salvage ships Escape (ARS-6) and Opportune (ARS-41) and heavy lift craft Crilley (YHLC-1) and Crandall (YHLC-2) were among vessels that later joined Nimbus Star, and amphibious assault ship Inchon (LPH-12) relieved Iwo Jima in mid-May 1974. Meanwhile, through Operation Nimrod Spar they cleared 10 large ships and a number of smaller vessels such as dredges which the Egyptians scuttled as blockships in 1967. The canal finally reopened to maritime commercial traffic on 5 June 1975. Whenever Forrestal operated in the Mediterranean during this period, her aircraft often received tasking regarding flying reconnaissance, combat air patrol and support missions for Task Force 65.\n\n1 Apr 1974: Forrestal operated in the central Mediterranean to back-up America, which steamed in the eastern Mediterranean to be ready to respond to a Middle East crisis. Israeli and Syrian tanks and artillery dueled and Israeli aircraft bombed Syrian troops along the Golan Heights many times during this tense period.\n\n4 Apr 1974: Helos from HS-3 joined with destroyer Davis (DD-937) to track and make simulated attacks against attack submarine Greenling (SSN-614). The exercises afforded crewmembers the opportunity to evaluate coordinated aircraft tactics.\n\n28 Aprâ2 May 1974: Forrestal participated in Dawn Patrol, a two-phase NATO exercise.\n\n11 Mayâ16 Jun 1974: Following a visit to Athens (5â11 May), the ship covertly transited the Mediterranean to take part in Umpireâs Decision (15â27 May), a carrier strike exercise in the eastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean. Passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on the 15th, she conducted what HS-3âs Command History Report emphasized as âspecial coordinated operationsâ in the vicinity of the Canary Islands. Aircraft played cat-and-mouse with the men of Tinosa (SSN-606) as they hunted the attack submarine in simulated wartime conditions. An HS-3 helo from the carrier rescued a man overboard from escort ship Patterson (DE-1061) within six minutes after he entered the water, on 30 May. Forrestal passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and returned to the Mediterranean the next day, in time to commence International Week II, a major NATO exercise with four other countries in the western Mediterranean over 4 and 8 June. Forrestal anchored in Soudha Bay on Crete to allow her first group of midshipmen to disembark and a second group to embark, after which she continued on to Corfu for a brief visit (10â16 June). At least once during this period she also operated with America.\n\n17â20 Jun 1974: While the ship participated in Operation Poopdeck, an exercise with the Spaniards, HS-3 crews flew Spanish President Don Carlos A. Navaro, Duke of Calabria, and VADM Daniel J. Murphy, Commander, Sixth Fleet, out to the ship to view the flight operations, on the 19th.\n\n8â9 Jul 1974: An F-4J Phantom II, LT Irwin H. Nelson and LTJG Bruce A. Ridley of VF-74, crashed while conducting operations from Forrestal. Although SH-3D crews from HS-3 searched the area for 40 hours, they failed to locate either of the men. In addition, the harried Sea King crewmembers also assisted a merchant ship afire.\n\n11 Jul 1974: An RA-5C Vigilante (BuNo 156614), LT Wesley N. Rutledge and LTJG Larry S. Parr of RVAH-6, experienced a bomb bay fire that caused a loss of hydraulics, about four minutes after launching from Forrestal. A helo from HS-3 rescued both men after they ejected.\n\n15 Julâ2 Sep 1974: Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen and their officers from the Greek Army seized control of the government of Cyprus. The Americans held America at Rota (the Navy originally scheduled her to return to Norfolk) and Forrestal (initially anticipating a visit to Athens, Greece) in the central Med due to the rapidly deteriorating situation on the island. By the 19th Forrestal steamed southwest of Crete, about a dayâs sail from Cypriot waters. The next day Turkish troops began landing at the Kyrenia area of northern Cyprus and their paratroopers stormed down near Nicosia. Fighting continued between rival Greeks, Turks and Cypriotsâsome of whom supported the Greeks and some fought with the Turksâuntil they agreed upon a cease fire which took effect at 1700 on 22 July (though violations occurred afterward).
