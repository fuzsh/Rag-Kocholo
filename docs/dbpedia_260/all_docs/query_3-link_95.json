This volume and its successor are concerned with the activitie s and achievements of the same navy, but one grown from infancy t o youth and well on the way to maturity. The infant navy of the earlie r war was conceived from a union of ideas . From the earliest days of British settlement in Australia, its people have been reminded at interval s of their dependence upon sea communications, and of the importance t o them of sea power . On the morning of the 24th January 1788, within a few hours of the arrival at Botany Bay of Captain Phillips' First Flee t bringing with it Australia's original settlers, there was considerable alarm in the ships at the appearance of two strange vessels in the offing standin g in for the land . It was thought that they were hostile Dutch frigates sen t to dispute the British landings . Actually they were the French ships of La Perouse. Relations were friendly, and there was no trouble . It was , however, the first of a series of alarms which impressed the Australia n mind, and which to an extent influenced the development of the Australia n defence policy on the lines it followed up to the outbreak of the secon d world war . The victory of Trafalgar in 1805 secured British control of the sea and ushered in the long period of the Pax Britannica . During the first hal f of the nineteenth century no threat to Australia appeared . Daily the su n rose over peaceful Pacific waters, and often gilded the masts and spar s of ships of the British East Indian squadron, lying in Port Jackson . Australia then formed part of the East Indian station, whose flag office r controlled the movements of these ships . In times of peace they offere d comforting assurance of protection . But the Australian authorities kne w that in time of war they would probably sail off over the encircling horizo n to duties elsewhere, leaving the Australian coast, in appearance at any rate, undefended . In 1859 (by which time ripples from the distant Crimea had broken on Australian shores, producing a mild scare which constrained Ne w South Wales and Victoria each to acquire a small armed ship for local defence) the Australia station was constituted as a separate Imperia l naval command independent of the East Indian station . The position , however, remained unchanged regarding the ships there based . They formed an Imperial squadron whose duty was not only to provide for th e defence of the Colonies, but, in time of war, to escort treasure ship s sailing for England, accompanying them as far as either the Cape of Goo d Hope or the Horn, both a long way from Australia . The urge grew for Australian-controlled ships for local defence, in addition to thos e of the Royal Navy. There was a natural clash of views between the Imperial and Colonia l governments on this question . The Imperial authorities correctly premised xi\n\nthat because the seas are one the fleet should be one . They held that the successful conduct of war at sea demanded one central control o f naval forces, and that the best contribution by the colonies would b e a subsidy. The Australian authorities, while accepting the premise an d being willing and eager to contribute their share towards the defenc e of sea communications and to their own local defence, understandabl y wished to have some say in that defence and in the dispositions of th e forces to which they contributed . Fortunately there was give and take on both sides, though each had its die-hards . The Australians saw the wisdom in the Imperial argument ; the British government and the Admiralty were sympathetic towards Australian aspirations . A continuin g and progressive compromise, speeded by the march of events and th e increasing threat from growing rivals to Britain ' s naval supremacy, provided the solution . During the colonial period the way was paved fo r Australia's naval development by the Governments of New South Wales , Victoria, Queensland and South Australia (in part impelled by war alarm s overseas) establishing their own small naval forces for local defence , under the immediate wing of the Imperial squadron and the overall protection of the far distant British battle fleet . With Australian federation in 1901, and the establishment of a Commonwealth Governmen t responsible for Australian defence, the substitution of ships and men fo r a subsidy, and of an Australian squadron for the Imperial squadron o n the Australia station, became possible. Thus the infant Australian navy of the first world war was conceived , from a union of British and Australian ideas fused by a compromis e which produced a practical plan . In 1909, after ideas and proposals ha d been exchanged for some years, the Admiralty suggested that Australi a should acquire a self-contained fleet unit, owned by Australia and con trolled and administered by the Australian Government through the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board . Its composition should be such that , while manageable (within the Australian budget) in time of peace, an d capable of effective independent operation as a balanced force in time o f war, it could also be used as a component part or, divided, as component parts, of other forces under Admiralty control . The fleet unit, acquired by Australia in the years immediately preceding the first world war, consisted of one battle-cruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers and tw o submarines, with the necessary auxiliaries . The original intention wa s that this fleet unit should be one of three forming an \"Eastern\" or \"Pacific \" fleet of the British Empire ; but events overtook plans (as was to happe n again in the period of which this volume tells) and only the Australia n unit materialised . There is interest in the parallel between this Britis h \"Fleet unit\" conception of 1909, a self-contained fast striking force buil t around a battle cruiser, and that of the American \"Task force\" of 1941 , built around an aircraft carrier . xii\n\nThere were four main essentials to the success of the fleet unit conception . To meet natural Australian ambitions, its ships had to be owne d and controlled by Australia, and manned as far as possible by Australia n officers and seamen . Because its main value at all times would be it s constant and instant readiness to cooperate with the Royal Navy, eithe r as a separate squadron or as a component part or parts of other forces , its regulations had to resemble the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, and the standard of training, discipline and general efficienc y in ships, officers, and men, had to be maintained on an equality with that of the Royal Navy . As a corollary, it was most desirable that, s o far as was possible, there should be joint training with H .M . Ships . An d finally, there must be a readiness on the part of the Australian Government and people to transfer strategic and tactical control of the squadro n or of units thereof to the Admiralty in time of war . These essentials were met . Because of lack of training it was no t possible at the outset to man the ships entirely with Australians, an d throughout the first world war the proportions were approximately 8 0 per cent R .A .N . and 20 per cent R .N . officers and men . Training centre s were, however, established in Australia on the British model, a naval college for embryo officers and a training ship (later establishment) fo r ratings, and the gap was virtually closed in the years between the wars . In its governing regulations, its methods and standards of training, discipline, and general conduct, the R .A .N . has adhered closely to the R.N . pattern ; and the desired standard of equality with the older navy has a t all times been maintained . Joint training in peace time was not easy t o arrange, but whenever opportunity offered, with the visit of a Britis h squadron to Australian waters, combined exercises were carried out ; an d a program of cruiser exchange, though interrupted by economic difficulties, gave valuable results . There was also a continuous interchange of officers, petty officers, and men, which is of great benefit to both navies . As to unified control in time of war, Australia accepted in principl e the theory that the indivisibility of the seas demanded, as far as possible , an undivided naval control . The basis of the naval defence of Australi a remained fundamentally unchanged from the days of earliest settlement local responsibility for the Australia station (first as part of the Eas t Indian station) and ultimate dependence on the integrity of world wid e sea communications . The instrument guaranteeing this integrity was th e power radiating from the British battle fleet outwards through th e squadrons and ships of the various naval stations, of which the Australi a station was one . Australia recognised that it might be necessary in war t o concentrate power by reinforcing one station at the expense of others and , to meet that contingency, agreed in both world wars (though not withou t occasional rightful criticism) to transfer control of the squadron, or o f individual ships, to the Admiralty . It is again of interest that this recogni-\n\ntion of a vital principle and readiness to act according to it was an exampl e in unity of naval command followed (after some expensive fumbling ) by the Allies during the second world war . It was a concomitant of victory. Australian acceptance of the theory of the indivisibility of the seas, an d the consequent need for unified control of naval forces, has greatl y widened the scope of this history . Australian ships formed part of Britis h (and later of Allied) naval forces in widely separated areas . Their movements and activities were determined by a variety of influences in bot h the political and military fields, and emanating from Australian, British , Allied, and enemy sources . Because of this it has been necessary largely to sketch in the pattern of the whole war, politically, economically, geographically and militarily, on a world background ; and against this t o trace the Australian naval story in as great detail as practicable . Only s o could any attempt be made to preserve a just proportion in depicting th e part of the Australian navy in relation to the whole . To discuss an d determine the influence of sea power on the progress and outcome of th e war; the way that power was wielded by the respective participants ; and the contribution made by Australia through the Royal Australian Navy , is the object of this work . All available sources of information have been drawn upon withou t restraint, and the author has been given generous assistance in all quarter s where it was sought . Sources include records of the Australian Wa r Cabinet and Advisory War Council, and of the Admiralty and the Australian Naval Board ; reports of commanders-in-chief and of commandin g officers of individual ships ; the war diaries and letters of proceedings o f ships and establishments ; personal notes and written or verbal account s of experiences ; and Allied and enemy documents . Recourse has also been made to published works, reference to which is, in each instance, recorded in footnotes . The author has been untrammelled by censorship, and give n complete freedom in comment and the expression of opinion, for whic h he alone is responsible . This book has been written for the general reader rather than for the naval expert, so that technicalities, excepting those widely and readil y understood, have been avoided as far as possible ; and sometimes terms running counter to professional practice have been used . For example, courses and bearings have been given in compass points instead of i n degrees . Reference is made above to the assistance received in general . In particular, the author is indebted to a number of individuals who hav e given him much of their time and thought, and much encouragement . It is not possible to over-estimate his indebtedness to Mr Gavin Long , the General Editor of the series of histories of which this is a part . H e has been a never-failing inspiration ; a most forbearing editor, offering sympathetic understanding of problems, stimulating comment, and wise xiv\n\nadvice . Of Mr Long's efficient and ever-helpful staff, Mr John Balfou r has been a painstaking assistant, notably in putting the many necessar y final touches to the typescript to make it ready for the printer, and i n preparing biographical footnotes . Mr Hugh Groser has added greatly to the value of the book with his excellent charts ; and Miss Mary Gilchrist has smoothed the path with many thoughtful secretarial attentions . In the field of research, valuable help was received from Mr H . H . Ellmers and his staff in the records section of the Admiralty ; from Commander Geoffrey Rawson, who for some months acted in Londo n as a personal link with the Admiralty ; and from Mr J . M . Luke, officerin-charge of Naval Historical Records, Navy Office, Melbourne, an d members of his staff, especially Mr J . K . Ware and Mr L . G . Norman . A most necessary contribution was made by Mr L . I. Parker, whos e arduous task was the preparation of the index . Much encouraging help , by precept and example, was received from fellow authors of the histories . Most valuable comments and suggestions have been given by thos e upon whose forbearance, knowledge and experience, the author has draw n as readers of his draft chapters . A careful reading and checking agains t records was done by Mr Luke and his staff at Navy Office . All the chapters were read by members of the Historical Staff at the Admiralty, who checked them for factual accuracy in matters concerning ships and operations of the Royal Navy, with extremely useful results . The late Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin read Chapters 1 to 11 inclusive, and his penetratin g comment was of the greatest help. His death terminated a kindly servic e and robbed the author of a wise mentor and esteemed friend . All th e chapters have been read with diligent scrutiny by Commander R . B . M . Long, R .A .N. (Retd), who most kindly broke into his too-limited leisur e to study them, and whose sage counsel has been of inestimable benefit . A number of others generously read small portions which they were peculiarly qualified to discuss . Finally, the author is indebted beyond measur e to his wife, who uncomplainingly listened to his reading of the developin g volume in and out of season, and who always encouraged him wit h pertinent criticism and thoughtful suggestions . The author himself had some years sea experience as an apprentic e and deck officer in the British Merchant Service . The 1914-18 war years , spent wholly at sea, made him familiar with many of the scenes of thi s history, in particular the Mediterranean, the Aegean, the Persian Gulf , the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the Australia station, under war conditions—even though they lacked the intensity of the conditions in the war with which this history deals . He settled on shore in Australia i n the nineteen-twenties, and joined the Royal Australian Naval Voluntee r Reserve while practising as a journalist, and as a writer largely o n nautical matters .

As early as the Imperial Conference of 1911, the implications of th e birth and growing strength of naval forces in the Dominions had bee n stressed by the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey. He said that , if the action of fighting forces in different parts of the Empire were deter mined by divergent views about foreign policy, the Empire would no t consent to share the resulting liability, the risks of which it could no t gauge ; and that \" the creation of separate fleets has made it essential tha t the foreign policy of the Empire should be a common policy \" . One of th e first fruits of this conclusion was that the Dominion Ministers were consulted at this Conference before the renewal for ten years of the AngloJapanese Alliance, the original treaty having been entered into in 190 2 and the renewal effected in 1905 without previous concurrence by th e Dominions . After the 1914-18 war came recognition of equality of status as between all the partners of the British Commonwealth . Speaking of the Dominions at the 1921 Imperial Conference, the British Prime Minister, Mr Lloy d George, said : \"They have attained full national status, and they now stan d beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth .\" This new status, with the late r recognition that it was for the parliaments of the several parts of th e Empire upon the recommendations of their respective governments t o decide the nature and extent of any warlike action which should be taken by them,' was to exercise an influence in Australia's naval policy. On the economic side large war debts had been incurred, and a prunin g of defence expenditure was considered necessary to economic recovery , especially in Britain . There was a demand that governments spend mone y on improving social conditions rather than on armaments . It was accepte d that the defence of the Empire depended on the British Navy . But although , at the end of the war in 1918, Britain occupied a greater pre-eminence over European powers than at any previous time and her navy ranke d ahead of those of the United States and Japan, she was no longer in the strong position she had hitherto employed . With the end of the war in sight, British capital ship construction ha d ceased except that Britain went on building the big battle cruiser Hood.2 This was to have been one of four, but work on the other three was 1 Resolution No . 2, Imperial Conference, 1923 . HMS Hood, battle cruiser (1920), 42,100 tons, eight 15-in and twelve 5 .5-in guns, 31 kts ; sunk by German battleship Bismarck, Denmark Strait, 24 May 1941 .\n\n2\n\nBETWEEN\n\nTHE WARS\n\n1916-24\n\nstopped in October 1918, the contracts later being cancelled . Immediate post-war estimates made no provision for building warships, and not unti l 1921 were tenders for four capital ships invited . Both the United States and Japan, on the contrary, had considerabl e building programs in hand, started in 1916 and making good progress . The new American and Japanese capital ships were to mount 16-inch guns , whereas Hood was the only post-Jutland ship in the British fleet, wher e the heaviest gun mounted was the 15-inch . By 1924 Britain would posses s only fourteen first-class battleships, totalling 336,350 tons to the twenty one of 722,000 tons under the American flag, while Japan would hav e eight of 252,000 tons ; Britain would have four battle cruisers with th e heaviest guns, of 121,000 tons, to the six of the United States of 261,00 0 tons ; the Japanese would possibly have six completed in 1924 and had , moreover, decided soon to lay down eight capital ships . Anxiety about the decline of British naval power was reflected i n Australia, a reflection sharpened by the fact that it was obvious that th e centre of naval strategy now lay in the Pacific, and there were indications that the Pacific might be the scene of the next world war, a naval race having developed between the United States and Japan, eac h of whose fleets had carried out large-scale manoeuvres in Pacific waters . With the United States, Australia, in common with the rest of the Britis h Empire, was on terms of the closest international friendship . With Japan , Britain had a Treaty of Alliance to which Australia was a partner . Some friction had; however, arisen between Australia and Japan on the questio n of the White Australia policy . Moreover, the two countries were no w much closer neighbours than before as a result of the allocation unde r mandate of the former German colonies, Japan having been granted thos e islands north of the equator, while Australia had those to the south . As was stated during the course of debate on the Peace Treaty in the Hous e of Representatives on 17th September 1919, \"Australia has taken its frontiers northward to Rabaul, but the frontier of Japan has been brought southward 3,000 miles to the equator, until their front door and our bac k door almost adjoin\" . At this stage the Commonwealth Government was basing its nava l policy on the advice contained in the Henderson 3 \"Recommendations \" of 1911 . The consideration that this policy might require reviewing in th e light of war experience and the post-war situation led to the Government's inviting the Admiralty to send out a naval authority to survey and repor t on the whole question of naval defence . Admiral of the Fleet Lord Jellicoe 4 was selected, and arrived in Australia in May 1919, remaining thre e months before returning to England by way of New Zealand and Canada . The results of his survey were embodied in his \"Report on the Nava l Mission to the Commonwealth \" , which was submitted to the Governor General in August 1919, and in which great stress was laid upon th e *Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, GCB ; RN .

Then Britain's weakness in the Mediterranean had led to her receiving no practical support durin g the Abyssinian war, and she had been the only country to move a shi p or a man as a deterrent to Italy . But, though active support was not forth coming then, the movement of those ships and men revived the hopes o f weaker Mediterranean countries for the future . It was an echo down three\n\n1940\n\nBRITISH AND FRENCH FLEETS\n\n149\n\ncenturies of \"your fleets meeting here\" being of admiration to \"foreign kingdoms into which reports fly to them daily\" . And it was shortly afterwards that the British Government resolved any doubts as to its intentions by stating unequivocally Britain ' s decision to remain in th e Mediterranean in strength ; and that the building up of that strength began . II I For the first ten days after Italy entered the war in June 1940, th e Mediterranean picture was not an unfavourable one for Britain and France . The coastline, except for that of Italy and her possessions—th e Dodecanese, Tripolitania, and Cyrenaica—were Allied or neutral . Allie d responsibility for the defence of the sea was shared mainly on a geographical basis, the French being responsible for the western basin, the Britis h for the eastern . At Gibraltar a British patrol force of one aircraft carrier , Argus, and two cruisers and nine destroyers of the North Atlantic command, kept watch over the Straits . In the western basin the French Flee t comprised the battleships Bretagne and Provence ; the battle cruisers Dunkerque and Strasbourg ; four 8-inch gun cruisers of the Algerie clas s and six 6-inch gun ships of the Marseillaise class ; twenty-seven destroyers , including six large vessels of the Tigre and Le Fantasque classes, which were in effect light cruisers ; and thirty-two submarines . The main force , including the four capital ships, was based on Mers el Kebir, with lighte r concentrations at Algiers, Bizerta, and Toulon . There was also a French force under Admiral Godfroy in the Eastern Mediterranean, consisting o f the battleship Lorraine, the 8-inch gun cruisers Suffren, Duquesne, and Tourville, the 6-inch gun cruiser Duguay-Trouin ; the destroyers L e Fortune, Forbin, and Basque ; and seven submarines . The British Mediterranean Fleet consisted of the battleships Warspite—wearing the flag o f the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Cunningham—Ramillies, Roya l Sovereign, and Malaya ; nine cruisers, including Gloucester, Liverpool, Orion, Neptune, and Sydney of the 7th Cruiser Squadron; and the \"C \" class vessels of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron which was under the comman d of Rear-Admiral Renouf ;4 the aircraft carrier Eagle ; the monitor Terror ; twenty-six destroyers, four of which were detached to the East Indie s Station ; twelve submarines ; and various auxiliary vessels . 5 The main fleet was based on Alexandria, only light forces being at Malta .

SHIPS OVERSEAS JUNE-DECEMBER 1940\n\n1940\n\nThe Italian Fleet consisted at this time of six battleships, four of which , Andrea Doria, Caio Duilio, Conte di Cavour, and Giulio Cesare, had bee n completed during the 1914-18 war, but had been reconstructed an d modernised—as had Warspite and Queen Elizabeth-class battleships of th e British Navy—and two of which, Vittorio Veneto and Littorio, laid dow n in 1934, were new vessels ; nineteen cruisers, including seven 8-inch gu n ships of the Bolzano, Zara, and Trento classes, and twelve 6-in gun vessels of the Emanuele Filiberto and Condottiere classes, all completed during the pre-war decade ; some fifty destroyers and at least 115 submarines ;s and small craft. The Italian Navy had no aircraft carriers, but could b e strongly supported in the air by the land-based aircraft of the Italian Ai r Force, reputed to number about 2,000 first line machines, with 400 t o 500 in reserve, operating from bases in Italy, North Africa, and the Dodecanese . In June 1940 the main Italian Fleet was based in Italy, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons ? at Taranto and Naples respectively ; with some cruisers at Palermo and destroyers and submarines at Trapani in Sicily , where also, at Augusta, were the two new battleships, carrying out exercise s before taking their place in the fleet . There were light forces at the Dodecanese Islands, and some destroyers and submarines based on Massaw a in the Red Sea . 8 The combined British and French fleets were thus numerically superio r to that of Italy in capital ships and about equal to it in cruisers . Allie d numerical inferiority lay in destroyers and submarines, in which categories they were outnumbered by more than one-third of their total . In genera l the Italians had the important advantage of greater speed in all classe s of surface vessels, and possessed vastly superior air power which could be used from bases ideally situated for attack and defence . Furthermore , Italy's commanding geographical position, by which the Mediterranea n Sea and the fleets of her enemies were divided, would, if exploited wit h energy and determination, have more than offset her discrepancy in capital ships .

It was Fascist policy to build a large navy to impress the world and deter possible enemies . The ships, to a large extent, suffered in design from the \"Mediterranean \" tradition, being built for speed in comparatively calm waters, lackin g adequate protective armour, and having far too much space devoted t o luxurious quarters for officers ; the bridges of even destroyers and corvette s were covered and built-in for shelter from the elements . There was lac k of encouragement of engineering and scientific development which ha d its effect—the Italian Navy, for example, fought throughout the war with out radar. And the feeling existed that Britain, even if her power in th e Mediterranean was inferior, had enormous reserves upon which to draw , in the lack of which Italy was fighting a defensive war. The Italians wer e particularly hampered in operations by shortage of fuel oil, for lack o f which the big ships, in the later stages of the war, were at times immobilised . For various reasons there was little real fighting spirit or enthusiasm among officers and men of the fleet. Although there was a small bu t powerful core of Fascist minded officers in key places—ambitious me n whose political leanings had gained them recognition and promotio n (Mussolini held the portfolio of Navy Minister)—Fascism had infiltrate d far less into the navy than into any other walk of Italian life, and mos t senior officers from the rank of lieut-commander upwards were staunc h Monarchists, little tainted with Fascism, but torn between a hatred o f Germany and a fear of Communism . The Italian naval officer's feelings towards Britain had, in most instances, been friendly until the Abyssinian crisis . He remembered Britain's aid an d sympathy in the period of the Risorgimento, and the fact that the tw o countries had never been at war ; and he felt that the ties of friendship were strengthened by the \"brotherhood of the sea\" . But Britain's attitude in the Abyssinian period was incomprehensible to the Italian mind, an d her subsequent inactivity in the face of Germany's provocative action s culminating in the annexation of Austria, caused Italians to feel that they were being driven into German arms, and bitterness grew against Britain . Yet the Italian Navy did not feel that war with Britain was justified ; and when it finally came, many officers believed that their only hope la y in defeat, since they had few illusions about Germany . Discipline in the navy, though superficially strict, suffered from th e characteristics of officers and ratings . The majority of the permanent officers came from the centre and north of Italy, from such towns as Genoa , Leghorn, Venice, Trieste, Florence, Milan, Rome, Turin, and surrounding regions. Among the ratings, the greatest proportion were southerner s —recruited from fishermen, boat-builders, sponge divers and other se a trades predominating in southern Italy—and added to this gulf between\n\n152\n\nR .A .N . SHIPS OVERSEAS JUNE-DECEMBER\n\n1940\n\n1939-40\n\nlocal sympathies was that between the living conditions on board ship , where the luxury of accommodation, furnishings, and food and wine o f the officers contrasted strongly with the lot of the ratings . The officer's manner with subordinates was brusque, and he had little consideration for their welfare ; and punishments of ratings for minor infringements were severely and freely given. The team spirit, never strong among the individualistic Italians, was thus further weakened, and discipline tended t o break down in a crisis . Naval administration was bad, and there was incompetency in organisation which induced cynical apathy among the seagoing forces . Trainin g was sketchy, and never intensive during the war, exercises being cancelle d when the weather was bad and seas were heavy . The movements of al l ships were controlled directly by the Ministry of Marine in Rome, an d commanding officers afloat were seldom allowed to use their own discretion . In actual war operations not only strategy, but tactics, were veste d in the Ministry, where was only the haziest appreciation of what wa s happening at sea, and where the fear of losses was a determining factor . Consequently occasions arose when a commanding officer in superior strength and favourable circumstances was ordered from Rome to retire . Confidence was sapped by lack of faith in reports of Italian naval successes ; reports which were fruits of a general tendency to exaggerate , of which the Italians were aware but which they themselves did nothin g to correct . Finally, the modern Italian Navy—though Fascist training traced Italy's achievements on the seas back to the Roman Empire 's nava l victories, commemorated in the existing fleet in the name of the battleshi p Caio Duilio, as the later victory of Lepanto was in that of her sister shi p Andrea Doria—was not founded until 1861 . There was no long unbroke n line of tradition to inspire confidence and pride . The British Mediterranean Fleet was in an entirely different position . Many of those now manning the ships had seen arduous service in various parts of the world during the 1914-18 war and the intervening years ; an d nine months actual experience and training in the existing conflict lay immediately behind them . The Mediterranean Station, where ships i n peacetime remained in full commission for two-and-a-half years with few changes in their crews, had long been recognised as an ideal training ground . A regular routine had been followed : spring cruises in the wester n basin ; the Central Mediterranean in the summer ; the Aegean and Easter n Mediterranean in the autumn and winter . During the decade leading up to the outbreak of war in 1939 training, especially in night-fighting, ha d increased in efficiency . Previously night-fighting had been looked upon a s something to be avoided, but a change in British naval opinion occurre d in 1929, as a result of a combined memorandum from the Commandersin-Chief of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets urging upon the Admiralty the great advantages of fighting at night in certain circumstances . Writing later of his period as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, fro m 1930 to 1932, Lord Chatfield, who had contributed to this memorandum when Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic, recalled that : \"A large part of my\n\n1914-39\n\nADMIRAL CUNNINGHAM\n\n15 3\n\ntime in the Mediterranean was consequently occupied in developing ou r night-fighting efficiency . . . . Never again was it to be possible for an enem y fleet to escape destruction under cover of darkness . On the contrary , night-fighting was to be our great opportunity in another war . We woul d surprise the enemy by our efficiency .\"9 Chatfield's second-in-comman d at this time, and his successor as Commander-in-Chief, was Admira l Fisher, with whom those night-fighting exercises were initiated and b y whom they were continued . Fisher's time as Commander-in-Chief, from 1932 to 1937, included the period of the Abyssinian crisis, when th e fleet was on a war footing ; while during the term of his successor, Admira l Pound, l the Spanish Civil War, with its piratical submarine attacks o n merchant ships in the Mediterranean, kept the fleet operating under nearwar conditions . The fleet, therefore, although but lately reconstituted after the dispersa l of its units to other stations during the few quiet months in the Mediterranean preceding the growing Italian threat, was at a high pitch o f efficiency . Most of its officers and men had been trained under three outstanding Commanders-in-Chief in a sea made familiar to them by constan t exercises under all conditions of weather by day and night, so that the y knew the Ionian, the Aegean, and the Levant, far better than did thei r new adversaries . And they were now under a Commander-in-Chief wh o had spent the greatest proportion of his time afloat in the Mediterranean , in the war of 1914-18 and the near-war years from 1934 on . Much of Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham' s service in the first world war was in the Mediterranean as commanding officer of the 890-to n destroyer Scorpion—a ship he commanded for the record period of seve n years, and in which he won distinction at Gallipoli . With his promotio n to captain he commanded destroyer flotillas from 1922 to 1924, and h e had big ship experience in command as captain of H .M .S. Rodney throughout 1930 . In 1934 he was appointed Rear-Admiral Commandin g Destroyers, Mediterranean Fleet . \"I see a lot of RA(D) who lies close to us,\" wrote Fisher, then C-in-C, \"and he is a great trump .\" Two years later, promoted to vice-admiral, he was commanding the battle-cruise r squadron as second-in-command to Admiral Pound . In June 1939, after seven months at the Admiralty, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief , Mediterranean, when Pound became First Sea Lord. Cunningham was known throughout the fleet as \"A .B .C .\" . He was o f middle height, with alert eyes, a high broad head, aggressive ears an d jaw, but a humorous mouth . He was intolerant of inefficiency and coul d be uncompromising in speech and approach . As a young destroyer office r he had shown the dash and initiative which were to remain with him an d which, allied to later experience in higher command, were to set the pac e of his direction of the naval war in the Mediterranean .

He had commanded the destroyer Onslow at Jutland, when, in a disabled condition, he attacked the German battle cruiser Der.07inger. The greatest part of his time afloat had been spent in destroyers, but, like Cunning ham, he had experience of both operational and administrative directio n ashore, and had big ship experience in command as captain of Rodne y from 1932 to 1934 . A quick thinker, a proved fighter and seaman, he had charm of personality, and a humanity matching that of his Commander-in-Chief . The confidence existing between the two leaders was shared with th e Admiralty—by whom a large measure of freedom of action was lef t to the Commander-in-Chief—and extended throughout the command , where it was fully reciprocated ; so that, in character and spirit, the Mediter ranean Fleet had what the Italian Navy lacked—ships built as efficien t fighting units for service in all seas and all weathers ; officers and me n imbued with a team spirit and with mutual esteem founded on experience ; hard training which had brought them to a high degree of efficiency ; a long and unbroken tradition of a kind to induce confidence ; and resolut e and aggressive leadership unhampered by outside interference . IV Darkness, descending upon Egypt's Mediterranean littoral on th e evening of the 10th June 1940, concealed a coastline in most parts fringe d by dangerous off-shore reefs and shoals, but having few outstandin g topographical features in the eastern half of its 510 miles . From th e Palestinian border at Rafa, the advancing shadows obscured a low, sand y coastal fringe, broken after 100 miles by Port Said and the straight ribbo n of the Canal fading southwards into the desert . They travelled on acros s the 130 miles of Nile delta to Alexandria . They hid the coastal plain , with its occasional cliffs backed by lagoons and salt marshes and th e 2\n\nAt Christmas 1940 Cunningham wrote to a friend : \"The war progresses slowly out here bu t everything that has happened has proved how right Sir William [Fisher] was in 1935-1936 durin g the Abyssinian time. Many a time when confronted with a difficult situation I cast my min de back and ask myself what he would have done, and the answer always comes the same—to tak the bold and direct course—and it pays .\" Admiral W . James, Admiral Sir William Fisher (1943) , p . 157 . An incident indicative of Cunningham 's character occurred in Alexandria when, as a motor-boa t from one of the Australian destroyers was leaving \"No . 6 Gate \", a man in plain clothes aske d the coxswain if he could drop him at Warspite as he passed . The coxswain, who thought he was the flagship's canteen manager, agreed, but said clutch trouble prevented his going aster n and the passenger would have to jump for it passing the Warspite's gangway, as he wouldn't stop the engine for him . The passenger said he would jump all right, and duly did so, at th e battleship 's midship gangway . It was not until the coxswain got back to his own ship, wher e was a signal from the C-in-C to the C .O . thanking him for the lift, that he realised who h e had put on board the flagship . As was subsequently learned, Cunningham was regarded in the Italian Navy as the outstandin g naval figure of the war, and his humanity, manifested on a number of occasions, and particularl y after Matapan, produced a deep Impression . The general Italian naval sentiment was that at se a the British and Italian navies fought each other cleanly and without rancour .\n\nJune\n\nALEXANDRIA\n\n15 5\n\nlow scarps of the Libyan plateau, which stretches 130 miles beyon d Alexandria to the small harbour of Mersa Matruh . They swept on a further 100 miles to Salum, where a sheltered bay provides anchorag e with good holding ground for large ships, and where the escarpment, her e some 600 feet high, comes down to the shore, and the coastline rises i n precipitous 300-foot cliffs which continue on to the nearby frontier o f Cyrenaica at Marsa Ramla . Eight miles beyond the frontier was the first Italian coastal stronghold, Bardia, with a small harbour enclosed in high , steep cliffs, whose skyline forms a distinct \"V\" seen from seaward . Tobruk, the main Italian port and naval base on this section of the coast, lay 60 miles farther west, a well sheltered and defended harbour wit h good depths, and accommodation for large ships . The port of Derna, suit able for only small ships within a sheltering breakwater, lay 80 mile s beyond Tobruk ; and Benghazi, Cyrenaica's principal port, was anothe r 160 miles on, around the coastal bulge on the eastern shores of th e extensive Gulf of Sidra . The ports were linked by a road which in man y places was in clear view from the sea . Alexandria, the largest port and—by virtue of the floating dock—the only capital ship base in the Eastern Mediterranean, far exceeded all the others in size and facilities . Situated at the north-east end of a bay protected by a rock and shoal-studded bank, its Western Harbour, an artificia l haven made by a breakwater, provided ample accommodation for th e fleet in its outer basin, an area some two miles long and averaging a mil e in width, with depths of 56 to 58 feet . Anti-submarine defences had bee n laid by the net vessel Protector .3 The Eastern Harbour, a picturesqu e semi-circular bight one and a quarter miles in diameter on the site of th e ancient port, fringed by a promenade on the landward side and separated from the Western Harbour by a low promontory, was no longer used . Four passages—the Marabout Pass, Boghaz Pass, Corvette Pass, and Grea t Pass—led through the shoals to the Western Harbour . The Great Pass , about a mile and a half in length, was the main channel and the only one used at night. Boghaz Pass was second in importance and could b e used by deep draught ships in calm weather, and the Boghaz Patrol — known to the sailors as \"Bughouse Patrol\" —was a regular duty of th e Australian destroyers based on the port . Alexandria's most conspicuou s landmark from the sea was the tall column of Ras el Tin lighthouse . On the evening of the 10th June, most of the ships of the fleet wer e in the Western Harbour. At 4 .30 p .m . Ciano had told the British an d French ambassadors in Rome that from the 11th June Italy would consider herself at war ; but news of this declaration did not reach the flee t until two and a half hours later . The event had, however, been anticipated, and on this day the ships' companies had been closed up to first degre e anti-aircraft readiness at dawn and dusk. With the news of the declaration the fleet went to two hours' notice for steam, and a projected refit o f Ramillies was abandoned.

SHIPS OVERSEAS JUNE-DECEMBER 1940\n\nMay-Jun e\n\ners under Captain (D) 2 in Hyperion on an anti-submarine patrol to the westward, were in harbour . Dinner was in progress in Sydney's wardroo m when, about 8 p .m ., the mess president tapped for silence and broke th e news that an Italian ultimatum declared a state of war against the Allie s as from midnight that night . The news \"came like the proverbial bomb into our midst\", 4 with, for some at any rate, the expectation of a heav y air raid the following morning . A few days earlier, on the 23rd May, Admiral Cunningham had tol d the Admiralty that in the event of war his initial object would be to secur e control of communications in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean , and cut off enemy supplies to the Dodecanese . This objective did not envisage cutting Italian communications with Libya, and Cunningham explained this by the paucity of his light forces and lack of aircraft, th e fact that military offensives against Libya were not then contemplated , and that it was important to support Turkey and to deal with Italian nava l forces based on the Dodecanese . He did not, however, intend to neglect the Central Mediterranean, but would carry out sweeps in that area . This statement was not acceptable to Mr Churchill—by this time Prim e Minister—who on the 28th May told the Chiefs of Staff Committee : If France is still our ally after an Italian declaration of war, it would appea r extremely desirable that the combined Fleets, acting from opposite ends of th e Mediterranean, should pursue an active offensive against Italy . It is important tha t at the outset collision should take place both with the Italian Navy and Air Force , in order that we can see what their quality really is, and whether it has change d at all since the last war . The purely defensive strategy contemplated by Commanderin-Chief Mediterranean ought not to be accepted . Unless it is found that the fighting qualities of the Italians are high, it will be much better that the Fleet at Alexandria should sally forth and run some risks than that it should remain in a posture s o markedly defensive . Risks must be run at this juncture in all theatres . 5\n\nCunningham's initial objective could hardly be said to constitute \"purely defensive strategy \" . Control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegea n could not be secured, nor the enemy's communications with the Dodecanes e severed, by the fleet remaining in Alexandria \"in a posture so markedly defensive\" . The Commander-in-Chief's intention to penetrate the Centra l Mediterranean had been made clear, and with the Italian lines of communication with Africa intersecting the vital British east-west routes, any such penetration would make a major clash inevitable . Churchill's criticism appears to have been hasty and ill-founded . Within an hour of the outbreak of war, the bulk of Cunningham' s force was slipping for sea \"to secure control of communications in th e Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean \" . Sydney, with the 7th Cruise r Squadron, sailed at 1 a .m . on the 11th, and dawn found Alexandri a Harbour practically empty and the fleet under Cunningham in Warspite, with Malaya, Eagle, the five cruisers of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, and screening destroyers including Stuart, Vampire, and Voyager, sweeping t o the westward, while the French cruiser squadron headed north for th e • W.

The Australian destroyers did not remain long with the battl e fleet on this occasion . They were detached for Alexandria at 8 .15 p .m . on the 11th—being relieved on the screen by the more modern ships o f the 2nd Flotilla—and entered harbour at 11 o'clock the following morning . For four days the battle fleet, with the cruisers well in the van and th e battleships in support, searched the two areas without sighting any enem y ships or aircraft, although the westward sweep took the 7th Cruiser Squadron almost to the Gulf of Taranto . Sydney steamed over 2,000 miles in f the operation, during which the squadron carried out reconnaissance of Benghazi on the 12th and the Ionian islands on the 13th, rendezvousin g with the Commander-in-Chief at noon each day. Sydney's sole excitement was a fruitless depth-charge attack on a reported submarine in the after noon of the 13th, as she was sweeping south-eastward and along the African coast on the return to Alexandria . Liverpool and Gloucester were the only ships to come into action with the enemy . Detached to attack any sea forces at Tobruk, they shelled a flotilla of minesweepers off th e harbour, sinking one and drawing heavy fire from shore batteries . This episode was watched with interest by a British patrol of Hussars wh o had penetrated a hundred miles inside the enemy lines, and were on th e beach near by . The fleet returned to Alexandria late on the 14th, Sydney entering the harbour and securing at 7 o 'clock . For many of those who had not been in action before, this sweep wa s a period of nervous tension culminating in an anti-climax . As one office r in Sydney put it : I had pictured the Mediterranean alive with enemy submarines lurking in wai t for us at every turn, and I accordingly expected all kinds of \"fireworks\", but a t the end of those four days, when nothing at all had happened, I felt quite \"flat\" , and rather like the little boy who went to the circus to see the ferocious man-eatin g lion and found that it was only an overgrown cat anyway.\n\nThere were submarines about, however, and during this period an d the following days the ships of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla had a busy time with them . The first ship of the flotilla to gain submarine contact was Diamond, who on the 10th June unsuccessfully attacked a submarin e off Malta . On the 11th Decoy, on patrol off Alexandria, reported that sh e had attacked a submarine . In the early hours of the following mornin g the Italians drew first blood when a submarine torpedoed and san k Calypso6 of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, off Crete . Caledon, 7 and Dainty of the 10th Flotilla, were in company with her at the time, and brough t the survivors to Alexandria, where they arrived on the 13th . Meantim e a number of minefields had been discovered off Alexandria, denotin g the presence of minelaying submarines in the vicinity . Stuart, Vampire , Voyager and Waterhen proceeded on patrol from Alexandria in the late afternoon of the 12th, and- at 7 .40 p .m . Stuart, searching independently to seaward, sighted a moored mine on the surface, seventeen miles from Ras el Tin lighthouse . While examining it she detected by echoes numerou s HMS Calypso, cruiser (1917), 4,180 tons, five 6-in guns, eight 21-in torp tubes, 29 kts ; sun k south of Crete, 12 Jun 1940 . 7 HMS Caledon, cruiser (1917), 4,180 tons, five 6-in guns, eight 21-in torp tubes, 29 kts . 6\n\n158\n\nR .A .N .

Waller reported his find, and buoyed the positio n of the floating mine—which was in about 200 fathoms of water—an d throughout the night carried out a stealthy search of the area, seekin g further mines and the submarine laying them . Within two hours he ha d found a second minefield six miles from the first, and a further thre e miles on he found himself \"surrounded by mine echoes\", from which h e extricated Stuart with some difficulty in the darkness . For the rest o f the night he patrolled the vicinity, returning to his first buoyed mine a t daylight on the 13th . He was trying to sink it by rifle fire when, in th e clear water, a moored mine was sighted below the surface, almost along side Stuart amidships . There were some tense moments on board whil e Waller carefully manoeuvred with his engines and finally drew clear a s Abingdon and Bagshot8 of the 2nd Minesweeping Flotilla, appeared t o clear a channel for Caledon and Dainty, arriving from Crete . Stuart escorted Caledon and Dainty through the minefields, and then led th e sweepers to the fields, when \"they immediately began to bring up an d explode mines in the sweeps\". After a brief return to harbour to discuss the situation with the Rear Admiral 1st Battle Squadron and Rear-Admiral Alexandria, Waller re organised his destroyer patrols in view of the known mine position, while himself searching a hitherto unexplored area in Stuart . He was thus engaged shortly after dark on the 13th when a gun flash was sighted t o seaward. Waller closed the flash at full speed \"to be ready to join in\" , having first ordered Vampire, who had raced up enthused with simila r ideas, to resume his patrol . At 7 .53 p.m . Voyager, the source of the gun flash, reported a submarine 17 miles to seaward, and Dainty and Decoy, on the outer anti-submarine patrol, were ordered to close her and hunt . Stuart reached Voyager at 8 .35, and Waller found himself in the centr e of yet another minefield, which he reported and buoyed while warnin g the other ships of the flotilla to keep clear of him . In the meantime Morrow, in Voyager, reported that he had delivered three depth-charges on th e submarine which had been seen to surface on its side, that there had bee n muffled explosions from the enemy, which had been engaged with gu n fire, and that it had finally disappeared beneath the surface . Waller sen t Voyager and Decoy to warn ships of the new danger area, while he spen t two hours \"in getting myself out of the minefield\". Before Stuart wa s clear, Voyager—nearly out of depth charges—reported re-establishin g contact with the submarine on the bottom ; but by the time Waller reached her contact had been lost, and could not be regained . There followed a shouted discussion between the two ships by megaphone across the dar k waters, after which, as Waller put it, \"we decided the submarine wa s sunk, and went about our several duties\" . At the time this was assumed to be a submarine scalp to the Australia n destroyers, but in the final reckoning the claim of destruction was no t allowed, it being considered that the submarine, although damaged, 'HMS's Abingdon and Bagshot, minesweepers (1918-19), 710 tons, one 4-in gun, 16 kts.\n\n10-14 June\n\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN AND LIBYA\n\n15 9\n\nescaped . 9 Her identity was not conclusively established, but she is though t to have been the Italian Foca l—a minelaying submarine—or one of her class, which was later learned to have been in the approaches to Alexandria at the time . According to a later Italian statement, Foca wa s destroyed on the 23rd October 1940, presumably by a mine of unestablished origin. The \"several duties\" of Stuart and Voyager included further attacks on a submarine before the night was over . At 1 .30 a .m. on the 14th June Voyager reported expending the remainder of her depth charges on anothe r contact, which was confirmed later by Stuart, who also attacked with depth charges, as did Decoy . No direct evidence of destruction was avail able in the darkness, but daylight disclosed a large oil patch extendin g over a two-mile strip in the vicinity of Stuart's attack . Again the destruction of the submarine was not credited in the final analysis . But the work done by the flotilla in discovering, and determining th e position and extent of the minefields, was invaluable . Throughout the 14th , all the available ships of the flotilla searched out an approved channel for the main fleet returning in the afternoon from its four days ' sweep ; and the Italian expenditure of effort and mines in an endeavour to block the approaches to the base and to cause ship casualties, went for nothing . V When Italy entered the war, the British staff in the Middle East estimated that enemy troops in Libya totalled over 215,000 . For some weeks after the outbreak the Italians made no attempt to cross the frontier, and on shore, as at sea, the initiative was taken by the British, a small detachment crossing the frontier on the night of the 11th-12th June in the firs t of a series of harrying operations . The foremost British defended positions were at Mersa Matruh—the railhead—and the frontier force therefore operated at a distance of at least 120 miles from its point of supply an d administration . The Italians were better placed with the port of Bardia , believed to be strongly held and the chief supply base for their force s on the frontier, only six miles or so within the Libyan border . To help the army in its harrying operations, it was decided to carry out a nava l bombardment of Bardia to destroy military objectives . The Italians were believed to have six or eight 6-inch guns or 8-inch guns on the cliffs north and south of the harbour, and a number of mobile howitzers and som e long-range anti-aircraft guns . Considerable enemy air forces, and som e cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were at Tobruk, some seventy miles to the west . Plans were made for a pre-arranged area shoot by the ships participatin g in the bombardment, the targets to be covered by a heavy neutralising fire . In addition to the bombarding forces, five destroyers carried out an White Paper : (1946) . 3\n\nGerman, Italian and Japanese U-Boat Casualties during the War.

The bombardment force, consisting of Orion—wearing the flag of Vice Admiral Tovey—Neptune and Sydney of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, the French battleship Lorraine, and the destroyers Stuart, Decoy, Dainty, and Hasty,2 sailed from Alexandria at 11 .30 a .m . on the 20th June, and arrived off Bardia a few minutes before sunrise the following morning . Tovey had decided to make the last twenty miles or so of his approach in the daw n light, and to attack while the sun was still low enough to dazzle th e Italian gunners ; and the lighthouse on Point Bluff, the south cliff, wa s the only object clearly discernible through the haze when the force close d the coast on a south-westerly course, the large ships spaced a mile apar t on a line of bearing in the order Orion, Lorraine, Neptune, Sydney, with two destroyers on the outer bow of each wing ship . Orion opened fire o n Point Bluff at about 13,500 yards at 5 .48 a .m . and was followed by th e other ships firing on their allotted targets . Course was altered to the southeastward shortly after fire was opened, and the bombardment continue d for twenty-two minutes, when the force withdrew to the north-eastward . Sydney fired at one target throughout, a camp in the centre of her area . She started a fire there, and apparently caused losses among troops see n to leave the camp during the shoot . Stuart and Decoy concentrated o n barracks and wireless masts in the left half of the town, at a range o f about 12,000 yards . Waller commented later that in opening fire at thi s range he had in view merely the moral effect on his guns' crews an d ship's company generally, and \"the effective neutralising fire produced , assuming 4 .7-inch shells capable of doing material damage ashore, wa s therefore in the nature of a pleasant surprise \" . According to members o f Stuart's ship's company, months later when Bardia had fallen to the Britis h forces, fragments of 4 .7-inch shell of the type Stuart had fired were found in her target area . The Italians made no reply to the fire, and the squadron could se e no coast defence guns in position . Each of the large ships had a spottin g aircraft aloft, and a few ineffectual rounds fired at these from anti-aircraf t guns was the only opposition encountered. The sole casualty suffered b y the bombarding force was that of Sydney's amphibian aircraft, which, as Tovey put it in his remarks on the operation, was \"shot up by friendl y fighters\", of the Royal Air Force . Although the aircraft was badly damaged , the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Price, 3 R .A .A .F., managed to fly it to Mers a Matruh, where it broke up on landing, but with no injury to pilot o r observer . 4 HMS Hasty, destroyer (1936), 1,340 tons, four 4 .7-in guns, four 21-in torp tubes, 36 kts; sunk by German submarine, E Mediterranean, 15 Jun 1942. s W Cdr T.

From what could be seen from th e ships and judged subsequently from air photographs, the bombardmen t destroyed some ammunition and other storehouses, blew up an ammunitio n dump, and damaged or set fire to barracks and buildings in and nea r the town . Cunningham described it as \"a useful minor operation, in whic h the damage caused fully justified the ammunition expended\" . The force returned to Alexandria at 10 .40 p .m . on the day of the bombardment. Possibly as a reprisal, the Italians delivered their first air raid on the port early the following morning. Some bombs exploded no t far from Sydney's berth, but no damage was suffered by any ships . VI The first bombardment of Bardia was the last operation against th e Italians in which Admiral Godfroy's French squadron took part . On the 22nd June the French Government signed an armistice with Germany, and the naval situation in the Mediterranean underwent a drastic change . Hitherto the Anglo-French Fleets had dominated the sea, and consider able stretches of European and African coastline, with major fleet bases , had been important factors in that domination . Now in one stroke the greatest proportion of the French Navy was eliminated or might be use d against Britain . Clause Eight of the armistice terms provided that : The French Fleet, except that part of it left free for the safeguard of Frenc h interests in the Colonial Empire, shall be collected in ports to be specified , demobilised, and disarmed under German or Italian control . The German Government solemnly declare that they have no intention of using for their own purpose during the war the French Fleet stationed in ports under German control, excep t those units necessary for coast supervision and minesweeping . Except for that part (to be determined) of the Fleet destined for the protection of colonial interests, al l ships outside French territorial waters must be recalled to France .\n\nThis meant that the ships had to be handed over as fighting units, an d as such would be at enemy disposition . The French metropolitan an d African coastlines and harbours—with those of Syria—were now denie d to the British Fleet . The scales had thus dipped suddenly and heavily in Italy's favour . It was a situation in which the suggestion that the flee t should be withdrawn from the Eastern Mediterranean was again brough t forward at the Admiralty . It was argued that Alexandria was an unsatisfactory base which probably would be exposed to increasingly sever e attack from German as well as Italian aircraft ; and that the increase d German surface raider activity resulting from the enemy's use of Frenc h Atlantic ports would likely demand the use of battleships (which coul d only be found from the Mediterranean Fleet) for convoy escort purposes . The suggestion was, however, strongly opposed by the British Prim e Minister and by Admiral Cunningham, and nothing more was heard of it . Its acceptance would, in Cunningham's opinion, \"have been a major disaster, nothing less\" .\n\n22-30 June\n\nFORCE\n\n\" H\"\n\n163\n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean the major units of Admiral Godfroy's force were in Alexandria, whence permission to sail was refused by Cunningham—at which refusal Godfroy appeared thankful . In the Western Mediterranean the French defection left the sea entirely unprotected . O n the 25th June the Commander-in-Chief, North Atlantic, Admiral North, 5 pointed out to the Admiralty that there were now no forces betwee n Gibraltar and the Italian Fleet base . Three days later the Admiralty repaire d this situation by constituting a detached squadron—Force \"H\"—under the command of Vice-Admiral Somerville, 6 to be based on Gibraltar. This force consisted of the capital ships Hood, Resolution and Valiant ; the aircraft carrier Ark Royal ; the cruiser Arethusa ; and the destroyers Faulknor, Foxhound, Fearless, Escapade, Forester, Foresight and Escort . ? Its tasks were to prevent units of the Italian Fleet from breaking out of th e Mediterranean, and to carry out offensive operations against the Italia n Fleet and Italian coasts . Somerville hoisted his flag in Hood at Gibralta r on the 30th of the month. VII Admiral Cunningham was thus deprived of the services of the Frenc h force at a time when an important operation in the Eastern Mediterranean imposed a severe strain on his resources . This operation—MA.3—wa s designed to protect simultaneous movements of a slow convoy from th e Aegean, and a fast convoy and a slow from Malta, to Egyptian ports . It resulted in the first surface clash with the Italian Navy, and include d Australian ships . Timing of the movements was planned so that the three convoys would be in the vicinity of 35 degrees north, 22 degrees east position \"K \" , almost due south of Cape Matapan in Greece, and a little more tha n halfway from Alexandria to Malta—on the 30th June . Here a strong supporting force comprising Royal Sovereign (wearing the flag of Rear Admiral Pridham-Wippell, 8 Rear-Admiral 1st Battle Squadron), Ramillies, Eagle, and seven destroyers would be in position .

In close escort of the Aegean convoy were to be Capetown9 (flag of Rear-Admiral Renouf) and Caledon of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, and four destroyers, Garland, Nubian , Mohawk, and Vampire.'° In addition to these main dispositions, destroyer s would be submarine hunting as circumstances required, and air reconnaissance of the Ionian Sea would be carried out by Sunderland flying boats of No . 201 Group, R .A .F., operating from Malta . At 6 p .m . on the 26th June, Caledon, Garland and Vampire sailed from Alexandria and joined Capetown, Nubian and Mohawk at sea the following day on passage to the Dardanelles . At eleven the following morning, Tovey , in general charge of the operation and flying his flag in Orion, left Alexandria with the 7th Cruiser Squadron and shaped course for positio n \"K\" . The Aegean force picked up its convoy of eleven ships on the 28th , and began the southern voyage to Egypt. Early that afternoon, when the 7th Cruiser Squadron was in th e vicinity of position \"K\", Tovey received a signal from flying-boat L .580 6 reporting three Italian destroyers in a position 30 miles south-west of th e island of Zante, which lay some 150 miles just to the west of north o f him . The signal did not state the destroyers' course, and Tovey, thinkin g they might be steering south-east for the Kithera Channel between Greec e and Crete, altered course to the north to intercept them . That was a t ten minutes past four . Half an hour later the destroyers were again reported, this time by flying-boat L .5803, in a position 35 miles west of Orion and steering south . Tovey immediately altered course to south-west , increased speed to 25 knots, and formed the squadron on a line of bearin g 180 degrees in open order, with the 2nd Division—Gloucester and Liverpool—stationed five miles 180 degrees from the 1st . Orion's position a t 5 o'clock was approximately 60 miles west-south-west of Cape Matapan . For an hour and a half the squadron sped swiftly over a glittering , slightly choppy sea, with a fresh wind broad on the starboard bow . At 6 .30 Liverpool, the southernmost ship, reported the enemy destroyers in sight bearing 235 degrees from Orion . Three minutes later she opened fire . The 1st Division increased to full speed and altered course to clos e the enemy, who was at this time on a converging course ; but at 6 .5 0 Gloucester reported the Italians—still invisible from Orion—to have altered course to west-south-west, speed 30 knots . Four minutes later Orion sighte d the destroyers—Espero, Zeffiro, and Ostro l , of the Turbine class—an d opened fire at one minute to seven at a range of 18,000 yards .

With the wind fine on the bow, the Italians made clever use of smoke, making ranging and spotting difficult for their pursuers . With the sighting from Orion, all ships came into action . The spacing of the two divisions of the 7th Cruiser Squadron placed the enemy unde r fire from each quarter, while he directed his fire on Liverpool and Gloucester to port and Orion to starboard . At five minutes past seven Neptune reported that the enemy had fired torpedoes, and course wa s altered for three minutes to comb the \"spread\" . By 7 .20 the range wa s down to 14,000 yards, and the 1st Division altered course 50 degree s to starboard to open \"A\" arcs . 2 Shortly after this Espero was seen to be hit, and at 8 o'clock she was disabled and stopped . For about ten minute s the chase of the other two destroyers continued, but then Tovey broke off the engagement, as light was failing and ammunition was running short . The squadron then shaped course for Malta, and Tovey detache d Sydney, to sink Espero, with discretion to stop and pick up survivors . Sydney accordingly headed for the destroyer, but when about 6,000 yard s distant, two shots from the enemy were observed to fall, 200 yards shor t but in line with the cruiser . Collins had no option but to open fire, and hits on the enemy were observed from four salvos, to which no reply wa s made, and Espero was seen to be on fire amidships and forward . At 8 .3 5 Sydney was stopped 2,000 yards astern of Espero, whose end was near . In the glare of flames men could be seen jumping overboard from her ; there was an explosion in the vicinity of the bridge ; and at twenty to nine she listed almost on to her beam ends, and sank in about 1,400 fathoms , in position 35 degrees 18 minutes north, 20 degrees 12 minutes east . Fro m the depths that swallowed her thudded a series of explosions, probabl y caused by the detonation of her depth charges . For nearly an hour and three quarters Sydney remained in the vicinity , with both cutters lowered, and Jacob's ladders, boatswain's chairs, an d heaving lines over the side to aid survivors . From the dark waters aroun d her, cries for help could be heard in all directions as the rescue work went on . Her position was one of considerable risk. Submarines were about, and the flames from Espero must have been visible for many miles . At nineteen minutes past ten, after having been warned by signal tha t dispatch was necessary, and having picked up all survivors in sight, she proceeded to rejoin the squadron . Before doing so, however, she slippe d a cutter with oars, sails, provisions, water and rifles, and burned a 10-inc h signalling projector on it as she steamed away, to enable any survivor s still in the water to make for it. The rescue work was hampered by the darkness and the fact tha t Sydney herself had to remain blacked out . But forty-seven Italians were taken from the water, of whom three died on the passage to Alexandri a where the remainder—three officers and forty-one ratings—were landed . From the prisoners it was learned that Espero and her consorts were o n a \"To open\n\n'A\n\n'\n\n\"\n\narcs : to bring all main armament to bear.\n\nR.A.N . SHIPS OVERSEAS JUNE-DECEMBER 1940 June-July 166 passage from Taranto to Libya with troops and stores when they wer e intercepted ; that Espero had about 225 of ship's complement and passengers on board ; and that her captain had been killed by the explosion i n the vicinity of the bridge . The survivors were well treated by Sydney' s people . As one of her officers later recalled : By the next morning it was a common sight to see our lads shepherding group s of survivors around the ship, looking after all their wants, giving them all th e cigarettes they could smoke and treating them to ice-cream and \"goffers\" (sof t drinks) from the canteen .\n\nNo damage save that resulting from the concussion of their own salvoe s was suffered by the ships of the squadron . In Sydney, when the action wa s joined , most messes had their tables set ready for the evening meal . The first salvo starte d the wrecking process and from then on until the end of the chase things went fro m bad to worse. With each salvo the ship shuddered violently and the air becam e filled with dust and fluff. Light bulbs began to burst with popping noises, showerin g us with tiny splinters, and from all around came the crashing of objects of al l shapes and sizes and the tinkling of falling glass . Every movable object—including a few we thought immovable–was shaken from its resting place during the action . What a din and what a mess . 3\n\nMorning showed the muzzles of the guns stripped of paint, which hun g in long reddish-grey streamers almost to the deck . This action brought home a lesson, and emphasised a weakness in th e Mediterranean Fleet . To achieve the destruction of Espero the 7th Cruiser Squadron had indulged in what Admiral Cunningham described as th e excessive expenditure of nearly 5,000 rounds of 6-inch ammunition . I n eagerness to secure a decisive result in a race against night in this firs t surface action, no regard had been paid to the peacetime experience o f the low rate of hitting to be expected in the conditions of a chase in failin g light of small vessels dodging and making smoke, at ranges of betwee n 18,000 and 14,000 yards . \"We have learnt our lesson, \" said Cunningham in a subsequent signal to the Admiralty, to whom he had a few days earlie r remarked : \"Assume it has not been overlooked that cruisers have not eve n an outfit of ammunition on board and reserves still some way off .\" As it was, the expenditure of ammunition in this instance necessitated the retur n of the 2nd Division of the squadron to Port Said to replenish. Operatio n MA .3 had to be abandoned incomplete, and the sailing of the Malta convoys was postponed . The Aegean convoy, however, reached Alexandri a and Port Said on the 2nd and 3rd July respectively without loss, thoug h it had been subjected to high level bombing attacks by aircraft from th e Dodecanese Islands on the 29th and 30th June, and the 1st July . It wa s on this last day that Sydney and the ships of the 1st Division reache d Alexandria, having also undergone air attack without damage on th e return journey. As part of operation MA .3, ships of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla Wer e meanwhile engaged in activities resulting in the sinking of two Italia n • Ross, Stormy Petrel, p . 124.\n\n27 June-1 July\n\nDESTROYER FLOTILLA\n\n16 7\n\nsubmarines . At dawn on the 27th June Voyager sailed from Alexandri a with her flotilla companions Dainty, Decoy, and Defender, and Ilex 4 of the 2nd Flotilla . At sunset Alexandria lay 200 miles astern of them, an d at 6 .28, when about 100 miles south-east of Crete, a surfaced submarine —which shortly submerged—was sighted on the horizon . The destroyer s quickly closed the position, and within a few minutes five depth-charg e attacks were made by Dainty, Decoy, Defender and Ilex . An oil trail was observed, and was followed by Dainty in the falling darkness, and after a hunt of ninety minutes the submarine was again reported on the surfac e at 2,500 yards . During the intervening period—as was subsequently learne d —the submarine, the Console Generale Liuzzi, had been badly shaken by the initial attacks . The first had put all lights out except in the contro l room, had shattered depth gauges, and blown the naphthalene tank fro m the bulkhead . The second had done further damage, including the entry of water into the after compartment, which had gassed the batteries . Thi s combination of mishaps made Liuzzi immobile when she surfaced, as ther e was insufficient battery power to start the engines, and no alternativ e naphthalene . As soon as she was again sighted, she came under gun fir e from Dainty and Defender, and very soon a white light was waved as a token of surrender. Cease fire was ordered, and Dainty closed the sub marine, whose officers and crew were in the conning tower ; and the wor k of removing them, and of picking up those who jumped overboard, began . The destroyers lowered boats—Voyager's whaler picked up thirteen survivors—and Dainty put her bows almost up to the submarine before the last two Italians could be persuaded to jump into the water . In all , it took three and a quarter hours to induce the more reluctant to leave the submarine after the surrender ; and she was then sunk by Dainty with depth charges . By dawn on the 29th the five destroyers were nearly 400 miles farthe r west, with Crete 160 miles due east of them, when another surfaced sub marine was sighted . She was the Uebi Scebeli, which dived and was attacked with depth charges by Ilex, Voyager, and Defender ; and, force d to the surface, was sunk by gun fire from Dainty at 8 .20 after survivors had been rescued . Five minutes later the destroyers proceeded for Alexandria, and entered the harbour in the evening of the 30th, Voyager securing at 7 .34 and landing her survivors . Information provided by the prisoners from Liuzzi and Uebi Scebeli indicated the presence of an Italian submarine patrol line between Cret e and the African coast, and on the 29th June Stuart and Hostiles sailed from Alexandria to hunt north of Derna . A submerged submarine wa s located during the morning of the 1st July, and the two destroyers carrie d out a series of depth charge attacks which—from the evidence of th e discharge of large quantities of air, and the fading of the echo, believe d as a result of the great depth to which the submarine sank—were at th e ' HMS\n\nIlex, destroyer (1937), 1,370 tons, four 4 .7-in guns, five 21-in torp tubes, 36 kts. 5 HMS Hostile, destroyer (1936), 1,340 tons, four 4 .7-in guns, four 21-in torp tubes, 36 kts ; mined and sunk off Cape Bon, in Mediterranean, 23 Aug 1940 .\n\n168\n\nR .A.N .\n\nSHIPS OVERSEAS JUNE-DECEMBER\n\n1940\n\nJune-July\n\ntime assumed to have destroyed her .

On the 28th June, Ciano recorded in his Diary that Admiral Cavagnari , the Italian Chief of Naval Staff, complains of the High Command . There is disorder, and no one assumes responsibility.
