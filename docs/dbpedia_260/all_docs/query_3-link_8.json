        "text": "The British cruiser HMS Orion of 7215 tons displacement commissioned in 1934. During the Second World War Orion was part of the British naval forces in the Caribbean before transferring to the Mediterranean to become the flagship of the 7th Cruiser Squadron in May 1940. In this role, Orion wore the flag of Vice Admiral Tovey who held the appointment of Vice Admiral Light Forces. As part of the British Mediterranean Fleet, ships of the 7th Cruiser Squadron participated in the bombardment of Italian forces at Bardia in Libya on 20 June 1940. While on convoy escort duties on 30 June 1940, Orion was in action against three Italian destroyers in the course of which, one was sunk (the Italian destroyer Espero). Orion then continued on escort duties for Malta convoys. In early 1941, Orion was part of the British naval force giving support to troops for the occupation of Greece and later for evacuation of those troops from Greece and later from Crete. Ships including Orion engaged in the final evacuation of troops from Crete on 29 May 1941 were subject to repeated air attacks and Orion sustained severe damage and was put out of action.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
