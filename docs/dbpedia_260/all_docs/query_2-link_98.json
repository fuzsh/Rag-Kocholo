        "text": "And so what? If the RN is within 100 yards of the invasion barges then the barges are dead. You cherry pick an example with completely different circumstances to try and make it look like the RN couldn't hit the barges but then cheerily pretend its plausible that an 88mm gun on a barge that is pitching and rolling, manned by a crew with no experience of naval gunnery, is a serious threat to an RN Destroyer.\n\nThat's two different gunnery cases, both of which will apply to the same hypothetical sea battle, but at different points.\n\nThe destroyer has to get by the escort first, to get at the invasion convoy. In the Espero battle, the RN fired 5,000 rounds to sink one warship, with two others escaping. This suggests that ammunition usage may be more copious than you think in the contact phase because RN shooting was just as lousy as everyone else's in the period prior to radar directed gunfire.\n\nOnce past the escort, the destroyer will have the choice of what range to engage the 4kt invasion units. Let's say it is approaching a formation of barges, tugs, and misc types, with 20 ad hoc army mounted guns of 50-88mm. At 500 yards an 88 might hit the destroyer 1 time in 50. It would be lucky to get 5 shots per minute. At 1,000 yards, the apparent size of the destroyer is 4 times smaller, suggesting that the 88mm might hit 1 time in 200. At 100 yards the destroyer's apparent size is 25 times larger than at 500 yards. The 88 might hit the destroyer 25 times in 50.\n\nThe destroyer at 1,000 yards should be able to sink an individual barge in 10 salvos or less - call it maybe 3 minutes, 50 rounds in total.\n\nSo, for the proposed battery of 20 pieces firing at 5 rounds per minute, at 1,000 yards, they might score 1-2 hits on the destroyer in three minutes. At 500 yards, something around 4-8 hits. If the destroyer were to approach to within your 100 yards against the hypothetical defensive batteries of 20 pieces, the destroyer is taking dozens of hits per minute.\n\nIf the DD engages at 1,000 yards it is relatively immune to counterfire. But if it comes to your \"100 yards\" against an invasion group that has several dozen pieces itself, it will be hit by a large volume of shells, quite probably, sunk. Of what value to an RN captain would there be in such tactics? At 1,000 yards he can pick off barges with impunity. At 100 yards his ship is riddled and a large portion of his crew is dead or wounded.\n\nYou worked your way through 53 pages and you've managed to offer not one compelling argument or plausible suggestion to make Sealion credible.\n\nWhat made Sealion credible was the fact that it was in place and ready to execute by about mid-September, 1940. Sealion was therefore no more, and no less credible than the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938.\n\nThat's two different gunnery cases, both of which will apply to the same hypothetical sea battle, but at different points.\n\nThe destroyer has to get by the escort first, to get at the invasion convoy.

Sealion was therefore no more, and no less credible than the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938.\n\nHe meant the success of Sealion. One can run 1,000 trucks into the ocean with credible reliability. Having those trucks cross the ocean is not credible.\n\nThe RAF will be fighting the Luftwaffe, surely?\n\nRAF Bomber command is going to attack the invasion forces all out, in their assembly ports, in the Channel, on the beaches.\n\nRAF Fighter command has to provide combat air patrols over RN warships, escort RAF bombers, and protect its own airfields.\n\nAlso where are we getting 320 plus Kreigsmarine escorts from?\n\nThere were something like 10 KM destroyers and 80 odd other KM warships of various size and speed screening the invasion, all with 4\" and better, many with torpedoes. On top of that there were something like 10 flotillas of aux. warships - slow minelayers, minesweepers, trawlers, that sort of thing. Nothing that could take on a destroyer, probably not with anything as big as 4\", but out there laying mines, sweeping mines, armed, and shooting back. Many of them, plus hundreds of motor boats, thrust out ahead of the invasion where they'll all draw attention. This thread - does it have even the slightest idea how bloody confusing this battle would be in daylight, let alone at night?â€‹\n\nRiddled with WHAT Glenn? Save yourWheraboo fantasies. There's a world of difference between a stable platform like a destroyer and a gun that's lashed to a flat bottomed barge. What's going to shoot at them? The artillery in the hold? Please do as you'll be shooting through the side of the barge first. The Panzers? Again, flat bottom barge. With gunners on them who are probably sea sick and the such inside their metal boxes that are swaying and rocking constantly with unstabalized guns.\n\nAnd the gunners, for the most part are use to shooting when in a fixed position. Not on a rocking and swaying boat in the dark.\n\nSeriously, what is going to shoot back? Are these legions of little escorts you keep blathering about suddenly going to growl 4.1 and 5-inch guns and blast the english at short range? Are there secret batteries of wire guided missiles that didn't exist until you wanked them into existence suddenly going to cripple the british, and are the germans going to be able to cover every aspect of approach of the convoy as they get swarmed by anything the RN lobs at them coming from all directions? In your mind apparently so!\n\nIf D-Day had landed in England in September 1940 it would have chopped the defenses to pieces and broken out towards London in less than a day. British reserves would have been mopped up wholesale trying to move towards Dover, and the entire British front would have been torn open on a 50 or 75 miles front within 72 hours of D-Day. That's how much stronger the German army was in France in June 1944 than the British army was in England in September 1940.\n\nI'll start at page 55 tomorrow.\n\nAnd if Sealion had landed in England (note not France) in September 1940 they would be lucky to get off the beaches within 24 hours and certainly would not have broken out towards London within a day or any day unless you count German POW's being moved north\n\nIt would have been a mainly light infantry force many times smaller than the defenders.\n\nNow I am sure that a good German unit could probably route march 50 - 75 miles in 3 days - so long as it has logistics and no enemy trying to stop it.\n\nIt would have been a cluster - I am sure a professional army like the Heer would have made a go of it - but with no operational experience or equipment or training for Amphibious ops it would have been a disaster - verse an enemy that is locally stronger - has armour, artillery and logistics and access to the local transport network with a friendly population when the Heer would not have any that - the planners and decision makers of Sealion knew all of this which is why it never went ahead.\n\nThe only fashion in which Germany could successfully invade the UK is via an administrative landing if Britain throws in the towel and agrees to a German Garrison which we know is very unlikely to have happened."
