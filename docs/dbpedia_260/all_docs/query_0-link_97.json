Wartime Aviation Art Music: George Fenton Theme: &quot; Memphis Belle &quot; World War 2 Click to turn pages\n\n2. HIGH FLIGHT – Keith Ferris Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth, And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; Sunwards I’ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirth Of sun-split clouds - and done a thousand things You have not dreamed of - wheeled and soared and swung High in the sunlit silence. Hovering there, I’ve chased the shouting wind along and flung My eager craft through footless halls of air, Up, up the long delirious burning blue I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace, Where never lark, or even eagle, flew; And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod The high untrespassed sanctity of space, Put out my hand, and touched the face of God. John Gillespie Magee RCAF ( † Dec 11, 1941) Compuso este poema tras un vuelo de alta cota en su Spitfire. Pocos días después falleció.\n\n3. FOURTH MISSION OF THE DAY – Gil Cohen\n\n4.

This image shows one of his kills, this time by tipping over the V-1 flying bomb that was headed for London. This would make the V-1 crash as it had no ailerons or internal systems that could compensate for this imbalance.\n\n14. CAUGHT ON THE SURFACE - Robert Taylor JUL 1943 - A Sunderland of 461 Sqn RAAF, identification letter U, destroys submarine U-461, a type XIV tanker, one of three German submarines caught on the surface by Allied aircraft in the Bay of Biscay on July 30, 1943.

AMBUSH - Heinz Krebs German Me 262 jet fighters, were vulnerable to fighter attacks during take-off and landing. To counteract mounting losses special units were formed to provide cover. In order to make these aircraft clearly discernable to the German anti-aircraft gunners, their undersides were painted red with white stripes, thus the legend of the &quot;parrot wing&quot; was born. One of this unit's elements was the so-called &quot;strangler swarm&quot; led by Lt. Heino Sachsenberg seen here in his Focke Wulf 190 Dora 9, as he attempts to protect the approaching jet fighters from the P.51 Mustangs' attack.\n\n24. BLACK FRIDAY - Mark Postlethwaite 9 FEB 1945 - At 14.00 on February 9 1945, 31 Bristol Beaufighters of 445 (RAAF), 404(RCAF) and 144 Squadron (RAF) took off for a strike against a small German Naval Force hidden in Fordefjord.

The B-17G, 42-38050, “Thunder Bird” of the 303rd Bomb Group, based at Molesworth, England, is seen at 11:45 AM, 15 August 1944, over Trier, Germany, on its return to base from a mission to Weisbaden. B-17Gs “Bonnie B”, “Special Delivery”, and “Marie”, are seen below as a Messerschmitt 109G and Focke Wulf FW 190 attack “Thunder Bird’s” element. Jeff Ethell’s research for the mural revealed the names and aircraft identities of all U.S. and many German participants in this battle in which the 303rd lost nine Fortresses in this attack by Luftwaffe fighters.\n\n29. LEO OF THE ZODIAC BOMBERS - Roy Grinnell 1944 – Painting on the nose of one of the B-24 Liberators of the famous 834 'Zodiac Squadron‘ of the 486 Bomb Group based at Sudbury in England, which had Zodiac signs on every plane.\n\n30.

In just 4 minutes Douglas Dauntless dive-bombers from the Enterprise and Yorktown, destroy the Japanese carriers Kaga, Akagi and Soryu.\n\n34. INTO THE TEETH OF THE TIGER - William Phillips There’s more than one way to bring down an opposing fighter, as 1st Lt. Don Lopez learned on December 12, 1943. He and his comrades of the 75th Fighter Squadron were at 6,000 feet over South Central China when the young airman experienced his first scramble. Lopez ripped his P-40 into the middle of a flight of Japanese “Oscars” and quickly engaged one of them, flying directly at one another, firing steady hits. Lopez expected his opponent to break off, but neither did so. Head-on only a few feet apart, the Oscar swerved right … too late. Lopez lost three feet off the end of his wing, but the Japanese pilot lost substantially more, including control of his aircraft, which plunged toward the earth. Undaunted, Lopez pressed the attack again and scored enough victories to join the ranks of “ace” fighter pilot.\n\n35. FIRST KILL- Roy Grinnell SEP 1st 1939 – On the f irst day of WW2 2nd Lt. Wladek Gnys in his gull-winged PLZP-11 fighter shot down two Dornier Do-17E over the pre-dawn skies of Poland as the Germans launched their surprise attack on his country.\n\n36.

RAID ON THE CHINA COAST - Roy Grinnell APRIL 1945 - The plane shown is Lady Lil of the Air Apaches 345th Bomb Group, 498th Bomb Squadron, a B-25 piloted by Lt. Albert J. Beiga as he attacks Japanese shipping off the coast of China, between Amoy and Swatow, west of Formosa.\n\n38. STAR OF AFRICA - Heinz Krebs Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Marseille, known as the Star of Africa, was probably the most formidable opponent the British ever encountered in the air. He was victorious in 158 aerial combats against the Royal Air Force, 154 of which were fighter aircraft. Marseille died undefeated whilst bailing out of his Me 109 which had developed an engine problem on the return leg of an uneventful sortie. Marseille is seen here at the moment of his 150th aerial victory on September 15th, 1942, when he fought and defeated no less than seven Curtiss Kittyhawk fighters in an incredible eleven minutes.\n\n39. SHARK SIGHTING - John D. Shaw 1942 - Kunming, China. Before the pilots of the legendary 1st American Volunteer Group ‘The Flying Tigers’ could take to the skies against the enemy, the all-important task of boresighting the .30 caliber wing guns of their P-40's had to take place! Their ingenious armourers were often forced to improvise, but as the Tigers' incredible combat record can attest, these great Americans got the job done! Artist John D. Shaw has recreated this scenario, featuring likenesses of actual AVG personnel, such as &quot;Tex&quot; Hill and armourer Chuck Baisden.\n\n40. ONE MAN AIR FORCE - Wade Meyers Captain Don S. Gentile of the Debden-based 336th Fighter Squadron manoeuvers his P-51B-7-NA Mustang 'Shangri-La' while engaging an FW-190A-7 on April 8, 1944. For his actions this day, Gentile was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, America's second highest award for valor in combat. General Dwight D. Eisenhower presented the award personally, and when introduced to the young fighter pilot, Eisenhower remarked, 'You seem to be a one-man air force!'\n\n41. OPEN ASSAULT - Robert Taylor The Junkers Ju87 Sturzkampfbomber, known to the British simply as the Stuka, had a deadly reputation, its siren screaming as the ungainly dive-bomber struck terror into the hearts of those below. In 1940 they crossed the Channel to terrorise the southern towns and ports of England. Robert Taylors painting Open Assault, depicts Hurricanes of 501 Squadron attacking a force of Ju87 Stukas as they dive-bomb naval vessels and installations in the port of Dover on 29 July 1940. Four Stukas and two Me109s are dispatched, for the loss of just one RAF aircraft.\n\n42. DAVID AND GOLIATH – Roberto Zanella JUN 1943 – A Macchi MC205 Veltro from A Squadron 'Ace of Wands' shoots down a B-17G over Italy.\n\n43. OPERATION CERBERUS - Philip West The Channel Dash (officially known as Operation Cerberus) was one of three operations during the Second World War for which the Fairey Swordfish was to become the most famous. Heavily outgunned in the Straits of Dover on this day, February 11, 1942 by the German warships Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen, with their accompanying flotilla of destroyers and motor torpedo boats, and with top cover provided by deadly fighter aircraft of the Luftwaffe, all six Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish were shot down.

All across western Europe airfields are thrown into chaos as the Luftwaffe unleashes a desperate surprise offensive to destroy allied air power on the ground. 'Operation Bodenplatte' would instead result in the death knell for the once formidable German air force. However there were some successes, Eindhoven the home of the RAF's 2nd TAF was hit hard, firstly by Jg-3 and then in a case of mistaken identity by Jg-6. Here, the airfield is already burning from the first attack when Jg-6's 1st Gruppe race across the airfield causing even more damage. Red '12' belonged to Ewald Trost, he was luckier than most as his aircraft was shot down but he survived and was taken prisoner. Ironically the 1st Gruppe was to enjoy the most success for Jg-6 that day, the rest of the unit couldn't find their designated target at Volkel and as a result found themselves simply trying to stay alive and get home.\n\n48.
