He was from Oregon and attended the university at Eugene, Oregon either Univ of Oregon or Oregon State before being drafted into the military. I left Vietnam in October of 1966 and do not know what happened to Don or Donald Herrman. We were great friends than and it would be good to connect. Shortly after I left Vietnam, I understand our outfit got overrun by the Viet Cong and about 25 of our man were killed, I'm hoping Don was not among them. Master Sgt Murphy was our person in command. I was trained as a 05C40 Radio teletype specialist before being put in charge of the crpto, I do not know what Donn's initial mos was. A side note, because I was Crypto, I was sent by Chinook helicopter to Cu Chi on arrival at Vietnam. During our units convoy f! rom Long Binh to Cu Chi, they were attacked by the Viet Cong and a rocket was put through the vehicle assigned to me and our first casualities were in that vehicle, one of the casualites was Charlie Reed, from Lousianna, I do not know if any of this will be useful, but I'm hoping it will be.
