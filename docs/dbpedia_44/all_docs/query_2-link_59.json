For us creating The Wayland was an amazing confluence of events, including finding what we believe is the best location in Manhattan and one of the greatest bar teams in the industry today. Situated between 2 community gardens on Alphabet City’s Avenue C, The Wayland feels like a country retreat while still being centered in one of NYC’s most vibrant urban neighborhoods. We hope that you enjoy our bar as much as we do.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.theWaylandnyc.com\n\nExternal link for The Wayland\n\nIndustry\n\nRestaurants\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nNew York, NY\n\nType\n\nPartnership\n\nFounded\n\n2012\n\nSpecialties\n\nCraft Cocktail Service, Live Music, and Late Night Food"
