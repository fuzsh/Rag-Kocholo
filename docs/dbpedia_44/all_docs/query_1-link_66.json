DESCRIPTION : THIS IS THE FIRST DERIVATIVE OF THE SAMUEL LEWIS MAP OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND (SEE MAP # 294L5). IT WAS REENGRAVED BY D. MARTIN FOR INCLUSION IN WILLIAM WINTERBOTHAM'S THE AMERICAN ATLAS, NEW YORK: 1796 AND WILLIAM WINTERBOTHAM'S AN HISTORICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, COMMERCIAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PAPENFUSE & COALE NOTE THAT WHOLE SECTIONS ON MARYLAND IN WINTERBOTHAM'S BOOK WERE WORD FOR WORD FROM MORSE. ALL THE NOMENCLATURE IS THE SAME AS THE LEWIS MAP EXCEPT THAT THIS MAP OMITS SEVERAL NAMES OF ISLANDS, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY SHADING IN THE RIVERS AND BAYS. POOLS I., SHARPS I., AND OYSTER I. ARE OMITTED. SHOALS ARE SHOWN IN DOTTED LINE FORM. THE MAP INCLUDES MORE OF PENNSYLVANIA (TO INCLUDE AND LOCATE PHILADELPHIA) AND MORE OF VIRGINIA, WITHOUT GIVING ADDITIONAL NAMES OR DETAIL. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THAT ROADS AND TOWN NAMES ARE INCLUDED FOR THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WHEREAS THE LEWIS MAP MERELY SHOWED THE STATE OUTLINE WITH NO DETAILS. SOME ADDITIONAL NAMES ARE ADDED IN NEW JERSEY. THERE IS NO WESTWARD BOUNDARY OF MARYLAND IN THE INSET. AS IN LEWIS, \"POTOMAC\" IS SPELLED THIS WAY AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND \"POTOWMAC\" APPEARS AT OTHER PLACES IN THE MAP.\n\nTHE LEWIS MAP WAS THE FIRST GENERAL MAP OF MARYLAND AFTER THE REVOLUTION. IT WAS THE FIRST TO COPE WITH MARYLAND'S IRREGULAR SHAPE BY INCLUDING WESTERN MARYLAND IN AN INSET, THUS PERMITTING USE OF A LARGER SCALE THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE ON A NORMAL ATLAS PAGE.\n\nDATA IS FROM PAPENFUSE & COALE, WHEAT & BRUN, PHILLIPS ATLASES AND MAPS, E.B. MATHEWS AND FROM OBSERVATION OF THE COPIES OF BOTH STATES IN THE HUNTINGFIELD COLLECTION.\n\nEDITION & STATE INFO : THERE ARE TWO STATES OF THIS MAP THUS FAR IDENTIFIED.\n\nSTATE 1 - (1796) - THIS IS THE MAP AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.\n\nSTATE 2 - (1796) - THE IMPRINT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO \"PUBLISHED BY JOHN REID, NEW YORK.\" ERASURE OF \"WAYLAND, REID & SMITH\" IS IMPERFECT AND PORTIONS SHOW THROUGH OF THIS OLD IMPRINT. NO OTHER PLATE CHANGES ARE NOTED. SEE MAP # 296W6.\n\nHFC OWNERSHIP DATA : THE HUNTINGFIELD COLLECTION HAS A BEAUTIFUL COLORED COPY OF STATE 1 AS DESCRIBED. IT HAS AN ACQ. # OF BB023-DTH AND A MDHR # OF MSA SC1399-58. THE COLLECTION HAS A COPY IN OUTLINE COLOR OF STATE 2, WITH AN ACQ. # OF A025-HGD AND A MDHR # OF MSA SC1399-47. IT HAS A SECOND COPY OF STATE 2 IN BLACK AND WHITE WITH SOME BROWNING WITH AN ACQ. # OF PRS018-N2 AND A MDHR # OF MSA SC1399-276. IN ADDITION, THE COLLECTION HAS A BLACK AND WHITE EDITION OF THE SAMUEL LEWIS MAP FROM WHICH THIS MAP IS DERIVED.\n\nBIBLIGRAPHICAL REFS. : WHEAT, JAMES CLEMENTS & CHRISTIAN F.
