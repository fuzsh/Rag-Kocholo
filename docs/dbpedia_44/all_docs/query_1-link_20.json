        "text": "It goes without saying that throughout the year the amount of sunlight in any given day is going to vary. The time of year and weather will have a strong influence on daily sunshine. Looking at the average amount of peak sunshine hours in a day during an entire year stretch is a valuable exercise when trying to determine the amount and type of solar panels you need to install to power your business or your home. 4.1 peak sun hours means that in Wayland on average there are 4.1 hours a day where the sun is strong enough for solar panels to harness its energy. This number is less than the amount of total sunlight hours in a day because there are times during the day (ex. sunrise and sunset) where the sun is not strong enough to benefit solar panels.\n\nSunlight hits the earth directly at the equator. This is why the equator has a latitude of zero degrees. The latitude of Wayland is 42.6. Knowing the latitude of Wayland can help you plan for your solar panel setup, as the larger the latitude the more variance you will see throughout the year for total daily sunlight hours.\n\nThroughout the day the sun obviously moves throughout the Wayland sky. The suns position in the sky also changes throughout the year with the seasons. A fixed solar panel does not accommodate for these changes. However, a 1-axis panel rotates and follows the sun’s path during the day. A 2-axis panel both follows the sun’s daily path as well as the seasonal differences\n\nAlthough weather predicting technology has greatly evolved over time, it is still a rather unpredictable factor that will affect the amount of peak sun hours your solar power system will receive. Cloudy days for example will usually have lower peak sun hours that a clear sunny day. And areas that usually have more average sunny days per year will probably have higher peak sun hours that areas that are often overcast or stormy.\n\nFor Wayland the number of average daily peak sunlight hours for a fixed solar panel is 4.1 hours. If you are using a more efficient 1 or 2-axis panel then the number will increase to 5.1 hours for a 1-axis panel and 5.8 hours for a 2-axis panel."
