        "text": "The atmosphere here is a little hard to quantify. There are hints of history and hints of a sports bar. I like the glass garage door windows that lift up on nice days. It's just hard to actually label this place, but it works. I ordered the Hot Honey Burger ($11), Bacon, Melted Cheese, Onion Tanglers, & Hot Honey Sauce on Pretzel Bun. It is a delicious burger. Quality meat that's cooked perfectly and the hot honey sauce is great. It's a really fair price / value. The person I was with ordered the Classic Hamburger ($9), Topped w/ Ketchup, Mustard, Pickle & Onion. It was declared to be very good. We both got fries ($2), they are a thin fry, not shoestring thin. They were good and went well with the burger. They just aren't a standalone item. The service was friendly and efficient. The food came out quickly. Overall a 5 star review. Would I return? Absolutely, excellent burgers are worth a 30 minute trip.\n\n6 of us met here for lunch. The service was very good, the menu has plenty of choices and the food was very good. It is not expensive and yes it is \"old\" but that is part of the reason we liked it. It is not dirty or beaten up. Just a good old small town tavern that does a really good job. Check this place out if you are not a \"fuss budget.\"\n\nFood and service always used to be great and consistent. You could count on a great burger every time. Servers was friendly, prompt, cooks were great. Now there is considerable turn over of help. Burgers seem to be pre cooked and of less than quality, death on a hoof taste. Daily special, chicken fried..while explained to me as chicken breast was a yuck looking dark,lunch meat thin slice of ?beef? that had little taste and the taste there was..not good. The new owner that took over years back seems to have completely lost interest. Down hill and down the drain.. Don't waste your $$$ going for food here. Give anywhere else in town your time and money the Hotel is non deserving of your time.\n\nIf your looking for the best burgers in SW Michigan, you have found the place. Make sure you tell the staff about your order, what you want on your burger, they have it from there! Also, the stuffed jalapeños are fantastic! Don’t go without trying them!\n\nThis place is right up our alley; a \"small-town\" type bar with good food. We sat at the bar & the bartender Tony S was friendly & was doing a great job with serving the people at the bar & filling drink orders. The burgers are a tad different than others we've had because rather than thick they are squished thin but are very, very good. Recommend trying the burger with the jalapenos & cream cheese.\n\nI had heard about the burgers from people who live around the Wayland area, and decided to try them out. They are very big, and are excellent. I seriously understand why people like them so much.\n\nWe visited while attending art hop. It was very busy and it took a while to get our food but we didn’t mind. We ordered the prime rib dinners. They were definitely overdone (my daughter ordered medium rare and it was more like medium well only a hint of pink. mine had no pink at all) however they still tasted delicious. The baked potatoes were hot and they provided us with plenty of butter too. Salad was just premade bagged iceberg salad with shredded cheese ontop (no tomatoes, onions, cucumbers or croutons) but it is actually how I like them ;) The bavarian pretzel and cheese we got as an appetizer. Wow! Definitely recommend ordering it, delicious and huge!"
