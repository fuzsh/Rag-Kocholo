        "text": "Town of Wayland, New York\n\nWayland is a large and rural town in Steuben County, New York. It is located in the Finger Lakes region, approximately fifty miles directly south of the City of Rochester. Within the town, is a village of Wayland and the hamlets of Patchinsville and Perkinsville. The village is the main population area and the location of most town businesses. , the total population was estimated at 3,600.\n\nTraffic Tickets in the Town of Wayland\n\nThe Town of Wayland Justice Court (Wayland Town Court) handles many traffic tickets. This is due to the Genesee Expressway (Interstate 390) that crosses the town in an east-west direction. The I-390 is patrolled by Troop âEâ of the New York State Police. They conduct many traffic stops in the Wayland area, mostly for speeding violations. The speed limit on the I-390 does not exceed 65 miles per hour. However, motorists tend to exceed the speed limit on this stretch of highway, mostly inadvertently. The most common speeding citation is for speeding in the 80-90 mph range. However our firm has seen many 100+ mph speeds in Wayland. Some traffic tickets originate from local town streets. The main routes in the town proper are New York State Route 415 (NYS-415), New York State Route 21 (NYS-21), New York State Route 63 (NYS-63) and New York State Route 15 (NY 15). Traffic violations alleged to have been committed in the village boundaries are made answerable to the Village of Wayland Justice Court (Wayland Village Court). There is little practical difference between the courts as they share the same building and court personnel.\n\nFor any traffic related charges in Wayland, it is best if you contact a traffic ticket attorney before you do anything with the ticket. A ticket not handled properly can be costly. Serious traffic violations carry points, fines, and fees. More importantly, they cause substantial increases in insurance premiums for several years and may cause loss of driving privileges in New York. On the other hand, if the ticket is handled properly it can allow for the charges to be dismissed entirely with no points and zero fine.
