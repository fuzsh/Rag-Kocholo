Success at accomplishing this mission at all age and skill levels depends on the joint collaboration of coaches, players, and parents.\n\nOur philosophy is that if kids have fun playing soccer they will want to keep playing. This is the overarching basis for our program. It is not about wins and losses. It IS about how to be part of a team, about sportsmanship, and about learning both individual and team skills. Our belief is that in order to accomplish this, our kids must be placed in an environment where they can succeed and where they get lots of positive feedback from parents and coaches alike."
