        "text": "Ward 86, the world’s first dedicated outpatient AIDS clinic, opens at San Francisco General Hospital. The clinic is a collaboration between the hospital and the University of California, San Francisco, and it draws staff who are passionate about treating people with AIDS. Over time, the staff developed the San Francisco Model of Care, which emphasizes: treating patients with compassion and respect, providing an array of health and social services in one facility, and collaborating closely with the local health department and community organizations. The model eventually becomes the global gold standard for HIV patient care.\n\nAIDS activist Larry Kramer publishes a blistering assessment of the impact of AIDS on the gay community in the New York Native. The essay, “1,121 and Counting,” is a frantic plea for that community to get angry at the lack of government support for sick and dying gay men and the slow pace of scientific progress in finding a cause for AIDS.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler (pictured) announces that Dr. Robert Gallo and his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute have found the cause of AIDS, a retrovirus they have labeled HTLV-III. Heckler also announces the development of a diagnostic blood test to identify HTLV-III and expresses hope that a vaccine against AIDS will be produced within two years.\n\nThe U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that more people were diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 than in all earlier years combined. The 1985 figures show an 89% increase in new AIDS cases compared with 1984. Of all AIDS cases to date, 51% of adults and 59% of children have died. The new report shows that, on average, AIDS patients die about 15 months after the disease is diagnosed. Public health experts predict twice as many new AIDS cases in 1986.\n\nAIDS activist Larry Kramer founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power - ACT UP - in New York City (pictured center) Kramer’s goal is to create a political direct-action group that will force governments, elected officials, public health agencies, pharmaceutical and insurance industries, and religious institutions to act to protect those vulnerable to HIV and those who are sick with AIDS. TIME Magazine calls ACT UP “the most effective health activist [group] in history” for “pressuring drug companies, government agencies and other powers that stood in their way to find better treatments for people with AIDS — and, in the process, improving the way drugs are tested and approved in the U.S.”\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican national conventions are addressed by HIV-positive women. On July 14, 1992, activist Elizabeth Glaser gave a landmark speech on the AIDS epidemic at the Democratic National Convention in New York City, and on August 19, 1992, at the 1992 Republican Convention in Houston, Texas, activist Mary Fisher would give a speech, titled “A Whisper of AIDS.” Later, The New York Times credited Fisher and Glaser with having \"brought AIDS home to America.\"\n\nArtist David Wojnarowicz dies of AIDS. Both Alison Gertz (pictured top), a young, affluent, New Yorker who shared her story of becoming HIV+ in 1989 and later became an AIDS activist, speaking with teenagers on the subject of safe sex and founding the nonprofit Love Heals, and Katrina Haslip (pictured center), an AIDS educator and activist who played an essential role in the campaign to change the criteria for government recognition of AIDS to include the symptoms uniquely experienced by women through co-founding AIDS Committee for Education (ACE) for women incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women and its counterpart ACE-OUT for women leaving prison, both die of AIDS. Musician Arthur Russell dies of AIDS. Model and jewelry designer Tina Chow dies of AIDS. Actor Anthony Perkins dies of AIDS. Actor Robert Reed, famous for playing TV dad Mike Brady on The Brady Bunch dies of AIDS. Florida teenager Ricky Ray dies of AIDS-related illness on December 13. The 15-year-old hemophiliac and his two younger brothers (pictured bottom) sparked a national conversation on AIDS after their court battle to attend school in their hometown of Arcadia, Florida, led to boycotts by local residents and the torching of their home, forcing the family to leave their hometown forever. “Arcadia is no longer our home,” their father, Clifford Ray, told the press the day after the fire. “That much was made clear to us last night.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announces that HIV/AIDS has become the fourth biggest killer worldwide and the number one killer in Africa. WHO estimates that 33 million people are living with HIV worldwide and that 14 million have died of AIDS-related causes. In over 27 countries, the HIV rate has doubled since 1996. More than 95% of all HIV-positive people now live in the developing world, which has experienced 95% of AIDS deaths to date.\n\nAIDS is the leading cause of death worldwide among people aged 15-59. 10 million young people, aged 15-24, and almost 3 million children under 15 are living with HIV worldwide. During this year, approximately 3.5 million new transmissions will occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and the epidemic will claim the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans.\n\nDuring AIDS 2012, the AIDS Memorial Quilt is displayed in its entirety in Washington, DC, for the first time since 1996. Volunteers have to rotate nearly 50,000 panels to ensure that the entire work is displayed. Microsoft Research, the University of Southern California, the NAMES Project Foundation, and a handful of other institutions collaborate to create a zoomable “map” of the Quilt.\n\nThe World Health Organization announces new treatment recommendations that call for all people living with HIV to begin antiretroviral therapy as soon after diagnosis as possible. WHO also recommends daily oral PrEP as an additional prevention choice for those who are substantially vulnerable to HIV acquisition. WHO estimates the new policies could help avert more than 21 million deaths and 28 million new transmissions by 2030.\n\nCDC announces that annual HIV diagnoses in the U.S. fell by 19% from 2005 to 2014. There were steep declines among heterosexuals, people who inject drugs, and African Americans (especially black women), but trends for gay/bisexual men varied by race/ethnicity. Diagnoses among white gay/bisexual men decreased by 18%, but they continued to rise among Latino gay/bisexual men and were up 24%. Diagnoses among black gay/bisexual men also increased (22%), but the increase has leveled off since 2010.\n\nThe United Nations holds its 2016 High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS. UN member states pledged to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, but the meeting is marked by controversy after more than 50 nations blocked the participation of groups representing LGBT people from the meeting. The final resolution barely mentions those most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS: men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, and people who inject drugs.\n\nMathilde Krim dies at age 91. Dr. Krim, a geneticist and virologist who turned from studying cancer to studying AIDS, started the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983 and then became the founding chairwoman of the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) in 1985. She raised hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS research, prevention, treatment, and advocacy. In announcing her passing, the New York Times calls her “America’s foremost warrior in the battle against superstitions, fears, and prejudices that have stigmatized many people with AIDS.”\n\nNIH announces the launch of a clinical trial to evaluate long-acting ART for maintaining HIV suppression in people who find it a challenge to take daily ART in pill form. The study called Long-Acting Therapy to Improve Treatment Success in Daily Life, or LATITUDE will help determine whether a combination of two experimental injectable formulations of ART is better than conventional daily medications in managing HIV in this population.\n\nCDC publishes a new study showing that the age-adjusted rate of HIV-related deaths among people with HIV in the U.S. fell by nearly half from 2010 to 2017. Much of the reduction was likely the result of early testing and diagnoses of people with HIV and helping them to get – and stay on – lifesaving treatment, underscoring the need to sustain and scale up the EHE initiative.\n\nIn January, HHS released the HIV National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to End the Epidemic 2021-2025 (HIV Plan), with a 10-year goal of reducing new HIV transmissions by 90% by 2030. It details four goals with objectives and strategies for use by all partners and stakeholders. The HIV Plan and the EHE initiative are closely aligned and complementary. The EHE initiative is serving as a leading component of the work by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement the HIV Plan.\n\nThere was a 14% increase in the annual number of new HIV diagnoses in NYC from 1,396 cases in 2020 to 1,594 cases in 2021. While a yearly increase in new diagnoses in NYC is atypical, the increase in new diagnoses in 2021 reflects a rebounding from the unexpectedly steeper drop during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when HIV testing services were less available and accessible.\n\nDoctors announced that a fourth person in history has been cured of HIV through a stem cell transplant. The patient had cancer, of which he has also been cured. But the doctors warned the procedure cannot be made available on a large scale."
