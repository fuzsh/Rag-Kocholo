The property was previously owned by Wayland Development, Inc., and historically operated as a waste oil treatment and used oil filter recycling facility, where waste oil was placed into several underground and aboveground storage tanks. Due to historical spills and leaks from some of the tanks onsite, groundwater sampling was done and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, and metals were detected. In 2021, groundwater was sampled for PFAS, and the highest groundwater result was 40 ppt PFOS (compared to 16 ppt) and 80 ppt PFHxS (compared to 51 ppt).\n\nThe groundwater generally flows to the south-southwest towards the Rabbit River.\n\nContent posted May 2023"
