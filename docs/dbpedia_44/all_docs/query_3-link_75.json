        "text": "The 8.34-acre Dunlay property, located at 27 Sherman’s Bridge Road in Wayland, is a small but strategic parcel. Located just south of the Trout Brook conservation complex, a portion of which is owned by SVT, it is a missing piece in a large block of conservation land that includes the Great Meadows Wildlife Refuge. In addition, the Bay Circuit Trail runs along the west side of the property.\n\nThe land was owned for many years by John and Dorothy Dunlay, who have now passed away. Their children, Will and Kate, have offered to sell the property to the Town for $1.5 million. Will and Kate consider a modest house on the property to be a tear-down, and are happy to see the entire property go into conservation.\n\nAt Wayland’s Annual Town Meeting on May 14, 2022, voters approved the use of $1.5 million in Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds for the purchase.\n\nA modest house on the property will be demolished and the site will be restored to natural habitat"
