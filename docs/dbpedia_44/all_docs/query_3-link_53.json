        "text": "Where to Shop\n\nStop into Wendy Brown Home and peruse a gorgeous selection of home wear, high-quality linens, personal items, candles and much more. Mrs. Robinson Fine Lingerie is the perfect place for sleepwear and intimates. Nearby luxury men’s store Milan Fine Clothiers is a made-to-measure custom clothier, with garments crafted by third-generation master tailor Jiro Darakian.\n\nStop in for a tasting at Bottles Fine Wine. Specializing in eclectic wines, unique beers and interesting spirits, the selection is truly impressive. And who doesn’t love a liquor store that delivers?!\n\nA trip to Green Ink is a must for all your clothing and gift needs while you are in town. Their helpful staff are happy to show you the latest casual or elegant fashions and shoes from unique designers. Find the perfect purse, that unique piece of jewelry, or even an adorable new baby gift.\n\nTucked in nearby Richmond Square, Simple Pleasures is a lovely little gift shop to find fun and unique items, such as decorative objects, jewels, clothing, confections and seasonal delights.\n\nPlaces to Dine\n\nL’Artisan Cafe & Bakery, a quaint café at the center of Wayland, is a gathering place for neighbors. With indoor and outdoor seating, it’s a perfect locale to sit, enjoy coffee and a bite to eat, or meet a friend and chat. For locally sourced American cuisine, The Salted Slate serves brunch, lunch and dinner. Order up the charcuterie plate and sample their house-cured provisions. The frequently changing menu highlights the best of local farmers' offerings based on seasonality.\n\nAmerican brasserie Red Stripe offers the ultimate in comfort food. The menu features bowls of moules (mussels) in ten different preparations. Their signature Red Stripe — grilled cheese layered with prosciutto, pesto and poached pear — is not to be missed. This favorite is lively, loud and has a great bar scene. Asian fusion is waiting to be discovered at Lim’s Fine Thai & Sushi Restaurant. The ornate dining room and spicy dishes, like the signature Pad See-Ew, will delight the senses and taste buds.\n\nPull up a barstool and have a pint at McBride’s Pub. This Irish pub also serves up \"pubwiches\" like the Reuben McBride and traditional favorites like bangers and mash and shepherd’s pie. Attached to the Monahan, Drabble & Sherman Funeral Home, the pub toasts to life nightly with “Last Call” paying homage to a member of the dearly departed.\n\nStop into Providence Wine Bar to explore tastes of wines from around the world with a choice of 2 oz., 5 oz. half bottle or bottle selections of whites, roses, sakes and red wines paired with small plates. Urban rooftop restaurant Mare Rooftop offers dinner and drinks with impeccable views of the city. In winter months, they set up heated igloo-style tents on the outdoor patio for a fun dining or drinking experience.\n\nThings to Do\n\nGet in touch with nature. Take a walk, a hike or bike ride and explore the Blackstone Park Conservation District, a 45-acre natural woodland with ponds, parks and open meadow areas. This buffer between the city streets and the Seekonk River is home to various wildlife, migrating birds and other species, as well as plants native to R.I. Take in the view from the water’s edge or enjoy a picnic. This open space also offers opportunities for fishing and boating along the ponds and Seekonk River, where you'll find the Narragansett Boat Club, which offers rowing classes, memberships and more.\n\nWayland is also home to the historic Red Bridge, visible from the waterfront. This now erect bridge was the first to link Providence with East Providence. Neighborhood favorites Paterson Park and Gladys Potter Park (Humboldt Park) are both spacious gated playgrounds with open fields, where there are often neighborhood concerts and community events. Four-legged friends can enjoy off-leash playtime at the awesome Waterman Street Dog Park.\n\nDrop into a class at CORE Studios, offering a full menu of group training, cycling, pilates and cardio classes or nearby Barre & Soul Yoga Studio, which focuses on barre and yoga.\n\nIndependent bookstore Books on the Square hosts author talks, book clubs, game nights and children’s story time. This comfortable shop is kid friendly, pet friendly and has an impressive range of books. Paper Nautilus stocks more than 25,000 volumes of literary and historical works. This is the perfect place to find works by Providence’s own H.P. Lovecraft. The shop also caters to academia, with students and professors from nearby Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design often found perusing the shop's eclectic mix of treasures.\n\nThe Wayland area is easily walkable and there is on-street metered parking available. Some stores have parking lots, and intercity bus service is another option."
