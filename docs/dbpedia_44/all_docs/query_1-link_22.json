In Wayland, the chance of a wet day over the course of April is essentially constant, remaining around 28% throughout.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 39% on June 14, and its lowest chance is 15% on January 29.\n\nOver the course of April in Wayland, the chance of a day with only rain increases from 21% to 28%, the chance of a day with mixed snow and rain decreases from 4% to 1%, and the chance of a day with only snow decreases from 2% to 0%.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during April in Wayland is increasing, starting the month at 1.8 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.7 inches or falls below 0.8 inches, and ending the month at 2.4 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.0 inches or falls below 1.0 inches.\n\nSnowfall\n\nAs with rainfall, we consider the snowfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day snowfall during April in Wayland is rapidly decreasing, starting the month at 3.7 inches, when it rarely exceeds 9.0 inches, and ending the month at 0.5 inches, when it rarely exceeds 1.6 inches or falls below -0.0 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of April in Wayland, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 19 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 2 minutes, 43 seconds, and weekly increase of 19 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is April 1, with 12 hours, 45 minutes of daylight and the longest day is April 30, with 14 hours, 4 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Wayland is 6:51 AM on April 1 and the earliest sunrise is 46 minutes earlier at 6:05 AM on April 30.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 7:37 PM on April 1 and the latest sunset is 33 minutes later at 8:09 PM on April 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Wayland during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during April, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:32 AM and sets 15 hours, 19 minutes later, at 8:51 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:37 AM and sets 9 hours, 3 minutes later, at 4:40 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in April in Wayland\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in April in WaylandApr11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMMarMay001010202020303040405050600001010202030303040405060\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for April 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in April in Wayland\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in April in WaylandApr11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMMarMayMar 105:01 AMMar 105:01 AMMar 253:01 AMMar 253:01 AMApr 82:22 PMApr 82:22 PMApr 237:50 PMApr 237:50 PMMay 711:23 PMMay 711:23 PMMay 239:54 AMMay 239:54 AM7:48 AM7:48 AM7:49 PM7:49 PM7:02 PM7:02 PM7:16 AM7:16 AM6:34 AM6:34 AM7:58 PM7:58 PM8:01 PM8:01 PM6:20 AM6:20 AM5:24 AM5:24 AM8:11 PM8:11 PM8:04 PM8:04 PM5:18 AM5:18 AM\n\nApr 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 50%2:36 AMSE10:55 AMSW-6:45 AMS237,822 mi 2 46%3:30 AMSE12:02 PMSW-7:46 AMS234,463 mi 3 35%4:15 AMSE1:17 PMWSW-8:46 AMS231,091 mi 4 24%4:52 AMESE2:37 PMWSW-9:44 AMS227,965 mi 5 14%5:22 AMESE3:57 PMWSW-10:39 AMS225,386 mi 6 7%5:47 AMESE5:18 PMW-11:31 AMS223,646 mi 7 2%6:11 AME6:38 PMW-12:22 PMS222,982 mi 8 0%6:34 AME7:58 PMWNW-1:12 PMS223,520 mi 9 1%6:59 AMENE9:19 PMWNW-2:04 PMS225,248 mi 10 6%7:26 AMENE10:40 PMWNW-2:58 PMS228,006 mi 11 13%8:00 AMENE11:58 PMNW-3:54 PMS231,521 mi 12 22%8:41 AMNE--4:52 PMS235,447 mi 13 31%-1:08 AMNW9:31 AMNE5:50 PMS239,428 mi 14 42%-2:08 AMNW10:30 AMNE6:46 PMS243,147 mi 15 50%-2:56 AMNW11:34 AMNE7:38 PMS246,356 mi 16 62%-3:34 AMNW12:40 PMENE8:26 PMS248,896 mi 17 71%-4:03 AMWNW1:46 PMENE9:11 PMS250,687 mi 18 80%-4:27 AMWNW2:50 PMENE9:52 PMS251,721 mi 19 87%-4:47 AMWNW3:52 PMENE10:32 PMS252,042 mi 20 93%-5:05 AMW4:53 PME11:10 PMS251,734 mi 21 97%-5:23 AMW5:55 PME11:49 PMS250,897 mi 22 98%-5:40 AMW6:57 PMESE-- 23 100%-5:59 AMWSW8:01 PMESE12:29 AMS249,635 mi 24 100%-6:20 AMWSW9:08 PMESE1:11 AMS248,045 mi 25 98%-6:46 AMWSW10:17 PMESE1:57 AMS246,203 mi 26 95%-7:18 AMSW11:25 PMSE2:47 AMS244,163 mi 27 89%-7:58 AMSW-3:42 AMS241,958 mi 28 82%12:30 AMSE8:50 AMSW-4:40 AMS239,612 mi 29 72%1:27 AMSE9:53 AMSW-5:40 AMS237,155 mi 30 62%2:14 AMSE11:04 AMSW-6:39 AMS234,636 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Wayland is essentially constant during April, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 28, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 26% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Wayland is decreasing during April, decreasing from 6.6 miles per hour to 5.5 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 31, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.3 miles per hour, while on August 3, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 3.9 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Wayland throughout April is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 42% on April 16.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nWayland is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Wayland is increasing during April, rising by 4Â°F, from 36Â°F to 40Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Wayland typically lasts for 5.2 months (158 days), from around May 5 to around October 11, rarely starting before April 19 or after May 22, and rarely ending before September 23 or after October 29.\n\nThe month of April in Wayland is more likely than not fully outside of the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season rapidly increasing from 0% to 34% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in April in Wayland\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Wayland are gradually increasing during April, increasing by 93Â°F, from 31Â°F to 124Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Wayland is increasing during April, rising by 1.2 kWh, from 4.5 kWh to 5.7 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Wayland are 42.568 deg latitude, -77.590 deg longitude, and 1,371 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Wayland contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 515 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,457 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,673 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (2,339 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Wayland is covered by cropland (56%) and trees (36%), within 10 miles by trees (67%) and cropland (31%), and within 50 miles by trees (51%) and cropland (40%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Wayland, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Wayland.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Wayland according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Wayland is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Wayland and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDansville Municipal Airport (KDSV, 64%, 6 mi, west, -689 ft elevation change)\n\nPenn Yan Airport (KPEO, 23%, 28 mi, east, -469 ft elevation change)\n\nGreater Rochester International Airport (KROC, 13%, 38 mi, north, -833 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Wayland and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
