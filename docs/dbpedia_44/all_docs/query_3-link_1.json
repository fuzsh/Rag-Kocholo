The years before 1914 do not have vital statistics, but they do list the name and age of those who died over 70 years of age. (NOTE: Occasionally, these town reports missed vital statistic information from the end of the year. If you don't find your ancestor's vital information, check the following year's town report to see if your ancestor's information was recorded later.)\n\n1883\n\n1884\n\n1885\n\n1886\n\n1887\n\n1888\n\n1889\n\n1890\n\n1891\n\n1892\n\n1893\n\n1894\n\n1895\n\n1896\n\n1897\n\n1898\n\n1899\n\n1900\n\n1901\n\n1902\n\n1903\n\n1904\n\n1905\n\n1906\n\n1907\n\n1908\n\n1909\n\n1910\n\n1911\n\n1912\n\n1913\n\n1914\n\n1915\n\n1916\n\n1917\n\n1918\n\n1919\n\n1920\n\n1921\n\n1922\n\n1923\n\n1924\n\n1925\n\n1926\n\n1927\n\n1928\n\n1929\n\n1930\n\n1931\n\n1932\n\n1933\n\n1934\n\n1935\n\n1936\n\n1937\n\n1938\n\n1939\n\n1940\n\n1941\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\n1944\n\n1945\n\n1946\n\n1947\n\n1948\n\n1949\n\n1950\n\n1951\n\n1952\n\n1953\n\n1954\n\n1955\n\n1956\n\n1957\n\n1958\n\n1959\n\n1960\n\n1961\n\n1962\n\n1963\n\n1964\n\n1965\n\n1966\n\n1967\n\n1968\n\n1969\n\n1970\n\n1971\n\n1972\n\n1973\n\n1974\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\n1977\n\n1978\n\n1979\n\n1980\n\n1981\n\n1982\n\n1983\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n\n1988\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\nResources[edit | edit source]\n\nFor more County and State resources see:\n\nBiographies[edit | edit source]\n\nCemeteries[edit | edit source]\n\nWayland Cemeteries List at Find a Grave\n\nWayland Cemeteries at FamilySearch Catalog\n\nMiddlesex County Cemeteries at FamilySearch Catalog\n\nMiddlesex County Cemeteries at FamilySearch Places\n\nCensus[edit | edit source]\n\nChurch Records[edit | edit source]\n\nCity Directories[edit | edit source]\n\n1873 Middlesex County Directory,1873 at MyHeritage — index & images ($)\n\n1875 Middlesex County Directory, 1875 at MyHeritage — index & images ($)\n\n1901-1921 Massachusetts, U.S., City Directories, TOWN at Ancestry -
