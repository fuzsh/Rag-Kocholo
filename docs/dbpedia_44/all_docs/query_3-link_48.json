        "text": "Also of interest is that Wayland has more people living here who work in computers and math than 95% of the places in the US.\n\nA relatively large number of people in Wayland telecommute to their jobs. Overall, about 28.45% of the workforce works from home. While this may seem like a small number, as a fraction of the total workforce it ranks among the highest in the country. These workers are often telecommuters who work in knowledge-based, white-collar professions. For example, Silicon Valley has large numbers of people who telecommute. Other at-home workers may be self-employed people who operate small businesses out of their homes.\n\nIn addition, Wayland is home to many people who could be described as \"urban sophisticates\". Urban sophisticates are people who are both educated and wealthy, and thus tend to be older, richer, and more established than young professionals. \"Urban sophisticates\" is not just about being educated and well-off financially: it is a point of view and state of mind, one that you might call 'urbaneness'. But such people can and do regularly live in small towns, suburbs and rural areas, as well as in big cities. They read, support the arts and high-end shops, and love travel.\n\nBecause of many things, Wayland is a very good place for families to consider. With an enviable combination of good schools, low crime, college-educated neighbors who tend to support education because of their own experiences, and a high rate of home ownership in predominantly single-family properties, Wayland really has some of the features that families look for when choosing a good community to raise children. Is Wayland perfect? Of course not, and if you like frenetic nightlife, it will be far from your cup of tea. But overall this is a solid community, with many things to recommend it as a family-friendly place to live.\n\nOne downside of living in Wayland, however, is that residents on average have to contend with a long commute, spending on average 32.58 minutes every day commuting to work.\n\nDo you have a 4-year college degree or graduate degree? If so, you may feel right at home in Wayland. 78.23% of adults here have a 4-year degree or graduate degree, whereas the national average for all cities and towns is just 21.84%.\n\nThe per capita income in Wayland in 2022 was $96,173, which is wealthy relative to Massachusetts and the nation. This equates to an annual income of $384,692 for a family of four.\n\nWayland is a very ethnically-diverse town. The people who call Wayland home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Wayland residents report their race to be White, followed by Asian. Important ancestries of people in Wayland include Irish, English, Italian, German, and Russian.\n\nForeign born people are also an important part of Wayland's cultural character, accounting for 16.40% of the townâ€™s population.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Wayland is English. Other important languages spoken here include Chinese and Spanish."
