No, not global warming or asteroids hurtling towards the Earth. Not even the economic crisis we now face.\n\nBut about the dangers of raising a family, hospital visits, being a dog owner, traveling or doing anything else that the world might consider normal, Ted has a slightly different view. Because he is too cheap to spend $125 an hour to tell his problems to a psychologist, he will tell them to you. If it bothers you a little bit, chances are it bothers Ted a lot and you are going to hear about it. Offstage he does a great job of appearing normal, after listening to him for awhile you realize, he is just as nuts as everyone else.\n\nTed has recently opened for Jim Carey, SNL’s Jim Breuer, 30 Rock’s Tracey Morgan and Rhyss Darby from HBO’s Flight of the Conchords and regularly opens for the legendary Bobby Collins. He is a regular at The Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas yet works many Church and school comedy fundraisers. He is working his way back to heaven “one church basement at a time.”\n\nAbout Tim Grill\n\nTim Grill is a rising star on the comedy scene and is one of the funniest comics working today! This hilarious East Coast comedian has been entertaining audiences from Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware and New York City all the way to Hollywood!\n\nTim has been heard on 94 WYSP's Opie and Anthony show, and 610 WIP Sports Radio in Philadelphia. Tim has also been featured on NBC Channel 10 News and on Comcast \"Your Morning Philadelphia\" TV program, and has opened for such headlining acts as Robert Kelly, Bill Dwyer, Orny Adams, Todd Glass, Artie Lange, and Jim Florentine.\n\nBorn with Spina Bifida, Tim was told he would never walk. Thirteen surgeries later, you will see him limp onto stage (hence \"The Barely Can Stand-Up Comic\") and deliver a powerful message that \"laughter really is the best medicine!\"\n\nView Event →\n\n\"Dr. Dirty\" John Valby\n\nThe legendary “Dr. Dirty” John Valby will take to the stage of the historic Newtown Theatre on Saturday, December 14.\n\nDoors open at 7:00 PM and the show starts at 8:00. Beer, wine and concessions will be sold from the time the doors open until the start of the performance.\n\nAfter spending an evening with John Valby, audiences find themselves wanting more and more of him. What makes Valby so unique and entertaining is his uncommon rapport with the audience and his ability to mix his musical talent with a mad-cap variety of \"Dirty Ditties\".\n\nFew people can resist laughing at songs that would have earned them a mouthful of soap when they were children. Valby's repertoire is composed of popular songs, limericks, classical arrangements and his own original creations. Valby has made a career out of poking fun at his audiences, stretching the limits of free speech, and accepted good taste and satirizing current events from behind the piano.\n\nWhen he's not playing and singing, he yells obscenities, the audience yells back and everyone has a good time. The best way to describe Valby is to blend the following performers: Allen Sherman, Spike Jones, Lenny Bruce and Weird Al Yankovic, all topped off with the Dirt of Redd Foxx, only better.\n\nValby attributes his love of music to his father Richard, an accomplished violinist. The \"Dirt singing\" didn’t start until Valby got to Middlebury College in Vermont. Majoring in philosophy, he created a few compositions for his fraternity brothers, many of which are still sung today as part of his legacy. In fact, Valby's performance status remains legendary at college campuses throughout the country.\n\nAs a trained classical pianist, Mr. Valby quickly realized that the demand was limited. He turned to his new material by accident, found a trend and went with it. That trend started in 1975 when Mr. Valby was performing the Buffalo bar circuit doing ragtime tunes and pop standards. According to Mr. Valby, \"I did three dirty songs one night and pretty soon the power of \"DIRT\" pushed most everything else out. I became a mirror for the audience and the audience turned out to be 20 times dirtier than me.\"\n\nMr. Valby has recorded & produced over 30 CDs & LPs which bear such titles as Compact Dirt, Sit on a happy face, Give me Dirt or give me death, Operation F Iraq and many other titles that cannot be printed.
