        "text": "BEER LEAGUE *\n\n(one star)\n\n‘ARTIE Lange’s Beer League,” a proudly un-PC vanity project showcasing Howard Stern’s corpulent side kick, is the sort of lowbrow sports comedy best enjoyed on a 50-inch screen with a six-pack, a bucket of wings and a fast-forward button.\n\nIt’s inexplicably opening in dozens of theaters with a major promotional push, so we’ll hold this slovenly directed (Frank Sebastiano) and written (Lange and Sebastiano) movie to a higher standard even if they didn’t screen it in advance for critics. It didn’t get more than a few chuckles from the half-dozen patrons at yesterday’s early show at Loews 34th Street.\n\nLange plays an unemployed New Jersey slob who drinks, smokes and incessantly spouts sexist and homophobic tirades. The practically nonexistent story line has his softball team (which includes Seymour Cassell, between Wes Anderson films) trying to defeat a squad headed by an obnoxious mayoral candidate (Anthony De Sando).\n\nLange is not halfway bad in a romantic subplot involving a woman he describes as being “used goods” (Cara Buono), but another character is not far off the mark in summing up “Beer League” with these words: “Atrocious . . . unwatchable . . . stinks.”\n\nRunning time: 86 minutes. Rated R (strong profanity, nudity, drugs). At the Empire, the Union Square, the Harlem USA, others."
