        "text": "Artie Lange is certainly one of the best things about The Howard Stern morning radio show, but his career in movies hasn’t exactly been the greatest, but it looks like the big lug has finally found a movie made for him and his lifestyle… Artie Lange’s Beer League.\n\nThe film is described as an outrageous comedy about Artie (Artie Lange), an unemployed underachiever who still lives with his mother and plays in a small town softball league in New Jersey with his rag-tag group of misfit friends. When Artieâ€™s team faces off their nemeses, headed by Dennis Manganelli (Anthony De Sando) of Manganelli Fitness, the game descends into an ethnic name calling challenge and a battle of macho posing as the two former high school rivals face off on the field. While Artie is a loser, Manganelli, the owner of a successful gym whose team wins the league trophy every year, struts his “stuff” like a banty rooster, proudly displaying winning trophies in the windows of his gym. Manganelli, also running for Mayor and favored to win, uses his overblown position and political ambitions to continuously torture Artie and his cohorts both on and off the field.\n\nThe two rivals do more fighting on the baseball field than playing softball and when his team is threatened with permanent expulsion from the local league after being jailed for yet another fight on the field, Artie and his team must rally and move from last place to first â€“ in one brief season, while Artie tries to hold on to the only woman who loves him for who he is."
