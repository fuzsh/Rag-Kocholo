        "text": "Mark Sadok\n\nMy hope is that these recollections will trigger similar thoughts in others, and, hopefully, contribute to a great turn out for that 50th reunion, likely to be the last one we celebrate. Certainly, it will be the last one at which we can possibly party hearty. Or maybe even party. The ticket website is http://www.mepham69reunion.com.\n\nWhen asked to describe what Mepham was like circa late 1960’s, for the last 50 years my one-line reply has been:\n\n“It was great. 1/3 Italian, 1/3 Jewish, 1/3 everyone else, heavy on the Irish. And 15 minutes from Jones Beach.”\n\nThe 1/3 everything else tended to be from those families who had lived in the area before suburban development. Our Italian and Jewish parents overwhelmingly moved out to the area from NYC for the same reasons; more space, more fresh air, and a better life for us, their children. Family oriented, relatively young, and prosperous enough to be able to afford the suburbs, the result was a high concentration of children reflecting consistent parental values – with focus on education. Academically, this confluence of positive factors resulted in our class at Mepham sending 5 kids to the same Ivy League school (Penn) and I believe 5 kids eventually to the same medical college (Downstate).\n\nWe were all influenced by the people with whom we went to school. As the date for the Class of 1969’s 50th reunion approaches, I would like to share my recollections of those classmates with whom I shared my childhood and adolescence\n\nThe following is slightly whitewashed. I have omitted certain memories; who among the boys and girls (particularly in junior high) could have been models for a “Mean Girls” (or boys) movie (by senior year as it was recognized that good looks and being in the right clique were not necessary roads to future success, and also as the victims cared less and less, such incidents feel off considerably), who among our female classmates allegedly learned (so I heard) the skills of oral sex at too young an age, those classmates whose parents were involved in an affair, those kids perceived as the most obnoxious, ect. And I omit certain, but not all, (Scott Azie, RIP) unfortunate events I am aware of that have occurred to our classmates subsequent to graduation. Not that my knowledge of these matters was all encompassing, life would have been fuller at 17 had I accepted the invite to join the Omegans and had partaken in the pleasures of life that I understand they discovered a bit early compared to the rest of the school’s male popoulation.\n\nI didn’t know all of you. And for the many of you that I still remember while looking at the Treasure Chest Yearbook (aptly named 50 years out), I have no good stories or thoughts other than, overwhelmingly, “nice kid”.\n\nIn reviewing what I have written I see my comments about the females are too often, well, the observations of a male adolescent. But as my father, who fought in WWII told me, the troops spent free time focused on 3 things: Wine Women and Song. Our generation’s expression was Drugs Sex and Rock and Roll. Note the identical nature. Such are young men, and the recollections of old men, past, present and future.\n\nBut here is what I remember. It would be great to see any of you again in August. In alphabetical order, my memories of the Mepham Class of 1969. If anyone would like to comment favorably or unfavorably, or request additions or deletions, or wants to join me in putting his or her memories on-line, contact me at msadok@verizon.net. And I do apologize if I’ve upset anyone.\n\nScott Azie – RIP. Told he committed suicide about 20 years ago. Friend from Saw Mill. Tough older brother, Da Crew (?). Father was a WWII paratrooper who fought at Bastogne and, long before the song came out, made sure Scott and I knew the meaning of “Voulesz vou couche avec moi?” And dad had a great collection of Playboys – great stuff for an 8th grader to read. Scott headed the drama group, Skull and Bones as a senior, and became a podiatrist after college. His death was a real shame, a loss of a great guy.\n\nSue Bandman – tall, athletic, outgoing. Nice personality, not shy. Nice girl.\n\nCarl Bank -Lived near Eddie Meier and crew. Runner, self-assured. A little loud, but a decent guy.\n\nSue Barker – Dated her once – before she turned into a real beauty and started dating older guys. Tall, a knockout in a bathing suit at Jones Beach West End 2. Very artistic. Dad was a police captain(?). Lived on Little Neck.\n\nSIDEBAR – JONES BEACH – SENIOR CUT OUT DAY. May 9, 1969. Our principal, Mr. Tennant, told/ordered me to get on the PA system a few days earlier and tell the seniors not to observe Senior Cut Out Day. One of the things I am proudest of in my tenure as your Class President is that I said something to the effect that “Although Senior Cut day is not supported in any way by your class officers, each of you must decide if you will obey the school rules OR SHOW UP AT PARKING FIELD 6 AT NOON.” I was told cheering was the result in several homeroom classes at that announcement. And we were blessed with an early May day with temperatures in the mid-80’s\n\nOn a mid-week summer day about 10 years ago I re-visited Jones Beach West End 2. It was closed. Jones Beach attendance has fallen significantly in the last several decades (more air conditioning, more concern about melanoma), and West End 2, the most desirable area for young people in our day (lots of room, lots of dunes, and at 18 who minded the long walk to the water) was and is open only on the weekend.\n\nSIDEBAR –SKULL AND BONES The drama group at Mepham where I was active till my senior year. Teacher advisor was Ms. Ramel who, unfortunately, insisted we never do a musical which, after the incredible experiences of musicals at Jerusalem JHS (Roberta 7th grade, Wizard of Oz 8th grade, Good News 9th grade) was a real downer. Ms Ramel – who must have been 50+ at the time and who brought her widowed mother to the final rehearsals – insisted that the more salacious lines (to her) of the play be omitted. In 11th grade we did The Man Who Came to Dinner– Mr. Whiteside, the primary character, was played by Jeff Jaggie , one year our senior, wrestler, excellent tenor voice. Ms. Ramel cut lines like “a awn’s behind” as being too risqué for a high school audience. How times have changed. Jeff, to his everlasting glory, put all the lines back in when the show went live on Friday night. Ms. Ramel was not amused. But the cast was delighted.\n\nCharles Beck – Didn’t know him well, but Steve Goldner told me that immediately after graduation he managed to have sex in a car at Jones Beach with a girl he just met while working there. We who heard that were all very jealous. Nothing like that happened to any of us.\n\nWalter Berberich – Ate lunch with him regularly, 10th grade. Transferred into the public school system from Catholic school. Nice kid, smart.\n\nDennis Berman – Dennis was one of the brightest kids in the class (ranked what, 5th?, top ten definitely), perhaps remembered by many as the photographer for the yearbook. Given I knew him from Saw Mill on, in Hebrew school, and we both went to Penn at the same time, had overlapping friends, we knew each other well but were never close. Older brother – lawyer now, younger brother Ronnie a year behind us was active as a school photographer. Dad an accountant. Lived off Pea Pond. Beautiful living room furniture covered in plastic which was not uncommon back then, particularly if you were raising 3 boys. Penn then Harvard Law (see Rick Frimmer) for Dennis. Dennis was at Mepham “political”, never in front, but always involved. My understanding is that Dennis has been more successful financially than any other member of our class. Lives in California, with a second home on Park Ave NYC I am told. Married a nice Jewish girl. Dennis, hope you make it to this reunion, you have been missing from the others to date.\n\nMarty Bunin – My good friend from second grade on. Same Beth-El Hebrew school grades, same Cub Scout and Boy Scout troops. Wore glasses before anybody else. Head of Senior Sales. First Claranet in the Mepham band. Very diligent, excellent student, ranked academically 3rd I think. Went on to Wesleyan, then NYU Law. Still in law practice in Nassau. Dad was an engineer at Republic Aviation, quiet man, Mom was a tough lady, I think at times she found me not quite up to speed for hanging out with her son, and she would not let him socialize with others who seemed quite respectable to everyone else, but Marty turned out great, and one sister upon graduation from Mepham went on to Radcliff so the folks must have been doing something right. Marty lives in Manhattan, upper West Side, married forever to the same lady. Ran cross country at Mepham, Marathon runner for over 20 years. Ask him about his fastest marathon time – incredibly fast. He still runs – no doubt faster and longer than any of the rest of us.\n\nSIDEBAR – TEMPLE BETH-EL The Jews of the area tended to belong to one of two synagogues, Beth-El (conservative, Bellmore Road) or Suburban Temple (reform, over towards Wantagh on Jerusalem). Those of us at Beth-El had to addend Hebrew school 3X a week, 2 hours a session, for 4 years in order to get Bar (boys) or Bat (girls) Mizpahed at the age of 13. The place overflowed with kids. When I was Bar Mizpah it was on a Saturday morning with two others – Mepham classmate Russel Wolf (RIP) and a kid from another school. Every Saturday morning during the school year there were two or three boys going thru the process, usually with big parties at catering halls following shortly thereafter. The girls were taken care of on Friday night.\n\nWhen Marty’s dad died about 7 years ago I went to his old home on Saw Mill road (mom was still alive and living there) for the shiva – Jewish equivalent of a wake. A group from the ritual committee at Beth El was there to assist in the service and to pay respects – the Bunin’s had remained temple members for 50+ years. The Beth-El guy told me that there was a big event soon coming up at Beth–El, their first Bar Mizpah in many years would be held in 3 months’ time. I guess the Jewish population of the area is not what it once was. This was confirmed recently when, at a reunion committee meeting I drove by the old neighborhood and was told Temple Beth-El will soon be no more. Lack of membership is resulting in the building being converted into apartments. SEE ALSO DAVID SCHIFFMAN,\n\nJoe Brucia – Omegan, Now serving on the committee with me to put this 50th party together, a competent take charge guy which is how I remember him from Mepham.\n\nElvira Cadolino – By 7th grade Elvira was fully formed which caught the attention of the 12 year old male students at Jerusalem. Most distinctive memory – her dancing/shimmying in the English class of Mr. William J Lewis to the Big Bopper song “The Bird is the Word” (…everybody’s heard about the bird, bird bird bird bird, is the word…) when Lewis tried to tie poetry to modern music. Elvira showed him there was a non-poetic feature to modern music that he as ignoring.\n\nSIDEBAR – WILLIAM J. LEWIS, teacher of English at Jerusalem JHS. They don’t make them like him anymore. To teach essay writing, he brought in a hunting rifle – a 6.5 mm bolt action Mauser (imagine that today) and told us to write a paragraph describing the weapon. Made us carry flash cards to improve our spelling. Taught poetry by starting with the song “Sink the Bismark” (In May of 1941 the war had just begun. The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest gun…..) and followed that up with the song, “The Battle of New Orleans” (In 1814 I took a little trip. On down Louisiana to the mighty Mississip….). Got tired of teaching kids at the junior high level (not surprising), became AV head instead of an English teacher. Went skiing every winter weekend. Reputedly did well with the female teachers. Made the mistake once of asking his 8th grade classes what they really thought of him in anonymous essay form. One of the Handler’s (I guess the twins moved some time in high school, I remember them but they’re not in the Yearbook) told me he put ….”we don’t believe your stories and your suit pants flap in the wind”. But the most memorable was Elvira dancing in his class at his invitation during intro to poetry time.\n\nJohn Catalanotto – “Cat”, head of the Omegans which means he was a tough guy (Mepham tough). Liked him very much even though in a poker game at David DeSario’s house (9th grade) he took all my money. I know you made one reunion a long way back. I am sure high school would have been more fun if I’d hung out with you more. Cat, delighted to see you were one of the first guys to buy a ticket to this reunion. Please wear your Omegan jacket if it’s still around. Please tell your other members to wear them also if they have them.\n\nRoseanne Ciavolella – Cheerleader, Pirette and all that that implies. When I see her at the reunions, she always looks great (age appropriate great, but still great). Looking forward to seeing you again. What color hair this time?\n\nDennis Charney – Champion basketball player even as a sophomore, quiet, incredibly focused. Two things about Dennis that I have always admired: went to Hopkins because he wanted to be an MD where he dropped b ball despite his skills. And married his Mepham sweetheart – Andrea(?) one year behind us, Orange and White girl. Dennis is a public figure given his status as Dean or President or maybe both at Mt. Sinai hospital/medical school, capping off a distinguished career in medicine including stints at Yale and in Washington DC at the National Institute of Health (I think. I never Google classmates – avoids getting jealous). Made the papers a few years back when he was shot and wounded by a disgruntled Mt. Sinai employee, but fully recovered I believe. Lives in Chappaqua. Never attended a reunion to date. Hope you come this time. As far as I know, along with Dennis Berman, the most successful (defining success in the standard terms of money and position) of our classmates.\n\nLois Chester – Actress, singer, quiet and very nice. Smart. Had the female lead in 9th grade show “Good News”. Older brother a year ahead, member of the Debate Team. Lived in that incredible part of N. Bellmore (Howard Rd, Elderberry Rd) where within 300 yards there must have been 10 kids in our class.\n\nSIDEBAR –JERUSALEM AVE. JHS 9th GRADE MUSICAL – GOOD NEWS The experience of an adolescent childhood. As “seniors” at the school, we got the good parts; Eddie Meier as the male lead/football star who could sing and act the part to the nines, Jim Doundoulakis as the football jock, Jim Ioli as the drunken fraternity head, me as the Astronomy professor who for the greater good of the school had to pass the football star, Lois as the sweetheart who works with Eddie to get him to pass, and Judy Corapi as Babe (?) who had the best song, singing about Eddie as he struts across the stage, “There he goes, the modern gent. The boy’s despair, the girl’s delight. The woman’s home companion is his name. And what he does to flappers is a shame”. The supporting girls got to dress as flappers and they looked great. The show was directed by the husband of English teacher Mrs. Dorian; he was an unemployed theatrical director at the time and knew his stuff far beyond the requirements of a JHS musical. Great fun. And the cast parties – first night at Laura Pravitz’s house, second night at Judy Corapi’s house were outstanding. At the Pravitz’s it was noticeable the adults were drinking the way adults use to drink in the 1960’s. Randi Maltz (dating Dave DeSario at the time?) showed up in a halter top outfit that was outrageous from the perspective of the males. Both parties went very late.\n\nJudy Corapi – Peapond Rd. north of Jersualem Avenue. Multi-talented, multiple awards upon graduation, went on to Pharmacy school I believe. I have no doubt that today that would have been medical school. Judy with your help I learned to dance (sort of) in the basement of your house at that Good News cast party. The songs I remember, they included “Give me some a Loving” (Little Stevey Winwood- gime gime some a loving, every night, bada bada bada, boom, bada bada baba boom) and “Time won’t let me” (time won’t let meeeeeee, wait that long”. I remember that, but what did I have for lunch yesterday? Can’t thank you enough for introducing me to the pleasures of body movement to music. Hope you had the good life you deserved. And I see you’re planning on attending.\n\nMara Covell – My first crush – in 6th grade – who broke my heart when she said yes to Charles Vilk regarding his invite to the first dance 7th grade dance at Jerusalem. Crushed me again when she was elected President of the Debate Club at Jerusalem in 9th grade instead of me. Champion Debator. Later an editor at Self(?) Magazine. Cool, calm, collected, very blond. I am told Mara lives in Larchmont, adopted a girl as a single mom.\n\nSIDEBAR – DEBATE TEAM Which started in Jerusalem in 7th grade where the advisor was math teacher Harry Prosono, who I thought was great but who was unfavorably referred to by some of his (advance track) students as “Harry the Pig” due, I assume to his heft. “Tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them” was his starting instructions and I still use that phrase. At Mepham Art McQuillan had that role of faculty advisor to the debate team. At both Jerusalem and Mepham (I dropped out in 12th grade, too many other things) we were the team to beat. And on more than a couple of occasions the voted best team of the tournament was Mara and her partner, Jeff Epstein, with my partner and me, Rick Frimmer, coming in second. Pissed us off a lot for we thought we were better than Mara and Jeff. Not only did we often beat all the public schools (toughest competition was Calhoun) we debated in the Long Island Catholic school league in 11th grade and also won regularly – Chaminade was our toughest competition. Until we got to the kids from Regis, the Jesuit school in Manhattan were everyone is on scholarship. They kicked our asses.\n\nEvery year there would be a different topic selected, elimination of capital punishment, elimination of the draft, required water fluoridation, are a few I recall. You had to be able to debate the affirmative or the negative, and hours were spent preparing speeches. For rebuttals you had to prepare in advance inches of file cards with notes and quotes, ready to pull up on a moments notice.\n\nRoger Daigen – Jewish jock. We needed more like him. Lady’s man. Not a nice guy in Jerusalem if you were not in the in crowd, got better at Mepham. I always wondered if he was into pot in high school because of his quiet, cool, and somewhat detached demeanor. Roger, show up and let me know.\n\nJim Doundoulakis – Got the part of the football brute in the 9th grade production of Good News at Jerusalem. Well rounded, smart, semi-jock. Younger sister, lived near Steve Goldner close to Jersusalem JHS. Showed up at one of our reunions a while back with a real looker of a date.\n\nDavid DeSario – One of the girls’ biggest heart throbs, deservedly so given his good looks and physique. Lived down the street from me so when knew each other well when young, not well while at Mepham. Mom was from British Honduras, family moved to N. Bellmore from Corona, Queens to, as his father would say, escape from the xxxxxxs who were moving in. Older brother, Billy, was a gem, nice guy, championship wrestler who went on to Ithaca College and I think became a high school wrestling coach. Older sister, Barbara, a beauty. I sensed David and I were going in different directions when, in 5th grade, he proposed to me we pool our money and hire a girl to strip naked for us (can’t make that up Dave). You should show up, for at pretty much every reunion so far someone, or several people – always female – asks about you or says something about what’s going on with you.\n\nPat Drabeck. Lived up near Rich Matsil near North Jersualem Ave. 9th grade – had the most incredible collection of soft knit sweaters, beautiful colors, and she looked great across the room. I did not approve of her choice of boyfriends in high school but I have no recollection who they were. But that’s the price I paid for being a bit of a geek. Sorry we never got together Pat. Next life when I’m 15.\n\nDetlef During – Our American Field Service foreign exchange student from Dusseldorf Germany. Well mannered, good kid. Lived with Trudy Hustedt’s (?) family.\n\nLorraine Eyerman – Nice girl, serious student, beautiful long blond hair, who is in the second funniest picture in the Yearbook. Nation Honor Society picture, pg. 71, that is her, third row, third from right, with a grimace on her face as she is getting goosed by an angelic looking Howard Schecter standing next to her.\n\nCynthia Felicetti – Black fish-net stockings at Jerusalem, great in a flapper outfit in Good News. The photo on pg 4 of the Yearbook captures her spirit.\n\nLucille Fenamore – Attractive and athletic. And nice.\n\nTerry Fisher – Perhaps the most photographs in the Yearbook, due to her extensive school involvement, her looks, and the fact that Dennis Berman as a key photographer for the Yearbook had good taste in females. She got an entire Yearbook page to herself (15) in which the photographer captured the experience of rooting for our football team during our senior year. Well, we had one win – against Calhoun. Terry has been married forever to the same guy, lives in a lovely part of Garden City and has been a key force in putting the 50th Reunion together. And it’s incredible how much she still looks like the girl she was 50 years ago.\n\nPaul Friedman – Great tennis player, inseparable from his crew (Kanarack, Hoffman) who went on to become an MD. Had no idea who I was at the last reunion. That’s ok Paul, I knew who you were because unlike so many, you looked barely changed. So life to that date must have been going ok. I see several of your crew are planning to attend. Hope the same for you.\n\nRick Frimmer – My debate partner, trumpet player, graduated in top 5, school political rival of Alan Schwartz, Penn undergrad then Harvard Law. Voted Most Likely to Succeed and the class had excellent judgement in this pick. Lives in California, but I understand he is planning on showing up for the reunion – particularly as we’re having a live band. What he does not know is that the girl he most admired at Mepham was one of the first to buy at ticket to this reunion – so make sure you come Rick. Dated Lisa Thaview who was a year back. Had responsibilities for putting together the Senior Prom, although he had lots of help. Still very self-assured, be great to see you again Rick.\n\nSIDEBAR – SENIOR PROM was held on Saturday evening, May 31, 1969. We had a budget of $3,000 for entertainment and for that amount we booked the bands The Matadors, but a substitute band showed up – Alive and Kicking (who later had a top ten hit “Hold on Just a Little Bit Tighter”), the Brooklyn Bridge (who had several top ten hits “The Worst that Could Happen”, “Welcome Me Love”), a comedian (what was his name? initials HH but memory fails) and another dance band. In order for this to happen though we had a major problem – King Broder (father of Jamie Broder – Orange and White – a year in front of us) was the talent agent who had handled many of Mepham’s earlier senior proms. About then he was engaged in a law suit with an up and coming Roosevelt boy named Eddie Murphy. Perhaps that’s why he was distracted and we were not comfortable that he was properly focused on us. So we hired someone else who did a great job putting the entertainment together. But King was not happy and some of us – and some of our parents (the Broders were congregants at Beth El) had the experience of dealing with a real pissed off adult.\n\nRobin Gerber – Voted best dressed, quiet, as elegant as they came.\n\nAbby Gilbert – I was adept at spotting a good thing quickly, and when Abby transferred into Mepham as a sophomore I was very interested. I think it was the cast party for some show where, ignoring all others, and oblivious to the stares, she and Jeff Jaggie started a very heavy making out session, when I knew my chances with her were nil.\n\nSusan Gleit – Didn’t know you well Sue but looking at your picture in the Yearbook as I write this I gotta put down what I remember: short,sassy and sexy.\n\nLeslie Glubo – Best friend in 5th grade. Older brother (Steve (?) who was musically inclined, younger sister, younger brother. Lived in the largest house of anyone I knew. Father was a successful salesman of a variety of things (I recall house waterproofing) over the years, who had an extensive collection of Playboys in his desk draw which of course his sons knew about. This taught me to assume when I had kids that it was useless to try and hide anything in your house from your children. First Bar Mizpah party I attended was Leslies’, and it was a late night Saturday blowout at that catering hall down on Jerusalem near Uniondale (Montys?). Long gowns on the women, not getting home till 2am, a fight amongst some of the grownups (liquor and no doubt women involved). Les was a quiet fellow. Family tragedy, a home fire, many years back and I believe he lost a sibling – or two. I was asked by his brother Steve to join a band of his as I had taken guitar lessons for many years (my teacher was Mr. Basile, father of Jan, that great basketball playing guard a year behind us). The other guitar player had just picked up the instrument a few months before – and could play better than me. That was it for taking guitar lessons for the rest of my life.\n\nEdward Goldberg – Key club president, all round nice guy. Mother died in a tragic accident in our senior year.\n\nSteve Goldner – I did not know Steve until our senior year when he was elected Senior Class Vice President. We became friends for life based on our experiences in that one year. A member of the Tritons, voted both Wittiest and Most School Spirited senior male. Steve was unique in several ways. He was the proud owner of an ancient Valent auto which he maintained pretty much by himself – indicative of his mechanical and engineering traits which further expressed themselves when he graduated U. of Michigan with both undergraduate and masters degrees in engineering. He and I shared that we were steady with “good” girls, (ie. no sex, limited clothes off) in his case the incomparable Donna Langer who was, to Steve’s infinite frustration, as “good” as they come. Upon turning 18 we became regulars at the Newbridge Inn drinking Tom Collins. Steve was the first in my circle to break his virginity for at Michigan he quickly discovered that not all girls were like Donna, and being 18 at the time, he had an almost unlimited capacity to made up for lost time quickly and often. Which is what he did. By Thanksgiving break he had a bunch of stories to tell us that left many very jealous. But it gave us hope. At some point during my early college career I hitchhiked from Philadelphia to Ann Arbor to visit him, hoping the charm of being from Bellmore might work for me also. Such was not the case. Steve has been living in California forever, his randiness has moderated as is age appropriate (what a shame), and he has been married forever to the same lovely lady. But he’s still got a great wit. And I know for certain he’s making the trip for August 10th.\n\nGary Gordon – Had musical tendencies and is still – at 67 – playing in a rock and roll band. He and I both played guitar while Eddie Meier sang “House of the Rising Sun” at the 9th grade talent show at Jerusalem. Gary, sorry we didn’t hire your band for the reunion. Please come and I will make sure, if you want, that you get some guitar time with the band.\n\nNeil Gordon – A teacher’s nightmare at Beth El Hebrew school, although he did win the contest for being able to read prayers in Hebrew faster than any other kid. Of course, none of us knew what we were reading really meant. They had a father/son movie night there at some point with the old-fashion projector, and it was Neil to the amusement of some and embarrassment of others who consistently raised his middle finger to project its image on to the screen. Moderated out as he got older.\n\nSandford Greenberg – Sandy, don’t be upset if I remember you as the class clown. You had some competition but you worked hard at winning that prize. Although I suspect, given the current Facebook chatter, that Jon Kanarek could give you a run for your money. Married now to one of the Milstein girls? Would have never guess that one.\n\nNancy Haupt – I would be arrested today – for real – or at least suspended for the abuse I sent in your direction at Jerusalem. Let’s just say the abuse involved pencils and you sat directly behind me. The excuse that you didn’t seem to mind too much is no excuse and please accept my apology after 50+ years. You continued to be a sweet good-natured girl in the years we spent in school together.\n\nJill and Phillip Hoffman – A rare brother/sister combination in the same class. Jill was an actress and a debater, voted the class’s Most Talented, Phil was a jock with a brain and member of the Paul Friedman crew. He had a memorable laugh, a very hearty laugh.\n\nMichael Heller – Seemed at 17 to be an evolving hippie who wanted to play by his own rules. Fortunately for him, God gave him high intelligence which allowed him greater freedoms than would be expected. I forget the details but I seem to recall he and Coach Zuckerman did not get along. Looking at Zuckerman’s picture in the Yearbook he looks like the guy acted, at least to his 10th grade gym unathletic students, a bit of a thug. Maybe the guys on the Football team thought better of him but I agreed with Mike.\n\nGary Huelsen – Wasn’t he Mary Ann Vinciguerra’s boyfriend? And wasn’t he a great wrestler? Then how come he’s not listed on the Wrestling team in the yearbook? A real tough guy, don’t rub him the wrong way was the general thinking. Quiet in class.\n\nJames Ioli – President of the Accapella Choir, great guy. Had a younger sister a year or two back who was a knockout. But with James on the scene, and with a father who was an old-fashion Italian construction worker, all was calm and peaceful (far as I know). James became a Podiatrist, practices in the Boston area, and along with his wife has shown up at several reunions. Really hope to see him again.\n\nSIDEBAR – ACCAPELLA CHOIR – Mepham (and Calhoun) had great choirs for many years. In our sophomore year Ed Snyder was hired to replace the retiring director. Snyder was very competent but a bit of a martinet, given to yelling about both musical performance and other things. However, his driving us hard resulted in excellent music. As sophomores in the Sophomore Choir (from which many of us graduated to the Accapella Choir as juniors), we participated in Vivaldi’s Gloria, and we listened in amazement to the most accomplished high school tenor singer in a generation (a senior whose name I forget) sing the lead role in Handle’s Elijah (“Art thou Elijah, art thou, art thou he that troubles Israel”). One year we did the Brahms Requiem. My favorites were the Russian songs with emphasis on the base parts. Our concerts were, looking back, incredibly accomplished. Plus every year we toured somewhere on Long Island and Jacob Guther, remember him? Joined us (‘My Choir” he called us) and bought us lunch at the Swan Club in Roslyn. Lobsters all around if you wanted. Outrageous for high school kids. And I have no doubt that, 50 years later, if we drink enough, some former choir members are capable of joining in singing some of what Snyder taught us (“Noel, noel, noel noel. Noel noel. Noel noel” – sung as we marched into the auditorium holding candles, or “Hodie, hodie, (tenors), hodie hodie (bases reply)”. I am sure I am not alone in being part of organized singing groups periodically for the last 50 years as a result of my experiences with the choir. As Snyder said, singing is the most personal of the dramatic arts.\n\nFred Jacobs – Youngest kid in our class, very bright, older brother a year ahead, younger sister.\n\nRoberta and Robin Jankes – Tall, great athletes, in with the in crowd from birth it seemed. Father was President of Beth-El at some point. Admired from afar by many of the males, but tough to approach. Dated older guys.\n\nJohn Johl – Gymnast with a brain. Incredible arm muscles. Friends in high school with him but not close, belonged to the same Explorer Post (senior Boy Scouts), lived near Goldner/Langer. Went to MIT(?). Never came to a reunion. Be great to see him again.\n\nPaul Kagan – Father, an architect, was head of the Cub Scout pack 402 sponsored by Saw Mill that many of us belonged to. Lovely family, older brother, involved mother. Very liberal. Nobody of our age who knew them could understand why the parents divorced. Older brother went to Cornell and came back our senior year to talk to us about the merits of the group Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and the point of view that the police were not necessarily our friends as we had been previously taught. Given liberal parents and the associated freedom for their children, Paul threw some good parties in his darkened basement circa 8th to 10th grade. Was introduced to the group Cream while attending.\n\nSteve Kaminshine – Voted best looking and most popular male, but much more than that. Let’s start with him being a starting guard on our senior year championship basketball team. And that he went to NYU law. And became a law school dean. Ladies man back then as I am sure many recall.\n\nJohathan Kanarek – Fee spirit, Paul Freedman crew. Showed up at one of the reunions with Debbie Kelly (see Richard Matsil) as his date. I see from the Facebook posts he’s still got a great sense of humor.\n\nDonald Kaplan – Wrestler with a brain, quiet, intelligent. You’d want your sister to marry this guy.\n\nJeffrey Kantor – Quaterback, voted best dressed, quiet, a gentleman even at a young age.\n\nStacey Kaye – One of the many who rejected my amorous advances. Orange and White society.\n\nRichard Kolchin – Graduated 2nd in the class, widely perceived as the smartest kid in the room – always. Math wiz extraordinaire, never comes to reunions. Hope this history reverses for the final hurrah.\n\nLisa Kuperschmid – Dark haired beauty, Orange and White, reserved. If she comes all will see she’s still looking good.\n\nCraig Landau – A Jewish jock, Omegan or Da Crew. Hope his recent health issues have been resolved.\n\nRobin Lange – In 8th grade one of the Handler twins (I guess they moved before graduation – not in the yearbook) got her on the phone with me on the extension listening in and he asked her how come she wouldn’t go out with me. She told him. A traumatic experience. I survived. Well, she was very attractive and did have lots of admirers, many of whose social standing far exceeded my own.\n\nDonna Langer – Definition of a “good girl”, drove my friend Steve Goldner crazy with unfulfilled desire. Went on to Chatham College in Pittsburgh when I was going to Carnegie Mellon down the street. And she was still a good girl I am sorry to say. Became a Chemist, believe she is still on Long Island.\n\nJoel Levine – Debator, top 10 academically, went to Penn then Columbia Medical School. MD living in California forever. Joel seems to have cut all ties with everyone from Mepham. Too bad. Mom owned a local dress store, older sister. Threw two great New Year’s Eve parties during his college days, one at home, one at the medical student dorms at Columbia. Accomplished golfer. At his house one Sunday, I was told his sister’s in-laws were coming to visit and that they were Quakers. Expecting folks in back hats and long dresses to show up, I was shocked when a red Corvette drives up and a middle-aged couple emerges, the man in a gaudy plaid sport coat, stumbling drunk. So much for impressions regarding Quakers. First memory of Joel, 7th grade first dance at Jerusalem him in a shark skin sports coat with one of those collars made of what, leather?\n\nMary Lisberger – Great looker who from my perspective wasted her Mepham days dating the same guy a grade or two in front instead of dating me. Dad played the piano at the Newbridge Inn on weekends.\n\nCarol Lodis – Sat at my table at the Senior Prom. I associate her with Aretha Franklin singing Respect, which Carol could imitate with great accuracy.\n\nStuart Ludlow – Lived near Goldner, accomplished drummer.\n\nRandee Maltz – Class beauty, desired by many, top of the social tree. Active in many school activities. Delighted to see she was one of the early ticket purchasers for this reunion.\n\nHope Ludwig – Lived one house away on Liberty Ave, families were close. Dad drove a route truck for Drakes, smoked big cigars. Mom was a very vivacious lady, had the best console stero/radio on the block. Mom loved rock and roll (WMCA, WABC) and I associate her with the Four Season’s “Sherry” played at high volume. Nice sporty cars in the driveway, Olds Cutlasses and F-85’s. Her brother, Shelly, Class of 1966, graduated second in his class (behind Allan Schwab), went on to become a MD Gastroenterologist, currently still in practice in NJ. This despite the fact that as children their home was the neighborhood go-to place for candy and comic books and day time TV, all forbidden or seriously curtailed by the other mothers. Hope married relatively young and, unfortunately, was widowed much too young. She, along with Sue Tietz, has been the driving force for the class reunions over the last 30 years. Holding up well, always a pleasure to see her.\n\nSIDEBAR – SORORITIES and FRATERNITIES. There appeared to be a sorority for everyone female if you were interested. Hope was President of Orange and White, the heavily Jewish one, Tri-Delts for the Christian girls, Back and White, and Green and White for the more social. Fraternities – Omegans for the toughest guys, Da Crew close behind with more focus on the jocks, Tridents were a mixed bag. All of them added color to the school and a sense of belonging for their members. I assume these fraternities no longer exist, a loss to the community. Really.\n\nAl Maddaleno – RIP. Center for our championship basketball team.\n\nLouis Mancuso – In 10th grade I wrestled Lou in the first round of an intermural tournament. It took him about 10 seconds to pin me. During that 10 seconds I starting laughing because it was obvious that someone was behind me helping him pin me. Such was not the case. Can’t remember his high school girlfriend’s name, but she was beautiful.\n\nLinda Marblestone – Advance track kid who hung out with the advance track boys – who did not have too many girls hanging out with them. Being on the fringe of that group I am aware that many were grateful for her company.\n\nJan Markowitz – Pea Pond road crew, nice guy, father very involved with the school and the kids.\n\nMichael McConlogue – Omegan, wrestler, quiet, got his head shaved as the price of joining the Omegan’s in 10th grade. Good friend with Todd Paranympho (?, RIP), the real short guy in the class. Told he’s somewhere in the Carolinas but is planning on coming. Dated Terry Fischer but then told her he wasn’t going to the prom – with her or anyone. Terry got another date.\n\nRichard Matsil – Friend from 7th grade on. Lovely family, father sold watches wholesale, mom had the most southern accent of anyone I’d then ever met. Two brothers, one a year behind who wrestled heavyweight, and another who was in Special Ed at Mepham. Family tragedy many years ago – several family member deaths in a fire. Rich was a great guy, a real gentleman at a young age. If you had a sister Rich was the guy you wanted her to date. Boyfriend of Debbie Kelly, sophomore, whose dad was a NYC police lieutenant. He had nothing to worry about with his daughter’s consort. Rich’s idea of a great time was making out with Debbie in the front seat of his car (after popping a cert) while in the back seat with my date I’m thinking that I’d much rather be on the carpeted floor of the living room house where that date, my girlfriend – Sue Martinson – babysat on a regular basis. Interact Club president, became a dentist, lives in NJ. Attended no reunions to date since the 5th, hope he makes this one. Favorite story – 7th grade French class of Mr. Anderson -who was not temperamentally fit to be a JHS teacher – after the first test Anderson says, “ and Mr. Matsil, what did you think you would accomplish by writing on your test – I don’t know the word in French, but here it is in Hebrew”. Anderson was not amused.\n\nEddie Meier – Best friend in 7th grade, less so in high school. Ed had the lead in the 9th grade play at Jerusalem, great voice, one of the few baritones to be selected for Accapella Choir as a 10th grader. Did not get real involved in high school activities, a loss to us all. Became a music teacher, lives in upstate NY I believe. Nice family, two younger sisters, dad delivered propane tanks, incredibly strong. Ed, the last time we spoke 20 or 30 years ago at a reunion I said something about bankers (my profession at the time) making more money than school teachers and you took offense. I ineptly did not make the point I was trying to make which was maybe school teachers had a better life. And after I retired from banking, I did become a school teacher. Hope you make this one. Show up and sing with the band if you’d like to.\n\nMarlene Melnick – First cousin to my friend and classmate Harry Sperber, the families lived next to each other. Marlene matured early, and at Harry’s Bar Mizpah – age 13 the attention paid to her by the male adult relatives was memorable. We 13-year old males just watched.\n\nRobert Medelsonhn – Good guy, always a smile and a laugh. Great friends with Steve Goldner. Lived in California forever, trust he’s still there. Heard he’s coming – hope it is so.\n\nDiana and Susan Milstein – Top of the social heap from Saw Mill on. One married Sandy Greenburg fairly recently, a real surprise, one showed up at the 30th reunion in world-class shape; I’ve never seen arm muscles that looked twisted ropes like those on a female that age. Pictures in the Yearbook do not do them credit.\n\nMarie Monks – All-American girl, very nice, dated older guys. Says she’s coming in from Georgia fro this party.\n\nBonnie Newitt – Broke the dress code barrier by being the first (or one of the first) girls at Mepham to wear pants. Loved horses, don’t think she married, may still live in Bellmore. Self-assured, independent.\n\nLibby Ofshe – Active in Skull and Bones, very nice girl. Younger sister dated my brother.\n\nRonald Pace – Nice guy, great guitar player. Later became a music/choir teacher. Shows up at reunions, hopefully this one as well. Lived on LI last I heard.\n\nDebra Newton – Pretty, popular, reserved. Class VP. Dropped off a lot of people’s radar screen after graduation, too bad.\n\nAlfred Orlando – RIP. Great wrestler, strong artistic tendencies, Omegan, quiet. Almost always won his wrestling matches, but lost a memorable home match for coming at his opponent too aggressively with hate in his eye (Massapequa?). We all mourned.\n\nRobert (Butch) Pallay – Oldest of a brood of boys, very strong student, Jewish religious family, married Thea Peltz, class of 1971. Became an MD. Good guy. I didn’t remember but he told me at last reunion that, during senior year, I was a passenger with his dad driving and the subject arose regarding Butch being beat by Eddie Goldberg for the presidency of Key Club our senior year; when I mentioned I voted for Eddie the dad, to Butch’s great embarrassment, kicked me out of the car. Well, dads should look out for their kids.\n\nJoan Parisse – Dated her in 10th grade. Skull and Bones stalwart.\n\nJerry Perlumtter – Great basketball guard, Pea Pond road crew. Nice and fun guy.\n\nJohn Peterson – RIP. Da Crew or Omegan? Athletic, great sense of humor (see Shelly Stock). Kind to me when I was a perceived as a geek by many. And kind to many others as well. A real loss.\n\nLaura Pravitz – A sweetheart. As a sophomore, dated Jon (?) whose Dad was the school district shrink. Jon was head of Skull and Bones. As a senior Laura dated Alan(?), a junior. Had the female singing lead in an Accapella Choir small production “The Lowland Sea” (My love’s a love named Jonny Dee, he sailed upon the lowland sea…). Tall, long hair. Slightly pigeon-toed walk which only made her more charming.\n\nToni Reiss – Reference to front row right, in the Gymnastics team picture on pg 46 for the physical attributes that attracted the attention of all male students. And voted Most School Spirited, see pg. 117 for a picture that really captures her personality. A force of nature in the best sense. And she took no grief from the boys.\n\nGerald Rispoli – 7th grade, Jerusalem JHS, not the first time any of us in the gym class have showered with a large group of other guys, but for me, and I suspect for many other 12 year olds, it was a revelation that one guy had more body hair, and more developed male parts, than the rest of us combined. Jerry Rispoli. Embodiment of 13 year old male sexuality. And his reputation did not decrease when he took up with Sue Ury, who was blessed with somewhat parallel gender strengths, in what, 7th grade ? 8th grade? They were a couple throughout high school, and I understand they subsequently married, stayed together for many years, but are now apart. Jerry had an excellent voice, lead singer of “The Hitchhikers” (with Eddie Zack and Eddie Walsh?), which was a real decent band. You have to be a decent band to play at USY Temple Beth El parties for hours on end – and they did. One of my dreams is that Jerry shows up at the reunion and, accompanied by the band we have hired, sings “Unchanged Melody” Omegan, quiet in class.\n\nTom Roche – All-American boy. How could we lose so many football games with him as our defense middle line backer?\n\nHoward Rosen. Best friend from high school. Overlapped at Saw Mill, Beth-El, Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, Debate Club, trumpet player in the band. Highly intelligent, but not a take charge guy in high school. Cornell undergrad, NYU law school. Has been for many years a partner in one of the nation’s largest construction litigation law firms. This was foreshadowed by his circulating a petition in Hebrew School to remove one of our less than fully competent teachers. Lives in Chappaqua, married to the same lovely lady forever. Wrote in my Yearbook…..”and don’t get the clap”. Howie, I followed your advice until graduate school.\n\nMark Sadok – MBA, CPA, spent 30 years in a moderately successful career in banking and finance. Then became a high school social studies teacher – credit this to Artie McQullian’s influence 40 years back. Married for 35 years to the same lady who still puts up with him. Now tutors disadvantaged kids at Mt. St Michael HS in the Bronx. Insisted that at the 50th reunion we have good scotch (unlike at the 40th) and dancing music.\n\nHoward Schecter – Religious family, his dad read the Torah every Saturday morning at Temple Beth-El. Dad met and married his mom when stationed in England during WWII. Short, thin, muscular, wrestler, and the horniest guy I knew. And he acted on it – in an age appropriate but successful manner. Constantly. The Beth-El youth group – USY had a campfire in the temple parking lot, 10th grade or so. Howie spent the evening in a sleeping bag with Andrea Cohen, class of 1970. Lots of jealous campers around. See pg. 71 picture of National Honor Society, says it all, that’s Howie, third row, second from right, looking angelic, goosing a grimacing Loraine Eyerman standing next to him.\n\nDavid Schiffman – Hebrew School, teacher was a Mr. Schnider, who should not have been teaching 5th grade boys. One day I joined David as we separately put thumb tacks on his seat before he came in. Unfortunately, he was absent that day and his place taken by the school principal. Who sat on the tacks. Enraged, he looked for the culprit, got up to me and screamed “Sadok, stand up, guilt is written all over your (very red) face”. Deny, deny, deny, and I got away with it as there was no hard proof. David never batted an eye and, unlike me, never turned red. Wrestler, went to Penn.\n\nLarry Schiffman – Ran the Yearbook, more cerebral than his brother, a real gentleman. Think he became an MD.\n\nEric Schneder – Heard him described on the radio – they broadcasted some of the high school football games when we were seniors – as “pound for pound, the best running back in the league”. In 2nd grade, first year playing little league, I first ran into Eric when he was the pitcher for the other team, and he struck out pretty much everyone on our team. And hit several home runs. Excellent athlete, In a different class than the rest of us. Pea Pond Rd crew. Great picture of him, pg. 199. Handsome guy back then.\n\nFrank Sepe – A lot of fun. Was going to go to the U of Wyoming? Frank is that what happened? Please show up. Frank, delighted to see you’ve bought a ticket.\n\nJay Shulman – Champion basketball team forward. Watching him dunk before the games was something lots of us enjoyed. Went to Woodstock with him (and Rosen and Bunin), where we traded our food (3 ex Boy Scouts knew how to camp out) for beer. Never saw him again after that trip.\n\nHarry Sperber – A long time good friend. Harry was born with one blind eye which impacted his athletic abilities severely, which for any child is not a good thing because of its social standing impact. And I’d like to think kids are less cruel today than too many of them were to Harry. He made up for it by devoting himself to his goal of becoming a MD – which is what is currently is – gastroenterologist in St. Petersburgh Florida. Harry, please show up please with your lovely wife Donna, for having seen you recently I have no doubt that you’ll be amongst the best in shape guys at the party. All that biking and exercise, you should show it off. Those who remember you as a unathletic, slightly handicaped bookworm won’t believe it.\n\nMitchell Smooke – Single child, good friend at Saw Mill and Jerusalem, dad worked as a salesman at Macy’s in NYC Herald Square. Family car – 1963 white Chevy Impala. Very smart, never shows up at reunions. Too bad. Heard he went to MIT at some point.\n\nShelly Stock – RIP. Father taught high school, older brother Alan, Class of 1968, lived close to Jerusalem JHS. My favorite picture in the yearbook, Shelly on pg 190 with John Peterson being the Big Bad Wolf in the background. And Shelly would attract big bad wolfs with no effort at all. Delightful girl who passed away after our 40th reunion where she partied hearty. A real loss.\n\nSue Tietz – Met Sue between 9th and 10th grade at some dance sponsored by the Town of Hempstead, and I looked forward to seeing her when in a few months subsequently we were to enter Mepham. However, Sue gravitated towards the Tri-Delts, and it’s my recollection of the maybe 25 Tri-Delts in our class none of them dated a Jewish guy. Nothing overt, not a big deal, everyone was friendly as a classmates, but it was a bit of an introduction to me regarding some of the differentiation self-imposed between the kids with different religions. Another example – Orange and White sorority was overwhelmingly Jewish. And I really don’t remember who most of them dated but I bet they overwhelmingly stuck with members of the Tribe. But me – I, a Jew, kept company with Susan Martinson, Class of 1970, good Lutheran, for all of junior and senior year. She was a lot like Sue Tietz. More than anyone, Sue has worked hard at making our various reunions a success. Still lives in Bellmore.\n\nLaurie Tuman – Top ten looker from the sixth grade on. Object of continual male discussion. Anyone else remember what TWT meant? Not shy, friendly to pretty much all of us. Great looking mom, younger brother. Lived, I am told, within 3 miles of me for many years but never ran into her – probably for the best given I was married at the time. Next life Laurie, you’re on the list.\n\nCharles Vilk – Dad was a Army Airforce guy, POW in Germany during WWII. Charlie, real sorry about that trip to the World’s Fair in 1965, you deserved better from me. Good seeing you at the 30th, hope you make this one. Still living in NJ running your own company?\n\nMaryann Vinciguerra – Voted best looking because not only was she beautiful, she was a quiet, sweet, lovely girl. Lived on Bellmore Rd right off Jerusalem Ave, older brother. Has not shown up for reunions, what a shame. Hope you’ll come this time Maryann. Don’t worry, none of us look as good as we did when we were 18.\n\nPhilip Weiss – Most likely to become a Rabbi if we had that category.\n\nCynthia Weniger – Smart girl, very active, vivacious, good friend of Steve Goldner.\n\nSam Zemsky – Good looking, wrestler, charming, still in the area last I heard. Shows up for reunions and last I saw is still a real fun guy.\n\nDonna Zurlo – Beautiful girl who should have been more involved. Dated older guys.\n\nAnd so many others."
