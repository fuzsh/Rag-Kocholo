        "text": "NEW YORK, July 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Sirius XM Radio (NASDAQ: SIRI) today announced that it has added The Nick & Artie Show, hosted by comedians Artie Lange and Nick DiPaolo and produced by DIRECTV Entertainment, to its sports talk lineup. The show will be available to SiriusXM listeners daily on Sirius channel 94 and XM channel 208 starting July 19.\n\n(Logo: https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101014/NY82093LOGO)\n\nThe Nick & Artie Show airs weeknights (10:00 pm – 1:00 am ET) and features comedians Lange and DiPaolo teaming up for a comically irreverent and unfiltered approach to sports talk. Lange is best known for his decade on The Howard Stern Show and his successful stand-up comedy career. He co-wrote, produced and starred in the film Beer League and his first book, Too Fat To Fish, debuted on the New York Times bestseller list. An All-County third baseman in high school, sports has been a major theme in Lange's life and comedy career. DiPaolo's career as a stand-up comedian dates back to the late 1980's and he played football for University of Maine. He is known for his seething, sarcastic style and his outspoken disdain for \"political correctness.\" He is a regular on Comedy Central and has been featured on The Howard Stern Show, The Opie & Anthony Show and numerous late night talk shows including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the Late Show with David Letterman. He was twice nominated for an Emmy for his writing on The Chris Rock Show.\n\nLange and DiPaolo will make their SiriusXM debut on July 19 with a special show in front of a live audience at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York. They will host from 8:00 to 10:00 am ET to kickoff SiriusXM's annual Celebrity Fantasy Football Draft at the Hard Rock. This marks the first time the show will be available to all SiriusXM listeners. The show aired previously only on XM (Extreme Talk, XM channel 165). The Nick & Artie Show will start airing in its regular timeslot (weeknights at 10:00 pm ET) on Sirius channel 94 and XM channel 208 on July 19.\n\nThe Nick & Artie Show is produced and syndicated by DIRECTV Entertainment/LABC Radio Group.\n\nFor more info visit www.siriusxm.com.\n\nAbout Sirius XM Radio\n\nSirius XM Radio Inc. is the world's largest radio broadcaster measured by revenue and has more than 22 million subscribers.
