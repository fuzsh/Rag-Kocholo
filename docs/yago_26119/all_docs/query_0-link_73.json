        "text": "DATE August 24, 2007 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Artie Lange discusses his new movie \"Beer League,\"\n\nbecoming a radio celebrity, some of the bizarre bits on \"Howard\n\nStern Show,\" and his dark family history\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, TV critic for the New York Daily\n\nNews, sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nToday we start the show with Terry's 2006 interview with Artie Lange of the\n\n\"Howard Stern Show.\" Lange is hosting the Friday night stand-up marathon\n\ntonight on Comedy Central, a marathon that also includes the network's premier\n\nof \"Beer League,\" the movie he co-wrote and in which he stars.\n\nSince joining the \"Howard Stern Show\" in 2001, Artie Lange has become famous\n\nfor his self-deprecating stories, which are usually about his drinking,\n\novereating, gambling, and his on-again/off-again relationship with his\n\ngirlfriend. At this point, it's definitely off. Artie was an original cast\n\nmember of the Fox sketch comedy series \"MADtv,\" and was a regular on the ABC\n\nsitcom \"Norm.\" He's appeared in the films \"Dirty Work,\" \"The Bachelor,\" \"Old\n\nSchool,\" and \"Elf.\" His movie \"Beer League\" is about a group of guys in New\n\nJersey whose softball team is in the league playoffs. For them, softball is\n\nmore about drinking beer and goofing off than playing ball.\n\nTerry spoke with Artie Lange last year.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nHow close is the character you play in \"Beer League\" to you?\n\nMr. ARTIE LANGE: Too close. This would be me if I didn't get lucky and get\n\ninto show business. I would be exactly this guy, unfortunately. I'd be, you\n\nknow, by the time I was this age, probably, a raging alcoholic playing in a\n\nsoftball league that I took way too seriously and probably living with my\n\nmother. That sounds like an accurate description.\n\nGROSS: Tell me a story from the movie that actually comes from your real\n\nlife.\n\nMr. LANGE: You know, these leagues are all--they call them \"beer leagues,\"\n\nthey should really call them \"hard liquor leagues.\" Drinking is just such a\n\npart of the softball culture before, sometimes during, and after a game. I\n\nplayed in a league where every base was a quarter keg of beer, and you had a\n\ncup in your back pocket. If you got on base, you filled up. And I don't know\n\nwho in the town committee allowed this to happen, but within two weeks they\n\nhad to, you know, get rid of the league because people were just drunk by the\n\nsecond inning, throwing bats, and it was violent.\n\nAnd the fight in the film, in particular, the old guy on our team, played by\n\nSeymour Cassel--he has a line in the movie where he tells the one kid to hold\n\nanother guy's head while he tries to kick him--that really happened. I played\n\nin a league where a guy who was about 78 years old, who was our pitcher, and a\n\nbrawl busted out and he told my friend on our team to hold the kid's head\n\nwhile he tried to kick him. And he went to kick him and he, you know, he\n\ngrabbed his gut and he fell down. We thought he had a heart attack. So it's\n\nbasically--the fight in the movie is based on several different fights that\n\nactually happened.\n\nGROSS: Now, the first time you were on \"Howard Stern Show\" was as a guest\n\nwith Norm MacDonald. You and he were promoting a movie.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You were really funny on it. How did you go from being a guest to\n\nbeing part of the regular cast of characters?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, that appearance was to promote a film called \"Dirty Work.\"\n\nAnd Norm knew how big of a fan of the Stern show I was. He was going in to\n\npromote the film. He said, `Hey, why don't you come with me and maybe, you\n\nknow, Howard will have you on?' And Norm at the time was going through kind of\n\na crazy separation sort of divorce, and he didn't want to deal with that. And\n\nHoward, you know, always asks those personal questions. So Norm said, `Hey,\n\nif that happens, I'll bring you in and we'll talk about the movie.' So sure\n\nenough, a minute into Norm's interview, that happened. And they bring me in,\n\nand as they're putting the headset on me, Norm says to Howard, on the air--and\n\nI did not he was going to do this--he said, `Howard, you'll love Artie. He\n\ngot kicked off of \"MADtv\" because of cocaine.' And I was--on the air, I just\n\nlooked at him like, `What the hell did you just say?' and Howard, of course,\n\ndarted his eyes right to me. And I told this whole story about getting\n\narrested and almost getting fired and going to rehab, and of course Howard\n\nloved that. He loves stories like that. So he said to Norm, `Bring Artie\n\nback when you come back and we'll hear more stories like that.'\n\nWe went back in three more times to promote a sitcom we were doing together\n\ncalled \"Norm.\" And every time I went in, I would tell another crazy story and\n\nHoward always loved it. And when the \"Norm\" show got cancelled, it was again\n\none of those things in life, perfect timing. It was a coincidence. Jackie\n\nMartling, the comedian who was on the show for years, left the show, and they\n\nwere looking for another guy. So Howard remembered me from going in with Norm\n\nseveral times, and two months later they whittled it down to a couple of guys,\n\nand then eventually I got offered the job.\n\nGROSS: Now you know how you're saying Norm MacDonald brought you on because\n\nhe didn't want to answer the personal questions that he knew Howard would ask?\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You're asked those questions all the time.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: I mean, it's just anything about, you know, drugs, sex, your\n\ngirlfriend...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...or your ex-girlfriend, depending on what day it is.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, exactly.\n\nGROSS: So, Art, were you ready for that? Are you comfortable with that? Are\n\nthere ever kind of consequences?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, absolutely. I--and again, it's my fault. Before anybody\n\ntakes the blame for that, I would have to. I offered it up. From the very\n\nbeginning, I was always sort of honest about my life and the bad parts as well\n\nas the good parts. And now, you know, I'm just known for being so honest that\n\nit's almost expected of me to just come clean and say everything.\n\nThere are lines I won't cross. Dating someone, that's a fine sort of--that's\n\na difficult road to go down. And I found the boundaries as we went along.\n\nThere's a story about a hooker that ripped me off in Las Vegas for $500 that I\n\ntold him off the air. And on the air, he just brought it up, and he said,\n\n`Come on, tell the story, tell the story.' And he ended up getting it out of\n\nme. It happened before I was dating my girlfriend, but we were dating at the\n\ntime he got me to tell the story, so it was a very sensitive thing. She was\n\nlike, `I can't believe you told that story,' and I said, `Well, it was before\n\nyou.' She goes, `Yeah, but it's still embarrassing and...' So, stuff like that\n\nhas happened.\n\nGROSS: Now, listeners know that your girlfriend--or now ex-girlfriend?\n\nMr. LANGE: Right now, unfortunately, it's ex-girlfriend, yes.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, well she had always wanted you to go into therapy. You got a\n\nlot of issues...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right. Definitely.\n\nGROSS: ...with gambling, drugs, alcohol, food, other things.\n\nMr. LANGE: Every self-destructive thing, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Commitment. Yeah. So she wanted you to go into therapy. You've\n\nalways avoided therapy. Now my producer Amy pointed out that being on\n\nHoward's show is almost like therapy in the sense that you're always talking\n\nabout yourself, telling stories about yourself.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And Howard's always, like, forcing you to go deeper and deeper. But\n\nthen my producer Phyllis pointed out, though--although the talk part might\n\nsound like therapy, therapy expects you to change. But on Howard's show, it's\n\nkind of like you're rewarded for that kind of behavior...\n\nMr. LANGE: Oh, absolutely.\n\nGROSS: ...because if you can get a good story out of it, that's all anybody\n\nwants.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah. No. That's very perceptive of both of them, actually.\n\nYeah, you know, it's weird. A lot of comics--actually, Andrew Dice Clay, who\n\nI met through the show and worked with once, would say, `What do you want to\n\ngo through therapy for? The fact that you're so screwed up in the head is why\n\nyou're funny. You know, why would you want to fix that?'\n\nAnd in a way, it makes sense. I guess all comics--at least, most of them that\n\nI know--could probably use a good dose of therapy. And a lot of them are\n\nreluctant because they feel in some way maybe it'll lose their edge and their\n\ncrazy view of life and why they're funny. And that sounds a little ridiculous\n\nto me, but maybe deep down I really do feel that way.\n\nGROSS: One of your most famous stories from the \"Howard Stern Show\" is\n\nwhen--back when you were a regular on \"MADtv,\" the sketch comedy TV show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and you were doing a lot of cocaine at the time and you were very\n\nhigh and totally lacking in sleep--I think it'd been, like, four days without\n\nsleep at this point.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So the story, it's a really long and very funny kind of tragic\n\nstory...\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...about how you ended up punching one of the producers and then\n\nfleeing from the cops, because they had called the cops on you.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: Fleeing from the cops and then you end up punching one of the cops,\n\nand he finds cocaine on you.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So you're arrested for assaulting an officer and possessing cocaine.\n\nOK, great story, people on \"Howard Stern\" really loved it. What's it like,\n\nwhen you're working with Howard and Robin and say you don't show up? Say\n\nyou--I don't know if you're still getting high, whatever.\n\nMr. LANGE: No.\n\nGROSS: But say something not quite as out of control like that happens in the\n\ncontext of their show, do they think it's so funny?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, first of all, I've stopped doing cocaine. I had to. The\n\nlast time I did coke--and from going to rehab, everybody remembers dates.\n\nJune the 14th, 1997, is the last hit of blow I did, thank God, because that\n\nwas just killing me. I still drink, and a lot of people say, `Well how can\n\nyou do one without the other?' I've been able to do it, thank God. And, look,\n\nI've had coke put in my hand on the road at gigs, and I'm able to just throw\n\nit away. I just look at it like death, the devil.\n\nBut last year, I had a lot of stress. I was traveling to promote a DVD of my\n\nstand-up comedy, and I did six months on the road while I was doing the show\n\nat the same time, weekend gigs. And then I was going in to shooting this film\n\n\"Beer League,\" and I was really, really stressed. And I was drinking a lot on\n\nthe road. And when I got back from Chicago, last June, the week after the\n\ngig, in between the road and shooting the movie, I sort of had a breakdown to\n\nwhere I couldn't get to work. And I've suffered through depressions, and I\n\nthink it all stems from addictions. I think my depression was caused by the\n\ndrugs I was using way back when, and I think the alcohol that I was consuming\n\non the road and just the stress of traveling and the strain caused me to go\n\ninto this depression. I couldn't--when I go into these depressions, it's\n\ninsane. Like, people say, `I get depressed sometimes, too,' but it's a\n\ndifferent kind of thing, and anyone who suffered from this will know what I'm\n\ntalking about.\n\nIt like, it just stays on you like a wet blanket. You physically can't move,\n\nyou're so out of it. You can't function, you can't shave, and like I went\n\nthrough one of these episodes, you know, last year, and I couldn't make it to\n\nthe show for four days. Now, it was way more amplified publicly at this point\n\nbecause I'm more famous now, and the Stern show is, obviously, a high-profile\n\nthing. And in the context of the show, he just made a joke about it, you\n\nknow. It's just, it's a tragic thing, I guess, but, you know, it's a comedy\n\nshow and a lot of the material's dark and it's based on our real life, so when\n\nI got back after missing four days, I got teased and reamed and everything\n\nelse by the callers, by him, and I never stopped it. I just took it. Because\n\nif you take it, you're able to also dish it out. And I wanted to prove to\n\nmyself that I had a thick, thick skin and could deal with it. So I dealt with\n\nit, and after a few days it went away.\n\nIf I had told him, `Look, this is a serious issue and we shouldn't really\n\nhandle it this way on the air,' believe me, he would respect that; that's how\n\nhe is. But I never did that. I said, `To hell with it, I'm going to go in\n\nand fess up to what happened and just deal with it,' and that's what I did,\n\nand eventually it went away, you know?\n\nGROSS: Well, getting back to that similarity between being on the show and\n\nbeing in therapy, although you're not in therapy, when you go through a really\n\nbad depression like that and then you come on the show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...and everybody's kind of ribbing you for it, and you're talking\n\nabout it and they're talking about it and the callers are talking about it...\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...what does--does it help or hurt, in terms of your own emotional\n\ninner life?\n\nMr. LANGE: I don't know. You see, I created a sort of a monster on the show\n\nwith this bit that I do where I go like this with--if somebody's complaining\n\nabout something, I'll say, `Wanh!' I do this thing where, you know...\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...the whining `Wanh' thing, and that became a bit that I did for\n\nlike a year on the show. And then, of course, as soon as I got back, the\n\nfirst caller hits me with, `Wanh, I'm depressed, wanh. Wanh, I got to make a\n\nmovie and I'm stressed out! Wanh!' So, and I--I mean I have created--God\n\nforbid, if I ever died, some of these crazy fans would show up to my wake and\n\ngo up to my mother and go, `Wanh! My fat son died! Wanh!' I mean, they're--I\n\nmean, they're that nuts.\n\nSo, look, I sat there and I said to myself, `I dish it out and I got to take\n\nthis.' And I'm doing OK now. Maybe it helped, but I don't know. I have never\n\nreally figured out, in a really deep sort of thorough way, what causes that in\n\nmy head. I mean, obviously, therapy would...\n\nGROSS: I was going to point that out.\n\nMr. LANGE: Therapy would help that. But I'm still reluctant to go, and the\n\nonly therapy I get is on national radio, so--maybe I'm a human experiment.\n\nWe'll see if it's working or not.\n\nBIANCULLI: Artie Lange, speaking to Terry Gross last year.\n\nMore after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nBIANCULLI: Let's get back to Terry's interview with Artie Lange of the\n\n\"Howard Stern Show.\" He's the guest host for tonight's lineup on Comedy\n\nCentral, which includes a late night showing of his own movie \"Beer League.\"\n\nGROSS: What are the preparations like for the show?\n\nMr. LANGE: The lack of preparation, early in the morning. I always thought\n\nthat, you know, Howard got there at like a quarter to 5 and got bits together\n\nand, you know, every newspaper article he wanted to talk about was out. And\n\nhe gets a lot of that done at home through the use of a computer now with\n\neverybody. And like the first time I showed up, I got there at 20 to 6, and\n\nI'm sitting there, I wanted to make sure I'm early, I'm like, `Where's Howard?\n\nWhere's Howard?' He walked in at, like, three minutes to 6, said hi to me.\n\nGary went over a couple of minor things with him, and he went right on the\n\nair. So I got used to that.\n\nThe preparation for me is, I mean, I have the dream job. I have no\n\npreparation. Like, all my work is what you hear me say on the air. I'll try\n\nto read the New York Post, Page Six, because that's probably the part of a\n\nnewspaper that he'll refer to the most, so I'll try to get familiar with that\n\nreal quick in the morning over a cup of coffee. And then, I--and I like it\n\nthis way, because it sounds more conversational--I genuinely have no idea what\n\nhe's going to bring up. And my job is just to roll with the punches, whatever\n\nthe subject is, and try to add humor to it. And it's been working so far. I\n\nlike the spontaneity. I don't like to be overly prepared for anything.\n\nGROSS: Let me ask you something about the show that, I just want your\n\nimpression of this. Sometimes I think that some of the more, like, homophobic\n\nhumor on the show...\n\nMr. LANGE: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...and misogynist humor on the show, it's like when you're doing it on\n\nthe show, I can see you guys are really funny. And even when things rub me\n\nthe wrong way...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...you're pros, you're good at what you do. You're all brilliant at\n\nwhat you do. But then I wonder about the people listening who, you know, if\n\nthey think like, `Hey, it's really cool to be homophobic'...\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: Or `It's like really cool to just have girls who are strippers and to\n\nthink of all girls as strippers.' Do you worry about that at all?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, to a certain extent. I'd be lying if I said I don't worry\n\nabout it. But to me, the people you're describing are dumb people, you know.\n\nThe \"Howard Stern Show\" is a big hit because it entertains dumb and smart\n\npeople at the same time for the different reasons. And there's a couple shows\n\nlike that. \"The Simpsons\" is another one. Smart people and stupid people\n\nlove \"The Simpsons\" for totally different reasons. That's why it's a big hit.\n\nEverybody's either smart or stupid. So a lot of people watch it.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. LANGE: Our show, smart people and stupid people love it for different\n\nreasons. And early on in my career, I sort of just made a commitment to\n\nmyself, I refuse to cater to stupid people. What we do on the air is just try\n\nto be funny and hope that the smart people listen more than the dumb people.\n\nGROSS: How do you feel about the part of the show where people become\n\nregulars because of a physical deformity, like a mental problem.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: You're comfortable with that part?\n\nMr. LANGE: You know, again, there's times where it's heartbreaking to see\n\nsome of the people come in and get on the air and speak about their lives.\n\nAnd this is a very difficult subject, because the one argument is, you're\n\ngiving some sort of wonderful gift to these people that they're becoming sort\n\nof mini-celebrities, like Beetlejuice is an example...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...of a guy. He's a retarded black midget who, you know, drinks\n\nall the time and he's got bad teeth and he--I mean, the guy's a rock star. He\n\nmakes over six figures a year doing appearances because the show made him\n\nfamous. And I really think he's having a good time with it. You know, I\n\nreally--he seems happy. He seems to like the attention and all the partying\n\nand everything, whereas without that, his life would be, you know, lonely and\n\npathetic and everything.\n\nNow that's me sort of justifying what we do, you know, that's the positive\n\nargument. He could go home and have really, really dark, dark times thinking\n\nabout, `Oh, they're laughing at me and I'm being exploited,' and, you know, he\n\ngets paid a lot of money and there's people that handle him. They seem to be\n\ngood, honest people, and I hope that they take care of him. But look, we\n\ndon't see him 24 hours a day. He seems to be fine with it. But if I knew\n\nthat one of these people that comes on our show all the time was really\n\nhurting about it and felt exploited and was sad, to be honest with you, that\n\nwould really make me upset. And I would question having them on again, if\n\nthat were the case. I genuinely think that the people that come on our show\n\nenjoy it, enjoy the attention, and I think it enriches their lives that\n\nwould've been, you know, really, really, maybe boring, mundane, and, you know,\n\nfor lack of a better word, horrible without all this love. They get a lot of\n\nlove.\n\nYou know, Beetlejuice, again, is a guy who was born with this deformity, but\n\nwhen he walks onstage, he gets all that affection. They love him. It's like\n\nElvis. And I genuinely think he digs it. If I thought he didn't, it would\n\nbug me. It really would. And I'd have to, like, I'd have to be honest about\n\nthat. I go, `Look, this kid's miserable doing this. We shouldn't, you know,\n\nhave him on anymore.'\n\nArtie Lange, speaking to Terry Gross. We'll have more of their conversation\n\nin the second half of the show. I'm David Bianculli and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross. We're\n\nlistening back to an interview Terry conducted last year with Artie Lange of\n\nthe \"Howard Stern Show.\" Tonight he shows up on Comedy Central to host a\n\nmarathon of stand-up comedy shows and to preside over a late night showing of\n\nhis own movie \"Beer League.\"\n\nGROSS: When you were--I forget what year it was, but your father was a\n\ncontractor and he had an accident...\n\nMr. LANGE: He installed television antennas, yeah.\n\nGROSS: He had an accident, he fell off the roof.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And be, you know, had quadriplegia after that.\n\nMr. LANGE: Right.\n\nGROSS: How did that change your life?\n\nMr. LANGE: Oh, God. Well, he, I mean, he was my best friend. It was the\n\nquintessential father/son sort of American relationship. We played baseball\n\ntogether and he, you know, he was everything to me and I sort of looked at him\n\nlike Superman. I mean, almost literally. I would go to him to work, and I\n\nwould go to work with him, and he would be on the roof and I thought he could\n\nfly when I was, like, seven years old. Literally. And he fell a week after\n\nmy 18th birthday, and it was like `Here's adulthood.' Like throwing cold water\n\nin your face.\n\nAnd it changed my life in the sense that--I was a horrible student, I was\n\nnever going to go to college. I just used that as an extra reason not to go.\n\nBut I was definitely a lost soul. I knew I wanted to be a comedian, but that\n\nseemed like a huge mountain. How was I going to make that happen? And when\n\nhe fell and we went broke, my mother, you know, he--he fell off a ladder that\n\nhe had stolen and he wasn't even using it properly, and he fell off a house\n\nthat had no homeowner's insurance, so there's always somebody to sue usually,\n\nso at least you get a settlement. There was nobody to sue.\n\nSo we, you know, had no money saved anyway, and there were doctor bills and my\n\nmother had to go on welfare. I remember driving my mother to the welfare\n\noffice at 18, and she was a very proud Italian woman and she hated going\n\nthrough that. And my father was sitting there, he couldn't move, and I used\n\nit as an excuse to just go into an insane downward spiral. I mean, every\n\nself-destructive thing you can imagine. Drinking, drugs, gambling, you know,\n\novereating, bar fights--getting into fights with guys I knew could kick my\n\nass, bouncers--just because I just wanted to just get in my own dark world and\n\njust, you know, sort of wallow in it and just escape. And that was my excuse,\n\nthat was my `wanh,' you know. It was, `My old man's a quadriplegic, so I\n\ndeserve to get drunk.' And that's when all my addictions really kicked in.\n\nSo before he fell, I really didn't have those issues. I might've been on the\n\nroad to them. After he fell, they all kicked in and I just went--it was the\n\nfour years that he lived after the accident, was--it's all a blur to me. I\n\ncan barely remember it.\n\nGROSS: Did you take any responsibility for taking care of him?\n\nMr. LANGE: Well, yeah. What happened was, because we couldn't afford\n\n24-hour nurses, Medicaid allowed for a nurse eight hours a day, and my mother\n\ngot a secretarial job. So he had to be turned every couple of hours,\n\notherwise he'd get bad bedsores. So if I was home, hungover or something, I\n\nwould turn him and talk to him.\n\nAnd we had these crazy just like one-on-one conversations when my mother was\n\nat her job as a secretary, my sister was bartending to put herself through\n\ncollege and it was just me and him in the house and he's like looking at me\n\nlike, `How did I do this? What happened?' And it was just really dark,\n\ndepressing conversations. And more than once he asked me to kill him, and\n\nthat had to be, like, such a hard, you know, task, as son. He would even say\n\nstuff like, you know, he had all these crazy pills, painkillers, which I stole\n\nevery once in a while to get high. And he would say, `Look, just leave them\n\non the table, I'll somehow get them in my mouth, you know, you don't have to\n\nshoot me in the head or anything.' And that's literally what the conversations\n\nwere like for four years.\n\nAnd I just stayed self-medicated and I would try to turn him when my mother\n\ncouldn't. And then I would go out at night and get drunk or whatever, and my\n\nmother would literally have to set her alarm for every two hours to get up and\n\nturn him, and then get up and go to work all day. So I took over some of his\n\naccounts, installing antennas, climbing roofs, just because we needed the\n\nmoney so desperately. My mother hated that. But I was capable of doing it, I\n\nhad learned how to do it through him. So I started installing antennas in the\n\nfirst couple of years after he fell, just to get some immediate money. But of\n\ncourse my mother was freaked out. Now I'm climbing a roof, you know.\n\nGROSS: Right, right, right.\n\nMr. LANGE: So that's how I tried to help, by doing some work. But I was\n\nbasically, in those four years, no help at all. That's probably why I'm so\n\nguilty now and I try to--I lavish my mother with everything I possibly can,\n\nyou know.\n\nGROSS: Your father died four years after the accident.\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And it was after that that you started trying out comedy?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yeah, the first time I ever tried it, I was 19 years old.\n\nGROSS: So that's when he was still alive, then?\n\nMr. LANGE: Yes, July 12th, 1987. I'll never forget that day, because it was\n\nthe first--I had been saying to myself `I got to try this' and I officially,\n\ngot up one day, I read in the paper that the old Improv on 9th Avenue and 44th\n\nStreet was having a lottery. Like, 200 people show up, they put 10 pieces of\n\npaper--they put a bunch of pieces of paper in a hat. If you get a piece of\n\npaper that has a number on it, that's your number that night. So, first try,\n\nsure enough, on my first time going--people would go constantly and never get\n\na number and have to come back. My first try, I get the number 10. I was\n\n10th in a line-up of 12 guys. I had to go back that night. And I had just\n\ntold my mother and father that I was going to try to do it. I took my\n\nfather's handicap van into New York, I parked it on 9th Avenue. I was afraid\n\nit was going to get towed. I went into the Milford Plaza and tried out five\n\nminutes of stuff that I had prepared in my head and I went up and bombed\n\nmiserably.\n\nBut I was proud of myself that I actually did it, you know. So I went home\n\nand told them about it, but I had bombed so bad it intimidated me and I didn't\n\ntry it again for another four years, until after he died. So I tried it once\n\nwhile he was still alive and it was a bad experience. Then I went back into\n\nthe booze, wallowing, I was like, `God, this dream of mine didn't work out.\n\nNow what am I going to do?' I did it once and I thought I just would always\n\nsuck, when everybody sucks the first time.\n\nAnd it took him dying for me to really go, `I'm going to try this again. I'll\n\ngive it one more shot.' So, almost in honor of his memory, `I'm going to give\n\nit another shot.' And it felt better that time. And at a lack of anything\n\nelse to do, I just kept going back, you know?\n\nGROSS: Do you think your mother's surprised at how you turned out and how\n\nsuccessful you are?\n\nMr. LANGE: I think my mother, in a lot of ways, is surprised I'm alive, much\n\nless successful. She always had confidence in me. She was never this\n\nold-fashioned sort of Italian mother who would say, `No, that's too much of a\n\nrisk; get some sort of steady work.' Because I worked as--my friend got me a\n\njob as a longshoreman right after my father had passed away, unloading ships\n\nat the port in Newark. And that's a great job if you didn't go to college.\n\nYou can make, you know, 80 grand a year with overtime. And I quit. I saved\n\nup a few grand and I quit to try comedy. Now, a lot of mothers would've\n\nwent--especially old-school Italian mothers--be like, `Don't quit this job!\n\nIt's such a great job!' She was never like that. She was like, `This is your\n\ndream. I believe in you. Go try it.' So I think she always knew I had it in\n\nme, but the level of success I've had, maybe she didn't, you know, sort of\n\npredict that, because I've been very lucky, you know.\n\nGROSS: Well, Artie, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much.\n\nMr. LANGE: Thanks. I hope this was all right. I feel like--in this\n\natmosphere, you really do, you even pour your heart out more than on Stern,\n\nbecause there's just two people. It's like a one-on-one. It really does feel\n\nlike a shrink session. But this was...\n\nGROSS: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nMr. LANGE: So this--no, it's good.\n\nGROSS: So you going to go into therapy now?\n\nMr. LANGE: Maybe. Maybe I'll just keep coming here every day. We can do\n\nthis. Thank you very much, Terry. This was...\n\nGROSS: Thank you very much.\n\nMr. LANGE: ...a lot of fun. Thank you.\n\nBIANCULLI: Artie Lange of the \"Howard Stern Show,\" speaking with Terry Gross\n\nlast year. You can see him, and his movie \"Beer League,\" tonight on Comedy\n\nCentral.\n\nComing up, another archive interview. Author and activist Grace Paley who\n\ndied this week. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Author and poet Grace Paley discusses her life and\n\ncareer\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nAuthor, poet and activist Grace Paley died this week of breast cancer. She\n\nwas 84. When she was named New York's first official state writer in 1986,\n\nshe said the only thing nicer might is if she got an award from her block.\n\nThat's because she became famous and acclaimed for writing about the\n\nneighborhood and the everyday life of her neighbors: in the Bronx where she\n\nwas born and raised, in the village where she raised her family, and in\n\nVermont where she lived out her life with her husband, playwright Robert\n\nNichols. Though her career as a writer spanned have a century, Paley\n\npublished only three collections of short stories: \"The Little Disturbances\n\nof Man\" in 1959, \"Enormous Changes at the Last Minute\" in 1974, and \"Later the\n\nSame Day,\" in 1985. In addition to her writing, Paley was known for her work\n\nas a women's rights and peace activist. The FBI kept a file on her in the\n\n'60s. Terry spoke with Grace Paley in 1985. Here's Paley reading an excerpt\n\nof a story from her collection \"Later the Same Day.\"\n\nMs. GRACE PALEY: (Reading) \"First I wrote this poem: `Walking up the slate\n\npath of the college park under the nearly full moon, the brown oak leaves are\n\nred as maples and I have been looking at the young people. They speak and\n\nembrace one another. Because of them I thought I would descend into\n\nremembering love, so I let myself down, hand over hand, until my feet touched\n\nthe earth of the gardens of Veasy Street.' I told my husband, `I've just\n\nwritten a poem about love.' `What a good idea,' he said. Then he told me\n\nabout Sally Johnson on Lake Winnipesaukee, who was twelve and a half when he\n\nwas 14. Then he told me about Rosemary Johanson on Lake Sunapee. Then he\n\ntold me about Jane Marsden in Concord High. Then he told me about Mary Smythe\n\nof Radcliffe when he was a poet at Harvard. Then he told me about two famous\n\npoets, one fair and one dark, both now dead, when he was a secret poet working\n\nat an acceptable trade in an office without windows. When at last he came to\n\nmy time, that is the past 15 years or so, he told me about Dottie Wasserman.\"\n\n\"`Hold on,' I said. `What do you mean, Dottie Wasserman? She's a character\n\nin a book. She's not even a person.' `OK,' he said. `Then why Veasy Street?\n\nWhat's that?' `Well, it's nothing special. I used to be in love with a guy\n\nwho was a shrub buyer. Veasy Street was the downtown garden center of the\n\ncity when the city still had wonderful centers of commerce. I used to walk\n\nthe kids there when they were little carriage babies half asleep, maybe take\n\nthe ferry to Hoboken. Years later I'd bike down there on Sundays, ride around\n\nand around. I even saw him three times.' `No kidding,' said my husband. `How\n\ncome I don't know the guy?' Ugh. The stupidity of the beloved. `It's you,' I\n\nsaid. `Anyway, what's this baloney about you and Dottie Wasserman?'\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThe voices that you write with for the narrator...\n\nMs. PALEY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...and for the characters, I think they're really like vernacular\n\nvoices and they're always so perfect. Everybody doesn't speak the same.\n\nEverybody has their own really distinctive way of speaking. It's very--for\n\nsome of them it's very ethnic, for others it's just very urban. You grew up\n\nin the Bronx...\n\nMs. PALEY: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ... in the 1920s. Can you describe what your neighborhood was like?\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, every week somebody's furniture was on the street. I mean,\n\nthat's my first memories of my block is that all of these people were evicted,\n\nwell, everyday. And you'd see this pile of furniture out there covered with\n\nnewspapers and covered with tarpaulin. And it was mostly, it was practically\n\nentirely Jewish and people there came from East Europe, Poland and Russia\n\nmostly. And in our house, the languages that were spoken were Russian,\n\nYiddish and English...\n\nGROSS: Did you speak all of those?\n\nMs. PALEY: ...and they were spoken in equal parts. Well, I never spoke\n\neither Yiddish or Russian well, but I always understood it very well and spoke\n\nit to my grandmother because she really never got English.\n\nGROSS: Were there real talkers in your family or in the neighborhood who you\n\nwould listen to and whose...\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, almost any...\n\nGROSS: ...speech you think really affects you now in your writing?\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, my father was a great talker. My mother was very quiet and\n\nI think probably because my father was such a great talker, but he really was\n\na good storyteller and very smart and very funny. And my mother was very\n\nserious and quite different but very straightforward and very honorable\n\nperson. And in the neighborhood, the people talked all the time. I mean,\n\npeople sat outside in the street, you know? The street life was very\n\nexciting. You couldn't get me--some summer nights--since I was the youngest\n\nby a lot, I was also overprotected and also neglected at the same time. Like\n\nI'd have to wear long stockings, you know, into the end of April but on the\n\nother hand they'd kind of forget that I was still outside at 11:00 at night on\n\na summer night. So I had that kind of happy mixture.\n\nBut the street was full of people and it was a great--I think all writers are\n\npeople who get in the habit, who love to listen, who listen a lot so that one\n\nof the stories in this book is called \"The Story Hearer\" and it's really what\n\nevery storyteller has to be.\n\nGROSS: Were there stories that would get told to you over and over again or\n\nwas it not that kind of storytelling? Was it just like more like gossip in\n\nthe street that people would talk about?\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, first of all, I have a lot of regard for gossip. I regard\n\nit as the last great oral tradition. And the reason it's called gossip is\n\nthat women do it so that therefore it's kind of denigrated for that reason.\n\nSo those were stories to me, you know, that people told about their life.\n\n`What happened to you yesterday?' You know, that kind of story. `What\n\nhappened?' `Oh.' You know? `So he came home then, did he?' `Yeah.' You know?\n\nAnd all of that kind of thing. And then the stories of my family at home were\n\nalways, they were always telling what had happened, well, first in Europe and\n\nthen here. And there was a lot to hear and a lot to listen to. And you\n\nlisten because you think, `Oh, this is going to be my life. This is my life.\n\nI'm hearing my future. I'm hearing what I'm about.'\n\nGROSS: When you started writing, did you go through a period of wanting to\n\nget the neighborhood out of your voice?\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, no. Once when I wrote stories I was what I was, you know?\n\nAnd I never felt I wanted to change my language in my own speech. I remember\n\nwhen we were going to school and there was something that I used to call\n\nHunter College English and I swore to God I'd never talk like that, no matter\n\nwhat happened, you know? It seemed like a theft of my language, of my New\n\nYorkese, and it bothered me. And there was a lot of the older people, a\n\nlittle bit older than I, were among my sister and brother's friends really had\n\nbegun to talk like that. And also, I don't think people realize this but\n\nduring the Depression, or after the Depression, the only jobs people began to\n\ngo into were teaching. Women could go into teaching. Well, the exams they\n\ngave in New York for teachers, and that included my sister and many of her\n\nfriends and my sister-in-law, the exams they gave were very strict orals. So\n\nthose orals were really designed at that time, although it seems now that\n\nthree quarters of the teachers in the city of New York, say, are Jewish. It\n\nseems like that whether it's true or not. At that time those exams were\n\ndesigned to keep immigrants out, and so people were going around like crazy\n\ntrying to talk American, you know, and taking classes in it. And that was\n\nwhat used to drive me mad. I mean, I would just say, `Oh, you're all talking\n\nHunter College English.' Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You didn't start writing short stories until you were in your 30s.\n\nWhy weren't you writing short stories before? It just seems such the natural\n\nform for you.\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, I thought my natural form was poetry. It's easy to say\n\nthat now. But I thought of myself as a poet. I never thought of myself as a\n\npoet. I always thought of myself as a poem writer, but in my 30s the poems\n\ncouldn't serve me, I mean, for what I wanted to and for what I was thinking\n\nabout. And of course what I was really thinking about and what was pressuring\n\nme in my life, which is where things come from really, is something about\n\nwomen and men and how we live and how we were not living together well on this\n\nearth. And also by then I'd had a couple of kids and I'd gotten much closer\n\nto women and thought a lot about women's lives and I was very interested in\n\nthem, and that's what I wanted to understand. I mean, you come to writing not\n\nfrom what you know but you come to it with what you don't know, and that's\n\nwhat presses you to go on.\n\nGROSS: How much did you want your political views and your political activism\n\nto enter into your stories?\n\nMs. PALEY: Well, I can't say I ever felt I pushed them in. I mean, I think\n\nwhen I began to write about women in the beginning, those were really--that\n\nwas not so much a political view as it was a political concern. That is to\n\nsay, when you write, you really--what you do is you illuminate what's hidden\n\nand that's a political act. So if I did, and I hope I did, illuminate the\n\nlives of the women I knew who were alone with kids and all that, that was a\n\npolitical act. So I illuminated them. They didn't happen--whatever their\n\npolitical positions were, that was another story, but that was from the\n\nbeginning political so to speak.\n\nAs for all the other interests of the women, insofar as--in the way that it's\n\na natural part of their lives, I certainly want it in there. I am interested,\n\nas I said, in certain events and then certain directions and world trends and\n\nI am fearful for the world, and of course that has to get into it. You\n\ncan--it's not a question of want. It's there. You don't want or you do want.\n\nThere isn't anyone who writes a novel or a story that it isn't political one\n\nway or another.\n\nBIANCULLI: Grace Paley, speaking with Terry Gross in 1985. The author, poet,\n\nand activist died this week at the age of 84.\n\nComing up, film critic David Edelstein on \"The Nanny Diaries.\"\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Film critic David Edelstein on \"The Nanny Diaries\"\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\n\"The Nanny Diaries\" is a new film based on the best-selling book. It stars\n\nLaura Linney, as the composite character Mrs. X, and Scarlett Johansson as\n\nNanny. Film critic David Edelstein has a review.\n\nMr. DAVID EDELSTEIN: I've heard the juiciest stories from nannies who have\n\nplenty of time on the playground to trade intimate details with other nannies.\n\nThat's why caregivers of celebrities' kids sign nondisclosure agreements.\n\nStill, Britney's disgruntled nannies are everywhere. Madonna was able to halt\n\npublication of her English nanny's tell-all, but the proposal got out, and let\n\nme tell you, it was irresistibly vicious.\n\nEmma Mclaughlin and Nicola Kraus's best-selling novel-slash-roman a clef \"The\n\nNanny Diaries\" targeted the families of Upper East Side Manhattan finance\n\nbigwigs and lawyers: the absent dads, the smartly turned-out wives who don't\n\nwork but are still so self-obsessed they have little time for their kids, and\n\nthe children both spoiled and neglected. The book is contemptuous, but in its\n\nghastly way funny, with a vein of sympathy for the sad, angry little boy who\n\nno sooner forms a relationship with a nanny, then she's fired for some\n\nminiscule offense.\n\nThe writer/directors of the film are Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini,\n\nwho came up with a marvelous ironic framing device for Harvey Pekar's\n\n\"American Splendor,\" and have another good one here. Scarlett Johansson plays\n\nAnnie, an unaffected working-class recent college grad with an interest in\n\nanthropology. And the film begins in New York's Museum of Natural History,\n\nwhere Annie presents us with a series of fake dioramas featuring Manhattan\n\nfamilies, placing their child-rearing rituals in a world historical context.\n\nIt's a good surreal start. Most American movies down play issues of class and\n\nprivilege. Unfortunately, the people we meet have no more depth or surprise\n\nthan those diorama figures.\n\nAfter failing a Wall Street interview because, she tells us, she doesn't know\n\nwho she is, Annie wanders through Central Park and finds herself set upon by\n\nyoung Grayer and then his mom, Mrs. X, played by Laura Linney. With scarcely\n\nany time to orient herself, Annie, hereafter known as Nanny, finds herself\n\nsleeping in a cramped back bedroom in a sumptuous apartment and trying to\n\nraise a child almost on her own. Her mom, a nurse played by Donna Murphy,\n\nwould be devastated to know her daughter is working as a domestic instead of\n\non Wall Street; so in phone calls home, Annie tells whoppers.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Nanny Diaries\")\n\nMs. DONNA MURPHY: (As Annie's mother) How are you, honey? How's the job?\n\nHow's the apartment?\n\nMs. SCARLETT JOHANSSON: (As Annie) Oh, God. Everything is just perfect. I\n\nmean, the job is a dream and the apartment is just incredible.\n\nMs. MURPHY: (As Annie's mother) Yeah?\n\nMs. JOHANSSON: (As Annie) And my roommate could not be nicer.\n\nMs. LAURA LINNEY: (As Ms. X) Nanny, in the morning I need you to stop at\n\nTiffany's and get Mr. X's watch. Then I need you to Xerox some\n\nrecommendation letters for Grayer's collegiate application. Also, I was\n\nthinking, we should introduce French food into his diet. It might enhance his\n\nstudy of the language. So tomorrow night why don't you make him Coquille St.\n\nJacques for dinner. Hmm?\n\nMs. JOHANSSON: (As Annie) Mm-hmm?\n\nMs. LINNEY: (As Ms. X) Dry cleaning.\n\nMs. MURPHY: (As Annie's mother) Who was that? Your roommate?\n\nMs. JOHANSSON: (As Annie) Mom, I have to go. I have some work stuff to take\n\ncare of.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. EDELSTEIN: Laura Linney is the best thing in \"The Nanny Diaries, \" her\n\nface a tight mask under which you catch glimpses of the frightened human\n\nbeing. In some ways, though, she kills the comedy. The poor woman is so\n\nobviously suffering. Scarlett Johansson isn't a comedian either. She's funny\n\nwhen she uses her drugged sexiness to convey lazy entitlement, as in \"Ghost\n\nWorld.\" But adorably clumsy and eager to please? That's a stretch.\n\nAs Mr. X, the myopic horndog mergers and acquisitions tycoon, a strawberry\n\nblond Paul Giamatti seems just as checked out as his character. Alicia Keys\n\nis wasted as the sassy sidekick, a tired device. And Chris Evans is the rich\n\nguy in the Xes's building, whom Nanny calls the \"Harvard hottie\" and whose\n\ninsipid decency allows Annie to reject upper East Side values but potentially\n\nmarry into the world anyway.\n\nIt's possible that the filmmakers are too humanistic for their material. They\n\ncan't get past the exploitation of the help and the neglect of a child, which\n\nis fine, admirable. But the balance is off. \"The Nanny Diaries\" is too\n\nshallow and unsurprising to be good social criticism, and too grimly unfunny\n\nto be a good satirical chick flick.\n\nBIANCULLI: David Edelstein is film critic for New York Magazine.\n\nPodcasts of the show are available at our Web site, freshair.npr.org.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
