        "text": "Artie Lange\n\nComedian and actor Artie Lange\n\n(AP photo)\n\nIf it's true that some humorists can take the tragedy in their lives and turn it into hilarious comedy routines, then Artie Lange's stand-up on Saturday at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn., should be side splitting.\n\nWhen it comes to his comedy, Lange, who many know for his eight years on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" said he isn't a \"pigeonhole type of guy.\"\n\n\"I don't understand comedians who say they are clean, dirty, Republican, Democrat or this or that. It's hard enough to write jokes when you have no boundaries without pigeonholing yourself. I talk about everything. My comedy is observational. It's about everything in the news and about my life. I was a big drug addict for a while, and that combined with my regular life has led to a lot of stories to tell through jokes that I hope will help others in their struggles,\" Lange said.\n\n\"Of course, I'll be talking about Trump for at least a half hour. There's a lot of jokes about the election....a lot of stuff in your face every day and I expect more from the inauguration on Friday,\" he added.\n\nWhen Lange was young, the comedian once dreamed of playing baseball, and was actually an All-County third baseman while at Union High School in New Jersey.\n\nBut life had other plans for Lange than playing professional baseball, who after graduating high school encountered his first major tragedy in life. His beloved father, a cable installer, fell off a roof rendering him a quadriplegic. He died four years later.\n\nIt was his father, who without knowing it, set Lange on a life's path to comedy.\n\n\"I didn't go to college. We had no money and I didn't want to go anyway. I wanted to get out into life and start living. I was always funny in high school, but not in an official way,\" said the high school prankster.\n\n\"I've always loved comedy shows like \"The Odd Couple\" and even older, \"The Honeymooners\" on television....loved listening to comics like Woody Allen, Richard Pryor and Howard Stern. Stern was without question my biggest influence in life, even before I went on to work on his show,\" Lange added.\n\nIt was Lange's father who introduced Stern's outrageous form of live radio to his son.\n\n\"I was 13 when one day my dad told me he was going to bring me to work with his tomorrow. 'You've got to hear this guy Howard Stern on the radio,' he said to me. And we would listen to him between jobs. I could imitate the people on his show and make my dad laugh. That's when I realized that I was having a blast doing it and from then on I never wanted to be anything else than a comedian,\" Lange said.\n\nFrom longshoreman after his father died to comedian, Lange paid his dues in the comedy clubs of New York City where he played his first gig at New York's Improv in Hell's Kitchen. He went on to help create the popular sketch comedy group Live on Tape after writing and performing with other troupes. His breakout work with Live on Tape landed him his debut television role as one of the original series regulars on Fox's \"Mad TV.\"\n\nBut with success and all the stress and temptations that come along with it for some, Lange began to abuse drugs and was arrested for possessing cocaine, leading to his dismissal from the television show that earned him many new followers.\n\nAfter a stint in rehab, Saturday Night Live alum and friend Norm MacDonald came to Lange's rescue casting him in his first starring role on the big screen, the MGM feature \"Dirty Work.\" His appearance in the movie was followed by a string of feature films, including New Line's \"The Bachelor,\" starring opposite Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger; \"Lost and Found\" with David Spade for Warner Brothers; Kinka Usher's \"Mystery Men;\" and the independent drama \"The Fourth Floor,\" opposite Juliette Lewis and William Hurt. Lange also had supporting roles in the Dreamworks feature film \"Old School\" and New Line Cinema's \"Elf.\" He also starred, co-wrote and produced his own feature film, \"Beer League,\" which Richard Roeper gave a \"Thumbs Up\" and the readers of The New York Times rated it four out of five stars.\n\nIt was while appearing on Stern's radio show to promote one of his films, that Lange drew the attention of the popular shock jock and eventually replaced joke writer Jackie Martling on the radio show. That stint with his idol lasted for some eight years before falling into his past ways, eventually attempting suicide and leaving the show.\n\nBecoming \"clean and sober\" after a seven-month stay in rehab in Florida, Lange soon found himself returning to radio in 2011 via Direct TV along with friend Nick DiPaolo. Called \"The Nick and Artie Show,\" the nightly broadcast was focused on sports.\n\n\"I love doing radio, but will never go back to doing another show of my own. There's too much censorship,\" Lange said.\n\nInstead, Lange said he's happy with his own Artie Lange Uncensored Podcast found at artiequitter.com and making good money doing gigs like Foxwoods, which the comedian said he is looking forward to on Saturday. He's also looking forward to the debut of \"Crashing\" on HBO beginning Feb. 19. Lange has a recurring role as himself in the new comedy series created and starring Pete Holmes and directed by Judd Apatow.\n\n\"I love Foxwoods. They make you feel like Sinatra there,\" said Lange about performing in the Fox Theater."
