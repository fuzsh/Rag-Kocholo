        "text": "Artie Lange's Beer League\n\nThis was the official site for Artie Lange's Beer League, an over the top comedy that was initially released in 2006. The site remained active announcing the DVD release and offering its sale. In 2012 the site provided posts about the films about the reception, the actors, some of the symbolism, the plot, how it did in theatres.\n\nContent is from the site's archived pages as well as other sources. The quotes which are shown below, offer a pretty good sense of the type of humor/ comedy one will find in this film\n\nRelease date: September 15, 2006\n\n(NY, Philadelphia, Cleveland)\n\nStudio:Echo Bridge Entertainment\n\nDirector: Frank Sebastiano\n\nMPAA Rating: R (for non-stop language including strong sexual references, sexuality, nudity and drug use)\n\nScreenwriters: Artie Lange, Frank Sebastiano\n\nStarring: Artie Lange, Ralph Macchio, Anthony DeSando, Cara Buono, Jerry Minor, Laurie Metcalf, Jimmy Breuer\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nPOSTS 2012 -2013\n\nQuotes from the Film\n\nJohnny Trinno: [giving the toast at Maz's wedding] So to recap, throughout it all, there's been a lot of laughter, and a few tears. But in the end the clouds parted, and the good Lord himself decided it was meant to be. And that's how I finished the regular season batting .706.\n\n+++\n\nDirt: Hey! I don't wanna see any a you Italians drinking from my water bottle! Damned wops!\n\n+++\n\nJohnny Trinno: It's unfair, it's like pitching to a healthy Lou Gehrig.\n\n+++\n\nGina: Okay, you know what? I'm not being a bitch here. You're missing Marie's recital tonight, and I said we could wait 'til after the softball season to go on our honeymoon. I even let you pick your scumbag friend Artie as best man!\n\nMaz: Sweetheart, listen, huh? It's the first game of the season. I just don't wanna be late, alright? I'm with you on the cakes, I'll look at 'em later.\n\nGina: You know, I was gonna surprise you by making your little plastic man on the cake a Derek Jeter action figure. But now? No. I'm making you one of those Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets!\n\nMaz: Don't even joke like that, Gina!\n\n+++\n\nMaz: I'll have an egg-white omelet made with very little oil, dry wheat toast, and grapefruit juice.\n\nJohnny Trinno: Oh my god, that's the gayest order I've ever heard.\n\nArtie DeVanzo: You know, in Massachusetts, that order could legally marry a dude.\n\nMaz: Alright, here it comes.\n\nJohnny Trinno: You know, just placing an order like that would get you kicked out of the army.\n\nArtie DeVanzo: You know, if you put a construction helmet on that order, it could join the Village People.\n\nRhonda: Would you guys knock it off so I can do my job?\n\nMaz: Thank you.\n\nRhonda: Alright, Maz, that's an egg-white omelet, dry wheat toast, grapefruit juice.\n\nMaz: That's right.\n\nRhonda: Do you want a side order of cock with that?\n\n+++\n\nLinda Salvo: I'm so embarrassed right now.\n\nArtie DeVanzo: You're embarrassed? I just got cock-blocked by my mom!\n\n+++\n\nDirt: You look like a bunch of Monkeys trying fuck a football!\n\n+++\n\nArtie DeVanzo: [imitating Yankees PA Announcer Bob Sheppard] Your attention please, now pitching for Mangenelli: Number 1, Needle Dick,\n\n[Artie's team laughs]\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Number 1\n\nDennis Mangenelli: Yeah, all right!\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Needle Dick.\n\nIs this interesting? | Share this\n\nArtie DeVanzo: You know, Dave, you might be a lefty.\n\n+++\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Hey, are we done here? 'Cause I'm losing my buzz.\n\nIs this interesting? | Share this\n\nDirt: You're a fat fucking disgrace!\n\n+++\n\nMaz: [responding to Artie about un-inviting Mangenelli to the wedding] He's Gina's cousin, he's going to be there, and don't start any trouble.\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.\n\nJohnny Trinno: Oh my God you fat fuckin' liar.\n\n+++\n\nMaz: Alright, Dirt. Just throw it in there, baby. Come on!\n\nArtie DeVanzo: [punches glove] Whatta you say now Dirt, you character.\n\n+++\n\nArtie DeVanzo: If you put a construction hat on that order, it could be one of the village people.\n\n+++\n\nAlfonse: Check it out, my new italiano mit.\n\nMaz: That's cool, Alfonse.\n\nJohnny Trinno: How much of a guido could you possibly be?\n\n+++\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Ohh! Alright, listen up. Anybody that doesn't do a pregame shot with me is a fuckin' pussy.\n\nDennis Mangenelli: Jerk off!\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Hey, did this jerk off just call me a jerk off?\n\n+++\n\nJohnny Trinno: [speaking in an announcer-type voice] Now coming to bat is Artie DeVanzo. Last season was a fine one for DeVanzo, we all know that. He batted 420 with 45 RBIs. He enters today's game with a Blood Alcohol Content of .16. If you kids scoring at home, that is an impressive *twice* the legal limit.\n\n+++\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Come on let's get this guy! Let's get this punk! He's nothin'! He's a loser! He's an asshole! A cock sucker! He's a total piece a shit!\n\nDennis Mangenelli: You shut up fatso!\n\nArtie DeVanzo: Hey, watch the name-calling!\n\n+++\n\nBeerLeagueTheMovie.com"
