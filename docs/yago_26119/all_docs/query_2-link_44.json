During the first game of the season his team gets into a fight with their rivals and both teams are arrested. The compromise upon release is the team that outperforms the other during the season gets to stay and the loser must join another league. Thus begins Ed's Bar & Swill softball team's quest to get better at the game and earn their place.\n\nTwo things I love are beer and baseball. The two go hand in hand, especially if you're a long suffering New York Mets fan. In fact, sometimes you need a few beers in you to watch those bums. I popped in Beer League and in less than three minutes, I knew I was gonna like this film. Boy, was I right.\n\nStarring Artie Lange of The Howard Stern Show fame before his nose collapsed into his face from massive drug use, Beer League is my kind of raunchy old school comedy flick that released near the end of the genre's glory days. The late 2000s and early 2010s would mostly kill off this brand of humor as people's sensitivities took the wheel. This is not a film for those who use terms like \"trigger warning.\" It's a film for the old Howard Stern Show fans and robust sense of humors.\n\nThe rest of the cast is top notch as well with names like Ralph Macchio, Tina Fey, various actors from The Sopranos, and a list of comedians who frequented radio talk shows like the aforementioned Howard Stern Show as well as the Opie and Anthony Show. People who were born and raised in New York City and the greater metro area extending into New Jersey around this time are very familiar with this crowd.\n\nBeer League isn't one of the best comedies ever made but it's underrated and a hell of a lot of fun. This one is definitely going on the re-watch list to revisit in a few years. Good stuff."
