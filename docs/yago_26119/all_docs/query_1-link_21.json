        "text": "DVD Releases for July 29, 2008 - Part I\n\nJuly 29th, 2008\n\nAnother slow week without a single first run release that was a must have, or even a contender for DVD Pick of the Week. Granted, many will find Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay worth picking up, but it is not a top-notch release. There are also a couple of special edition releases that are easily worth picking up: Dark City - Director's Cut - Buy from Amazon: DVD or Blu-ray and WarGames - 25th Anniversary Edition. But the best of the best, and the DVD Pick of the Week is Stargate - Continuum - Buy from Amazon: DVD or Blu-ray. But I am also giving an honorable mention to Two Fat Ladies - Buy from Amazon. On a side note, it is another week where we had to split the list into two due to the size. Part II can be found here. More...\n\nDVD Releases for April 1, 2008\n\nApril 1st, 2008\n\nA mixed week when it comes to top-notch releases and there were very few that caught my eye. There are several that are worth picking up, but only Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Baker Street - 2-Disc Special Edition was a contender for DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nDVD Releases for January 2, 2007\n\nJanuary 3rd, 2007\n\nWow. This is a terrible week for DVD releases. There are only a handful worth mentioning, and none that are must haves. Snakes on a Plane - Buy from Amazon is the best of the short list, but even here there's legitimate reasons not to buy. Interestingly, there are a ton of re-releases coming out tomorrow. So many that there are drowning out the real releases. More...\n\nMum's the Word\n\nSeptember 19th, 2006\n\nAfter struggling nearly everywhere it played, including its native U.K., Keeping Mum led the way on the per theatres charts with an average of $13,556 in two theatres. This could be enough for it to earn some measure of mainstream success, but that's far from guaranteed. The U.S. vs John Lennon opened with nearly $70,000 in 6 theatres for an average of $11,524, which was just ahead of the only holdover to top $10,000, Man Push Cart with $11,002 in its lone theatre. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for September 9 - September 15\n\nSeptember 16th, 2006\n\nHigh quantity on sites this week, but many of them were for new releases, most of which haven't had any updates in a while. Those that did have updates were generally quite small, but one site stood above them all, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny - Official Site, which is easily the winner of the Weekly Website Award. More...\n\nLimited Releases Sure to Spark Conversation\n\nSeptember 15th, 2006\n\nIt's a tough week for limited releases, not because there is a lack of quantity or quality, but because of nature of the films, many of which are difficult to talk about without potentially offending readers. This is because there are a quartet of documentaries that deal with political matters. One of them, Jesus Camp, even combines politics and religion, which is a sure path to flamewars. While that film is surely the most contentious, it is also the best reviewed film of the week and the controversial nature could help it become the biggest hit. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - September 3, 2006\n\nSeptember 3rd, 2006\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains new release dates 300, James Bond 22 and more. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for August 19 - August 25\n\nAugust 26th, 2006\n\nIt's another busy week with nearly three dozen films being represented here. Taking top prize is Invincible - Official Site, although there were a few others that could take that claim before all is said and done. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for July 29 - August 4\n\nAugust 4th, 2006\n\nThird week in a row where the number of sites featured on this list has topped 30. With such a busy week it would take something different to win the award, and that's something Michel Gondry excels at delivering giving The Science of Sleep - Official Site the Weekly Website Award.
