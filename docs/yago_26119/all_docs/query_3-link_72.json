        "text": "Image via HBO\n\n94.\n\nEight years ago today, our beloved boys from Queens went off the air for the final time. Through 96 episodes and a movie, we vicariously lived through Vince, E, Drama and Turtle as they conquered Hollywood in Entourage, HBO's ultimate wish fulfillment fantasy show. While there were some admittedly forgettable episodes of Entourage, nobody can forget the characters, the cars and the cameos. So in honor of the eight year anniversary of Entourage’s series finale, Complex endeavored to rank every celebrity cameo from every single episode of the show. All 121 of them. To do so we enlisted the only person we could entrust to such a task, JR Hickey the genius behind Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah: The Entourage Podcast, where he breaks down a new episode of the show with a different guest every Monday morning (he’s about halfway through Season 3 at the moment if you want to tune in.)\n\nSome rules: First, JR is only focusing on the show itself and leaving Entourage (the movie) out of it (there might have been 121 cameos in the film alone). Most crucially, he’s also sticking to true cameos: celebrities who played themselves or a bit part for a non-recurring appearance in the show. So anybody who came on and had a major character arc throughout a season was ruled out. Sorry Mandy, Dice and Seth Green.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive in. Oh yeah!\n\n93.Will Sasso, \"Dog Day Afternoon\" (Season 3, Episode 14)\n\nLet’s get this out of the way: a few aspects of the show didn’t age well. Since its premiere in 2004, times have changed, language has changed and the way people are portrayed on television has changed too. When Lloyd (Rex Lee) was introduced in Season 2, he was a refreshing foil to Ari Gold’s nuclear personality.\n\nLlyod has a nice character development throughout the remainder of the show, but it’s in this late third season episode where we see him used as bait for the predatory, over the top TV writer played by comedian Will Sasso. All the standard lecherous gay stereotypes are used and ultimately Ari Gold saves the day by “rescuing” Lloyd from his would-be client. Just a bad performance and character that doesn’t fit into the Entourage universe at all.\n\n92.\n\nHow fitting that here at the end of the list we have a cameo from the very beginning of the show? Ali Larter had a run in the late 90’s-early 2000s (Final Destination, Legally Blonde, Varsity Blues) but her telling E to go fuck himself because Vince wasn’t calling her back probably doesn’t resonate as much in 2019 as it makes many people say “Who’s that again?”\n\n91.Snoop Dogg, \"The Dream Team\" (Season 4, Episode 5)\n\nThis one was tough because we love Snoop, but this cameo came at the apex of the show just jamming somebody into a scene to say what’s up to the crew and nothing more. He’s used as a plot device to break it to the boys that the Medellin trailer leaked on YouTube, and Vince and E’s reaction is plausible. But Snoop just appearing out of nowhere like an apparition felt contrived. I am going to start saying “Success and nothing less” as a farewell, though.\n\n90.\n\nAri’s in crisis prevention mode and needs to lock down his A-list clients, and one of those is inexplicably Mike Tyson. Iron Mike trying to rehab his image is a funny idea but as with all of his acting roles, it doesn’t come across as genuine. Also, did he insist on having his kids on set and that’s why they’re crawling all over Ari’s desk?\n\n89.\n\nOf all the pornstars who have cameoed on this show, Katie Morgan’s freeway flash is the most forgettable in an unforgettable episode of the show.\n\n88.\n\nMaybe I’m having a hard time given the troubling allegations that have come out against Danny since, but this didn’t do it for me. It does show how versatile he was back then though. E says it himself, the guy’s got a radio show, owns real estate, That 70’s Show, etc.\n\n87.\n\nTwo-time NBA MVP status notwithstanding, it shouldn’t be surprising that Nash’s acting ability didn’t exactly hold water. Especially his “ouch bro” in response to E discussing his girl troubles. Ouch bro is right, Steve.\n\n86.\n\nI’m sure that when Alice Eve got cast as the sophisticated journalist Sophia in the final season of the show, she was excited to sink her teeth into a role that wasn’t that of “attractive woman who sleeps with Vince/wants to sleep with Vince.” Unfortunately, having Vinny fall head of heels for her and propose in a 20 minute period in the series finale was what ultimately turned fans off to her completely.\n\n85.\n\nOof, just rolling out all the classy cameos at the bottom of the list here. Even though he’s playing himself, on set actually directing Rush Hour 3 and he finally relents to Drama’s incessant pleading for a bit part in it, he still gives off the vibe of scumbag doofus while he’s photographing Marisa Miller and complimenting her ass in a house full of models.\n\n84.\n\nThe only male pornstar to make a cameo on the show, Gunn plays Sasha Grey’s fictional ex-boyfriend “Vince” who Vince Chase takes umbrage with on-set of his girlfriend’s porn movie. Tommy Gunn shows us that he’s better off acting with his clothes off than on in this tepid, forgettable scene.\n\n83.\n\nHere’s my question: how could E possibly identify Dr. Joyce Brothers that quickly at a market in Malibu amongst a sea of rich old women that were probably shopping there at the same time?\n\n82.\n\nAn early appearance for a young Anthony Anderson—at this point in his career he’d starred in movies like Barbershop and Kangaroo Jack, along with a dozen other character-actor parts across a spread of popular films. However, him demanding that Vince get him a role in Aquaman and reminding him to “Make sure they pay me my quote” seemed like a stretch for someone who hadn’t exactly blown up just yet.\n\n81.\n\nLyla Garrity was just minding her own business at Eminem’s party at the Roosevelt Hotel when a Jack and coke’d out Vincent Chase hits on her. While her being there was believable, her acting was not.\n\n80.\n\nJessica Simpson is not messing around in her cameo. She is here to tell Ari Gold that she’s “Going with Lizzie” in reference to Lizzie Grant, the scorned Miller-Gold employee who threatens Ari with a lawsuit. I wish instead of going with Lizzie that she’d gone to an acting class or two since her failed reality show.\n\n79.Marisa Miller, \"The Prince's Bride\" (Season 3, Episode 19)\n\nI guess standing there in lingerie in front of a motorcycle and enduring \"compliments\" from Brett Ratner gets you higher than him on this list. But not by much.\n\n78.\n\nIn the convoluted series finale, Ari greets a who’s who of NFL coaches of yesteryear. It always blows me away (and this is coming from a Chicago Bears fan) how quickly Coach Ditka is willing to appear as himself in literally anything.\n\n77.\n\nIn a star studded scene that included LeBron James and Matt Damon, blink and you’ll miss former Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds. He was probably trying to practice in front of the camera before his debut on The Real Housewives of Orange County.\n\n76.\n\nIn that same episode, the entire scene with Bono being on Skype/Facetime was absurd. Hey, how many A+ list celebrities can we jam into one episode? Here’s Bono on a Macbook!\n\n75.\n\nEric, have you met chubby Kevin Love?\n\n74.Bobby Flay, \"Whiz Kid\" (Season 8, Episode 4); \"The Big Bang\" (Season 8, Episode 6)\n\nThere were a few problems with this cameo. First, Mrs. Ari leaves Ari for essentially not paying enough attention to her and the family. So she starts dating arguably one of the most popular/busiest chefs in the world? How much more attention is he going to pay her? And the kicker was that the Iron Chef ends up being the person who revealed Mrs. Ari’s first name, which felt like totally unnecessary fan service. Get back in the kitchen, Bob.\n\n73.Johnny Galecki, \"Home Sweet Home\" (Season 8, Episode 1); \"Second to Last\" (Season 8, Episode 7)\n\nIt didn’t surprise me that Sloan, while taking one of her many breaks from dating E, would go out with a successful TV actor. What did surprise me was how poorly Galecki’s acting chops translated from CBS to Sunday night cable. Boy Sloan sure has a type doesn’t she?\n\n72.\n\nNot gonna lie, I loved Eric as the boy’s shroom dealer. His performance, though, was a tad bit over the top. Also, the fact that they leave him in the desert without a ride home is borderline criminal.\n\n71.\n\nIf Christina Aguilera really got all of Ari’s Lakers playoff tickets in 2010, she got to see them win their last championship as a franchise in 7 games over the Boston Celtics. Chances that she would have actually gone to any of the games though? Slim to none.\n\n70.\n\nWhile the exchange between Turtle and Bosh is funny (about how Bosh should have signed with Turtle’s Knicks over the Heat) Bosh offering the bartender $1,000 to hunt down some vodka for his girl wasn’t. Save your money Chris.\n\n69.\n\nSoap star and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills mainstay Lisa Rinna was really hamming it up in this role as one of Drama’s past flings. Hamming it up so much that one of her lines is “Hey, what do you say we get out here and go fuck?” to a hot tub full of people. Classy.\n\n68.\n\nAll of these took place around Turtle's shady business deals, i.e. Avion Tequila or Don Peppe's, and happened over the phone between Turtle and said celebrity. We have Amar’e and Strahan playing pickup, and A-Rod and Tex taking calls literally during Yankees batting practice. While each cameo made me say, “Wow, they got ___?!” they were wooden performances and flimsy plot points at best.\n\n67.\n\nI almost forgot what Urlacher without hair looked like.\n\n66.\n\nIt’s funny to think of Ethan Suplee and Vince staying friends after filming Queens Boulevard together five years earlier. “Hey, you ever coming back? Because I’d love to come to your next house party.”\n\n65.\n\nPoor, poor Tony Bennett. The legendary crooner is out of his element in this early Season 5 episode and has to play second fiddle to Justine Chapin (Leighton Meester), a character who we wish had stayed in Season 1.\n\n64.Adrian Peterson, \"Dramedy\" (Season 7, Episode 3)\n\nThis subplot about AP selling a dinosaur skull at an auction makes a lot more sense now that we know that he isn’t very good with his money. Although it was a nice homage to Nic Cage paying a quarter of a billion dollars for a reportedly stolen dinosaur skull back in 2007.\n\n63.\n\nThe ladies from The View really do a number on Drama after his breakup. Add in the fact that it’s a live taping outside in Las Vegas really makes you feel trapped there on set with Drama. I’d probably cry too.\n\n62.\n\nKen Jeong famously was a practicing doctor early in his acting career. In this Season 3 episode from back in 2006, he was still three years away from his breakout roles in The Hangover and Community. Chances are he filmed this scene and the next day was listening to newborn heartbeats.\n\n61.\n\nDJ Quik will forever live in the Entourage HoF for playing the unedited version of Tony Yayo's “So Seductive” at Ari’s daughter’s Bat Mitzvah. Watching old Jewish grandparents and acclaimed actor Malcolm McDowell (try to) dance to it was truly iconic. DJ Quik, spin that shit!\n\n60.Phil Mickelson, \"ReDOMption\" (Season 5, Episode 6)\n\nWarners exec Alan Gray bringing along a golf ringer in the form of Phil Mickelson during a friendly competition between Ari and Bob Ryan was a stroke of genius. While Lefty’s acting wasn’t Emmy worthy, Ari’s reactions to him being there certainly made up for it.\n\n59.Gary Busey, \"Busey and the Beach,\" \"The Boys Are Back in Town,\" \"Gary's Desk\" (Seasons 1, 2, 4, Episodes 6, 1, 8)\n\nI almost didn’t include him on the list altogether. Out of the entire cast of cameos here he probably has the most speaking lines in total. The total number of speaking lines that make sense however? Not that many.\n\nHe famously told creator Doug Ellin, “Nobody writes Gary like Gary” and didn’t stick to a script in any of his three cameos. His first appearance at his own art show was legendary, his second appearance with the totem pole was forgettable and by the time he asks to paint “on” Johnny Drama I’d tired of him.\n\n58.Chris Penn, \"An Offer Refused\" (Season 2, Episode 4)\n\nOne of our first cameos who was taken from us too soon. Boxing with Drama over a previously paid debt for work Drama did on Penn’s house might not seem like a natural fit into the plot in the show. Looking back though, the idea that Drama needed calf implants so he went to Chris Penn’s gym to box him for the money still makes me smile. Nothing’s too absurd for the world of Entourage.\n\n57.\n\nThis 2009 episode where Zac leaves Adam Davies for Ari is a pretty forgettable one. While Efron’s done a ton for his personal image in the ten years since, at the time this didn’t feel like much more than a PR stunt to put him into something a little more “edgy.\" Get a haircut, young man!\n\n56.\n\nRibisi for decades was a child and character actor until his starring role as Sneaky Pete in 2015. I’m still not sure if playing the “smarter” half of the brotherly writing duo Nick & LB was what got him there, and I’m not sure if I enjoyed this character or loathed him. Either way, it lands him squarely in the middle of this list.\n\n55.\n\nPete Berg is one of many Hollywood directors who appear on this show playing themselves or a version of themselves. Berg’s no stranger to acting as he has over 50 credits to his name, but every time he appears on screen it’s like he just woke up from a coma and can’t remember what it was he was dreaming about.\n\n54.Sofia Vergara, \"Welcome to the Jungle\" (Season 4, Episode 1)\n\nEntourage did a good job of predicting the future: Aquaman, a Ferrari movie, etc. It also was the jumping off point for the careers of certain television stars. Vergara went from the role of “Village Girl” in the Season 4 premiere to the star of one of the most successful sitcoms of the 2000s. The twist of Drama being the one who slept with her over Billy Walsh was one for the ages.\n\n53.\n\nPhil? Phil Connors?!\n\n52.\n\nTom Sizemore chilling out in rehab and getting angry with Andrew Klein was an astoundingly self-aware cameo that only gets better over time.\n\n51.\n\nExchanging pleasantries in front of the host stand at Koi with Amanda Peet, what could be better than that? At first, she’s thoroughly uninterested in E but as soon as Shauna refers to him as Vince’s manager she perks right up. A fling between Vince and Amanda Peet would have made for an incredible plotline in 2005.\n\n50.\n\nAnother great one, gone too soon. RIP AM.\n\n49.\n\nDespite his current politics, James Woods playing the antagonist in the Season 3 premiere (and the bad guy in Aquaman) was an incredible flex. His actual girlfriend, Ashley Madison, cameoed alongside him and the violent noogie/face slap he gives Drama on Aquaman’s red carpet after Drama scammed him out of two premiere tickets still brings the laughs.\n\n48.Nick Cassavetes, \"Stunted\" (Season 7, Episode 1); \"Buzzed\" (Season 7, Episode 2)\n\nIn the Season 7 premiere, Big Dick Nick is bullying Vince into doing his own stunts. Why? Because “This is an important movie for him” and he doesn’t want VInce to come off “Like a pussy.” How many SAG rules does this violate? A convincing but altogether unremarkable cameo.\n\n47.\n\nAri thought he could invite his old frat brother over to rub his face in how much better his life was than him, but Howard-Stern-era Artie Lange one-upped him, showing up with Leslie Bibb in tow and three little words that saved his life: Stamps. Dot. Com.\n\n46.\n\nChicago icons Roeper and Phillips appear as themselves skewering Medellin in the Season 5 premiere. It was a nice meta reading of an event that the show had devoted entirely too much time to in the previous two seasons. The tidbit that Ari used to haze Roeper back at Northwestern was perfect, too.\n\n45.\n\nHey, I recognize these girls from somewhere. The fact that the Pussy Patrol ends up saving the day from the wrath of vengeful journalist RJ is what vaults them into the front half of this list. It wasn’t for their acting skills, believe me.\n\n44.Stan Lee, \"Bottoms Up\" (Season 7, Episode 5)\n\nSpeaking of porn...Stan Lee has seen Sasha Grey somewhere before, he just can’t put his finger in it, er, on it. Rest in peace, legend.\n\n43.\n\nIs there such a thing as the perfect reaction to Johnny Drama’s hello? Yes, there is.\n\n42.\n\nNew York acting legend Bruno Kirby was the perfect fit for the Lasseter-like animation mogul in this early Season 3 episode. Sadly, this was Bruno Kirby's final acting project as the ep aired a month before his death in August 2006 from leukemia. His on-screen son Nicky Rubenstein has to take up the producer mantle from here on out. Strangely enough, this is the second time an actor playing a producer set to recur more often died after being on Entourage. The first was Scott Wick in Season 2.\n\n41.\n\nVince asked, and E delivered. ScarJo was the first A-List movie star to appear on Entourage, and she’s the cherry on the sundae of a scene that stands out as one of the more authentic moments of male friendship. However, the performance itself comes across as a bit wooden, as it’s clear she was available for maybe a half hour to shoot her scene.\n\nWhy is she in Grand Central Station? Didn’t she say she just got in? And try watching the scene again and not notice her awkward \"byeee\" at the end of her very not-real phone conversation. Maybe I’m being picky, but hey, I do spend every week dissecting this stuff.\n\n40.\n\nBob Odenkirk must have been on hiatus from playing Saul Goodman back in 2010 to make an appearance as Mark Cuban’s right-hand-man Ken. And that’s OK, because we love ole’ Slippin’ Jimmy every time he graces our screen.\n\n39.David Spade, \"The Big Bang\" (Season 8, Episode 6)\n\nThis cameo worked well because it felt authentic to what comedians must deal with all the time when they’re not in New York in LA. I sound like a coastal elite saying that, but the truth of the matter is, in big cities, people respect a celebrity’s privacy more. “Write something funny” should be on every former SNL castmember’s tombstone.\n\n38.\n\nIt felt surreal seeing Aaron Sorkin acting in something he hadn’t written for himself.\n\n37.\n\nIt’s always such a treat to see Dan Castellaneta step out of the recording booth to play a 3D character. As the no-nonsense principal of Ari’s son’s school, he provides an interesting foil for Ari’s bullheadedness for a few episodes, literally reducing him to tears on his doorstep.\n\n36.\n\nTwo absolute comedy legends playing out-of-touch Beverly Hills parents throwing a three million dollar “Sweet Sixteen” birthday party = comedy gold.\n\n35.John Cleese, \"Lose Yourself\" (Season 7, Episode 10)\n\nOne of the members of Monty Python floating around in the world of Entourage was not something that would have tracked for me as a child. Or for my father as a child, at that. However, the idea of John Cleese being on his fourth or fifth marriage to a ditzy brunette with a bad attitude (and a demo) plus him commiserating about it with Ari was something I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n34.Jay Leno, \"Drive\" (Season 6, Episode 1)\n\nVince appearing on The Tonight Show in the Season 6 premiere signified that he was back on top of the industry. He was about to star in the Enzo Ferrari movie (another nice piece of Entourage foreshadowing) and is all smiles as he recounts his driver’s test on Jay’s couch. Funny enough, The Tonight Show was a month away from transitioning hosts to Conan O’Brien, and Jay was set to do The Jay Leno Show, which lasted all of six months.\n\n33.\n\nBud Bundy being in every acting class and audition Drama went to was one of the series' first great touches.\n\n32.\n\nDrama has a number of recurring nemeses across the show's eight seasons: Pauly Shore, meter maids, his own anger management. But none struck a cord quite like “The Director” played by Entourage creator Doug Ellin himself. It’s a clever performance by Doug, who embodies the aloof Hollywood stereotype and gets nicely under Drama’s skin.\n\n31.\n\nThis was the first authentic feeling cameo in the show’s first few episodes. It wasn’t the boys rounding a corner and Mark Walhberg appearing out of nowhere. Instead,they were at a crowded bar after a boxing match at the Staples Center with a drunk Jimmy Kimmel and Luke Wilson and were shooting the shit about home theater equipment. At the time, Luke was riding high after Old School and the added tension that he wasn’t getting along with his brother was sneaky funny.\n\n30.\n\nPaul Haggis has a nice little speech to Vince in this Season 3 episode that had a lot of Hollywood starpower packed into it. In it, he tells Vince he wants him to play “A human being”, a role Vince had never played before. While his acting in this episode might not have been Oscar worthy, his shelf full of golden statues behind him made the speech more believable.\n\n29.\n\nIn the exact same episode, we get a really touching scene between Hollywood icon Penny Marshall and Ari in the parking garage of his agency. They greet each other like old friends and it feels more like a loving Jewish aunt and her smart-aleck nephew than two legendary TV actors trading lines. Now that she's passed though, Ari’s farewell of “Quit smoking,” makes my heart twinge on rewatch.\n\n28.\n\nSomething tells me a spin-off prequel about Ralph Macchio and Johnny Drama pounding Cuervo at the Playboy Mansion would do very well today. Let’s just hope Ralph Macchio or Johnny Drama get a chance to audition for the pilot.\n\n27.\n\nIn this early episode that’s packed with cameos from Jimmy Kimmel and Luke Wilson, Sarah Silverman is one of my favorites because it shows how ruthless Ari Gold is. Initially, she thinks he’s hitting on her, when in actuality he’s trying to sign her. In the previous two episodes, Ari had made many references to his infidelity, and this was a nice course-correct from the character who never strays nor mentions straying from his marriage ever again.\n\n26.\n\nThe Season 5 finale is a top five episode, namely because the majority of it takes place in NYC and because Martin Scorsese swoops in with a job offer for Vince in the 25th hour. This may go against popular opinion, but I liked the split second Phelps cameo, and here’s why.\n\nAt the time, he was coming off the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he established himself as the most dominant and decorated Olympian ever. He definitely could have asked for more screen time. For whatever reason he didn’t and we’re left with a nice nod to him, as opposed to some dopey character or subplot where he convinces us of what we already knew: he can’t act.\n\n25.\n\nLamar Odom may be a punchline to some now, but at the time, he was a young athletic swingman on the Lakers looking to make his mark on the league. In the next five years, he would win back-to-back NBA championships and be named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year. Now the five years after those championships, we won’t discuss. He does have great calves though.\n\n24.\n\nIt still boggles my mind that Vince, Ari and Billy didn’t get a ride on Sydney Pollack’s private jet to Cannes. What actor/director combo in their right mind(s) would pass up an opportunity to sit with a Hollywood legend for 10 hours and discuss their craft? I know, I get it: brotherhood, friendship, etc. I did like how he chastised Ari at the end. “Rules, Ari. Rules!” Ari Gold hasn’t followed a single rule since he got to Hollywood.\n\n23.Jimmy Kimmel, \"Talk Show\" (Season 1, Episode 3)\n\nA younger Jimmy Kimmel is one of the first cameos that gives the backstory of the crew some depth. He knew Drama coming up together in Hollywood and he owed him a phone call. It was a nice meta touch that had viewers of this very young show asking themselves in Season 1 what was reality and what was entertainment. Who cares, we just knew we were in. And remember, Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.\n\n22.Mary J. Blige, \"Gary's Desk\" (Season 4, Episode 8)\n\nIn an otherwise forgettable episode of Entourage (E needs a desk for his new office!), the Queen of hip-hop soul was a refreshing departure from the normal cameo of random Hollywood actor, athlete or rapper. She brought a touch of class, plus she could tell Jim and Jeff, the identical twin agents apart. Hint: Jeff was the one who slept with Jim’s wife.\n\n21.\n\nYou have to think back on where Entourage was as a show in 2005. It had just found a new life in on-demand cable viewings so viewership halfway through Season 2 was growing. But its biggest celebrity cameos so far were the iconic Bob Saget performance (which I’ll get to) and a literally phoned-in Scarlett Johansson. The movie industry had yet to put it’s official stamp on the show. Until James Cameron flew in with a helicopter.\n\nWord is the Cameron loved the idea of his cameo so much that he asked creator Doug Ellin for an expanded role in Seasons 2 and 3. While he’s not as good as an actor as some other entries in the top 25, his presence definitely made waves.\n\n20.\n\nThis was a “Holy shit” cameo for sure. Easily in the Mount Rushmore of acclaimed actors who have appeared in Entourage, just the idea that Dennis Hopper’s perfect Saturday in Malibu is spent sitting inside betting on soccer brings a smile to every film nerd's face.\n\n19.\n\nIt’s always incredible when rewatching Entourage to spot those faces in the crowd who are on the cusp of their big breakout role (see Dinklage, Peter below). Rainn had just finished shooting Season 1 of an NBC sitcom about a small town paper company when he appeared that summer as jaded internet journalist RJ Spencer who has his sights set on drowning Aquaman. We hope everything worked out for him.\n\n18.\n\nAs Turtle once said to Ari, “All rappers want to act” but not all rappers want to act alongside Meryl Streep. T.I. shows his range to both Ari and those of us watching from our couches in this Season 5 cameo.\n\n17.\n\nBy Season 6 of the show, the Miller-Gold agency is humming. Every episode, another big name walked through the door and chopped it up with Ari in the fishbowl conference room. David Schwimmer got one of the meatier cameos of the season with his “all hands on deck” pitch meeting and his subsequent plot to \"spend time\" with Lizzie. Did Andrew Klein do anything right when it came time to sign a big client?\n\n16.\n\nInviting the boys to a party at her beach house and setting E up with her friend who’s a Perfect 10 model? There’s only one way to describe the vibe that the Emmy winner gives off in one of the best episodes in the early half of the show: road dog. A girl you’d love to sit on the beach and have a beer with. As long as you don’t have to talk about her pet charity.\n\n15.\n\nAnother “blink or you might miss her” cameo from one of Hollywood’s leading ladies. Fisher plays Anna Fowler, the Deadline Hollywood reporter who helps Ari determine that recently fired employee Lizzie Grant does not, in fact, have anything on him. I really wish we could have seen more of her in this role as the press side of the film business was never properly represented on the show. She would have made for a great recurring role in its final two seasons.\n\n14.\n\nAn awesome, awesome departure from Schiff’s work on The West Wing. He, like Vince, wants desperately to be in a Scorsese movie. Somehow, someway, Ari is going to make that happen. Just a refreshingly self-aware and funny cameo from a big time dramatic actor. You can catch him currently on Ballers, where he’s fully leaned into his maniacal/comedic side.\n\n13.\n\nDinklage is barely recognizable without his long hair and massive Thrones beard in this Season 2 cameo. While not a household name when he appeared in \"The Sundance Kids,\" he remains a legend for standing up to Ari’s barside bullying and telling Harvey Weingard to fuck off to his face.\n\nHBO’s known for letting their stars cameo on other HBO shows. You know, keeping it in the family. Little did they know back in 2005 that they were about to have a three-time Emmy winner and the star of the biggest television show of all time on their hands. Confirming that yes, Dinklage is the biggest actor in town, Ari.\n\n12.Hugh Hefner, \"Aquamansion\" (Season 2, Episode 3)\n\nPour one out for this living legend just for the delivery of this line: “Johnny Chase...the monkey boy.”\n\n11.\n\nSo technically, Bono’s on this list twice. But since his Season 6 cameo on a laptop screen is utter trash, I’m treating this incredible cameo as a separate entity. The first time we see Bono is in Season 2’s \"I Love You Too,\" when Ari snags U2 tickets for Johnny Drama’s birthday at the Staples Center.\n\nAs the story goes, the cast of the show didn’t know if they could get the U2 frontman to wish Drama a Happy Birthday from the stage. It was Jeremy Piven who asked the Irish crooner, and for the entire concert the cast waited with bated breath as cameras were trained on them. When he did finally wish Drama a feliz cumpleanos director Doug Ellin yelled, “Kevin, hug Adrian!” and Entourage history was made. (Read more about filming that scene in Complex's oral history of the series here.)\n\n10.\n\n\"Later, B-Squad.\"\n\nIs it truly a cameo if you’re cameoing in your own life’s story? Marky Mark served as the inspiration, executive producer and driving force behind Entourage and I’d be remiss if we didn’t give him an honorable nod in the top 10. His cameos always brought the laughs and some of the lines he delivered over the years are vintage Walhberg:\n\n“Whoa, it’s the wrecking crew”\n\n“No Ripley’s, we believe you.”\n\n“Oh Drama, you sand baggin’ bitch”\n\n9.\n\n\"What language are you talking? What happened? I still don’t know– you’re talking Chinese.\"\n\nMore HBO worlds colliding! Of course Larry David is ticked off about getting uninvited to the Lakers game and replaced with Vin Diesel. I would be too. But, in Ari’s defense, Vin did have the 18-wheeler and the power shades on.\n\nThis was a cameo that was the perfect balance of star power and randomness. Like his off-again, on-again show Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry’s around just long enough in this episode to make you want more. It also brought believability early on in the world of Entourage (this Ari guy’s got some big name clients!) and it gave us another hilarious Johnny Drama scene where he asks somebody for a part in their show.\n\nDon’t ever fuckin’ harass a real client again.\n\n8.\n\n\"Gus was kind enough to send me over the rushes of that picture you were in about the forest fires or whatever.\"\n\nThis was another one of those “Holy shit” moments that I’ll never forget reacting to in real time. For years, Vince had said how he’d love to be in a Scorsese movie (well I guess Drama did too but he wants to be in every director’s movie.) At the end of a season where Vince just couldn’t seem to get it together, Marty parachuting in from whatever rooftop he was standing on might have felt a little too convenient, but that didn’t make it any less awesome.\n\nYou can’t deny the kind of star power Scorsese has, even as somebody who’s never been much of an onscreen presence. And he comes along at the end of a season that was sorely lacking major celebrity wattage. Vince gets invited to be the lead in Scorcese’s Gatsby, all's right within the Entourage universe and we’re treated to another iconic shot of the boys walking down Hollywood Boulevard, back on top again and turning heads as they go.\n\n7.Bob Saget, \"Neighbors;\" \"No More Drama;\" \"Buzzed;\" \"Bottoms Up\" (Seasons 5, 6, 7, Episodes 5, 7, 2, 5)\n\n\"Don’t you fuck my daughters, Vince.\"\n\nI’m breaking my own rule here because in Season 7, Bob does have a short subplot with John Stamos and Drama. However, it’s his cameo as Vince and the boys’ new next door neighbor which lands him squarely in the top 10. From the Full House DVD box set, to the muffins, to the “Anybody an XBOX guy?” it’s all an incredible, character redefining moment for the actor America had grown to love as Danny Tanner.\n\nLater on in the show’s run, he agrees to sign with Eric’s new agency if he can have sex on his boss Murray’s desk, thus further cementing himself into the legacy of all time Entourage cameos.\n\n6.\n\nI mean the man's most positive, positive, -tive is a negative; It's a mega-negative.\n\nJust five episodes into Entourage, we were treated to one of its most iconic cameos by one of Hollywood’s strangest figures. Val Kilmer agreeing to play the part of the dreadlocked sherpa who gets the boys his “all organic, pesticide free” weed during a weed drought is a creative choice that remains one of the more interesting (and baffling) in the show’s run.\n\nVal absolutely chews up the scenery, and the cast is loving every second of it. Johnny Drama’s reaction to Val recognizing him and saying “I’m a fan, man” has got to be one of the more subtle Kevin Dillon performances early on in the show. Although the idea of needing armed security at your weed farm (as well as the concept of a shortage of green due to a drought) doesn’t age particularly well, this cameo certainly does.\n\n5.50 Cent, \"One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car\" (Season 6, Episode 3)\n\n\"I see you’re out in your Daddy’s car.\"\n\nThis is the perfect belly laugh cameo from a celebrity because:\n\nYou wouldn’t expect to see him in that moment\n\nHe would definitely know Turtle in the Entourage universe\n\nHe has the perfect sense of humor about himself\n\n50’s GIFabble moment comes at one of the first times Turtle decides he wants more out of life than freeloading off his best friend and girlfriend. Going for a drive in your new Ferrari and getting heckled by Curtis Jackson III feels so much like that dead-on Entourage combination: hilarious and exceedingly cool.\n\n4.\n\n\"Put him on the fucking phone, John.\"\n\nMatt Damon appearing in the Season 6 finale to do some fundraising wasn’t too far of a departure from the comedic skillset he’d recently showcased in Steven Soderbergh’s The Informant! and Ocean’s 13 (remember the nose?) At this point we’ve seen Damon fake “lose it” on countless viral Jimmy Kimmel clips so this wasn’t as much, “Wow I can’t believe Matt Damon is losing his temper on Entourage!” as it was “Wow I can’t believe Matt Damon is on Entourage plugging his charity!”\n\nTo land an Academy Award winner at arguably one of the many peaks of his career though is an accomplishment worth recognizing. It’s clear that Damon agreed to do a cameo as long as his plot could be centered around his charity One by One, which felt a little shoehorned in. However, there is no denying that Matt is an incredible comedic actor. The “viralness” of these clips, which are over 9 years old, still stand the test of time, and him hating Vince’s acting is quite believable\n\n3.\n\n\"What are you, too mainstream to fight your own fights now Marshall?\"\n\nEminem has, I’m not kidding, four sentences in this episode and it makes for an explosive ending to what’s widely considered one of the more disjointed seasons of the show.\n\nRiding on the success of Recovery, Em capped off his summer by sucker punching the drunk and high Vincent Chase and sending his ass off to rehab, answering Vince’s question about fighting his own fights decidedly. This is another cameo that shows just how high Entourage had climbed. In Season 1, they were begging Hollywood actresses to pretend to know who Vince was. By Season 7, they were getting one of the biggest rappers in the world to throw haymakers at the show’s star in a crowded party scene with hundreds of extras.\n\n2.\n\n\"Why don't you stop staring at the guy like you want to fuck him, Turtle?\"\n\nBy this point in the show, a few small cracks were starting to show. Plotlines had been recycled, new characters were introduced and fell flat (Hello, Andrew Klein) and E and Sloan were in the middle of the second of three “What are we?” phases of their relationship.\n\nAnd then the boys went golfing with Tom Brady and Mark Walhberg. What struck me, as I’m sure it did to many others watching, was that Tom Brady isn’t just the wooden pretty boy with the dazzling smile plastered across his face that we’d come to expect from NFL interviews. Your boy can act. It might not be exceptionally comedic, which would be tough to do sharing scenes with the likes of Walhberg and Kevin Dillon, but Brady really seemed to be in his element. The spell that Turtle finds himself under in his presence reaches past the screen too, and by the end of the golf event, we want to go to the Bradys for dinner and dessert, too. ​​​​​​Gisele cooks? That’s awesome.\n\n1.Kanye West, \"No Cannes Do\" (Season 4, Episode 11)\n\n\"And after all the talk, all I gotta say is...you’re welcome.\"\n\nIn the penultimate episode of Season 4, the boys plus Ari and Billy Walsh can’t get a flight to Cannes due to a terrorist threat at LAX. After turning down a ride on Sydney Pollack’s private jet because there aren’t enough seats (why?), it looks like they’re stuck in LA. Until Kanye West walks in.\n\nThink back, it’s late summer 2007. In just two weeks, Kanye is releasing his highly anticipated third studio album Graduation (also celebrating an anniversary today.) And not only does he save the day and give everyone a lift to France, he debuts a brand new song from the album over the end credits, one that would go on to be among his best singles. (Ed. Note: we see you, Vener.)\n\nKanye was the perfect celebrity guest for Entourage because he embodies the generation who watched the show from start to finish. The cliche that’s been attributed to Entourage over the past eight years it’s been off the air is that “It all works out,” in the end for the boys. And that is 100% the case in this instance. But it all working out is what we want, isn’t it? This is a simple show about friendship, life, and having a good time.\n\nMaybe I’ve spent too much time thinking about Entourage (I definitely have) but at the end of the day, there’s something uncomplicated and joyous in watching people you enjoy watching doing things you’d enjoy doing. Like flying with Kanye West on his private jet to Cannes. Welcome to the good life, indeed."
