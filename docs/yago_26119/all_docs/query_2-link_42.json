        "text": "He’s a fan favorite at The Ridgefield Playhouse – and he’s back for another great night of comedy! Artie Lange returns to The Ridgefield Playhouse on Wednesday, May 11 at 8 p.m. as part of the Clark Construction Comedy Series, after a sold out show last fall. Artie Lange is one of the most sought after live comedians, beginning his career in the comedy clubs of NYC and then debuting on FOX’s “Mad TV.” Artie starred, co-wrote, and produced his own feature film Beer League. Make it a great night out before the show and visit Southwest Cafe (109 Danbury Road, Ridgefield), enjoy a complimentary margarita with your entree when you show your ticket! Media sponsor for this event is i95fm – the home of rock and roll.\n\nIn 1999, Lange joined the cast of Macdonald's sitcom The Norm Show during its second season as Macdonald's half-brother. Following the departure of comedian and writer Jackie Martling from The Howard Stern Show in March 2001, Stern announced a \"Win Jackie's Money\" contest where comedians auditioned for the vacant seat by sitting in during some shows. Artie was one of the participating comedians. When The Norm Show ended in April 2001, Lange returned to New Jersey to sit in for a number of shows on Howard Stern. His success on the show led to his full-time addition in October 2001."
