        "text": "“The cult comedy movie Beer League is back on the field after a 16-year hiatus, and is currently in production as Beer League Two – a new series of shorts produced by 624 Productions LLC (Who’s Jenna…?) in association with Unhinged Entertainment (You’re Up).\n\nThe upcoming series of shorts were written by Jimmy Palumbo and Tom Baldinger, with Palumbo reprising the role of ‘Johnny Trinno,’ as he tries to put the softball team back together after the team’s 16-year suspension is lifted. Beer League Two also features original cast members Anthony DeSando (Kiss Me Guido), Joe Lo Truglio (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), Maddie Corman (Some Kind of Wonderful), Michael Deeg (The Bachelor), Jerry Minor (Community), Elizabeth Regen (Whoopi), Mary Birdsong (Reno 911), Alex Corrado (Gotham), Tom Bolster (Kissing Jessica Stein), Tony Mennuto (Live On Tape), and many other surprise cameos. The shorts are scheduled to be released on March 30th to coincide with Major League Baseball’s opening day.\n\nBeer League (2006) was originally produced by Anthony Mastromauro (The Old Man and The Gun), and written by Artie Lange (Howard Stern Show) and Frank Sebastiano (SNL). The movie was based on the short film Gameday (2001) that was created by Michael Ruane, Artie Lange and Jimmy Palumbo, and which introduced the world to ‘Artie DeVanzo’ and his troubled New Jersey softball team.\n\nYou can visit “Beer League Two” at their official website https://beerleaguetwo.com and follow them on Instagram @beerleaguetwo to get in on the action.\n\n624 Productions is a New Jersey-based award-winning Independent production company founded by Tom Baldinger. 624 Productions produces feature and short films, television pilots and music videos.
