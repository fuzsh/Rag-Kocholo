        "text": "As a lifelong cinephile, I have always consumed a copious amount of films. In this new feature, I keep track of the films I watch during the week.\n\nAll Cats Are Grey (Savina Dellicour, 2014, Belgium)\n\nWitty comedy drama about a young girl who begins to suspect that a local private investigator is her father. Enjoyable and featuring moments of warmth but ultimately lacking in ambition.\n\nArtie Lange’s Beer League (Frank Sebastiano, 2006, USA)\n\nChildish and even a bit tasteless. You may not find it in any “best of” lists any time soon, yet there is something about it that recalls old slapstick comedies and makes it a wild and fun watch.\n\nThe Jump (Giedre Zickyte, 2020, Lithuania/Latvia/France)\n\nAn inspiring tale from not too long ago of when the United States protested for the immigration of a Soviet man. Aside from the interesting story it tells, it is cinematically constructed in a gripping and exciting way.\n\nStardust (Gabriel Range, 2020, UK)\n\nInspired by the lack of David Bowie, this independent film lacks any noteworthy independent spirit. Typical, standards, coming-of-age drama. Hardly worth the time of any of the iconic music star’s fans.\n\nMy Name Is Francesco Totti (Alex Infascelli, 2020, Italy)\n\nFirst-person insight into the life and career of one of the most acclaimed football players in Italian history and a symbol for the city of Rome at large. At times, it feels almost Macchiavellian.\n\nTigers (Ronnie Sandahl, 2020, Sweden/Italy/Denmark)\n\nBased on the true story of a promising football star, Tigers provides insight on mental illness among football youth league players. However, its penchant for traditionalist melodrama counters a promise for realist bite.\n\nCuban Dancer (Roberto Salinas, 2020, Italy/Canada/Chile)\n\nComing-of-age documentary telling the tale of a promising young Cuban ballet dancer emigrating to the U.S. with his family. Lacks a truly eventful, pivotal moment but is saved by its noteworthy human warmth."
