        "text": "The notion of gruff comedian Artie Lange playing Carnegie Hall is as incongruous as Britney Spears being named Mother of the Year. But Lange, Howard Stern‘s notoriously hard-partying sidekick, not only did just that as part of last year’s New York Comedy Festival, but sold out the historic venue in less than three hours.\n\nSo Lange is returning to this year’s fest – which also features Rosie O’Donnell, Sarah Silverman and Bill Maher – for not one, but two performances. He’s playing Friday night at Town Hall and next Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall.\n\nLange, who just signed a deal for a memoir titled “Too Fat To Fish,” had a great year on television as well, with recurring roles on “Rescue Me” and “Entourage.” But today, a week after his 40th birthday, he’s recovering from a late-night stand-up gig, waking just in time for his late-afternoon interview with The Post.\n\n“I thought all my troubles were over at the age of 27, but I hadn’t even begun to deal with the demons yet,” he says. “So I don’t party as much as I used to. If I did, I’d be dead. “\n\nWhy do you and the “stern show” make such a good fit?\n\nSo many guys wanted this job, but there was no one who was a bigger fan of that show. I started listening when I was 13, and got on full-time when I was 32, so I knew it. In some ways, Howard raised me and taught me comedy. So by the time I got to the show, it’s like I knew the guy.\n\nHow has the show changed your life?\n\nBefore Stern, I was somewhat of a celebrity, but the Stern show turns you into a rock star. I would walk down the street and people would go, “Hey, you’re the guy from that thing.” It went from that, to, “ARTIE! We heard you had a big weekend! You got drunk!” It went from people kinda knowing who I am to everyone in N.Y.C. being one of my best friends.\n\nWhat’s it like onstage at Carnegie Hall?\n\nIt was electric, easily the biggest moment of my career. I was on the rocks with my [former] girlfriend. It was her birthday, so I brought her out and got all of Carnegie Hall to sing “Happy Birthday” to her. Then I said, “Look, you’re gonna meet guys way better looking than me, probably way richer, a lot thinner. But who’s gonna get that to happen?”\n\nWere you happy with how your movie “Beer League” turned out?\n\nCreatively, it’s the thing I’m most proud of in my life. I wrote it with my friend Frank Sebastiano, who has two Emmy Awards for “SNL” and “The Chris Rock Show.” The movie is as funny as we thought it could be. We love it. I look at it and go, “I don’t know how we pulled that off.” I love it.\n\nComics like to joke about you dying young. How hard did you party?\n\nLet me put it this way – I turned 40 last week, and a lot of people lost money. I met people in the world of after-hour clubs in New York City where they took credit cards for cocaine. I’ll never forget watching a guy take credit cards for coke and going, “OK, I’m in the devil’s den now.”\n\nIs it true you gained 100 pounds in the past year?\n\nThe “Beer League” shoot was crazy, because I did the radio show in the morning and shot the movie at night. So I got all stressed out and became addicted to heroin. I knew I had to [go through] withdrawal before the shoot, so I went through withdrawal. The minute “Beer League” got done, I started eating. I substituted food for heroin.\n\nPICKING HIS BRAIN\n\n“There are very few things I’m proud to tell my mother about.”\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nHe comes to see me [in rehab] and goes, “Man, you a funny cat.” He’s one of those guys who’s cool enough to say “cat” and you don’t wanna strangle him.\n\nBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\n\nThey had a special rehearsal show at the Meadowlands three weeks ago. Bruce does these rehearsal shows where he lets 2,000 people come in and he works out the kinks with the band. It’s great.\n\nSports Book at the Mirage, Las Vegas\n\nA great place. Every single game from every single sport in the country is on the board, and some are playing on TV. You go to the window, make a bet, drink, eat and watch.\n\nThe “Rehab” Pool Party at the Las Vegas Hard Rock\n\nOn Sundays they let strippers drink for free. So you have 1,000 strippers and, like, 200 guys drinking and gambling. I’ve never seen anything like it.\n\nArtieLangeDeathWatch.com\n\nI hate it. I see why it’s funny, but it cost me health insurance. I applied for insurance a few years ago, and the guy Googled my name, went to that site and denied me in about three seconds.\n\nJoe Torre and the Yanks\n\nIt’s awful. Everybody loves Joe Torre except for the two idiots George Steinbrenner gave life to."
