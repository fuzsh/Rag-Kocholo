        "text": "I can deny it no longer!! Well I've never denied how much I adore this film but this is my favourite comedy of all time! I always thought it was between Dumb And Dumber and There's Something About Mary but no, it is this.\n\nOn paper it is everything I should despise but I can't help but adore these loveable losers! It takes a min to get going but once it gets to the prison scene from then on I am just cackling my head off. Ralph Macchio is the straight guy who plays it to a tee and the only one really showing any real acting chops. Elizabeth Regan is hilarious as the brassy Artie hating fiancee of his.…\n\n\"The only guys who get laid less than funny fat guys and serious fat guys. I feel sorry for those assholes.\" - Artie\n\nArtie is an unemployed, out of shape, slacker who loves the game of baseball. He's on a softball team in the local bar league called Ed's Bar & Swill. During the first game of the season his team gets into a fight with their rivals and both teams are arrested. The compromise upon release is the team that outperforms the other during the season gets to stay and the loser must join another league. Thus begins Ed's Bar & Swill softball team's quest to get better at the game and earn their place.\n\nTwo things I love are beer…\n\n“DeVanzo, you shithead! Watching you hit into that double play makes me wish I was 35 years younger.”\n\n“I know, so you could kick my ass.”\n\n“No, because I could kick your ass right now. But 35 years ago, I could have loaned your parents the money for an abortion.”\n\nBeer League is a raunchy comedy about a middle-aged, alcoholic degenerate named Artie who lives for drunkenly playing league softball with his bros. When they’re threatened with being kicked out of the league, they must pull themselves together and do the unthinkable—win.\n\nThere’s not much plot to the movie, and that’s ok, all the fun and laughs come from seeing what fucked up stuff these middle-aged drunkards get themselves into.…"
