        "text": "1925-42\n\nBorn Milton Ernest Rauschenberg on October 22, 1925, in Port Arthur, Texas, an oil refinery town on the Gulf of Mexico, near the Louisiana border. The only son of Dora Carolina Matson and Ernest Rauschenberg, an employee of Gulf States Utilities, a local light and power company. As a child, creates an elaborately decorated environment in his room, drawing images on the walls, painting red fleurs-de-lis all over the woodwork and furniture, and building a structure of crates filled with jars and boxes of found objects to divide the room that he shares with his only sibling, Janet, born in 1936. Learns to fish at an early age. Develops a love for animals and has many pets, including ducks, rabbits, frogs, and a goat. Raised by a deeply religious mother, Rauschenberg aspires to become a preacher at age thirteen but decides against it when he realizes the fundamentalist Church of Christ to which his family belongs forbids dancing, one of his passions. Attends public schools in Port Arthur and graduates from Thomas Jefferson High School, where he is active in the school theater as a costume and set designer.\n\nRauschenberg boating with his parents Ernest and Dora Rauschenberg on the bayou near Port Arthur, Texas, fall ca. 1927\n\n1943-49\n\n1943\n\nFall: Enters The University of Texas at Austin to study pharmacology, at parents’ recommendation; drops out due to the difficulty of the coursework (not recognizing at this point that he is dyslexic) and to his refusal to dissect a frog in biology class.\n\nRauschenberg, his sister Janet, and a friend from the Navy, San Diego Naval Repair Base, ca. 1944\n\n1944\n\nWinter: Works briefly at a soda fountain in a drugstore in Austin.\n\nFebruary: Drafted into the U.S. Navy. Enters boot camp at Farragut, Idaho, where he draws portraits for fellow GIs to send home.\n\nApril: After proclaiming to the Navy that he does not want to kill anyone, is transferred to Hospital Corps School for nursing instruction and works in various Naval hospitals in California.\n\n1945–1946\n\nFall 1945–Winter 1946: Trains as a neuropsychiatric technician in the Navy Hospital Corps, while stationed at Camp Pendleton, San Diego. Experiences with traumatized sailors strengthen his antiwar convictions. During this time, he visits the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino—his first visit to an art museum—where he discovers original oil paintings, including Thomas Gainsborough’s The Blue Boy (1770) and Thomas Lawrence’s Sarah Barrett Moulton: Pinkie (1794), previously seen only as reproductions in books and on playing cards. Even though he has enjoyed drawing all his life, Rauschenberg now realizes for the first time that he can become an artist. Buys art supplies and begins painting.\n\nReceives an honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy. Hitchhikes from San Francisco to Port Arthur, Texas.\n\nSettles in Los Angeles and works briefly as an illustrator for a Westwood newspaper and later as a packing clerk at a bathing suit factory where he meets Pat Pearman, an assistant designer, who convinces him that he has talent after seeing his drawings.\n\n1947\n\nLate January: Follows Pat Pearman to Kansas City, Missouri. Upon arrival in Kansas City, changes his name from Milton to Bob (subsequently Robert) after considering the most common names he could think of while sitting all night in a Savarin coffee shop.\n\nFebruary–December: At Pearman’s suggestion, enrolls in the Kansas City Art Institute on the GI Bill. With fellow students, paints backdrop used at Kansas City Municipal Auditorium for an appearance by President Truman. While attending classes at night, works at many odd jobs, including preparing window displays, making models for an industrial designer, and fabricating movie sets and photographers’ props. Saves money to study art in Paris.\n\nRauschenberg (standing at rear of table) with fellow students, Fashion Design studio, Kansas City Art Institute, Missouri, 1947\n\n1948\n\nApril: Rauschenberg's father is promoted to line foreman at Gulf States Utilities and relocates to Lafayette, Louisiana. His wife and daughter will join him by the fall.\n\nJune 2: After a brief stay in New York, departs for Paris on the SS Marine Falcon. On the GI Bill, enrolls in the Académie Julian.\n\nSummer: Meets Susan Weil, who also attends the Académie Julian and lives in the same rooming house on Rue Stanislas. Dissatisfied with the instruction and the apathy of his fellow students, Rauschenberg spends most of his time with Weil, visiting galleries where he first views works by such European modernists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Inspired, he paints passionately, often dispensing with brushes and using his hands.\n\nSeptember 23–October 3: Departing from Le Havre, France returns to the United States aboard the SS Marine Tiger. After arriving in New York, visits his family in Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\nOctober–December: With Weil, enrolls in Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina, after reading an article in the August issue of Time magazine on the disciplined approach to art of Josef Albers, formerly an instructor at the Bauhaus in Germany; a professor at Black Mountain College since 1933, Albers becomes rector in 1948. Although they are often at odds, Rauschenberg will later regard Albers as his most important teacher. Rauschenberg studies the basic methods of Werklehre (“practical instruction”), Albers’s method that he developed at the Bauhaus of working with the inherent properties of materials and developing “combination” techniques of “structure, texture, and facture.” Creates This Is the First Half of a Print Designed to Exist in Passing Time (1948); one of the few works, along with two photographs, still extant from this period. It is a woodcut for which the block of wood is progressively cut with lines, the image emerging from black to white over fourteen stages.\n\nSusan Weil and Rauschenberg, Paris, 1948\n\n1949\n\nJanuary: At Albers’s request, Rauschenberg and Weil deliver Albers’s artworks to New York for his Egan Gallery exhibition that opens on January 24.\n\nLate spring: Completes first academic year at Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nSummer: Passes summer at Weil’s family home on Outer Island, Connecticut, where Weil introduces Rauschenberg to the method of exposing blueprint paper.\n\nLate summer–fall: Moves to New York, renting a room on East Eighty-seventh Street near the Weil family’s apartment. Enrolls in the Art Students League, New York, again on the GI Bill, where he studies under Vaclav Vytlacil and Morris Kantor. Rauschenberg receives very little positive feedback for his work, which differs markedly from that of his fellow students such as Knox Martin and Julius Hatofsky, but the league’s education is less important to Rauschenberg than its offering of studio space and a milieu for artists. Creates a work, no longer extant, by collecting imprints of students’ feet as they walk through a doorway of the school. The action is later recounted by poet Robert Creeley in the exhibition catalogue Poets of the Cities: New York and San Francisco 1950–1965 (1974). Moves to a studio in a building on Willett Street, near the Williamsburg Bridge in downtown Manhattan, which he shares with a group of fellow students. Rauschenberg and Weil frequent the vanguard galleries of Charles Egan, Samuel Kootz, and Betty Parsons, viewing the first generation of American postwar art and admiring in particular the freedom of expression of the Abstract Expressionists.\n\nOctober: Paints a scene for the baptistery of the newly constructed Church of Christ building in Lafayette.\n\n1950-59\n\n1950\n\nJanuary–March: Continues to attend classes at the Art Students League, New York.\n\nJune 21: Marries Weil and, after honeymooning in Bermuda, spends summer at the Weils’ home on Outer Island, Connecticut.\n\nFall: Rauschenberg and Weil rent an apartment at 6 West Ninety-fifth Street, New York, which also serves as their studio. Painter Jack Tworkov visits apartment.\n\nBetween October 16–November 4: Visits Franz Kline’s first solo exhibition, Egan Gallery, New York.\n\nLate fall: Approaches gallery owner Betty Parsons for a critique of his work. Parsons, who represents major artists such as Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Clyfford Still, unexpectedly offers Rauschenberg a show in spring 1951. Accompanied by Still, Parsons visits Rauschenberg’s apartment/studio space to select works for the exhibition.\n\nSusan Weil and Rauschenberg on their wedding day with members of their wedding party, Outer Island, Connecticut, June 1950\n\n1951\n\nGene Moore, chief window designer for Bonwit Teller and later Tiffany & Co., includes blueprints by Rauschenberg and Weil in one of his window displays at Bonwit Teller, New York. These blueprints are no longer extant and were likely discarded when the windows were deinstalled. Work for Moore will provide critical economic support for several years.\n\nFebruary–May: Continues to attend Art Students League, New York. Meets fellow student Cy Twombly.\n\nApril 9: “Speaking of Pictures,” a three-page article in Life magazine, features Rauschenberg and Weil making blueprints, which are no longer extant.\n\nMay 2–July 4: Rauschenberg’s and Weil’s Blueprint: Photogram for Mural Decoration (now entitled Female Figure, ca. 1950) is exhibited in Abstraction in Photography, organized by Edward Steichen, Director of the Department of Photography, Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nMay 14–June 2: First solo exhibition, Betty Parsons Gallery, New York. To Parsons’s surprise, Rauschenberg has attempted to improve some of the works originally selected for the show by repainting them. The exhibition is held in the smaller gallery; the original checklist includes thirteen artworks, and perhaps as many as seven others circulated through the gallery during the two weeks of the exhibition. The larger, main room exhibits works by Walter Tandy Murch, an artist known for his realistic depictions of mechanical objects and illustrations for such magazines as Forbes and Scientific American. None of Rauschenberg’s paintings are sold. Jack Tworkov brings art dealer Charles Egan to the exhibition. Rauschenberg meets gallerist Leo Castelli and composer John Cage for the first time. Discusses Black Mountain College with Cage, who taught there in summer 1948 (prior to Rauschenberg’s arrival), and gives Cage Number 1 (1951), a painting that is no longer extant; Rauschenberg recycles the canvas in 1953 and makes Untitled [small black painting]. The friendship between Rauschenberg and Cage will solidify the following summer, which they will both spend at Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nMay 24–June 10: Upon invitation by Castelli and Tworkov, participates in Today’s Self-Styled School of New York, the first Artists’ Annual exhibition at the Ninth Street Gallery, New York, also known as the Ninth Street Show. Exhibits 22 The Lily White (ca. 1950), which he removes from the Parsons Gallery exhibition, and an unidentified painting. The exhibition, which is conceived by members of the Club—a loosely organized group of intellectuals, artists, dealers, writers, and musicians—presents vanguard works by sixty-one artists who have been overlooked by museums and marks the first time that the group exhibits together, consolidating a movement that comes to be known as the New York School.\n\nJuly 16: Birth of son, Christopher, in New York. Aaron Siskind takes baby pictures.\n\nSummer–fall: Returns to Black Mountain College, where Weil and Christopher join him briefly until Rauschenberg and Weil decide to separate. Poet Charles Olson has assumed leadership of Black Mountain College following Albers’s departure in 1949. Fellow students include Dorothea Rockburne and Twombly. Faculty members include Hazel Larsen Archer, with whom Rauschenberg first studies photography. Also in residence during the summer session are photographers Harry Callahan and Siskind, and painters Ben Shahn and Robert Motherwell. Rauschenberg conceives a project in which he will photograph the United States “inch by inch.” Begins several groups of paintings, most of which he will complete by summer 1952. The Night Blooming series (1951) consists of approximately eighteen large, predominantly black canvases, often impressing gravel or dirt into the pigment. Siskind takes some of these works to an exhibition at Seven Stairs Gallery, Chicago; the exhibition, however, is never held, and all but three works are now believed to be lost. The White Painting series (1951) consists of modular canvases painted entirely in white, and which reflect changes in light and the chance effect of shadows in the surrounding space. In a letter to Parsons, trying to convince her to exhibit the White Paintings, he writes that he “will forfeit all right to ever show again for their being given a chance to be considered for this year’s calendar.” Due to the premium Rauschenberg puts on keeping the white canvases pristine, over the years he directed assistants and friends to repaint and sometimes entirely remake them. Several of the original white paintings will be reused in the making of later works, including many of the Combines. Also begins extended period on a body of work known as the black paintings (1951–53); these works were not conceived as a series by the artist, but have come to be thought of as one. An artistic concern until the spring of 1953, the black paintings were created using matte or glossy paint, sometimes in multiple panels with newspaper frequently as the ground—a characteristic sometimes revealed, but occasionally only apparent by the activated picture surfaces.\n\nFall: Illustrates Joel Oppenheimer’s “The Dancer,” a poem commemorating a performance by Black Mountain College dance instructor Katherine Litz (whose students include Viola Farber, a future Rauschenberg collaborator), published in an edition of 150. For the photo-offset reproduction, Rauschenberg creates abstract drawings of arrows that simulate the dance-like energy of movement.\n\nLate fall: Returns to New York, occasionally works as a freelance window designer. Between November 26 and December 15, views Jackson Pollock exhibition, Betty Parsons Gallery.\n\nRauschenberg making a blueprint with a Life magazine model, West Ninety-fifth Street apartment, New York, spring 1951.

Courtesy Fondazione Nicola Del Roscio\n\n1952\n\nJanuary: For the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Edward Steichen acquires two photographs made by Rauschenberg at Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina: Untitled (Interior of an Old Carriage) (1949) and Untitled (Cy on Bench) (1951); these works are the first acquired by a museum.\n\nSpring–summer: Continues at Black Mountain College, studying with visiting faculty Jack Tworkov and Franz Kline. Also studies with John Cage and Merce Cunningham, collaborators since 1942, who allow movement and music to coexist without any predetermined relationship except for that of time. Rauschenberg’s friendship with Cage and Cunningham solidifies over the course of the summer, and their collaborations will manifest and develop for the remainder of their lives.\n\nSpring break: Travels with Cy Twombly to Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans; Key West; and Cuba. While in Cuba, Rauschenberg experiments with transfer drawing, rubbing the back of a printed image to transfer images to another sheet of paper, a technique he will fully develop in 1958.\n\nSummer: Participates in an untitled event (later referred to as Theater Piece No. 1, now considered the first Happening) organized by Cage, in the dining hall of Black Mountain College. Varying accounts of the unscripted event describe activities occurring simultaneously: Cunningham improvises a dance around and through the audience, Cage delivers a lecture, M. C. Richards recites poetry from a ladder, David Tudor plays piano, and Rauschenberg plays old records by Edith Piaf and others on a hand-wound, Edison, horn record player. Charles Olson also participates, most likely reading his own poetry. Slides and a flickering eight-millimeter film, possibly by Nick (Nicola) Cernovich, may have been projected onto the walls and ceiling. Panels of Rauschenberg’s White Paintings are hung from the rafters overhead. Other participants include R. Buckminster Fuller and Dorothea Rockburne.\n\nAugust: Cage creates his silent piece 4'33\", a work in three movements in which Tudor, seated quietly at a piano, signals the beginning and end of each movement by opening and closing the keyboard cover. Cage acknowledges that Rauschenberg’s White Paintings, as well as a visit to Harvard University’s anechoic chamber—a soundproof and reverberation-free environment—inspired the work.\n\nAugust 10: The exhibition Paintings by Robert Rauschenberg opens at Black Mountain College.\n\nAugust 20: Sets sail for Naples, Italy aboard the SS Argentina, scheduled to arrive on September 1, stopping in the Sicilian port of Palermo on the way. Travels with Twombly, who has won a travel fellowship from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond. Rauschenberg had photographed Twombly’s paintings for the application portfolio.\n\nSeptember: Rauschenberg and Twombly settle in Rome, near Piazza di Spagna.\n\nSeptember 1952–February 1953: Takes numerous photographs and accumulates a collection of objects from which he creates three significant groups of work: (1) A series of collages, referred to as North African Collages (1952), fabricated on cardboard from laundered shirts using local printed papers and old engravings found in bookstalls and flea markets. (2) Feticci Personali, hanging “fetish” assemblages of wood, rope, animal fur, and various small objects, which may be inspired by ritual artifacts used by North African tribes that he sees during his travels. These works are Rauschenberg’s first to involve suspension; although none are known to be extant, several are documented in photographs by the artist in Rome (ca. 1953) and in the Fulton Street studio (ca. 1954). (3) Scatole Personali (1952–53), wood or metal boxes containing found objects and materials such as pebbles, sticks, dirt, engravings, and beads. These three groups reveal the influence of Joseph Cornell with whom Rauschenberg was familiar through exhibitions at Egan Gallery, New York (for example, a December 1949 exhibition from which Susan Weil’s parents bought three of Cornell’s works) and having visited Cornell’s home on Utopia Parkway, Queens, New York, to transport works to the Egan Gallery.\n\nOctober: Rauschenberg and Weil’s divorce is finalized.\n\nLate October: Out of money, the artist travels to North Africa and gets a job with the Atlas Construction Company in Casablanca. Twombly joins him later in the year, and the two travel through Morocco to Tangier, where they meet writer Paul Bowles, a friend of Cage, with whom they travel to Tétouan in northern Morocco.\n\nRobert Rauschenberg, Bob + Cy, Venice, 1952\n\nRauschenberg working on Feticci Personali series (1952–53), Rome, 1953. Photo: Attributed to Cy Twombly\n\n1953\n\nJanuary 11–February 7: Participates in 2nd Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, successor to the Ninth Street Show of 1951, Stable Gallery, New York. One of Rauschenberg’s black paintings, submitted by Jack Tworkov, who had been storing it, is exhibited.\n\nFebruary: Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly return to Rome from Africa by way of Spain.\n\nMarch: In Rome, visits artist Alberto Burri, who is ill, and offers him a healing fetish, a small box construction, as a get-well gift. Burri gives a small work to Rauschenberg in return, Senza Titulo (1952), made of paint and fabric collage on Masonite.\n\nMarch 3–10: First solo exhibition in Europe, Scatole e Feticci Personali, Galleria dell’Obelisco, Rome, a gallery that exhibits works by such contemporary Italian artists as Afro and Burri. To both Rauschenberg’s and the gallery owner’s amazement, some of the boxes and hanging wall pieces are sold, and Rauschenberg earns enough money to travel back to New York. In a statement for the exhibition, Rauschenberg writes, “Many of the boxes are a third- dimensional poem of one work: White.” The show travels as Scatole e Costruzioni Contemplative di Bob Rauschenberg to Galleria d’Arte Contemporanea, Florence, where Twombly’s exhibition Mostra de Arazzi di Cy Twombly opens on the same day.\n\nApril: Returns to New York on the SS Andrea Doria and moves into a loft at 61 Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan. Rauschenberg is one of the first New York artists to establish a studio loft in a formerly industrial building. Cage, Cunningham, Morton Feldman, and Philip Guston live in a nearby loft building. Photographs document that Twombly occasionally worked in Rauschenberg’s studio.\n\nBetween April 15 and May 9: Visits Dada 1916–1923, Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, curated by Marcel Duchamp, who also designs the poster.\n\nSpring–summer: Completes the last of the black paintings, begun at Black Mountain College in 1951, and begins the Elemental Sculpture series (1953/1959), made of wood, stones, twine, steel spikes, and other materials found in the Fulton Street neighborhood. Also at the Fulton Street studio, Rauschenberg makes the first of the Gold Painting series (1953–ca. 1960), in which he applies gold leaf to a ground of newsprint, paper, on wooden supports. These are small works with highly tactile surfaces. Rauschenberg will return to the Gold Painting series later in the decade. The earliest Gold Paintings were created as part of the series of elemental paintings (ca. 1953), a term later coined to refer to artist’s work made with unconventional art materials including dirt, grass, gold, lead, clay, mold, and tissue paper, and often contained in wooden frames. Cage brings Feldman to Rauschenberg’s studio, where he buys a black painting for the amount of money in his pocket: $16 and some change. Continues to freelance window design for Gene Moore at Bonwit Teller, New York as a means of support.\n\nSummer: Merce Cunningham Dance Company is formed during summer residency at Black Mountain College. The original dancers of the small company are Carolyn Brown, Remy Charlip, Judith Dunn, Viola Farber, Jo Anne Melsher, Marianne Preger, and Paul Taylor. Cage is musical director.\n\nEleanor Ward, owner of Stable Gallery, New York, is brought to Rauschenberg’s Fulton Street studio by painter Nicolas Carone. Ward offers Rauschenberg and Twombly a joint exhibition. Rauschenberg and Twombly clean out the basement of the gallery, a former horse stable, to exhibit their works there, as well as in the first-floor galleries. Rauschenberg will go on to work as a handyman and janitor for the gallery.\n\nSeptember 15–October 3: Concurrent exhibition of works by Rauschenberg and Twombly, Stable Gallery, New York. Rauschenberg exhibits two White Paintings and a selection of black paintings, as well as Elemental Sculptures. Cage writes a statement on the White Paintings for the exhibition: To whom/No subject/No image/No taste/No object/No beauty/No message/No talent/No technique (no why)/No idea/No intention/No art/No object/No feeling/No black/No white (no and)/After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in these paintings that could not be changed, that they can be seen in any light and are not destroyed by the action of shadows./Hallelujah! the blind can see again; the water’s fine. The show elicits six, mostly negative, reviews in the New York press and in art journals. None of the works are sold until the final day of the exhibition, when friends Carolyn and Earle Brown, a dancer and composer respectively, purchase a black painting for a total sum of $26.30—the amount of money in their pockets from cashing a telephone-deposit refund check.\n\nFall: Creates Automobile Tire Print and Erased de Kooning Drawing (both 1953). The first work is made with the collaboration of Cage and his Model A Ford on a quiet Sunday morning outside the Fulton Street studio. Cage slowly drives the car while Rauschenberg applies black house paint to the rear tire that also rolls down a long strip of paper, approximately twenty-two feet in length, which Rauschenberg has made by gluing together twenty sheets of paper. The work can be partially displayed like a rolled Japanese scroll. To create Erased de Kooning Drawing, Rauschenberg asks Willem de Kooning for a drawing to be erased and presented as Rauschenberg’s own work; de Kooning offers him a drawing made from pencil, crayon, and possibly ink, which will present a serious challenge. Spends almost a month erasing the work on which traces of de Kooning’s original marks still remain. Erased de Kooning Drawing will be exhibited for the first time in a group exhibition at Poindexter Gallery, New York (December 19, 1955–January 7, 1956), and then not again until 1964 at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nLate fall: Begins Red Paintings (1953–54) that he will continue to work on until early summer 1954. Rauschenberg welcomes the challenge to explore what he regards to be “the most difficult color” with which to work. Like the black paintings completed at Fulton Street, the early Red Paintings are painted on canvases that incorporate newspapers and patterned fabrics as grounds. Heavily painted pigments are applied to the canvas in a variety of ways, including brushstrokes, drips, impasto, and color squeezed directly from the tube. As he continues to develop the series the following summer, Rauschenberg will begin to incorporate found objects, anticipating the three-dimensionality of the Combine series to follow.\n\nLate fall: Introduced to Jasper Johns by Suzi Gablik (a painter friend from Black Mountain College and later an art critic) on a New York street corner near Marboro Books, an art bookstore where Johns works.\n\nRauschenberg (left) and Cy Twombly (seated) returning from Italy to New York City aboard SS Andrea Doria with fellow passenger Kurt Osinsky (right), April 1953.

Photo: Allan Grant/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images\n\n1954\n\nWinter: Meets Jasper Johns again at Sari Dienes’s New York studio, where informal salons for young artists frequently take place. Johns begins to work with Rauschenberg on window displays; in the summer, Johns will quit his job at Marboro Books and support himself with display work.\n\nJanuary 27–February 20: Participates in the 3rd Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, Stable Gallery, New York. Exhibits Growing Painting (1953). The work had been created when seeds that Rauschenberg fed to birds accidentally fell into a dirt painting. Rauschenberg watered it until it became a grass painting. During the exhibition, Rauschenberg visits the gallery every day to water the work, but ultimately the grass, and thus the painting, dies.\n\nWhile tending to Growing Painting meets dancer/choreographer Paul Taylor, who has recently left Merce Cunningham Dance Company to form his own company. Rauschenberg will begin work as set and costume designer with Paul Taylor Dance Company later this year. Taylor will assist Rauschenberg and Johns on window displays and rescue Pink Clay Painting (To Pete) (1953), one of Rauschenberg’s clay paintings (the only extant example), from the garbage.\n\nMay 30: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Jack and the Beanstalk, Henry Street Playhouse, New York, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes and set. It includes an illuminated golden egg and a beanstalk suspended by gas-filled balloons.\n\nMid-summer: Works again on Red Painting series. Begins to reveal more of the newspaper surfaces and incorporate found objects, art reproductions, and constructed appendages, resulting in works such as Untitled, Collection, and ultimately Charlene, which although still predominantly red in color, are considered to be the first Combines. Coins the term “combine” to refer to a body of work that he will continue to expand upon through 1964, some of which are freestanding, while others hang on the wall—conflating aspects of both painting and sculpture.\n\n[Fall]: Makes Untitled (ca. 1954), a Combine that includes a stuffed Plymouth Rock hen, a “black painting,” and several autobiographical references, including photographs and drawings by Twombly and Tworkov, as well as a pair of white shoes. Rauschenberg later describes this work as the “first real Combine.”\n\nNovember: Tworkov brings Egan to the Fulton Street studio to view Red Paintings and Combines.\n\nDecember 8: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Minutiae, Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, for which Rauschenberg designed the set. Instructed by Cunningham to make a self-contained set through which dancers can move, Rauschenberg creates the Combine Minutiae by applying paint and various collage elements to fabric on a wooden structure.\n\nDecember 13, 1954–January 22, 1955: Exhibition of Red Paintings and Combines, entitled Joyeux Noël by Rauschenberg, Egan Gallery, New York. Among the works exhibited are Collection, Yoicks, and two Untitled works [54.014 and 54.016] (all 1954). One visitor, John Blair Lynn Goodwin, half brother of sculptor David Hare, buys two works for $50 total. Mainly negative reception appears in the press except for a review by poet and critic Frank O’Hara in Artnews, perhaps the first enthusiastic review of Rauschenberg’s career to date.\n\nDecember 20, 1954–January 20, 1955: Shows Paint Cans (1954), a small Combine, in a group exhibition at Tanager Gallery, New York. Exhibition also includes Johns’s Construction with Toy Piano (1954) and a work by Rachel Rosenthal.\n\nRauschenberg with his untitled Combine (ca. 1954), in the exhibition U.S. Paintings: Some Recent Directions, Stable Gallery, New York, late fall 1955.

Photo: Louis Stevenson\n\n1955\n\nContinues to work on Combines: Bed (1955) is composed of a quilt, taken at Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina, from artist Dorothea Rockburne, that he stretches over a board and paints (at the time, he does not have enough money to buy canvas). Rauschenberg also applies red fingernail polish and striped toothpaste to the work. Odalisk (1955/1958), in which female imagery is prevalent, is a counterpart to the earlier Untitled (ca. 1954). Elements include a miniature blueprint of the full-size blueprint Female Figure (ca. 1950), as well as photographs of pinup girls and a reproduction of a figure in Titian’s Pastoral Concert (ca. 1510–11). Rather than the Plymouth Rock hen of Untitled (ca. 1954), a stuffed Plymouth Rock rooster sits atop the work. Rauschenberg will return to Odalisk in 1958 to adjust the electric-light elements. Monogram (1955–59) will evolve through three states, documented in drawings and photographs, before its completion in 1959. The work originates with a stuffed Angora goat that Rauschenberg purchases from a used furniture store. In its first state (1955–56), the goat stands on a shelf attached to a Combine painting that is later reworked and entitled Rhyme (1956).\n\nJanuary 1: Rauschenberg arranges a concert by composer Morton Feldman, a member of Cage’s circle, during the run of his exhibition at the Egan Gallery, New York. The event—Feldman’s first public performance of his own compositions—will later become known as the “Morton Feldman Concert with Paintings.”\n\nMarch 15: Premiere of Paul Taylor’s solo dance performance Circus Polka (the work will be enlarged into Little Circus, which will premiere on June 6), Master Institute Theater, New York, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes and set. The costumes include a necklace of cow bones for the ringmaster and a two-man horse outfit.\n\nApril 26–May 21: For the 4th Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture at Stable Gallery, New York, Rauschenberg enters Short Circuit (1955), a work protesting the absence of the artists for whom he had recommended, and who had never exhibited in the previous annuals (the policy of this annual series is for past participants to suggest new artists). Rauschenberg asked four artists—Jasper Johns, Ray Johnson, Stan VanDerBeek, and Susan Weil—for works to be added to his larger painting, but only two paintings were ready for inclusion: a small encaustic flag painting by Johns and an oil painting by Weil. Rauschenberg also incorporates an early John Cage concert program and Judy Garland’s autograph into the larger work. Wooden doors marked “do not open” conceal Johns’s and Weil’s works. Johns’s painting will be stolen from the work while on exhibit in 1965, and Rauschenberg will replace it with a facsimile created by Elaine Sturtevant in 1967.\n\nMay 24: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Springweather and People, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Rauschenberg collaborates with Remy Charlip, Ray Johnson, and Vera Williams on the costume designs, which he will redesign in 1957.\n\nSummer: Creates Rebus (1955), a Combine painting, on drop cloths (later remounted on canvas), which incorporates magazine illustrations, comic strips, and political posters to refer to a contemporary urban world dominated by mass media. As Rauschenberg later explains, the work is intended to be “a concentration of that particular week in that particular neighborhood.” It is painted with what he terms a “pedestrian color,” whereby no color stands out or is determined by his own personal taste but rather resembles the blur of colors one encounters on the street. The lighter, more open ground will be common in works from 1956–58.\n\nSeptember: Moves from Fulton Street to top floor studio at 278 Pearl Street, New York, where artist Rachel Rosenthal had lived. Johns’s studio is one floor below in the same building, and Rauschenberg and Johns see each other daily, exchanging ideas and discussing their work.\n\n[Fall]: Continues to support himself by preparing window displays in New York for Bonwit Teller and Tiffany & Co. With Johns as partner, forms Matson Jones–Custom Display; “Matson” is Rauschenberg’s mother’s maiden name and “Jones” stands for Johns.\n\nOctober 15: Meets director and producer Emile de Antonio at an evening of performances by Merce Cunningham and Cage, organized by de Antonio, Clarkstown High School, New City, New York.\n\nNovember 29–December 23: Participates in U.S. Painting: Some Recent Directions, Stable Gallery, New York, organized by Thomas B. Hess, editor of Artnews. Exhibits Untitled (ca. 1954/1958) and – – – – (1950–55). The latter work, originally designated simply with four dashes, is later referred to as Self-Made Retrospective; it is a shallow cabinet inside of which hang miniature versions of Rauschenberg’s 1950–54 paintings: a Red Painting, a white lead painting, a dirt painting, a Gold Painting, a black painting, and a work modeled on paintings exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, New York, in 1951. The work will be dismantled in the late 1950s, and at present two of the original pieces are known to survive; the Parsons-related work, Untitled (1954) was made expressly for Self-Made Retrospective, and it is likely that Untitled [small white lead painting] (ca. 1953) was included as well.\n\nRauschenberg and Jasper Johns in Johns’s Pearl Street studio, New York, ca. 1954. Photo: Rachel Rosenthal\n\nRauschenberg with Jasper Johns, John Cage, and others in Rauschenberg’s or Johns’s Pearl Street studio, New York, ca. 1955 Photo: Jerry Schatzberg\n\n1956\n\nContinues work on Monogram. In its second state, dated as early as 1956 by a photograph of the Combine in the artist’s studio, the goat is encircled by an automobile tire and set on a platform in front of a vertical canvas, a single repainted panel from the dismantled five-panel White Painting (1951).\n\nJanuary 31–February 7: Untitled [red Combine painting] (1954) is shown in one of Gene Moore’s window displays at Bonwit Teller, New York. The painting, which has been altered since the 1954 exhibition of Red Paintings at Egan Gallery, New York, is missing the two left panels as well as the far right panel. Within the year, Rauschenberg will further dismantle the work by cutting it into sections to make several smaller red Combine paintings.\n\nFebruary–November: In New York, Matson Jones–Custom Display creates six window displays: three for Bonwit Teller and three for Tiffany & Co. The displays present a tableaux of a mushroom field, cans pouring paint, caves, a night scene, seventeenth-century still lifes, and a Christmas forest.\n\nMarch 27: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Three Epitaphs, Master Institute Theater, New York, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes. A revised version, Four Epitaphs, will premiere in May, however, the work will assume its original title in 1957.\n\nMay 6: Premieres of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Four Epitaphs (a revised version of Three Epitaphs), The Least Flycatcher, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes and created a score consisting of recorded kitchen sounds, and Untitled Duet, for which Rauschenberg designed costumes that incorporate noise-making elements, Henry Street Playhouse, New York.\n\nMay 18: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Suite for Five in Space and Time, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes and lighting. The dance is one of Cunningham’s first to abandon meter, causing the dancers to rely on their own sense of timing within a designated time length. A revised version with a set and costumes by Rauschenberg will be performed with Nocturnes at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York on January 12, 1957.\n\nJuly 11: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Nocturnes, Jacobs Pillow, Lee, Massachusetts, for which Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes. The set includes a scrim of transparent white netting, partially obscuring some of the dancers. The costumes in the dance are made in white to recall the moonlight, while the headdresses are like “inhabited seashells” in the watercolors of Holbein.\n\nDecember 4: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Tropes, Master Institute Theater, New York, for which Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes.\n\nSecond state of Rauschenberg's Monogram (1955-59; second state 1956-58) in his Pearl Street Studio, New York, ca. 1958. Photo: Rudy Burckhardt\n\n1957\n\nJanuary–October: Matson Jones–Custom Display designs three window displays for Tiffany & Co., New York, that present separate tableaux of desert landscapes, cobwebs, and falling leaves.\n\nJanuary 12: Performance of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Nocturnes (1956), Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York. When the original set is deemed unsafe by fire inspectors, Rauschenberg quickly improvises a new set design, reminiscent of his sculpture Greenhouse (ca. 1950), consisting of wire screening interwoven with green branches from nearby Prospect Park.\n\nFebruary 7: Premiere of John Cage’s Winter Music, Hobart and William Smith College, Geneva, New York. Composed for one to twenty pianists, Winter Music is dedicated to Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. The composition marks Cage’s first significant foray into indeterminacy, or music based on unrepeatability.\n\nFebruary 10: Leo Castelli opens a gallery at 4 East 77th Street in New York devoted to the work of young American and European abstractionists.\n\nPremiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s The Tower, Kaufmann Concert Hall, 92nd Street YM-YWHA, New York, with set by Rauschenberg and costumes by Johns. The set consists of a Combine, The Tower (1957). The performance also includes Tropes, The Least Flycatcher, Three Epitaphs, and Untitled Duet (all 1956), for which Rauschenberg created the set, costumes, and/or sound.\n\nMarch 8: Morton Feldman and Ilse Getz bring Castelli and his wife Ileana (later Ileana Sonnabend) to Rauschenberg’s Pearl Street studio. Rauschenberg introduces them to Johns, whose work Castelli saw the previous day at the preview for Artists of the New York School: Second Generation at the Jewish Museum, New York. The Castellis are excited by Johns’s work and offer him a show, but leave without any offer to Rauschenberg. Several days later, they offer Rauschenberg a show in March 1958.\n\nMarch 10–April 28: Participates in Artists of the New York School: Second Generation, an invitational, juried exhibition of twenty-three artists. Exhibits Red Import (1954) and three collages, including Opportunity #2, Opportunity #7, and Opportunity #9 (all 1956). Johns exhibits Green Target (1955).\n\nMay 6–29: Participates in New Work: Bluhm, Budd, Dzubas, Johns, Leslie, Louis, Marisol, Ortman, Rauschenberg, Savelli, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits Gloria (1956). Johns exhibits Flag (1954–55).\n\nOctober 20: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s new program, Seven New Dances, Kaufmann Concert Hall, 92nd Street YM-YWHA, New York. According to the program, Rauschenberg and Johns are artistic collaborators. Set and costumes by Rauschenberg and Taylor, working under the pseudonym George Tacet. The performance includes the dances Epic, Events I, Resemblance, Panorama, Duet, Events II, and Opportunity. Based on Taylor’s interest in familiar movements, Rauschenberg suggests that the dancers wear their own clothing rather than designed costumes. For the set of Resemblance, Rauschenberg proposes that a dog signal the beginning of the piece by walking onto the stage and sitting, and the dog then designates the end by leaving the stage; during the actual performance, however, the dog does not perform as trained.\n\nNovember 30: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Changeling and Labyrinthian Dances, Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York. Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes for both works and also provided the lighting for Changeling. Springweather and People (1955) is also performed with redesigned costumes by Rauschenberg.\n\nDecember 16, 1957–January 4, 1958: Participates in Collage in America, Zabriskie Gallery, New York, a traveling exhibition organized by the American Federation of Arts, New York. Exhibits Collage with Rock (1957).\n\nSet by Rauschenberg for Paul Taylor Dance Company’s The Tower (1957). Pictured: Matt Turney, Carol Rubenstein, and Barbara Janezic. Photo: Louis Stevenson\n\n1958\n\nJanuary 20–February 8: Johns mounts his first solo exhibition, Jasper Johns: Paintings, Leo Castelli, New York. All but two paintings are sold by the close of the exhibition, including three to the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nFebruary 27–April 6: Participates in Collage International: From Picasso to the Present, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston. Exhibits Collage with Letter (1957). Johns exhibits Figure 1 (1955).\n\n[Late winter]: Begins using solvent-transfer techniques with photographic reproductions from magazines to make drawings. Solvents, such as turpentine, are applied to the printed image, which when rubbed with the tip of a pen or other implement is transferred to the paper. He later uses lighter fluid in place of turpentine. The resulting image is a reversal of the original and reveals the artist’s use of the pen, the effect of which resembles hatching. Rauschenberg finds that glossy magazine illustrations work best and frequently selects images from Newsweek, Time, Sports Illustrated, and Life.\n\nMarch: Moves to 128 Front Street after the Pearl Street building is condemned by New York City authorities. Johns also moves into the same building. Rauschenberg’s and Johns’s studios are above Marotta’s Real Italian Hero Sandwiches on the second and third floors respectively.\n\nMarch 4–29: Robert Rauschenberg, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits approximately twenty Combines. Castelli buys Bed (1955), the only artwork sold.\n\nMarch 18: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Rebus, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, for which Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes.\n\nMarch 27: Participates in panel discussion “Patriotism and the American Home,” Eighth Street Club, moderated by Frederick Kiesler, who becomes a champion of Rauschenberg’s work. Other participants include Allan Kaprow, George Ortman, and Richard Stankiewicz.\n\nMay 15: With Emile de Antonio and Johns, organizes Twenty-Five Year Retrospective Concert of the Music of John Cage, Town Hall, New York. David Tudor selects music and Merce Cunningham conducts. A recording of the concert by George Avakian will later be released as a boxed record set. In conjunction with the concert, an exhibition of Cage’s scores is held at Stable Gallery, New York.\n\n[Late spring]: Begins work on a series of transfer drawings based on the thirty-four cantos of Dante’s Inferno (1958–1960), which he has never previously read. Rauschenberg will spend two and a half years on the project, finishing in late 1960. Using John Ciardi’s translation of the poem, Rauschenberg works with Michael Sonnabend, a Dante scholar (and future husband of Ileana Castelli), to develop compositions, one for each of the thirty-four cantos (which he reads one at a time). Rauschenberg combines his own drawings and watercolors with reproductions from magazines using the solvent-transfer technique. By including popular images of figures such as John F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson, Rauschenberg gives Dante’s poem a contemporary context. Wanting to preserve Dante’s poetic structure, the artist illustrates each canto on a separate book-size sheet.\n\nJune 8–29: Bed (1955) is included in Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture—First Selection of Young American and Italian Artists, an exhibition selected by Artnews editors Alfred Frankfurter, Thomas B. Hess, and Irving Sandler, Festival of Two Worlds, Spoleto, Italy. Officials, however, refuse to show the painting in the main gallery and place it in a storage room.\n\n[July]: Participates in The Newport Jazz Festival Exhibition, Newport, Rhode Island. Exhibits Satellite (1955).\n\nAugust 14: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Antic Meet, Eleventh American Dance Festival, Connecticut College, New London, where Cunningham is in summer residency at the School of Dance. Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes, including a door on wheels and an umbrella lined with tiny Christmas lights. The costumes are basic black tights and leotards that were augmented with ready-made clothes and objects like “overalls, sacks, a nightgown, parachutes, and hooped undershirts.” David Tudor performs John Cage’s Concert for Piano and Orchestra on an amplified piano; accessory noisemakers are connected to electrical circuits.\n\nAugust 17: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Summerspace, Eleventh American Dance Festival, Connecticut College, New London, for which Rauschenberg designs the set, costumes, and lighting. The costumes are covered with pointillist dots, so that they blend in with a similarly painted backdrop.\n\nSeptember: Matson Jones–Custom Display design two window displays for Tiffany & Co., New York, that present a tableaux of birds and a forest; the latter is the company’s last project.\n\nOctober 5: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Night Wandering with the title Nattvandrare at the Kungi Teatern, Stockholm. Original costumes and lighting by Nick (Nicola) Cernovich will be redesigned by Rauschenberg. The redesigned costumes, made in fur to keep with the Nordic theme of the dance, are believed to have been used for the first time for Seven Performances, Sixteenth American Dance Festival, Connecticut College, July 27–August 18, 1963.\n\nFall: After completing six Dante drawings (1958–60), applies for, but does not receive, a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation grant to complete the remaining twenty-eight drawings. Discouraged, Rauschenberg sets the project aside until mid-1959, when he will resume in earnest.\n\n[Late fall]: With Johns, visits the Philadelphia Museum of Art to see works by Marcel Duchamp in the permanent installation of the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection.\n\nDecember 5, 1958–February 8, 1959: Participates in the Pittsburgh Bicentennial International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture, Carnegie Institute. Exhibits Painting with Red Letter S (1957). Seymour Knox acquires the painting for his private collection, which will later become part of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo.\n\nDecember 20: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Images and Reflections, Kaufmann Concert Hall, 92nd Street YM-YWHA, New York, for which Rauschenberg designs the set and costumes. The costumes include a white mane worn by Taylor, transparent veils worn by three female dancers, and a brown and green shawl.\n\nDecember 29, 1958–January 24, 1959: Participates in Beyond Painting, Alan Gallery, New York. Exhibits Talisman (1958). Johns exhibits Three Flags (1958).\n\nRauschenberg working on a solvent transfer drawing in his Front Street studio, New York, 1958. Photo: Jasper Johns\n\nCostumes by Rauschenberg for Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Antic Meet (1958), Five New York Evenings, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, September 1964. Pictured: Carolyn Brown and Merce Cunningham. Photo: Hans Malmberg\n\nRauschenberg in his Pearl Street studio, New York, March, 1958. Works shown are Charlene (1954), Untitled (ca. 1954), and partial rear view of the second state of Monogram (1955–59; second state 1956–58). Photo: Dan Budnik\n\nSet and costumes by Rauschenberg for Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Images and Reflections, 1958. Pictured: Maggie Newman and Taylor\n\n1959\n\nMakes Broadcast (1959), a painting in which three radios are concealed behind the canvas. Viewers are invited to manipulate dials that adjust the volume and change the stations. The work anticipates Rauschenberg’s technology works of the 1960s. Alan Solomon, director of the Andrew Dickson White Museum (subsequently the Herbert F. Johnson Museum), Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, purchases Migration (1959) for the institution’s collection; this is the first museum purchase of a Rauschenberg painting.\n\n[Winter]: Completes Monogram (1955–59). For its final state, following Johns’s suggestion that the animal be set within a picture on the floor, Rauschenberg places the goat in the center of a collaged and painted square platform mounted on wheels. The title results from the union of the goat and tire, which reminds Rauschenberg of the interweaving letters of a monogram.\n\nJanuary 12–February 6: Participates in Art and the Found Object, Time-Life Reception Center, New York. Exhibits Odalisk (1955/1958), Gloria (1956), and Interior (1956). Rauschenberg purchases a ready-made by Marcel Duchamp, Bottle Rack (1914, fourth version 1960), from the exhibition for $3.\n\n[Around January 30]: Poet and critic Nicolas Calas brings Duchamp to visit Rauschenberg’s and Jasper Johns’s Front Street studios.\n\nMarch 1–April 5: Participates in Contemporary American Painting and Sculpture, University of Illinois at Urbana. Exhibits Curfew (1958).\n\nMarch 14: Single performance of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s From the Poems of White Stone and Gambit for Dancers and Orchestra, Festival of Contemporary Arts, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Rauschenberg designed costumes for both and the set for the latter.\n\nMarch 31–April 8: Participates in Three: Norman Bluhm, Jean Dubuffet, and Robert Rauschenberg, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits final state of Monogram (1955–59). Collector Robert Scull offers to buy the work as a donation to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, but director Alfred H. Barr Jr., declines the offer. In December 1964, the work will be purchased by Moderna Museet, Stockholm.\n\nApril 8: In an interview with critic and journalist Jerry Tallmer of the Village Voice, published in conjunction with the solo exhibition Marcel Duchamp at Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, Duchamp raises the question, “Do you know the works of Rauschenberg and Jaspers [sic]?” Rauschenberg clips out and saves the article.\n\nMay: Leo Castelli introduces Rauschenberg and Johns to Yoshiaki Tono, whose writings bring their work to the attention of a Japanese audience.\n\nMay 30: Rauschenberg, a solo exhibition of solvent-transfer drawings opens, Galleria la Tartaruga, Rome.\n\nJune: Robert Rosenblum, then teaching at Princeton University, introduces Frank Stella to Rauschenberg and Johns.\n\nJuly 11–October 11: Participates in Documenta II: Kunst nach 1945 (Art after 1945), Kassel, West Germany.

Only Trophy I contains a literal portrait—a photograph—of the subject.\n\nSeptember 21–December 2: Participates in 5th São Paulo Biennial, Museu de Arte Moderna, in the American section of the exhibition, organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Exhibits Hazard (1957), Painting with Red Letter S (1957), and Trophy I (for Merce Cunningham).\n\nOctober 2–25: Participates in First Paris Biennial, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Exhibits Talisman(1958), Forge (1959), and Photograph (1959).\n\nOctober 4, 6–10: Allan Kaprow’s 18 Happenings in 6 Parts, Reuben Gallery, New York. During one evening’s performance, Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns substitute for Red Grooms and Lester Johnson. In the fifth part of the event, they leave their seats in the audience and paint, each with a single color, circles (which Rauschenberg makes by using the paint-can lid) and straight lines (Johns) on opposite sides of an unprimed canvas.\n\nOctober 6–17: Participates in a group show inaugurating new space of Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits Inlet (1959).

The exhibition coincides with publication of the book School of New York: Some Younger Artists, edited by B. H. Friedman and includes a text on Rauschenberg by David Myers.\n\nDecember 15, 1959–January 5, 1960: Participates in Exposition internationale du surréalisme: 1959–1960, organized by André Breton and Marcel Duchamp, Galerie Daniel Cordier, Paris. Exhibits Bed (1955) and Odalisk (1955/1958). Johns exhibits Target with Plaster Casts (1955).\n\nDecember 16, 1959–February 14, 1960: Participates in Sixteen Americans, organized by Dorothy C. Miller, Museum of Modern Art, New York. Exhibits seven Combines: Satellite (1955), Wager (1957–59), Curfew (1958), Double Feature, Kickback, Magician, and Summerstorm (all 1959). The exhibition, which includes some younger artists who have never had solo exhibitions in New York, presents works by Rauschenberg, Jay De Feo, Wally Hedrick, James Jarvaise, Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Alfred Leslie, Landes Lewitin, Richard Lytle, Robert Mallary, Louise Nevelson, Julius Schmidt, Richard Stankiewicz, Frank Stella, Albert Urban, and Jack Youngerman. The exhibition catalogue includes Rauschenberg’s statement: “Painting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. (I try to act in that gap between the two.)”\n\n[December 25]: Marcel and Teeny Duchamp visit Rauschenberg and Johns at their Front Street studios. They dine together in Chinatown.\n\nSixteen Americans, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1959–60. Works shown are Rauschenberg’s Satellite (1955), Summerstorm (1959), and Kickback [formerly titled King] (1959). Photo: Rudy Burckhardt\n\n1960-69\n\n1960\n\nContinues to work on Combines, which tend to be more painterly with larger fields of bright color and fewer photographic images than earlier Combine works. Incorporates new collage materials, such as hardware, electrical devices, and mechanical objects. Rauschenberg explains to a reviewer that he is trying to avoid the “souvenir quality” of some of his earlier works: “Nostalgia tends to eliminate some of the directness. Immediacy is the only thing you can trust.”\n\nIn Los Angeles, Edward Kienholz creates Odious to Rauschenberg, an electromechanical work with a rotating deer’s head and a hidden diathermy machine. It is originally intended as a practical joke to be given to Rauschenberg, but Kienholz keeps it.\n\nFebruary 16: Merce Cunningham Dance Company performance, Phoenix Theater, New York, organized by Rauschenberg, Emile de Antonio, and Jasper Johns. Works performed include the New York premiere of Summerspace (1958).\n\nMarch 17: Jean Tinguely’s Homage to New York staged in the sculpture garden, Museum of Modern Art, New York. Tinguely’s large kinetic sculpture of bicycle wheels, old motors, a piano, and other objects found in junkyards is designed to self-destruct within thirty minutes. Tinguely is assisted by Billy Klüver, an engineer in the Communications Research Department at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey. Rauschenberg contributes Money Thrower for Tinguely’s H.T.N.Y. (1960), conceived as the mascot, a sculpture that scatters a dozen silver dollars into the audience. It is likely that while working on Homage to New York, Rauschenberg and Klüver first meet.\n\nMarch 29–April 16: Robert Rauschenberg, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits Broadcast, Canyon, Gift for Apollo, Inlet, and Winter Pool (all 1959), Allegory (1959-60), and Hawk (1960).\n\nApril 21: Participates in Art 1960, a symposium moderated by Robert Goldwater at New York University’s Eisner and Lubin Auditorium.

A triple portrait from the session will appear in the September 1960 issue of Harper’s Bazaar, accompanying the short piece “The Gift of Nonconforming” by Jean Dutourd, and is later featured in Avedon’s monograph, An Autobiography, published in 1993. Individual portraits of Rauschenberg were taken the same day, only one of which was later published, in 2005, on the cover of the exhibition catalogue Robert Rauschenberg: Combines.\n\nMay 18–June 18: Participates in Society for Contemporary Art 20th Annual Exhibition, Art Institute of Chicago. Exhibits the Combine Inlet (1959), for which he is awarded a prize of $3,000.\n\nMay 31–June 25: Participates in Summary 1959–1960, Leo Castelli, New York.\n\nJune 6–30: Participates in New Media—New Forms One: Junk Culture as Tradition, Martha Jackson Gallery, New York. Exhibits Odalisk (1955/1958).\n\nAugust 18–21: 13th American Dance Festival, Connecticut, College New London. Includes the American premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s renamed Night Wandering (1958) (originally Nattvandrare) on August 18, and the world premiere of Cunningham Dance Company’s Crises on August 19, for which Rauschenberg designed the costumes in “red” tones, ranging from pink to deep red, with one yellow chosen for Viola Farber.\n\nFall: Begins involvement with a group of young choreographers who attend a dance composition class taught by Robert Dunn at Merce Cunningham’s studio from 1960 to 1962. Dunn, a composer who studies with John Cage, encourages dancers to separate composition from choreography and to arrange material using methods of chance. The group will come to be known, in 1963, as Judson Dance Theater. Striving to break with conventions of modern dance, they explore unfixed choreography and nondance movements, and they adopt Rauschenberg’s practice of using whatever is available for props and performers. Rauschenberg later states that “a good Judson piece was really boring, usually too long with never enough happening.”\n\nFall: Retreats to Treasure Island, a small fishing village near St. Petersburg, Florida, to complete illustrations for Dante’s Inferno (1958–60). Ileana Castelli and Johns visit on separate occasions.\n\nSeptember 24: Premieres of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Hands Birds and Waka, Festivale Internazionale di Musica Contemporanea, 23rd Biennale Internazionale d’Arte, Teatro La Fenice, Venice, for which Rauschenberg designs the costumes. For Waka, he reuses costumes that he had created for From the Poems of White Stone (1959).\n\nNovember: Creates solvent-transfer drawing Election (1960) during the televised broadcast of the results of the presidential election, in which John F. Kennedy becomes the thirty-fifth president of the United States.\n\nNovember 28, 1960–January 14, 1961: Participates in International Surrealist Exhibition, D’Arcy Galleries, New York. Exhibits Bed (1955). Johns exhibits Target with Plaster Casts (1955).\n\nDecember 6, 1960–January 7, 1961: First exhibition of Rauschenberg’s series of transfer drawings illustrating Dante’s Inferno, Leo Castelli, New York.\n\nJohn Cage, musician; Merce Cunningham, choreographer; and Robert Rauschenberg, artist, New York City, May 2, 1960. Photo: Richard Avedon. © The Richard Avedon Foundation\n\n1961\n\nMakes Combine paintings, such as Pantomime (1961) and Reservoir (1961), which incorporate working electric fans, clocks, and other elements to create a sense of motion and real time. The works that “perform” have a theatrical dimension.\n\nFebruary 10–March 12: Participates in Six Decades of American Painting of the Twentieth Century, Des Moines Art Center, Iowa. Exhibits one of the Red Paintings (1953–54), Untitled (1954).\n\nMarch 10–April 17: At Billy Klüver’s invitation, creates the Combine, Black Market (1961) for the exhibition Bewogen beweging. Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. The exhibition and its tour is commonly referred to as Art in Motion. Black Market consists of a painting, a rope, and a valise, and it invites the viewer to exchange small objects with it, taking items from the valise and replacing them with messages or drawings. The drawings thus record the work’s development over time. When objects and drawings are taken from the work and are not replaced, Rauschenberg withdraws the invitation for viewer participation. The exhibition travels to Moderna Museet, Stockholm (as Rörelse i konsten) and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark (as Bevaegelese i kunsten).\n\nApril 15: Sends Election (1960) to President and Mrs. Kennedy. The work will be auctioned from the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate in 1996, selling for $220,000. In a letter accompanying the gift, Rauschenberg writes:\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nThis drawing should belong to you or me. If you enjoy it I would be deeply honored if you accept it. My concern with the election, primarily your becoming our next president, interrupted a 2 1⁄2 year project of illustrating Dante’s Inferno. That fact + a need to celebrate your victory in my own medium is the subject. It is the only drawing in which the Dante image is used outside of the illustrations. (Small figure, lower right hand corner next to large D). The Greek head and Washington reiterates that the content of the drawing is art and politics. Red, white + blue is your color. The headlined, televised, radioed purple is Jacqueline’s. The rest is, I think, self-explanatory, including the formal fading waves of “Dick + Pat” in the upper right.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRobert Rauschenberg\n\nMay: Solo exhibition, Galerie Daniel Cordier, Paris. Exhibits a selection of drawings and twelve Combine paintings: Hymnal (1955), Rebus (1955), Gloria (1956), K24976S (1956), Forge (1959), Allegory (1960), Diplomat (1960), Hawk (1960), Pilgrim (1960), Summer Rental + 3 (1960), Untitled (1960–61), and Trophy II (for Teeny and Marcel Duchamp) (1960). Only one drawing and one painting are sold, although the show is popular with critics and artists.\n\nMay: Interview conducted by André Parinaud, “Un ‘Misfit’ de la peinture new-yorkaise se confesse,” published in Arts, a Parisian weekly newspaper. The interview establishes Rauschenberg’s reputation in Europe, where he becomes popular with European critics.\n\nMay: The short-lived but widely circulated Italian journal, Metro, publishes three significant articles on Rauschenberg by art critic Dore Ashton, John Cage, and artist Gillo Dorfles.\n\nMid-May: During the installation of Rörelse i konsten [Art in Motion], Moderna Museet, Stockholm, May 16–September 10, Rauschenberg creates Johanson’s Painting and Door (both 1961), Combine paintings made of materials gathered from nearby demolished building sites. The title Johanson’s Painting results from a woman’s comment to Rauschenberg at the exhibition’s opening reception on May 17; unaware he is the artist, she tells him that “Ingemar Johansson could have made that painting” (a reference to the Swedish boxer), which immediately compels Rauschenberg to write on the canvas, “This is Johanson’s [sic].” The startled woman forcibly stops him from writing more, but he later returns to add the word “painting.”\n\nMay 15: Opening of Les 41 présentent Iris Clert [41 Portraits of Iris Clert], Galerie Iris Clert, Paris, a group exhibition of portraits of the art dealer made by forty-one artists in her honor. Rauschenberg, who is in Stockholm, forgets to submit the requisite portrait and sends instead a telegram: “This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so—Robert Rauschenberg.” (1961)\n\nMay 17: Opening evening for the exhibition Rörelse i konsten [Art in Motion], Moderna Museet, Stockholm, begins with a formal dinner. Directly following, Jean Tinguely and Per Olof Ultvedt shoot off “anti-fireworks” into the water from a rowboat on the Strömmen next to Skeppsholmen. After the vernissage, guests took a ferry to the Arena Theater on Djurgårdsvägen where Rauschenberg, Niki de Saint Phalle, Tinguely, and Ultvedt organize a performance wearing coattails, followed by a performance by Thelonious Monk. At the end of the evening, de Saint Phalle and Ultvedt plan to unveil “the world’s largest instant work of art,” however, it is not done, leaving Billy Klüver and Rauschenberg to carry the painting home. During their failed attempt to flag a car home, Rauschenberg drops the painting in the middle of Djurgårdsvägen to let cars run over it, leaving tire tracks.\n\nMay 23: Participates in a de Saint Phalle “tir,” Staket sandpit, near Värmdö, Sweden. During a “tir,” participants create explosions of color by shooting rifles at a prepared (and often white) canvas or assemblage, to which small sacks of colored paint have been attached and then covered with plaster, creating the works Grand Tir—séance Stockholm and Tir (séance Stockholm). Other participants include Pontus and Klara Hulten, Klüver, Ulf Linde, Tinguely, Anna Lena Wibom, Katrin Wibom. Shunk-Kender produces photo documentation of the event, while Klüver creates a Super 8 film.\n\nJune 1961–May 1962: Participates in Vanguard American Painting, organized by the U.S. Information Agency, and curated by H. H. Arnason, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and Jerome A. Donson. The exhibition travels to Vienna, Salzburg, Belgrade, Skopje, Zagreb, Maribor, Ljubljana, Rijeka, London, and Darmstadt. Exhibits Double Feature (1959), Trophy I (for Merce Cunningham) (1959), and Summer Rental + 1 (1960).\n\nJune 20: Participates in Homage to David Tudor, organized by Darthea Speyer, Théâtre de l’Ambassade des États-Unis, Paris. During simultaneous events staged by Rauschenberg, de Saint Phalle, Jasper Johns, Tinguely, and Tudor, each artist performs spontaneous acts of their own choosing within a set amount of time. Rauschenberg creates First Time Painting (1961) on stage, amplifying the sound of its construction with contact microphones attached to the canvas; the back of the canvas faces the audience throughout the performance. When an alarm clock attached to the painting rings, Rauschenberg wraps the work in brown paper and gives it to a bellhop from the Hôtel du Pont Royale (where Rauschenberg is staying), who carries it offstage. The audience never actually sees the work. De Saint Phalle creates Homage to Bob Rauschenberg (Shot by Rauschenberg), Rauschenberg is reported to have shot the paint rifle for several minutes while shouting “Red! Red! I want more red!”\n\nJune 28: Attends opening of de Saint Phalle’s exhibition Feu à volonté [Fire at Will], organized by Pierre Restany, Galerie J, Paris, at which visitors are invited to participate in a “tir.”\n\n[July]: Moves from Front Street into a studio at 809 Broadway, New York, a commercial building where residential occupation is illegal. Painter Öyvind Fahlström moves into Rauschenberg’s former Front Street studio.\n\n[Late July]–September 15: Participates in Le Nouveau Réalisme à Paris et à New York, organized by Pierre Restany, Galerie Rive Droite, Paris. Also exhibited are works by Arman, Lee Bontecou, César, John Chamberlain, Chryssa, Raymond Hains, Johns, Yves Klein, de Saint Phalle, Richard Stankiewicz, and Tinguely.\n\nAugust 5: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Aeon, La Comédie Canadienne, Montreal Festival. Rauschenberg designs the set, costumes, and lighting, creating elaborate effects with exploding flares, a smoking machine, and, with Klüver’s assistance, stroboscopic lights that are attached to dancers’ wrists. Rauschenberg becomes the official lighting director and stage manager; he tours with Merce Cunningham Dance Company through 1964. Rauschenberg later writes, “Local touring with dance co. was awkward, but beautiful addition to my work. The dances, the dancers, the collaboration, the responsibilities and trust which are essential in cooperative art because the most important & satisfying element in my life worked positively with the privateness and loneliness of painting.”\n\nSeptember 22–October 14: Participates in group exhibition, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits First Landing Jump (1961).\n\nOctober 4–November 12: Participates in The Art of Assemblage, organized by William Seitz, Museum of Modern Art, New York. Exhibits Talisman (1958) and Canyon (1959). The exhibition includes works from the fifteenth century to the present with examples from non-Western cultures, marking the first museum recognition of assemblage as an art form and will travel to the Dallas Museum for Contemporary Arts and San Francisco Museum of Art.\n\nOctober 13–December 31: Participates in American Abstract Expressionists and Imagists, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Exhibits Blue Exit (1961).\n\nOctober 19: Participates in a symposium at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in conjunction with The Art of Assemblage. Panelists include Lawrence Alloway, Marcel Duchamp, Richard Huelsenbeck, Seitz (moderator), and Roger Shattuck. Rauschenberg, selected to represent the younger generation of artists, assumes the role of provocateur in the discussion. During the symposium, Rauschenberg notices Duchamp taking many notes. When Rauschenberg asks Duchamp what he found so interesting, Duchamp reveals a page of doodles, which he signs and gives to Rauschenberg.\n\nOctober 20: Issue of Art International with cover design by Rauschenberg. The magazine includes Françoise Choay’s “Dada, Néo-Dada, et Robert Rauschenberg,” an article on Rauschenberg’s Combines.\n\nOctober 24–December: Rauschenberg, Galleria dell’Ariete, Milan. Exhibits Hymnal (1955), Rebus (1955), Gloria (1956), K24976S (1956), Forge (1959), Allegory (1960), Diplomat (1960), Hawk (1960), Pilgrim (1960), Summer Rental + 3 (1960), Untitled (1960), and Trophy II (for Teeny and Marcel Duchamp) (1960).\n\nOctober 27, 1961–January 7, 1962: Participates in Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture, Carnegie Institute. Exhibits Second Time Painting (1961).\n\nNovember 7–December 5: Opens Rauschenberg, Leo Castelli, New York. For the installation, Rauschenberg gradually replaces works in the previous exhibition with his own paintings and sculptures. The show ends as he replaces his works with works by other artists. Rauschenberg’s works, which are assembled from tires, signs, and other materials found on city streets, include the Combines: Aen Floga, Coexistence, Empire I, Empire II, First Landing Jump, Magician II, Pantomime, Reservoir, and Trophy IV (for John Cage) (all 1961). Rauschenberg’s design for the exhibition announcement, which was also a foldout poster, consists of his photograph of printed fragments that contain the title, location, and date of the exhibition strewn among junk piled on his studio floor.\n\nDecember 13, 1961–February 4, 1962: Participates in Contemporary American Painting, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Exhibits Third Time Painting (1961).\n\nRauschenberg assembling the Aeon “machine,” part of Rauschenberg’s set for Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Aeon (1961), Japan, 1964\n\nRauschenberg shooting at Grand Tir - séance Stockholm, anlässlich einer Tir-Session de Saint Phalles in a stone quarry near Stockholm, 1961.

The exhibition provides many from the West Coast their first opportunity to see Rauschenberg’s work in person.\n\nMarch 6: Attends opening of Edward Kienholz’s exhibition of Roxys (1960–61), a walk-through tableau, Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles.\n\nMarch 17–May 6: Participates in 4 Amerikanare: Jasper Johns, Alfred Leslie, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Stankiewicz, organized by Pontus Hultén, Moderna Museet, Stockholm. Exhibits Bed (1955), Odalisk (1955/1958), and Gift for Apollo (1959). The exhibition will travel to Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and Kunsthalle Bern.\n\nEarly spring: After two years of invitations from Tatyana Grosman, founder of Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), West Islip, New York, and with the encouragement of Jasper Johns, who began working at ULAE in 1960, Rauschenberg accepts offer to create prints at the press. Makes first lithograph, Abby’s Bird (1962), published in an edition of fifty for New York Hilton Hotel. Lighter fluid is used on the print to transfer magazine images to the lithography stone, and the work is subsequently named after a friend, Abby Friedman, wife of writer and critic B. H. Friedman. Later this year, Rauschenberg creates Stunt Man (1962), three editions of color lithographs also published by ULAE.\n\nApril 7–21: Exhibits Ace (1962), a five-panel Combine, Leo Castelli, New York.\n\nApril 11: Premiere of Paul Taylor Dance Company’s Tracer, Théâtre des Nations, an international theater-arts festival, Paris. Rauschenberg designed the costumes (marked with tire treads) and set, a stationary bicycle wheel that an onstage motor spins at different speeds.\n\nMay 4: Performs in The Construction of Boston, Maidman Playhouse, New York, and designs the set, which resembles a furnished apartment. The fifteen-minute play is a collaboration among Rauschenberg, de Saint Phalle, poet Kenneth Koch, who wrote the text, and Tinguely. Merce Cunningham directed, but declined credit at the last moment. The actors include the collaborators (excluding Koch), who chose doubles to speak their lines: Elmarie Dooley doubles for de Saint Phalle, Henry Geldzahler for Tinguely, and Frank Stella for Rauschenberg. Highlights include de Saint Phalle performing a “tir” by shooting a rifle at a plaster statue of Venus de Milo, which then “bleeds,” and Tinguely, in a white gown, building a cinder-block wall between audience and performers. Rauschenberg operates Tinguely’s weather machine, which scatters plastic balls into the audience and soaks the actors with “rain,” and plants a rosebush.\n\nMay 6–27: Participates in the 18th Salon de mai, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Exhibits Cartoon (1962).\n\nSpring: Work commences with engineers Billy Klüver and Harold Hodges on an interactive sculpture, Oracle (1962–65), which incorporates radios to be operated by viewers, a plan originally intended for Ace (1962).\n\nLate spring: Makes lithographs Urban and Suburban (both 1962) by covering lead type and photoengraved newspaper plates—salvaged from the New York Times composing room—with lithographic tusche and transferring imagery onto the stone.\n\nSummer: Creates the Combine Inside-Out (1962), featured in Gene Swenson’s “Rauschenberg Paints a Picture,” Artnews, an article on the making of the work.\n\nJuly 6: First Concert of Dance presented by Judson Dance Theater at Judson Memorial Church, New York. The three-hour program includes dances by William Davis, Ruth Emerson, David Gordon, Deborah Hay, Fred Herko, John Herbert McDowell, Gretchen MacLane, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Carol Scothorn, and Elaine Summers, as well as a collaboration by Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, and Charles Rotmil, and music by John Cage. The group will perform at the Judson Church and other nonproscenium spaces—including lofts, television studios, pools, and skating rinks—until 1968.\n\nAugust: Travels to Amsterdam to collect materials for his artwork Dylaby (1962) to be presented in the upcoming exhibition Dylaby (Dynamisch Labyrint), Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.\n\nAugust 30–September 30: Dylaby (Dynamisch Labyrint), Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. The exhibition consists of installations by Rauschenberg, Martial Raysse, de Saint Phalle, Daniel Spoerri, Tinguely, and Per Olof Ultvedt. Rauschenberg designs the cover of the exhibition catalogue. Stedelijk Museum director Willem Sandberg and curator Ad Peterson invite the artists to collaborate on a single sculptural work—an environment or labyrinth to be walked through; the artists find it too difficult, however, to reconcile their diverse views and, to Rauschenberg’s disappointment, decide to create separate pieces. His installation is a mechanized cityscape. The viewer walks on a floor painted to look like a street between large rectangular areas that are enclosed by wire fences and contain assemblages of found objects, including an airplane wing, seashells, and a cluster of clocks operating at different speeds and times. While the clocks hum, an electric device pumps air into a large tub of water to produce bubbling sounds. The experience, especially the effort required to work with such bulky objects, steers Rauschenberg away from sculpture and back toward painting, “I was really sick of sculpture. Nothing appealed to me more when I got back than the gentility of a beautifully stretched piece of canvas.” Nevertheless, he will later produce such technology-based sculptural works as Soundings (1968) and Mud Muse (1968–71).\n\nSeptember 18: At the invitation of art critic and curator Henry Geldzahler, visits—along with David Bourdon, artist Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, and Ileana and Michael Sonnabend—Andy Warhol’s studio in New York. During his visit, views Warhol’s recent silkscreen paintings. In the previous month, Warhol had begun to silkscreen canvas using photographic images rather than stencils.\n\nAfter September 18: Warhol creates series of silkscreen portraits of Rauschenberg, including Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1963), for which he requests family photographs from Rauschenberg. Using a process of overlay and repetition, the resulting canvas serves as an homage to Rauschenberg. In the top three rows, Rauschenberg family photographs are rendered in sepia tones, channeling a nostalgic past; the fourth register, transitions to black and white and includes images of Rauschenberg’s former wife, Susan Weil, and his sister, Janet; while the remaining two rows of the canvas repeat an image of Rauschenberg from a contemporary photograph by Steve Paxton. Taking its title from James Agee’s and Walker Evans’s photo essay from 1941, Warhol pays tribute to Rauschenberg and the transformation from his childhood in the South during the Great Depression to his adult life as an artist living in New York.\n\nSeptember 22–October 13: Participates in group exhibition, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits Rigger (1961).\n\nOctober: After previous failed attempts to photosensitize canvas, begins to silkscreen paintings, finding the use of photographic imagery in the Combines and solvent-transfer drawings restrictive because of the inability to alter their size or reuse the images. Similar to the materials used for the illustrations for Dante’s Inferno (1958–60), sources for images include National Geographic, Life, Esquire, Boxing and Wrestling, and newspapers, as well as his own photographs. Photographic images are sent to a commercial screenmaker, Aetna Silk Screen Products, New York, with instructions that indicate the dimensions desired and the number of screens, one for each color, needed. Approximately fifty screens, reused for numerous artworks, will be made between October 1962 and June 1963. A black-and-white color scheme, Rauschenberg’s preference in his own photography, will be dominant until 1963, when he will begin to use more color. The silkscreened images are complemented by gestural applications of oil paint, and in some works, Rauschenberg experiments with additional collage elements, for example, a deflated inner tube in Tadpole (1963).\n\nOctober 6–November 11: Participates in 3rd International Biennial Exhibition of Prints, National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. Exhibits nine lithographs made at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), West Islip, New York, including Abby’s Bird (1962) and Merger (1962). Awarded Ohara Art Museum Prize.\n\nNovember 18–December 15: Participates in My Country ’Tis of Thee, Dwan Gallery, Los Angeles. Exhibits Coexistence (1961).\n\n[Late fall]: Begins—and substantially completes in twenty-four hours, during the filming of a CBS television documentary by Mike Wallace—Barge (1962–63), a 32-foot-long silkscreen painting and his largest work to date. Finishing touches were added later, at the end of 1962 into the beginning of 1963. Geldzahler, who will encounter the work at the Jewish Museum in 1963, describes its effect as “very much like sitting in the first row of a black and white, large-screen movie. The images flash by and we make connections; we end up without a story, but with something much richer—the associative and imaginative leaps that Rauschenberg’s works open up for us.”\n\nDecember 12, 1962–February 3, 1963: Participates in Annual Exhibition of Sculpture and Drawing, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Exhibits Letterhead (now Headline, 1962), a solvent-transfer drawing.\n\nRauschenberg working with master printer Robert Blackburn at ULAE (Universal Limited Art Editions), West Islip, New York, 1962.

Under the auspices of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art, the drawings will be exhibited in museums throughout Europe over the next two years and throughout the United States from 1966 to 1968.\n\nIn collaboration with engineer Harold Hodges, makes Dry Cell (1963), an interactive sculpture where motion is voice activated. Viewers are encouraged to speak into a small microphone that is wired to a motor that in turn causes a small, irregularly shaped piece of metal to spin. The face of the work is Plexiglas onto which is screened an image of the army helicopter that also appears in many of the silkscreen paintings, including Kite (1963).\n\nJanuary: Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, New York, founded to support performances by avant-garde artists and composers. Directors include John Cage, Jasper Johns, Elaine de Kooning, and other artists.\n\nFebruary 1–16 and February 20–March 9: Consecutive solo exhibitions Rauschenberg: Première Exposition (Oeuvres 1954–1961) and Rauschenberg: Seconde Exposition (Oeuvres 1962–1963), Galerie Ileana Sonnabend, Paris. Première Exposition includes Combines Charlene (1954), Hymnal (1955), Monogram (1955–59), Gloria (1956), Memorandum of Bids (1956), Rhyme (1956), Untitled (1956), Gift for Ileana (1956–59), Blue Collage (now Collage with Blue, 1957), Collage with Cuff (1957), Bypass (1959), and Dylaby (1962). Seconde Exposition includes silkscreen paintings: Almanac (1962), Brace (1962), Calendar (1962), Crocus (1962), Echo (1962), Exile (1962), Glider (1962), Payload (1962), Shortstop (1962), Vault (1962), and four untitled paintings (all 1963). Man Ray attends opening. Critic Pierre Schneider describes the work as “combining ‘raw’ objects (radio sets, stuffed goats, keys, neckties, etc.) with paint as sweetly tasty as the Good Humor man’s goodies. There they are, the erstwhile ruffians of mass production with pretty pigments round their necks, like repentant delinquents meekly wearing the choir boy’s surplice.”\n\nFebruary 3–28: Exhibits silkscreen paintings—Cove, Tadpole, Express, Junction, and Dry Run (all 1963)—at Beaumont-May Gallery, Hopkins Center, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, where he is a visiting artist for the spring semester.\n\nFebruary 25–March 2: Participates in Exhibition for the Benefit of the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, Allan Stone Gallery, New York. Contributes Overcast II (1962), a black-and-white silkscreen painting.\n\nMarch 14–June 2: Participates in Six Painters and the Object, curated by Lawrence Alloway, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Exhibits Untitled (now Collection, 1954), Factum II (1957), Migration (1959), Overcast I (1962), Overcast II (1962), and Junction (1963). His inclusion in the exhibition, along with artists Jim Dine, Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol, led critics to identify Rauschenberg with Pop art, an affiliation that he rejected.\n\nMarch 31–May 12: First retrospective museum exhibition, Robert Rauschenberg, organized by Alan Solomon, director of the Jewish Museum, New York. The show consists of fifty-five works spanning his entire career to date. Rauschenberg creates the exhibition poster, an offset lithograph which is an adaptation of the lithograph Rival (1963). The exhibition marks the first occasion for a museum to present the work of a post–World War II artist from New York and initiates the Jewish Museum’s contemporary art program, which will thrive throughout the rest of the decade. Victor and Sally Ganz, prominent collectors, purchase Winter Pool (1959) from Leo Castelli, New York, the day after the opening.\n\nSpring: Creates “Random Order,” published in Location, a short-lived New York–based magazine. The work consists of a full-page reproduction of silkscreen painting Sundog (1962), a two-page collage of Rauschenberg’s own photographs and handwritten text, a full-page reproduction of silkscreen painting Renascence (1962), and a full-page reproduction of a photograph by Rauschenberg labeled “View from the artist’s studio.” The project illustrates Rauschenberg’s interest in finding connections among the disparate events of daily life or, as he writes, locating the “random order that cannot be described as accidental.”\n\nApril 18–June 2: Participates in The Popular Image, Washington Gallery of Modern Art, Washington, D.C. Exhibits Backwash (1959), Black Market (1961), Cove (1963), and Express (1963).\n\nApril 28, 29: An Evening of Dance, Judson Memorial Church, New York, a program for which Rauschenberg serves as lighting director and designs the flyer. This is the first event to use the name Judson Dance Theater in its promotional materials. Yvonne Rainer’s Terrain premieres.\n\nMay 3–June 10: Participates in Schrift en beeld [Art and Writing], Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Exhibits a Combine painting, Bypass (1959), a lithograph, Urban (1962), and a transfer drawing, Comment Drawing (1962). The exhibition will travel to Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden.\n\nMay 9: Premiere of Pelican, the first performance choreographed by Rauschenberg, Concert of Dance Number Five, an evening of performances by Judson Dance Theater, Pop Art Festival, Washington, D.C. (Rauschenberg does the lighting for all events). The festival of theater, dance, and film is organized by curator Alice Denney in conjunction with the exhibition The Popular Image, Washington Gallery of Modern Art, Washington, D.C. In the performance, which takes place at America on Wheels, a roller-skating rink, Rauschenberg and artist Per Olof Ultvedt (replaced by Alex Hay in later performances), wear circular structures of stretched parachute silk on their backs and propel themselves on roller skates while Carolyn Brown, a member of Merce Cunningham Dance Company, dances on pointe between them. The accompanying sound track, created by Rauschenberg, is a collage of sounds ranging from radio, television, and film to music by George Frideric Handel and Franz Joseph Haydn.\n\n[June]: Begins using color in silkscreen paintings, occasionally using some of the same images previously included in the black-and-white silkscreen paintings. Rauschenberg quickly abandons attempts to replicate realistic color and to maintain exact color registration, choosing instead to highlight a handmade quality.\n\nJune 9: Accident (1963) wins Grand Prize, 5th International Exhibition of Graphic Art, Moderna Galerija, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. This is the first time the award goes to an American. The title of the print, published by Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), West Islip, New York, in an edition of twenty-nine, derives from the breaking of the lithography stones twice during the printing. When the second stone broke, Rauschenberg decides that he wants to go ahead with the printing; the imprint of the crack and broken chips of stone at the bottom of the print documents the event. The print and award establish ULAE as a preeminent print workshop.\n\nJune 10: Rauschenberg performs his Prestidigitator Extraordinary, a solo work, at the Pocket Follies, a benefit organized by James Waring for the Foundation for the Contemporary Performance Arts, Pocket Theater, New York.\n\nJuly 17: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Field Dances, Royce Hall, University of California, Los Angeles, for which Rauschenberg designed the lighting and costumes (a harlequin outfit and nightdresses).\n\nJuly 24: Premiere of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Story, Royce Hall, University of California, Los Angeles, for which Rauschenberg designs the costumes, lighting, and set. The costume designs reflect Cunningham’s “open form” technique, realized in Story, in which dancers spontaneously choose to perform a sequence of material from a carefully rehearsed selection. At any moment, dancers may don any of thirty-five items (including shirts, pants, sweaters, dresses, a football player’s shoulder pads, and a gas mask) located in bags in the wings. For each performance of Story during the 1964 world tour, Rauschenberg will design a new set, using existing features of the performance space and objects found locally. As Rauschenberg later explains, “Neither dancers nor choreographers ever knew what to expect until curtain.”\n\nEarly October: Father dies of a heart attack. Rauschenberg returns to Louisiana for the funeral.\n\nOctober 26–November 21: Solo exhibition of color silkscreen paintings, Leo Castelli, New York. Exhibits Archive, Bicycle, Die Hard, Overdrive, Shaftway, and Windward (all 1963).\n\nBetween October 31 and November 2: Writes “Note on Painting” while on tour in the Southwest with Merce Cunningham Dance Company. The text, which will be published in the anthology Pop Art Redefined (1969), is punctuated with single-word descriptions of sights he sees along the road.\n\nNovember 22: President Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas.\n\n[Late fall]: Begins to incorporate portraits of Kennedy into approximately eight silkscreen paintings, including Retroactive I and Retroactive II (both 1963). Rauschenberg, who had made the screens prior to the assassination, considers not using the images of Kennedy, then realizes that it would be just as self-conscious a decision to not use as to use them. Selects an active, authoritative image of Kennedy and integrates it into a variety of contexts. At the same time, Andy Warhol depicts Jacqueline Kennedy in a series of silkscreen paintings, but his approach is to isolate the image and present it in repetition.\n\nDecember 6, 7: Rauschenberg provides lighting for Motorcyle, Judith Dunn’s two-day performance program with the Judson Dance Theater, Judson Memorial Church, New York.\n\nRauschenberg: Première Exposition (Oeuvres 1954–1961), Galerie Ileana Sonnabend, Paris, February 1963. Works shown include Monogram (1955–59), Broadcast (1959), and Charlene (1954). Photo: Shunk-Kender © J. Paul Getty Trust\n\nRauschenberg performing his piece Pelican (1963), First New York Theater Rally, former CBS studio, Broadway and Eighty-first Street, New York, May 1965. Photo: Peter Moore © Barbara Moore/Licensed by VAGA, NY\n\n1964\n\nCreates Shades (1964), an artist’s book, published by Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), West Islip, New York, in an edition of twenty-four. The work is an object-multiple, or editioned sculpture, consisting of lithographs printed on six square Plexiglas sheets, five of which are interchangeable and can be rearranged by the installer. An electric light placed inside an aluminum base can be set to blink or burn steadily. Rauschenberg’s decision to use Plexiglas arises from a remark made by Tatyana Grosman about the length of time required to make paper, to which he responds that they try printing on a transparent material. After experimentation, he settles on Plexiglas. Shades’ “text” consists of images culled from discarded photographic plates and printers’ mats from the New York Times.\n\nOne of twenty-eight artists to contribute a lithograph to 1¢ Life, a portfolio of poetry by Walasse Ting.\n\nPerforms in Party, Judson Memorial Church gymnasium, New York, with Judith Dunn, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, and Steve Paxton. Gene Friedman features the performance in his short film Three Dances (1964), along with Public, performed by museum-goers in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and Private, an improvisation by Judith Dunn in her studio.\n\nJanuary 9–February 9: Participates in Black, White and Grey Contemporary Painting and Sculpture, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut. Exhibits a White Painting (1951), a black painting (1951–52), Erased de Kooning Drawing (1953), and an untitled transfer drawing (ca. 1959).\n\nJanuary 30: Premiere of Rauschenberg’s Shot Put, Concert for New Paltz, State University of New York at New Paltz. In the solo performance, he dances in the darkness with a flashlight attached to his right foot, drawing with light in space. Dances to the accompaniment of an eleven-minute tape recording of excerpts from painter Öyvind Fahlström’s A Lecture on Birds in Sweden (1963), which is a reading of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven (1845) using stylized vocalizations. Rauschenberg provides lighting for all dances in the program, and also performs in Lucinda Childs’s Minus Auditorium Equipment and Furnishings, Alex Hay’s Colorado Plateau, and Deborah Hay’s They Will (previously Would They or Wouldn’t They) (all 1963).\n\nFebruary 2: Bryan Robertson’s interview with Rauschenberg broadcast on BBC television program Monitor.\n\nFebruary 5–March 8: Retrospective exhibition Robert Rauschenberg, Paintings, Drawings and Combines, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London.\n\nFebruary 10, 17: Surplus Dance Theater presents sur+, a series of performances at Stage 73, New York, for which Rauschenberg serves as lighting director. The group’s members include Rauschenberg, Lucinda Childs, Judith Dunn, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Robert Morris, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, and Albert Reid. Performs Shot Put and dances in Alex Hay’s Colorado Plateau (1963). Deborah Hay’s All Day Dance with Two, for which Rauschenberg designs costumes and props, is also performed.\n\nFebruary 27: Performs Shot Put, ONCE Festival, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Also performs in Steve Paxton’s Proxy (1962).\n\nFebruary 29: Calvin Tomkins’s extensive profile of Rauschenberg, “Moving Out,” appears in The New Yorker. A self-portrait—an ink thumbprint with a stenciled monogram “RR”—is the accompanying illustration.\n\nMarch 2, 9: Surplus Dance Theater presents Exchange, a series of performances at Stage 73, New York, for which Rauschenberg serves as lighting director. Performs in Deborah Hay’s They Will (previously Would They or Wouldn’t They) (1963) and one evening in Lucinda Childs’s Pastime (1963).\n\nMarch 21: Premieres of Merce Cunningham Dance Company’s Paired and Winterbranch, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut. Rauschenberg designs the costumes for Paired, a duet performed by Cunningham and Viola Farber. For Winterbranch, he designs the set, costumes (black sweatshirts and sweatpants), and creates an unusual lighting scheme regulated by chance, which often leaves areas of the stage in complete darkness.\n\nApril 22: New York World’s Fair opens. Rauschenberg’s silkscreen painting Skyway (1964) is installed on the exterior of the New York State Pavilion designed by architect Philip Johnson. Other artists commissioned to contribute murals and sculptural works include Peter Agostini, John Chamberlain, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Alexander Liberman, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mallory, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.\n\nApril 27: With Alex Hay, Rauschenberg choreographs and performs in Dredge, an improvisational piece, during Concert of Dance #14: Improvisations by the Dance Theatre, Judson Dance Theater, Judson Memorial Church. Also participates in Deborah Hay’s group performance, Untitled Improvisation.\n\nMay–June: Develops new lithography technique at ULAE, West Islip, New York, pushing lithographic tusche through commercial photosilkscreens to transfer images, some of which also appear in silkscreen paintings, onto the stone. Resulting prints include Kip-Up, Spot, Front Roll, and Breakthrough I (all 1964).\n\nMay 8: Mike Wallace interviews Rauschenberg i"
