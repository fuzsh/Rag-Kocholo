        "text": "01 of 20\n\nAlex Borstein\n\nOne of MADtv's most memorable cast members, Alex Borstein became known for her popular recurring characters such as Mrs. Swan and Eracist Anne.\n\nIt was there that she met Seth MacFarlane, who was preparing to release Family Guy as a series of animated shorts for MADtv. MacFarlane's collaboration with MADtv fell through, but Borstein stayed on as the voice of Lois Griffin when Family Guy ultimately became a long-running comedy series at Fox. Borstein has booked gigs in films like The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003), Catwoman (2004), Dinner for Schmucks (2010), and Ted (2012), and on shows such as Gilmore Girls, Robot Chicken, and Getting On.\n\nShe also plays the easily-irritated, sidesplitting Susie Myerson on Amazon Prime Video's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which has garnered her two Emmys for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She has a third Emmy for her voice-over work on Family Guy.\n\n02 of 20\n\nIke Barinholtz\n\nDuring his time on MADtv, Ike Barinholtz was one of the more popular cast members, thanks to characters like Abercrombie & Fitch model Dutch and his celebrity impersonations.\n\nIn 2007, he left the show and has since appeared in 2014's Neighbors, 2018's Blockers, and 2022's The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. He is perhaps best known for his main roles of Morgan Tookers on The Mindy Project, Griggs in Suicide Squad (2016), and Brett in season 1 of Apple TV+'s The Afterparty.\n\n03 of 20\n\nNicole Sullivan\n\nNicole Sullivan was an original MADtv cast member and introduced several characters during her six seasons on the show. Her most popular character was the emotionally abusive Vancome Lady, who appeared in the very first episode of MADtv.\n\nSullivan has been a television staple in the years since she left the show, making appearances on The King of Queens, Scrubs, Rita Rocks, Disjointed, and Black-ish, and lending her voice to Kim Possible, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman, Housebroken, and DC Super Hero Girls.\n\n04 of 20\n\nKeegan-Michael Key\n\nMADtv was already well-established when a then-unknown Keegan-Michael Key was cast for the show's ninth season. Key's turn on the sketch show was notable for his character of the enraged Coach Hines, and for his various celebrity impersonations.\n\nAfter MADtv, Key formed his Emmy-winning sketch-comedy show Key & Peele with his former castmate Jordan Peele. He's also had many film roles, such as Don't Think Twice (2016) and The Prom (2020), lending his voice to the Hotel Transylvania movies, The Lion King (2019), Toy Story 4 (2019), and Wendell & Wild (2022). His TV turns include Parks and Recreation, Friends From College, Schmigadoon!, Reboot, and more.\n\nKey made his Broadway debut in the Steve Martin-penned Meteor Shower in 2017.\n\n05 of 20\n\nJordan Peele\n\nThanks to Key & Peele, Jordan Peele is now heavily associated with Keegan-Michael Key in the public eye. Years earlier, the two actors actually auditioned against each other for MADtv, but both were cast in 2004 due to their undeniable chemistry.\n\nLike Key, Peele has found acting success after MADtv as well, booking roles in Little Fockers (2010) and Keanu (2016), and hitting the small screen on Life in Pieces in 2015, Big Mouth in 2017, and The Twilight Zone in 2019 (which he executive produced in addition to narrating). Although the camera adores him, Peele has shown us his masterful skills behind it through writing and directing several critically acclaimed horror films, such as Get Out (2017), for which he won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, Us (2019), and Nope (2022).\n\n06 of 20\n\nMo Collins\n\nMo Collins joined MADtv in 1998 and quickly became a fan favorite for her characters of Lorraine, Trina, and Stuart's mother Doreen.\n\nCollins had a recurring role as Starla on Arrested Development in the mid-2000s and picked up small roles in the Judd Apatow movies The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). However, she's mostly seen on TV with recurring and main roles of Joan Callamezzo on Parks and Recreation, Sarah Rabinowitz on Fear the Walking Dead, and several characters on F Is for Family.\n\n07 of 20\n\nMichael McDonald\n\nMichael McDonald may be the face most associated with the show for viewers. His decade on MADtv was marked by a number of popular recurring characters, including Stuart, Bible Dude, and Rusty Miller, to name a few.\n\nMcDonald went on to write, direct, produce, and appear on the ABC series Cougar Town, and direct episodes of Netflix's apocalyptic comedy series God's Favorite Idiot. He also hit the big screen with multiple Paul Feig films—2013's The Heat, 2015's Spy, and 2016's Ghostbusters—and other projects like 2018's The Happytime Murders and 2021's Halloween Kills.\n\n08 of 20\n\nDebra Wilson\n\nMichael McDonald may have had the most time on MADtv of any cast member, but Debra Wilson is the original star to last the longest—eight seasons in total. Wilson was well-known during her tenure for her character Bunifa Latifah Halifah Sharifa Jackson and for her impression of Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWilson went on to appear in Scary Movie 4 (2006), Avatar (2009), and Bodied (2017) and lent her voice to episodes of Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, Monster High, and Mickey Mouse Funhouse as well as films like 2019's Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker and many more.\n\n09 of 20\n\nArden Myrin\n\nBefore joining MADtv in 2005, Arden Myrin had appeared in guest spots on a few big network sitcoms, like Friends and Working. She stayed on the show until its cancellation in 2009 and went on to frequently serve as a panelist on Chelsea Lately.\n\nShe continued her acting career with roles in Bachelorette (2012), Satanic Panic (2019), and Space Oddity (2022), and picked up arcs on Fresh Off the Boat, Shameless, Insatiable, and Insecure.\n\n10 of 20\n\nBobby Lee\n\nBobby Lee was one of the most prolific cast members on MADtv, appearing on the show for eight seasons.\n\nHe's made several television appearances since leaving MADtv, including NCIS: Los Angeles, Magnum P.I., and And Just Like That, and acted in high-profile comedies such as Pineapple Express (2008) and star-studded indie films like How It Ends (2021).\n\n11 of 20\n\nPhil LaMarr\n\nOne of the original MADtv cast members, Phil LaMarr introduced characters such as Savante and Desperation Lee, in addition to an extensive list of celebrity impressions. LaMarr was already a veteran actor when he joined the show, with credits in Pulp Fiction (1994) and on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and The George Carlin Show already to his name.\n\nSince leaving the show, LaMarr has focused largely on voice acting, including turns as the voice of Samurai Jack in Samurai Jack in from 2001 to 2006 (and its 2017 revival season), the Green Lantern on Justice League in the mid-2000s, Hermes on Futurama, and various roles on Harley Quinn.\n\n12 of 20\n\nStephnie Weir\n\nStephnie Weir's six-year tenure on MADtv is remembered for her characters of Dot Goddard and Angela Wright, among others.\n\nShe went on to serve as a writer and consulting producer for two sitcoms: Raising Hope and The Millers. She also starred on the FX show The Comedians and picked up roles on Modern Family, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Goldbergs, A Million Little Things, and The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.\n\n13 of 20\n\nAries Spears\n\nAries Spears was another cast member with a good amount of exposure before joining MADtv. Ahead of his first appearance in 1997, Spears already had credits for South of Sunset (1993) and Jerry Maguire (1996).\n\nIn the years since he left MADtv in 2005, Spears has picked up small screen roles on CSI: Miami, TripTank, and The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder. He also cohosts a YouTube podcast with comedian Andy Steinberg.\n\n14 of 20\n\nCrista Flanagan\n\nCrista Flanagan was on MADtv for five seasons in the late-2000s, and made a name for herself with characters like stand-up comic Luann Lockhart and QVC host Christie.\n\nAside from MADtv, Flanagan is most known for her recurring role as Lois Sadler on Mad Men, and her parts on Hank and The New Adventures of Old Christine. She's also had guest spots on other TV comedies, such as Workaholics, Love, and Grace and Frankie.\n\n15 of 20\n\nArtie Lange\n\nArtie Lange may have only been on MADtv for the show's first two seasons, but he became one of its most infamous alums.\n\nA well-known struggle with substance abuse had an influence on Lange's career and was detailed in the actor's 2013 memoir, Crash and Burn.\n\nHe continued his comedy work after MADtv, with the release of albums, podcasts, and a gig on The Howard Stern Show, and made big-screen appearances in Mystery Men (1999), Old School and Elf in 2003, and Beer League in 2006. His credits also include roles on Louie, Inside Amy Schumer, and Crashing.\n\n16 of 20\n\nAnjelah Johnson-Reyes\n\nAnjelah Johnson-Reyes actually only appeared in a few episodes of MADtv, but she used that very brief spotlight to deliver two of the most memorable characters: her Vietnamese nail technician character and the fast food worker Bon Qui Qui.\n\nSince she left the show, Johnson has debuted stand-up specials, released a Christmas EP and an album as her character Bon Qui Qui, and made appearances on Ugly Betty, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Superstore, and Life & Beth. Johnson-Reyes also appeared as a contestant—among other stars like Corbin Bleu, Cat Cora, and more—on Fox's celebrity dance competition show The Real Dirty Dancing in 2022.\n\n17 of 20\n\nAndy Daly\n\nAndy Daly joined MADtv for two seasons, and, although his characters and impressions earned some acclaim, it wasn't until after he left the show in 2002 that his career began to take off.\n\nDaly went on to become a go-to actor in the comedy world, appearing on Reno 911!, Eastbound & Down, Silicon Valley, and Comedy Bang! Bang!. From 2014 to 2017, Daly helmed Comedy Central's critically acclaimed mockumentary series Review. He's also appeared on Black-ish, The Who Was? Show, and Veep, and loaned his voice to TV animations, such as Adventure Time, Harley Quinn, and Rick & Morty, in addition to frequenting the world of podcasting.\n\n18 of 20\n\nSimon Helberg\n\nBefore he got the part of the turtleneck-loving nerd Howard Wolowitz on The Big Bang Theory, Simon Helberg appeared in various episodes of MADtv.\n\nHe went on to star in Derek & Simon projects along with Derek Waters, and had notable roles on Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip ahead of his 12 years on The Big Bang Theory. In film, he costarred in the Meryl Streep-led film Florence Foster Jenkins (2016), which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and the musical Annette (2021). In 2022, he starred in As They Made Us, written and directed by Big Bang Theory costar Mayim Bialik.\n\n19 of 20\n\nNicole Parker\n\nFor six seasons, Nicole Parker made use of both her musical theater and comedy talents on MADtv by doing impressions of famous singers and incorporating music into original characters like the Disney Girl and Pat-Beth LaMontrose.\n\nParker performed as Elphaba in Wicked on Broadway in 2009 and reprised the role in the musical's first North American tour in 2012. She's also had onscreen roles including episodes of Key & Peele and Hot in Cleveland.\n\n20 of 20\n\nTaran Killam\n\nMost fans know Taran Killam from his gig on Saturday Night Live, but he refined his comedy chops with a one-season stint on MADtv back in 2001. Only 19 at the time, Killam was the youngest cast member, though he already had roles on Judging Amy, Touched by an Angel, and Roswell to his name.\n\nAfter landing his spot on SNL, Killam appeared on New Girl, Arrested Development, and Impeachment: American Crime Story. He's also secured a handful of film credits, including 2013's critically acclaimed 12 Years a Slave and 2016's American comedy Brother Nature, and launched his directorial debut with 2017's Killing Gunther, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nKillam wed actress Cobie Smulders in 2012. Five years later, he made his Broadway debut as King George III in the smash-hit musical Hamilton."
