For those born under the sign of Leo, the lion's kindred spirit holds a special significance. Just as Leo exudes confidence, charm, and leadership, so too does the lion command respect with its imposing presence and protective nature. 🌟 The lion's harmony of strength and humility serves as a poignant lesson for Leos and all alike. True leadership, the lion teaches us, is not about dominating attention, but about serving and safeguarding others. Just as lions cooperate within their pride for the greater good, Leos are reminded that collaboration and unity often yield greater success than individual efforts alone. 🌿 As Leos, we can honor our connection to the lion by supporting wildlife conservation projects through donations or volunteer work. By setting an example for others through our actions, we can inspire and motivate those around us to join in the collective effort to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats. 🌍 Channel the strength, courage, and communal spirit of the lion within us to make a positive impact on the world this World Lion Day and beyond.

These words resonate deeply as we reflect on the importance of honesty, transparency, and compassion in our actions and beliefs. Meanwhile everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing themselves, their perspectives of living and commanding their beliefs on others life without respecting one another. Let us not overlook the power of personal growth and introspection in our quest for a better world. True change begins within each of us. 🌎 The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be. Let us strive to align our words with our actions, embodying the values of integrity and authenticity in all that we do. 💫 👀 Hypocrisy is the audacity to preach integrity from a den of corruption.

We stood and will always stand on the right side of history, realizing that love is love. 💕 I am proud to witness the groundbreaking decision allowing people of the same gender to marry in Aruba 🇦🇼 and Curaçao 🇨🇼. This ruling is a testament to the tireless efforts of activists and advocates who have fought for equality and justice for many like Mario Kleinmoedig, FOKO, Frank Holstag, Igualdat Kòrsou, Human Rights Caribbean Foundation, Fundacion Orguyo, the beloved couple Angel, but won't forget on a day like this legends like Felix de Rooy and my godfather Norman de Palm.🫰🏽 Those who taught me to stand proud and unapologetic in who we are as beings, embracing our true selves with courage and authenticity. ‼️ The freedom and rights of every individual must always come before any belief that breeds hatred or division among us. As the words of the Lord say: 'Who are we to judge another when we are all deserving of love and respect?'🏳️ 💪🏾 As politician but foremost a human rights activist, I am committed to pushing towards positive change and ensuring that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Let this victory make us continue to work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society for all. Together, let us embrace diversity, stand against discrimination, and champion love in all its forms. We are stronger when we lift each other up and celebrate the richness of our differences. 🙌🏾 Let us uphold the values of love, equality, and acceptance as we move forward towards a brighter and more inclusive future. 🌟🌈 #LoveIsLove #EqualityForAll #HistoryHasBeenMade 🏳️🌈 ×🐉✨ …” ― Gwendell Mercelina, Jr. © ________________ 📸 • @wenshow · · · ✅️ • #HumanRights • #YDK • #YearoftheDragon • #12July • #July12 • #Politics • #Politician • #HogeRaad • #Politico • #BanHendelKuGwendell • #MemberOfParliament • #ParliamentariansForGlobalAction • #Parlamentario • #ChampionsOfChange • #Inclusion • #Diversity • #FreedomFighters • #GwendellMercelina • #wenshow • #tenemiskèrpi • #Curaçao🇨🇼 • #gnius • #keepmesharp"
