Kwararafa quarters is situated in Makurdi township beside Atiku Abubakar road, a stone’s throw from Government House Makurdi, the Benue State capital\n\nHowever, the development of this housing estate was pioneered by the then-military Governor of Benue state, Colonel Abdullahi Shelleng under the military regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo (1976-1978). The foundation laying of the estate started in 1977 by Colonel Abdulahi Shelleng and the construction and development were completed and Commissioned in 1979 by the first executive Governor of Benue State, His Excellency, Aper Aku of blessed memory\n\nGovernor Aper Aku was a visionary leader whose blue print for the development of benue state still stands the taste of time\n\nNeed for Housing estates in Benue State\n\nBenue State was one of the 12 states in Nigeria created in 1976. As a result of state creation, the greater need for housing became eminent following the exit from Benue-Plateau State in 1976. Therefore, shelter development in Benue was designed to bridge the housing development need of civil servants and political appointees of Benue state and to accommodate the workforce, while the military officers remained in their barracks\n\nSubsequently, other housing estates were built after Kwararafa quarters: Lobi quarters, Minor quarters, Ankpa quarters, and Welfare quarters. The location upon which Kwararafa quarters were built is incredible; swampy, wetland, and green vegetation. This low-density housing estate is about 700m away from the bank of river Benue in Makurdi, close to the Old Bridge\n\nThis large expanse of land was dominated by timber and wetland. Our forebears told us that no one could ever imagine if such a decent estate would be constructed out of this unique terrain\n\nUntil the construction of this low-density estate in Makurdi, canoes from River Benue sailed to this destination due to the swampy nature and perennial flooding of River Benue\n\nKwararafa A.K.A Eight-Man Quarters\n\nThe architectural design of this low-density housing estate called Kwararafa Quarters is unique.

Once again, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo became President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1999-2007. He extended a kind gesture of owner-occupier housing. Therefore, following the privatization policy of the federal government in 2006, federal and state government housing estates were sold to active civil servants on an owner-occupier basis\n\nThis move by the federal and state governments was a paradigm shift to ownership of low-density housing estates in Nigeria and Benue State in particular. Furthermore, the government of Governor George Akume in 2006 issued the certificate of allocation of government-owned housing estates to deserving civil servants and political appointees on an owner-occupier basis.\n\nThis move by the Benue State government to allocate housing estates to its workforce is a milestone achievement, it created an ample opportunity for a sizable population of civil servants who worked meritoriously for the state to own a house in Benue state for the first time\n\nKwararafa Quarters Makurdi is now wearing a new look since prospective owners are allowed to give their houses a facelift.
