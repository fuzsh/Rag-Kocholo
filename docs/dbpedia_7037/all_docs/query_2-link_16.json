        "text": "“The list of the State offices among the Jukun Wapa of Wukari seemed inexhaustible. It is a clear indication that it was an elaborate political system that gave detail to virtually all aspect of political organization. With respect to the political system of the other Jukun chieftaincies, it was obvious that they were strikingly similar to that of Wukari but without the latter’s titles. Each had its chief surrounded by counselors comprising elders and religious dignitaries under an official equivalent to the Abo of Wukari. It was in this regard that C.K Meek concluded that the various Jukun groups were organized under a loosely knit confederacy composed of a number of semi-independent chiefdoms, the heads of which recognized the supremacy of the king of Kwararafa and later of Wukari.” [1] “The identification of Jukun, Apa, Kwana and Kwararafa goes back to at least the mid-nineteenth century, but modern Jukun have no memory of Kwararafa or a supposedly martial past, and Kwararafa invasions ended mysteriously in the seventeenth century. In the nineteenth, the Jukun lived, not in a unified kingdom, but in a number of small communities in the Benue valley. It is possible that Kwararafa was a generic name for non-Muslim peoples from Dar al-Harb, the Land of Unbelief. It may well have been a multi-ethnic federation, which acted together for specific purposes and then disbanded.” [2] “C.K. Meek suggested that the of political organization of the Jukun people of Wukari Division might be described as a theocracy, based on the conception that the king was the representative of the gods and the divinely appointed intermediary between them and the people. ‘It follows, therefore, that the Jukun system of government is in theory at least, of a highly despotic character. The king is supreme. His decisions have a divine authority and there is then no appeal. Before the advent of British Government, he had the power of life and death. As head of a spiritual principality, which included a number of nominally independent chiefdoms, he could order the deposition or execution of chiefs who disobeyed his behest.’ The Aku-Uka of Wukari, who is the supreme ruler of the Jukun people, exercised political cum religious influence on other Jukun communities, yet these Jukun communities maintained certain degrees of their uniqueness. In this sense, one could liken the political system that existed among the Jukun before the advent of Colonial rule to a confederal system.” [3] “Ministers were unable to make their offices hereditary; the only strictly hereditary offices in the Jukun constitution were cere- monial and priestly ones with minimal secular powers. Although some of the ministers were territorial chiefs economically independent of the king, their ad- ministrative ’ fiefs ’ were attached to their offices, so they were unable to claim lasting ties of personal allegiance from outlying parts of the state.” [4]\n\n[1]: Zhema, S.

That is to say that he was the representative of the people in their relations with the king, who was the representative of the gods. He was the king’s principal adviser, and had access to the king at any time. He reported matters of importance to the king on daily basis. He disposed of all judicial cases which did not require the king’s personal investigation. And when religious rites were due, the priests approached the Abo-Acio, who obtained the royal consent, together with the sacrificial gifts which the king was required to provide, and attended the rites which he reported back to the Aku. In short, the Abo-Acio was the very figure which the people had relationship with in terms of the political arrangement of the Jukun people. This explains the level of significance attached to the office of the Abo-Acio, in consonance with the sacred nature of the Aku-Uka, who was considered a semi god and should not be seen by ordinary people. […] Taking cognizance of the theocratic system of the administration, the priests constituted another important group of administrators within the Jukun political system. The Ku-Puje Acio with his assistant served as the Chief Priest of Puje, an important cult among the wapa Jukun. There was the Kenjo cult, the Yaku cult, the Achu-Nyande etc. Each of these cults had specific set of functions which they performed. For instance, the Achu-Nyande served a judicial function in the sense that, being a cult of lightning, rites were performed in cases of theft and was believed that lightning would strike the culprit.” [1] “Amongst the Ichen both temporal and spiritual affairs were in the hands of a Chief-priest assisted by a Council of Subordinate Priests. The Chief-priest suffered from severe limitations as a leader owing to the taboos to which he must subject. In some instances, the Chief-priests were not allowed to cross a stream, a taboo which // “fairly effectively confined them. The Chief-priest of Ndessin was not allowed to let any water touch his body except that which is actually falling in the form of rain. In this regard, it is evident that the political life of the Ichen people were regulated through the various cults, such as Achu Nyande, Gura. These cults were common amongst the other Jukun communities. This, in a way, established that religion played an important role in maintaining the primacy of the Aku’s position over the other Jukun communities. In this connection, the ensuing socio-politcal structures became similar to that which existed in Wukari.” [2] “The potential coercive use of his ritual powers by the king was considerably restricted by the existence of many other priestly offices and by the innumerable taboos which regulated his ritual behaviour. With regard to the former, the priests of the many cults were not deputies of the king, and their ritual authority and consequential prestige did not derive from him. This is illustrated by the injunctions which forbade the king to be present at the performance of rites other than those held in his own palace, and which forbade the king to meet certain priests face to face. His was the ultimate responsibility, however, for ensuring that appropriate rites were carried out at the customary times, and for directing the priests to co-operate on contingent occasions which required special rites. In this capacity the Aku was a high priest with a somewhat remote supervision of numerous ritual specialists. The distribution of ritual authority in the society together with the elaborate taboos of his office were the categorical checks on the king’s ritual power, which was thus in practice no more absolute than his political power.” [3]\n\n[1]: Zhema, S.

Not clear which role had authority over which other roles in all cases, as some parts of the administration were clearly hierarchical, while others had specific jurisdictions (and not always clear, significant administrative functions, rather than ceremonial). It’s also possible that the descriptions in these sources either miss some subaltern positions, or describe roles essentially on the same level as different. 1) Aku-Uka (divine king), 2) Abo-Acio (prime minister; kingmaker), 3) Abo-Zike (second most senior official; kingmaker), 4) Kinda-Acio (palace administrator; kingmaker), 5) Court of the Kinda-Acio, eg Kinda-Zike (his assistant; kingmaker), Kinda Bi, Kind Kuvyu Nju and Kinda Matswen, 6) Awei-Acio (chief of staff), 7) chief priests of cults (eg Ku-Puje Acio and assistant served as chief priest of Puje), 8) Aku-Ke (leader of war), 9) Tsuma (royal diviner), 10) Ivene (king’s spokesman), 11) Wanaku (head of agriculturalists), 12) Kuyu (representative of old Kwararafa royal family, Ba-Pi), 13) Abgyu-Tsi (queen), 14) Angwu Kaku (official sister of the king), 15) Wakuku (Aku’s principal wife), 16) Chiefs, 17) Counsellors (elders and religious dignitaries). Alternative spellings include Abon for Abo, and Achuwo for Acio. “The dangers of travelling during the rainy season, when the tsetse dispersed more widely over the country, were clearly appreciated, even if the role of the fly was not. In the 1850s, for example, a chief in the Jukun country refused to provide horses for the transport of a party of European explorers because ’the roads were wet . . . and horses would be killed by travelling along them in such weather’.” [1] “The process that usually led to the emergence of an Aku Uka was clearly defined. At the initial period, it was suggested that the Kuvyi (Chief) was the one that picked the Aku Uka, under the direction of spirit, whenever the stool became vacant.58 But over time, the four king makers who were Abon Acio, Abon Zike, Kinda Acio and Kinda Ziken became the central personalities in the selection of new Aku Uka. The king makers would inform the Kuvyi (Chief Priest) in the event of the demise of an Aku, while the Abon Acio held brief for who would eventually emerges as the Aku Uka. The four king makers were the ones left with the onerous task of driving the process that would eventually see to the emergence of Aku. Interested princess were invited from the ruling houses and interacted with. Preliminary screening was conducted on the prospective candidates by the king makers, after which a seer (Avun) was invited to select one out of the contenders. The Avun, who was believed to be in contact with the gods identified the most appropriate person that would become the Aku. Even then, the Avun was expected not to be partial in carrying out his function on the basis that there were sanctions that usually came to him in the event that he became bias. To be convinced with the selection by the Avun, another Seer, from a different place was normally invited in order to validate or otherwise the selection made by the Avun.” [2] “The Jukun kingdom appears to have had a very different structure from that of the Shilluk, though their respective kingships show some interesting similarities. The political segments of Wukari, the chiefdoms, were not organized on the basis of common descent. Descent groups (atsupa) were small and localized, perhaps a function of the abundance of agricultural land in the region.” [3] “The government of the state was conducted from the Aku’s palace in Wukari through a system of ranked offices. Broadly speaking, there were two main categories of officials: those holding civil or state titles whose function was to administer the state, prosecute war, and counsel the king; and those holding priestly and royal household titles whose functions were largely ritual and ceremonial. The former titles tended to be held by agnates of the king-his brothers and father’s brothers’ sons-while many of the royal household titles were held by his uterine relatives.” [3] “The senior counsellors or state officials, of which there were traditionally four or five, were usually close agnates of the king, and it was they who are said to have decided whether or when a king should be killed. One of these title-holders, the Kinda Achuwo or king’s official ’younger brother’, was even formally and ceremonially blamed for the king’s death-whether he had in fact been killed or not- at the installation of his successor. The hereditary king-maker, a purely ceremonial official, handed over the king-elect to the Kinda with the words:’ Formerly we gave you a king and you killed him when he fell sick. Let me never hear that you have treated this king in this way.’ The Abo Achuwo, by his very position as the king’s prime minister, was automatically implicated in the removal of a king. During the interregnum he ruled the state and took charge of the king’s property, while one of the king’s close attendants-usually a sister’s son-mounted the throne and im- personated the king to maintain the fiction that the king was still alive.” [4] “[T]he Aku-Uka, in a way did not directly and physically take part in the administration of the community in pre-colonial era. In this regard, he was surrounded by a council, which C.K Meek described as a patrician caste, and they were responsible for the day to day administration. At the head of the caste, was the Abo-Acio whose position and functions could be likened to a modern day Prime minister. The Abo-Acio was the // “channel of communication between the Aku-Uka and the people. The people had to get to the Aku-Uka through the Abo-Acio. That is to say that he was the representative of the people in their relations with the king, who was the representative of the gods. He was the king’s principal adviser, and had access to the king at any time. He reported matters of importance to the king on daily basis. He disposed of all judicial cases which did not require the king’s personal investigation. And when religious rites were due, the priests approached the Abo-Acio, who obtained the royal consent, together with the sacrificial gifts which the king was required to provide, and attended the rites which he reported back to the Aku. In short, the Abo-Acio was the very figure which the people had relationship with in terms of the political arrangement of the Jukun people. This explains the level of significance attached to the office of the Abo-Acio, in consonance with the sacred nature of the Aku-Uka, who was considered a semi god and should not be seen by ordinary people. The Abo-Acio was assisted by Abo-Zike in the discharge of his many functions, and succeeded the Abo-Acio in case of death or vacancy of the position. In this regard, the Abo-Zike became the second most senior official to the Abo-Acio. The next in the hierarchy was the kinda-Acio who was in charge of the administration of the palace and cared for the welfare of Aku’s premises. It was noted that this official was in the close counsels of the king, attended the royal rite each day, took a prominent share in judicial work, in keeping the walls of city and the fencing of the royal enclosure in repair, and could also be put in charge of military operation. He was said to be the younger brother of the Aku and had a court of his own which included Kinda-Zike (his assistant), Kinda Bi, Kind Kuvyu Nju and Kinda Matswen. The Abo-Acio, Abo-Zike, Kinda-Acio and Kinda-Zike constituted the traditional kingmakers among the Jukun Wapa, under the chairmanship of the Abo-Acio. This // “body and its functions could be likened to the Oyo-Mesi of the old Oyo Empire under the leadership of Bashrun. Besides the above mentioned officials, there were others particularly of high standing who were considered closed counsels of the Aku. Among this was the Awei-Acio who was the nominal head of all the palace staff, and thus correspond to modern day Chief of Staff. His duties included to see that the royal enclosure and the shrine of Yaku were kept in proper repair. He also oversaw many other staff in the palace administration. Taking cognizance of the theocratic system of the administration, the priests constituted another important group of administrators within the Jukun political system. The Ku-Puje Acio with his assistant served as the Chief Priest of Puje, an important cult among the wapa Jukun. There was the Kenjo cult, the Yaku cult, the Achu-Nyande etc. Each of these cults had specific set of functions which they performed. For instance, the Achu-Nyande served a judicial function in the sense that, being a cult of lightning, rites were performed in cases of theft and was believed that lightning would strike the culprit. Other officials in the political system of the Jukun Wapa were the Aku-Ke, who was the leader of war, while the royal diviner was known as the Tsuma. The king’s spokesperson was known as the Ivene, and the Wanaku was the official head of all agriculturalists. The Kuyu was the representative of the old royal family of Kwararafa. This family was known as the Ba-Pi, and has supplied several kings of Wukari. There were as well, other offices and officials such as Abgyu-Tsi, Angwu Kaku and Wakuku who were regarded as the queen, the official sister of the Aku and the Aku’s principal wife respectively. They all had share in the administration. The list of the State offices among the Jukun Wapa of Wukari seemed inexhaustible. It is a // “clear indication that it was an elaborate political system that gave detail to virtually all aspect of political organization. With respect to the political system of the other Jukun chieftaincies, it was obvious that they were strikingly similar to that of Wukari but without the latter’s titles.
