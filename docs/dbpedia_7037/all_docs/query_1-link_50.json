        "text": "JALINGO – The southern senatorial district of Taraba state comprising, Takum, Ussa, Donga,Ibi and Wukari local government area, is currently in a serious turmoil.\n\nWukari is the ancient Jukun Kingdom, which is the next largest town after Jalingo. It is approximately 310 kilometres away from Jalingo, the state capital with its paramount ruler,the Aku-Uka of Wukari Dr Shekarau Angyu Masa-ibi, Kuvyu ii, who is also the chairman Taraba state council of chiefs.\n\nHe is the only ruler in the whole northern part of Nigeria who gave his children the leverage to practise any religion of their choice even though he not a Muslim\n\nThe Aku-Uka once told our correspondent in an exclusive interview that Wukari is blessed with fertile and accommodating people.\n\nOne then wonders why Wukari is currently enmeshed in violence inspire of its remarkable assessment by the monarch.\n\nOn 31stMarch,this year, a Tiv young lad went to a market in Wukari local government and drove all the Tiv women that displayed their wares for sale.\n\nHe premised his action on the fact their women cannot sale their wares to the people that connived with the Fulani.All attempts to make him understand that his allegations were baseless and unfounded fell on deaf ears as he returned the following day and ferociously drove the victims away.\n\nHe was eventually caught and handed over to the police in Kente,after he earlier resisted the move by those whose preventing him to escalate the crisis beyond proportion.\n\nIn retaliation, Tiv youths at Gbeji in Benue State took hostage a Jukun man with his Pick-up Van, simultaneously at Afyakot in same Benue.They also held 16 Jukun women carrying out their business.\n\nThe ransome was to trade with the Tiv boy in police custody with the others in their custody. It took the intervention of the DPO at Gbeji and the Army captain at Kente for that deal to be struck .\n\nThe crisis continued unabated as all peace meetings held to proffer solution to the lingering crisis proved abortive.\n\nOur correspondent reports that both Taraba and Benue state governments have summoned stakeholders meetings where agreement was reached between the warring parties to sheath their swords.\n\nRegrettably,what that started from Kente ward in Wukari has escalated to other local governments of the southern Taraba with little or no hope of unearthing the dramatis personae in the crisis\n\nChidonku Amajiken, a member of Wukari local government, wondered why the crisis has remained unabated.\n\nHe asked:”For God’s sake what are the Tiv/ Jukun fighting for? For how long will this fight continue? Who is behind this crisis? It appears there are some entrepreneurs of insecurity who specialised in trading with this type of crisis because they are feeding fat from it, yes the drummers are behind bedding drums for the two groups to keep killing each other for them to keep benefiting from it.To me ,I thought with the recent peace meeting between the warring parties mid-wife by the federal government everything should be let to rest but to my greatest surprise the opposite is the case as killing is still on the Tiv’s are insisting on having their 10 points agenda implemented which includes the creation of a chiefdom purely for the Tivs which to the Jukun is not achievable.\n\n“If that is done, will they be answerable to the Aku- Uka in Taraba or the Tor Tiv in Benue? Above all, the Tor Tiv himself who is even a Professor during the meeting in Abuja started it categorically that the Tivs in Taraba state are answerable to him traditionally and that contradicts their agitation for a chiefdom in Taraba State, are they the only tribes in the southern zone of Taraba? We have the Igalas, the Idomas, the Igedes who are even from the Kwararafa kingdom but they never clamour for creation of their chiefdom why Tivs? Also, they raised issue of indigenship that they are being denied indigene certificate, which to me is not true, for if they have been denied indigeneship how did they get to the top of government position and admission into institution of higher learning as Tarabans. How manage they became commissioners, permanent secretary and even the clerk of the State House of Assembly is a Tiv man, so what are they saying? They say they are indigene of Taraba especially from the southern zone, if really, they are, will they clamour for relocation of the federal university Wukari to another place just as they did in a press conference in Jalingo? Relocating the federal university to where?\n\n“After a recent meeting in Abuja the Tiv Youth Organization called for the impeachment of governor Darius Ishaku for a reason best known to them, if governor Darius was to be impeached today will a Tiv man become the governor of the state or will Samuel Ortom of Benue state over-see Benue and Taraba? He should be impeaching on what ground? “\n\nAlso speaking, Terkibi Samuel David, a Tiv man,who grew up in Donga local government area of the state, expressed worry over the issue of indigeneship, maintaining that the Jukun people in that axis tagged them as settlers,\n\nThe chairman Wukari local government area, Hon. Daniel Adi said his council in conjunction with security apparatus have intervened to see that permanent peace is restored to the area.\n\nHe said: ” We have been able to address the situation by talking to our youths on the need for them to give peace. We have also planned to organise a peace concert where the youth will be sensitized. They just have to cooperate with the governor, who is from the southern zone to actualise his rescue mission.\n\nThe branch chairman of Wukari chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN),Rev. Bulus Gani,decried the crisis,saying there was no reason why it shouldn’t be nipped in the bud.\n\nHe said CAN has summoned peace meeting between clergies of Tiv and the Jukun, protected the NKST Church which is the native church of Tiv in Wukari, as well as resorted to spiritual intervention to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe hope of bringing lasting peace to bear between the warring groups appear dimmer following the recent killing of Rev Father Tanko David, a Jukun clergy,who was one of the leading advocates of peace in the area.\n\nThe vice chancellor of the Federal University Wukari, Professor Abubakar Musa Kundiri, has appealed to the warring factions to sheath their swords\n\nOur correspondent reports that that though Governor Daius Ishaku, is determined to bring lasting peace to Taraba State, there are seems to be some unseen forces,who are bent on making the salutary mission impossible."
