        "text": "Ibi\n\nNigeria\n\nIbi, town and river port, Taraba state, east-central Nigeria, on the south bank of the Benue River, opposite the mouth of the Shemankar River. Founded in the 1850s by a slave of Hamman, the Fulani emir of Muri (to the northeast), it became a post for slave traders from Muri, known as the bayin Fulani. In the late 19th century British merchants of the Royal Niger Company observed Ibiâ€™s Hausa traders marketing tin products and thereupon prospected for and found in 1904 the vast tin deposits on the Jos Plateau.\n\nIbi is a collecting point for sesame seeds and soybeans. Salt extraction, a traditional occupation of the women in the vicinity, has been eclipsed by imported European salt. Local trade among the mostly Jukun population is in sorghum, millet, yams, rice, and beans. It serves as the port for Wukari 23 miles (37 km) south, to which it is linked by road. Pop. (2006) local government area, 84,054.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy McKenna."
