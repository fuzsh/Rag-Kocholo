        "text": "Nigeria lost one of its most revered traditional rulers, the Aku Uka of Wukari Shekarau Angyu Masa-Ibi Kuvyon II who passed on recently in Wukari, Taraba State at the age of 84. The Aku Uka was Chairman of the Taraba State Council of Traditional rulers and was one of the country’s longest serving monarchs.\n\nThe late Aku Uka was not only the traditional ruler of Wukari but also the nominal ruler of the Jukun ethnic group and descendants of the Kwararafa Kingdom of antiquity, who are found not only in Taraba State but in a number of states in central and parts of northeast of Nigeria.\n\nAku Uka Shekarau ascended the throne in 1976 in succession to Malam Ada Ali and went on to rule for 45 eventful years.\n\nAt the time of his ascendance, Wukari was in the defunct Gongola State. with the creation of Taraba state in 1991, he became its highest ranking traditional ruler.\n\nAku Shekarau’s influence grew beyond Taraba State and he became one of the foremost traditional rulers in the North. As a symbol and custodian of one of the respected traditional stools, he was rightfully regarded as both a spiritual and cultural icon of the Jukuns, one of the great indigenous peoples of the country.\n\nAku Shekarau was a repository of the history and traditions of his people and their relationship with other ethnicities in Nigeria. He was often consulted by governments and other organizations on some of the knotty inter-ethnic issues that come up periodically in the country. He belonged to the group of traditional rulers in the country who are revered and respected even by their peers and government alike for their historical status and what they represent.\n\nThe late Aku Shekarau was at different times Chancellor of the University of Ilorin as well as Federal Universities in Akure, Ondo State, Dutse in Jigawa State and Lafia in Nasarawa State.\n\nDuring his long reign, the ancient town of Wukari witnessed tremendous transformation. The town expanded both in population and size, becoming the second largest in Taraba State after the state capital, Jalingo. from having no tertiary institution when he first ascended the throne in 1976, Wukari now boasts of two universities, one federal government and one privately owned.\n\nAku Shekarau’s reign also witnessed some low moments. The perennial Tiv/Jukun crises came up several times resulting in loss of lives and destruction of property. Sectarian crises between the Aku’s Jukun Christian and Muslim subjects also resulted in loss of lives and destruction of whole areas of the town. The scars of these are still visible.\n\nAll through these the late Aku Shekarau, who was himself personally affected, preached peaceful coexistence among his subjects and neighbouring Tiv communities. He was always ready to initiate and work with government and humanitarian organizations in efforts to find lasting solutions to the crises that periodically engulfed the area.\n\nFor his commendable role as custodian of our cherished culture, tradition and promotion of peaceful coexistence in Jukun land and beyond, Nigeria will surely miss the late Aku Uka Shekarau Angyu Masa-Ibi. May his great soul rest in peace."
