        "text": "Three persons have reportedly been killed in a clash between Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups in Taraba state.\n\nBoth groups share a common boundary in not Just Taraba but Benue state.\n\nA resident said some persons were killed while several houses set ablaze in Dananacha town, Gassol local government area of Taraba on Wednesday.\n\nHe said some elders from both ethnic groups later reconciled the aggrieved youth but a fresh round of crisis broke out on Thursday.\n\nOne of the reasons for the violence is the change of the townâ€™s name from Dananacha to Kwararafa, according to a community source.\n\nDananacha town has been reportedly divided into three; with some part being controlled by Jukun, while the two parts are controlled by the Tiv and Hausa-Fulani ethnic groups.\n\nDavid Misal, spokesman of the Taraba police command, confirmed the latest violence but said the police had restored normalcy in the area.\n\nIn a bid to find solution to the lingering crisis between both groups, Darius Ishaku, governor of Taraba, recently established the judicial commission of inquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate causes of the crisis between the Tivs and Jukuns.\n\nBut the Tivswithdrew from the commission, saying they were in doubt of the sincerity of the panel sitting in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nOver the years, the deaths caused by the crisis between both groups have been on the rise."
