        "text": "Ishaku Mourns\n\nBy Wole Ayodele\n\nThe Chairman of Taraba Council of Traditional Rulers and paramount ruler of the Jukun race, Dr Shekarau Angyu Masa Ibi, Kuvyo II (CON), has joined his ancestors.\n\nIn a statementll signed by the Special Adviser on Media to the late monarch, Jolly Agbu Masa-Ibi, the Aku Uka died in his palace at Wukari at the age of 84 after ruling the Jukun race for 45 years.\n\nAccording to the statement, all traditional rites in accordance with the Jukun tradition has since commenced, while the final traditional rites for Aku Uka’s transition from the palace to Puje would be announced in due course.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Darius Ishaku has expressed shock and sadness over the passing of the supreme ruler of the Jukuns, who he described as a foremost traditional ruler whose reign brought peace, unity and prosperity to Wukari and the entire ancient Kwararafa kingdom in general.\n\nGovernor Ishaku further described the Aku Uka’s reign as a period of self discovery by the Jukun people of their strategic place in history and role in the promotion of modern civilisation in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nThe governor noted that Masa-Ibi was a leader with a rare sense of history and praised him for his immense contributions to the documentation of the historic contributions of the Jukun and the entire Kwararafa people to the emergence of modern nations in Africa and Nigeria in particular.\n\nLamenting the passing of the monarch, Ishaku stressed that his demise at this point in time has robbed Taraba State and Nigeria of the benefits of his wise counsel which he offered very generously in his personal capacity and as chairman of the Taraba State Council of Chiefs just as he prayed God for the repose of his soul."
