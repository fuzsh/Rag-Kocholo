        "text": "World War 3, the final clash of civilizations, is unavoidable and near, the question is whether the Original Indigenous African civilization, especially its most populous groups, Yoruba and Igbo will survive culturally?\n\nThere is no way that France will not fight to regain its African colonies that are at the foundation of their modern economy like Niger’s Uranium, Mali’s Gold etc,. And, their fellow African colonial powers, UK and USA will be dragged into the war, as an extension to the Ukraine War where they are fighting together as NATO. The US has moved its military infrastructure to nearby Accra, while a British Warship just berthed on the Nigerian coast. Thanks to David Hundeyi’s expose that has delayed Nigeria’s involvement, making the West turn to Benin Republic and instigating military coups in the meantime. Also, it’s unlikely that Russia won’t push further to take other African nations, like they armed African independence fighters after the Second World War.\n\nThe Third World War is an organic progression from the First World War, initially called the War for Colonies, since it was launched by Germany against France following its poor pickings in the Scramble for African territory. It became a truly world war when the European war that started on July 28 1914 led to the British and French invasion of German colonies of Togo and Cameroon on August 5th 1914. German lost World War and it’s few African colonies were split by British and French, so it relaunched World War Two that it also lost.\n\nGoing further back, the first Ukraine-Crimean War of 1853-1856 was over the Islamic Ottoman Empire waged by Britian, France, Islamic Ottoman Empire and USA against Russia in which Russia lost. Despite fighting in support of Ottoman Empire, the French and British took over Ottoman Empire North African and Arabia territories, so when Germany launched a war for colonies against France, the Islamic Ottoman Empire aligned with Germany. With their defeat, just as Germany lost it’s few African colonies, so did Ottoman Empire lose North Africa and Arabia to the French and British.\n\nOnce again, the battle lines are also drawn across the Afroasiatic Islamic civilization, with its African leadership, the Fulani Sunni dynastic leadership, in cahoots with the Western imperialists. The recent Sahel army coups against neocolonist puppet governments was agitated by the Fulani herdsmen and Islamic terrorists killing thousands across West Africa. Russia has backed the Sahel armies that have the support of Hausas, the largest Afroasiatic group, and other full Black Afro-Arabians that have become the poverty capital of the word. A war for the French and Western Powers led by Nigeria with it’s Fulani leadership is bound to agitate Hausas to push for Shia type of cleric meritocratic leadership, especially influenced by Russia’s traditional ally, Iran whose Shia leanings are against Islamic Sunni dynasties.\n\nWith the larger fraction of the Afro-Arabic masses aided by Russia, Iran, Algeria, China etc against the Western Powers, there is a likelihood that the Western backed African recolonizing army is routed. Another likely scenario is that the North hemisphere is engulfed in a nuclear holocaust, preventing both sides from supplying weapons to the Africa war, which will swing the balance to Algeria that is far more equipped than Nigeria. With the Europeans out of the way like after independence, the Afro-Arabians backed by Algerians will not stop at routing the Nigerian Afro-Arabic leadership but will strategically want to run over the rest of Nigeria. Therefore, the Original African civilization that are 70% majority in Nigeria, but divided and civilizational derailed tribes, must unite from their Middlebelt Original African civilizational frontiers to repel the Afroasiatic civilizational imperialistic advance. Otherwise, disunited the Original African ethnicities would fall one a piece, first the Middlebelt, then Yorubaland that would be broke up with religious war, then Igbos and Deltans minorities that won’t want Igbo dominance.\n\nOriginal African ethnicities should do away with Tribal exceptionalism especially Yorubas and Igbos. I once heard a few Igbos boast that Ndigboland couldn’t have lost their lands to Fulani Afroasiatic cultural imperialism like Yorubas lost Ilorin and had Oyo empire fall, but they don’t understand the cultural geography. Little do Yorubas and Igbos know that without the cultural buffer zone of the Middlebelt indigenous African population, the South would have been overran centuries ago and lost it’s indigenous cultural identity, like many Original indigenous Africans of the North became Afroasiatic. The greatest impediment to this strategic understanding is the colonial balkanization of the Original African civilization into Tribalistic perspectives. It is pertinent that the Yorubas and Igbos wake up to this fact as we approach the predicted Final Conflict between civilizations, otherwise for the lack of knowledge, a people shall perish.\n\nInfact the 1967 Civil War was the first Civilizational War when the Afro-Arabic civilization that was handed power by the British tried to take total Islamic civilizational control of Nigeria by removing the Ooni of Ife, the Original African civilization leader as Governor of the Western Region, and jailed the Yorubas political leader Obafemi Awolowo. The Afro-Arabic civilizational power in control of the center, severed remaining links with the British by declaring a republic in 1963 to prevent the case from being heard in British Supreme Court and helping the Original African civilization.\n\nTherefore on January 15th 1966, the Original African civilization soldiers were backed by the British to overthrow the Afro-Arabic government, which was reversed with the July 29th 1966 countercoup. With the federal capital in Yorubaland, the British used the French and other Europeans partners in the Vietnam War, to arm Biafra for a secessionist war until the North acquiesced to share power with the British. Despite some of the Igbos soldiers claiming they wanted to handover to Awolowo and the Original African civilization, unfortunately, the disparate Original African civilizational groups had their worldview colored with colonially inspired Pan Tribalistic perspectives that prevented them from fully understanding the import of the war. Seeing it as a self-centered tribal Igbo war instead of a civilizational war to prevent Islamization.\n\nNigeria and Africa as a whole is made up of two civilizations – Original African civilization that share common genetic and cultural origins (Yoruba, Igbo, Deltans, Middlebelt, Central, East and South Africans) and the Afroasiatic civilization that are products of different waves of Asiatic cultural imperialism (Hausa, Fulani, Amhara Ethiopians etc). DNA and linguistic evidence shows that humanity evolved from the Southern Coast of Nigeria where the first language family – Volta-Niger ethnolinguistic subfamily (Yoruba, Igala, Igbo, Ijaw etc) evolved in the rainforests. After thousands of years, Indigneous Africans spread to the confluence of Rivers Niger and Benue, where the Benue-Congo ethnolinguistic subfamily (Bantus) evolved. The Benue-Congo subfamily spread across Northern Nigeria as the Nok civilization and into Lake Chad as the Sao Civilization, before spreading down the River Chari and River Sangha to the Kongo River basin as Western Bantus and up River Ugbagi to the Great Lakes Area, East and Southern Africa. Indigneous Africans crossed over from Ethiopia to the Arabia peninsula, keeping to the coast until they got to Iraq, Iran, India and spreading civilizational outposts to China and Polynesia.\n\nAs the universe would have it, the Black civilizations were to be attacked and annihilated by previous Indigenous Africans, who had earlier migrated and caught out in the Ice Age about 50,000yrs ago, surviving in the Asian cave mountain complex where they lost their skin color. The light skinned Asiatics were to back up all the Black indigenous African civilizations from South China, Indus Valley and ancient Egypt towards their source. With the Euroasian and Afroasian takeover from Original Indigenous African leadership of Egypt, the quest continued with the aid of Abrahamic dogma and herdsmen to find the source and heartland of the Original African civilization. From Egypt and Libya, they headed south across the desert to Lake Chad that was under the Sao Original African civilization.\n\nThe Original indigenous Africans, labeled Jukun meaning people in Afroasiatic Hausa or Original African names like Apa, that inhabited around the Lake Chad retreated back from Ngarazamu into the Gongola River Basin, where they formed the Kwararafa Confederacy of various groups to stop the advance of the Afroasians through Bornu Empire. If they hadn’t, the Afro-Arabians would have got to Ndigboland and the Niger Delta Coast.\n\nThe westward spread of Asiatics on the North African coast, as they took over Original African tradeposts from Egypt to Libya to Carthage (Tunisia) and finally to Morocco, resulted in the Afro-Arabic population and area of influence shift from Bornu to Senegambia and Futa Jallon. With the European, a Eurasiatic subgroup that share the same Abrahamic dogma, taking over Ceuta Morocco in 1415, led to the Fulani and other Afro-Arabians move towards the source and core of the Original African civilization in Nigeria. Unlike the Bornu Islamists that came from Lake Chad, the Senegambian Afroasians came down the River Niger, inflitrating Hausaland, Nupeland and further downstream formed Borgu, a Fulani subgroup, next to Yorubas Oyo Empire. By 1430, they had taken over the rulership of Kano, Daura by 1490s and by 1530 the Nupe drove Oyo Court to Igboho, sandwiched and infiltrated by the Borgu.\n\nOver the next few centuries, the Afro-Arabic civilization made cultural imperialistic advances into the Original African territory. To complicate the regional issues, the advent of European slave trade and arms, led to the beginning of the derailment of the Original African civilization, like it did to the Roman Catholic civilization, as tribal groups armed themselves to become kingdoms. Oyo expanded its citystate into an empire to the coast to control the slave and arms trade. The Edo and Igala also sought weapons to expand their area of influence and control of the Niger River. Igbos Nri civilizational structures were destroyed, influencing Ndigbos spread towards the coast to start the Arochukwu Confederacy for slaves.\n\nWith the loss of the Americas to take slaves, starting with post-Napoleon France in 1819, Europeans turned to colonization, the slaving of Africans on African soil to produce their raw materials and become a dumping ground for their manufactures. For colonization to work long term beyond military takeover, Europeans began a process of epistemicide through which they derailed the civilizational worldview of indigenous Africans with the bastardization of indigenous African traditional information systems, replacing it with Pan Tribalistic perspectives. To balkanize the Original African civilization that was a continuum of dialects with common genetic and cultural origins, they choose a dialect out of each subregion to become the standard language of their colonial social construct known as a tribe.\n\nDuring colonization, they broke up the Original African civilization first by amalgamating its northern territories, the Kwararafa Confederacy, known as the Middlebelt to the Northern Protectorate in 1914. Afterwards they divided the Southern Protectorate of the Original African civilization into East and West regions in 1939. This divided the pro-independence movement that crystallized in Lagos with the unity of Herbert Macaulay and Nnamidi Azikwe, who were both universalists. At the death of Macaulay, Awolowo and other Yorubas tied the movement to cultural origins while Azikwe remained a universalist Pan Africanist. The power tussle between the two most populous Original African groups, Yoruba and Igbo, made Azikwe unite across civilizational lines with the minority Northern Afroasians, empowering them to dream of taking over the whole civilization. While the North Afro-Arabic civilizationists found a Yoruba, Akintola to push their civilizational takeover, it was the Igbo soldiers and a few Yorubas that took the challenge to save the Original African civilization by overthrowing the Afro-Arabic government in January 1966.\n\nNow in the 2020s, the South and Middlebelt civilizational sociopolitical leadership of SMBLF made up of Afenifere, Ohaneaze, Middlebelt Forum and Pandef, backed Peter Obi, an Igbo as presidential candidate based on the notion of cultural justice through rotational presidency. However, the Western Powers supported Tinubu, a Yoruba Jagaban military commander of Fulani subgroup Borgu, with the hope of him leading a slave army to reclaim French territories lost to Russians. The problem is that a war to reclaim French Sahel overlooks the divisions within the Afroasiatic civilization, which has made them think maybe Atiku, a Fulani, would have been a better option to lead the war.\n\nEven if the Fulani leadership are in support of the war, the Afro-Arabic masses, especially the Hausa are against military war against their Niger cousins. If the Hausa and Afro-Arabic masses defeat or topple their Fulani leadership, it would mean that they have openly opted for civilizationalism over and above Nigerian nationalism, used by the Presidency to take Nigeria into war regardless of the imperialist bent. This would leave no rational or legitimate reason apart from Afro-Arabic civilizational imperialism to try to takeover the Nigerian nation. This would result in a war that would break up the two African civilizations into nationstates. In the case of a civilizational war the Original African civilization must draw it’s civilizational lines at Southern Kaduna, otherwise failure to stop the takeover of the nationstate from Abuja through war means the Original African civilization within Nigeria has effectively being captured by Afro-Arabic civilization through an act of war. The Yorubas need the Gwari and other Original Africans to break the supply line of Sokoto-Nupe-Kwara.\n\nThe only way the Original African civilization will survive is by uniting to present a common front against other civiliations that would enable us achieve global parity and play our role in the new world order of a multi-polar world. The logical peaceful way is for the Original African civilization to share power with the Afro-Arabic civilization. However, the myopic tribal perspectives and rivalry between the two most populous and prosperous Original African ethnicities, Yoruba and Igbo, must stop and they must unite Middlebelt and Deltan groups to save their civilization."
