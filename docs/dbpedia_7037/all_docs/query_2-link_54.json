        "text": "In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that this is not a post so much as a rant. And since the feedback I got on the last post (shout out to Oma) was that it was perhaps a tad too long (although I would like to see anyone compress over a thousand years of history into a 750- word blog post), this is going to be significantly shorter, mostly because of the lack of information on the subject matter.\n\nWho are the Kwararafa? This maddening question is one that I have been seeking answers to since Mrs. Opara mentioned the word in passing in my SS2 History class, the woman did not like the bedevilling she had to endure from me for the rest of the year that’s for sure. Information on the nature of the state (if indeed it was a state) or the alliance known as Kwararafa (alternatively, Kororofa, Kona and Kwana) is extremely scarce. No one knows, for example; what structure the state took, or its size or its organization, or what the rulers of the state were called. We can only even guess the tribe that most likely was the most dominant in the Empire – the Jukun. It’s almost enough to make a person pull their hair out one strand at a time. If it wasn’t for the records of others, Borno Empire and the Hausa states mostly, we wouldn’t even know for sure that something call Kwararafa ever existed. Okay, rant semi-over (I might forget myself and slip back into it again), here is what we do in fact know about the Kwararafa.\n\nKwararafa was most likely a multi-ethnic state or confederacy along the Benue river, that extended (probably) from today’s Middle-Belt to present South East and South-South Nigeria. It was located south of Borno Empire and the Hausa states, from where the Kwararafa raided those powerful states from time to time. The Kwararafa rose to prominence sometime before the 15th century, they were in conflict with some of the most powerful states of the time through to the 17th century and they fell into decline sometime in the 18th century.\n\nAs I said earlier, Kwararafa was either a loosely allied confederacy or a caste led state bent on conquest led by the Jukun (some say a Priest-Kingship based in Wukari was the center of Kwararafa). It could also have been a name bestowed on a number of “pagan” enemies by the Muslim states they attacked often. Leo Africanus (my guy!) noted that sometime towards the end of the 15th century, Borno attacked Kwararafa territory, this was likely before or during the reign of Mai Idris Alooma so the Borno Army was going through one of its stronger periods. However, the Kwararafa were able to successfully resist that army, among other reasons, because of their strong horse cavalry. According to the Kano Chronicles and other Hausa sources, Kwararafa attacked and conquered several Hausa states; Kano, first around 1600, then again mid-century and yet again in 1671, Katsina was assaulted, Zaria was sacked and the Kwararafa turned their attention to Borno, getting close to the Empire’s capital Ngazagamu before suffering a crushing defeat from Borno under Mai Ali ibn Umar.\n\nRegardless of the semi-constant state of warfare at the time, the Kwararafa were greatly respected by their neighbours. Borno set up an embassy in Kwararafa as did most of the Hausa states. Surprisingly, in spite of being near inundated by their Muslim neighbours, the Kwararafa remained steadfastly, unbendingly pagan even after they lost almost all their political and military strength and declined, almost into oblivion. By the end of the 18th century, the Kwararafa paid tribute to Borno. By the end of the 19th, they had been reduced to small towns and villages individually resisting the jihad of the Sokoto Caliphate.\n\nA successor to the Kwararafa is (probably) the Wukari Federation with it priest leadership feared (and so left alone) by its neighbours more and less powerful. It was established around 1840 and is in existence (in one form or the other) till this very day.\n\nSo, I hear that there is a university called Kwararafa University in Wukari. This is good news. So guys, might I suggest that you please do some research goddammit and tell us all there is to know about the Kwararafa; who they are, what they stood for or against, how they lived, so that we can all know and hair everywhere will be safe from the frustration that leads to us pulling our own hair out. Just a suggestion.\n\nIf you know more about the Kwararafa, please feel free to share. We could all use the knowledge, and my hair thanks you in advance.

In this decade, it is famous for the extremist group Boko Haram and its relative backwardness to the rest of Nigeria in terms of health care, education, infrastructure, quality of living etcetera. But it has not always been so. North eastern Nigeria is home to one of the earliest states that formed in the region now known as Nigeria, certainly one of the most powerful empires of all time in Africa. The Kingdom, and later Empire, of Kanem. Later on, it would be known as the Borno Empire, or the Kanem-Borno empire. As early as the eight century (701-800 B.C) the outside world (Arab geographers) noted Kanem as a very important state. At the height of the Kanem-Borno Empire, its vast territories extended to parts of modern day Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria, with a land mass of over 480,000 square kilometres. That’s twice the size of the United Kingdom. Twice. Another important thing is that for most of its existence, the Empire was ruled by the Bani Saif family, the Saifawa Dynasty. The death of Mai Ali in 1846 brought to an end the Saifawa rule that had lasted over a thousand years. But the state held on.\n\nThe first settlement of Kanem developed around the bed of Lake Chad. Geographically, it was perfect because as the Lake (not the Lake Chad we know today, but the Mega-Chad that shrunk several centuries ago) slowly dried, people could settle there and the land was fertile for farming, hunting and fruit gathering. Different groups settled in the area; the Kanuri, the Teda, the Berbers, the Tembu, the Zaghawa among others. The Zaghawa became the dominant group and managed to bring the various groups together to form one kingdom, the Kingdome of Kanem. They adopted the Kanuri language (some scholars suggest as a reason the fact that the Kanuri were the most populous groups) and the Kanuri culture evolved to reflect the identity of the others as well. What developed became, effectively, a fusion culture.\n\nThe first ruler of the Kingdom is probably Sayf b. dhi yazan sometimes called or spelled Sef or Saif. He became the first Mai of Kanem and one of his first official tasks was to make Kanuri the official language of the Kingdom and encourage it’s use in his court and among the people. He also converted to Islam, sometime in 1086. As one of the earliest converts to Islam in the area, he was able to position the state as the focus of Muslim influence in the area. The first Mai also established the capital of his Kingdom as Njimi.\n\nAnother early Mai of great significance was Mai Dunama Dibbalemi. Between the reign of the first Mai and Dibbalemi, the Kingdom had grown into a massive empire with all the power and reputation that that entailed. Dibbalemi took it further. He extended the boundaries of the Kingdom form the Niger to the Nile. His cavalry was supposedly 40,000 horsemen strong and while we do not have exact or approximate figures for his navy, that was strong as well. It was not all sunshine and rainbows though, the Empire was challenged internally by the Bulala and the Tubu, but Dibbalemi managed it all. With his death the empire was thrown into chaos. There was a seeming never ending succession dispute which the enemies of the Empire both within and without did not fail to exploit.\n\nThe following 140 years was like a never-ending Game of Thrones; assassinations, fratricide, strife, overambitious nobles amongst others led to several civil wars and compounded the problem with the Bulala. The wars cut off Kanem’s contact with the outside world and weakened the state. The Bulala killed Mai Daud and five of his successors. The third of these Mai Umar b Idris (who ruled between 1386/7 and 139/1) on the advice of the Ulama abandoned Njimi and Kanem and moved the Seifawa to Kaga in Borno and still the Bulala pursued him there. And through all this, the civil war continued.\n\nMai Ali, known as Mai Ali Gaji (Ali the small) brought an end to the civil war by driving out or killing all the other claimants in true Game of Throne style. He consolidated the Empire and built a new capital at Ngazargamu (or Birni Gazargamu, depending on who you’re reading). He defeated the Bulalas and ensured stability of his Kingdom. His son Idris b. Ali known as Idris Katagamarbe was a worthy successor who also defeated the Bulala Sultan and re-entered Njimi 122 years after the Seifawas fled, Kanem then became a province of Borno. Borno-Bulala relations at the time became a standing joke. A new Mai would ascend the throne, the Bulala would attack, the new Mai would counter and win, a peace treaty would be signed, it would last the reign of the Mai and the cycle would repeat itself all over. Only after Idris Alooma’s decisive victories later in the century would the Bulala situation change.\n\nMai Idris Alooma learnt to rule from his mother, the Maghira or regent, who ruled until he became old enough to take the throne. She saved his life twice, when her powerful brother and powerful father tried to murder the boy Mai and take the throne for themselves. A brave warlike man, Idris Alooma recovered lost territories and greatly expanded his Empire. He was also proficient in foreign relations, maintaining diplomatic and commercial ties with neighbours far and near; as far as Europe even. He also oversaw civil, religious, economic and military reforms that made for a more efficient and better run state as well as positioned his Empire to be the most powerful in the area for some time to come. It is a widely held (and justifiable) belief that Idris Alooma took the Kanem-Borno Empire to its highest point. Idris Alooma (who deserves his own post) died in 1608 and the empire started declining soon afterwards, although the cracks didn’t show for quite a while.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the Empire’s army had become so weakened that they could not carry out their primary duty of defending the empire. The ruling Mai, Mai Ahmed had to turn to outside help. The man he chose was a leading Islamic scholar of Kanembu parentage, Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi ibn Muhammad Fahi. When the Felata attacked Ngazargamu, Ahmed sent to Al-Kanemi who responded and soundly defeated Gwoni Mukhtar’s forces and killed Mukhtar himself. Shortly after, another Felata would be King Ibrahim Zaki attacked and with Al-Kanemi’s help was defeated. A third Felata attack by Gwoni Mukhtar’s son Muhammad Manga was also defeated with Al-Kanemi’s help. Al-Kanemi was gifted with money, cattle, slaves and most importantly land. The Mai who succeeded Ahmad, Mai Dunama was not settled in one place or a particularly strong leader so Al-Kanemi and his land became the political center of Borno.\n\nOpposition to Dunama’s rule and a palace revolt led to his deposition and the ascendance of Muhammadu Ngileruma. The new Mai established a new capital in Birnin Jadid and tried to curb Al-Kanemi’s powers. He was, however, compelled (by his own soldiers’ sheer ineptitude among other things) to employ al-Kanemi and his soldiers and the Empire’s defence. From this position, al-kanemi deposed Ngileruma and re-instated Dunama, effectively as a puppet ruler. Then he deposed the second most powerful office in Borno, the Galadima (two Galadimas in a row actually) and moved the office closer to himself for more efficient supervision. When Dunama died in battle, al-Kanemi installed Dunama’s younger brother Ibrahim, striking a seal in his own name; in effect assuming all the powers of government. A new dynasty was born.\n\nShehu Al-Kanemi neutralized all major threats to Borno, rebuilt and reformed the entire state, positioning it as one of the greatest states of its time. He might not have been what was best for the Seifawa Dynasty but he proved to be what was best for the state.\n\nUnfortunately, a succession of weak leaders, powerful and greedy advisors weakened the state and led to its rapid decline. The French and British then had a field day decimating what was once a great Empire. The British won and by the turn of the century in 1902, they had occupied Borno, renaming it British Borno.\n\nThis is by no means a detailed account of one of the greatest Empires Africa has ever know, in fact, I barely skimmed the surface. So feel free to read more on the subject or ask me anything in the comments.

They will probably always remain a major aspect of our lives for even today when most of us either worship the Nazarene or follow the teachings of the Prophet, we still honour the ancestors in one way or the other. In the days gone by, not only were the ancestors honoured, their spirits were worshipped as mankind’s link to the realm of the gods. Theirs was not the only spirit thus revered. Others were also worshipped, honoured and feared. Perhaps one of the greatest of these were the Leopard spirits. The leopard was seen as a great animal, mysterious and invincible, so great prestige was accorded to the Leopard. It’s spirit also, was granted many powers and attributes. Following this train of thought, it is probably easy to see why the people chose to venerate the Leopard. Many groups and societies were established to do just that but one group achieved more than the rest. The Ekpe Society.\n\nThe Ekpe society most likely originated among the Efik people of southern Nigeria and from there spread across other tribes and language groups in Southern Nigeria. It became a truly multi-group society, finding its’ way to almost all groups in the region and gaining dominance in several groups. In its heyday, it had a large following across the entire Cross River area; among the Efik, Ibibio, Igbo and other surrounding groups. The Ekpe were a cultural, religious, social and political group whose influences were felt in every aspect of the lives of the people.\n\nEkpe means leopard, literally. The Ekpe is said to be a mysterious spirit that dwells deep in the jungle. This spirit is a very knowledgeable being who sometimes passes across messages to members of the society. The primary function of the Ekpe society, however, was not religious (that is to worship the spirits), it was social and political. In most of the societies, the Ekpe acted as the police for the community as well as providing political and social leadership. In fact, in some places the Ekpe society would come to become THE strongest political organization. This was because in those places (most notably Calabar) all free men were members of the Ekpe society. In keeping with the times, Ekpe was a male only society. But perhaps the most lasting gift that the leopard society left us is Leopard Knocks. I’m kidding, but I do love Nnedi Okorafor’s book ‘What Sunny Saw in the Flames’ published in some countries as ‘Akata Witch’. The greatest gift of the Ekpe society is Nsibidi, one of Africa’s very own indigenous writing systems.\n\nNsibidi, also referred to sometimes as Nsibiri, Nchibiddi or Nchibiddy (you see the handiwork of white people in all these sha) is a writing system indigenous to the Nigeria. It is an ideographic script (where a graphic symbol is used to represent a concept or idea) with some pictographic and even logographic elements. The exact age of the language is of course unknown (because foreign archaeologist could not care less and Nigeria has refused to enbrain, but that’s just my opinion) but the earliest Nsibidi artifacts have been dated to somewhere (or somewhen) between 400 and 1400 CE. Obviously, more work needs to be done but excavations in the Calabar region revealed that Nsibidi was carved into pottery as well as ceramic stools and headrests well before the 15th century.\n\nNisbidi was devised as a method of communication among members of the Ekpe society. However, like most things, it quickly grew past that. Nsibidi soon became widely used by everyone in the community, member and non-member alike. While some of the Nsibidi symbols, such as those relating to spiritual matters or warfare, were kept secret, used and understood only by relatively high ranking members of the society, some other symbols were widely in use by all members of society. In fact, at a point in time, there was a school where children studied Nsibidi, very much like our own formal education systems today, only shorter.\n\nNsibidi was used for communication, decoration and entertainment purposes. Thus you could see statues, calabashes or clothes decorated with Nsibidi symbols. Nsibidi was used to paste warnings, to pass across messages and even to record occasions. For example, in one Nsibidi carving discovered, a court case (called Ikpe) was inscribed in great detail. So Nsibidi was widely used for the more serious and less serious functions in society.\n\nThe knowledge of Nsibidi was sadly not retained for several reasons. The most obvious was the coming of the white man. The white man disrupted the indigenous education system and taught young Nigerians that all things local was fetish and inferior to the white culture. Also, older individuals guarded the secrets of the leopard very well and when membership of the groups dwindles, they stayed true and refused to teach outsiders the language. All this and more constituted a major decline in the use and knowledge of Nsibidi.\n\nThis is not to say that the language is dead, far from it. Interest in Nsibidi will probably always be there, I know I for one will continue making efforts to understand the language. Members of the Ekpe (or Ngbe among the Igbos) society still use the language as their symbolism. During the slave trade, the language was transported to Haiti and Cuba where it developed into the anaforuana and veve symbols. If you are interested, you can run a Google search and find out all you want to about Nsibidi, or even start learning the lingo!\n\nSome content on this page was disabled on September 23, 2020 as a result of a DMCA takedown notice from The Nsibiri Project.

There was no referendum, there was no ‘please’ and the white man definitely did not ask our ancestors if they wanted to give up their way of life and suddenly embrace the ways of the white man. For a ‘civilizing’ mission, there was absolutely nothing civilized about the conquest of Africa. So when the people saw their treasured way of life eroding and their positions of power and prestige being usurped, they fought back, usually in little uncoordinated pockets and usually ineffective against the greater weapons and might of the British forces, but they fought back nonetheless. One such pocket of resistance was in Western Iboland, in what is today referred to as the Ibos or the Delta Igbos, among the people who now call themselves the Anioma or sometimes the Enuani. The resistance is often dubbed Aya Ekwumekwu (War of the ones not to be spoken about).\n\nAya Ekwumekwu begun sometime in 1883 and would last till 1914, probably the longest resistance to imperialistic and colonialist goals by any group of people in Africa. Ekwumekwu was, like the Mau-Mau group in Kenya (which some claim it inspired) a secret group bound by sworn oaths made in the presence of the gods and enforced very strictly. This secrecy and the fear it bred made it nigh impossible for the British to discover the members, leaders, operational bases, training camps, movement and pretty much anything about the group. This, I’m sure and happy to report, frustrated the British to no end. It is also one of the reasons for the long lasting nature of the conflict.\n\nThe strategy favored by Aya Ekwumekwu warriors was terribly fast, devastating and somewhat invisible as well as the initiation requirement prospective soldiers had to undergo was probably one of the reasons why Ekwumekwu was given to the group as well as the war they waged. During the war, it was forbidden to reveal any of the group’s secrets, secrets which ranged from initiation to operational bases to troop movement and activity to the sponsors and sources of the group. Because of the secretive nature of the group, it is difficult to say when the group came into existence or who was the brain or brains behind it. The seeming impenetrable secrets of the group puzzled the British to no end and worried them, they did not want this organized underground resistance to become part of established Anioma socio-culture and they especially did not want the resistance to affect their economic goals.\n\nBefore Britain moved officially to occupy western Ibo (or Anioma) territory, they had already had bad reports about the people resident in that area. In 1830, the Lander Brothers had taken back home stories of how the people had captured them after they had invaded the people’s territory. When in 1870, Ndoni (one of the western Ibo communities or villages as we seem to prefer calling them these days) was invaded by the British in a heavy handed attempt by the British to force the people to agree to British economic dictates. Atani, another western Ibo group would follow a mere decade later. Onicha-Ado was also bombarded on November 2, 1897. And this would seem to be the last straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nA year later the British forces, still led by the Royal Niger Company launched a surprise attack on Ibusa. Major Festing, who led them, thus quickly gained a victory as the shocked and overwhelmed Ibusa forces retreated. Ekwumekwu fighters however, did not retreat. They started a campaign of guerilla resistance forcing Feting to seek reinforcements from Lokoja to help sustain his victory. Even with the more sophisticated weaponry, the Company could not win a decisive victory (because, good luck fighting people who don’t stay in one place and operate from secret bases. When the British started destroying farms and villages however, Ibusa elders were forced to seek out Ekwumekwu fighters and broker a peace deal. This was however not the end of the Ekwumekwu.\n\nIn 1904, Ukwunze and Owa (two western Ibo people) engaged the British. Again, Ekwumekwu popped up. Operating with well trained soldiers and better knowledge of the geographic terrain, Ekwumekwu managed to instill heavy losses to the British in spite of the latter’s better weapons. Only the nearly limitless supply of soldiers (few of whom were actually British) kept the English side in the war. Although they were not directly involved in this entanglement, the Ekute provided military and logistic support to the Ekwumekwu.\n\nThe next point where the Ekwumekwu group surfaced was Ogwashi Uku. The war began in November 1909 and supposedly, the British mandate in that war was to kill everyone. Of course this failed; Ogwashi remains a thriving town till today with many famous sons and daughters from footballer Jay-Jay Okocha to the Minister of Finance Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The important thing about the Anglo-Ogwashi war was that it proved that if matched with similar sophisticated weapons, the British Forces could and would collapse. After a fiercely fought battle where the British suffered the most losses in all of their battles in western Iboland, following the arrival of reinforcement for one side, the British won the war. But Ekwumekwu fighters continued their various acts of resistance. None of it broke the military might of the British but it irritated them to no end and I suppose we must take some comfort in that.\n\nPerhaps if the Ekwumekwu fighters had ignored town loyalties and come together to force the Britsh out of all of Western Ibo land, things might have been different but even that is impossible to tell because of the endless support and reinforcement the British were getting. We do not know what could have been only what was and what is. What was, a group of anonymous soldiers put it all on the line to protect their home and their way of life. What is, we celebrate and honor them for their achievements even to this very day.\n\nKnown commanders of the Ekwumekwu include;\n\nDunkwu Isusu of Onicha-Olona\n\nOchei Nwayazia of Onich-Olona\n\nNwabuzo Olimagwo of Issele-Uku\n\nMokobia Odiajo of Ogwashi Uku\n\nNwaiyogolo of Ogwashi Uku\n\nEninwizomo of Ugbodu\n\nIdegwu Otokpoike of Ubulu Uku\n\nMonye Ukpe\n\nDiei Nwobodo\n\nEgbune Uza\n\nAwunor Ugbo of Akumazi\n\nAbuzu of Idumuje-Unor\n\nIdabor of Issele Uku\n\nAgbambu Oshue of Ibusa\n\nSeveral towns in the area participated and contributed soldiers to the Ekwuemkwu movement.

Also follow me on twitter (@EnekeTheBird)\n\nThe Nupe Kingdom was one of the most prominent Kingdoms of the Niger-Benue confluence area, what is today known as the Middle Belt of Nigeria. At its peak, the Kingdom spanned several Nigerian states especially Niger and Kwara states but its influence was felt through the entire Middle Belt and on to the Yoruba Kingdoms and Hausa states. Nupe Kingdom became renowned as a center for culture, arts and sophistication in its time. It also came, as most strong states tend to do, to politically dominate most of its neighbours. According to legend, the Kingdom of the Nupe was formed by a man called Tsoede (sometimes called Tsudi, Tsade or Edegi).\n\nThe Nupe people had lived in that region for a very long time, however, proto-dynastic Nupe (Nupe before the establishment of a Kingdom) was a lose one politically speaking. Most of the people lived in villages where community as opposed to a centralized authority was the bastion of political power. It should be noted, however, that there existed some villages with somewhat developed political systems. These villages, about 12 in number; Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba and Panjuru, operated as independent states with each state having its own town king. They, however, co-operated in cases of military need or in the settlement of disputes. This lose group is often referred to as the Beni Confederacy.\n\nThere are two versions of Tsoede’s early days. According to one version (and this is the most popular version), Tsoede was born to an Igala King and a Nupe woman. However, his father would leave him to be raised in his mother’s Nupe homeland (most often given as Nku). The Nupe at this time were lorded over by the more organized Igala Kingdom so they paid tribute to the Igala. Some of this tribute took the form of slaves to which every household was expected to contribute a member. Tsoede was contributed to one tribute and that was how he found his way to Idah, the Igala capital. At Idah, his father the Attah or Ata (King) recognized him and brought him into the palace as a Prince, highly favored above all his brothers. He then became his father’s favorite and a major contender for the throne of the Igala. On his father’s death however, his half brothers conspired against him and he had to flee upriver to Nupe. The other less popular version of the story has it that Tsoede was born to Nupe parents in a village close to Nupeko. He was sent as a slave to Idah but was a very smart and shrewd man who studied the Igala and realized that the only reason his people were being subjugated was their lack of unity. Whatever be the case, it is clear that Tsoede spent some time in Idah and it would be from Idah hat he would leave to start the unification of the Nupe and the establishment of their Kingdom.\n\nTsoede left Idah with some essential insignia of his office and was carried upriver in a celebrated bronze canoe. He was fully supported by the riverside Nupe (the Kyede) and they even piloted his bronze canoe. To reward their loyalty and support, Tsoede would make the Kyede the Lords of the Water, after he established his Kingdom. Tsoede’s first port of call was Nupeko where he established himself. He then used Nupeko as the base from which he attacked the Beni Confederacy. After conquering the confederacy, Tsoede brought all Nupe speaking people under his rule by persuasion or by force. He created a strong army noted for its strong calvary. In fact, it was reported that Tsoede’s army had 55,000 horsemen. When Tsoede finally unified the Nupe Speaking People and formed the Nupe Kingdom, they were finally strong enough to establish an independent Kingdom free of the control of the Igala. Nupe would, over time, become one of the dominant centers of civilization as well as political power along that part of the Niger River.\n\nTsoede’s contribution was not only felt in the establishment of Nupe Kingdom and in the emancipation and empowerment of his people, even beyond the military campaigns with which he greatly expanded Nupe’s borders and powers, his contribution to the development of the arts can still be felt, or more accurately, seen today. I am talking of course of the Tsoede Bronzes. The Tsoede Bronzes are a group of nine bronze sculptures found in two villages along the River Niger; Tada and Gara. They are called Tsoede Bronzes because legend has it that Tsoede deposited these objects as well as his chains of office in these (and some other) villages on his way to found the Kingdom. He apparently did this to bind the people to himself and because he wanted his Kingdom to flourish in the arts.\n\nThese sculptures have been studied and are still being studied (I hope, though I really don’t know) but they have shown some similarity to both the Benin Bronze school and the Ife Bronze school. However, there are enough distinct differences to show that the works were created by an entirely different set of people influenced by and preserving a different culture. In fact, three of the bronzes (the ostriches and the elephant) do not show any traits of any previously known bronze sculpting. Fortunately for us, the British did not mount a punitive expedition on the Nupe so these bronze artifacts are on display at the National Musuem in Lagos so next time you’re in Lagos check it out.\n\nThe Nupe Kingdom which Tsoede formed remained a strong political and economic force in the area now known as Nigeria; trading with Kingdoms as far south as the Benin Kingdom and the Itshekiri and as far north as Kanem-Borno. Nupe was to fall however, after a period of internal turmoil and strife. In the early 19th century, the jihad swept through Nupe and Nupe Kingdom became Bida Emirate. However, the rulers of the Nupe continued to use the title first used by Tsoede. The Etsu Nupe (King of all Nupes) remains the leader of the Nupe till today.\n\nIf you want to get more information or you want an in depth analysis of the person of Tsoede, check out some of these books;\n\nA Black Byzantium: The Kingdom of Nupe in Northern Nigeria by S.

You can also follow me on twitter @EnekeTheBird to talk or argue if you prefer. Make sure you drop a comment!\n\n“Since men have learnt to shoot without missing,\n\nEneke the Bird has learnt to fly without perching.”\n\n– Chinua Achebe\n\nEneke the Bird, to me, symbolizes adaptation. If we want to thrive, then we must adapt. History, culture and life are among the things that are very important to me, but in my opinion if we (and by we, I mean, historians and everyone interested in History) continue to look at these subjects in isolation units, far removed from the rest of our lives, they (and by translation, we) would die off. We simply cannot let this happen.\n\nI love history and I devour history books. I am a relatively young person, early twenties and the conclusion of all these is that there are people in my age grade are just clueless about our history. And what’s more, they really do not have any interest in tracking down books just to learn some tidbit about the agricultural terrain of the Niger-Benue confluence in the 18th century. What my generation likes are movies, music, celebrity, football, gossip and the rest. And these are all cool things, I mean I like them too. But this blog is going to be about history because I am really hoping that when it is easier to access information more people will develop interest in the subject matter. So here I am, trying to adapt African history to the internet in a bid for our story not to get left behind. Like Eneke the Bird, we are learning to fly without perching.\n\nBut I am in the learning business, so feel free to correct or simply point out errors where you see them. I will most likely argue with you but then debating has always been a hobby J. We will both learn from it. Also feel free to ask any question, there is no such thing as a stupid question (but I am not Ifa or one of his servants), if I cannot answer your question, I’ll do my very best to point you in the right direction. And since I am always shopping for books, let me know if you have any books that I might find interesting (I have a very wide collection because, varied interest or ADHD). So hello and welcome to Eneke the Bird.\n\nAdditionally, Eneke is a bird, not the King of the Sky but a bird nonetheless, with a bird’s view. So I’ll strive to present events in their entirety not telling one person’s story or one side of the story. Okay, that’s it for now. Please read, comment and share!!!!\n\nWell then, let’s have fun, shall we?"
