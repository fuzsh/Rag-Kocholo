        "text": "Origins\n\nAccording to oral traditions of the Jukun people, their migration originated from the east, possibly from Yemil, located east of Mecca. They were led by a leader named Agadu and traveled through various places including Kordofan, Fitri, Mandara, and the Gongola area before reaching the Benue region. Anthropologist C.K. Meek documented another tradition that suggests the Jukun migrated alongside the Kanuri people from Yemen. They reportedly traveled through Wadai to Ngazargamu, the former capital of the Kanem-Bornu empire. They initially settled in the Lake Chad region but later moved to the Benue area due to conflicts with the Kanuri people and overpopulation around the lake.[6]: 23 This tradition finds some support in a Bornu tradition, as reported by H.R. Palmer, which indicates that around 1250 A.D., the Kwona, a section of the Jukun, had established themselves along the Gongola River. However, it's worth noting that the Hausa Bayajidda legend portrays Kororofa as one of the \"illegitimate\" children of Biram.[12]: 201–203\n\nKwararafa\n\nThe Jukun established a state that later developed into an empire centered around the Benue River, with its capital named Kororofa. The state was governed by a \"Divine King\" known as the Aku.\n\nAccording to the Kano Chronicle, Yaji I, the eleventh Sarkin Kano and the first Muslim ruler of Kano, expanded his authority to the borders of Kororofa. The Chronicle mentions that upon Yaji's approach, the Jukun people fled Kororofa. Yaji remained in Kwararafa for a period of seven months. Kanajeji, Yaji's son and the thirteenth Sarkin Kano, reportedly received tribute in the form of two hundred slaves from the Kwararafa.[12]: 203During the reign of Muhammad Zaki, the twenty-seventh Sarkin Kano, Kwararafa launched an invasion of Kano, prompting the people of Kano to flee to Daura for safety. Kwararafa launched another attack on Kano in 1653, resulting in the destruction of Kofan Kawayi, one of the gates of Kano. Additionally, the Chronicle mentions that during the reign of Dadi, Kano faced further invasions. The Chronicle also records that during the reign of Dauda Zaria, under Queen Amina of Zazzau, conquered all the towns as far as Kwararafa and Nupe.[12]: 204\n\nAccording to 'Katsina documents', there was a war between Kwarau, the Sarkin Katsina, and Kwararafa in 1260. The documents also mention that Katsina was invaded by Kwararafa sometime between 1670 and 1684. In Bornu, during the reign of Ali ibn al-Hajj Umar, the 49th Mai of Bornu from 1645 to 1684, Kwararafa attempted to invade Ngazargamu, the former capital of the Kanem-Bornu empire. However, their invasion was unsuccessful due to the fierce defense mounted by the people of Bornu, with assistance from some Tuaregs.[12]: 204\n\nKwararafa reached its height of power in the latter half of the seventeenth century. According to Sultan Muhammad Bello of the Sokoto Caliphate in the nineteenth century, Kwararafa was one of the seven greatest kingdoms of the Sudan. Sultan Bello even claimed that Kwararafa's influence extended to the Atlantic, although this assertion is likely an exaggeration. Historian J.M. Fremantle observed that Kwararafa had exerted its sovereignty over various regions at different times, including Kano, Bornu, Idoma, Igbira, and Igala.[12]: 204\n\nHowever, towards the end of the eighteenth century, Kwararafa, like many states in the region, experienced a decline. The state later faced attacks from the Chamba and Fulani forces in the early nineteenth century, leading to its eventual collapse. Historian Tekena Tamuno suggests that factors such as the displacement of the slave trade by the palm oil trade in Calabar, coupled with internal instability, may have contributed to the decline of the Jukun-led Kwararafa state.[12]: 204\n\nModern history\n\nAs a result of the Fulani conquests at the beginning of the 19th century, the Jukun-speaking peoples became politically divided into various regional factions.[10] By the 1920s, the main body of the Jukun population, known as the Wapâ, resided in and around Wukari, where they were governed by the local king and his administration.[10] Other Jukun-speaking peoples living in the Benue basin, such as Jukun wanu of Abinsi, Awei District, Donga and Takum, remained politically separate from the Wukari government, and the Jukun-speakers in Adamawa Province recognised the governorship of the Fulani Emir of Muri.[10]\n\nIn the post-colonial period, Nigeria has suffered violence, the result of multiple ethnic tensions among the different communities living in the country [citation needed]. Tensions exist between the Jukun and the neighbouring Tiv people, who migrated from Congo[13][14][15][16]"
