        "text": "â€œA journey of a thousand miles, they say, begins with one stepâ€ this prism played out in the life of young Pius Otu Abang. Dr. Pius Abang began his life journey in a private concern in Abuja the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria in 2005. He was employed as General Manager HITECH Security Company. Fate came calling in 2006, when he was invited for interview at the famous Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria where he did his Youth Service and completed a Master Degree (MPA) as best graduating student. He was successful at the interview and then became employed as Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Local Government and Development Studies in 2006. Three years later 2009, he was promoted to the rank of Lecturer 11 having satisfied all requirements for promotion as presented by the institutionâ€™s Appointment & Promotions. Dr. Pius did not relent on his oars. As a young academia he attended conferences and presented papers at premier Universities of Ibadan, Obafemi Awolowo University, University of Lagos, etc. He also got his papers published in peer reviewed journals in the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, University of Maiduhuri, Borno State, Umaru Muse Yarâ€™adua University, Katsina State, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Kaduna State University, Kaduna State, Federal University, Wukari, Taraba State, University of Abuja, the University of Calabar, etc. Dr. Pius has severally been awarded Lecturer of the year by Ahmadu Belloe University, Zaria Students in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2017. He was a member and Secretary of Local Organizing Committee (LOC) of the First ever International Conference organized by the Faculty of Administration, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 2010. He was also a member, Local Organizing Committee of the First National Conference organized by the Department of Local Government and Development Studies, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria-Nigeria in the year 2018. Dr. Pius conducted a Ph.D research in three States; Kaduna, State, Imo State and Ogun State where he under studied the Impact of Fadama 11 Project on Poverty Reduction in comparative terms across the three States. The study faulted the World Bank for lack of feasibility studies before disbursement of funds for the Fadama 11 Project. The result was that, the project was hijacked by elites and thereby consolidating the poverty incidence of the poor. The study has been on the net since 2015. He also participated in the study of 14 villages in Northern Nigeria in the Application of Rapid Rural Appraisal Technique to evaluate the incidence of poverty. The research was sponsored by Official Development Assistance (ODA) United Kingdom in Collaboration with the Department of Local Government and Development Studies, A.B.U Zaria-Nigeria. Dr. Pius is a member, National Political Science Association (NAPSA), and member, South-South Zone of NAPSA. He is currently Supervising Ph.D candidates among whom are colleagues in the Department of Public Administration, University of Calabar-Nigeria. Some of them are almost ready for external defense. Dr. Pius is unassuming and admired by students and colleagues alike. He is very accessible to students and could take up responsibilities in the department at the shortest notice by his Head of Department. He could inconvenience himself to create comfort for others. He is an orator in his own right. He anchored the Golden Jubilee Celebration of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (Kongo Campus) in 2012. Impossible is not in his dictionary. He who dares wins. Little wonder young men take solace when they open up to him for advice. Do not be scared to take a risk. The fact that you did not die at birth like many of your age did, means that you are brave enough to face any challenge that comes your way is his favorite saying. Welcome to the world of astute and adorable dynamic young man Dr. Pius Otu Abang."
