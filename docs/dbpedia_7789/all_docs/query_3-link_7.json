        "text": "I wrote this several years back, but I have never revisited the topic. This was written for the one(!) course that I have taken in the entirety of my history degree that is beyond the year 1400 AD, so my general knowledge past the late middle ages is quite limited. Comments would be appreciated.\n\n===\n\nThe performance of the Ottoman army at Gallipoli was significantly better than its performance in the Balkan Wars, despite primarily fighting defensively in both campaigns. This rapid improvement is due to major changes in the structure of the Ottoman army, as well as a revamped officer corps and improved leadership. While the Ottoman army in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 still left much to be desired, these changes allowed for much-improved logistics and combined arms tactics, two factors that had significantly hampered the Ottoman forces during the Balkan Wars.[FONT=&quot][1][/FONT]\n\nA major lesson that the Balkan Wars taught the Ottoman army was that its entire system of organization needed to be reformed. The professional force, the nizamiye, was fairly well-trained and equipped. However, it depended upon the redif forces, who were poorly trained and equipped, to serve as reserves. Many were also non-Turk and non-Muslim peoples who had no interest in serving the Ottoman government.[FONT=&quot][2][/FONT] This was exacerbated by the fact that many of the redif units were recruited on a territorial basis, leading to local loyalties taking precedence over that of the government in Constantinople.[FONT=&quot][3][/FONT] If this was not enough of an issue, large portions of the population managed to attain exemption status from conscription into the nizamiye, which forced them in war time to be conscripted in the redif units.[FONT=&quot][4][/FONT] This utter lack of training and discipline was amply demonstrated in the opening weeks of the First Balkan War. Although reforms in 1908 reduced the ratio of reservists to professional soldiers, it still existed at around 50%, and many of those conscripted for First Balkan War had no military experience whatsoever.[FONT=&quot][5][/FONT] The poor condition of these troops became obvious, as within six weeks of the beginning of the First Balkan War the Ottoman soldiers had been pushed back to within 20 miles of Constantinople.[FONT=&quot][6][/FONT] It is clear from the particulars of the fighting in the First Balkan War that the Ottoman army was simply not prepared for the rigors of modern combat. The commander of the Ottoman III Corps, Mahmut Muhtar Pasha remarked that the Ottoman soldiers left behind much of their war material in the retreats, and ultimately blamed the failure of the army to hold back the Bulgarians on the poor discipline of the reserve troops.[FONT=&quot][7][/FONT] Additionally, a 1916 military manual called the redif units serving in the Balkan Wars a \"broken reed.\"[FONT=&quot][8][/FONT] Coordinated artillery and infantry attacks by the Bulgarians seemed to be the key in their success in breaking down Ottoman morale. Additional night assaults with bayonets at the Battle of Lozengrad on the 22-24th of October were highly effective against the Ottoman positions, a lesson that the Turks do not seem to have forgotten, as can be seen in their willingness to use such tactics at Gallipoli.[FONT=&quot][9][/FONT] It is significant that the Bulgarian losses during their brief campaign were not light,[FONT=&quot][10][/FONT] which further suggests the disparity between a nationalistic, professional force, and a weak Ottoman multinational force, comprised of large untrained and poorly disciplined reserve corps. Poor training and morale was viewed by Mahmut Pasha, the commander of the III Corps, as the reason for the Ottoman defeat by the Bulgarians. There is little reason to assume otherwise, taking in account their failure to hold a defensive position, withdraw in any sort of reasonable fashion or withstand combined arms assaults.\n\nHowever, the Ottoman army at Gallipoli in 1915 not only managed to keep its troops from routing under combined artillery and naval gunfire, but were able to coordinate combined arms tactics against the allies and organize themselves far more coherently. Thus it is necessary to explain the substantial improvement of the army's morale and organization at Gallipoli, considering that only 16 months passed between the beginning of the attempts to reform the Ottoman army and the allied landings. Following the Ottoman defeat in the Balkan Wars, the officer corps became very interested in reform, and a number of books were written highlighting problems in the Ottoman army. Asim Gündüz had served on the General Staff during the Balkan Wars, and his book was widely circulated. Important points raised by this book included the poor morale of the army, an incompetent officer corps, a lack of coordination between infantry and artillery, and poor coordination of marching columns entering combat.[FONT=&quot][11][/FONT] Curiously enough, these were all areas that the Ottoman army improved upon significantly, as was demonstrated at Gallipoli. In December 1913, Ahmed Izzet Pasha changed the way the redif was structured. He eliminated its local organization, which forced the soldiers, once the mobilization orders had been given, to report as individuals instead of calling up local militia units with little training.[FONT=&quot][12][/FONT] The redif itself was not abolished, but the idea was that the formerly irregular provincial militia soldiers would be integrated into a more permanent redif unit. These were kept under-strength in peacetime, but were still attached to a nizamiye, forming an Ottoman army corps, and were supposed to train together for six weeks a year.[FONT=&quot][13][/FONT] The traditional redif still existed, but was known as the Mustahfiz, and was a territorial retirement militia for men who reached the end of their active duty career.[FONT=&quot][14][/FONT] A 1916 manual of the Turkish army suggests that these reforms were rather successful, and formed a proper reserve instead of a territorial militia. In reference to the mobilization of August 1914, the author specifically notes that individual young men, regardless of whether they had previous training or not, were sent to depots where they received further training. He then goes on to state that the purpose of the reserve was to replace casualties, which supports Erickson's ambiguous point about the redif becoming a training ground for the professional army in wartime.[FONT=&quot][15][/FONT]\n\nThese changes had an enormous effect upon the Ottoman army's performance during the Gallipoli campaign. The militia-grade redif divisions no longer comprised the bulk of the Ottoman land forces, and the purpose of the reformed redif groups was to supplement the nizamiye professional corps, not to act exclusively as front-line troops as they had during the Balkan Wars. This is best demonstrated in the improved Ottoman morale during the Gallipoli campaign, especially the landings, considering that Turkish losses were quite heavy within the first few days of combat. Major John Gillam, a British officer present at Gallipoli was impressed by the naval bombardment of the Ottoman positions, and Erickson has noted how remarkably the Ottomans stood their ground in the face of naval fire.[FONT=&quot][16][/FONT] The shrapnel shells that had caused the Ottoman army so much trouble due to their effective use in the Balkan Wars by the Bulgarians do not seem to have the same effect when fired by the H.M.S. Queen Bess.[FONT=&quot][17][/FONT] The naval bombardment on the 25th of April lasted the entire day, a feature that seemed to be impressed upon Gillam, for he constantly complained about the noise. In his entry at 2:15 PM that day, he notes a conversation that he had with a navy officer, who boasted that there would not be a living Turk [sic] within three miles of the shore. Although there is certainly an element of bravado here, it is not an unrealistic claim. The Ottomans had failed to hold defensive positions on their own territory against Bulgarian ground artillery, so there is little reason that he expected them to be able to withstand the bombardment of the Royal Navy, whose centuries-long sea supremacy had not yet been challenged by the Germans at Jutland. CEW Bean, an ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) correspondent, also remarked on the shelling of the Ottoman positions. However, his focus was primarily on the shelling that the ANZACs received.[FONT=&quot][18][/FONT] This is hardly surprising, as the Ari Burnu beach that the ANZAC contingent attempted to assault was defended by greater heights than the beaches where the British and French attempted to land. Additionally, the ANZACs had to face the 2nd Battalion of the 27th Regiment, who had a mountain battery of howitzers.[FONT=&quot][19][/FONT] However, there is no indication that the Ottoman troops broke under the naval bombardment, even though it would have been very clear to them that their own guns were having only a very limited effect upon the allied landing. Additionally, the Ottomans were not prepared to stop the ANZAC landings due to a misjudgment that caused them to not land in the intended location. It appears that the 2nd Battalion, which had been assigned to Ari Burnu were conducting a fighting retreat in the midst of overwhelming ANZAC numbers, although this stopped once reinforcements arrived around 09:00, and by 10:30 the 27th Infantry had arrived and engaged the ANZACs.[FONT=&quot][20][/FONT] The power of improved Ottoman morale and discipline is amply demonstrated here. First, the 2nd Battalion made a fighting retreat, which was a significant improvement over the wild retreats made during the Balkan Wars, where vast quantities of war material was abandoned.[FONT=&quot][21][/FONT] To add to that success, reinforcements arrived and they managed to halt the ANZACs. They did so with a bayonet attack, knowing full well that they were grossly outnumbered, as four Ottoman battalions were fighting eight ANZAC battalions. By that evening, the ANZACs were considering a withdrawal to their ships.[FONT=&quot][22][/FONT] This was not an uncoordinated attack that was desperately trying to drive the ANZACs into the sea, but one that had waited until the two reinforcement divisions had linked up and were supported by three artillery batteries.[FONT=&quot][23][/FONT] These particular examples are an excellent demonstration of the capability of the Ottoman army at Gallipoli. Their morale no longer easily broke under fire, and they were capable of coordinating combined arms in an effective counterattack, all the while being badly outnumbered and taking casualties.[FONT=&quot][24][/FONT] The fact that they managed to halt the ANZACs despite only having a single infantry battalion upon the beach where they landed with a forward bayonet counterattack within three hours says much about the greatly improved quality of the Ottoman army's discipline and morale.\n\nThe improved morale, communication, and combined arms tactics of the Ottoman army at Gallipoli was certainly due to its reformation at the army corps level, but improved leadership cannot be discounted. After losing to the Serbian army during the Balkan Wars, Zeki Pasha remarked that the officers were indifferent to their duties and interested in things outside of the military.[FONT=&quot][25][/FONT] In addition to outright incompetence, what Zeki Pasha is likely referring to is political factionalism within the officer corps. The revolution by the Young Turks in 1908 had led to factional strife within the army, as older officers frequently held loyalty to the now-powerless Sultan Abdul Hamid II, while younger officers typically were involved with the Young Turks movement.[FONT=&quot][26][/FONT] In January 1914, Izzet Pasha was replaced by Enver Pasha, a friend of the Young Turks, as head of the Ottoman army. He immediately involuntarily retired 1300 aging officers who were thought to be hampering the modernization of the army, although it is probably no coincidence that the older officers were generally the ones who did not support the Young Turks party.[FONT=&quot][27][/FONT] Nonetheless, the army was crowded with incompetent leaders. The Sultan, a deeply fearful man, promoted officers who had not gone through the Ottoman army's training colleges, specifically because he felt that they produced liberal officers who may not support his regime.[FONT=&quot][28][/FONT] In March 1914, Enver Pasha issued General Order No. 1, which supported a reform of the army's tactical doctrine on the basis of combined arms warfare and an attempt to rearm the army. The Ottoman use of combined arms is best demonstrated in Mustafa Kemal's defence and counterattack against the ANZACs on May 1st. At 05:00, the Ottoman artillery opened fire upon the ANZAC trenches, and fifteen minutes later, the infantry attacked. This was a massive assault, with around 18,000 men in three wings. The center and left wings attacked on time, with the right following shortly. However, the ANZACs were prepared, and the attack was an utter disaster. Estimates are that somewhere between 6000-10000 Ottoman troops were killed.[FONT=&quot][29][/FONT] Although this attack was an utter disaster, it demonstrated a competent understanding of combined arms tactics of the sort that were never used by the Ottomans during the Balkan Wars. Kemal postponed his attack by 24 hours, a time that appeared to have been critical for ANZAC morale, just so that he could move his artillery and machine guns into position to support the infantry. This particular example of combined arms tactics amply demonstrates how far the Ottoman army had come since the defeats during the Balkan Wars, and how good leadership affected the entire army.\n\nIn sum, although the Ottoman army still left much to be desired by the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, significant changes following the Balkan Wars had improved it substantially. The reorganization reduced the number of militia-grade troops in the army and trained the reserves for integration into the proper army, and this improved morale and discipline to levels that were unheard of in the Balkan War campaigns. The reform of the officer corps also contributed to Ottoman success, as a younger generation of officers came to be the leaders on the battlefield. These younger officers were better trained than their forebears, and understood combined arms tactics on a level that was not even comprehended during the Balkan Wars.\n\nBibliography:\n\nAkmeşe, Handan Nezir.
