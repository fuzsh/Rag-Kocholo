        "text": "The last century of the Empire can be called a “Reform Century” since throughout the 20th century, the Empire implemented radical reforms covering its military, economic, social and administrative structures. In particular, from 1514 to the beginning of the 19th century, the relationship of Kurdish tribes with the Porte remained in balance and the agreed autonomous status was protected. However, due to greater revenue requirements to meet military expenditure, bureaucratic modernization and an overt requirement for conscription to help support a new army which was to substitute for the abandoned Janissaries units, when the administrative reforms of the Empire were implemented all across the Empire, the silent relationship was broken and the struggle between the Kurdish tribes and the Porte commenced continuing, indeed until the end of the Empire. From the reforms in administration, in other words, centralisation proved to be the most significant as it triggered events which encouraged Kurdish tribal leaders to rebel against the Centre, to protect their long enduring and established positions among their adherents and also against the Centre superseded by the Porte. My argument in providing this information is that the rebellions of the Kurdish Tribes during the 19th century should be considered as reactions towards reforms rather than a preliminary phase of Kurdish nationalism which had as its goal the establishment of a separate Kurdish state. I will consider the cases of the Abdurrahman Pasha Revolt in 1806, the Mir Muhammad Pasha of Rewanduz in 1834, the Bedirhan Pasha Revolt in 1840s and finally the Sheikh Ubeydullah Revolt in 1880 to support this argument.\n\nModern Kurdish historiography, which examines resistance to provincial centralization in Ottoman Kurdistan, focuses largely on Bedir Khan’s Bohtan emirate and his revolt in the 1840s, while ignoring the rest of the other Kurdish emirates such as Baban emirate. While both states, Qajar Iran and Ottoman Empire, were endeavoring to solve their conflicts in the 1840s (a process which culminated in the treaty of Erzurum in 1847) the future of the Baban emirate and its territories emerged as one of the major issues during the course of negotiations. The Baban emirate was the last emirate to give up its struggle against the Sublime Porte’s centralization reforms. The legacy of the Kurdish emirates is important to understand better the relations between the center of the Ottoman Empire and its eastern periphery, a much less studied subject in Ottoman historiography. This article will highlight the impact of the centralization policies in Kurdistan, more specifically on territories of the Bohtan and Baban emirates. It will be demonstrated that the changes wrought by the Tanzimat reforms were partially successful in transforming the Kurdish notables, who later became a part of the state bureaucracy. Though, the reform minded officials, who were appointed after the Kurdish emirs were removed from the region, failed to persuade the locals in favor of the new administration thus transforming their lives.\n\nThis paper will mainly analyze Ottoman politics of tribe in the province of Baghdad during the nineteenth century, a period in which the tribal organizations began to be incorporated into the modern state mechanisms. It aims to explore the place of the state with particular emphasis on diverse forms of appropriation of political power and center-periphery nexus with the context of tribal structure in Ottoman Iraq. The Ottoman centralization in Iraq aimed to de-construct the tribal structure of the country, because the strong tribal organization was considered as the most significant obstacle for the implementation of the reforms. However, the issue of how to control the disruptive tribes plagued every governor in Baghdad. The policies followed by Ottoman governors against the Iraqi tribes can be summarized as carrot or stick game and they varied considerably from granting favors to certain tribes, creating inter-tribal frictions, recognizing a rival chieftain within a given tribe, the use of military force, incorporation of the tribal structures into the provincial political mechanism, and settlement of the tribal confederations. Taking a close relative (usually the son) of a sheikh into custody in the provincial center was also a policy applied frequently for managing a particular tribe. The stick, in other words, the use of military force came usually when all other methods of “politics of tribe” failed."
