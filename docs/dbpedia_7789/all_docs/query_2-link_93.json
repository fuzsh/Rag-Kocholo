        "text": "Mustafa Kemal Pasha's Visit to Fenerbahçe Sports Club\n\nThe year is 1918, the First World War is in full swing. The enemy navy could not pass the Dardanelles Strait, which Mustafa Kemal was at the head of and defended, and suffered a complete defeat. Now, other wars await Mustafa Kemal on other fronts. Meanwhile, he came to Istanbul for a short vacation from the front and wanted to visit Fenerbahçe Club. It is not known whether this request came from Mustafa Kemal, who was known as the Hero of Anafartalar in those years, or whether his close friend, Fenerbahce Club President Sabri Toprak, directed him.\n\nThe date is May 3, 1918. Although the war was not felt directly in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, the majority of the uniformed people walking in the streets reminds this.\n\nIn the afternoon, two people are walking on the road from Moda to Kuşdili. One of them is in plain clothes with blond hair and blue eyes. This is Anafartalar Hero Mirliva (Brigadier General) Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Next to him is Sabri Toprak, the Secretary General of the Union and Progress Party and one of our Great Father's favorite friends. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, this time as the Commander of the Lightning Army Group, stopped in Istanbul for a few days on his way to the Palestine Front.\n\nThey come to Fenerbahçe Club's Kuşdili Tavern next to Kuşdili Meadow. The people of Fenerbahce are waiting for him, as the Lightning Arms Commander, Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who was famous for not allowing the enemy to pass in Çanakkale, and Sabri Bey, who was known by everyone, and Sabri Bey foretold that they would come to visit the club. First, a tired coffee is drunk. Then Dr. Together with Hamit Hüsnü and Elkatipzade Mustafa, you visit the second floor of the tavern where the trophies are. Later, Elkatipzade Mustafa Bey hands him the club diary.\n\nThe note that Mustafa Kemal Pasha wrote in the honor book during his visit to Fenerbahçe Sports Club. (May 3, 1918)\n\nThe note that Mustafa Kemal Pasha wrote in the honor book during his visit to Fenerbahçe Sports Club. (May 3, 1918)\n\n\"I heard the great work of the Fenerbahce Club, which was appreciated everywhere, and I took it upon myself to visit this club and congratulate the connoisseurs.\n\nThe fulfillment of this duty could only be realized today. It is permissible to record my appreciation and congratulations here.\"\n\nArmy Commander\n\nM. Kemal\n\n3.5.1334 (3.5.1918)\n\n\"I had heard about the works and works of the Fenerbahçe Club, which are appreciated and appreciated everywhere, and it was my duty to visit this club and congratulate those who contributed to this work.\n\nThis task has only been fulfilled today. I'm proud to record here what I appreciate and celebrate.\"\n\nArmy Commander\n\nM. Kemal\n\n3.5.1334 (3.5.1918)\n\nWax sculptures reenacting Atatürk's visit to Fenerbahçe Club.\n\nFinally, the Great Leader, who drank lemonade before leaving the club, stayed at Fenerbahçe Club for about two hours.\n\nWhen it was time to return, this time two white double race boats (fita) of Fenerbahçe Rowing Branch were boarded from the pier of the club near Kurbağalıdere. Elkatipzade Mustafa Bey is in the rowing. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, as a final word to Fenerbahçe fans:\n\nHe left the club saying \"I wish Fenerbahce endless success (success), good-bye\" .\n\nAtatürk Helps Fenerbahçe Club:\n\nOn the night connecting June 5 to June 6, 1932, a fire broke out in Fenerbahçe's wooden club in Kuşdili. Historical photographs, materials from all branches, all the club's documents, library and furniture in the clubhouse were completely burned together with the building. Very few items were salvaged.\n\nFenerbahçe Club is homeless. Newspapers launch charity campaigns. For example, Cumhuriyet Newspaper publishes donors with their names every day. We learn from the Cumhuriyet Newspaper that the total donations made on Monday, June 20, 1932, amounted to 791 liras. There is a news in the upper right corner of the 1st page of Cumhuriyet Newspaper numbered 2917 for Tuesday, June 21, 1932.\n\n\"His Eminence donated 500 Lira to Fenerbahce.\"\n\nThe document of Atatürk's help to Fenerbahçe Club.\n\nAtatürk always made such expenditures out of his own salary and account. When we examine the newspaper, it is seen that the total amount of donations made in 10-12 days is 791 liras. Atatürk alone sent 500 Lira and the amount suddenly increased to 1300 Lira.\n\nWax statue of Atatürk in Fenerbahçe Club Museum.\n\nAtatürk's personal belongings in Fenerbahçe Club Museum.\n\nAtatürk's gun in Fenerbahçe Club Museum.\n\nAtatürk bust at Fenerbahçe Club :\n\nHe was sensitive about putting Atatürk busts all over the place and erecting his statues. It was obvious that it was against that unique hero to adorn the four corners of the country with busts and statues with ostentatious ceremonies. Throughout his life, he did not encourage this type of behavior and did not find it appropriate. People had to absorb his ideas and be the guardians of their revolution. However, Fenerbahce has experienced one of the exceptions in this regard. On the 1st of June 1934 anniversary of Fenerbahçe Club, he took an oath and asked to put an Atatürk bust in his stadium, Atatürk personally accepted and gave his consent. Fenerbahçe Stadium still carries the honor and distinction of being the only stadium in Turkey where Atatürk's bust is allowed to be placed.\n\nAtatürk bust in Fenerbahçe Club Museum.\n\nA document signed by Gazi Mustafa Kemal, which foresees the transfer of Fenerbahçe Stadium to the club for 10 years.\n\nGeneral Harrington Cup\n\nOne of Fenerbahçe's greatest victories against the occupation forces is the “General Harington Cup” match. The match was played on 29 June 1923 in Taksim Stadium in front of a large audience.\n\nTurkish youth entered into a great rivalry with the occupation forces in sports, especially football fields. Here in Fenerbahce, he played matches with strong teams consisting of football players who played in almost the most famous teams of the English and French leagues, with many well-known football players in the enemy troops from all classes. It has planted seeds of consolation and hope in the hearts of the oppressed Turkish people.\n\nThe Occupation Armies Commander-in-Chief feels a special hostility towards Fenerbahçe Club. Because the Fenerbahçe team not only strengthened the national feelings of the people by defeating the teams belonging to the occupation forces one after another, but also engaged in activities that were \"very harmful\" for the enemy. While Istanbul is under occupation, Fenerbahce people smuggle weapons into Anatolia with motorbikes docking at the pier in front of the clubhouse on the edge of Kurbağalıdere. The boathouse of the Fenerbahçe club has been turned into a weapons and ammunition depot. At night, the engines that docked secretly at the wooden pier in front of this boathouse were loaded from here, secretly sailed to Moda Bay, and passed to Izmit from there, taking weapons and ammunition to Anatolia. This \"harmful(!) activity\" of Fenerbahçe club is received by the Commander-in-Chief of the Occupation Armies, However, realizing this, the people of Fenerbahçe immediately emptied the boathouse and carried the ammunition to the member and athlete houses in the surrounding area. The occupation forces that raided the club could not find any evidence. However, a bayonet detachment was left to the Fenerbahçe club by the Commander-in-Chief and the Fenerbahçe clubhouse was occupied for weeks.\n\nNot being able to achieve anything despite all efforts made the British Commander-in-Chief of the occupying armies, General Harrington, very angry. Fenerbahce; At least he did not fail to do his best to inflict a painful blow on the football field. In order to achieve his goal, Commander-in-Chief Harrington held a tournament with gold medals and three teams came to the fore at the end of the tournament: Irish Guards, Grenadiers Guards and Goldstream Guards... The most outstanding members of these three teams were subjected to hard work.\n\nIn the meantime, he brought four important players, all professional football players, from the British military forces in Gibraltar and Egypt, and almost formed a \"England National Team\". The target is so big that the silver-engraved cup, close to one meter in length, was named the Commander-in-Chief \"General Harrington\". This team, which was formed under the name of \"Goldstream Guards\", was specially camped and subjected to hard work. And after that, the following announcement was made by General Harrington in the Istanbul newspapers:\n\n“Gardler Muhteliti is challenging Turkish clubs. Turkish clubs can get reinforcements as they wish for this match, where the winner will be given a big trophy bearing the name of the Commander-in-Chief.”\n\nFenerbahce fans immediately understood that this challenge was aimed directly at themselves. And again, they gave the necessary answer through the newspapers:\n\n“Fenerbahce Club accepts this match unconditionally, only with its own staff.”\n\nThis match, which aroused great excitement in Istanbul, was played on 29 June 1923 in Taksim Stadium in front of a large audience. The Governor of Malta, Lord Plummer, who came with the “Iron Duck Battleship” to watch this match, took his place in the corner of honor together with the Commander-in-Chief of the Occupation Armies, General Harrington. On the table in front of the corner of honor is the General Harrington Cup, which will be awarded to the winner of the match.\n\nFenerbahce came to this historic match with the following famous team that won the Istanbul championship without conceding a goal:\n\nŞekip Kulaksızoğlu - Hasan Kamil Sporel, Cafer Çağatay - Kadri, İsmet, Fahir - Sabih, Alaeddin Baydar, Zeki Rıza Sporel, Ömer Tanyeri, Bedri Gürsoy.\n\nFenerbahce, who lost the first half of the match, which started with a great rivalry and always passed with the same contention, lost 1-0 in the second half, and started to show its classical football. The Yellow-Navy Blue team, which caught the draw with Zeki Rıza's goal in the 60th minute, opened up even more after that. In the 74th minute, Zeki Rıza (Sporel) again made Fenerbahçe become the winner with a very hard shot, and after that, the pressure of the Yellow-Navy Blue team in the game increased even more and Fenerbahçe defeated its strong opponent in this historical match. After the match, the Commander-in-Chief of the occupying armies, General Harrington, handed this big silver trophy bearing his name to the captain of Fenerbahçe team Hasan Kamil Sporel, the fez almost flew in the air at Taksim Stadium and the ground shook. Fenerbahce players, They were taken out of the stadium on the shoulders of the spectators with the General Harrington Cup in their hands and they were circulated in the streets of Beyoğlu among great displays of love. This victory had the effect of a national victory. When the news of this victory reached the Turkish delegation, who was at the Lausanne Conference on the night of the match, the head of the delegation, İsmet Pasha, was sent to Fenerbahçe club; “On behalf of our delegation, I congratulate all of you with joy and kiss your eyes.” A congratulatory telegram was sent. I kiss your eyes.\" A congratulatory telegram was sent. I kiss your eyes.\" A congratulatory telegram was sent.\n\nGeneral Harrington Cup\n\nSource:\n\n1- Fenerbahce in Time Tunnel, Alp Bacioglu, Ileri Publishing House 2007.
