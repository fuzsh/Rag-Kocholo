        "meta_description": "This article contributes to the slowly growing literature on the 1894-1896 Armenian massacres with a microhistory of the events in the city of Harput (Kharpert) on November 11, 1895. Historians have shed light on the structural reasons behind the event and identified the individuals in charge but the collective aspect of the massacres has so far been neglected. In this study, the narratives produced before, during, and after the event are isolated and compared in order to reveal a fundamental change in how the event was described. The article argues (i) that the massacres in the city centre were not expected by its residents; (ii) that the event was perceived as an invasion of the city by outsider Kurdish tribesmen rather than an Armenian conspiracy.",

        "text": "8Second, the article presents a methodological contribution by paying close attention to the chronology of narrative construction about the massacres. The narratives produced before, during, and after the event are isolated and compared in order to reveal a fundamental change in how the event was described. To begin with, over the months before the massacres in Harput, a massive attack to the city center was not expected although the residents were well aware of the ongoing anti-Armenian violence in other regions. Contrary to the assumptions of the current historiography, the event was surprising – even for the missionaries, who were very sensitive to official and unofficial activities against the Christians. More importantly, the Harput case shows that the reports written after the fact, which are frequently used by historians, completely diverge from the reports dispatched during the event. While we see the classic “provocation thesis” in the reports composed afterwards, that thesis is nearly absent in the telegraphs and letters written out at the time of the pogroms. Although officials criminalized Armenians to a certain degree, the entire conversation during the event was focused on the invasion of Harput by the Kurdish tribesmen, without any substantial argument about Armenian provocation. However, later reports not only placed sole blame on Armenians, but even more conspicuously, they erased in toto the Kurdish invasion from the picture. Furthermore, the same discursive shift occurred also in the narratives of the Armenians and the missionaries. They, too, left out the Kurdish invasion from their later narratives and framed the event as a provocation by – this time – the government or the “Turks.” Hence, this article challenges the widespread assumption that the provocation theory as a discourse existed from the very beginning and that it was under the monopoly of the Turkish officials; neither was correct for Harput.\n\nRumors of Violence in Harput\n\n9This section analyzes the perception of increasing violence against Armenian villagers in the eastern provinces in 1895 relying on the records of American missionaries and the local government in Harput. It will show that, prior to the massacre in the city in November, Harput residents thought it unlikely that such violence would unfold in Harput even though the news of violence from the surrounding countryside was abundant. Contrary to teleological historical accounts, therefore, what became clear signs for later generations did not necessarily carry the same meaning for contemporaries. In Harput, daily life continued until the last day because, first, the cities were apparently thought to be immune to such barbarism and, second, the source of violence was vague and hard to pinpoint by city dwellers. In fact, as the constant use of ambivalent references to “Kurds” also suggests, the residents (Armenians and Muslims alike) of the city were fairly ignorant of and alienated from the countryside.\n\n43 Letter from C.F. Gates to W.W. Peet, Harpoot, November 4, 1895, ABCFM, Reel 700.\n\nThe whole country seems to be in state of upheaval. There is some kind of trouble going on at Diarbekir. It is said to be from Koords, and it has been going on for three days as nearly as we can learn. There has also been trouble at Bitlis, and in many other places. Of course all kinds of rumors are rife, we make it a point to believe only those which are authenticated. Our school is still open though the number in attendance is few. The whole city is tossed with apprehension, expecting an attack from the Koords. Some say the Koords have government sanction, others that the Turks in the city are in league with them etc. A few soldiers parade the quarter, but I do not suppose they would amount to much in the case of an actual attack.43\n\n19We know that it occurred but it is important to emphasize that the upcoming invasion of the city was “unforeseen” even after all the news of violence. In the autumn of 1895, local anti-Armenian violence and the regional Kurdish invasion were understood as two related but distinct events. The former did not surprise anybody and was perhaps tolerated by many Muslims and officials, while the latter was an unprecedented threat to the city. Conflating these two phenomena resulted in the trivialization of the Kurdish invasion in the existing historiography.\n\nKurdish Invasion of the Harput Plain\n\nThe Event: Monday, November 11\n\n26The people of Harput woke up on Monday to hear that the worst was, finally, happening. The city was surrounded by thousands of Kurds who were determined to enter the city. Ali Emiri’s “very urgent” telegram in the morning was a testimony of paralysis in the local government; it was wired to Istanbul from a provincial capital city that was basically under siege by insurgents. This time, they had really come! Ali Emiri reported that notables, representatives of established families and religious leaders were sent to the rebels to explain that only the state had the right to establish order and that the sultan had given no permission for their actions. The crowd at first retreated upon such persuasive talk, but then came back to the perimeter of the city. It would be gravely dangerous to use guns against such a big crowd; thus, everybody was waiting.\n\nKurds Disappearing\n\n38Abdullah Pasha’s second report had sections for each province and the way he managed to shift the focus from Kurdish rebellion to Armenian plots in the Harput section was quite outrageous: He confined his narrative to the incident in Kesrik on Thursday, November 7, and he remained completely silent about the main events of Monday the 11th. As mentioned before, the acting governor Ali Emiri had recounted the Kesrik event as a relatively insignificant conflict caused by some drunken Armenians. According to the present account, however, gunshots from the house of Krikor Yağcıyan injured three Muslim notables. Given that Armenians in Harput had closed their shops without any reason a few days prior, and given the grave influence of Armenian disturbances on public opinion, Muslims reacted to the incident in a spirit of self-defense, which left three Armenians killed. Having heard the incident, Kurds gathered around, and in Hüseynik a few of them as well as an officer were killed by Armenian bullets. As a result, Kurds got agitated, but thanks to the deployment of the imperial troops, a probable disturbance was successfully prevented.\n\n39To give Abdullah Pasha his due, he did mention Kurds in this account, but only as a reactive group who came upon the local incidents. However, it was clear from all sources without exception that local incidents among resident Muslims and Armenians postdated the Kurdish invasion of the plains. By focusing on the Kesrik affair, Abdullah Pasha did not simply distort history but completely wiped out the Monday invasion from the official narrative. Zeki Pasha’s and Abdullah Pasha’s reports not only blamed the Armenians for their misery but also effaced the Kurdish uprising from history. Today’s critical scholarship has so far faced up to the former, but not the latter.\n\n*\n\n42Collective action is admittedly difficult to grasp for historians; thus, we are inclined to clean up the chaotic picture and identify the “real” perpetrators behind the scene. We are not alone; the narrators of the Harput massacre did the same. After the event, American missionaries put the blame on “Turks” of the city and the local military authorities personified by Mustafa Naim Pasha. They represented the invasion as a “sham” and the invaders as “pseudo-Kurds.” Armenian commentators and the later Armenian historiography, by contrast, hold the central government responsible, taking the invasion as a centrally administered assault. Finally, Ottoman officials put forward the now well-known provocation theory and incriminated the Armenians for the calamity they went through. Hence, all theories that are discussed today by historians were available in the aftermath of the massacres. Yet, as I show in this article, none was the dominant narrative for any of the three parties during the massacres. All of the accounts penned in November 1895 testify that the event was perceived as a Kurdish invasion. Soon after, however, Kurds disappeared from all narratives in toto."
