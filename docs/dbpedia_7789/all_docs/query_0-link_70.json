For three years, he fought against the enemy in an epic struggle, facing various challenges, such as illness, hunger, and even had to eat grasshoppers against hunger, and the saddest part was that his own soldiers rebelled against these challenges. As long as the command of Allah, the consent of the prophet and the will of the sultan, I defend this place. ' Despite the will of the Sultan, he did not want to withdraw, not because of the rebellion. It is uncomfortable that the holy lands were taken away from the Muslims. Even if the order came, he was not willing to lose the holy land. In order not to pass into the hands of the British, he sent the sacred relics in Medina to Istanbul with 2 thousand soldiers despite his need. \"\n\nExplaining that Şerif Hüseyin, who attacked the Ottoman Empire with the provocation of the British, also paid the price of his betrayal, İngiliz the British did not deceive him, they did not give him anything they promised. said.\n\nProfessor Dr. İpşirli stated that Fahrettin Pasha had to surrender after a long struggle and said: \"The British first drove him to Egypt and then to Malta.
