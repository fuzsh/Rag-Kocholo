        "text": "The 150-year-old palace in Istanbul was built by French-Ottoman architect Alexander Vaullary for Musir Zeki Pasha\n\nWith 27 bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a 430ft pier to park yachts, there's plenty of space for guests\n\nA mansion built for a Turkish Sultan's top army commander could be yours - if you've got £75million to spare.\n\nThe 150-year-old Zeki Pasha Palace boasts 27 bedrooms, eight bathrooms and four kitchens and 33,000 sq ft of living space.\n\nThe five-storey manor in Istanbul was built by French-Ottoman architect Alexander Vallaury for Musir Zeki Pasha, who was a minister under Sultan Abdulhamit II in the late 19th century.\n\nThe 150-year-old Zeki Pasha Palace sits on the waterfront of Istanbul's Bosphorus strait and is on the market for £115million\n\nOne of the mansion's 27 bedrooms is pictured complete with a grand chandelier\n\nThe five-storey home sits under the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge in Istanbul, which connects the European and Asian sides of Turkey\n\nPart of the secluded Japanese-style garden, which also has pools and fountains in the grounds\n\nA tea room within the house has opulent red furnishings and large cabinets displaying trinkets\n\nWith rooms covered from ceiling to floor in marble, plenty of art and antiques, plus a secluded Japanese-style garden with pools and fountains to care for, the new owner will inherit 20 members of staff to maintain the property's upkeep.\n\nAnd there's sure to be plenty of space to choose from to avoid the noise from passing traffic.\n\nThe house sits under the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge over the Bosphorus strait, which connects the European and Asian sides of Turkey.\n\nA 430ft pier juts out into the water as a parking spot for yachts with a private boathouse on hand.\n\nVallaury designed a home for the Sultan following the success of Zeki Pasha Palace, and built palaces for other army commanders.\n\nThis inner room shows silverware and elegant fittings, though the £75million price tag probably doesn't include the cat\n\nFrench architect Alexander Vallaury designed tall rooms with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Bosphorus strait\n\nMusir Zeki Pasha commissioned the baroque mansion from Vallaury, who went on to design palaces for other army commanders in the Turkish forces\n\nThe new owner of Zeki Pasha Palace will inherit a staff of 20 to help with the upkeep\n\nA spokesman for Sotheby's Realty said: 'This is a wonderful property that has received quite a large amount of interest.\n\n'It was built by French architect Alexandre Vallaury, who helped to rebuild Istanbul after following the immense 1894 earthquake, and is a true gem.'\n\nVisitors won't need to bother with crossing the bridge - they can sail up to the house's 430ft pier in their yachts and drop anchor\n\nMany of Vallaury's homes are now privately owned or museums and galleries, so it is a rare chance to live in a property designed by the French-Ottoman architect\n\nZeki Pasha was a minister in the government of Sultan Abdulhamit II in the late 19th century"
