At the beginning of the century it was already divided between two states, the Ottomans and Qajarian Iran. This division became more apparent when the two states tried to create a boundary. The boundary between Iran and the Ottoman Empire was made of mainly by Lake Urmia in the Northwest of Iran and the chain of Zagros Mountains between today’s Iran and Iraq...",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n3As the political and administrative divisions in Kurdistan increased the transformation of the land accelerated further. Thus, despite the Kurdish emirates lasted for several centuries, after the 19th century such political structures were replaced with the religious leaders and later with the tribal chiefs. Taking such a transformation into consideration one could follow three phases in the 19th century of Kurdistan: Firstly, the classical period, which was dominated by secular leaders, namely the emirates; secondly, the period of religious leaders, when the emirates were destroyed and replaced by sufi leaders; thirdly and finally, the period of tribal leaders, which became the rule of the day after 1890, when the Cavalry Regiments were established by Sultan Abdulhamid II.\n\nEmirs : The Secular Stage\n\n4From the beginning of the Ottoman administration until mid-19th century the political system in Kurdistan remained almost the same. During this period Kurdistan was made of several Kurdish Emirates, mainly Bitlis, Hakkari, Bohtan, Bahdinan, Soran and Baban. There were several other smaller emirates and vassal territories in Diyarbekir, Mardin, and Bayezid. The emirates of Ardalan and Mukri remained mostly under the Iranian states and mostly known as Persian Kurdistan. However, once in a while the Ottoman Empire and some other times the Baban Emirate occupied the territories of these two emirates.\n\nAbdurrahman Pasha Movement\n\nThe Kurdistan Question\n\nTowards Centralization\n\n11Once the new regulations were introduced and centralization policies were imposed on the Kurdish notables, from 1834 until 1847 their emirates were started to be scratched off the ground of Kurdistan one by one. Before moving on the Kurdish emirs Mahmud II had to deal with Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the famous Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt. In 1831‑32 Ibrahim Pasha seized Syria and moved to cross Anatolia all the way to Kütahya. He was persuaded by the European powers to withdraw from the occupied region. Witnessing how a strong local notable from Egypt could devastate the Ottoman army, the Sublime Porte now determined to remove the local powers in Kurdistan.\n\n12Soon afterward, the Porte prepared to launch a campaign against all the Kurdish emirates in the region. Istanbul first decided to send off new governors to the region with new rules. Many emirs did not accept these rules and rulers, which were determined by the Porte, and had a fierce fight with the Ottoman and local armies in order to uphold their autonomous status. In the end, emirs were defeated one by one and were sent to exile with their family members as far as Albania, Crete, Mecca, Tunisia and Egypt. Alongside Soran, Botan, and Hakkari emirates, the Babans were the last Kurdish notables to be crushed in this struggle of centralization.\n\nRestructuring the state and the Kurds\n\nSheikhs : The Religious Stage\n\n16Religion became more important and central in 19th century when the Empire became weaker and the Westerners, both politically and religiously, became more dominant. While the political figures emphasized on the threats to Islam by the Westerns Christians and Eastern Shi’is and asked for the people to be more cautious of the external enemies beyond the borders, there were already some Sufi orders who responded such a call. One of these orders was Naqshbandiyya, which gained further strength with arrival of Sheikh Mawlana Khalid al-Baghdadi, who was from Shahrizor and sought knowledge from a Naqshbandi Sheikh in India. Mawlana was received well and supported financially by the Baban pashas as well as by the Mamluk governors in Baghdad. Once he arrived to Sulaimaniya he immediately started to expend his sphere of influence among the nobles of the town, therefore caused some fury among the old establishments like Qadiri Sufi order since he threatened their domination. Mawlana proved that the balance established among the local notables could be infiltrated and shaken, though with little success for the moment. However the change did not come right away and the Babans, who supported him earlier, drew their political support back. Consequently, he decided to seek a more powerful entity outside of the town that would transform not only his native lands but the whole empire. Therefore, like all the other Sufis, who left their home for their belief, he decided to leave his lands for Baghdad in 1820 and later for Damascus, where he died in 1827. This forced journey would transform the sheikh from being a local notable to a transcontinental figure well known from North Africa to South East Asia. However, a long and thorny road awaited him before he could accomplish goal.\n\n17It was not going to be easy for the sheikh to find support outside of his lands since the sultan did not feel comfortable about supporting him because he suspected all religious movements due to their infiltration into the ranks of the Janissaries and the bureaucracy. His order did not accomplish much about being influential outside Iraq and Syria during his lifetime, but he succeeded to produce well amount of mullahs and assigned them to all around the empire and beyond. After his decease, somehow the sultan changed his policy and supported Mawlana Khalid’s disciples financially. The sultan not only allocated stipends to his successor and family members but also built a tomb for him as well as Sufi lodges for his followers. Accordingly, the order came to be known as Khalidiyya‑Mujaddidiyya (shortly Khalidi) and became more influential in the high ranks of the Ottoman bureaucracy than any other order in the empire.\n\n18After Mawlana Khalid Seyyid Taha-i Hakkari (also known as Nehri or Shamdhinani) became the head of the Khalidi order. This was an important moment since the center of the sufi order was transferred from Sorani speaking south to Kurmanji speaking northern Kurdistan. From then on we see a new division between north as Khalidi dominant and the south as Qadiri dominant regions.\n\nAghas : The Tribal Stage\n\nConclusion"
