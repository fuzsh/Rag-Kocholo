        "text": "2From the beginning, the terminology deployed by Ottoman policy-makers and government officials in reference to the anti-Armenian riots of 1895-1897 was of key importance. Official language and terminology provides evidence useful in understanding the ways in which the representatives of state power, administrators, and military commanders, both at provincial and central levels, conceptualized and responded to the riots and their political implications. As the first part of this paper demonstrates, although the government documents analyzed in the present study were generated purely for internal use, the customary descriptions of anti-Armenian riots by government officials contained substantial ambiguity, linguistic camouflage, and euphemisms. I suggest that through the constant use of the passive voice and euphemistic statements, the imperial authorities sought to neutralize the violence committed against a particular segment of the population and tried to conceal the agency of the perpetrators in the mass killing of Ottoman Armenians.\n\n5Notably absent from Melson’s study is, however, the fact that the so-called provocation thesis was not simply formulated by modern scholars but rather, as we shall see in the following pages, it was developed by the Ottoman authorities themselves although they obliviously never named their case a thesis. In a nutshell, the official contention advanced by the Ottoman authorities was that the mass violence was simply the reaction of Muslim masses to the acts of provocation and aggression on the part of Armenians closely connected with revolutionary, “seditious” committees. According to this view of the matter, the victim’s actions and intentions posed a serious threat and provoked the perpetrator, who eventually responded with violence in order to eliminate the threat or punish the provoking party. Consequently, Ottoman officials – and later government apologists – claimed that Armenians themselves bore responsibility for the violence.\n\n6The official narrative – or the deployment of the concept of provocation as a direct explanation for violence – did not simply arm the Ottoman authorities with a rhetoric they could effectively use for domestic political consumption as well as in the diplomatic arena against their European and American critics, but it also freed them from moral responsibility and the punishment of Muslim perpetrators. Importantly, narratives of provocation raise significant questions about agency, causality, accountability, and victimhood. The representation of the anti-Armenian riots of the mid-1890s in official discourse also reveals the distinct positions that Muslim and Armenian communities occupied in the Ottoman political imaginary and state policies at the turn of the century.\n\n7In the final part of the paper, I will treat the Sivas riots as a case study and offer a thorough examination of the reports of local civilian and military officials to further analyze the official Ottoman language and narrative. A full consideration of the events as they are reflected in Ottoman documents will help us better understand not only the paradoxes of official theses, but also the discursive methods through which the Ottoman officials sought to neutralize, trivialize, and justify violence.\n\nEuphemism for Mass Violence: Writing in the Passive Voice, Neutralizing the Violence, and Concealing the Agency of Perpetrators\n\n14By “those who participate and intervene in the duty of the government,” the Grand Vizier obviously referred to Muslims who might attempt to “punish” Armenians for their “rebellious actions,” as they recently have. Regardless of whether there were any criminal actions, prior to the beginning of the events, on the part of Armenians that deserved punishment within the framework of Ottoman law, it is important to see how Ottoman administrators attributed a logical framework to the violent actions of Muslim crowds in line with the official discourse representing the anti-Armenian disturbances as the reaction of Muslims to the “Armenian uprisings.” As a result, by doing so, the Ottoman bureaucrats in Anatolia and Istanbul both justified the violence and empathized with the perpetrators even though they did not sanction their extremely violent behavior that they stated had undesirable political, economic, and diplomatic consequences for the imperial government.\n\nThe Official Ottoman Narrative: Revolutionary Provocation?\n\n16The Ottoman administrators consistently claimed that the disorders in each and every case had grown out of the provocative and importunate conduct by Armenians who attacked Muslims and security forces. According to the official version of the events, the instigators of the disorders were Armenians while the Muslims simply “boiled over with rage” or acted in self-defense although the Ottoman authorities did not furnish any convincing evidence or substantiation that it was the Armenians who initiated the attacks in most cases. In the final analysis, the official narrative held Armenians responsible for the incidents, and reduced the origins of extremely violent behavior on the part of Muslim perpetrators to psychological conditions like “effervescence,” “rage,” and “excitement.” Such official claims imply that the Armenians had brought on their own destruction. In what follows, I examine the key characteristics and motifs of the official Ottoman narrative that situated the causes of the riots of 1895-1897 in the circumstances allegedly created by Armenian revolutionaries in an attempt to launch a general insurrection throughout the empire’s eastern provinces.\n\n17To begin with one particularly telling example, Field-Marshal Zeki Pasha, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Corps, briefly – and quite ambiguously – explained the origins of the incidents in a report as follows:\n\n16 Y.PRK.ASK. 109/61 (17 January 1896). Cipher telegram from the Field-Marshal of the Fourth Army Corp (...)\n\nSince the Armenian intriguers (Ermeni erbab-ı mefsedeti), who seduced and incited the entire Armenian community with the hope of realizing the idea of autonomy and provoking foreign intervention, dared to attack mosques, public areas, and, in some localities, government houses, disorders (şuriş) took place in certain cities and towns. On the one hand, the [ordinary] Armenians were deceived by the incitement of [those] Armenian intriguers; and, on the other, the disorders that occurred in these cities and towns spread to villages as various fabricated rumors (ürcufeler) to the effect that the Armenians were granted some concessions affected the [mind of] Muslim population very adversely. The disturbances and excitement were, [however,] quelled in a short span of time by the execution of military assistance in response to the requests made by the [local] governments.\n\n19In fact, the Ottoman official narrative about the outbreak of riots tells almost the same story for virtually every place that witnessed widespread violent episodes in the fall of 1895-1896: one Armenian or two suddenly appears in the market square or in front of mosques and begins to randomly shoot Muslims, which eventually provokes a disturbance to be followed by a carnage. As if they were expecting an attack, Muslims fight back without panicking, and within a couple of hours, the streets are packed with corpses of Armenians, nearly all shops and houses belonging to Armenians looted, and Armenian neighborhoods set on fire. In most instances, the Ottoman authorities provided no details about the beginning and escalation of the events; nor did they identify the names of alleged Armenian provocateurs who were reported to have initiated the attack, or those of the Muslims who were supposedly killed by the Armenians in the very beginning.\n\n20Non-Ottoman sources such as reports of the foreign consular agents in the riot centers, missionary accounts, and eyewitness statements clearly acknowledge the role that Armenian revolutionary agitation played in the formation of a tense atmosphere prior to the events in a number of places, particularly in Trabzon, Erzurum, and Arabgir. At times, they also complained about revolutionary activities as an encouragement for violent manifestations on the part of resentful Muslims. However, in their accounts respecting the events in other towns, they clearly state that the claim that disorders were the work of Armenian “seditionists” cannot be substantiated. In many towns, they report, Armenians were quiet before the riots, refraining from doing anything that might provoke the Muslims especially after the acceptance of the scheme of reform by the Sultan on 17 October 1895.\n\n23One of the most important contradictions inherent in the Ottoman official narrative concerning the causes and unfolding of the riots is that although the number of Armenians killed was, in many cases, 20 to 40 times higher than that of Muslims, the authorities uniformly asserted that Muslims defended themselves using the most primitive tools. Such a disparity in death tolls, however, suggests that the killing of Armenians could not simply derive from a defensive action on the part of Muslims. Also, evidence suggests that Armenians were exposed to violence suddenly and could not properly defend themselves in most cases. One can also easily infer from Ottoman reports that in most cases, disorders came to an end only after the authorities stopped Muslims, while those Armenians who were able to escape death either took refuge in their houses, churches, missionary buildings, consulates, and in the houses of their Muslim neighbors, or, in rare cases, fired from their houses on the Muslim rioters. That the rioting in most cases ended in this way provides yet further evidence that Armenians were not equal participants in these disorders, let alone perpetrators advancing the attacks.\n\n27Given the multiple cases in which such practices were observed, it can be surmised that, rather than being a local initiative, it was a central policy to generate such documents signed by the leaders and notables of non-Muslim communities in the region so that the official version of the events could be more convincingly presented to the representatives of the Great Powers. The Ottoman government sent copies of these documents to the Ottoman embassies in European capitals via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of the government efforts to refute critical foreign press coverage and make the Ottoman case before the European public. It should also be noted that these letters and declarations were widely published in the Ottoman press.\n\n30On the other hand, to render Armenian revolutionaries responsible for these violent outbreaks is to suppose a great deal of influence and power on the part of Armenian political organizations, which there is ample reason to doubt. A revolutionary organization that was as threatening as portrayed in official narratives would require a resistance equivalent to the power attributed to it by the Ottoman authorities. Apart from the assassination attempt on a former governor-general of Van in Trabzon and the intensification of Armenian revolutionary activities in a number of locations on the eve of widespread riots, there were no signs of strong revolutionary activity and organization anywhere that could be blamed for provocative actions, let alone preparations for a coordinated Armenian rebellion across the eastern provinces in the fall of 1895. On the contrary, evidence suggests that in many instances, the anti-Armenian massacres were made possible by the lack or weakness of Armenian revolutionary organizations and armed self-defense capacity.\n\nThe Riots of Sivas: Official Language and Discourses of “Vengeance” and “Provocation” in a Case Study\n\n38As a matter of fact, not one of these aforementioned events explain the specific timing of the riots. Evidently, the Governor-General of Sivas sought to situate the violence of Muslim crowds in a logical, understandable framework, retrospectively linking the past events to the outbreak of the anti-Armenian carnage in the town. Indeed, openly stating that the violence was driven by an act of revenge with “rage beyond measure” (derecesiz galeyan), he implied that the action of the Muslims was understandable to a certain extent, if disproportionate, unfortunate, and unacceptable. In fact, not only in the Sivas case but also in every instance, the lethal and widespread anti-Armenian riots were justified by the Ottoman authorities and those who participated in or supported the violence as political vengeance for the “seditious” activities of the Armenians – perceived or real.\n\n40On the other hand, it should be noted that like several other high-ranking provincial administrators, Governor-General Halil Bey often openly spoke about the serious threats that the current situation posed to government authority, public security, and civil tranquility not only in his province but also across the whole eastern provinces. In one of his above-mentioned reports, for instance, he expressed his concern about the potentially negative effects of negligence on the part of the government towards the suppression of disorders and the punishment of Muslims involved in the incidents by frankly saying:\n\n43 Y.PRK.UM. 33/109 (17 November 1895). Original quotation: “Şu kadar ki efrad-ı Müslimenin bu hareket (...)\n\nIf such actions of the Muslims are not immediately put to an end with every precaution, and, when needed, even with armed forces and severe legal and political punishment, the government will seem to be a mere spectator, a condition which, as stated before, may lead to foreign intervention. A disruption of government authority due to the ongoing situation may also cause the disobedience of the Kurds and the like.\n\n42Not only the huge disparity between Armenian and Muslim losses but also the aforementioned statements of the governor-general unequivocally indicate that what happened in the town of Sivas on 12 November 1895 was an indiscriminate, deadly attack by a group of people on another, not necessarily wholly planned and well-organized but deliberate, politically motivated, and calculative. Even though the precipitating event, if any, is still unclear, it was an episode of extreme violence inflicted upon the Armenians by a Muslim crowd that took place in the context of the anti-Armenian riots of the fall of 1895. Even if we suppose that it was indeed a number of Armenians who triggered the violence, it is evident that the attack was used as a pretext for the local Muslims to kill Armenians indiscriminately and en masse. The Muslim crowd did not simply punish the reported provocateurs but targeted the collective identity and existence of Armenians.\n\n44Foreign sources, particularly the first-hand accounts received from local observers by British consular officials, present stark contrasts to Ottoman official reports and claims with regard to the outbreak of the riots and the conduct of the local officials during the events in the town of Sivas. It seems that for British consular officials, the main source of information concerning the events in Sivas was the U.S. consul resident in the center of this province. We understand that the British consul at Trabzon, Longworth, and U.S. Consul Jewett exchanged letters throughout this period. In what follows, I present an account of the outbreak in the town of Sivas as reflected in Jewett’s letters extracted by British Consul Longworth in his dispatches to the British Embassy at the Ottoman capital."
