        "text": "In the summer of 1894, the Armenians of several villages in Sasun, a region in the Ottoman province of Bitlis, refused to pay government taxes unless the state protected them from the extortion and illegal taxation levied by local Kurdish chieftains. The provincial authorities magnified the protest into a “rebellion” and requested assistance from the army. With the army’s interference, the incident ended with the massacre of the civilian population which marked the first incident of mass violence against Armenians of the Ottoman Empire. The calculation of fatalities remained unsatisfactory until the time of preparation of this study. By examining fatality data from a range of sources broader than that employed by prior research and by structuring the data into a discernible and informative format, this study revisits the number of victims with an analysis of constraints and a formulation of estimates.\n\nThis article explores the Bitlis massacre of 1895 and its aftermath with a particular focus on the role of local actors and Ottoman state elite in shaping the unfolding of this event. Through an in-depth examination of archival documents, it emphasizes the importance of local networks and dynamics in shaping the developments on the ground. Exploring the differences in the approaches of local and central Ottoman officials and political elites towards the treatment of the initiators of the massacre, the article reveals that there were explicit disputes among Ottoman authorities which were seemingly resolved after the Sultan Abdülhamid II imposed his will and ensured total impunity for the local perpetrators.\n\nThe eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire witnessed numerous massacres of Armenians between 1894 and 1897. Although some specialists have studied the origins, dynamics, extent, and repercussions of massacres in the eastern vilayets, few have studied events in the region of Cilicia (southern Anatolia). Drawing upon primary sources from Ottoman Turkish, Armenian, British, and missionary archives, as well as memoirs and personal papers, this article explores the massacres of 1895 in the district of Aintab.\n\nRonald Grigor Suny’s << “They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else”: A History of the Armenian Genocide>> and Fatma Muge Goc¸ek’s <<Denial of Violence: Ottoman Pasts, Turkish Presents, and Collective Violence against the Armenians, 1789–2009>> join a host of books published during the centennial observations of that genocide. These two books, however, are also something much more. Suny and Goc¸ek formed the collegial bond at the center of a decade-long movement to bring high research standards and a strong sense of professionalism to the study of one of the most brutal moments of twentieth century history.\n\nMicro-historical investigation of the 1895 massacres in two rural districts of the Ottoman vilayet of Bitlis, Hizan and Şirvan. It builds on the assumption that wider issues can be better understood through a close study within a limited geographical frame, one that enables an identification of the various sectors, local and external. The article contains a village by village count of the number of the victims and an investigation of the perpetrators and their motives. Though the number of victims was considerably lower than often assumed it is demonstrated that the massacres were a traumatic experience and a terrible economic blow for the Christian population (Armenians, Assyrians) of the area and an important step in the kurdification of the region. a correction (footnote 3, p.126) It should be remarked that the characterisation of Edip Gölbaşı's article, \"1895-1896 katliamları: Doğu Vilayetlerinde cemaatler arasında \"şiddet iklimi\" ve Ermeni karşıtı ayaklanmalar\" (2015) (\"E. Gölbaşı presents a summary of events based largely on my articles\") that did appear in the printed version of the article does not do justice to the range of sources employed by the author. For Turkish readers this overview article is recommended as an introduction to the 1895-1896 massacres."
