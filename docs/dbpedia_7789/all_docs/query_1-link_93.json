        "text": "This thesis examines Darülfünun Konferansları which consists of a series of lectures that were delivered by Salih Zeki in 1914 – 1915 in Ottoman State. These lectures were on geometry, its history and especially on the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries. And the purpose of this thesis is to propose the sufficiency and the legitimacy of these lectures as an account on the history of geometry. As a preliminary to analyzing Salih Zeki’s lectures, different views on geometry’s history and progress will be an...
