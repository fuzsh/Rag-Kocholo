        "text": "Today in History – 9 September\n\nTurkish cavalrymen enter İzmir\n\nFacing an unexpected defeat at the Great Offensive, the dispersed Greek army began retreating to the West after the Battle of Dumlupınar. As Mustafa Kemal Pasha said, this was not the pulling back of troops but a total “retreat.” Following the victory, the Turkish army moved rapidly and reached İzmir on the morning of September 9, 1922.\n\nThe Turkish troops entered the city in three sections under the command of Ahmet Zeki Bey (Soydemir), Mürsel Pasha (Bakü), and Colonel Suphi (Kula). They were followed by troops under the command of 5th Cavalry Corps Commander Major General Fahrettin Pasha. Once the Turkish flag was hoisted at the Government Mansion and Kadifekale with cheerful demonstrations by festive crowds, İzmir was officially liberated after three years, three months and twenty-four days.\n\nSeptember 9th assumed its place among momentous days not only as the date on which İzmir was reclaimed from the enemy, but a day in which a country on the verge of annihilation won its war of independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal.\n\nCommander in Chief Mustafa Kemal announced the liberation of İzmir with this historic message to his armies:\n\nI appreciate, with respect and admiration, the resilience and selflessness the armies have shown in attaining my first target: the Mediterranean. I extend my most sincere thanks and congratulations to my esteemed friends, who are the creators of this great victory. I am certain that the armies will show the same dedication in reaching the new targets they will be assigned."
