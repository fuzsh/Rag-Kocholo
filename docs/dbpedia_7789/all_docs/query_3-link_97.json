It has enabled the Turkish general\n\nstaff to surprise European observers with their preparations.\n\nMilitary critics who are watching events from afar incline to the\n\nbelief that for the present news from the front is being regulated in\n\norder to sustain the enthusiasm of Sofia and Belgrade.\n\nGreek and Turkish forces met at Elassona, at the foot of Mount\n\nOlympus. A bayonet charge, followed by a charge of cavalry, drove\n\nthe Turks from a strong position and cost them several guns.\n\nTurkey is said to contemplate an advance into Bulgaria through\n\nEgri Palanka, a border town at present occupied by Bulgarians and\n\nServians.\n\nA white-flag incident is reported from Prepolatz. It cost 200\n\nMoslem Albanians their lives.\n\nLONDON, Oct. 21.\n\nThe Greek and Turkish armies have\n\ncome into conflict for the first time since the\n\ndeclaration of war. The engagement proved\n\na victory for the forces of King George I.\n\nSome of the Montenegrin successes are\n\nbeing denied by the Turkish War Office,\n\nbut similar reports continue to come from\n\nPodgoritza.\n\nAn early winter is inflicting hardships\n\nupon the rival armies. The weather is cold,\n\nnone Help\n\nand heavy rains have made roads impassable\n\nin many districts.\n\nAPPEAL TO GREAT BRITAIN.\n\n\"GIGANTIC STRUGGLE\" FEARED.\n\nMr. M. H. Donohoe, the well-known Aus-\n\ntralian war correspondent, is representing\n\nthe \"Daily Chronicle\" at Constantinople.\n\nIn an interview which he had with Kiamil\n\nPasha, the President of the Council, said:—\n\n\"Turkey fears the intervention of a certain\n\nGreat Power in her Asian provinces which\n\nare now undefended. She appeals to Great\n\nBritain to see that the ring is not rushed,\n\nand Turkey absolutely crushed, as the pre-\n\nlude to a gigantic struggle involving\n\nEurope.\"\n\nThe Financial Secretary to the Treasury\n\n(Mr. C. F. G. Masterman), at Bethnal\n\nGreen on Saturday, made a strong anti-\n\nTurkish speech. He declared that if Great\n\nBritain had another opportunity for inter-\n\nvention, she must not, as in 1878, \"put her\n\nmoney on the wrong horse.\"\n\nThe ex-Sultan, Abdul Hamid, is to be re-\n\nmoved from the Villa Allatini at Salonika,\n\nin which he had been confined since he was\n\ndeposed in 1908, and housed in the Dolma\n\nBaghche Palace, near Constantinople, where\n\nhis brother, the present Sultan, was a pri-\n\nsoner for many years. The \"Tanin,\" the\n\norgan of the Young Turks, violently attacks\n\nthe Government for proposing to transfer\n\nAbdul from Salonika, which is the head-\n\nquarters of the revolutionaries of 1908, con-\n\nstitutes a national danger.\n\n[Mr. Masterman's speech at Bethnal\n\nGreen—which will probably be denied the\n\nimportance of a Ministerial utterance—re-\n\ncalls a remarkable confession by the late\n\nLord Salisbury, when replying to the debate\n\non the Address-in-Reply in the House of\n\nLords in 1897. To expressions of discon-\n\ntent with the position in the Near East,\n\nwhere Armenian massacres had been fre-\n\nquent, Lord Salisbury said:—\"Both politi-\n\ncal parties in Parliament have been mis-\n\ntaken in their Eastern policy. Both parties\n\nhave put their money on the wrong horse.\n\nIt would have been wiser in 1853 to have\n\naccepted the proposals of Russia than to\n\nhave adopted the policy which led to the\n\nCrimean war. It would be difficult to re-\n\nverse that policy; but by not doing so Great\n\nBritain has practically alienated Russia, and\n\nwithout her it will be impossible to act\n\neffectively in the East. The best course,\n\ntherefore, is to ensure the action of the\n\nPowers in concert, and, if necessary, to\n\npledge them to use force to coerce the Sul-\n\ntan. Unless essential reforms are adopted,\n\nthe doom of the Turkish Empire cannot\n\nbe much longer delayed.\" In 1878, the\n\ndate mentioned by Mr. Masterman, Great\n\nBritain entered into a secret defensive al-\n\nliance with Turkey, by which, if Russia\n\nacquired certain territory in Turkey in Asia,\n\nshe would join the Sultan in defending his\n\ndominions, he engaging to reform his Go-\n\nvernment. The ancient Kiamil Pasha's ap-\n\npeal, in which reference is made to \"a cer-\n\ntain great power and Asian provinces,\"\n\nwould hardly find a sympathiser in Mr.\n\nMastrman.]\n\nGREEK BAYONET CHARGE.\n\nYOUNG PRINCE'S BAPTISM.\n\nA hot engagement is reported from Elas-\n\nsona, the Turkish town at the foot of\n\nMount Olympus, which the Greek army\n\nmade its objective from the moment that\n\nit crossed the northern frontier. Six thou-\n\nsand Turks, with seven siege guns, took up\n\na position on the heights behind Elassona,\n\nand attempted to hold the town against\n\nfive Greek divisions.\n\nA preliminary duel ensued during the\n\nmorning, in which the new Schneider-Canet\n\nguns took part. The inflicted great\n\nhavoc.\n\nAt 2 o'clock in the afternoon Crown\n\nPrince Constantinos ordered the first divi-\n\nsion of the Greek force to charge with\n\nbayonets fixed. The Turks offered a desper-\n\nate resistance, but the Greek cavalry dashed\n\nin among them and completed their discom-\n\nfiture.\n\nIn the meanwhile the second division had\n\nbeen clearing the hills, threatening to cut\n\noff the retreat of the enemy. The Turks\n\nwithdrew through Stone Gates, a heavily\n\nfortified defile, leaving 80 prisoners and\n\nseven guns.\n\nThe Crown Prince's eldest son, Prince\n\nGeorge, who is 22 years of age, received\n\nhis baptism of fire at the engagement.\n\nGreece announces that her fleet is estab-\n\nlishing a blockade of the Adriatic Sea, from\n\nthe island of Corfu and the entrance to the\n\nGulf of Arta.\n\nThe Pan-Hellenic Union has collected\n\n500,000 drachma (about £20,000) to defray\n\nthe cost of transportation of 6,000 Greek re-\n\nservists in the United States, who are too\n\npoor to return otherwise. In addition,\n\n2,000 are paying their own fares.\n\nTHE GATHERING ARMIES.\n\nThousands on the March.\n\nCorrespondents of \"The Times\" at Con-\n\nstantinople and Salonika supply valuable\n\ninformation regarding the strength and dis-\n\nposition of the Sultan's forces. The corre-\n\nspondent at Constantinople states that\n\nthere will be 700,000 Turks with the colours\n\nat the end of October. Twelve thousand\n\ntroops are daily passing along the European\n\nrailway, on the section from Constantinople\n\nto Adrianople, irrespective of the infantry\n\ndespatched by the marching routes. \"Bul-\n\ngaria gave Turkey an unexpected ten days'\n\nbreathing space,\" adds the correspondent,\n\n\"thus enabling the Turkish general to sur-\n\nprise European observers.\"\n\nAccording to estimates of the Salonika\n\ncorrspondent, the Turkish army in Mace-\n\ndonia numbers 170,000. Hassan Rami Pasha.\n\nan ex-Minister, and Tahsim Pasha, formerly\n\nfirst secretary to the ex-Sultan, Abdul\n\nHamid, who have 30,000 of total, are en-\n\ngaged in defending the Greek frontier.\n\nAlinibar Pasha is commanding a force of\n\n40,000 on the Struma River, an important\n\nposition about 60 miles to the north-east of\n\nSalonika, while the balance of the troops—\n\nnumbering 100,000—are operating under\n\nZeki Pasha, former Grand Master of the\n\nArtillery, between Koprili and Uskub. The\n\ndistance between these two points, which\n\nare well-known stations on the same railway,\n\nis about 30 miles, Kopiril being due south\n\nof Uskub. The troops are being rapidly\n\naugmented by the Redifs (second line of de-\n\nfence) from Asia Minor.\n\nDELAY SUITED TURKEY.\n\nCommenting on the position generally,\n\nthe correspondent says:—\"The fortnight's\n\ndelay cost the allies dear. Zeki Pasha is ex-\n\npected to fight his way to Sofia, via Egri-\n\nPalanka, a town in the Uskub province,\n\nclose to the Bulgarian border, where he will\n\nbe assisted by 40,000 Albanian irregulars.\n\nThe commissariat of the western army is in\n\ndifficulty, owing to the failure of the har-\n\nvest, and the situation in the Macedonian\n\nvillages is pitiful, as a result of the shortage\n\nof food.\"\n\nFollowing upon the statement of \"The\n\nTimes\" correspondent regarding the pro-\n\nposed Turkish march through Egri Palanka\n\ninto Bulgaria, comes a report from Sofia\n\nthat the Bulgarians and Servians, in con-\n\njunction, captured Egri Palanka and occu-\n\npied several railway bridges before the\n\nTurks were able to carry out their plans to\n\nblow them up.\n\nA body of 120000 Servians has crossed\n\nthe frontier into Turkish territory.\n\nTACTICS CRITICISED.\n\nThe Viennese military writers think that\n\nthe Turks are mistaken in concentrating at\n\nAdrianople. The real objective of the Bal-\n\nkan allies, they say, is the port of Salonika,\n\nwhich the Servian, Montenegrin, and Greek\n\narmies will attempt to capture, while the\n\nBulgarians will be employed in checking\n\nthe Turks at Adrianople.\n\nMilitary critics who are watching de-\n\nvelopments from London point out in the\n\npress that none of the correspondents has\n\nbeen allowed yet to go to the front. They\n\nare inclined to believe that much of the\n\nwar news published is intended to sustain\n\nthe warlike enthusiasm of the populace in\n\nBelgrade and Sofia, and to deceive the\n\nenemy.\n\nThe \"Morning Post\" critic estimates\n\nfrom reports to hand that the 170,000 Turk-\n\nish troops and 412 guns between Adrianople\n\nand Kirk Kilisse, are faced by 270,000 Bul-\n\ngarians, including guards in charge of\n\ncommunications, and 788 guns. The Turkish\n\nfortress at Kirk Kilisse has been sur-\n\nrounded since Saturday.\n\nBULGARIAN SUCCESS.\n\nADVANCE ON ADRIANOPLE.\n\nThe success of the Bulgarian army in their\n\nfirst big engagement on Turkish soil—that\n\nat Mustapha Pasha, 20 miles east of\n\nAdrianople—is told in greater detail in a\n\nmessage from Sofia. On Friday evening\n\nGeneral Ivanoff, at the head of the First\n\nArmy Corps, occupied the banks of the\n\nMaritza River, a waterway which is\n\nnavigable for small craft from the Ægean\n\nSea to Adrianople. To his surprise, he\n\nfound that the dispossessed Turkish troops\n\nhad left the bridge, the railway station, and\n\nthe telegraph office at Mustapha Pasha\n\npractically intact. On the following\n\nday he advanced beyond the town,\n\nand drove the Turks into the\n\nforts forming the water defences of\n\nAdrianople. The Second Army Corps, under\n\nGeneral Radko Dimitrieff, which forms the\n\nleft wing of the invading force, advanced\n\ndown the Tunja Valley, and captured Ter-\n\nnivo, an important market town, north of\n\nKirk Kilisse. The Third Army Corps, which\n\nis operating westward of Mustapha Pasha,\n\nis under General Kutincheff.\n\nVICTORY DISCOUNTED.\n\nOfficial accounts issued at Constantinople\n\nconcerning the movements of the Bulgarian\n\narmy, state that, on Friday, their forces\n\nattacked an inferior body of Turks at Kird-\n\nchah, due west of Adrianople, and that,\n\nafter several hours' fighting, the Bulgarians\n\nwere repulsed with serious loss. A counter\n\nattack was made by the Turks on Saturday,\n\nwhen they seized Harman, an important\n\nstrategic position on the top pf a moun-\n\ntain.\n\nIt is hard to realise that the theatrical\n\ngarb of the Balkan soldiers has disappeared\n\nentirely, and that the pictures of the pre-\n\nsent campaign will lose much of the colour\n\nand romance of those illustrating other\n\nwars. A \"Daily Mail\" correspondent, who\n\nwitnessed the Bulgarian army manœuvres\n\nlast month, writes:—\n\n\"The Bulgarian soldier is one of the first\n\nthings that strike you in Sofia. It is not the\n\nuniform that makes the impression, for his\n\nwhitey-brown linen smock, rough brown\n\ntrousers, and unpolished, heavy Wellington\n\nboots are as ugly as they are workmanlike.\n\nNor is it his bigness, nor his sun-tanned\n\nface. But there is an intelligence of ex-\n\npression and an alertness of bearing in the\n\ndrab companies that make you look at them\n\ntwice as they tramp by. This combination\n\nof the sturdiness of body and weather-\n\nbeaten face that are the marks of the coun-\n\ntry adds, with the brightness and interest of\n\nexpression that are usually the stamp of the\n\ntown, give you the whole secret of the Bul-\n\ngarian's excellence as war material. He\n\npossesses the strength of the country\n\ndweller without being a chawbacon, and the\n\nintelligence of the townsman without being\n\na weed.\"\n\nWHITE FLAG INCIDENT.\n\nCHRISTIANS FLOGGED.\n\nAn act of treachery by a number of Mos-\n\nlem Albanians is reported in a message\n\nfrom Belgrade. The allegation is that a\n\nband of Albanians retreated from Pre-\n\npolatz, on the German border, and hoisted\n\nthe white flag. The Servians ordered the\n\nguns to cease, whereupon the Albanians\n\nfired at and killed Captain Popovitch and 12\n\nmen. This act cost the Albanians many\n\nlives, for the Servian artillery at once re-\n\nopened fire, killing 200 of the Arnauts.\n\nA Bulgarian message charges the Turks\n\nwith having raided the Razlog, or Mehomia,\n\ndistrict of Seres, which is peopled chiefly by\n\nChristians, and arrested the Bulgarian not-\n\nables at the villages, for the release of\n\nwhom they demand a ransom of £300. Hun-\n\ndreds of villagers have been flogged by the\n\nMoslems.\n\nDr. Goldsmith and Dr. Bradford, two of\n\nthe Australians who are going to Mon-\n\ntenegro with the London Red Cross\n\nSociety's equipment, left on Sunday night.\n\nA second Red Cross unit for Montenegro\n\nwill go on Friday. Sir Ernest Cassel, the\n\nLondon financier, will defray the expense of\n\nsending three Red Cross units to Turkey.\n\nFIGHTING IN ALBANIA.\n\nMOSLEM FORCE AMBUSHED.\n\nPodgoritza accounts of events in the\n\nSanjak of Novibazar are all in favour of\n\nKing Nicholas's troops. Hassim Bey and\n\nMahmud Begovie, at the head of 2,000\n\nArnauts (Moslem Albanians) set out from\n\nPlava to march on Berane, which General\n\nVukotics captured last week. The force\n\nwas ambushed by the Montenegrins, and,\n\nafter a desperate fight, cut up. Hassim\n\nBey and 280 prisoners have been taken to\n\nPodgoritza. Encouraged by their success,\n\nthe Montenegrins marched on Plava, cap-\n\ntured the town, and subsequently captured\n\nGusinji, one of the most important centres\n\nin North Albania. It is 44 miles from\n\nScutari, and is an important base for opera-\n\ntions.\n\nWAR OFFICE DENIES REPORT.\n\nThe Turkish War Office denies that the\n\nMontenegrins captured six battalions of\n\nTurkish soldiers and eight quick-firing guns\n\nat Tuzi, on the road to Scutari, as reported\n\nfrom Cettigne last week. It explains that\n\n300 troops were send to Tuzi, which is an un-\n\nimportant border village without fortifica-\n\ntions, merely to watch the movements at\n\nthe enemy. When they were attacked in\n\nthe rear by Malissori tribesmen they re-\n\ntired, only their small rearguard and eight\n\nworthless guns falling into the hands of the\n\nChristian Albanians. The War Office also\n\nminimises the encounters on the Bulgarian\n\nfrontier, which are described as skirmishes\n\nonly.\n\nThe recruits flocking to the standard of\n\nSandansky, the Bulgarian bandit chief who\n\nkidnapped Miss Stone, the American mis-\n\nsionary, in 1902, are increasing daily. In\n\nPrin, a mountainous district, he has already\n\narmed 3,000 peasants with Mannlicher\n\nrifles.\n\nAt Comitajis, the Arnauts made a success-\n\nful ambush of 70 Servians, and killed them\n\nall.\n\nPEACE IN TRIPOLI.\n\nGENERAL REJOICINGS.\n\nTRIPOLI, Oct. 21.\n\nWhen it was first made known that peace\n\nhad been arranged between Turkey and\n\nItaly, gratification was expressed through-\n\nout the whole of Tripoli.\n\nOn Saturday there was a great demon-\n\nstration, the occasion being the formal de-\n\nclaration of peace. The proclamation was\n\nmade amid a scene of great pomp, and\n\nthere were general rejoicings, in which the\n\nnatives participated freely.\n\nTHE GREEK MOVEMENTS.\n\nMr. A. V. Maniachi, commenting last\n\nevening on the cable messages concerning\n\nthe war, said:—\n\n\"Epirus was allotted to Greece at the\n\nBerlin Conference in 1878. Turkey raised\n\nobjections, but, being pressed by Great\n\nBritain and Russia, consented to let Greece\n\nhave Thessaly, but kept Epirus. The ob-\n\nject of Greece in running the gunboats into\n\nthe Gulf of Arta was to gain control of the\n\nwaterway, and thus be in a position to pro-\n\ntect the transport of troops from Arta to\n\nEpirus by ships. It is possible that an\n\nattack may be made on the main Salonika\n\nrailway, and in this connection it is worth\n\nremembering that at Dede Aghatch the line\n\nis within range of a fleet. The engage-\n\nments near the Mehuna Pass, on the Greek\n\nfrontier, recall the agitation by Greece to\n\nhave the railway connected with the main\n\nEuropean system. The Greeks have\n\nbrought their line to the border at Larissa,\n\nsome distance to the south-west of Elas-\n\nsona, and they want a junction made with\n\nthe main line at Veria, the connecting line\n\nto run close to the Gulf of Salonika. The\n\nTurks, however, were anxious to have the\n\nline brought along a route further west,\n\nwhich would have been to their advantag"
