        "text": "To many people, the name Tim Berners-Lee may be an unfamiliar one. It certainly doesn’t carry the same recognition value among the general public as a Steve Jobs or a Mark Zuckerberg. But perhaps that should change—after all, if it wasn’t for Berners-Lee, you wouldn’t be able to read this biography about him on the Internet right now.\n\nBerners-Lee is a significant figure in the field of computer science thanks to his invention of the World Wide Web in 1989. However, this claim should be taken with a sizable grain of salt. It would be a stretch to say that Berners-Lee “invented” the Internet, as many of the basic mechanisms had existed for years. What Berners-Lee did was marry technologies like hypertext and information transfer in order to create the Internet we know today.\n\nIn 1980, Berners-Lee was working as an independent contractor for the European research organization CERN when he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext. Berners-Lee developed a prototype named ENQUIRE that would enable researchers posted in different locations to share and update information.\n\nIn 1990, Berners-Lee teamed up with Belgian engineer Robert Cailliau to produce the first web browser and web server for the World Wide Web. The original aim of the World Wide Web was to publish hypertext web pages that anyone could access. Many of the elements we commonly associate with the Internet today, such as URLs, HTML and HTTP, were put into place by Berners-Lee and Cailliau during this period.\n\nA few years later, in 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization he still runs to this day. The role of the W3C is to oversee Web standards and promote its development. This development was accelerated thanks in large part to Berners-Lee’s decision not to seek a patent for his creation. Because the Internet is free and open source, innovators were able to create and thereby expand the possibilities of what was and is possible."
