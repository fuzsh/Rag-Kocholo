There are a few stuff which don't work because it was the first time I made a video with Vimeo.\n\nVideo\n\nWho is Tim Berners-Lee?\n\nWhy is he famous?\n\nMore about his products\n\nAbout Tim Berners-Lee's family\n\nAbout Tim Berners-Lee's early life\n\nTim Berner-Lee's problems\n\nWho influed Tim Berner-Lee\n\nFamous quotes byTim Berner-Lee\n\nGame/quiz | Play\n\nTim Berners-Lee's presentation\n\nIndex\n\nWho was Tim Berners-Lee?\n\nSECTION 01\n\nAmerican politicians didn't like him because they wanted to sell the internet but Tim Berners-Lee told them that the internet should be free for everyone.\n\nTim Berners-Lee\n\nTim Berners-Lee was born in 08 Jun 1955 (age 65) in London, England (here we are)! He only has $10 million but if he sold the internet, his own creation, he could be the richest person in the world.\n\nWho was Tim Berners-Lee\n\nTim Berners-Leeand CERN\n\nTim Berners-Lee was the person who invented HTML as well as the world wide web, also known as www. He also developed the first web browser (just like Chrome (not Google)) or Get it browser (my own search engine), not Get it. The differences are that Chrome is an app with a search engine and Google is a website with a search engine. He also made CERN, where the internet was created.\n\nImages of Tim Berners-Lee\n\nWhy is Tim Berner-Lee famous?\n\nSECTION 02\n\nWhat we know\n\nYou can imagine that Tim Berner-Lee is already famous for just creating the internet and the first web browser as I mentioned before, but there are more stuff that Tim Berner-Lee is famous. For example his education, he studied in Oxford University and there he made friends...\n\nWhat we already know\n\nPsst, most developers know most of these programming languages.\n\nTim Berners-Lee is still the best data scientist in the entire world. He now knows C, C#, C++, Ruby, Ruby on rails, Java, Javascript, Node.js, Node.js express, Dart, Flutter, Jquery, Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5, HTML 5(he created), HTML, CSS 3, CSS, PHP, PHP cake...\n\nWhy is he famous NOW\n\nTim Berners-Lee, as I mentioned before, went to Oxford University. There he made many important contacts with other celebrities. There, his friends influenced him to learn programming and then, he had the idea of a shop on a computer and websites.\n\nWhat about education and famous?\n\nAbout his products\n\nSECTION 03\n\nCERN's Website\n\nFirst website in the world\n\nAbout CERN\n\nCERN was the company that Tim Berners-Lee created. Inside the CERN, there are many more products that Tim and his colleagues have created for example CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheet which is used to style HTML(we will see later).\n\nAbout The Internet\n\nThe internet, also known as the WWW was made by Tim Berners-Lee. The reason he created this is because he wanted to create a shop where everyone could access it on thier computer. That's how he had the idea of the internet. The internet works contains websites and web apps. He also invented https, http, ww2, www, htt7...\n\nAbout HTML\n\nHTML is the \"programming\" language he made. It is the simplest programming language in the world and massive results can happen in seconds. The lastest version of HTML is HTML 5 and the image you can see to your left, is it's logo. P.S: HTML is a Markup language.\n\nAbout A Markup Language\n\nA markup language is a programming language that can't be used for Data science, machine learning and adding functionality to your website. Markup languages are these very human readable languages. Another example of a markup language would be CSS and YAML(for Flutter).\n\nAbout his family\n\nSECTION 04\n\nAbout Tim Berners-Lee's Family\n\nHis mum was called Mary Lee Woods and she was a famous mathematician. She was born on the 12 March 1924, and died on the 29 November 2017.His father was called Conway Berners Lee and was born on the 10 September 1921, and died on the 01 Feb 2019. He was also a mathematician.\n\nEarly life\n\nSECTION 05\n\nAt School\n\nLike his mother and father, who were great mathematicians, Tim Berners-Lee is also great with maths which he inheretated from his parents.At school, he was the best student and also had a sociable life. All the children and teachers admired him.\n\nExtra Actvities\n\nWhen Tim Berners-Lee was little, he started to learn Javascript, MS Dos and Basic (based on MS Dos). He created some videogames which he sold for almost 1/2 a million EACH.He also learned piano and violin which he loved although he prefered learning MS Dos.Fun Fact: MS Dos is now the Command Line for web development and app development.\n\nWho influenced him?\n\nSECTION 07\n\nAn exception for geniuses\n\nMost people who have ended up being professional programmers or amazing, super famous celebrities in a sense of studying (not singing), have been inspired by themselves just like me and coding as well as mathematics. But not for Tim, his friends and family inspired him.\n\nFamily\n\nHis family always wanted him to change the future doing good things by using mathematics, as they were mathematicians. He actually thought that mathematics were good but he thought that computers were better. And although his family disagreed with that, they still told him to give it a go.\n\nFamous Quotes\n\nSECTION 08\n\nTim berners-lee\n\n\"The goal of the web was to serve people from the future to do thing they could have never imagined in thier lifes.\"\n\nTim berners-lee\n\n\"You affect the world by what you browse.\"\n\nTim berners-lee\n\n\"The web as I envigsaed it, we have not seen yet the future and the present is so much bigger than the past\"\n\nFinal Hangman Quiz Game\n\nSECTION 09\n\nBoth\n\nWWW\n\nWhat did Tim Berners-Lee invent?\n\nHTML\n\nQuestion 1\n\nMary\n\nMaria\n\nWhat was his mums first name?\n\nMaddy\n\nQuestion 2\n\nMathematitian\n\nInvestor\n\nBank\n\nWhat did his father work as?\n\nMathematitian\n\nQuestion 3\n\nWhat Programming language/s did he learn?\n\nboth\n\nJs\n\nMS Dos\n\nQuestion 4\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nHangman\n\nBy Marc Alifanov Diaz 2021\n\nAny Questions?\n\nThank you!\n\nThe End!"
