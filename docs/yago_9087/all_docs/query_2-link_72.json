        "text": "Twenty-five years ago today at a Swiss research company, a man named Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system that would make it easier to share research papers among colleagues.\n\nThe idea -- called \"vague, but exciting\" by his boss and the \"World Wide Web\" by everyone else-- grew into a system that has forever changed life on Earth.\n\nBerners-Lee's Web was built to share research info by piggybacking on a system of interlinked hypertext documents. That system is known as the Internet.\n\nWhile most people use the terms interchangeably, the World Wide Web is not the Internet. The Internet allows information to be shared by connecting billions of computers around the world. It's not the platform for posting cat videos.\n\nCat videos would be the purview of the World Wide Web.\n\nActually, the Web is an application that uses the Internet to share such vital info as what you had for dinner and photos of you shaming your dog.\n\nBut, we digress.\n\nHere is a video from Berners-Lee that gives you a little background on his invention.\n\nFrom the website\n\n, here are some facts about the Web you may not have known.\n\n1. Sir Berners-Lee is the son of British mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, who worked on the first commercially-built electronic computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.\n\n2. In college, Sir Berners-Lee built a computer out of an old television set.\n\n3. The web was not Sir Berners-Lee's first design for a system to link information. In 1980 he wrote ENQUIRE. The name came from a Victorian era how-to book called Enquire Within Upon Everything owned by Sir Berners-Lee's parents.\n\n4. Before settling on 'the web,' Sir Berners-Lee thought of the names 'Information Mesh', 'The Information Mine (TIM)', and 'Mine of Information'.\n\n5. The web was first described in a March 1989 proposal from Sir Berners-Lee while at CERN.\n\n6. Mike Sendall, Sir Berners-Lee's manager at the time, commented on the original proposal 'Vague, but exciting.'\n\nFor the rest of the facts, there's 25, click here.\n\nSomething else that has grown out of Berners-Lee's invention is Twitter. Here are some tweets commemorating the anniversary. Ironically, or maybe not, most are commemorating the birthday of the Internet. Again, it's the Web's birthday.\n\nAnyhoo, here are a few tweets:\n\nFrom\n\n, the top World Wide Web site, and another application, Storify,\n\nto read memories of the early days of the Web."
