In 2004, Tim Berners-Lee was knighted when he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for tremendous contributions towards the formation of the World Wide Web. He is also one of the few people who was in favor of Net Neutrality and has expressed the view that ISPs should supply connectivity without any restrictions.\n\nTim Tebow was born in Manila,Philippines on August 14, 1987. He wasn't meant to be born though. They thought he was going to kill his mom while being born. So his mom and dad went to an American trained doctor in the Philippines to help give birth and it all worked out, his mom did not die and he was born.\n\nIn the 1990’s, an invention was created that is now used in everyday life, The World Wide Web also known as the WWW. In the year of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web.It was invented in the United States and was later released to the public in 1991. The World Wide Web has become very important and people could not imagine a life without it. Overall, the World Wide Web has become very important to the world (Tim Berners-Lee).\n\nTim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, was born on June 8, 1955 and is known for revolutionizing at the basic level world wide communications, but on a greater whole civilization as we know it. Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web. In 1989, while Lee was working at CERN(A european organization for nuclear research) he proposed the idea of an information distribution system to help connect the CERN employees to each other.\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee was born June 8th, 1955 in London, England and was one of the four children to Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. Tim Berners-Lee is known and credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Both of Tim Berners-Lee’s “parents worked on the first commercially-built computer” the Ferranti Mark I, which helped influence him into studying mathematics and science growing up as a child (Tim Berners-Lee Biography, n.d.). Tim attended Sheen Mount Primary School and then went on to study at Emanuel School in London, England. He then later went on to graduate in 1976 from Queen’s College of the University of Oxford with a first-class degree in physics. Soon after graduation, he received employment at a printing firm “Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, Dorset, England” (Dennis, 2014). He then eventually met his first wife Jane Northcote a fellow programmer who also studied at Oxford University. However, this relationship ended soon after. He then eventually left Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. and went on to work at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as CERN in Switzerland as a consultant software engineer where he built the first prototype of a hypertext program called ‘ENQUIRE’. In July 1990 Tim Berners-Lee married his second wife Nancy Carlson, who was an American computer programmer who he met while working at CERN. Together Berners-Lee and Carlson had two children together. Again, this marriage did not last long and"
