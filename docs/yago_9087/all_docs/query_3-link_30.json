        "text": "Astrophysicist and City Tech Professor of Physics Viviana Acquaviva has released a new book, 'Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy,' which provides a hands-on introduction to machine learning and its applications to the physical sciences. \"I am so glad to see this book finally published. I have been teaching a class on this topic at City Tech since 2018, and I started from scratch - we built this content, together with students and with the help of colleagues, bit by bit. I especially want to recognize the contribution of Dr. Ashwin Satyanarayana from the Computer Systems Technology department. I hope this textbook and the supplementary materials can help students in formal programs and self-learners, as well as colleagues who are developing similar classes.\" - Dr. Viviana Acquaviva Read more about it ðŸ‘‰ https://ow.ly/Ppbr50Qi1y0 #CityTechNews #CityTech\n\nAnother way to bring a STEM classroom (online or brick-and-mortar) alive is to have the class stay abreast of current events in science, math, technology, and engineering. This really helps to show students that they're not learning the math and science skills just to study things that happened three hundred years ago. They're learning the skills because they can be applied to exciting and fun things that are happening right now. For example, a record-breaking black hole was discovered two weeks ago. This one news story is 25 math, science, and technology lessons just waiting to happen. https://lnkd.in/d7UCYuqg\n\nCan you still remember that experiment or moment that brought you closer to your today's occupation? We often forget that gaining deep knowledge comes with the obligation to inspire others about the fascinating subjects that modern science has brought to light. Recently, I had the privilege of joining some friends in conducting a 90-minute lesson for fourth graders on the captivating world of physics. As we embarked on this adventure, memories of my own journey into the field resurfaced, reminding me of the importance of passing on the torch of knowledge to the next generation. One of the highlights of the session was the water rocket experiment, where we launched rockets into the sky, captivating the young minds with the principles of propulsion and Newton's laws of motion. The joy and wonder in their eyes were a testament to the power of hands-on learning experiences. One friend, Moritz Knorr, unlocked the magic of light composition. With meticulous precision, he deftly separated white light into its dazzling constituents â€” the brilliant blues, the radiant yellows, and the fiery reds. Yet, the true marvel lay in his orchestration of their reunion, blending these spectral fragments back into the familiar, pure white light. Another friend, Emil Schreiber , took a different approach and engaged the pupils in a thrilling challenge. He encouraged them to guess the curve of fastest descent of a ball in a gravity field between two fixed points, where the starting point was higher than the end point. The solution to this intriguing problem is known as the \"brachistochrone curve.\" To our surprise, some of the pupils' guesses came remarkably close to the actual solution, showcasing their curiosity and intuition. Let's come together to bridge the gap between scientific discoveries and young minds, fostering a generation of innovators, dreamers, and thinkers who will shape the future of our world: #InspiringTheNextGeneration #ScienceEducation #PhysicsExploration #CuriosityFuelsProgress\n\nðŸŒŒ Diving Deep into Physics, Mathematics, and Beyond ðŸš€ Attention researchers, scholars, and innovators!
