Tim Berners-Lee is a well-known computer scientist. He, alongside Robert Cailliau, invented The World Wide Web(WWW). He is currently a computer scientist at the University of Oxford and a professor at MIT.\n\nImage From Curiokids\n\nFamily and Education\n\nTim Berners-Lee was born on the 8th of June 1955 in London, England. His mother is Mary Lee Woods and his father is Conway Berners-Lee. They were Computer Scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer. Tim Berners-Lee has three siblings. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School and Southwest London’s Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973. He learned about electronics from playing around with model trains. He attended The Queen’s College, Oxford from 1973 to 1976. He obtained a first-class Bachelor Of Arts Degree In Physics.\n\nImage From Wikipedia\n\nImage From Wikipedia\n\nCareer\n\nAfter he graduated, he went to work as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey. Then in 1978, he joined the company D.G. Nash in Ferndown, where he assisted to create typesetting software for printers. From June to December 1980, he worked as an independent contractor at CERN. While he was in Geneva, he presented a project based on the idea of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among scientists. To illustrate, he built a prototype system named “ENQUIRE”. After he left CERN in the late 1980s, he went to work at John Poole’s Image Computer Systems, LTD. Later with the help of Robert Cailliau, used the ENQUIRE system that Tim made, to create the World Wide Web (WWW)."
