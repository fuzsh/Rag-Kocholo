        "text": "WWW? World Wide Web? The Internet??? No, not the Internet; The World Wide Web (\"WWW\" or simply the \"Web\") is a global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as e-mail also does. The Internet dates back significantly further than World Wide Web.\n\nWho created World Wide Web?\n\nA certain somebody, called Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee O.M., to give his full name.\n\nThis somebody was born in London, England, and was one of four children born to Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. His parents worked on the first commercially-built computer. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, which became an independent school in 1975. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.\n\nStudying at The Queen's College, Oxford from 1973 to 1976, he received a first-class bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree in physics.\n\nAfter graduation, Tim Berners-Lee (aka TimBL) worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey, in Dorset. In 1978, he helped create type-setting software for printers.\n\nBerners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN (European Council for Nuclear Research) from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, Switzerland, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.\n\nAfter leaving CERN in late 1980, worked at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, in Bournemouth, Dorset.\n\nHe ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a \"real-time remote procedure call\" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.\n\nShortly after TimBL's return to CERN, TCP/IP protocols were installed on some key non-Unix machines at the institution, turning it into the largest Internet site in Europe within a few years. As a result, CERN's infrastructure was ready for Berners-Lee to create the Web.\n\nBerners-Lee wrote a proposal in March 1989 for \"a large hypertext database with typed links\". Although the proposal attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing his system on a newly acquired NeXT workstation. He considered several names, including Information Mesh, The Information Mine or Mine of Information, but finally settled on World Wide Web.\n\nSo you must be thinking, 'Well, surely someone who did such such a thing was awarded many honours?!'.\n\nNo?\n\nMaybe it's just me. Oh well.\n\nAnyway, TimBL was knighted in 2004 by H.M. Queen Elizabeth II, and later, in 2007, was awarded the Order of the Merit. He is one of 24 living people on the Earth, right now, who have the authority to use the suffix 'O.M.' after his name, as their can only be 24 recipients of the award at any one time.\n\nAlso, over the years, he has received over 50 different awards and honours- all of these starting from ever since his invention of WWW. A bit like the 'domino effect', but going on for around a decade..."
