        "text": "Whatever else 1955 is remembered for, it boasts two notable birthdays. That June, Timothy J. Berners-Lee popped into the world in London, and a few months later, William H. Gates III opened his eyes in Seattle. Gates went on to become the richest person on earth as head of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT ) Tim Berners-Lee might be giving Gates a run for the money, but he passed up his shot at fabulous wealth--intentionally--in 1990. That's when he decided not to patent the technology used to create the most important software innovation in the final decade of the 20th century: the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee wanted to make the world a richer place, not amass personal wealth. So he gave his brainchild to us all.\n\nNow, the idealistic father of the Web plans an even grander gift: a next-generation Web that almost certainly will rank as the most important software of this decade. Berners-Lee regards today's Web as a rebellious adolescent that can never fulfill his original expectations. By 2005, he hopes to begin replacing it with the Semantic Web--a smart network that will finally understand human languages and make computers virtually as easy to work with as other humans."
