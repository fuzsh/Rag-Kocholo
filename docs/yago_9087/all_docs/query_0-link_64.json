        "text": "In the last 24 hours, chances are high that you’ve checked Facebook, sorted through countless emails, or watched a favorite television show on your laptop. Internet usage statistics continue to skyrocket, even in the developing world where the Internet use is rapidly becoming commonplace. In the midst of all this Internet growth stands the World Wide Web. Towering from one side of the world to the other, the World Wide Web is the primary means of accessing the worldwide information superhighway. We use it to access our bank accounts, read the day’s news, and share photos with friends—tasks that would still require trips to the teller, ink-smudged fingers, and stamped envelopes, if not for Tim Berners-Lee and his magnificent invention.\n\nIf you ever encounter Berners-Lee, you wouldn’t likely imagine him to be the creator of the World Wide Web. Roughly dressed in a suit jacket and an unbuttoned shirt, you would most likely find him hunched over his computer. “He is a great visionary, but not actually always that good at explaining it,” says computer science professor and Berners-Lee colleague Wendy Hall. “He is very technical, and always happiest when talking to other techies. All he really wants to do is write code, but now he has to go and meet world leaders and business people.”\n\nTimothy John Berners-Lee grew up in the shadows of two technological giants. His parents, Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, first met in a small computer room at the University of Manchester. Both ingenious programmers had been working feverishly on the Mark 1, one of the first program-storing computers. Almost at once, the pair forged a lasting relationship through their relentless work ethic and shared interests. And as computer junkies-turned-parents, they would each play integral roles in the development of their son Timothy.\n\nAfter marriage, the two moved into a small part of London known as East Sheen. Born on June 8, 1955, Tim soon developed an interest in the daily tasks his parents completed. But his interests became much broader than the digital devices his parents worked with each day. Living in London, a metropolis of steel building and busy factories, Tim was blessed spend his childhood in a suburban part of the city. Tim became a religious picnicker and enjoyed taking trips to the park next to his home. He \"loved the fresh air and freedom of these outings,\" and these early ventures would influence his future. As soon as Tim could walk, he took the trip to his parents' workplace almost every day. The machinery and contraptions that towered over Tim at that time simply astounded him. His wild imagination grew to include computers and programming. Around Tim's time, computer technology was in its infancy, and programs were \"punched\" into small strips of paper before being fed into a machine. Back home, Tim ran amuck with this newly discovered paper. He eagerly built his own computers using cardboard and programming papers. He had no access to television as a child, so his imagination kicked in. He remembers being an avid reader of science fiction since his days before grammar school. His creative spirit developed gradually, and his childhood ventures would prove to play a major part in the development of his adult self. He was often given random mechanical gifts: a train set here, or another part of his mechanical dog there. Tim played with these items, and soon realized that it wasn't the functions of the machines that he was interested in, but rather the machines themselves that captivated him.\n\nIn grammar school Tim’s academic potential began to be recognized by his teachers. He entered a rigorous educational program and still managed to ace all of his classes, including several that had been added to his schedule without warning. It was also at Emmanuel School that he rediscovered his love for the outdoors. He would frequently visit nearby mountains and hills in order to enjoy hikes that challenged him physically. What set apart Tim from his peers at Emmanuel was his gravitation toward analytical activities and after acing most of his classes at the Emmanuel School, Tim’s interest in his parents’ profession became much more serious than construction toy computers in the family’s living room.\n\nUniversity\n\nIn 1973, Tim enrolled in Queen’s College, University of Oxford, and started his major in theoretical physics. His time in the university would prove to be one of the most mentally challenging periods of time in his life. As he progressed through the demanding courses at Oxford, his appointed tutor, John Moffatt, helped him understand the seemingly perpetual maze of physics. While a college student, Tim continued to pursue his love of the outdoors and was a member of the school’s world-renowned rowing team. And like many college students, Tim got himself into his fair share of trouble. He once managed to get banned from using the university’s only computer room. Tim had been printing out massive amounts of flyers to help promote various philanthropic and charitable events—efforts that went unnoticed by university administrators until the two caused a system crash. An angry teacher immediately stormed over to a computer and deleted their names as authorized users.\n\nBut this small setback prepared Tim for something even larger that was yet to come. Without access to the university’s computer, he immediately set to work in building his own machine out of spare parts. This proved to be a defining moment in Tim Burner-Lee’s life. He painstakingly assembled his first computer using a spare TV monitor, microscopic computer parts, a car battery, and spare calculator parts. At a time when computers were very expensive to purchase and extremely hard to build, Tim was ingeniously able to create his own. “Whatever the device you use for getting your information out, it should be the same information,” Tim would often say. His wasn’t necessarily a picky individual, and would most often mold to anything that fit his needs. This experience in his university years would later provide inspiration for an even greater accomplishment—inventing the World Wide Web.\n\nGraduation and CERN\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oxford with a first-degree in physics, Tim set off to make his way in the world in 1976. At this point, he clearly knew his future job would have to involve computers, so he immediately began applying for various positions that utilized his programming skills. Tim’s first job out of college was a software engineer at Plessey Telecommunications. Located in Poole, England, Tim spent roughly two years writing and editing programs for the former communications giant. He was then recruited by his old friend Kevin Rogers for a software job a few miles from his current workplace. “Tim, there’s work here for two.” Kevin told his friend. At his new job, Tim began to take advantage of the rapidly progressing computer technology available to him and said the experience was “like riding the crew of a wave.”\n\nAfter a while, Tim grew discontented with his limited work for other companies and decided to become an independent software consultant. At this point, computers were gaining momentum. Tim was exactly at the right time and right place for his profession. In 1979, while on a business trip to Switzerland, his friend Kevin Rogers contacted him again. This time, Kevin convinced Tim to take a job at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), the world’s largest physics particle lab. This decision would be one of the most important decisions Tim would ever make. Tim made it through the interview with flying colors, and was immediately hired for a six-month post. At CERN, Tim encountered a problem that would define a technological era. He had an immensely hard time keeping track of every piece of information that had been filed away in his system. His mind started wandering to find solutions for this problem.\n\nThis problem kept nagging Tim during every task he took on, and he immediately set out to find a solution. In less than a month, Tim developed a program that was different from the one currently in use by CERN. The new program connected pages randomly instead of using a tediously hierarchical structure. He named this new program ENQUIRE, after an old book his parents had had. After extensive planning, creating ENQUIRE had been relatively easy. Tim’s new design even helped people “accidentally” discover new information. Overall, it was near perfection, and almost any individual could access information using Tim’s new program. His inventive spirit would continue to demonstrate itself. After completing his assignments from his boss, he would hurry to perfect his coding skills. Tim hurried to write a program that allowed ENQUIRE to work on remote computers, but at that time it was hard for computers to communicate and transfer data between each other. In the 1970s, the Internet was very young, and the computers at CERN weren’t as connected to the global network as other computers may have been. But Tim was way ahead of his time. He imagined a time when computers could instantly exchange information. But nearing the zenith of development on ENQUIRE, Tim’s six-month contract at CERN ended, and Tim was immediately offered a job at a newly formed company. Before leaving, he entrusted a copy of ENQUIRE to the new system managers at CERN, explained how it had helped him keep track of all the data, and left his work behind for others to rediscover.\n\nDevelopment of ENQUIRE\n\nAfter a few years of creating software at his new job in England, Tim suddenly began to show signs of nostalgia. He would often think back to his days at CERN in Switzerland and the opportunities that had grown from his time there. After a few months of thinking, he knew exactly what he wanted to do. He applied for another job at CERN during early 1983, and by 1984 he had been re-hired. He was immediately put to work with a team focusing on information-gathering software. It was not long until he came across a program that had been written to keep track of data and experiments in a tedious structure—the same problem Tim had been tasked to solve with his ENQUIRE software. Seeing flaws with the \"new and improved\" software, he re-wrote the program from scratch. But with this new program, he suddenly discovered that different computers would need different commands to interpret this new version of ENQUIRE. At what seemed like a block in the center of the road, Tim immediately rushed to find a solution. As the days dragged on, Tim began looking into the Internet. Although invented much earlier than the 1980s, many people became aware of it in the late 1970s. At once, Tim's mind began wandering to amazing heights. He began thinking \"What would happen if I were to combine the Internet with various hypertexts?\" Hypertexts are pages that are written and connected randomly to other hypertexts with links known as hyperlinks. Connecting hypertexts using the software discovered with ENQUIRE was relatively simple, but Tim wondered if he could broadcast this connection on the Internet to solve the exchange problem. After running a few trials, Tim began to overflow with excitement. His idea was unique in the aspect that any individual with access to a computer could create documents, store them on a computer, and allow any other computer to access them. The idea was revolutionary; he knew at once what he was on to.\n\nIn the middle of 1989, Tim submitted his first proposal to start developing his idea. He made sure he was extremely elaborate and detailed in his proposal. He listed all the possible benefits that scientists at CERN would gain from his venture. Even Tim’s boss recognized the importance of this undertaking, “I couldn’t figure out what it was, but I thought it was great,” his boss stated. But not everyone sensed the life-changing aspect of this proposal and it was debated upon as Tim patiently waited for a response.\n\nMarriage and World Wide Web\n\nWhile still awaiting approval from the administrators at CERN, Tim went to see a play one evening. The female lead immediately caught his attention, and within a few weeks the two were a couple. Her name is Nancy Carlson, an American programmer who was then working for WHO (World Health Organization). The two spent their holiday together at Nancy's home in Connecticut and Tim got to know his in-laws very well. But Tim was also able to make use of his time in America for professional pursuits and made sure to visit various labs and experiments in order to collect data for his software. Overall, Tim ranked this trip as a success, and it was the beginning of new personal and professional chapters in his life.\n\nReturning to CERN, Tim started noticing other scientists with newer and more advanced computers known as NeXT computers. He knew he had to possess one. A NeXT computer was exactly what he needed to continue his work on his software. But Tim approached his boss very carefully. He knew that CERN would have a hard time approving such an expensive computer to someone who was involved in a project that tested the boundaries of their mission. He got the help of his colleague who was very supportive of Tim and went on to talk to his boss. The boss quickly approved, even adding, “Why don’t you see what it’s like for developing a program?”\n\nThat's not the only \"yes\" Tim received to a difficult question. In the summer of 1990, he and Nancy exchanged vows in Fairfield, Connecticut. The newlyweds then moved back to Switzerland where they fell in love with their modest house in the hills of the Swiss Alps. It had an amazing view of rich pastures, Mount Blanc, and snow-capped mountains in the background. Returning to CERN, Tim found an unlikely ally waiting for him. During the time he was out, his boss had discovered another individual with almost the same interests as Tim. He quickly set up a meeting with Robert Cailliau, and before long both men were deeply involved in the creation of Tim's new program, officially christened the World Wide Web. Robert was quick to point out the flaws in Tim's initial proposal and together they improved the new proposal tenfold before sending it to administrators again. This new draft, entitled \"World Wide Web: Proposal for a Hypertext Project,\" made some waves within CERN, but they refused to deem it plausible. After several rounds of revamping the WWW, Tim and Robert decided to take a few weeks to put their own ideas together and then share their thoughts. Tim took this time to further explore his new and advanced NeXT computers and visit various hypertext conferences. At one particular conference in Versailles, France, Tim was intrigued by the software of a particular hypertext company. He explained his project to the two representatives, but both individuals thought the proposal was ridiculous. It just didn't seem logical to have information on one computer to appear on another computer across the world. After this second consecutive rejection, Tim didn't let the disappointment get to him. He knew the World Wide Web was absolutely possible and if he were to perfect the program, it would change the world. So during a period of transition of particle accelerators inside CERN, Tim's boss quietly turned his back while Tim turned on his computer and feverishly rewrote the code for the idea that would change his life. During this short interval, Tim worked like he had never done before. He would often stay in his office at CERN all day, and come home a few minutes early to go to a restaurant. He worked tirelessly for countless days on end fixing loose ends of his program code here and there. Even during his coffee breaks at the local café, Tim would eagerly talk to several scientists involved in research at CERN. They found Tim's proposal very intriguing, and in a few weeks, Tim had several encouraging followers. But during this time, Tim encountered numerous problems with his project. The first problem he needed to solve was how the computer would find the page that the user was looking for. After thinking and planning for a few days, Tim came up with the Universal Document Identifier, (UDI) which would later be renamed the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A URL would let computers know where a file was located in a computer server. A server is a storage system that contains the information contained on web pages. But not all computers could be servers, and most computers would be clients, which would mean that they would only be able to access the pages. But to view these different pages, a computer would require special software called a browser. Tim later created this software enabling different computers to use the URL to find a Web page.\n\nAfter solving this dilemma, Tim soon ran into another major problem. How would a client be able to take information from a server that uses an entirely different program language? It was as if speaking English to a Japanese foreigner. But like his previous dilemma, Tim quickly found a solution. He sat down and spent several days writing out a new language called HTML or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a special set of rules that all Web Servers must follow in order to send documents to Web Clients. And almost instantly, this problem was solved. Now, any client and server could communicate, receive, and send files using HTML, with little or no drag time in between.\n\nTim was soon testing the World Wide Web every day and made sure to fix every bug he encountered. But Tim knew that he couldn’t possibly expand the World Wide Web all by himself. Once he started this project, others would chip in one by one, and it would quickly grow into something much larger than he had ever imagined.\n\nGrowth of World Wide Web\n\nAfter fixing many of the flaws that were first embedded in the World Wide Web, Tim installed the first web browser onto his NeXT computer and created a server right in his room. The WWW was contained in one computer system and would soon spread quickly to other systems. Once everything was set up, Tim distributed copies of the WWW to scientists at CERN alerting them to see his creation grow. Soon after, on New Year's Day of 1991, Tim's friends and family got the chance to see another of his creations enter the world. This time, a daughter. Alice Berners-Lee. Tim drove to the hospital through a torrential snowstorm, and his face immediately lit up at the sight of his newborn child. He would later remark \"As amazing as it would be to see the Web develop, it would never compare to seeing the development of a child.\"\n\nAfter a wonderful holiday break, Tim returned to work and was faced with a plethora of new challenges. He had invented the WWW. Now, what was he going to do next? How was he going to promote this new creation? One thing was certain in Tim’s mind: He would not use this for personal gain. He truly believed that the World Wide Web could be used to make the world better. But first, he would have to start building the popularity of the World Wide Web at CERN.\n\nTim and Robert's campaign to spread the WWW across CERN was a failure at first. Both individuals soon learned that scientists at CERN saw no practical use for it. So Tim and Robert decided to come up with one. CERN had thousands of scientists coming and leaving their facilities every month, and all their phone numbers had to be stored on a large central computer. Tim and Robert thought: What would happen if we could make the phone book available to everyone through the WWW? Both men rushed to Bernd Pollermann, the administrator in charge of the central computer at CERN and immediately taught him how to write out the numbers in HTML. Now, all they had to do was hand out the browser programs in order for the scientists to be able to access the phone book on the World Wide Web. Once this was possible, it became an instant hit. Scientists all over CERN started using this new program to keep track of their contacts and almost all of them were greatly pleased with the results.\n\nThe World Wide Web Today and Achievements\n\nAfter useing the World Wide Web to access phonebooks at CERN, its popularity began to grow among users like a wildfire. And to make the WWW even more popular, Tim’s intern created a new browser for users who didn’t own an expensive NeXT computer. From that point on, the World Wide Web expanded with increasing speed. After Paul Kunz of Stanford University took a trip to CERN, he set up the World Wide Web on his computers in America and was shocked to see the information on Tim’s computer come streaming to his. He quickly set up the first web page in the United States and history soon followed. In August 1991, Tim finally made available the software for the World Wide Web, a browser, and a server on the Internet. August 6, 1991 became known as the date that the Web went “World Wide.\"\n\nThe next ten years proved to be a time of enormous change for Tim. In the summer of 1992, when the Web had first planted its roots, Tim took another trip to the United States, but this time to promote the WWW and speak to other researchers. By the beginning of 1993, over 50 servers had been set up across the world. Each of these servers could host thousands of web pages, and many other people began writing new browsers. In particular, a browser named Mosaic caught Tim’s attention. This browser was attempting to make it seem as though browsers were the Web itself. But Tim was shocked, and was becoming increasingly worried about the exploitation of the browsers accessing certain web pages for money. It was always meant to be a free service for people across the world and as the days dragged on, his worries began to grow. When a nervous reporter finally asked Tim: “Will CERN start charging for the use of the World Wide Web?” he knew he had to act fast. Because he had invented the Web using CERN’s property, technically it was still under the ownership of CERN. Tim rushed to request CERN to push the World Wide Web into the public domain, meaning it would officially be the property of the public. This request was approved in October of 1993 and Tim was ecstatic. In a year, things changed dramatically. Tim soon met Michael Dertuozos, a director of Computer Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The idea for a consortium soon emerged, and before long, the First International World Wide Web Conference was planned. At this “Woodstock of the WWW,” Tim announced the creation of the W3 web consortium and completely eliminated any doubts the audience had about the Web. At this convention, he also made waves when he announced his family and he would be moving from Geneva, Switzerland, to Cambridge, Massachusetts in the interest of Tim’s work. And in the U.S, in the June of that year, Tim’s second child, Ben Berners-Lee was born.\n\nThe next few years passed very quickly for Tim, as he settled down at MIT. Since then, Tim's work has continued to expand. When government censorship threatened the Web, Tim pioneered software called PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection), which allowed parents and administrators to block websites that they considered inappropriate. In 1994, Tim became one of the only six people to be inducted into the World Wide Web Hall of Fame. And not too soon after, in 1999, Tim was named one of the 100 Greatest Minds of the 20 Century. In the same year, Tim published his first book alongside Mark Fischetti, entitled \"Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor.\" In April 2004, he was awarded the first Millennium Technology Prize by the President of Finland for inventing the World Wide Web with a cash prize totaling up to one million euros. After spending these euros to expand the base of W3, Tim was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July of that same year. And in 3 years, in June 2007, he was inducted into the Order of Merit, one of the most prestigious civilian service awards in the British Empire.\n\nTim in the Present\n\nTim now works in collaboration with the government of the United Kingdom to make information and data more available and accessible on the World Wide Web. He also works on the Semantics Web, his new idea of a more progressed and advanced Web. This \"new\" web would allow people to immediately gather a host of information needed for a task. In 2009, Tim created the World Wide Web Foundation, an organization dedicated to empowering humanity by creating new programs. Tim now lives in Lexington, Massachusetts with his two children and wife Nancy. His family belongs to the Unitarian Church and is strongly rooted in Massachusetts. He continues to direct W3 and watches over the daily growth of the World Wide Web at MIT.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nName: Mahishan Gnanaseharan\n\nAge: 15\n\nCity: West Orange, New Jersey\n\nSchool: St. Benedict's Preparatory School, Newark, New Jersey\n\nWhat inspired the essay: The content of it and the lesson I learnt from it\n\nWhat surprised you about it: One can do things that can change the world to a better"
