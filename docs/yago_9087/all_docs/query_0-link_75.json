        "text": "December 2010 will mark the 20th Anniversary of the World Wide Web, the system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet, now just known as the web or the internet.\n\nEnglish engineer and computer scientist, Sir Tim Berners-Lee had been involved much earlier - ENQUIRE, a database and software project he had built in 1980, was a simple hypertext program that had some of the same ideas as the Web and the Semantic Web.\n\nThe name was inspired by a book entitled \"Enquire Within Upon Everything\" first published in 1856 by Houlston and Sons of Paternoster Square in London, and then continuously reprinted in many new and updated editions as additional information and articles were added. The book was created with the intention of providing encyclopedic information on a topics as diverse as etiquette, parlour games, cake recipes, laundry tips, holiday preparation and first aid:\n\n\"Whether You Wish to Model a Flower in Wax;\n\nto Study the Rules of Etiquette;\n\nto Serve a Relish for Breakfast or Supper;\n\nto Plan a Dinner for a Large Party or a Small One;\n\nto Cure a Headache;\n\nto Make a Will;\n\nto Get Married;\n\nto Bury a Relative;\n\nWhatever You May Wish to Do, Make, or to Enjoy,\n\nProvided Your Desire has Relation to the Necessities of Domestic Life,\n\nI Hope You will not Fail to 'Enquire Within.'\n\nYou can read a version of it at https://books.google.com/books?id=M...ource=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false or, if you prefer at https://www.archive.org/stream/enquirewithinupo00philuoft#page/n3/mode/thumb\n\nA great name for a book, the internet and this wonderful forum.....\n\nAlthough \"Enquire Within Upon Everything\" was published into the 1930s I believe, the advice may need to be taken with a pinch of salt:\n\n1285 Mad Animals, Bite of -…..Tie a string tightly over the part cut out the bite and cauterize the wound with a red hot poker, lunar caustic, or Sir Wm Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid. Then apply a piece of “spongio piline”, give a purgative and plenty of warm drink. Whenever chloroform can be procured sprinkle a few drops upon a handkerchief and apply to the nose and mouth of the patient before cauterizing the wound. When breathing appears difficult cease application of the chloroform(!). A physician writing in the Times urges this course and states that there is no danger with ordinary care in application of the chloroform while cauterization may be more effectively performed.\n\nAs the inimitable Slim Pickens as Major T. J. \"King\" Kong said in \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\": \"Shoot, a fella' could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff\"\n\nThanks for this interesting thread, Aidan, and for adding to my knowledge of Birmingham mathematicians.\n\nAs you say, Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods were computer scientists who worked together on the ground-breaking Ferranti Mark 1 computer at Manchester in the early 1950s. Of course their greatest collaborative project was their son Timothy John Berners-Lee (born in 1955 and later known as TimBL), who came up with the original proposal for the Internet in 1989. Though the Internet was the work of many minds, TimBL's design contained all the now familiar features, including HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language), HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator). It is hard to believe that the Internet is not yet 20 years old! TimBL is now the driving force in the creation of the \"Semantic Web\", which promises to be a significant advance on the Internet.\n\nTimBL's mother Mary Lee Woods was one of a very small group indeed of female mathematicians of her generation. There are, however, quite a number of female computer pioneers, starting with the remarkable Augusta Ada King née Byron, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852), the world's first computer programmer.\n\nThere appears to be some doubt as to Mary Lee Woods's birthplace, though she was certainly educated in Birmingham. Her parents were Bertie John Woods and Ida Frances Lee Burrows. Perhaps the helpful BHF genealogists can confirm her birthplace and give us other details of her early life. And can anyone find a picture of Mary Lee Woods?\n\nGetting back to the Internet of the 1850s, it is a remarkable fact that the book Enquire Within by Robert Kemp Philp (1819-1882) is available on the latter day Internet in multiple e-text versions. The earliest I have been able to discover is an American edition: Inquire Within For Anything You Want To Know (New York: Dick and Fitzgerald, 1859), in which my eye was caught by the following article:\n\nAdvice to Young Ladies.\n\nIf you have blue eyes, you need not languish. If black eyes, you need not stare. If you have pretty feet there is no occasion to wear short petticoats. If you are doubtful as to that point, there can be no harm in letting them be long. If you have good teeth, do not laugh for the purpose of showing them. If you have bad ones, do no laugh less than the occasion may justify. If you have pretty hands and arms, there can be no objection to your playing on the harp if you play well. If they are disposed to be clumsy, work tapestry. If you have a bad voice rather speak in a low tone. If you have the finest voice in the world, never speak in a high tone. If you dance well, dance but seldom. If you dance ill, never dance at all. If you sing well, make no previous excuses. If you sing indifferently, hesitate not a moment when you are asked, for very few people are judges of singing, but everyone is sensible of a desire to please. If you would preserve beauty, rise early. If you would preserve esteem, be gentle. If you would obtain power, be condescending. If you would live happy, endeavour to promote the happiness of others.​\n\nI don't think modern knowledge can add much to this advice, except perhaps to extend it equally to young gentlemen.\n\nWho was Robert Kemp Philp, the compiler of Enquire Within? The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography tells the story:\n\nPhilp, Robert Kemp (1819–1882), Chartist and compiler of reference works, was born in Falmouth on 14 June 1819, the son of Henry Philp (1793–1836). His grandfather, Robert Kemp Philp (1769–1850), was the Unitarian minister of Falmouth and one of the earliest supporters of ragged schools.\n\nPhilp was apprenticed in 1835 to a printer in Bristol, and afterwards settled as a newsvendor in Bath, where he was once fined for selling a Sunday newspaper; on refusing to pay, he was condemned to the stocks for two hours. He became a well-known Chartist, regularly contributing to the movement's journals and editing, with Henry Vincent, the National Vindicator, a Bath weekly newspaper, which appeared in 1841–1842. Prominently involved in the campaign on behalf of the leader of the Newport rising, John Frost, he was arrested in early 1840, but charges were dropped. Philp's prominence was confirmed by his election in mid-1841 to the executive committee of the National Charter Association. A supporter of a cross-class alliance, in the spring of 1842 he signed the declaration drawn up by Joseph Sturge and was appointed a delegate to the conference called by Sturge in Birmingham in December 1842. Philp did not believe he was abandoning his Chartist principles. He was a member of the National Convention which sat in London in April 1842, and is credited with having drawn up the second Chartist petition, signed by 3,317,752 persons. His support for Sturge's complete suffrage union, however, resulted in a bitter row with Feargus O'Connor and his removal from the Chartist executive.\n\nNo longer a Chartist, Philp moved to Fetter Lane in London in 1845 and began a career as a publisher of popular literature. He was sub-editor of the People's Journal from 1846 to 1848 and then launched the Family Friend, successively a monthly, fortnightly, and weekly periodical; he was its editor from 1849 to 1852. It had an enormous sale. Similar serials followed: the Family Tutor (1851–1853), the Home Companion (1852–1856), and the Family Treasury (1853–1854). Philp then began to compile cheap practical handbooks; in many cases these were issued in monthly numbers at 2d. The most popular, Enquire Within Upon Everything, appeared in 1856; a sixty-fifth edition followed in 1882, and by 1888 over a million copies had been sold. Another best-seller from 1856 was The Reason Why, which sought to answer common queries. This compilation heralded a \"Reason Why\" series of volumes dealing with such topics as domestic science (1857), the Bible (1859), natural history (1860), Christian denominations (1860), the garden and the farm (1860), and physical geography and geology (1863). His dictionaries of daily wants (1859), of useful knowledge (1858–1862; issued in monthly parts), and of medical and surgical knowledge (1862–1864; issued in monthly parts), and The Lady's Every-day Book (1873) were also popular.\n\nIn addition to Philp's various dictionaries, he also compiled travel guides, notably a series in the 1870s for the various railway companies. Finally, at least five songs by him were set to music, and he wrote poetry and a comedy in two acts, The Successful Candidate (1852). Philp died at 21 Claremont Square, Islington, on 30 November 1882, aged sixty-three, and was buried at Highgate. He left an only son.​\n\nR K Philp's connection with the prominent Birmingham Quaker abolitionist and social reformer Joseph Sturge (1793-1859) is an unexpected discovery!\n\nMr Philp published a companion volume to Enquire Within, entitled The Interview (London: Houlston and Stoneman, [1856]), containing similar words of wisdom in longer articles. Pictured below is an example from the section warning the reader about fraudulent advertisements.\n\nI have a book CONSULT ME for all you want to know by the author of ENQUIRE WITHIN published in 1883\n\nit was given as a christmas present in 1889 to my great aunt from my great grandfather its full of remedies\n\nrecepies card games and all sorts of things very interesting reading\n\nastwood\n\nI think these old advice books are most interesting. They contain a host of sociological information that is important to understand the lives of our relatives in the past, if not a little amusing or amazing in comparison with our own lives. These days if we want to know how to pick lobsters for example, we look on the internet and hope we find an authoritative source (thanks to Berners-Lee, Calliau, etc) out of the 1000s of search returns.\n\nI think it would be interesting to review some of the historical info from Enquire/Inquire within, Consult me, People's Journal, Family Friend, Family Tutor, Home Companion, Family Treasury, Reason why, dictionary of daily wants/useful knowledge/medical and surgical knowledge, Lady's Every-day Book , etc....... So apart from what to do if bitten by a mad animal and how to buy a fresh lobster - is there any other gems contained wthin?\n\ni remember the first computer installed in the Medical Physics Department of the then New Maternity hospital in 1968. It was a DEC I think. Big jobby. Blinking lights everywhere. Two big thick silver disks. Had the computing power of a modern wristwatch I think. Cost £12000. Those were the days. Lessons in BASIC. Then MUMPS. Then the Atari and the BBC and the Apple II. Those were the days...seemple.\n\nMUMPS - I remember that. And floppy disks as big as your arm, they've got it soft these days with iPhone and memory sticks...\n\n“I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”\n\nThomas J Watson, President of IBM, 1943\n\n“Computers in the future will weigh no more than 1.5 tons.”\n\nPopular Mechanics, 1949\n\n“It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it’s possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in five years.”\n\nJohn von Neumann, 1949\n\n“Transmission of documents via telephone wires is possible in principle, but the apparatus required is so expensive that it will never become a practical proposition.”\n\nDennis Gabor, 1962 (Nobel prize winner for Holography)\n\n“There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.”\n\nKen Olsen, co-founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977\n\n“640kB should be enough for anyone.”\n\nBill Gates, 1981\n\netc......\n\n#1750. Love's Telegraph - If a gentleman wants a wife he wears a ring on the first finger of the left hand, if he be engaged he wears it on the second finger, if married on the third and on the fourth if he never intends to be married. When a lady is not engaged she wears a hoop or diamond on her first finger, if engaged on the second, if married on the third and on the fourth if she intends to die unmarried. When a gentleman presents a fan, flower or trinket to a lady with the left hand, this on his part is an overture of regard should she receive it with the left hand it is considered as an acceptance of his esteem but if with the right hand it is a refusal of the offer. Thus by a few simple tokens explained by rule, the passion of love is expressed and through the medium of the telegraph the most timid and diffident man may without difficulty communicate his sentiments of regard to a lady and in case his offer should be refused avoid experiencing the mortification of an explicit refusal.\n\nWish I'd known that as it would have saved many a mortification. I just wear the ring through me nose it's easier - does anybody else recognise these symbols? It would be interesting to know when they started to die out (I'm guessing before WWII, possibly 20s?)."
