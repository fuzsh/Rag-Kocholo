When she grew up, she entered Birmingham University to devote herself to science. She was very smart and got a job in a company which developed commercial computers.\n\nTogether with her husband, she worked with computers for a long time and was a pioneering programmer and computer scientist. He had a son who later became the Internet discoverer.\n\nNowadays, you cannot imagine life without the Internet, and any news in technological sphere is connected in this or that way with the world wide web.\n\n#STEMLOOK #roboticsforkids #codingforkids #STEM #northshoremums #sydney #education #australia #onlineclass #onlineeducation"
