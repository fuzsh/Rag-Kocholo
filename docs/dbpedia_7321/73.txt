Bondi Outrigger Canoe Club (Bondi OCC) is an all volunteer/non-profit sporting team based in Sydney, Australia. We are an inclusive and diverse club who are passionate about outrigger canoeing.

​

Located on spectacular Sydney Harbour and based out of the Woollahra Sailing Club in Rose Bay, we train and paddle in some of the most beautiful waters Australia has to offer.

Head west and you’ll find yourself paddling towards the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Head out east and it’s the Sydney Harbour headlands you’ll meet which allow us to enjoy regular and fantastic ocean runs north to Manly or Shelley Beach, or south to world renowned beaches such as Bondi and Coogee.
