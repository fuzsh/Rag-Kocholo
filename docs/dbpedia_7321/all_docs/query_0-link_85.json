        "text": "Having just spent the past 10 days applying the Factor 20 and casually taking in the blissed out view of Chaweng beach through a pair of Spitfires, I can certainly relate to why Brendan McNamara and his Aussie cohorts would want to return to their Antipodean roots and remind themselves of the feel of Bondi beach sand between their toes.\n\nFlush with the success of the three-million-selling The Getaway, McNamara and a bunch of former Team Soho colleagues recently founded Team Bondi, signed a \"long-term exclusive\" deal with SCEA and got to work on an as-yet-untitled PlayStation 3 title (no it's not coming out on PSP, before you ask).\n\nSo far, details on the title have been scant - and we'd expect that to be the case for some time. McNamara today admitted that Team Bondi's project will take \"about the same time\" to develop as The Getaway, which points to the game's eventual release being three years off.\n\nEvidently, as with The Getaway it's all about aiming high - with McNamara refusing to let some of the harsher critical elements blunt his creative drive, proudly declaring that Team Bondi's project will be \"even more ambitious\" than The Getaway, and will be a game that is \"going to ask new questions from our audience in terms of gameplay, how the narrative plays out and also the concept of success and failure\".\n\nPerhaps tellingly, McNamara revealed that he's off to Japan to \"do some research\", so make of that what you will. A crime caper in Tokyo perhaps? A job advert for the Lead Tools Programmer reveals the team working on the game will be 100 strong, and further down the job spec for Lead AI Programmer states the team is \"targeting the most challenging character AI ever seen in a video game\", with the AI system \"simulating 200+ real-world agents for a real time, single player, story-focused game\".\n\nReal-world agents, hmm? Reading between the lines it would appear the game hinges around a persistent state. Assuming driving is involved (and why stop there?), it would appear that the player will have far more scope to approach missions as he or she sees fit. As McNamara hints above, the narrative structure would certainly have to be much less linear to accommodate this, and his thoughts on the concept of success or failure challenge the currently linear structure of most games.\n\nMindful of the huge sales of The Getaway in the face of polarised critical opinion McNamara admitted \"the big issue is to meet the expectations of the public\", but also rued that \"the polarity of reviews was pretty hard to fathom\", while later reflecting that \"Games journalism has a responsibility to up the standard of criticism\". Try telling that to a PR bod when you've given their latest big hope a less than positive score.\n\nAlthough McNamara's hands are evidently tied about telling us too much about Team Bondi's latest project, his answers are characteristically upfront about almost everything else we fired his way.
