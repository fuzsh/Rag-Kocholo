        "text": "Two days ago it was revealed that the developer behind L.A. Noire, Team Bondi, will be shutting down. Now news has come out detailing a fairly significant debt involving the company staff.\n\nDocuments filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show that a total of $1.4 million is owed to creditors. This includes a debt of approximately $1 million owed to 33 different staff members who helped work on L.A. Noire.\n\nAmong the former staff members detailed in the report are gameplay lead David Heironymus and studio head Brendan McNamara, who are owed $43,652 and $102,495 respectively.\n\nThe most surprising number though is the $145,795 owed to Depth Analysis, the company that developed L.A. Noireâ€˜s MotionScan technology.\n\nAn appointed liquidator will be handling the payment of any outstanding debts before the studio officially closes."
