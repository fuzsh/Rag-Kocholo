        "text": "Recommended Videos\n\nIt’s official folks — the studio behind one of the biggest games of 2011 has officially begun the process of dying. You usually hear of a studio closing after they release a flop, but it would seem that not even L.A. Noire could stop this Australian developer going down.\n\nDocuments were filed with the Australian Securities And Investments Commission, notifying that a liquidator has been appointed and that the studio’s administration resigned. Another document has been filed, titled, “Special Resolution to Wind Up Company.”\n\nTeam Bondi came under fire earlier this year due to accusations of excessive crunch time and poor working conditions. It also allegedly excluded certain developers from L.A. Noire‘s credits, refusing to acknowledge anybody who got fed up and quit before the game was finished.\n\nL.A. Noire Dev Team Bondi To Officially Shutter [Gamasutra]"
