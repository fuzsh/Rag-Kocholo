        "text": "This article originally appeared on our sister site GamesIndustry.biz.\n\nLast month a story on IGN called \"Why Did L.A. Noire Take Seven Years To Make?\" detailed the lengthy process wherein Sydney-based developer Team Bondi worked on the biggest, most expensive video game ever made in Australia. Published by Rockstar Games, L.A. Noire - released worldwide in May - was expansive in scope and revolutionary in concept.\n\nAt the story heart's were eleven testimonials – delivered by former Team Bondi employees interviewed under the condition of anonymity – which detailed the oppressive work conditions that hundreds of staff endured throughout those seven years. Among their complaints were an \"ominous crunch\" period of development which continually shifted year to year; a studio-wide expectation that staff would work overtime and weekends; a praise-free working environment; and a boss named Brendan McNamara, who one of the sources called \"the angriest person I've ever met\".\n\nIn the last few weeks, the story has been read and reported around the globe. Both fans and the game development community have reacted with contempt for Team Bondi, and for Rockstar Games, who seemingly condoned the Sydney-based studio's incessant whip-cracking. The International Game Developer's Association (IGDA) has declared that they are seeking comments from former Bondi staff as they investigate what they deem to be \"absolutely unacceptable\" working conditions.\n\nAs the original author of the report I've been contacted by developers who have worked under Brendan McNamara at other studios over the years. All have concurred with the assertions made by the Bondi Eleven. \"When Brendan came on board, it became clear that he was a huge bully with no talent, vision or management skill. But he really knew how to intimidate,\" wrote one. \"Fits with my experience of McNamara,\" tweeted another.\n\nTheir evidence includes time-stamped internal emails and staff employment contracts.\n\nSeveral more ex-Team Bondi employees have also contacted me to express their gratitude. \"On the day the article was posted, I had been linked it by a dozen or so other Team Bondi ex-employees in the first few hours, and then it was re-linked on Facebook for the rest of the day,\" one source told me. \"Everyone I've spoken to is really grateful that it's 'out there', and completely shocked that Brendan agreed to the interview.\"\n\nTwo former Bondi staffers, in particular, have supplied evidence which refutes comments made by Brendan McNamara in my original story, and strengthens the validity of claims made by the Bondi Eleven. Between them the pair spent years labouring under the Team Bondi banner. As with the original Bondi Eleven, the pair have supplied information under the condition of anonymity. Their rebuttals to their former boss follow; their evidence includes time-stamped internal emails and staff employment contracts.\n\nDeterioration of relationship with Rockstar\n\nSource: \"It's pretty well reported now that the working conditions were bad. What hasn't been discussed yet (from what I've seen) is the relationship between Team Bondi and Rockstar. I've heard a lot about Rockstar's disdain for Team Bondi, and it has been made quite clear that they will not publish Team Bondi's next game. Team Bondi are trying to find another publisher for their next title, but the relationship with Rockstar has been badly damaged - Brendan treats L.A. Noire like a success due to his vision but I think Rockstar are the ones who saved the project. They continued to sink money into LA Noire, and their marketing was fantastic. Without their continued support, Team Bondi would have gone under several years ago.\"\n\n\"Rockstar also made a huge contribution to the development; their producers were increasingly influential over the last two years of the game's development, and overruled many of the insane decisions made by Team Bondi management. At a lower level, Rockstar also pitched in with programmers, animators, artists, QA, etc. Part of the conflict between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they came to understand that this was a terrible idea. I have a few logs that show the relationship souring – see below.\"\n\n\"Every dog has its day and there's going to be hell to pay for this one. I'll never forget being treated like an absolute **** by these people.\"\n\nBrendan McNamara, founder Team Bondi\n\nDate: Tuesday, April 06, 2010.\n\nFrom: Brendan McNamara [Team Bondi founder]\n\nTo: Everybody List [everyone who worked for Team Bondi]\n\nHi Everyone\n\nI found out this morning that Rockstar have pulled out of the E3 show. I'm trying to find out more information as to why. I don't agree with this decision as I think the case we were going to show is looking great and that we could do some real damage there. Jeronimo [Barrera, Rockstar VP] is talking to the Marketing Team to ascertain what the Marketing Plan is going forward. Once I know what is happening and why I will get back to you.\n\nBrendan\n\nSource: \"The context on this second one is that our Production Designer (Simon Wood) posted an email with links to a new L.A. Noire logo designed by Rockstar (which Brendan hated). The announcement apparently had a Rockstar logo, but no Team Bondi logo alongside it. Brendan's reply was only supposed to be to Simon, but he replied to everybody at Team Bondi by mistake. He claimed he was only talking about commenters on news articles, but it was pretty clear to everyone that this wasn't true.\"\n\nDate: Monday, October 11, 2010\n\nFrom: Brendan McNamara [Team Bondi founder]\n\nTo: Everybody List [everyone who worked for Team Bondi]\n\nEvery dog has its day and there's going to be hell to pay for this one. I'll never forget being treated like an absolute **** by these people."
