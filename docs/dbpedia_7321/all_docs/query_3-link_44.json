Noire's Preorder Bonuses\n\nRockstar's only just getting round to releasing Red Dead Redemption's pre-order bonuses on the PlayStation Store\n\nThe publisher cites \"technical reasons\" for the delay.

Noire?\n\nGood grief, Rockstar's pulled it off again\n\nSure, we actually need to play L.A.

Noire, Confirms Rockstar\n\nRockstar's confirmed that there will be no collector's edition for L\n\nA. Noire</a> when the game releases in May.

Noire</a> other than \"OMGZ LOOK HOW GOOD THE FACES ARE WITH OUR MOTIONSCAN TECHNOLOGY!\" Every single screenshot, trailer and piece of PR has focused on the same thing. The faces.
