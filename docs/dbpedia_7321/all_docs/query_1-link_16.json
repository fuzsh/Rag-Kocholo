        "text": "Team Bondi's film noir-inspired detective thriller L.A. Noire was released last month to critical and commercial success. Set in a lavish recreation of 1947 Los Angeles, the game eschewed a familiar open-world design for case-by-case detective gameplay that revolved around examining crime scenes and interrogating suspects. Featuring a vast city, cases that adjusted depending on the player's actions and choices, and sophisticated motion capture technology that had never been used in a video game before, it was a mammoth project.\n\nSo mammoth, in fact, that it took over seven years to complete, with a publisher switch – from Sony to Rockstar – midway through. That's not the whole story, however. The development of L.A. Noire was anything but smooth.\n\nMuch has been written about the long development cycles on games such as Duke Nukem Forever, Too Human, or Prey, but the story behind L.A. Noire's rocky road to release stands out within Australia's small, tightly-knit development community. Team Bondi's crime drama is not just the biggest game development project ever undertaken in Australia, it also served as the first-ever project for many of the creative forces behind L.A. Noire. It's perhaps the combination of all these factors that has resulted in surprisingly open testimonials from former Team Bondi members about their experience working on the game.\n\nRecently, a group of former Team Bondi employees launched a public website with an amended staff roll for L.A. Noire that includes 100 developers omitted from the official game credits. But the look behind the curtain started much earlier. On January 23 2010, an anonymous source on Twitter began leaking stories heard through the grapevine regarding the Sydney-based studio. The account wasn't run by an ex-employee; it was anonymously dishing the dirt on Bondi as heard through unnamed sources, Wikileaks-style.\n\nThe tweets alleged that studio founder Brendan McNamara had mismanaged Team Bondi and development of L.A. Noire, and had spent \"tens of millions\" on proprietary technology in just a year. Despite then-publisher Sony Computer Entertainment America's faith in McNamara based on his PS2 hit The Getaway, Sony dropped the project in 2005, when the studio \"had far exceeded SCEA's expected price tag for the game.\"\n\nAccording to the tweets, this situation \"threw the studio into disarray. Strangely, McNamara quickly found hospice in his former rivals--the Houser brothers--and L.A. Noire was picked up by Rockstar [Games] in spring 2006… Since then, the game has been revamped, ported, and delayed four times. Rockstar spent more [than] Sony in their efforts to make it not suck.\"\n\nLocally, when the tweets were reported by the Australian gaming industry hub Tsumea, several anonymous commenters stepped in to back up the reports: \"I can certainly attest to the appalling working conditions, the angry and abusive boss and the ineffective leads who were completely unwilling to do anything to protect their team members,\" wrote one. \"It's abhorrent that these young kids are being thrown into a 24/7 corpse grinder with perpetual crunch and weekend overtime,\" wrote another.\n\nThe comments on Tsumea recall events that took place in 2004, when an anonymous LiveJournal post by a user named 'EA_spouse' expressed frustration at the fact that she rarely saw her fiancé, an employee of Electronic Arts, due to the long hours he was forced to work while attempting to meet deadlines for the title The Lord of the Rings: The Battle For Middle-Earth. The blog received wide press attention and eventually led to three class action lawsuits against EA for unpaid overtime.\n\nAfter the initial tweets and short-lived online discussions that followed, the situation returned to all-quiet-on-the-Bondi-front. In the meantime, there was finally light at the end of the tunnel: L.A. Noire's worldwide release date had been set for mid-May 2011. The game would finally see the light of day, but many questions remained. Are the allegations true? Why did it take seven years to bring L.A. Noire to market?\n\nIGN Australia reached out to dozens of former Team Bondi employees to help get a deeper look and tell the story. Eleven agreed to speak on the record, under the condition of anonymity; many feared reprisal from current and future employers if they were to be tagged as whistleblowers. The combined experience of these former staff is extensive: between them, they represent 24 years of service. Their individual tenures range from a few months, to four years, and they include artists, programmers, animators, and software engineers. We also spoke extensively with Team Bondi studio head Brendan McNamara for his perspective.\n\nThe+early+days\n\nIn 2003, when Team Bondi was established, the core team consisted of Brendan McNamara and his cohort of transplants from Team Soho, the London-based studio that worked on The Getaway. Five staff – dubbed the \"first Aussie hires\" – started at Team Bondi in March 2004.\n\nOne of these former employees describes the initial situation as \"quite tough, but good. There didn't seem to be much direction, either technical, artistic, or overall. We had a CTO [chief technology officer], but he wouldn't really talk to people, or give directions. We were mainly left to our own devices with very high-level tasks and weekly reviews. We grew from there, relatively quickly, to about 30 people over the first year,\" he says. They soon moved to a larger office in Ultimo to accommodate the company's expansion. \"In that first year we shipped a couple of milestones to Sony, but they weren't that good. When the pressure started mounting to deliver stuff, and [management started] seeing how we weren't delivering – mainly due to technical problems – things started getting worse and worse.\"\n\nAnother of the original \"Aussie five\" comments that \"at first, it was fun. New studio; big, new game. As time went by and the project wasn't coming together as fast as management wanted it to, they started to become aggressive and demanding. That led to people quitting, or being forced out when they didn't obey direct orders. It became a nasty place to be. When I left, there was a little over 100 people working there.\"\n\nThe+studio+structure\n\nTeam Bondi's lead staff were cherry-picked from Team Soho. According to a source, McNamara \"coaxed these people to come join him with the promise of lots of money and a wonderful life in Sydney. They brought with them preconceived ideas on how things should be run, and how awesome and mega-cool their company would be.\"\n\nThe developers accounts all indicate that the studio functioned under a decidedly informal hierarchy. If writer/director Brendan McNamara wanted something changed, he'd just go and talk to the staff member implementing it, rather than going through lead staff. \"Often the leads weren't involved,\" remembers a programmer. \"If you'd talk to your lead and say, 'Hey, Brendan's making this unreasonable demand,' they'd be understanding, but they're ultimately powerless. They can't go and tell Brendan that it's not feasible, just as much as I couldn't tell him. He just won't listen to reason.\"\n\n\"I can go to anyone I want,\" McNamara told IGN when we raised the topic of studio structure. \"It's my game. I can go to anyone I want in the team and say, 'I want it changed'.\" Rockstar's Sam Houser, he told us, can also make the same requests of his teams. \"I've been doing it for a long time,\" he continued, \"and it seems to have worked so far for me.\"\n\nPart and parcel of this approach, according to a number of the ex-employees we spoke to, was McNamara's need to exert total control over what goes on in the studio. When asked whether that was true, he chuckled and asked \"And is that a bad thing? I make video games. They're personal statements for me. I write 'em, I direct 'em, I put the technology together to make them. I go out to the world and say, 'Will you fund them?' So if you think that's obsessive: absolutely.\"\n\nStaff+turnover\n\nA recurring theme throughout the interviews that we conducted with the Bondi Eleven was that the mindset of Team Bondi's management was to hire junior employees, and make employees \"work longer and faster,\" accepting high turnover in the course of it. \"There was simply an expectation that you'd work overtime and weekends,\" said a source. \"I was told that I was taking the piss by saying that I couldn't give every single one of my weekends away. We were looked at as a disposable resource, basically. If you weren't in the 'inner circle'\" – an exclusive group which seems to have consisted of the former Team Soho employees – \"you were just a resource to be burned through,\" he says. \"Their attitude is: 'it's a privilege to work for us, and if you can't hack it, you should leave'. I heard one of the upper echelons say pretty much that. I thought it was disgusting. I don't understand how they can't see that maintaining talent would actually be good for them.\"\n\nAn artist with 12 years professional experience recalls, \"They created a below-junior position; 'graduate junior', I think, so they could pay less and push people around.\" Team Bondi was the first – and last – game development company that he worked for. \"I don't want another job in the game industry because of my experience [at Bondi]. Most of the [artists] I know who worked there, never want to work in games again.\"\n\nA former programmer says that, during his three year tenure, the studio had a \"massive turnaround, especially in the coding department. Out of the 45 people that no longer worked at the studio, 11 were fired. Out of the 34 that actually decided to leave, 25 of those were coders; most of whom had no job to go to, since they decided that it was better to be unemployed than to be working there. I was one of those.\"\n\nThis was echoed by a gameplay programmer, who had no prior game development experience. \"They have a massive turnover; a huge attrition rate,\" he says. \"I remember sitting in a meeting with all of the gameplay programmers. There were around 20 of us at the time. I looked around, and realised that out of all of them, other than the team lead, I'd been there the longest. And I'd only been there for under 12 months.\"\n\nWhen we raised the issue of staff turnover, and mentioned that our sources indicated that around a hundred staff had passed through the studio's doors, McNamara took us by surprise: \"I'd say more,\" he replied. \"Of the people we tried to build the game with, most of them would've never had any experience with this kind of thing before. And most of them would never have made a game that had these kinds of expectations.\"\n\nSeveral of the Bondi Eleven mentioned the knock-on effects from poor staff retention. A former gameplay programmer recalls that when one of his colleagues left, \"I inherited all their stuff to work with. And of course, once that happens, I'm quite unproductive for, like, a month, trying to figure out which way's up. That happened to me three or four times; I ended up inheriting four peoples' stuff.\" He was working simultaneously across so many systems, that when a Rockstar executive producer visited the studio, he was shocked to discover that the programmer was doing four peoples' jobs. \"I was like, 'tell me about it, man!'\", he says. \"But when I left, I handed all those four things on to somebody else, and they hired some new people, and just kept going. If they'd maintained their talent, they'd operate a lot more efficiently, and it wouldn't have taken them so long.\"\n\nMcNamara wasn't actively involved with HR matters at Team Bondi, and by his own admission made no attempt to intervene once he realised that people were leaving quite frequently. \"I thought it was a process where some people would stay the course, and some wouldn't,\" he said. \"You talk to people who say, 'Oh, I'd love to come in and be a tester,' but the process of making video games – or testing video games – is: generally, they're broken. They aren't much fun to test. And to some extent, we try to build those systems. If you're working on some tools to build the world, and those tools aren't working very well, by its nature, all your artists are going to be upset about that. If you're working on tools to let you build levels and they aren't working very well, then by its nature, all your designers are going to be upset about that. But that's part of the process you go through when you're making new technologies, and new games.\"\n\nInterpersonal+dynamics\n\nAll eleven ex-employees who went on record blamed many of Team Bondi's problems on the studio's leadership. One programmer cited unrealistic goals, unreasonable deadlines and verbally abusive behaviour. Another describes McNamara as \"the angriest person\" he's ever met. \"It's one thing for him to be angry behind closed doors, but it was incredibly common for him to scream at whoever was pissing him off in the middle of the office.\" In our conversation McNamara talked openly about his management style, saying that he sees getting into arguments as part of trying to get things done: \"Am I passionate about making the game? Absolutely. Do you think that I'm going to voice my opinion? Absolutely. But I don't think that's verbal abuse.\"\n\nIn March 2007, a corporate team-building company named Leading Teams was invited to the studio to address employee discontent and high turnover, according to a source. While some team members were able to air their grievances, others were fearful of retribution and said they didn't contribute to the sessions. Morale improved momentarily, but things didn't stick. \"One of the outcomes was the requirement that Brendan had to sit isolated from everyone else, but that just made it worse, since he would then pace back and forth all day, bothering people even more,\" described one of the programmers.\n\nOf the 2007 team-building session, McNamara recalled how he \"sat in front of the whole company, and they all told me what they thought about me.\" But he said he doesn't recall the content of their feedback, beyond the fact that \"some people said good things, and some people said bad things.\" Bondi only held two sessions with Leading Teams; on the second day, general manager Vicky Lord was sat in the same chair. Did McNamara take any of his employees' feedback on board? \"I don't know. It was 2007.\"\n\n\"I'm not in any way upset or disappointed by what I've done, and what I've achieved,\" he continued after a pause. \"I'm not even remotely defensive about it. I think, if people want to do what I've done – to come here and do that – then good luck to them. If people who've left the company want to go out there and have some success, then good luck to them. If they don't want to do that with me, that's fine, too. It's like musical differences in a rock and roll band, right? People say they do want to do it; some don't.\"\n\nThe+working+conditions\n\nMany of the ex-Bondi employees we interviewed talked about perpetual \"crunch time\" – a term often mentioned in the video games business when referring to long hours spent catching up on development milestones. While late hours are a common sight – and complaint – at American games and entertainment studios, designers new to the games business were taken aback. \"When I joined the team, there was no indication that it was anything other than a 9-5, five-day-a-week job,\" said one artist who spent two years at the studio. \"It was never outwardly said that you had to be working more [hours], but it was just the vibe of the place. If you weren't [working overtime], you couldn't progress any further.\"\n\n\"If you left at 7.30pm, you'd get evil eyes,\" another artist recalls. \"The crunch was ongoing. It just kept on shifting; an ominous crunch that just keeps moving, and moving. Management would say, 'Oh, it'll finish once we meet this deadline,' but the deadline kept moving. That went on for a good year.\" Of the three years that this artist spent at Team Bondi, he worked 60-hour weeks on average. To meet each development milestone – around one per month, he says – his workload would jump to between 80 and 110 hours per week, for a period of one to two weeks at a time. The wider issue, one animator believes, is \"game companies thinking that crunch can solve poor scheduling, or bad design decisions made early on in a project.\"\n\nAnother source who left the company in 2008 called his experience at Team Bondi the biggest disappointment of his life. \"I left because of stress and working conditions, mainly. But the trigger was this: I received a reprimand for 'conduct and punctuality' for being 15 minutes late to work. I arrived at 9:15am – despite the fact I had only left work around 3:15am the same day, and paid for my own taxi home! I never would have thought you could put a sweat shop in the Sydney CBD.\"\n\nMcNamara sees it differently. \"We all work the same hours,\" he told us. \"People don't work any longer hours than I do. I don't turn up at 9am and go home at 5pm, and go to the beach. I'm here at the same hours as everybody else is. We're making stuff that's never been made before,\" he asserted. \"We're making a type of game that's never been made before. We're making it with new people, and new technology. People who're committed to put in whatever hours they think they need to.\"\n\nMcNamara is unsure how often regular working hours were exceeded during the game's seven-year development period, but concedes that his own \"standard workweek\" may not be representative of the norm. \"If you wanted to do a nine-to-five job, you'd be in another business,\" said McNamara, citing routine hours from 9am to 8pm - \"whatever days it takes\" – with frequent travel and 4am calls with the New York-based publisher.\n\nAnother issue raised by several of the Bondi Eleven related to overtime. \"No overtime was officially paid in the three years and three months that I worked at Team Bondi,\" one artist told us. According to this source, staff contracts were worded in a manner which ensured that the only way employees would be paid for their overtime would be to wait until three months after project completion. Those who left the company before this time were not entitled to overtime payments.\n\nDuring our conversation with McNamara he assured us that the overtime for all of the current staff members had been paid. \"There was a bonus scheme for working evenings, and people got a month off for that,\" he said. \"And people who worked weekends got paid for it. We brought in a weekend working scheme for that. But contractually, we don't have to do that. Part of the thing is that we pay over the odds, and it says in their contract that if they need to do extra time. I've done 20 years of not getting paid for doing that kind of stuff. I don't begrudge it. I get the opportunity to make these things.\"\n\nIn+development+hell\n\nThe biggest question surrounding the development of L.A. Noire is: what took so long? Two Bondi staff members who were among the first to work on L.A. Noire both note that \"the PS3 didn't exist when the game was started, so lots of assumptions were made that were later on incorrect, or had to be changed.\" The pair also point to staff inexperience as a complicating factor; both of the team working together, as well as the difficulties associated with coming to terms with the new system's hardware. \"That's compounded by lots of people leaving,\" said one. \"By the time I resigned, around 80 people had left. I don't know what the number is now, three years later.\"\n\nWhen an artist from the Bondi Eleven left in 2008, L.A. Noire was in \"a relatively good working state. It had a decent framerate, and the art looked good, but it was so far from complete. The light at the end of the tunnel was almost non-existent. It was depressing to even contemplate. Bear in mind that at that point, the managers projected it would be released in the middle of 2009.\"\n\nA gameplay programmer comments that when he resigned, he recalled thinking, \"I can't do this to myself anymore. When I started, there was 'less than 12 months to go' on the project. Then, two and a half years later when I left, there was still 'less than 12 months to go',\" he laughs. \"I'm not sure whether management were lying, or just naïve.\"\n\nA programmer recalls the experience that caused him to resign. \"We were working on a demo that we were told would be shown to the press,\" he says. \"For three weeks, I worked 15 hours a day, every day.\" However, he points out that \"the times where we were working really hard were some of my most fun times there. We were just getting shit done; it was good, because we were making a lot of progress. Often, at those points, the management would leave us alone. So I'd go back to the apartment, and I wouldn't feel terribly bad. I'd be tired, and I'd sleep.\" After three straight weeks of gruelling work, the programmer was shocked to discover that the demo wasn't being shown to the press after all. In addition, half of the material he'd been working on for three consecutive 100-hour weeks ended up being completely reworked.\n\nWhen asked about the game's seven-year development process, McNamara describes its ups and downs: \"I think the beginnings and the ends are always great, and the middle is torture. That's the same with everything. It was the same with The Getaway, and the same with the stuff I did before that. In the middle, it just feels like you're watching paint dry. It moves very slowly. But when you get to the end, you hope it's all worth it.\" He said that \"everything\" is riding on this title: \"the studio, the opportunity to make new things; family, house. Everything. All the usual stuff.\"\n\nLooking back, what would he have done differently? \"I think we'd think twice about Sydney, wouldn't we?\" McNamara asked Vicky Lord, Bondi's general manager, who was within earshot throughout our 50 minute interview. \"There's not that much government assistance, compared to Canada or the U.S.,\" he says. \"The expectation is slightly weird here, that you can do this stuff without killing yourself; well, you can't, whether it's in London or New York or wherever; you're competing against the best people in the world at what they do, and you just have to be prepared to do what you have to do to compete against those people. The expectation is slightly different.\"\n\n\"And the people who're making [this game], their experience [with other Australian game development companies] has generally been work-for-hire, which is a lower level of expectation in terms of quality than what we would expect, with Sony in London and all that kind of stuff. So that's been the hardest [part], but having said that, have we got great people here? We have,\" he concludes. \"We've got some people who started as kids, and have since become great men and women. We're really proud to work with them.\"\n\nBeyond+Noire\n\nAfter seven years in the making, L.A. Noire is now on store shelves. It's been the biggest game development project ever undertaken in Australia, and it's also been the longest. What can those who work in the industry take away from the project, and from the apparent disconnect between the Bondi Eleven's allegations and Brendan McNamara's responses? \"Ultimately, all the developers can do is work their hardest to get hired at better companies. It is every developer's responsibility to know their rights, and be willing to fight for them,\" says Erin Hoffman, the blogger behind the 2004 'EA Spouse' post.\n\nHoffman should know. Her blog was written in support of her fiancé (now husband), who was working on the EA title The Lord of the Rings: The Battle For Middle-Earth at the time, and logging around 85 hours per week at the office. As a direct result of the blog and the media attention that followed, EA settled over USD$30 million in unpaid overtime with programmers and graphic artists at its California studio, after three class action lawsuits were brought against the publisher.\n\n\"Looking through what the developers are saying overall, to me this looks like a kind of casualty of globalisation,\" said Hoffman, after we showed her examples of the interviews conducted with former Team Bondi staff. \"It does happen in the U.S., but less frequently, because publishers here will rarely green-light a project that doesn't have a proven team behind it, as opposed to a single visionary. Those single visionary situations rarely work out. They think that they can train anyone to their style of management. It is usually a huge red flag when any kind of senior person has burned bridges with their previous teams. Unfortunately, it does seem to amount to a huge project being given to a person who did not have a track record of being able to deliver on that scale. These projects are extremely complex, which is why the successful ones rely not on an individual's expertise in delivery, but a leadership team -- technology, art, game design. It also sounds like they put their money on an idea guy, not a game designer.\"\n\nAs the Australian development industry rebuilds in the wake of the many studio closures of the last few years, it's important that its workers know the avenues that are available to them if they're unhappy with their work situation. \"There's a lot of naivety amongst young game programmers out there,\" said one of the Eleven. \"There's all this young enthusiasm to get into the games industry. People are willing to do so much to do it, but they're not educated about how they really should be standing up for themselves, and making sure that the conditions are right.\"\n\nAndrew McMillen (@NiteShok) is a freelance journalist based in Brisbane, Australia. https://andrewmcmillen.com/"
