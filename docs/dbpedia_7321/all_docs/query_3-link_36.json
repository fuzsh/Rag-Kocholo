        "text": "TIGA,the trade association representing the UK games industry, said today that\n\nstatements that the Australian games industry has been obliterated should make\n\nfor sober reading for UK policy makers.\n\nTIGA made the warning in the light of comments by Jason Stark, studio director at Krome in Australia, that the country’s video\n\ngames industry has been “obliterated”.\n\nStark blamed the destruction of the\n\nAustralian games industry on a lack of new projects, the strong Australian\n\ndollar and tax incentives in other regions for the decline. Since 2009, studios\n\nincluding Pandemic, EA's Visceral, Krome and Team Bondi have all closed. Stark\n\nclaimed around 90 per cent of local developers are moving overseas to places\n\nsuch as Canada, “where streets are paved with video game gold.” Stark added: “We've all expected the industry\n\nto be shrinking – it's been bad times. It's gone from being a mild contraction\n\nto being pretty much obliterated.” (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-10-18-australian-games-industry-has-been-obliterated)\n\nDr Richard Wilson, TIGA CEO, said:\n\n“For any politician who cares about the UK video games sector, the news\n\nfrom Australia should make for sober reading. Although the UK video games\n\nsector employs an excellent, highly talented workforce, we are not competing on\n\na level playing field. Our competitors in Canada, many states in the USA and\n\nFrance, benefit from tax breaks for games production, thereby reducing the cost\n\nof development and employment. However, no tax breaks for games production\n\nexist in the UK. Our industry is at a disadvantage.”\n\nJason Kingsley, TIGA Chairman and\n\nCEO and Creative Director at Rebellion, said:\n\n“The UK video games sector provides highly skilled employment, exports its\n\ncontents all over the world, is highly creative and is R&D intensive. It is\n\nexactly the kind of industry that politicians should be supporting. TIGA will\n\nadvance a case for a carefully targeted break, better R&D tax credits and a\n\nCreative Content Fund to help UK games businesses. Our industry can contribute\n\nto the economic recovery but we need a tax system that lets us compete\n\neffectively. I like Australia, but I\n\ndon’t want the UK video games industry to end up in the same state.”\n\nEnds\n\nAbout\n\nTIGA:\n\nTIGA is the trade association representing the UK’s games industry.The\n\nmajority of our members are either independent games developers or in-house\n\npublisher owned developers.We also have games publishers, outsourcing\n\ncompanies, technology businesses and universities amongst our membership.

Dr Richard Wilson, TIGA\n\nCEO, has been voted a finalist in the ‘Outstanding Leader’ category. TIGA was also named as a finalist in the 2010\n\nChartered Management Institute (CMI) National Management and Leadership Awards\n\nin the category of ‘The Outstanding Organisation of the Year Award (SME)’.
