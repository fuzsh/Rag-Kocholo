        "text": "With uncertainties ever-present, the U.S. and Australia will continue to forge ever stronger relations. Businesses that best manage and take advantage of this will be the most successful.\n\nAs our respective national security capabilities increase, and interoperability and related technologies are harnessed in commercial industries; the opportunities for businesses on both sides of the Pacific Ocean will increase significantly.\n\nThe manner in which our countries respond to changing geo-political and environmental challenges in the Indo-Pacific and beyond will shape the 21st century. Successive Australian Governments and U.S. Administrations have recognized the importance of science and innovation in the National Security sector.\n\nWith a focus on dual-use businesses and technologies, particularly in the defense, cyber, intelligence, space and related national security industries, 1941 will help Australian and U.S. businesses harness the world-leading expertise and resources required to grow as they deliver innovative technologies and products needed to address the broad spectrum of national security challenges now and into the future.\n\n1941 is a joint initiative of Bondi Partners and Ellerston Capital. The Fund’s objective is to identify, invest in and help grow the next generation of Australian and U.S. success stories – focused on national security dual-use businesses and technologies – across both sides of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n1941 focuses on early-stage private businesses and select investments in later-stage businesses and listed growth companies, particularly in the defence, intelligence, cyber and space industries, and other dual-use businesses with a commercial application to the national security sector.\n\nNational security is a cornerstone of the Australia-U.S. relationship. Ever since Australian Prime Minister John Curtin turned towards the U.S. for defence support in 1941, the relationship between Australia and the U.S. has continued to grow. In 2021, 80 years after this momentous decision, we have seen the importance of the alliance between Australia and the U.S. prosper with the formation of AUKUS.\n\nVisit 1941.com.au"
