        "text": "Over 100 names are missing from L.A. Noire’s credits. Folks who contributed to the massive seven year development of the game have been neglected, or merely given a special thanks mention at the end. In order to combat this, those involved have created the lanoirecredits website – which shows an extended list of credits including those who were initially left out.\n\nThe about section in the site states the following:\n\nAccording to International Game Developers Association (IGDA) “any person, contractor or employee, who has contributed to the production of the game for at least 30 days of a 12-month or greater project must be credited”. That credit must also include a name and a role. Not just a name.\n\nAt the moment there is no official standard for this practice – but for Australians who put hard work into what has become a flagship game for the Australian games industry, this is extremely disappointing.\n\nThis feeling is echoed on the lanoirecredits website itself.\n\nThe Australian game development scene is quite small but tightly knit – we as an industry have always been punching above our weight, with varied success. L.A. Noire looks set to be a watershed moment for the Australian games industry – every single developer who had contributed their talent, sweat and tears should be recognised for this.\n\nWe also believe that this is an opportune moment to draw attention to the health of the Australian development scene and where we go from here. Many developers on the project were first timers to the industry – many served for multiple years and left with just this 1 title under their belt. With the raft of studio closures around the country, a continued lack of government funding support, compounded by the rising cost of development here due to the strong Aussie dollar – developers looking to continue their careers locally can be significantly hampered by discriminatory crediting practices. This could lead to highly talented, and equally important, experienced developers pursuing their careers abroad or, more tragically, leaving the games industry permanently.\n\nWell said.\n\nWebsite formed to list 100 Team Bondi developers missing from L.A Noire credits [Tsumea]\n\nThanks to Darren for sending it in."
