Team Bondi, the games studio behind the blockbuster La Noire, has gone into administration after six years and just one game.

The Sydney-based games developer appointed administrators on Tuesday, according to a filing with the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission.

This brings to an end a tumultuous period for the Australian games firm, with rumours of bad management and poor working practices plaguing Team Bondi since it released LA Noire in May 2011.

The detective thriller continues to enjoy critical and financial acclaim, but its six-year production paved the way for numerous unflattering claims from disgruntled employees, prompting an investigation by the International Game Developers Association.

More recently, Team Bondi was reported to have parted ways with Rockstar, the New York-based games publisher behind LA Noire, raising questions about its ability to continue operating.

The company was also rumoured to be selling its assets and intellectual property to a rival studio, KMM Games, where many of its senior developers have moved, including founder Brendan McNamara.

Rockstar is thought to own the intellectual property for the PC version of LA Noire, which is due to be released later this year.

According to the Australian news website Smart Company, Team Bondi is to hold a creditors' meeting in Sydney on Friday.

Team Bondi could not be reached for comment at the time of publication. Rockstar Games did not respond to a request to comment.
