Different sets of districts can produce different election outcomes, and even if the underlying vote patterns remain constant, the choice of delimitation practices is important.\n\nThe Boundary Delimitation Encyclopedia topic discusses the administrative and cost implications of delimiting electoral districts for representation purposes and considers the social and political context in which delimitation takes place. It also covers the boundary setting process associated with voting areas.\n\nEncyclopaedia Content\n\nOverview\n\nThe term \"boundary delimitation\" usually refers to the process of drawing electoral district boundaries. However, it can also be used to denote the process of drawing voting areas (also called polling areas, districts or election precincts) for the purposes of assigning voters to polling places. The term has been employed to describe the process of demarcating administrative boundaries such as state/province, county or municipality lines as well.\n\nThis section focuses only on the delimitation of electoral districts and voting areas. Furthermore, because the delimitation of electoral districts is far more complicated and much more controversial than the delimitation of voting areas, the vast majority of this topic area will be devoted to the delimitation of electoral district boundaries.\n\nDelimiting Electoral Districts\n\nThe periodic delimitation of electoral boundaries, or redistricting or redistribution, is necessary in any representative system where single-member districts or uniformly small multimember districts are used. If electoral boundaries are not periodically adjusted, population inequities develop across districts.\n\nAdjusting district boundaries can have major consequences not only for the legislators who represent the districts, but also for the individual and community constituents of the districts. Ultimately, election results and the composition of the legislature are affected by the selection of district boundaries. But the importance of the redistricting process is seldom recognised outside of political circles.\n\nCountries have adopted various methods for delimiting districts. In some, the choice of methods is simply a matter of historical tradition. In others, methods for delimiting districts have been borrowed from a colonial power or an influential neighbouring country. In still other countries, delimitation is based on a variety of factors that may include geographic size of the country, its physical features, or its financial resources. Recently, countries have taken their political and social context into account when making decisions on which redistricting practices to adopt. Clearly, there is a broad range of possibilities. Informed decision-making is the best approach to selecting or reforming a redistricting process.\n\nElectoral Systems that Delimit Electoral Districts\n\nThe delimitation of electoral districts is most commonly associated with plurality or majority electoral systems. Both systems rely heavily, if not exclusively, on single-member districts. These districts must be redrawn periodically to reflect changes in the population.\n\nPlurality and majority systems, however, are not the only types of electoral systems that require the periodic delimitation of electoral districts. Some mixed and proportional representation systems, including the single transferable vote system, also must occasionally delimit electoral districts.\n\nThe importance of the delimitation process varies, depending on the type of electoral system. Because plurality and majority systems can, and do, produce election outcomes that are disproportional with regard to the ratio of legislative seats to partisan votes, the delimitation process is very important. It is less important in mixed systems or proportional representation systems.\n\nStructure and Rules for Delimiting Electoral Districts\n\nCountries that delimit districts must establish a formal structure and a set of rules for carrying out the delimitation process. Because different sets of districts can produce different election outcomes, even if the underlying vote patterns remain constant, the choice of delimitation practices is important. Electoral legislation outlining the formal structure and rules for delimitation should address the following issues:\n\nWho will draw the district lines or boundaries? And who will have the ultimate responsibility for selecting the final districting plan?\n\nShould the persons who draw the districts be independent from the legislature?\n\nShould the boundary authority be politically neutral?\n\nShould the legislature have any formal role at all in the process?\n\nShould some mechanism exist for public input into to the process?\n\nShould criteria be adopted for the line drawers to follow? If so, what should these delimitation criteria be?\n\nHow often should districts be redrawn and how long should the redistricting process take?\n\nUnder which criteria should districts be redrawn?\n\nDelimitation practices vary markedly across countries. In the United States, for example, legislators are usually responsible for drawing electoral district lines. Partisan politics and the protection of incumbent legislators play a large role in the redistricting process. By contrast, politicians in many Commonwealth countries have opted out of the delimitation process. Districting is left to independent commissions with neutral delimitation criteria for guidance. The reasons for these differences are best explained by the social, political and cultural norms.\n\nTasks Involved in Drawing Electoral District Boundaries\n\nAlthough the rules for delimitation vary markedly across countries, the tasks involved in drawing districts are generally very similar. Drawing district boundaries entails:\n\nallocating seats to sub-regions of the country, such as states or provinces;\n\ncreating a database minimally composed of maps and population data;\n\nassigning geographic units to districts until all geographic units within the territory have been assigned;\n\nsummarising and evaluating the districting plan.\n\nThis can be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process.\n\nDelimiting Voting Areas\n\nMost countries, regardless of the type of election system employed, delimit voting areas for the administration of elections. Voting areas are contiguous geographic areas in which all the voters are assigned to the same voting (or polling) station. Since voting areas are used for election administration purposes only, the boundaries of these areas tend to be less controversial, and the delimitation of these areas is usually left to the discretion of election administrators. However, because the data required and the tasks involved in the delimitation of voting areas are similar to those involved in drawing electoral district lines, the delimitation of voting areas is discussed under the Boundary Delimitation section of ACE.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Boundary Delimitation topic area discusses the types of electoral systems that require periodic electoral district delimitation and considers the advantages and disadvantages of various districting alternatives (see Delimiting Electoral Districts). It considers the formal structure and rules that countries use to conduct electoral district delimitation, or redistricting (see Structure and Rules for Delimiting Electoral Districts). It outlines each step of the district drawing process, from the creation of a redistricting database to describing and evaluating districting plans (see Tasks Involved in Drawing Electoral District Boundaries). In addition, this topic area covers delimitation of voting areas for election administration purposes (see Special Considerations: Delimiting Voting Areas).\n\nWe hope this discussion will better prepare countries to make informed decisions on whether to delimit electoral districts and, if so, which boundary delimitation practices to adopt.\n\nContext\n\nThe decision as to whether to delimit electoral districts, and by what means, should depend on country-specific conditions that take into consideration the political and social context and available administrative and financial resources. But this is often not the case – in many countries delimitation practices have simply been a matter of historical tradition. In other countries, district delimitation methods have been borrowed from a colonial power or an influential neighbouring country. Delimitation practices that work well in some countries will not work well in others. Electoral districts were developed as a means of providing fairer representation. Under certain circumstances, they may still provide a good option for representation, but this is very much dependent on the country context.\n\nHistorical Background [1]\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, representation was based on communities, not on the number of individuals or voters. Constituencies varied greatly in population. In England, for example, each county, borough, and university, regardless of size, had two representatives in the House of Commons. The composition of the House of Commons, and legislatures throughout Europe, reflected the view that communities or distinct categories of society – for example, the clergy and the nobility – should be represented, not individuals or voters.\n\nBeginning in the latter part of the eighteenth century, citizens began to demand a broadening of their franchise and fairer representation in the legislature. Single-member districts for the election of legislators were embraced by this movement as a means towards greater democracy. Not only would single-member districts ensure more equal representation for citizens, it was believed that they would produce a more representative legislature – increasing representation for the urban, working class and other traditionally under-represented groups.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, single-member districts were first adopted in the British colonies that later became the United States. During the nineteenth century, many European countries gradually followed suit. Denmark adopted single-member districts for elections to its lower chamber in 1849. A newly unified Italy chose single-member districts to elect representatives to the national legislature in 1861. The North German Confederation adopted single-member districts in 1867; imperial Germany, in 1871. France has used single-member districts intermittently since 1875. Britain adopted single-member districts in 1885, and the Netherlands followed suit in 1887. Norway, one of the last European countries to adopt single-member districts, did so in 1905 when the country obtained full independence.\n\nMost of the remaining European countries that continued to use communities, rather than specially delimited electoral districts, for the election of representatives were the less progressive countries, such as Portugal or the Balkan states. Of the more modern European countries, only Switzerland and Belgium used multimember districts throughout the nineteenth century. Belgium used its nine historic provinces as boundaries for its multimember districts, but it recognised the principle of equal representation by varying the number of representatives assigned to province. When proportional representation was adopted in Belgium in 1899, multimember districts based on provincial boundaries were retained.\n\nIn Switzerland, prior to 1848, each canton sent a single representative to the federal assembly. The constitution of 1848 provided for representation based on population; so in 1850, 49 electoral districts, or constituencies, were created. The boundaries of these constituencies went unchanged for 70 years, however. In 1919, Switzerland adopted proportional representation. Since 1919, representatives have been elected from multimember districts that correspond to the canton boundaries.\n\nThe trend towards single-member districts in Europe ebbed with the advent of proportional representation in the late nineteenth century. Between 1899, when Belgium adopted proportional representation, and 1921, when Norway moved to proportional representation, most of the continental European countries adopted one form of proportional representation or another.\n\nBecause multimember districts are used with systems of proportional representation, countries that have adopted such systems are no longer required to periodically redraw district boundaries. Instead, administrative divisions such as states, provinces, or counties can be used to elect representatives. Equality of population is achieved by varying the numbers of legislators elected from a district, rather than redrawing district lines. Today, the norm in Europe is multimember districts that correspond to administrative divisions and do not require periodic delimitation.\n\nSocial and Political Context\n\nThe delimitation of single-member districts has several advantages. The three most often cited are simplicity, stability and strong links between elected representatives and their constituents. Each of these advantages may be important ones, depending on the social and political context in which the districts are adopted.\n\nElections held in single-member districts tend to be quite easy for voters to understand, especially in conjunction with plurality or majority voting rules. Simplicity may be a significant advantage for countries with high illiteracy rates.\n\nSingle-member districts promote stability by facilitating strong, single party government. This is because single-member districts tend to produce election outcomes in which the majority party is over-represented. This may be an important advantage in countries that have reason to fear or have actually experienced a proliferation of small extremist parties or coalition governments that have frequently fallen.\n\nSingle-member districts provide voters with strong constituency representation. Voters have a single, easily identifiable district representative to whom they can appeal for constituency service. Voters also have a single district representative whom they can hold accountable for protecting constituency interests. This may have a positive affect on voters’ feelings of political efficacy, which may, in turn, increase voter turnout. Political efficacy and turnout are both important ingredients for system legitimacy, which may be important to newly emerging democracies.\n\nSingle-member districts have one very serious drawback: they tend to over-represent the majority political party at the expense of the other political parties. Countries that delimit single-member districts must be willing and able to accept disproportional election outcomes. Although it is possible to devise a fair and non-partisan redistricting process, it is not possible to guarantee an unbiased election outcome with single-member districts unless there are provisions for a second, party vote (as is the case with a mixed electoral system).\n\nDisproportional election results may be difficult to accept in a country with many political parties representing widely disparate interests. The results will be virtually impossible to accept if deep cleavages exist in the society. For example, if there is a relatively large, politically cohesive ethnic, racial, or religious minority group that has consistently been denied what it perceives as fair representation, elections could lead to conflict, possibly even violence and instability.\n\nTaking the Politics Out of Redistricting Traditionally, legislatures have been responsible for drawing their own districts. Electoral abuses such as malapportioned districts (districts that vary substantially in population) or “gerrymandered” districts (districts intentionally drawn to advantage one political party or group at the expense of the others) were not uncommon. These abuses led a number of countries to adopt reforms designed to remove “politics” from the redistricting process. In these countries, non-partisan commissions draw district boundaries following a set of neutral redistricting criteria. The public is encouraged to participate through a public inquiry process. And the legislature is permitted only a limited role, if any role at all, in the redistricting process.\n\nThese reforms have been adopted by many Commonwealth countries, where the reforms appear to have been quite successful. Redistricting is rarely viewed as “partisan,” even when the outcome of an election clearly favours one party at the expense of the other parties. Despite their success in the countries that have adopted them, reforms of the redistricting process have not been embraced everywhere. For example, legislatures still draw congressional districts in most states in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, the political system and political institutions were designed on the premise of competing factions, with special interests and parochial concerns vying for limited resources within the legislature. As a result, Americans tend to assume that “politics” and the pursuit of political self-interest are inevitable. Reforms of the redistricting process are unlikely to be adopted in the near future because many Americans believe it is as impossible to divorce politics from the redistricting process as it is to divorce politics from the legislative process in general.\n\nOnly countries that are less pluralistic, more politically ideological, and more public-regarding accept the proposition that politics can be removed from the redistricting process. Furthermore, strong party organisations and centralised legislative authority are needed to enforce sanctions against legislators who attempt to influence the redistricting process. While these conditions appear to be met in most Commonwealth countries, they are not present everywhere.\n\nBut countries that adopt independent boundary commissions and neutral redistricting criteria can only prevent partisan interests from controlling the process; these countries cannot alleviate disproportional election outcomes. If political fairness is defined by outcome, rather than by process – and specifically by a proportional outcome for political parties and/or minority groups – then single-member systems will fail the fairness test more often than not, no matter who draws the districts. Countries that value proportionality over all else – perhaps because of the need to ensure equitable representation to deeply divided groups within the society – are wise to choose some form of proportional representation, which may or may not include provisions for single-member districts. If stability in the form of strong, single party government is more important, however, delimiting single-member districts is a good choice.\n\nAdministrative and Cost Considerations\n\nDelimiting electoral districts can be a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process. Countries that choose to delimit electoral districts must be prepared to administer what may be a very complicated procedure and must be willing to spend the necessary funds to complete the process.\n\nAdministering the process will be complicated. Information from a wide variety of sources must be collected, verified, and synthesised. Districts must be drawn, and then must be evaluated – procedures that could involve political party and other stakeholders input. And after a final set of districts is adopted, they must be implemented. This usually requires changes to voter registration lists, and voter notification of new district assignments. In addition, election officials may have to redraw voting areas and relocate polling places. Ultimately, implementation may require a great deal of co-ordination with local and regional governments as well as election officials at the local, regional, and federal levels.\n\nWhile computers can make the delimitation process more efficient, computers can also complicate it. Computer hardware and software options must be examined carefully. A decision to acquire a computer system must take into account the amount of money to be invested in hardware and software, the time and expense of acquiring and training staff to operate the system, and the time and expense of converting maps and population data to a computer readable format.\n\nThe administration of the delimitation process may be challenging. It may be difficult to find and/or train qualified staff, particularly if the process is to be computerised. There may be obstacles in obtaining accurate and up-to-date information, especially maps. And there may be problems coordinating the collection and implementation processes with election officials and local government officials. All of these challenges must be met, however, if the delimitation process is to be accurate and timely.\n\nThe price tag for redistricting varies, some countries spend relatively little to redistrict, while others face increasing costs. The redistribution in Great Britain and Northern Ireland completed in 2008 cost £UK 13.6 million. The previous redistribution cost £UK 5 million. Similarly in Canada, the redistribution concluding in 2003 cost approximately $Can 10.1 million while the previous one in1997 cost approximately $Can 6.5 million. In the United States, enormous amounts of money are spent to redraw congressional districts every ten years. Of course, the redistricting process in the United States is quite decentralised, and the amount of money each state spends varies considerably: some states spend well over US$1 million to draw congressional districts, and millions more to defend these districts if challenged in court; other states, however, spend far less. But regardless of the actual amount spent, countries must recognize that delimitation is rarely a one-time event and must be prepared to devote the time and resources necessary to redraw electoral districts periodically.\n\n[1] This discussion draws heavily from an article written by Michael Steed entitled “The Constituency” which appeared in Representatives of the People? Parliamentarians and Constituencies in Western Democracies, edited by Vernon Bogdanor and published by Gower Publishing in 1985.\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nBecause delimitation, or redistricting, practices vary greatly around the world, there are few universal principles to guide the delimitation process. Countries disagree on fundamental issues, such as how impartial and independent the process can and should be from the legislative and political concerns. But there are several generally accepted principles:\n\nrepresentativeness;\n\nequality of voting strength;\n\nindependent, impartial boundary authority (or, at a minimum, reciprocity);\n\ntransparency;\n\nnon-discrimination.\n\nRepresentativeness\n\nElectoral district boundaries should be drawn such that constituents have an opportunity to elect candidates they feel truly represent them. This usually means that district boundaries should coincide with communities of interest as much as possible. Communities of interest can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, they can be geographically defined communities delineated by administrative boundaries or physical features such as mountains or islands, or they can be “communities” that share a common race, ethnic or tribal background, or the same religion or language. If districts are not composed of communities of interest, however defined, it may be difficult for representatives to serve the constituency well.\n\nEquality of Voting Strength\n\nElectoral district boundaries should be drawn so that districts are relatively equal in population. Equally populous districts allow voters to have an equally weighted vote in the election of representatives. If, for example, a representative is elected from a district that has twice as many voters as another district, voters in the larger district will have half the influence of voters in the smaller district. Electoral districts that vary greatly in population--a condition referred to as \"malapportionment\"--violate a central tenet of democracy, namely, that all voters should be able to cast a vote of equal weight.\n\nThe following are two standards developed to reflect this principle, one offered by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and one by the UN Committee on Human Rights (UNCHR):\n\nThe delineation of constituencies in which elections are conducted must preserve the equality of voting rights by providing approximately the same ratio of voters to elected representatives for each district. Existing administrative divisions or other relevant factors (including of a historical, demographic, or geographical nature) may be reflected in election districts, provided the design of the districts is consistent with the equality of voting and fair representation for different groups in society. (OSCE, “Inventory of OSCE Commitments and Other Principles for Democratic Elections”)\n\nThe principle of one person, one vote must apply, and within the framework of each State’s electoral system, the vote of one elector should be equal to the vote of another. The drawing of electoral boundaries and the method of allocating votes should not distort the distribution of voters or discriminate against any group and should not exclude or restrict unreasonably the right of citizens to choose their representatives freely. (UN Committee on Human Rights, General Comment 25, “The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right to Equal Access to Public Service”)\n\nIndependent, Impartial Boundary Authority\n\nIdeally, the legal framework for boundary delimitation should provide that the persons or institution responsible for drawing electoral boundaries be independent and impartial. In addition, the recommendations of the boundary authority should not be subject to modification or veto by the government or by the legislature.\n\nFailing this, the procedure for delimiting electoral districts should be clearly spelled out in legislation so that the rules regulating the process are the same, regardless of who is drawing the district boundaries – that is, the process should offer reciprocity. If political concerns are permitted to play a role in the process, then all political parties must be given access to the process. These rules must be clearly understood and must be acceptable to all major political parties and participants in the districting process.\n\nTransparency\n\nBecause electoral systems that feature districts often produce disproportional election outcomes, it is essential that the delimitation process be considered fair if the result is to be deemed legitimate by stakeholders and voters. This means that the delimitation process should be as transparent as possible, with the methodology and guidelines clearly established and publicised in advance. Incorporating public hearings into the process to allow stakeholders to offer comments for the boundary authority to consider is also important.\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\nElectoral boundaries should not be drawn in a manner that discriminates against any particular minority group. For example, dividing a geographically-concentrated minority group among several electoral districts so that the group constitutes a minority of the voters in every single electoral district should be prohibited. Of course, electoral systems that rely exclusively on single-member districts cannot guarantee even some minimal percentage of seats for minority groups or minority political parties in the population. However, this fact should not open the door to active discrimination against a given minority group.\n\nDelimiting Electoral Districts\n\nThe delimitation of electoral districts is a fairly recent phenomenon. Prior to the nineteenth century, the composition of legislatures reflected the view that distinct categories of society (i.e., towns, the clergy, and the nobility) should be represented and not individual citizens. This view of representation led to legislatures based on subdivisions that varied greatly with regard to the size of population being represented.\n\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century, and throughout the nineteenth century, citizens began to demand a broadening of their franchise. These demands were accompanied by the belief that \"fair\" representation entailed an equalisation of population per representative. The response to this quest for the equalisation of representation was either to vary the number of legislators elected from a territory or to subdivide territories into electoral districts of more equal population. Single-member districts for the election of legislators were first adopted in the British colonies that later became the United States. Many European countries gradually followed suit and adopted single-member electoral districts during the nineteenth century.\n\nThe trend towards single-member districts in Europe ebbed with the advent of proportional representation in the late nineteenth century. Because multimember districts are generally used with systems of proportional representation, countries that adopted such systems no longer needed to delimit electoral districts. Instead, equality of population could be achieved by varying the numbers of legislators from a territory. The use of administrative divisions such as states, provinces, or counties as multimember districts also provided the additional benefit of community representation.\n\nThe tradition of single-member electoral districts was retained in other countries, however, in the belief that distinct benefits are derived from their use. These benefits include:\n\na strong geographic link between constituents and their representatives;\n\nthe ability of constituents to hold individual representatives accountable;\n\nthe tendency of an electoral system using single-member districts to produce strong single-party governments, and, by extension, a stable political system.\n\nA major drawback to the use of single-member districts is that electoral district boundaries must be adjusted periodically to maintain populations of relatively equal size. Of course, in some countries, multimember districts must also be redrawn. Not only is the district delimitation process expensive and time consuming, but there is also the possibility that drawing new district boundaries could favour, intentionally or unintentionally, one particular interest or political party over others.\n\nIn some countries, multimember districts are also redrawn. How electoral districts are drawn, whether the districts are single-member or multimember, and whether they follow existing administrative boundaries or not can influence the nature of representation by elected legislators. This section considers the various types of electoral systems that delimit electoral districts (see Electoral Systems that Delimit Electoral Districts). It also considers electoral districting alternatives, such as the magnitude of the districts and whether or not the district boundaries should be aligned with pre-existing administrative boundaries (see Electoral District Alternatives).\n\nElectoral Systems that Delimit Electoral Districts\n\nTraditionally, three broad categories of electoral systems have been described: plurality systems, majority systems, and proportional representation systems. The most important element that differentiates these electoral systems from one another is the means by which seats in the legislature are allocated:\n\nto candidates receiving a plurality of the vote\n\nto candidates obtaining a majority of the vote\n\nproportionally on the basis of votes cast for political parties or candidates\n\nA recent addition to these three broad categories of electoral systems is the mixed electoral system, which combines elements of both proportional representation and plurality or majority voting systems.\n\nDelimiting Districts: Plurality or Majority Systems\n\nThe delimitation of electoral districts is most commonly associated with plurality or majority electoral systems. Both systems tend to rely heavily, if not exclusively, on single-member electoral districts. These districts must be redrawn periodically to reflect shifts in the population. Both systems also share one fundamental element because of their reliance on single-member districts--the number of seats that a political party receives depends not only on the proportion of the votes it received, but also on where those votes were cast. Under plurality and majority systems, minority political parties whose supporters are not geographically concentrated usually obtain fewer seats than their proportion of the vote would suggest they are entitled. The multimember districts of proportional systems can rectify this distortion in the transfer of votes to seats because the larger the magnitude of the electoral districts, the more proportional the results.\n\nThe process of electoral district delimitation in a plurality system is important because the configuration of districts can affect the partisan, and possibly even the racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic composition of the legislature. The effect may be intentional, as in a partisan \"gerrymander,\" or it may be unintentional. Even district boundaries drawn by a neutral boundary commission may unintentionally favour one party over others.\n\nMajority electoral systems can, and do, produce election outcomes that are just as disproportional as plurality electoral systems with regard to the ratio of seats to votes. This is not surprising, given that both systems rely almost exclusively on single-member districts. The district delimitation process in a majority system is, therefore, just as important as it is in a plurality electoral system.\n\nFor more information on plurality or majority electoral systems see the Electoral Systems: Plurality/Majority Systems.\n\nDelimiting Districts: Proportional Representation\n\nThere are two major types of proportional representation systems: the party list system and the single transferable vote. (The mixed member proportional system also produces proportional results, but this system will be discussed under the \"mixed system\" category.) The party list system is the far more common of the two. Under the party list system, electoral districts rarely, if ever, require delimitation. If electoral districts are employed, they are relatively large multimember districts whose boundaries generally correspond to administrative divisions. To accommodate shifts in population, the number of seats allocated to individual multimember districts is adjusted, rather than redrawing the boundaries of the districts. The single transferable vote, used in Ireland and Malta, is the other type of proportional representation. Because voting is on the basis of candidates, not parties, these countries employ small multimember districts with only three to five members elected per district. Electoral district boundaries must therefore be redrawn periodically in these two countries.\n\nDelimiting Districts: Mixed Electoral Systems\n\nMixed electoral systems are becoming increasingly popular. They employ both party list proportional representation and single-member electoral districts with plurality or majority vote requirements. The German electoral system is the prototypical mixed electoral system.\n\nBecause mixed systems incorporate single-member districts, the delimitation of electoral districts must occur periodically to adjust for shifts in the population. The importance of the delimitation process and the influence that district configurations have on the outcome of elections is dependent on whether party list seats are used to correct any distortions in the relationship between seats to votes produced by the single-member districts. In countries such as Germany, seats allocated under the party list system are used to compensate for any distortions in the seats-to-votes ratio produced at the electoral district level. Mixed systems that use party list seats in a compensatory manner are sometimes called \"mixed member proportional\" systems because the election results are proportional.\n\nIn countries such as Russia, party list seats are not used to compensate for any disproportionality arising from elections in single-member districts. Rather, seats allocated to the parties under the party list component of the election are simply added to the seats won at the electoral district level. The partisan seats-to-votes ratio may therefore be distorted. In this type of mixed system, sometimes called a \"parallel\" system, the district delimitation process is more important because it can have a more pronounced effect on the partisan composition of the legislature.\n\nElectoral District Alternatives\n\nTwo important factors to be considered when contemplating electoral districting alternatives are: (1) district magnitude and (2) the alignment of electoral district boundaries with existing administrative and/or political boundaries. District magnitude refers to the number of legislative seats assigned to a district[1]. A district can be either a single-member district or a multimember district, where the number of seats may range from two to one hundred or more. Electoral districts can be aligned with administrative divisions—that is, administrative divisions can be used as electoral districts—or electoral districts can be specially drawn with little regard for administrative divisions, usually to meet equal population criteria.\n\nThese two factors form a matrix [2]. The first dimension, district magnitude, relates to the issue of single-member versus multimember districts. The second dimension refers to the alignment or nonalignment of electoral districts with administrative or political boundaries.\n\nMost single-member districts fall into the nonalignment category. The districts tend to be artificial pieces of geography that have no meaning outside the electoral context. Some single-member districts, however, particularly those in proportional representation countries, are small, highly distinctive communities. For example, a few small cantons in Switzerland form single-member districts.\n\nCountries with multimember districts often use existing administrative divisions as electoral districts. Each district is assigned the appropriate number of legislative seats for its population, with individual districts having as few as two representatives and most districts having far more than two representatives. These countries usually employ some form of proportional representation. The more artificially constructed multimember districts are found in countries such as Ireland and Malta, which use districts that are uniformly small in magnitude because elections are conducted using the single transferable vote.\n\nMore information on the Alignment of Districts with Administrative Boundaries can be found here.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] According to Taagepera and Shugart, the term \"magnitude\" is preferable to \"size,\" because size usually refers to the number of voters in an electoral district or the geographic extent of a district. See Rein Taagerpera and Matthew Soberg Shugart, Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989)\n\n[2] Michael Steed, \"The Constituency,\" in Representative of the People? Parliamentarians and Constituencies in Western Democracies, ed. Vernon Bogdanor (Grower Publishing, 1985)\n\nDistrict Magnitude\n\nDistrict magnitude refers to the number of legislative seats assigned to a district. Countries have adopted electoral rules that range anywhere from the exclusive use of single-member districts to a system where the entire country, in effect, functions as a single district. The United States and the United Kingdom are at one end of the spectrum, in which each and every legislator represents a single district. At the other end of the spectrum are countries such as Israel and the Netherlands, in which the district magnitude is equal to the total number of members of the legislature. Most countries are somewhere in the middle of this range; and within a country there is often a wide variation in the magnitude of districts.\n\nSome countries set all their electoral districts at the same magnitude or within some narrow range of magnitudes. District boundaries are then usually drawn according to some voters-per-representative formula. This approach has been adopted in the United States and most other countries with plurality or majority electoral systems, where the district magnitude is set at one. This procedure is also used in Ireland and Malta, both of which employ small multimember districts and the single transferable vote. In Malta, all districts have a magnitude of five. In Ireland, the range in magnitude is from three to five.\n\nAlternatively, some countries use existing regional, administrative or political divisions as electoral districts. Each electoral district is then assigned a specific number of seats according to its population. Most countries with electoral systems based on proportional representation use this procedure. The larger the district magnitude, the more proportional the outcome of the election--that is, the more seats per district, the closer the approximation between a political party's percentage of the vote and the number of seats that party receives in the legislature.\n\nSingle-member electoral districts must be redrawn periodically to ensure relatively equal populations. Some countries with uniformly small multimember districts must also redistrict periodically in order to comply with equal population standards. Electoral districts with large magnitudes, however, do not need to be redrawn; seats are simply reassigned from one district to another to meet equal population standards.\n\nSingle-Member and Multimember Districts\n\nThe debate about the advantages and disadvantages of single-member and multimember districts overlaps, to a large extent, with the debate over plurality or majority systems and proportional representation systems. This is because plurality and majority systems usually employ single-member districts, and proportional representation systems use multimember districts.\n\nFor the purpose of boundary delimitation, single-member districts\n\nensure geographic representation\n\nHowever, single-member districts\n\nmust be redrawn on a regular basis to maintain populations of relatively equal size;\n\nare usually artificial geographic entities whose boundaries do not delineate clearly identifiable communities, and as a consequence, the entities have no particular relevance to citizens;\n\nMultimember districts:\n\ncan more easily reflect administrative divisions or communities of interest within the country because there is flexibility with regard to the numbers of representatives per district and, therefore, the size and geographic composition of the district; and\n\nneed not change boundaries, even if the population of a district increases or decreases, because the number of representatives elected from the district can be altered;\n\nAdvantages of Single-Member Districts\n\nSupporters cite several advantages, namely that single-member districts:\n\nprovide voters with strong constituency representation because each voter has a single, easily identifiable, district representative;\n\nencourage constituency service by providing voters with an easily identifiable \"ombudsman\";\n\nmaximise accountability because a single representative can be held responsible and can be re-elected or defeated in the next election;\n\nensure geographic representation.\n\nDisadvantages of Single-Member Districts\n\nIn citing disadvantages, critics point out that single-member districts:\n\nmust be redrawn on a regular basis to maintain populations of relatively equal size;\n\nare usually artificial geographic entities whose boundaries do not delineate clearly identifiable communities, and as a consequence, the entities have no particular relevance to citizens;\n\nbecause of their tendency to over-represent the majority party and under-represent other parties, cannot produce proportional representation for political parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe strengths of single-member districts rest in the close ties between representatives and constituents, the accountability of representatives to the voters, and constituency service. Because single-member districts are used in conjunction with plurality or majority voting rules, they are also said to foster strong and stable government.\n\nAlignment of Districts with Administrative Boundaries\n\nIn many countries, especially those that employ multimember districts, the boundaries of electoral districts follow the boundaries of existing administrative divisions--usually states or provinces. Often these administrative divisions have some historical significance. Some administrative divisions, however, may be of recent vintage and of little relevance to citizens.\n\nThere are certain advantages to aligning electoral districts with administrative divisions, in that the districts will then\n\ncorrespond to the entities that administer local governmental functions;\n\ncorrespond to social, political, and other non-governmental organisations arranged by administrative areas;\n\nbe more meaningful to constituents if the districts correspond to well-recognised administrative divisions;\n\nreflect geographic communities of interest when the administrative divisions themselves reflect distinct communities of interest.\n\nCorrespondence with Governmental Functions\n\nAdministrative divisions may be assigned important governmental functions. For example, local government entities may have responsibilities for levying taxes or administering justice, education or public health. Constituents of local government entities can benefit from being able to identify and relate to the elected representatives from districts that correspond to these administrative divisions, especially if constituents need help in dealing with these governmental agencies.\n\nIn addition, a country's election machinery may be organised around administrative divisions. If so, it may be easier to conduct elections if electoral district boundaries correspond to administrative boundaries.\n\nCorrespondence with Non-Governmental Organisations\n\nGovernmental agencies are not the only organisations that operate within specific administrative divisions. Many social, cultural, and political organisations are also arranged according to administrative areas. Such organisations may include political parties, trade unions, professional associations and many other occupational, social, and cultural organisations. Members of these organisations may benefit by being able to identify and relate to elected representatives from the same administrative division. Elected representatives, too, may find it easier to work with and communicate with members of these non-governmental organisations.\n\nRecognition of Electoral Districts\n\nLong-standing state or provincial boundaries engender a corporate identity that voters can relate to more easily than artificially created electoral districts. Voters may be able to distinguish between their district and other districts and identify their elected representative more easily if electoral districts are defined by administrative boundaries.\n\nReflection of Communities of Interest\n\nElectoral districts that are composed of long-standing state or provincial territories may reflect geographically concentrated communities of interest based on a common heritage or on shared racial, ethnic, religious or language characteristics. Some of the more modern administrative entities that form the basis of electoral districts, however, may have little in the way of common roots. Consequently, these districts do not bring together constituents with common interests.\n\nDrawbacks to Using Administrative Divisions\n\nAdministrative divisions do not have the same level of importance throughout the world. Although they reflect important regional differences in some countries, administrative divisions in other countries have been created very recently. In these countries, the boundaries are artificial and of little significance to citizens. In fact, the boundaries may divide natural communities of interest such as long-standing racial, ethnic, religious, or spoken language communities. Using administrative entities to form electoral districts in this instance may actually conflict with the creation of electoral districts that reflect strong communities of interest.\n\nSingle-Member Districts and Administrative Divisions\n\nAligning electoral districts with administrative boundaries is a very common practice in countries with multimember electoral districts. However, correspondence with administrative divisions is more problematic in countries that employ single-member districts exclusively. This is because there is often a conflict between drawing single-member districts that follow existing administrative lines and drawing single-member districts that are relatively equal in population.\n\nThis is not to suggest that single-member districts can never correspond to administrative divisions within a country. Many countries that use single-member districts do emphasise the need to respect administrative boundaries. But the weight given to this consideration varies, depending on the importance placed on equality of population and other redistricting criteria that may conflict with respect for administrative divisions. For example, in the United Kingdom, large numerical deviations in population were tolerated in order to accommodate local administrative areas. This changed with the passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 which sets a variance of plus or minus five percent of the United Kingdom electoral quota. In the United States, congressional district boundaries never cross state lines; the strict enforcement of equality of numbers, however, is far more important than respect for local administrative boundaries.\n\nCountry Survey of Delimitation Practices\n\nInformation on the delimitation practices of 87 countries (or territories) was assembled and summarized for the Delimitation Equity Project conducted by IFES from 2004-2005.\n\nData was collected through a variety of means:\n\n(1) the compilation of constitutional and election law provisions on constituency delimitation;\n\n(2) information gathered during a series of election missions undertaken by the author on behalf of IFES and other organizations; and\n\n(3) three surveys conducted over the last few years:\n\nA delimitation survey sent to election administrations around the world in the fall of 2004.\n\nComparative Data section of the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network, which includes a series of questions on delimitation practices.\n\nA comparative redistricting project that included a conference, a survey, and a series of case studies, funded in large part by the National Science Foundation. (The Comparative Redistricting Project, which included a conference entitled \"Redistricting from a Comparative Perspective\" held December 7-9, 2001, was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California, Irvine.)\n\nCountries that Delimit Electoral Districts\n\nThe 87 countries (or territories) for which information was collected represent a broad geographic array: 21 of the countries are located in the Americas, 34 in Europe, 15 in Africa, 2 in the Middle East, 11 in Asia and 4 in Oceania (Australia/South Pacific Islands).\n\nOf these 87 countries, 60 (69 percent of the total number of countries) reported delimiting electoral districts. The breakdown by region of the countries that delimit electoral districts is as follows:\n\nThe majority of countries in every region represented in the survey delimited electoral districts. Countries in the Americas were the least likely to have specifically delimited electoral districts: although every country in North America (Canada, Mexico and the United States) and most countries in the Caribbean delimit constituencies, very few in Central and South America do so. Countries in Oceania – Australia, New Zealand, and most of the South Pacific Island countries – are the most likely to have specifically delimited electoral districts.\n\nAlmost without exception, the countries that do not specifically delimit districts are countries that have List Proportional Representation (List PR) electoral systems (Georgia and Panama are the only countries surveyed that do not have a List Proportional Representation electoral system and do not periodically delimit electoral districts). Every other type of electoral system included in this study requires some delimitation of electoral districts: First Past the Post (FPTP) Systems, Two Round Systems (TRS), Alternative Vote (AV) and Block Vote (BV) Systems, and Parallel and Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) Systems.\n\nStructure and Rules for Delimiting Electoral Districts\n\nCountries that delimit electoral districts must establish rules and a formal structure for carrying out the process. Because different sets of districts can produce different election outcomes, even if underlying voting patterns remain the same, the choices involved in the design of the redistricting process are important. Included among those decisions are the following:\n\nWho should draw the district lines?\n\nWho should decide on the final districting plan?\n\nUnder what grounds should the district lines be determined?\n\nShould the legislature have a role in drawing the districts or deciding on the final plan?\n\nShould the general public have input into the redistricting process?\n\nHow often do districts need to be redrawn?\n\nHow long will the redistricting process take to complete?\n\nShould formal criteria be established for line drawers to consider? If so, what criteria should be established?\n\nShould the plan be subject to challenge in the courts?\n\nThe task of drawing districts must be assigned to some boundary authority. The composition of the boundary authority and the degree of independence granted to this authority vary considerably from country to country. Traditionally, legislatures have been allowed to draw their own districts. Increasingly, however, countries are turning the process over to independent commissions. This is part of an international movement to eliminate \"politics\" from the redistricting process.\n\nReforms that have replaced legislatures with redistricting commissions have also included provisions for increasing public access to the redistricting process and identifying formal criteria for commissioners to consider when drawing districts. These redistricting criteria are usually listed in the electoral laws of the country. The criteria often include factors such as equality of population, respect for local administrative boundaries and other geographic features such as natural (physically-defined) boundaries, and recognition of communities of interest.\n\nCountries usually have not adopted redistricting criteria pertaining to the actual outcome of the redistricting process--for example, fair representation for political parties or minority groups. This is because single-member districts, used by many of the countries that delimit electoral districts, cannot guarantee results that are proportional, or even minimal, for minority political parties or minority racial, ethnic, religious or special language groups in the population. Some countries, however, have adopted special provisions designed to modify the distorting effects of single-member districts and to ensure some degree of representation for minority groups.\n\nThis section examines the choices countries have made for rules and a structure to carry out redistricting, including:\n\nthe composition of the authority charged with drawing the district boundaries, the degree of independence from legislative or partisan considerations granted to that authority, and which entities have input into the selection of the final districting plan (see Designation of a Boundary Authority);\n\nthe frequency of redistricting and the deadlines that have been established for completing the redistricting process (see Frequency of Electoral District Delimitation and Length of Time Permitted for the Delimitation Process);\n\nprovisions for public input into the redistricting process (see Public Access to the Delimitation Process);\n\nthe establishment of criteria to guide the redistricting process (see Establishment of Criteria for Delimiting Districts);\n\nthe role of the courts, if any, in the redistricting process (see Role of the Courts in Electoral District Delimitation).\n\nDesignation of a Boundary Authority\n\nCountries that delimit electoral districts must designate a boundary authority and establish some machinery for carrying out the task of redistricting. The task assigned to the boundary authority is the same in all countries: divide the country into districts for the election of representatives.\n\nThe composition of the boundary authority and the degree of independence from the legislature or partisan concerns granted to this authority, however, vary considerably from country to country. Some countries allow legislators to draw their own districts. Other countries, in an attempt to remove \"politics\" from the process, assign the task of redistricting to an independent boundary commission. In some countries, redistricting is centralised under a single redistricting authority while in other countries, states or provinces draw their own districts, with or without a uniform set of rules. In many countries, the boundary authority is granted the power to choose the final districting plan. But in some countries with non-legislative boundary authorities, the legislature or the government must approve the final districting plan before it can be implemented.\n\nThe types of boundary authorities countries have established and the degree of independence countries have accorded these authorities cover a broad spectrum. At one end of the spectrum is the United States, where the redistricting process is very political and decentralised. The responsibility for drawing districts for the United States Congress rests individually with the fifty states. There are few limitations on the states, and the boundary authorities are almost always political entities, i.e., state legislatures.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are many of the Commonwealth countries, where politicians have opted out of the redistricting process and granted the authority to redistrict to neutral or independent commissions. A central agency may draw districts for the entire country. If the central agency does not actually draw the districts, it establishes guidelines for regional commissions and oversees the redistribution process. The final decision as to which district boundaries should be implemented often rests with the commission and not with the legislature.\n\nThis section will examine alternative approaches to the designation of a boundary authority. It will discuss the composition of the boundary authority, whether the authority should be partisan or non-partisan, and whether a central authority or regional authorities should perform the task of redistricting. Who has the authority to make the final decision as to which set of district boundaries are to be implemented will also be considered.\n\nComposition of the Boundary Authority\n\nA substantial majority of the countries that delimit electoral districts employ a specially designated boundary commission or an election management body to draw these boundaries. The legislature serves as the boundary authority in several countries. And in a few countries, government agencies are charged with the task of redistricting.\n\nBritain was an early pioneer of establishing an independent boundary commission to define electoral districts[1]. Many established democracies once governed by the United Kingdom followed this example and adopted boundary (or delimitation) commissions, including Australia and Canada, Caribbean countries such as the Bahamas, Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines and several Anglophone African countries (i.e., Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe) also adopted boundary commissions for delimiting constituencies.\n\nComposition of Boundary Commissions\n\nBoundary commissions tend to be relatively small in size, ranging from three to seven or nine members. Canada, for example, has three-member commissions, the United Kingdom has four-member commissions, and a number of Caribbean countries have five-member commissions (e.g., Bahamas, Barbados). Germany and New Zealand each have seven-member commissions (New Zealand actually has 8 members but one, the Chair of the Local Government Commission, does not have a vote); Albania has a nine-member commission.\n\nThe commissions often include non-partisan (non-political) public officials with backgrounds in election administration, geography, and statistics. In Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, for example, the commissions incorporate electoral officers or registrar-generals, as well as the Director of Ordnance Survey (United Kingdom) and the Surveyor-General (Australia and New Zealand). Statisticians have an important role on Australian commissions because population projections are used to draw electoral district boundaries. In Canada, academics knowledgeable about elections and/or geography may be asked to serve on boundary commissions.\n\nMembers of the judiciary are also well represented on districting commissions in many countries. They often chair the commissions, as in Canada and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, senior judges serve as Deputy Chairs of the four Boundary Commissions in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In India, two of the three members of the Delimitation Commission are required to be judges.\n\nMany countries with boundary commissions exclude anyone with political connections from serving on the commission. On the other hand, some countries specifically include representatives of the major political parties on the commission. For example, in New Zealand, two “political” appointees, one representing the governing party and one the opposition parties, serve on the seven-member Representation Commission. The theory behind their presence on the commission is that it helps ensure that any political bias in a proposed delimitation plan is recognized and rectified. However, because the two political appointees constitute a minority of the commission, they cannot outvote the non-political commissioners. Other countries that incorporate political party representatives on the boundary commission include Albania, Bahamas, Barbados, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and St. Vincent.\n\nBotswana is one of the countries that specifically excludes any person with political connections from serving on the boundary commission. Other examples include Australia, Canada, India, and Mauritius.\n\nElection Management Bodies\n\nAnother, equally common, approach to delimiting constituencies is the use of the election commission. In some countries, the election commission is quite independent of the executive and the legislature (Lithuania, Mexico, and Poland, for example), but in other countries this is less true (e.g., Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania).\n\nLegislature\n\nAlthough many countries have delegated the task of delimitation to an authority other than the obviously self-interested legislature, in some countries the legislature has retained this responsibility.\n\nHowever, a number of countries in which the legislature is responsible for delimitation are countries with List Proportional Representation (List PR) electoral systems. The legislatures in these countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, and Sweden) originally defined a set of electoral district boundaries (often multimember districts) in the constitution or electoral law, and these constituencies have remained in place for subsequent elections – although the number of seats assigned to the multimember constituencies vary over time depending on the population size.\n\nA second set of countries in which the legislature plays a role in the delimitation process are countries with mixed electoral systems like Italy, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, and Panama. The boundaries of the constituencies in these countries are of less political consequence than in those with a First Past the Post electoral system because a separate set of legislative seats are filled via proportional representation. Elections in mixed systems usually produce outcomes that are far more proportional than FPTP systems.\n\nThe United States is one of the very few democracies that allows the legislature a dominant role in the delimitation process given that the election of legislators is based solely on single-member constituencies. The consequence of this approach, at least in the United States, is that partisan politics plays a very large role – and often quite explicit role – in the redistricting process. For example, on several occasions when a redistricting plan was challenged in court on the grounds that the plan constituted a racial gerrymandering, defendants claimed that politics, and not race, was the motivating factor behind the plan hence the plan was neither illegal nor unconstitutional.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] New Zealand established an independent boundary commission in 1887 that included government-appointed members; however, the government-appointed members never exceeded the number of politically neutral public servants included on the commission.\n\nPartisan Considerations in Choosing a Boundary Authority\n\nSince different electoral district configurations produce different election outcomes, even if voting patterns remain constant, the designation of a boundary authority and the powers granted to that authority are very important.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, districts almost everywhere were drawn by the legislatures. Legislators from the majority political party were often tempted to draw districting plans that favoured their own candidates at the expense of the candidates from other parties. The redistricting, process came under increasing attack for political bias because of this practice.\n\nOver the past fifty years, a growing number of countries have moved to neutral or non-partisan commissions to avoid politically biased redistricting. In 1964, when Canada adopted independent electoral boundary commissions for redistricting, the United States was left as one of the few long-standing liberal democracies where the redistricting process remains in the hands of the politicians. The United States has also been one of the only countries to accept partisanship as an inevitable part of the redistricting process.\n\nDisagreeing with the proposition that politics cannot be removed from the redistricting process, many countries have established neutral commissions and enacted rules for drawing district boundaries. These commissions have no formal links to political parties, and commissioners are not permitted to consider political data when drawing district boundaries. Instead, commissioners are obliged to consider criteria such as equal population and respect for administrative boundaries in deciding upon district configurations. Since the adoption of these reforms, few have questioned the neutrality of the redistricting process in these countries.\n\nThe only drawback to the non-partisan approach to redistricting is that it does not necessarily produce a politically unbiased redistricting plan: Ignoring politics does not mean that a districting plan has no political effect. The non-partisan approach guarantees only that any political bias in a districting plan is unintentional.\n\nSolutions for Political Bias in Redistricting\n\nSome countries have attempted to devise solutions to the problem of political bias in redistricting outcomes. One solution, for example, is to allow representatives of all the major political parties to serve on the body that makes redistricting decisions. Another solution is to permit representatives of major political parties to analyse the potential partisan impact of a districting plan before the plan is enacted and comment on the plans. In the United States, one or both of these approaches have been adopted by most of the states.\n\nIn the United States, a legislative committee or a bipartisan commission may draw a districting plan. Political data to ascertain the potential partisan effect of a plan will almost certainly be employed. Because a districting plan is almost always enacted by the state legislature, the likely result, however, is a plan that knowingly favours one political party or the incumbent legislators of both parties rather than a politically unbiased plan.\n\nNew Zealand has adopted another approach to the problem of politically biased outcomes: Two of the seven members of the New Zealand Representation Commission are political appointees. One of these two partisan members represents the governing party, the other one represents the opposition parties. Their presence on the commission helps to ensure that any egregious political bias is recognised and rectified. Because the two political appointees constitute a minority on the commission, they cannot outvote the non-political commissioners. The neutrality of the commission is, therefore, unquestioned.\n\nDegrees of Boundary Authority Centralisation\n\nCountries vary in the degree to which the delimitation process is centralised. At one end of the spectrum, the delimitation, or redistricting, process is very decentralised, with regional entities such as states or provinces responsible for drawing their own federal electoral districts. Little, if any, federal guidance is provided to these regional entities. At the other end of the spectrum are those countries in which a single central agency is charged with drawing districts for the entire country. In the middle of the spectrum are countries that have established central agencies, but these agencies do not actually draw federal electoral districts. Instead, they may establish guidelines for regional commissions to follow when drawing district boundaries, and they may oversee the federal redistricting process.\n\nThe United States is at one end of the spectrum. There the redistricting process is completely decentralised. Once the U.S. Congress apportions congressional seats among the states, each of the fifty states is responsible for drawing the allotted number of congressional districts within its own borders. Each state adopts its own redistricting procedures and determines its own redistricting criteria. There is some guidance from the federal government and the courts, however, but this guidance is limited for the most part to the areas of population equality and minority voting rights.\n\nAustralia and Canada, despite employing federal systems like the United States, have adopted redistricting procedures that are more centralised. In Australia, separate commissions for the redistribution of federal electoral districts were established in each state at the turn of the century. Canada borrowed this practice in 1964 when it determined that federal redistribution should be conducted by independent commissions established in each province. However, both Canada and Australia provide the state or provincial commissions charged with creating federal electoral districts with a uniform set of criteria for redistribution. Both countries also provide some degree of central co-ordination for federal redistribution.\n\nElections Canada, a permanent federal agency, coordinates the process of federal redistribution in Canada by bringing commission members (including the chairpersons) together for discussions before the process begins. Elections Canada also provides each provincial commission with a database for federal redistricting and trained support staff.\n\nIn Australia, the federal electoral commissioner--the administrative head and one of the three members of the Australian Electoral Commission--has a seat on each of the state redistribution commissions charged with federal redistricting. The other two members of the Australian Electoral Commission are added to form augmented redistribution commissions for federal redistributions within each state.\n\nIn most other countries, redistricting is centralised in a single federal agency that draws districts for the entire country. In Germany, a permanent seven-member constituency committee determines the district boundaries for the entire country (although each state has a voice in the process). In New Zealand, the seven-member Representation Commission undertakes redistribution for the entire country. In France, the Ministry of Interior drew district lines for the entire country when single-member districts were restored in 1986. And in India, a delimitation commission whose decisions were implemented in 2008, conducted the process administratively for the entire country.\n\nConclusion\n\nA major advantage of a centralised redistricting process is that the redistricting criteria can be interpreted or applied without regional variation and, as a result, districts may be more uniform in construction. A major advantage of a decentralised process is that district boundaries are drawn by individuals more familiar with regional geography, communities of interest, and other local circumstances.\n\nAuthority for Choosing the Final Districting Plan\n\nIn the nineteenth century, in nearly every country that delimited districts, legislative approval was required before a redistricting plan could be implemented. Recent reforms designed to remove politics from the redistricting process have reduced the power of legislatures to approve redistricting plans. In many countries today, the legislature plays only a limited role or no role at all in the redistricting process. However, some countries do require executive approval, rather than legislative approval, before a redistricting plan can be implemented. While this removes the decision from legislators--those who directly benefit from the districting plan--it still leaves the redistricting process open to charges of political influence.\n\nIn the majority of countries that assign election management bodies the task of delimiting constituencies, the election commission serves as the final authority; the approval of the legislature or executive is not required to implement the delimitation plan. This is less true of boundary commissions – more often than not, a constituency plan proposed by a boundary commission must be enacted by the legislature (or signed by the executive) before it can be implemented. However, in New Zealand, for example, the final plan of the Representation Committee, once published, cannot be changed or appealed. Since 1983, Australia’s augmented Electoral Commission has had the same power. The constituency boundaries created by the Delimitation Commission in India are also final.\n\nIn other countries, the legislature can debate and, possibly, even delay the enactment of a commission's plan, but it cannot modify the plan. In Canada, for instance, the 1964 Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act removed the responsibility for redistricting from the Parliament and gave it to independent electoral commissions in each province. Parliament is permitted to consider plans produced by the commissions but has no vote on their implementation. Parliament used this provision to delay the implementation of plans, however, prompting a change in the law--there is now a sixty day limit on Parliamentary debate and consideration.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the final proposals of the four Boundary Commissions take effect only after an affirmative vote by Parliament. But Parliament's power to accept or reject a plan is a formality. It has almost always affirmed commission proposals; to do otherwise would be viewed as \"political.\" The only two exceptions were in 1948, when Parliament proposed the addition of seventeen seats for under-represented urban areas, and in 1969, when Parliament delayed the implementation of a redistribution plan on the grounds that impending changes to local government boundaries would render the plan obsolete. Conservatives viewed both of these actions by the Labour government as political.\n\nSome countries have provisions requiring the legislature to either accept or reject the proposed delimitation plan, but specifically do not grant parliament the authority to modify the plan. Examples of this approach include Malaysia, Mauritius, and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe United States is the anomaly with regard to legislatures and the adoption of redistricting plans. Most states assign the task of federal redistricting to the state legislature. The few that assign the task to an agency or a commission still require an affirmative vote of the state legislature to enact a redistricting plan.\n\nConclusion\n\nAllowing the legislature to accept or reject a plan--let alone create it--opens the redistricting process up to charges of political bias. In fact, many plans adopted by legislatures do favour one political party over others. Still, plans drawn by neutral commissions can also produce politically biased election outcomes, however unintentional.\n\nFrequency of Electoral District Delimitation\n\nThe majority of countries that delimit electoral districts have established some mandatory time interval within which delimitation must occur. Although there is no standard time period, the range of intervals for delimitation is not particularly large. The Seychelles requires the delimitation of new constituency boundaries as often as every three years if necessary. On the other hand, France requires the delimitation of electoral districts only every 12 to 14 years.\n\nThe most popular choice for periodic delimitation appears to be ten years: Botswana, Canada, India (although amendments to the Constitution cancelled the delimitations following the 1981 and 1991 censuses and delayed the exercise following the 2011 census), Japan, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania, the United States, and Yemen all have electoral laws or constitutional provisions requiring delimitation at least every 10 years (in the case of Botswana, the requirement is every five to ten years; in Kenya, the law dictates that delimitation occur every eight to ten years).\n\nAlbania, Bahamas, Fiji, New Zealand, Turkey, and Zimbabwe redraw their electoral districts every five years. Australia delimits at least every seven years. Ireland is required to delimit multimember constituencies for their Single Transferable Voting System every 12 years; the United Kingdom also permits up to twelve years to lapse before undertaking another delimitation exercise.\n\nOf course, the establishment of a mandatory time interval does not necessarily mean that redistricting will occur. After delimiting constituencies in 1973, India placed a moratorium on delimitation until after the year 2000, despite a legal provision requiring redistricting after every decennial census.\n\nNo specific time interval has been established in about one third of the countries that delimit electoral districts. Common triggers for delimitation other than a specified time period include: following a national census, a change in the number of seats apportioned to an area, changes in administrative boundaries, and reaching a prescribed level of malapportionment. For example, in Macedonia, the degree of malapportionment cannot exceed three percent; if it does, delimitation must occur. In the Czech Republic, the prescribed level of malapportionment prompting a delimitation exercise is 15 percent; in Germany, the trigger is 25 percent.\n\nThe disadvantage of infrequent redistricting is the wide discrepancies in district populations that often result over time. Districts that are drawn with very small population deviations at the beginning of a decade, for instance, may vary considerably in size by the end of the decade.\n\nAustralia has adopted a unique solution to this problem. Rather than use current enrolment figures, federal electoral districts are redrawn using projections, such that the number of electors enrolled in each district will be equal three and one-half years into the future, the midpoint of Australia's seven-year redistricting cycle.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe disadvantages of frequent redistricting are the costs in money and time to undertake the process. In addition, frequent changes to district boundaries disrupt ties between representatives and their constituencies. To determine the optimal interval, countries must balance the costs of redistricting with the benefits of maintaining districts with some measure of population equality.\n\nLength of Time Permitted for the Delimitation Process\n\nWhile there are no time constraints on the delimitation process in some countries, other countries impose quite rigid constraints on the length of time permitted for the redistricting process. The existence or absence of a legal deadline, however, does not necessarily relate to the time actually taken to redraw districts.\n\nNeither the United States nor the United Kingdom imposes a mandatory time limit for completion of the redistricting process. Although there is no federal law and few state constitutions that set time limits, candidate-filing deadlines for upcoming congressional elections serve as a practical deadline for federal redistricting in the United States. If a state legislature does not complete redistricting by the candidate-filing deadline, the courts will intervene and either draw a plan of their own or implement a districting plan proposed by one of the parties to the court case. Hence, the practical, if not legally imposed, time period for redistricting in the United States is two years, beginning with the date that numbers from the decennial census are released and ending with the candidate-filing deadline for the first congressional election of the decade.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the redistribution process can take more than twice as long as it does in the United States. The last English Boundary Commission Report, completed in 2006, took six years to prepare.\n\nBy contrast, redistricting in Australia and New Zealand takes less than one year. In 1984, for example, Australia undertook an extensive redistribution. Districts for the 125 seats in the Lower House were redrawn to create 148 new districts. The entire process--drawing up proposals, holding public inquiries, and modifying proposals to produce a final plan--took only six months to complete. In New Zealand a representation commission is required file its report no later than eight months after formal deliberations begin.\n\nTwo factors that appear to affect the length of time needed for redistricting are the design of the public inquiry process and whether the legislature is permitted to debate or modify a redistricting plan. The elaborate public inquiry process utilised in the United Kingdom adds considerably to the time needed for redistribution. (See the case study of the United Kingdom, The United Kingdom Redistribution Process, for a description of the public inquiry process in that country.) In Canada, the major source of delay has traditionally been Parliament. A sixty-day restriction was eventually placed on Parliament for the review of proposed federal redistribution plans.\n\nGiven the political nature of redistricting in the United States, it is remarkable how quickly the process is completed. Legislatures in most states are responsible for drawing the lines and enacting the final congressional districting plan. Part of the reason for the timeliness in most states is the lack of any structured public input into the redistricting process. While some states did hold public hearings during redistricting in 1991, it is doubtful that these hearings led to significant modifications in any redistricting plans.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe major disadvantage of a lengthy redistricting process is the same as that associated with a lengthy time interval between redistributions, i.e., large population deviations may result. In England, for example, there were wide discrepancies in district populations following the 1983 redistribution because the Boundary Commission redrew constituencies with voter registration counts from 1976, the year the redistribution process began.\n\nPublic Access to the Delimitation Process\n\nOne distinction between countries with redistricting commissions and countries where legislatures or government agencies conduct redistricting is public access to the process. Many countries that have adopted neutral redistricting commissions have incorporated public access provisions as part of the reforms to limit the influence of legislators and political parties in the redistricting process.\n\nOne of the aims of Canada's Electoral Boundaries Redistribution Act of 1964 was to increase the public's awareness of and involvement in the redistribution process. The Act, modelled on Australia's redistribution process, borrowed Australia's practice of granting the public an opportunity to present suggestions or objections to commission proposals. In Canada today, once an independent electoral commission has completed its proposal and published the map in the local newspapers, the general public is invited to present written briefs or oral representations at public hearings held by the commission. Commissions have received thousands of comments from a wide variety of sources. Local jurisdictions, political parties, members of Parliament (MPs), candidates for Parliament, political activists and other interested citizens have all offered comments on proposed federal redistribution plans. Redistribution plans have often been revised after these hearings.\n\nAlthough Australia's redistribution process has been modified since Canada borrowed major portions of it, public involvement is still an important part of the process. In 1983, for example, the process was changed to give the public two opportunities to offer comments on proposed redistricting plans. Australia's four-member Redistribution Committee receives suggestions from the public, political parties, candidates, and MPs before beginning to draft a plan. Once the Redistribution Committee has completed a plan, the augmented Electoral Commission hears public objections to the proposed plan, if there are any, and produces a final map. The only avenue for legislators in Australia to comment on a federal redistribution plan is through the public hearing process. See the case study on Australia, Federal Redistribution in Australia, for more details on the public inquiry process in this country.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the process of public consultation is similar, although a public inquiry is held only if local authorities or at least one hundred electors object to the proposed map. Despite this caveat, the public consultation process takes much longer to complete in the United Kingdom than in other countries. One reason is that second inquiries may be held if a proposed plan is modified and new objections are raised. The public consultation process is described in detail in the case study of the United Kingdom, The United Kingdom Redistribution Process. In countries without standard procedures for public access, litigation may be the only avenue for the public to challenge a redistricting plan. In the United States, civil rights organisations, public interest groups, and interested citizens frequently file lawsuits if they deem a redistricting plan unfair. One consequence is that the number of redistricting lawsuits filed in the United States is enormous, far greater than in any other country. Increased public access to the redistricting process may or may not reduce the number of court challenges to redistricting plans in the United States since there are other reasons as well for the proliferation of lawsuits. But greater public access to the process would certainly make the process appear more open and democratic.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary advantage to granting public access to the redistricting process is that the outcome is more likely to be viewed as fair if the process is perceived as open and accessible. In countries with plurality or majority electoral systems, granting the public access to the process may be especially important because of the tendency of single-member districts to distort the relationship between the percentage of votes a political party receives and the number of seats the party wins.\n\nEstablishment of Criteria for Delimiting Districts\n\nCountries often institute a set of formal rules, or criteria, for their boundary authorities to consider when drawing electoral districts. Although this is especially true in countries that employ boundary commissions or election commissions to draw districts, many countries that allow the legislature or a government agency to redistrict have enacted criteria as well. These rules are usually listed in the electoral law, but they can sometimes be found in the country's constitution. Examples of redistricting rules enacted by selected countries can be found in Election laws or constitutional provisions listing redistricting criteria for selected countries.\n\nThe rules often specify that districts should be as equal in population as possible. Administrative and/or natural boundaries and other geographic features such as sparsely populated or isolated territory are factors also commonly listed. Respect for communities of interest is another factor many countries specify. In some countries, especially developing countries, those in charge of redistricting are asked to consider the means of transportation and/or communication as well.\n\nAlmost all countries that have formal redistricting criteria require that districts be as equal in population as possible. Many countries specify tolerance limits or allowable deviations from the population or electoral quota. The population or electoral quota is simply the population of the territory to be redistricted divided by the number of legislative seats (or districts) to be allocated to that territory.\n\nAlthough the representation of voters has taken precedence over the representation of communities in the twentieth century--as evidenced by the number of countries that require districts to be as equal in population as possible--respect for administrative areas, physically-defined natural communities and geographically concentrated communities of interest continue to play prominent roles in redistricting. In fact, a primary function of single-member districts is to provide representation for geographically defined communities.\n\nCriteria Relating to Election Outcomes\n\nEqual population, geographic considerations and communities of interest are criteria that relate directly to the process of creating districts. Other criteria relate to the outcome of the redistricting process--for example, requiring that district plans be drawn so that political parties are fairly represented or that racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities have an equitable chance of representation. But countries that delimit districts usually do not adopt criteria relating to the fairness of the outcome. This is because countries with single-member districts can rarely meet these standards, if fairness of outcome is defined as proportional or near proportional representation for political parties and minority groups.\n\nConclusion\n\nRedistricting criteria can conflict with one another. For instance, although almost all countries list population equality as a redistricting criterion, few countries actually have districts that are very close to equal in population. The reason is that other criteria have been deemed more important than strict adherence to population equality. Respect for administrative boundaries and natural communities, for example, often require districts to be smaller or larger than the electoral quota. Countries that establish redistricting criteria must either prioritise the criteria or accept certain inconsistencies in district configuration. Many countries choose to specify the most important criteria and/or place limits (such as tolerance limits) on the boundary authority, but still permit redistricters some discretion in balancing these criteria.\n\nEqual Population in Redistricting\n\nThe most widely accepted rule for redistricting is that districts should be relatively equal in population. This is because representation by population is a central tenet of democracy, and, in countries that employ single-member districts, this rule translates into the principle of equal populations across districts. Equally populous districts are necessary if voters are to have an equally weighted voice in the election of representatives. If, for example, a representative is elected from a district that has twice as many voters as another district, voters in the larger district will have half as much influence as voters in the smaller district.\n\nThe degree to which countries require population “equality” and the population figure (for example, total population, citizen population, registered voters) that is used to determine equality differs across countries. Approximately half of the countries that delimit districts use “total population” as the population base for determining equality across electoral districts. Another third of the countries employ registered voters as the population base. Several European countries use citizen population as the relevant base for determining population equality. Lesotho uses the voting age population as the base; Belarus uses the number of voters in the previous election.\n\nThe degree to which countries demand population equality also varies. Many countries have no established tolerance limit regarding the extent to which constituencies are permitted to deviate from the population quota. Among those that have established limits there is a range from “virtually no deviation allowed” (the United States) to as high as a 30 percent tolerance limit (Singapore).\n\nDeviations from Population Quotas\n\nMinimal\n\nThe United States is unique in its adherence to the doctrine of equal population. No other country requires deviations as minimal as the “one person, one vote” standard that has been imposed by U.S. courts since the early 1960s. In the 1983 court case Karcher v. Daggett, the U.S. Supreme Court held that there is no point at which population deviations in a congressional redistricting plan can be considered inconsequential: “there are no de minimus variations which could practically be avoided but which nonetheless meet the standard of Article I, Section 2 [of the U.S. Constitution] without justification.” The Court went on to reject a New Jersey congressional redistricting plan that had a total population deviation of only .7 percent. Following this decision, most states interpreted Karcher as requiring the adoption of congressional redistricting plans with exact mathematical population equality or, at minimum, with the lowest possible population deviation. Although the courts later upheld the legality of some redistricting plans that had less than the absolute de minimus population variation possible, none of the plans upheld contained total deviations of even one percent.\n\nMedium\n\nMacedonia, with a Regional List PR electoral system and six electoral districts, comes closest to this strict standard, with allowable deviations of no more than plus or minus three percent from the population quota. New Zealand, Albania, and Yemen allow deviations of up to five percent from the population quota. Australia, Belarus, Italy, and the Ukraine specify 10 percent as the maximum allowable deviation.\n\nThe population requirement in Australia, however, is actually more complicated than a 10 percent tolerance limit: Australian election law also requires that electoral districts deviate by no more than 3.5 percent, three years and six months after the expected completion of the redistribution. This criterion was devised to produce equality of population halfway through the seven-year Australian districting cycle and to avoid wide discrepancies at the end of the delimitation cycle. To meet this requirement, the Australian delimitation commission (referred to as the Redistribution Commission) must use population projections as well as current population data. Australia's close attention to population equality is relatively recent. Thirty years ago, the practice of heavy rural loading--creating rural districts that were much smaller in population than urban districts--was quite common. (For more information on Australian redistricting practices, see the case study on Australia, Federal Redistribution in Australia.)\n\nLarge\n\nArmenia, Germany, and the Czech Republic allow population deviations of no more than 15 percent. (In Germany, proposed electoral districts cannot deviate by more than 15 percent, and districts that deviate by more than 25 percent must be redrawn.) Zimbabwe and Papua New Guinea have set the maximum allowable deviation at 20 percent. In Canada, the independent commissions charged with creating federal electoral districts are allowed to deviate by up to 25 percent from the provincial quotas. But since 1986, commissions have been permitted to exceed the 25 percent limit under \"extraordinary circumstances.\" This provision was used to create five of the 295 seats in the Canadian House of Commons in 1987, two of 301 seats in 1996 and two of 308 seats in 2003. In 2003, one Ontario district was 43.7 percent below the provincial average and one Newfoundland district was created with a population 61.9 percent below the provincial average (For more information on Canadian redistribution, see the case study on Canada, Representation in the Canadian Parliament.) The United Kingdom allows even larger deviations in district populations. The original standard was set at 25 percent in 1944. But the standard was repealed only two years later. The current rule however requires that constituencies be \"within plus or minus five percent of the United Kingdom quota\", but this rule must be balanced against other factors such as local boundaries and special geographical considerations. Allowances for natural communities prompted English boundary commissioners in 1983 to leave the Isle of Wight with 95,000 electors as a single constituency, while respect for local London boundaries left suburban Surbiton with only 48,000 electors. The last redistribution saw the Isle of Wight apportioned an additional district, the two districts having 56,000 and 55,000 electors respectively. Likewise, recognising the difficulties of island travel, the commissioners in Scotland granted the Western Isles (2011 population 22,000) and Orkney and Shetland (2011 population 34,000) their own representatives.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe degree to which a country adheres to s"
