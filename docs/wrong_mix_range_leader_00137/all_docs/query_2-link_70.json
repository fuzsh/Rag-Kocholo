        "text": "While Fiji has taken important steps in recent years by holding two consecutive democratic elections in 2014 and 2018, the government led by Commodore Frank Banimarama’s Fiji First Party (national unity party) continues to be plagued by human rights concerns, including restrictions on the freedoms of speech, association, and assembly. (Freedom House, 2020)\n\nPress freedoms and limitations on the media are also pressing issues. For instance, government prosecutors continue to pursue sedition charges against an opinion writer and editors at the Fiji Times newspaper for publishing a letter deemed to be hostile towards the country’s Muslim community. (U.S. Department of State, 2020; Prakash, 2021) The government’s case, which is pending at the Court of Appeals after the Fiji Times staff were previously acquitted, has drawn widespread criticism for its implications on the freedom of speech and press freedoms. (Amnesty International, 2017; Cava, 2018; Prakash, 2021)\n\nIn addition, concerns over allegations of torture and abuse by security forces, gender-based violence, and the violation of worker’s rights persist. (Freedom House, 2020)\n\nThe Indian-Hindu minority faces ongoing racial prejudice and inequitable treatment in many sectors, while longstanding ethnic tensions between the iTaukei (indigenous Fijian) population and Indo-Fijians continue to linger. Indo-Fijian women also remain underrepresented in political parties. (Freedom House, 2020) The government, however, has taken several significant steps to confront discrimination and reduce ethnic tensions in recent years. Ethnic and religiously motivated violence targeting the Indian-Hindu minority has also drastically declined.\n\nEthnic tensions flared up towards the end of 2020 after an investigation began into the alleged role of Indo-Fijian Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum in a 1987 bomb attack by an Indo-Fijian pro-democracy group. The attacks followed a military coup that removed a democratically elected government led by an Indo-Fijian majority. (Anthony & Doherty, 2020)\n\nFiji is home to a diverse multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The population is split primarily between two main ethnic groups: iTaukei (indigenous Fijians), who constitute 56.8%, and Indo-Fijians, who make up an estimated 37.5% of the population. Religious identity is closely correlated with ethnicity, as most Indo-Fijians are Hindu (27.9% of the total population and 76% of the Indian community), while indigenous Fijians are primarily Christian (all Christian denominations collectively comprise 64.5% of the total population). (U.S. Department of State, 2020)\n\nIndo-Fijian Hindus were initially brought to Fiji from India in 1879 by the British colonists as part of the indentured labor system to work on sugarcane plantations. This brutal practice, akin to slavery, was finally abolished in 1916, but discrimination against Hindus continued, abetted by the state. (BBC, 2013)\n\nDuring colonial rule, the British pursued a policy of separate communal developments to prevent Indian laborers and indigenous Fijians from becoming a unified community, thereby posing a threat to colonial rule. When the British departed, political power and the vast majority of land (87% of land) was left in the hands of indigenous Fijians, who dominated politics at the expense of the Indo-Fijian community, which comprised 40% of the population at that time. (BBC, 2013)\n\nSince Fiji’s independence in 1970, the country has experienced three coups. The first military coup in May 1987 by Lt. Colonel Rabuka removed Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra and a government supported by Indo-Fijians. The coup was justified by assertions that the government was dominated by Indo-Fijians, although it was the first time that the community held political power in 17 years. (BBC, 2013)\n\nIn the months following the coup, racial tensions escalated and indegenous Fijians attacked Indians in widespread violence. In one bout of violence in May 1987, nearly 200 Indians were injured by a rampaging mob of thousands of coup supporters. (Kristof, 1987) According to one New York Times report, “An older Indian man was knocked to the ground, and he curled up in a ball as a succession of Fijians kicked him as they ran past. A boy was hurled to the street and kicked in the head several times until blood ran down his face.” (Kristof, 1987)\n\nLt. Colonel Rabuka then orchestrated a second coup in September of the same year after negotiations with the Governor-General (the Governor-General represented the British monarchy’s interests in Fiji until 1987 when Fiji became a republic), failed to reach a settlement.\n\nAfter this second coup, approximately 30,000 – 40,000 Indo-Fijians fled the country. (Nanda, 1992) The new government also implemented overtly Methodist Christian policies, including forced closures of all businesses on Sunday. (Nanda, 1992)\n\nRabuka promulgated a new constitution in 1990, which effectively ensured political dominance for the ethnic iTaukei Fijians and explicitly discriminated against Indian Hindus by creating a race-based political system in which the majority of seats in both the House and Senate were allocated to iTaukei Fijians. (Nanda, 1992) The institutional discrimination enshrined in the constitution further fueled an atmosphere where the rights of Indian Hindus were violated with impunity and they were subjected to violence. In October 1991, there were a series of arsons and attacks on Hindu shrines, temples, and a priest. (Nanda, 1992)\n\nInternational pressure and domestic unrest resulted in amendments to the constitution in 1997, making it more equitable and removing discriminatory provisions. (BBC, 2013)\n\nElections in 1999 saw the emergence of the first Indian Hindu Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhary, who was overthrown and held hostage a year later by a Fijian extremist and U.S.-educated businessman, George Speight. (BBC, 2013) Subsequently, violence against Indian Hindus increased and threatened their fundamental right to practice their faith.\n\nHistorically, discrimination has been a significant cause (among others) leading to the mass migration of ethnic Indians out of the country. According to a recent report, approximately 81,000 Indo-Fijians left the country between 1987 and 2004, out of a total of 91,000 emigres during that same period. (Kaitani et al., 2011) This has resulted in a major demographic shift, with a drastic decline in the Indo-Fijian population from approximately 50% prior in 1987 (Wyeth, 2017) to only 37% today. (Fiji Bureau of Statistics, 2007)\n\nThe third coup occurred in 2006, when the democratically elected Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was deposed by the military led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who justified the coup in part as an attempt to alleviate ethnic tensions between the indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians and curb state sponsored racism against Indians and Hindus. (Perry, 2013) Bainimarama’s military regime did in fact end ethnically based preferential policies and took considerable steps to improve the conditions of the Indian-Hindu population and reduce reliance on ethnic based politics. Societal violence and discrimination against the Indian-Hindu community has drastically declined, though there have still been reports of recent incidents targeteting Hindu temples and schools.\n\nBainimarama has continued to stay in power since his 2006 military coup and eventually won democratic elections in 2014 under the banner of the Fiji First political party. He was reelected in national elections in 2018. (Freedom House, 2020)\n\nThe Fijian government has generally supported the free practice of religion in accordance with the Constitution adopted in 2013, which “guarantees religious freedom and establishes a secular state, in which all religions are equal.’” (Pratibha, 2014)\n\nThe Constitutional framework further protects religious freedom through provisions that ensure that “the State and all persons holding public office must treat all religions [e]qually” and that “the State and all persons holding public office must not prefer or advance, by any means, any particular religion, religious denomination, religious belief, or religious practice over another, or over any non-religious belief.” (Office of the Attorney General, n.d.)\n\nIn addition, Section 22 provides that every individual “has the right to freedom of religion, conscience and belief” and has the right to freely manifest or practice his religion in public or private. (Office of the Attorney General, n.d.)\n\nDespite these protections for religious freedom, some government and police officials routinely used their positions of power to promote their Christian beliefs. Bainimarama’s government, however, has officially issued directives in recent years to end this practice and have emphasized religious tolerance. (U.S. Department of State, 2020) Additionally, the government observes the religious holidays of the three main religions in Fiji as national holidays, including the Hindu festival of Diwali, several Christian holidays, and the birth of the Prophet Mohammed. (The Fijian Government, 2021)\n\nFijian citizens generally enjoy freedom of religion, but there have been a number of incidents targeting Hindu temples in recent years, (Freedom House, 2020) including the following:\n\nSeptember 2019 — A man broke into a temple in Suva and stole several religious items. (U.S. Department of State, 2020)\n\nAugust 2019 — The temple door and windows at the Kaliamman Temple of Vomo St, Lautoka were broken by vandals. (Chaudhary, 2019)\n\nJuly 2019 — At least two temples – the Sita Ram Mandir of Calia, Navua and the Hindu Temple at Malolo, Nadi were broken into and donation collections were stolen. (Gopal, 2019; Chaudhary, 2019)\n\nJanuary 2018 — At least one temple near Suva was vandalized, while others in Suva were reportedly also broken into in previous months. (Radio New Zealand, 2018)\n\nDecember 2017 — The Tirath Dham temple in Nadi was vandalized with racially motivated graffiti, donation boxes were stolen, and murtis (statues of deities) were desecrated with paint poured on them. (Radio New Zealand, 2018)\n\nJune 2016 — The Lovu Sangam School on the outskirts of Lautoka and an adjacent Hindu temple were vandalized multiple times, and Hindu symbols and sacred items desecrated. The vandals also wrote messages taunting the school that serves 500 Indian students. (Citizens’ Constitutional Forum, 2016)\n\nAlthough the government has taken steps to stem religious intolerance and promote equality, some private religious institutions have pushed to erase the line separating politics and religion. Fiji’s Methodist Church openly advocated for Fiji to officially become a Christian state, claiming that “Fiji was given to God…When we say that Fiji is a Christian state we say it was decided by our chiefs who ceded Fiji to Great Britain that Fiji be a Christian country…When it was given to God, it has already established its covenant relationship with God, and that covenant relationship is eternal – it cannot be withdrawn.” (Australia Network News, 2012) The majority of Fiji’s Christian population is Methodist and the Church wields considerable influence and power in the island nation.\n\nOn the other hand, some religious institutions have worked to promote inter-religious harmony, including a number Catholic parishes, which recently “commemorated Diwali at a special Mass they stated was to show respect to Hindus.” (U.S. Department of State, 2020)\n\nFinally, Indo-Fijians continue to be marginalized by inequitable land ownership regulations. The majority of land in Fiji is still concentrated in the hands of iTaukei Fijians with restrictions on the ability of Indo-Fijians farmers to purchase land under discriminatory land tenure legislation. While a recent land use decree has increased access to land and extended lease periods to up to 99 years (from 30 years), Indo-Fijian farmers are still dependent on leased lands.
