        "text": "Dawie de Villiers (born July 10, 1940, Burgersdorp, S.Af.—died April 23, 2022, Stellenbosch, S. Af.) was a South African rugby union player who was one of the sport’s greatest scrum halves and captain of the South African national team, the Springboks, from 1965 to 1970. After his playing days ended, he went on to a highly successful political career.\n\nDe Villiers made his debut as captain and scrum half for the Springboks on their tour of New Zealand in 1965 after playing for Danie Craven at the University of Stellenbosch. He played 25 Test (international) matches for South Africa, 22 as captain. He gained fame in 1970 for motivating his teammates to an unlikely 17–6 victory over the favoured All Blacks, New Zealand’s national team, by looking each in the eye, pointing to his jersey, and saying, “Suid Afrika.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSports Quiz"
