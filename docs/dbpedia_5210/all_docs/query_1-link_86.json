Over the following weeks, I am going to explore this wheel. If at any time you have questions, or need clarification, please feel free to message me. Let's start with Asking for Help. Contrary to popular belief, asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness, nor a sign of you're not good enough, nor that you are unable to do the task. Asking for help simply means that the person from whom you are seeking assistance adds value to your life. When you ask for help, you are, in fact, empowering the other person. You are letting them know that you value their knowledge, their actions, their time, and them as a person in your life. This can be asking your kids to help you clean up the house. This can be asking a coworker to run a work related errand for you, or their opinion on a project. This can be asking your spouse to grab groceries on the way home. This can be asking your doctor for a referral. The list is endless. Who can you ask to help you today? #SelfCareSunday #itsokaytoaskforhelp #lifecoacheshelp #breatheinbreatheout #seeingthingsdifferently\n\nDeep thoughts üí≠ Why do strangers often show more support than the people we grew up with? It's truly mind-boggling. I've been involved in training, coaching, and hosting open runs, and people would attend on their own time. But now, suddenly, everyone wants to join in. It's astonishing how things can change. Since a few friends came around and understood my vision, the people I used to invite to work out or play basketball now want to attend. It's just a little bit crazy, I can't deny it. As I grow older, it becomes increasingly difficult to see the good in people. I've even had some individuals say that they'll be at my wedding, not because of me, but because of who they think will be there. From all of this, I've learned the importance of staying consistent, supporting others for who they are rather than who they know, treating everyone with respect, and staying focused on my vision. Before the year ends, there are a few things I want to accomplish: 1. Visit the children's hospital and give them some toys. 2. Feed the homeless. 3. Send clothes to the Philippines and Africa. 4. Organize two more free camps for kids. Just keep following God's lead.\n\nAsking for help is human! Embracing the act of seeking assistance is not a sign of weakness; rather, it is an acknowledgment of our shared humanity. Many individuals perceive asking for help as burdensome, associating it with feelings of inadequacy or incapability. However, the reality is that reaching out for assistance is a fundamental aspect of being human‚Äîit doesn't label you as a failure or a burden but highlights your innate imperfection. Regardless of the depth of your knowledge or the extent of your possessions, there will always be gaps in understanding and elements beyond your control. Reflect on this: when you seek help, you join a long line of individuals who have done the same before you, and countless others will follow. So why the hesitation?

The answer is: more than you think and it‚Äôs not healthy for you. This answer is true for people across the spectrum of society. Even highly educated people in my audiences, with many degrees and high incomes, have not taken time out to get their ducks in a row, to prepare for what I call a ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô moment, for something unexpected to happen in their lives. They tell me that they worry about it but can‚Äôt bring themselves to sort things out because they know everything is in a mess. Many do not even have a will. Now, it‚Äôs National Wills month (in South Africa), the perfect time to get things together. Love yourself and each other enough to get your affairs in order. You will need a good two days to do so. Follow my What If File‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Checklist and, once you have done the legwork, you need a few minutes to update your What If File‚Ñ¢Ô∏è once a year, or if anything changes. Have you made the necessary provision for peace of mind should the unexpected happen? It has happened to me and I have walked this journey. #WhatIfMoments #LifePlanning #WillsAndTrusts\n\n\"The desire to help must be matched with the wisdom to discern when it's truly needed.\" - Jonathan Huie. Attempting to help with good intentions can sometimes lead to hindrance due to factors such as: Assuming what the person needs without properly understanding their situation can result in inappropriate assistance. Offering help in areas where individual lack expertise or where it isn't welcomed can lead to confusion and inefficiency. ~ Unintended consequences of someone's help might outweigh the benefits, causing more harm overall. ‚Ä¢ If the person didn't ask for help or explicitly declined it, someone's efforts might be seen as intrusive or hindering."
