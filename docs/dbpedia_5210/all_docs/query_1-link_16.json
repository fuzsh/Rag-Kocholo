        "text": "Senator De Klerk's interest in education is evident right from his initial university training as a teacher. This interest extends to all levels of organised education and training. His long experience as a teacher stood him in good stead for his duties as Minister of Education, Arts and Science and subsequently as Minister of National Education.\n\nHis achievements as Minister of National Education are evidence not only of his interest and experience in education, but also of his insight into and sympathy for the theoretical and fundamental problems of organised education.\n\nIn his capacity as Minister of National Education, Senator De Klerk distinguished himself in initiating and carrying through endeavours to remove bottlenecks in the educational system in this country, thereby furthering the cause of more effective education and at the same time promoting its consolidation and co-ordination.\n\nThe following may be cited in this connection:\n\nThe National Education Policy Act of 1967 which:\n\nbrought about greater uniformity as regards educational practice and its co-ordination and control;\n\ncreated the framework of principles within which organised education and training should take place;\n\nlaid down the principle that education should have a Christian character in a way permitting the religious convictions of parents and pupils to be respected;\n\nsupported the principle that education should have a broad national character; and provided for the national co-ordination of syllabuses, courses,\n\nIn general, it may be stated that the Minister, with great vision, has through legislation assured the preparedness of the nation.\n\nHe drew up and submitted legislation in terms of which teacher training in the Republic was altered radically, the main objective being to raise academic standards in the training of teachers. This assured proper recognition of the part to be played by the university in the scientific schooling of prospective teachers.\n\nThrough his direct intervention, his persuasive powers and his deep conviction that all facets of education in this country should be promoted and stimulated, he played an important role in the revision of accepted policy. This gave rise, in February 1963, to the announcement of the establishment of a university in Port Elizabeth, followed by the promulgation of the University of Port Elizabeth Act, Act No. I of 1964, and in 1966 the establishment of the Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg. With the founding of these two universities, Senator De Klerk made an exceptional contribution to the opening up of tertiary education possibilities and thus to the further development of academic endeavours in South Africa.\n\nThe decisions taken by Senator De Klerk and the improvements which he visualised for the future of education in the Republic as a whole were not always received with widespread enthusiasm. He, however, had the courage of his convictions and is today acclaimed in all quarters for what he has achieved.\n\nThe University of Port Elizabeth wishes to honour Senator De Klerk for his tremendous contribution to the extension and development of education at all levels in South Africa by conferring upon him the degree DOCTOR EDUCATIONIS, HONORIS CAUSA."
