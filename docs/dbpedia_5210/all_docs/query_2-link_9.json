        "text": "On 26 – 27 August 2022, we hosted our second MOT Coaches’ Basic Education for the year, but the first to the Burgersdorp Community, Eastern Cape, as part of our partnership with Scatec and it was a huge success!\n\nA total of 27 MOT Coaches who are educators, community workers and volunteers were trained, representing 4 different schools and community organisations.\n\nOur new MOT coaches are eager to show the youth what it means to live with courage and realize that they have the right to dream and the power to make those dreams come true. Using the MOT philosophy and core values, our MOT Coaches are equipped with the tools to develop and strengthen the next generation to be self-aware, active citizens and leaders.\n\nAbout Scatec partnership\n\nMOT SA has been appointed by Scatec Solar to implement a Youth Leadership Programme within 2021, wherein we completed the 6-month MOT Programmes for 30 youth, which forms part of their companies’ strategic development goals.\n\nOne of the MOT Youth and now a trained MOT Coach, Sanelisiwe Sikweyiya, saw the positive impact the MOT Programmes were bringing to the youth, and further motivated for the MOT Programmes to be implemented within the schools and community organisation, hence the MOT Coaches Basic Education.\n\nSanelisiwe Sikweyiya’s proposal included: “Like in many communities in our country, unemployment has become a huge problem; this has crippled and demotivated our youth immensely. As a result, our youth has resorted to a life of crime, drugs, alcohol and prostitution. We also have a huge challenge of teen pregnancy and dropouts. When I enrolled in the MOT Programme, I saw an opportunity to motivate and empower our youth and also to bring a sense of meaning back into their lives. The youth people in our community feel like they do not belong anywhere and I feel this programme can change that.”\n\nHow are the MOT Programmes done?\n\nThe MOT Programmes make use of activities, reflections, stories, and group discussions, to create a magical atmosphere and inspirational experiences that contribute to strengthening youth’s ownership of the MOT values courage to live, courage to care, and courage to say no – which in turn strengthens their ability to build themselves and others.\n\nThank you to the friendly staff at Merino Inn at Colesberg for the hospitality and assistance when it was needed, Yoli’s Catering services for the delicious food supplied throughout the 2 days and a special thank you to Scatec for making this possible!\n\nWe are so proud of our robust and Passionate, Youthful, Innovative and Sincere (P-YIS) MOT Coaches!\n\nClick here to view what we got up to via the Facebook Album here\n\nCheck out this month’s MOT Coach Blogger of the Month, Mr Terence Klassen, Principal of Fairmount Secondary School, MOT Coach and this year’s Are Hovstad Award Winner is this month’s MOT Blogger of the Month. Here he shares his story about how MOT started and the effect of the MOT Programme on the staff, youth and community at and around the school. Click here to be inspired."
