I now call upon the hon Chief of the Majority Party.\n\nDEBATE ON THE PRESIDENT’S STATE-OF-THE-NATION ADDRESS\n\nUMBHEXESHI OYINTLOKO WEQELA ELILAWULAYO: Somlomo\n\nohloniphekileyo, uSihlalo weBhunga leSizwe laMaphondo, Umongameli weli lizwe, uSekela Mongameli, amalungu ale Ndlu ahloniphekileyo onke noluntu lonke loMzantsi Afrika ...\n\nXitsonga:\n\n... ndza mi xeweta, avuxeni.\n\nIsiXhosa: Molweni.\n\nSesotho: Dumelang.\n\nIsiZulu: Sanibonani.\n\nEnglish:\n\nGood morning.\n\nAfrikaans: Goeie more.\n\nNdivumele Somlomo ukuba ndiwagawule ndiwarhuqa xa ndisenza ingabula-zigcawu kule ntetho ibuluncuthu mazangwa kaMongameli woMzantsi Afrika. Ewe ke kuba sikunyaka wolonyulo, kubalulekile ukuba siyiqaphele into yokuba kuza kukhonya noomofu namhlanje kule nkundla. Elowo nalowo umofu uza kuthi ndikho. Izinto lo rhulumente azenzileyo azizukwaziwa. Abantu baza kumfameka nangakumbi ngokungathi abazange banawo amahlo ngaphambili okubona izinto ezenziweyo. Ingakumbi xa kusuyiwa kulonyulo, abanye babo baya kulonyulo beyingqokelela yabaphikisi babagxeki, bebethe inkazathi yento ebizwa ngokuba yi ...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... Moonshot ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... kuba kaloku kufuneka bekhuphe lo rhulumente weANC esihlalweni. Ayindisithelanga ke malungu eNdlu ahloniphekileyo into yokuba, njengomshumayeli phaya kwinkonzo yamaWesile, iintlungu zakaloku nje azinakufanekiswa nobuqaqawuli obuzakutyhilwa. Ewe iintlungu zikacimi-cimi ziyavakala. Ewe iintlungu zentswela-misebenzi siyavakala. Kodwa sithi\n\niintlungu zakaloku nje ingakumbi emva kokuba uMongameli aye wasibeka isicwangciso wasithi theca ebonisa ukuba siyakwazi esikwenzileyo kwaye siyakwazi esingakwenzanga ngokwaneleyo. Nazi izicwangciso zokuthatha uMzantsi Afrika siwuse kwiqondo elingasentla. Uthe xa equkumbela uMongameli, siza kuyiguqula njani na imeko yabantu bakowethu ngeli xesha?\n\nEnglish:\n\nWe as the ANC and the nation are inspired by the President’s address last Thursday. The President has detailed the undertaking from 2023’s state of the nation address, Sona.The progress is inspiring. I repeat, the progress is inspiring alongside his many challenges that we have outlined.\n\nNotwithstanding two years of COVID-19, this government has done all what it could do.\n\nThe President gave an honest, balanced reflection of where we stand as a nation. The choice we face as the nation in this year’s election is to reaffirm what we said we’re going to do in 1994, the implementation of a national programme of transformation that will result to qualitatively changing the lives of the majority of our people who are black in general and women in particular because they are in the majority, for\n\nthe better and not to side with those who benefitted from the historical legacy of the privilege, who seek to block the transformation at every turn, as they cling to preserve their wealth, their properties, as well as positions at the expense of the majority.\n\nUnder the ANC, we will continue to take the country forward with all its challenges towards a better future for all. Under a conglomeration of opposition parties, they will entrench wealth amongst the few. Under them, poverty and inequality will grow. The Moonshot Pact ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... yimbutho yabagxeki abadibene ngokuzama uMzantsi Afrika wocalulo ukuze basithathe basibuyisele emva.\n\nEnglish:\n\nDuring the Sona ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... niyangxola nina.\n\nEnglish:\n\nDuring the Sona, the President accounted to the nation.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nHlengwa ayifani nawe loo nto.\n\nThe SPEAKER: Order man! Hon Hlengwa please man. Hon members, please don’t drown the speaker.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: On Thursday evening, the President accounted to the nation on the implementation not only on Sona 2023 commitments, but also on the five-year plan, the Medium-Term Strategic Framework. To those who say nothing has been done, let me remind you because you have political dementia.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nMandinikhumbuze ke ...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... R14 billion, listen, had been allocated to fight crime and corruption over the next three years. Four thousand arrests have been made for all those who have damaged critical infrastructure. Seventy arrests for construction extortion and\n\nover 3 000 arrests for illegal mining. Over 1,7 million work and livelihood opportunities for unemployed South Africans have been created through the Presidential Employment Stimulus.\n\nForty-five thousand participants have been placed in the National Youth Service and 51 000 participants have been employed by 28 implementing partners under the Social Employment Fund.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nNgubani ke ofuna ukuma apha aze kuteketa athi akwenziwanga nto? Kukho abakhalayo, kukho abalilayo, kukho abajwedayo.\n\nSesotho:\n\nHo na le ba llang. Ho na le ba bokollang. Batla ema mona. Ba tla bokolla!\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... bejweda besithi akukhange kwenziwe nto. [Kwaqhwatywa.]\n\nEnglish:\n\nThe mergers outlined in Sona clearly says to the economy, how do we grow the economy, how do we create jobs, reducing poverty and tackling corruption. We are bound as public representatives of the people to ensure that the programme we adopt in our organization are for the people, of the people, with the people, because we work with people and speak to their needs.\n\nThe ANC’s January 8 Statement is very clear that, we are more determined this year to succeed in building a better life for all and become very resolute about bringing together broad democratic forces in the country.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nIngxelo nkcukacha-manani (Census 2022) iyavuma ukuba igxathu elikhulu urhulumente ulenzile. Kodwa njengoko elenzile imiceli-mingeni mininzi iyakhula kuba noluntu luyakhula.\n\nIziphumo zona ziyasivuma ukuba eneneni impilo nobomi babantu bakuthi zohlukile ukusukela mhla sathatha ulawulo. Ewe zikhona izinto kunye namachaphaza asigqwalisayo njengokwehla komgagatho wenkonzo eziya ebantwini bakowethu, ulawulo oluhesheheshe kwezinye izigaba zorhulumento. Ezo zinto\n\nsiyazazi kwaye uhulumente onyanisekileyo uyathetha ngemiceli- mingeni ajongene nayo.\n\nEnglish:\n\nTherefore, we do not have to be held hostage in this debate by political parties that will come with soundbites but lack evidence. Census 22 is clear evidence.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nUkwenyuka kwamaxabiso kanobomi kukhwitsha iinpula zikalujaca ekubeni uqoqosho lungenyuki kodwa siyabona ukuba amaxabiso nempilo yoluntu ziyenyuka. Loo nto iyalonzakalisa uluntu.\n\nUrhulumente uyazivele zonke ezo nkalo. Esi sihelegu sikacimi- cimi wombane yeyona nto iqhokra uqoqosho noluntu lwelizwe lakowethu. Ngoko ke sithi, urhulumente makayiqonde into yokuba noko lo mvambo awunyamezeleki njengoko sithe sabona ngoMgqibelo sisiya kwisigaba sesithatndathu. Sinethemba ke lokuba xa esima apha uMphathiswa ojongene nalo mba uza kuwucacisa ncakasana. Noxa kunjalo, ithemba lona likhona lokuba ezi zinto ziyalandelelwa.\n\nEnglish:\n\nWhat we need to honestly acknowledge is that, corruption has had a devastating impact on the ability of our state-owned enterprises to function for the purposes that they were meant for. We have just had another manager arrested at Eskom on the allegation of R1 million. We know that whenever they get arrested, we get blamed. Who must be blamed to when criminals are arrested, and are arrested through the ANC government? We also want to request our communities that when they see those are destroying our infrastructure, they must alert police and those people must be paid to book.\n\nAs the Parliament of the people will take their responsibility into attributing to the health of the state of the nation. The Judicial Commission of Inquiry, known as Zondo Commission and the report of the President which were referred to Parliament for consideration, have been acted upon. The constant narrative that Parliament has done nothing can only be said by those who have consciously gone to sleep, who do not want to see the process of assigned sections of the report given to the committees, and how the Ethics Committee has engaged itself and pronounced on some of the findings. The work will continue within the purview of Parliament.\n\nAs the majority party of the ANC, we lead in this responsibility and this responsibility of passing the legislation is about the transformation of this country. To date it has passed 88 Bills. All expression of the ANC policy that shapes the direction of the country and influence decision-making.\n\nWe have done this once we had to mourn 23 ANC Members of Parliament who passed on with the greatest number compared to any term of Parliament. They died with their boots and heels on. May their souls rest in peace.\n\nXitsonga:\n\n... onge mimoya ya vona yi nga etlela hi ku rhula ...\n\nSesotho:\n\nBa robale ka kgotso.\n\nEnglish:\n\nWhile the ANC is seeking to unite the nation, addressing the national grievances, promoting unity and diversity and driving social cohesion, we are confronted with acts of racism carried out by groups of whites who cling to an old apartheid flag\n\nthat is outlawed, swear allegiance to a past that was discriminating and declared as a crime against humanity. That cannot be allowed in our democracy.\n\nThey desire to undermine constitutional democracy and break down ongoing efforts of nation-building and social cohesion. These acts of racism only serve to reopen the wounds of the past and bring about a response. We have been talking about this for almost 30 years.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nUmenziwa akalibali kodwa umenzi uyalibala.\n\nEnglish:\n\nThank you very much hon Speaker [Applause.]\n\nThe LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, fellow South Africans. Mr President, thank you very much for sharing with us the story of Tintswalo, the child of democracy. There is no doubt that the South Africa that she grew up in after 1994 was a hopeful place. It was a built on the South African dream, the promise that her life would be better than the life of her parents and that her children’s lives would be better still.\n\nWhat the President did during his address was to tell us the story of Tintswalo’s start in life during the 1990s and the 2000s. It was far from perfect, but it was a time of hope and possibility.\n\nBut Tintswalo’s life story does not end after childhood. Today, she is a 30-year-old woman. She has entered the next phase of her life as a wife, a mother and a provider.\n\nOver the past decade she has watched in growing horror as the dream of her childhood has been betrayed.\n\nTintswalo’s social consciousness started to develop during high school as she watched the ANC elevate a man accused of corruption and rape to the highest office in the land.\n\nShe grew steadily more disillusioned when she found out that R246 million of public money was used to build a fire pool and chicken coup at the President’s home at Nkandla, even as many people around her fell deeper and deeper into poverty. And she watched as the ANC members of this House protected him.\n\nIn 2015, she graduated from a Technical Vocational Education and Training, Tvet, college. A year later Tintswalo realised that she was not alone in her growing unease about the future.\n\nIn 2016 she watched as voters abandon the ANC in major cities, and she too, started to think about changing her vote at the next election. [Interjections.]\n\nYou see, she just couldn’t stomach ... she just couldn’t stomach the idea of voting for the ANC after it unleashed Jacob Zuma, state capture and loadshedding on her country. [Applause.]\n\nBut in 2018 her spirits lifted. Tintswalo was delighted when the ANC ejected Zuma from the Presidency in February of that year.\n\nIn fact, Mr President, in 2019 Tintswalo voted for you. Like many others across the country, she did so for one reason, because she believed that you, Mr President, would restore South Africa to the path it was on when she was a child. That you would rescue the South African dream. But tragically, her hopes were shattered soon after.\n\nIn the same year that Mr Ramaphosa was elected, Tintswalo lost the first and only job she had, because the loadshedding crisis that he had promised to end shut down the factory where she worked. [Applause.]\n\nShe was forced to move into a tin shack on the outskirts of the city, returning to the same life of poverty she thought she had left behind for good. And she has been unemployed ever since.\n\nIn 2021 Tintswalo joined the growing group of South Africans who simply refused to vote. She was simply too angry after the Ramaphosa Administration broke all of the lofty promises it had made in the New Dawn, including by protecting the President’s comrades implicated in state capture. And sadly, things went from bad to much, much worse.\n\nIn 2022 her father became one of the 75 people who are murdered every single day in South Africa. He was killed by a loan shark, from whom he was forced to borrow money because the Transnet failure had shut down the transport job he had had since Tintswalo was a baby.\n\nFor Tintswalo it felt like her whole world had come crashing down. She lost her livelihood, she lost her home and her father. Her South African dream lay in ruins.\n\nYet, amid the darkest hour of her life, light entered when she gave birth to a daughter of her own. Called Esona, she was Tintswalo’s greatest gift. This miracle of new life gave her a newfound determination to fight to rescue her South African dream.\n\nYou see, Tintswalo is done waiting for the ANC to change. [Applause.] She has accepted that it never ever will. She acknowledges the opportunity she got as a young person, which her parents never had, but she now thinks about the future of her own family above all else.\n\nYou see, Mr President, like millions of other South Africans, Tintswalo cannot afford to live in the past. She must survive in the reality of what South Africa is in 2024, not what it was in 1994. [Applause.]\n\nWhen she is reminded of her hopeful childhood, it fills her with sadness for the childhood that waits Esona. When she\n\nremembers how her family moved from a shack into a formal house with running water and electricity, when she was a young girl, it hurts and shames her that she has ended up back in a shack with no water and constant power cuts as a grown woman.\n\nThe memory of how excited she was at her graduation is completely turned to anger when she realises that she has been unemployed for twice as long as it took her to complete her qualification.\n\nFor the hard truth, Mr President, is that when Tintswalo listened to the President on Thursday it did not make her grateful, as he may have hoped, it made her sad and it made her angry. Because whether you like it or not, Mr President, you have betrayed Tintswalo’s South African dream. [Applause.]\n\nHearing the President speak without acknowledging that the same people who once gave her the permission to dream are the same people who have now shattered those dreams. And this is only made Tintswalo more resolute than ever, that the time for change has come. [Applause.]\n\nShe knows that the only reason she had a better start in life than her parents did, was because her parents stood up and fought for change when it was required. The South African dream she tasted as a child did not come about by accident.\n\nBecause dreams only come true when we fight to make them true. [Applause.]\n\nTintswalo now knows that it is her turn to fight for change by removing the ANC from power. [Interjections.] [Applause.] To rescue baby Esona from the nightmare that the ANC is condemning her to grow up in.\n\nAnd, it’s not only Tintswalo. In Eldorado Park, Aunty Fatima is ready to fight to rescue her South African dream so that children may be free from gangsters and drug lords.\n\nIn Citrusdal, farmer Johan is ready to fight to rescue his South African dream so that he can spare his children from the indignity of watching the fruits of their labour rot at the dockside of a failing port. [Applause.]\n\nIn London, Sipho the engineer is ready to fight to rescue his South African dream so that his children can grow up in a\n\ncountry he had to leave in order to find opportunity, but which he still loves deeply. [Interjections.]\n\nWatching the President stand at this podium and sing the praises of a country that no longer exists made all South Africans even more resolute than ever before, that this is the year we must remove the ANC from power. [Applause.]\n\nWhen the ANC says that 2024 is the year that we must defend our freedom, they are right. We must defend our freedom; we must defend it from the ANC. [Applause.] Because the people of South Africa know that in 2024 the single greatest threat to our freedom and to the South African dream is the ANC. [Applause.]\n\nA labour market where seven out of ten young people cannot find work, is an existential threat to our freedom.\n\nLoadshedding and water shedding are existential threats to our freedom. Rampant crime is an existential threat to our freedom. Childhood malnutrition is an existential threat to our freedom. Corruption and state capture that literally steals food from the mouths of the poor is an existential threat to our freedom. A President who protects and shields\n\nhis Deputy President despite Zuma-level allegations is an existential threat to our freedom. [Applause.]\n\nSo, know this, every time the lights go out, every time the taps run dry, every time criminals attack us in our homes, every time a small business shuts down, every time a child dies of hunger, it reminds us all of the dream that we have lost.\n\nBut I have news for the President and his party. The people of South Africa are determined to take our dream back. And this year the people of South Africa will rescue this South African dream by using the most powerful weapon that they have, and that is their vote. [Interjections.]\n\nMr President, you recently made a baseless and dangerous claim that mysterious foreign agents were ... wanting to bring about regime change in South Africa.\n\nLet me give you this assurance. What is coming your way in this election is not regime change by foreigner actors, it is democratic change by the people of South Africa. [Applause.]\n\nVoting out a failing government is not a threat to democracy. Voting out a failing government is the greatest vindication of democracy. [Applause.] And it is the only way we can all rescue our South African dream.\n\nIn 1994 the dream that we all believed in ... [Interjections.]\n\n... was that the lives of this generation would be better than our parents. But in 2024 the nightmare that confronts us is that the lives of our children could be far, far worse than our own.\n\nAnd I don’t say that abstractly. I, too, am a father of three young daughters, and I, too, have great dreams for them. But like Tintswalo and millions of other citizens, I, too, am fearful about the future of my children, of your children, of our children in this country. And that is why South African people all across the country must now rise to the call of history in this election.\n\nNo matter how old you are, over the past 30 years we have all grown up as democracy’s children. We have learnt, sometimes painfully, that in democracy ... [Interjections.] ... that\n\nonly really works when we use our votes to hold those in power accountable.\n\nIn 2024 the people of South Africa will vote against those who have diverted South Africa from the promise of 1994 through their corruption, their greed and their incompetence. And they will vote for those who can practically restore South Africa to this path of promise through a proven track-record of delivery, of good governance and an ability to fix what the ANC has broken. [Applause.]\n\nLast week I announced the DA’s blueprint to rescue South Africa. Within the first 100 days as the anchor tenant of a new multi-party government, we will introduce the most comprehensive legislative reform agenda seen in a generation. We will rescue South Africa through concrete reforms and legislation. Not hollow talk and empty promises; reform and legislation. [Interjections.] And these reforms and legal changes will introduce within the first 100 days and will aim at the five following priority areas: Firstly, fixing the institution of Parliament so we can restore it as an engine room of reform.\n\nSecondly, ending loadshedding for all South Africans by embracing privatisation and the private sector.\n\nThirdly, abolishing cadre deployment in favour of merit-based appointments and a capable state. [Applause.]\n\nFourthly, halving the rate of violent crime including murder, attempted murder and gender-based violence, GBV.\n\nFifthly, growing the economy while creating jobs and protecting social grants. [Applause.]\n\nIf you had any doubt that the DA was the party to defeat the ANC, you only need to look at the ruling of the Constitutional Court yesterday, which now compels the ANC to hand over the complete records of the Cadre Deployment Committee ... [Applause.] ... dating back all the way to January 2013 when Mr Ramaphosa became its Chairman under Mr Zuma.\n\nNow, the DA expects the ANC and its newfound love for the rule of law to abide by this ruling, to expose its dirty cadre secrets and how Mr Ramaphosa’s committee laid the foundation\n\nfor state capture and collapse that we have witnessed across the country.\n\nAnd, let me be clear, if they try and subvert the rule of law, we will make sure that they are jailed for contempt of court in exactly the same way that Mr Zuma was. [Applause.]\n\nSo, mark your calendars, in just four days’ time, we will find this President’s fingerprints all over cadre deployment and state capture, the very thing he spent six years telling us that he was against.\n\nMy fellow South Africans, Tintswalo, Fatima, Johan and Sipho all voted for different political parties over the years. All of them, just like us, had different lived experiences. But what we are all united on, here and now, is that things cannot go on the way that they are. And what we all agree, is the urgent need to rescue South Africa and it’s the South African dream before it’s too late.\n\nThat is why in 2024, for the very first time, Tintswalo, Fatima, Johan and Sipho will vote for the same party, for the one party that has a proven track-record of getting things\n\ndone and a proven ability to rescue South Africa and restore the dream that they all share, and that party is the DA. [Applause.]\n\nThey will not do so because they believe and share everything, they will do so because they agree about one thing, and that one thing is that without jobs, without electricity, without running water, without an end to cadre deployment, without an honest government that serves the people and not the politicians, without functioning schools and working hospitals, all of our children will be doomed to lives far worse than our own. [Interjections] ... for?\n\nWe are South Africans and as South Africans we are all in this together. So, let’s be honest with each other.\n\nThis election is not about restoring about restoring the dream of 1994, it’s about keeping the dream alive. And when you come down to it, there’s only one real choice in this election, either our great South African dream dies, if the ANC comes back to power with radical coalition partners like the EFF and other destructive populists, or we rescue the South African\n\ndream through a new multi-party government with the DA at its heart. [Applause.]\n\nThe truth is that there’s only way to rescue Tintswalo’s dream, there’s only one way to rescue our South African dream, and that is by drawing our crosses next to the DA.\n\nIn this election, don’t vote out of fear. In this election, if you want to rescue our South African dream, vote for the DA. I thank you. [Applause.] [Interjections.]\n\nThe SPEAKER: Order, hon members! May I just make an appeal before the hon Minister speaks. Hon members, hon members ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... andifuni ukubiza ngegama.\n\nEnglish:\n\nHona members, please maan, let us allow the speakers to address us and not drown them. Allow them to be audible to be audible. It's difficult for us to hear from where we are when you are loud. I mean, there's no reason for you not to heckle, but you can do it in a very organised and decent manner. For\n\nnow, hon members are very loud. Thank you very much, hon members. Over to you, Minister.\n\nThe MINISTER OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY: Speaker of the\n\nNational Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo, His Excellency the President of the Republic, President Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa and hon members.\n\nThe important thing is that there are two sources of knowledge, it is experience and studying a subject. Now, if you don't do both, anything you say is an imagination. I can assure you that if you don't study and don’t have experience, you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nLet me start by reminding beneficiaries of apartheid, denialists, and apologies on what we have been dealing with over the past 20 years. Following the work of the architect, Dr Malan when consolidating the apartheid government, the apartheid’s master partisan Hendrik Verwoed said:\n\n“We are building a system with deep roots that no future government will ever undo.”\n\nMany people who criticise our government including some in this Parliament, argue that we must have done everything within 30 years. Never refer to atrocities of apartheid government. They conveniently forget that this country was colonised for 342 years, of which 46 were under apartheid. That is what we are swimming against, and we must continue swimming against that reality. It is a reality we must continue to swim against.\n\nThroughout this period the apartheid passion was the mining sector which was the roughest in terms of implementing apartheid policies. I experienced it. I couldn't put my head on a blasting certificate because it was reserved for a scheduled person, which was a term used to term a white person.\n\nSince South Africa attained democracy in 1994, government’s efforts were aimed at achieving a dream of transformation with a particular focus on ownership, management, and procurement. Hence, we enacted the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act in 2002 and introduced the Mining Charter in 2004.\n\nDuring the state of the nation address, the President reported on work that has been done to transform the economic sectors, more so the mining sector. Unfortunately, some members of this House cannot see progress, even if it hits them in the face, they can't see it. It hits them in the face, they can't feel it, they can't see it.\n\nWhen we did the research two years ago with the function of studying, we discovered that at the nine major mining companies that were studied, each one of them didn't have less than 50% of management structure being black. That is researched information, it is not thumb sucking.\n\nSecondly, we saw that the procurement initiative created a lot of businesspeople who are not necessarily seen as part of the mining sector, but they have developed on the back of mining. Some ultracrepidarians in and outside the House question the figure black ownership in mining sector as quantified by the President, with one of them suggesting that it is less than 10%.\n\nIt would help for people to do research on these things before they express their opinion. If they spend time and study the\n\nindustry, they would have known that if you talk coal, only one major company is white, most of them are black. Even if you take Seriti, Thungela and Exxaro, the list goes on and on. All of them will not be under 30%, or under 10%.\n\nThey would know that in the mining sector, if you talk of the African Rainbow Minerals, Kalahari Managanese, Ntsimbintle Holdings, and many other black owned mining companies, it is a long list. I can break it down and even go to gold where Arm is dominant, where Harmony is dominant, and the main shareholder is Arm.\n\nIn the Platinum Group Metals, PGMs, Nkwe Platinum, Ivanhoe, and Phalaborwa Mining Company have considered black ownership representation. So, when you quantify numbers, you don't do thumb sucking that is less than 10% without doing quality assessment of what is available then.\n\nIf you look at all these companies, you can see that there is practical progress being made. If one these as said is less than 10%, I cannot even talk about their mathematics. I can only talk about their arithmetic being flawed. Now, cognisant\n\nof the fact that mines are born out of exploration, we have just launched an Exploration Fund.\n\nIt's never late to do the right thing unless you are a beneficiary of other things earlier. If you have never been a beneficiary, it's never late. We will continue doing the right thing because the future is ahead of us. We can inherit the past, but we must build the future. If you don't know what it is to be under apartheid, you are a beneficiary. You will never know the beauty of the future. You will only imagine the beauty of the past. It is therefore important that we invest in exploration, so that the future of this very important sector continues to be bright.\n\nWe firmly believe that South Africa owns a significant quantity of minerals needed for the transition from high carbon emission to low carbon emission, which informs that the view of our mining industry is a sunrise industry. We have got the critical minerals in this country; we must discover them and exploit them.\n\nHaving appointed a service provider for design, implementation, and maintenance of mining licenses in cadastre\n\nsystem, we are optimistic that this system will soon help us accelerate the processing and prospecting of the mining industry.\n\nLet me because of the pressure of time go to the contribution of mining in the future of the energy sector. President, it’s a good thing that you wrote a speech for Mr Steenhuisen. He did not have to write a speech; you wrote it for him. He only spoke about Tintswalo.\n\nDespite the obstacles of the apartheid government guided Constitution, this government continues to strive for a national democratic society in which people enjoy equal rights and equal access to basic services. Like Tintswalo whom you wrote a speech about for Mr Steenhuisen, have access to electricity today.\n\nSince 2019, we have successfully connected 777 776 households with electricity, taking us to over 92% of South Africans having access to electricity. If you never experienced not having access to electricity, you will shout load shedding.\n\nYou will even forget that in your own house, when there's a box and you load it with several electrical appliances, it\n\ntrips. When you take access to electricity from 34 to 92, you are loading that infrastructure, and we must appreciate it and work and on load shedding.\n\nAs part of the concerted effort of secure and reliable energy supply, government introduced the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme. Since the launch in 2011, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has through the Independent Power Producers, IPP office, procured a total of\n\n13 266,9 megawatts from 140 IPPs whose technology are based on renewables, diesel, and battery storage.\n\nOf this capacity, 7 362,2 megawatts were from 95 IPPS that are currently connected to the grid and are supplying the much- needed electricity, but it puts to our discussion whether you can do renewables without base load. A combination of the two is what we require to deal with the challenges facing us.\n\nBut this ill-informed pressure put by the DA that we must go for renewables, switch off coal and go to renewables is ill- informed because it says, destroy base load and go to renewables. Intermediate behaviour of this is not taken into account because it is fashionable and nice to do so.\n\nNow the remaining 145 IPPs, the combined capacity 5942 are either in construction or preparing to reach commercial close and therefore, under the administration 5939 megawatts from 46 IPPs were procured resulting in a number of them being on the grid or at various stages of development.\n\nThe National Energy Regulator of South Africa, Nersa, has concurred with the Minister of Electricity, Mr Ramokgopa that\n\n2 500 nuclear capacities must be connected. It is gazetted and is at the stage of being launched. Mileham, who is the Shadow Energy Minister would be a disaster if he were to be a Minister. This is a problem. The reality of the matter is that that is where we are. We are going to be undoing the apartheid system against ... [Inaudible.] ... opposition.\n\nIn conclusion the hon President, let me refer a little bit towards the cerebrate called cadre deployment whatever. What it has done is that it has changed the situation where every director-general, DG, was a white male in 1994. It has changed the reality where every judge was a white male, where every mayor was a white male. The cadre development has changed that reality. So run to court, do everything, but the reality of the matter is we will do it. You will get your report, but we\n\nwill continue to deploy capable people. That's it. Thank you, hon Speaker.\n\nMr V F HLABISA: Hon Speaker, hon Chairperson of the NCOP, Your Excellency the President and hon members, as I speak in this debate, I feel the absence of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the founder of the IFP and South Africa’s trusted voice of reason. For 29 years, Prince Buthelezi spoke in this debate, giving us the real state of the nation. In honour of his leadership, let me echo his final warning to the ANC. He quoted from the very first state of the nation address to a democratic South Africa, when Madiba said:\n\nThe government I have the honour to lead ... are inspired by the single vision of creating a people-centred society ... freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from suppression and freedom from fear.\n\nThree decades later, that vision has disappeared. As Prince Buthelezi told us:\n\nIf the promise of South Africa is truly still alive, it is thanks to the resilience of our people. But how far is this government willing to test our resilience? They are playing a dangerous game.\n\nI am afraid, hon President, that one year after this sober warning, our people’s resilience is gone. Every day, in every corner of our country, our people live with the instinctive understanding that what is being done by the government of the day is wrong. We are left with this feeling, which we once had before.\n\nMy generation grew up with a government that showed nothing but contempt for the struggling people of South Africa. We entered democracy full of hope for change and in those first years of a government for the people, of the people, by the people, we were finally going in the right direction. As a Government of National Unity tore down every discriminatory law and replaced it with what is good and fair and just, we believed that South Africa would continue moving from strength to strength.\n\nWe witnessed how Prince Buthelezi, as the Minister of Home Affairs, tabled landmark legislation that is widely considered the high-water mark of migration policy and law. We saw South Africa’s doors being opened to skills and investment, a balance being struck between human rights and national security, and our interests being aligned with our values and international obligations.\n\nUnder the IFP’s Minister of Correctional Services, our prisons became more than centres of punishment, on the principle that rehabilitation for safe reintegration into society is essential to stop the revolving door of crime.\n\nUnder an IFP Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the National Arts Council was birthed, as was the\n\nPan SA Language Board, PanSALB — I’m talking about South Africa during the Government of National Unity — the SA\n\nHeritage Resources Agency and the National Heritage Council. Technical colleges were supported to increase innovation among small, medium and micro enterprises, SMMEs, and the For Women in Science programme recruited young women to career paths in science and technology.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, when our country was led by the Government of National Unity and KwaZulu-Natal was governed outright by the IFP, our country flourished. Reviewing the first 10 years of democracy, this is what the International Monetary Fund, IMF, said:\n\nSouth Africa has made impressive gains in stabilising the economy and laying a firm foundation for higher economic growth and a broad-based improvement in living standards. The public finances have been strengthened significantly, interest rates have been lowered and inflation has been brought firmly under control ... The rate of economic growth has more than doubled on average since the end of apartheid.\n\nHon President, this is the South Africa you would have us remember but that South Africa no longer exists. Twenty years into democracy, after the ANC had enjoyed unfettered power for\n\n10 years, the IMF’s review was far less glowing. They said:\n\nLiving standards have improved substantially in the first\n\n20 years of democracy. But in recent years the economy has underperformed peers. The outlook is lacklustre, with low growth, high unemployment, and elevated twin deficits.\n\nThirty years into democracy, the IMF could only shake its head and say:\n\nThe country has faced rolling blackouts after years of mismanagement ... The country’s elevated public debt level —\n\ncountry’s debt ... will require reducing the government wage\n\nHon President, listen closely to this one, because this is where the lie is exposed. You cannot point to 1994 as a measure of how far we have come under the ANC government because the ANC did not govern this country alone between 1994 and 2024. The strong and stable democracy that was built from 1994 to 1999 was built by the Government of National Unity; a government in which the IFP served. From 1999 to 2004, as the good work continued, the IFP remained in Cabinet.\n\nIt was only when the ANC gained unfettered power that government began to falter. Let us look at the facts. After\n\nyears of negative growth, in 1994 South Africa’s gross domestic product, GDP, began growing at a steady pace under the Government of National Unity. However, when the ANC took over, the President laments that the global financial crisis brought an end to a decade of strong growth. What he doesn’t mention is that the decade after the global financial crisis, and even before COVID, our country was still stagnant at a growth rate of just 0,26%. Over the last eight years, foreign investors have dumped South African stocks to the tune of R900 billion.\n\nWhat about unemployment? Under the Government of National Unity, the unemployment rate decreased year on year, every single year. Indeed, for 10 years, while the IFP held seats in Cabinet, unemployment decreased consistently. However, over the next 20 years, with the ANC firmly in power, unemployment leapt up to a staggering 15%.\n\nWhen it comes to crime, for the first 10 years of democracy, the crime rate decreased annually for eight years out of\n\n10 years. By 1999, after five years of a Government of National Unity, crime had decreased by 11%. Then, the ANC took over and by 2021 crime had increased by 23%.\n\nThe ANC is moving in the wrong direction. Stop looking for a pen to sign the National Health Insurance, NHI, Bill into law. The IFP is on record as supporting universal health access.\n\nHowever, the National Health Insurance Bill as it stands is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThis last Sona of the Sixth administration was not about the South Africa we live in. South Africa is in crisis. Our country is on autopilot mode, as President Mbeki confirmed. Tintswalo’s story is not the story of today’s youth. Unlike Tintswalo, 41% of our youth are unemployed. Thousands of National Student Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS, beneficiaries are still sitting at home with their degrees and diplomas, with no job. Doctors protested just yesterday. Their dreams are fading away. Millions of our children of democracy still live in shacks and informal settlements, with no clean water, toilets or refuse removal. Their only connection to Tintswalo is that she too sits vulnerably in the dark, on stage 6 load shedding.\n\nThe ANC’s failures are unforgivable. Consider what was achieved in just 10 years under IFP premiers in KwaZulu-Natal. Under an IFP premier, antiretrovirals were rolled out free of\n\ncharge for the first time, turning the tide on the HIV/Aids pandemic. The IFP set the trend for the whole country, enabling the Constitutional Court to instruct an ANC government to do in South Africa what the IFP was doing in KwaZulu-Natal. That is how the IFP serves the vulnerable.\n\nBy contrast, in January 2023, the ANC fed millions of learners rotting food because of corruption in the School Nutrition Programme and they failed to distribute 48 000 blankets, despite procuring them fraudulently for R22 million. That is how the ANC treats the vulnerable.\n\nUnder an IFP government, Ithala bank provided loans to emerging farmers and entrepreneurs, funding countless small businesses, but under the ANC, Ithala bank is closing.\n\nSo hon President, do not keep telling us what the ANC has done since 1994. Again, the ANC did not liberate South Africa nor build it alone. There were a number of political parties involved.\n\nThe ANC and the ANC alone gave us state capture. They gave us stage 6 load shedding. The ANC gave us nine wasted years. The\n\nANC gave us close to eight million unemployed people of South Africa. Let us not pull the wool over our people’s eyes and pretend that the ANC is the only party that can protect South Africa and do what is best for her. The ANC serves only the ANC. How many Members of Parliament and Ministers implicated in state capture have been taken to task? How many?\n\nHon President, you have put party before country. The damage done to South Africa is huge. Another five years under the ruling party is hard to contemplate. The IFP stands ready to be an alternative government to save South Africa. Hon President, you must be ready for the change of government.\n\nHon President, my generation did not get any solution in the Sona you delivered. As a result, unlike Tintswalo, the people of South Africa and our youth are disillusioned by the ANC, for they have lived through the destruction of our country at the hands of the ANC government.\n\nTherefore, 2024 is our 1994. We will do what we did in 1994. We will remove the government that has failed our people. [Time expired.] [Applause.]\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Speaker, hon\n\nChairperson, hon Deputy Speaker, hon President and hon Deputy President of the Republic, House Chairpersons, the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and Whips of other political parties, ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends, Ben Okri once said: “The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering.”\n\nThis debate takes place when South Africa celebrates a poignant moment in history, as we reach the 30-year milestone of the country’s constitutional democracy. Parliament’s strategic objective has been to create a non-racial, non- sexist and democratic society. Our primary mission has been centred on mobilising all classes and strata that objectively stand to gain from the success of the cause for social and economic change.\n\nIn this context, Parliament gives expression to its mandate, as informed by the precepts of transformative constitutionalism, which the former Chief Justice of South Africa, aptly asserts, as being an enabling instrument, to give expression to the country’s transformation agenda.\n\nIn his paper titled, Transformative Constitutionalism, Justice Langa further refers to the postamble of the interim Constitution, which he asserts, also expresses the pinnacle objective of South Africa’s Constitution, where he asserts that the underlying imperative of our Constitution is to provide: \"A historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy, a peaceful co- existence and development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.\n\nWhen I stand here, ...\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nEk dink nou maar net, ons moenie hiernatoe kom, omdat ons oor die verkiesing wil baklei nie; ons met hiernatoe kom, omdat ons die mandaat van die mense wil uitvoer. Die manaat van die mense is om seker te maak dat die Parlement die executive [uitvoerende raad] accountable [verantwoordbaar] hou.\n\nEnglish:\n\nAs we reflect on the 30-year milestone of our constitutional democracy, we must bear in mind what we have inherited. We have inherited a system that had inflicted far-reaching damage and oppression to millions of South Africans, on the basis of race. We must therefore observe this 30-year milestone, in the context of the progress made because of our rights-based agenda, which has been put in motion by our constitutional democracy, under the ANC. These rights, collectively represent our departure from a painful, oppressive and discriminatory past, as we lean in towards creating a new South Africa, from the ruinous past of colonialism and apartheid.\n\nDuring the first 30 years of our democracy, our Parliament had to deal with laws that support fairness and equality. We have repealed that oppressive and discriminatory apartheid laws and enacted laws to overhaul the functioning of the broader state machinery. These actions have helped to solidify our democracy and assisted us to make great strides towards realising our country’s democratic goals.\n\nFurthermore, the efficacy of parliamentary business, particularly through the committees and debates, in applying procedural processes and protocols, particularly, as outlined\n\nin the Constitution and in the Rules of both Houses, has significantly improved throughout the years. Through plenary discussions, questions, motions, and resolutions, Members of Parliament continue to actively and robustly participate in policy debates, while unpacking matters of national importance.\n\nOur improved co-ordination with the executive has also ensured the attendance of Ministers in the sittings of both Houses when required, leading to an increase in executive responses to questions for oral and written reply.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nTydens Covid-19 het die Parlement bewys dat ons, deur die gebruik van tegnologie, tot ’n groot mate, die uitdaging wat dit vir ons werk gebied het, kon oorkom.\n\nTwee weke gelede, tydens ons wetgewende summit [beraad], noem Prof Somadoda Fikeni iets baie belangrik. Hy sê wat mense van die Parlement observe [waarneem] is dat elke party op die platform van sy eie party staan, en ’n gesamentlike Suid- Afrikaanse identiteit het nie.\n\nDie enigste tyd wanneer ons onsself as Suid-Afrikaners identifiseer is wanneer die Springbokke die Wêreldbeker wen, wanneer Bafana Bafana goed doen in die Africa Cup of Nations, Afcon, wanneer ons atlete goed doen in die Olimpiese Spele.\n\nDis die tyd wanneer ons onsself as Suid-Afrikaners identifiseer.\n\nVolgens ons almal is daar foute en die ANC, as die regerende party, is die eerste een om die foute en die tekortkominge te erken. Dit moet ons sê: Ons staan nie hier en regverdig onsself oor dinge wat in die verlede gebeur het nie. Ons staan ook nie hier en regverdig onsself nie. Ons sal ook nie onsself verdedig, as ons nie ’n visie het vir die toekoms, om ’n beter lewe vir alle Suid-Afrikaners aan te bied nie.\n\nSuid-Afrikaners het die reg tot hul eie werklikheid. As iemand hier staan en die President wil antwoord op sy storie van Tintswalo, dan moet jy hom antwoord op die werklikheid van Tintswalo. Elke mens ervaar sy eie werklikheid. Daniel se werklikheid is nie John se werklikheid nie. So, jy kan nie iemand se werklikiheid ontken, as iemand vir jou sê: Ek het onder ’n boom gebly; ek het nou ’n erf met water en toegang\n\ntot elektrisiteit. Ek het in ’n sinkhuis gewoon; ek het nou toegang tot ’n RDP-huis.\n\nLoad shedding [beurtkrag] is nie die einde van die aarde nie. Ek, President, is een van die mense wat voel, sodra jy van load shedding [beurtkrag] praat, dan begin hulle jou saboteer. Ons sal iets aan daardie sabotasie moet doen. Ons sal definitief iets aan daardie sabotasie moet doen.\n\n[Onhoorbaar.] ...het nie al die antwoorde nie, maar Suid- Afrikaners weet dat ons van ’n verlede afkom, waar ons by kerslig vir ons matriekeksamens studeer het. Ons kom van ’n verlede af, waar ons emmers gebruik het. Baie van ons het wegbeweeg van die wrede verlede, en ons is nou by die punt waar ons waardigheid as mense respekteer word.\n\nDit is wat belangrik is. As mense se waardigheid nie respekteer word nie, waar sal ons gaan. Hoe kan John Steenhuisen saam met my in 1981 gedroom het? Ons werklihede verskil. Ons werklikhede verskil. Wat my werklikheid in Blikkies was, kon nie sy werklikheid in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal gewees het nie.\n\nDaar bestaan nie dieselfde werklikheid vir mense wat in apartheid gebenifit [baat gevind het] nie en vir ons, wat deur apartheid geleef het, net om te bestaan, om die dag van môre te kan sien.\n\nDis waarom ek sê dat ons die werklikheid van Tintswalo ken en ons ervaar die werklikheid van Tintswalo, want ons weet waarvandaan sy kom. Ons kan dus vir ander ’n beter toekoms probeer aanbied, omdat ons die verlede waarvandaan ons kom, ken.\n\nGewoonlik raak ek nie deel van julle bakleiery nie, want ek glo die Parlement moet ten alle tye probeer om almal te akkommodeer, maar dit is baie hartseer, as jy uitgaan en mense wat baat gevind het by hierdie regering sê dat die President “lieg”. Ek plaas dit tussen aanhalingstekens.\n\nEk sê weer, my werklikheid is nie jou werklikheid nie. Moenie my werklikheid ontken, omdat jy jou werklikheid beleef nie.\n\nElkeen van ons weet waarvandaan ons kom. My familie bly vandag nog in die villages [dorpe] van die Oos-Kaap. So, ons sien watter verbeterige aangebring is, as ons langs die pad afry\n\nKoshigaya toe. Ons sien al die huise wat vir die mense gebou is, waar daar voorheen geen huise was nie.\n\nSo, hierdie werklikheid wat ek ervaar, is my werklikheid en die werklikheid wat Tintswalo ervaar, is haar werklikheid. President, so, gaan voort met die goeie werk. Waar ons foute maak, sal ons dit aanspreek.\n\nJy voel jammer vir aunty [tannie] Fatima, wat nog kan samosas bak. Wat van die kinders van Palestina, wat elke dag doodgemaak word, en wat jy regverdig? Wat van die kinders van Palestina, wat elke dag doodgemaak word en wat jy regverdig? Jy voel dat Israel die reg het om homself teen kinders en weerlose vroue en mense te verdedig.\n\nDie werklikheid, wat ons as Suid-Afrikaners ervaar ... Elke een ervaar ’n verskillende werklikheid. So, laat ons hiervandaan gaan en weet, 30 jaar na demokrasie het ons nog steeds die hoop om die ongeregtigheid van 360 jaar uit te wis.\n\nMet daardie woorde sal ek nie terug na my speech [toespraak] gaan nie. Ek wil net een punt lig, kan ons asseblief vroue\n\ntoegang tot land gee, sodat ns as vroue kan wys dat ons ’n verskil kan mak waar ons is.\n\nTen spyte van geslagsgeweld, ten spyte van mishandeling, voer ons as leiers die polarisasie aan, omdat ons net hier staan en mekaar aanvaar en nie begin bou aan ’n gesamentlike Suid- Afrikaanse identiteit nie. Baie dankie.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nDr P J GROENEWALD: Agb President, u is nou ses jaar die President van Suid-Afrika maar dit is baie duidelik dat u in hierdie ses jaar ‘n kleinserige President geword het. Suid- Afrika is nie geseën met baie wêreldkampioene nie. U het die Springbokke gelukgewens en ‘n paar ander goeie prestasies op wêreldvlak maar u het nagelaat om vir Dricus du Plessis, ‘n wêreldkampioen, geluk te wens. Dit is kleinserig van u want hy het eintlik ... gesê en kritiek uitgespreek wat die meeste mense van Suid-Afrika weet maar blykbaar weet u dit nie. Ek wil vir Dricus du Plessis in hierdie Parlement sê, baie geluk met jou wêreldtitel. Dit is harde werk, baie discipline en harde oefening.\n\nEnglish:\n\nHon President, it is just natural ...\n\nThe SPEAKER: I’m sorry, hon Groenewald. Please take a seat. Hon member, what is your point of order? Use your microphone please.\n\nMr M P MAPULANE: Hon Speaker, I could hear the Afrikaans spoken by the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP but I can’t hear this Afrikaans. [Laughter.] So we are requesting that we get gadgets for interpretation. It’s quite important for us to hear.\n\nThe SPEAKER: Hon member, thank you for alerting us to the fact that you want it but there are gadgets on your chairs. Order, hon members!\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nStilte! Stilte asseblief.\n\nEnglish:\n\nContinue, hon Groenewald.\n\nDr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Speaker, I think it’s just natural for the President to look back over his term and I want to ask him today, hon President, what is your legacy? What is your legacy as President of South Africa?\n\nTherefore, we must go and look at the real facts. If we go and look at the economy, we will see that when you became the President in 2018, the economic growth rate was 1,3%. Last year, it was 0,9%. So, under your leadership, the economy just retreated backwards, causing havoc for the people of South Africa.\n\nAs leaders, we had a meeting on Eskom with you, and you yourself said that 20 years ago Eskom was seen as one of the best electricity utilities in the world. Who destroyed Eskom? The ANC destroyed Eskom. You were in charge of the war room to end load shedding. You failed.\n\nWhen you became President in 2018, the local currency against the dollar was nothing more than R11,55. Yesterday, it was R18,92. That is under your leadership. If you go and look at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, JSE, and ... the loss of 22% in US dollars, while if for instance you look at the Nasdaq-\n\n100, it gained 147% during your term as leader. The S&P 500 gained 75%. Those are the realities.\n\nIf you go and look at the unemployment rate, it was 24% when you became President. It is now 32%. If you go and look at the youth, since you became President and over the years, it increased by 20%, where the unemployment rate for young people, the youth at this moment, is actually 64%.\n\nI want to talk about corruption. The President himself said that the ANC is accused number one when it comes to corruption. That is what the President said and I said to you that you are number one of accused number one. Now, you have a number two who is also accused of corruption but nothing has happened. What happened with corruption in South Africa? In\n\nterms of corruption, the fact is that your secretary-general, Fikile Mbalula, said that they lied to protect the former\n\nPresident. The ANC misused its position to defend and protect the previous President.\n\nHon President, if you look up at the wall there you will see there is a banner about Parliament’s oversight and accountability. There was no accountability. There was no\n\noversight. It comes to you as well as the next President after Zuma. When it came to the Phala Phala issue, it was this ANC in Parliament that protected you. Why? You said you did nothing wrong. Why didn’t you come forward to be accountable to the people of South Africa? I want to quote what Archbishop Stanley Magoba said:\n\nIt is frightening that as a society, we have become so worn\n\ncaptured by lies.\n\nI want to talk about crime in South Africa. Hon President, in\n\nterms of the Global Organised Crime Index, South Africa now ranks seventh in the world and third in Africa because of\n\nmafia-style criminal networks and organised crime syndicates. When you became President, the murder rate was 35 per 100 000\n\nof the population. It is now 45 per 100 000 of the population.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nAgb President, u het in New York ontken dat daar so iets soos plaasmoorde in Suid-Afrika is. Ek moes ‘n paar debatte met u\n\ngevoer het nadat u minstens erken het dat daar wel plaasmoorde is en u het darem in ‘n mate gesê dat u dit veroordeel.\n\nAgb President, ons sê ons is almal gelyk voor die reg. My vraag is wat het in Groblersdal gebeur? Die agb Minister van\n\nPolisie en die agb Minister van Justisie gaan woon ‘n gewone\n\nhofsaak by waar daar besluit moet word of daar bail [borg] gegee gaan word of nie. Het hulle nie werk om te doen nie?\n\nHoekom gaan hulle daarheen? Hulle gaan daar want hulle het ‘n politieke motief en daardie motief is om die voorsittende\n\nbeampte te intimideer. Daar word nou van drie jongmense verwag om te rapporteer. Hulle het gerapporteer.\n\nEk het persoonlik ‘n klag teen Julius Malema in 2022 sowel as in 2023 gelê, waar hy uitings van shoot to kill [skiet om dood\n\nte maak] en the revolutionary must not be afraid to kill [die revolusionêr moet nie bang wees om dood te maak nie], gemaak\n\nhet. Die klagtes is gelê. Waarom word hy nie in hegtenis geneem nie? Laat hy ook aansoek gaan doen vir borg. Onder u leierskap is u besig om ongelykhede te skep. Hierdie manne het hulself gaan oorgee. Hulle is geregtig om borg te kry.\n\nEk wil oor hongersnood praat. Agb President, u Departement van Gesondheid sê dat meer as 15 000 kinders sterf jaarliks in Suid-Afrika en ‘n derde van daardie kinders sterf as gevolg van honger. Dit beteken basies dat 10 000 kinders sterf jaarliks weens honger. In KwaZulu-Natal, noord van Durban, is\n\ndaar kinders wat sand eet sodat hulle net kan voel dat hulle iets in hul mae het.\n\nEnglish:\n\nHowever, you hon President, have a plane named Inkwazi and I\n\nwant to say that there is also a restaurant, the Inkwazi restaurant, in that plane, where you wine and dine at a rate\n\nof R24 000 per person. So, you wine and dine for R24 000 per\n\nperson in the Inkwazi restaurant while children of South Africa are dying because of hunger. You are the Commander-in-\n\nChief. Did you investigate? If you did, what is the result, and if you did not investigate, why not, because that means\n\nthat you don’t feel for the hungry people of South Africa. I want to say, and I again want to quote what the Archbishop said:\n\nMeanwhile as politicians begin to realise they might not be in power after the next election, their deceptions, scams\n\nand fraud grow more blatant by the day, as they grow hungrier and hungrier by the day for the proceeds of power. They walk shamelessly and brazenly with their dirty feet through every aspect of our South African life.\n\nI want to say again, “with their dirty feet through every\n\naspect of our South African life.” The message is clear, hon President. It’s time to go. Thank you. [Applause.]\n\nThe MINISTER OF HUMAN SETTLEMENTS: Madam Speaker, greetings to His Excellency the President, Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy President, Paul Mashatile, presiding officers, Cabinet colleagues, hon members and ladies and gentlemen. I can’t believe that, hon Groenewald, you could stand here in a democratic South Africa and defend what happened in Groblersdal - apartheid and hoisting of apartheid symbols.\n\nShame on you!\n\nBaba Hlabisa, the worst you could have done to us is reminding us of what the IFP has done to us those who stayed in townships. The IFP was a symbol of mobilisation of tribalism and the death of many who lived in the townships closer to hostels and could not travel by trains.\n\nDespite that, in this democratic government, the ANC-led government has made sure that even hostel dwellers get their hostels upgraded and make them a residential area where families can live, because we believe that it is by doing so that we will build a reconstructed South Africa that is reconciled and a better nation for all despite the past. So, that is the worst thing you can do today.\n\nWhen the ANC-led government came into power 30 years ago, it undertook to build a new country that is based on equality, fairness and prosperity for all. Fundamentally, the ANC understood that moving away from apartheid did not only mean protection from unjust laws, but it also meant breaking all the pillars of apartheid of which spatial configuration was one, inspired by the Freedom Charter that stated that in the new South Africa that the African National Congress sought to build, there shall be houses, security and comfort.\n\nOur government adopted policies that allowed for the provision of houses for the poorest of the poor. Thus far, our government has already restored the dignity of many people and it will continue to do so by providing them with a dignified shelter. Our government further understood that a house is\n\nmade of walls and beams, but a home is built with love and dreams. It is for this reason that our housing policy has shifted since 1996, so that we could provide the majority of the people in this country with sustainable human settlements that are closer to economic opportunities and social amenities which enables them to fulfil their dreams in homes filled with love, health, safety and happiness.\n\nMr President, in your state of the nation address last week, you narrated a story of a democratic child, Tintswalo - that Tintswalo’s formative years were spent in a house provided by the state, one of millions of houses built to shelter the poor. Indeed, under the leadership of the ANC-led government, the number of formal households grew from 5,2 million in 1996 to 15,8 million in 2022. [Applause.] Households living in traditional dwellings has, likewise, significantly reduced since 1996, with over 1 million fewer households living in traditional dwellings in 2022, as compared to 1996.\n\nWhilst there can be no doubt that government has built millions of houses through the RDP programme, it has also built thousands of units of social housing, rectified housing defects, provided housing material to individuals households\n\nand contributed significantly to cases of emergencies and disasters.\n\nOf the 10,6 million additional households now living in formal dwellings, 4,8 million households were provided with formal houses by this government. [Applause.] In terms of gender, out of those that we have provided in terms of the state houses, 1,9 million are households led by women as beneficiaries. For example, last year we handed over a newly built house to Mme Ela Thabane from Bela-Bela.\n\nSepedi:\n\n... Mme Ella Hlabane kua Bela-Bela. Ge re be re bolela le Mme Hlabane, o ile a re botia gore e sa le a thoma go dula ka gare ga mokhukhu mengwaga ye lesome-hlano ya go feta. O be a ikwa a thabile kudu ge a bona a tsena ka gare ga ntlo. O leboga mmuio wa ANC ge o mo file bodulo moo a ikwago a iireletiegile ka nnete.\n\nEnglish:\n\nLast week, Mr President, you called on all of us to join the fight against Gender-Based Violence and Femicide, GBVF, which has been characterised as a second pandemic in our country.\n\nThe provision of houses to women has gone a long way in helping women fight GBVF. A woman who owns a house and has security of tenure does not have to be trapped in an abusive relationship that often ends in femicide.\n\nFor this reason, we have also intensified our title deeds release programme to ensure security of tenure and provide economic asset to the beneficiaries. When we handed over a title deed to Mme Mabel Sokgopa – in the City of Tshwane, Garankuwa under MAWIGA. It was a very moving ceremony where we heard ...\n\nSepedi:\n\n... mme a bolela a re mafelelong o hweditie thaetlele titi moo a tsebago gore ga go na motho yoo a tla mo ntihago ka mo gare ga ntlo. O re o tla dula moo a ikhutia, a tseba gore batlogolo ba gagwe le bana ba gagwe ba a tseba gore ke mo a dulago gona.\n\nEnglish:\n\nSimilarly, when we handed over a title deed to 100 years old, Ms Prakash, she said it was an exciting moment for her to receive the title deed as a homeowner at that age. She moved to that house 40 years ago during the Group Areas Act\n\nmovement. This is our restoration of dignity in ensuring that women who could not own title deeds under apartheid government have a say and have properties in their hands. [Applause.] Mr President, stories such as this one are a clear demonstration that we are not passive observers of our history, but authors of this history.\n\nNot only have we provided housing to women, but we have also embarked on a women empowerment programme through procurement processes. You will recall, Mr president, that when you marked National Women’s Day in 2020, you announced government’s plans to expand women’s access to economic opportunities by setting aside 40% of public procurement for women-owned businesses.\n\nFor our part as the Department of Human Settlements, including our entities, we have made this our policy in all our grants. I can report today under this programme and your vision that not only are we talking about the past in what we have done, but in this Administration, we have ensured that 40% out of the R13,2 billion is set aside in this financial year for women owned companies. As we speak, already R1,7 billion has been spent on their companies and we believe that we will reach our 40%. [Applause.]\n\nThis is an instance where you find Limpopo and Mpumalanga the entire budget on HSDG in building houses is spent on women contractors. I must say that they deliver, Mr President, within budget and in record time and quality houses. [Applause.]\n\nIn the 2020 state of the nation address, Mr president, you spoke about the social housing programme to build rental housing for low-income families, which could leverage as much as R9 billion private investment in the construction of 37 000 rental apartments. Again, I am pleased to report that working in partnership with Infrastructure SA, which was launched under this Administration, the Social Housing Regulatory Agency, SHRA, has increased the pipeline of social housing projects, some which are complete and some halfway.\n\nJust here in the Western Cape, three projects, Goodwood Station worth R464 million with 1055 units has been completed. Maitland Mews valued at R94 million with 204 units completed. Eight projects in Gauteng: Riverside Mews phase three and four valued R531 million will be completed in October this year.\n\nLufhereng valued at R184 million, with 407 units completed.\n\nFochville valued at R105 million, with 258 units completed. There are many more.\n\nYou go to KwaZulu-Natal, we have Hospital Street Social Housing Project which is seating at 54%, Bridge City Project seating at 78%, and also in the Northern Cape we have Hull Street seating at 40% to the value of R144 million. Mpumalanga with Kwandokhuhle valued at R193 million, with 492 units at 32%. This is work that we continue under your leadership, Mr President.\n\nYesterday, I had an engagement with community-based organisations, CBOs, non-government organisations, NGOs and civil society organisations, CSOs here in the Western Cape who were appealing to national government to protect and provide services. They narrated how they live in a city that doesn’t care about them. Similarly, I went to Nomzamo community, they narrated the conditions they live in where rubbish is not collected, and sewer is running in the street. They reminded us that, Minister, don’t listen to them when they say they govern better and rule better. It is a fallacy and for a few.\n\nWith regards to our policies, we committed to them that we will change our policies, principles and programmes to ensure that if a government, province or municipality does not care about our people, we will come in as national government and show that we care as we continue to do.\n\nMr President, the Draft White Paper ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: As you conclude, hon member.\n\nThe MINISTER OF HUMAN SETTLEMENTS: Thank you very much. As I conclude, as we say we can never allow people who tell us not to talk about apartheid because it is 30 years later.\n\nShockingly, the same people who are supporting apartheid are Israel under us.\n\nMr president, our policies are geared to help South Africa, and that is why we say that with the work that we have done, the foundation that has been laid, we continue to provide services for all, not discriminatory. This is a government that can be trusted, and vote for the ANC ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]\n\nMs C LABUSCHAGNE: Hon Speaker, Mr President, Members of Parliament, honoured guests and the most important people - fellow South Africans, from our history it is evident that we are resilient people, able to adjust and survive even in extreme difficult times and circumstances. However, Mr President, after your five-year term of empty promises, you and your ANC government are certainly testing our resilience. From constant load shedding, forever increasing violent crimes, high levels of unemployment, especially the youth, loss of investments due to corruption, poor management, and cadre deployment – all of it has ultimately contributed to our critical economic situation.\n\nA government’s main task is to create an environment for economic growth and opportunities, as well as to provide service delivery through effective policies and legislation. None of which you have been able to achieve in your term. In fact, Mr President, you have done the exact opposite.\n\nIf we take only but one example, the National Health Insurance, NHI, Bill, which has just been bulldozed through Parliament with your ANC majority, will actually provide people with less health care – specifically affecting the\n\npoorest of the poor. It is clear as day that the NHI Bill is unconstitutional and unimplementable. This has been pointed out not only by the DA, but also by organisations such as Business for South Africa, BSA, and Business Unity SA, Busa. Even medical associations such as the SA Medical Association have warned that we will have a complete skill drain of medical practitioners should this Bill be implemented.\n\nMr President, it is clear that the NHI Bill will be the final nail in South Africa’s economy and will completely collapse an already underfunded and decimated public health sector.\n\nDespite passing this Bill, South Africans still do not even know how it will be funded. The only conceivable way would be to increase taxes on an already overtaxed population. One only has to look at the troubles our public healthcare system is facing to know that this Bill is nothing more than a cheap political tool for the ANC to try and save itself from inevitably losing its majority.\n\nAlmost all public health facilities are understocked and underfunded with many not having the necessary equipment to complete lifesaving operations. In fact, most public hospitals do not even meet the minimum criteria for certification by the\n\nOffice of Health Standards Compliance. Some public hospitals do not even have computers or electricity at times, with doctors having to operate with cellphones’ torches. In Some hospitals, patients are pulled up flights of stairs to the operating rooms because the lifts either don’t work from lack of servicing, or because they are not exempt from load shedding.\n\nHow can we possibly implement this Bill when we have the shining beacons of maladministration and corruption such as Livingstone Hospital in the Eastern Cape, Pelonomi in the Free State, or Rahima Moosa in Gauteng? We have a massive shortage of doctors and nurses in the country. Just the other week, we heard how approximately 800 doctors who recently graduated and finished community service are sitting at home without a job because the ANC government cannot fund them – all the while we pay millions of rands a year for Cuban doctors to come to South Africa. Even your own Minister of Health admitted that there is no funding for these posts – where are we supposed to fund the NHI from when we can’t even put doctors in our hospitals.\n\nThe budget implications for the NHI Bill are enormous. Again, one of your very own, the Minister of Finance, has stated that there is no money to implement the NHI. If your own Minister has admitted this, then why, Mr President, are you playing with people lives for the sake of cheap politicking. Its time you play open cards with us all, admit that NHI is not financially feasible and put business and medical associations and the people of South Africa at ease.\n\nBut I can go on. The feedback received during the public participation processes of the NHI Bill was not carefully considered by neither the National Assembly nor the National Council of Provinces. Public participation is one of the core elements of what makes our Constitution and lawmaking one of the strongest around the world.\n\nMr President, the DA wrote to you requesting you to refer the NHI Bill back to Parliament as it will not pass constitutional muster. Both Busa and BSA have written to you requesting you not to sign the Bill. You cannot just stick your head in the sand and pretend that these very real issues do not exist. It is prescribed in the Constitution that you must refer a Bill back to Parliament if there are constitutional concerns, but\n\nit looks like you would rather pander to your ANC colleagues than to your constitutional obligations. You have had your chance, but your time is now up, Mr President.\n\nThe DA will fight for the achievement of realistic universal health care and will ensure that public facilities are strengthened to improve service delivery and accountability without detrimentally financially burdening our country, as the unconstitutional NHI Bill will do. Under a DA-anchored government, no person will be excluded from accessing quality health care. Under a DA-anchored government there will be a progressive realisation of these rights, as enshrined in Section 27 of the Constitution.\n\nSepedi:\n\nMna C N MALATJI: Sepikara sa Ngwako wa Bosetihaba, Mopresidente wa rena, Motlatiamopresidente wa rena ...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, I am not going to greet those who contributed to the killing of the people of Palestine. I am not going to greet the IFP, the political party that was funded by the right-wing murderers\n\nwho have killed the people of Thokoza, KwaZulu-Natal, Sebokeng, and many other parts of South Africa - the people who worked against the people’s power.\n\nPresident, the story of Tintswalo is a story of hope reflecting on opportunities and possibilities created by the breakthrough democracy, touching and transforming the lives of people from as far as Dzingidzingi and Dhlomo in the deep rural areas. We also acknowledge that there are many young people who are not employed or in education or in training programmes, and their social economic challenges must be addressed urgently. They also want to be the Tintswalos.\n\nThirty years into democracy, our challenge to ensure that we sustain areas of progress to make sure the people of South Africa continue to have access to electricity, water, sanitation, waste collection and other basic services. South Africans want a consistent and effective policy implementation led by the ANC. Despite technical glitches impacting on the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS, over 4,1 million university students and 2,4 million Technical and Vocational Education and Training, TVET, colleges’ students have been supported by NSFAS since 1994. Those are the achievements.\n\nPresident, just to remind them that in 2024, after a clear outcry, NSFAS must also try to assist those whose combined household income bracket exceed R350,000 per annum, and were not funded before. The ANC-led government is committed to assist to fund those that have been missing in that area.\n\nBecause we understand as the ANC that there are people who are too rich to access NSFAS, but too poor to afford education.\n\nPresident, we also welcome the 1,6 million presidential employment programme opportunities created for youth placement in various sectors to gain skills and experience. Digital technology has created many opportunities as the youth earn income through online platforms, building their own creative careers. For example, President, through the influence of the ACD-led government, our local DJ’s are able to showcase their talent and promote their music internationally. President ...\n\nSepedi:\n\n... ga re bolele ka mamina mo; re bolela dilo tia nnete.\n\nEnglish:\n\nIn the previous financial year, the National Youth Development Agency, NYDA, empowered 2 320 youth-owned enterprises through\n\nthe financial interventions which took from the NYDA Grant Programmes and NYDA Voucher Programmes. Through this financial business interventions 6 796 jobs were created for young people employed by youth-owned businesses. Those are the achievements of the ANC.\n\nSepedi:\n\nGa re bolele ka mokete wa dikatse. Le Steenhuisen a ka holega ge a nyaka.\n\nEnglish:\n\nThrough the mentorship access to the market and business management training programmes, the NYDA provided 34 209 young people support. There is a direct relationship, President, between funding of youth-owned enterprises and the creation of jobs. One of the most significant achievements was the removal of work entry experience and entry-level employment by government. We call upon the private sector to follow the instruction of the President – your funders, DA.\n\nMr President, we welcome the Unemployment Insurance Fund, UIF- funded Labour Activation Programme, Lab, that seeks to support employment and the training of the youth. We know the\n\nintention is to create 2 million work opportunities in the immediate future. We urge the Department of Employment and Labour supported by Treasury to roll out this programme without delay.\n\nPresident, the following programme must urgently be fast- tracked. We must reskill the youth to respond to the economic demand of the country, the challenging world of intelligence and digital transformation. We need a massive higher education through data transformation to ensure that we target and make sure we meet the National Development Plan target. We shall continue when we come back in the 7th administration to open the doors of learning and teaching.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nSiyabuya.\n\nEnglish:\n\nPresident, Unisa and other universities during COVID-19 demonstrated such capabilities. We should develop the state- of-the-art specialised universities and TVET colleges aligned with our national strategy and the capabilities of the various districts. Our higher education institutions do not only\n\ncontribute to the skill development, but also a high impact on local economic development where there are institutions of higher learning. Higher education institutions should also be aligned with our mega infrastructure projects of development.\n\nPresident, it is only the ANC-led government that was able to break the cycle of poverty in many families and one of the key achievements were delivered by the ANC. Today, a child of a domestic worker, a child of an informal worker, or a child of unemployed parent is a doctor, an engineer, a chartered accountant, a pilot, a CFO, a CEO, and many other professions. It is only because of the ANC-led government in the past 30 years.\n\nIt is clear, President, that even if they deny, some in the DA are products, they are the Tintswalos, they know that they are the products of the Tintswalo programme of the ANC. President, Premier Panyaza Lesufi has demonstrated that provinces can also expand new development programmes through the Nasi iSpani programme. The provincial employment programme should be doubled, and all provinces should show the example of Gauteng, including the Western Cape.\n\nWe must address the market dominance in the telecommunication sector. President, the youth of the country has long demanded a free data for all, and we know that when we come back, it shall be implemented. The global trends have shown that the small business sector is the highest job creator supported by national economy. South Africa remains the most unequal country, where the wealth is still controlled by the white male minorities, and that shall be restructured. We urgently call upon the restructuring of the economy, for the economy of the country reflects the demographic of the country. We shall decisively address the land question to agricultural production and human settlements so that to address ... [Time expired.]. Thank you very much.\n\nMr B H HOLOMISA: Chairperson, hon President and Deputy President and hon members. Mr President, the UDM fully agrees with the sentiment that South Africa must be rebuilt, as you had indicated in your state of the nation address. The UDM will give its perspective on this question, where I will have more time on 2 March at the Gallagher Convention Centre, when we will be launching our manifesto for the 2024 national and provincial elections.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nXa sisakha le ndlu iza kusikhumbuza ke Mongameli ukuba phaya eBhayibhileni kwincwadi yoMprofeti uHagayi isahluko sesibini ivesi yesibini neyesithathu ithi:\n\nNgubani na kuni apha oseleyo, apha owayibonayo le ndlu isebuqaqawulini bayo? Niyibona iyintoni nak e ngoku?\n\nSiza kubeka ke izinto ezifana neKomishoni kaZondo sijonge ukuba kulo monakalo wenzekileyo siphi ngoku.\n\nEnglish:\n\nWhat I would like to raise with you Mr President, in the limited time I have, is the matter that you had last year instructed Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana to attend to, which is the matter of the SATBVC states pensioners. Your public instruction created a legitimate expectation within the community of thousands upon thousands of ex civil servants and their families, that their complaints will at long last be attended to.\n\nMr President a year has lapsed, and nothing has happened to fulfil your instruction. Aside from a meeting I had with the\n\nMinister on 22 March 2023, that created some expectations with the Pensioners’ Committee, nothing further happened.\n\nAs you might be aware, the SATBVC pensioners have now resorted to a legal route to seek to affect your instruction, which will take time and resources, yet National Treasury, Government Employees Pension Fund, GEPF and the Public Investment Corporation, PIC did not go to court or consult with anyone before they used pensioners’ moneys to bail out state-owned enterprises, SOEs and funded Black Economic Empowerment, BEE transactions to the tune of billions of rands.\n\nI would therefore strongly recommend an alternative solution from your office, and that is, that an independent body, with chartered accountants and tax experts, be mandated to handle the matter with subpoena powers to clear the house. That the erstwhile asset managers like Sanlam and others, the GEPF, the PIC and National Treasury be made to give answers to this independent body.\n\nWith its primary goal to clear as many claims as possible, as soon as possible because the consequences of our decisions\n\naffect people’s lives Mr President, as some of these pensioners have passed away in 2023 and others long before that, who did not get to enjoy the benefits of their labours.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nOomakhulu nootatomkhulu bale ntwazana kuthiwa nguTintswalo bafuna imali yabo ababeyikhuphe kwingxowa yomhlalaphantsi. Abalwi nani bafuna iimali zabo zabo abantu. Yekani ukuthatha iimali zemihlalaphantsi nizisebenzise ...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... to beef up BEE companies ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... ningabanikanga. Musani ukutya yonke into le.\n\nEnglish:\n\nA similar scenario is playing out amongst ex mineworkers who had been promised attention during former Presidents Mbeki and Zuma’s tenures, who had been retrenched using the so-called blue-card system. The UDM proposes that a task team ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: As you conclude.\n\nMnu B H HOLOMISA: Hayi ndinemizuzu emihlanu. Awuphazami kuba ndinemizuzu emihlanu emihlanu hayi emithathu?\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No hon hon Holomisa, look at the watch on your right.\n\nMnu B H HOLOMISA: Hayi uyandikhohlisa. Kodwa ke sithi kuyo yonke loo nto, kwezingxaki zasemigodini eMahlabathini naseRustenburg, abantu mabanikwe iimali zabo. Abanye baseMahabathini bekuthiwe baza kunikwa amalungelo ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Your time is up.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nMnu B H HOLOMISA: Hayi ndisathetha makwedini yimani. La masala la.\n\nMr A N SARUPEN: Mr President in November 2017 you promised, if you were elected leader of your party that, you would implement a 10-point new deal, echoing Franklin Roosevelt and you promised to pull millions of South Africans out of poverty and into the mainstream economy.\n\nWe stand here six and a half years later, and that utopian landscape that you painted then has not come to pass. What we instead have, is the shadow of unfulfilled promises and a deepening economic crisis. This is because of the failures of your government particularly in job creation. You broke the very promise that you made to the country and the young bear the brunt of this crisis. Seventy per cent of young people aged 15 to 24 have been unable to secure jobs.\n\nThe government’s stranglehold on the business environment has choked the ability for this economy to create jobs.\n\nUnemployment has surged from 20% in 1994 since we hear a lot in this debate about its progress since 1994. So, let’s us look at some progress. Twenty per cent in 1994, we now have 32,9% in 2024. When you include people who have given up on employment because they cannot find a job, that unemployment rate is an alarming 42,4%.\n\nNow, to add insult to injury, instead of rectifying our economic mistakes, the ANC has shifted the burden onto a shrinking tax base and plans to do this again later this month in the budget. Slow economic growth has created a tax-to-GDP ratio of 25%, which is one of the highest in the world. South\n\nAfricans perhaps have the highest tax-to-GDP ratio in the world. South Africans are overburdened with tax. The citizens pay much more tax compared not to wealthy countries, but to developing and middle income countries. The citizens through tax are paying a huge financial price to fund the ANC’s failures.\n\nThe government’s failure to manage public debt has pushed us into a fiscal crisis, and 20% of all government revenue is now dedicated to servicing debt, not health care, not police, not teachers, debt. This means that we have limited resources for investments into infrastructure and essential services. The national debt is now over R5,2 trillion and South Africa cannot go on like this.\n\nIn the debate today so far, we heard that the ANC doubled down on black economic empowerment, BEE and cadre deployment. This shows who their constituency is. It is not the millions of South Africans looking for work or looking for opportunities. Their real constituency are a handful of cadre deployees and a few thousand BEE billionaires. Their entire system as they debated today so far shows us who they are going to take care of should they attempt to win another election.\n\nSouth Africa cannot go on like this. Thankfully, every piece of information shows us Mr President that you are the outgoing President. If the voters make the right choice, we will not face a green coalition of doom, but we will have a blue coalition of change. Now, le t me tell you what the blue coalition government for change of the DA-led government will do. I see the ANC is heckling a lot when we mention the coalition for change. It is precisely because they are terrified that they all will be prosecuted for corruption and maladministration whenever we mention the change of government. [Interjections.]\n\nWith this blue coalition of change, we get the economic engine revving again. It is essential to do so to lift millions of South Africans out of poverty. We will do so by overhauling labour regulations that limit job growth. We will make sure that young people and older people that have been locked out of the economy get skills and apprenticeship programmes. We will boldly put an end finally to apartheid classification of race and employment equity and preferential procurement. We will no longer use those outdated and ... [Inaudible] ... categories to classify people. Our focus will be on\n\nmeritocracy and nonracialism, to make sure that diversity and merit thrives.\n\nOn the tax system, we will commit to no new taxes, unlike what the Finance Minister will be announcing from now. We will also prevent hidden tax increases, and to make sure the poor are taken care of, who are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis. The ANC Members of Parliament who all earn more than a million rands love to heckle about the poor. None of them are in that basket. But, for the poor out there, we will expand the zero-rated vat food basket so that you can buy chicken, you can buy ... [Inaudible] ... nutrients and you can feed your families.\n\nLastly, we will make sure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes by ensuring that SA Revenue Service, Sars has the capabilities. We will undo the gutting of Sars under state capture. We will also rescue public finances from the fiscal cliff. We will stabilise public debt. We will make sure that we don’t waste government money, unlike the hecklers on this side here. We will end this obsessive culture of bailouts to state-owned enterprises and looking forward to the Appropriations Committee on Wednesday because I believe SA\n\nAirways, SAA has lost another R7 million in the last year. We look forward to taking you on bailouts there.\n\nWe will also rescue small businesses, and make sure that we will build an export-oriented economy that make sure that we rescue South Africa from this economic calamity. This is not going to come about through any new deal or new dawn. As we look back, we have gone from the new deal to the new dawn, to a false dawn and now to rarmageddon.\n\nSo, the choice for the country is clear. We can’t carry on with unfulfilled promises. Thank you to the ANC, your time is up as mine now ends as well. But we will get a better tomorrow with a blue coalition of change that will rescue South Africa.

I want to say to...\n\nIsiZulu:\n\n...aboTintswalo abaningi lapha ngaphandle...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... you are worthy, you are capable, and you are deserving of a better future.\n\nIsiZulu:\n\nNgicela kuthiwe namhlanje ngiyini, ngiwu- swepper, kodwa anginikezwanga umshanyelo ngoba uma ngabe benginikeziwe umshanyelo ngabe ngithathe wonke lamazwi avela ngapha ngawashanyela kancane, kancane, ngaze ngayowakhipha ngomnyango. [Ihlombe.] Kodwa aninginikangaka umshanyelo esikhathini esizayo ngicela ninginike umshanyelo. Ngicela ukuthi ngithi ningalaleli u-Steenhuisen ...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... with his lot. Don’t listen to people whose sole purpose of existence is to demoralise you. They tell you that nothing has happened since 1994. Don’t listen to hon Steenhuisen and his lot who don’t listen to nobody but himself and his lot. Don’t listen to the so call moon-shot. Don’t listen to pessimism.\n\nDon’t listen to those people who want to tell you that nothing has happened since 1994.\n\nMr President, I want to say today we are here because we are a government that cares. We are here because many of my\n\ncolleagues have spoken about the past of where we came from and where we are. I do want to remind you, the Chairperson and hon members, that those who struggled to bring this South Africa to where it is today, at the time that we were struggling thought that it would not be possible. We thought that democracy would not come. We thought we were lost, and we would die outside. Those who were in prison and all that thought it wasn’t going to be possible, but what made it possible was the commitment of all South Africans irrespective of race, colour, or creed, who stood up and said apartheid - like Israel apartheid - would not survive because many people commit themselves to changing the lives of people.\n\nHon Chairperson, let me remind the naysayers and those with self-inflicted amnesia of what we inherited when we came into office. The destruction of the family units and communities torn apart by the slave trade and a migrant labour system, which we still suffer from today. Apartheid policies that impoverished individuals created spatial poverty traps and negatively impacted on the human capital formation of black people, in particular. A fragmented social welfare system based on race, gender, and geographical location. Welfare policies, legislation, and programmes were inequitable,\n\ninappropriate, and ineffective in addressing poverty and basic human rights. I would like to say Mr President, as a Minister of Social Development it pains me to walk up and down the streets of Cape Town and see the number of people who are homeless. It pains me to hear the DA speak so much, just 200 meters away from here walk down the street Mr President. I will invite you one day to walk and see how many of our people are languishing in poverty on the streets of Cape Town. [Interjections.] I say to the people of South Africa, we care even for those who are out there because they are part and parcel of ourselves. We care for them. This government of the Western Cape that pretends to be taking care of our people, just walk out there and see what it is. [Applause.]\n\nMr President, in your state of the nation address, you outlined the remarkable journey we have traversed and the massive gains we have achieved under this government for all South Africans. As you sit here watching me, I want to tell you something. I don’t look at any South African from any point of view other than the fact that they are a South African who needs assistance. This is a South Africa that needs to be paid attention to by the government of the National African Congress. What have we done since then? [Applause.]\n\nIsiZulu:\n\nNgiyambona noSolly ukhona la phakathi kwenu. Mina noSolly sithathene laphaya e-NCOP. Ngiyabezwa nje o-Steenhuisen namhlanje sekuyibo asebekhuluma ngezibonelelo zemali[grants.] Impela? Nina? Hhe! [Uhleko.] Yinina esenikhuluma ngezibonelelo zemali, nina ebenisitshela ngokuthi...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... the economy is not capable of paying the grants.\n\nIsiZulu:\n\nYinina esenikhuluma ngezibonelelo zemali ngoba sesiya okhethweni. Yini ebenisitshela, nisasitshela namanje ukuthi...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... if the economy does not grow ...\n\nIsiZulu:\n\n... asikwazi ukubhadala izibonelelo zemali.\n\nEnglish:\n\nLet me tell you, we have been paying the grants from 1994 to date. [Applause.] Even when the economy is not doing very well.\n\nWe have stood up and said we shall be with the people of South Africa, whether the economy is doing well or not. It remains our responsibility and our capability to make sure that those who have absolutely nothing at least we can give them something and help them to lift themselves up.\n\nYou are saying give the man a rod to fish. I am saying where is that river. Where is that fish you are talking about? We have a river, and we have the fish. [Interjections.] What we have done, hon Speaker, we have improved access to sustainable livelihoods and entrepreneurial opportunities through grant funding and capacity-building of civil society organisations. Progressively expanded social protection coverage from\n\nR2,4 million in 1994 to a hopping R28 million to support those who cannot support themselves.\n\nWe are currently providing regular income support each month without fail, to more than 4 million older persons, about one million adults with disabilities and 160 000 children with disabilities. More than 13 million children from poor households receive the child support grant, while another\n\n237 000 children are supported through our foster care grant.\n\nProvide financial support to the tune of R8,2 billion to non-\n\nprofit organisations. Increased the number of children benefitting from early childhood development, ECD. Mr President, you spoke so eloquently about ECD because it was Tintswalo, the first one that we have in the 30 years. The Tintswalo of the future next 30 years will be very different from the one of the current 30 years. [Applause.]\n\nWe have created over 500 000 employment opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme. Addressed the disproportionate impact of poverty on women through women empowerment initiatives. Passed progressive pieces of legislation such as the Children’s Act to ensure the protection of children. Intensified international collaboration with development and UN agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP and ILO on best practices. Expanded access to care and support services for victims and survivors through the implementation of Pillar 4 of the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence. Capacitated the Gender-Based Violence Command Centre and the National Emergency Response Team, NERT.\n\nI also would like to say, Mr President, we need not look any further than the 2023 National Senior Certificate results. Of the 897 775 Grade 12 learners who wrote the NSC, 543 786 full-\n\ntime learners were social grant beneficiaries, with 62 out of the 110 top performing learners in different categories. Mr President, we do say today...\n\nIsiZulu:\n\n... qaba, qaba sisazobuya...\n\nEnglish:\n\n... when we further explain during the budget speech. [Applause.] Thank you, Chairperson.\n\nIsiZulu:\n\nNina hambani niyolala.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much. We will now have a lunch break and returning at 13:30. We will leave in the following order: the Speaker, the President, Deputy President and the rest of us. I am told that the lun"
