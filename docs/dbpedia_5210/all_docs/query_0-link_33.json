        "text": "The interviews included in this Report cover a range of experiences, including participation in the activities of the Natal Indian Congress in the 1940s and the Congress Alliance – the African National Congress, Congress of Democrats, South African Indian Congress, and South African Coloured People’s Congress – in the 1950s, such as the Defiance Campaign, the Freedom Charter Campaign, and the Congress of the People, and the impact of the 1956-1961 Treason Trial. The turn to armed struggle by organisations opposing apartheid in the early 1960s is the subject of a number of the interviews, as is the activities of the armed wings of the liberation movements during this period. Included here are the formation of the Pan Africanist Congress and National Liberation Front, the activities of the PAC’s armed wing, Poqo, and the armed wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe, during the 1960s. A number of the interviewees experienced imprisonment during the decade, as well as harassment by the apar...\n\nM.A. (Historical Studies)Abstract: The Cape Corps was a unit of Coloured soldiers raised in the Union of South Africa as an Imperial Service Contingent during the First World War. Birthed under difficult political circumstances, the Corps was ultimately an Imperial project animated by Governor-General Buxton and other liberal whites, and it came about despite the reluctance of Jan Smuts and others within both the South African and National Parties. Despite this reluctance, Coloureds and the APO responded to the outbreak of the First World War with persistent calls to be allowed to fight and this dissertation has argued that Coloured men in particular considered the war as an opportunity to stake a claim in the masculine citizenship of the Union. This masculine aspiration in fact underpins a major theme of this dissertation, namely that Cape Corps soldiers- both Coloured enlisted and white officers- pulled together to form a powerful group identity in order to accomplish this goal. D...\n\nLast year was the centenary of the ANC; next year will mark twenty years since it came into office as the majority party in the Government of National Unity. Today much criticism of the ANC in government explains its failures by referring to its retention of an identity as a &quot;liberation movement&quot; and its inability to shed its struggle mindset. This makes it all the more important to know what the ANC did in the struggle and how attitudes dating from that struggle may still be current, such as the belief in the rightness of the cause, which usually means condemning those who did not work with it in the struggle, and in the responsibility of the &quot;movement&quot; to continue to exercise power, in order to pursue the goals of the struggle. This article considers three important contributions to the history of the ANC that appeared in the centenary years and places them in the context of other recent writing on the ANC. Verlede jaar was die eeufees-herdenking van die ANC en...\n\n“PW and Sons” was inspired by a somewhat cynical nickname that many conscript soldiers knew the South African army by. The name alluded to the then Prime Minister, Pieter Willem Botha, who was often regarded as the architect of their national service. The personal accounts contained in this books are by men who completed their national service within South Africa, primarily and who did not go to South West Africa or Angola during the border war, either because they serve too late to be posted there, or because the service was considered to be essential elsewhere. This is part of a series of books of personal accounts of South African Servicemen from 1966 – 1998. The more established books in the series are `Pro Patria’ originally published in 1995, and `Grensvegter?: South African Army Psychologist’ published in 1996 – both republished via Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing in 2021. The originals of `Pro Patria’ and `Grensvegter?’ have been cited in several articles by Gary Baines, Professor of History at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa.\n\nThis thesis is about understanding social change and the role of, and influence upon, agency in ‘making history’. In which an overview of the contemporary South African liberation struggle, and the first term of the African National Congress (ANC) government between 1994 and 1999, is juxtaposed with primary life history data of a group of former Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) activists, elected to government in 1994. It examines and analyses what their political participation means in practice and how this affects them and the inter-dependent interaction between individuals and the organisations of which they are members. The comprehension of these relationships, the basic ingredients of which are structural explanation and intentional understanding are situated in the debates around structure and agency and their inter-relationship. Drawing on ‘Marxist’ epistemology it shows how notions of class, conflict, exploitation etc facilitates an understanding of these relationships and the concomitant social relations. As agency and political ideas are an irreducible element of social change, these concepts, taken together with an historical outline of the ANC and the political beliefs that inform activists, aid our understanding of how structure and agency interacts and relates to activists experiences. Drawing on primary interviews, it also compares their experiences with that of more critical and contemporary COSATU activists, to establish if and how they differ and if the activists, turned politicians, have changed their views and ideas from those they were associated with before they went into government. In the process, it shows how these activists have come a long way in terms of what they have experienced and their political and ideological development – that in ‘making history’ they have changed in the process. It shows how they became organised and ideologically committed activists shaped to varying degrees by the mix of nationalist and socialist ideas and rhetoric, reflecting the politics of the ANC leadership and the constituent parts of its multi-class organisation, and how this continues to influence their political development.\n\nOne of the enduring historical mysteries of the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa is that of the disappearance of two Royal Air Force cadets during the Second World War. Eight Tshwa San (Bushmen) were arrested and tried for the murder of the flyers. The trial took place in the High Court of the Bechuanaland Protectorate (BP) in September to October, 1944, and resulted in a verdict of not guilty. Despite their exoneration, repercussions followed for the San. These included the resettlement of those who had been acquitted and their families, followed by the intentional displacement of hundreds of other Tshwa San from their traditional homelands in the Northern Crown Lands region of Bechuanaland. This paper explores the circumstances under which the RAF flyers disappeared and assesses the complex interactions among the San, the Bamangwato, and the British in 1943 and the years following. It also addresses the colonial perceptions, prejudices, and cultural misunderstandings that led to the large-scale displacement and the impacts of these events on Southern African peoples and states."
