        "text": "I. SUMMARY\n\nAlthough South Africa, since the first democratic elections in 1994, has made remarkable progress towards establishing a free and democratic society based on respect for the human rights of its own citizens, foreigners have largely failed to benefit from these developments and remain subject to serious abuse. Anti-foreigner feelings have also increased alarmingly. Politicians, the press, and the South African public commonly blame foreigners for exacerbating social problems such as rising crime, unemployment, or even the spread of diseases, and undocumented migrants have been subject to abuse by officials from the Department of Home Affairs, the police, and the army, as well as by the general public. In general, public attention has been focused on the allegedly socio-economic impact of migrants within South Africa, despite the absence of evidence to confirm these. In the process, attention has been diverted from the suffering and exploitation experienced by aliens as a result of official policies and xenophobic attitudes. This report seeks to document the experiences of foreigners in South Africa, including undocumented migrants, legal residents, asylum-seekers, and refugees, in order to add their voices to the debate on migration in South Africa. Human suffering should not be ignored in a country that only recently emerged from a system that degraded basic human rights and human dignity.[1]\n\nHuman Rights Watch conducted an investigation of the treatment of undocumented migrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees in South Africa in 1996 and 1997. During the course of our missions, we visited several areas of the country, including Johannesburg and Pretoria, the Northern Province and Mpumalanga border regions with Mozambique, and Cape Town. We interviewed foreign farm workers, migrants in detention, asylum-seekers, refugees, hawkers, repatriated Mozambicans, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), as well as officials from the Department of Home Affairs, the South African Police Service, the Department of Correctional Services, the South African National Defence Force, and the Mozambican Department of Labor. We visited a number of detention facilities, including the private Lindela detention facility in Krugersdorp; Pollsmoor, Pretoria Central, Johannesburg Central (Diepkloof), and Modderbee prisons; and a number of police stations. Our findings indicate pervasive and widespread abuse of migrants in South Africa.\n\nAbuses Against Undocumented Migrants in South Africa\n\nThe South African economy, especially its farming, mining, security, and construction sectors, relies heavily on the cheap and easily exploitable labor of undocumented migrants, mostly from Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland. Undocumented laborers on farms work for a pittance, on average about 5 rands [U.S. $ 1 at an exchange rate of five rands for one U.S. dollar] per day. Because of the illegal immigration status of their workers, farmers can exercise tremendous power over them. Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of child laborers, some as young as fourteen, and our research indicates that physical abuse of farm workers is common. Police rarely investigate or prosecute farmers for abuses, and in some instances contribute to the exploitation of farm workers by deporting them without pay on the request of farmers who have employed them. In one instance, Human Rights Watch interviewed three young farm laborers who described how they had been kept on a white-owned farm against their will, without any accommodation, and were regularly beaten to make them work harder. After two weeks, they were finally paid at the rate of 5 rand [U.S. $1] per day, only to have their money stolen by the foreman who then called the police to have the young laborers deported.\n\nSouth Africa has been deporting an increasing number of migrants each year since 1994, and reaching close to 200,000 people in 1997. Suspected undocumented migrants are identified by the authorities through unreliable means such as complexion, accent, or inoculation marks. We documented cases of persons who claimed they were arrested for being \"too black,\" having a foreign name, or in one case, walking \"like a Mozambican.\" Many of those arrested--up to twenty percent of the total in some areas by our calculation--are actually South African citizens or lawful residents, who often have to spend several days in detention while attempting to convince officials of their legitimate status.\n\nAssault and theft by officials during the arrest process seems disturbingly common. We interviewed several persons who claimed to have been beaten and robbed of valuables by members of the army or police and obtained evidence of several other such cases. In some urban areas, especially Johannesburg, police often suggested a \"fine\" or a bribe as an alternative to arrest and deportation. One person told Human Rights Watch how the police had volunteered to drive him to a bank automated teller machine (ATM) to withdraw the money for a bribe, while two others told us how they were forced to pay for a beer drinking party and to give the arresting officers additional \"beer money\" before being released.\n\nAfter arrest, suspected undocumented migrants are brought to a place of detention where they often wait for long periods before being deported. Human Rights Watch interviewed some people who had been unlawfully in detention for more than four months and documented a case in which a suspected undocumented migrant had been detained for more than a year. Migrants awaiting deportation are held at a private detention facility called Lindela, as well as at prisons, police stations, and army bases. Conditions of detention are usually far below internationally accepted minimum standards. Places of detention are often severely overcrowded, meals are insufficient, bedding was dirty and vermin-ridden, and detainees did not always have regular access to washing facilities. At Pollsmoor prison, migrants in detention often share cells with criminal suspects and are frequently robbed of their possessions and clothes by these criminal suspects.\n\nAt the private Lindela facility near Johannesburg, operated on behalf of the Department of Home Affairs by the Dyambu Trust, Human Rights Watch found numerous serious human rights abuses. Most troubling, we interviewed and photographed more than ten people who claimed to have been beaten by security personnel in three separate incidents in the week prior to our visit, and we obtained medical reports documenting their injuries. A young man from Lesotho had been brutally beaten over a period of several hours after complaining to security guards about the theft of his music tapes by security personnel. Although the Lindela management was aware of some of these incidents, no internal investigation appeared to have been instituted prior to our request for an investigation. The number of beds at Lindela was significantly lower than the average number of persons detained at the facility. Detainees also described many instances of corruption involving officials of the Department of Home Affairs at the facility and complained to Human Rights Watch about the quality of the food, the lack of phone access, and rude and violent behavior by the guards.\n\nRepatriation to their home country is the final chapter in the journey of most arrested undocumented migrants. In some areas, deportees were not allowed to gather their often substantial belongings before being deported, thus virtually guaranteeing that they would return again to South Africa. Several people told Human Rights Watch about their experiences on the twelve-hour train ride to Mozambique, where they were verbally and physically abused by police guards, and where a substantial bribe often provided a final opportunity to escape deportation by being allowed to jump from the moving train.\n\nAbuses Against Asylum-Seekers and Refugees\n\nSouth Africa only began to abide formally by international refugee law after signing a Basic Agreement with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1993. South Africa became a party to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and United Nations (U.N.) refugee conventions in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers in South Africa does not fully comply with international refugee law. There is no legislation implementing the South African government's obligations under these documents, so all refugee-handling procedures are governed by internal regulations of the Department of Home Affairs, leaving ample room for confusion and abuse of process. Human Rights Watch interviewed several asylum-seekers who had been in detention for up to three weeks at police stations, waiting for officials from the Department of Home Affairs to interview them. We discovered extensive corruption in the refugee determination process, with Home Affairs officials demanding bribes for the scheduling of interviews and for the granting of permits.\n\nIn addition to the impact of pervasive bribery and extortion, the refugee determination process is flawed in several respects. First, officials often make arbitrary, uninformed decisions that are inconsistent with the requirements of the U.N. and OAU conventions and guidelines for their implementation. Asylum-seekers from a number of African countries, including Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Malawi, appear to have their asylum applications turned down as a matter of course. Refugee applications are determined by a panel which does not itself hear the applicants. Until recently, applicants denied asylum were not furnished with reasons for the denial, a practice which has now been rectified. Denied asylum-seekers can only appeal to a one-person appeal board which appears not to provide a genuine review of the case.\n\nXenophobia and Abuse of Foreigners\n\nIn general, South Africa's public culture has become increasingly xenophobic, and politicians often make unsubstantiated and inflammatory statements that the \"deluge\" of migrants is responsible for the current crime wave, rising unemployment, or even the spread of diseases. As the unfounded perception that migrants are responsible for a variety of social ills grows, migrants have increasingly become the target of abuse at the hands of South African citizens, as well as members of the police, the army, and the Department of Home Affairs. Refugees and asylum-seekers with distinctive features from far-away countries are especially targeted for abuse.\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed a number of refugees and asylum-seekers who claimed to have been assaulted by police. In one case, a Ugandan refugee told us how she had been arrested and violently thrown into a police van, then subjected to vile language and rough handling as she was transferred from one police station in Cape Town to the other. A Nigerian refugee hawker in Cape Town showed us his wounds from a recent scuffle with the police, in which he was manhandled and verbally abused for insisting that a police officer who had asked him for his papers identify himself first.\n\nAt least one asylum-seeker, Jean-Pierre Kanyangwa of Burundi, has died after apparently being beaten in police custody. Kanyangwa was arrested by police in Cape Town at about 11 a.m. on June 2, 1997, and was brought to the Department of Home Affairs at about 2 p.m. the same day in a bad condition. He was suffering from stomach pains, had urinated in his pants, and reportedly told a fellow Burundian that he had been beaten by the police. The police sergeant who brought Kanyangwa to the offices of the Department of Home Affairs refused to take him to the hospital, saying it was now a refugee problem, and left. Kanyangwa died from a ruptured spleen on his way to the hospital. A murder docket into the case has been opened.\n\nForeign hawkers, often asylum applicants with temporary residence permits, have repeatedly been the targets of violent protests and other forms of intimidation as local hawkers attempt to \"clean the street of foreigners.\" During repeated violent protests in Johannesburg, South African traders and ordinary criminals have brutally beaten foreign hawkers, and stolen their goods. Hawkers interviewed by Human Rights Watch who were the targets of such abuse universally complained to us that the police had done little or nothing in response to their complaints. In many areas around Johannesburg, such as Kempton Park and Germiston, foreign hawkers have had to abandon their trade after repeated attacks and looting incidents in which the police failed in their duty under both international and domestic law to protect all persons. Human Rights Watch interviewed members of a large community of Somali asylum-seekers who had been forced to abandon their trade and who told Human Rights Watch that they now never left their overcrowded and impoverished compound unless they were in a large group, in order to protect themselves from attacks by hostile \"locals.\"\n\nA xenophobic climate in South Africa has resulted in increased harassment of migrants. Many people interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how they had been verbally abused by South Africans, and told to \"go home.\" In some cases, verbal abuse led to physical attacks. In the township of Alexandra near Johannesburg, for example, Malawian, Zimbabwean and Mozambican immigrants were physically assaulted over a period of several weeks in January 1995, as armed gangs identified suspected undocumented migrants and marched them to the police station in an attempt to \"clean\" the township of foreigners. Similar but less extensive incidents continue to occur regularly in South Africa, and foreigners have received little protection from the police and other institutions.\n\nThe Stalled Policy Debate\n\nThe Aliens Control Act which currently governs all aspects of migrants control in South Africa is an archaic piece of apartheid legislation, at odds with internationally accepted human rights norms and the South African constitution. South Africa still remains without legislation specifically covering refugee determination procedures. In order to remedy these deficiencies, the government appointed a task group to draft a \"Green Paper\" policy document as a first step in drafting new legislation.\n\nMany of the recommendations contained in the ensuing Green Paper on International Migration, finalized in May 1997, would help remedy the institutional and legislative deficiencies which are partly responsible for the human rights abuses discussed in this report. However, it appears that the reform process has stalled, and with the 1999 general elections appearing on the political horizon in South Africa, the window for migration and refugee legislative reform is rapidly closing. Without legislative reform, it will be difficult to address the problems and abuses existing under the current system, as many of these problems and abuses stem from fundamental deficiencies in the current legislation. In the meantime, without reform, Human Rights Watch fears that foreigners in South Africa will continue to suffer major and systematic human rights abuses.\n\nII. RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nRecommendations to the Government of South Africa\n\nHuman Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the South African government, to be implemented by all agencies involved in migration policy and its enforcement. In all its policy initiatives and official statements, the government should make it clear that all individuals in South Africa, regardless of their immigration status, are entitled to respect for their basic human rights. The government should take steps to ensure that all agencies involved in migration control in South Africa emphasize the promotion and protection of human rights in the fulfillment of their responsibilities to enforce South African immigration laws.\n\nGeneral\n\n-The government should immediately take steps to bring South African immigration law into line with internationally recognized human rights norms and the South African constitution, in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Draft Green Paper on International Migration.\n\n-Members of the government, including ministers, should publicly condemn harassment of or attacks on foreigners, and call for tolerance, understanding and respect for the human rights of all those living in South Africa.\n\n-South Africa should ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its protocols, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and bring domestic law and practice into conformity with these treaties.\n\n-South Africa should sign and ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and bring domestic law and practice into conformity with this treaty.\n\n-South Africa should sign and ratify the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Migration for Employment (Revised 1949, No. 97), and the ILO Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (1975, No. 143), and bring domestic law and practice into conformity with these treaties.\n\n-All efforts should be made to prevent practices of racial discrimination in the application of migration and refugee policy.\n\nRefugee Protection\n\n-The government should develop an independent process for refugee status determination. As proposed by the Green Paper on International Migration, refugee status determination should be the domain of an impartial and independent expert authority with a sound familiarity with the legal and empirical realities of human rights protection, insulated from political intervention.\n\n-Refugee legislation should provide in detail not only for the procedures for determining refugee status, but also for the substantive rights of refugees and asylum-seekers. The central purpose of such legislation should be to grant international protection to those who need it. Both procedural and substantive provisions of refugee legislation should be based on the U.N. and OAU refugee conventions and other international instruments as a minimum framework.\n\n-Refugee legislation should provide for determination of refugee status in accordance with the guidelines contained in the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, on the basis of a hearing at which the applicant is given an opportunity to make his or her case directly to the person or persons who will make the first instance decision whether or not to grant refugee status. In the event of rejection, reasons must be given and a reasonable period to prepare and file an appeal must be granted. Appeals should be heard by a properly constituted body, with independent status. The right to an interpreter, to submit documents in any language, to use legal representation and to present a case in person should all be specified.\n\n-Refugees in South Africa should have the right to identity and travel documents indicating their status; asylum seekers should also be given documentation indicating that an asylum application has been filed and that the holder may remain in the country pending determination of the application.\n\n-Refugee legislation should provide explicitly for the protection of unaccompanied minors, and should aim to respect as far as possible the principle of family unity in line with the recommendation of the Final Act of the conference that adopted the 1951 U.N. Convention, and should guarantee other rights provided in international human rights and refugee law and in South Africa's constitution.\n\n-South Africa should recognize the especially vulnerable position of women by explicitly including gender-based persecution, including sex-specific abuse, as grounds for granting asylum, and should adopt guidelines to assist asylum adjudicators to evaluate gender-related persecution.\n\n-Legislation should provide that asylum-seekers should in general not be detained, but if they are, detention should be only on the basis of the grounds contained in the UNHCR Guidelines on the Detention of Asylum Seekers. Detention of asylum-seekers should be subject to judicial approval and supervision. Detained asylum seekers should have the right to contact a legal representative and a family member or friend, and to be informed of that right and given the means to make such contact.\n\n-In accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention, the assimilation and naturalization of refugees should be facilitated. Those who have been settled in South Africa for a long time--including, for example, the Mozambicans in South Africa recognized as refugees on a group basis until December 31, 1996--should in particular be eligible for permanent residence status where possible.\n\nPreventing Abuse by Government Officials\n\n-The law should provide clear protections against arbitrary arrests, searches and seizures in the apprehension of undocumented migrants, including procedures to be followed by police and immigration officers: for example, rules should be drafted to determine when an individual may be stopped and asked for his or her identity documents and to ensure that individuals who do not have documentation with them are given an effective opportunity to produce it.\n\n-The government should take immediate steps to end the pervasive corruption in the handling of undocumented migrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees by the Department of Home Affairs, South African Police Service, South African National Defence Force, and other agencies.\n\n-Senior officials in each agency responsible for implementing migration policy should make it clear that abuse of undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees is inconsistent with South African and international law and will not be tolerated. All allegations of abuse by government officials should be investigated thoroughly, and the responsible officers should be brought to justice.\n\n-All uniformed police officers should be required to wear clearly visible and readable identification badges which state their name and an identification number. Officers requesting documents or detaining persons should be required to identify themselves by name, rank, and identification number when asked to do so.\n\n-Persons being repatriated should be allowed to retrieve their belongings in South Africa prior to repatriation. All efforts should be made to facilitate and ensure that persons being repatriated are able to return to their home countries with their possessions.\n\n-The border fence between South Africa and Mozambique should no longer be electrified, in light of the continuing reports of electricity-related injuries at the border fence.\n\n-Effective procedures should be established where they do not already exist, and publicized, to enable refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants, as well as South African citizens and residents, to file complaints, without fear of retaliation, against officials of the Department of Home Affairs, the South African Police Service, the South African National Defence Force, and all other agencies involved in migration control. Such complaint procedures should take into account the need for rapid determination of complaints if individuals are in the process of deportation, while also providing for an independent review of the process.\n\nDetention of Suspected Undocumented Migrants\n\n-All efforts should be made to minimize the period undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers spend in detention. In accordance with the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, undocumented migrants who are apprehended and held in custody must have \"an effective opportunity\" to have their case reviewed \"promptly\" by a judicial or other authority. Continued detention should be on the basis of specified conditions, and should be subject to periodic review and to a maximum time limit. The current practices, allowing for the judicially unsupervised detention of undocumented migrants for an initial period of thirty days, are inconsistent with international human rights standards and the provisions of the South African constitution.\n\n-Detention conditions for undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers should conform with international and domestic standards, including the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Body of Principles. In particular, undocumented migrants in detention and asylum-seekers are entitled to clean and adequate bedding, prompt access to medical treatment, adequate washing facilities, three meals a day at regular intervals, and, at a minimum, one hour of exercise per day.\n\n-Those who are held in custody simply pending deportation should be held in separate places of custody from criminal suspects or convicts. All efforts should be made to hold undocumented migrants in dedicated detention facilities, offering material conditions and a regime appropriate to their legal situation and staffed by suitably-qualified personnel.\n\n-Conditions in places of custody for deportees, whether in dedicated facilities, police cells, prisons or elsewhere, should be subject to inspection by an independent authority. Independent non-governmental organizations should also be allowed to inspect these facilities in order to ensure compliance with international and domestic standards.\n\n-Detainees who are foreigners should have the right to obtain their own legal representation, to contact a family member or friend, and to a state-provided interpreter in official interviews or hearings by state officials, and to be informed of these rights and given the means to make contact with a family member or friend.\n\n-Where undocumented migrants are held in places of custody operated by private bodies, such as the Lindela facility operated by Dyambu Trust, the government must ensure that such facilities are operated in accordance with international and domestic law. Delegation of the task of operating such facilities does not absolve government of ultimate responsibility for the acts done on its behalf, and procedures should be in place to ensure close government oversight.\n\n-In particular, clear rules of conduct and disciplinary rules for security guards at private facilities should be instituted, and all guards should be trained in appropriate disciplinary procedures and rules applying to the use of force. Any incidents involving the use of force by guards should be fully investigated and reported to the Department of Home Affairs and, where appropriate, the South African Police Service. The failure by security guards to report incidents involving the use of force should be an infraction subject to disciplinary proceedings.\n\n-The government should ensure that information is made available to undocumented migrants in custody setting out in clear and simple language their rights and the available avenues for redress if any of these rights are violated. This information should be translated into several languages commonly spoken by undocumented migrants, such as Shangaan, Shona, French and Portuguese, and should be prominently displayed at offices of the Department of Home Affairs, police stations, army offices, offices of the Internal Tracing Units, and all facilities used for the detention of undocumented migrants. In addition, contact information of organizations that can provide legal and other assistance should be displayed.\n\n-In order to prevent arbitrary expulsions, procedures should be put in place which allow migrants to appeal deportation orders. These appeal procedures should be easily accessible and should not significantly extend the period of time spent in detention. Migrants who have been issued with a deportation order should be informed of their right to appeal, and information explaining appeal procedures in clear and simple language should be easily available in several languages commonly spoken by undocumented migrants, such as Shangaan, Shona, French and Portuguese.\n\nProtection of Foreigners from Violence\n\n-The police, army and other security forces should develop and adopt specific policies for the protection of foreigners from violent attacks from whatever source, recognizing undocumented migrants as a particularly vulnerable group.\n\n-The police should investigate all incidents of assault or other offenses committed against foreigners. All persons are entitled to the protection of the police services on an equal basis, regardless of nationality.\n\nPreventing Exploitation of Migrant Labor\n\n-Integrated policies by different state authorities should be developed and implemented to end the abuse of undocumented migrants and use of coercive labor practices by employers: in particular, the immediate investigation of such allegations and the prosecution of employers who engage in such practices. All reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that employees are paid for work performed prior to their deportation.\n\nEducation and Training\n\n-Public officials interacting with refugees and undocumented migrants, including immigration officials and police with responsibilities in this area, should receive specific training relating to the rights of refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, and the human rights of all persons.\n\n-Public education campaigns should be devised and implemented directed at reducing xenophobia and increasing tolerance and respect for the human rights of asylum seekers, refugees and migrants generally.\n\nRecommendations to the State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy\n\n-The Human Rights Commission, the Commission for Gender Equality, and the Youth Commission should monitor the situation of undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees as especially vulnerable groups in South African society and should conduct campaigns to inform and educate the South African public about the rights of foreigners.\n\n-The Independent Complaints Directorate, responsible for investigation of complaints against the police, should pay special attention to complaints of police abuse against foreigners, and should take note of the particular vulnerability of those with irregular immigration status in investigating such allegations of abuse.\n\nRecommendations to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\n\n-UNHCR should continue to work closely with the South African government and concerned NGOs to ensure that respect for human rights is an integral part of the new refugee policy currently being developed and that the 1951 U.N. Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention are fully implemented.\n\n-UNHCR should continue to monitor, investigate, document, and make public any abuses committed against asylum seekers, refugees, and other migrants residing inside South Africa.\n\n-UNHCR should do all in its powers to facilitate access to asylum seeking procedures, including, where necessary, the development of sub-offices in key locations such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban.\n\n-UNHCR should all in its powers to ensure that asylum-seekers and refugees are given full documentation.\n\nRecommendations to the Southern African Development Community (SADC)\n\n-SADC should seek regional solutions to the problem of undocumented border crossings in the region, and encourage cooperation among member states in the area of migration policy.\n\n-SADC should also address the issue of refugee accommodation on a regional basis, and encourage burden sharing among member states in the area of refugee accommodation.\n\n-SADC should establish a permanent committee to monitor the treatment of undocumented persons, refugees, and asylum-seekers in the SADC member states, and make the treatment of migrants by member states a standing issue on the Community's agenda.\n\nIII. INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the apartheid era, the regime tried to implement its vision of an all-white South Africa by stripping \"African\"[2] South Africans of their South African citizenship and attempting to remove them to remote and desolate \"homelands.\"[3] To control the movement of non-white South Africans to its \"white\" cities, the apartheid state imposed a system called influx control, with a vast supporting bureaucracy. All Africans who traveled beyond the confines of their \"homeland\" were required to be in the possession of a pass, and inability to produce the pass on demand would lead to immediate arrest and deportation. Kader Asmal, a long-term human rights activist and the present Minister for Water Affairs and Forestry, described the impact of the pass law system in a recent book:\n\nThe laws restricting the right of Africans to free movement in their own country caused terrible suffering to many more than did the laws prohibiting interracial marriage and sex. The pass laws, restricting the physical movement of Africans to those areas endorsed in the pass books that they were required to carry, resulted in over 381,000 Africans being arrested in the year 1975-76, at the height of their use; and in over 12 million arrests over the period from 1948 to 1985.[4]\n\nThese laws exposed blacks to lives of humiliation and insecurity. Passes had to be produced upon the demand of any authorised official, a term that was defined to include any police officer and that, in practice, included any white who felt like harassing a black.[5]\n\nDr. A.B. Xuma, then president of the African National Congress (ANC), complained that \"flying squads, pick-up vans, troop-carriers, and mounted police are all abroad irritating and exasperating Africans by indiscriminately demanding passes [and] handling them in an insulting and humiliating way.\"[6] The movements and migrations between urban and rural areas, which were largely a response to the policy of creating homelands, defied the heavy-handed tactics of influx control and pass laws. They were finally abandoned in 1986.\n\nSouth Africa has made great strides in its efforts to establish a democratic, human rights centered society since the historic all-race elections of 1994. Yet for foreigners living in South Africa today, life continues to be fraught with difficulties disturbingly similar to those faced by black South Africans under the influx control system. South Africa has become increasingly xenophobic in recent years, with a large percentage of South Africans perceiving foreigners--especially, almost exclusively, black foreigners--as a direct threat to their future economic well-being and as responsible for the troubling rise in violent crime in South Africa. Foreign hawkers are routinely attacked on the street, and criminals seem to believe that they have the right to steal from foreigners. In certain townships such as Alexandra, near Johannesburg, the homes of migrants have been burned to the ground, and they have been told to leave the area or be targeted by violence.\n\nAlthough Human Rights Watch recognizes the right of the South African state to regulate the entry and movement of foreign nationals within its borders in line with international law, we are concerned about the methods used to achieve this end. During our investigation, we interviewed numerous people who alleged that they had been beaten by police, army, or detention facility officials, and who often showed clear signs of recent violence. At least one asylum-seeker has died apparently after being beaten by police officers while in custody. Detainees also often complained about having money or other possessions stolen by officials when they were taken into custody. We received many allegations of bribery and corruption of police officers and home affairs officials.\n\nIn many detention facilities for undocumented migrants, Human Rights Watch found the conditions deplorable. Most were severely overcrowded. Some were lice-infested, unhygienic, smelly, and very dark and dank. At Pollsmoor, detainees received only two meals per day and had to wait for seventeen hours after their dinner at 3 p.m. until their morning meal at 8 a.m. Migrants were often arrested and brought to the detention facility with only the clothes on their back and were thus forced to remain in detention for long periods of time with only one set of clothes. Some of the persons interviewed by Human Rights Watch had been in detention for more than three months without money or a change of clothes. At Lindela, several inmates claimed they had been assaulted by security personnel and bore the marks of recent beatings. At Pollsmoor prison, detainees alleged that they had many of their possessions stolen by the criminal suspects with whom they were forced to share cells when they first arrived at the prison.\n\nMany of the migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch expressed a deep disappointment with the way they had been treated by the South African authorities, and by the South African public in general. One Nigerian refugee contrasted his own treatment at the hands of the South African police and the South African public with the way South African exiles where received in African countries during the apartheid struggle:\n\nWhen I was young, we always talked about our brothers in South Africa and that we wanted them to be free. If a South African came to Nigeria, we welcomed him as a brother. The local people must learn about us.[7]\n\nBenneth Mabaso, who claimed to be South African and alleged that his ID book had been destroyed by the South African police the week before our visit because he had a Mozambican inoculation mark, complained that,\n\nWe are still treated like under the apartheid system, always asking for our pass even though we are South Africans. Pass, pass, pass. It is still the same. It is very sad.[8]\n\nIndeed, troubling similarities exist between the old apartheid pass law enforcement system and the current migrants control system. Pass law violations were the most common criminal charge during the operation of the influx control system. Today, arrests for violations of the Aliens Control Act clearly outstrip all other arrests. In 1997, the Department of Home Affairs \"repatriated\" 176,351 \"illegal aliens,\" a startling average of 485 per day. The same institutional structures once responsible for enforcing influx control laws--including the Department of Home Affairs, the police, and the army--now enforce the system of migrants control. Most disturbingly, the heavy-handed tactics associated with influx control continue to be used to control migrants. Finally, despite the heavy-handedness and systematic abuses, the system of migrants control is as ineffective in controlling migration as influx control was in controlling the movement of black South Africans.\n\nThe new South Africa has seen a marked increase in the profile of migration related issues in the mass media. Much of this coverage is uninformed and perpetuates untested assumptions about the negative impact of migrants on the economy and on crime and drug abuse levels. There is little coverage of the systematic abuse of human rights in the implementation of the aliens control system, nor is there informed coverage of the underlying issues of labor exploitation which the current system clearly perpetuates. This report aims to redress one of these imbalances, and focuses on the systematic abuse of migrants at all stages of the aliens control system. South Africa has pledged itself to the creation and nurturing of a vibrant democratic society committed to a culture of human rights. In his inauguration speech, President Nelson Mandela pledged that \"never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another .\"[9] In the treatment of migrants within its borders, South Africa has a long way to go to make this promise a reality.\n\nMigration to South Africa Today\n\nEstimating the total number of migrants currently residing in South Africa is a difficult task. Recent estimates have shown a distinct upwards trend, as Professor Jonathan Crush explains in a recent study:\n\nThe numbers involved are a source of considerable controversy within South Africa, with wildly variable estimates being thrown around. Before 1994, most estimates of the total number of undocumented aliens were below two million (although even the basis of that figure is unclear). By late 1994, police were citing figures of eight million in total and 700,000 Mozambicans. This was hardly surprising; since those seeking more resources for policing were always likely to exaggerate the figures. More alarming was the pseudo-scientific justification for these kind of numbers. The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) conducted a methodologically suspect survey in 1994-95 and concluded that there were 9.5 million non-South Africans (not necessarily all undocumented) in the country.... In their latest unpublished report, the HSRC raises their estimate to as many as twelve million. These kinds of figures are waved around by the press, certain politicians and some commentators. Mathias Brunk has critically reviewed the figures and rightly concludes that \"we have too little knowledge to justify any precise estimates or assumptions.\"[10]\n\nDespite the unreliability of the popular estimates of the number of undocumented migrants in South Africa, certain public officials continue to invoke the highest estimates in order to suggest a state of crisis with regard to the presence of migrants into South Africa. For example, in his first introductory speech to Parliament, Minister of Home Affairs Mangosutho Buthelezi stated that \"if we as South Africans are going to compete for scarce resources with millions of aliens who are pouring into South Africa, then we can bid goodbye to our Reconstruction and Development Programme.\"[11]\n\nMost likely, the total number of undocumented or \"illegal\" migrants is significantly smaller than the alarmist numbers being tossed around by politicians and the media in South Africa. The lack of reliable data makes it impossible to put a precise figure on the number of undocumented migrants in South Africa, since by definition they are not officially recorded, but an educated guess would place the number somewhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million, significantly lower than the figures commonly quoted by the media and politicians.[12] Refugees and asylum-seekers are more easy to count, as most of them have approached the Department of Home Affairs for documentation. In January 1998, South Africa had received 38,143 asylum applications.[13]\n\nIt is clear, however, that South Africa is deporting a much larger number of undocumented migrants today than ever before. The number of deportations has steadily grown from 44,225 in 1988, to 96,600 in 1993, to 180,713 in 1996.[14] The vast majority of these repatriations, 99.5 percent in 1995, were of citizens of the neighboring Southern African Development Community countries. In 1995, Mozambicans alone accounted for 131,689 of the 157,084 persons repatriated, and Zimbabweans were the second largest group, with 17,548 deportations. Other countries with a significant number of repatriations in 1995 were Lesotho (4,073), Malawi (1,154), Swaziland (837), and Tanzania (836). Although figures for 1997 show a slight decline in numbers deported, they remain high: South Africa deported 176,351 persons in 1997, including 146,285 Mozambicans and 21,673 Zimbabweans.[15]\n\nIt is unclear whether this quadrupling of deportations in less than a decade is a result of a stepped-up campaign to identify, arrest, and deport migrants, or instead reflects a similar absolute rise in the total number of undocumented migrants in South Africa. Some of the deportees interviewed by Human Rights Watch felt that there had been a definite increase in the efforts to trace, arrest, and deport undocumented migrants from South Africa. When asked if Mozambicans were also deported by the previous government, one recent Mozambican deportee responded:\n\nThey were, but not the way it is happening now. Before, you could work for a year without having these problems. Now things are difficult. They arrest many people. You can't work for three weeks without getting arrested. If you have bad luck, you won't complete two days. Sometimes, they come and arrest you the day before pay-day, and you lose your money.[16]\n\nMany migrants who are deported, especially those deported to neighboring countries, return almost immediately to South Africa. For some undocumented workers from these countries, arrest and deportation is a relatively routine, albeit unpleasant, part of working and residing in South Africa. Police and army officials repeatedly told Human Rights Watch about migrants whom they had arrested and deported dozens of times, and many of the persons interviewed by us had been previously deported--and frequently told us that they would return again to South Africa. Thus, deportation statistics are not a reliable method to estimate the total population of undocumented migrants in South Africa, since the same person is often counted multiple times. The creation of fourteen Internal Tracing Units within the South African Police Service since 1994, and the increasingly visible role of the South African Defence National Force in migrants control suggests that the rise in repatriations is at least partly related to a rise in aggressive enforcement of immigration control laws.\n\nBrief History of Migration to South Africa\n\nLabor Migration to South Africa\n\nSouth Africa has for well over a century been the center of an extensive system of labor migration in the southern African region. Foreign mine workers have traditionally made up at least forty percent of the South African mine labor force, and in the 1960s foreigners represented eighty percent of mine workers.[17] Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland have historically provided the bulk of the mine labor, with Zimbabwe and Malawi providing smaller numbers. Work on the mines is one of the most important employment opportunities available to citizens of the main source countries, and these countries depend heavily on the income produced which returns to the home country through a system of mandatory remittances. For example, a 1995 World Bank study commented on the importance of mine work to Lesotho's economy:\n\nMost important is Lesotho's export of human capital to South Africa, hence, its reputation as a labor pool for South Africa's mines. The 1986 census found that nearly half of Lesotho's adult male workers were employed in South Africa. In the 1980s, remittances from Basotho laborers working in South Africa accounted for about half of country's gross national product (GNP), and equaled 100% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Today, about 40 % of the Basotho male labor force is employed in South Africa, and remittances account for a third of GNP.[18]\n\nHistorically, this migration system was regulated through a highly formalized system of bilateral contracts with neighboring countries for the purpose of supplying labor to the mines and for the large farms. These bilateral intergovernmental treaties regulated the terms of employment and conditions of access to the South African labor market, including recruitment procedures, wages, mandatory remittance procedures, and the appointment of labor officials to oversee and protect the interests of the foreign workers.[19] The entire process was implemented by the privately run Employment Bureau of Africa (TEBA) which has historically monopolized mine recruitment in Southern Africa.\n\nThe post-apartheid government inherited a series of bilateral labor agreements with the governments of Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, and Malawi.[20] Foreign mine workers continue to be a large component of mine labor--currently estimated at about 200,000 persons or 50 percent of all mine workers--but the South African transition is having a major impact on the bilateral treaty system. The South African Department of Labor has proposed abolishing the bilateral labor agreement system, arguing that the treaties \"do not conform in many respects to ILO norms and standards, that they are not uniform and that they are outmoded.\"[21] The South African government announced an amnesty in 1995 aimed at offering permanent residence status to foreign mine workers who had been in the country since 1986 and a significant number of foreign mine workers accepted this offer. An increasing number of foreign miners are being recruited through a sub-contracting system, a process that classifies them as temporary workers and exempts them from union wage agreements, death and benefit schemes, and retirement saving schemes.[22] Sub-contracting takes place both through the TEBA-administered system and through the direct recruitment of undocumented workers within South Africa. Improved working conditions on the mines have attracted an increasing number of South Africans to the industry, while at the same time the overall number of jobs available on the mines has declined, leading to heightened tensions between local and foreign miners and contributing to the outbreak of violence on some mines.\n\nSouth Africa has had similar arrangements in place to regulate the employment of undocumented workers on South African farms. In the case of Mozambique, a labor office in Nelspruit and a recruitment office in Ressano Garcia aid South African farmers to obtain the required documents from the Department of Home Affairs for the recruitment of Mozambican labor. However, the ready availability of undocumented migrant farm workers prompts many farmers to flout the official recruitment procedures. Officially, a farmer is supposed to apply for a permit from the Department of Home Affairs which allows him legally to recruit a number of foreign farm workers, after a determination by the Department of Home Affairs that he cannot find adequate local labor. The undocumented migrants--most often, the farmer just recruits among the undocumented migrants already present in the region--then receive temporary work permits that legalize their status. In reality, many farmers never apply for the permit, partly because of the complex and time-consuming process and partly because an illegal worker is unlikely to approach the authorities about abuse because of fear of deportation. Even where a farmer has legalized his workers, the employee rarely benefits. In many cases, the farmer will keep the documents conferring legal status from the employee, thereby effectively forcing the employee to stay on the grounds of the farm because he could otherwise be apprehended and deported.\n\nThe Destabilization of the Frontline States[23] by the Apartheid Regime\n\nOne of the main causes of migration between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) states and South Africa is the high level of economic disparity in the region. For example, South Africa's per capita GNP is thirty-five times greater than that of neighboring Mozambique.[24] For some citizens of poor neighboring states, labor migration to South Africa is the most promising means of overcoming economic deprivation and ensuring the continued survival of the household in Mozambique. Army officials told us how Mozambican children would sometimes cross the border solely to beg for food from the soldiers. The importance of this economic disparity in fueling migration is demonstrated by the comparatively low level of migration to South Africa from its neighbor Botswana, a country which has per capita income levels comparable to those of South Africa.\n\nThe causes of Southern Africa's economic stagnation are complex, and are at least partly caused by economic mismanagement and the pursuit of misguided economic policies in the region. The apartheid state's campaign to destabilize its neighbors is also an important contributing factor. As neighboring states became independent in the 1960s and 1970s, they became increasingly vocal in their opposition to apartheid policies in South Africa and assisted anti-apartheid organizations within their borders. In response, the increasingly militaristic government in South Africa, led by then-State President P. W. Botha, announced in 1978 that it would pursue a \"total strategy\" against the \"total onslaught\" of its opponents.[25] Over the next decade, South Africa launched a major campaign aimed at destabilizing its critics in the region.\n\nA complete reckoning of the impact of the destabilization campaign launched by the apartheid state is beyond the subject area of the current report. South Africa occupied Namibia until 1990, in the face of international condemnation by the U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Security Council, and the International Court of Justice. South Africa backed the rebel groups National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UniÃo Nacional para a IndependÊncia Total de Angola, UNITA) in Angola and Mozambique National Resistance (ResistÊncia Nacional MoÇambicana, RENAMO) in Mozambique. When UNITA came close to defeat, the South African Defence Force (SADF, now renamed the South African National Defence Force, SANDF) repeatedly intervened directly in Angola, as for example in 1981 when an estimated 10,000 SADF troops invaded Cunene Province of Angola. Decades of South African-sponsored conflict in Angola and Mozambique led to an almost complete destruction of transportation systems, educational institutions, agricultural production, safe water facilities, and the entire economic base of these countries. In 1982, South African forces invaded the Lesotho capital of Maseru in search of anti-apartheid guerrillas, killing twelve Basotho and thirty South Africans in the process. A similar attack in Gaborone, Botswana, in June 1985 left twelve people dead.[26]\n\nSouth Africa played an extensive role in supporting the rebel group RENAMO, thereby fueling armed conflict in Mozambique, source of the majority of undocumented migrants currently in South Africa. RENAMO received extensive support from the apartheid state. As Zimbabwe gained independence on April 18, 1980, the rear bases of RENAMO were transferred from Zimbabwe to new bases in the South African lowveld, especially Phalaborwa in the Northern Transvaal.[27] As discussed in an earlier report by Human Rights Watch on human rights abuses in Mozambique:\n\nThe transfer marked a turning point in the war, which, instead of dying down, soon began to escalate. The South African government used RENAMO as a tool for destabilizing Mozambique and as a bargaining counter against [President] Machel's support for the African National Congress (ANC); its aims were disabling Mozambique's infrastructure, bringing FRELIMO [Frente de Libertação de Moçambique, Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, the ruling party] to the bargaining table, and ultimately overthrowing FRELIMO and replacing it with a more amenable government.[28]\n\nRENAMO's tactics soon earned the rebel movement a well-deserved reputation for savagery. RENAMO rebels often targeted civilian populations and were feared for their policy of mutilating civilians, including children, by \"cutting off ears, noses, lips, and sexual organs.\"[29] In addition, RENAMO destroyed almost the entire infrastructure of Mozambique, in a calculated campaign targeting transport links, health clinics, and schools. Between 1980 and 1988, RENAMO destroyed an estimated 1,800 schools, 720 health clinics, and 1,300 buses and trucks.[30] Roy A. Stacey, a U.S. Deputy Assistant of State for African Affairs, responded to reports of RENAMO abuses in unequivocal tones which are worth repeating when assessing South Africa's responsibility for RENAMO abuses:\n\nWhat has emerged in Mozambique is one of the most brutal holocausts against ordinary human beings since World War II.... The supporters of RENAMO, wherever they may be, cannot wash the blood from their hands unless all support for the unconscionable violence is halted immediately.... RENAMO is waging a war of terror against innocent Mozambican civilians through forced labor, starvation, physical abuse and wanton killings.[31]\n\nThe destruction of Angola's infrastructure followed similar lines. However, instead of relying solely on support for the rebel group UNITA, South Africa also conducted an extensive direct military campaign in Angola, involving thousands of troops. As described in an earlier Human Rights Watch report, \"Through this war and extensive economic sabotage and widespread guerrilla warfare, UNITA and South Africa continue to devastate the country even further. Physical damages were estimated by the United Nations Security Council Commission as U.S. $ 17.6 billion between 1975 and 1985, the first ten years of independence.\"[32]\n\nAs post-apartheid revelations are making increasingly clear, the apartheid state carried out many more such destructive acts, overtly and covertly, in the region in order to bring its opponents into submission. One of its strongest tools was the economic embargo, especially against the landlocked states of Swaziland, Lesotho, and Botswana, which were heavily dependent on South African transport routes. One of the favorite targets of the destabilization campaign were the transport routes and oil supply lines in the region, which effectively disrupted any economic activity in the SADC states. A 1989 United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report estimated that the South African destabilization campaign claimed 1.3 million lives and resulted in an economic loss to the SADC states estimated at U.S. $60 billion,[33] an estimate echoed by President Nelson Mandela who has put the loss of life at 2 million and the economic cost to the region at U.S. $62 billion.[34]\n\nAlthough the past destabilization campaign features little in the public debate on migration today, some politicians have referred to this history and the questions of equity it raises, arguing that South Africa has a duty to redress the suffering it caused in the region with its past policies. Minister of Water Affairs Kader Asmal expressed such sentiments in a recent book:\n\nThe front line states, which became the flashpoint of the civilised world's revulsion against apartheid, bore an involuntarily large share of the costs of the global resistance. It is something we must not forget in current debates over regional cooperation--and when faced with xenophobic calls for the expulsion or demonisation of \"illegal aliens\" from next door. The culpability of the old South Africa, its continuing responsibility for ongoing suffering on our cross-border door step, cannot be so easily evaded.[35]\n\nMpumalanga premier Matthews Phosa has expressed similar sentiments, urging a regional approach to the migration issue which takes into account the negative impact of apartheid on the region.[36]\n\nThe Repatriation of Mozambican Refugees\n\nAs the South-African sponsored RENAMO-FRELIMO conflict in Mozambique began to escalate in 1984, significant numbers of Mozambicans fled the fierce fighting and sought refuge in the Gazankulu and KaNgwane homelands of South Africa. To make it to relative safety in South Africa, Mozambican refugees had to pass through an electric fence capable of carrying lethal voltages, and often spent four or five days walking across the Kruger Park, a huge game reserve along the Mozambican border, avoiding dangerous animals as well as border patrols. Many people died while attempting to cross the fence between 1986 and 1990, when the border fence carried a lethal current of 3,300 volts and 1,000 amps.[37] The refugees were never formally recognized by South Africa. Although the government did reach an agreement with the Gazankulu and KaNgwane homelands to house the refugees, this agreement restricted the refugees to the homelands.[38] By 1990, it was estimated that as many as 350,000 Mozambican refugees were living in the nominally independent homelands.[39]\n\nThe refusal of the South African government to recognize the Mozambicans as refugees prevented international agencies such as UNHCR from providing urgently needed services to them and exacerbated bad living conditions and lack of employment opportunities.[40] The refugees were not issued any identification documents by the South African government and were frequently arrested if they moved outside designated areas. Their uncertain status, the lack of government protection, and the lack of relief efforts made the desperate refugees easy targets for economic exploitation by farmers in the region.[41] The lack of documentation, in particular, still causes problems today.\n\nThe office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had attempted to reach an agreement with the South African government about the status of the Mozambican refugees since as early as 1985, but was repeatedly rebuffed by the apartheid government.[42] Following the peace accord between RENAMO and FRELIMO in Rome in 1992, the South African government signed a Basic Agreement with UNHCR on September 6, 1993, followed by a Tripartite Agreement between South Africa, Mozambique, and UNHCR on September 15, 1993, under which the South African government belatedly granted \"group refugee status\" to the Mozambican population. Even then, identity documents were never issued to the refugees, so that their freedom of movement and to seek employment continued to be restricted to the homeland areas, even after they were formally abolished in 1994.[43]\n\nFollowing the Tripartite Agreement, UNHCR began the implementation of a voluntary repatriation program for Mozambican refugees, aiming to resettle 240,000 Mozambican refugees over the following two years.[44] Judged by its initial goals, the voluntary repatriation program was a failure:\n\nBy the end of the repatriation in April 1995 the total number of people returned under the organised repatriation was 31,589, while the total returns to Mozambique from South Africa stood at 67,060 in December 1995, suggesting that UNHCR/IOM [International Organization for Migration] assisted less than half of those who wished to repatriate from South Africa. By contrast, an astonishing 80,926 Mozambicans were forcibly deported by the South African National Defence Forces and South African Police in 1993 alone, followed by 71,279 in 1994, despite the fact that the Government's official position was that \"The voluntary character of the repatriation operation would be adhered to until the Cessation clause was invoked, after which the residual caseload would be dealt with in terms of the Aliens Control Act.\"[45]\n\nIn May 1996, a meeting of the Tripartite commission between the governments of Mozambique and South Africa and the UNHCR resolved that: \"In view of the peace and stability which have returned to Mozambique and the fundamental and sustained change that has taken place, Mozambican refugees will not have refugee status after 31 December 1996. ... The status of Mozambicans who elect to remain in South Africa after 31 December 1996 will be determined according to accepted international principles and the applicable South African laws.\"[46]\n\nThe SADC Amnesty\n\nIn early 1996, the South African cabinet agreed to grant a limited amnesty to nationals of Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. According to the conditions announced by Minister of Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi on June 4, 1996 and additional conditions contained in internal Department of Home Affairs guidelines, citizens of the SADC countries would be granted permanent residence if they could prove they had continuously lived in South Africa since at least July 1, 1991, had no criminal record, and were either economically active or married to a South African, or had dependent children who were born or were residing lawfully in South Africa.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs had originally stated that out of an estimated two to four million undocumented migrants, they expected \"about one million of them to qualify for permanent residence in terms of the recent cabinet decision in this regard.\"[47] Minister Buthelezi stressed later that the amnesty should not be seen as a relaxing of immigration controls:\n\nSouth Africa has extended a gesture of goodwill to its neighbouring countries by granting these exemptions. This gesture should not be construed as a softening of our approach to illegal immigrants. To the contrary, it provides the moral high ground, after a period of discrimination, to deal with the problem stricter according to the Aliens Control Act.[48]\n\nIn light of the expectations of the cabinet and the Department of Home Affairs, the SADC amnesty proved a failure. Only 124,073 persons were granted permanent residence, out of a total of 201,602 applications, while 77,108 persons were rejected.[49] Another 50,692 migrant workers were granted permanent residence under a separate amnesty previously announced by the Department of Home Affairs after discussions with the National Union of Mineworkers, bringing the total to about 175,000, still far short of the expected one million.[50]\n\nThe reasons for the low take-up of the SADC amnesty are complex, but include a general lack of access to information among the target population due to poverty and illiteracy, costs associated with applications, fear of detection, as well as corruption within the application process. Many Mozambicans live in rural areas and illiteracy rates are high, so news of the amnesty only reached many eligible persons during its final weeks. Others were afraid that the information obtained by the Department of Home Affairs would be used to deport them if their application was turned down, a fear which seems to have been justified. Human Rights Watch interviewed three rejected applicants who received instead seven-day permits and were told they had to leave the country within this period.[51] Repeated visits--first to apply, then to check criminal records, again to bring supporting documents and to check on the progress of the application--to often far-away Home Affairs offices also placed the process beyond the reach of many families, who found the cost of taxi fare and loss of work hours too expensive.\n\nOne of the major impediments to an effective amnesty process was the petty corruption that accompanied it. According to Refugee Research Project coordinator Nicola Johnston,\n\nIt was too expensive for many to travel to the local Home Affairs office to make the applications. There were also hidden costs of corruption, which made it difficult for them. Headmen, for example, were charging about nineteen rands [U.S. $ 3.80] for a referral letter stating how long the person had been in the country, clerks were demanding six rands [U.S. $ 1.20] to take fingerprints, and people were having to pay twenty rands [U.S. $ 4.00] to clerks to speed up their applications.[52]\n\nTribal authorities were often called upon to write a referral letter to prove the applicant's length of stay in the area, and used this opportunity to ask for a \"fee,\" sometimes referred to as \"chief's money,\" ranging between ten and ninety rands [U.S. $ 2-18]. One applicant stated that \"the Tribal Authority refers us to the chief to fetch a referral letter, and the referral letter costs ninety rand [U.S. $ 18].\"[53] Another applicant told of a similar experience, stating that,\n\nwe knew about the amnesty, it has been broadcast over the radio. The problem is that the Tribal Office wants a sum of twenty rands [U.S. $ 4], to give you a referral letter, proving that you are a resident of New Forest. So you are supposed to take that letter to Thulamahashe to apply for amnesty. So the money we are spending for amnesty is thirty-five rands [U.S. $ 7], because at Thulamahashe we are supposed to pay fifteen rands [U.S. $ 3] for photos.[54]\n\nWomen in particular had a difficult time applying for the amnesty, especially in rural areas. The application model envisioned a principal applicant filling out the form for an entire family, but this was complicated by the fact that many eligible women live in remote rural areas while their husbands work in urban areas. In the traditional culture, men are regarded as the head of the household and wives have to seek permission from their husbands before taking a significant step such as applying for amnesty. In the words of one Mozambican woman, \"I am married and could not do anything without the permission of my husband.\"[55] This strong male bias was reinforced by Home Affairs officials, who often told unaccompanied women applicants to return and apply with their husbands if married:\n\nOn my first day, they told me to come with a letter from the tribal office, and I did as I was told. Then the following day I came with that letter, and they said to me that I must come with my husband. I don't know where to find him, because he is not here. He is at his work place. He left here a long time ago. He has been away for more than a year now, and I have not heard from him. So how am I supposed to go there with him, when I don't know where he is? This is really frustrating. When we heard that we must go and apply for ID books, we thought that everybody was encouraged to do so, only to find that it is really difficult for women.... I have already lost courage of getting there again. I will not go there anymore. Maybe if my husband was here, I would have applied already.[56]\n\nAmnesty applicants who were denied were told they could appeal these decisions within thirty days but were often not furnished with reasons for their denial, making it very difficult to offer an effective appeal against a negative decision. Because of these and other problems, many eligible candidates for permanent residence status did not apply for the SADC amnesty and continue to live in South Africa while classified as \"illegal.\" This is particularly unfortunate as the SADC amnesty was seen as a rectification of the injustices of the apartheid period, when black immigrants simply were ineligible for permanent residence status due to racist legislation.\n\nAccording to the Department of Home Affairs and the Chair of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Desmond Lockey M.P., the cabinet has approved an additional amnesty which will focus exclusively on former Mozambican refugees still living in South Africa.[57] This additional amnesty grows out of the Tripartite Agreement between South Africa, Mozambique, and UNHCR on the repatriation of the Mozambican refugees, which resolved that \"The Status of Mozambicans who elect to remain in South Africa after 31 December 1996, will be determined according to accepted international principles and applicable South African laws.\"[58] It presumably represents a recognition that many \"Mozambicans\" who fled their country during its civil war have in fact been in South Africa for a decade or more, or have grown up in South Africa, and have never had their status satisfactorily regularized, despite the Tripartite Agreement between the South African and Mozambican governments and UNHCR. Although this decision was taken by the cabinet in the middle of 1997, the Department of Home Affairs is continuing to work out the actual procedure that will be followed to determine the status of applicants. According to Mr. Schravesande of the Department of Home Affairs, the procedure is complicated by the fact that South Africa never recognized the status of the refugees, and the refugees were thus never registered or issued with documents which could now be used to prove their past status. Human Rights Watch hopes that some of the deficiencies of the previous amnesty process will be addressed and remedied by the Mozambican refugee amnesty process.\n\nIV. THE TREATMENT OF UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\nLabor Exploitation\n\nUndocumented migrants are employed in a variety of sectors of the South African economy, and form one of the most exploited and vulnerable groups of workers in the country. Because of their illegal status, undocumented migrants are compelled to \"accept employment whatever the payment, risk, physical demand or working hours involved.\"[59] Undocumented migrants from Mozambique and Zimbabwe are especially prevalent in the farm sector in Mpumalanga and Northern provinces, and also in the construction sector in Johannesburg.\n\nThe undocumented and thus \"illegal\" status of many Mozambicans prevents them from approaching the authorities for redress of grievances and gives employers tremendous power over their workers. Human Rights Watch discovered several cases in which employers laid off workers at the end of a work period without paying them their earned wage. In one case, workers at a farm near Pretoria were told to \"take a day off\" two days before the end of their first work month, only to find the gate locked when they returned and a new team of illegal workers employed in their place. They were told to leave the premises or face arrest. According to the gate-keeper at the compound, the newly hired workers faced the same fate at the end of their first month.[60] In the wealthy Parktown suburb of Johannesburg, a Mozambican gardener who complained to his white employer about not having been paid for the past two months promptly found himself reported to the police, arrested, and deported.[61]\n\nAbuses committed by white farmers and their foremen against undocumented migrants appear to be especially common and severe. Undocumented migrants working as farm workers are among the lowest paid workers in the country, earning on average as little as five to ten rands [U.S. $ 1-2] per day. For example, Sylvester Langa, a farm worker interviewed while awaiting deportation at Komatipoort police station, told us he earned 250 rands [U.S. $ 50] per month working on a farm.[62] Local farm workers, although also subject to many abuses, earn significantly more, about 800 to 1,000 rands [U.S. $ 160-200] per month.[63] Similar abuses exist in other trades as well, especially in the building trade. Lodric Ndlovu, who was earning twenty rands [U.S. $ 4] per day working in the construction industry, told Human Rights Watch that at his previous job, he was paid eight rands [U.S. $ 1.60] per completed structure, a task which often took longer than one week.[64] Undocumented migrants are forced to work very long hours and are abused by foremen and security personnel. Mr. Ngobeni, a Mozambican farm worker who told us he earned five rands [U.S. $ 1] per day, complained that he and other workers were often beaten to make them work harder: \"We must always run when we work, even when carrying boxes of bananas. The foremen slapped me hard because they said I wasn't working hard enough.\"[65] In the words of Captain Liebenberg, Superintendent of Komatipoort police station,\n\nThis poor guy from Mozambique, he will do anything just to get those few bucks to get on with life. He will take any abuse. The salaries on the farms are very low--a lorry driver gets fifteen rands [U.S. $ 3] a day, but normally the workers get between five rands [U.S. $ 1] and ten rands [U.S. $ 2] a day. And 95 percent are Mozambican.[66]\n\nCaptain Chilembe, head of the Internal Tracing Unit at Nelspruit, also described physical abuse of farm workers by farmers as \"common.\"[67]\n\nMany of the illegal immigrants working in the rural areas adjoining the Mozambican border are children, some as young as ten years old. Human Rights Watch interviewed a group of farm workers near Chongwe, Mpumalanga, including children as young as fourteen, but was forced to cut the interview short when a security guard approached us and asked us to leave.[68] An investigation into child labor by the Mail & Guardian newspaper found similar instances of child labor, including two boys, aged fifteen and sixteen, who were working twelve hours per day for a primary school teacher, earning only 150 rands [U.S. $ 30] per month.[69]\n\nAlthough the Aliens Control Act provides for a mechanism to prosecute and fine employers in the amount of 20,000 rands [U.S. $ 4,000] per \"illegal alien,\" Human Rights Watch found evidence of very few such prosecutions. According to one source,\n\nVery few farmers employing illegal aliens have been brought to court in the Mpumalanga province. In the last four years only six employers have been charged in the courts at Nelspruit, while only two received fines. One of the problems in prosecuting them has been the difficulty of proving that an illegal alien is employed on the farm, since a farmer's books merely show a cash entry under \"wages.\"[70]\n\nDuring our three-week investigation, Human Rights Watch was told of only a single prosecution of an employer of undocumented migrants, involving a contractor and his recruitment agent for employing about forty-five undocumented migrants on a building site. The undocumented workers from Mozambique were kept in detention for two months at Pollsmoor prison in order to be available to testify at the trial.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, it was a common practice of South African farmers to hire a group of undocumented migrants, make them work for a certain period of time (normally one or two months), and then call the local police station to have the farm workers deported without pay. Local police stations often were complicit in these practices, and rarely asked any questions of farmers who reported undocumented migrants for deportation. Although the practice appears less common today, our interviews suggest that such collaboration between local police stations and farmers continues in some areas. One farm worker who had opted to remain in Mozambique after suffering abuses on South African farms told us that at one farm he worked on, \"at the end of the month, they sent a truck to pick us all up, and our wages were kept by the boss.\"[71]\n\nCaptain Chilembe, head of the Internal Tracing Unit in Nelspruit, in the heart of the South African farming area, ensured Human Rights Watch that police stations had been instructed to investigate farmers who reported undocumented migrants in order to ensure that the farmer was not trying to avoid paying his workers by having them deported.[72] However, when we visited the Komatipoort police station, we interviewed three young Mozambicans, aged between sixteen and eighteen years, who were being deported without the police questioning the farmer who had reported them, and who told us about abuse on the farm were they worked. Eighteen-year-old Albin Mashaba spoke for the three, describing their experience since coming to South Africa:\n\nWe were arrested last night on the farm. The boss foreman took us to the gate of the farm and called the police. We worked collecting bananas, earning five rands [U.S. $ 1] per day. We worked from 6 a.m to 8 p.m. The foreman's name was Ngoma. We had no accommodation, so would sleep outside in the open. We received only a little food, not enough. At lunch we had to provide for ourselves. We only got half an hour for lunch and had to cook and eat very fast. There was never enough time to eat. There were different foremen, but they all beat us. They always wanted us to work faster. They beat us with the handle of a knife, and with baton sticks.\n\nWe don't know why we were arrested. The foreman said we were trying to run away. We couldn't leave, we were forced to stay on the farm. The farmer had paid us for the last two weeks, but the foreman took the ninety rand [U.S. $ 18] and called the police to have us deported. Now we have nothing. The policemen asked the foreman no questions, they just took us away. It is all very wrong. We were the ones working, and the foremen were the thieves.[73]\n\nWhen Human Rights Watch tried to discuss the case of these three young men with the police officers on duty after the men had been deported, a disturbing problem came to light. It became clear that no paperwork had been prepared by the arresting officer, so the three didn't exist in the files of the Komatipoort police station. A sergeant on duty told us that he had just told the three young men to get on the bus, which was picking up the other detainees awaiting repatriation, and \"go home.\"[74] When we discussed the treatment of the boys on the farm with the sergeant, he told us that he sees lots of beatings and even dog bites, but that the undocumented Mozambicans rarely want to press charges: They prefer to be deported rather than spend a long time in detention while the case drags on.[75] Captain Nel, superintendent of the Malelane Police Station, told us about similar problems with prosecuting farmers:\n\nIt is a big problem to prosecute farmers because the Mozambican has to serve as a witness, and so we have to keep the Mozambican in custody. Then we have to go to the Attorney-General to get permission to keep them in the cells. So the farmers just ask for extensions, and the poor farm worker stays in jail the whole time.[76]\n\nA high-ranking police official who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed that political interference made it difficult to arrest and prosecute farmers for hiring undocumented migrants or abusing their workers: \"We started prosecuting the farmers, but it's a big fight. It's a political issue. If we charge the farmers, they turn against the government. So higher up, they don't want us to charge the farmer.\"[77]\n\nThe almost complete lack of accountability for abuses committed against undocumented farm workers has led to some horrific instances of violence against undocumented migrants. According to one newspaper account, a Northern province farmer allegedly tested his rifle by shooting at the leg of one of his farm workers, who as a result had to have his foot amputated. At the time of the article, the farmer had not been prosecuted, and no compensation had been paid to the victim.[78]\n\nThe case of Florentino Edmundo Amade is equally disturbing. Amade was working for a crocodile farmer on a farm called Gravelotte, when he had a disagreement in June, 1993, with the farmer, Mr. Torre. The farmer denied him food for three days. After three days, Amade was caught by the farmer trying to eat a piece of the meat he was supposed to feed to the crocodiles. Amade claims he was beaten by the farmer, and later again by white police officers called by the farmer, who arrived in two police vans with dogs. At the end of the beating, Amade had a broken left arm and had several dog bites from police dogs.\n\nTorre allegedly forced Amade to remain on the farm for several days without access to medical treatment, out of fear of being prosecuted for the beating. After three days, Torre took Amade to a doctor in town in the back of a pick-up truck used for transporting the meat for the crocodiles. The doctor refused to treat Amade, arguing that he should have been brought earlier. Amade walked himself to the nearby \"black\" Tintswalo Hospital, where he remained for two months to recover from his injuries. A legal case was opened by Amade against Torre, but it was dismissed after Torre allegedly lied to the court, saying that Amade had returned to Mozambique. Human Rights Watch last met with Amade in October 1997 and noted that his left arm remained virtually unusable and that Amade was unable to find employment because most physical work caused his arm to become painfully swollen. The farmer was never prosecuted, and no compensation was paid to Amade.[79]\n\nEven when the police take action against abuses, it is often to the detriment of the undocumented migrant who has been victimized. According to press reports, five young undocumented migrants from Zimbabwe were languishing in Louis Trichardt prison for more than five months after being attacked with pick-ax handles, shocked with a cattle prod, and thrown off a moving pick-up truck by five men in the town of Vivo on the night of September 28, 1996.[80] According to the investigative officer, Sergeant Seckle, the five victims were being kept in custody out of fear that they might otherwise skip the country, and the case against the perpetrators would have to be withdrawn.[81] In another case, two Mozambicans who went to the police to report the theft of firewood which had taken them six weeks to collect found themselves arrested and deported instead.[82]\n\nSelf-employed immigrants involved in informal business such as vehicle and electrical repairs, vegetable selling, clothes repair, and shoe mending, are also vulnerable to exploitation. Sometimes, South Africans engage the services of such persons, but later collect their goods without paying. If the undocumented migrant dares to complain, he or she is in danger of being assaulted or reported to the police and deported. Human Rights Watch interviewed a Mozambican electrical engineer in Soweto who had a \"smoking\" car brought to him for repairs by a policeman in civilian clothes. When the work was completed, the officer returned in uniform to collect both the repaired car and the hapless engineer, who was driven to the police station and forced to pay a 500 rands [U.S. $ 100] bribe to the police officers before being released. Needless to say, he was never paid by the police officer for his repair work on the car.[83] Another self-employed undocumented Mozambican supplied a police officer with seat covers for his car but was never paid for the service.[84]\n\nReports have repeatedly surfaced about Mozambican women and children being sold into forced servitude or sexual bondage in South Africa by Mozambican smugglers. In 1990, a reporter from the Mail &Guardian wrote about purchasing two young Mozambican women, aged 14 and 17, and claimed that many more women were being offered to South African men as \"wives.\"[85] Anti-Slavery International documented several similar cases of women being sold to South African men as \"wives\" in a 1992 report.[86] The clandestine nature of border crossings between South Africa and Mozambique and the rural remoteness of the South Africa border region make it difficult to monitor such abuses, and it is likely that they continue on some unknown scale. The significant rise in open prostitution in South Africa since liberalization of morality laws in the 1990s also raises concerns about the trafficking of women into South Africa for purposes of forced sexual labor.\n\nAbuses During the Arrest Process\n\nThe Agencies Involved in the Detection of Undocumented Migrants\n\nA number of agencies in South Africa play an important role in the detection and arrest of undocumented migrants, including different branches of the South African Police Service (SAPS), the Department of Home Affairs, and the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). In addition to these formal structures, informal community structures are in existence to \"aid\" these agencies in tracking down and arresting undocumented migrants.\n\nMost South African police stations play at least a contributory role in tracking down and arresting undocumented migrants during their ordinary duties. In urban centers with large numbers of undocumented migrants, such as Johannesburg, arrest records suggest that tracking down undocumented migrants is one of the major occupations of many police officers. Frequently, undocumented migrants are arrested in order to boost arrest figures. For example, when the Johannesburg police announced in June 1997 that they had arrested 11,916 suspects in recent crime sweeps as part of a high-density crime operation, a closer reading revealed that 5,776 of those arrested were undocumented immigrants.[87] Another Johannesburg crime prevention sweep over two days in September 1997 yielded about 1,400 arrests, of which 736 were undocumented migrants.[88] Because undocumented migrants are probably easier to track down and arrest than hardened criminals, including them in crime sweep arrest figures may improve the image of the police, but it also increases the perception among South Africans that there is a strong link between crime and undocumented migration.\n\nThe South African Police Service (SAPS) has also established a number of Internal Tracing Units (ITU), some formerly known informally as the \"Maputo squads,\" which focus exclusively on the tracking down, identifying, and arrest of undocumented migrants. By the time of our investigation, at least fourteen such ITUs were operating in South Africa, mostly in major urban areas and in areas with high concentrations of undocumented migrants such as the border area with Mozambique. In addition to the ITUs, there exists a national Aliens Investigation Unit which concentrates on the organized inflow of undocumented migrants into South Africa and certain wide-spread fraudulent practices associated with the issuing of false documents.[89]\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs also identifies and arrests undocumented migrants, although it focuses mostly on processing the suspected undocumented migrants detained by the police and army. Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of persons who had been arrested on the street by officials from the Department of Home Affairs, while police officials at Johannesburg Central police station confirmed that persons are detained directly by the Department of Home Affairs at their offices at 15 Market Street in Johannesburg. The director of admissions and migrants control confirmed that the Department of Home Affairs itself traces and arrests suspected undocumented migrants.[90]\n\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) plays an important role in the detection and arrest of suspected undocumented migrants. One company, comprising an estimated 200 soldiers, is constantly deployed on the Mozambican border. The army also uses mobile vehicle control points as well as road blocks to inspect vehicles and intercept undocumented migrants as they make their way to urban centers.[91] Undocumented migrants apprehended while attempting to cross the border are briefly detained at the substations near the border, where they are questioned before being transferred to the Macadamia army base.[92] From the Macadamia base, the detainees are transferred to the custody of the police at Komatipoort police station on the border with Mozambique.[93] Major Visser, the commanding officer of the company deployed at the border at the time of our visit, estimated that on average about thirty-five persons per day are detained by his troops at the border.[94] A road block easily nets more than 250 undocumented migrants.[95] Throughout South Africa, an estimated 6,490 soldiers are deployed each month to help combat crime, and these soldiers arrested 38,902 undocumented migrants, compared to 5,075 criminal suspects between January and December 15, 1997.[96]\n\nFor its interception operations at the Mozambican border, the SANDF relies extensively on the 3,300-volt electric fence that separates South Africa from Maputo province in Mozambique. The fence runs for sixty-three kilometers between the Swaziland border and the South African border town of Komatipoort. Constructed in 1986 and turned on in August 1987, the fence was ostensibly created to prevent anti-apartheid guerrillas from the ANC and other liberation movements from infiltrating South Africa via Mozambique. The fence consists of six coils of ten-foot-high razor wire and ten electrified cables, each capable of carrying 3,300 volts. The fence itself is divided into eleven sections, with each section serviced by a substation and a generator to boost the current. Current levels can be set at two levels: lethal and non-lethal. It is estimated that more than one hundred people were killed from electrocution by the fence between its turn-on date and February 1990, when the South African authorities reported that the current on the fence was turned down to non-lethal levels and that the current was switched off from time to time.[97]\n\nThe use of a lower, non-lethal, current brings its own problems, with people \"sticking\" to the fence on occasion. Maria Macamo lives in Machava, outside Mozambique's capital city Maputo. She told Human Rights Watch in February 1997 that she had attempted to cross the electric fence south of Ressano Garcia in March 1996. She threw wet mud at the fence, and when she did not see any sparks, she assumed that it would be safe to cross through a passage dug underneath the fence by border jumpers. However, while attempting to pass underneath the fence, she accidentally touched some of the wires and got stuck to the fence, unable to move from the fence until a fellow Mozambican pulled her off. Her left arm was badly scarred, and she told us that she had lost most of the strength in that arm. Unable to perform many forms of physical labor, she now tries to eke out a living selling cashew nuts in Maputo.[98] She said she heard of many other Mozambicans who have been injured at the fence. Maputo's Central Hospital confirms that it receives a number of cases each year of people injured by the border fence, but it does not keep records.[99]\n\nIn addition to these formal structures, an increasing number of informal structures are also playing a role in tracing and arresting undocumented migrants. This development follows an August 1994 speech by Minister of Home Affairs Buthelezi in which he called upon the South African public to help his department curb the influx of foreigners by reporting suspected undocumented migrants.[100] Police officials have encouraged participation of the public by advertising toll-free \"crime stop\" numbers which persons can call to report undocumented migrants and by offering reward money for reporting undocumented migrants. According to a resident of Soweto, the Department of Home Affairs has similarly attempted to get the public involved in tracking down undocumented migrants:\n\nThere has been a document issued by the Department of Home Affairs urging the locals to report any Mozambican to the police. It was sort of an underhanded activity, and they were not up-front about it since it was not an official document. But I know it was a police number you had to dial to. There was an unclear Home Affairs seal, and it indicated the reward was fifty rands [U.S. $ 10] per illegal alien.[101]\n\nSenior police officials at Yeoville and Hillbrow confirmed that the public is encouraged to call \"crime stop\" numbers to report undocumented migrants, and that they regularly trace undocumented migrants this way.[102] Colonel Raymond Dowd of the Western Cape Police Services has told the press that almost ten thousand rands [U.S. $ 2,000] had been paid out in reward money to the public for reporting undocumented migrants, and encouraged increased public participation \"to enable the ITUs to fulfill their functions.\"[103] Jurie de Wet, chief immigration officer for the Western Cape, recently wrote that his office had \"already had discussions with the editor of the Khayelitsha News to ask the public for their co-operation in the detection of illegal aliens and it is our intention to eventually reach every township in the Western Cape in this manner.\"[104] The use of citizens to locate and arrest undocumented migrants presents troubling potential areas of abuse. Desmond Lockey M.P., the chair of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, told Human Rights Watch how local persons in his own district of Winterveld near Pretoria had in the past colluded with the police to get migrants deported so they could loot the property of the migrants afterwards.[105]\n\nIn addition to general involvement of the public, anti-immigrant community structures are also playing an increasingly active role in the detection of undocumented migrants. For example, the African Chamber of Hawkers and Independent Businessmen (ACHIB), one of the hawker organizations involved in organizing violent protests against foreign hawkers, has established structures to prevent undocumented migrants from hawking. ACHIB has divided Johannesburg into hawking blocks, and has appointed \"block committees\" in each hawking block to identify undocumented migrants, place them under \"community arrest,\" and hand them over to the police. At a March 26, 1997, meeting attended by a Human Rights Watch representative, the Gauteng Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Safety and Security, Jesse Duarte and ACHIB representatives agreed to establish a joint committee to meet regularly to coordinate cooperation between ACHIB and the South African Police Services.[106] Human Rights Watch fears that such close cooperation between the police and a group linked to vigilante violence against foreigners may lead to an increase in abuses against migrants.\n\nAbuses Committed During Detection and Arrest\n\nArbitrary Identification Procedures\n\nAll structures involved in the detection, tracing and arrest of undocumented migrants were accused of abuse by the persons interviewed by Human Rights Watch. One of the most common complaints was the arbitrary mechanisms used to identify suspected undocumented migrants for arrest. The tactics used by the Internal Tracing Units were described in one study:\n\nThe internal tracing units of the [South African Police Service] have become adept at spotting an illegal ... In trying to establish whether a suspect is an illegal (sic) or not, members of the internal tracing units focus on a number of aspects. One of these is language: accent, the pronouncement of certain words. Some are asked what nationality they are and if they reply \"Sud\" African this is a dead give-away for a Mozambican, while Malawians tend to pronounce the letter \"r\" as \"errow\". In Durban many claim to be Zulu but speak very little. Some of those arrested as undocumented migrants are found with home-made phrase books in their pockets. Often they are unable to answer simple questions in Zulu or are caught out if asked who the Zulu king is. Often the reply is \"Mandela.\"... Appearance is another factor in trying to establish whether a suspect is illegal--hairstyle, type of clothing worn as well as actual physical appearance. In the case of Mozambicans a dead give-away is the vaccination mark on the lower left forearm. Some Mozambicans, knowing this, have taken to either self-mutilation (cutting out the vaccination mark), having a tattoo put over it, only wearing long-sleeved shirts and never rolling up the sleeves, or wearing a watch halfway up the arm to cover the mark.[107]\n\nDespite an appearance of objectivity, the indicators used are in fact arbitrary and based upon overly generalized stereotypes. The reliance on these indicators results in the wrongful identification and arrest of a large number of South African citizens as undocumented migrants. Equally troubling is the fact that the identification strategies focus exclusively on black persons, although there are a large number of non-black persons who overstay their visas in South Africa. In fact, during our entire investigation, all persons we saw in detention were black (including Indian and Pakistani detainees).\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed a significant number of persons who were in detention after being wrongfully identified as undocumented migrants. Benneth Mabaso, awaiting deportation at Komatipoort police station, related to us how he had lived in South Africa his entire life, but had received a Mozambican inoculation mark during a visit to Mozambique with his Mozambican father. A week before our visit, soldiers had destroyed his ID document because he had an inoculation mark:\n\nThe soldiers destroyed my ID document a week before. They looked at my inoculation mark and told me my ID was false and ripped it up. They said I couldn't be South African with a mark.[108]\n\nMr. Mabaso was traveling to a South African town near the Mozambican border to arrange the funeral for his sister who had recently died, but instead found himself being deported to Mozambique.[109]\n\nZephaniah Mabaso (unrelated to Ben"
