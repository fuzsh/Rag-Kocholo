He was among the earliest adherents of the Fascist movement and in 1922 was one of the quadrumvirs in the famous March on Rome, which signaled the beginning of the Fascist regime. After serving as chief of police and commander of the Fascist militia, he was appointed governor of Tripolitania in 1925 and in 1929 became minister for the colonies. He later admitted that as early as 1932 he and Benito Mussolini began seriously to contemplate forcing a war upon Ethiopia. When it broke out in October 1935, he was appointed commander in chief, but after six weeks he was replaced by the more talented Gen. Pietro Badoglio, though he was rewarded with the rank of field marshal. He became inspector of Italian overseas forces in 1939 and on the eve of Italy's entry into World War II he was put in charge of the group of armies of the south. Appointed minister of state in 1942, he participated in the historic meeting of the Fascist Grand Council (July 24/25, 1943) and was among those who voted against Mussolini, thus causing the leader's downfall.

In 1911 he was elected to the Austrian parliament as a deputy for Trento, joining other Italian deputies who sought the annexation of the Trentino by Italy. When the annexation was effected (1919), he became an Italian citizen and was elected deputy to the Italian parliament in 1921 as one of the founders of the Italian Popular Party (PPI), which represented the liberal Christian Democratic tradition. The party was dissolved by the Fascists in 1926, and he was arrested in 1927 and sentenced to four years imprisonment; he was released, after serving 16 months, through Pope Pius XI's intervention.

Nov. 11, 2021, Cape Town, South Africa), president of South Africa (1989-94); son of Johannes de Klerk. In 1972 he was elected to parliament for the National Party (NP). He was minister of social welfare and pensions (1978), posts and telecommunications (1978-79), sports and recreation (1978-79), mines, energy and environmental planning (1979-80), mineral and energy affairs (1980-82), internal affairs (1982-85), and national education and planning (1984-89) and chairman of the Ministers' Council of the House of Assembly (1985-89). After Pres. P.W. Botha fell ill in January 1989, de Klerk was elected leader of the NP and successfully opposed Botha's resumption of office after his recovery. He was formally elected president by the tricameral parliament on September 14. He owed his political success to the power base he had built up in the Transvaal, where he had been chairman of the provincial NP from 1982. He committed himself to initiating talks about a new postapartheid constitution with representative leaders of the country's ethnic communities. He quickly moved to release all important political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela (in 1990), and to lift the ban on the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress. Thereafter, he frequently met with black leaders, and in 1991 his government repealed several racially discriminatory laws. In 1992 he called a referendum in which almost 69% of the country's white voters endorsed his reform policies. He and Mandela jointly received the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for their collaboration in efforts to establish nonracial democracy in South Africa. De Klerk led his party's campaign in the first all-race elections in April 1994, which the ANC won. He subsequently joined a government of national unity formed by Mandela, taking the post of second deputy president.

July 14, 1946, Manzanares, Caldas department, Colombia), Colombian politician. He was interior minister in 1990-93 and was Ernesto Samper's running mate in the 1994 presidential elections. Samper's winning campaign was allegedly bankrolled by more than $6 million in contributions from the notorious Cali drug mob. Unlike other key Samper aides, Vice President de la Calle did not resign when the so-called \"narco-scandal\" erupted but only quit halfway through the presidential term (1996) saying the \"country was falling to pieces.\" He had also served as ambassador to Spain (1995-96); in 1998-2000 he was ambassador to the United Kingdom. In 2000 he again became interior minister and was a close collaborator in Pres. Andrés Pastrana's efforts to make peace with leftist guerrillas. He resigned in 2001 and was appointed ambassador to the Organization of American States, a post he resigned in 2002.

July 9, 2019, Escobar, Buenos Aires province, Argentina), president of Argentina (1999-2001). He entered politics at 26 and became a senator at 35, in 1973. In September 1973 he was the vice presidential candidate of the Radical Civic Union. In 1996, he was elected mayor of Buenos Aires, where he turned the capital's $600 million budget deficit into a surplus and installed anti-corruption agencies. In 1999 de la Rúa cast himself as a candidate of change, a dull but steady hand to guide Argentina out of a recession after a decade under the flamboyant Carlos Menem. He made his sedate image an advantage, one campaign ad showing Menem in a Ferrari and de la Rúa saying: \"I'm going to end this party.\" He rode to the presidency at the head of the Alliance coalition, a perpetually shaky union of his centrist Radical party and the leftist Frepaso movement of his vice president, Carlos Álvarez. After a brief honeymoon - his approval rating topping 70% in December 1999 - he soon began to flounder. First came a Senate scandal, with allegations that government officials had bribed lawmakers to pass a key bill. Accusations that de la Rúa was not confronting corruption snowballed, and Álvarez resigned in October 2000, accusing de la Rúa of disregarding a \"cancer\" of corruption. Meanwhile, the economy failed to pick up, and by March 2001, a desperate de la Rúa fired two economy ministers in two weeks and turned to Menem's former miracle worker, Domingo Cavallo. Cavallo could not muster a repeat performance, and both men's popularity plummeted as the government imposed austerity plans, cutting state salaries and pensions and hiking taxes. The anger boiled over in December, and de la Rúa was driven from office by violent protests. He made one last bid to build a government of \"national unity,\" then wrote out his resignation.\n\nde la Rúa (Bruno), Jorge (Enrique) (b. Sept. 22, 1941, Córdoba, Argentina - d. Aug. 15, 2015, Córdoba), justice minister of Argentina (2000-01); brother of Fernando de la Rúa.\n\nde las Alas, Antonio (Noble) (b. Oct. 14, 1889, Taal, Batangas, Philippines - d. Oct. 6, 1983, Chicago, Ill.), acting interior secretary (1922) and finance secretary (1936-38) of the Philippines. He was also secretary of public works and communications (1933-36) and, under the Japanese occupation, commissioner (1942-43) and minister (1943-45) of finance.\n\nde las Alas, Severino (Mojica) (b. Jan. 8, 1851, Indang, Cavite, Philippines - d. Nov. 4, 1918, Indang), interior secretary of the Philippine Republic (1899).\n\nDe Leon\n\nDe Leon, Daniel (b. Dec. 14, 1852, Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles - d. May 11, 1914, New York City), U.S. socialist. He was one of the chief propagandists for socialism in the early American labour movement, but his uncompromising tactics were often divisive. De Leon arrived in the U.S. in 1874. He supported Henry George's mayoral campaign in New York City in 1886. In 1890 he joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) and soon became one of the leading figures in the party, editing its newspaper The People and helping to transform it into a disciplined national organization. He excoriated the labour union leadership of the day as insufficiently radical and in 1895 led a faction that seceded from the Knights of Labor, subsequently forming the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (STLA). In 1899 a dissident faction left the SLP and formed what became the Socialist Party of America. The membership and prestige of the SLP declined thereafter. At a convention in Chicago in 1905, De Leon helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), with which the STLA promptly merged. But he was refused a seat at the IWW's 1908 convention by extremists who rejected political activity of the sort that he advocated and who favoured more violent tactics. He then created another schismatic body, the \"Detroit IWW\" (as opposed to the original \"Chicago IWW\") based on the SLP's program. After De Leon's death it was renamed the Workers' International Industrial Union in 1915 and was dissolved in 1925. In De Leon's philosophy there was no belief that government should nationalize the industries, under the leadership of a supposed working-class party. The goal, rather, was direct democratic control of all industries and services by the workers united in an industrial union.\n\nde León Carpio\n\nde León Carpio, (José) Ramiro (b. Jan. 12, 1942, Guatemala City - d. April 16, 2002, Miami, Fla.), president of Guatemala (1993-96). He was joint president of the National Constituent Assembly (1984-86) and human rights ombudsman (1989-93). He was named president when Jorge Serrano was forced to flee the country after a failed attempt to dismiss Congress and the Supreme Court. In March 2002, he announced he was leaving the ruling Guatemalan Republican Front party because he was concerned about allegations of corruption in government.\n\nde Lima, Leila (Norma Eulalia Josefa Magistrado) (b. Aug. 27, 1959, Iriga City, Camarines Sur, Philippines), justice secretary of the Philippines (2010-15).

He was also a deputy premier of East Germany (1989-90) and minister for special tasks of Germany (1990).\n\nde Maizière, (Karl Ernst) Thomas (b. Jan. 21, 1954, Bonn, West Germany), minister for special tasks (2005-09), interior minister (2009-11, 2013-18), and defense minister (2011-13) of Germany; cousin of Lothar de Maizière.\n\nde Marco\n\nde Marco, Guido (b. July 22, 1931, Valletta, Malta - d. Aug. 12, 2010, Msida, Malta), Maltese politician. He was first elected to the House of Representatives for the Nationalist Party in April 1966 and was returned to parliament at every subsequent election. Appointed secretary general of the Nationalist Party in 1972, he served until 1977 when he was elected deputy leader. When the Nationalist Party was returned to office in 1987, de Marco was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of the interior and justice. During his tenure, de Marco introduced several bills in the House of Representatives that integrated important conventions, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, into domestic law. As interior minister he led the reform and modernization of the Police Force and founded the Police Academy. He was appointed as minister of foreign affairs in May 1990 and remained in office until October 1996. One of his first acts as foreign minister was submitting Malta's application for membership of the European Communities in Brussels on July 16, 1990. On Sept. 18, 1990, de Marco was elected president of the United Nations General Assembly (45th Session). Between 1996 and 1998 de Marco served as shadow minister and opposition spokesman on foreign affairs and as a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was reappointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs on Sept. 8, 1998, following the Nationalist Party's victory at the 1998 general elections. On September 11, he presented Malta's request for the reactivation of its application for membership to the European Union to Wolfgang Schüssel, the foreign minister of Austria, which held the presidency of the European Union. De Marco was president of Malta from 1999 to 2004.\n\nde Maré, Johan Gustaf Samuel (b. April 12, 1820, Västervik, Kalmar, Sweden - d.

He took part in the anti-Fascist resistance in World War II. After the war he joined the reconstituted Socialist Party and was elected to parliament in 1948. He soon won the confidence of party leader Pietro Nenni, to whom he became vice secretary in 1958. When, in 1963, Nenni became deputy prime minister in the first centre-left government of Aldo Moro, De Martino took over as party secretary. He tried unsuccessfully to stop a split by hardline leftists opposed to the Socialists' entry into a coalition government with the Christian Democrats. In 1966-69, the Socialists temporarily united with the Social Democrats; De Martino and Mario Tanassi became joint secretaries. He was deputy prime minister in 1968-69 and 1970-72. For the latter period he ceded the party leadership to Giacomo Mancini. In 1976 he was replaced as leader by Bettino Craxi following the party's poor showing in national elections. In April 1977 his son Guido was kidnapped and then released after 10 days. Shaken by the abduction, De Martino retired from active politics. Under Craxi, the Socialist Party became embroiled in the Clean Hands corruption scandal which shook Italian politics in the early 1990s. Craxi, disgraced, went into exile, and the Socialists, like several other parties tainted by scandal, collapsed. De Martino was given the honour of being named senator-for-life in 1991, at which point he joined the post-Communist Democrats of the Left, whom he considered \"the true heirs to socialist values.\"\n\nDe Martino, Giacomo (b. Dec. 8, 1815, Tunis, Tunisia - d. April 6, 1879, Pontedera, Pisa province, Italy), foreign minister of the Two Sicilies (1860).\n\nDe Martino, Giacomo (b. Sept. 21, 1849, London, England - d.

Sept. 7, 1868, Bern, Switzerland - d. June 25, 1957, Rome, Italy), Italian diplomat; grandson of Giacomo De Martino (1815-1879). He was ambassador to Germany (1920), the United Kingdom (1921-22), Japan (1922-25), and the United States (1925-32).\n\nde Mel, Ronnie, byname of Ronald Joseph Godfrey de Mel (b. April 11, 1925, Moratuwa, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka] - d. Feb. 27, 2024, Colombo, Sri Lanka), finance minister of Sri Lanka (1977-88).\n\nDe Michelis, Gianni (b. Nov. 26, 1940, Venice, Italy - d.

He was also minister of state participation (1980-83) and labour (1983-87) and deputy prime minister (1988-89).\n\nDe Mita\n\nDe Mita, (Luigi) Ciriaco (b. Feb. 2, 1928, Nusco, Avellino province, Italy - d. May 26, 2022, Avellino, Italy), prime minister of Italy (1988-89). A Christian Democrat (DC) party councillor from 1956, he became MP in 1963, and served as minister of industry, commerce, and arts and crafts (1973-74), foreign trade (1974-76), and for the Mezzogiorno (1976, 1978-79). He became party chairman in 1982 and was reelected in 1986 with the backing of 60% of the party conference. When he took over the party leadership, it seemed as if the DC political amalgamation was coming unstuck after 33 years in power. Candidates chosen by De Mita as possible prime ministers had failed to persuade the other parties to join the DC in another coalition, and Pres. Sandro Pertini asked the Republican leader, Giovanni Spadolini, to try his luck. The result was that in June 1981 the DC party for the first time joined a coalition that was not headed by one of its own men. After 17 months Spadolini was replaced by Amintore Fanfani, a Christian Democrat, but 8 months later another \"outsider,\" Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, representing a party one-third the size of De Mita's, was chosen as prime minister. Craxi held onto the post for nearly four years. Those years allowed Craxi to enhance his personal power and that of his party; to De Mita's regret. Even following the 1987 elections, De Mita eschewed the premiership for eight months while his protégé, Giovanni Goria, was prime minister. In April 1988 De Mita was finally sworn in as prime minister. His refusal to give up chairmanship of the party at the same time caused irritation among those wanting to step into his shoes.\n\nde Montmorency, Sir Geoffrey Fitzhervey (b. Aug. 23, 1876 - d.

Oct. 14, 1882, New York City - d. Aug. 29, 1975, Dublin, Ireland), prime minister (1932-48, 1951-54, 1957-59) and president (1959-73) of Ireland. He participated in the anti-British Easter Rising in Dublin (1916). Because of his American birth, he escaped execution by the British but was sentenced to penal servitude. He was elected president of the revolutionist Sinn Féin party, which won three-quarters of all the Irish constituencies in December 1918. The Irish members of the House of Commons met as the Dáil Éireann (Irish Assembly) and declared for a republic with de Valera as president. After a dramatic escape from Lincoln Jail in February 1919, he went in disguise to the U.S., where he collected funds. He returned to Ireland in 1921 and appointed plenipotentiaries to negotiate in London. He repudiated the treaty that they signed to form the Irish Free State, however, because it accepted the exclusion of Northern Ireland and imposed an oath of allegiance to the British crown. When the Dáil ratified the treaty (Jan. 8, 1922), de Valera resigned the presidency and supported the republican resistance in the ensuing civil war. William Thomas Cosgrave's Irish Free State ministry imprisoned him; but he was released in 1924 and then organized a Republican opposition party, Fianna Fáil. The Cosgrave ministry was defeated by Fianna Fáil in 1932, and de Valera embarked quickly on severing connections with Great Britain. In 1937 the Free State declared itself a sovereign state, as Ireland, or Éire. In 1959 de Valera agreed to stand as a candidate for the presidency. He resigned his position as taoiseach (head of government) and leader of Fianna Fáil. In June he was elected president and he was reelected in 1966.\n\nde Valera, Síle (b.

June 21, 1835, Pittsford, Northamptonshire, England - d. Dec. 16, 1901, Llyswen, Brecknockshire, Wales), administrator-general of the Congo Free State (1885-86) and administrator of British East Africa (1890-91); knighted 1884.\n\nde Zoysa, Stanley (b. June 24, 1907 - d. Dec. 10, 1970), finance minister of Ceylon (1956-59). He was also minister of home affairs and health (1959-60).\n\nDeák, Ferenc, byname a haza bölcse (\"Sage of the Country\") (b. Oct. 17, 1803, Söjtör, Austria [now in Hungary] - d. Jan. 28/29, 1876, Budapest, Hungary), Hungarian politician. He entered the Hungarian Diet in 1833 and played a moderate liberal role, dissociating himself from Lajos Kossuth's extreme-Magyar nationalism. Reelected in 1843, he declined his mandate in protest against the scandalous manner in which the election had been conducted. By this time he had become the most generally respected figure in his camp. He drafted for the \"national opposition\" its program of reform for the Diet of 1847. Ill health prevented him from seeking election to that body, but when, in March 1848, the crown sanctioned the establishment of an independent Hungarian ministry, the new minister-president, Lajos Batthyány, insisted on his taking the portfolio of justice. During the next months, he took part in most of the negotiations between the Hungarian government and its opponents. He ceased to be minister when Batthyány resigned in September, and he refused reappointment. Prevented from rejoining the Diet, he retired for some years, refusing all invitations to collaborate with a regime that he condemned as illegal. From 1854 he became the oracle of all those who sought a way out of Hungary's political impasse. In 1861 he returned to the Diet as head of the moderate opposition. As his international difficulties gradually convinced Emperor Franz Joseph of the need for reconciliation with Hungary, Deák put forward Hungary's conditions in terms that led to the Compromise (Ausgleich) of 1867, by which the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was established. Deák was beyond question the originator of the Compromise, though its machinery was not all of his devising. He helped to complete the legislation deriving from the Compromise and defended it in parliament when necessary. The Compromise was the crowning achievement of Deák's life work, but he also exercised his influence in many other areas of public life, always on the side of reasoned reform.\n\nDeakin\n\nDeakin, Alfred (b. Aug. 3, 1856, Melbourne, Victoria [Australia] - d. Oct. 7, 1919, Melbourne), prime minister (1903-04, 1905-08, 1909-10) and foreign minister (1903-04, 1905-08) of Australia. In 1880 he entered the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, where he served until 1901. In 1883 he became minister of public works in the Victoria government, and afterwards solicitor general and minister for water supply. He sponsored an important irrigation bill in 1886 and acts protecting factory workers in 1885 and 1896. A leader in the federation movement, he attended the conferences of 1891 and 1897-98 that drafted the constitution bill making Australia a commonwealth. He then went to England in 1900 to guide the bill through parliament. He was elected to the federal parliament in 1901 and was its most interesting personality until he retired in 1913. As attorney general under Sir Edmund Barton (1901-03) he was responsible for many opinions which defined the limits of federal and state authority. When Barton went to the High Court, Deakin was his natural successor. A leader of the Liberal Party, he formed a coalition with the Labor Party in his first two terms but joined with the conservatives in his third term, an unpopular move that quickly led to electoral defeat. He retained the leadership of the Liberal Party, but his political acumen and his mental powers began to decline in December 1912. On Jan. 8, 1913, he retired from active participation in politics, giving his reason as \"inability to remember things,\" and when the parliament was dissolved he did not seek reelection. His plans for an independent Australian navy were carried out by his successors.\n\nDeal, (John) Nathan (b. Aug. 25, 1942, Millen, Ga.), governor of Georgia (2011-19).\n\nH. Dean\n\nDean, Howard (Brush, III) (b. Nov. 17, 1948, New York City), governor of Vermont (1991-2003). The Democrat was elected to the state legislature in 1982 and as lieutenant governor in 1986; when Republican Gov. Richard Snelling died suddenly in August 1991, Dean became governor. Dean is proud of family leave legislation, a bill to reduce phosphorus in lakes and streams and a $14 million small business fund. But his chief issue has been health care. In 1992, he signed a bill to move Vermont toward universal healthcare access; a state agency was set up to bargain with insurance companies. Vermont seemed like a promising laboratory on the healthcare issue. It has only 15 hospitals, 1,000 practicing doctors, rather low costs, two major health insurers: a comprehensible universe. In 1993 Dean produced a Clinton-like state healthcare system, but it was harshly rejected, defeated in the state Senate in May 1994 by, in Dean's words, \"an unholy alliance of the far left and the far right.\" That foreshadowed the crash-and-burn of the Clinton plan. Dean was similarly frustrated in late 1994 and early 1995. He opposed much of the GOP's plans for block grants to states. As head of the National Governors Association, he saw his liberal views ignored by the new Republican congressional leaders, who focused on the 30 Republican governors representing 73% of the electorate nationwide. Vermont and New Hampshire, so unlike politically, are the last states to cling to a two-year gubernatorial term. Dean was reelected with 75% in 1992, 69% in 1994, 71% in 1996, 56% in 1998, and 51% in 2000. He was one of the contenders for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. In 2005-09 he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nDean, Sir Patrick (Henry) (b. March 16, 1909, Berlin, Germany - d. Nov. 5, 1994, Kingston, Surrey, England), British diplomat; knighted 1957. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1960-64) and ambassador to the United States (1965-69).\n\nW.F.

April 1, 1854 - d. July 7, 1908), British resident in Jammu and Kashmir (1900-01) and chief commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province (1901-08); knighted 1906.\n\nW. Deane\n\nDeane, Sir William (Patrick) (b. Jan. 4, 1931, Melbourne, Vic.), governor-general of Australia (1996-2001). He worked for a period in the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department in Canberra. In February 1977 Sir William was appointed a judge in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Subsequently in 1977, he was appointed a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and the President of the Australian Trade Practices Tribunal. In July 1982, he was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia, retiring subsequent to the announcement of his appointment as governor-general on Nov. 10, 1995. He was appointed a Knight of the British Empire in 1982 and a Companion in the Order of Australia in 1988. Sir William was sworn in as governor-general on Feb. 16, 1996.\n\nDearborn, Henry (b. Feb. 23, 1751, North Hampton, New Hampshire - d. June 6, 1829, Roxbury, Mass.), U.S. secretary of war (1801-09) and senior officer of the Army (1812-15). He was also minister to Portugal (1822-24).\n\nDéat, Marcel (b. March 7, 1894, Guérigny, Nièvre, France - d. Jan. 5, 1955, Turin, Italy), French politician. He was minister of air (1936) and labour and national solidarity (1944).\n\nB.K. Deb\n\nDeb, Biplab Kumar (b. Nov. 25, 1969, Rajdhar Nagar village [now in Gomati district], Tripura, India), chief minister of Tripura (2018-22).\n\nD. Deb\n\nDeb, Dasarath (b. Feb. 2, 1916, Boltali village, Khowai subdivision, West Tripura, India - d. Oct. 14, 1998, Agartala, Tripura), Indian politician. His political career began with a mass literacy movement intended for the uplift of the tribal people in Tripura. He led an armed struggle for three years (1948-50) against the repressive, feudal rule of the king of Tripura. In 1950 he joined the Communist Party of India (CPI). He was inducted into the Central Committee of the CPI in 1951. Immediately he made his presence felt in the party at the national level. When the CPI split in 1964, he joined the CPI(M) and was its Central Committee member until the party's 16th congress in Calcutta, held in October 1998. He filed his nomination for the first Lok Sabha elections in 1952 while remaining underground. He won the East Tripura seat with a huge margin on the CPI ticket even without any organized campaign. Deb served as a member of parliament for four terms - from 1952, 1957, 1962, and 1971. Deb did not lose any election except one to the Lok Sabha in 1967. He began to concentrate more on state politics in 1978 and fought the Assembly elections from his home comstituency, Ramchandraghat in West Tripura. He was elected to the State Assembly for four consecutive terms between 1978 and 1993. He was education minister in the first Left Front Government in Tripura in 1978 and deputy chief minister in the second one in 1983. The Left Front went out of power in the 1988 elections, but the high point came for Deb in 1993 when as the state secretary of the CPI(M) he led the party again to victory. Deb took over as chief minister of a Left Front government, and continued in that position until early 1998. He declined on health grounds to contest the 1998 Assembly elections.\n\nDebacq\n\nDebbas\n\nDebacq, Jean-Jacques (b. Nov. 2, 1952, Nantes, Loire-Inférieure [now Loire-Atlantique], France), prefect of Mayotte (1993-94). He was also prefect of the départements of Orne (1999-2001) and Pyrénées-Orientales (2001-02).\n\nDebayle (Sacasa), León (b. 1902, León, Nicaragua - d.

June 3, 1983, Dade county, Fla.), foreign minister of Nicaragua (1936-37, 1948-49). He was also chargé d'affaires in the United States (1932-33).\n\nDebbas, Charles, Arabic Sharl Dabbas (b. April 16, 1884, Beirut, Lebanon - d. 1935, Paris, France), governor (1926), president (1926-34), and prime minister (1932-34) of Lebanon.\n\nDebré, Bernard (b. Sept. 30, 1944, Toulouse, France - d. Sept. 13, 2020), cooperation minister of France (1994-95); fraternal twin of Jean-Louis Debré; son of Michel Debré.\n\nJ.-L. Debré\n\nDebré, Jean-Louis (b. Sept. 30, 1944, Toulouse, France), interior minister (1995-97), president of the National Assembly (2002-07), and president of the Constitutional Council (2007-16) of France; son of Michel Debré.\n\nM. Debré\n\nDebré, Michel (Jean Pierre) (b. Jan. 15, 1912, Paris, France - d. Aug. 2, 1996, Montlouis-sur-Loire, Indre-et-Loire), prime minister of France (1959-62). He entered the civil service, in which he advanced steadily. By the time France declared war on Germany in 1939, he had joined the army as a cavalry officer. Captured and imprisoned by the Germans in 1940, he escaped and joined the Résistance. In 1945, in Charles de Gaulle's provisional government, he was entrusted with planning public administration reforms. He was elected to the Senate in 1948 as a member of de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français and was reelected as a Social Republican (the party's new name) in 1955. With de Gaulle's accession as premier in June 1958, Debré became justice minister and the principal author of the new constitution that inaugurated the Fifth Republic. When de Gaulle assumed the presidency in January 1959, Debré was named premier. Although he sympathized with French settlers who opposed \"giving up\" Algeria, he loyally supported de Gaulle's policy of disengagement. His previous commitments to a French Algeria, however, created increasing embarrassment, and in April 1962 he was replaced by Georges Pompidou. Elected to the assembly in May 1963, he returned to the government in January 1966 as minister of economy and finance. He became foreign minister in May 1968 and in June 1969 moved to the Defense Ministry under Pompidou's presidency, where he remained until 1973. In 1976 he was a leader in the Rassemblement pour la République (RPR), the newly reorganized Gaullist movement founded by Jacques Chirac. He made a bid for the presidency in 1981, running against RPR candidate Chirac as an orthodox Gaullist and winning barely 1% of the votes. He was elected to the Académie française in 1988.\n\nDebrot, Isaac (b. Nov. 7, 1771, Rochefort, Neuchâtel, Switzerland - d. 18...), commander of Bonaire (1817-27).\n\nN. Debrot\n\ndeBrum\n\nDebrot, Nicolaas, byname Cola Debrot (b. May 4, 1902, Kralendijk, Bonaire island, Netherlands Antilles - d.

He was a Democratic state representative in Indiana in 1885-87. In 1893 he became president of the newly established American Railway Union, which won national prominence when it conducted a successful strike against the Great Northern Railroad (April 1894) for higher wages. He was further projected into the limelight when sentenced to six months in jail (May-November 1895) after a federal injunction halted the Chicago Pullman Palace Car Company strike, which he was helping to direct. During his prison term at Woodstock, Ill., he was deeply influenced by his broad reading and became increasingly critical of capitalism. Sympathetic toward Populist doctrines, he campaigned for the Democratic-Populist presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan in 1896. The following year he announced his conversion to socialism and in 1898 led in establishing the Socialist Party of America, though the name was not adopted until 1901. He was the party's presidential candidate for the first time in 1900 but polled only 96,000 votes, a total he raised to 400,000 in 1904. In 1905 he helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), but he soon withdrew because of its radicalism. He was again the Socialist candidate for president in 1908 and 1912 but refused the nomination in 1916. His highest popular vote (about 915,000) was cast in 1920 - even though he was then in prison for criticizing the government's prosecution of persons charged with sedition in violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. He was released from prison by presidential order in 1921. His citizenship, which he lost when he was convicted of sedition in 1918, was restored posthumously in 1976.\n\nDebski, Aleksander (b. June 13, 1890, Radom, Poland - d. [executed] Jan. 31, 1942, Poznan, Poland), governor of Wolynskie województwo (1925-26).\n\nM.I. Déby\n\nDéby (Itno), Mahamat Idriss, byname Kaka (b.

He has been ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (2018- ).\n\nDéby Itno, Daoussa (Idriss), Chadian diplomat; son of Idriss Déby Itno. He was appointed ambassador to Qatar in 2023.\n\nI. Déby Itno\n\nDéby Itno, Idriss, before 2006 known as Idriss Déby (b. 1952, Berdoba, Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, Chad - d. April 20, 2021, northern Chad), president of Chad (1990-2021). He joined the army at the age of 20, later training as a pilot in France. He returned to Chad in 1978 and supported Hissène Habré's opposition to Pres. Goukouni Oueddei, helping orchestrate a coup that brought Habré to power in 1982. Déby then became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In this capacity, and assisted by French troops, he engaged Libyan forces contesting the mineral-rich Aozou Strip to the north. Déby enjoyed such success that the Libyans sued for peace, which garnered him the nickname \"Cowboy of the Desert.\" In 1985 Habré, who had begun to fear Déby as a potential rival, replaced him as chief of staff, named him military adviser, and sent him back to France for advanced military training. Habré also instituted a period of harsh suppression of internal dissent, which included arbitrary arrests and executions. After being implicated in an unsuccessful revolt against Habré in April 1989, Déby fled the country. From a base in Sudan, he made repeated incursions into Chad and finally ousted Habré in December 1990, leading the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), a coalition of anti-government forces. He made himself interim head of state and promised an eventual return to civilian rule. He survived several coup attempts in 1992. In 1994 he signed a treaty of friendship with Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya. He was elected president in 1996 under a new multiparty constitution, based on the French dual-executive model. He was reelected in 2001 and, after a 2005 referendum eliminated term limits, in 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021, continuing to rule Chad with an iron hand as the 1996 constitution placed power almost exclusively in the hands of the executive branch; opposition forces were harassed and imprisoned without warning, while the freedom of the press was also under severe restraint. In 2016-17 he was chairman of the African Union. Just after his last reelection he died while visiting troops on the front line of a fight against northern rebels.\n\nDecazes, Élie (Louis), duc (b.

May 7, 1986, Marseille, France), French politician. At the age of 23 he joined the Socialist Party. A member of the Executive Committee of the banned party under the German occupation, he was entrusted with missions to London and Algiers. He organized three resistance networks and published a clandestine paper, L'Espoir. After the Liberation, he became mayor of Marseille (1944-45 and 1953-86) and from then on enjoyed a busy political career. He was a deputy to the National Assembly for Marseille almost continuously from 1945 until his death. Under the Fourth Republic, he was in government as minister of the merchant marine (1950-51) and overseas France (1956-57). He attracted attention as an opponent of the government's Algerian policy and resigned his ministerial post in 1957. After Gen. Charles de Gaulle came to power in the following year, he lost his parliamentary seat until 1962, when he began to rally the Socialist opposition to de Gaulle's presidency. He was hostile, however, to the Communist Party, the other main element on the left. Standing as the Socialist presidential candidate in 1969, he received only 5% of the vote, in part because of his rivalry with other Socialist figures. A combative politician, he fought a fencing duel with a Gaullist deputy in 1967. He was president of the Regional Council of Provence(-Alpes)-Côte d'Azur (1974-81). After François Mitterrand became president, he became minister of the interior and decentralization (1981-84) and plan and regional planning (1984-86). His most formidable power base was still in the town hall of Marseille, where for 33 years he managed to hold off the challenge from the right (including the National Front), built up the city's social and cultural amenities, and overcame problems of finance, housing, and an influx of emigrants from Algeria in 1962.\n\nDéfly, Serge (Léon) (b. 1898 - d. ...), foreign minister of Haiti (1942-43).

June 15, 1906, Bouillon, Belgium - d. March 31, 1994, Málaga, Spain), Belgian politician. Using banking scandals and the corruption of national parties as issues, he organized the Rexist Movement in 1930, allegedly to cleanse the Roman Catholic religion of political contamination. Though originally a wing of the ruling Catholic Party, the Rexist Movement became an opposition party and, under Degrelle's guidance, won more than 10% of the vote and 21 of the 202 seats in the Belgian parliament in the 1936 election. Subsidized by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Degrelle turned the Rexists into a fascist organization. In alliance with the 16 deputies of the separatist Flemish Nationalist Party, the Rexists forced the formation of weak coalition governments in the late 1930s. During World War II Degrelle collaborated with the German occupation forces. In August 1941 he formed and later commanded the Walloon and Flemish storm-trooper brigades that fought on the Russian front. He won the Iron Cross and was decorated by Adolf Hitler personally. Under his guidance the Rexists took control of local governments and newspapers in Belgium. After Belgium was liberated (September 1944) he was sentenced in absentia to death as a collaborator. Degrelle flew to Spain in the last days of the war after fighting the Soviet advance into eastern Germany. In Spain he was protected by Francisco Franco and in 1954 became a Spanish citizen under the name León José de Ramírez Reina.\n\nDegtyar, Dmitry (Danilovich) (b. 1904 - d. 1982, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), Soviet politician. He was chairman of the State Planning Committee (1939-47) and a deputy premier (1940-47) of the Russian S.F.S.R. and Soviet ambassador to Guinea (1962-64).\n\nDegtyarev\n\nDegutiene\n\nDegtyarev, Mikhail (Vladimirovich) (b.

May 15, 2014, Quimper, France), prime minister of Belgium (1992-99). He held various governmental advisory positions before serving as minister of social affairs and institutional reforms in 1981-88. In the latter year, he became deputy prime minister after engineering a new coalition that retained Wilfried Martens at its helm. Concurrently, Dehaene directed the Ministry of Communications and Institutional Reforms until 1992. General elections on Nov. 24, 1991, prompted by the collapse of the four-party government headed by Martens, reduced the representation of the coalition parties without producing a clear alternative. Guy Verhofstadt, whose opposition Flemish Liberal Party showed the only gains in the parliament, failed to establish a government, as did Melchior Wathelet of the French Christian Democrats. Finally, on March 7, 1992, Dehaene, like Martens a Flemish Christian Democrat, was sworn in as prime minister. Dehaene was an aggressive pragmatist on the political playing field, as attested by his nickname, \"the Bulldozer.\" The entrenched factionalism he faced upon accepting King Baudouin's request to seek a coalition had led some observers to consider Belgium ungovernable. Constitutional reforms whereby the French and Flemish linguistic areas, along with Brussels, would acquire regional autonomy had been inaugurated in 1988 but remained controversial. His primary goal was to secure a two-thirds majority in the 212-seat Chamber of Representatives in order to ensure that the federalization process continued. His coalition consisted, as before, of the two Christian Democrat and the two Socialist parties and was confirmed in elections in 1995. He was a vice-chairman of the European Convention of 2002-03, which drafted a European constitution.\n\nDeheza (Leiva), José Alberto (b. June 16, 1921, Salta, Argentina - d.

After Batista fled and the rebels took control of the island on Jan. 1, 1959, General del Valle held various positions in Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces. He was army chief of staff when a United States-backed exile army tried unsuccessfully to invade the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and also when the United States discovered Soviet missiles on the island the following year, an episode that pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war. In 1979-85 he was minister of public health.\n\nDelacombe, Sir Rohan (b. Oct. 25, 1906, St. Julians, Malta - d. Nov. 10, 1991, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England), British city commandant of Berlin (1959-62) and governor of Victoria (1963-74); knighted 1961.\n\nDelacroix, Léon (Frédéric Gustave) (b. Dec. 27, 1867, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium - d. Oct. 15, 1929, Baden-Baden, Germany), prime minister and finance minister (1918-20) and foreign minister (1920) of Belgium. Towards the end of 1917 he succeeded Edmond Picard as president of the Cassation Court and held this office until the end of World War I. He had not taken part in active political life when on Nov. 14, 1918, King Albert I entrusted him with the formation of a government in which the three great parties of Belgium were represented. Delacroix was minister of finance as well as prime minister. For a year from its formation the spirit of agreed unity with which the Delacroix ministry began its work persisted, and party strife was kept in the background. Gradually, however, in a country where before the war the parties had been accustomed to frequent and furious struggles, party politics inevitably crept back, and after the 1919 elections, which greatly increased the Socialist strength, the situation became delicate. First, the question of gratuities for ex-soldiers led to the resignation of Fulgence Masson, the defense minister. Next, Jules Renkin, the Catholic interior minister, withdrew; and soon after the refusal of the government to allow munitions for Poland to pass through Antwerp led to the resignation of Paul Hymans, the foreign minister, and he was followed by his two remaining Liberal colleagues. This meant the collapse of the three-party coalition, and the cabinet decided to resign on the king's return from a Brazilian tour. Delacroix later served as the permanent representative of the Belgian government on the Reparation Commission, as trustee for the railway bonds under the Dawes Plan, and as one of two Belgian delegates to the committee for the organization of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nDelacroix de Contaut, Charles (b.

After serving as mayor of Lausanne (1974-81) and a member of parliament (1975-83), he joined the seven-member Federal Council, or cabinet, as defense minister in 1984 and was economics minister from 1987 until his resignation in 1998. Delamuraz was president, a largely ceremonial post, in 1989 and 1996. He belonged to the centrist Radical Democrats, one of four parties in the governing coalition. The popular Delamuraz took Switzerland into the World Trade Organization, but suffered a setback in 1992 when the Swiss electorate voted against joining a loose European free trade grouping. The government then froze an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation European Union, which surrounds the country. He prompted an international outcry in 1997 when he said demands for a multimillion-dollar fund to compensate Jews who lost assets in the Holocaust amounted to blackmail. The remark was a public relations debacle for the country and Delamuraz eventually apologized.\n\nDelaney, John (Kevin) (b. April 16, 1963, Wood-Ridge, N.J.), U.S. politician.

May 30, 1950, Tunis, Tunisia), mayor of Paris (2001-14). He became secretary of the Socialist Federation of Aveyron département at the age of 23. His potential was spotted by François Mitterrand, the Socialist Party leader, and he rose fast, becoming a Paris city councillor. He was elected a deputy to the National Assembly in 1981, and in 1983 he became head of the Socialist Party's national federations. At 33 he was effectively number three in the ruling Socialist Party. In 1986 he lost his National Assembly seat, though he kept his seat on the Paris city council. He returned to prominence when he became leader of the Socialist group on the city council in 1993, and he led it into the 1995 election with modest success, taking 6 of the 20 arrondissements from the right. That same year saw Jacques Chirac end his 18 years as mayor of Paris when he became president. The system of government that Chirac had installed in Paris came under growing criticism and judicial investigation for possible \"kickbacks.\" This, and internecine warfare among Chirac's political heirs in the Gaullist party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), contributed heavily to Delanoë's victory when he ran for mayor in 2001. His avowed homosexuality proved to be a non-issue, and his low-key style and persistence eventually came to be preferred by Parisians to the higher-profile Socialist rivals who at several points looked certain to eclipse him. He was helped mightily by the split in the RPR ranks between Philippe Séguin, the official RPR candidate, and Jean Tiberi, the incumbent RPR mayor, who had split with his party but still ran for reelection. Delanoë was able to secure backing from the Greens and won fairly easily in the runoff, becoming the first Socialist mayor of Paris since 1871. He was reelected in 2008.\n\nDelattre, François (Marie) (b. Nov. 15, 1963, Saint-Marcellin, Isère, France), French diplomat.
