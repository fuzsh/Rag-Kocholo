        "text": "The DA has called on the Hawks to request that an investigation be launched into the wastage of more than R15 million on a decrepit sports facility in the Walter Sisulu Municipality.\n\nThe financially ruined municipality has already spent R15.5 million in grant funding on the refurbishment of and upgrades to the Danie Craven stadium and sports facilities in Burgersdorp.\n\nThe eight-month project started in 2017 and was funded to the tune of R12 million through the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG).\n\nThe scope of work included the painting of the stadium and stalls, upgrading and fixing ablution facilities, fixing and prepping the athletics track for a tartan conversion and securing and fencing the facility.\n\nVery little progress was made, and in 2019 another R3.5 million was awarded to finish the project.\n\nIn spite of the R15.5 million already spent, the municipality recently made another R1.8 million available for this doomed project.\n\nDuring a recent oversight inspection, we were shocked to find:\n\nThe tar laid in preparation for a tartan athletics track is cracked and breaking apart.\n\nThe stadium has major cracks due to water leaks, but maintenance on this building has not been done in years.\n\nThe newly refurbished ablution facilities are vandalised and almost destroyed.\n\nNewly fenced sections and the main gate have been stolen.\n\nI have written to the Hawks as serious questions need to be asked about this expenditure to ensure that a corrupt ANC and its deployed cadres have not, once again, looted the publicâ€™s money.\n\nVicky Knoetze, DA EC Shadow MEC for CoGTA, will also be taking the matter up in the provincial legislature.\n\nThe Danie Craven stadium is unsafe. This is a tragic state of affairs for the children of the 28 schools in this municipal area, as there is no viable, up-to-standard municipal athletics and sports field that can accommodate them.\n\nThis shocking disrespect for the residents and disregard for the public purse is an indictment on the municipality, especially those in leadership positions.\n\nThe DA will not allow the uncaring ANC to bring more suffering to our people and will fight to ensure that residents receive the services and facilities that they deserve."
