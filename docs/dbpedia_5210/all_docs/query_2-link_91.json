        "text": "Scout Groups in the Eastern Cape initially fell under the Scout Headquarters in Cape Town, but after the decentralisation of the movement in 1927 they reported to either the Midlands Division with its HQ in Port Elizabeth or the Border Division with its HQ in East London.\n\nAlthough country groups did exist from soon after the founding of the movement, the bulk of the records in the Scout Archives begin immediately after the Second World War when it seems that there was quite a rapid expansion of Scouting in the country towns both small and large.\n\nMidlands Division\n\nVery soon after 'Scouting for Boys' was published a number of Scout Troops were formed in and around the urban area of Port Elizabeth and this was designated District 1. At the same time many groups were springing up in the countryside and to create an efficient organisational structure, they were placed into the following Districts: -\n\nDistrict 2 - Grahamstown, Alexandria and Port Alfred\n\nDistrict 3 - Cradock, Middelburg, Bedford and Adelaide\n\nDistrict 4 - Willowmore, Aberdeen and Graaff Reinet\n\nDistrict 5 - Uitenhage\n\nThere were at some stage also Scouts in Steytlerville with their own hall, Somerset East and far away De Aar. However, by March 1966, the Graaff-Reinet Troop was the only one left in the 'platteland'.\n\nCountry Scouting in 1948\n\nFrom the Scout Archives the following report gives some insight into Scouting in the Midlands countryside. Long before the advent of the digital world, 'newspaper cuttings' were often used as a means of recording and storing history and the following excerpt gives an indication of the popularity of Scouting.\n\nTo keep in contact with the Country Groups the Assistant District Commissioner for Cubs, Miss ET Crooks and \"Fatty\" the ADC for Scouts would make regular visits or tours to these groups bringing news from the Division, encouragement and providing the necessary training.\n\nFrom their March 1948 tour it was reported that: -\n\nAt Graaff Reinet, Mr. A. Knott-Craig has taken over the Troop from Mr. R. E H. Murray. Kennie van Heerden has been appointed Assistant Scoutmaster - a well-merited promotion. Mrs. D. A. Johnston is still running the Cub Pack successfully and Miss O. le Grove Smith has been appointed hon. secretary of the local association.\n\nCradock is still going strong with Messrs. C. Smith and C. Brown as Scouters. The Cub Pack under Mrs. Fuller is doing well with 30 Cubs.\n\nBedford has a flourishing Pack of 24 Cubs, under the aegis of the Assumption Convent and run by Mrs. Robillard. We hear that there is every possibility of a Scout Troop being formed in the near future.\n\nThe Cubs and Scouts in Port Alfred are going ahead. Miss Scott, the Cubmaster, now has a Pack of over 15. Mr. Tomlinson is in charge of the Troop and at the moment the Scouts are busy building canoes for use on the lovely Kowie River. Through the kindness of Mr. Grocott of Grahamstown, the Scouts now have a den on the banks of the river. The Scouts are keen on boxing and would like to arrange a boxing tournament with local Scouts.\n\nScouting in Grahamstown continues to go ahead. A Troop has now started at St. Andrew's Prep. School and the Troop at St. Andrew's College is 84 strong. A number of new warrants have been issued and a number of Scouters are serving their probationary period of three months. Ken Smith has taken over St. Patrick's Troop and is at the moment running the Pioneer Troop until a Scouter can be found.\n\nThe only other Rover Crew in the Division is situated in Grahamstown and two members will be representing the Crew at the S.A. Rover Scout Indaba.\n\nFrom the records available, the following gives a little additional information of Scouting in the Midlands countryside.\n\nGraaff-Reinet (1910 - Active) - Early records reveal that on the 14th October 1910 a meeting was called of those boys interested in joining the Boy Scout Movement and their names were taken by Mr R. Madge. It appears that it took some time for the group to get off the ground and become operational. The first evidence of group activity has been obtained from a picture which portrays six Scouts under Mr D. Olivier, who undertook a bicycle hike to Port Elizabeth in 1915 and the first camp was held at Van der Riet's Bush. By June 1919 the troop numbered twenty Scouts and they undertook a ten-day trip to Port Elizabeth.\n\n1920's - A Wolf Cub pack was formed in 1920 with sixteen cubs and by the end of the year, there were thirty members under the guidance of Miss Smith, while the following year Miss Batt took over the Pack. Rev Oliver reported that he had started a troop at Union High School, asked that it be registered and stated that he would take charge. It was felt that the School Cadet Corps attracted the older boys away from the Scouts because of the rifle shooting practice offered by the School, so on application, the Municipality granted the Scouts a piece of ground as a shooting range. Six service rifles were donated, Mr Williams stamped them with the Scout crest, Mr Clark made a stand for them and Mr McRae looked after them, a really combined effort.\n\nMr Johnstone was appointed Assistant Scoutmaster in 1921 of No. 2 Troop of 25 boys, while No. 1 Troop under Mr Matthews consisted of 29 boys. A day's excursion to the farm of Mr W Rubidge (Dalham) was enjoyed by all and Mrs Rubidge presented each troop with a flag. Mr Williams very kindly supplied a lorry to transport the boys. In March 1923 the two troops were amalgamated under Scoutmaster Johnstone and Assistant Scoutmaster Mr C. Geard, by the end of the year there were 57 Scouts.\n\nKing Scouts C. Geard, F. Joseph and E. Tilbrook where elected in 1924 to represent Graaff-Reinet at the Empire Jamboree in England. In April 1928 a Scout camp was held at Humewood with forty Scouts and officers attending. A highlight of this excursion was a visit to the new motor ship \"Carnarvon Castle\" which was a revelation to many. Ten boys attended the Midlands Jamboree held in Port Elizabeth during June at a cost of 12/6 each. Mr Joe Kroon was appointed as Assistant Scoutmaster.\n\n1930's - A Rover Crew was formed in February 1930 with Max Smit, who had recently attended the 1929 World Jamboree, in command and two weeks later twelve Rovers were enrolled at a public ceremony. For the first time in the history of the Graaff-Reinet Boy Scouts the numbers of all ranks reached the one hundred mark!\n\nScouting continued to grow in Graaff-Reinet and with the formation of a Catholic Scout Troop in 1932 there were now 3 Cub packs, 3 Scout troops, plus a Rover Crew. The membership of the Groups was as follows: Scouters 12, Cubs 57, Scouts 70 and Rovers 24, making a total of 163. This appears to have been the peak of Scouting in Graaff-Reinet as far as numbers are concerned. Once again, the acquisition of a Scout Hall came under consideration and much discussion. In the same year the Midlands Jamboree was held at the Showgrounds in Graaff-Reinet together with the Coming-of-age (1911-1932) celebrations of the Graaff-Reinet Troop.\n\nWar years - During the War years the lack of personnel due to the enlistment of so many men in the army, the Troop suffered a very low ebb. The new Assistant Scoutmaster F M Miller felt that week-end camps would possibly help to bring the boys together more than anything else and hoped that during the new Scouting year they would work together and achieve results. Mr Chookie Gear helped out as Scoutmaster in 1943 and in 1945 was appointed District Commissioner.\n\nA Midlands Jamborally was held at Urquhart Park from March 26 to April 3 1949. Headquarters ably assisted by the Graaff-Reinet Group, made all necessary arrangements. 70 Boys attended, mostly coming from Port Elizabeth.\n\n1950's - A highlight of the decade was when on the 21st June 1955 the opening of the new Hall by the Chief Scout of South Africa, Mr Percy Fowle took place. To celebrate this milestone in the history of the Graaff-Reinet Boy Scout Movement, Mr Pearce, the Mayor held a civil luncheon in the Chief Scout is honour.\n\n1960's - The decade started with great activity with fund raising through many concerts and functions. New tents, ropes, billy cans and axes were bought, enabling the Scouts to be better equipped. During September 1964 a joint Scout Camp was held in Graaff-Reinet with St. Columbus Troop from Port Elizabeth who had won the prestigious Walton Trophy. They were sent to bring to the Graaff-Reinet Troop and its friends their practical knowledge to assist the boys in Scouting techniques. In 1967 the Graaff-Reinet Scouts returned the compliment for on competing for the Walton Trophy at a camp in Port Elizabeth, they returned home with it. This was a considerable achievement, seeing that the local Scouts had very few opportunities of testing their skills in competitions.\n\n1967 saw the beginning of a new era for the Graaff-Reinet Scout Troop. A young student at the Teachers Training College, Mr Bruce Maree, offered his services to the Troop and was welcomed with open arms. He had come from East London with very laudable credentials. He had been a member of the 1st Cambridge Troop and had obtained his Springbok Badge.\n\nBy this time lack of continuity in Scoutmasters, 14 from 1910 to 1967, had become a way of life for the Graaff-Reinet Troop with all the ups and downs which it entailed. At that time no one realized that in this young man's hands lay the future destiny of the Graaff-Reinet Scouts.\n\n1970's - The Diamond Jamborally of the Graaff-Reinet Scout Troop tool place from 3 to 10 October 1971 with 309 boys and Scouters attending. At the A.G.M. held immediately after the Jamborally, the President, Mr Arthur Knott-Craig, made the following report. \"Mr Maree and his helpers are to be congratulated for executing one of the finest jobs I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing\"\n\n1972 ended on a very sad note with the sudden passing of the greatly loved and respected Chookie Geard, who had been District Commissioner for 27 years. His death came as a great shock to the members of the Graaff-Reinet Boy Scout Association as well as much further afield as he was well known and greatly respected by all. Scouting honours the memory of the Grand old Man of the Movement in the Eastern Cape and the manner in which he did whatever had to be done with zeal, efficiency and true loyalty to the Group. Chookie's name is mentioned at the first Scout Camp held in 1917 and in 1924 he attended the World Jamboree and was appointed Assistant Scoutmaster. He always retained an active interest in Scouting and during the war years, he became Scoutmaster after which he was appointed District Commissioner in 1945.\n\nIn June 1975 a function was held to bid farewell to Mr Maree, Kobus Olivier and William Smuts prior to their departure for Europe and the World Jamboree in Norway.\n\n1980's - During 1980 Mr Maree was ill with jaundice for a considerable time during the year, but thanks to the excellent training the Patrol Leaders had received, the senior scouts and members of the Committee helped to run the weekly programme. The 1981 A.G.M. again took the form of a dinner with 60 adults attending, at the same time celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the Graaff-Reinet Troop. An iced birthday cake embellished with the Scout emblem underlined by \"70 Years\" was cut and served with coffee, making a fitting end to a most enjoyable evening.\n\nIn 1982 the Troop were able, after an absence of ten years to again participate in the McClelland Trophy competition both winning it and becoming one of the top Eastern Province Camping and Outdoor Troops.\n\nIn March 1985, 21 Scouts took part in the Flame Run across South Africa to commemorate Mafikeng's Centenary. These Scouts represented Graaff-Reinet and were responsible for carrying the \"Flame\" over the section from Beaufort West to the Hutchinson/Murraysburg intersection, 100 km approximately. This excursion was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone participating in a predeparture Braai organised by Mr and Mrs Harry Myburgh in the Beaufort West caravan park on the Friday evening. Mr Nico Smuts supplied an excited but weary group with supper and a braai on his farm near Murraysburg on the Sunday. It was a really once-in-a-lifetime experience for everyone.\n\nAfter a hectic 1985, the year 1986 started off slowly with everyone concerned girding themselves for the task of celebrating the Bi-centenary of Graaff-Reinet and the 75th year of Scouting in Graaff-Reinet. At a meeting held to discuss in what way the 75-year-old local Scout Movement could help towards the Graaff-Reinet Bi-centenary celebrations, it was suggested that a history of the scouts be collated and published. This extremely onerous task which Mrs Rosemary Kingwill, secretary, volunteered to take on, resulted in a comprehensive history which was published in book form.\n\nIn 1987 Bruce Maree, Rowan Rose-Innes and Rodney Naude travelled to the 16th World Jamboree in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe 1990's was as busy as ever and the decade started off with a 1991 hike down the Fish River Canyon and also in that year Alfred Thornton attended the 17th World Jamboree in Korea. Two years later Alfred Thornton, Michael Featherstone and Bruce Maree attended the 1993 All American National Jamboree, near Washington, USA.\n\nAnother highpoint for the Troop was in 1994 when eight Graaff-Reinet scouts were presented with their Springbok badges at one occasion. They were Dallas Newton, Adrian Cumming, Stan Smit, Garth Kingwill, Quintin du Plooy, Barry Norval Michael Green and Steve Kroon. Garth Kingwill, Quintin du Plooy and Garth Kingwill attended the 18th World Jamboree held in the Netherlands.\n\nSilver Protea Award\n\nAn event of note was a special banquet held in the town hall on the 20 May 1995 when the Chief Scout of South Africa, Garnet de la Hunt, presented Bruce with the Silver Protea Award for his distinguished services to scouting. A total of 25 Springbok Scouts of previous years attended the function.\n\nIn 1998 Richard Collett, Russell Collett, John Finlaison and Bruce Maree attended the 19th World Jamboree near Santiago, Chile together with some 34 000 other scouts, making it one of the biggest World Jamborees ever held. The Jamboree tour included a month-long tour through several South American countries including a hike along the Inca Trails of Machu Picchu.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century the troop had 27 scouts over 14 years old, making it one of the biggest senior scout troops in the Eastern Cape. In 2007, World Scouting celebrated its 100-year centenary with the holding of the 21st World Jamboree in England and was attended by John Marais and Christopher-John Koopman.\n\nCentenary celebrations\n\nIn 2010 the Graaff-Reinet Troop celebration its 100th Birthday. More than 160 Springbok Scouts, Queen Scouts, current Scouts and other invited guests attended the 100th anniversary weekend of the Graaff-Reinet Scout Troop.\n\nThe weekend began at the Graaff-Reinet Club on Friday evening with a get-together cocktail evening.\n\nOn Saturday many of the visitors explored old haunts, and new ones in town or visited the structures built on the lawns in front of the Union High School hall. Saturday evening was a four-course dinner where several dignitaries addressed the gathering about their particular era in Graaff Reinet.\n\nA special church service was held from the St James Church on Sunday morning where Rev Buismann and Canon John Weldin, both past scouts, conducted the service.\n\nThe weekend concluded with a brunch on the deck of the Union from where most departed after a very successful weekend.\n\nIn 2020 the Group was 110 years old and had produced 83 King/Queen/Springbok Scouts. Bruce had been running the Troop for 52 years, but sadly, the year will be remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic which brought Scouting in Graaff-Reinet to a halt, but after the pandemic the Troop was restated.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM Bruce Maree stepped down as Troop Scouter and was honoured for his 55 years of volunteer service to the local Scouting movement. Since his arrival in 1967 there have been 74 Springbok Scouts and one of his Springbok Scouts, Mr Johan Vorster, has now been appointed as the 15th Troop Scouter of the Graaf-Reinet Scout Troop.\n\nSadly, Bruce passed away on the 31 December 2022.\n\nGroup Scoutmasters\n\nMuller (1931), Parker (1961)\n\nScoutmasters\n\nMuller (1931), Smit (1931/3), W H Hofmeyr (1938), Chookie Gear (1943), Alan Knott-Craig (1948), Shamley (1956), John Kennedy (1956), Mr Danie Greeff (1967), Bruce Maree (1967/2022), Johan Vorster (2023)\n\nCubmasters\n\nMiss Smith (1920), Mr Smit (1928), Miss Hillyard (1929), Mrs Johnstone (1955/8), Mrs Eleanor Kroon (1958), Mrs Chris Vorster (1966), Mrs Marie Muskett (1957)\n\nRover Leaders\n\nMax Smit (1930/1), N Robertson (1933)\n\nPort Alfred Sea Scouts (1940's) (1960's) (1988 - Active) - It is not known when the Group started up for the first time, but from a 1948 newspaper cutting it was reported that the Cubs and Scouts in Port Alfred were 'going ahead'. Miss Scott had in 1947 re-started the Pack and was the Cubmaster with over 15 Cubs. Mr. Tomlinson was the Scoutmaster and the boys were busy building canoes for use on the lovely Kowie River. Through the kindness of Mr. Grocott, of Grahamstown, the Scouts had a den on the banks of the river. In 1955 Mr Lionel Andrews was the Scoutmaster.\n\nAt some point it could have closed down or simply changed to a Sea Scout Group as a 1965 report refers to them as a 'new' Sea Scout group. In May 1967 Port Alfred was accepted into the larger and very active Port Elizabeth Sea Scout District Local Association.\n\nSadly, two years later in August 1969 the Troop had closed down as reflected a letter from the Local Association stating: - \"Dear Mrs. Slaughter, thank you for your letter of the 20th August 1969 advising that you have decided to close down the troop at Port Alfred, and the offer of the 16 ft. dinghy\".\n\nOn the 16th February 1988 the 1st Port Alfred Cubs, Scouts and Girl Guides started up again. Ten years later, a name that would be associated with the Group for nearly twenty years, Dot Fetherstonhaugh started with the group.\n\nIn January 2015 the local newspaper Talk of the Town reported that: - \"The new year is only two weeks old, and already it has been a busy time for Akela Dot Fetherstonhaugh of the Port Alfred Scout Troop, who has been very busy organising the new programme for this year. Moreover, the Port Alfred Scout Troop has moved premises. Their new base is at 72 George Street in the Dance Studio and meetings will take place every Friday afternoon, starting tomorrow, from 2.30 pm to 4.30 pm. Additionally the scouting headquarters has been busy changing the cubs/scout programme to suit present-day challenges while still offering the usual highlights such as life skills, hikes, camps and outdoor activities\".\n\nIn October the newspaper reported that: - \" The Port Alfred Sea Scouts, Cubs and Meerkats wish to thank the supporters who attended their 'Around the World in 100 Minutes show'. The Scouters were now Shelley Dollery, Magda Laubser and Dot Fetherstonhaugh.\n\nOn the 25 February 2018 a special ceremony was organised at the St Paul's Anglican Church to celebrate BP's birthday and the 40th anniversary of the movement in Port Alfred. They were now meeting in the St James Church Hall, Caxton Lane. In June the Group Scout Leader Dot Featherston 'went home' on the 24 June just two day short of 20 years of dedicated service to the group.\n\nUitenhage Scout Groups\n\nFrom old minutes and logbooks it would seem that the 1950's were the 'heydays' for Scouting in Uitenhage with five active Scout Groups and these were: -\n\n1st Uitenhage (Sons of England)\n\n2nd Uitenhage (Congregational)\n\n3rd Uitenhage (St. Katherine's)\n\n4th Uitenhage (Methodist)\n\n5th Uitenhage (Muir College)\n\nand Uitenhage Gilsprings which was created in June 1960 with the amalgamation of 2nd Uitenhage (Congregational) and 4th Uitenhage (Methodist).\n\nSadly, it seems that although the demographics did change, groups closed due to the lack of Adult Scouters. In July 1960 Mr. J Lobjoit was appointed District Commissioner and records show that in November 1961 there were 3 groups operating - SOE, St Katherine's and Gilsprings, but by the mid 1960's only the 1st Uitenhage Group was still active. As there was only one group still running it was felt that there was now no point in having a Local Association and this too closed.\n\n1st Uitenhage S.O.E. (Sons of England) (1928 - 2000's) - The 1st Uitenhage (SOE) Scout Group resulted from the amalgamation of the 1st Uitenhage Group, founded by Mr Marsh in 1911 and the SOE (Sons of England) Group. The group was founded in August 1928 and was what was called a Controlled Group, that is, it was not subject to any what might be called outside interference. Membership of the Group was limited to children of members of the S.O.E. and/or S.O.E. Woman's Association. The Group was initially \"controlled\" by a Committee of representatives from the S.O.E. and the S.O.E.W.A.\n\nThis went very well for a time, but ultimately it was found necessary to extend the membership to all children of English parents. There was no other Scout group in Uitenhage, so after a while application was made for \"outside\" children to be admitted, and permission was readily given for this to be done. They used the red and white scarf for English children, and a blue and white scarf for non-English, whilst the Scout and Cub Master wore Red, White and Blue so as to combine all.\n\nA Pack Scouter for many, many years and affectionately associated with 1st Uitenhage was Miss Edith Hayes. From their 1998 Annual General Meeting it was recorded that: - \"On Friday 4th September 1998 the 1st Uitenhage (SOE) Scout Group held its AGM and celebrated 70 years of Scouting, the group having been formed in August, 1928. This was a unique occasion for Scouting because, at the same event, Miss Edith Hayes received a 70-year bar to the Long Service Medal from the Scouting Association. The award was presented by the Cape Eastern Area Commissioner, Mr Ernie Pike.\n\nMiss Hayes began her long and dedicated service to Scouting in 1928 as an assistant to her mother who was the Akela of the Cub Pack. On her mother's retirement, Miss Hayes became Akela, a position that she held until 1953. Many of the older generation in Uitenhage will recall with fond memories their Cub Camps, outings to Port Elizabeth by train and the very successful trip to the Victoria Falls. Upon retirement as Akela, Miss Hayes became a member of the 1st Uitenhage (SOE) committee and gave freely of her time, always organizing the \"Teas\" for functions. She retired from the committee in 1991 but still remains a member of the Uitenhage Scouting Local Association.\" Miss Edith Hayes, passed away on Sunday 4th August 2013 at the age of 102 years at Rosa Munch House.\n\nFrom the 1968 AGM it was reported by the Pack Scouter that with 41 Cubs it was the best year they had ever had. The boys had worked hard and this had resulted in 48 proficiency badges and 5 Leaping Wolves. The Scouts too did well produce four Springbok Scouts.\n\nThe Group was also responsible for maintaining and improving the Gilsprings Campsite with the boys and committee putting in a lot of hard work.\n\nSkilkana\n\nThe 1st Uitenhage (SOE) Scout group will be remembered for hosting the annual Skilkana. It was introduced by Troop Scouter Athol Stow in 1988 as part of the Group's 60th Anniversary Celebrations. It was a fun day for Cubs and Scouts to test their skills at Rope Throw, Billy Boiling, Physical Fitness, Kim's Game, Water Relays, Knotting and much more. Scouts and Cubs from all over the Midlands participated and the participants all received a Skilkana blanket badge.\n\nGroup Scoutmasters\n\nJ M Erlank (1961), D Arnold (1961), J Eckley (1966/8), van Vuuren (1966/7)\n\nScoutmasters\n\nW Marsh (1948), K Young (1950-1961), Landma (1965), J Eckley (1967), Athol Stow (1988), Johan van Rooyen (Badger) (2001)\n\nPack Scouters\n\nMiss Edith Hayes (1936 – 1954), Mrs L Els (1963 – 1967), Hilda de Vroom (2002)\n\n2nd Uitenhage (Congregational) (1950's - 1960's) - In June 1960 the 2nd Uitenhage closed and merged with the 4th Uitenhage to form the Uitenhage Gilsprings Group.\n\n3rd Uitenhage (St. Katherine's) (1949 - 1964) - The Group was strong in the early 1950's producing two King Scouts and five Queen Scouts through the decade and in 1963 one Springbok Scout. At the start of 1964 it was reported that they had 33 members, but sadly in May the group closed down as there were no Scouters. Mr G Werth was in 1963 the Scoutmaster.\n\n4th Uitenhage (Methodist) (1953 - 1960) - Founded on the 13th August 1953, but in June 1960 it closed and merged with the 2nd Uitenhage to form the Uitenhage Gilsprings Group.\n\n5th Uitenhage Muir College (1970's) - At one point, possibly the 1970's, there was a Scout Group at the school.\n\nUitenhage Gilsprings (1960 - 1963) - This group was created in June 1960 when the 2nd Uitenhage (Congregational) Group and the 4th Uitenhage (Methodist) Group amalgamated to form the Uitenhage Gilsprings Group, but sadly by October 1963 it too had closed down. The Group Scoutmaster was Mr. R Reynolds, then Mr G Evens; the Scoutmaster Mr. W Shanks and then Mr R Laas. The Cubmaster Mrs. W Walker and the remaining Cubs (around 12) decided to continue to hold their meetings but at St Katherine's until all Cubs moved up to Scouts.\n\nUnfortunately, there is virtually no documentation in the Scout archives refering to Black Groups, but there is a record of the Scoutmaster Mr William Mgwali receiving a warrant in 1961 for a group at St Mary's and the Lukhanyiso Scout Group was officially launched on 22nd August 2000 when three Scout Leaders, two Cubs and seventeen Scouts were invested.\n\nUitenhage Camping Grounds\n\nThe Springs just outside Uitenhage, was a popular camping site and was often used by the Training Team for warrant courses. When SOE was the only Group in Uitenhage they put a considerable effort into maintaining and improving the Gilsprings Campsite with the boys and committee doing much of the hard work.\n\nPhotos of the 1st Uitenhage Scouts camping at the Springs campsite in the 1950's.\n\nBorder Division\n\nQueenstown with three Groups and King Williamstown with two Groups were the larger ‎inland towns that fell within the jurisdiction of the Border Division and consequently had the most groups and lasted the longest. In the very early days, Scouting also flourished in many of the smaller towns, but this did not last as a career promotion for a Scouter invariably meant moving away to another town. It was not uncommon for a group to close and then some years later to be restarted. In the 1940's there even groups in places like Aliwal North, Burgersdorp, Colesberg, Engcobo, Lady Grey Maclear and Molteno.\n\nFrom the late 1970's through to the early 1990's there were the nominally independent states or Bantustans of Transkei and Ciskei. However, for administrative purposes they were separate Districts within the Border Region\n\nThe following alphabetical list is derived from the very limited records in the Scout Archives, but it is quite possible that other groups did exist.\n\nAlice - They were active in the 1940's and 1950's and attended the BP Camporee in 1961 and 1963. It was reported that the Cubs were being run by a Mrs Monk and that the Troop had been re-started. In 1965 Scoutmaster was a Mr Doug Hume and the troop was still active in 1972.\n\nBarkley East - In the mid 1930's they had an active Rover crew and probably a Scout Troop. A Cub Pack was started in November 1990 and was very well run resulting in them being awarded a Silver Star two years later.\n\nButterworth - This Troop was active in the 1960's and participated in the 1966 Border efficiency Trophy that was held in King William's Town.\n\nCathcart - Active in the early 1950's and again in 1970's, their Scoutmaster was H Collett in 1972 and they attended the 1975 BP Camporee at Marina Glen in East London.\n\nFort Beaufort - Founded on 11 November 1932 and from the 1935 Border Bulletin it was reported that: - All Scouts are keen now, as usual, and they are working hard to get as many tests passed as possibly can be taken. Now and then a proficiency badge is presented to somebody while first and second class tests are very common. Our Jamboree Fund, started by our GSM now stands at a fairly high sum. We have received many donations, as well as £6 from a recent Scout dance. It is almost certain now that the Troop will be fully represented at the (1936 SA) Jamboree. The G.S.M. is organising a band; which will consist of bugles and a drum, among the musically-minded Scouts. The G.S.M. is giving special lessons a few days every week. A year later the news was that: - The chaps are very keen, and the Troop is making steady progress. We expect a few Cubs to come up from the local Wolf Cub Pack to the Troop next month, when our membership total will be raised to 24. The Wolf Cup Pack and the Girl Guides are also going ahead successfully.\n\nThey seem to have been active through the 1940's and early 1950's. No records were found as to the continuity of the group, but in 1963 and 1972 it was reported that Troop and Pack were doing well. Their Scoutmaster was Mr Peinke in 1972 and they attended the 1975 BP Camporee. In 1991 they had 15 cubs and 8 scouts, the Group Scouter was Jan Stark, the Troop Scouter Andrew Beckerling and the Pack Scouter Ian Trollip.\n\nIndwe Troop - Towards the end of 1935, as reported, talk was all about going to the first South African Jamboree in East London: - We are still scratching our heads to think of means of making up funds to pay towards the boys' expenses; but we are pleased to say that, so far, we have done very well indeed. Mr. Scott, one of Indwe's local townsmen, presented the Indwe Troop with a Troop Banner, and, oh! boy! how grateful we are to him for the presentation, and we are proud to be in possession of a banner of its kind. MR. Scott was a Kings Scout, and is still a keen supporter of the Movement. here in Indwe. Then after attending the Jamboree: - Well, ever since the Jamboree, we have been sort of off the map with regard to our monthly notes; but still our Troop lasts, and is pulling slowly in the good old way. We hope to be able to get a patrol of eight boys in trim for the North-Eastern Districts Shield Competition at Aliwal North in May. I don't for one moment say that we will be successful, however, but we hope to show a little of what we can do.\n\nWe regret that Mr. Vogt, our former Scout Master, has left us, but we all join in wishing him every success with his new Lady Frere Troop, of which he has been the founder. Mr. Vogt has good and keen material to commence with, and we hope to hear that things are just \"it\" with him and the Troop in general. The group was at some time revived as they attended the 1961 BP Camporee at Gilwood.\n\nKeiskamahoek - This Troop was active in the 1960's and participated in the 1966 Border efficiency Trophy that was held in King William's Town.\n\nKing Williams Town - 1st KWT - Very few records exist in the Scout Archives about this very strong and active group. They attended the very first 1959 Gilwell Trophy. Scoutmasters on record were, P Brunette (1964/66), Keith Nixon (1966) and C Bailey (1972). They attended the 1975 Border Efficient Competition.\n\n2nd KWT - It was reported that at the end of 1981 our Scoutmaster left. We now have Mr G. Wynne (LEO) as Scoutmaster and Mr R Steenbeek (FANG) as A.S.M. The Troop is progressing steadily. 4 Scouts are to attend the P L T U during the coming June /July school holidays. At the beginning of 1982 five Cubs joined the Troop. The whole Troop is in uniform and progressing well. They have a regular attendance of 18 Scouts. The Pack Scouter in 1982 was Mrs C Farrer and in 1986 was G A Classen. In June 1994 with dwindling numbers both the Troop and Pack Scouter resigned.\n\nKing William's Town were hosts to the Border Efficiency Trophy in 1966 and it took the form of a rugged 10 mile (16Km) hike through unknown wilds of the Yellowwoods River Valley and a standing camp at Gilhaven Scout Camp. The main objectives were to test the boys under challenging circumstances, requiring leadership, initiative and stamina. They all came through with 'flying colours'. Apart from troops in the greater East London area and the local troop, it was pleasant to see troops from Keiskamahoek and Butterworth.\n\nKomgha - In early 1963 Komgha had a Cub Pack of 24 boys and four Pack Scouters including Mesdames Donian and Warren and Mr Jack Arnold became their Scoutmaster. Sadly, by December the Pack was in recess with no Cubmaster. However, in 1964 it was reported that N Chemaly was listed as the Cubmaster.\n\nQueenstown - As one of the larger towns in the area, they for quite some time were able to support three groups. In 1963 these were 1st, 2nd and 5th Troops. The first group was being run by Scoutmaster John Morum with patrol camps being held on a local farm. In May 1982 the attendances at meetings were fairly well attended considering the number of boys involved in sport over most weekends. Mrs S Kempson was the Pack Scouter and they had two Cubs come up from the Pack at the beginning of the year and were hoping for another three Cubs from the Pack towards the middle of the year. A number of Scouts have been progressing well through their Blue and Red Achievements and a number of Proficiency Badges have also been earned. In 1991 they had 21 Cubs and 9 Scouts. 2nd Queenstown attended the 1962 BP Camporee and the 1964 Border Efficiency Trophy.\n\nQueenstown was the venue for the 1964 Border Efficiency Trophy competition when fourteen Scout Teams from Cambridge, East London, King William's Town and Queenstown participated. Starting in the centre of town it comprised a hike, which included a mountain climb, and a standing hike camp where the usual tests of skill and initiative were wrapped up in parcels labelled Skill-o-Rama and Survive-a-Rama. After their wearisome hike, with their packs on their packs the Scouts welcomed and appreciated the camp at the beautiful Queenstown Scout Camp site next to the Berry Reservoir.\n\nStutterheim - In July 1991 there were only 12 cubs and no scouts but there were plans to start a Scout Troop. Pack Scouter was Monica Scott. A 2nd Stutterheim was started in February 1992 and a month later entered the Gilwood Trophy. In 1982 it was recorded that they had had a busy time during the second term. A hike was organised for the P/L's and Seconds and they hiked the new Pirie Trail and thoroughly enjoyed it. There a new Scoutmaster, Buffalo, hiked with them and had a tough time keeping up with the boys. A Patrol also went down to East London for the Gilwood Trophy. The Patrol had quite a few young members and came third overall.\n\nStutterheim also became a popular venue in the 1970's for Scout competitions where use was made of \"Paxwold', the Girl Guide campsite. The nearby Kologha State Forrest was an ideal spot for hiking, with Dohne Peak as a goal. To quote from the 1968 report, 'A most enjoyable camp set in unsurpassed surroundings and with all facilities'.\n\n1st Umtata Troop, Transkei\n\nArchive documents reveal that they were a very active troop particularly during the 1960's and that they regularly participated in the BP Camporee and Border Efficiency Shield. Records show that they entered all the Camporee's from 1961 to 1975 and maybe even beyond.\n\nThey were one of Southern Africa's greatest hiking Troops, tackling the toughest stretches of the remote and beautiful Wild Coast and in 4 successive Toughees Hikes, they covered the entire 110 miles (177Km) length of the Wild Coast.\n\nIn 1965, 12 Scouts hiked from Port St. Johns to the Umtata River mouth. In 1966 28 Scouts hiked from Umtata River mouth to the Bashee River mouth. In 1967 38 Scouts hiked from Bashee River mouth to the Kei River mouth and in 1968, two outstanding expeditions were achieved.\n\nDuring June/July 1968 the 1st Umtata Court-of-Honour hiked from Port St. Johns to Port Edward on the Natal border of the Transkei — while the Juniors hiked from Bashee River to Umtata River mouth, with Scouts taking part in both hikes if they wished.\n\nItems of interest on the Senior expedition included a disused gold mine, the sites of various shipwrecks, and the spectacular and little-known Waterfall Bluff where rivers and streams plunge straight into the sea. The hikers faced many river crossings, and along one stretch no roads touch the coastline for 35 miles, and food and all other needs had to be toted.\n\nTop Scout awards:\n\nQueen Scout\n\n1956 John Phipson\n\nSpringbok Scout\n\n1968 Ronald King\n\n1972 Trevelyn Robinson\n\n1973 Bryan Kokott\n\n1974 Robert Kokott\n\nScoutmasters over this period were, N Brayton (1964), Mike Richards (1964), Mr N Drayton (1965) and Julian Sacke (1966/72).\n\nAck: Veld Lore Spring 1968"
