His father then decided to send Makhado and his mother to work for the settlers so that he could learn and know their strategies and tactics. Makhado then developed a close friendship with the whites for whom he was working for. At first Makhado was employed on a farm and later on he became one of the elephant hunters. When his father died, Makhado was away on a hunting trip. When he returned, he realised that Davhana (his older brother) had already declared himself a chief. Makhado had no option but to attack him. Then Makhado became the king of the Ramabulana dynasty. As a chief, Makhado did not want to hurt the white people, mainly because he worked harmoniously with them. As a result, Makhado was in a dilemma, as he was loved by both whites and his own native people. Unfortunately, the introduction of the native tax annoyed the Venda people to an extent that they decided to defy payment thereof. Eventually, the settlers started to harass them and intimidated them of their defiance. They attempted to attack Makhado in his strong hold at Swongozwi, but failed. Makhado went on an exepedition to fight all the settlers who were at Schoeman until they left for Marabastad. Makhado was able to deal with the forces which were led by Paul Kruger, General Piet Joubert and others and thereafter he became the ruler of the whole of the Soutspanberg region. Makhado was then the leader of the present Far North Region. It was because of this that he was nicknamed the \"Lion of the North\". It is alleged that chief Makhado died from drinking a medicine (poison) which was given to him by his white friends. Another allegation is that he died of an overdose of the medicine which was intended to assist him. Makhado was buried at his stronghold of Swongozwi, which still exists to date. Makhado will be remembered as the King who has unified the Ramabulana dynasty. The municipality of Makhado was named in recognition of his bravery in fight the colonialists. The municipality is of the view that Makhado was fighting for a just cause and that he did not hate any racial group.
