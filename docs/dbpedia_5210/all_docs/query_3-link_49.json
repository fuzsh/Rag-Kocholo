Hon members, I do appreciate the enthusiasm for the first Joint Sitting of the Fifth Parliament. I also appreciate ... [Interjections.] Hon Lekota! I was saying I appreciate the enthusiasm, the jubilance and the happiness about the Fifth Parliament.\n\nI also want to remind members that the House must at all times preserve its decorum. Members will remember that yesterday I undertook to come back to the House on the points of order that were made here. I still intend to come back to those points of order later today.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP\n\nPRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS\n\n(Resumption of debate)\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Hon Chairperson of the NCOP, hon President, hon Deputy President, hon members, and ladies and gentlemen, the ANC is very clear about the kind of society it wants to build. We want to build a national democratic society which is nonracial and nonsexist, in which the whole nation is united, and in which South Africa is prosperous and universally accepted everywhere in the world.\n\nThe ANC believes that its capacity as a vanguard movement for transformation, and its capability in leading an array of forces in transformative struggles, will ensure that we overcome the legacy of apartheid colonialism and also the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality. On that we are very clear.\n\nWe have been consistent in the articulation of our policies, our priority areas of service delivery, our continual call for social cohesion and nation-building, and our unwavering belief in creating a national democratic society where all South Africans work together and live together in harmony. We move South Africa forward by building a better life for all, not by creating an open opportunity society for some only. [Interjections.] For some only.\n\nThis open opportunity society is based on a conservative political philosophy, which provides an ideological defence of the capitalist system, and which is based on inherent talent and academic credentials, rather than on the human being and not looking at the gender of the person.\n\nWhat we infer from this open opportunity society thinking is that children from historically advantaged backgrounds tend to have an advantage or an edge in realising their inherent talent. Such a society believes an individual's lack of success or lack of opportunity is due to their own weakness and not the circumstances in which they find themselves and into which they were born, the system in which they grew up.\n\nIn a country such as ours, where decades of entrenched inequalities doom the lives of black children even before they are born, this open opportunity society thus seeks to ensure that the privileged merely reproduce their success, even if their children lack talent. [Applause.]\n\nThey continue to punt an ideology of choice. The DA's subscription to choice ignores the acknowledgement of where we are as a young country emerging out of a horrific system, which was termed \"a crime against humanity\". [Interjections.] They talk of expanding choice, and I quote what the DA say about their vision in this regard, which is where the state –\n\nif it provides services, ... must seek to expand choice, not determine choices; it must not simply \"deliver\" to a passive citizenry, which takes what it is lucky enough to get, but must allow the citizenry to determine which opportunities it requires; it must encourage independence, not dependence.\n\nThis talk appeals to a quick-fix type of solution for our society. [Interjections.]\n\nYou see, the hon members on my left want to hear what they like. When they do not like what they hear, they make a noise, so that other people can't hear. [Interjections.] Wait; just listen, and fasten your seat belts. [Interjections.]\n\nPeter Malpass, a critic of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's housing policy, argued, and I quote:\n\nChoice is a weasel word, a seductive device concealing that what is really afoot in the opportunity society is promotion of the interests of the better off and toleration of wider social inequality, to the further disadvantage of the poor.\n\nThe DA's neoliberalism, its narrow focus on individualism, its articulation of economic interests on behalf of the privileged class and the reduction of taxes for this group, its speedier privatisation and a flexible labour market clearly show its inability to comprehend the challenges we face as a country today.\n\nLet me go back to the concept of ideology. Some define ideology as \"determining the natural attitude of a party towards every public question\". In this vein, the ANC's response to every public question will be to address the challenges facing our people, \"seeking to redress the wrongs of the past\". But what is the ideology of the DA?\n\nThe DA's entire approach to the recent national elections was rooted in its opposition to everything ANC. [Interjections.] It based its election posters and election messages on attacking the integrity and the person of the President of our Republic. [Interjections.] It appropriated our struggle icons, selectively focusing on certain aspects of our struggle that were palatable to them.\n\nIt still has no understanding of race and of the deep fissures racism created in our society. The DA showed this by playing the quotas game in the manner in which they chose their leaders. There is no democracy in this organisation called the DA. [Applause.] [Interjections.] It insults our people by making them believe that placing token black faces among its leaders will sway the voters their way. [Applause.]\n\nIt denigrates our people who voted for the ANC by calling them \"dogs\"! How dare you, Mr Waters! [Interjections.] The people of Lwandle would not have been thrown out on the street in the rain if they had voted for the DA. [Interjections.] That is why it was easy for them to do that. [Interjections.]\n\nAnd while the DA's manifesto, and consequently their entire campaign, were rich in anti-ANC rhetoric, they lacked a sound explanation of the DA's position on land reform and black economic empowerment. [Interjections.]\n\nThe fact is that, despite focusing their entire campaign on smearing our President and vilifying the ANC, the DA could manage only a 5% marginal increase in their vote. [Interjections.] All of this shows that the DA cannot loosen the grip, the influence and the leadership of the ANC on the majority of the people of South Africa. [Applause.] [Interjections.] Their policies clearly do not appeal to the majority of the people. Who will they target in 2019? [Interjections.]\n\nHON MEMBERS: We are coming. [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: They say, \"We are coming.\" What that means is that they are going to hire consultants to tell them who to target next. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]\n\nThe ANC believe in consultation and collectivism. Our leaders are democratically elected by the people. [Interjections.] We do not impose leaders on the rest of our membership. We do not parachute individuals into leadership for window-dressing and photo opportunities. [Applause.] Such political naïveté, manipulation of its own members, opportunism in exploiting the very real concerns and challenges facing our people, and high-handedness in dealing with criticism, point to subjective and weak leadership.\n\nAnd, and lest we forget, the anointed Leader of the DA in Parliament, who miraculously holds court now, has been imposed on the rest of them by his simply having been migrated. [Interjections.] [Applause.] One of their own former spin doctors, who now claims to be a respectable journalist, mnr Van Onselen, had this to say about the anointed one. Let me read it. Listen! [Interjections.] [Laughter.] Van Onselen says the following. These are Van Onselen's words, not mine. He says:\n\nIt is hard to determine what is authentic about the man: his lines are crafted by wordsmiths, his turns of phrase marked by safe clichés and truisms. His arguments are shaped by opinion polls, his events are orchestrated by strategists and his personal ideological world view is protected from critical interrogation.\n\n[Interjections.] That will tell you just how authentic and true the DA are. The DA expects our people to trust them and believe in them, but they themselves turn around and speak with forked tongues. [Interjections.] They flip-flop and contradict each other on employment equity. And, again, in relation to broad-based black economic empowerment, they clearly show how unprincipled they are.\n\nThey talk about corruption as if their hands are squeaky-clean. [Interjections.] Hon members, go to the website of the Oudtshoorn municipality in the Western Cape, and draw the affidavit of a DA councillor who submitted his own evidence in court. Attached to the affidavit are e-mails from the DA Leader, the hon Helen Zille, who told the councillor not to co-operate with the investigation into corruption of the DA in Oudtshoorn. [Interjections.]\n\nThe same e-mails ... [Interjections.] No, they are quiet now because I am telling the truth. [Interjections.] They know. [Applause.] The affidavit to the councillor, which he attached, says: \"I am going to send your leader, the hon James Selfe, to come and talk to you and tell you, we leaders, what we want.\" The affidavit in court ... [Interjections.] No, don't worry. After the court, we have a Minister of local government who knows about money. [Interjections.] He will tell you where to get off. [Interjections.]\n\nAs if that is not enough, hon President, when that councillor refused to listen to the orders ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, members! Allow the person on the podium to finish his speech. You are allowed to heckle, but not to stop the speech.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Hon Chairperson, as if this were not enough, when he refused to honour the instruction, they brought him before a disciplinary committee. The councillor then made these comments. \"Our party says we must fight corruption. I am exposing corruption. I was told it did not matter who was involved in corruption; we must expose him. Charge me if you think I'm wrong.\" [Interjections.] It was nice when they were talking about us; now we are talking about them. [Interjections.] We are asking a simple question: Are you squeaky-clean? [Interjections.]\n\nI'm asking another question. Now I'm really asking you a question. [Interjections.] I am asking this question. In 2010 the honourable Henry Kissinger visited South Africa, and had an audience with the honourable Premier of the Western Cape. It was a private meeting. Now the honourable Premier wants to score points and raise those issues as if they were an endorsement. In the conversation they had Henry Kissinger said to her, according to what she wrote, that she was very good, that her project was of international significance, that other people who had tried it before her had failed, and that she had made tremendous progress. I ask the question: What is this internationally significant project that the DA is running in South Africa on behalf of Henry Kissinger? [Interjections.]\n\nThe ANC, a 102-year-old tried and tested organisation, will not sacrifice our people on the altar of this party, because we would then be endangering the progress we have made until now. We would also be endangering the future of South Africa. [Applause] South Africa will never be colonised again. [Applause.]\n\nThe ANC has always supported the clause on land in the Freedom Charter, and I quote:\n\nTHE LAND SHALL BE SHARED AMONG THOSE WHO WORK IT! Restriction of land ownership on a racial basis shall be ended ...\n\nThis emanated from the very real consultations with the people during the Freedom Charter campaign in 1955. Addressing land dispossession was a shared concern of all those who dreamed of a better life and a better South Africa. Land in the Western Cape is owned by, and this is in the words of Madam Helen Zille, ...\n\nAn HON MEMBER: The hon Premier of the Western Cape.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: The honourable Premier of the Western Cape. [Interjections.] The land in the Western Cape is in the hands of the voters of the Western Cape. The landless of the Western Cape are, equally, the voters of the DA. Now, when we come to this House and present Bills for restitution in terms of land reform, the madam in the same article I read claims that the ANC ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Are you rising on a point of order, sir?\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Yes, it's a point of order, Madam Chairperson. We've had a previous ruling in Parliament that premiers are to be respected in this House. I would ask that the speaker refer to the premier of the Western Cape as \"the honourable Premier of the Western Cape\" and not \"Madam\". [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Yes, yes. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I will not do it again. Sorry. [Interjections.] No, I can't ask you to respect our President and not respect your leader. No, I will not do that. I'm sorry.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Chief Whip, please round up also.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Here is my point, Comrade President. This article specifically says that when you bring laws to this House to restore land to the homeless, especially the descendants of the Khoi and the San, she says it is a divide-and-rule tactic on your part. But she does not say so to that constituency. She says we are pitting the landless and those who possess the land in the Western Cape against each other. But are we going to stop asking for the land to be handed back to the people as instructed by the Freedom Charter? No. Comrade President, the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform will come back here to this podium and explain the programmes we are going to embark on in regard to land. [Time expired.] [Interjections.] [Applause.]\n\nMs D KOHLER-BARNARD\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY\n\nMs D KOHLER-BARNARD: Chairperson of the NCOP, the President stated in his address that the murder rate had gone down over the past five years. The truth is that the murder rate went up last year, as did attempted murder, aggravated robbery, residential burglaries, fraud, carjackings and theft from our motor vehicles. Stretching statistics from the past to try to twist today's truth into a good story is political claptrap. We are back up to 45 murders, 182 sexual offences, 436 robberies and 718 burglaries from homes every single day.\n\nWhile the scant two lines on crime ...\n\nMs T V TOBIAS: Madam Chairperson, may I request your good self to ask the member to speak slowly so that we can hear her because it is like she ... [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Ms Kohler-Barnard, please continue.\n\nMs D KOHLER-BARNARD: I suggest that the hon member alters the hearing aid dial.\n\nWhile the scant two lines on crime in the speech paid little attention to the realities of crime experienced by those without a phalanx of bodyguards, the truth is that we need a system to deter, prevent and deal effectively with crime – a system where a crime survivor or the family of a murder victim has easy access to the perpetrator's arrest date, the court date, the court outcome, the incarceration period and the date of release.\n\nInstead, to quote former Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development Johnny de Lange, our criminal justice system is \"dysfunctional\". Well, after he told that truth he was bounced downwards and is, of course, no longer in Parliament.\n\nNow, \"dysfunctional\" is a strong word. However, to those who await justice it's just not strong enough. They wait year after year as this country fails them. There is chaos, caused by the SAPS officer who either fails to arrest the perpetrator, or who sells the docket to him or her, or who bungles the case, by failing to collect evidence or by losing it.\n\nWe know, too, that countless numbers of our citizens sit for years behind bars, unable to pay R50 bail, as their cases fail time after time to make it to court. Our SAPS today is given useless but stylish Gucci-lifestyle Ministers and national police commissioners, but not given equipment, water, electricity, or well-trained officers with firearm or driver's licences.\n\nAdded to all of that, the criminality audit of the SAPS I've been asking for for over seven years was finally done. Inexplicably, it was stopped at the end of 2010, but it did prove that 1 448 SAPS members have criminal records. The majority of these members committed the crimes whilst in the police.\n\nNow the National Police Commissioner, NPC, has bungled the process. Instead of simply firing them, she set up what the Labour Court has determined were illegal fitness boards of inquiry to look into the matter. The NPC didn't have the power to convene such boards and this time she has a veritable ostrich egg on her face, as we sit with murderers, rapists, bigamists and hijackers armed and at your service at a station near you. [Interjections.]\n\nThe bungle in announcing the appointment of a Gauteng provincial commissioner with a criminal record and pending charges was massive, but this is far, far worse. Even then, Mr President, you saw fit to laugh at my request in this House that a commission of inquiry be established to determine the root causes of police brutality. You said it wasn't necessary, but the families of, for example, Andries Tatane, the 34 murdered during the protests at Marikana, Mido Macia, Mike Tshele, Osia Rahube and Lerato Seema, all disagree.\n\nThe former Minister of Police was by all accounts fired from the job because he failed to hold up a big enough umbrella to protect you from the dreaded Nkandla fallout ... [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, members!\n\nMs D KOHLER-BARNARD: ... and Gupta-itis, but his failure to re-establish the specialised units so ignominiously done away with by Jackie Selebi should have been the real reason. [Interjections.]\n\nThis is the same Selebi who owes us taxpayers R17,4 million, of which the NPC has failed spectacularly to recover even a cent. Meanwhile, the fact that Selebi and Schabir Shaik are part of the \"played-dying-and-today-playing-golf club\" is yet another example of the fact that the criminal justice system just isn't doing the job taxpayers pay it billions to do.\n\nThe fact that the criminal case into the today \"honourable\" Bheki Cele, in relation to the Public Protector's extensive report that determined that he had acted unlawfully and improperly, and was guilty of maladministration, and had him fired from his last job, has seemingly gone nowhere since we laid the charges, is yet another case in point.\n\nMr President, there is no space for political interference in our criminal justice system – none! Consider for a moment the fact that the DA's Shadow Minister of Justice, Glynnis Breytenbach, has had to call for a probe, not only into the process followed in appointing the current National Director of Public Prosecutions, but also into whether or not the National Prosecuting Authority is being manipulated to advance political ends. It is also a concern to the DA that Mr Nxasana might indeed be a fit and proper person to hold the office, but is being manipulated and undermined in his functions to advance political ends.\n\nMr President, if you were the CEO of an international conglomerate looking for investment opportunities and you were aware of our crime statistics in our strike-ridden land, would you invest here? Would you be the one to open a factory which would gainfully employ 10 000 South Africans, or would you simply look elsewhere? If you knew that the Minister now removed from Police and the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, now removed from Parliament, had bludgeoned through a section of the Private Security Industry Regulation Amendment Bill that determines the expropriation of foreign-owned private security companies, rising from 51% to 100% thereof, would you want to invest here or would you simply look elsewhere? Mr President, for the sake of our country, don't sign it.\n\nWhat we need is a police service equally inspirational and aspirational, where parents hope, as they do in so many other countries, that their child will marry, if not a doctor, then a police officer. What we need is a safe and secure environment to run our businesses and our homes and our lives, and to attract foreign investment until we are flooded with job opportunities, we turn our economy around, we and avoid another recession.\n\nToday, colleagues, we are witness to the turning over of a new leaf. Please, hon members, let it not be a fig leaf. [Applause.]\n\nMs K LITCHFIELD-TSHABALALA\n\nMs D KOHLER-BARNARD\n\nMs K LITCHFIELD-TSHABALALA: Hon Chairperson and hon President of South Africa, the ruthlessness with which white monopoly power exploits black people, especially Africans, can never be overstated. In the words of one of the biggest white monopoly capitalists, Amschel Rothschild, uttered in the 18th century, \"Let me issue and control a Nation's money and I care not who makes its laws.\" What he was merely stating was that in a situation where a government elects not be in charge of its economic resources and thereby, by default, not its credit system and money, capital will always bulldoze political power.\n\nThis statement uttered in the 18th century unfortunately still holds water today. It explains the madness with which white monopoly capital continues to exploit our people, and I will give three examples.\n\nIt makes no sense that Lonmin agrees to pay an equivalent of R80 000 to Australian workers who are rock drill operators but refuses even to concede to a mere R12 500 to South Africans. [Applause.]\n\nIt also explains the madness in how God has blessed this country with vast mineral resources that continue to create what are regarded as menial jobs in South Africa but technical jobs elsewhere. This is in a country where every year, we make the promise to create good and sustainable jobs.\n\nThe third example relates to the fact that, despite earnest advances that have been made to create what is called a better life for all, it has been piecemeal and slow. Hence, according to Statistics SA this year, 20,2% still live in extreme poverty, 45% in what is called moderate poverty.\n\nIt is against this background, hon President, that we in the EFF are inimical to the profits that white monopoly capital continues to extract in South Africa. [Applause.] We are the two-thirds majority required to change the Constitution and put white monopoly capital exactly where it belongs – under political power. [Applause.] In that scenario, we shall continue to expand rapid economic transformation and deliver the better life for all our citizens without having to apologise to anybody. Asijiki! Economic freedom in our lifetime! [Time expired.] [Interjections.]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nMs K LITCHFIELD-TSHABALALA\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING: Hon Chairperson of the NCOP, Your Excellency President Jacob Zuma, hon Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, and fellow South Africans, we meet here today, three days after the commemoration of the 38th anniversary of the 1976 youth uprising. On this day we remember young men and women of courage and resilience, who defined themselves differently from the rest, whose bravery and valour became evident when they took to the streets to demonstrate against the education policies of the apartheid regime. Today we say with Thomas William Parsons:\n\nOn thy grave the rain shall fall from the eyes of a mighty nation!\n\nWe apportion glory to them and duty to ourselves to serve our people well and not to abandon the democratic project achieved in 1994.\n\nThe fifth term of Parliament is now democratically constituted. The people of our country have spoken. The movement of the people, the ANC, has been affirmed and positioned as the strategic vehicle to lead our people during the second phase of the transition.\n\nThis victory has been achieved against the unfounded views of analysts, the media and opposition parties, who co-opted each other against the majority of the people of South Africa. The pronouncement of our people cannot be underestimated or undermined by either the political parties present here, the media or even the overnight analysts.\n\nWe too, as the ruling party, have an obligation to honour this mandate and deliver as expected. Indeed, our position is that of privilege and responsibility – the privilege to serve, and the responsibility to serve well.\n\nIn the lead-up to the general elections, we moved from village to village and house to house, interacting with the masses of our people.\n\nWe interacted with the young people of South Africa, who assured us that they would indeed come out in great numbers to define their role, take control of their lives, and steer the body politic. They said that they would never again be reduced to being mere spectators in the unfolding democratic processes.\n\nThey also told us that they were aware that for economic freedom to be achieved in their lifetime, we would need to arm them with relevant and requisite skills, as this would enable them to contribute more positively to the development of the country.\n\nWe have listened to our fellow young South Africans. We are satisfied and humbled by their resolve never again to be confused and blinded by reckless and uncalculated calls and pronouncements from some dark forces and doomsayers with regard to economic freedom and job creation. [Applause.] Our young people now know better, that this current epoch dictates that if we are to deal with the contemporary challenges facing them, we will need interventions of a special type, interventions that are clearly defined, shaped and driven by no one other than themselves.\n\nAs we mark the fact that we are 20 years into our democracy, we equally note the significant progress achieved in building an expanded, effective and integrated post-school education system. This was ushered in by the approval of the White Paper for Post-School Education and Training by Cabinet in November 2013, the paper having been published in January this year.\n\nWe are happy that education and training continues to receive priority under the administration of the President, and we dare not falter in executing our task and in turn betray the overwhelming mandate given to the ANC by the masses of our people, especially the poor and the working class.\n\nSince 2009, with the establishment of the Department of Higher Education and Training, the state has sought to discharge its mandate by developing a more harmonised approach to postschooling that spans a range of education and training provisioning in adult, further and higher education, and skills training.\n\nThe National Skills Development Strategy III, for example, changed direction from its predecessor in favour of institutional learning. We have repositioned the Setas to work more closely with our universities and FET colleges, now called technical, industrial, vocational and entrepreneurship, Tvet, colleges. We have also started funding professional, vocational, technical and academic learning programmes. Whilst opportunities for education and training have opened up, success leading to final graduation has predictably needed time to catch up.\n\nThe period after 2009 also saw a renewed focus on intermediate skills, especially artisan and technical-related skills. In 2012 the President announced his intention to embark on a massive infrastructure building programme. Our focus on artisanal and technical skills will therefore assist our young people to take advantage of the job opportunities that the infrastructure building programme is presenting.\n\nWith our building upon the initial Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition efforts, artisan numbers began a steady increase on a year-to-year basis and by the 2012-13 financial year 15 277 artisans had qualified through the system.\n\nThe National Development Plan requires that by 2030 at least 30 000 qualified artisans are produced per year. Our department is on a serious mission to champion artisanship as a career of choice and a lucrative career pathway for consideration by the youth, if indeed we are serious about improving their employment prospects.\n\nIn pursuit of the above, 2013 was declared as the Year of the Artisan, and in February this year we declared 2014 to 2024 the Decade of the Artisan, basing the latter on the lessons learnt from the 2013 Year of the Artisan advocacy programme. Chairperson, 19 000 competent artisan candidates are being targeted nationally for March 2015 in order to come closer to achieving the target set by the National Development Plan.\n\nThe revitalisation of state-owned enterprises to produce more skills is one of the measures used by our department to massify our efforts in artisan development. This massification will see us revitalising our working relationship with state-owned enterprises in order to implement skills development projects and create a national talent pool.\n\nWe have just signed a memorandum of understanding with Denel for an artisan development support project to the value of R42,5 million. With this project Denel will seek to increase its apprentice intake during 2014, again supporting the objectives of the National Development Plan. We have also signed an MOU with Transnet in which R175 million was allocated for the training of artisans. The project is expected to be implemented over a three-year period. [Applause.]\n\nIn his address on Tuesday evening, the President mentioned the two new universities that we are building. Indeed, we have now established the two new universities, namely, the Sol Plaatje University in the Northern Cape and the University of Mpumalanga in the province of Mpumalanga. This is a major milestone in the transformation and expansion of the higher education sector, particularly because Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape were the only provinces without universities.\n\nThese are two new universities in postapartheid South Africa established by President Zuma's administration. [Applause.] This debunks the message that was spread by some in the opposition that the ANC-led government had deviated from the Freedom Charter. In line with section 29(1)(b) of the Constitution of South Africa, Minister Nzimande opened the doors of learning at the Sol Plaatje University in February this year, whilst I had the privilege of opening the doors of learning at the new University of Mpumalanga, with the first intake of 160 students. Twenty registered for agricultural studies at the Nelspruit campus and 140 registered for education studies at the Siyabuswa campus. This is clear testimony to the fact that the spirit of the Freedom Charter runs in our veins and is therefore part of our DNA. [Applause.]\n\nHon Malema, they may seem like glorified high schools in your world, but I know of no high school offering degrees or even national diplomas. It has never happened in the life of humankind that a university has been established today and has full enrolment tomorrow or even almost immediately. We are available to assist the hon member with detailed information on how an institution of higher learning is established, not just here but everywhere else in the world, for his own comprehension. [Interjections.] [Applause.]\n\nIt is safe to say, the new infrastructure for these two universities will be built to accommodate the increasing number of students over the coming years.\n\nFurthermore, a new comprehensive health and allied sciences university, the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, was established as a juristic person in May 2014. The interim council of the university, together with the council of the University of Limpopo, are in the process of finalising a protocol for ensuring the unbundling of the Medunsa campus from the University of Limpopo to enable its incorporation into the new Health Sciences University with effect from 1 January 2015.\n\nCurrently, our postschool education and training institutions are not distributed evenly across the country, with rural areas being poorly served. In order to correct this anomaly, the President announced in 2012 the allocation of R2,5 billion for infrastructure expansion and refurbishment of college campuses. I am happy to inform you that construction of these campuses is under way and the first student intake in the new campuses is expected to begin next year.\n\nThe National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Nsfas, which is government's primary tool to ensure access for poor students to postschool education, has assisted 1,4 million students since 1991 and has grown from R400 million in 1999 to R9,7 billion in the current academic year.\n\nYesterday a call was made for the President to increase the allocation to Nsfas, but this had been done. The President increased university bursary funding from R2,2 billion in 2010, benefiting 148 387 students, to R7,6 billion in 2014, targeting 235 000 students. [Applause.] College bursary funding was increased from R318 million in 2010, benefitting 61 703 students, to R2,1 billion in 2014, targeting 233 958 Tvet college students, meaning more students will be able to access funding for tuition, accommodation and travel allowances. Of course, there is a need for more funding as we continue to see the demand of those wishing to access higher learning increase.\n\nFee-free education will, without doubt, be implemented and that work has already started, with 96% of our students at Tvet colleges receiving full bursaries and studying for free. This, too, will have to come in phases.\n\nThe linking of education with the workplace has become one of our priorities, as the White Paper calls for this in the design of training systems, including curricula. This requires close co-operation between education and training providers and employers, especially in those programmes providing vocational training.\n\nOther interventions include the Setas'signing partnership agreements with Tvet colleges and universities of technology, as they are strategically located in bridging the gap between employers and education institutions. This drive alone has led to more workplace opportunities for workplace-based learning and experience over the 2013-14 financial year.\n\nWe have continuously held the view that young people need skills that will enable them to enter the job market. One of the most effective measures to arm people to overcome the remains of our past is through training and equipping them for independent and sustainable livelihoods and also for the labour market needs.\n\nSelf-sufficiency and independence is the only way to go. Our government prioritises self-reliance for every citizen and as a department we have discovered that there are quite a number of training activities taking place in various skills development centres across the country. However, it would seem there has been a lack of strategic coordination of the operations in these facilities. Our intention now is to make effective and productive use of these facilities to meet the needs of the country. As a result, the department is currently developing a concept paper for the development of a clear strategy for our skills centres.\n\nConcurrent to the above, we have identified a need for the construction of more skills development centres on a massive scale to cater for the increasing skills demand. The skills centres to be built are expected to speed up training of local communities to meet the local economic needs. We have also prioritised the area of career guidance and dissemination of information to our young people to avoid the skills mismatch that we find in the country.\n\nThe House will agree with me that education is a central task requiring the involvement of the whole of society, and I therefore put a challenge to all members of this House to take a personal interest in this, an interest that must extend to their respective areas of influence in the country, so that we achieve a multifaceted response to the skills deficit. Those fellow members of the House who seem to have a stranglehold on industry players must equally play their part in encouraging industry to come out of disengagement and take part in education, for the quality of our education can only be as good as the industry's interest and participation therein.\n\nThe sentiment expressed by hon Malema yesterday, with regard to sending students to other countries, finds expression in already existing programmes in government. Just last year we managed to send 10 students to Russia to study in the following fields: ... [Interjections.] ... Ocean Engineering, Physiology, Applied Mathematics and bachelor's degrees in Engineering Exploitation of Flying Machines and Engines. We are sending an additional five in August this year to study Nuclear Engineering. [Interjections.]\n\nLast year we also sent 35 students to China to study in the following fields: Management Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Automation, International Trade and Industrial Economics, Rail Engineering, and Agricultural Economics and Management, as well as International Commerce. An additional 80 students will be leaving for China in September this year. [Applause.]\n\nIn 2013 we managed to send 30 students to the World Maritime University in Sweden to study for postgraduate degrees in the following areas: Maritime Law and Policy, Maritime Safety and Environmental Administration, Port Management and Marine Environmental Studies. We are sending an additional 10 in August this year.\n\nWe will also be sending another 15 to Poland to study Transport Engineering. [Interjections.] This was, of course, after our visit to Poland with former Deputy President Motlanthe early this year. Chairperson, 10 students will be leaving our shores for Ireland to study Business Management and Human Rights Law this year.\n\nI had an opportunity to meet with these students before they left the country last year and I cannot even begin to describe their excitement and willingness to fly the South African flag high.\n\nThe numbers above are a demonstration of an ongoing programme, and not a wish list. [Applause.] They are, of course, also coupled with the 2 700 medical students in Cuba and another 100 in Romania studying Veterinary Science.\n\nThe above illustrates some of the programmes and projects of the department, and is a mirror of a government at work. Therefore, Mr President, when you are advised to take a break due to presenting signs of exhaustion, those of us working closely with you comprehend this medical advice, because we know the work you have been involved in.\n\nHowever, those who are far from reality and those who choose to pretend that you are not a human being and therefore are not expected to be exhausted, prefer to ignore reality and wish the worst for the situation. During this process they expose themselves, showing how shallow their own trajectory is that they have defined. [Applause.]\n\nThe leader of the EFF intimated yesterday that he did not grasp the essence of the President's speech. Hon Malema is a student at Unisa, and I am therefore pleased to inform you that I have taken it upon myself to supply his Political Science lecturer with a copy of the President's state of the nation address. [Laughter.] [Applause.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! [Interjections.]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING: Hon Chairperson, our higher education system prides itself on producing quality products and therefore it would be a blemish on my reputation as the Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training if one of my future graduates failed to comprehend and understand such an important public communication by the President. [Laughter.]\n\nMr President, we carry with us a sense of urgency as members of your executive because we want to ensure that this administration is remembered not so much for its grand plans and noble intentions, but for its contributions to the upliftment of our people. We dare not fail. I thank you very much. [Applause.]\n\nMr P W A MULDER\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nDr P W A MULDER: Chairperson, I want to start with the story of the chief executive of a big organisation who retired. He gave his successor three envelopes. His advice to his successor was, \"When you experience the first crisis, open the first envelope. After a year there was a crisis. The new executive opened the first envelope. It read, \"Blame it on your predecessors.\" He did it, it worked and he survived the crisis.\n\nSome months later there was a second crisis. He opened the second envelope. It read, \"Reorganise.\" He reorganised the organisation and he survived again. [Interjections.]\n\nChairperson, that member ... [Inaudible.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Malema, please respect the speaker at the podium! Continue hon member.\n\nDr P W A MULDER: Go and conduct the debate outside, not here – it is wasting my time. [Laughter.]\n\nSome months later, in the second crisis, the executive opened the second envelope and it said, \"Reorganise.\" He reorganised the organisation and he survived again. When the third crisis occurred, he opened the third envelope. It read, \"Prepare three envelopes.\"\n\nHon President, the present economic crisis is not the second or third crisis of this government, but the hundredth. You've already blamed your predecessors. You've reorganised government. You should have prepared three envelopes long ago.\n\nDo members remember the Fitch credit rating downgrade in January 2013? In the two weeks following the downgrade foreigners sold R3,2 billion's worth of South African bonds. In that January alone foreign investors sold R2,2 billion's worth of South African shares. That severely affected our economy and many jobs were lost. Those are the realities. Is it too early at this moment to calculate the effects of the latest downgrade?\n\nFor government it cannot be business as usual. On my way to Parliament every day I drive past people sitting on street corners asking me for a job, with their eyes. These are strong, healthy men and women with despair and hopelessness in their eyes. They are fathers and mothers who have to support their families. In their own eyes they are failing their families. We can solve this problem and we can create jobs, and dignity will return to these men and women.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nIn die staatsrede is geen nuwe of oorspronklike voorstelle oor hoe die ekonomiese groeikoers verbeter kan word om werk te skep, deur die agb President gemaak nie. Behuising en beter leeftoestande vir mynwerkers is voorgestel om 'n herhaling van die staking te voorkom. Dit is belangrik maar dit spreek nie die kern probleme aan nie. Niks verhinder dat ons môre 'n soortgelyke staking in die goudbedryf kan kry nie.\n\n'n Voorstel in die staatsrede oor hoe die aarbeidswetgewing gewysig kan word sou positief gewees het. Ek wil graag hê dat iemand vir my moet verduidelik waarom die aarbeidswette nie so gewysig kan word dat vakbondlede 'n geheime stemming kan hou voor 'n staking nie. Dit alleen sou 'n verskil gemaak het.\n\nEnglish:\n\nThis is hon President Zuma's last term. I have seen five Presidents come and go in this Assembly. In their last term all Presidents worry about their legacy. That is normal. Zizi Kodwa, the ANC spokesperson, said that in this term the President would be emphasising economic freedom and land issues. Hon President, you are making a mistake if you think you will succeed in this as your legacy in the next couple of years. You are setting yourself up to fail.\n\nIn 1948, before I was born, the election was won by the Afrikaners. However, it was not whites against blacks. Rather, it was an Afrikaner victory over the English, specifically a pro-British approach. [Interjections.] As a young and angry man, I argued with my father for hours that the Afrikaners had political power but not economic power, and that we should be freed from the Oppenheimers' grip on the economy, just like a certain, sort of arrogant young member argued here yesterday. The reality is that Afrikaners never obtained economic power. We could establish our own institutions, such as Volkskas and Sanlam, but ... [Interjections.]\n\nMr J A MNGXITAM: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can this man say when he is going to return our land, because he represents land thieves. That is what we want to hear, not this long story. He's a land thief!\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, go back to the podium please. Go back to the podium. Hon Mngxitam, firstly withdraw the words, \"this man\", which you used to refer to hon Mulder, and secondly, no member of this House may be referred to as a \"thief\".\n\nMr J A MNGXITAM: Chairperson, he represents people who stole our land. He is a land thief ... [Interjections.] ... and of course he's ... [Inaudible.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Mngxitam, withdraw those two statements!\n\nMr J A MNGXITAM: I withdraw them.\n\nMr J S MALEMA: Madam Chair, on a real point of order: ... [Interjections.] I'm talking to the Chair, wena man! [Laughter.] [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members! Hon Malema, do you have a point of order?\n\nMr J S MALEMA: The hon member at the podium spoke of an \"arrogant\" young man. We don't have such things here.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon Malema. However, the word \"arrogant\" is not seen as unparliamentary. Please take your seat.\n\nMr J S MALEMA: But \"young man\", \"young man\"!\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Mulder, will you withdraw the words, \"young man\", in reference to the hon member?\n\nDr P W A MULDER: I didn't mention any names but if he thinks he's very old, I will withdraw it. [Interjections.]\n\nMr J S MALEMA: I'm not saying you mentioned a name.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Malema, don't push me!\n\nDr P W A MULDER: I withdraw it. If you don't mind, I will withdraw it, even though I didn't mention any names. [Applause.]\n\nAn HON MEMBER: Hon Chairperson, ...\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nDr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Voorsitter, op 'n punt van orde: Ek kan nie verstaan hoe die woorde, \"'n jong man\", onparlementêr is nie, maar, sorry, the old man [jammer, die ou man] nie is nie.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon Groenewald. Please proceed.\n\nDr P W A MULDER: Hon Chairperson, I would hope that I get my time back because you are, sort of, destroying ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Your time has been restored, sir. Please proceed.\n\nDr P W A MULDER: Thank you. I have tried to make the point that Afrikaners tried to get economic power, but they never succeeded in that, although they had political power. In that sense I said it's dangerous in the end because the President is setting himself up to fail.\n\nOf the 400 members elected here in 1994, only 12 of us are left in this House. This is good and bad. It's good because new members bring new ideas. It's bad because we need experience and continuity, and we cannot start over every time, as we are doing at the moment.\n\nLet me give an example. Yesterday, snide remarks were made here about Afrikaans and white people. When we started in 1994 only English and Afrikaans were spoken.\n\nMr M Q NDLOZI: Hon Chair, I rise to ask a question, if the speaker will take one.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Mulder, do you want to take a question?\n\nDr P W A MULDER: My time has already gone. I can't take that question. I would like to make my point and you can listen to it.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: He doesn't. Please continue hon Mulder.\n\nDr P W A MULDER: I said when we started here only Afrikaans and English were spoken, without any translation. The question is which party fought to have all 11 languages spoken here. It was the FF Plus. Go and read it in Hansard. Why? Because we know that one's dignity is restored when one's language is recognised.\n\nI accept that the hon member who went off against Afrikaans also knows – when we have that debate – that the majority of Afrikaans speakers at the moment are not white.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nDie VOORSITTER VAN DIE NRVP: U tyd is verstreke, meneer.\n\nDr P W A MULDER: Dit is baie jammer, agb Voorsitter. Gee ons meer tyd sodat ons vir die lede wat so slim is daar anderkant kan antwoord.\n\nMs S P KOPANE\n\nDr P W A MULDER\n\nMs S P KOPANE: Hon Chairperson, in a multiparty democracy such as we have in South Africa, the separation of party and state is an important guiding principle that informs the independence of our respective state institutions. As a nation it would appear that we have seen subtle instances where the ANC has confused itself with the state. We have also seen government officials abusing their privileges and powers exclusively for the benefit of the ANC.\n\nAs we gather in this House today, the ruling party has compromised the National Prosecuting Authority. The NPA has long been embroiled in scandals and politicisation. Just three weeks ago, something to which my colleagues alluded before, rumours surfaced that the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Mxolisi Nxasana, might be pushed out because he refused to bend to the will of the ANC.\n\nIn his address, President Zuma made absolutely no mention of the deterioration of the NPA. Moreover, the President of the ANC and the ANC itself have ignored calls by the DA to expedite the constitution of the Justice Portfolio Committee to investigate this very same matter, Ms Molewa.\n\nHon members, maybe we need to ask ourselves the following question. Is the President going to sit back and watch the rapid decline of the NPA and act only at the eleventh hour, as he did with the mining strike? An independent prosecuting authority is vital in our democracy because it fights crime and enforces the rule of law.\n\nJust earlier this year a team of state intelligence operatives and police officers were dispatched to Luthuli House to screen prospective Members of Parliament - a process that has been dubbed Project Veritas. This clear abuse of state institutions flies in the face of section 199(7) of the Constitution, which clearly provides that the country's security services may not further the interests of any political party.\n\nWe also found that the Department of Social Development and its agency, the SA Social Security Agency, had jumped on the ANC's election bandwagon, distributing food parcels and blankets at an ANC rally. This sort of conduct is unacceptable in our democracy. [Interjections.]\n\nPeople who deserve to receive grants in South Africa and who are not aligned to the ANC find themselves being alienated or excluded ... [Interjections.]\n\nThe MINISTER OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?\n\nMs S P KOPANE: I'm not going to waste my time. I'm not going to take the question.\n\nThe MINISTER OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT: You're afraid. That's why.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Proceed, hon member.\n\nMs S P KOPANE: Ultimately, the ANC believes that there is absolutely nothing wrong with exploiting the people of this country, especially the poor. Their attempts to buy votes are unjustifiable and are an assault on our Constitution and our democracy. [Applause.]\n\nFormer Minister Trevor Manual, when attending the Conference of the International Social Security Association, which was held here in Cape Town and which I attended, said:\n\nBut social security arrangements also have immense power to do damage – when they promise too much, or are too inflexible, and hence contribute to fiscal unsustainability and perhaps financial crisis, and also when their rules are unfair and hence contribute to social discontent and unrest.\n\nWhile it is crucial that this government provides relief to poor people, this is not a solution to deep-rooted poverty, the lack of quality education and insufficient skills development.\n\nWe can cite numerous incidents in the House today. A clear example is that of a senior government official, Mr Lerato Modise, at the government's drought relief programme, who wore an SACP jacket while he was handing out t-shirts similar to this one, which more or less bore the ANC slogan. [Interjections.] This is a clear abuse of state resources.\n\nMr President, you publicly commit yourself to fight corruption but we all know this is not true. After having been found guilty of improperly benefitting from the misuse of public funds for security upgrades at your personal property, you have failed to take action on the recommendations of the Public Protector. [Interjections.] This is a clear indication ...\n\nMr B A RADEBE: Chairperson, on a point of order: In which court was the President found guilty of anything? I think the hon member should withdraw that remark because she is misleading the House.\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member?\n\nMs S P KOPANE: The Public Protector ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member!\n\nMs S P KOPANE: I will withdraw the word, \"guilty\", but the Public Protector's report clearly states ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, you said that the President of the ANC \"was found guilty\".\n\nMs S P KOPANE: Chairperson, I will withdraw the word, \"guilty\", but I will rephrase ...\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, please listen to me! You said the President \"was found guilty\". You cannot withdraw the word, \"guilty\" only. You must withdraw the entire sentence, that the President \"was found guilty\".\n\nMs S P KOPANE: I will withdraw the words, \"the President was found guilty\". However, the report clearly says that he improperly benefitted from the abuse of state ... [Interjections.]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Hon Chairperson, can the member raise the t-shirt again? I did not see it properly. [Laughter.]\n\nThe CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! The hon member should proceed.\n\nMs S P KOPANE: The report of the Public Protector clearly states that the President improperly benefitted from the misuse of public funds for security upgrades at his private residence, and he has failed to act as recommended by the Public Protector. I still maintain that this is a clear indication of how they have undermined this Chapter 9 institution. The conduct of the ANC delegation to the Nkandla ad hoc committee is also a clear abuse of the processes of Parliament to shield the President from accountability. [Applause.]\n\nDuring the election campaign ANC leaders and government officials threatened South Africans, saying that if they voted for the DA they would lose their social grants and their houses. [Interjections.] The DA, unlike the ANC, never buys votes to gain the support of the South African people.\n\nMr President, you have lost 15 seats in this House. South Africans no longer have faith in your ability to lead ... [Interjections.] ... and to maintain the integrity of the state that was established to govern South Africans.\n\nSesotho:\n\nMotsamaisi wa dipuisano, baahi ba Afrika Borwa ba batla mosebetsi. Ba batla thuto ya mantlha hore ba tsebe ho iphedisa. Ha ba batle ho etswa mekopakopa ya diphuthelwana tsa dijo.\n\nMosotho wa kgale a re mphemphe ya lapisa, motho o kgonwa ke sa hae.\n\nKe a leboha. [Mahofi]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS\n\nMs S P KOPANE\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Hon Chairperson, hon President, Mr J G Zuma, hon Deputy President, hon Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members of the House and our guests in the gallery, it is an honour for me to take part in this year's debate on the state of the nation address.\n\nThis debate takes place in the context of our country's celebrating Youth Month. This is the month in which we remember and pay tribute to the heroism and the transformative power of young people. We are reminded that through their extraordinary acts of bravery young people made an enormous contribution to advancing our struggle for national liberation. Their actions indeed changed the course of history!\n\nToday, as we engage in the struggle to defeat unemployment, poverty and inequality, we count young people among the main contributors and those who stand to gain the most from this struggle. Indeed, young people continue to be a central part of the national effort to move South Africa forward!\n\nAllow me to quote our icon in his address to hospital workers on 16 April 1998. Tata Nelson Mandela said:\n\nWhether you change the linen or stitch up wounds, cook the food or dispense the medicines, it is in your hands to help build a public service worthy of all those who gave their lives for the dream of democracy.\n\nThese words, by the founding father of our nation, are in line with our Constitution, which directs us to create a public service that is broadly representative, accountable and responsive to the needs of all South Africans. This is the Constitution that upholds high standards of professional ethics and a public service that is development oriented.\n\nToday, maybe more than ever, we as a nation and state are faced with difficult and complex challenges. These challenges require principled public servants who are motivated by the common good and effective service delivery rather than personal enrichment.\n\nDuring the last elections, held last month, where every party was given an opportunity to test its strength, the people of South Africa spoke, and they spoke loudly and clearly. They gave the ANC an overwhelming mandate to govern this country for the next five years and to continue changing their lives for the better. [Interjections.] They have said to us: Continue to build on the good work you have done in the past 20 years of freedom.\n\nTo us this is an indication that the ANC is still the people's choice and a true custodian of the aspirations of most South Africans, ... [Applause.] ... as opposed to what those in denial believe. Those that behave like Thomas in the Bible, who refused to believe that Jesus Christ had risen, to the extent that he had to put his finger in the wound, were again rejected by our masses.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nSekela Somlomo, uKhongolose ufunwa ngabantu bonke baseMzantsi Afrika!\n\nEnglish:\n\nOur victory in these elections is living proof that no amount of misinformation and lies can bury the truth. Our people know very well that it is only in hon Maimane's world that cows eat chickens, because in the real world no herbivore can turn overnight and become a carnivore. As he is a person who had aspirations to become a premier, I expected the highest degree of articulation from him, but all he did was to be a crybaby, lamenting over spilt milk. The ANC \"moered\" you fair and square in Gauteng and in South Africa. [Laughter.] [Applause.] Indeed, you made me miss Lindiwe Mazibuko ... [Interjections.]\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nDie ADJUNKSPEAKER: Geagte lid, dit is nie die soort Afrikaans wat ons in die Huis mag gebruik nie, asseblief.\n\nEnglish:\n\nPlease withdraw that utterance, madam, because we do not use that language here. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Well, we defeated you, brother, in Gauteng and in my country. [Interjections.]\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, hon member. Please withdraw it!\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: I withdraw it, Deputy Speaker.\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. One must use decent language.\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: The truth is that 20 years into our freedom and democracy South Africa is now a better place to live in and we indeed have a good story to tell! [Interjections.]\n\nWe as the ANC are proud of our past. This includes our history and heritage of struggle for liberation, as well as our record of delivery since 1994. [Interjections.] Equally, we approach the future with confidence that our plans and policies will match the demands placed on us by the challenges we face and deliver an even better life for our people. It is for this reason that we will continue to say: \"The ANC lives, and the ANC leads!\" [Interjections.] [Applause.]\n\nWe as the ANC are proud that in the last 20 years we have made significant progress in transforming an undemocratic, unrepresentative, fragmented Public Service, which was largely serving a minority, into a unitary, nonracial, nonsexist Public Service that is answerable to and representative of all South Africans.\n\nCompatriots, we are all called on to imagine a different future in 2030, different from our past, which was ugly, repulsive, and the present that threatens to mortgage the future of our children and country. The future envisaged by the National Development Plan and our Constitution is full of promise, hope and unfettered possibilities.\n\nAll citizens of this country must play an important role in ensuring that together we succeed in moving South Africa forward. The clarion call to move this country forward cannot be achieved without the participation of our people.\n\nWe must know that public administration is the infrastructure of the state and that public servants are the people who deliver the services that the state provides. According to the Constitution, public administration must be governed by democratic values and principles that include the promotion and maintenance of a high standard of professional ethics; the promotion of an efficient, economic and effective use of resources; and a public administration that is development-oriented and accountable, amongst other principles.\n\nNow, 20 years into our democracy, we are still trying to consolidate this infrastructure because, if we don't get it right, none of our plans as a country will be deliverable.\n\nHon members, hon Minister Sisulu once said:\n\nThe kind of society and the kind of government that we dreamt of is poignantly and exceptionally well documented in the Freedom Charter.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nIsafana, mhlonitshwa Maimane!\n\nThese are the dreams that have kept Nelson Mandela so resilient and so phenomenally strong. The dreams of a democratic, efficient, capable, caring state, driven by committed cadres of government. Cadres who burn with even a fraction of the passion of what our founding fathers have left us, in order to carry on this dream of a world where we have redressed all our past injustices and can strive to create a better life for our people. A dream that one day we will be able to (realise) this for all our people and the society we fought for.\n\nThe National Development Plan represents the vision and aspirations of our own people. It is important that all public servants gear themselves to lead in the implementation of this plan. The plan has been broken down into the Medium-Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019. The success of this vision can only be determined by the capacity and ability of the state.\n\nFor this to be effective we need a transformed, efficient and corruption-free Public Service led by public servants whose only preoccupation is meeting the expectations of the public and exceeding them. This will not happen when South Africans tolerate bad service and play no active role in evaluating and monitoring the implementation of government programmes. [Interjections.] This calls for active citizenship as envisioned by the NDP.\n\nFellow South Africans, we are aware of the challenges consistently mentioned by the Auditor-General and the Public Service Commission in their reports. All these are indicative of serious governance challenges that need to be addressed urgently. Measures to address these challenges are clearly articulated in the NDP. In this regard the NDP calls for a clear division of roles between the political and administrative leadership; the development of specialist professional skills with appropriate career pathing; improved relations between the local, provincial and national spheres; and efficient, stable public enterprises that can drive social and economic transformation.\n\nThese are issues that should occupy each public servant as he/she gets out of bed each morning, with the dominant thought not being, \"What will they ask me to do today?\" but \"What am I going to do today to move South Africa forward and closer to Vision 2030?\" We are convinced that when we get this right, the shortage of skills at the lowest level will be managed.\n\nPublic servants are custodians of our democratic dispensation and the rules that govern it. They should never be found in breach of the laws, regulations and societal norms that govern all our lives. Public servants have every right to be indignant on an issue such as corruption and to protest that it takes two to tango. The fact is, there should be no tango in the first place. And, if anyone were to tango, let them do so alone, and not on our side of the counter, or the car window, or the border post.\n\nThe ANC government is built on the lives of heroes and heroines who gave so much because they believed in the principles and values driven by morality. There is no place in any part of our government for any tolerance of corruption, whatever its nature. [Interjections.]\n\nWe have now begun with the second phase of our ongoing transition from colonialism and apartheid to a national democratic society – a society that is truly united, nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous. We as the ANC have committed ourselves during this phase to implement bold and decisive measures to place our country and the economy on a qualitatively different path, a path to eliminate poverty and unemployment, create sustainable livelihoods and substantially reduce inequality. This path is clearly articulated in the NDP.\n\nWe have to create a situation in which a new social value system emerges, based not on government injunctions, but on a definition imposed on our country by the people of South Africa themselves. It is the defence and promotion of this new value system that will turn the masses of our people, at all levels of our society, into active combatants for the realisation of the objective of the RDP of the soul.\n\nWe are putting in place an anticorruption bureau to deal with corruption in the Public Service. Once established, the bureau will deal with corruption at all levels of government. Of particular interest, and what I want to emphasise, is that the bureau will put an end to the \"mobile corrupt employee\" who is charged with corruption in one province, resigns before the case is heard, moves to another province or local government to find employment, and carries on with corrupt activities. [Interjections.] [Applause.]\n\nWe as the ANC are happy that South Africans are effectively making use of our Chapter 9 and 10 institutions that we have established to guard democracy. The office of the Public Protector has been inundated with requests from the public, which is a true realisation of the Freedom Charter that, \"The people shall govern!\"\n\nIn order to succeed in meeting the goals we have set for ourselves in the NDP over the next five years, we must continue to pay attention to the goal of enhancing the capacity of the state in reshaping our society and the economy.\n\nWe are delighted that early this year Parliament passed the Public Administration Management Bill. Among others, this Bill will facilitate the secondment of officials from one sphere of government to another in order to address capacity challenges where they exist. The Bill will also allow for greater use of information and communication technologies in the public sector to enhance service delivery. It will strengthen a culture of discipline, integrity and ethical conduct in the Public Service and prevent public servants from doing business with the state.\n\nIn addition, our work to professionalise and capacitate public servants through the National School of Government will continue. Work will also continue in strengthening the implementation of the Public Service Charter, which constitutes the basis of our Public Service reform. Collectively these interventions will assist us to forge a disciplined, people-centred, efficient and professional Public Service. They will also strengthen our efforts to infuse the Batho Pele principles in our Public Service. They will further help us intensify our ongoing efforts to uproot corruption and maladministration.\n\nWe as the ANC remain committed to the appointment of people with the relevant skills and competencies, especially in senior management positions. Linked to this is the work we are doing to promote ongoing education and training within the public sector, including the work of the National School of Government. The training we provide must not only be geared to enhancing the technical capabilities of our Public Service, but must also enable innovation and deepen the creativity of public servants.\n\nFellow South Africans, our objective is to build on the good story of the past 20 years of freedom and democracy. Ultimately, the Public Service we want is the one that is totally committed to the goal of building a better life for all; that continuously pushes the brown envelope; and that is not merely satisfied with meeting targets but ensures the continuous provision of quality services.\n\nThis is the challenge we face. We as the ANC believe that working together with all South Africans and with God on our side, we will be able to rise above this challenge. [Interjections.] Together with our people, we will move South Africa forward. I thank you. [Applause.]\n\nMr J S MALEMA: Hon Deputy Speaker! Hon Deputy Speaker!\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, hon member! Where are you?\n\nMr J S MALEMA: I just want to acknowledge Deputy Minister Stella's top. That is a nice top. Thank you! [Laughter.] [Applause.]\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hayi!\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Hon Deputy Speaker, can I then remind hon Malema that these colours that I am wearing first belonged to the SACP, which is an ally of the ANC. [Laughter.] [Applause.]\n\nMr J S MALEMA: It remains beautiful! [Laughter.]\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: We appreciate this public generosity among yourselves, hon members. Hon K R J Meshoe, please speak, sir!\n\nRev R K J MESHOE\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS\n\nRev K R J MESHOE: Hon President, hon Deputy President and hon members, very few people, if any, can confidently claim that the hon President, during his state of the nation address on Tuesday evening, was effective in inspiring much hope or confidence in South Africans, particularly those in the business sector, when our country is facing the serious threat of a possible recession. Regrettably, in our view, the hon President made the same promises that were made in the past. What the nation wants to see is a speedy realisation of the undertakings made to address the poor state of the economy and to create jobs.\n\nIn identifying agriculture as a key job driver, the hon President said that government's target is for the agricultural sector to create a million jobs by 2030. When he mentioned this target, there was murmuring in the House, as members indicated their disbelief at yet another impossible promise that was made to the nation.\n\nHow will government ensure that the agricultural sector creates an additional million jobs in the next 15 to 16 years when our country is fast losing experienced farmers to other African countries and abroad, because of violent farm attacks which government does not seem to have the will or capacity to stop? How will the agricultural sector create a million jobs by 2030 when many small farmers, particularly black farmers, are not properly skilled and mentored for large-scale farming and do not have adequate resources to grow in this sector?\n\nDeputy Speaker, we were hoping that the five-month-long platinum strike would have been resolved, but it seems there are further complications. The strike was the main contributor to the negative 0,6 GDP figure for the first quarter of 2014, as well as the recent downgrade of South Africa's credit rating by Standard & Poor's and the shift in the country's credit outlook from stable to negative by Fitch Ratings. This will result in state debt service costs' rising, which will place more pressure on the fiscus. The ACDP supports the National Development Plan, which we believe must be speedily implemented if the country is to avoid slipping down a further notch as assessed by credit rating agencies.\n\nHon President, while we welcome the commitment that the Deputy President will convene the social partners' dialogue to meet and deliberate on the violent nature and duration of the strikes, we question why this was not done earlier, given the protracted nature of the strike, which has lasted five months. The suffering experienced by the families of the miners and the local businesses is immense. Innocent people are losing their businesses, assets and properties because of their failure to meet their financial obligations. Many hungry children are missing school and those who are sick are not able to take medication on empty stomachs.\n\nThe private sector cannot show much confidence in the economy if the status quo remains. Government must be seen to be actively creating an environment wherein business can thrive. Indeed, the low level of investments that we are facing in the country will continue to constrain economic growth if corruption is not dealt with head-on by government.\n\nWhen the President said, \"I would like to share with you now, our plan of action to revitalise local government\", I thought to myself, \"Now we are moving in the right direction.\" But I was disappointed. The President did not have any new plan to offer. All he did was to give us a list of 11 municipalities that stood out for consistent good performance in regard to audits and expenditure on municipal infrastructure grants, and promised support to other municipalities that were struggling. Sir, \"support\" was the word that came frequently as he spoke about supporting those who were struggling. While we commend those 11 municipalities for their excellent work, and encourage this, what we want to know is: What is the new plan, Mr President, if there is one? Is it to throw more money at problems in municipalities? [Time expired.]\n\nMr B M BHANGA\n\nRev K R J MESHOE\n\nMr B M BHANGA: Deputy Speaker and Mr President, in isiXhosa I have a responsibility to say, ...\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\n... phila tata, sithembele kuwe.\n\nEnglish:\n\nWe wish you the best. That is what we do as Xhosa people. Thank you very much.\n\nHon President, in the last few days in this House we have noticed a new development in our country, of a divisive message to our nation from the members of this House. We have seen this from the two arms of this House, the opposition and the executive. We have seen divisive messages filling the ears of our nation.\n\nIt reminded me of the foundation of the establishment of the South African democracy, where South African democracy was established on the basis of national unity and national reconciliation. It worries me as a young fellow listening to members of the executive that they are giving a divisive message, a message that divides our people. We should be concerned at this new development. We have a responsibility to bring South Africa together. It is a commitment that we must make in remembering Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Molly Blackburn and Helen Suzman. [Interjections.]\n\nMr President, if we are committed to the National Development Plan, we will note that in chapter 15 it speaks about national unity and embracing both the diversity and the cohesion of our people. I have listened here to extreme views coming from the left and the right, and those views are dangerous in building a united South Africa. [Applause.]\n\nThe South Africa we want to build is a South Africa of opportunities, where all of us can live together and cherish the ideas that have evolved out of the NDP. Do not forget your own NDP. If you do, it means that many of you have not read what the NDP entails. [Interjections.] The NDP entails that in 2030 all of us will live in a country of open opportunities. [Interjections.]\n\nMr President, under your regime we have seen the evolution of a new populism of ideas. In this House we have seen the expression of ideological, racial arrogance, which has been exposed here. I do not subscribe to the views of an extreme divisive message that seeks to divide this nation that many of you sitting on this side have built up with the shedding of blood, that you have fought for and that some have even given their lives for. [Applause.]\n\nMr President, under your regime we have seen the state machinery used against our people in public service protests – by the same government that fought against apartheid brutality. We have seen you in Burgersdorp, Marikana, kwaLanga and Uitenhage, brutally assaulting our people through state security. You are guilty of that, Mr President. You are guilty of collapsing many of our municipalities. Under your regime good municipalities like the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality have ... [Interjections.]\n\nMr B A RADEBE: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: Can the member withdraw the statement that state security was used to suppress and brutalise the people?\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, we will come back to that. Hon Bhanga, please be careful of making statements that you know will not be acceptable – just be careful. We will come back with a ruling on this point of order. Proceed.\n\nMr B M BHANGA: Go and read your National Democratic Revolution, with its strategy and tactics, to find out what \"state security\" means. [Interjections.] It refers to the police. You have used the police against innocent citizens.\n\nMr President, you have killed good municipalities that used to win awards under your ANC-led government. You have killed the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. Today, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality cannot even provide refuse collection services and street lights for its people; infrastructure is collapsing; and the people ... [Interjections.]\n\nMr K B MANAMELA: Hon Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I want to raise an objection. I refer to the manner in which hon Lekota is looking at hon Bhanga – if looks could kill, the hon member would long have been dead. [Laughter.]\n\nMr M G P LEKOTA: Hon Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I think that if the members of the ruling party want to disrupt the discussions, they must do so without using other people. Thank you very much. [Laughter.]\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, can we just agree to allow the speaker to finish please? Let us not do that. [Interjections.]\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I think it is very important that members know that you can only rise in terms of the Rules. What is currently happening is a major disruption of members' speaking time and the flow of their speeches. [Interjections.] You can only rise in terms of the Rules. We cannot allow people just to stand up in Parliament and say what they want. That is why we have debates.\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, let us proceed. The hon Bhanga may proceed.\n\nMr B M BHANGA: Mr President, many municipalities should learn from the Midvaal Local Municipality. In good municipalities that the DA governs you will see better infrastructure delivery and a reduced unemployment rate. [Interjections.] In Midvaal the unemployment rate is 7% lower than the national average and youth unemployment is also low. We have good governance. Where services are implemented and infrastructure set up, there is the potential for growth in business and jobs are defended. The problems we are confronted with in ANC-led municipalities are due to factionalism and poor administration. We have noticed that municipalities are collapsing and services to our people are being affected.\n\nTherefore, Mr President, we would like to refer you to the Auditor-General's recent MFMA report. He identified the following challenges as being amongst the problems of current municipalities: supply chain management, asset management and the lack of capacity of officials, who do not deserve to be appointed. They get appointed because they are members of the ANC. These municipalities need interventions – they do not need cronies or friends. These municipalities need people who have capacity and specialisation to run the infrastructure and administration of these municipalities. Our people are directly affected by poor services delivered by the ANC.\n\nI dedicate this speech to you, Mr President; to the likes of Andries Tatane; and to those who died in the brutal public protest that the ANC ... [Time expired.][Applause.]\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nMr B M BHANGA\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy Speaker, thank you very much. Molweni, sanibonani, thobela, avuxeni, dumelang, ndi masiari and it is getting close to madekwana en, mnr Groenewald, ja, beslis, ook goeie middag.\n\nOn 7 May the people of South Africa gave the ANC yet another overwhelming mandate. The people were giving the ANC a mandate to take South Africa forward, to create a better life for all by implementing the National Development Plan. The ANC Manifesto outlined how we would implement the NDP, and that is what the President spoke loudly, clearly, energetically and in detail about when he addressed this House.\n\nWe called our manifesto, \"Together We Move South Africa Forward\", and we did so because of two of the golden threads that run through the history of the ANC, which are unity and progress.\n\nIn 1911 Pixley ka Isaka Seme wrote a call to the Founding Conference of the ANC in 1912. He said:\n\nI repeat, co-operation is the key and the watchword which opens the door, the everlasting door which leads into progress and all national success. The greatest success shall come when man (and woman) shall have learned to co-operate, not only with his own kith and kin but with all peoples and with all life.\n\nThe South African Native Congress is the voice in the wilderness bidding all the dark races of this sub-continent to come together once or twice a year in order to review the past and reject therein all those things which have retarded our progress, the things which poison the springs of our national life and virtue; to label and distinguish the sins of civilisation, and as members of one house-hold to talk and think loudly on our home problems and the solution of them.\n\nThe ANC continues to play this role in the life of our nation. [Applause.]\n\nThe ANC has always been an organisation with a plan. In the 1940s the Atlantic Charter was a response to the problem of the rise of fascism, and the ANC responded to that with the Africans' Claims.\n\nIn the 1950s the ANC responded to the heightening, the escalation, of the implementation of apartheid with the Freedom Charter.\n\nIn the 1960s the ANC responded to the challenge of the unbridled terrorism unleashed by the regime with the Strategy and Tactics of the African National Congress of 1969.\n\nWhen the time came to negotiate, the ANC responded with the Harare Declaration. When democracy was on the horizon, we responded with Ready to Govern and with the Reconstruction and Development Plan. Now, as we enter the second phase of our transition, we respond with the National Development Plan. [Applause.]\n\nThe ANC is an organisation that says what it means, and means what it says.\n\nThe ANC's plans are not formulated in closed rooms in the way that some parties choose presidential candidates. Our plans are drawn up openly and in consultation with the people. It is for this reason that the ANC has been able to rely on the support and the active involvement of our people – it is because their plan is our plan.\n\nThe formulation, as well as the implementation, of these plans was characterised by vigorous, robust and at times even acrimonious debate and discussion. During the years of exile the sound of the rattling of the AK-47 was mixed with the sound of cadres firing intellectual salvos at each other as they debated the meaning of the various clauses of the Freedom Charter. [Applause.]\n\nOn Robben Island, the sounds of the picks and shovels in the limestone quarry could not silence the sounds of those debates.\n\nAfter 1994 we continued debating the RDP even as we were implementing it by building millions of houses, creating millions of jobs, building hundreds of clinics, tarring thousands of kilometres of roads and creating hope through the implementation of that programme.\n\nThe ANC has always mastered the art of walking and talking, toiling and talking, and debating as we work to build a better future. Therefore, those who fantasise about gloom and despair, who fantasise that the ANC is not united around the NDP, and who fantasise that it will not implement the NDP, are locked in a futile argument against the example of history.\n\nThroughout our history there have, unfortunately, always been discordant noises from certain quarters. Sometimes it has taken the form of a strident stream of racist invective. At other times it has been the sound of the rattling of a flat spare tyre in the boot of South African history. At still other times it has been the low, slow whine of generalised suburban discontent. More recently we have heard the shrill hadeda-like sounds of \"Nkaaandla! Nkaaandla! Nkaaandla!\" [Laughter.] [Applause.] And then, there has also been the pitiful lament coming from amid the twilight shadows of our politics asking: What has happened to international mediation?\n\nAnd yet, amid these discordant noises, we hear other, more hopeful, sounds. We hear that all of us in this Chamber, once one listens past the noise, agree that the core challenges facing South African society are poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nWe also hear, if we listen carefully, that our national priorities remain health; education; economic development and job creation; and rural development, land reform and food security, as well as combating crime and corruption.\n\nWe hear, too, if we listen carefully, that there is agreement that the NDP is our national roadmap to address these issues and to create a radically transformed society by 2030. The NDP will guide us through this second phase of our transition.\n\nWe therefore appeal to all in this House and in our society to focus on these areas of the agreement and to rally around the implementation of the NDP and its programme for radical socioeconomic transformation. This is because it is only by doing this that we will succeed in creating a united nation, a nation which is united in its diversity and which is spelt out in our Constitution.\n\nThroughout history nations have been forged in battle or through having a common enemy. In South Africa's case, our country seeks to build a nation around the values of nonracialism, healing the past, and acting in the interests of the poor and downtrodden. We seek to build a society where progress and development are measured by the progress and inclusion of the poor. The roadmap to that society is to be found in our Constitution and our NDP.\n\nSouth Africa has chosen not to create a melting pot, but rather a potjie to celebrate diversity. South Africans are bound by a shared geographic space, a common modern history, however differently experienced, and a Constitution with four core values, which are as follows.\n\nThe first is nonracialism, because we believe that \"South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white,\" as the Freedom Charter states, and that South Africans may hold multiple identities but that we are South Africans first, before race, language or ethnicity.\n\nThen there is nonsexism. We believe in the equality of status, rights, responsibilities and opportunities of men and women.\n\nThirdly, there is social solidarity. [Interjections.] I want to hear the same now. All South Africans have a responsibility to build a new society, one in which opportunity is not shaped by our history, and one that is fundamentally propoor in nature.\n\nFinally, there is democracy, that \"the people shall govern\" and that the authority of the state shall be exercised by elected representatives of its people in institutions enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nSouth Africa's path to nation-building allows individual cultures, languages and identities to become the building blocks of a greater whole. However, forging a common identity without reducing inequality is tantamount to building on a foundation of sand. Redistribution and equity are not only constitutional imperatives, but are good for growth, development and stability.\n\nSouth Africa, therefore, must have a social contract for equity and inclusion. The entire NDP is about building this social contract and enabling people through their sharing of common spaces to see their humanity reflected in the other and ensuring a decent standard of living for all.\n\nIt is this inherited psyche of prejudices and stereotypes regarding race, gender and sexual orientation; a breakdown in values; the inequality of opportunity; massive poverty; and the competition for scarce resources that help to fuel racism, xenophobia, homophobia and gender-based violence.\n\nOpen displays of opulence, even when they are hidden under overalls of whatever colour, are a scourge in South African society. [Interjections.] Their offensiveness is particularly marked because of South Africa's high levels of inequality and unemployment. Society should have balanced and appropriate incentive systems commensurate with the individual's contribution to society. Excessive displays of wealth, as well as unjustified differentials in income, distort these incentives. The country cannot achieve unity and social cohesion without reducing the gaps between rich and poor, black and white, women and men, city and country.\n\nIn doing this it is necessary to recognise the historical obligation to have redress, to correct the wrongs of the past, and to affirm the historically disadvantaged. Without unity, the nation cannot hope to correct the wrongs of the past – without correcting the wrongs of the past, unity would be superficial. The country must therefore continue with measures to facilitate active engagement of the populace in its own development.\n\nEfforts to enable the healing of wounds of the past while reducing economic exclusion and inequality of opportunity and outcomes; to enable the sharing of space across race and class; and to foster an overarching South African identity anchored by the Constitution and the values embedded therein, should be optimised.\n\nDeputy Speaker, that brings me to one of the most radical aspects of our National Development Plan. That is the part of the National Development Plan – and the Medium-Term Strategic Framework that will be based on that National Development Plan – that talks about transforming our national space economy, and about dealing with the legacy of apartheid spatial patterns.\n\nYesterday, Minister Rob Davies and the hon Yunus Carrim spoke here at length about the structure of the South African economy. They said that it was an economy that was rooted in mining and finance capital, to the detriment of an industrial base. They traced the development of the structure of our economy to the fundamental characteristic of apartheid colonialism – colonialism of a special type, an internal colonialism. This is a system which sought to develop a source of cheap labour for mining capital through the fragmentation of our country into homelands and exclusive residential areas. It is a system that promoted the inclusion for economic purposes, but exclusion for social and political purposes, of the vast majority of South Africans. That legacy has been one of the most difficult legacies for democratic South Africa to deal with.\n\nWe recognise that much of the tremendous progress that we have made in the provision of basic services such as housing, water and sanitation have had the effect in many cases of reinforcing those apartheid patterns of spatial development. Therefore, we are saying that we need a concerted national effort to reverse those patterns.\n\nThe CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: There is very irritating noise in this Chamber, and I'm really struggling to follow with this very irritating noise.\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.\n\nMr G A GARDEE: Deputy Speaker, may I ask what Rule the hon member was rising on?\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, please don't disrupt speakers. I will not accept this anymore!\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: This issue of the transformation of apartheid spatial patterns is tied very, very closely to the issue of urbanisation. I would like to quote what the President said to this House in February last year. Mr President, you said that:\n\nWe should remain mindful of rapid urbanisation that is taking place. The Census Statistics reveal that 63% of the population are living in urban areas. This is likely to increase to over 70% by 2030.\n\nApartheid spatial patterns still persist in our towns and cities. Municipalities alone cannot deal with the challenges. We need a national approach.\n\nWhile rural development remains a priority of government, it is crucial that we also develop a national integrated urban development framework to assist municipalities to effectively manage rapid urbanisation.\n\nAs part of implementing the National Development Plan, all three spheres of government need to manage the new wave of urbanisation in ways that also contribute to rural development.\n\nMr President, after you gave that instruction, a discussion document was formulated. It was released in October last year and we stand ready to comply with the deadline of 30 July to release a draft policy document that will form the basis of a national discussion on urbanisation and transforming apartheid spatial patterns.\n\nIn the minute or so that remains I would just like to express my concern at the inputs made by the hon Kopane and the hon Bhanga, because I think both of those inputs really demonstrate what one can only call the Jekyll and Hyde relationship that the DA has with the truth. [Interjections.]\n\nYou see, the hon Kopane made all manner of allegations without adducing a shred of evidence. She made the allegation of widespread abuses of social development, but she didn't tell the House that the DA took this matter to court and their application was dismissed with costs. Why did she not tell us that? [Applause.] She also didn't tell us that the very allegation that she made in this House regarding the President is an allegation that the DA sent out in an SMS during the election campaign, and she did not tell the House that the DA lost spectacularly in the electoral court on that matter.\n\nThe hon Bhanga came and waxed lyrical about good governance in municipalities. He cited Midvaal as an example. The hon Kopane spoke at length about the Public Protector's report. It's a pity that the hon Bhanga did not refer to the Public Protector's report into Midvaal. [Interjections.] [Time expired.] Thank you. [Applause.]\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, I would like to say to the hon member there who displayed the T-shirt that it is out of order to do so, unless you are at the podium. Please don't do that again. That is a violation of the Rules and you are not supposed to do that in the first place.\n\nHon members, we would also like you to understand that you can't just rise and speak, especially in a manner that is clearly intended to disrupt a speaker's speech. The effect of this is to disrupt the person at the podium. Let's only rise when there is, in your opinion, a serious violation of the order of the House, and you are doing that on the basis of a Rule. There are Rules to follow to do that, so let's do that. We are aware that the Whips are planning the work in such a way that we familiarise ourselves with the Rules. Otherwise it disrupts the order and decorum of the House.\n\nI include here our inability to listen properly to the legitimate speeches being made by the members here. Please let's not disrupt them.\n\nWe will now take a comfort break. Let's obey the bells when they ring and move swiftly into the House, so that we can listen to everybody who speaks. The break will be 15 minutes long. Thank you very much.\n\nBusiness suspended at 16:10 and resumed at 16:30.\n\nThe MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe DEPUTY SPEAKER\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr R J Tau): Order! I take it that we have enjoyed our short comfort break and now we shall continue with the debate.\n\nThe MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Deputy Chairperson, Your Excellency President Jacob Zuma and hon members, let me start by responding to some of the issues that were raised by hon Kopane. Hon Kopane, in the DA it is even worse. They had plastic bags during the elections. You know that; I'm sure you saw it last year. These plastic bags even had the provincial government logo on them. The DA changed everything to blue! [Interjections.]\n\nNow, the issue of welfare services in this province is an embarrassment. [Interjections.] Welfare services are the responsibility of provinces. However, early childhood development centres have been sidelined through what is called zoning. The levels of psychosocial services are very low. With regard to institutions, there is a big difference between those in the cities and towns, and those in the townships. Nutrition and advice centres have been closed, and NGOs have been moved to affluent areas. The city is exclusive to a few people who are rich. Furthermore, black entrepreneurs have been forced to move to the townships through the zoning programme. [Interjections.]\n\nOn the issue of grants, let me ask you a question. If grants are unsustainable, is poverty sustainable? [Interjections.] It means she likes it. She is not saying what Minister Trevor Manuel said. Moreover, I want to say here, as we are talking today, that old democracies in Scandinavian countries still have social assistance and social protection services. So, I don't know where this comes from.\n\nAgain, after the Second World War, Germany started with social assistance to help the poor. [Interjections.] Now, those who want to listen must listen! When we experience floods here in the Western Cape, we, as Sassa, always intervene, but you turn around and claim that you, as the government of the Western Cape, are intervening. We have never shouted like children and said: No, that's not true! We have always left it alone!\n\nIsiZulu:\n\nKepha, into ebuhlungu ukuthi ngaso sonke isikhathi nidlala ngenhlupheko yabantu bethu.\n\nEnglish:\n\nIn this House, on Tuesday 17 June 2014, President Zuma related the good story of 20 years of freedom and democracy under the ANC-led government. Today we stand on the shoulders of those who fought to free us from the colonial and apartheid regime, from minority rule and from economic backwardness and unspeakable indignity.\n\nWe acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the forebears of our liberation struggle – icons such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tamb"
