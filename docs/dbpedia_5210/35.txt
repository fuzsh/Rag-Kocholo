In just under 12 months our team at the new Mediclinic George have made amazing progress. From bulk connections and underground installations of Domestic- and Fire-water Supplies, Soil Drainage and Stormwater Drainage to internal reticulation installations. We are very proud to showcase our team’s work and applaud their positive attitude and commitment. We’re almost half way team. Keep up the good work, we look forward to seeing the finishing touches.

Come rain or shine, day or night our teams’ dedication to deliver projects on time remain steadfast. Working across the whole of South Africa comes with more than its share of challenges but our teams are well equipped with not only the right tools, materials and knowledge but also a determination to deliver excellent service that comes with years of experience. Well done and thank you to all our teams, keep up the great work. Video: Winter has hit at Burgersdorp Prison Site #ESL #Excellence #Service #Leadership

A Lot of work goes in to any building even before the first foundation is laid and it often remains unseen by the end user. But without these services like sewer drainage, rainwater drainage and water supply you are left with an unusable shell. For this reason our teams put the same effort and care into the installation of underground (unseen) services that we do with the finishing installations. Equipped with years of experience and knowledge our teams make this look easy. "Battles are won in the trenches, in the grit and grime of courageous determination; they are won day by day in the arena of life." ~ Charles R. Swindoll Thank you and well done to our teams doing battle in the trenches. The attached photos are of underground services being installed for a new mall. #ESL #Excellence #Service #Leadership
