Father was the youngest of ten children and was known for his intelligence and athleticism. At age 11 he won an academic scholarship to attend the diocesan high school and he was very involved in athletics during his school years especially in hurling.

Father Tighe realized his vocation at the age of 24 and attributes his recruitment to Kansas by Monsignor John Cody. Msgr Cody, born in Kilkenny but was then a part of the Dodge City Diocese, had great success in recruiting seminarians to Kansas during his trips back home.

At the request of Bishop Marion Forst, Father Tighe served as an Army chaplain which lasted eight and a half years and included a tour of duty during the Vietnam War (1968-1969). It was his ministry to serve on the front line with the infantrymen and give last rites to dying soldiers in the field. Upon his honorable discharge, the Army awarded him the Meritorious Service Medal. In addition to his Vietnam tour, he ministered to troops stationed at Fort Hamilton in New York; Fort McClellan in Alabama; Fort Richardson in Alaska and Ft Eustis in Virginia.

He extended his service to the United States by joining the National Guard in Washington, D.C., Dodge City and Hutchinson. He retired from the Army as a colonel on 4 August 1990.

Throughout his life, Father Tighe advocated for the down-trodden and for various causes of the poor and the unborn. So much was his devotion to the unborn, he donated his home in Great Bend to Birthright after he moved into the Catholic Care Center in Bel Aire, Kansas.
