        "text": "\"Indiana Jones. I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door. I never doubted that. Something made it inevitable.\"\n\n―Marion Ravenwood[src]\n\nMarion Ravenwood (also known as Marion \"Mary\" Williams around 1938 to 1957) was the daughter of the American archaeologist Abner Ravenwood and the wife of Colin Williams, and later, Indiana Jones, with whom she had a son, Henry III or \"Mutt\".\n\nAfter a relationship in the mid-1920s, Marion and Indiana Jones wouldn't see each other again until 1936, when the pair joined forces to track down the Ark of the Covenant that was Abner Ravenwood's obsession. During that time, Marion and Jones rekindled their romance to the point where they almost married. However, Jones had second thoughts and the relationship ended a week before the wedding. Instead, Marion would go on to marry Colin Williams but the child she bore was fathered by Jones.\n\nWilliams was killed during World War II and Marion would once again reunite with Jones, this time in 1957, when she was kidnapped as part of a Soviet plot to find the Crystal Skull of Akator. Afterwards, Marion and Jones finally succeeded in getting married. The two were married for twelve years before Mutt's death in the Vietnam War drove them apart and threatened to end their marriage. However, Indiana and Marion eventually reconciled.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\n\"I was a child. I was in love. It was wrong and you knew it!\"\n\n―Marion Ravenwood, to Indiana Jones[src]\n\nMarion Ravenwood was born on March 23, 1909,[2] the only child[8] of the famous archaeologist and treasure-hunter Abner Ravenwood.[2] For her tenth birthday, Abner took Marion to the Washington Monument.[9]\n\nAs a girl, Marion was never particularly interested in her father's work—until 1925[2]—when a dashing Indiana Jones,[1] who had completed his graduate studies at the Sorbonne,[8] was asked to help his former mentor track down the Ark of the Covenant. Attracted to her maturity, beauty[2] and similar childhood,[10] Jones romanced Marion,[2] with the pair sharing their very first kiss inside the closet of an unspecified university library.[11] During that time, Marion came to notice how Indy would practice with his bullwhip every day.[12]\n\nIndy and Marion's intense courtship[1], which didn't lasted a year,[2] came to an abrupt end when it was discovered by Abner, which destroyed the two men's friendship.[1]. In their last conversation together, Abner accused him of taking advantage of Marion's \"brainless infatuation\" and twisting her to his purpose. As Jones left the Ravenwoods, he would not see Marion again for almost ten years, even though he had promised her that he would be back.[12] Marion, furious at Indy, found it easy to blame her tide of misfortune on him.[10]\n\nAfterward, Abner kept Marion close. Unwilling to see his only child living alone, Ravenwood brought Marion along on his travels all over the world.[13] Although she was privileged to travel to some exotic locations as a young girl, the experience was hardly luxurious.[10] In search of clues to the Ark's location they journeyed across Europe, Egypt, Iraq and Iran,[13] with Marion begrudgingly accompanying him nearly every step of the way.[2] The pair eventually settled[13] in Patan,[12] Nepal and started[13] a rough-and-tumble bar,[10] which he christened The Raven. Abner used their income to finance his excavations in the surrounding mountains.[13] For several years, Marion managed the bar while the proceeds benefited her father's expeditions in the surrounding mountains. It was a difficult life, but the constant flow of alcohol provided Marion with some amount of solace.[1]\n\nIn 1934, Marion was robbed. She chased the thief to Tibet and met the newest member of the Adventure Society at a valley village with Yeti footprints running through it. Marion and the recruit joined forces and found the tracks led to the Yeti lair, a cave complex where the Man with the Silver Eye's mercenaries had chased off the creatures. The pair eventually discovered that Silver Eye was looking for immortality from the lost city of Shangri-La and moved to destroy the entrance before he could reach it.[14]\n\nAfterwards, Marion turned her attention back to the one who had robbed her and the item that was stolen: the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra. Assisted by the Adventure Society recruit, the pair tracked the thief to a monastery.[14]\n\nReturn of Indy[]\n\n\"Until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're gonna get more than you bargained for. I'm your goddamn partner!\"\n\n―Marion Ravenwood, to Indiana Jones[src]\n\nWhen Abner disappeared in early 1936, possibly perishing in an avalanche while searching for the Ark,[13] Marion took charge of The Raven. With her brawny barman Mohan, she made a living in Patan.[1] She supplemented what meager income The Raven took in[10] by winning at drinking contests,[1] beating burly opponents twice her size[10] and selling off most of Abner’s collection of archaeological finds.[2] thougth some eleven Macedonian Coins and a Jewelled Scimitar were kept secret even from her for fear she would sell them [13]\n\nShe was contemplating a return to the States, when suddenly,[1] after almost ten years,[12] Indiana Jones reappeared on her doorstep. She did not extend a warm welcome, instead she gave him a punch in the face but reluctantly agreed to part with one of her father's artifacts — a medallion referred to as the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra — for the sum of three thousand dollars. She initially feigned ignorance about its whereabouts,[1] relishing finally getting the upper hand on Jones.[10]\n\nUnfortunately, Indy was not the only one with designs on the medallion. A Nazi officer named Arnold Ernst Toht confronted Marion and Indy at The Raven, and in the ensuing struggle, the tavern burned down. As Indy's ambitions had effectively robbed Marion of her livelihood, she felt justified declaring herself Indy's partner.[1]\n\nTogether, the pair traveled to Cairo, Egypt. There, Jones and Ravenwood met up with the archaeologist's old friend, Sallah el-Kahir. It was at the digger's residence that they came across a lone Capuchin monkey, that the former bartender promptly adopted, joking to Indy that the primate was their \"baby.\"[1]\n\nAfter taking some photos[15] and while shopping in the city marketplace, Marion and Jones were ambushed by a band of local thugs coordinated by German agents. Thanks to the latter's skill with a bullwhip, Ravenwood evaded capture but, eventually, she crossed paths with another hitman, who drew a knife on her. She was chased into a dark building by the thug, who was knocked out by Marion with a frying pan.[1]\n\nMoving the unconscious thug out of plain sight, Marion hid inside an empty basket. Her plan backfired as the Capuchin, actually in the service of a Nazi informant known as Monkey Man, had apparently witnessed her taking cover. Climbing atop the basket, she screeched loudly, revealing Ravenwood's position to the enemy. Marion was subsequently kidnapped by the thugs and taken away, loudly screaming and calling out for Jones to help her.[1]\n\nAfter quickly dealing with a menacing Arab Swordsman, Indy managed to track down his captured partner, who was being loaded onto a Nazi troop truck full of explosives. Using his pistol, the archaeologist successfully disabled the vehicle and killed the driver, an action that caused the truck to crash and explode.[1]\n\nIndy believed she was dead until, by a fortunate accident, he stumbled upon her bound and gagged in one of the Nazi tents and realized that the baskets must have been switched. To Marion's chagrin, he decided to leave her, reasoning that an escape would draw too much unwanted attention and regagged her. The perceived betrayal did not affect Marion's refusal to cooperate with her captors, however. Belloq's advances resulted only in an aborted escape attempt, and Toht's interrogation was likewise met with uncommon resistance.[1]\n\nAfter recovering the Ark, Toht threw Marion into the Well of Souls to die with Indy. The intrepid pair managed to escape and Indy intercepted the Ark en route to Cairo. Indy and Marion then fled aboard a merchant steamer, the Bantu Wind, but the Nazis persevered. After threatening the ship's captain, Katanga, the Nazis took Marion and the Ark aboard their U-boat. Indy secretly gave chase, clinging to the submarine's periscope for the duration of the voyage.[1]\n\nThe Nazis took the Ark[1] to Geheimhaven,[13] a small island north of Crete, and there Indy made a desperate attempt to free Marion before being captured himself. Fortunately for the both of them, the opening of the Ark unleashed the Wrath of God upon their Nazi captors, leaving Marion and Indy as the sole survivors of the ordeal.[1]\n\nBack in the States[]\n\nAfterward, Marion accompanied Indy back to the U.S., and comforted him when the government cut short his research into the Ark's powers.[1] While struggling to define her often complicated relationship with Jones, Marion tried her hand at various professions. She opened with the money she received for assisting Indy on finding the Ark a nightclub, The Raven's Nest,[10] in Manhattan's fashionable east side; but within days of opening, it was burned down by the club's conniving decorator, Jamal.[4]\n\nAfter taking a stab at journalism, Ravenwood accepted a job working public relations at the National Museum. The position led to a number of further adventures with Jones, including a search for her presumed dead father in Nepal. Later that year, Marion Ravenwood disappeared, leaving only a note in her absence: \"Mr. Jones, I've got to get away. Don't you dare come looking for me. Marion\".[16]\n\nNote: The following section is ambiguously canon.\n\nIt contains information that originates in a source that has not been deemed definitively canon.\n\nDuring her stint as the National Museum's public relations agent, Marion found her father's correspondence with Indiana Jones over the Temple of the Forbidden Eye and was shocked that the two had been communicating during their decade long estrangement. Seeing that Abner had also written to Jones's digger companion Sallah and was trying to save the archaeologist from being killed by his own excavation in the Lost Delta, Marion reflected that \"parents are complicated\", and took some reassurance that, in the end, Abner and Indiana had been headed towards a reconciliation.[17]\n\nAmbiguously canon information ends here.\n\nAn incomplete marriage[]\n\nIn 1937[2] they were eventually reunited and even got engaged,[7] with news of their engagement reaching the ears of Indy's father, Henry Walton Jones, Senior.[18] One week before the wedding, however, Indy reconsidered and broke it off,[7] having privately convinced himself that the marriage would not work and that Marion wouldn't want to be tied to a man who would be away half the time. Wanting to spare her the hurt of a lonely life,[19] it was his turn to disappear and the two did not meet again for nearly twenty years.[7]\n\nUnbeknownst to Jones, he had also walked out on his son: Marion had become pregnant[7] in the fall of 1937.[20] In July 1938,[2] Marion gave birth to Henry \"Mutt\" Jones III. Marion started dating an RAF pilot named Colin Williams three months after Mutt was born, and married him soon after. By the time Indiana Jones reached out to her in writing, it was too late. Mutt grew up thinking Colin, who died during World War II, was his biological father. Marion raised him with her close friend Harold Oxley, who, like Indiana, was a former student of Abner.[7]\n\nTogether again (again)[]\n\n\"Someone told me you were back. Are you back, Indy?\"\n\n―Marion Ravenwood[src]\n\nWhen Oxley went missing in Peru in 1957, Marion received a letter from him, went looking for him, and was captured by Russians led by Irina Spalko who also had captured Oxley. She was able to get a letter to Mutt, enclosing Oxley's letter and telling Mutt to find Indiana Jones.[7]\n\nMarion again encountered Jones when he and Mutt were also captured by the Russians. She accompanied Indy, his partner George McHale, Mutt and Oxley into a South American rainforest and Inca temple in a search for the Crystal Skull of Akator. They became close once more and when a life threatening situation arose stranding in dry quicksand, she revealed that Indiana was Mutt's father. On managing to escape the pit, they were once again taken prisoner.[7]\n\nWhen they were driven as prisoners in a truck through the rain forest, Marion explained to Mutt that Indiana was his real father. However this led to an argument which became so intense their guard moved to gag Marion which positioned him to be knocked out by Indiana and Mutt. Indiana then escaped his bonds with Mutt's hidden switchblade and freed Mutt who in turn untied Marion. In a hectic adventure through the rainforest and Akator, Marion and Indiana rekindled their romance very quickly despite everything that had happened before, and afterwards they finally became husband and wife, marrying[7] in October in St Martin's Church[21] with Harold Oxley and Charles Stanforth as witnesses.[7]\n\nBy 1969, Indiana Jones still wore his wedding ring but he was living alone in a small New York apartment as the two had separated out of grief following Mutt's death in the Vietnam War and Marion considered divorce, but they ultimately reconciled after Indiana Jones rediscovered himself with the help of his goddaughter Helena Shaw. Entering the flat, carrying a bag of groceries, Marion appeared to finally have decided to remain Indiana's wife as they reconciled, after the harrowing experience had allowed Jones to bring himself back.[15]\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nStrong of spirit and possessing street-smart savvy;[1] the result of a hardscrabble existence that dashed many of her girlhood dreams, but also gave rise to a capricious spirit;[2] Marion was able to drink men under the table and could throw an effective right hook. She loved her father but she was bitter when she became stranded in Nepal due to his work. While René Emile Belloq found Marion attractive, she also had the intelligence needed for a woman to get his attention.[1] For Indiana Jones, the first thing he ever noticed about Marion were her blue eyes. While there were many women in his life after they split up, he confessed to Marion that they all shared the same problem of not being her.[7]\n\nWhile initially mad about Jones walking away from their wedding she still had love for him. When reunited after being kidnapped by the forces of Soviet Colonel Irina Spalko, Marion expressed surprise at Indy's appearance. She shows care and affection to her son, Mutt Williams. Making sure the boy was properly educated and had him taught in many skills such as fencing. After spending time with Jones during the quest for Akator they fell back in love, later marrying in a small ceremony.[7]\n\nBy 1969, their relationship had gone sour due to the death of Mutt in the Vietnam War and Marion filed for an uncontested separation on June 28. However, by the time Jones had returned from his adventure with his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, Marion came back to his apartment. The two later shared a moment reminiscent of their time in Egypt and ultimately rekindled the love they still had for each other.[15]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nMarion Ravenwood was portrayed by Karen Allen in Raiders of the Lost Ark.[1] She later reprised the role for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.[7] The character was named Marion after Raiders writer Lawrence Kasdan's grandmother, while her surname was taken from Ravenwood Lane in California.[22] Ravenwood is a tough, self-reliant woman, who is unintimidated by men, and able to take care of herself when the situation demands it, a similar character to Princess Leia in Star Wars.\n\nThe script states that Marion's age in Raiders is 25 years old, making her around 15 at the time of the affair with a 27-year-old Indiana Jones.[23] With the release of Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide in 2008, this was changed when Marion's birthyear was revealed to be 1909, making her age about 27 at the time of Raiders instead.[2] Karen Allen herself was 28 during Raiders of the Lost Ark. She is nine years younger than Harrison Ford.\n\nIn 2008, Hasbro released a toyline to coincide with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which depicted Marion as she appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark. There was also an exclusive action figure of Ravenwood made for the planned fifth wave of the Hasbro toyline that went unreleased and instead was made an exclusive figurine for the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, along with the rest of the fifth wave's toys.[24]\n\nIn May 2023, Allen was confirmed to be appearing in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny through a film poster depicting all of the cast's names released on Twitter, though the poster itself didn't confirm whether or not Allen would reprise her role as Marion.[25] That came with Disney's public production notes.[26] Three days prior to the film's official release, Entertainment Weekly published Allen's comments on how much she would have loved to have more screentime in the film, though she was glad to not be left \"in the ether\".[27]\n\nAllen reprised her role as Marion for Dial of Destiny for the film's final scene.[15] Allen noted that Marion had a larger role alongside Indy in the early drafts written back when Spielberg was set to direct the film, but her role was drastically shortened when James Mangold took over the project with Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, his own writers, who kept her in the dark for a long time, disappointing her a bit with her reduced screentime, but was nonetheless satisfied with the way Marion ultimately returned for a last appearance. Her scene with Ford was filmed in one or two days, making all of the crew \"teary\" with their \"affecting\" performances.[28]\n\nTo prevent her involvement from not leaking, Allen had to refrain herself from answering questions about her role in the film for a long time, mostly from upset people who wished to know if she was in the film due to her name not appearing in the film's Internet Movie Database (IMDb) cast list, conceiving different answers for the questions.[28]\n\nConcept and creation[]\n\nSteven Spielberg originally intended the role of Marion Ravenwood for his girlfriend Amy Irving, but they split during production.[29] Sean Young auditioned for the role,[22] Barbara Hershey was considered,[30] while Debra Winger turned it down.[31] Spielberg cast Karen Allen, on the strength of her performance in National Lampoon's Animal House. Allen screen tested opposite Tim Matheson and John Shea, before Harrison Ford was cast as Indiana.[22]\n\nKasdan's depiction of Marion was more complex, with her actually being genuinely interested in Belloq in earlier script drafts.[30] Allen and Paul Freeman added more comedy in the tent seduction scene.[22] The actor came up with her own back-story for the character, such as what happened to her mother, her romance with Indiana at age 15 and her time in Nepal; Spielberg described it as \"an entirely different movie\".[30] This also included Marion prostituting herself following her father's death,[32] which was suggested during the development of the screenplay.[23]\n\n\"He dragged me, a kid, halfway round the world on his crazy digs. Then he pops off. He didn't leave me a penny. Guess how I lived, Jones? I worked here. And I wasn't exactly the bartender, you understand?\"\n\n―Marion to Indiana Jones in the Raiders novelization[src]\n\nThe finished film concludes with Marion and Indy leaving for a drink after being snubbed by Eaton and Musgrove.[1] Although the original screenplay finished the same way, Spielberg didn't shoot it as both the director and George Lucas had decided that it was unnecessary. It wasn't until Lucas' then-wife and editor Marcia Lucas saw a rough cut of Raiders that she observed that Marion was last seen at the Tabernacle scene after the deaths of the Nazis and insisted on the character being given closure.[33] Convinced by his wife, George Lucas then personally filmed Marion's last scene in the film at the stairs on location of San Francisco with a second unit crew.[34]\n\nAfter Raiders of the Lost Ark was released, Spielberg wanted Allen to return for the sequel, but Lucas decided that Indy would have a different love interest in each film.[22] Frank Darabont claimed it was his idea to bring back Marion for (what became) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, during his tenure as writer from 2002 to 2004.[35] Steven Spielberg approved Darabont's idea, and although Darabont's draft was ultimately turned down and David Koepp was brought to take over, Spielberg insisted that Koepp retain Marion.[36]\n\nDiane Kruger's Abigail Chase from the National Treasure franchise and Rachel Weisz's Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell from The Mummy franchise are said to be based in part on Marion.[37][38] Marion was also one of the inspirations of Jeremy Slater for May Calamawy's Layla El-Faouly / Scarlet Scarab in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero series Moon Knight, feeling that adapting Marlene Alraune, the title character's love interest in the source material, wasn't a good idea due to her depiction as a damsel in distress and that Marc Spector's love interest should be some to \"go toe to toe with the boys\" like Marion.[39]\n\nContinuity[]\n\nMarion Ravenwood was featured in The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones comic book series in the mid-1980s, starting in the sixth issue after fan concerns about her absence in the first five issues led Marvel Comics to address in the seventh issue's Readers of the Lost Ark letters section that Marion would stay an important character in the series to not deprive Indy's \"Abbott\" from Marion's \"Costello\".[9] However, Marion was written out in issue 25.[16] Although there were plans to bring back her for issue 35,[40] the book was canceled with number 34.[41]\n\nDuring the 1990s, author Rob MacGregor was not permitted to include Marion in his prequel novels for Bantam Books' Indiana Jones series despite his interest in exploring Marion and Jones' past relationship, being told that George Lucas could be saving her for the fourth film:[42] \"How did Indy meet [Marion]? What happened in their earlier encounters? George apparently wanted to keep that for the future. Maybe we'll find out in Indy IV\", MacGregor had speculated.[43] While writing the novelization of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, author James Rollins was allowed to expand on Marion's backstory from the film.[44] Following the fourth film's release, however, Indycron keeper Leland Chee stated during an interview with TheRaider.net in 2010 that Marion's life between Raiders and Crystal Skull was off-limits for further exploration by writers.[45]\n\nSources contradict each other for when Marion and Indiana Jones first met canonically. Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide has the pair meeting in January 1920 (making Marion eleven years old at the time) whilst Jones was under the tutelage of Abner Ravenwood.[2] However, James Rollins' novelization of Crystal Skull has their introduction to one another in one of Jones' graduate classes.[11] Indiana Jones' first teaching job is depicted in the summer of 1925 at London University during the events of Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants where Jones meets his first wife Deirdre Campbell.[46]\n\nRollins also has Marion and Jones' first kiss at an unspecified university.[11] The Ultimate Guide sees the relationship with Marion that destroyed Jones and Abner's friendship occur from the spring to autumn of 1925, overlapping with Dance of the Giants.[2] IndianaJones.com's (defunct) Marshall College entry placed it in 1926.[10]\n\nIn Raiders of the Lost Ark Storybook Marion is present during the meeting with Eaton and Musgrove in Washington DC.[47]\n\nMarion appeared as part of the SuperBowl XXIX preview for Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye in 1995 played by an uncredited performer. There, she assists Jones in acquiring the stolen Vince Lombardi Trophy but the character wasn't included the attraction itself.[48] However, Karen Allen went on to promote the ride as herself alongside John Rhys-Davies in The Making of Disneyland's Indiana Jones Adventure.[49]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nIndiana Jones and the Genesis Deluge (Vision)\n\nIndiana Jones Adventure World\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark novel (First appearance)\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark comic\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark Storybook\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark Read-Along Adventure\n\nIndiana Jones' Greatest Adventures\n\nIndiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Ikons of Ikammanen\" (Mentioned only)\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Club Nightmare!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Africa Screams!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Africa Screams!: Crystal Death\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Fourth Nail: Blood and Sand!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Fourth Nail: Swords and Spikes!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Deadly Rock!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Demons\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Search for Abner: The Grecian Earn\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Search for Abner: The City of Yesterday's Forever!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Cuban Connection!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Beyond the Lucifer Chamber!\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"End Run\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"The Secret of the Deep\"\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Revenge of the Ancients\" (Mentioned only)\n\nThe Further Adventures of Indiana Jones – \"Good as Gold\"\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure (Mentioned only) (Mac version)\n\nIndiana Jones and the Mystery of Mount Sinai (Mentioned only)\n\nIndiana Jones and the Army of the Dead (Mentioned only)\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull novel\n\n\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" - Indiana Jones: The Official Magazine\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull comic\n\nIndiana Jones: Traps and Snares\n\nIndiana Jones: The Search For Buried Treasure\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nIndiana Jones: Den of Destiny (Photo)\n\nDisney Emoji Blitz\n\nNon-canon appearances[]\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye\n\nLEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures\n\nLEGO Indiana Jones: Escape from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull!\n\nLEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues\n\nSources[]\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark trading cards (Card: Indy And Marion Reunited)\n\nThe Adventures of Indiana Jones\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark: The Illustrated Screenplay\n\nCrystal Death\n\nThe Golden Goddess\n\nFrom Star Wars To Indiana Jones - The Best of the Lucasfilm Archives\n\nThe World of Indiana Jones\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark Sourcebook\n\nIndiana Jones and the Infernal Machine: Prima's Official Strategy Guide\n\nIndiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide\n\n\"You Call This Archeology?\" - Indiana Jones: The Official Magazine 3\n\n\"The Thrill of the Chase!\" - Indiana Jones: The Official Magazine 4\n\n\"No Time for Love?\" - Indiana Jones: The Official Magazine 5\n\n\"Indy's Top 10 Funniest Moments\" - Indiana Jones: The Official Magazine 6\n\nThe Lost Journal of Indiana Jones\n\nIndiana Jones Activity Annual\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Annual 2009\n\nThe Greatest Adventures of Indiana Jones\n\nIndiana Jones Masterpieces trading cards (Card: Where's Marion?)\n\nTop Trumps: Indiana Jones\n\nIndiana Jones Annual 2010\n\nThe Diaries of Indiana Jones\n\nGrail Diary (prop replica)\n\nIndiana Jones Cryptic\n\nSomething Wild!
