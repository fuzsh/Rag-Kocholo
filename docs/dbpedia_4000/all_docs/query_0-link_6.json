        "text": "Latin Catholic ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Missouri, USA\n\nThe Archdiocese of St. Louis (Latin: Archidi≈ìcesis Sancti Ludovici) is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or archdiocese of the Catholic Church that covers the City of St. Louis and the Missouri counties of Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, Perry, Saint Charles, Saint Francois, Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, Warren, and Washington. It is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province containing three suffragan sees: Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, the Diocese of Jefferson City, and the Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph.[citation needed] It is led by Archbishop, Mitchell Thomas Rozanski, formerly the Bishop of Springfield in Massachusetts.[2] The archdiocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first parish of Saint Louis was established in 1770 by French settlers to the region. The parish was then part of the Diocese of San Cristobal de la Habana, based in Havana, Cuba. It was later incorporated into the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas when it was erected on April 25, 1793, which originally encompassed the entire Louisiana Purchase as well as the Florida peninsula and the Gulf Coast. The oldest parish in the diocese is St. Genevieve parish founded in 1759 in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri[3]\n\nPope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas encompassing the pioneer parishes of St Louis, New Orleans, and Louisiana and both Florida colonies on April 25, 1793, taking its territory from the Diocese of San Cristobal de la Habana, based in Havana, Cuba. The diocese originally encompassed the entire territory of the Louisiana Purchase, from the Gulf of Mexico to British North America, as well as the Florida peninsula and the Gulf Coast.[4] This date of erection makes the present Archdiocese of St Louis and the Archdiocese of New Orleans the second oldest Catholic dioceses in the present United States after the Archdiocese of Baltimore, which the same pope had erected as the Diocese of Baltimore on November 6, 1789. The new diocese encompassed the area under the Spanish crown as Luisiana, which was all the land draining into the Mississippi River from the west, as well as Spanish territory to the east of the river in modern-day Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.\n\nIn April 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from France, which had in 1800 forced Spain to retrocede the territory in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. The United States took formal possession of St Louis, then part of Upper Louisiana, on March 10, 1804. John Carroll, the Bishop of Baltimore, served as apostolic administrator of the diocese from 1805 to 1812.[citation needed]\n\nThe area's first bishop was Louis William Valentine Dubourg, who on September 24, 1815, was appointed Bishop of Louisiana and the [East and West] Two Floridas by Pope Pius VII. He was the Bishop of the Louisiana Territory from 1815 to 1826.[3] DuBourg chose to set up his episcopal see in St. Louis. In 1823, Pope Pius VII appointed Joseph Rosati to the office of coadjutor bishop of the diocese.[citation needed]\n\nOn August 19, 1825, Pope Leo XII erected the Apostolic Vicariate of Alabama and the Floridas, taking its territory from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas. Although the two Florida territories were no longer part of the diocese, he did not change its title. But soon after, Bishop Rosati abruptly resigned the office of coadjutor bishop during a trip to Rome after which the Vatican decided to split the diocese again, making St. Louis a separate see. On July 18, 1826, the same pope\n\nErected the Diocese of St. Louis, taking its territory from the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas and the Diocese of Durango,\n\nErected the Apostolic Vicariate of Mississippi, taking its territory from the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas,\n\nErected the Diocese of New Orleans, taking its territory from the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, and\n\nAppointed Bishop Rosati as apostolic administrator of both the Diocese of New Orleans and the Diocese of St. Louis. [citation needed]\n\nDiocese\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Bishop Dubourg's resignation and transfer to lead the diocese of Montauban, France, the diocese of Louisiana was split, giving New Orleans a bishop again, and the Diocese of St. Louis was erected on July 18, 1826, by Pope Leo XII. When founded, it included the state of Missouri, the western half of Illinois, and all American territory west of the Mississippi River and north of the state of Louisiana. It was the largest American diocese, equaling in extent all of the other nine dioceses.[citation needed]\n\nIts first bishop, Joseph Rosati, led the Catholic Church's expansion of its presence in these areas, and built its first cathedral, now known as the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France. He was the Bishop of St. Louis from 1826 to 1843.[3]\n\nOn July 28, 1837, territory in Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas was taken from the Diocese to form the Diocese of Dubuque, Iowa.[citation needed]\n\nUntil 1840, the \"Old Cathedral\" was the only church in the city. By 1850, there were 10.[3]\n\nThe archdiocese has admitted that it enslaved at least 87 people throughout its history, and that at least 5 senior clergy owned slaves.[5]\n\nArchdiocese\n\n[edit]\n\nThe St. Louis Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese on July 20, 1847, by Pope Pius IX.\n\nBecause of its former size, the archdiocese was often referred to as the Rome of the West.[6] It is dedicated to Saint Louis IX and has as its copatrons Saints Vincent de Paul and Rose Philippine Duchesne. [7]\n\nThe Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis contains the largest collection of mosaics in the world.[8] The Cathedral was dedicated in 1926 on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of St. Louis as a diocese, and was built under the direction of Archbishop John Glennon ‚Äì the last Irish-born Bishop of St. Louis ‚Äì and completed under the leadership of Archbishop John May. Work on the cathedral mosaics would not be completed for 60 years. The Cathedral of St. Louis was designated a \"Basilica\" in 1997 on the 150th anniversary of the archdiocese.[3]\n\nSt. Louis Preparatory Seminary in the countryside which is now the St. Louis suburb of Shrewsbury was completed in 1931. Later it became Cardinal Glennon College. Today it is the archdiocesan seminary Kenrick-Glennon Seminary.[citation needed]\n\nIn January 1999, the archdiocese was host to a two-day visit from Pope John Paul II, the first time a pope had visited the city. It was not John Paul's first visit, since 30 years earlier, he had paid a visit when he was Cardinal Wojty≈Ça, Archbishop of Krak√≥w.[9]\n\nFacing a shortage of priests and decreased Mass attendance, the Archdiocese of St. Louis announced in May 2023 it was closing 44 parishes in a reorganization. In making the announcement, Archbishop Rozanski said \"The church experience in our parishes today is not the same as it was 50 years ago, yet we are still functioning in many ways out of the same mode of evangelization with the same structures. We have inherited a great treasure of Catholic institutions from previous generations, but many of them are no longer as effective or sustainable as they once were.‚Äù[10]\n\nUnder the plan, thirty-five parishes will be taken over, or subsumed, by neighboring ones and fifteen will merge with others to create five new parishes by 2026.[10]\n\nSexual Abuse of Children\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, the Archdiocese paid $1.7 million to settle claims that it could have intervened to prevent the abuse of children, but failed to do so.[11]\n\nIn 2018, then-Archbishop Robert Carlson testified that he was unsure whether he knew in the 1980s that sexual assault of a minor was a crime, and was unable to say when he came to believe that sexual abuse of a minor was a crime.[12]\n\nIn July 2019, the Archdiocese of St. Louis released the names of 64 clergy who were \"credibly accused\" of committing acts of sexual abuse while serving in the Archdiocese.[13][14]\n\nOn August 16, 2019, \"sexually violent priest\" Frederick Lenczycki, who had previously served prison time in Illinois between 2004 and 2009 for acts of sexual abuse,[15] was sentenced to 10 years in prison 2+1‚ÅÑ2 months after pleading guilty to sexually abusing a boy in St. Louis County.[13]\n\nIn 2019, the Missouri Attorney General's Office identified over 160 instances of St. Louis Catholic diocesan priests and deacons sexually abusing minors.[16]\n\nIn June 2023, the Archdiocese agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit by a man who alleged he was raped when an altar boy from 4th through 6th grade[11] by a since-defrocked priest who has been required to register as a sex offender.[17]\n\nCancellation of free lunch program for schoolchildren\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2022, the Archdiocese directed local Catholic schools to cease participation in free lunch programs, which journalists cautioned could potentially result in thousands of schoolchildren going without free daily lunches. The Archdiocese reportedly advised its schools that if they offered free lunches, they would have to adhere to the Civil Rights Act, which it described as \"problematic.\"[18][19]\n\nBefore its withdrawal of the federal program went into effect, the archdiocese allegedly claimed that it would provide its own free lunch program.[20]\n\nBishops\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a list of the bishops and archbishops of St. Louis, and coadjutors and auxiliary bishops of St. Louis; and their years of service.[citation needed]\n\nBishop of Louisiana and the Floridas\n\n[edit]\n\nLouis-Guillaume-Valentin Dubourg (1812‚Äì1826), appointed Bishop of Montauban and later Archbishop of Besan√ßon\n\nBishops of St. Louis\n\n[edit]\n\nJoseph Rosati, C.M.
