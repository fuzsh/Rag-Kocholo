Result of Accident, on Friday. BOY FIRED FATAL SHOT Emma (sic ) Valenta Killed While On Her Way Home from Schoolï¿½ Detailed Story of the Tragedy Accidental discharge of a shot gun in the hands of fourteen year old Wenzel Sleis resulted in the death of little Emma, the eight year old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Valenta of Stangelville, Friday night. The tragedy was due to careless handling of the weapon, the trigger of which had been raised by the lad unconsciously while maneuvering to get a shot at a rabbit. Children coming home from school among whom was the Valenta child, stopped by the roadside where the boy had chased his quarry and watched the operations of the lad in endeavoring to locate the game. The little girl accosted the lad and the latter probably with no malicious intent passed the gun and the next instant there was a report and the girl sank to the ground dead. The boy unable at first to grasp the full meaning of his deed bent over the form of his dead companion and endeavored to stop the flow of blood from the girlï¿½s breast where the entire charge of shot at eight paces had entered. The remaining children fled pell mell from the scene and left the two alone. Incoherent and excited stories told by the little ones soon brought the parents and their neighbors to the road side and the little form cold in death was taken to the home by her grief stricken parents. All efforts at resuscitation were fruitless and the indications were that the child died instantly. An inquest was held on Friday evening the coroner being summoned from Kewaunee and a verdict to the effect that the child had met death in an accidental manner was rendered. The boy is at home with his parents and is overcome with grief and remorse. Close inquiry into the matter will be made but it is probable that the tragedy was due to accident. Stangelsville is a little burg in Kewaunee county just over the line and the scene of the shooting is three miles east of the village of Tisch Mills. The families are well known to Manitowoc county residents. Manitowoc Daily Herald, November 7, 1904 P. 1 ********* A LITTLE GIRL ACCIDENTALLY SHOT BY A BOY, THREE MILES EAST OF TISCH MILLS. Last Friday evening, Emma Valenta(sic), the eight-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Valenta of Stangelville, was killed by the accidental discharge of a shot gun in the hands of Wenzl Sleis, a boy of fourteen. While the boy was holding the gun at full cock, trying to get a shot at a rabbit near the roadside, several children, including little Emma Valenta, were coming home from school and seeing the boy, stopped to watch his operation. It is reported that the little girl spoke to the boy and that the latter raised his gun. He next instant the gun was accidentally discharged and the girl fell dead to the ground. The entire charge of shot had entered the girlï¿½s breast from a distance of eight paces. While the terror-stricken boy bent over the lifeless form of the little girl who was the victim of his unpardonable carelessness, the rest of the children fled pell mell from the scene of the heart-rending tragedy and hurried to their respective homes. The excited stories of the frightened children soon brought their parents and others to the scene of death and the body of little Emma was taken to the home of the grief stricken parents. The verdict rendered at the inquest was that the child had met death in an accidental manner.

Herald Times Reporter, Saturday, November 15, 1975\n\nMARTIN VLCEK A terrible shooting accident is reported from Gibson. It occurred on Sunday last. Martin Velchek went out hunting rabbits on Sunday morning. In order to secure a better view of the runaways, he mounted a stump and rested the butt of the gun on the stump, the muzzle pointing toward his body. The gun from slow pressure of the hand moved toward the edge of the stump and slipped off. The hammer struck the stump and caused the gun to discharge. The whole charge entered the man's stomach and literally disemboweled hm. And now comes a record of endurance, courage and tenacity of life which seems incredible. Velchek pressed back the protruding and shattered entrails, kept them in place with his hands, and walked home a distance of nearly half a mile. A physician was called, but saw the possibility of saving the man's life. His pulse was imperceptible and still the man lived through the day and through Sunday night, rested easily, though the accident occurred at 10 o'clock in the forenoon. Manitowc Pilot, September 16, 1897 P. 3 ******* VELCEK(sic) was alive and improving yesterday. He eats, digests his food, and performs his natural functions. Mishicott people say that he was dragging 16 feet of intestines when he reached his home, and that they were lying in the bed beside him when the physicians arrived. Some of the Murphy buttons were needed in putting the intestines together, but the doctor had no hope of the recovery of the man and his efforts were directed mainly toward allaying the pain. There is a possibility of his recovery. In such an event it will be one of the most remarkable instances on reord of recuperative power. Velchek has a wife and four children and is poor having purchased his farm on contract. He came here some years ago with a band of Gypsies and worked as a farm hand until he purchased his farm. He is an industrious and honest fellow. Manitowoc Pilot, September 16, 1897 P. 3 ******* W. Weljech(sic), the Gibson farmer who was accidentally shot in the abdoman on Sunday, Sept. 12, died last Thursday, twelve days later.

VOGEL Soldier Drowns After Accident Robert Vogel, 18, Is Victim Car of Two Creeks Youth Hits Culvert An 18-year-old soldier, Pvt. Robert George Vogel, of route 1, Two Rivers, died earlier today when the car he was driving crashed into a cement culvert wing on highway 42 about four miles north of Two Rivers and plunged into a shallow creek. The car containing the body of the youth was found at 6:30 this morning by Anton Ruminski, a route 1, Two Rivers, farmer. The car was lying on its left side and the face of the youth was submerged in water. Coroner Teitgen said death was due to drowning. Ruminski immediately notified county officials when he found the car as he was going after his cows. Clarence Meihsner and Sheriff Clarence Baryenbruch were the first to arrive on the scene and were followed by Coroner Teitgen and county traffic officer William Falvey. Believe He Fell Asleep Falvey said Vogel, son of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Vogel, residing on a farm a mile southeast of the village of Tisch Mills, evidently fell asleep at the wheel of the car, owned by the victimï¿½s brother, Leonard Vogel, of 1922 School street, Two Rivers. The car ran off the road on the left side, Falvey said, and traveled 130 feet before it crashed into the cement culvert wing. It hit the wing sideways, Falvey said, rolled in mid air, and plunged into the creek on its side, 15 feet below the road. Ruminski told the officials that he heard a crash about 3 oï¿½clock but thought it was his wood pile tumbling. The Ruminski home is only 100 feet from the scene of the accident. The soldier was traveling north at the time of the mishap, Falvey said, on his way home. The car was demolished in the crash. Vogel had been stationed at Ft. Riley, Kan., Dr. Teitgen said, and came home on furlough last Saturday prior to his reporting for duty at the army ordnance school at Atlanta, Ga.

He was born in Franklin, Kewaunee County, August 9, 1870. At the age of 14, he apprenticed himself to Mr. Wehausen of Two Rivers and learned the miller's trade. After 3 years at Two Rivers, he secured a position in the mills of Kaukauna where he stayed 2 years. Then he went in the capacity of miller to the Shawano Flour Mills, where he remained 5 years, when his impaired health compelled him to give up his vocation. In search of his health he visited nearly all the western states and in several of which he put in operation flour mills. Then giving up the trade of millwright he took up a claim in Oklahoma where his health seemed to have returned. Longing again for his work he took charge of a mill at Schuyler, Nebraska about 2 years ago. Through exposure his malady returned and he grew worse, forcing him to undergo several painful operations at Omaha. Since April 14, 1902, he was a hopeless, bed-ridden invalid, patiently waiting for death to relieve him of all troubles. His sufferings were beyond description but he bore them with Christian fortitude and calm resignation. He was buried in the Catholic Cemetery Rev. Father Kloucek officiating. His relatives and many friends here and in many places all over the country, will sadly mourn the loss of a boon companion and skilled workman.

Manitowoc Daily Herald, Saturday, November 19, 1898 P. 4\n\nWENZEL WALESH SCORES HUNT MISSING EAST SIDE RESIDENT MISSING MAN FOUND DEAD IN CITY PARK Search of Day Ends When Aged Man Found Hanging Early Today The search for Wenzel Walesh ended at 2 oï¿½clock this afternoon when a party of searchers found his body hanging in the woods at Neshota Park. Chief Schroeder notified Coroner W. G. Kemper and the doctor was on his way to the scene at 2:30. It was clearly a case of suicide. According to members of the family, Walesh had been worrying because of an operation last winter after which he had failed to regain his health. Searchers found the body hanging from the limb of a tree and indications were the man had commited suicide late yesterday afternoon or last evening. It is doubtful that an inquest will be ordered. No funeral arrangements could be completed today. A man hunt that began shortly after noon Friday and continued through all last night and today failed up to the present time to find a trace of Wencel Walesh, 70, retired east side resident, who left the home of his daughter early yesterday morning and has not been seen or heard from since. When Walesh failed to return home for his meal at noon, the children began making inquiries. It was thought that he might have secured a ride to Tisch Mills where he has numerous relatives and gone there for a stay but a telephone message brought the information that Walesh had not been there. Coast Guard Joins Hunt Men in the neighborhood were enlisted in the search last night together with members of the U.S. coast guard station, and the beach, Neshota Park, and the woods north and west of Two Rivers were thoroughly combed last night and this morning. But no traces of the aged man were found. Walesh made his home with his daughter, Mrs. Frank Mach, Twenty-first and Lincoln Ave. He had two sons, Wenzil and Albert, both engaged in the meat market business on the east side. He has lived a retired life for some time and had often gone away on short trips so little was thought of his disappearance until late Friday afternoon when he failed to return to the daughterï¿½s home. May Have Met With Foul Play First the fishermen were enlisted as it was thought that Walesh had not strayed far and would soon be located. But when the search continued up the beach and to the fields and woods, it was decided that Walesh had wandered farther or perhaps met with foul play. Search is Continued Today the search continued with an even larger number of searchers, friends and neighbors in the vicinity of the home joining in the search. In all of the inquiries no one has been found who saw the aged man after the daughter reported his having left her home Friday morning, presumably on a short walk. As the day went on and no trace was found of Walesh it was the general belief that he had probably been stricken suddenly ill at some lonely spot. He had an operation about a year ago and it was reported at that time that he had a very weak heart. Manitowoc Herald Times, Saturday September 10, 1927\n\nANGELA E.

Mrs. Wranovsky was an aunt of Adolph Nohlachek, proprietor of the Northwestern House in this city and had visited here. Physicians expressed the belief that the shock of the fall, rather than injuries the aged woman sustained, caused death. Mrs. Wranovsky, who was 76, was visiting at the home of her brother, James Nohlachek at Menominee. She had been warned against attempting to walk down stairs owing to her advanced age, but on the day of the tragedy, had insisted upon doing so, and according to Mr. Nohlachek, the only witness to the accident, had started down the stairs when she fell. Death resulted almost instantly, the aged woman struck on the side of her head. Left Tisch Mills 3 Weeks Ago Mrs. Wranovsky had been at Menominee only three weeks, having made her home with a daughter at Tisch Mills previous to that time. The deceased was born in Bohemia and came to America more than seventy years ago. She is survived by three brothers, John Nohlachek of Birch Creek, James of Menominee and Picus of Arizona; two sons, living in Oconto Falls and North Dakota; and one daughter, Mrs. Wencel Janda of Tisch Mills.
