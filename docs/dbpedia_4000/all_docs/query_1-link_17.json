        "text": "Catholic bishop (1896–1992)\n\nJohn Baptist Franz (October 29, 1896 – July 3, 1992) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as bishop of the Diocese of Dodge City in Kansas (1951–1959) and bishop of the Diocese of Peoria in Illinois (1959–1971).\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Franz was born on October 29, 1896, in Springfield, Illinois, to Fridolin and Louisa (née Reisch) Franz.[1] His father worked in the meat packing business.[2] He recalled that his parents \"provided us an atmosphere that made us conscious we were Catholic and that we belonged to the Church. I never wanted to be anything but a priest.\"[2]\n\nFranz received his early education at the parochial school of SS. Peter and Paul Parish in Springfield.[1] Between 1910 and 1917, he attended St. Francis Solanus High School and the Franciscan College, both in Quincy, Illinois.[1] Franz then studied at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.[2]\n\nPriesthood\n\n[edit]\n\nFranz was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Alton by Archbishop John J. Glennon on June 13, 1920.[3] From 1920 to 1927, as a member of the Granite City-based Diocesan Mission Band, he traveled around Central Illinois and Eastern Missouri to give missions and retreats.[2] In 1926, he was assigned to establish a campaign fund for a cathedral complex in Springfield.[2]\n\nFranz became administrator of St. Mary's Parish and superintendent of St. Isidore High School, both in Farmersville, Illinois, in 1927.[1] From 1935 to 1951, he served as rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Springfield[1] He was named a papal chamberlain in December 1941, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in April 1945.[2]\n\nBishop of Dodge City\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 27, 1951, Franz was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Dodge City by Pope Pius XII.[3] He received his episcopal consecration on August 29, 1951, from Cardinal Samuel Stritch, with Bishops Mark Carroll and William O'Connor serving as co-consecrators.[3]\n\nBishop of Peoria\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 8, 1959, Pope John XXIII appointed Franz as bishop of the Diocese of Peoria.[3] From 1962 to 1965, Franz attended the Second Vatican Council in Rome. In response to his implementation of the Council's reforms, some people expressed enthusiasm, while others caution to such rapid changes.[4] The political turmoil of the 1960s also added to his challenges, but he still managed to create 17 new grade schools, two new high schools, one Newman Centre, four new parishes, four missions, and elevate eight missions to parish status.\n\nOn May 24, 1971, Pope Paul VI accepted Franz's resignation as bishop of Peoria.[2] John Franz died in Peoria on July 3, 1992, at age 95.[3] He is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Peoria.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
