Rev. William L. Forst, 81, retired, of St. Louis, Mo., the former pastor of St. Aloysius Catholic Church, Baring, died on September 14, 2009, of complications of cancer. He was at the same time the pastor of St. John’s Catholic Church Memphis, Mo. He served as pastor at the Baring parish from April 1976 until August 1982.

He was born on June, 1928, the son of the late Frank A. and Bertha (Gulath) Forst, of Richmond Heights, Mo. He attended Kenrick Seminary and was ordained to the Catholic priesthood in St. Louis, Mo. by Archbishop Joseph Ritter on April 3, 1954. His first assignment was at Immaculate Conception Parish, Jefferson City from 1954 until 1959. When the new diocese of Jefferson City was established in 1956, he became incardinated to priestly ministry into the new diocese. In 1960 Bishop Joseph Marling asked Fr.
