From Nia Vardalos, writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, comes the hilarious comedy My Life in Ruins. Georgia (Nia Vardalos) has lost her kefi (Greek for "mojo"). Discouraged by her lack of direction in life, she works as a travel guide, leading a ragtag group of tourists (including Richard Dreyfuss, Alexis Georgoulis, Rachel Dratch, Harland Williams, and Jareb Dauplaise) as she tries to show them the beauty of her native Greece. While opening their eyes to an exotic foreign land, she too begins to see things in new waysâ€”finding her kefi in the process.

Donald Petrie (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Miss Congeniality) directs My Life in Ruins from a script by Emmy winner Mike Reiss. The film is produced by Michelle Chydzik Sowa, Nathalie Marciano, and Mark Albela, with coproducers Peter Friedlander and Denise O'Dell. Executive producers are Gary Goetzman, Tom Hanks, Peter Safran, and Rita Wilson. Denis Pedregosa is associate producer.
