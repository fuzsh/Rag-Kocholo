        "text": "Kelsea Ballerini Says New Album ‘Patterns’ Won’t Be What You Expect\n\nKelsea Ballerini announced her 5th full-length album, Patterns, will be released on October 25th. However, don’t be expecting mushy-gushy love songs!\n\nThe “Miss Me More” singer shared a graphic on her social media with the news of the album’s release date. Ballerini has been through a lot lately with a divorce and starting a new relationship. So, what can fans expect to hear with this new album?\n\nKelsea Ballerini Says New Album ‘Patterns’ Won’t Be What You Expect\n\nIn 2022, Kelsea Ballerini and fellow country artist Morgan Evans ended their marriage. She opened up about the fallout in her Rolling Up The Welcome Mat EP and short film. Now, she seems happy in a new relationship with Outer Banks star Chase Stokes. So, which side of her life are we going to get with this new album?\n\nBallerini tells The Associated Press, “I think that people probably expect this really happy-go-lucky, love, mushy, gushy record from me. That’s not the case. And I’m really proud of that. It would have been easy to, I think, just collect the really beautiful parts of my life that I’ve dusted off and found the last couple of years. But that’s not the fullness of my experience.” It sounds like this could end up being an emotionally charged album. She’s certainly got a story to tell and we are itching to hear what she has to say. Things might look good when you’re posing for photographs, but there’s always more to the story than what appears. We might get a good glimpse behind the curtain with Patterns.\n\nThat’s life! Sometimes, you have to force a smile to seem okay. Even on happy days, you can still be dealing with stuff. The singer says that this album is about, “analyzing yourself and the people that you love the most in order to grow,” per The Associated Press. It’ll be exciting to hear her get real when the new album drops on October 25. In the meantime, she’s already released a single with the ever-popular Noah Kahan called “Cowboys Cry Too” and she will be dropping a single tonight (Thursday, August 8) at midnight called, “Sorry Mom.”\n\nKelsea is on a roll right now. She’ll officially make her debut as a judge on NBC’s The Voice in 2025! See the message she shared on X (formerly Twitter) below.\n\nCort Freeman was born and raised in Metro Detroit. He was named Clarkston High School 2009 Class Clown 13 years after graduating. Totally normal thing to happen. That’s thanks to his time spent as an Intern at Comedy Central and Social Media Correspondent for The Colbert Report. Cort has done comedy across the country, both standing up and sitting down. When he’s not trying to make you laugh on-air and online, he’s probably at home enjoying his favorite shows like Seinfeld, South Park, and The Office. He’s also totally uncomfortable writing about himself in the third person. Cort enjoys writing about comedy, food, sports, and entertainment. So, basically anything and everything."
