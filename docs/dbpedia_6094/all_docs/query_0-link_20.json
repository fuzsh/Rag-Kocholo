The movie \"My Life in Ruins\" follows Georgia, a tour guide in Greece, as she struggles to entertain a group of difficult tourists. Her bus breaks down, they stay in run-down hotels, and the tourists seem uninterested in her historical lessons. However, over the course of the trip Georgia bonds with some of the tourists, especially Irv. By the end of the tour, Georgia has opened up more and gained confidence in her abilities as a guide. The film highlights the challenges of being a tour guide, from uncooperative tourists to unreliable transportation and accommodations, but also shows how forming connections with clients can make the job more rewarding.",
