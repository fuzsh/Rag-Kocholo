For example, while Farewell My Concubine is an example of superior, powerful film making, it isn't the sort of movie you embrace for the pure magic of the entertainment it...\n\nHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\n\nOne could easily make the argument that How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a perfectly acceptable diversion.

It starts out with a terrific premise, ripe with the potential for the kind of political satire we haven't seen on the big scr..."
