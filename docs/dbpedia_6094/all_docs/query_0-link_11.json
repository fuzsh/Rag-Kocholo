        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The whirlwind behind the cinematic maelstrom that was \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" a little, poorly reviewed nothing of a movie that went on to become one of the big indies of all time in 2002, is bearing down on us once again.\n\nNia Vardalos has returned with another movie on a Grecian theme (hey, whatever works, right?), and once again, it's a minor piece of formulaic fluff destined to be saddled with a blizzard of bad reviews, this one among them.\n\nWill they matter? Well, freak lightning like \"Big Fat\" only strikes once, so Vardalos probably shouldn't get her hopes up.Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe \"My Life in Ruins,\" in which Vardalos plays an American working as a tour guide in Athens, will please a great many moviegoers.\n\nThe movie was shot entirely in Greece, for one thing (except for brief snippets caught in Spain for some reason), and the impossibly bright vacation destination looks as beautiful as it did in last summer's shameless celebration of awfulness, \"Mamma Mia!\"\n\nVardalos doesn't look bad either. With a face as cute as a ground squirrel's, she charms effortlessly (why Vardalos hasn't had a long, successful career in network sitcoms continues to mystify), and it was apparently not lost on this film's director (Donald Petrie) that the star has great gams.\n\n\"My Life in Ruins\" follows the same narrative trajectory of flicks like \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back.\" There's not an ounce of originality here as Georgia (Vardalos), single and miserable, gets her mojo back -- or kefi, as the Greeks apparently call it -- with the help of her studly tour bus driver, Poupi Kakas (Greek actor Alexis Georgoulis).\n\nLimp story arc notwithstanding, the movie does make a few mildly amusing observations about the way people behave when they become tourists abroad, which should feel familiar to anyone who's ever taken the Staten Island Ferry. (Really? You're taking a picture of that?)\n\nAmerican tourists are particularly singled out here for wanting everything that's wonderfully Greek to be more American, and we find ourselves sighing along with Georgia as her charges are less interested in UNESCO World Heritage sites than buying cheap trinkets and getting some ice cream.\n\n(Remarkably, \"My Life in Ruins\" was the first movie ever to receive permission to film at the Acropolis.)\n\nGetting second billing behind Vardalos is Richard Dreyfuss, who delivers his best Yoda impression as a recently widowed tourist who has nuggets of worldly wisdom for the lovelorn Georgia.\n\nAt the end of the movie Dreyfuss's character dies, a plot point so icky and gross that you just know this flick is destined to become a hit."
