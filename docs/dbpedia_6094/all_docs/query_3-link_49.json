        "text": "My Life In Ruins trailer\n\nMY LIFE IN RUINS may sound like a catastrophic sequel to Nia Vardalos's 2002 hit, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but the only connection is Greece itself.\n\nIn this one, a noticeably slimmer Vardalos plays a Greek American history professor down on her luck. Having lost her job at a university in Athens, she's been forced to work as a tourist guide. Pangloss is the name of the company and Vardalos's Georgia is having difficulty in reaching its required standards of Panglossian optimism.\n\nThe source of Georgia's discontent is the philistinism of the tourists she ferries around all day. While she's aching to infuse them with her passion for the grandeur that was classical Greece, they're interested only in shopping, swimming and the nearest comfort stop. What's more, they're just as unimpressed with her as she is with them. Their bad reports have seen her fall to the bottom of the company's food chain - assigned to the cheapest hotels, the most decrepit bus and the most unruly customers.\n\nThis premise gives the director, Donald Petrie ( Miss Congeniality), licence to go for broke in the national stereotype department. He wheels out a busload of actors who take the need to be obnoxious so seriously that any impulse towards humour gets lost amid the mugging. There's the usual complement - a snooty English family led by Caroline Goodall, dressed as if for an outing with Hercule Poirot; a couple of painfully convivial Australians (Natalie O'Donnell and Neighbours graduate Simon Gleeson) glued to their beer cans; two Spanish divorcees (Maria Botto and Maria Adanez) desperately in need of an Almodovar movie; and an assortment of hyperactive performers competing for the title \"ugliest American\".\n\nOne of these is Richard Dreyfuss's Irv, the joker in the pack, who likes to interrupt Georgia's dissertations with commentaries of his own. You don't have to be clairvoyant, however, to realise that this display of mutual hostility is all camouflage. The twinkle in Dreyfuss's eye shines so brightly that he might as well be wearing a sign announcing that it's his mission in life to jolly Georgia out of the state she's in.\n\nPetrie is also aiming to give you more than your money's worth in armchair travel. We begin at the Acropolis and move on to Delphi, Olympus, the Parthenon and the Plaka.\n\nAnd more important, there's romance. Unlikely as it seems, everybody here eventually turns out to be a romantic. Irv, for instance, is bravely hiding his grief over the death of his wife whose ghost turns up in one scene played by Rita Wilson, whose real-life husband, Tom Hanks, happens to be one of the film's producers. And there's Georgia's love interest, who comes heavily disguised under a Yeti-like beard and a manner so gruff that she spends the first part of the film labouring under the impression that he doesn't speak English. We can easily guess otherwise.\n\nHandsome Greek TV star Alexis Georgoulis has the part and as his courtship of Georgia progresses, he gradually makes more of his face visible by shaving off the beard and cutting his hair. If nothing else, it's a novel variation on the striptease. It's also supposed to be part of Georgia's path to enlightenment. In falling for the man behind the beard she's supposed to see the world through eyes no longer blinded by preconceived notions based on superficialities.\n\nAll this would be fine if we were persuaded to share her new enchantment with her travelling companions but they're still stuck with the wardrobe of cliches they set out with.\n\nThe script offers a few diversions from the main game. One of the oldest members of the group has taken up shoplifting as a hobby. Georgia also has to deal with Alistair McGowan, an unfunny British comic who's been cast as a rival tour guide intent on sabotaging her efforts to keep her job. But Petrie, who handled slapstick with ease in Miss Congeniality, has lost his timing with this one. There's none of the blithely nonsensical spirit that infuses the atmosphere when actors are enjoying themselves. This lot are trying too hard and the result falls far short of the alchemy that comes from real inspiration."
