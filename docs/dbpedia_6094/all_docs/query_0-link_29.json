Even the sight of breathtaking ancient monuments don&rsqu...\n\nMight as well be called My Big Fat Greek Package Holiday.\n\nRarely has a film centered on a character so superficial and unconvincing, played with such unrelenting sameness. I didn’t hate it...\n\nHalf the time I wanted everyone to shut up so I could hear the tour guide lecture on the Temple of Hephaestus, or wherever. Then I wanted them...\n\nFeels like its been churned out by some auto-plot generator.\n\nThink Carry On without the sophisticated humour or enlightened views on foreign stereotyping.\n\nVardalos will never go broke playing it Greek and playing it safe for her fans. But that’s no way for an actress to find her kefi.\n\nThe film contains a constant stream of lowbrow gags and pratfalls as Georgia lurches her way towards happiness, romance and a secure job...\n\nPetrie, who handled slapstick with ease in Miss Congeniality, has lost his timing with this one. There’s none of the blithely nonsensical spi...\n\nSo why did I have such a good time at such a spectacularly middling movie? Nia Vardalos.\n\nVardalos huffs that the culture that made her a millionaire is made of slackers, molesters and thieves.\n\nThis mess – henceforth to be known as My Big Fat Greek Tragedy – is the most embarrassing thing to come out of the Eastern Med since Prin...\n\nIt’s one thing to poke fun of stereotypical Greek behavior, but it’s another to bitch about the tourists who clog the already varicose...\n\nThe folks responsible for My Big Fat Greek Wedding have made My Life in Ruins, a second cute, shoddy-looking movie.\n\nThe bland cinematography fits with the unimaginative script and the drab direction of Petrie.\n\nFans of fluff comedies filled with soft smiles and knowing glances will likely welcome the return of Nia Vardalos in My Life in Ruins.\n\nAs a laughing-through-tears jokester tourist, Richard Dreyfuss provides the only moments of real acting, as opposed to overacting, mugging, an...\n\nNotably thinner, less awkward and a lot less charming, Vardalos is back with My Life in Ruins, a desperate, crass and probably futile attempt...\n\nIf only there was something – anything -- else about this broad, clunky comedy to keep its name from being an oh-so-obvious punchline.\n\nA quasi-sequel to My Big Fat Greek Wedding that shamelessly recycles the sitcom-and-schmaltz formula of Vardalos' breakthrough hit.\n\nThe simple charms of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the 2002 small movie that thrust Vardalos into the limelight, are nowhere to be found in t...\n\nThe film and all its characters are as tacky and charmless at the end as they are on first impressions.\n\nDefiantly square and focus-group engineered to appeal to those harboring a soft spot for \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" the Nia Vardalos vehicle...\n\nA subtext of self-criticism runs through Vardalos’s material. Over and over characters tell her, \"You’re not funny. Stop trying.\" Is it...\n\nMy Life in Ruins is a middle-aged Hallmark chick flick that makes you wish you were on a Greek vacation (and not, in fact, watching the movie)."
