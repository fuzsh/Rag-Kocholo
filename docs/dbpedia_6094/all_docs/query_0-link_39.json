Very funny. Not exactly like the movie but we liked it. It is always hard to move on when they change cast members. At least it was just the husband and everyone else was the same. The flow was not the same as the movie. Something was different... can't really explain it. But it was worth getting, very funny.\n\n1 of 1 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nMarc B. (marcb)\n\nReviewed on 3/31/2011...\n\nSequels to blockbuster movies typically aren't good ideas (especially when they ignore what happens in the last ten minutes of the movie and change the main characters' names!). However, My Big Fat Greek Life is simply hilarious -- to be honest, I like it better than the movie (which I adore). Rita Wilson's guest-star role as Toula/Nia's slightly daffy cousin Arianna shouldn't be missed, nor should the episode in which Ian/Thomas falsely claims to be friends with Pete Sampras. It's an absolute shame that this didn't even make it to a full season, because I have no hesitation in saying that it's better than any comedy currently on TV. 5/5.\n\n1 of 1 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nA Very Short-Lived, Mostly LacklusterTV Series\n\nM. Hart | USA | 02/23/2004\n\n(3 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Following the enormous success of the 2002 film \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", Brad Grey, Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos (who wrote and starred in the film), along with 8 other people, produced a TV series sitcom with a similar cast and plot entitled \"My Big Fat Greek Life\". The series aired on CBS in the spring of 2003, but poor viewer ratings brought about its quick demise after only 7 episodes. Characters that appeared in the TV series that had also appeared in the original film and remained unchanged were Maria Portokalos (Lainie Kazan), Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine), Nick Portokalos (Louis Mandylor), cousin Nikki (Gia Carides) and Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). Nia Vardalos, who played Fortula 'Tula' Portokalos in the film, changed her character's name to Nia Portokalos Miller for the TV series. John Corbett, who played Tula's husband Ian Miller in the original film, was unable to appear in the TV series due to a previous commitment to another TV series. (That TV series, \"Lucky\", was cancelled by Fox after 13 episodes.) So, in place of John Corbett, Nia's husband in the TV series was Thomas Miller as played by Steven Eckholdt.Whereas the 2002 film had been expertly written and successfully drew the audience into its tale of self-discovery and love for its main character, 'Tula' Portokalos, the TV series instead focused primarily on jokes and less engaging, often predictable plot lines. My rating for each of the seven episodes, as well as each episode's air date, are as follows:1. \"The House Gift\" (3, 2/24/2003). After returning from their honeymoon, Nia and Thomas are surprised to learn that Gus and Maria have purchased them a new house.2. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (3.5, 3/3/2003). Following the hospitalization of a close friend, Maria and Gus decide to write wills that give the restaurant to Nia instead of Nick.3. \"Ariana\" (4, 3/9/2003). Cousin Ariana (guest appearance by Rita Wilson) visits from Greece following her divorce from her cheating ex-husband. Nia wants to help Ariana build an independent life, but Gus and Maria have other plans for her.4. \"The Free Lunch\" (1.5, 3/16/2003). The worst written and edited episode of the series, Nia tries to get a loading zone permit for the restaurant. Notable guest appearances include Ken Campbell Rusty Schwimmer.5. \"Big Night\" (4.5, 3/30/2003). After Thomas foolishly tries to impress Gus by lying that he knows Pete Sampras, Nia, Voula and Nikki run into Yanni (himself) instead.6. \"Nick Moves Out\" (4.5, 4/6/2003). Tired of being taken care of, Nick decides to get an apartment of his own in spite of his parents' objections.7. \"Greek Easter\" (3.5, 4/13/2003). Nia wants to impress the family by cooking Easter dinner and surprising Gus with a surprise visitor. Notable guest appearnace: John Aniston.\n\nMy overall rating for the short-lived TV series \"My Big Fat Greek Life\" is 3 out of 5 stars. Had the same writing quality been applied to the TV series as the film, it would have likely been able to sustain better ratings and had more than 7 episodes. Unfortunately, the series' two best episodes (#6 and #7) didn't appear until the number of viewers had dropped following several lackluster episodes and one terrible one.\"\n\nDon't Waste Your Money\n\nD. Mart | Mountain View, CA | 11/13/2003\n\n(1 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Why this short-lived sitcom is on DVD is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: the first episode is pretty good, with the stars doing a great job. But the reamaining six episodes only get worse and worse; with star Nina Vardalos the only reason that make them worth watching; while the other stars talents are wasted on the barely mediocre writing. The storylines of episodes 2-7 sound very promising, yet all seems to be lost in the scripts. The jokes are far-fetched; not funny; and everything that makes the movie stand out from all low-brow basic sitcom humor (ie everything that makes it \"smart\") is absent from the television series.Don't waste your money on this DVD. Instead, purchase good sitcoms such as The King of Queens, Spin City, Will & Grace, Cheers, Frasier, Married ... With Children, etc.My Big Fat Greek Life: great talents wasted on a terrible show.\"\n\nSooooooo Funny!\n\nChrisoula Perdziola | Pittsburgh, PA | 02/05/2005\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I thought this series was great! It tool a few episodes not to long for John Corbett's pretty face, but once you get over it, you realize how great this show is! Not sure why it was pulled becasue there are so many sitcoms that are so horrible that have been on for awhile. Nia and the rest of the cast are great. That's why I am buying this DVD! Nia, PLEASE make a sequel to MBFGW! I swear, it's my life too-even the crazy yaya! Enjoy!\n\n\"\n\nA BIG FAT LET DOWN\n\nMichael C. Poutous | Texas | 07/25/2005\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"This show deserved more of a chance than it got. Seven Episodes is not enough to establish every show. Some shows get off to great starts, while others take a little while to catch on. If the network would have let the first season finish who knows what might have become of it? Episodes six and seven are the strongest out of the seven total... very telling. Many Greek-Americans were excited to FINALLY have their own show (so to speak). What a Big Fat Let Down....\"\n\nActually, very entertaining show!\n\nBrian C. Hull | 04/16/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"It's amazing to see the negative revues of this show from people who seem negative. If you watch the show to be entertained, which was the purpose of this show, you will not be disappointed! It is funny, light-hearted, and is not meant to be a competition to the movie, but rather a chance for us to continue with the characters we loved from the film. My only disappointment was having only 7 episodes. For those who criticize the show for being cancelled so quickly, this is not the only good show to meet an untimely demise. (look at Firefly, another excellent entertaining show which was cancelled after 11 or 12 episodes).\n\nThe first episode, \"The House Gift\" is a great reintroduction to the characters. Yes, Toula is now Nia, and Ian is now Thomas. I was able to get over that fact with little pain, so I don't see the big deal for some who cannot seem to live with the new names, or the fact that Thomas is played by a different actor. It's a TV show, not real life, and these are actors. Things change. Get over it and enjoy the show.\n\n#2 - The Empire Strikes Back - Nick is hilarious in this episode, and Voula is great. (In fact, she is the best and most funny character in this series.) Gus and Maria are preparing a will to see who will inherit the \"empire\" (restaurant and house). Nia inherits the restaurant, and she is none to happy about the aspect of being just like her father. Watch this one just to see the scene with Voula, Nia and Nick as the women try to approach the subject of who will get the restaurant to Nick.\n\n#3 - The Free Lunch - man does this one seem to get the criticism! This one is funny too, not a classic, but it is funny, which is what this show is about. Nia messes up an \"arrangement\" the parents have with the police, and it is up to her, Voula (again the best character, she is hilarious!) and Nicky to save the day.\n\n#4 - Arianna - this one seems liked by most who have watched this series and it is funny, but the funniest part is Voula giving Arianna a mock interview!\n\n#5 - Big Night - Seeing the three woman scream \"Yanni!!!!\" and run toward him like mad school girls is reason enough to watch this episode again and again! Hilarious!\n\n#6 - Nick Moves Out - Maria and Nick are the main reasons to watch this episode. Even at only 6 episodes so far, character development is great for these two. Too bad the show couldn't continue as I'm sure we would have seen character development of the others.\n\n#7 - Greek Easter - \"Best Easter ever!\" Funny episode, sad to know it was the last.\n\nSo ends the show, which was such a shame. No sex scenes, no murders, no missing children, no medical emergencies, no infidelity, no profanity. What a shame. With those it might have lasted longer. But for those of us who don't need all of that crap in our shows, My Big Fat Greek Life is a reminder that you don't have to be crude to be funny, you don't have to be obscene to be entertaining.\""
