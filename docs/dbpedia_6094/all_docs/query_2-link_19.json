Each slate of titles offers a wide variety of quality films, both classics and recent award-winners, so students and community members can all find something they will enjoy. Each film is combined with special programming that complements the storyline and provides a different twist on classic cinema.\n\nTo learn more about Films or get involved, head to our Blugold Connect+ Page!\n\nFilm Screening Information\n\nUse the link below to see our full series lineup, dates, and movie descriptions. Start times are accurate but close times will vary depending on the movie's runtime so estimated close times are listed. All UAC Films are free to students, faculty/staff, and community members.\n\n*Movies held on the Campus Mall will use Woodland Theater in Davies Center as a rain site.\n\nInternational Film Society\n\nFor nearly 60 years the UW-Eau Claire International Film Society has represented a wide variety of countries that bring about a better understanding of other peoples and cultures, and instill a lifelong appreciation for the art of film.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the International Film Committee to assist in film selection, please reach out to Joann Martin (martinjo@uwec.edu)."
