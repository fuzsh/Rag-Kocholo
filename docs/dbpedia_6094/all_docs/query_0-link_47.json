        "meta_description": "Georgia came to Greece to follow a man. Cast aside, she finds herself alone and adrift in this foreign land. Eventually, her passion for history leads her to a job as a tour guide. But Georgia is bored, and has lost her 'kefi' (Greek for mojo) to boot. When Poupi replaces her regular driver at the last minute, Georgia thinks that her luck has just hit rock bottom. Thankfully, Georgia's latest batch of tourists is a more lively bunch than she's anticipated, and in between bouts with rival tour guide Nico, she manages to form a genuine connection with wisecracking widower Irv. Irv is a solo vacationer who maintains a jovial facade despite the fact that he misses his late wife dearly. With a little help from Irv, Georgia comes to realize that true love may be closer than she thinks.",
