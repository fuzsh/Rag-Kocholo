        "text": "What the office did for me (short read) There is a lot of debate about the pros and cons of working from the office or from home. Some companies I know are ditching offices altogether, others are adopting hybrid working practices. I don’t profess to be an expert but wanted to reminisce about what I enjoyed about working in the office and see if anything resonates with others. Learning and development: in all my jobs, especially the early ones learning my trade, I learnt a huge amount from sitting with colleagues, listening, absorbing and being able to ask the dumb questions. Even when I was a CFO I would wander through sales, marketing and tech departments doing exactly the same thing. I not only learned how to do my job I also learned business skills such as presenting in front of real people and how to interact effectively in physical meetings. Making connections and teamwork: sitting with your peers, managers or indeed any colleague was a great way to interact and build relationships and effective teams. I suspect there is a high correlation between great teams and commercial success; a real team spirit frankly made the tough times, when you needed to pull together, much easier. In my view camaraderie and team spirit are fundamental to building loyalty to each-other and our organisations. As a CFO I sometimes (ok often) had to ask my teams to go above and “way” beyond the call of duty: I don’t think they did that just for the pay and bens! In my opinion, effective team working helps drive fulfilment and loyalty and ultimately staff retention. Socialising and wellbeing: as a young guy starting out in London in the 80s the office was a big part of my social life. I made some lifelong mates from the bonds I made in and after work. Indeed I met my wife through a friend who trained with me in London. My working life was fantastically enhanced by being physically with people in and around the office. What’s my point? Well, before we denigrate the working from the office too much let’s make sure that we really understand the staff development, loyalty/teamwork and wellbeing aspects of having our teams together physically. These may seem like “soft” benefits as opposed to the harder $ related savings of cutting office space but they are vitally important. Would the ‘Great Resignation’ have been as marked if we had not been wfh? #workingfromoffice #wellbeing"
