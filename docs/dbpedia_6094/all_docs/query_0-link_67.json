        "text": "MADRID — Alicante’s macro Ciudad de la Luz studio, the most important complex in Spain, greenlight its first shoot in 2005. Since then, such big European co-productions as the $118 million “Asterix at the Olympic Games” and Jean-Jacques Annaud’s $53 million comedy “His Majesty Minor” have shot there.\n\nThe first U.S. pic to shoot at Ciudad, Donald Petrie’s romantic comedy “My Life in Ruins” toplining Nia Vardalos, rolled last fall.\n\nDesigned by Gary Bastien, Ciudad de la Luz’s $442.5 million mega-complex began second-phase construction last summer. Additions include a 398,263-square-foot super stage, replete with a 27-acre backlot, three other soundstages ranging from 6,458 to 10,764 square feet, and a 32,292-square-foot administrative building.\n\nBacked by Valencia’s regional government, the Ciudad will be totally completed by 2009, including the jewel in its crown, Europe’s only customized surface and deep tank, according to Ciudad sources.\n\nBut Ciudad could face growing competition from Madrid. Producers associations UPCT and AMA have teamed with real estate company Gestesa to promote Madrid’s Ciudad del Audiovisual, to be built in Loeches, a small town northeast of Madrid. Covering 49 acres, Ciudad del Audiovisual will host production facilities, offices, soundstages, a film school, hotels and a shopping mall. A private-sector project, it’s scheduled to open in 2011.\n\nIn the Basque town of Oiartzun, near San Sebastian, construction began last September on Zinealdea, an 893,400-square-foot production center backed by public and private companies.\n\nThe three Zinealdea buildings will house film and TV studios, production services, offices, a film school, a film commission and a leisure area. Zinealdea should be ready mid-2009, and is being positioned as a strategic meeting point between Europe and Madrid’s film and TV industries.\n\nThe major challenge for these studios is building a broad local talent base. Top craft and technical talent exists, however. Last year, Spanish set decorator Pilar Revuelta and makeup artists David Marti and Montse Ribe won Oscars for their work in “Pan’s Labyrinth.”"
