Have an account? .\n\n\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" premiered in 2003 and stars Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nThe movie is based on an illustrated book by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long.\n\nMcConaughey almost didn't get cast because he's 10 years older than Hudson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie is based on a book.\n\nThe movie was inspired by the comedic cartoon guide \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days: The Universal Don'ts of Dating.\"\n\nMany of the rules that Andie Anderson follows to get Ben Barry to break up with her came straight from the text â€” like talking in a baby voice, immediately calling him her boyfriend, and dropping the \"L-bomb\" super early.\n\nAndie's two BFFs are named after the authors.\n\nThe comedic graphic novel was written by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long, who lent their names to Andie's best friends in the film, Michelle (played by Kathryn Hahn) and Jeannie (played by Annie Parisse).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGwyneth Paltrow was considered for the role of Andie.\n\nProducer Lynda Obst told Entertainment Weekly that Paltrow was originally interested in the role of Andie Anderson, which later went to Kate Hudson.\n\nBut scheduling took too long, and Paltrow was cast in \"View from the Top\" (2003) instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatthew McConaughey almost didn't get his role either.\n\nIn the same interview with Entertainment Weekly, Obst said she worried that McConaughey was too old to star opposite Hudson. At the time, Hudson was 23 and McConaughey was 33.\n\nTo counter those arguments, Hudson said, \"I'm married to a 36-year-old, and it's not like he's ancient.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo prepare for her character's job at a women's magazine, Hudson shadowed Anna Wintour.\n\nHudson also told Entertainment Weekly that she spent a day with Vogue editor-in-chief Wintour in order to research her role as a \"how-to\" columnist for a women's magazine.\n\nThe actress said she prepared by tearing out \"all of these how-tos in Cosmo and Glamour,\" which are things she said she usually skips over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's an awkward spelling error in the opening credits.\n\nThe opening credits feature a montage of Composure covers, and the first one shown has a headline about how to \"loose your belly.\"\n\nSince the right form of that word (\"lose\") is in the movie's title, the mistake is even more glaring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie's director encouraged the actors to improvise.\n\nDirector Donald Petrie told BBC in 2014 that he kept the actors on their toes.\n\n\"I'm very sneaky as a director. I'd go over to Kate and say, 'OK, in this next take, don't tell Matthew, but do this.' She would do it. What's great is that, because they're such consummate professionals, they never break character. They just go with it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, some of Andie's most iconic moments weren't scripted.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it was Hudson's idea to toss the veggie platter in the air during Ben's poker night.\n\nShe also apparently ad-libbed the line, \"You can't watch Meg Ryan for two hours and not be thinking about another girl,\" among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHahn's audition didn't go so well.\n\nHahn played Andie's friend Michelle, but the actress initially worried she wouldn't get the part because her cell phone went off in the middle of her audition.\n\n\"It was the worst thing that could have possibly happened,\" she told Entertainment Weekly in 2018. \"I answered it and improvised it as part of the scene, but then I had to pretend like it wasn't continually vibrating as my friend Patrick kept calling.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though her karaoke moment was cringeworthy, Hudson is a skilled singer in real life.\n\nDespite Andie's off-key performance of \"You're So Vain\" at Ben's advertising gala, Hudson is a naturally talented singer.\n\nHudson has gone on to impress fellow celebrities with her voice and even guest-starred on \"Glee\" as college dance teacher Cassandra July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcConaughey bought himself a motorcycle for the movie.\n\nWhile Hudson was prepping with Wintour, McConaughey was doing some research of his own.\n\nIn an interview clip from \"E! News,\" McConaughey said he bought a motorcycle because his character, Ben, drives one in the film.\n\n\"I wanted to get comfortable on a motorcycle because I've seen too many people ride motorcycles or someone ride a horse in films where I'm like, 'You don't really ride a horse. You don't really ride a motorcycle,'\" he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe diamond jewelry used at the gala was real â€” and Andie's necklace is worth millions.\n\nReportedly, over $14 million worth of jewels were loaned to the film for the iconic \"Frost Yourself\" gala scene.\n\nHarry Winston created \"Isadora,\" the 80-carat diamond pendant necklace Andie dons in the scene. The necklace was named after dancer Isadora Duncan, and it sold for $5 million after Hudson wore it in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nMovies Movie\n\nAdvertisement"
