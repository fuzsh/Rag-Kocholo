        "text": "Big Fat Greek Nightmare\n\nWhat we have here is a big fat crying shame. I like Nia Vardalos. I like how her My Big Fat Greek Wedding became a surprise hit a few years back by refusing to give in to certain stereotypes that Hollywood bandies about, such as that women who are larger than a size two don’t exist, and certainly wouldn’t be worthy of or interested in love and romance and sex and having a fun and exciting life even if they did exist.\n\nSo it pains me to say that this, My Life in Ruins — which is all, “Ohmigiod, that girl from My Big Fat Greek Wedding gets to go to Greece at last *sigh*!” — is a steaming pile of stereotypes and sitcomery, a pathetic excuse for a comedy, a romance, and a movie. If you chanced to be acurst enough to have caught even a single episode of the TV spinoff from Wedding, the unimaginatively dubbed My Big Fat Greek Life, then you already have a general idea of what Ruins looks like: it’s the ruined version of what could have been a simple but charming movie. Ruins is populated by supposed adults who behave as if they are moronic children, it’s obvious and banal, its idea of humor is embarrassing, and it’s overseen by the tediously typical misogynistic concept that any woman who’s dissatisfied with her life must simply need to get laid. Because all other problems disappear if you are getting properly fucked on a regular basis.\n\nRuins thinks it’s sooo naughty, with its heroine in Vardalos’s (Connie and Carla) uptight Georgia, who just needs to learn how to cut loose and gets a few lessons in how to do that. But what I see is a story written by a man who sees women only as Hollywood has sold them to him. I might have expected better from screenwriter Mike Reiss — who has contributed to such subversive TV series as The Simpsons, The Critic, It’s Garry Shandling’s Show, and Sledge Hammer! — so who knows where he came up with this rude, annoying American trying to find herself in Greece. The joke is supposed to be, you see, that she’s the one who sees the people on the tour groups she leads as rude and annoying… except that, as the script dictates and as director Donald Petrie portrays it, the group of Looney Tunes Georgia finds herself saddled with on this latest five-day tour really are proudly dumb, proudly ignorant, and proudly indulgent of the worst stereotypes of wherever they’re from: the Americans are obnoxious, the Australians are rowdy drinkers, the Brits are snobbish, et cetera. There’s none of this nonsense that we’re seeing through Georgia’s eyes (though that’s what Ruins thinks it’s doing, I think): the film is deploying ethnic and nationalistic pigeonholing because it thinks we’ll be amused by it.\n\nIf Georgia really were the brainy, knowledgable academic she’s supposed to be, she’d know that there really are tour groups that specialize in precisely the kind of intellectual tourism she wants to practice, to the consternation of the mental midgets she’s squiring, who don’t want to hear about ancient gods and history and architecture and just want to go to the beach and shop. (One wonders why they’re on this tour at all…) But then there’d be no “funny” movie, and no quick and easy resolution to Georgia’s ennui: there’d be a subversive, thinky movie instead, and maybe Georgia would fall for the shy professorial type rather than the–"
