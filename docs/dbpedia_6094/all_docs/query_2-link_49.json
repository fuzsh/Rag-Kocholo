        "text": "TV work\n\nReiner studied acting as a teenager and later performed with a touring theater company. After serving in an entertainment unit during World War II, he made his Broadway debut in the musical Inside U.S.A. (1948–49). During that time he also began acting on television. In 1953–54 Reiner was a regular performer on the popular television comedy series Your Show of Shows, which starred Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. After the show ended, Reiner went to work on Caesar’s Hour (1954–57), a sketch comedy program. In addition to acting on the show, for which he won two Emmy Awards, he served as a writer. Reiner then was involved with a variety of projects, including a comedy routine called “The 2000 Year Old Man,” in which he interviewed Mel Brooks, who played the title character. The routine was later the basis for a number of successful recordings—one of which, The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000 (1997), earned a Grammy Award—as well as for a 1975 TV special.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn the early 1960s Reiner created The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66), in which he originally intended to portray protagonist Rob Petrie, a young comedy writer. However, Columbia Broadcasting System (now CBS) persuaded him to settle for being a producer, writer, and supporting actor. The pioneering show, which centers on Petrie’s work and home life, starred Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore (as Laura Petrie). Reiner won three Emmys for his writing, and the program was named outstanding comedy series in 1966. During that time he also wrote and directed the Broadway production Something Different (1967–68).\n\nFilm directing\n\nIn 1967 Reiner made his directorial debut with the feature film Enter Laughing, an adaptation of his semiautobiographical novel (1958), which had earlier been made into a Broadway play (1963–64). He then worked with Van Dyke on The Comic (1969), an intermittently successful homage to the silent-screen comics. Better was Where’s Poppa? (1970), a daring black comedy starring George Segal as a frustrated lawyer and Ruth Gordon as his senile mom. Reiner then returned to television for several years, cocreating and producing The New Dick Van Dyke Show (1971–74) among other projects, before returning to Hollywood to make Oh, God! (1977), a surprise blockbuster. It starred John Denver as a supermarket assistant manager who is summoned to be the messenger of God (played by George Burns in a highly praised performance). The charming comedy spawned several sequels, though Reiner was not involved with them. That hit was followed by the mediocre The One and Only (1978), starring Henry Winkler as a struggling actor who turns to professional wrestling to make money.\n\nReiner then made The Jerk, one of the biggest hits of 1979 and the film that launched comedian Steve Martin on the path to screen stardom. Martin starred as a dim-witted man who, after discovering that—unlike his adoptive parents—he is not Black, moves to St. Louis, where he encounters numerous problems. It was the first in a series of popular movies that Reiner made with Martin. Their next film was the black-and-white film-noir parody Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982), in which a private eye (Martin) interacts, through old film clips, with characters from a number of 1940s classics, including Barbara Stanwyck, Humphrey Bogart, and Ava Gardner. The movie, which featured a script by Reiner, Martin, and George Gipe, was a critical and commercial success.\n\nReiner then made The Man with Two Brains (1983), a sci-fi comedy that he also wrote with Martin and Gipe. Martin played a neurosurgeon attending a convention in Vienna. His faithless wife (Kathleen Turner in arguably her best comic performance) becomes insanely jealous when he falls in love with the disembodied brain of a murder victim (the voice of Sissy Spacek). Next was All of Me (1984), possibly Reiner’s most-sustained comic effort. It starred Martin as an attorney whose body becomes possessed by the soul of a sour millionaire (Lily Tomlin). Although the film continued the streak of hits for Reiner and Martin, it was the last they made together.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His last films, however, were largely forgettable. Bert Rigby, You’re a Fool (1989) was a musical comedy about a British coal miner (Robert Lindsay) who moves to Hollywood to become a star; Reiner wrote the screenplay. In 1993 Reiner directed Fatal Instinct (1993), a parody of violent thrillers, notably Basic Instinct (1992). His final film as director was the comedy That Old Feeling (1997), which starred Bette Midler and Dennis Farina as a long-divorced couple who rekindle their relationship at their daughter’s wedding."
