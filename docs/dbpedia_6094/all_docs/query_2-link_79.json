        "text": "Post Malone has released a snippet on his Instagram of his new duet with Tim McGraw, a song called “Wrong Ones.”\n\nMalone posted a couple of social media posts about the new song. In the first post on Instagram, Posty shared a clip of him skeet shooting as the country-sounding song played in the background. He captioned the post, “Track 1. Wrong Ones feat. @thetimmcgraw.”\n\nMany of Malone’s 25 million Instagram followers reacted to the clip, including Tim McGraw, who was one of over 100,000 people who liked the post. One fan wrote, “Bro has the same gun as me.” Another die-hard fan said, “This album! Can’t wait.” one more fan commented, “August 16th can’t come soon enough!”\n\nIn a second Instagram post about the new McGraw song, Post shared three different photos of himself skeet shooting, one in color and two in black and white. He captioned the post, “Wrong Ones with @thetimmcgraw coming next week:).”\n\nTim McGraw responded to that post, writing, “I’ve shot a few clays in my day @postmalone.” Another fan replied, “The 1st thing that I noticed was how you were holding the shotgun. It shows that you know what you’re doing without saying a word.” One more fan said, “Country looks good on you, man!!”\n\nMcGraw also posted a video of himself shooting clays on Instagram. He wrote, “I’ve shot a few clays in my day @postmalone… “Wrong Ones” out next Friday !!”\n\nRELATED: Luke Combs On Post Malone: ‘He’s So Nice’\n\nIn a little over a week (8/16), Post Malone’s long-awaited and much talked about F1 Trillion Country album will be out, and everyone can hear songs Postly did with Dolly Parton, Tim McGraw, Hank Williams Jr., Chris Stapleton, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, and many more.\n\nSongs from the project have been coming out almost weekly, and Malone’s song with Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help,” has already topped the charts at country radio. The album features 13 different country superstars in original duets with Malone.\n\nPost revealed the full track list last week, and on August 2, he announced to his twenty-six million Instagram followers that The Grand Ole Opry has asked him to make his debut. He posted the news to Instagram, writing, “What an honor @opry. See y’all in the circle with my friends @bradpaisley, @laineywilson, @vincegillofficial, @thewarandtreaty, @johnmichaelmontgomery on 8/14.”\n\nFor those who don’t know, performing on the Grand Ole Opry is not something an artist can ask to do: you have to be invited by the Opry to play the historical stage.\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
