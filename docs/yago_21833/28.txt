Item Number: 92492

Rare original photograph boldly signed by record-breaking aviator Amelia Earhart. Accompanied by the original typed transmittal letter signed by Amelia Earhart’s husband, George P. Putnam. Addressed to Jean Teal of Murdock, Nebraska, the letter reads: “Dear Jean: Miss Earhart has asked me to answer your note, as she herself is too busy to do much corresponding these days. Herewith we are sending you an autographed picture. The drawing you made she is keeping herself as she would like to add it to her collection. Very truly yours, G. P. Putnam.” Earhart’s husband George P. Putnam achieved fame as one of the most successful promoters of the 1930s particularly with the blockbuster publication of Charles Lindbergh’s autobiography “We” in 1927. He later offered to assist Earhart in writing the story of her flight across the Atlantic ocean which ultimately resulted in the publication of 20 Hrs., 40 Min and their marriage. Double matted and framed. The photograph measures 4.5 by 3.5 inches. The entire piece measures 13 inches by 12 inches.

Amelia Earhart recorded a number of firsts in her extraordinary aviation career: she was the first person, man or woman, to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland, Honolulu to Oakland. She was the first woman to fly the Atlantic in a plane (1928); the second person, and the first woman, to fly solo across the Atlantic (1932); and the first woman to fly solo across the continental U.S. She received the U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross for this record. She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.
