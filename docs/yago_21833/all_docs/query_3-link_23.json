        "text": "Noank\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe Square House\n\nChurch Street\n\nDear GPP\n\nThere are some things which should be writ before we are married — things we have talked over before — most of them.\n\nYou must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby chances in work which means most to me. I feel the move just now as foolish as anything I could do. I know there may be compensations but have no heart to look ahead.\n\nOn our life together I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. If we can be honest I think the difficulties which arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested deeply (or in passing) in anyone else.\n\nPlease let us not interfere with the others’ work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements. In this connection I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself, now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all times the confinements of even an attractive cage.\n\nI must exact a cruel promise and that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together.\n\nI will try to do my best in every way and give you that part of me you know and seem to want.\n\nA.E."
