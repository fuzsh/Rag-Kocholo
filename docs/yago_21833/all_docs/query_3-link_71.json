        "text": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nAmelia Earhart is best known for her flying endeavors, but many people don’t know about the fascinating and creative ways she funded her expeditions.\n\nCosmopolitan Editor, Lecturer\n\nIn 1928, Earhart became aviation editor for Cosmopolitan magazine. Her first article was published in November of that year. In her articles, she answered readers’ questions about aviation and promoted “the idea that aviation represented the pinnacle of modernity and progress that could bridge distances and bring cultures together.”1\n\nIn addition to her work for Cosmopolitan, Amelia sold best-selling books about her aviation experiences.\n\nAlso in 1928, Amelia’s publicist George Palmer Putnam (who later became her husband), organized a series of lecture tours to raise money.2\n\nDespite the grueling schedule of around thirty venues a month, Amelia enjoyed public speaking; her personality and enthusiasm captivated audiences. The topics of her lectures consisted of stories from her enterprises and insight into the art of aviation.\n\nPhilatelic Flights\n\nTo continue financing Amelia’s flights, Putnam devised a plan for Amelia to capitalize on a stamp-collecting craze that heightened in the 1930s.3 In 1932, Amelia carried 50 signed and postmarked letters on her first transatlantic flight. Following touchdown, Putnam sold the letters to collectors.\n\nAcross her multiple flights, Amelia transported thousands of letters, 5000 of which were sold at Gimbels department store for $5 each. Amelia’s plane carried $25,000 worth of philatelic cargo when she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared in the South Pacific in 1937.\n\nAmelia’s Other Runway\n\n2023 marks the 90th anniversary of the release of Amelia’s fashion line—Amelia Earhart Fashions—in 1933.4 Unlike the namesakes of many contemporary celebrity fashion lines, Earhart was very involved in the ideation and creation of her clothing. She intended to design women’s practical clothes for ‘active living.’\n\nAlthough this ploy was not her most lucrative, Amelia popularized trends that continue today. Her fashion line also brought the concept of women’s “separates” into vogue. Seperates allowed women to wear different tops and bottoms.\n\n“Earhart believed strongly in her aesthetic, which aimed to combine her love of fashion with her love of aviation. An article in the the New York World Telegram, dated December 29th, 1933, quotes Earhart as saying, ‘I have always believed that clothes are terribly important in every woman’s life… And I also believe that there is much of beauty in aviation — color and line that is exclusive to the air, which I have attempted to express in sports clothes.'”\n\nJen Morson.
