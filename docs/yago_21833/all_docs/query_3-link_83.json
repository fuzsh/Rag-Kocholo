She was certainly a woman ahead of her own time who lived life on ger own terms.\n\nDid she live on her own terms?\n\nMy takeaway is that marriage was something she had no interest in yet she went through with it. To me that letter is a formal statement outlining their ways out of the marriage she didn't want.\n\nAmelia Earhart\n\nAs I recall from several biographies, she never wanted to get married. She married him more as a business venture and because society “said” she should. So this letter makes it clear that while she was fond of him, there would be no surprises going into the marital agreement."
