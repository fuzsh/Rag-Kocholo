Minor marks, and a little rubbing & bumping to edges. Blind stamp to ffep. No inscriptions. A little foxing to pages.\n\nConsisting of diary entries and other notes compiled by aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart during her failed attempt that year at flying solo across the Pacific Ocean. Her husband, publisher George Palmer Putnam, edited the collection which was published posthumously as a tribute to his wife. Consisting of hand-written diary entries, Earhart's writings cover the period from March 1937 up until her final entry on July 1, the day before her plane was reported missing en route to Howland Island in the South Pacific. The work is augmented by additional material written by Putnam, as well as a poem, \"Courage\", which Earhart had herself written. 251 pages, with b&w plates.\n\nWE WILL SHIP TO AUSTRALIA, PLEASE ASK FOR A QUOTE.\n\nPlease see our other listings for more great books: New Zealand History; Maori; First Editions; Signed; War & Military; Vintage & Antique, Hunting, Climbing, and many more.
