        "text": "What does it take to be a hero? Brains, bravery, kindness, hopefulness, selflessness, perseverance, love and inspiration make up the best of heroes. But what heroes? Here’s one: George Palmer Putnam. A man who has been known for his wife, Amelia Earhart, but deserves to be known for much, much more. He has the guts, the smarts, the love and the leadership. He is a true hero.\n\nBrains. As a Harvard graduate and studier at California University, he was at the top of his game. Running the family business, G.P Putnam’s Sons, he became one of the top promoters of his time. Meeting Amelia Earhart, before her flight of fame, he started her career with a bang. He managed her public events, speaking tours and promoted careers and contracts. Lastly, he published two books on Miss Earhart just before her mysterious disappearance. His academic adventures have made him well known in history.\n\nAs true to that as he was, it did help that his wife Amelia had once said it. In the year 1926, he led an expedition to the arctic. It turned out to be successful and he led another almost exactly one year later. This second expedition to Baffin was to collect specimens for the American Geographical Society. And besides the exciting adventures he went on, there were more beautiful adventures behind the scenes. His wife had led him far and high in their love and her love of adventure. He had led several careers and became one of the top promoters of his time. That’s true courage.\n\nHe’s best known for his marriage to Amelia Earhart, who made his heart complete. Soon after his previous marriages, he met up with Amelia Earhart, and began to manage her career. This was another job George had. In 1931 their business relationship got intimate and he proposed. Unfortunately in 1939 she was declared dead after she had been missing for under a year. Her tragic story was hard to get over but he did, and got married to Mrs. Cosigny-James that same year. He shared all his love, no matter how hard things got.\n\nHero. Again those first words come to mind. He had brains. He had courage. He made an adventure. He had a big heart. He was a hero. He’s much more than just George Putnam, husband of Amelia Earhart. He was an explorer, a husband, manager and publisher. He was my hero.\n\n“George Palmer Putnam” Wikipedia.
