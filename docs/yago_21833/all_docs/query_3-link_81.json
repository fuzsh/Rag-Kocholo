        "text": "Amelia Earhart still adored in Atchison\n\nBy Dianne Zuckerman\n\nSpecial to The Denver Post\n\nATCHISON, KAN. - Standing on the bluffs of the Missouri River, the breeze freshened by the water, an open vista beckoning with promise and possibility, it's easy to see how this landscape nurtured Amelia Earhart's passion for adventure and flying.\n\nAmerica's best-known aviatrix was born here July 24, 1897, in a gracious white frame house facing the river. As a child, Earhart biked along this red-brick street and wandered the bluffs, exploring the caves that dot the area. A century later, it's possible to experience Earhart's formative years by visiting her girlhood home and other sites dedicated to Atchison's most famous resident.\n\nAtchison, which has a population of 10,700, sprang to life as a supply center for pioneers heading West. The town grew in prosperity with the founding of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in 1859.\n\nThe original Santa Fe Depot is now Atchison's Visitors Information Center. The centerpiece display is \"Amelia Earhart, the Atchison Years,\" which incorporates family photographs and memorabilia, including Earhart's World War I nurse's uniform and her wheat-colored leather flight jacket. Many of the artifacts were donated by Earhart's sister, Muriel Earhart Morrissey, now 97 and living in Massachusetts.\n\nStarting at the depot, a trolley offers a narrated tour of Atchison's museums and historic structures including Earhart's birthplace, which is owned by the NinetyNines, an international organization of female pilots Earhart helped found in 1929.\n\nThe 15-room residence was built by Earhart's maternal grandfather, Alfred Otis, for his wife, Amelia. One of their eight children, Amy, was Amelia Earhart's mother. Amy - who at 21 became the first woman to climb Pikes Peak - and her husband, Edwin, lived in Kansas City, but returned to the more comfortable Otis home for Amelia's birth.\n\nAmelia and Muriel spent school terms with their grandparents while their parents traveled in connection with Edwin's job as a lawyer for the railroad. Since Otis was a prominent man of means, Earhart had a rather charmed childhood.\n\n\"Being brought up here did have quite an influence on the type of person she was,\" said Louise Foudray, the resident caretaker and tour director who has lived in an apartment on the premises for 10 years. \"Her grandmother was a very proper lady, a Quaker from Philadelphia. Mr. Otis started a law practice here in the 1850s and then became a judge. His friends were state dignitaries.\"\n\nThe house in which Otis entertained his influential guests is light and airy with a spacious entry hall, a high-ceilinged front parlor and a formal dining room graced with stained-glass windows. The home, still undergoing renovation, is being restored as closely as possible to the style of the period.\n\n\"A lot of the things we buy are replicas of what was in the house,\" explained Foudray. \"Amelia's sister went through the house and told us what was in each room.\" The furnishings also include original pieces such as a hope chest that belonged to Earhart, who lived here until 1909.\n\nThe first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, Earhart is known for aviation feats that helped blaze the way for women in a traditionally male arena. But today, her name also is remembered for her mysterious disappearance, 60 years ago this summer, on July 2, 1937.\n\nEarhart's bid to become the first woman to fly around the world, which was accompanied by massive publicity orchestrated by her husband, George Palmer Putnam, ended when she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, went down in the Pacific Ocean short of Howland Island, her scheduled stop.\n\nSince then, theories and books have proliferated about Earhart's disappearance, which occurred at a time when the Japanese were conducting a clandestine military buildup in the area. The official U.S. government stance was that Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, crashed in the ocean.\n\nBut later eyewitness reports from natives in the area raised the possibility that Earhart and Noonan came down in the Marshall Islands and were taken prisoner by the Japanese. This led to speculation that Earhart was involved in a spy mission for the United States. Sixty years later, with private expeditions still searching for an answer, the mystery continues to fuel the Earhart legend.\n\nIn Atchison, though, the emphasis is on Earhart's life and contributions, which also are honored in the International Forest of Friendship south of Atchison. The lovely site overlooking Lake Warnock features trees from around the world and memorial plaques recognizing those who have contributed to aviation and aerospace history.\n\nEarhart, who is represented in the Forest of Friendship by a lifesize statue, also has been memorialized with the nearby Amelia Earhart Earthwork. Created by Kansas artist Stan Herd, the 1-acre profile of Earhart is composed of live plantings and natural materials. Fittingly enough, the earthwork will have its greatest impact on those who see it while flying overhead.\n\non the map\n\nAtchison is about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. From Denver take I-70 to U.S. 73. Take U.S. 73 (which becomes the Amelia Earhart Memorial Highway) north to Atchison. For information contact the Archison Area Chamber of Commerce, Historic Santa Fe Depot, 200 S. 10th st., Atchison, Kan. 66002. The definitive biography about Amelia Earhart is Mary S. Lovell's \"The Sound of Wings.\""
