        "text": "This photograph is from the Harris & Ewing collection at the Library of Congress\n\nThe Amelia Earhart story has something for everyone: mystery, invention, and perseverance headed up by a strong woman. Amelia Earhart not only created world records, but she also broke them.\n\nI’ve been fascinated by her since I was a little girl — once, I even wanted to go as Amelia Earhart for Halloween, but all the vintage aviatrix costumes must have been sold out because I went as a cat instead.\n\nA simple answer to who Amelia Earhart was is that she was an aviation trailblazer who broke many records, all people to follow their dreams, and believe in themselves even when no one else did.\n\nIn 1937, Amelia Earhart was the first woman to attempt to fly around the world with only one crew member. Unfortunately, she disappeared somewhere over the Pacific when she was a mere twenty-two thousand miles from her goal.\n\nAmelia Mary Earhart was born on July 24, 1897, in Atchison, Kansas. Amelia’s mother went against social mores of the time and encouraged her daughter’s adventurous spirit. While other girls enjoyed more dainty and refined pursuits, Amelia climbed trees, hunted rats, and played basketball."
