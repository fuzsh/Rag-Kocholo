        "meta_description": "This made-for-TV movie tells the story of famed pilot Amelia Earhart (Susan Clark), who disappeared in 1937 while attempting to circumnavigate the globe. The drama picks up the story with her first flight in a biplane at the age of 23, and follows her as she achieves many feats as one of the first female pilots. Hinting at a less-than-ideal relationship with her husband, George Putnam (John Forsythe), the film insinuates an affair between her and stunt pilot Paul Mantz (Stephen Macht).",
