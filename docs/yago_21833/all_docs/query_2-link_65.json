        "text": "The $500 given to her by The New York Times was a godsend, Amelia Earhart allowed. And the orchids sent by Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, the grande dame of The Times, were simply lovely.\n\nBut after navigating the Atlantic Ocean alone in May 1932 — to the world’s acclaim — the aviator had a bone to pick with us.\n\nBack at the home in Rye, N.Y., that she shared with her husband, the book publisher George Palmer Putnam, Ms. Earhart dispatched a letter to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times:\n\n“Despite the mild expression of my wishes, and those of G.P.P., I am constantly referred to as ‘Mrs. Putnam’ when the Times mentions me in its columns.”\n\n“I admit I have no principle to uphold in asking that I be called by my professional name in print. However, it is for many reasons more convenient for both of us to be simply ‘Amelia Earhart.’ After all (here may be a principle) I believe flyers should be permitted the same privileges as writers or actresses.”\n\nMs. Earhart had been “Miss Earhart” when she crossed the Atlantic in 1928 as a passenger — the first woman to make a transoceanic journey by air. Her personal account of that thrilling adventure was cabled exclusively to The New York Times from Burry Port in Wales.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
