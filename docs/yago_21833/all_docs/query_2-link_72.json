        "text": "Amelia was 10 when she first encountered an airplane at a state fair. Dismissing it as a “thing of rusty wire and wood” and not looking “at all interesting,\" her opinion would significantly change a decade later.\n\nAmelia lived in several cities, including Chicago, where she attended Hyde Park High School. Amelia had always shown an aptitude for science and sports in school, but her parents’ rocky relationship and absentee father instilled an independence in Amelia, and a resistance to others “taking care” of her. A visit to her sister Muriel in Toronto during World War I first exposed Amelia to wounded soldiers – many of whom were pilots – and she became a volunteer nurse’s aide for the Red Cross. Amelia began medical studies at Columbia University, but relocated to California to support her parents. It was there she became seriously interested in aviation, and realized her destiny during her first plane ride in 1920: \"By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew I had to fly.\"\n\nAmelia took her first flying lesson in 1921 and six months later, with financial assistance from her mother and sister, bought her first plane: a second-hand, bright yellow, two-seater Kinner Airster she christened \"The Canary.\" In the following year, Amelia set her first women's flying record in that plane, when she rose to an altitude of 14,000 feet. Less than seven months later, Amelia became the 16th woman issued a pilot's license by the world governing body for aeronautics. Limited finances later forced Amelia to sell her beloved plane."
