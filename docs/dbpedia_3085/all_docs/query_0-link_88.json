        "text": "Red alert! The long-awaited re-release of Taylor Swift's 2012 album Red is finally here. After a very public battle to retain ownership of her masters, the beloved singer dropped Taylor's Version of the highly acclaimed album on Friday, November 12. One unexpected surprise on the project was a 10-minute extended version of \"All Too Well.\" The single, rumored to be inspired by Taylor's 2010 breakup with actor Jake Gyllenhaall, is considered one of the best songs she's ever written.\n\nThe extended version follows Taylor as she delves deeper into the love story that left her feeling like a \"crumpled up piece of paper.\" While Taylor never officially confirmed if \"All Too Well\" was about Jake, the song does allude to age being a factor in her split and the joy of supposedly turning 21. In case you missed it, Jake and Taylor, who have a 9-year age gap, dated from October to December 2010 and broke up right before her 21st birthday.\n\nIf you're interested to see the additions she made to the song, keep reading. Here's a lyric breakdown of Taylor Swift's \"All Too Well.\"\n\nLyrics provided by Genius.\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\n\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\n\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\n\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\n\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\n\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\n\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nThe song opens with Taylor reflecting on how her love story began.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\n\nThat magic's not here no more\n\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\n\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\n\nWind in my hair, I was there\n\nI remember it all too well\n\nThe pre-chorus and chorus follow Taylor as she goes through various emotions. She starts off acknowledging the disconnect with her lover, then reflects on a precious moment they shared.\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\n\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\n\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\n\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\n\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"fuck the patriarchy\"\n\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\n\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\n\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\n\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\n\nAfter three months in the grave\n\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\n\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nTaylor uses this verse to share deets about her experiences with her ex's family and the fun things they used to do together. She accuses her former partner of being unwilling to admit they were in love and reveals that her ex came back after their split, but it was too late.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\n\nThere was nothing else I could do\n\nAnd I forget about you long enough\n\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\n\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\n\nDown the stairs, I was there\n\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\n\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\n\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\n\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nTaylor uses this chorus to share more personal moments and reveals the pain she remembers after feeling like she was a secret.\n\n[Bridge]\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\n\nMaybe I asked for too much\n\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n\n'Til you tore it all up\n\nRunning scared, I was there\n\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\n\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\n\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nTaylor calls out possible things that could've led to their split and how ending their relationship made her feel.\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\n\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\n\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\n\nAnd that made me want to die\n\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\n\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\n\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\n\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\n\nThat's what happened, you\n\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\n\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\n\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\n\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nIn the third verse, Taylor reveals that her ex broke up with her because of an age gap when she should've been having fun for her 21st birthday.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\n\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\n\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\n\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\n\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\n\nYou can't get rid of it\n\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\n\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\n\nTaylor looks back on her life after the split and shares how she craves a sense of normalcy.\n\n[Verse 4]\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\nI'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\n\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\n\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\n\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\n\nI still remember the first fall of snow\n\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\n\nI remember it all too well\n\nThings get a little spicy in the fourth verse. Taylor uses an old saying to joke about her much older ex continuing to date women her age after their breakup.\n\n[Outro]\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\n\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\n\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\n\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\n\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\n\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n\nIt was rare, you remember it\n\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\n\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n\nIt was rare, you remember it\n\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\n\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n\nIt was rare, you remember it"
