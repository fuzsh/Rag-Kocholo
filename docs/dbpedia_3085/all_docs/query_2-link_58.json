        "text": "Start application online\n\nUse our online document guide to facilitate your DMV visit!\n\nWhat Is a REAL ID?\n\nA REAL ID is an optional, upgraded version of your driver’s license or ID card that has a star in the right corner.\n\nBeginning May 7, 2025, the federal government will require you to present a REAL ID compliant driver's license or ID card, or another federally approved form of ID, in order to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility or military base (some military bases may already require REAL ID or a federally approved form of ID*).\n\nSince REAL ID is optional in Virginia, you may not need one if you already have another federally accepted form of ID, like a valid U.S. passport or military ID, or don’t travel by plane. However, if you do want one, we encourage you to apply as soon as possible.\n\nStandard License vs REAL ID License\n\nApplicable UsesStandard LicenseREAL ID LicenseDriveYesYesVote or register to voteYesYesVerify your identity at banks, utility companies and retail storesYesYesApply for or receive federal benefitsYesYesAccess health or life preserving servicesYesYesEnter federal facilities requiring ID*NoYesAccess military bases*NoYesBoard domestic flights beginning May 7, 2025NoYes\n\n* Secure federal facilities and military bases have the authority to set their own identification requirements. Please verify requirements prior to your visit. Effective immediately, some military bases may no longer accept non-REAL ID compliant credentials, which display “Federal Limits Apply.”\n\nHow to Apply for a REAL ID\n\nExisting DMV customers\n\nYou can replace or renew your driver’s license or ID card with one that is REAL ID compliant.\n\nYou have two ways to do this:\n\nQUICKEST OPTION: Start the application online before visiting a customer service center or\n\nFill out a paper application at a customer service center\n\nFirst-time driver's license/ID applicants in Virginia\n\nYou can choose to make your license/ID a REAL ID when applying.\n\nYou have two options when applying:\n\nQUICKEST OPTION: Start the application online before visiting a customer service center or\n\nFill out a paper application at a customer service center\n\nPlease bring the following items to DMV:\n\nOne proof of identity.\n\nTwo proofs of Virginia residency.\n\nOne proof of legal presence.\n\nProof of your Social Security number (SSN), if you have been issued one. If you know your SSN, DMV can verify it electronically.\n\nIf your name appears differently on your proof documents: Proof of name change\n\n$10 fee, plus the cost of the driver’s license or ID card you’re applying for. See fee chart.\n\nNote: For example, a standard driver's license renewal costs $32, while a standard driver's license replacement costs $20.\n\nSee acceptable documents guide.\n\nNote: All documents must be originals and will be subject to verification. However, printouts of acceptable online residency documents can be used as proof of residency. Temporary documents and photocopies of documents will not be accepted.\n\nAre there other websites that I can use to get a REAL ID?\n\nNo. Any website claiming to pre-scan and upload your REAL ID documents from home is not affiliated with DMV. Customers should not submit any images of personal documents to such websites, as they will not be sent to DMV and could be used for fraudulent purposes.\n\nYou may fill out a REAL ID application in advance. However, this process will not ask you to scan and upload documents.\n\nREAL ID Is Optional for Virginians\n\nVirginia does not require you to get a REAL ID compliant license or ID card. If you stick with a standard license or ID, it will display \"Federal Limits Apply\" the next time you renew.\n\nBeginning May 7, 2025, if you do not get a REAL ID, you must have an alternate form of federally accepted identification (valid U. S. passport, U.S. Department of Defense ID, Transportation Worker Identification Credential, etc.) to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility or military base.\n\nSee the Transportation Security Administration’s full list of federally accepted identification.\n\nNote: Secure federal facilities and military bases set their own identification requirements. Please verify requirements prior to your visit. Effective immediately, some military bases may no longer accept non-REAL ID compliant credentials, which display \"Federal Limits Apply.\"\n\nHave more questions?\n\nGet answers at REAL ID FAQs.\n\nWant this info in pamphlet form?"
