        "text": "Your About Us page is one of the first supporting pages you’ll likely design when building your website, regardless of the industry you’re in.\n\nIt may go by different labels—About, Story, Mission—but these types of pages serve the same key purpose: to be the page for a brand to say, “This is who we are.”\n\nWhen a visitor wants to learn more about you or your business, the About page is what they’ll look for. Learn how to craft the perfect page for your business, with About Us page examples from successful brands to inspire you.\n\nWhat is an About Us page?\n\nAn About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It’s an opportunity to tell your brand’s story, share your vision, introduce team members, and outline your history, values, and achievements. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers.\n\nIn Shopify’s customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about the brand and the people behind the products. According to one study, 59% of consumers surveyed said they would more likely purchase from a brand they trust. That number jumps to 79% of younger Gen Z consumers. Your About Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with decision making.\n\nShoppers are also interested in a company’s mission and brand values. They’ll use the About Us page to determine if they share core values with the business and to decide if they want to shop with you or not. Shared values, especially related to ethical and sustainable business practices, continue to drive consumer decision making.\n\nComponents of an About Us page\n\nIn contrast to a landing page, your About Us page should focus more on your brand identity and less on sales. Here are some components to include:\n\nYour brand story\n\nTell shoppers the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most impact, make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect with your brand. If your brand is your name or it was formed based on a personal brand, your company’s story can be one and the same with your founder story.\n\nWho you serve\n\nWhat do you offer and who is it for? Help shoppers see the value of your product or service by sharing how it solves problems or needs. This is your unique selling proposition.\n\nHow you operate\n\nIf you offer a service, explain your business model or how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out against competitors.\n\nThe face of your business\n\nFeature photos of the founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are buying from or working with. This can also include behind-the-scenes shots of your work space, studio, or retail store.\n\nPersuasive content\n\nConsider what step you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and calls to action to move them forward towards that goal. This could include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations, links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.\n\nYour About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure and design.\n\nThe following are About Us page examples of different ways you can tackle layout and design for your own page.\n\n18 About Us page examples\n\nMagic Spoon\n\nWP Standard\n\nBossy Cosmetics\n\nAllbirds\n\nBuck Mason\n\nChubbies\n\nMilk Bar\n\nWild One\n\nBOOM! by Cindy Joseph\n\nLunya\n\nWild Fork\n\n4ocean\n\nYETI\n\n40 Colori\n\nMVMT\n\nMarie Forleo\n\nCotopaxi\n\nMailchimp\n\n1. Magic Spoon\n\nWhen in doubt, start with a question. That’s exactly what Magic Spoon—a brand that creates healthy cereals for grownups—does with the introductory paragraph on its About Us page.\n\nWant to take it to the next level? Start your About page with a question that pulls on your audience’s emotions. The makers of Magic Spoon pose an effective first question that makes you think:\n\n“Remember the carefree days of childhood, when you didn’t feel guilty about eating mountains of cereal with questionable nutrition?”\n\nDon’t be afraid to use bright, fun colors on your About Us page (assuming they’re part of your brand identity) to make your brand more memorable. Where Magic Spoon really shines is its comparison chart. It gives you a clear visual of how its cereal compares to the competition.\n\nPlus, Magic Spoon’s copy is relatable to its audience. Why sound like a stiff corporate welcome packet when you don’t have to?\n\n2. WP Standard\n\nWP Standard’s About Us page is almost like a look book with a minimal amount of copy. The story is told through video, imagery, and sparse text that summons the idea of resilience, exploration, and embracing the essential.\n\nShort video clips demonstrate WP standard’s values, showing customers rather than telling. It’s a departure from copy-driven pages, but it works in the favor of WP Standard as a brand of few words, or for brands that want to say a lot by saying very little.\n\n3. Bossy Cosmetics\n\nBossy Cosmetics’ About Us page takes a more traditional approach, with plenty of text. Yet what’s worth noting is that it sets the picture of its founder front and center.\n\nThe founder is an integral part of the brand’s origin story, so making her the star of the page works. Think about including additional elements, like Bossy has, that can strengthen your About Us page, such as a welcome YouTube video and links to partner charities and certifications.\n\nWhen you craft your About page, don’t forgo creativity for the sake of being professional, especially if that isn’t a value your brand stands for. What matters is that your brand is relatable to its target audience and meets them where they’re at.\n\n4. Allbirds\n\nAllbirds’ brilliant use of elements like background videos and quippy phrases to draw in its audience’s attention already make its About Us page that much more memorable. Scroll further and you’re met with a founder's story, told in the third person.\n\nWhile this approach can work, be careful not to sound too stiff and unrelatable. To balance that, Allbirds uses simple copy and puts a face with a name by including images of its founders.\n\nConsider using animation to show instead of telling how your product comes together. Add an easy-to-skim description of how your product stands out from the rest for some additional context.\n\n5. Buck Mason\n\nBuck Mason—a menswear brand—doesn’t shy away from images to showcase the soul and origins of its California roots. It’s a great example of how you can use visuals to tell your story and create a brand identity that goes beyond the usual wall of text.\n\nOne of the best parts of Buck Mason’s About Us page? Its calls to action (CTAs): “Come have a drink” and “Stop on by.” They’re relatable and playful, and they sound like their target audience.\n\nDon’t ignore your CTA as a key part of your About Us page that can add to your brand identity. It’s an opportunity to convey what your brand is all about.\n\n6. Chubbies\n\nChubbies capitalizes on two marketing strategies that add a ton of personality to its immediately memorable menswear brand:\n\nExcellent ecommerce copywriting\n\nDynamic pictures of real people wearing its apparel\n\nThe combination works because it does a great job of being relatable to the exact audience it’s trying to reach: men who like irreverence and fun and who prioritize relaxation.\n\nAs you craft your perfect About Us page, work backward. Think of the three things your target audience values most. Then incorporate those values into your copy. Add imagery showcasing those values as a powerful illustration.\n\n7. Milk Bar\n\nWhy tell a story with words when you can show it with plenty of images and compelling behind-the-scenes footage of your production process? That’s exactly what bakery Milk Bar does as soon as you land on its colorful About Us page.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean it completely ignores the fundamental components of an About Us page that makes it effective. Note that Milk Bar also includes:\n\nA list of charities it works with\n\nWhere it’s been featured (The New York Times), for added credibility\n\nA short blurb on how it started\n\nPhotos and information about its team\n\n8. Wild One\n\nSometimes simple works best. Like Wild One—a brand dedicated to making pet products—which offers a clear and straightforward approach to what it does, who it does it for, and what problem it solves.\n\nWild One does a great job of weaving the notion of “simplicity” throughout its copy and brand images. The clean approach to design with muted colors and short text help drive the point home. Much like Wild One, a simple approach to your About page might work best for your brand.\n\n9. BOOM! by Cindy Joseph\n\nBOOM!’s straightforward approach to its About page works. Why? Because it’s designed for conversions. It clearly states who its product is designed for, what it values, and how the brand got started by solving a problem for aging women.\n\nThe biggest takeaway from BOOM!’s approach is that it sets a See Our Products CTA high on the page. It’s safe to assume this approach does a solid job of sending shoppers to its product pages.\n\nLike BOOM!, try experimenting with your CTA. There’s no hard rule that says your CTA needs to live at the bottom of your About page. Consider placing it near the top as part of your introduction. Have it stand out by ensuring your call to action is hard to miss.\n\n10. Lunya\n\nOne of the best ways to use your About Us page is to illustrate your brand’s value proposition. As a brand that sells loungewear, Lunya puts craftsmanship at the forefront of what makes it different.\n\nLunya uses a video to showcase its careful approach to detail, construction, and quality. This goes along with the “show don’t tell” strategy that can make an About Us page so powerful.\n\nAs your users scroll to the end, consider how valuable the “real estate” at the bottom of your About Us page is. Instead of creating a dead end by finishing your brand story or simply listing brand values, entice your audience to explore your products by linking to your bestsellers. Use Lunya’s approach for inspiration.\n\n11. Wild Fork\n\nWild Fork’s About Us page appeals to the senses. That’s smart considering it sells responsibly farmed meat.\n\nBeyond mouth-watering meat, Wild Fork sells peace of mind as a meat alternative for health-conscious consumers. Its About Us page does a great job of explaining how it does this by:\n\nAdding visual infographics of its meat’s farm-to-fork journey\n\nIncluding captioned video of its process\n\nFeaturing pictures of its best cuts of meat\n\nClearly stating the benefits of its product (convenience, variety, freshness)\n\nOnce you’re clear on your product offering, using a combination of different types of visuals can do a lot to drive your point home. Just like Wild Fork, don’t be afraid to mix and match visual elements to design an About Us page that captures attention and is unique to your brand.\n\n12. 4ocean\n\n4ocean’s About Us page puts its mission statement front and center. This approach can work well for a mission-driven brand that’s working toward a goal its audience can get behind. Visitors are greeted with a full-width video that tells the founders’ story and captures the mission in their own words.\n\n4ocean’s plastic crisis plan is such a key part of why it creates accessories and apparel. It divides its About Us page into separate sections that go in depth on its operations, the Osborne Reef, and its impact on the environment. Much like 4ocean, consider splitting your About Us page into specific subpages and showcase your value proposition for the biggest impact.\n\n15. YETI\n\nYETI takes storytelling to another level on its About page.\n\nThe design helps tell the founders’ story. At first glance, you get the impression of the company values through imagery, looping video, and a clear mission statement. Scroll down the page: you can see the people running the business and photos of them fishing.\n\nVisitors can click through different stories about the brand’s sponsorships. It also showcases stories about inspiring people from the outdoors scene, such as the story behind Mark Engler, a legendary fishing guide in the Colorado/New Mexico area.\n\nYETI tells its story. It also features key highlights about the brand that keeps visitors inspired and creates a good user experience. These summaries help showcase YETI’s unique qualities and earn trust with potential customers.\n\n14. 40 Colori\n\n40 Colori is a great model for About Us pages for small businesses. It provides a simple company overview, including a How We Work to give customers an inside look at operations. 40 Colori’s page speaks directly to readers, telling a coherent story that increases trust and transparency.\n\nIts summary explains who the company is, its brand values, and how it differs from other Italian menswear brands. The copywriting is clear and straightforward, which makes 40 Colori sound credible and friendly.\n\n15. MVMT\n\nThe MVMT About Us page is designed using sections that take the reader through its story.\n\nIt centers on the company’s two co-founders, who both dropped out of college, and includes photos of them to put a face to their names before getting into their product promise and finally their company philosophy.\n\nIf you are struggling with how to structure your About Us page, follow MVMT’s lead by breaking it down into four straightforward parts:\n\nOur story\n\nOur products\n\nOur mission\n\nOur socials\n\nThis can help you tell your story simply and effectively, letting readers quickly see who you are and what you do.\n\n16. Marie Forleo\n\nMarie Forleo builds connection with readers by designing her About page to look like a long-form letter. It tells her story in a personal and friendly tone before focusing on the reader with a section aptly titled “Which brings me to you.”\n\nMarie also builds trust with some serious name dropping, including photos of her with Richard Branson and Oprah. These are included alongside links to press featuring her work.\n\nFor entrepreneurs who have a personal brand tied to their business, this style of About Us page is effective. You can treat your business as one important chapter in a series of stories. Start at the beginning and end where your reader is introduced as a character in your personal story.\n\n17. Cotopaxi\n\nThe essence of a brand can be found in the feelings and meaning its name evokes. So another good place to start your story is with the “why” behind your business name.\n\nCotopaxi takes this approach, explaining the personal meaning the brand name has for its founders. It is the starting point to tell the rest of their story, through the actions they’ve taken in building the business and pursuing their cause.\n\n18. Mailchimp\n\nMailchimp’s About Us page expresses the brand’s commitment to small businesses and community. It kicks off with an overview of the founders’ story, showcasing their 20 years of experience in web design and email, building credibility and authority.\n\nThe page demonstrates its brand values by explaining Mailchimp’s company culture. Here it discusses Mailchimp’s commitment to learning and educating employees about small businesses, so that each employee it hires is a perfect addition to the team.\n\nOne element that stands out on Mailchimp’s About Us page is its section on corporate citizenship. Learn how the brand’s Give Where You Live initiative is helping non-profits in select cities.\n\nOverall, Mailchimp’s About Us is authentic, honest, and shows how it stands by its mission to support small businesses in real life and online.\n\nHow to write an About Us page, step by step\n\n1. Set the scene\n\nThe best About Us pages accomplish their goals through telling a story about a brand. Introduce the characters or setting and establish the status quo or “the way things were” for you, your target customer, or your industry.\n\n2. Introduce the problem\n\nDescribe the problem that called you (the main character) to act. Explain who it impacted and how.\n\n3. Rise to the challenge\n\nExplain how you set out to find a solution (i.e., start your business) and the obstacles you faced along the way.\n\n4. Arrive at a solution\n\nShare details of how your business is pursuing its purpose and the milestones you’ve hit. Stories are all about representing change—starting in one place and ending up in another—which is something your About Us page should also do as visitors scroll through it.\n\n5. Envision what’s next\n\nPaint a picture of the future for your company or state its mission and goals.\n\nHere are some other components you might want to add to your About Us page. These elements will not only help to flesh out your narrative, but also define your brand and communicate your company’s reason for being.\n\nYour business model\n\nFor some companies, their business model is their unique value proposition—a selling point that’s worth including on their About Us page.\n\nThis might include:\n\nHow you cut out the middleman and pass the savings on to customers\n\nWhere you source the materials for your product (e.g., manufacturing in a specific country or providing jobs to a certain community)\n\nA breakdown of the portion of your revenue that goes to a charity\n\nIf you are looking to strengthen your brand through transparency, your About Us page is a good place to do it. Take the opportunity to summarize your supply chain, how your business works, and your company’s history, relating it back to your mission.\n\nA simple way to do this is with an illustration or infographic that presents your business model in an easy to understand manner.\n\nPress mentions, testimonials, awards\n\nReviews, press mentions, or user-generated content can be featured on your About Us page to show how you impact your customers or your industry.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to integrate social proof into your About Us page. Some of the most common ways are:\n\nEmbedding Instagram galleries of customer content\n\nFeaturing the logos of publications that have covered you\n\nHighlighting a quote lifted from a customer review\n\nPress mentions, awards, and other wins are common examples of milestones that can be used to help tell the middle of your story and build trust. Here’s how cereal brand OffLimits approached this for its own About Us page:\n\nConcrete numbers\n\nNumbers give you credibility, especially if you’re illustrating a problem you’re trying to solve or the progress you’ve made as a business (e.g., number of items sold or years you’ve been in business).\n\nConsider the stats you can use on your About Us page as a way to emphasize your company mission or to quantify your impact as a business.\n\nWhether you’re introducing an industry problem or highlighting company success, tying eye-catching figures into your narrative can help communicate your message effectively.\n\nAn introduction to your team\n\nPutting a face to your brand helps to humanize it, communicate your company culture, and shine a light on the people who power your business.\n\nEven if you only feature the founders, your About Us page can be a chance to build your personal brand. It is a place to build trust with readers by sharing how your story and experience makes you and your company a good fit to serve your market.\n\nA video or gallery of photos\n\nIf you can, you should mix up the media on your About Us page to add variety in your page design.\n\nAt the very least, you can include high-quality behind-the-scenes photos that give visitors a glimpse into your business. If you’ve invested in digital marketing assets like videos or case studies, your About Us page is a good home for them as well.\n\nSocial media links and calls to action\n\nYour About Us page can also be used to funnel visitors to other web pages or online presences, whether it’s a blog post or social profile. If you’re an ecommerce brand, you’ll want to point people toward your best visual content on TikTok or Instagram. If you’re a freelancer, a link to your LinkedIn profile could help build credibility with a potential client.\n\nBe sure to incorporate any relevant CTA links into your copy and think about how you can continue the visitor’s journey by encouraging them to:\n\nFollow your social accounts\n\nOpt into your email list\n\nCheck out your products\n\nApply for a job at your company\n\nRead your blog\n\nAbout Us page templates\n\nKeep in mind that writing your actual copy in the first person (e.g., I, we) will help build a more personal connection with your target audience. Your About Us page is about you, so don’t shy away from that.\n\nHit the following points and you should have the structure for a story (not necessarily the copy you’ll use) that you can incorporate into your About Us page narrative.\n\n[FOUNDERS] started [COMPANY] because [EXPLAIN PROBLEM IN YOUR INDUSTRY].\n\nThat’s why [DESCRIBE JOURNEY TO SOLUTION].\n\nAlong the way, [SHARE MILESTONES AND WINS].\n\nWe want to be [STATE YOUR MISSION GOING FORWARD].\n\nSome other inspiring templates to check out are:\n\nEcommerce About Us page examples and templates by Oberlo\n\nAbout Us page templates by CoSchedule\n\nHowever, a story is just the start. A good About Us page doesn’t just tell the story behind a company—it shows it.\n\nMany ecommerce website builders will include an About Us page in your starter template. For example, Shopify’s Parallax theme provides an About Us page template you can copy and paste your story into.\n\nIf you’re genuinely stuck on an About page, you may be tempted to use a paid or free About page generator. The problem is, no generator can write your company’s story. About Us pages are unique to your business and should be written with consideration in mind.\n\nAnother option is to use the About Us page templates above. If you’re strapped for time or just can’t find the words, hire a copywriter. They’ll be able to interview you and your team members and write a beautiful About Us page for your business that you can use to connect with potential customers.\n\nBuilding trust with your About Us page\n\nWhen you’re starting out, it might seem like there’s not an awful lot to say on your About Us page.\n\nIf you have a point of view and know why you’re doing what you do in service of your customers, you have enough to start with. You can add the milestones you’ve crossed as you grow, improving your About Us page over time.\n\nFor those who are already well into their own story, take a look at your analytics to see if new visitors are regularly stopping by your About Us page.\n\nMaybe it’s time to review it and start treating your About Us page like the valuable online asset it’s meant to be."
