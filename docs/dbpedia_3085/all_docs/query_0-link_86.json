I'd probably only sell one\n\nIt'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose\n\nSame clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam\n\nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered\n\nOut of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter\n\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think\n\nMy name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days\n\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days\n\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out\n\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names\n\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\n\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face\n\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money\"\n\nYo\n\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names\n\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\n\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face\n\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money\"\n\nYo.\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days\n\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out\n\nWish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days\n\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out\n\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\n\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\n\nUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny\n\nWe used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money\n\nWe used to play pretend, give each other different names\n\nWe would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away\n\nUsed to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face\n\nSaying, \"Wake up, you need to make money\"\n\nYo\n\nI WISH= always followed by a past tense:\n\n- I wish I had a pet elephant\n\n- I wish you were here\n\nThis is actually an \"unreal past\" tense (or subjunctive), so for the verb \"to be\" we have to use \"were\" for all persons:\n\n- I wish I were rich\n\nBut in modern English (esp. AmE.) it is now common to use it as a normal past tense and say:\n\n- I wish I was rich\n\nCHORDS= /kɔ:*d/ Harmony. A musical combination of different notes.\n\nSANG= We were now expecting a word rhyming with NEW, but there is no rhyme, so he made his wish come true: I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang.\n\nI WAS TOLD= They told me (especial passive used when the agent or doer of the action is \"some people\", unidentified)\n\nSHRINK= Become smaller.\n\nBLURRYFACE= The album is named after a character the band created called Blurryface. According to Joseph, he \"represents all the things that I as an individual, but also everyone around, are insecure about.\" Joseph wears black paint on his hands and neck during his live shows and music videos for the album, to represent Blurryface, saying: \"Very dramatic, I know, but it helps me get into that character.\"\n\nWISH = (I) wish.\n\nTURN BACK TIME= Go back to the past.\n\nOL'= (informal) Old.\n\nMOMMA= AmE spelling /mɑmɑ/ mum, mother.\n\nSANG US TO SLPEEP= If your mum sings you to sleep, she sings a song for you to help you sleep (for example, a lullaby to babies)\n\nSTRESSED OUT= (informal) stressed, anxious, tense.\n\nHOW COME?= (informal) Why?\n\nI'M NEVER ABLE TO= I can never.\n\nI'D MAKE A CANDLE OUT OF IT= I'd make a candle with that stuff (made using the smell as material)\n\nSELL OUT= Sell it cheap (because I want to sell all of it).\n\n'CAUSE= (informal) Because.\n\nHOMEGROWN= characteristic of a place; local; originated at home.\n\nCREEK= A small stream (a little river)\n\nROAM= To move around a place with no destiny or purpose.\n\nSTUDENT LOANS= Money the bank lends you to pay for your studies and then, when you get a job, you must pay back.\n\nTREEHOUSE= A wooden house on top of a tree (usually built for playing around)\n\nUSED TO= If you used to do something, you did that often in the past as a habit, but not now anymore (a past habit which doesn't exist in the present)\n\nTO PLAY PRETEND= A game in which you pretend to be someone different (for example you pretend to be superman).\n\nWOULD= Used to (see above)\n\nA ROCKET SHIP= A spaceship which is a rocket (see picture)\n\nOUTER SPACE= Space outside our planet's atmosphere.\n\nBUNNY= (noun) silly."
