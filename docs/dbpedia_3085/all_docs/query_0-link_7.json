        "text": "A Million Thoughts About “Twenty-Five, Twenty-One”\n\nWarning: Contains spoilers for the finale of the K-Drama “Twenty-Five, Twenty-One” (will be abbreviated as 25 21 from here on).\n\n25 21 has been such a great drama. Great is actually a terrible word to describe it. There are so many better adjectives: poetic, beautiful, realistic, wholesome, poignant, endearing, heartbreaking, nostalgic. I could go on and on. I liked the initial two episodes well enough that I went back to rewatch specific scenes multiple times. How could you not with Hee-do’s loud wailing and Yi-jin’s subsequent giggling at her DIY manhwa drawings? And the raw moment of Yi-jin promising he’ll never be happy again, only to be followed by a dreamy sequence at a fountain of youth and hope for brighter days ahead even if only with Hee-do?\n\nEach episode kept getting better and better. I was hooked. I tortured myself by watching this series while it was still airing. Each weekend could not come fast enough. And I still have NO REGRETS whatsoever, because I daresay this is my favorite drama of the year. But this ending… Episode 16… I just finished watching it a few hours ago. It was one of the first things I did this morning in order to avoid seeing spoilers (since of course my Youtube algorithm is wrecked from watching 25 21 behind-the-scenes & interviews). I entered the finale knowing I could come out of it heartbroken. Am I being over-dramatic? Yes, but if you watched this show you’ll know what I mean. I’m a realist though — I was ready for it to go either way. From the very early episodes we were already given hints that Hee-do and Yi-jin do not end up together. Min-chae has a different last name, the storyline kept reiterating that their athlete-reporter professions would create conflict in the relationship, heck they even had Yi-jin congratulate Hee-do on her wedding. And again, I could accept an ending where they aren’t together, but there were many reasons to believe that the writers were trolling us and that they made it through in the end (and secretly got married??).\n\nBut alas, that ending… I don’t know what to think. I likely need to re-watch the entire last episode because I was anxiously thinking ahead and waiting for the “real” ending in the very last scenes. So I wasn’t entirely present throughout those 90 minutes. There are multiple facets to my disorientation that boil down to two primary questions:\n\nWhat happened to the Yi-jin we knew?\n\nI understand that life happens. People change. We grow up and our actions and personalities shift accordingly. But I just can’t quite reconcile Yi-jin’s character shift in the last two episodes. I thought after the tunnel graffiti scene that he would have learned to open up to Hee-do and allow her to share the burden of his problems, since she WANTS TO and has said so herself.\n\nI wish we didn’t steer the storyline over to the 9/11 events either. It makes sense that it would need to be something very compelling that could break our couple apart. But I personally feel like bringing in 9/11 is too serious and heavy for this show. Off the top of my head, a potential alternative would maybe be a storyline where a building or structure collapses in Korea, Yi-jin goes to cover it, maybe Hee-do is under the impression that he gets seriously injured, and then they have a storyline of them both addressing the importance of their careers, despite the injuries or risks associated, and whether they can accept each other’s career responsibilities?? I don’t know, I’m not a script writer. I just thought the ending was so disjointed from what my expectations were.\n\nThroughout the show, Yi-jin has made consistent character growth. He makes mistakes and he is flawed. But he continued growing and always did right by Hee-do. This is why he really disappointed me in the end. How could Yi-jin not communicate to her that he was applying for a position in New York, even if he didn’t expect to get it? I’m frustrated that he continues to take on the burden of everything and keep his emotions bottled inside. He seems miserable and I understand that his work is important, especially in the context of 9/11, but he essentially neglects Hee-do for half a year. I’m disappointed that his character seems to have taken on the characteristics of Hee-do’s mom in terms of his reporter job. My expectations were too high and I was hoping he would surpass her mom by finding a way to balance his work-life situation.\n\nMaybe I’m being too mean. Hee-do’s career makes it necessary for her to be away a lot for training and competitions too. But the way that I view it from the show is that she seems to put more effort into things: calling/texting Yi-jin, watching him on the news daily, and overall just thinking of him and checking in on his well-being. Even though this is Hee-do’s first serious relationship and she’s still young, I really feel her maturity present in these final episodes. They aren’t breaking up just because she feels lonely. But her level of investment in the relationship is not being reciprocated. In the end, I felt that Yi-jin started to become a bit selfish with prioritizing his career, even though his intentions were pure.\n\nWhy didn’t they show other characters in the present day?\n\nThe logistical reason is probably budgetary. It doesn’t make sense to hire additional actors to play their adult roles if they’ll only be on screen for a few minutes. However, I feel absolutely no sense of closure because of this. Maybe I don’t need to see who Hee-do’s husband is, but I certainly hoped she and Yi-jin remained distant friends? That their kids go to school together? SOMETHING? And I definitely want to know whether their friend group retained their bond throughout their adult lives. I just really dislike the present day scenes and I don’t think they bring much value to the drama. I was hoping the finale would wrap it up nicely so we could see what the overall picture would be in terms of the timelines but oh well… With the way it ended, I kind of wished they left the present day stuff out of the show entirely, up until the last episode when adult Hee-do could appear on screen and reflect on her youth. I kind of did like having Min-chae in there though, so we could “experience” the diaries along with her. But I felt her ballerina arc was unnecessary and I almost forgot about it until she decided to do ballet again at the end.\n\nThere are some things that don’t line up for me in this show. Adult Hee-do’s album contains the photo where she is posing by herself at the beach. It’s the photo that Yi-jin had claimed and only Yi-jin had possession of. So how did it end up with adult Hee-do after they broke up? I thought it was a clue they got married. Why did adult Hee-do name her workshop 25 21? It was a significant year in terms of her fencing profession I suppose, but I thought it would have been a nod to a prominent period of her and Yi-jin’s romantic relationship. The final lines of the drama were, “There was still one thing that we could have. That summer was ours to keep.” But that summer was when they were younger so I still don’t understand the significance unless the workshop name was just a misdirect. Also, why were Hee-do and Yi-jin looking at each other with such *emotions* in their eyes during the live TV interview? It’s been 7 years at this point. I guess I’m a clown for thinking they were in on a secret together (i.e. what I thought was a secret relationship/marriage). And during the reference of adult Hee-do’s husband being in quarantine after traveling, I thought it could have been a hint to Yi-jin’s international reporting duties.\n\nSpeaking of Yi-jin, did we ever get a reason as to why he wanted to become a reporter/anchor? I know at the time they had removed the requirement of having a college degree to join, so it was a smart choice for him to pursue this field. But I wish we could have had a few minutes dedicated to showing the viewers his thought process since it’s such a pivotal choice in his life. While we’re on the topic of careers, I kind of had higher expectations for Seung-wan. No offense to her character or to anyone in the PD/entertainment field, but I was hoping she’d become a judge or something. At the beginning of the show she told Hee-do that she was going to do something ‘big.’ And after her whole school debacle, I really hoped she’d maybe go into law or politics since her ethical values are much needed and she’s also quite popular (voted as class president twice) and would make a good leader.\n\nOverall, I’m happy and proud that Yi-jin was able to become a news anchor. He was able to help bring his family back together as promised, and he became a respected person in the reporting field. Also, Hee-do and Yu-rim’s friendship still reigns supreme. I wasn’t sure if I could root for them after how nasty Yu-rim was to her in the beginning. But their solidarity even when representing different countries truly shows that their bond is soul-deep. Hee-do was and remains a national treasure. She was so unproblematic that I unfortunately didn’t have much to say in this blog post, but I absolutely loved watching her journey from aspiring teenage fencer to national gold medalist. She was empathetic, driven, loyal, and had such a magnetism to her that you couldn’t help but fall in love with her character.\n\n25 21 was a treat to watch. And I’m so very glad that Kim Tae-ri and Nam Joo-hyuk were chosen for their roles. It’s hard to imagine anyone else playing Hee-do and Yi-jin but them. I wish I could watch this show again for the first time since it was just so good. But maybe the next time around I’ll consider their snowy kiss as the final ending and call it good from there."
