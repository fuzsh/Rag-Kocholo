        "text": "Determining the Facts\n\nReading 1: The Quest for Flight\n\nPrior to making their own attempts at flight, Wilbur and Orville Wright carefully studied the work of others. After contacting the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., in 1899, the brothers received articles published by the Smithsonian as well as other reference materials on the status of flight experiments. Although most people agreed that human flight was more of a folly than a practical possibility, a few men had made some progress in the quest.\n\nOtto Lilienthal, a German engineer, had attracted worldwide attention for making nearly 2,000 manned glider flights in the late 19th century. He studied the flight of birds and designed his glider's wings with a gentle curve to provide lifting power. His only means of controlling the gliders, however, was shifting his weight from side to side as he hung suspended between the wings. Although he was considered successful, his longest time in the air was only 15 seconds. He died in 1896 when his glider plummeted to the ground. Orville and Wilbur Wright read newspaper accounts of Lilienthal's death and began to discuss possible reasons for the fatal accident. Thus began the brothers' serious interest in the mechanics of flight.\n\nIn 1894, Octave Chanute, a civil engineer, published Progress in Flying Machines. This history of aviation was among the documents recommended to the Wright brothers by the Smithsonian. In 1896, Chanute had successfully tested a manned glider. Its biplane design would later influence the Wright brothers' work. Between 1896 and 1898 his assistants made hundreds of flights on windy sand dunes near Lake Michigan. The longest glide lasted 14 seconds. In a letter to Chanute dated May 1900, Wilbur Wright wrote: \"For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life. I have been trying to arrange my affairs in such a way that I can devote my entire time for a few months to experiment in this field.\"¹ Chanute and the Wrights soon became close friends and colleagues in the field of aviation.\n\nSamuel Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, also was a well known flight experimenter in the late 19th century. The Wright brothers studied his book, Experiments in Aerodynamics. In 1896 he flew a steam-powered model called an aerodrome. It was the first large-scale, heavier-than-air machine to fly, but it had no steering capability. Langley's success led the U.S. Government to fund his effort to develop a full-size machine capable of carrying a man. The design consisted of two pairs of curved wings, one behind the other, with a steam engine in between. In the fall of 1903, he made two highly publicized attempts to launch his full-size aerodromes from the roof of a houseboat. Both trials ended in embarrassing failures. The Wrights were aware of Langley's attempts, the second of which took place just nine days before their own successful flight.\n\nBased on what they had read, Wilbur and Orville believed that Lilienthal had been the most successful researcher and had collected the most reliable data, particularly his calculations on air pressure. Ready to attack the problem themselves, they agreed that three things were necessary for a manned machine to fly: wings to lift the machine into the air; power to propel it through the air; and a method of controlling or balancing the machine in flight rather than just hanging on for the ride. The first two had been worked out to some degree by others, but the third component proved much more difficult. Mechanisms would be required to control three kinds of motion in an aircraft: rotation of the wings from side to side (roll); up and down movement of the nose (pitch); and steering right or left (yaw). The Wright brothers' ability to recognize and scientifically solve each of these set them apart from other experimenters.\n\nBased on observing how birds steadied themselves in flight and idly twisting a bicycle inner tube box one day, Wilbur Wright came up with the idea of twisting the kite's wing tips in opposite directions to control lateral movement (roll). In the summer of 1899 the brothers built their first experimental aircraft--a biplane kite with a five-foot wingspan and a horizontal tail for stability. The kite had cords attached to each wing tip that allowed the operator to twist or warp one set upward and the other downward. Once they had proven that their revolutionary \"wing-warping\" theory worked, they built a glider large enough to carry a man. Meanwhile, they attended to their bicycle business and prepared for the 1900 spring and summer season. When business slowed down in the fall, however, the brothers were ready to travel to North Carolina's remote Outer Banks and concentrate exclusively on their experiments.\n\nQuestions for Reading 1\n\n1. Briefly describe the work of Lilienthal, Chanute, and Langley. How did each influence the Wright brothers?\n\n2. What word did Wilbur Wright use in his letter to Chanute to refer to his interest in flight? What did this indicate about his growing passion?\n\n3. What three things were required for a manned machine to fly? Which of these was the most difficult to work out?\n\n4. What are the three kinds of motion that needed to be controlled in an aircraft?\n\n5. What is wing warping? How did Wilbur Wright come up with the idea? How did the brothers first test this theory?\n\nReading 1 was compiled from Harry Combs, Kill Devil Hill: Discovering the Secret of the Wright Brothers (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1979); Tom D.

McFarland, ed., The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, vol. 1 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1953).\n\n¹ Wilbur Wright to Octave Chanute, May 13, 1900. In Marvin W. McFarland, ed., The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1953), vol. 1, 15-19.\n\nDetermining the Facts\n\nReading 2: From Gliding to Controlled Powered Flight\n\nWilbur Wright arrived in Kitty Hawk on September 13, 1900. He stayed with the family of William (Bill) Tate, the local postmaster, while he assembled the glider. When Orville arrived less then two weeks later they set up a tent near the Tate's home. The conditions that promised to be ideal for gliding were less than perfect for camping. Orville wrote to his sister in Dayton, \"When one of these 45-mile nor'easters strikes us…there is little sleep in our camp….When we crawl out of the tent to fix things outside, the sand fairly blinds us. It blows across the ground in clouds. We certainly can't complain of the place. We came down here for wind and sand, and we have got them.\"¹\n\nThe brothers had determined the dimensions of their first machine and the curvature of the wings based on Otto Lilienthal's calculations on lifting power. The assembled aircraft was a 50-pound biplane with a 17-foot wingspan. The wooden frame was covered with French sateen. A movable horizontal rudder--called an elevator--extended in front of the wings to control up and down movements (pitch). Lying facedown on the lower wing, the pilot tilted the elevator up or down with a hand control and operated the wing-warping wires with his feet. Testing the glider as a kite showed that the wing warping balanced the machine, but the elevator's response was not consistent, and the wings did not produce the expected lift.\n\nAnxious to attempt manned glides, the brothers and Bill Tate hauled the glider four miles south of Kitty Hawk to a group of tall sand dunes known as the Kill Devil Hills. They dragged it part way up the tallest hill (which the Wright brothers called Big Hill) where Wilbur got into position as the pilot. Orville and Bill Tate grabbed the wing tips and ran down the hill until the glider was in the air on its own. Wilbur made a dozen glides each lasting less than 20 seconds and covering a maximum distance of about 400 feet. Wilbur wrote, \"We were very much pleased with the general results of the trip, for setting out as we did, with almost revolutionary theories…and an entirely untried form of machine, we considered it quite a point to be able to return without having our pet theories completely knocked in the head…and our brains dashed out in the bargain.\"² The brothers left the Outer Banks on October 19, 1900, to return to Dayton. They set to work designing an improved glider that would hopefully solve the problems encountered during the first season.\n\nThe 1901 glider had a 22-foot wingspan, now covered with cotton fabric, and weighed almost 100 pounds. Instead of using a foot control, the pilot now moved the wing-warping wires by shifting his hips in a hip cradle. Not wanting to wait until fall to test the new glider, the brothers hired mechanic Charlie Taylor to take care of the bike shop. They arrived on the Outer Banks in July and established a camp at the base of the Kill Devil Hills to be closer to their launching site. They set up a tent for themselves, and built a wooden shed or hangar to store the glider. Barely settled in, they endured a week of torrential rain followed by a terrible outbreak of mosquitoes. Orville complained, \"There was no escape. Everything was fairly covered with them. They chewed us clear through our underwear and socks.\"³\n\nThey conducted up to 100 glides from July 27 to August 17, but there were several problems from the beginning. The glider's wings still did not produce enough lift, and the elevator was not always reliable. They also experienced frightening problems with the wing-warping system that caused the pilot to lose control of the glider unexpectedly. The rain returned, and they went back to Dayton with their spirits dampened. Wilbur later wrote, \"When we looked at the time and money we had expended, and considered the progress made and the distance yet to go, we considered our experiments a failure.\"4\n\nRather than give up, the brothers worked to solve the problems of the 1901 season. Convinced now that Lilienthal's lift tables were incorrect, they designed a small wind tunnel inside the cycle shop to gather their own data. After testing wing shapes inside the wood and metal tunnel, they realized that a longer, narrower wing would perform better. During the winter and spring of 1902 they built a new 120-pound glider with a 32-foot wingspan. The glider now featured a fixed, vertical rudder extending several feet to the rear, which they hoped would address the wing-warping problem by controlling yaw.\n\nArriving on the Outer Banks on August 28, 1902, Wilbur and Orville made repairs to the shed and enlarged it to provide living quarters. By October 24, the brothers had completed several hundred glides from the Kill Devil Hills. Although the glider was much improved, it still behaved unpredictably at times. To solve the problem, the brothers made the rudder movable and connected it to the wing-warping wires so that it automatically turned in the proper direction. The 1902 machine now was a great success, making glides of more than 600 feet in 26 seconds. The Wrights had at last designed and flown a machine that could be fully controlled by a pilot. In a letter to his sister, Orville excitedly exclaimed, \"We now hold all the records! …the longest distance glide, the longest time in the air, the smallest angle of descent, and the highest wind!!!\"5 The brothers left at the end of October eager to take the next step-adding an engine and propellers to create a powered flying machine.\n\nBack home in Dayton, the brothers, assisted by their bicycle shop mechanic Charlie Taylor, had to build a suitable gasoline engine themselves. The completed cast aluminum, four-cylinder engine weighed approximately 200 pounds. Designing propellers turned out to be even more difficult because nothing similar was in use. With their wind tunnel data, they decided to construct two 8 ½ foot-long propellers that turned in opposite directions. The propellers were linked to the motor, which was placed on the lower wing to the right of the pilot, by a chain-drive transmission similar to a bike. The \"Flyer,\" as they called the machine, had a wingspan of 40 feet and weighed 605 pounds.\n\nWhen they arrived back at camp on September 26, 1903, the brothers had to repair the building, which had been blown from its foundation during winter storms. They erected a second building to house the Flyer and used the original building as living quarters and workshop. By the beginning of November, the Flyer was almost put together and engine testing was underway. One test damaged the propeller shafts, which had to be sent back to Dayton for repairs.\n\nOnce the shafts were repaired and returned, they soon failed again. Continuing problems forced Orville to go to Dayton himself to make new ones. He did not return to the Outer Banks until December 11. They had already endured periods of extreme winds, rain, and bitter temperatures and were anxious to try the machine before the weather got even worse. On December 14, they attempted to launch the Flyer from the gentle lower slope of the hill because the wind was not sufficient to take off from level ground. Unfortunately, this first attempt failed when Wilbur lifted the airplane at too sharp an angle, which caused an immediate stall and damaged the elevator in the resulting hard landing.\n\nOn the morning of December 17, with temperatures near freezing and winds between 20 and 27 mph, the Wright brothers were ready to try again. Three men from the lifesaving station and two other locals arrived to help. They laid out the sections of a 60-foot wooden launching track on flat ground about 100 feet west of their camp, and Orville took his place as pilot. The airplane traveled along the launching rail on a wheeled dolly or truck, rose into the air, and landed in the sand after an unsteady, 12-second, 120-foot flight. Wilbur made the second flight which covered 175 feet in 12 seconds. Then Orville flew 200 feet in 15 seconds. At 12:00 p.m., Wilbur flew 852 feet and stayed airborne for 59 seconds at an altitude of between 8 and 12 feet before the airplane landed and sustained minor damage. The group had returned to the camp for a break when a sudden gust of wind toppled the airplane and damaged it beyond repair. The 1903 Flyer would never fly again, but it had effectively launched the age of human flight and secured the Wright brothers' place in history.\n\nQuestions for Reading 2\n\n1.

When these points had been definitely established, we at once packed our goods and returned home, knowing that the age of the flying machine had come at last.\"¹ Due to a combination of wildly inaccurate accounts and lack of understanding by most newspaper publishers, however, the true significance of December 17, 1903, escaped all but a few people.\n\nDuring the winter and spring of 1904, the Wright brothers began constructing an improved version of their airplane. Although they had made the world's first controlled powered flight they would need to make several changes before their machine could be considered a practical airplane. They continued their experiments close to home so they could remain near their bicycle shop and lengthen their flying season. Huffman Prairie, an 84-acre pasture about eight miles from their home, became their new testing ground. On October 5, 1905, after many months of frustrating trials, they flew the third version of their airplane almost 25 miles in 39 minutes. Wilbur and Orville Wright had at last invented the world's first practical flying machine.\n\nNext came the challenge of keeping others from copying their airplane design while at the same time trying to secure contracts for its sale. They tried to interest the U.S. Government and some European governments in buying the rights to their airplane, but had little luck. In order to protect the details of their invention before it was patented or sold, they did not fly for more than two years. Finally, a French company signed a contract to build and sell Wright airplanes in early 1908. The U.S. Army Signal Corps also expressed interest in the Wright Flyer, but only if it could meet specific requirements. Both contracts were contingent on successful demonstrations. Wilbur dazzled crowds in France, and Orville likewise made several stunning flights at Fort Myer, Virginia. After enduring several years of public skepticism, the Wright brothers finally achieved widespread recognition of their accomplishments.\n\nNow treated as heroes, Wilbur and Orville Wright continued to set new records in distance and duration in front of amazed crowds. By this time they had closed the bike shop to devote all of their time to aviation. In 1909 they formed the Wright Company to build and sell airplanes as well as train pilots. Unfortunately, they also spent much of their time fighting legal battles over infringements to the patent they finally had received in 1906. Then, in 1912, the unique partnership that had led to the invention of the airplane--a feat mankind dreamed about for thousands of years--ended abruptly when Wilbur died of typhoid fever at age 45.\n\nIn the 1920s, an effort began to properly acknowledge Wilbur and Orville Wright's accomplishments in aviation. A group of North Carolinians organized the Kill Devil Hills Memorial Association to recognize and help protect the site of the Wright brothers' experiments on the Outer Banks. National figures joined local efforts to create a monument honoring the Wrights, and on March 2, 1927, President Calvin Coolidge established the Kill Devil Hill Monument National Memorial.\n\nIn the intervening 25 years, remnants of the brothers' camp buildings had all but disappeared, and the Big Kill Devil Hill sand dune had shifted several hundred feet due to high winds. Two decades of shifting sands also made it difficult to locate the exact spot where the 1903 Flyer took off. Three of the four surviving witnesses to the first flight gathered at the Kill Devil Hills area and, using Orville Wright's written accounts, located the approximate site of the liftoff. On December 17, 1928, Orville Wright watched as representatives from the National Aeronautics Association placed a six-foot granite marker at the site.\n\nBefore a monument could be constructed atop Big Kill Devil Hill, it would have to be stabilized with shrubs and plantings to prevent further shifting. The government and local citizens undertook the effort, and by 1930 Big Kill Devil Hill was covered in grass and shrubs. The New York architectural firm of Rodgers and Poor won the design competition for the monument. Their design called for a 60-foot masonry shaft resting on a star-shaped platform. Stylized sculpted wings on each side would symbolize flight and motion. Work began in December 1931 and was completed, with the help of many local citizens, by the end of the following year. In 1933 administration of the site passed from the War Department to the National Park Service. Renamed Wright Brothers National Memorial in 1953, the park today includes the monument on Big Kill Devil Hill, the granite marker at the liftoff spot, four smaller granite markers designating the landing spot of each of the four flights, and reconstructed 1903 camp buildings. A visitor center and Centennial pavilion house reproductions of the 1902 glider and 1903 Flyer, as well as other exhibits.\n\nQuestions for Reading 3\n\n1. Why didn't the Wright brothers' accomplishment on December 17, 1903, receive the publicity it deserved?\n\n2. Why did the Wrights build another plane after the 1903 Flyer? Why did they decide to conduct future tests in Dayton? Where did these tests take place?\n\n3. When did they invent the first practical airplane?\n\n4. Why did the Wrights stop flying for more than two years? Why and when did they finally resume flying? What was the result?\n\n5. When did efforts begin to commemorate the brothers' work?
