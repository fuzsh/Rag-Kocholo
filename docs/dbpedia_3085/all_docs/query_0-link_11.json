        "text": "American musician and record producer\n\nTyler Robert Joseph (born December 1, 1988)[8] is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman for the musical duo Twenty One Pilots, alongside bandmate Josh Dun. Across his career he has recorded eight albums: one solo, and seven with Twenty One Pilots. He has been nominated for six Grammy Awards as a member of the duo, of which he has won one.\n\nEarly life\n\nJoseph was born in Columbus, Ohio and has two younger brothers, Zack and Jay Joseph (the latter being a musician as well), and one sister named Madison Brett. His mother, Kelly Joseph (n√©e Stryker), was a math teacher in the Olentangy school district[9] before being named Olentangy Orange High School's basketball coach in 2013.[10] His father, Christopher Anthony \"Chris\" Joseph, was born to a father of Lebanese descent and American mother [11][12] and was a coach at Worthington Christian High School from 1996 to 2005,[10] as well as being a former school principal. Joseph was homeschooled in his childhood.[13] His first real exposure to music was the Christian rap rock group DC Talk,[14] and one of Joseph's favorite bands is indie rock band The Killers.[15] American actor Jim Carrey is another influence on Joseph, on whom he has said \"helped raise me\".[16] Joseph played basketball from a very young age[13] and went on to play point guard for Worthington Christian.[17][18] In 2008, the varsity basketball team placed second in the Division IV state tournament.[9] Future Twenty One Pilots bassist Nick Thomas also played on the same team as Joseph, the pair having performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" together at one of their games.[19][20]\n\nIn 2007, Joseph began uploading short comedic skits and videos to a YouTube channel named \"slushieguys\".[21] The channel currently has over 122 thousand subscribers as of February 2024, despite not uploading any content since 2013.\n\nAfter seeing a songwriter perform at a High Street Club, he rejected an opportunity to play basketball at Otterbein University along with a scholarship to the university.[9][13] He began playing music after finding an old keyboard in his closet, a Christmas gift from his mother, and began to mimic various radio melodies.[9][22][23] From around 2007 to 2008, Joseph recorded a solo project titled No Phun Intended in his basement. It was later revealed that Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the album.[24]\n\nAmong Joseph's first performances with Twenty One Pilots, he recounts that his mother would often stand outside Ohio State University giving away tickets to his shows. \"She'd be like, 'Come see my son play music'\", Joseph says.[25]\n\nCareer\n\nBetween 2007 and 2008, before assembling the band Twenty One Pilots, Joseph recorded a variety of songs. On November 30, 2008, Joseph uploaded six of these songs to his PureVolume account, titling the release No Phun Intended.[26] The album was recorded in Joseph's senior year of high school from 2007 to 2008, in his basement.[27] The six tracks were \"Taken by Sleep\", \"Drown\", \"Tonight\", \"Save\", \"Hole in the Ground\", and \"Blasphemy\" in that order. Some of Joseph's earlier music has been reworked into Twenty One Pilots recordings. It was later revealed that aside from Joseph, bassist Nick Thomas contributed guitar to several songs. The song \"Save\" off the release, was redone and released as a free download for some time on Twenty One Pilots' official website before it was pulled.[28][29]\n\nThe project became unavailable in 2015 and PureVolume itself shut down in 2018,[30] but the No Phun Intended tracks and other songs from this period were collected by fans and assorted into compilations. On July 2, 2018, Joseph's song \"Going Down\" and an untitled demo surfaced on the Internet, years after the initial discovery of No Phun Intended.\n\nMain article: Twenty One Pilots\n\nTwenty One Pilots was formed in 2009 in Columbus, Ohio and consisted of frontman Joseph, bassist Thomas, and drummer Chris Salih; the latter two left the band in 2011.[31][32][9]\n\nOn December 29, 2009, they released their debut, self-titled album and began touring Ohio, followed by their second album, Regional at Best in 2011, which consisted only of Joseph and newly-recruited drummer Josh Dun.[33]\n\nTwenty One Pilots' third full-length album, Vessel, was released on January 8, 2013.[33][34] They also embarked on a tour in support of the album, in which they named the \"Quiet Is Violent World Tour\".[35]\n\nOn March 17, 2015, the band announced their fourth album's title, Blurryface, and unveiled its track listing and release date.[36] The band's fans crashed their website attempting to pre-order the album.[37] The album was released on May 17, 2015, two days ahead of its intended release date.[38] Joseph and drummer Josh Dun embarked on two international tours in 2015 and 2016: the Blurryface Tour and Emotional Roadshow World Tour.[39] At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, the duo won the award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[40][41][42]\n\nOn July 11, 2018, the band announced the release date of their fifth studio album, Trench, which was released on October 5, 2018. A world tour, called The Bandito Tour, began on October 16, 2018, as well. On July 25, 2018, a music video for the song \"Nico and the Niners\" was released, as a second addition to a three part music video series, regarding Tyler Joseph's fictional city, \"Dema\".[43][44][45][46][47] A 10-second snippet of the song \"My Blood\" was played at the end of a commercial for Trench during the 2018 VMAs on August 20.[48] On August 27, 2018, a Twitter user leaked the full song onto his Twitter account in low quality, after they found that it could be played on their Apple HomePod.[49] The leak was confirmed real when the band made the song available on streaming services later that day as the album's fourth single.[50] The audio was uploaded onto YouTube on the same day, which shows singer Tyler Joseph in his home studio playing the song's bass line.[51] A music video for the song was released on October 5, 2018, the day of the album's release.\n\nOn April 9, 2020, the band released a new single \"Level of Concern\".[52][53] The song's lyrics reference the anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the accompanying music video for the track filmed in Joseph and Dun's homes while they were under lockdown due to the U.S. state and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Joseph directed a portion of the song's proceeds to Crew Nation, a charity for live music crews who cannot be paid during the international quarantine.[54][55]\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Twenty One Pilots released a Christmas song, titled \"Christmas Saves the Year\", during a Twitch livestream hosted by Joseph.[56][57][58] Originally, Joseph was reluctant to write a Christmas song, although he said that he was inspired by the fact he was \"experiencing Christmas through a little girl's perspective\". The sound of the track was inspired by a musical instrument called the Mellotron.[59]\n\nThe duo's sixth studio album, Scaled and Icy, was released on May 21, 2021.[60][61][62][63]\n\nThe duo's seventh studio album, Clancy, released on May 24, 2024, nine years after the release of their breakthrough album Blurryface.[58][64] The lead single for the album, \"Overcompensate\", was released on February 29, 2024. On March 18, Joseph announced that each song on the album would have an accompanying music video, with all of them having been released alongside the album.[65]\n\nOther ventures\n\nIn 2010, Joseph was featured on the song \"Live\" by the hip hop artist and rapper Joseph Michael Langston (better known by his stage name Jocef, or sometimes as Jocef Michael), who is a friend of Joseph's from college, along with two other rappers, Juda and Alon. The song is the opening track to Jocef's debut album, In Search of: L.O.V.E.[66][67] The track was co-written by Tyler Joseph and Jocef.[68] Jocef eventually returned the favor a year later by being featured on the song \"Be Concerned\" off of Twenty One Pilots' 2011 album Regional at Best.[69]\n\nIn 2011, Joseph was performed a leading role in Five14 Church's three episode mockumentary titled \"The (moderately inspiring tale of the) Longboard Rodeo Tango\".[70][71][72] According to the mockumentary, Joseph was an intern at the church at the time.\n\nIn 2012, Joseph was featured in an internet-use awareness video titled \"What's Your Story?\" The video was produced and directed by Mark C. Eshleman, a regular collaborator for Twenty One Pilots, for Trend Micro's annual Where Are You Contest.[73][74] The room used in the video is the same room in which the original music video for \"House of Gold\" was filmed.[75]\n\nOn December 24, 2013, Christmas Eve, Joseph participated and sang \"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" at Five14 Church's Christmas with the Stars in New Albany, Ohio. The official video of the performance was uploaded to YouTube on February 14, 2014.[76] He also performed a magic segment with the church's host and emcee David McCreary for the show.[77][78]\n\nJoseph also contributed to a few tracks for Five14 Church's worship album Clear by the gospel rock band New Albany Music, led by Travis Whittaker.[79] Joseph appears on four tracks out of 13 in total. Additionally, another single was recorded, titled \"Dead Come Alive\".[80]\n\nIn December 2014, Joseph contributed backing vocals to the song \"Sickly Sweet Holidays\" by Dallon Weekes (then-bassist of Panic! at the Disco).[81][82] Joseph initially had an entire verse in the song, but it was excluded due to Joseph's label.[83]\n\nJoseph assisted in much of the production of singer Shania Twain's sixth studio album Queen of Me, and is a writer on the last song, \"The Hardest Stone\" as well.[84] On September 12, 2023, Jon Foreman posted a cover of \"Stressed Out\" on social media along with an announcement that Joseph would be covering his band Switchfoot's song \"Twenty-Four.\"[85] Joseph later described The Beautiful Letdown as one of his \"favorite albums of all time,\" something that he would listen to \"over and over again.\"[86]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2014, within regards to religion, Joseph said:\n\nI still believe in God, I still want to call myself a Christian‚Äîbecause I am a Christian. I don't know how to talk to people about it yet. And if I can't talk to other people about it yet or if I don't know exactly why I should talk to other people about it, does it really mean anything to me, then? If I don't truly have the answer, shouldn't I just be talking about that? But I have to get there first.[87]\n\nJoseph is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement.[88] He is also an ally of the LGBT+ community,[89] and is strongly against the use and practice of artificially generated artwork.[90][91]\n\nJoseph has a three-part tattoo that represents \"something that saved his life\".[92] Though it is assumed it deals with his Christian faith, Joseph has been specific about the fact that he does not want the meaning of his tattoos spread on the Internet.[93] However, he has stated a few times that he is willing to tell people one-on-one if they decide to ask him in person.[92] Both Joseph and his bandmate Josh Dun have an \"X\" tattooed on themselves to represent their dedication to their hometown fans. They received it on stage during their hometown show at the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion on April 26, 2013.[94][95] Joseph's is located on his right bicep and Dun's is located on his neck behind his right ear.[96] Joseph is a fan of the Ohio State Buckeyes.[97]\n\nIn mid-January 2015, Joseph served at former bandmate Chris Salih's wedding as an attendant,[98] alongside Twenty One Pilots producer Mark Eshleman.[99]\n\nJoseph married Jenna Black on March 28, 2015, after they got engaged on July 8, 2014.[100][101] The two have three children together; two daughters, and a son.[102][103][104]\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo\n\nNo Phun Intended (2008)\n\nTwenty One Pilots\n\nMain article: Twenty One Pilots discography\n\nTwenty One Pilots (2009)\n\nRegional at Best (2011)\n\nVessel (2013)\n\nBlurryface (2015)\n\nTrench (2018)\n\nScaled and Icy (2021)\n\nClancy (2024)\n\nWith other artists\n\nList of songs Tyler Joseph is featured on Title Year Album Vocalist Writer Producer Notes \"Dollhouse\"\n\n(Tyler Joseph and Jocef) 2009 Unreleased Yes Yes Yes This project was recorded during Joseph's brief time in college alongside classmate Joseph Michael Langston. \"Live\"\n\n(Jocef featuring Juda, Alon and Tyler J) 2010 In Search of: L.O.V.E.
