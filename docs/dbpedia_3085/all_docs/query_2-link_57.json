        "text": "Better Laws\n\nSince 1892, the ULC has provided states with non-partisan, carefully conceived uniform laws. Our work simplifies life for people who live, work, or travel in multiple states and improves local economies by facilitating interstate commerce. Each uniform act is drafted in an open and deliberative process that draws on the expertise of state-appointed commissioners, legal advisors and observers.\n\nLearn More About Us\n\nStronger States\n\nThe ULC promotes state autonomy by providing a process for state governments to collaborate on issues where uniformity of law is necessary but federal oversight is not. Uniform acts provide rules and procedures that are consistent from state to state but that also reflect the diverse experience of the states when appropriate.\n\nLearn More About Our Process\n\nLegislative Webinar Series\n\nULC Exclusive\n\nThese free one-hour webinars will address how our acts can have an impact in your state ...\n\nView All Webinars\n\nAnnual Meeting 2024\n\nUniform law commissioners from across the country convene each summer to review draft acts and approve new uniform laws. The 2024 annual meeting will be held in Boston, Massachusetts from July 19th through July 25th.\n\nDetails Here\n\nIntroduction to the ULC\n\nVideos detailing the work of the ULC.
