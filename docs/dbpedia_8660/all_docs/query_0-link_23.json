        "text": "My first experience of reading Cormac McCarthy was with ‘The Road,’ a book I picked up after hearing that the author was a Great American Novelist, not realising that I was letting myself in for several hundred pages of apocalyptic grimness. ‘The Road’ is about a father and his son walking through a sparsely populated wasteland, with a lot of unspecified terror and very little in the way of hope.\n\n‘The Road’ was published in 2006 and I remember feeling that it spoke to a very 21st century fear for the current state and future of the human race. It’s taken me more than a decade to see what further dystopian bleakness McCarthy novels might hold, but I’ve now read my second, ‘Outer Dark,’ which was written over 50 years ago and so could be expected to reflect a very different time and society.\n\n‘Outer Dark’ is set in an incoherent, sparsely populated world with lots of unspecified terror and very little in the way of hope. Like ‘The Road,’ it involves journeys and a central relationship is with a father and son, but that’s really where the similarities end. The earlier novel is not a dystopian vision of the future, but a story firmly rooted in the Southern Gothic past, complete with isolation, incest, mutilation and cannibalism. None of this is for the comparatively logical reasons of ‘The Road’ (because we all understand that complete societal breakdown following an apocalypse is likely to result in higher levels of dangerous behaviour). Instead the horror in ‘Outer Dark’ stems from the way violent and portentous things just happen with no logical sequence or consequences.\n\nThe main two characters, Culla and Rithy, are siblings and also parents to a child born and then lost in the early pages of the novel. I don’t want to give away what story there is, but the son will become an illusive figure that could lead to redemption or a final confrontation with sin. As for the tone, the book is prefaced by a description of three anonymous figures wordlessly camping, sleeping and fighting. Our first encounter with the protagonists comes with Rithy waking Culla from a nightmare involving a prophet, a mob and his own request to be blessed:\n\nThere began a restlessness and a muttering. The sun did not return. It grew cold and more black and silent and some began to cry out and some despaired but the sun did not return. Now the dreamer grew fearful. Voices were being raised against him. He was caught up in the crowd and the stink of their rags filled his nostrils. They grew seething and more mutinous and he tried to hide among them but they knew him even in that pit of hopeless dark and fell upon him with howls of outrage.\n\nA single blog post can not do justice to the weirdness, the symbolism and hypnotic terror of ‘Outer Dark.’ Its grotesque confusion reminded me of Flan O’Brien, its obsessive characters of William Faulkner and its painful exploration of religious themes of Flannery O’Connor. The novel as a whole also reminded me that there are many shades of bleakness in the world – when I next want to explore more of them, I have lots of books by Cormac McCathy waiting for me, with all the ominous patience of his laconically threatening characters."
