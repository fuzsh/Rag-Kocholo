Represented in the works of writers as varied as Carson McCullers, Flannery O’Connor, and William Faulkner to Cormac McCarthy, Cherie Priest, and Jesmyn Ward, whether categorized as a form, a style, or a genre, the Southern Gothic is bound up with the specificity of regional cultural anxieties about race, class, gender, sexuality, history, and geographic identity itself. From its most stereotypical depictions to more nuanced, complex interpretations, the Southern Gothic shapes the wider perception of regional identities in ways that invite our contemporary scholarly engagement.\n\nThe Southern Gothic area of the Popular Culture / American Culture Association in the South (PCAS/ ACAS) invites proposals for individual presentations, roundtable discussions, or full panels of 3-4 papers at the 2024 PCAS/ ACAS Annual Conference, to be held October 17 - 19, 2024 in Greenville, SC.\n\nTopics might include (but are in no way limited to):\n\nrepresentations of the Southern Gothic in film, TV, and literature\n\nadaptation(s) of Southern Gothic literature\n\nthe Southern Gothic in popular music\n\nGlobal elements of/ approaches to the Southern Gothic\n\nthe Southern Gothic in new media (games, podcasts, graphic novels, etc.)\n\nthe emergence of “Southern noir” as a subgenre\n\nrace, class, gender, and/ or sexuality in the Southern Gothic\n\nSouthern true crime as a cultural phenomenon\n\ndocumentary and the Southern Gothic\n\nSouthern Gothic tourism\n\nmonsters in the Southern Gothic: vampires, zombies, ghosts, etc.\n\nmental health narratives in the Southern Gothic\n\nspecificity—or generality—in Southern Gothic geographies\n\npedagogical approaches to/ uses of the Southern Gothic\n\nthe spectre of history in the Southern Gothic\n\nsites of intersection between the Southern Gothic and other genres/ modes\n\nPCAS/ ACAS is dedicated to working toward equity, diversity, and inclusion both within our organization and in academia at large. As such, we particularly welcome submissions by underrepresented and marginalized scholars across categories such as race, gender, sexuality, ability, and employment status (e.g., graduate students and non-tenure track or unaffiliated/ independent scholars).\n\nTo propose a presentation (of 20 minutes or less) or a roundtable discussion for the Southern Gothic Area, please send the following to Area Chair Stephanie Graves at SouthernGothicPCAS@gmail.com by June 15, 2024:\n\nName of presenter(s), institutional affiliation (if applicable), & email address for each presenter\n\nType of submission (individual paper, roundtable, or full panel)\n\nPresentation abstract (250 words or fewer)\n\nIndication if you need access to A/V (not all rooms have A/V available—if you don’t indicate the need, you may be scheduled in a room without AV)\n\nSubmission deadline is June 15, 2024; notifications of acceptance will be sent by July 1, 2024."
