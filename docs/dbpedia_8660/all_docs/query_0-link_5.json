        "text": "In his new novel Revelator, Shirley Jackson Award winner Daryl Gregory spins an addictive tale of Southern gothic-tinged horror, set alternately in 1936 and 1948 in Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains. Bootlegger Stella Wallace comes from a line of Birch women who were deemed Revelators due to their ability to communicate with Ghostdaddy, “the God in the Mountain.” But after she discovers the god’s true intentions and learns how the Revelators before her have died, Stella runs away from home, determined not to meet the same fate. Twelve years later, her grandmother, Motty, is found dead, and Stella must return to finish what she started as a child and fulfill her family’s destiny. Gregory ratchets up the tension with stunning prose, delivering a truly thrilling ride.\n\nWhen it comes to Southern gothic, it’s not the heat that gets you, it’s the humidity. It’s a genre designed to make you uncomfortable. The stories are sticky with dread and unease, and the ripe atmosphere threatens to swallow everything. Turn over a rock and you’ll find it teeming with family secrets: incest, murder, madness. Sometimes the supernatural intrudes—ghosts rise up, or the Devil himself sidles in—but the most horrific transgressions are almost always the human ones. Characters in these stories may try to ignore the past—especially America’s racist history—but it’s always encroaching, as relentless as the vines choking a decrepit plantation house.\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe laid the foundations of Southern gothic, but the posts and beams were set by mid-century writers such as William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, and Carson McCullers. Every generation of writers, though, returns to the genre and reshapes it. Here are 10 of my favorites books that do something remarkable with Southern gothic, presented in the order they were published.\n\nCorrection: This article initially misspelled John Hornor Jacobs's name."
