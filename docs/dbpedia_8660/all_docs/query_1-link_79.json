        "text": "Acknowledgements\n\n“I have no desire to speculate on the behavior of a living author who in recent years has emerged as one of the most important novelists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The best focus is the works themselves, and now that the later ones have thrust him into public view, the whole of his canon exists in reprint additions that can be found in any major bookstore.” (xi)\n\nI find this a bit overstated. There must be some desire to understand the author. “Books are made from books.” But that means that authors are made from readers. Readers have perspective and interpretation. McCarthy cannot un-know what he knows. He also cannot know what he doesn’t know. It is the best focus, yes, but not the only focus.\n\n“Judgments of this sort are always subject to reconsideration…” (xii)\n\ncould not love this more. This is how I hope to always approach scholarship\n\nChapter 1: Understanding Cormac McCarthy\n\nRhode Island to Tennessee to Texas to Santa Fe\n\nRoman catholic to university of Tennessee to the military\n\n“coming to terms with McCarthys works, requires close and dedicated attention to the intricacies of form, as well as to the complexities of language, style, and voice. Individual passages must be read, reread, and pondered, always with a playful acceptance of their ambiguity.” (4-5)\n\nAgreed. This idea extrapolates into my opinion that overly reductive criticism based on identity politics will result in shallow findings. Either McCarthy is as good as we think he is and requires deeper level of interrogation or he isn’t, and why do we even bother.\n\n” sense of community” (5)\n\nliterary influences – Melville, Dostoyevsky, and Faulkner\n\nliterary dislikes Marcel Proust Henry James (6)\n\nEliot, TS Tradition and the Individual Talent, Perspecta, 1982\n\nThree forms and movements based off of additional literary influences (7)\n\nfrontier romance\n\nphilosophically preoccupied\n\nsouthern gothic\n\n“McCarthy’s works can be understood as ‘revisionist’ frontier romances, but one must take care in defining this term. The Orchard Keeper, Child of God, Blood, Meridian, and the novels of the Border Trilogy are not overtly political; yet they are often rooted in the historical concerns of the 20th and 21st centuries.” (9)\n\nMaybe not overtly, but the political nature of McCarthy’s work is undeniable. Orchard keeper is very political, and the thread continues throughout. In fact, Frye seems to contradict his own point on the same page.\n\nFrye makes the point concerning “secular absolution” concerning John Grady, and all the pretty horses. Why is points sinners on John Grady’s own behavior and the judge it causes me to consider that perhaps this is where the odd scene with the preacher and the dumplings and the radio that broadcasts gods message to Mars may come in to play. (10)\n\nPage 11 has an excellent brief on McCarthys characterizations as a writer and list of traits attributed by academic critics that support the idea that McCarthy has a wide variety of themes in characterizations.\n\nthe occurrence of “mystery” in McCarthy’s work\n\nRegional literature associatations\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nErskine Caldwell\n\nTennessee Williams\n\nFlannery O’Connor\n\nCarson McCullers\n\nWalker Percy\n\nSouthern Gothic\n\nEllen Glasgow\n\nTennessee Williams\n\nChapter 2: The Southern Works\n\nChapter 3: Into The West Blood Meridian\n\nChapter 4: The Border Trilogy\n\nLiterary Influences\n\nFaulkner\n\nDostoyevsky\n\nMelville\n\nAPH\n\nJGC\n\npost-war American Ishmael (by Chicago Tribune journalist)\n\nWould I call John Grady a stoic?

In one version, it is a lullaby, sung by a grandmother, as she sweetly conjures the image of the “pretty horses” she hopes will imbue the child’s dreams with a sense of comfort and repose. In spite of his stoic resolve, John Grady is just this child.” (104)\n\ncritic review\n\nThe Crossing\n\n“Boyd falls in love with a Mexican girl” (118) but is this really what happens\n\nFrye ids three important figures\n\nthe priest at Huisiachepic\n\nthe blind revolutionary and his wife\n\nthe gitano, the gypsy at the wrecked airplane (119)\n\nliterary influences (119)\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper\n\nWilliam Gilmore Simms\n\nHerman Melville\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nMark Twain (although Frye notes that McCarthy would disagree)\n\nPhilosophical influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\n\n“Although characters in the novel live out, the one story and their lives are presented in such a way as to emphasize the universal nature of the single journey, they never come to a complete and intellectually coherent, understanding of details, purpose or meaning.” (124)\n\nThe Cities of the Plain\n\n“at once a western full of romance and nostalgia strengthened by a sense of moral urgency, inspired by the postwar years and the nuclear age. But it is equally a metaphysical and psychological romance, preoccupied with the complexities of consciousness and the shaping forces of fate in human destiny. In this sense, John, Grady and Billy are distinct and complementary protagonists…”(133)\n\nTitle draws from ch 19 Genesis (136)\n\n“John Grady is still the John Grady is still the mythic horseman, stubborn in his efforts to tame them, yet possessed of a mystical ability to see into them and to communicate with the ‘justice’ inherent in their ‘hearts.'” (137)\n\nEduardo “an otherworldly incarnation of evil” is this overstated (137)\n\npossible parallel to Alfonsa (143)\n\nFrye comments on the use of Spanish throughout the novel (139) I suggest that this language is another language. If you don’t know it, you won’t understand it and echoes. The ideas of this is another country you wouldn’t understand.\n\nStory of consequences (141)\n\nChapter 5: The Later Works\n\nNotes\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nIndex\n\nRelated\n\nAbout April Trepagnier\n\nApril is a fledging academic, experienced podcaster, and lover of epicurean endeavors.
