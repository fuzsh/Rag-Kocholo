        "text": "Cormac McCarthy, who died on June 13 at the age of 89, is often characterized rather narrowly as a Southern or Southern Gothic writer.\n\nMcCarthy did lean heavily on his Tennessee upbringing in his first four novels, and he set many others in the deserts of the southwestern U.S. As a writer, however, he saw himself as a part of an expansive literary community, one that stretched back to the classical and Elizabethan periods and drew on a variety of genres, cultures and influences.\n\nBill Hardwig, associate professor of English, shares his expertise on Cormac McCarthy’s writings and the legacy he leaves behind.
