        "text": "“Just remember this,” he said in a deep voice that cut neatly through the confusion. “Whatever I’ve done, you’ve let me do.”\n\nReading the glowing reviews of Joan Samson’s The Auctioneer, you would think this book is a forgotten masterpiece of horror. Various blurbs on the cover of my edition describe it as “chilling,” “powerful,” “a well-made piece of dynamite,” and “utterly shattering.” In his introduction to Valancourt Books’ 2018 reissue, Grady Hendrix calls it a “miracle” that the book has been reprinted. But if I’m being completely honest, I had something of a mixed reaction to this one.\n\nThe Auctioneer is set in the farming town of Harlowe, New Hampshire in the 1970s, where tradition rules: families tend the same land for generations, folks bathe in ponds, and electricity is a luxury. Into this pastoral setting strides Perly Dunsmore, a charismatic man of the world who suggests holding an auction to support Harlowe’s paltry police force. Soliciting donations from the townsfolk, Dunsmore’s auction goes so well that he holds another, then another, then another, week after week, month after month. Eventually the beleaguered townspeople have nothing left to give, but Dunsmore, backed by the increasingly powerful police department, is unrelenting in his demands for more. Those who resist meet with violent “accidents.” As Dunsmore’s iron grip tightens on Harlowe, it becomes apparent that his ultimate designs for the town are anything but benevolent and something must be done to be rid of him.\n\nThe book is not, in my opinion, very suspenseful. It is clear from the start that Dunsmore is behind the sinister happenings in Harlowe, and I just didn’t buy that the town sheriff would turn on people he’s known for decades in favor of a con man he’s known for a week. I also didn’t find it particularly horrifying, aside from a bloodcurdling scene depicting one of Dunsmore’s “secret auctions” (what exactly he is auctioning I will leave to readers to discover). I honestly spent most of my read in frustration, yelling at the characters to do something rather than allow themselves to be continually trampled on. The book does its best to seem plausible, and its deliberate pace works in its favor, but it never quite convinced me.\n\nI short, I did not find The Auctioneer successful as a visceral work of horror or suspense. Yet, I did find it to be frightening intellectually as I pondered its deeper meaning.\n\nThe novel’s subject matter is richly allegorical. What does Perly Dunsmore represent? Reading the book today, he seems to me to represent the dangers of fascism. Certainly he is a demagogue, and we see that under his control the law terrorizes rather than serves the people. Samson’s depiction of ordinary citizens who go along with incremental injustices until all their power is stripped away speaks to the realities of developing authoritarianism. In his afterword to the Valancourt reissue, Samson’s widower, Warren Carberg, compares Dunsmore to Donald Trump, and I confess I had the same thought while reading.\n\nThere are other equally valid interpretations, however. Perhaps the book is less about fascism and more about hive mind mentality, the idea that people will willingly give up their souls piece by piece rather than challenge conformity. I noted that the climax of the novel involves the entire town, whereas the rest of the story focuses sharply on a single family. Or maybe Dunsmore represents unbridled capitalism: in the end he is after little more than money and power, and he literally commodifies the lower classes to achieve those ends. I’ve also read the novel interpreted as a fable of modernity encroaching on tradition. As a thought experiment, The Auctioneer gives you a lot to consider.\n\nIt helps that Joan Samson is an exquisite writer. She conjures Harlowe and its inhabitants so palpably that you become convinced this must be a real place, and she has a poet’s ear for dialogue. More than once during my read I felt pangs of sadness that she did not live long enough to write more books; she died of cancer in 1976. The Auctioneer, published the same year, was her only novel.\n\nIn a piece for Tor, Grady Hendrix wrote, “If Cormac McCarthy had written [Stephen King’s] Needful Things, you’d get The Auctioneer.” As delicious as that comparison is, I was reminded less of McCarthy and more of Shirley Jackson, another writer who saw horrors in mundane small-town existence. While The Auctioneer is not my favorite of the books I have read in recent years, I’m still going to recommend it for the strength of its prose and its thematic richness. Perhaps it will work for you in the ways it did not work for me.\n\nA BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT: I am doing away with the “Next Time” feature. When I started the blog I thought it would be a fun way to build excitement for future posts, but as time went on I started feeling constrained by it. I’d rather write about books that excite me in the moment than force myself to write about whatever I arbitrarily decided months ago I would write about next. I’m now going to post entries as I finish them. I hope this change will facilitate more regular posting. See you all next time!\n\nJames Herbert once said, “I hate violence and I didn’t plan to write horror; it just poured out of me.” Reading his work, you can tell. I have yet to read anything by Herbert where he seems to delight in the ordeals he unleashes upon his characters. That sympathy, I think, is partly why his horror is so effective and why he endured as one of Britain’s most popular authors for decades. But let’s back up a moment.\n\nHerbert was born in London in 1943. He studied at the Hornsey College of Art and worked in advertising until he transitioned to writing. In keeping with this background, he designed his own book covers and publicity campaigns. His first novel, The Rats, was released in 1974 and sold out its initial print run of 100,000 copies in three weeks. From 1974 until 1988, he published a novel almost every year, slowing down only slightly in the ’90s and beyond. His final novel, Ash, was released in 2012. He died in 2013. Even today, his most famous work is still his first.\n\nThe plot of The Rats is as simple as they come: there are giant rats. They eat people. More interesting than the plot is how it is structured. The book alternates between chapters that function as short stories focusing on the rats’ victims, and a larger narrative in which those still alive come to realize the seriousness of the threat and combat it.\n\nGrady Hendrix wrote, “Read Herbert and you’re like a baby gripping a 10,000 volt cable, hands smoking, unable to tear them away even as your brain turns to cinders.” When Herbert died, Stephen King remarked, “Herbert was by no means literary, but his work had a raw urgency. His best novels, The Rats and The Fog, had the effect of Mike Tyson in his championship days: no finesse, all crude power. Those books were bestsellers because many readers (including me) were too horrified to put them down.”\n\nKing has a point. As far as prose is concerned, let’s just say it’s obvious you’re reading a debut novel. Herbert refers to the rats as “vermin” constantly, and there is an instance where he uses the word “suddenly” three times in a single paragraph. There is much talk of the rats’ “evil-looking” eyes. Some of this does come off as rather silly.\n\nThe best sections of the book, however, justify Hendrix and King’s praise. Herbert does not shy away from graphic depictions of mutilation (the novel was condemned by some reviewers as too violent upon its release), and even though the book is nearing fifty years old it still has teeth when stacked against modern works of horror where graphic violence is commonplace. I was particularly impressed by a hellish sequence in a subway tunnel, and even more so by the novel’s climax, in which our protagonist discovers the source of the giant rats in a claustrophobic basement.\n\nThe most fascinating thing about The Rats, to me, is that it depicts a London that no longer exists. Still recovering from the Blitzkrieg, we are treated to multiple descriptions of bomb-blasted ruins. Herbert describes decaying sections of town at length, speculating that the rats would not have been able to thrive if the government had simply taken care of its poorest citizens. There is more of this social commentary than you might expect; Ramsey Campbell once praised Herbert’s ability to “discuss [his] underlying themes so directly without becoming pretentious.” Of course, while London has rebuilt and restored itself over the decades, neglect of those at the bottom by those at the top continues to this day, and so the book still has resonance – the novel’s depiction of a government denying a serious threat until it becomes too big to ignore recalls the United States’ handling of the coronavirus under President Trump.\n\nOther reviewers have noted how much sex there is in the book, and that in keeping with horror tradition, sexual activity seems to mark the characters for death. I’m not sure I agree with that assessment. I never got the sense that Herbert was trying to punish his characters; instead, my feeling was that he was a writer who simply liked sex and wanted to write about it.\n\nTake Henry Guilfoyle, the rats’ first victim, a gay man who enters into a relationship with a much younger man, sinking into despair and eventual homelessness when the relationship ends. In 2021, it is easy to denounce him as a pederast and therefore deserving of death; however, it is worth remembering that homosexuality was not decriminalized in the United Kingdom until 1967, less than a decade before The Rats was published, and there was still a deep stigma associated with it. Life for gay men was complicated and secretive, and such relationships were more common than you might think. I actually felt it rather bold of Herbert to begin the book with such a sympathetic portrayal of gay life.\n\nLikewise, I did not feel judgment in Herbert’s portrayal of Mary Kelly, a devoutly religious girl who discovers a passion for sex. I think Herbert’s aim was to create conflict between sexual desire and devotion to a religion that condemns it. In both the cases of Guilfoyle and Kelly, I sensed that Herbert was attempting to create flawed, human characters we would mourn after their encounters with the titular rodents. I would also note that there is much sex between the protagonist and his girlfriend, both of whom enjoy it and both of whom survive the book.\n\nA film adaptation of The Rats, called Deadly Eyes, was released in 1985. Its use of Dachshunds in rat suits to achieve the look of the giant rodents was laughable; Herbert called the film “absolute rubbish.” A text-based video game based on the book was released the same year for Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers. Herbert wrote two sequels, Lair (1979) and Domain (1984). The trilogy was reprinted in a deluxe edition by Centipede Press in 2015. A third sequel, The City, was released as a graphic novel, illustrated by Ian Miller, in 1993.\n\nTo conclude, The Rats set a new standard for depictions of violence in the genre, and its unexpected interest in social issues is most welcome reading the book today. If the novel falls short in any areas, it is in the at times amateurish prose and thin characterizations, but I am willing to forgive linguistic slip-ups in any debut novel, and does one really read a book like The Rats for deep psychological insight? If you have an interest in horror, this is essential reading.\n\nNEXT TIME: The Auctioneer by Joan Samson!\n\nI have this friend. We’ll call him Dave, because that is his name. Dave is a sci-fi nut. An entire wall of his apartment is lined with shelves stuffed with old mass-market paperbacks. I listen to what he has to say on the subject, because he’s read so much more of it than I have. So when he slapped a book in my hand one night called Ship of Fools, by Richard Paul Russo, and told me it was “phenomenal,” I took him seriously.\n\nRusso was born in 1954. His first short story, “Firebird Suite,” appeared in Amazing Stories in 1981. His first novel, Inner Eclipse, followed in 1988. His second novel, Subterranean Gallery (1989), won the Philip K. Dick Award and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. He is best known for a trilogy of novels centering on the character of Lt. Frank Carlucci, entitled Destroying Angel (1992), Carlucci’s Edge (1995), and Carlucci’s Heart (1997). Nick Gevers wrote in a 2000 interview that Russo’s writings “are characterized by an understated intensity and an affecting compassion; their deft painterly depictions of the extreme edges of human emotion and experience are carefully observed and crafted.” Gevers’ description applies equally well to Ship of Fools, published in 2001.\n\nThe book begins aboard a massive spaceship called the Argonos. The Argonos has been floating through space for hundreds of years, so long that its original mission has been forgotten by those aboard. Earth is no longer suitable for habitation. The novel’s protagonist is Bartolomeo Aguilera, an orphan with severe physical deformities that he compensates for with a mechanical exoskeleton. Aguilera is the closest confidant of the ship’s captain, Nikos, and is distrusted by all because of it, in particular the scheming Bishop Soldano, the current head of the Church.\n\nOne day the Argonos picks up a signal originating from a planet capable of human habitation, dubbed Antioch. Captain Nikos sends a team to investigate, but a horrifying discovery compels the Argonos to flee. However, this discovery triggers another signal, leading the Argonos to perhaps the most important find in human history: an alien starship, seemingly abandoned, floating in the depths of space. What is its connection to the terror on Antioch, and what other secrets might it conceal?\n\nYou might think from the description that Ship of Fools is your standard “haunted house in space” story, something akin to a literary Event Horizon. On its surface, it is that. A good deal of the novel concerns the exploration of the alien starship, and many characters meet violent ends within. Russo’s pacing rivals the best thriller writers; I am not a very fast reader, but I finished Ship of Fools quickly.\n\nBeneath its thriller surface, however, Ship of Fools has huge concerns on its mind. This is a science-fiction novel about that most unscientific of topics: religion. Does God exist? Is there Evil in the universe? Do we have free will, or are our fates predetermined? These are hefty questions for any writer, and while I doubt this novel will make anyone discard their copy of the Summa Theologiae, it is impressive how thoughtfully Russo explores his subject within the context of the horror-thriller.\n\nThere is a beautiful scene where Aguilera and Father Veronica, one of the Argonos‘ priests, discuss God and free will. Aguilera is an atheist, and genuinely does not understand how anyone could find comfort in a God that seemingly ignores our pain and struggles. Father Veronica answers:\n\n“If He had created us in such a way that we could only do good, if we were incapable of acting badly, selfishly, causing pain or harm, then the notion of free will would be meaningless, would it not? Not only that, true free will precludes God’s intervention in our lives. There is no real free will if God intercedes to protect us or save us from the consequences of our own or other people’s actions or choices. We have to face those consequences ourselves.”\n\nIn short, Father Veronica is explaining the sacrifice God has made to allow us autonomy. I am also an atheist, but I must confess that this scene left me in tears, for the first time in my life coming close to something resembling understanding of what it might mean to have faith.\n\nI have read much criticism of the ending – that it takes too long, that it falls back on monster movie clichés, that it leaves too much unresolved. Perhaps these things are true, and yet if I were in Russo’s shoes I’m not sure I would have written it any differently. I will agree the climax drags a bit, but Russo’s writing is so brisk that in the end this hardly matters. I would also argue the ending subverts monster movie tropes by having the final confrontation between humans and aliens occur “off-screen,” as it were.\n\nThe third criticism seems more substantial, but I think it misses the point. Ship of Fools does leave much unresolved, particularly the nature of the alien starship. At the end of the book we know little more than we did at the beginning – which is to say, almost nothing. I can see how some readers might come away disappointed. However, I believe answering our questions would have undermined the novel’s themes. Is there Evil in the universe? Had Russo allowed us enough information to impose morality on the aliens, he would have answered a question that, ultimately, is unanswerable. Instead, he wisely leaves us to draw our own conclusions, and this is his approach to the other big questions of the text.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ship of Fools was published under the title Unto Leviathan. Regardless of title, this is one of the best science-fiction novels I have read, an exciting and frightening tale that never loses sight of its characters or its themes. I appreciated that the protagonist was differently abled – it felt fitting, with humans outcast in the depths of the space, that the novel should center on an outcast. I also appreciated the multi-cultural crew of the Argonos. It seems others felt similarly: Ship of Fools netted Russo his second Philip K. Dick Award.\n\nIn short, you should read this. It’s phenomenal.\n\nNEXT TIME: The Rats by James Herbert!\n\nSome time ago, I opined that there are only two essential haunted house novels: Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House, and Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves. To this list I would now add The Elementals by Michael McDowell, the most frightening novel I have read in many years. You might think that something so innocuous as sand could never be terrifying. You’d be wrong.\n\nThese days, McDowell is mostly remembered for his contributions to the Tim Burton films Beetlejuice (1988) and The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), but he was also, to quote Peter Straub, “one of the best writers of horror in this or any other country.” He was extremely prolific, writing more than a dozen novels and numerous screenplays in the 1980s alone. “I am a commercial writer and I’m proud of that,” McDowell noted in the 1985 interview book Faces of Fear. “I am writing things to be put in the bookstore next month. I think it is a mistake to try to write for the ages.”\n\nThe Elementals concerns two Alabama families bound by marriage, the Savages and the McCrays. Following the death of matriarch Marian Savage, the families retreat to their summer getaway, Beldame, a remote almost-island on the Alabama panhandle where three Victorian houses rise along the beach. One house belongs to the Savages, the second to the McCrays. The third has been abandoned for decades and is slowly being buried beneath an ever-encroaching dune of fine white sand. However, the third house is not empty. Within, a deadly force lies in wait, longing for the chance to kill.\n\nAs you may have surmised from the interview quoted above and the plot summary, this is not a novel that aims to make a grand philosophical statement. It’s a book about malevolent spirits that kill people – no more, no less. And yet, what a fantastic book it is! McDowell’s work is often described as Southern Gothic, and that is accurate; he does a fabulous job invoking the American South. The weather and other natural elements are characters of their own, and McDowell is equally adept at depicting the social realities of Southern living, with its “pervasive friendliness, its offhanded viciousness, its overwhelming lassitude.”\n\nMcDowell also has a marvelous ear for dialogue. It can be difficult to reproduce Southern dialects without the characters sounding like cartoons, but McDowell is such a skilled writer that this never happens. He writes normal sentences, then strategically substitutes certain words (such as “gone” for “going,” and “cain’t” for “can’t”) to evoke rather than mimic the regional patois.\n\nLike all good horror authors, McDowell spends a great deal of time developing his cast of characters (for the most part – more on this later). I found “Big Barbara” McCray, an alcoholic trapped in a loveless marriage to a power-hungry politician, to be quite sympathetic, but the standouts for me were Luker McCray and his daughter, India. In most literature, as in life, there is a distinct power imbalance between parents and children, but the relationship depicted here has a refreshing equality. Luker is honest and open with his daughter on all subjects, and treats her like an adult despite her age. McDowell mines great humor from contrasting the pair with their more traditional family members.\n\nMcDowell was gay, and knowing that, it was hard for me not to notice subtle hints that Luker might be queer. We get no real sense that Luker is interested in women; he is a single father, and when he goes to a bar in hopes of instigating a one-night stand, he is looking for “someone,” as opposed to a girl or woman. Later, we learn of “a friend who favored his vacations on Fire Island.” Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this, but I think such an interpretation adds an interesting layer to the text.\n\nThe spirits themselves, when they feature, are the stuff of nightmares. You won’t forget them. McDowell is careful never to reveal too much information; even at the end of the book we have no clear sense of where they came from or what their motives are. Good. The best horror recognizes that some things are all the more frightening for being unknowable.\n\nMy primary complaint against The Elementals concerns the character of Odessa, the Black housekeeper. Compared to the other characters, we spend very little time learning about her as a human being. Her primary function is to voice ominous hints of things to come and, when the time is right, relay more solid information about the third house and its history to us. She has some psychic ability and uses that ability throughout the book to aid the white characters. In short, she is a “Magical Negro” stereotype, and though McDowell does subvert this trope occasionally, he doesn’t make a point of it. For what is otherwise a superb book, this is very disappointing.\n\nLike most of McDowell’s work, The Elementals remained forgotten outside of horror circles for decades after its initial publication. It was reissued in 2014 by Valancourt Books, a publisher that specializes in neglected works of horror. Centipede Press also published a limited edition of the novel in 2020. Valancourt has reprinted many of McDowell’s other works, including The Amulet, Cold Moon Over Babylon, and Blackwater.\n\nTo wrap up, I loved this book. An authentic portrayal of Southern life married to some of the most skin-crawling horror that I can remember reading, it made me want to devour everything else McDowell has written. Seek it out.\n\nNEXT TIME: Ship of Fools by Richard Paul Russo!\n\nThis is the fifth entry in a now most-certainly-longer-than-two-week series focusing on a horror anthology edited by Patton Oswalt called Ghost Box II (buy it here). The blog will resume its standard format in May.\n\n* * *\n\nDuring the writing of Danse Macabre, his 1981 survey of the horror genre, Stephen King invited Harlan Ellison to describe himself and his work. Ellison obliged:\n\n“My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, ‘He only wrote that to shock.’ I smile and nod. Precisely.”\n\nIt’s an honest description. Ellison was known for his volatile personality; Ghost Box II editor Patton Oswalt described him as “a man-shaped explosion.” This quality carried over into his writing, which always shone with furious intelligence and refused to be pigeonholed. Perhaps no other single story shows the scope of his range like “From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet.”\n\n“From A to Z…” was written over three days in the window of the Los Angeles bookshop A Change of Hobbit for a fund-raiser. The phrase “the Chocolate Alphabet” has no literal meaning; it was simply a title that Ellison had come up with some time prior to be used for a future story. It was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in October 1976, and later included in Ellison’s 1978 short story collection Strange Wine.\n\nTo call “From A to Z…” a story does it a disservice, because it is actually twenty-six stories, one for each letter of the alphabet, ranging from just a few sentences to two or three pages in length. When I first read it, I interpreted it as a riff on Edward Gorey’s classic 1963 children’s book, The Gashlycrumb Tinies. However, doing research, I found it was actually intended as a pastiche of the work of Fredric Brown, who was known for his mastery of the “short short” form.\n\nAnd what a batch of stories! There is more raw, delirious imagination in “From A to Z…” than you will find in the entirety of some novels, and as always the quality of Ellison’s prose is unimpeachable. The tales herein span a variety of genres – horror, science-fiction, fantasy. One entry, “G Is For Golem,” is flat-out comedy: “Golems are goyim that always wanted to be Jewish. But they never suffered enough guilt.” Many of the stories end with such punchlines; I don’t think Ellison ever got enough credit for how funny he could be.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve found it difficult to write about this piece, as the stories vary so much in content and tone, and there is no common character or narrative thread to link them. The first four stories in particular I thought were quite strong, and their brevity works to their advantage. “A Is For Atlantean” relates the lost history of Atlantis; I was awed by Ellison’s descriptions of buildings made of seaweed and chilled by the final reveal. “B Is For Breathdeath,” about a flower found “virtually everywhere but the Earth” that drives the people who look at it insane, is another effective mini-nightmare. I also quite liked “D Is For Dikh,” about a man who lives deep beneath the earth and writes “unsettling” things along the walls.\n\nLater in the piece, the blatant horror of the earlier stories is toned down and Ellison ventures more deeply into fantasy and sci-fi. I particularly liked “S Is For Solifidian The Sorcerer.” In this tale, a man attends a political fundraiser where the entertainment is an honest-to-god magician, performing actual miracles for the delight of the astonished guests. At the end of the tale, Solifidian’s wife barges into the gathering and leads him away, and he goes without protest, after which Ellison muses, “to this day, I’m always amazed at the magic hold some men have over some women…and the magic hold some women have over some men.” It’s an unexpectedly thoughtful, and even poignant, reflection in a piece that until then has mostly been a master storyteller simply flexing his muscles (not that that’s a bad thing when it’s Harlan Ellison).\n\nI will not recap more of my favorites here; I would simply advise you to read it. I will say that Ellison wrote a sequel of sorts, called “From A to Z, in the Sarsaparilla Alphabet,” in 1990. The story sat unpublished for years, but eventually appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in February of 2001.\n\nI would like to take a moment to note that Ellison, who died in 2018, had a personal relationship with Mr. Oswalt. Oswalt’s introduction for Ghost Box II contains a postscript eulogizing his friend: “There’s no way I can set down, now, how I feel about his passing. I’m angry about it. I’m sad he’s gone. But I – and a lot of other creative people, I’m sure – feel like part of the secret fuel for 21st-century imaginative literature has been drained away.”\n\nAs someone who was also hit hard by Ellison’s death, I can’t help but agree. As a writer Ellison was never short of brilliant, and “From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet” is a testament to his singular genius. Oswalt’s postscript ends simply: “I miss you, Harlan.” Me, too.\n\nNEXT TIME: “Witches” by Janet Fox!\n\nThis is the fourth entry in a two-week series focusing on a horror anthology edited by Patton Oswalt called Ghost Box II (buy it here). The blog will resume its standard format in May.\n\n* * *\n\nSome stories give you all the answers. They dutifully resolve plot holes and carefully explain what motivates their characters. They are perfectly contained worlds. Some stories, though, refuse to give up their larger mysteries. You leave them pondering the implications of what you’ve just read. Tananarive Due’s “The Lake” falls into the latter category, and is stronger for it.\n\nTananarive Due was born in 1966 in Tallahassee, Florida. The daughter of civil rights activists, she developed a love for horror at a young age. In an essay for Medium, Due elaborates on a singular moment in that development:\n\n“The 1958 version of The Fly famously ends with the troubled scientist stuck in a spider’s web with his tiny fly body and human head, plaintively crying, ‘Help me! Help me!’ The spider advances, and the scientist’s voice is too thin to be heard by human ears. It’s the first time I remember being truly terrified by a film – not by the shambling monsters, but by invisibility and inconsequence. By erasure.”\n\nIt’s a telling quote – much of Due’s writing examines the erasure and other horrors faced by people of color through the lens of speculative fiction. Her first novel, The Between, appeared in 1995. My Soul To Keep, the inaugural novel in her excellent African Immortals series, debuted in 1997. Due currently teaches Black Horror and Afrofuturism at UCLA, and served as executive producer on the 2019 documentary Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror (currently available on Shudder).\n\n“The Lake” first appeared in a 2011 anthology called The Monster’s Corner, edited by Christopher Golden. It can also be found in Due’s 2015 short story collection Ghost Summer. The tale follows Abbie LeFleur, a teacher from Boston who takes a job in Gracetown, Florida. She wants a fresh start after a messy divorce, and sees an opportunity here for liberation. She buys a house along the shores of a lake. She’s not typically one for swimming, but she finds the waters therapeutic. She doesn’t know, however, that she’s not supposed to go swimming in the Gracetown lakes in summer. How could she know that her body is about to change, and how could she anticipate that these changes will bring with them dangerous new appetites?\n\nAs you may have surmised from my introduction, the larger mysteries of “The Lake” are what make this a truly potent story for me. What exactly is going on in Gracetown? Everyone seems to know the urban legends – you don’t go swimming in natural lakes in Gracetown in the summer. Especially if you’re a child. If you do take the risk, you wear clothes so your body is minimally exposed. But exposed to what? The hidden history of Gracetown, only hinted at by Due, is intriguing.\n\nThere are more human – and ultimately more chilling – mysterious to consider, however. Early on, Abbie recruits a boy in her class to help repair her new house. He is sixteen, handsome and well-built, confident. The way Abbie responds to these qualities is utterly unnerving, and more than slightly predatory. She knows there would be a scandal if she invited a boy to her house, and swears him to secrecy. We get the sense – though not the confirmation – that she has invited boys to her house before. Was this a contributing factor to her divorce? Are we witnessing a sexual predator select her next target?\n\nIn light of these questions, one wonders if we are meant to take the events of “The Lake” literally. There is a moment where Due refers to the story’s climax as a “scandal,” a seemingly odd choice of word given what we are told occurs. Have we been watching Abbie literally transform into a monster, or has she been one all along, finally able to embrace her true nature in her new home?\n\nAs I was reading the story, I found myself with a complaint. Abbie seems much too calm about the frankly alarming changes her body undergoes. You would expect a person to panic – especially if their dreams are undergoing equally strange changes, and they wake up in bed morning after morning wet as if after a swim. That Abbie does not panic, or experiences fear of any kind, really, struck me as the one weak point of the story. Of course, if we’re reading an extended metaphor, then there would be no need for such panic. At the thought, my complaint vanished.\n\nAll in all, Ghost Box II started off strong and just keeps getting stronger. Due’s writing is careful and precise, her characterizations natural and assured. I found this a most excellent story, and an easy recommendation.\n\nNEXT TIME: “From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet” by Harlan Ellison!\n\nThis is the third entry in a two-week series focusing on a horror anthology edited by Patton Oswalt called Ghost Box II (buy it here). The blog will resume its standard format in May.\n\n* * *\n\nRobert Hugh Benson was born in 1871, son of E. W. Benson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his wife Mary. He was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1895, but after his father’s sudden death in 1896 he visited the Middle East, where he began to consider the teachings of Catholicism. By 1903 he was an ordained minister in the Catholic Church; by 1911 he was Chamberlain to Pope Pius X. He died in 1914 at the age of 42.\n\nHe was also a prolific author. He wrote many religious works, of course, but he also penned historical fiction, horror, science-fiction, plays, and children’s stories. His 1907 novel Lord of the World is regarded as one of the first modern dystopian novels. “The Watcher” first appeared in his 1903 novel The Light Invisible. Written before his conversion to Catholicism, the book is a collection of short stories linked by a framing device – in this case, an elderly priest telling tales of his life to a young man. The novel was described by Benson biographer Joseph Pierce as “a confession of faith amidst the confusion of doubt.”\n\n“The Watcher” relates an episode in the life of the priest as a teenager. Gifted with a firearm, he quickly grows tired of target practice and decides, knowing full well that it is wrong, that he wants to kill something. He decides to hunt a rabbit, justifying his decision with the excuse that he is hunting food rather than killing for sport. However, he quickly finds he does not have the skill necessary to hunt rabbits.\n\nAngry and frustrated, he instead shoots a thrush – not for food, but simply because it is convenient. As he retrieves the body of the bird, he notices a face watching from a nearby bush. The face does not appear to be human, nor does it appear to notice him. It does, however, appear utterly delighted that an innocent creature has just been murdered. Our narrator is horrified, destroying his gun and giving the bird a proper burial.\n\nIn my previous entry, I described Louisa Baldwin’s “How He Left the Hotel” as a campfire story. Gertrude Atherton’s “The Striding Place” aims higher, but ultimately I would describe it the same way. “The Watcher,” however, surpasses both, because it is a story in which fear is generated from within rather than an external force. The face in the bush is unnerving, but what I found most frightening here was Benson’s descriptions of the narrator craving violence and destruction, and of these impulses wrestling with his inner kindness. What human has not struggled so? What human has not worried that, under the right circumstances, they might succumb to their inner darkness? I have struggled so. I have worried so. I recognized myself in the narrator, and this is what frightened me.\n\nBeing aware of the larger theme – faith amidst doubt – is helpful in understanding “The Watcher.” What we are reading here is the story of a man who is subtly guided into renouncing violence by higher forces. Is the face in the bush that of Satan? Benson refuses to say, but given the religious context of the story, I’d wager that’s surely the case. God Himself neglects to make an appearance, but as the story winds to its conclusion we get the distinct sense that He engineered events to play out this way.\n\nApart from its thematic depth, “The Watcher” is also the most beautifully written of the three stories I have read in Ghost Box II thus far. Benson’s description of turning eighteen is memorable (“when blood and fire and death and loud noises seem the only things of interest, and all tender things shrink back and hide from the dreadful noonday of manhood”), but I was most impressed by his description of the thrush and the line that follows, one of the most chilling juxtapositions of light and dark in the story:\n\n“I looked up idly and caught sight of him as the leaves of the beech parted in the breeze, his head lifted and his whole body vibrating with the joy of life and music. As some one has said, his body was one beating heart. The last radiance of the sun over the hill reached him and bathed him in golden warmth. Then the leaves closed again as the breeze dropped but still his song rang out.\n\nThen there came on me a blinding desire to kill him.”\n\nI have read this story several times now and that line has never failed to make me shudder.\n\nIf I had one complaint – and it is a minor one – it is that the story suffers on occasion from being separated from its larger context. The story begins, “On the following day we went out,” and I could not help but think, “Following from what?” There are also a couple small references to a story that precedes “The Watcher,” which sows further confusion. Ultimately the story is not derailed by this, but I couldn’t help but think that Benson might have written parts of it differently were it not part of a larger novel.\n\n“The Watcher” has been reprinted many times, including in the anthologies The Mammoth Book of Victorian and Edwardian Ghost Stories, Ghosts In The House, and The Temple of Death: The Ghost Stories of A. C. & R. H. Benson. To fully appreciate it within its proper context, however, I might advise seeking out a copy of The Light Invisible, which has been reprinted as recently as this year by the Echo Library.\n\nTo wrap up, this has been my favorite story in Ghost Box II so far. If you find yourself with the opportunity to read it, do so.\n\nNEXT TIME: “The Lake” by Tananarive Due!\n\nThis is the second entry in a two-week series focusing on a horror anthology edited by Patton Oswalt called Ghost Box II (buy it here). The blog will resume its standard format in May.\n\n* * *\n\nLouisa Baldwin was born in 1845, one of four daughters to a Wesleyan Methodist minister. She married the industrialist Alfred Baldwin in 1866 in a double wedding with her sister Agnes, and much of her fiction was published under the name of “Mrs. Alfred Baldwin.” She was the mother of Stanley Baldwin, who served as Prime Minister of England on three separate occasions (her sister Alice was the mother of Rudyard Kipling, author of The Jungle Book). “How He Left the Hotel” was written in 1894 and included in her 1895 collection The Shadow On The Blind & Other Ghost Stories (read it here).\n\nThe story follows an army veteran who takes a job running the lift in a hotel. It’s an easy job and it pays well. Our narrator has a keen eye for faces and quickly learns the habits and schedules of the people staying there. One night, a man steps onto the elevator at a time that is completely out of character. The narrator is puzzled, but does his job and takes him down to the ground floor…only to learn a horrifying truth minutes later.\n\n“How He Left the Hotel” is a lean and effective ghost story. Baldwin wastes no time with superfluous characters or unnecessary detail. She sets the scene, tells her tale, and bows out within the span of a few pages. This is the sort of story you would tell around a campfire to elicit pleasantly thrilling goosebumps. If the final twist seems routine in retrospect, what sets the tale apart is its execution.\n\n“How He Left the Hotel” is an excellent example of how voice informs character. Dialect is a tricky thing for first-person narration, but when done effectively it teaches you something about the person telling the story. Louisa Baldwin does it effectively. Consider this early paragraph, in which our narrator describes the elevator in the hotel in which he works:\n\n“Ours was a hydraulic lift. None o’ them rickety things swung up like a poll-parrot’s cage in a well staircase, that I shouldn’t care to trust my neck to. It ran as smooth as oil, a child might have worked it, and safe as standing on the ground. Instead of being stuck full of advertisements like a’ omnibus, we’d mirrors in it, and the ladies would look at themselves, and pat their hair, and set their mouths when I was taking ’em downstairs dressed of an evening. It was a little sitting room with red velvet cushions to sit down on, and you’d nothing to do but get into it, and it ‘ud float you up, or float you down, as light as a bird.\n\nNote the numerous little contractions – “o'” and “’em” and “‘ud” and the like. We know from this manner of speaking that our narrator is not a member of the so-called “upper classes.” He is a regular, commonplace sort of man. This style of speaking lends the story an everyday authenticity that more mannered language would not – and is sometimes quite funny, as when the narrator wonders “why the Americans, that can speak English when they choose, and are always finding out ways o’ doing things quicker than other folks, should waste time and breath calling a lift an ‘elevator’.”\n\nFollowing its initial publication in 1895, “How He Left the Hotel” was not reprinted again for nearly a hundred years. Since 1990, however, it has appeared in several anthologies, such as The Mammoth Book of Ghost Stories, The World’s Greatest Ghost Stories, and The Wimbourne Book of Victorian Ghost Stories, Vol. 1. It’s not the most inventive ghost story I’ve ever read, but it does its job admirably. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of Victorian horror.\n\nNEXT TIME: “The Watcher” by Robert Hugh Benson!"
