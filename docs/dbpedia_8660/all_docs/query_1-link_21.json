        "meta_description": "“But lo the thing’s inside and can you guess his shape?” In the introduction to Suttree, the narrator warns the reader of the terrible events to come and indicates that the “thing’s” place is inward. The question of its shape and its representation pervades Cormac McCarthy’s works. This paper explores the signifying resurgence of apparently “empty” signifiers and their correlative signified in Cormac McCarthy’s first five novels and later works such as No Country for Old Men and The Road. The impossibility of the semiotic representation of this “creature”, combined with the author’s famed excess of signified surrounding and describing it, as well as its autotextual construction, reveal McCarthy’s most interesting and undervalued creation. It appears to function through the construction of doubles who reveal the shape of the monsters within the main characters, beginning with Kenneth Rattner and Marion Sylder and climaxing with Moss and Chigurh. The darker double always then acts as a revealer of an extreme vision of what is possible, of the worst in man. McCarthy establishes a form of dialogue between words and their meanings, toying with it, distorting and reversing it. I will show how the “creature” is its agent and represents the author’s poetics and encompasses the narrative strategies that make McCarthy’s novels such striking and unforgettable works.",

        "text": "3This analysis reveals two parallel movements, themselves carrying their own dialectics of doubling. McCarthy uses sets of characters that can be described as doubles, doppelgangers that act as mirrors of each other, each demonstrating what first appears as opposite ethe. This movement is accompanied by another one which discusses the signifiers and referents used to define the double carrying the ethos of destruction and the paroxysm of horror in human behavior. The more horrific the nature of this double, this ‘creature’, the more problematic its semiotic representation appears. The creature represents the author’s poetics and encompasses the narrative strategies that make McCarthy’s novels such striking and unforgettable works.\n\nWeaving the creature\n\n5To this day, critics have attempted to analyze this ‘thing unknown’ and have associated it to death, the consciousness of death and the fear felt for instance by Suttree as a character. Robert L. Jarrett brought together some of these different approaches:\n\n8 Robert L. Jarrett, “Chapter Three: Postmodern Outcasts and Alienation: Child of God and Suttree”, C (...)\n\n[Suttree’s] consciousness of death produces in Suttree what [Vereen] Bell in an earlier essay had termed an existential, “ambiguous nihilism” and John Lewis Longley, Jr., “a metaphysics of death.” Frank Shelton [finds] the novel’s center in its opposition between life and suicide […]. Young finds Suttree’s consciousness to be symptomatic of the inhibitions in Freud‘s Civilization and Its Discontents – inhibitions that enable civilization by censoring free expression of the instinctual drives, thereby also giving rise to neurosis.\n\n8Man himself seems to be an answer to the narrator’s question of the thing’s shape, and we will show how crucial this answer becomes in the author’s narratives. McCarthy’s violent being and all his previous and future violent beings are (re)introduced here. Thanks to all types of metaphorical “murengers”, man feels himself to be safe from the threatening being. McCarthy immediately shows the uselessness of these fictions: “the thing’s inside”, and points towards the inside of all men and all societies as beings. This violent being is monstrous, blood-thirsty and whittles a place for itself amongst man’s beliefs. It filters into the heart of what they have assumed is directed by God (“Is he a weaver”) while they lie dozing in a state of illusory peace. It chases them, finds them and draws them ever closer to it, as it does with Culla Holme in Outer Dark. It is then too late, if they listen it has already won, just like the crowd who listen to the judge at the beginning of Blood Meridian. The judge’s fellow travelers progressively come to feel distrust and fear. They perceive the dangerous character of the judge himself and of his discourse. Here is how he is described after he has just spoken on the repetitive and predatory nature of man and how it inevitably leads him to his ruin:\n\n12 Blood Meridian, 147.\n\nThe judge looked about him. He was sat before the fire naked save for his breeches and his hands rested palm down upon his knees. His eyes were empty slots. None among the company harbored any notion as to what this attitude implied, yet so like an icon was he in his sitting that they grew cautious and spoke with circumspection among themselves as if they would not waken something that had better been left sleeping.\n\n14 The Orchard Keeper, 24.\n\nHe came through the door and onto the porch, circumspectly, nodding across them all with difference, as if someone knew he might be there, beyond the railing itself and suspended mysteriously in the darkness, leaned against the doorframe and lifted the bottle to his mouth, his eyes shifting among them or when they looked closing or seeking again that being in the outer dark with whom he held communion, smiling a little himself, the onlooker, the stranger.\n\nThe poetics of duality\n\n12McCarthy plays with the reader as he uses images that can all too easily be identified with evil and the devil, i.e. an external tempter that must be kept at bay. Nevertheless, they also refer to the internal enemy, within one’s own consciousness and within the community, which both attracts and repulses. This form of witch hunt is also present in Child of God through the community’s behavior towards Lester Ballard and in Outer Dark with Culla Holme. In one of Suttree’s nightmares, as he is locked up, the threat of evil is reintroduced. It is more precisely here the threat of suffering, torture and death.\n\n20 Suttree, 86.\n\nBut what loomed was a flayed man with his brisket tacked open like a cooling beef and his skull peeled, blue and bulbous and palely luminescent, black grots his eyeholes and bloody mouth gaped tongueless. The traveler had seized his fingers in his jaw, but it was not alone this horror that he cried. Beyond the flayed man dimly adumbrate another figure paled, for his surgeons move about the world even as you and I.\n\n33 Blood Meridian, 81.\n\nBad blood lay between them and as they rode up under the barren mountains the white man would fall back alongside the other and take his shadow for the shade that was in it and whisper to him.\n\nThe paradoxical referential deprivation of violent doubles: naming the unnamable\n\n46 Blood Meridian, 65.\n\nThey descended the mountain, going down over the rocks with their hands outheld before them and their shadows contorted on the broken terrain like creatures seeking their own forms.\n\n20The state of contortion that their shadows endure mirrors that of their identities and their perception of their own being. Their images look as if they need to be assembled, rebuilt, made to coincide. The whole novel and to a certain extent all of McCarthy’s novels follow the evolution of characters whose sense of being needs to be reconstructed. The success or failure of this enterprise depends on the degree of independence they eventually reach. Total withdrawal associated with self-contemplation is necessary to succeed in their confrontation of the destructive being within themselves and all around them. The kid, like the reader of Suttree, is given early warning of this, at the beginning of the novel, by an old hermit.\n\nYou can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make a machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it. You believe that?\n\nI dont know.\n\n47 Ibidem, 19.\n\nBelieve that.\n\n49 Ibid., p. 281-282. Iain Bernhoft notes that “this meaning-dimmed form provokes in McCarthy critici (...)\n\nThey were both of them naked and they neared through the desert dawn like beings of a mode little more than tangential to the world at large, their figures now quick with clarity and now fugitive in the strangeness of that same light. Like things whose very portent renders them ambiguous. Like things so charged with meaning that their forms are dimmed.\n\n22In all of his narratives and more particularly in Suttree and Blood Meridian, McCarthy proposes to reflect on the meaning of the text and meaning through the text. Blood Meridian’s characters are proof of what appears as the possibility of existence in the text beyond meaning. In parallel, they show the existence of beings whose overflow of meaning dissolves the form and makes it impossible to identify. Extending the narrative device of doubling, mirrors and duality, McCarthy guides the reader, and the reader’s quest for the meaning of characters is also a quest to comprehend what the ‘thing’ is. It has no definite shape and its meaning is presented (particularly through the judge’s discourse, and it is again echoed in Chigurh’s) as unfathomable and inconceivable. Through his narratives, McCarthy shows the existence of textual beings whose content and form do not coincide. John Rothfolk writes:\n\n50 John Rothfork, “Cormac McCarthy as Pragmatist”, Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction, Winter 2 (...)\n\nMeaning and language are not two things but two sides of the same coin. Meaning is a property or attribute of language that has no specific form outside language.\n\n23If meaning and language here are two sides of a coin, McCarthy’s distortions of this coin are one of his most fascinating narrative strategies.\n\n53 Blood Meridian, 282.\n\nThe three at the well watched mutely this transit out of the breaking day and even though there was no longer any question as to what it was that approached yet none would name it.\n\n55 Blood Meridian, 300-301, emphasis added.\n\nThey eked a desperate living from that land and they knew that nothing excepting some savage pursuit could drive men to such plight and they watched each day for that thing to gather itself out of its terrible incubation in the house of the sun and muster along the edge of the eastern world and whether it be armies or plagues or pestilence or something altogether unspeakable they waited with a strange equanimity."
