        "text": "I have some mixed feelings about the work of Cormac McCarthy, the renowned author who died this past Tuesday, June 13, at the age of 89. Chief among them is his dearth of women characters in major roles; he was a novelist very focused on (white) males. Also, his depiction of violence could get to the very edge of being gratuitous.\n\nStill, there was a time about a dozen years ago when I became engrossed in his fiction â€” reading eight of his bleak novels almost consecutively and then later a ninth. Why?\n\nWell, the guy could flat-out write â€” producing prose and dialog that almost felt biblical (albeit occasionally veering into near-nonsense). That writing had southern gothic Faulkner vibes early in McCarthyâ€™s career (when his novels were mostly set in Americaâ€™s south) and terse Hemingway vibes later in McCarthyâ€™s career (when his novels were mostly set in Americaâ€™s southwest and at times Mexico). Also, McCarthyâ€™s troubled male characters were carefully crafted and interesting. As for the violence? Well, we of course live in a world that was and is carnage-filled, so the author was reflecting that.\n\nBlood Meridian (1985), considered by many to be McCarthyâ€™s masterpiece, is his most gore-filled novel â€” depicting a gang of mid-19th-century thugs roaming the Southwest to brutally murder Native Americans, Mexican Americans, and others â€” including women and children. The bookâ€™s huge, terrifying, enigmatic, pasty-pale Judge Holden character is kind of an amalgam of Captain Ahab and Moby-Dick the white whale, exemplifying the fact that McCarthyâ€™s work also features some Herman Melville influences. The powerfully lyrical writing in Blood Meridian certainly has a Melville feel at times.\n\nLess violent but still pretty harsh is McCarthyâ€™s mid-20th-century-set Border Trilogy â€” All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain. But those 1990s-published books do have some very human characters â€” most notably the young ranch hands John Grady Cole and Billy Parham â€” a reader can glom onto.\n\nMy favorite McCarthy novel is the semi-autobiographical Suttree (1979), which mixes humor and pathos as it portrays a loner with affluent-family origins drifting through life in Tennessee.\n\nWhat, you might ask, about The Road (2006) and No Country for Old Men (2005)? Certainly McCarthyâ€™s two most famous novels, with the former winning the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the latter made into an Oscar-winning movie. Both excellent, but not my favorites by the author. The Road is almost too low-key, albeit quite moving in its way as it focuses on a father and son roaming a post-apocalyptic landscape (yes, male protagonists again). No Country, featuring a psychopathic killer, is gruesome but definitely a page-turner.\n\nI have not yet read read McCarthyâ€™s final two, 2022-published novels: The Passenger and Stella Maris. (The latter actually has a female protagonist! Named Alicia Western.) And I can take or leave his first two, 1960s-published books: The Orchard Keeper and Outer Dark. It obviously can take a while for many authors to start hitting on all cylinders. In fact, McCarthy didnâ€™t have a lot of commercial success until mid-career.\n\nYour thoughts on McCarthy, if youâ€™ve read him?\n\nMy literary-trivia book is described and can be purchased here: Fascinating Facts About Famous Fiction Authors and the Greatest Novels of All Time."
