        "text": "The featured image has been taken from Goodreads. All rights reserved by the original photographer.\n\nI remember reading The Road years ago when I was in college. It was a novel, unlike anything I had ever read before. Those were the days when I read a lot of thrillers and had begun dabbling in historical fiction. So Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic novel came as a surprise – a rude awakening and an awe-inducing story that was to influence a change in not just my reading habits but also, my world-view.\n\nCormac McCarthy was born on 20 July 1933. He was born as Charles McCarthy, Jr. but he changed his name later in life to avoid getting confused with the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen’s dummy which was called Charlie McCarthy. Cormac was the nickname his Irish aunts used for him and so he chose to switch to this new name. He began attending the University of Tennessee in 1951 but dropped out two years later to join the Air Force. He read books voraciously while he was stationed in Alaska – the first time he really began reading.\n\nMcCarthy’s books are genre-defying. They get clubbed under Southern Gothic or Western or post-apocalyptic, but I believe they transcend all definitions. We meet characters who are so human that they feel unreal. McCarthy is known to depict scenes of extreme violence, not something for the queasy-hearted. Yet, in his works, I have found more reasons to feel the raw elements of human nature than most other realistic works. Suttree, a semi-autobiographical novel, was written by McCarthy over 20 years. It was based on his experiences while living in Knoxville on the Tennessee River – there is no way for you to know which parts are real and which ones imagined. But what it shows you is a character, living on the margins of society. In real life, McCarthy tended to be quite similar. He could have shot to fame earlier in his life – his works have been published since 1965 – and yet he chose to live as a recluse, devoted to his passion, but living with the bare minimum when he could have had luxuries.\n\n6 Interesting Tidbits About Cormac McCarthy\n\nBibliography\n\nAwards & Honours\n\nHave you read any works by Cormac McCarthy?
