        "text": "I’ve argued for years, including here on this blog, that despite its darkness and violence Cormac McCarthy’s work is not nihilistic. Good and evil have clear meaning in his novels, and the tiny flame of hope shines all the brighter for the omnipresence of evil—a burning tree in the desert, a horn full of glowing embers. This theme recurs especially often in his later novels.\n\nIn a review of an anthology titled Film and Faith: Modern Cinema and the Struggle to Believe posted today, Anthony Sacramone considers an essay on the Coen brothers’ adaptation of No Country for Old Men by Carson Holloway. The essay mounts a “successful effort to redeem No Country for Old Men from the charge of nihilism,” a view Sacramone himself had previously held:\n\nI, too, had dismissed No Country as another affected, self-consciously “cinematic” Coen brothers’ dead end, but Holloway’s careful reading converted me. The mistake is to see No Country as being about the bad guy. Instead, it’s about a traditional Hollywood good guy, the local sheriff, Bell (Tommy Lee Jones): “a kind of traditionalist conservative, … a lifetime lawman, a proud member of a line of lawmen.” But when this old-fashioned guy is confronted with radical evil in the person of Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who possesses not “an inordinate attachment to some real good” but a sadistic need to show everyone who crosses his path the utter worthlessness of their existence, Bell is lost.\n\nWhy? The lawman is unable to contend with Chigurh’s perverse brand of lawbreaking because he fears God has abandoned him and that “he may somehow be drawn into this evil.” In the end, Bell “quits” the fight because a “low estimate of himself arises from a vain aspiration to self-sufficiency.” When you believe you’re in a fight against the odds all by yourself, that you’ve lost God as your backup, what else is there to do but turn tail and run?\n\nA great insight, and one that I hadn’t considered before. Bell’s despair, an outgrowth of his self-sufficient isolation from God, is underlined in the film by small changes the Coen brothers made to the novel. For one, Bell’s father in the novel “was not a lawman,” though his grandfather was. The “line of lawmen” Holloway notes—three generations in the film version, with Bell and his grandfather serving as sheriffs in separate counties at the same time—is the Coens underscoring this aspect of Bell’s history. A subtle but important detail.\n\nBut having just reread No Country I thought immediately of the ambiguity of this exchange between Bell and his elderly Uncle Ellis. After a long bit of dialogue from Ellis:\n\nBell didnt answer.\n\nI always thought when I got older that God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didnt. I dont blame him. If I was him I’d have the same opinion of me that he does.\n\nYou dont know what he thinks.\n\nYes I do.\n\nHe looked at Bell.\n\nEllis continues the conversation at that point, but who exactly is saying what here? The paragraphing and lack of dialogue tags leave it unclear. I’ve puzzled over it since that last reading. But in the film, the Coens assign the despair of that first line not to Ellis, whom Bell worries has “turned infidel” in the book, but to Bell himself.\n\nNot only Sheriff Bell—who we learn in the novel was the sole survivor of his unit during World War II and only lived because he ran away when holding out alone proved hopeless—but also Llewellyn Moss and Carson Wells aim at self-sufficiency and fail utterly. Their greed and pride tempt them into isolation, where Chigurh destroys them both. Bell at least survives to receive prophetic word that hope remains alive. God or grace is reaching for him.\n\nJune 13 will mark the one-year anniversary of McCarthy’s death. I paid tribute to him following his death here.\n\nAs I was closing out unused browser tabs yesterday I was glad to rediscover this in memoriam post on Cormac McCarthy by Declan Leary at The American Conservative, written after McCarthy’s death last month. It’s a good piece, making some insightful comments on McCarthy’s style, his philosophy, and his intentional resistance to easy didactic interpretation—as well as having some fun mocking the insufferable ego and faux intellectualism of wannabe auteur James Franco—but I especially appreciated it for two related points Leary makes near the end.\n\nFirst, Leary responds to a 1992 New York Times profile of McCarthy in which the interviewer lazily turns the desolate setting of Blood Meridian into a mere metaphor:\n\nYet [Richard] Woodward, like later students at McCarthy’s feet, is bothered by the master’s resistance to interpretation. He slips up at one point, writing that McCarthy “has made dozens of similar scouting forays to Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and across the Rio Grande into Chihuahua, Sonora and Coahuila. The vast blankness of the Southwest desert served as a metaphor for the nihilistic violence in his last novel, ‘Blood Meridian,’ published in 1985.”\n\nThis is one way of putting it, but it is not a very good one. Blood Meridian is set against the deserts of Mexico and the American West because it happened there; it cannot have happened anywhere else. If there is symbolism in the landscape, it is God’s, not Cormac McCarthy’s.\n\nSecond, “a related mistake,” Leary cites an obituary that makes a common but fundamentally mistaken assumption about how and why good fiction lasts:\n\nGraeme Wood, eulogizing McCarthy in the Atlantic, makes a related mistake. He writes that “the McCarthy voice was timeless—not in the pedestrian sense of ‘will be read for generations,’ but in the unsettling, cosmological sense that one could not tell whether the voice was ancient or from the distant future.”\n\nThe interpretation is understandable, but the more one reads McCarthy the more firmly located his work feels. It is rock-solid in time and place and bound by historical force, even as it indulges the same fantasy and mystery of other Southern gothic greats. It is a failure either of imagination or of piety to assume that myth and Americana cannot coexist.\n\nWhat Leary is driving at in his critiques of these incomplete appreciations is particularity. His assertion that Blood Meridian “cannot have happened anywhere else” is spot-on. To shift its action in time or place would be to change it utterly and almost certainly to weaken it. Likewise in all of McCarthy’s other books, all of which are closely observed and deliberately specific in every detail. And yet Blood Meridian—and No Country for Old Men and All the Pretty Horses and, most spectacularly, The Road—speak to us wherever we are and will continue to do so.\n\nThis is the paradox of universality or “timelessness,” as Wood puts it in the passage Leary quotes above: If you want to say something genuinely universal, you have to get specific.\n\nThe works of literature that speak most universally, that have the greatest longevity and staying power and that readers come back to over and over, are not those with the most broadly applicable free-floating themes or messages, but those most firmly rooted in a specific time and place, among specific people and their specific mores and customs. What could be more seemingly parochial than Jane Austen’s matchmaking and county balls? Or Dante’s score-settling over the vicissitudes of one town’s politics? Or Shakespeare’s dramas of royal intrigue? Or Homer’s war stories? Or Moby-Dick’s painstaking account of every facet of whaling? And yet what books have dug deeper into human nature, heroism, home, love, sin, or salvation?\n\nIt took me a long time to grasp this (and it is largely thanks to Jane Austen, Dante, and Homer that I did). But how many young writers striving for greatness through theme or message or—worst of all—political enlightenment miss out on permanence because they don’t first humble themselves and attend to particulars? Know thyself is not only a philosophical necessity.\n\nI wrote about the particularity of good fiction—and the present day’s lazy resort to “thinking in categories”—in another context last year. That post was inspired by an observation about the “antagonistic relationship” between politics, “the great generalizer,” and fiction, “the great particularizer.” And of course particularity of the kind McCarthy evinced contributes to the “vivid and continuous fictive dream.”\n\nThis spring I finally reread the very first novel by Cormac McCarthy I ever read—Blood Meridian. This is the worst possible place to begin in McCarthy’s body of work, but it was the one I had heard of and I slugged away at it over several months one summer in 2005 or 2006. I finished it as befuddled as I was impressed, but it stayed with me, and it only grew in my estimation over the years as I read more and more of his work and figured out who McCarthy was and what he was doing in that most baroque and bleak of his novels.\n\nRereading it was a revelation. I had intended to write a long review and appreciation here, but this has been the busiest and most difficult semester I’ve worked through in a while and that project never came to fruition.\n\nBut as I was reading about Blood Meridian I came across an admiring but not uncritical piece on McCarthy from Chilton Williamson Jr at the Spectator. After summarizing a few of McCarthy’s most nightmarish novels, giving special attention to Child of God, which has turned off more than one of my friends to McCarthy’s work, Williamson makes this striking argument in his conclusion:\n\nI do not think it farfetched to imagine that McCarthy means to suggest the ability of art to conquer insanity and evil by raising them to a higher level, or power. If that is not indeed his intent, the sole plausible alternative is that McCarthy is a nihilist, which I do not believe. Nihilists are without hope. Yet, ‘People without hope,’ Flannery O’Connor thought, ‘do not write novels.’\n\nBringing Flannery O’Connor into it only set the hook deeper, of course.\n\nThis passage, delivered almost as a throwaway observation in the wake of Williamson’s summary of the most disturbing highlights in Child of God, caught my attention because as long as I’ve been reading McCarthy’s work I have heard and seen him called a nihilist, and just as long it has been my intuition that McCarthy is not.\n\nWhat is more, I feel like this should be rather obvious, especially so in his two most recently published novels: No Country for Old Men (2005) and The Road (2006). Both are violent picaresques in which men flee evils that implacably pursue them across barren and desolate lands, and both end in the heroes’ deaths. Each has more than its share of the bleak and disturbing, not least The Road, which features, among other things in a landscape marked by some kind of apocalypse, cannibalism.\n\nBut the entire point of The Road is also hope. That’s precisely because it concerns preserving life into the next generation. The bleakness only emphasizes how important this remote and unlikely hope is and makes it shine all the brighter. Indeed, the most important and often-repeated metaphor at the heart of the book is that the unnamed father and son are “carrying the fire,” saving what they can—not least each other.*\n\nAnd it is striking to me that the image of “carrying the fire” also appears in the conclusion of No Country for Old Men. Here’s Sheriff Bell’s concluding reflection on his father, which comes at the end of a novel marked throughout by greed and lethal, merciless violence:\n\nI had two dreams about him after he died. I dont remember the first one all that well but it was about meetin him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. But the second one was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin through the mountains of a night. Goin through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin. Never said nothin. He just rode on past and he had this blanket wrapped around him and he had his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin on ahead and that he was fixin to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.\n\nMaking a fire “somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold,” a spot of light and warmth built from the preserved remains of the past despite the dark and cold—if that’s not an image of hope I don’t know what is.\n\nBut the final piece of evidence is the very bleakness and violence in McCarthy’s novels. Evil in McCarthy’s work always is evil, and while it is often random and casual it is never presented indifferently. Indeed, the characters most indifferent to and animalistic in the violence they inflict, as in Glanton’s crew of scalphunters in Blood Meridian or the various cartel thugs in No Country, are the most clearly and purely evil. Everyone else is mixed, whether Judge Holden, a titan of both intellect and perversity and the most clearly Satanic figure in any of McCarthy’s books; or the Kid, in whom “broods already a taste for mindless violence” on page one but who learns nonetheless what good and evil are; or Llewelyn Moss, a seemingly straightforward working man protagonist who sets the plot of No Country for Old Men in motion by stealing and running and only keeps it going by refusing to give up his loot.\n\nNone of this would matter to a nihilist, and as O’Connor put it in the line quoted by Williamson above, “People without hope do not write novels.”\n\nWhat I think McCarthy might be more interested in is guilt and sin, and it is only true to life that everyone and everything is tainted with it. And only when one is indisputably, bluntly, violently confronted with one’s need for hope can hope be made clearest and most enticing.** Per Sheriff Bell, you’ll love the fire more if you know how dark and cold the night is.\n\nThere’s certainly more to consider here, and I don’t pretend to have reached the bottom of this. But I think Williamson is right to contend with those who characterize McCarthy as a prophet of meaninglessness and despair, and to suggest, even in passing, some of where McCarthy may hide those elusive and flickering embers of hope.\n\nYou can read Williamson’s entire piece on McCarthy at the Spectator here. I was pushed to finally reread Blood Meridian by an appreciative but in many ways wrongheaded essay on the novel at the LA Review of Books, which you can read here.\n\n*I read The Road as a single college senior when it was first published. I reread it a few years ago as the father of three. If you’re a father and take your duties at all seriously, read and reread The Road. Here are some thoughts from when I reread it a few years ago.\n\n**Here’s Flannery O’Connor again: “When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax and use more normal means of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock—to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures.”\n\nI just finished reading a fine novel called This Dark Road to Mercy, by North Carolina novelist Wiley Cash. It’s a worthwhile read, but as I was entering the homestretch last night I read a scene that got me thinking about the great but often untapped potential in minor, incidental characters in fiction—the kind of characters who appear for only one or two scenes and may not even have names.\n\nThe context:\n\nThis Dark Road to Mercy tells the story of Easter and Ruby Quillby, young girls living in a foster home in Gastonia, North Carolina after their mother overdoses. Their estranged father, failed minor league baseball player Wade Chesterfield, discovering some principle and responsibility late in life, decides that he should take them in even though he signed away his parental rights years ago. He convinces them to run away with him. They are pursued by two implacable men: Brady Weller, a disgraced former detective with Gastonia PD who now works as an ad litem advocate for the girls, and Pruitt, a bouncer on a mission to recover cash that Wade stole from his boss. Pruitt also has a personal score to settle with Wade.\n\nThe scene:\n\nHaving made a grisly discovery that indicates Pruitt is very close to catching them, Wade takes the girls to a convenience store and has Easter, the older of the two, go inside to get the bathroom key so he can change clothes. Here’s the first appearance of the character(s) I want to look at:\n\nThe store was empty except for a fat blond-headed woman and a guy with a ponytail who were both standing behind the counter. When I walked in the woman was trying to light a cigarette, but she kept laughing at something the guy had said to her. I stood in front of the register until she’d lit her cigarette and tossed the lighter onto the counter.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked. The guy laughed again like he remembered what was so funny about what he’d said before I came in. He turned and walked back into a little office, and the woman watched him go. She looked at me again. “What do you need, baby?”\n\n“I need to use the bathroom,” I said. “It’s locked.”\n\nThe woman reached under the counter and pulled out a long piece of wood with a key attached to the end of it. “Don’t leave this in there,” she said. “The door locks behind you.” I took the key and walked back to the bathroom.\n\nLater, after Wade has changed, he sends Easter back inside to return the key.\n\nThe woman was alone behind the register when I went back into the store. I set the key on the counter.\n\n“You okay?” she asked.\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“You were in there a long time,” she said. “I almost came looking for you.”\n\n“I’m sick,” I said. “Sorry.”\n\n“I hope you feel better,” she said.\n\n“Thank you,” I said. “I hope so too.”\n\nSo far so good. A realistically rendered but mundane series of exchanges. Anyone who has grown up in the South has had this interaction, right down to the “baby” (or perhaps “honey” in other circumstances, as “baby” is reserved for children).\n\nBut then the scene I’m about to describe came along and I appreciated the craft Cash had put into these characters. Pruitt, following not long after, snookers a cop into revealing the likely place he can find Wade and reaches the same convenience store. He goes inside to pursue his own investigation and we meet these employees again:\n\nThe closest gas station had a pay phone in the corner of the parking lot. The girl’s picture was somewhere in the glove compartment, and my hands riffled through the papers looking for the same face that had been stapled to the cafeteria wall back in Gastonia.\n\nInside the station, a skinny kid with a ponytail and an older woman stood behind the counter and stared while the picture was unfolded on the counter in front of them. My finger pointed down at the photo. “Have you seen this girl?”\n\nThe kid with the ponytail took his eyes off the photo and looked at me, but the woman put on a pair of glasses that hung from a string around her neck and stretched her neck until her face was close to the picture. She took her glasses off and looked up. “And who are you?” she asked.\n\n“It doesn’t matter. Have you seen this kid or not?”\n\n“It certainly does matter,” the woman said, leaning her hip into the counter and folding her arms across her chest. “Are you the police, or are you just some kind of weirdo?”\n\n“Police.”\n\n“Well,” she said. “I’d like to see a badge.”\n\nBoth the kid’s and the woman’s eyes followed my hand as it reached for my back pocket. They waited, expecting to see a badge, but instead they saw five twenties laid out on the counter. “Have you seen her or not.”\n\nThe kid looked at me, and then he looked down at the money. He reached out and scooped it up and folded it into his pocket. “She was in here,” he said. “It wasn’t even twenty minutes ago.”\n\n“Damn it, Cody,” the woman said. She smacked his arm.\n\nCody raised his finger and pointed out the door behind me. “They went across the street.”\n\nAnd away we go.\n\nFor comparison’s sake:\n\nThe scene reminded me, upon reflection, of a favorite from Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men, another cat-and-mouse story of pursuit across the margins of the South. In this passage, the ruthless cartel hitman Anton Chigurh has just finished searching protagonist Llewelyn Moss’s trailer. He suspects Moss has fled but, just to be sure, decides to get more information. He stops at the trailer park office. McCarthy:\n\nHe drove down and parked in front of the office and went in. Yessir, the woman said.\n\nI’m looking for Llewelyn Moss.\n\nShe studied him. Did you go up to his trailer?\n\nYes I did.\n\nWell I’d say he’s at work. Did you want to leave a message?\n\nWhere does he work?\n\nSir I aint at liberty to give out no information about our residents.\n\nChigurh looked around at the little plywood office. He looked at the woman.\n\nWhere does he work.\n\nSir?\n\nI said where does he work.\n\nDid you not hear me? We cant give out no information.\n\nA toilet flushed somewhere. A doorlatch clicked. Chigurh looked at the woman again. Then he went out and got in the Ramcharger and left.\n\nAll stories have minor characters, so what makes these stand out? Why do they feel like real people—one can certainly imagine these being distant cousins, or maybe attending the same women’s Bible study—when so many authors’ minor characters are flat, interchangeable, and immediately forgotten?\n\nTwo standout traits:\n\nLook back at these two passages and see how Cash and McCarthy craft these characters. A few things stand out to me:\n\nFirst and foremost—the language they use. McCarthy’s trailer park manager is informal but, when Chigurh presses her, adopts a terse, official tone (“aint at liberty” is a wonderfully suggestive blend of everyday dialect and the language of pronouncement). She gives as good as she gets and—remarkably—is the only person in the novel to resist Chigurh and live.\n\nThe gas station cashier in Cash’s book is more fully developed and we also benefit from a binocular view of her—we see her in two different situations, which gives her depth. With Easter she is informal and sweet in the way of Southern ladies to children. She freely expresses concern and wishes Easter well. She uses simple interrogative or declarative sentences (“And who are you?” and “It certainly does matter” and “I’d like to see a badge”) and pushes back against every move Pruitt makes. She has him sized up the moment he enters the store and tries to ice him out.\n\nWhich brings me to the second thing that stands out—body language. As much or as little as each author gives us, you can see these characters. McCarthy’s woman gets no direct physical description but we do read this: “She studied him.” This comes before she has even spoken a word. If you’re paying attention, you know Chigurh is in trouble the moment you read that line. (A side note: Where would the South be without the obstructive middle aged ladies who act as our gatekeepers?) This one line of action gives us all we need to know to understand what she’s about to do.\n\nCash includes more detail. The cashier is fat, blonde, smokes, and is old enough not just to use reading glasses but to wear them around her neck. The telling bit of body language comes when Pruitt shows her his stolen photo of Easter: “the woman put on a pair of glasses that hung from a string around her neck and stretched her neck until her face was close to the picture. She took her glasses off and looked up.” Cash does something subtle here, suggesting her slow, drawn out movements (notice the repetition of “neck”) which heighten the message she’s transmitting: sarcastic dismissal. She’s not going to cooperate.\n\nSo Cash and McCarthy present us with a pair of nicely drawn minor characters. So what?\n\nThe use of minor characters:\n\nThere’s a few important things I think writers can take away from these examples. In no particular order, here are some of the uses I see of the well-realized minor character:\n\nCharacterizing the major characters—Cash’s gas station cashiers offer a particularly fine example, and it all comes down to perspective. We see these characters two ways—first, Easter, a young girl, sees them as “a fat blond-headed woman and a guy with a ponytail,” the kinds of attributes a kid would notice. Pruitt, when he arrives, thinks of them dismissively as “a skinny kid with a ponytail and an older woman.” At this point in the novel we’re already two-thirds of the way in, but Cash is still characterizing his narrators by showing us how they perceive the same minor characters differently.\n\nObstructing the major characters—I’ve already used the word obstructive in this post, and intentionally so. No real-life plan or story proceeds on a perfectly straight line, just jokes and Reader’s Digest anecdotes. Things get in the way. Most of the great action movies excel at throwing physical obstacles in front of their heroes: in The Guns of Navarone the commando team’s explosives are sabotaged, Ethan Hunt’s team in Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol deal with repeated equipment failure, and in Raiders of the Lost Ark Indy has to travel, avoid assassination, disguise himself and sneak into a Nazi camp, knock down walls, steal a horse, chase and take over a truck, and fight or kill snakes, a giant airplane mechanic, and a host of other enemies before he can get the Ark. What Cash and McCarthy offer us here are character-driven versions of those obstacles, which complicate and intensify the plot—even if only for a few pages or lines—and, again, reveal things about the major characters who encounter them.\n\nMaking the world feel real—I’ve slowly developed a loathing for the term world-building and I’m not fond of the word realistic any more; what I prefer to emphasize is truth or at least truthfulness. Introducing well-realized minor characters makes your story feel true. Because of their speech, their gestures, the shifts in their attitudes that reveal their priorities, the ladies in This Dark Road to Mercy and No Country for Old Men seem to have their own lives that we, along with the characters, have blundered into. We get the sense that we’re just seeing a slice of them. And the upshot for the main characters—and the rest of the story—is that such minor characters make it feel like they have a more spacious world to move around in.\n\nSurprising the reader—A lot of fiction features obliging minor characters who show up just to convey information to or do things for the main characters. When an antagonist like Pruitt or Chigurh is suddenly stopped and has to reckon with an unexpected obstacle—especially one so unassuming—it should be a jolt to the reader as well. Running across someone like the cashier or the trailer park manager is a nice surprise.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons to give minor characters a bit of depth, to make them feel real or true, but these are a few good ones to start with.\n\nA final thought on method—and a bit of a warning:\n\nCash and McCarthy brought these characters to life through the details they selected to present us. John Gardner, in The Art of Fiction, writes that “vivid detail is the life blood of fiction.” Elsewhere in the same book he writes of “closely observed detail,” “concrete detail,” “authenticating detail,” and warns against “insufficient detail.”\n\nThis is not to advocate the Victor Hugo kitchen sink style, including everything. Note the adjectives: vivid, closely observed, concrete, authenticating detail. Carefully, precisely chosen from life. We do not need every gesture a character makes, just the ones that show us what we need, the ones that tell us who this person is in the two or three pages in which we get to know them. (See again that Ciardi line about poetry being “the art of knowing what to leave out.”)\n\nRead both of these books if you haven’t. I’ve just dwelt at a little length on two minor characters. But these minor characters are excellent case studies of what a good, careful, purposeful writer can do with material that not everyone takes the time to develop."
