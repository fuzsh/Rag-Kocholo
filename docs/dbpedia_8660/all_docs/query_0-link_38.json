        "text": "There’s plenty of Southern and plenty of gothic in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (out 9/26), but it’s actually a rather astonishing departure for the cult Southern Gothic novelist.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

And “gothic,” really, understates matters: Their world is sparsely peopled by the desperate and deranged, most of whom must be avoided like the worst of the Mad Max lot.\n\nThe simplest, sparest dialogue here — the father reassuring the son, and the son saying “Okay” — can have the force of a gut-punch. And putting down the novel even momentarily can leave you wracked with worry as you wonder if the two will be okay.\n\nIt’s incredibly bleak, but it’s also a deeply moving metaphorical direct hit, given our current post-9/11, Christian Rapturist, post-Katrina, pre-whatever-the-hell cultural moment.\n\nThe Road is riveting and devastating — and one of the best novels of the year.\n\n“>BUY Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (Knopf; 256 pages)"
