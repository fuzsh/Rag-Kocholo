        "text": "In Blood Meridian McCarthy shows us a disturbing portrait of the generation who lived to experience the final expansion of the West. The novel focuses in particular on the area South of the US border in the late nineteenth century. The novel is rather consistent with history in that it dramatizes the deeds of infamous scalp hunters like Kirker and John Joel Glanton who are historical figures. History is central to a reading of Blood Meridian, but in this case, the novel is read metaphorically and a search for ideas about religion and faith and references to the Bible and other texts is central. Certain passages from the Revelation in the Bible seem to match the language and themes of Blood Meridian. In particular, the conflict between the kid and the judge in Blood Meridian has a counterpart in the Revelation. The suggested metaphorical reading focuses on the identity of one of the main characters of the novel the judge. The premise of this metaphorical reading is the parallel between the judge and the Biblical Devil. The metaphor has to do with the way the judge seems to be a devil that influences mankind and causes an apocalypse on earth. There are references in the language of Blood Meridian that seem to hint at the Apocalyptic Riders, Armageddon and the second death from the Biblical Revelation. The entire human race with few exceptions is presented as violent and evil in Blood Meridian. The judge is by far the most intelligent and seems to be a source of evil. It is suggested that he might be the protagonist, and that his aim is the complete seduction of humanity. It is argued that the judge in many ways shares personal traits with the Biblical Devil in that he is presented as attractive and persuasive in spite of his evil nature. The character of the judge is also a sexual being in a way that repels most readers, 2 and he is described as the uncensored extreme of the male sex, but a perverted extreme due to his interest in children and torture. In the judge, McCarthy has created the worst anti hero ever, and it can be argued that he is present even when he is not visible. McCarthy has given his judge or devil super natural abilities and everlasting life, and his snake-like appearance is another trait that he shares with the Biblical Devil. But the truly frightening part of the novel might be that God or the values that a Christ-figure carries seem to be absent. The kid is a character that is in great conflict between traits that belong to childhood; innocence and faith and a terrible tendency to violence. In the course of the novel, he seems to give up violence and give into “clemency” to use the expression of the judge. The first sign of this humane attitude is when he demonstrates kindness towards the other scalp hunters. By the end of the day, he refuses to kill the judge even when it seems right to do so. Throughout the novel, the kid demonstrates a tendency to hesitate and an unwillingness to make important decisions. He appears to be a victim by destination and it is possible that he suffers a terrible death by the hand of the judge. In a certain way he defies the judge in his refusal to dedicate himself fully to violence, but still he cannot escape his final. Blood Meridian seems apocalyptic in many ways, and one apocalyptic trait is that nobody cares about the next generation. Children are objects of consumption in a frightening way, and they are molested and killed in cold blood on many occasions. Along the way, it seems that the violence commit the gang members more and more to the gang and this is seen metaphorically to represent the history of war and violence and consumerism. Whenever there is a church in Blood Meridian, there are also signs that bloodshed has taken place, and the buildings have not protected the people in them. The Christ figures made from stone or wood and other symbols appear invalid, pathetic and depraved of meaning. The question of interest is if the appearance of religious institutions is representative of the author’s feelings about faith and religion. Blood Meridian does not seem to present a single romantic scene, and love is as absent as God. Yet, sex is everywhere. There are whores, sodomizers, child molesters, homosexuals, ritual castrations, raping of scalped and dying women and other examples of sexual torture. The only kind of sex that does not seem interesting to the perverted generation in Blood Meridian is the kind that may result in offspring. It seems symbolic for the general apocalyptic atmosphere in the novel. There are episodes in Blood Meridian where the character of the judge seems to represent God as he acts in certain passages in the Hebrew Scriptures, and the conclusion is that he is a complex character, and that much depends on the reading. In this context, it has been attempted to point out his similarity with the Devil. In Blood Meridian we read prophesies, and later, we read of their fulfillment. We also read about super natural events and occultism. These particular traits cooperate to create a text that seems to aspire to a sacred text and the initiator or driving force is always the judge. If he represents the Devil, Blood Meridian seems to be a twisted antithetical counterpart to the Bible. It is not easily discovered what the central story in Blood Meridian is. In the last chapters, it becomes clearer, and it seems that it is all in the relationship between the kid and the judge. The kid’s refusal to develop exactly according to the wishes of the judge is the central conflict that seems to cost him his life by the end of the day. Some passages are pointed out as metafictional in that they do not contribute to the unfolding of the drama, and the reader may get the impression that McCarthy preaches. It is rather clear that he does not preach a hope or a God-given way out of the environmental problems or mankind’s lack of wisdom. It seems more likely that McCarthy presents his reader to a nihilistic rejection of faith. Rather than presenting his reader to a new faith, he presents the absolute loss of faith, hope and love. According to this metaphorical reading, Blood Meridian is a picture of a world in the hands of a devil. Many other readings are possible, and the potential of Blood Meridian cannot easily be exhausted. No final judgment upon the values of the novel or its author is intended."
