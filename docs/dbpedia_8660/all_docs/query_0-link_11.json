        "text": "Cormac McCarthy (born July 20, 1933, Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.—died June 13, 2023, Santa Fe, New Mexico) was an American writer in the Southern gothic tradition whose novels about wayward characters in the rural American South and Southwest are noted for their dark violence, dense prose, and stylistic complexity.\n\nMcCarthy attended the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and served in the U.S. Air Force from 1953 to 1956. Readers were first introduced to McCarthy’s difficult narrative style in the novel The Orchard Keeper (1965), about a Tennessee man and his two mentors. Social outcasts highlight such novels as Outer Dark (1968), about two incestuous siblings; Child of God (1974; film 2013), about a lonely man’s descent into depravity; and Suttree (1979), about a man who overcomes his fixation on death.\n\nMcCarthy’s Blood Meridian (1985), a violent frontier tale, was a critical sensation, hailed as his masterpiece. Blood Meridian tells the story of 14-year-old boy who joins a gang of outlaws hunting Native Americans along the U.S.-Mexico border in the 1840s. The group is headed by a malevolent figure called the Judge, who leads the gang through a series of staggeringly amoral actions, through which McCarthy explores the nature of good and evil.\n\nMcCarthy achieved popular fame with All the Pretty Horses (1992; film 2000), winner of the National Book Award. The first volume of The Border Trilogy, it is the coming-of-age story of John Grady Cole, a Texan who travels to Mexico. The second installment, The Crossing (1994), set before and during World War II, follows the picaresque adventures of brothers Billy and Boyd Parham and centres around three round-trip passages that Billy makes between southwestern New Mexico and Mexico. The trilogy concludes with Cities of the Plain (1998), which interweaves the lives of John Grady Cole and Billy Parham through their employment on a ranch in New Mexico."
