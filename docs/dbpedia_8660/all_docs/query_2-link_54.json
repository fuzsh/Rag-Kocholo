        "text": "This paper offers close textual readings of some of Plath’s late poems where images of the mutilated and objectified body convey the dehumanizing effect of consumerism, while objects assume an aura of perfection and completeness that humans can only aspire to. In Plath’s poetry, representations of the dissected human body proliferate: the body parts become objects interchangeable with commodities. The dissociation of body parts are metaphors of the fragmentation of identity due to a perceived lack or disability: the learned helplessness of people in a consumer society is generated by a cycle of consumption in which people quickly obtain and discard commodities while their productive bodies – especially those of women – are also commodified. Consumerism affects not only economic behaviour but all aspects of human life: in interpersonal relationships, the consumerist attitude of the interchangeability of objects brings about the interchangeability of human beings. While people become dependent on consumer goods, they develop a sense of disability which makes them rely on commodities – both inanimate and human – to make them whole and confer an identity on them. This process affects the psyche of the male and the female consumer in distinctly different ways. Even so, bodies participate in an economy of mutual consumption, which results in severe impairment and impoverishment of the human psyche. This paper examines the way in which Plath’s poems convey – through images of dissociated body parts, illness, and disability – the idea that consumer culture mutilates the human psyche by objectifying and commodifying human beings.\n\nConsiderations of the queer thematics of McCarthy’s work remain scant, and interpretations of the novels of the Border Trilogy—All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain—commonly elide the presence of queer affect. At the same time, theorizations of violence in McCarthy’s novels are abundant. Through reading interspecies violence as an expression of queer desire, this article exposes the centrality of queerness to the function and production of violence in the Border Trilogy. I contend that the queer presences in the Border Trilogy produce new insights into our reading of interspecies violence and creates nuance in our understanding of the relationship between transgressive desire and violence in McCarthy’s wider corpus.\n\nThis thesis aims to draw on a selection of earlier literature from American author Cormac McCarthy, to show the ways in which he manipulates narrative to destabilise social and cultural ideologies of truth and reality. The novels examined within this scope will be: Outer Dark; Child of God; Blood Meridian and the three novels forming The Border Trilogy. In creating universes that both parody society through mimesis, and yet are ultimately haunted by perverse representations considered socially taboo, McCarthy’s novels can be read as grotesque performances of the societal constructs that predicate and propagate ideals of normative identification. His evocation and then transcendence of traditional modes of genre resound with theoretical inquiries that invite reconsideration to the way language is used and understood. Relying upon McCarthy’s engagement with such methods and motifs reserved as being socially taboo; namely death, necrophilia, incest, and also the deconstruction of genre, this study aims to examine how his preoccupation with the ‘other’ within language, resists and destabilises the discursive limits that proliferate the idea of a singular, ultimate encompassing reality. Whilst all of McCarthy’s novels in various ways resound with these notions, brevity within the confines of this thesis has meant that only a selection can be explored. The collection chosen here, spanning from the late 1960s through to the mid- 1990s, all display a duality that speaks more to poststructuralist inquiry than the restrictive parameters of historical, theological or nationalistic thematics too often linked to McCarthy’s work.\n\nThe wholesale embrace of genre fiction by contemporary literary writers is currently reorganizing the literary field. This essay looks at the role that genre has played in Cormac McCarthy’s fiction since his turn to the Western with Blood Meridian (1985). It assesses his genre fiction vis-à-vis Mark McGurl’s influential study of the importance of creative writing programs for postwar US fiction in The Program Era (2009). In contrast to the modernist aesthetic institutionalized in program era fiction, I argue that the recent genre turn significantly changes the relationship of literary fiction to reality as well as to institutions. I suggest that the turn to genre should be considered the formal response to a crisis in reality, triggered by twenty-first-century reconceptualizations of the world and our place in it, which requires new ways of representing reality. By reading McCarthy’s The Road (2006) alongside Colson Whitehead’s Zone One (2011), I argue that the genre turn in contemporary literary fiction also marks a turn toward institutions, one that both rejects the anti-institutionality of the program era and a return to the modern disciplinary institution in favor of rethinking a value basis for future institutions.\n\nSet in the nineteenth-century American Southwest, Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian rewrites the conventions of the western genre through a historically informed fictionalized account of the Glanton gang. As part of McCarthy’s subversive literary oeuvre, the novel intends to deromanticize the western’s underlying myths and dismantle its binaries, as well as to expose the brutality of the frontier and reflect on violence as a historiographic condition. Within studies of the western, McCarthy’s work, and transgressive literature, this article wishes to contribute to the existing discussions of McCarthy’s writing by examining Blood Meridian as a critical postmodern western or anti-western, and analyzing its strategies of demythologizing the West and the western.\n\nThe article presents a reading of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006) in terms of the desert. The desert has been a landscape of central importance for McCarthy since Blood Meridian (1985), but it is of unprecedented importance in The Road. Physically, emotionally as morally, every choice the protagonists of The Road face as they trek across the bleak and abstract wasteland of a future America can in some way or other lead back to the ultimate question of deserta, of absence. The problem of the desert, in other words, is the barren ground upon which the central questions of the novel rest. The article concludes with the suggestion that The Road may present a new phase in McCarthy’s authorship, a shift heralded not just by McCarthy’s plunge into a new genre but possibly his entire philosophy."
