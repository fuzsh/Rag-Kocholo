        "text": "Using the three streams of radical environmental philosophy—deep ecology, ecofeminism, and social ecology—this study highlights the subtle and complex environmental ethic in Cormac McCarthy's southern novels. It also reassesses the critical consensus that these works are expressions of existentialist or nihilistic philosophy. By delineating the different relationships that McCarthy's heroes and anti-heroes have with nonhuman nature, an ecocritical analysis views their alienation as the effect of their separation from nonhuman nature. At the root of this alienation is an anthropocentric and mechanistic mode of thinking that is dominant in Western philosophy and that this study defines as Cartesian. While McCarthy's environmentalist heroes are persecuted by Cartesian institutions and displaced from the land on which they have defined themselves and made meaning, his Cartesian anti-heroes represent extreme manifestations of Cartesian thinking. McCarthy's environmentalism is as much a critique and indictment of Cartesian thinking as it is a portrayal of the value of a life lived in close contact with nonhuman nature.\n\nUsing the three streams of radical environmental philosophy—deep ecology, ecofeminism, and social ecology—this study highlights the subtle and complex environmental ethic in Cormac McCarthy's southern novels.

His first four novels published are The Orchard Keeper (1965), Outer Dark (1968), Child of God (1973), and Suttree (1979), reflect the myth character and the culture of East Tennessee and Appalachia. The novel selected for discussion is Outer Dark which was published in 1968. It is a story of incest between a brother and sister, Culla and Rinthy Holme, who have a child together. Culla claims the child has died, and leaves to search for work. Rinthy then searches for her “little chap.” McCarthy’s novel, Outer Dark was a critically popular, and he\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigates maternal mortality in West Java on two levels. First, a review is made of the literature on maternal mortality internationally and with specific focus on West Java. Second, using an innovative method of qualitative data collection (the Rashomon Technique), the importance of different people in dealing with cases of maternal illness and death is analyzed to determine how interventions might change behavior in ways which would better preserve the lives of pregnant and post-partum women in Indonesia.\n\nThis thesis aims to draw on a selection of earlier literature from American author Cormac McCarthy, to show the ways in which he manipulates narrative to destabilise social and cultural ideologies of truth and reality. The novels examined within this scope will be: Outer Dark; Child of God; Blood Meridian and the three novels forming The Border Trilogy. In creating universes that both parody society through mimesis, and yet are ultimately haunted by perverse representations considered socially taboo, McCarthy’s novels can be read as grotesque performances of the societal constructs that predicate and propagate ideals of normative identification. His evocation and then transcendence of traditional modes of genre resound with theoretical inquiries that invite reconsideration to the way language is used and understood. Relying upon McCarthy’s engagement with such methods and motifs reserved as being socially taboo; namely death, necrophilia, incest, and also the deconstruction of genre, this study aims to examine how his preoccupation with the ‘other’ within language, resists and destabilises the discursive limits that proliferate the idea of a singular, ultimate encompassing reality. Whilst all of McCarthy’s novels in various ways resound with these notions, brevity within the confines of this thesis has meant that only a selection can be explored. The collection chosen here, spanning from the late 1960s through to the mid- 1990s, all display a duality that speaks more to poststructuralist inquiry than the restrictive parameters of historical, theological or nationalistic thematics too often linked to McCarthy’s work."
