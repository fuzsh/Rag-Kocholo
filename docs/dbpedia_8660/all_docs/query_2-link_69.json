        "text": "The Roanoke Regional Writers Conference on January 28th, 2017, presents an opportunity for a discussion on writing in and about the Gothic South.\n\nWriters will bring short passages to read and share and critique in our session, sparking conversation about what it means to be caught in a web of horror, and to grapple with the decadent, the ghastly, the corrupt, and the infinitely grotesque nature of the Gothic South.\n\nI had several reasons for suggesting this session to conference chair, Dan Smith. First, I realized that this Gothic South idea was no joke while working as a reporter at the daily newspaper in Charleston SC several decades ago. I have stories from those days, and many are finding their way into the fiction I’ve been quietly writing, trying to come to grips with all that.\n\nSecondly, it seems that lots of Southern writers have grappled with similar demons, dark motives and righteously arrogant aristocrats. They are interesting in their own right. It’s not just that the Gothic South is one of the sub-genres of the gothic novel. It is a unique sub-genre. There may be gothic novels set in other regions, but there is no Eco-Gothic, or Big Apple Gothic, or Southern California Gothic. There is Gothic, and then there is Southern Gothic.\n\nAnd finally, now that the nation has ‘gone South,’ the problem of coping with the Gothic South has gone national.\n\nSo I wondered, how do we make sense of these elements in our lives? How do we use fiction to approach the truth about the human condition in this dark and contradictory region?\n\nOf course, the old Gothic genre is what we call horror today, but infused or sometimes leavened with social insight. Frankenstein and Dracula were considered Gothic Romances in their day. (For an exhaustive history of the gothic novel, see Edith Birkhead: The Tale of Terror: A Study of Gothic Romance, 1921).\n\nBut Southern Gothic is (as one writer said) “more than Southern vampires and trailer park mayhem.” There is an everyday decadence, often contrasted with corroded polish and mad arrogance of the old Southern aristocracy, set against racial upheaval and intergenerational turmoil.\n\nSouthern Gothic writers expose the ancient myth of the noble plantation society that is now “Gone with the Wind” — a myth that still haunts the decadent region and still provides the grand and grotesque backdrop for the modern Southern Gothic novel.\n\nDespite the abundance of writing that is Strange and Southern, the shopping malls and factories that have come to the South have undermined the Gothic element, argues Soil author Jamie Korngay.\n\nI’m not convinced that Southern Gothic is completely viable in a modern-day story. With the flattening of the South, the old aristocrats have all moved to the city. Some stubborn hold-outs and strange relatives have stayed behind in dilapidated mansions, but the rest have been bulldozed to make room for trailer parks and Wal-Marts. Today Southern gentility has been replaced by conservative politics, which is anything but chivalrous. The decay of the Old South is aggressively apparent.\n\nCreate your own Gothic South novel\n\nIt was a _______(adj) and ________(adj) night, and the rain fell like __________(metaphor) on the _________ (cotton or tobacco) _____ fields.
