        "text": "Outstanding, in-depth scholarship by renowned literary critics; great starting point for students seeking an introduction to the theme and the critical discussions surrounding it.\n\nSouthern Gothic Literature presents one of the few book-length surveys of the genre available today, in a diverse collection of representative texts from a group of international critics. In addition to exemplary novels from established writers, such as Edora Welty, Flannery Oâ€™Conner, Carson McCullers, and Cormac McCarthy, works explored here include poetry, a play, and a fairy tale novella. This volume, part of the Critical Insights series, offers a collection of original essays that will establish for students and their teachers an exemplary representation of the genre Southern Gothic as a field of study within American literature.\n\nEdited by Dr. Jay Ellis, Senior Instructor at the University of Colorado-Boulder, recognized as one of the leading authorities in Cormac McCarthy criticism, this volume seeks to extend the scope and diversity of literature that constitutes the genre, drawing upon representative themes, grounded in the diverse, often troubled history of the South, while introducing new perspectives and twists to the form, such as in the work of zombie literature as a generative trope. The introduction of poetry, in readings on Allen Tate, James Dickey, and Donald Justice, among others, into what has been a genre defined by fiction represents the originality of the volume. This collection will also consider the geographical significance of the genre within the broader field Southern literature. Defining genres remains a complex task, and these chapters will provide for readers the constitutive terms to locate, both geographically and metaphorically, the Southern Gothic. Among contributors are Henry Lowell Carrigan, Sharon L. Decker, Michal Sverak, and Ronja Vieth.\n\nAs supplemental material to support readers, this volume includes a list of literary works not mentioned in the book and a bibliography of critical sources for readers seeking to study this timeless theme in greater depth.\n\nEach essay is 2,500 to 5,000 words in length, and all essays conclude with a list of \"Works Cited,\" along with endnotes. Finally, the volume's appendixes offer a section of useful reference resources:\n\nAbout This Volume\n\nCritical Context: Original Introductory Essays\n\nCritical Readings: Original In-Depth Essays\n\nFurther Readings\n\nDetailed Bibliography\n\nDetailed Bio of the Editor\n\nGeneral Subject Index"
