        "text": "Novels↙12Stories↙3Plays↙2Essays↙1References and footnotes\n\nA list of works by or about Cormac McCarthy, the American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. McCarthy published twelve novels, spanning the Southern Gothic, Western, and post-apocalyptic genres, as well as multiple short-stories, screenplays, plays, and an essay.\n\nIn 1985, he published Blood Meridian, which received a lukewarm response. The novel has since gained great esteem and is often seen as his magnum opus — some have even labelled it the Great American Novel.[1]\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\n# Denotes an entry in The Border Trilogy # Denotes an entry in The Western Family Duology\n\nTitle Publication ISBN Ref(s) The Orchard Keeper 1965 ISBN 0-679-72872-4 Outer Dark 1968 ISBN 0-679-72873-2 Child of God 1973 ISBN 0-679-72874-0 Suttree 1979 ISBN 0-679-73632-8 Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West 1985 ISBN 0-679-72875-9 All the Pretty Horses # 1 1992 ISBN 0-679-74439-8 The Crossing # 2 1994 ISBN 0-679-76084-9 Cities of the Plain # 3 1998 ISBN 0-679-74719-2 No Country for Old Men 2005 ISBN 0-375-70667-4 [2] The Road 2006 ISBN 0-307-38789-5 The Passenger 2022 ISBN 0-307-26899-3 [3] Stella Maris 2022 ISBN 0-307-26900-0 [4]\n\nFirst-edition covers of McCarthy's novels\n\nOuter Dark (1968)\n\nSuttree (1979)\n\nThe Road (2006)\n\nShort fiction\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Publication Notes Text \"Wake for Susan\" 1959 [5] [1] \"A Drowning Incident\" 1960 [6] [2] \"The Dark Waters\" 1965 [7] [3]\n\nEssays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Publication Subject Notes Text \"The Kekulé Problem\" 2017 Written for the Santa Fe Institute, it explores the origin of language.
