Maurice Maeterlinck Biography

Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (also called Comte (Count) Maeterlinck; 29 August 1862 â€“ 6 May 1949) was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist who wrote in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. His plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, to a wealthy, French-speaking family. His father, Polydore, was a notary who enjoyed tending the greenhouses on their property. His mother, Mathilde, came from a wealthy family. In September 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion. He had written poems and short novels during his studies, but his father wanted him to go into law. After finishing his law studies at the University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met some members of the new Symbolism movement, Villiers de l'Isle Adam in particular, who would have a great influence on Maeterlinck's subsequent work.)

The Best Poem Of Maurice Maeterlinck

The Passions

Narrow paths my passions tread:

Laughter rings there, sorrow cries;

Sick and sad, with half-shut eyes,

Thro' the leaves the woods have shed,

My sins like yellow mongrels slink;

Uncouth hyenas, my hates complain,

And on the pale and listless plain

Couching low, love's lion's blink.

Powerless, deep in a dream of peace,

Sunk in a languid spell they lie,

Under a colourless, desolate sky,

There they gaze and never cease,

Where like sheep temptations graze,

One by one departing slow:

In the moon's unchanging glow

My unchanging passions gaze.
