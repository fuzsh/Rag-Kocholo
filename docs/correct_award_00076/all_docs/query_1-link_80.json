        "text": "Winning the Nobel Prize is maybe the highest achievement you could accomplish in your field. First prizes were awarded in 1901, and they are still awarded every year, with the pause during World War II, until today.\n\nAlfred Nobel\n\nYou can talk about Nobel Prizes without mention Alfred Bernhard Nobel. He was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, and businessman. He had numerous patents, but the most important was patenting an explosive using nitroglycerine – dynamite.\n\nNobel Prize Winners 1902\n\nEmil Fischer (Chemistry), Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (Physics), Pieter Zeeman (Physics)\n\nSweden – 1962/12/10\n\nThe Nobel Prize\n\nThe popular story exists that, after the death of his brother Ludvig, newspapers published that Alfred passed away, stating that he will leave behind him a dynamite – the way to kill more people than ever before. So, some claim that it was guilt that drove him to establish Nobel Prizes. Others still think it’s a myth.\n\nNobel Prize Winners 1908\n\nKlas Pontus Arnoldson & Fredrik Bajer (Peace)\n\nNorway – 1968/12/10\n\nNo matter which one is the truth, the fact is that in his last will Nobel donated most of his fortune to establish prizes which would be awarded yearly for the greatest achievements in five fields. The original Nobel Prizes were awarded in physical science, chemistry, medical science or physiology, literature. The fifth prize is a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The first laureates were: Wilhelm Rontgen (Physics), Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff (Chemistry), Emil von Behring (Physiology or Medicine), Sully Prudhomme (Literature) and Henry Dunant & Frédéric Passy (Peace).\n\nNobel Prizes, 75th Anniversary\n\nEmil von Behring (Germany, the first Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, 1901),\n\nRene Sully Prudhomme (France, the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901),\n\nWilhelm K. Röntgen (Germany, the first Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1901),\n\nJacobus H. van 't Hoff (Germany, the first Nobel Prize for Chemistry, in 1901\n\nUruguay – 1976/11/12\n\nNobel Prizes until Today\n\nSince 1901, each year, on December 10 (the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death), Nobel Prizes are awarded.\n\nNobel Prize for Literature - German Winners\n\nGerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946), Nobel Prize 1912\n\nHermann Hesse (1877-1962), Nobel Prize 1946\n\nThomas Mann (1875-1955) Nobel Prize Literature 1929\n\n(West) Germany – 1978/02/16\n\nNobel prizes were cancelled due to World War II in 1940, 1941, and 1942. Also, not all 5 Nobel Prizes were awarded each year, although, after 1973, all Nobel Prizes, in all fields were awarded.\n\nIn 1969, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen “for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes.”\n\nMost Notable Nobel Laureates\n\nIt’s hard to say who was more or less important as a laureate, but I’ll try to mention maybe the most important and famous:\n\nMarie Curie - Nobel Prize in Physis 1908 (with her husband for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel), and in Chemistry 1911 (in recognition of her work in radioactivity)\n\nAlbert Einstein - 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for “his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” - www.advancedsciencenews.com\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross - \"The organization won Nobel Peace Prizes in 1917, 1944 and 1963 for its humanitarian services.\" - https://science.howstuffworks.com\n\nNobel in Belgium - 10 Nobel Prizes\n\n1st row - Jules Bordet (Physiology or Medicine, 1919), Corneille Heymans (Physiology or Medicine, 1938), Maurice Maeterlinck (Literature, 1911)\n\n2nd row - Albert Claude and Christian De Duve (Physiology or Medicine, 1974), François Englert / Robert Brout (Physics, 2013)\n\n3rd row - Ilya Prigogine (Chemistry, 1977)\n\n4th row - Institut de Droit International / Gustave Rolin-Jacquemyns (Peace, 1904), Auguste Marie François Beernaert (Peace, 1909), Dominique Pire (Peace, 1958), Henri La Fontaine (Peace, 1913)\n\nBelgium – 2016/10/24\n\nToday we’ve mentioned some important facts related to Nobel Prizes, but we’ve also seen some very interesting stamps with Nobel Prize laureates."
