        "text": "February 29, 2016\n\nSometimes I amaze myself with my ignorance. I had never heard of Maurice Maeterlinck, a Belgian playwright and poet who won a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911 \"in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their\n\nimaginations\". The Wiki article goes on to say that Maeterlinck formed an important part of the Symbolist movement. (Which I am also ignorant about and will research a bit later.)\n\nI already want to read more of his work, not only because of my curiosity about the man himself, but because now I want to compare Joyzelle with some of his other plays. I liked Joyzelle, it has some lovely phrases and deep thoughts, but it also puzzled me a bit, not to mention the fact that this play is responsible for adding more than a few new titles to my GR Want-To-Read list. Let me explain....\n\nJoyzelle is a five act play set on Merlin's island, with only four characters: Merlin himself (yes, the Merlin of King Arthur fame), Lanceor (Merlin's son, but Lanceor does not know this), Joyzelle (a beautiful and noble young woman) and Arielle (listed as Merlin's 'genius', she is invisible to everyone except Merlin).\n\nAct One begins with Merlin addressing the sleeping Arielle. I loved this opening speech. Here is a small sample:\n\nYou sleep, my docile and familiar little fairy, and your hair, straying like a blue mist, invisible to men, mingles with the moon, the perfumes of the night, the rays of the stars, the roses that shed their petals, the spreading sky, to remind us thus that nothing separates us from any existing thing and that our thought does not know where the light begins for which it hopes, nor where the shadow ends which it escapes....\n\nMerlin awakens Arielle, and they discuss their plans. The time has come to test the destinies of Lanceor and Joyzelle. Those two are brought to the island by Merlin's magic, they meet and fall in love. As the play progesses they are tested, well, mostly Joyzelle is tested: is her love powerful and true or merely surface deep? Would she love Lanceor even if he were old and ugly, even if he deceived her? All the action over the next few acts was designed by Merlin to verify whether or not this was the woman Fate intended as Lanceor's mate. Or could Merlin have her himself, as Arielle wishes, in order to avoid his own Destiny? (Which Arielle seemed to know but Merlin was not so\n\naware of.) It all sounds a bit confusing trying to relate the plot here without giving too much away, but it makes more sense when you are reading, I promise.\n\nThe reason this play puzzles me is that it makes me wonder why Joyzelle is the only one being so sorely tested. Why not have Lanceor suffer a bit as well? Was this the author's attitude towards women at the time he wrote (1903) or what? Why weren't the qualities of Lanceor's love tested? Would he love Joyzelle even if she were old and ugly, even if she decieved him? Merlin never seemed to wonder about that. He did say there was something in Joyzelle that he could not read; perhaps he was able to see all about Lanceor, while Joyzelle had mysteries in her character that even Merlin could not figure out. This is one reason I want to read more of this author's work: is the attitude Merlin's or Maeterlinck's?\n\nOf course once I got going I wondered if this play was based on some legend about Merlin. There is my ignorance again: Merlin to me was just that old wizard in all the King Arthur tales. So off I went to Wiki and read a bit about him. And learned about Geoffrey of Monmouth, who first created the Merlin we all know. This was in 1136 or so. Well, to spare you too many details, this led me to a book called Six Old English Chronicles: Ethelwerd's Chronicle, Asser's Life of Alfred, Geoffrey of Monmouth's British History, Gildas, Nennius and Richard of; then a lovely illustration sent me to Lewis Spence and his book Legends and Romances of Brittany, which led me to others he had written, about Mexico and Peru, about Spain, and about the Rhineland. All of these are now on my Someday Lists. Merlin, may I have my clone now, please? I have a lot of reading to do!"
