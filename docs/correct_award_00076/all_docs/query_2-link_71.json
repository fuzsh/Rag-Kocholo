        "text": "Description\n\nThe Life of the Bee by Maurice Maeterlinck\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck, author of ‘The Blue Bird’, winner of the Nobel prize and one of the most popular writers in the world at the turn of the century, learned early in life to love bees. His father’s garden in Belgium was full of them. The drama of the hive fascinated him and, by closely observing the busy lives of its inmates, he created this enchanted book. “Nothing”, wrote Maeterlinck, “is more exciting than a wall behind which something is happening.” With humour and mischief he lures the reader into a world both real and magical, so that his intimate portrait of bee life becomes a drama of epic proportions.\n\nFeatures;\n\nFolio Society First Impression No. 814\n\nPublisher Folio Society, London; 1995\n\nBrown Cloth Hardback, 224 pp\n\nWith illustrations by Wilf Hartley\n\nSize 230 x 160mm, 800g\n\nCondition: Fine – Superb Unmarked Copy\n\n5 Good Reasons To BUY NOW !!!\n\nFREE UK Delivery, Overseas Postage at Reduced Rate\n\nSuperfast Delivery – I always try to post within 24 hrs of payment to ensure you get your book(s) as quickly as possible.\n\nProfessional Packaging – I always use Top Quality packaging products to ensure you receive your item in the condition it was sent.\n\nMember of IOBA – “The books you want…from sellers you can trust”, www.ioba.org\n\n100% Satisfaction Guaranteed – If you are not 100% satisfied with your book then simply return it for a refund"
