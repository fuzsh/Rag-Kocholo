As a result, 'The Intelligence of Flowers' is happily welcome once more, in this centenary reissue.\" — San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"The republication of Maurice Maeterlinck's 'The Intelligence of Flowers,' regrettably forgotten in our time, is long overdue. The introduction by Mosley is itself a gem, and contains one of the best overviews in print of writings about intelligence in Nature.\" — Stephen Harrod Buhner, author of The Secret Teachings of Plants: The Intelligence of the Heart in the Direct Perception of Nature"
