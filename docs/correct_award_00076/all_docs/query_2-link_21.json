He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 \"in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations\". The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life.Â\n\nContents:\n\nThe Blue Bird\n\nThe Life of the Bee\n\nOur Friend the Dog\n\nThe miracle of Saint Anthony\n\nWisdom and Destiny\n\nThe Double Garden\n\nThe Inner Beauty\n\nPoems"
