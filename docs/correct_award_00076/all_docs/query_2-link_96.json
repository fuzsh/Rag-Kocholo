Let me know if you are interested\n\nAlready December!\n\nI have decided to join Lynn in her Countdown to 2024. Click on the link to check her daily prompts and join us.\n\nSo this has been a busy posting week:\n\nThursday: November wrap up\n\nFriday: Countdown to 2024: Day 1\n\nFriday: The top 7 books to read in December 2023\n\nSaturday: Countdown to 2024: Day 2\n\nSaturday: 6 degrees of separation: from a kitchen to a bot\n\nAnd I finished two books this week:\n\nJUST READ / LISTENED TO üéß\n\nüìö L‚ÄôOiseau bleu,\n\nby Maurice MaeterlinckPlay/Fantasy\n\n1905\n\n198 pages\n\nThe book is available in English as\n\nThe Blue Bird: A Fairy Play in Six Acts\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nWow, I really had no idea what this was going to be!\n\nOriginally, I even thought it was a novella, then discovered it‚Äôs a play. And what a play!\n\nIt‚Äôs so rich with so many themes, around the idea of happiness and how two poor children were led to find it.\n\nThe text is so rich, with even amazing beautiful words just to describe the settings.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a lot of humor.\n\nThere are deeper, even theological themes, like when the children meet the souls of animals and trees.\n\nI can‚Äôt even imagine how difficult this must be to produce this play.\n\nI know it also exists as a movie and am going to try to watch it.\n\nWith our modern technology, it would be an awesome book to turn into an animated movie!\n\nNo wonder the author won the Nobel Prize in literature. I definitely want t read more by him.\n\nüéß Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris\n\nby Graham Robb, Nonfiction/History/France\n\n2010 496 pages / 14 H\n\nNarrated by Simon Vance\n\nRead for #NonficNov\n\nI as so impressed by The Discovery of France: A Historical Geography, that I decided to listen right away to the author‚Äôs book on Paris, especially when I realized the copy available through my Public Library and Hoopla was narrated by Simon Vance!\n\nLet‚Äôs first get the narrator out of the way. Simon Vance went down from the pedestal I had put him on. As a professional narrator, I‚Äôm appalled he didn‚Äôt take time to check the pronunciation of famous places in Paris, for instance.\n\nAt the beginning, I thought he was doing well, avoiding to pronounce the final consonant, as we usually do in French, but then here came Le Champ de Mars. This one is an exception, and we do pronounce the final -s here. Well, I‚Äôm tired of hearing ‚Äúle Champ de ‚Äúmarr‚Äù! Seriously, professional narrators, please do your homework.\n\nAnd worse came. He doesn‚Äôt even know how to pronounce the name of the French President Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing!\n\nBUT the book in itself is fabulous!\n\nIt‚Äôs different from Robb‚Äôs other book, in the sense that this one does not offer a systematic nor chronological history of Paris.\n\nInstead, it‚Äôs a series of (long) vignettes on important people, whose destiny is connected with Paris.\n\nI like his choice of people and how through them he highlights an aspect of Paris or another.\n\nAnd this man can write! Each chapter feels like a short novel. Brilliant rendering of facts too. Highly recommended.\n\nCURRENTLY READING / LISTENING TO\n\nHighlighting here only a couple:\n\nüìö Les dieux ont soif,\n\nby Anatole France\n\nHistorical fiction\n\n1912\n\n310 pages\n\nThe book is available in English as\n\nThe Gods Will Have Blood\n\nAm reading with French student E.\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nClick on the cover to access the English synopsis\n\nI had meant to read this historical novel on the aftermath of the French Revolution.\n\nSo far (25%), it‚Äôs not as exciting as I thought.\n\nThere‚Äôs more romance than I expected, and 1912 romance is not better than 2023! That part of the book has not aged well.\n\nBut still, I enjoy the description of characters and the settings. It‚Äôs actually a nice way to see how the French Revolution was impacting the population on a daily basis. There are a lot of little details related to that.\n\nI was considering DNFing it, but my student was interested in persevering, so I am doing. And looks like events are going to start moving.\n\n‚ÄúIt is April 1793 and the final power struggle of the French Revolution is taking hold: the aristocrats are dead and the poor are fighting for bread in the streets.\n\nIn a Paris swept by fear and hunger lives Gamelin, a revolutionary young artist appointed magistrate, and given the power of life and death over the citizens of France. But his intense idealism and unbridled single-mindedness drive him inexorably towards catastrophe.\n\nPublished in 1912, The Gods Will Have Blood is a breathtaking story of the dangers of fanaticism, with its depiction of the violence and devastation of the Reign of Terror.‚Äù\n\nüìö Continuum:\n\nFrench Science Fiction Short Stories,\n\nedited by Annabelle Dolidon with Tessa Sermet To be published by Ooligan Press\n\non April 9, 2024\n\n368 pages\n\nReceived for review, through Edelweiss\n\nReading for #ScFiMonth 2023\n\nI have read half of the stories so far, and I‚Äôm quite impressed by almost all of them.\n\nI‚Äôm also shocked I had never heard of these authors ‚Äì they are not all French, but they did in French.\n\nVery impressive collection. If you enjoy scifi, go for it, it‚Äôs on Edelweiss.\n\n‚ÄúClassic French science fiction short stories translated into English for the first time.\n\nThis unique collection of newly translated short stories offers a taste of classic and contemporary French science fiction to English-language readers. These stories cover a range of fascinating topics including simulated reality, speciesism, ecology, and transhumanism‚Äîall while exploring universal themes of belonging, death, and identity.\n\nSome of the authors featured in this anthology, like Julia Verlanger, Sylvie Denis, or Jean-Claude Dunyach, have shaped the history of French science fiction after World War II.\n\nCurated by Annabelle Dolidon and Tessa Sermet, French language and literature professors who share a love for the genre, these nine stories showcase some of the brilliant mid-to late twentieth and twenty-first century French contributions to science fiction.\n\nDolidon and Sermet provide illuminating expansions that accompany each tale and fascinating insights into the evolution of French and American science fiction. The discussion opportunities are also a wonderful resource for teachers and students of French literature and French culture as well as English and comparative literature. This anthology is a great opportunity to discover French sci-fi in English translation for fans or readers new to the genre.‚Äù\n\nüìö D‚Äôentre les morts/Sueurs froides,\n\nby Boileau-Narcejac Mystery/Noir\n\n1954\n\n192 pages\n\nReading with French student F.\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nI can‚Äôt believe I waited so many years before discovering the impressive writing duo Boileau-Narcejac ‚Äì Pierre Boileau (28 April 1906 ‚Äì 16 January 1989) and Pierre Ayraud, also known as Thomas Narcejac (3 July 1908 ‚Äì 7 June 1998).\n\nTheir bibliography is shockingly huge.\n\nMy student F. and I were so impressed by She Who Was No More, that we decided to read another right away. Like the previous, and like many other novels by the pair, the book was made into a movie: the famous Vertigo.\n\nThey renamed the book in French after the movie, hence the two titles.\n\nI so enjoy their writing. And the book has so many more layers than the movie, for instance there‚Äôs a lot about the approaching WWII, and the authors play a lot on how the main character interacts with the war and with his other life problems!\n\nI don‚Äôt think this dimension is present in the movie.\n\nüéß System Collapse (The Murderbot Diaries, #7)by Martha Wells, scifi\n\nNovember 13, 2023 245 pages / 6H36\n\nNarrated by Kevin R. Free\n\nThis series was a big 2023 discovery for me.\n\nI binged on it all, and I was excited to find the audio through my public library and Libby (though I expected it on Hoopla, where I listened to the first 6 books!)\n\nThis is a really good one, with a lot of suspense, and the same ambiance as the first book in the series.\n\nKevin R. Free is the perfect narrator for Murderbot‚Äôs character and mindset!\n\n‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs favorite lethal SecUnit is back.\n\nFollowing the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there‚Äôs an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can‚Äôt have the planet, they‚Äôre sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.\n\nBut there‚Äôs something wrong with Murderbot; it isn‚Äôt running within normal operational parameters. ART‚Äôs crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza‚Äôs SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they‚Äôre going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what‚Äôs wrong with itself, and fast.\n\nYeah, this plan is‚Ä¶ not going to work.‚Äù\n\nBOOK UP NEXT\n\nüìö 2040,\n\nby Robert Albo\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\n422 pages\n\nReceived for review\n\nChange of plans‚Ä¶\n\nI was offered this book, presented as a new ebook for January 2024. Somehow, not sure why, I didn‚Äôt seem to find it online.\n\nI finally did, AFTER I had said yes. Well, the book is already in print, and it‚Äôs over 420 pages!\n\nNot my comfort zone for a brand new to me author‚Ä¶\n\nI feel I have been tricked, but hopefully this is a great book.\n\n‚ÄúIn 2040, advanced technology has transformed daily life, yet many social ills remain.\n\nAt 40, Michael faces a choice: remain in Boston, tethered to uninspiring government programs, or forge a fresh path. Embracing the latter, he relocates to Berkeley to join his twin brother in his groundbreaking research into dark matter.\n\nCould this elusive, intangible substance, rumored to permeate the universe, also reside within the human brain, holding the key to the mysteries of consciousness?\n\nWhen an experiment goes awry, or perhaps ominously right, Michael undergoes an extraordinary transformation, emerging with newfound confidence, insatiable ambition, and an enigmatic edge. Enter Anni, a formidable Chinese power broker and trailblazer in the realm of artificial intelligence.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, a catastrophic ‚Äúsleeping sickness‚Äù sweeps across the globe, consuming the consciousness of its victims. Scientists make a chilling discovery; the origins are extraterrestrial.\n\nDelving into themes of dark matter, artificial intelligence, and the new frontier of artificial intimacy, this novel offers a stark look at the challenges and wonders that may await us in the not-so-distant future.‚Äù\n\nLAST BOOK ADDED TO MY GOODREADS TBR\n\nThe Complete Tales,\n\nby Beatrix Potter\n\nChildren\n\n1902-1930\n\n409 pages\n\nThis is the whole collection, from\n\nBook 1: The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902)\n\nto Book 23: The Tale of Little Pig Robinson (1930).\n\nüìö MAILBOX MONDAY üìö\n\nANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nI will no longer co-host MailboxMonday in 2024.
