Octavo, pp. [1-6] [1-2] 3-194, title page printed in green and black, original green cloth stamped in gold and blind. First U.S. edition. Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck (1862-1949) \"was a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist ... He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911 'in appreciation of his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the readers' own feelings and stimulate their imaginations.' The main themes in his work are death and the meaning of life. His plays form an important part of the Symbolist movement.\" In this nonfiction metaphysical work Maeterlinck advances his theory that beings whose excess dimensions render them invisible to us, come from hyper-space to mingle in our atmosphere and exert an occult influence on our life and death. A fine copy in very good pictorial dust jacket (priced $2.50 on the front flap) with closed tears and shallow chipping along top and bottom edges. (#159146).\n\nPrice: $100.00"
