It has been specially written for the Christmas revival of The Blue Bird at the Haymarket Theatre, where it will take the place of the Forest Scene (Act III., Scene 2). In the printed version, however, the Forest Scene is retained; and in this and all later editions the play will consist of six acts instead of five.\n\nALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS. CHELSEA, 14 November, 1910.\n\nCOSTUMES\n\nTYLTYL wears the dress of Hop o' my Thumb in Perrault's Tales. Scarlet knickerbockers, pale-blue jacket, white stockings, tan shoes.\n\nMYTYL is dressed like Gretel or Little Red Riding-hood.\n\nLIGHT.—The moon-coloured dress in Perrault's Peau d'âne; that is to say, pale gold shot with silver, shimmering gauzes, forming a sort of rays, etc. Neo-Grecian or Anglo-Grecian (à la Walter Crane) or even more or less Empire style: a high waist, bare arms, etc. Head-dress: a sort of diadem or even a light crown.\n\nTHE FAIRY BÉRYLUNE and NEIGHBOUR BERLINGOT.—The traditional dress of the poor women in fairy-tales. If desired, the transformation of the Fairy into a princess in Act I may be omitted.\n\nDADDY TYL, MUMMY TYL, GAFFER TYL and GRANNY TYL.—The traditional costume of the German wood-cutters and peasants in Grimm's Tales.\n\nTYLTYL'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS.—Different forms of the Hop-o'-my-Thumb costume.\n\nTIME.—Traditional dress of Time: a wide black or dark-blue cloak, a streaming white beard, scythe and hour-glass.\n\nNIGHT.—Ample black garments, covered with mysterious stars and shot with reddish-brown reflections. Veils, dark poppies, etc.\n\nTHE NEIGHBOUR'S LITTLE GIRL.—Bright fair hair; a long white frock.\n\nTHE DOG,—Red dress-coat, white breeches, top-boots, a shiny hat. The costume suggests that of John Bull.\n\nTHE CAT.—The costume of Puss In Boots: powdered wig, three-cornered hat, violet or sky-blue coat, dress-sword, etc.\n\nN.B.—The heads of the DOG and the CAT should be only discreetly animalised.\n\nTHE LUXURIES.—Before the transformation: wide, heavy mantles in red and yellow brocade; enormous fat jewels, etc. After the transformation: chocolate or coffee-coloured tights, giving the impression of unadorned dancing-jacks.\n\nTHE HAPPINESSES OF THE HOME.—Dresses of various colours, or, if preferred, costumes of peasants, shepherds, wood-cutters and so on, but idealised and interpreted fairy-fashion.\n\nTHE GREAT JOYS.—As stated in the text, shimmering dresses in soft and subtle shades: rose-awakening, water's-smile, amber-dew, blue-of-dawn, etc.\n\nMATERNAL LOVE.—Dress very similar to the dress worn by Light, that is to say, supple and almost transparent veils, as of a Greek statue, and, in so far as possible, white. Pearls and other stones as rich and numerous as may be desired, provided that they do not break the pure and candid harmony of the whole.\n\nBREAD.—A rich pasha's dress. An ample crimson silk or velvet gown. A huge turban. A scimitar. An enormous stomach, red and puffed-out cheeks.\n\nSUGAR.—A silk gown, cut like that of a eunuch in a seraglio, half blue and half white, to suggest the paper wrapper of a sugar-loaf. Eunuch's headdress.\n\nFIRE.—Red tights, a vermilion cloak, with changing reflections, lined with gold. An aigrette of iridescent flames.\n\nWATER.—A pale-blue or bluish-green dress, with transparent reflections and effects of rippling or trickling gauze, Neo-Grecian or Anglo-Grecian style. but fuller and more voluminous than that of LIGHT. Head-dress of aquatic flowers and seaweed.\n\nTHE ANIMALS.—Popular or peasant costumes.\n\nTHE TREES.—Dresses of different shades of green or the colour of the trunks of trees. Distinctive attributes in the shape of leaves or branches by which they can be recognised.\n\nACT I. The Wood-cutter's Cottage\n\nThe stage represents the interior of a wood-cutter's cottage, simple and rustic in appearance, but in no way poverty-stricken. A recessed fireplace containing the dying embers of a wood-fire. Kitchen utensils, a cupboard, a bread-pan, a grandfather's clock, a spinning-wheel, a water-tap, etc. On a table, a lighted lamp. At the foot of the cupboard, on either side, a DOG and a CAT lie sleeping, rolled up, each with his nose in his tail. Between them stands a large blue-and-white sugar-loaf. On the wall hangs a round cage containing a turtle-dove. At the back, two windows, with closed inside shutters. Under one of the windows, a stool. On the left is the front door, with a big latch to it. On the right, another door. A ladder leads up to a loft. On the right also are two little children's cots, at the head of which are two chains, with clothes carefully folded on them. When the curtain rises, TYLTYL and MYTYL are sound asleep in their cots, MUMMY TYL tucks them in, leans over them, watches them for a moment as they sleep and beckons to DADDY TYL, who thrusts his head through the half-open door. MUMMY TYL lays a finger on her lips, to impose silence upon him, and then goes out to the right, on tiptoe, after first putting out the lamp. The scene remains in darkness for a moment. Then a light, gradually increasing in intensity, filters in through the shutters. The lamp on the table lights again of itself, but its light is of a different colour than when MUMMY TYL extinguished it. The two CHILDREN appear to wake and sit up in bed.\n\nTYLTYL Mytyl?\n\nMYTYL Tyltyl?\n\nTYLTYL Are you asleep?\n\nMYTYL Are you?...\n\nTYLTYL No; how can I be asleep when I'm talking to you?\n\nMYTYL Say, is this Christmas Day?...\n\nTYLTYL Not yet; not till to-morrow. But Father Christmas won't bring us anything this year....\n\nMYTYL Why not?\n\nTYLTYL I heard mummy say that she couldn't go to town to tell him ... But he will come next year....\n\nMYTYL Is next year far off?...\n\nTYLTYL A good long while.... But he will come to the rich children to-night....\n\nMYTYL Really?...\n\nTYLTYL Hullo!... Mummy's forgotten to put out the lamp!... I've an idea!...\n\nMYTYL What?...\n\nTYLTYL Let's get up....\n\nMYTYL But we mustn't....\n\nTYLTYL Why, there's no one about.... Do you see the shutters?...\n\nMYTYL Oh, how bright they are!...\n\nTYLTYL It's the lights of the party.\n\nMYTYL What party?...\n\nTYLTYL The rich children opposite. It's the Christmas-tree. Let's open the shutters....\n\nMYTYL Can we?...\n\nTYLTYL Of course; there's no one to stop us.... Do you hear the music?... Let us get up....\n\n(The two CHILDREN get up, run to one of the windows, climb on to the stool and throw back the shutters. A bright light fills the room. The CHILDREN look out greedily.)\n\nTYLTYL We can see everything!...\n\nMYTYL (who can hardly find room on the stool) I can't....\n\nTYLTYL It's snowing!... There's two carriages, with six horses each!...\n\nMYTYL There are twelve little boys getting out!...\n\nTYLTYL How silly you are!... They're little girls....\n\nMYTYL They've got knickerbockers....\n\nTYLTYL What do you know?... Don't push so!...\n\nMYTYL I never touched you.\n\nTYLTYL (who is taking up the whole stool) You're taking up all the room...\n\nMYTYL Why, I have no room at all!...\n\nTYLTYL Do be quiet! I see the tree!...\n\nMYTYL What tree?...\n\nTYLTYL Why, the Christmas-tree!... You're looking at the wall!...\n\nMYTYL I'm looking at the wall because I've got no room....\n\nTYLTYL (giving her a miserly little place on the stool) There!... Will that do?... Now you're better off than I!... I say, what lots and lots of lights!...\n\nMYTYL What are those people doing who are making such a noise?...\n\nTYLTYL They're the musicians.\n\nMYTYL Are they angry?...\n\nTYLTYL No; but it's hard work.\n\nMYTYL Another carriage with white horses!...\n\nTYLTYL Be quiet!... And look!...\n\nMYTYL What are those gold things there, hanging from the branches?\n\nTYLTYL Why, toys, to be sure!... Swords, guns, soldiers, cannons....\n\nMYTYL And dolls; say, are there any dolls?...\n\nTYLTYL Dolls?... That's too silly; there's no fun in dolls....\n\nMYTYL And what's that all round the table?....\n\nTYLTYL Cakes and fruit and tarts....\n\nMYTYL I had some once when I was little....\n\nTYLTYL So did I; it's nicer than bread, but they don't give you enough....\n\nMYTYL They've got plenty over there.... The whole table's full.... Are they going to eat them?...\n\nTYLTYL Of course; what else would they do with them?...\n\nMYTYL Why don't they eat them at once?...\n\nTYLTYL Because they're not hungry....\n\nMYTYL (stupefied with astonishment) Not hungry?... Why not?...\n\nTYLTYL Well, they eat whenever they want to....\n\nMYTYL (incredulously) Every day?...\n\nTYLTYL They say so....\n\nMYTYL Will they eat them all?... Will they give any away?...\n\nTYLTYL To whom?...\n\nMYTYL To us....\n\nTYLTYL They don't know us....\n\nMYTYL Suppose we asked them....\n\nTYLTYL We mustn't.\n\nMYTYL Why not?...\n\nTYLTYL Because it's not right.\n\nMYTYL (clapping her hands) Oh, how pretty they are!...\n\nTYLTYL (rapturously) And how they're laughing and laughing!...\n\nMYTYL And the little ones dancing!...\n\nTYLTYL Yes, yes; let's dance too!... (They stamp their feet for joy on the stool.)\n\nMYTYL Oh, what fun!...\n\nTYLTYL They're getting the cakes!... They can touch them!... They're eating, they're eating, they're eating!...\n\nMYTYL The tiny ones, too!... They've got two, three, four apiece!...\n\nTYLTYL (drunk with delight) Oh, how lovely!... Oh, how lovely, how lovely!...\n\nMYTYL (counting imaginary cakes) I've got twelve!...\n\nTYLTYL And I four times twelve!... But I'll give you some....\n\n(A knock at the door of the cottage.)\n\nTYLTYL (suddenly quieted and frightened) What's that?...\n\nMYTYL (scared) It's Daddy!...\n\n(As they hesitate before opening the door, the big latch is seen to rise of itself, with a grating noise; the door half opens to admit a little old woman dressed in green with a red hood on her head. She is humpbacked and lame and near-sighted; her nose and chin meet; and she walks bent on a stick. She is obviously a fairy.)\n\nTHE FAIRY Have you the grass here that sings or the bird that is blue?...\n\nTYLTYL We have some grass, but it can't sing....\n\nMYTYL Tyltyl has a bird.\n\nTYLTYL But I can't give it away....\n\nTHE FAIRY Why not?...\n\nTYLTYL Because it's mine.\n\nTHE FAIRY That's a reason, no doubt. Where is the bird?...\n\nTYLTYL (pointing to the cage) In the cage....\n\nTHE FAIRY (putting on her glasses to examine the bird) I don't want it; it's not blue enough. You will have to go and find me the one I want.\n\nTYLTYL But I don't know where it is....\n\nTHE FAIRY No more do I. That's why you must look for it. I can do without the grass that sings, at a pinch; but I must absolutely have the blue bird. It's for my little girl, who is very ill.\n\nTYLTYL What's the matter with her?...\n\nTHE FAIRY We don't quite know; she wants to be happy....\n\nTYLTYL Really?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Do you know who I am?...\n\nTYLTYL You're rather like our neighbour, Madame Berlingot....\n\nTHE FAIRY (growing suddenly angry) Not a bit!... There's not the least likeness!... This is intolerable!... I am the Fairy Bérylune....\n\nTYLTYL Oh! Very well....\n\nTHE FAIRY You will have to start at once.\n\nTYLTYL Are you coming with us?\n\nTHE FAIRY I can't, because I put on the soup this morning and it always boils over if I leave it for more than an hour.... (Pointing successively to the ceiling, the chimney and the window) Will you go out this way, or that way, or that way?...\n\nTYLTYL (pointing timidly to the door) I would rather go out that way....\n\nTHE FAIRY (growing suddenly angry again) That's quite impossible; and it's a shocking habit!... (Pointing to the window) We'll go out this way.... Well?... What are you waiting for?... Get dressed at once.... (The CHILDREN do as they are told and dress quickly.) I'll help Mytyl....\n\nTYLTYL We have no shoes....\n\nTHE FAIRY That doesn't matter. I will give you a little magic hat. Where are your father and mother?....\n\nTYLTYL (pointing to the door on the right) They're asleep in there....\n\nTHE FAIRY And your grandpapa and grandmamma?...\n\nTYLTYL They're dead....\n\nTHE FAIRY And your little brothers and sisters.... Have you any?...\n\nTYLTYL Oh, yes; three little brothers....\n\nMYTYL And four little sisters....\n\nTHE FAIRY Where are they?...\n\nTYLTYL They are dead, too....\n\nTHE FAIRY Would you like to see them again?...\n\nTYLTYL Oh, yes!... At once!... Show them to us!...\n\nTHE FAIRY I haven't got them in my pocket.... But this is very lucky; you will see them when you go through the Land of Memory.... It's on the way to the Blue Bird, just on the left, past the third turning.... What were you doing when I knocked?...\n\nTYLTYL We were playing at eating cakes?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Have you any cakes?... Where are they?...\n\nTYLTYL In the house of the rich children.... Come and look, it's so lovely. (He drags the FAIRY to the window.)\n\nTHE FAIRY (at the window) But it's the others who are eating them!...\n\nTYLTYL Yes; but we can see them eat....\n\nTHE FAIRY Aren't you cross with them?...\n\nTYLTYL What for?...\n\nTHE FAIRY For eating all the cakes.... I think it's very wrong of them not to give you some....\n\nTYLTYL Not at all; they're rich.... I say, isn't it beautiful over there?...\n\nTHE FAIRY It's no more beautiful there than here.\n\nTYLTYL Ugh!... It's darker here and smaller and there are no cakes....\n\nTHE FAIRY It's exactly the same, only you can't see....\n\nTYLTYL Yes, I can; and I have very good eyes. I can see the time on the church clock and daddy can't...\n\nTHE FAIRY (suddenly angry) I tell you that you can't see!... How do you see me?... What do I look like?... (An awkward silence from TYLTYL.) Well, answer me, will you? I want to know if you can see!... Am I pretty or ugly?... (The silence grows more and more uncomfortable.) Won't you answer?... Am I young or old?... Are my cheeks pink or yellow?... Perhaps you'll say I have a hump?...\n\nTYLTYL (in a conciliatory tone) No, no; It's not a big one....\n\nTHE FAIRY Oh, yes, to look at you, any one would think it enormous.... Have I a hook nose and have I lost one of my eyes?...\n\nTYLTYL Oh, no, I don't say that.... Who put it out?...\n\nTHE FAIRY (growing more and more irritated). But it's not out!... You wretched, impudent boy!... It's much finer than the other; it's bigger and brighter and blue as the sky.... And my hair, do you see that?... It's fair as the corn in the fields, it's like virgin gold!... And I've such heaps and heaps of it that it weighs my head down.... It escapes on every side.... Do you see it on my hands? (She holds out two lean wisps of grey hair.)\n\nTYLTYL Yes, I see a little....\n\nTHE FAIRY (indignantly) A little!... Sheaves! Armfuls! Clusters! Waves of gold!... I know there are people who say that they don't see any; but you're not one of those wicked, blind people, I should hope?...\n\nTYLTYL Oh, no; I can see all that isn't hidden....\n\nTHE FAIRY But you ought to see the rest with as little doubt!... Human beings are very odd!... Since the death of the fairies, they see nothing at all and they never suspect it.... Luckily, I always carry with me all that is wanted to give new light to dimmed eyes.... What am I taking out of my bag?...\n\nTYLTYL Oh, what a dear little green hat!... What's that shining in the cockade?...\n\nTHE FAIRY That's the big diamond that makes people see....\n\nTYLTYL Really?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Yes; when you've got the hat on your head, you turn the diamond a little; from right to left, for instance, like this; do you see?... Then it presses a bump which nobody knows of and which opens your eyes....\n\nTYLTYL Doesn't it hurt?...\n\nTHE FAIRY On the contrary, it's enchanted.... You at once see even the inside of things: the soul of bread, of wine, of pepper, for instance....\n\nMYTYL Can you see the soul of sugar, too?...\n\nTHE FAIRY (suddenly cross) Of course you can!... I hate unnecessary questions.... The soul of sugar is no more interesting than the soul of pepper.... There, I give you all I have to help you in your search for the Blue Bird. I know that the flying carpet or the ring which makes its wearer invisible would be more useful to you.... But I have lost the key of the cupboard in which I locked them.... Oh, I was almost forgetting!... (Pointing to the diamond) When you hold it like this, do you see?... One little turn more and you behold the past.... Another little turn and you behold the future.... It's curious and practical and it's quite noiseless....\n\nTYLTYL Daddy will take it from me....\n\nTHE FAIRY He won't see it; no one can see it as long as it's on your head.... Will you try it?... (She puts the little green hat on TYLTYL'S head.) Now, turn the diamond.... One turn and then....\n\n(TYLTYL has no sooner turned the diamond than a sudden and wonderful change comes over everything. The old FAIRY alters then and there into a princess of marvellous beauty; the flints of which the cottage walls are built light up, turn blue as sapphires, become transparent and gleam and sparkle like the most precious stones. The humble furniture takes life and becomes resplendent; the deal table assumes as grave and noble an air as a table made of marble; the face of the clock winks its eye and smiles genially, while the door that contains the pendulum opens and releases the Hours, which, holding one another by the hand and laughing merrily, begin to dance to the sound of delicious music.)\n\nTYLTYL (displaying a legitimate bewilderment and pointing to the Hours) Who are all those pretty ladies?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Don't be afraid; they are the hours of your life and they are glad to be free and visible for a moment....\n\nTYLTYL And why are the walls so bright?... Are they made of sugar or of precious stones?...\n\nTHE FAIRY All stones are alike, all stones are precious; but man sees only a few of them....\n\n(While they are speaking, the scene of enchantment continues and is completed. The souls of the Quartern-loaves, in the form of little men in crust-coloured tights, flurried and all powdered with flour, scramble out of the bread-pan and frisk round the table, where they are caught up by FIRE, who, springing from the hearth in yellow and vermilion tights, writhes with laughter as he chases the loaves.)\n\nTYLTYL Who are those ugly little men?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Oh, they're nothing; they are merely the souls of the Quartern-loaves, who are taking advantage of the reign of truth to leave the pan in which they were too tightly packed....\n\nTYLTYL And the big red fellow, with the nasty smell?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Hush!... Don't speak too loud; that's Fire.... He's dangerous. (This dialogue does not interrupt the enchantment. The DOG and the CAT, lying rolled up at the foot of the cupboard, utter a loud and simultaneous cry and disappear down a trap; and in their places rise two persons, one of whom has the face of a bull-dog, the other that of a tom-cat. Forthwith, the little man with the bull-dog face, whom we will henceforward call the DOG, rushes upon TYLTYL, kisses him violently and overwhelms him with noisy and impetuous caresses; while the little man with the face of a tom-cat, whom we will simply call the CAT, combs his hair, washes his hands and strokes his whiskers before going up to MYTYL.)\n\nTHE DOG (yelling, jumping about, knocking up against everything, unbearable) My little god!... Good-morning, good-morning, my dear little god!... At last, at last we can talk!... I had so much to tell you!... Bark and wag my tail as I might, you never understood!... But now!... Good-morning, good-morning!... I love you!... Shall I do some of my tricks?... Shall I beg?... Would you like to see me walk on my front paws or dance on my hind-legs?...\n\nTYLTYL (to the FAIRY) Who is this gentleman with the dog's head?....\n\nTHE FAIRY Don't you see? It's the soul of TYLÔ whom you have set free....\n\nTHE CAT (going up to MYTYL and putting out his hand to her, with much ceremony and circumspection) Good-morning, Miss.... How well you look this morning!...\n\nMYTYL Good-morning, sir.... (To the FAIRY) Who is it?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Why, don't you see? Its the soul of Tylette offering you his hand.... Kiss him....\n\nTHE DOG (hustling the CAT) Me, too!... I've kissed the little god!... I've kissed the little girl!... I've kissed everybody!... Oh, grand!... What fun we shall have!... I'm going to frighten Tylette I Bow, wow, wow!...\n\nTHE CAT Sir, I don't know you....\n\nTHE FAIRY (threatening the DOG with her stick) Keep still, will you, or else you'll go back into silence until the end of time....\n\n(Meanwhile, the enchantment has pursued its course: the spinning-wheel has begun to turn madly in its corner and to spin brilliant rays of light; the tap, in another corner, begins to sing in a very high voice and, turning into a luminous fountain, floods the sink with sheets of pearls and emeralds, through which darts the soul of WATER, like a young girl, streaming, dishevelled and tearful, who immediately begins to fight with FIRE.)\n\nTYLTYL And who is that wet lady?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Don't be afraid. It's Water just come from the tap....\n\n(The milk-jug upsets, falls from the table and smashes on the floor; and from the spilt milk there rises a tall, white, bashful figure who seems to be afraid of everything.)\n\nTYLTYL And the frightened lady in her nightgown?...\n\nTHE FAIRY That's Milk; she has broken her jug....\n\n(The sugar-loaf, at the foot of the cupboard, grows taller and wider and splits its paper wrapper, whence issues a mawkish and hypocritical being, dressed in a long coat half blue and half white, who goes up to MYTYL with a sanctimonious smile.)\n\nMYTYL (greatly alarmed) What does he want?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Why, he is the soul of Sugar!...\n\nMYTYL (reassured) Has he any barley-sugar?...\n\nTHE FAIRY His pockets are full of it and each of his fingers is a sugar-stick....\n\n(The lamp falls from the table and, at the same moment, its flame springs up again and turns into a luminous maid of incomparable beauty. She is dressed in long transparent and dazzling veils and stands motionless in a sort of ecstasy.)\n\nTYLTYL It's the Queen!...\n\nMYTYL It's the Blessed Virgin!...\n\nTHE FAIRY No, my children; it's Light....\n\n(Meanwhile, the saucepans on the shelves spin round like tops; the linen-press throws open its folding-doors and unrolls a magnificent display of moon-coloured and sun-coloured stuffs, with which mingles a no less splendid array of rags and tatters that come down the ladder from the loft. But, suddenly, three loud knocks are heard on the door at the right.)\n\nTYLTYL (alarmed) That's daddy!... He's heard us!...\n\nTHE FAIRY Turn the diamond!... From left to right!...\n\n(TYLTYL turns the diamond quickly.) Not so quick!... Heavens! It's too late!... You turned it too briskly; they will not have time to resume their places and we shall have a lot of annoyance....\n\n(The FAIRY becomes an old woman again, the walls of the cottage lose their splendour. The Hours go back into the clock, the spinning-wheel stops, etc. But, in the general hurry and confusion, while FIRE runs madly round the room, looking for the chimney, one of the loaves of bread, who has been unable to squeeze into the pan, bursts into sobs and utters roars of fright.)\n\nTHE FAIRY What's the matter?...\n\nBREAD (in tears) There's no room in the pan!...\n\nTHE FAIRY (stooping over the pan) Yes, there is; yes, there is.... (Pushing the other loaves, which have resumed their original places.) Come, quick, make room there....\n\n(The knocking at the door is renewed.)\n\nBREAD (utterly scared, vainly struggling to enter the pan) I can't get in!... He'll eat me first!...\n\nTHE DOG (frisking round TYLTYL) My little god!... I am still here!... I can still talk!... I can still kiss you!... Once more! Once more! Once more!...\n\nTHE FAIRY What, you too?... Are you there still?...\n\nTHE DOG What luck!... I was too late to return to silence; the trap closed too quickly....\n\nTHE CAT So did mine.... What is going to happen?... Is there any danger?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Well, I'm bound to tell you the truth: all those who accompany the two children will die at the end of the journey....\n\nTHE CAT (to the DOG) Come, let us get back into the trap....\n\nTHE DOG No, no!... I won't!... I want to go with the little god!... I want to talk to him all the time!...\n\nTHE CAT Idiot!...\n\n(More knocking at the door)\n\nBREAD (shedding bitter tears) I don't want to die at the end of the journey!... I want to get back at once into my pan!...\n\nFIRE (who has done nothing but run madly round the room, hissing with anguish) I can't find my chimney!...\n\nWATER (vainly trying to get into the tap) I can't get into the tap!...\n\nSUGAR (hovering round his paper wrapper) I've burst my packing-paper!...\n\nMILK (lymphatically and bashfully) Somebody's broken my little jug!...\n\nTHE FAIRY Goodness me, what fools they are!... Fools and cowards too!... So you would rather go on living in your ugly boxes, in your traps and taps, than accompany the children in search of the bird?...\n\nALL (excepting the DOG and LIGHT) Yes, yes! Now, at once!... My tap!... My pan!... My chimney!... My trap!...\n\nTHE FAIRY (to LIGHT, who is dreamily gazing at the wreckage of her lamp) And you, Light, what do you say?\n\nLIGHT I will go with the children....\n\nTHE DOG (yelling with delight) I too!... I too!...\n\nTHE FAIRY That's right.... Besides, it's too late to go back; you have no choice now, you must all start with us.... But you, Fire, don't come near anybody; you, Dog, don't tease the Cat; and you, Water, hold yourself up and try not to run all over the place....\n\n(A violent knocking is again heard at the door on the right.)\n\nTYLTYL (listening) There's daddy again!... He's getting up this time; I can hear him walking....\n\nTHE FAIRY Let us go out by the window.... You shall all come to my house, where I will dress the Animals and the Things properly.... (To BREAD) You, Bread, take the cage in which to put the Blue Bird.... It will be in your charge.... Quick, quick, let us waste no time....\n\n(The window suddenly lengthens downwards, like a door. They all go out; after which the window resumes its primitive shape and closes quite innocently. The room has become dark again and the two cots are steeped in shadow. The door on the right opens ajar and in the aperture appear the heads of DADDY and MUMMY TYL.)\n\nDADDY TYL It was nothing.... It's the cricket chirping....\n\nMUMMY TYL Can you see them?...\n\nDADDY TYL I can.... They are sleeping quite quietly....\n\nMUMMY TYL I can hear their breathing....\n\n(The door closes again)\n\nCURTAIN\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I.—At the FAIRY'S.\n\nA magnificent entrance-hall in the palace of the FAIRY BÉRYLUNE. Columns of gleaming marble with gold and silver capitals, staircases, porticoes, balustrades, etc.\n\nEnter from the back, on the right, sumptuously clad, the CAT, SUGAR and FIRE. They come from a room which emits rays of light; it is the FAIRY'S wardrobe. The CAT has donned the classic costume of Puss-in-boots; SUGAR, a silk dress, half white and half pale-blue; and FIRE wears a number of many-coloured aigrettes and a long vermilion mantle lined with gold. They cross the whole length of the hall to the front of the stage, where the CAT draws them up under a portico on the right.\n\nTHE CAT This way, I know every inch of this palace. It was left to the Fairy Bérylune by Bluebeard.... Let us make the most of our last minute of liberty, while the children and Light pay their visit to the Fairy's little daughter.... I have brought you here in order to discuss the position in which we are placed.... Are we all here?...\n\nSUGAR I see the Dog coming out of the Fairy's wardrobe....\n\nFIRE What on earth has he got on?...\n\nTHE CAT He has put on the livery of one of the footmen of Cinderella's coach.... It was just the thing for him.... He has the soul of a flunkey.... But let us hide behind the balustrade.... It's strange how I mistrust him.... He had better not hear what I have to say to you....\n\nSUGAR It is too late.... He has discovered us.... Look, here is Water also coming out of the wardrobe.... Goodness me, how fine she is!...\n\n(The DOG and WATER join the first group.)\n\nTHE DOG (frisking about) There! There!... Aren't we fine I.... Just look at these laces and this embroidery!... It's real gold and no mistake!...\n\nTHE CAT (to WATER) Is that Catskin's colour-of-time dress?... I seem to recognise it....\n\nWATER Yes, it's the one that suited me best....\n\nFIRE (between his teeth) She's not brought her umbrella....\n\nWATER What's that?...\n\nFIRE Nothing, nothing....\n\nWATER I thought you might be speaking of a great red I saw the other day....\n\nTHE CAT Come, don't let as quarrel; we have more important things to do.... We are only waiting for Bread; where is he?\n\nTHE DOG He was making an endless fuss about choosing his dress....\n\nFIRE Worth while, isn't it, for a fellow who looks a fool and carries an enormous stomach?...\n\nTHE DOG At last, he decided in favour of a Turkish robe, adorned with gems, a scimitar and a turban....\n\nTHE CAT There he is!... He has put on Bluebeard's finest dress...\n\nEnter BREAD, in the costume described above. The silk robe is crossed tightly over his huge stomach. In one hand he holds the hilt of a scimitar passed through his sash and in the other the cage intended for the Blue Bird.\n\nBREAD (waddling conceitedly) Well?... What do you think of this?\n\nTHE DOG (frisking round the LOAF) How nice he looks! What a fool he looks! How nice he looks! How nice he looks!...\n\nTHE CAT (to the LOAF) Are the children dressed?...\n\nBREAD Yes, Master Tyltyl has put on Hop-o'-my-Thumb's blue jacket and red breeches; and Miss Mytyl has Gretel's frock and Cinderella's slippers.... But the great thing was the dressing of Light!...\n\nTHE CAT Why?...\n\nBREAD The Fairy thought her so lovely that she did not want to dress her at all!... Thereupon I protested in the name of our dignity as essential and eminently respectable elements; and I ended by declaring that, under those conditions, I should refuse to be seen with her....\n\nFIRE They ought to have bought her a lampshade!...\n\nTHE CAT And what answer did the Fairy make?...\n\nTHE LOAF She hit me with her stick on my head and stomach....\n\nTHE CAT And then?...\n\nBREAD I allowed myself to be convinced; but, at the last moment, Light decided on the moonbeam dress at the bottom of the chest with Catskin's treasures....\n\nTHE CAT Come, stop chattering, time presses.... Our future is at stake.... You have heard—the Fairy has just said so—that the end of this journey will, at the same time, mark the end of our lives.... It is our business, therefore, to prolong it as much as possible and by every possible means.... But there is another thing: we must think of the fate of our race and the destiny of our children....\n\nBREAD Hear, hear!... The Cat is right!...\n\nTHE CAT Listen to me!... All of us here present, Animals, Things and Elements, possess a soul which man does not yet know. That is why we retain a remnant of independence; but, if he finds the Blue Bird, he will know all, he will see all and we shall be completely at his mercy.... This is what I have just learned from my old friend, Night, who is also the guardian of the mysteries of Life.... It is to our interest, therefore, at all costs to prevent the finding of that bird, even if we have to go so far as to endanger the lives of the children themselves....\n\nTHE DOG (indignantly) What's the fellow saying?... Just say that again, will you, to see if I heard right?...\n\nBREAD Order! Order!... It's not your turn to speak!... I'm in the chair at this meeting....\n\nFIRE Who made you chairman?...\n\nWATER (to FIRE) Hold your tongue!... What are you interfering with?...\n\nFIRE I shall interfere where I choose.... And I want none of your remarks....\n\nSUGAR (concilatorily) Excuse me.... Do not let us quarrel.... This is a serious moment.... We must, above all things, decide what measures to adopt....\n\nBREAD I quite agree with Sugar and the Cat....\n\nTHE DOG This is ridiculous!... There is Man and that's all!... We have to obey him and do as he tells us!... That is the one and only fact!... I recognise no one but him!... Hurrah for Man!... Man for ever!... In life or death, all for Man!... Man is God!...\n\nBREAD I quite agree with the Dog.\n\nTHE CAT (to the DOG) But at least give your reasons....\n\nTHE DOG There are no reasons!... I love Man and that's enough!... If you do anything against him, I will throttle you first and I will go and tell him everything....\n\nSUGAR (intervening sweetly) Excuse me.... Let us not embitter the discussion.... From a certain point of view, you are both of you right.... There is something to be said on both sides....\n\nBREAD I quite agree with SUGAR!...\n\nTHE CAT Are we not, all of us, Water, Fire you yourselves, Bread and the Dog, the victims of a nameless tyranny?... Do you remember the time when, before the coming of the despot, we wandered at liberty upon the face of the earth?... Fire and Water were the sole masters of the world; and see what they have come to!... As for us puny descendants of the great wild animals.... Look out!... Pretend to be doing nothing!... I see the Fairy and Light coming.... Light has taken sides with Man; she is our worst enemy.... Here they are....\n\nEnter, on the right, the FAIRY, in the shape of an old woman, and LIGHT, followed by TYLTYL and MYTYL.\n\nTHE FAIRY Well?... What is it?... What are you doing in that corner?... You look like conspirators.... It is time to start.... I have decided that Light shall be your leader.... You will obey her as you would me and I am giving her my wand.... The children will pay a visit to their late grandparents this evening.... You will remain behind; that is more discreet.... They will spend the evening in the bosom of their dead family.... Meanwhile, you will be getting ready all that is wanted for to-morrow's journey, which will be a long one.... Come, up, be off and every one to his post!...\n\nTHE CAT (hypocritically) That is just what I was saying to them, madam.... I was encouraging them to do their duty bravely and conscientiously; unfortunately, the Dog, who kept on interrupting me....\n\nTHE DOG What's that?... Just wait a bit I...\n\n(He is about to leap upon the CAT, but TYLTYL foreseeing his intention, stops with a threatening gesture.)\n\nTYLTYL Down, Tylô!... Take care; and, if ever I catch you again...\n\nTHE DOG My little god, you don't know, it was he who...\n\nTYLTYL (threatening him) Be quiet!...\n\nTHE FAIRY Come, that will do.... Let Bread hand the cage for this evening to Tyltyl.... It is just possible that the Blue Bird may be hidden In the Past, at the grandparents'.... In any case, it Is a chance which we must not neglect.... Well, Bread, the cage?\n\nBREAD (solemnly) One moment, if you please, Mrs. Fairy.... (Like an orator making a speech) I call upon all of you to bear witness that this silver cage, which was entrusted to my care by....\n\nTHE FAIRY (interrupting him) Enough!... No speeches!... We will go out this way and the children that....\n\nTYLTYL (rather anxiously) Are we to go all alone?...\n\nMYTYL I feel hungry!...\n\nTYLTYL I, too!...\n\nTHE FAIRY (to BREAD) Open your Turkish robe and give them a slice of your good stomach....\n\n(BREAD opens his robe, draws his scimitar and cuts two slices out of his stomach and hands them to the CHILDREN.)\n\nSUGAR (approaching the CHILDREN) Allow me at the same time to offer you a few sugar-sticks.... (He breaks off the five fingers of his left hand, one by one, and presents them to the CHILDREN.)\n\nMYTYL What is he doing?... He is breaking all his fingers!...\n\nSUGAR (engagingly) Taste them, they are capital... They're made of real barley-sugar....\n\nMYTYL (tasting one of the fingers) Oh, how good they are!... Have you many of them?...\n\nSUGAR (modestly) Yes; as many as I want....\n\nMYTYL Does that hurt you much, when you break them off?...\n\nSUGAR Not at all.... On the contrary, it's a great advantage; they grow again at once and so I always have new, clean fingers....\n\nTHE FAIRY Come, children, don't eat too much sugar.... Don't forget that you are to have supper presently with your grandpapa and grandmamma....\n\nTYLTYL Are they here?...\n\nTHE FAIRY You shall see them at once....\n\nTYLTYL How can we see them, when they are dead?...\n\nTHE FAIRY How can they be dead, when they live in your memory?... Men do not know this secret, because they know so little; whereas you, thanks to the diamond, are about to see that the dead who are remembered live as happily as though they were not dead....\n\nTYLTYL Is Light coming with us?\n\nTHE FAIRY No, it is more proper that this visit should be confined to the family.... I will wait near here, so as not to appear indiscreet.... They did not invite me....\n\nTYLTYL Which way are we to go?...\n\nTHE FAIRY Over there.... You are on the threshold of the Land of Memory.... As soon as you have turned the diamond, you will see a big tree with a board on it, which will show you that you are there.... But don't forget that you are to be back, both of you, by a quarter to nine.... It is extremely important.... Now mind and be punctual, for all would be lost if you were late.... Good-bye for the present!... (Calling the CAT, the DOG, LIGHT, etc.) This way.... And the little ones that way....\n\n(She goes out to the right, with LIGHT, the ANIMALS, etc., while the CHILDREN go out to the left.)\n\nCURTAIN\n\nSCENE 2.—The Land of Memory.\n\nA thick fog, from which stands out, on the right, close to the footlights, the trunk of a large oak, with a board nailed to it. A vague, milky, impenetrable light prevails. TYLTYL and MYTYL are at the foot of the oak.\n\nTYLTYL Here Is the tree!...\n\nMYTYL There's the board!...\n\nTYLTYL I can't read it.... Wait, I will climb up on this root.... That's it.... It says, Land of Memory.\n\nMYTYL Is this where it begins?...\n\nTYLTYL Yes, there's an arrow....\n\nMYTYL Well, where are grandad and granny?...\n\nTYLTYL Behind the fog.... We shall see....\n\nMYTYL I can see nothing at all!... I can't see my feet or my hands.... (Whimpering) I'm cold!... I don't want to travel any more.... I want to go home....\n\nTYLTYL Come, don't keep on crying, just like Water.... You ought to be ashamed of yourself.... A great big little girl like you.... Look, the fog is lifting already.... We shall see what's behind it....\n\n(The mist begins to move; It grows thinner and lighter, disperses, evaporates. Soon, in a more and more transparent light, appears, under a leafy vault, a cheerful little peasant's cottage, covered with creepers. The door and windows are open. There are bee-hives under a shed, flower-pots on the window-sills, a cage with a sleeping blackbird. Beside the door is a bench, on which an old peasant and his wife, TYLTYL'S grandfather and grandmother, are seated, both sound asleep.)\n\nTYLTYL (suddenly recognising them) It's grandad and granny!...\n\nMYTYL (clapping her hands) Yes! Yes!... So it is! So it is!...\n\nTYLTYL (still a little distrustful) Take care!... We don't know yet if they can stir.... Let's keep behind the tree....\n\n(GRANNY TYL opens her eyes, raises her head, stretches herself, gives a sigh and looks at GAFFER TYL, who also wakes slowly from his sleep.)\n\nGRANNY TYL I have a notion that our grandchildren who are still alive are coming to see us today....\n\nGAFFER TYL They are certainly thinking of as, for I feel anyhow and I have pins and needles in my legs....\n\nGRANNY TYL I think they must be quite near, for I see tears of joy dancing before my eyes....\n\nGAFFER TYL No, no, they are a long way off.... I still feel weak....\n\nGRANNY TYL I tell you they are here; I am quite strong....\n\nTYLTYL and MYTYL (rushing up from behind the oak) Here we are!... Here we are!... Gaffer! Granny!... It's we!... It's we!...\n\nGAFFER TYL There!... You see?... What did I tell you?... I was sure they would come to-day....\n\nGRANNY TYL Tyltyl!... Mytyl!... It's you!... It's she!... (Trying to run to meet them) I can't run!... I've still got the rheumatics!...\n\nGAFFER TYL (hobbling along as fast as he can) No more can I.... That's because of my wooden leg, which I still wear instead of the one I broke when I fell off the big oak....\n\n(The GRANDPARENTS and the CHILDREN exchange frantic embraces.)\n\nGRANNY TYL How tall and strong you've grown, Tyltyl!\n\nGAFFER TYL (stroking MYTYL'S hair) And Mytyl!... Just look at her.... What pretty hair, what pretty eyes!...\n\nGRANNY TYL Come and kiss me again!... Come on to my lap....\n\nGAFFER TYL And what about me?...\n\nGRANNY TYL No, no.... Come to me first.... How are Daddy and Mummy Tyl?...\n\nTYLTYL Quite well, granny.... They were asleep when we went out....\n\nGRANNY TYL (gazing at them and covering them with caresses) Lord, how pretty they are and how nice and clean!... Was it mummy who washed you?... And there are no holes in your stockings!... I used to darn them once, you know.... Why don't you come to see us oftener?... It makes us so happy!... It is months and months now that you've forgotten us and that we have seen nobody....\n\nTYLTYL We couldn't, granny; and to-day its only because of the Fairy....\n\nGRANNY TYL We are always here, waiting for a visit from those who are alive.... They come so seldom!... The last time you were here, let me see, when was it?... It was on All-hallows, when the church-bells were ringing....\n\nTYLTYL All-hallows?... We didn't go out that day, for we both had very bad colds....\n\nGRANNY TYL No; but you thought of us....\n\nTYLTYL Yes....\n\nGRANNY TYL Well, every time you think of us, we wake up and see you again....\n\nTYLTYL What, is it enough to...\n\nGRANNY TYL But come, you know that....\n\nTYLTYL No, I didn't know....\n\nGRANNY TYL (to GAFFER TYL) It's astonishing, up there.... They don't know yet.... Do they never learn anything?...\n\nGAFFER TYL It's as in our own time.... The Living are so stupid when they speak of the Others....\n\nTYLTYL Do you sleep all the time?...\n\nGAFFER TYL Yes, we get plenty of sleep, while waiting for a thought of the Living to come and wake us.... Ah, it is good to sleep when life is done.... But it is pleasant also to wake up from time to time....\n\nTYLTYL So you are not really dead?...\n\nGAFFER TYL What do you say?... What is he saying?... Now he's using words we don't understand.... Is it a new word, a new invention?...\n\nTYLTYL The word dead?...\n\nGAFFER TYL Yes, that was the word.... What does it mean?...\n\nTYLTYL Why, it means that one's no longer alive....\n\nGAFFER TYL How silly they are, up there!...\n\nTYLTYL Is it nice here?...\n\nGAFFER TYL Oh, yes; not bad, not bad; and, if one could just have a smoke....\n\nTYLTYL Aren't you allowed to smoke?...\n\nGAFFER TYL Yes, it's allowed; but I've broken my pipe....\n\nGRANNY TYL Yes, yes, all would be well, if only you would come and see us oftener.... Do you remember, Tyltyl?... The last time I baked you a lovely apple-tart.... You ate such a lot of it that you made yourself ill....\n\nTYLTYL But I haven't eaten any apple-tart since last year.... There were no apples this year....\n\nGRANNY TYL Don't talk nonsense.... Here, we have them always....\n\nTYLTYL That's different....\n\nGRANNY TYL What? That's different?... Why, nothing's different when we're able to kiss each other....\n\nTYLTYL (looking first at his GRANDMOTHER and then at his GRANDFATHER) You haven't changed, grandad, not a bit, not a bit.... And granny hasn't changed a bit either.... But you're better-looking....\n\nGAFFER TYL Well, we feel all right.... We have stopped growing older.... But you, how tall you're growing!... Yes, you're shooting up finely.... Look, over there, on the door, is the mark of the last time.... That was on All-hallows.... Now then, stand up straight.... (TYLTYL stands up against the door.) Four fingers taller!... That's immense!... (MYTYL also stands up against the door.) And Mytyl, four and a half!... Aha, ill weeds grow apace!... How they've grown, oh, how they've grown!...\n\nTYLTYL (looking around him with delight) Nothing is changed, everything is in its old place!... Only everything is prettier!... There is the clock with the big hand which I broke the point off....\n\nGAFFER TYL And here is the soup-tureen you chipped a corner off....\n\nTYLTYL And here is the hole which I made in the door, the day I found the gimlet....\n\nGAFFER TYL Yes, you've done some damage in your time!... And here is the plum-tree in which you were so fond of climbing, when I wasn't looking.... It still has its fine red plums....\n\nTYLTYL But they are finer than ever!...\n\nMYTYL And here is the old blackbird!... Does he still sing?...\n\n(The blackbird wakes and begins to sing at the top of his voice.)\n\nGRANNY TYL You see.... As soon as one thinks of him....\n\nTYLTYL (observing with amazement that the blackbird is quite blue) But he's blue!... Why, that's the bird, the Blue Bird which I am to take back to the Fairy.... And you never told us that you had him here!... Oh, he's blue, blue, blue as a blue glass marble!... (Entreatingly) Grandad, granny, will you give him to me?...\n\nGAFFER TYL Yes, perhaps, perhaps.... What do you think, granny?...\n\nGRANNY TYL Certainly, certainly.... What use is he to us?... He does nothing but sleep.... We never hear him sing....\n\nTYLTYL I will put him in my cage.... I say, where is my cage?... Oh, I know, I left it behind the big tree.... (He runs to the tree, fetches the cage and puts the blackbird into it.) So, really, you've really given him to me?... How pleased the Fairy will be!... And Light too!...\n\nGAFFER TYL Mind you, I won't answer for the bird.... I'm afraid that he will never get used again to the restless life up there and that he'll come back here by the first wind that blows this way.... However, we shall see.... Leave him there, for the present, and come and look at the cow....\n\nTYLTYL (noticing the hives) And how are the bees getting on?\n\nGAFFER TYL Oh, pretty well.... They are no longer alive, as you call it up there; but they work hard....\n\nTYLTYL (going up to the hives) Oh, yes!... I can smell the honey!... How heavy the hives must be!... All the flowers are so beautiful!... And my little dead sisters, are they here too?...\n\nMYTYL And where are my three little brothers who were buried?...\n\n(At these words, seven little CHILDREN, of different sizes, like a set of Pan's pipes, come out of the cottage, one by one.)\n\nGRANNY TYL Here they are, here they are!... As soon as you think of them, as soon as you speak of them, they are there, the darlings!...\n\n(TYLTYL and MYTYL run to meet the CHILDREN. They hustle and hug one another and dance and whirl about and utter screams of joy.)\n\nTYLTYL Hullo, Pierrot!... (They clutch each other by the hair.) Ah, so we're going to fight again, as in the old days.... And Robert!... I say, Jean, what's become of your top?... Madeleine and Pierette and Pauline!... And here's Riquette!...\n\nMYTYL Oh, Riquette, Riquette!... She's still crawling on all fours!...\n\nGRANNY TYL Yes, she has stopped growing.\n\nTYLTYL (noticing the little DOG yelping around them) There's Kiki, whose tail I cut off with Pauline's scissors.... He hasn't changed either....\n\nGAFFER TYL (sententiously) No, nothing changes here....\n\nTYLTYL And Pauline still has a pimple on her nose....\n\nGRANNY TYL Yes, it won't go away; there's nothing to be done for it....\n\nTYLTYL Oh, how well they look, how fat and glossy they are!... What jolly cheeks they have!... They look well fed....\n\nGRANNY TYL They have been much better since they ceased living.... There's nothing more to fear, nobody is ever ill, one has no anxiety....\n\n(The clock inside the cottage strikes eight.)\n\nGRANNY TYL (amazed) What's that?...\n\nGAFFER TYL I don't know, I'm sure.... It must be the clock....\n\nGRANNY TYL It can't be.... It never strikes....\n\nGAFFER TYL Because we no longer think of the time.... Was any one thinking of the time?...\n\nTYLTYL Yes, I was.... What is the time?...\n\nGAFFER TYL I'm sure I can't tell.... I've forgotten how.... It struck eight times, so I suppose it's what they call eight o'clock up there....\n\nTYLTYL Light expects me at a quarter to nine.... It's because of the Fairy.... It's extremely important.... I'm off!...\n\nGRANNY TYL Don't leave us like that, just as supper's ready!... Quick, quick, let's lay the table outside.... I've got some capital cabbage-soup and a beautiful plum-tart....\n\n(They get out the table, dishes, plates, etc., and lay for supper outside the door, all helping.)\n\nTYLTYL Well, as I've got the Blue Bird.... And then it's so long since I tasted cabbage-soup.... Ever since I've been, travelling.... They don't have it at the hotels....\n\nGRANNY TYL There!... That didn't take long!... Sit down, children.... Don't let us lose time, if you're in a hurry....\n\n(They have lit the lamp and served the soup. The GRANDPARENTS and the CHILDREN sit down round the table, jostling and elbowing one another and laughing and screaming with pleasure.)\n\nTYLTYL (eating like a glutton) How good it is!... Oh, how good it is!...I want some more! More!...\n\n(He brandishes his wooden spoon and noisily hits his plate with it.)\n\nGAFFER TYL Come, come, a little more quiet.... You're just as ill-behaved as ever; and you'll break your plate....\n\nTYLTYL (half-raising himself on his stool) I want more, more!... (He seizes the tureen, drags it toward him and upsets it and the soup, which trickles over the table and down over their knees and scalds them. Yells and screams of pain.)\n\nGRANNY TYL There!... I told you so!...\n\nGAFFER TYL (giving TYLTYL a loud box on the ear) That's one for you!...\n\nTYLTYL (staggered for a moment, next puts his hand to his cheek with an expression of rapture) Oh, that's just like the slaps you used to give me when you were alive?... Grandad, how nice it was and how good it makes one feel!... I must give you a kiss!...\n\nGAFFER TYL Very well; there's more where that came from, if you like them....\n\n(The clock strikes half-past eight)\n\nTYLTYL (starting up) Half-past eight!... (He flings down his spoon.) Mytyl, we've only just got time!...\n\nGRANNY TYL Oh, I say!... Just a few minutes more!... Your house isn't on fire!... We see you so seldom....\n\nTYLTYL No, we can't possibly.... Light is so kind.... And I promised her.... Come, Mytyl, come!...\n\nGAFFER TYL Goodness gracious, how tiresome the Living are with all their business and excitement!...\n\nTYLTYL (taking his cage and hurriedly kissing everybody all round) Good-bye, grandad.... Good-bye, granny.... Good-bye, brothers and sisters, Pierrot, Robert, Pauline, Madeleine, Riquette and you, too, Kiki.... I feel we mustn't stay.... Don't cry, granny; we will come back often....\n\nGRANNY TYL Come back every day!...\n\nTYLTYL Yes, yes; we will come back as often as we can....\n\nGRANNY TYL It's our only pleasure and it's such a treat for us when your thoughts visit us!...\n\nGAFFER TYL We have no other amusements....\n\nTYLTYL Quick, quick!... My cage!... My bird!...\n\nGAFFER TYL (handing him the cage) Here they are!... You know, I don't warrant him; and if he's not the right colour...\n\nTYLTYL Good-bye! Good-bye!...\n\nTHE BROTHERS AND SISTERS TYL Good-bye, Tyltyl! Good-bye, Mytyl!... Remember the barley-sugar!... Good-bye!... Come again!... Come again!...\n\n(They all wave their handkerchiefs while TYLTYL and MYTYL slowly move away. But already, during the last sentences, the fog of the beginning of the scene has been gradually re-forming, so that, at the end, all has disappeared in the mist and, at the fall of the curtain, TYLTYL and MYTYL are again alone visible under the big oak.)\n\nTYLTYL It's this way, Mytyl....\n\nMYTYL Where is Light?...\n\nTYLTYL I don't know.... (Looking at the bird in the cage.) But the bird is no longer blue!... He has turned black!...\n\nMYTYL Give me your hand, little brother.... I feel so frightened and so cold....\n\nCURTAIN\n\nACT III.\n\nSCENE 1.—The Palace of NIGHT.\n\nA large and wonderful hall of an austere, rigid, metallic and sepulchral magnificence, giving the impression of a Greek temple with columns, architraves, flagstones and ornaments of black marble, gold and ebony. The hall is trapezium-shaped. Basalt steps, occupying almost the entire width, divide it into three successive stages, which rise gradually toward the back. On the right and left, between the columns, are doors of sombre bronze. At the back, a monumental door of brass. The palace is lit only by a vague light that seems to emanate mainly from the brilliancy of the marble and the ebony. At the rise of the curtain, NIGHT, in the form of a very old woman, clad in long, black garments, is seated on the steps of the second stage between two children, of whom one, almost naked, like Cupid, is smiling in a deep sleep, while the other is standing up, motionless and veiled from head to foot.\n\nEnter from the right, in the foreground, the CAT\n\nNIGHT Who goes there?\n\nTHE CAT (sinking heavily upon the marble steps) It is I, Mother Night.... I am worn out....\n\nNIGHT What's the matter, child?... You look pale and thin and you are splashed with mud to your very whiskers.... Have you been fighting on the tiles again, in the snow and rain?...\n\nTHE CAT It has nothing to do with the tiles!... It's our secret that's at stake!... It's the beginning of the end!... I have managed to escape for a moment to warn you; but I greatly fear that there is nothing to be done....\n\nNIGHT Why?... What has happened?...\n\nTHE CAT I have told you of little Tyltyl, the woodcutter's son, and of the magic diamond.... Well, he is coming here to demand the Blue Bird of you....\n\nNIGHT He hasn't got it yet.....\n\nTHE CAT He will have it soon, unless we perform some miracle.... This is how the matter stands: Light, who is guiding him and betraying us all, for she has placed herself entirely on Man's side, Light has learned that the Blue Bird, the real one, the only one that can live in the light of day, is hidden here, among the blue birds of the dreams that live on the rays of the moon and die as soon as they set eyes on the sun.... She knows that she is forbidden to cross the threshold of your palace, but she is sending the children; and, as you cannot prevent Man from opening the doors of your secrets, I do not know how all this will end.... In any case, if, unfortunately, they should lay their hands on the real Blue Bird, there would be nothing for us but to disappear....\n\nNIGHT Oh dear, oh dear!.... What times we live in!... I never have a moment's peace.... I cannot understand Man, these last few years.... What is he aiming at?... Must he absolutely know everything?... Already he has captured a third of my Mysteries, all my Terrors are afraid and dare not leave the house, my Ghosts have taken flight, the greater part of my Sicknesses are ill....\n\nTHE CAT I know, Mother Night, I know, the times are hard and we are almost alone in our struggle against Man.... But I hear them coming.... I see only one way: as they are children, we must give them such a fright that they will not dare to persist or to open the great door at the back, behind which they would find the Birds of the Moon.... The secrets of the other caverns will be enough to distract their attention and terrify them....\n\nNIGHT (listening to a sound outside) What do I hear?... Are there many of them?...\n\nTHE CAT It is nothing; it is our friends, Bread and Sugar; Water is not very well and Fire could not come, because he is related to Light.... The Dog is the only one who is not on our side; but it is never possible to keep him away....\n\n(Enter timidly, on the right, in the foreground, TYLTYL, MYTYL, BREAD, SUGAR and the DOG.)\n\nTHE CAT (rushing up to TYLTYL) This way, little master, this way.... I have told Night, who is delighted to see you.... You must forgive her, she is a little indisposed; that is why she was not able to come to meet you....\n\nTYLTYL Good-day, Mrs. Night....\n\nNIGHT (in an offended voice) Good-day?... I am not used to that.... You might say, Good-night, or, at least. Good-evening....\n\nTYLTYL (mortified) I beg your pardon, ma'am....I did not know....(Pointing to the two CHILDREN.) Are those your two little boys?... They are very nice....\n\nNIGHT This is Sleep....\n\nTYLTYL Why is he so fat?...\n\nNIGHT That is because he sleeps well....\n\nTYLTYL And the other, hiding himself?... Why does he veil his face?...Is he ill?... What is his name?...\n\nNIGHT That is Sleep's sister.... It is better not to mention her name....\n\nTYLTYL Why?...\n\nNIGHT Because her name is not pleasant to hear.... But let us talk of something else.... The Cat tells me that you have come here to look for the Blue Bird....\n\nTYLTYL Yes, ma'am, if you will allow me.... Will you tell me where he is?...\n\nNIGHT I don't know, dear.... All I can say is that he is not here.... I have never seen him....\n\nTYLTYL Yes, yes.... Light told me that he was here; and Light knows what she is saying.... Will you hand me your keys?...\n\nNIGHT But you must understand, dear, that I cannot give my keys like that to the first comer.... I have the keeping of all Nature's secrets and I am absolutely forbidden to deliver them to anybody, especially to a child....\n\nTYLTYL You have no right to refuse them to Man when he asks you for them....I know that....\n\nNIGHT Who told you?...\n\nTYLTYL Light....\n\nNIGHT Light again! Always Light!... How dare she interfere, how dare she?...\n\nTHE DOG Shall I take them from her by force, my little god?...\n\nTYLTYL Hold your tongue, keep quiet and try to behave.... (ToNIGHT) Come, madam, give me your keys, please....\n\nNIGHT Have you the sign, at least?... Where is it?...\n\nTYLTYL (touching his hat) Behold the Diamond!...\n\nNIGHT"
