        "text": "The exhibition in MSK wanted to highlight the work of two remarkable artists who were close friends and who would subsequently, each in their own field, exercise great influence on the European Symbolist movement. During their studies in Ghent, both George Minne and Maurice Maeterlinck were imbued with a similar appetite for life. Maeterlinck got to know the young Minne as 'a primitive almost, a wonderful minus habens'. He later would describe him as ‘the great portrayer of sorrow’. Minne, for his part, said that sometimes it was not clear whether he or Maurice Maeterlinck had come up with an idea given that they were such kindred spirits.\n\nTow contemporaries rejoined\n\nThe exhibition situated George Minne and Maurice Maeterlinck in their early years in the frame of Ghent’s social and artistic circles in the late nineteenth century, an environment that also left its mark on the poets Grégoire Le Roy, Georges Rodenbach and Karel Van de Woestijne. The exhibition then evolved in two directions. On the one hand, it discussed the relationship between Maurice Maeterlinck and the visual art of his era. Maeterlinck’s characteristic language was not only reflected in the output of the music and theatre world, but especially in the visual arts. This section included works by artists who have directly inspired Maeterlinck (such as Odilon Redon) and especially of artists who, in turn, were influenced by his ideas, poems and plays (including Fernand Khnopff, Maurice Denis and Léon Spilliaert)."
