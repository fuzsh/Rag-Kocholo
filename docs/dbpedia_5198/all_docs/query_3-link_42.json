Photo: Susan Farlow\n\nSURVIVING NUKU HIVA: THE SOUTH PACIFIC ISLAND THAT’S THE LOCATION OF THE “SURVIVOR” SHOW Where past survivors include the likes of Herman Melville. And me.\n\nby\n\nSusan Farlow\n\nWhen the producers of “Survivor” needed a new location for the fourth installment of the popular TV show, they chose Nuku Hiva, one of the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, smack in the middle of the South Pacific.\n\nThey couldn’t have chosen better. For one thing, contestants can get inspiration from an earlier survivor, Herman Melville of Moby Dick fame, who met up with island cannibals in 1842 yet lived to tell a tale of survival. (I myself barely survived a recent visit to Nuku Hiva, but more about that later.)\n\nNowadays the locals are no longer cannibals. But a lot has remained unchanged . This is still one of the world’s most remote islands, home to fierce landscapes, fierce seas, fierce insects and fierce weather. Plus, plenty of ancient customs and beliefs remain: the island’s carved tiki gods, for example, are said to be quite revengeful. Nuku Hiva is a “don’t mess with me” kind of place. Which makes it a great place for dishing out all kinds of misery for the “Survivor” contestants.\n\nThat is not to say Nuku Hiva looks like a miserable place. Quite the contrary. This lush, volcanic island is savagely beautiful. And it’s this haunting beauty as well as the remoteness of the island that has drawn some of the world’s greatest escape artists such as Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson and American writer Jack London, dreamers who traveled to Nuku Hiva to find an unspoiled place, an earthly paradise.\n\nStill, even to this day, few visitors have followed in their footsteps to Nuku Hiva. Because this brooding island is so inaccessible, mass tourism has yet to arrive. And this means no tour buses (hardly even any paved roads), no tourist traps, and few lodging facilities..\n\nNuku Hiva may be hard to get to, but there are rewards for your efforts. Because it is so remote, you’ll find that in a lot of ways this is still ancient Polynesia.\n\nWhether you come by air or sea, you’re immediately struck by the forbidding look of the place. I got my first look at Nuku Hiva from the rail of a ship. Through the morning fog, I could just barely make out a jungly green land mass that, here and there, shot up into jagged, spire-like peaks. The whole island soared straight out of the sea.\n\nThis might be French Polynesia but there was not a tranquil lagoon to be seen. Some 950 miles northeast of Tahiti, Nuku Hiva is part of the craggy, volcanic Marquesas archipelago. Some 2,500 souls inhabit this 12 by 9 mile speck, making Nuku Hiva the largest island in the Marquesas group and the most populated.\n\nLike the rugged landscape, the people of Nuku Hiva (as well as all the Marquesas) impress you right off the bat. Captain James Cook, the great explorer who sailed this archipelago in 1774, couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the Marquesans. “Magnificent physiques,” Capt. Cook wrote in his log.\n\nAnd in the old days, these magnificent bodies also tended to wage wars. Lots of wars. Tribes constantly fought with one another. One of their favorite weapons was a war club called “casse-tete,” or head breaker A great warrior could earn much status for himself. So “Survivor” fans take note: Warring tribes are nothing new to Nuku Hiva.\n\nMy first encounter with Nuku Hivans came in the tiny village of Hatiheu, on the island’s north coast, a place that author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) fell in love with. It is here that I almost met my maker.\n\nNot far from the pretty little village (pop. 340), with its baby blue schoolhouse and little white church, a performance of ancient dances was to take place, I was told. I followed the villager’s directions and soon found myself at a sacred stone ceremonial plaza where Nuku Hivans once worshiped their gods and ate their enemies.\n\nWar chants and drum beats ripped through the hot, humid air. Scowl-faced stone tiki gods stood guard over their domain. Nearly devoured by dense jungle gloom, the place had the atmosphere of a lost kingdom.\n\nThe ancient “Dance of the Pig” was under way. Pigs were “almost deified in the Marquesas” for their “mana” or supernatural power, I was later told by Mark Eddowes, a British archaeologist who was with the Polynesian Center of Human Sciences in Tahiti. And these leaf-clad dancers had nailed the impersonation of a pig, with their grunt-like chants and on-all-fours choreography. Clearly, the animal was being honored. After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery. Also, pig was (and still is) welcomed on the menu.\n\nAlso welcomed on the menu, about a century or so ago, were “pua oa” or “long pigs.” Humans, to you and me\n\nAbout halfway through the Pig Dance performance, I nearly lost my head, thanks to a falling coconut from one of the many palms which line the plaza. You’d think that getting crowned by a coconut would be a near daily occurrence here on this coconut-rich island. But it seems otherwise. When the fruit thudded to the ground, mere inches from me, numerous villagers jerked their heads my way and gasped at my close demise. It was touching to think these descendants of cannibals seemed protective of me and my head.\n\nA memo to “Survivor” contestants: It will be hard to go hungry on Nuku Hiva.. There are too many coconuts for that. Plus, this fertile land abounds in tropical fruits like bananas and breadfruit. And oh yeah, wild pigs, too.\n\nHowever, it is going to be hot work catching those oinkers. Located just nine degrees south of the equator, Nuku Hiva can hammer you with its brutal climate, something I quickly came to appreciate. Though the average daytime temperature was around 80 degrees, it always felt like a steam bath to me.\n\nWeather can seem downright strange at times. Winds are often howling and seas choppy. This is not the kind of seas you expect in the South Seas. But then Nuku Hiva, along with the rest of the Marquesas Islands, are another world from the other island groups of French Polynesia: Different weather, different language, even the people look different. The men tend to be massive, positively mountainous.\n\nBut as tough as the people are, the land is even more so. Rugged mountain terrain and dense jungle make it a trial to travel around the island. Often, it’s easier to take a boat from one isolated village to another since the roads, “tracks” really, are for the most part unpaved. Four-wheel-drives were the only vehicles I saw on the island and when the torrential rains come, you can pretty much forget about the 4WDs even. A lot of locals recommend four-legged horse power as the way to see the island.\n\nAnd so I traveled by ship from the village of Hatiheu on the island’s north coast to Taiohae in the south. It was at the town of Taiohae where 22-year-old Herman Melville, the great American writer (1819-1891), jumped ship in 1842, having had enough of the conditions aboard the whaler Acushnet.\n\nNowadays, Taiohae is the administrative center for all the Marquesas and is its largest town with a population of 1,700. (There are only 2,300 people total on Nuku Hiva.) It’s no metropolis, but Taiohae is the Marquesan version of a happening place . Besides government offices and a post office, Taiohae boasts a bank, a hospital, a handful of stores, a few eateries and lodgings, and maybe a mile or so of paved road.\n\nAnd in the autumn of 2001, Taiohae also boasted one of the two production camps of “Survivor 4” Plus, just a short distance away is Colette Bay, the site of the “ Survivor” Tribal Council.\n\nThe town of Taiohae and surrounds are full of charm. Herman Melville was smitten with the place, raving, “Nothing can exceed the imposing scenery of this bay.” Seems that even being held captive by the island’s fiercest cannibal tribe, the tattooed Typees of the Taipivai Valley, hadn’t left a bad taste in his mouth about the island. After a month or so, he made an escape and even ended up writing his first book, Typee (1946), a best seller based loosely on his experiences.\n\nNowadays, every visitor is dying to see this Taipivai Valley where Melville was held hostage. I was no different.\n\nFor Melville, the journey from the port of Taiohae to the cannibal valley was a grueling slog through mountainous, overbearing jungle terrain. Some 150 years later, I could still appreciate Melville’s torturous trek. Though I went with a tour group in a jeep, it was still a bumpy roll on a rutted muddy “road“ through hilly and smothering jungle.\n\nJust how rough was this terrain? It took two bone-busting hours for the jeep to travel a mere 10 miles. Then we pulled up to an overlook and archaeologist Mark Eddowes pointed below and said, “There is the famous Taipivai Valley, where Melville lived for six weeks.” With a bay slicing up into it, Taipivai Valley had the look of a fjord.\n\nWell, the Taipi people have cooled down in the last century and a half. Only about 450 folks live in the valley today. And these days, when you come calling at Taipivai Valley, the friendly residents only want to talk your head off.\n\nBut there are still fierce man-eaters in Taipivai Valley, in fact all over Nuku Hiva. The locals call them no-nos.. Scientists call them Simulium buissoni. Everyone calls them a pain. No-nos are tiny blackflies, little blood-sucking vampires which rip and tear your flesh. I saw many people with no-no bites.. All the guidebooks warn visitors to use insect repellant. For some reason, I never got a no-no bite. The tiki gods must have smiled upon me.\n\nTiki gods, mind you, do not smile often. All over Nuku Hiva, you can come across these usually grimace-faced stone gods. Sometimes you almost stumble upon them at sites which are nearly swallowed up by the jungle. Overgrown ruins dot Nuku Hiva (as well as the other Marquesas Islands), and this has to be one of the few places left in the world where you can still feel like you’re the first person to discover a forgotten ancient city.\n\nBesides ruins, some pre-Christian religious beliefs have also stayed put. You’ll find locals who claim that ancestral spirits haunt the ancient ceremonial grounds and are testy beings which, when offended, will take revenge. Even the carved tikis are said to be alive and often spiteful. I recall something a guide in Tahiti, who was not from Polynesia but Paris, once told me: “Do not ever move a tiki. It is bad luck.”\n\nBesides carved tikis, another ancient art form here is tattooing, which originated in ancient Polynesia (as did the word, “tatu”). But nowhere was tattooing as developed as in the Marquesas. “In the old days, by the time a man died,” explained Eddows the archaeologist, “he was thoroughly tattooed, including the eyelids, tongue and genitals.”\n\nWhy? Decoration was one reason. But mostly, it was to communicate. Your tattoos made you an open book, telling the story of your life. And tattoos indicated your power and prestige. Chiefs and warriors were adorned with so many tattoos that from a distance their bodies appeared to be blue. Then in the mid-1800s, missionaries banned the practice. But within the past 20 years, tattooing has returned and with a vengeance.\n\nIn addition to tattooing, many traditional arts (dancing, wood carving) are enjoying a revival on Nuku Hiva (as well as the rest of the Marquesas), and residents are proud of their traditional Polynesian lifestyles and traditions.\n\nBut they know that with “Survivor” coming to their island, opportunities as well as changes will occur. The filming, for example, provided high-paying employment to several hundred inhabitants. The “Survivor” project brought some 250 technicians, cameramen and producers to the island, all of whom needed drivers, cooks and assistants. The crew also hired boats and 4WDs from locals. According to Tahiti Presse, a 4WD vehicle was renting for $2,000 US per day, and work as a guard could earn a local some $700 US for 10 hours of work.\n\nAnd once “Survivor-Marquesas” airs to millions of viewers in 147 countries, residents hope to see a boost in tourism to their breathtaking island. At present, there are so few travelers to Nuku Hiva, no official records are kept of visitor numbers, according to Tahiti Tourism, the tourist board for the region.\n\n“Survivor” may very well put Nuku Hiva on the tourist map. Yet unlike earlier visitors, today’s tourists will find no cannibals. But watch out for the coconuts.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nHOW TO GET THERE: First you must get to Tahiti, which is about a 7 ½ hour flight from Los Angeles. Airlines flying between LA and Tahiti (Papeete) include Air New Zealand, Air France and Air Tahiti Nui. From Tahiti, there are basically two ways to get to Nuku Hiva: By air or by sea. To go by air, you take the Air Tahiti flight which operates 5 or 6 times a week. Make reservations early since these flights are usually booked solid. The flight takes 3 ½ hours. The second way to reach Nuku Hiva is by sea, via cruise ship or the 100-passenger Aranui, a mixed passenger/cargo vessel that offers voyages between Tahiti and the Marquesas. The Aranui visits 15 ports in the Marquesas, including Nuku Hiva.\n\nPLACES TO STAY: If you don’t cruise there, you’ll need lodging on Nuku Hiva. A good place to base yourself would be in Taiohae, the island’s hub, where there are several lodges.\n\nNuku Hiva At A Glance\n\nLOCATION: One of ten main Marquesas Islands, Nuku Hiva is located in the South Pacific Ocean, about 950 miles northeast of Tahiti. The Marquesas archipelago, about halfway between Australia and the U.S., is farther from a continent than any other group of islands on earth.\n\nPOPULATION: The most populated of the Marqueseas Islands, Nuku Hiva is home to about 2,300 people. (The total population of all the Marquesas Islands is about 8,000.)\n\nLAND MASS: The largest island of the Marquesas Islands, Nuku Hiva measures about 12 miles by 9 miles.. POLITICAL STATUS: Nuku Hiva is an island in the Marquesas archipelago of French Polynesia. It is an Overseas Territory of France. Nuku Hiva was claimed for France in September1842 by Admiral Abel Dupetit-Thouars.\n\nLANGUAGES: Marquesan and French\n\nOCCUPATIONS: Nuku Hiva is the economic and governmnental hub of the Marquesas archipelago. Residents of Nuku Hiva work for the government, the school system, or for themselves in farming and fishing enterprises. The principal export is copra, the dried coconut meat that is processed into oil, soap and cosmetics. A number of Nuku Hivans make a living as wood carvers, turning out tikis, ceremonial clubs, bowls and platters.\n\nFIRST WESTERN VISITOR: American trader, Captain Joseph Ingraham of Boston, is credited as the first Westerner to set foot on Nuku Hiva, in April 1791. ONCE CLAIMED FOR THE U.S.: In 1813, another Bostonian, Captain David Porter of the U.S. frigate Essex, annexed Nuku Hiva for the United States. However, the act was never ratified by Congress. In 1842, the French took claim to the island.\n\nRELIGION: Catholic majority and Protestant minority. Some inhabitants also hold beliefs of the pre-Christian religion, such as ghosts and spirits.\n\nThis story appeared in the Dallas Morning News, the Memphis Commercia Appeal, the Providence Journal, the Bangor Daily News"
