        "text": "Current Location: Baie Taiohae, Nuku Hiva Island, Marquesas Islands\n\nDateline: 26 October, 2011\n\nGreetings once again to all our families, friends, and Googlers. We have been enjoying (?tolerating) the swell conditions at Baie Taiohae these past several days. Moe set a stern anchor so we have been riding a rocking horse rather than an endless rendition of rock-a-bye baby.\n\nThe small town of Taiohae has the now familiar stunning location of volcanic formations all about. We have had quite a bit of rain during our stay here, and whilst this has become tiresome, the low cloud has also accentuated the dramatic landforms that ring the bay.\n\nMost of the businesses hug the bay with many houses up in the nearby hills. There does not appear to be so much copra production here (indeed we have seen no back yard drying sheds here in town, although there is no shortage of coconut palms). The town looks more, ‘lived in,’ (that is, not quite so tidy) than the settlements on other islands. We have seen far more people going about their lives here than elsewhere. The vehicles of choice in these parts are large 4WD. British readers may be cheered to learn that Land Rovers (Defender series) are hugely popular, the boxy cabin immediately recognizable.\n\nThere are a lot of stone Tikis about the town and in quite a few front yards, all with their pot bellies, huge bug eyes, and hydrocephalic looking heads. The housing is perhaps more simple than on the other islands, which was surprising given that this is the main administrative centre for the Marquesas Islands. The gardens, once again, are glorious, with a profusion of fruit trees, flowering trees and shrubs, and an indeterminate number of variegated shrubs and vines. If you’d like a bit more info on the Tiki in Polynesian culture, go here. As with the previous post, if you’d like a better look at the smaller photos, just click on it and it’ll be enlarged in another window.\n\nThe second Marquesas Festival, Motu Haka (The Gathering) was held here at Nuku Hiva in 1989 (the first was held at Ua Puo Island, in 1987). The Festival is sort of like a cultural Olympics (as far as I can make out), and was begun in an effort to preserve ‘the Marquesan language (different to Tahitian), chants, dances, legends, tattoos, ancient sculptures, and wood carving.’ [from the Interpretative sign at the festival site]. The next one will be held here at Nuku Hiva in December 2011, so preparations are well underway building the performance areas. Additionally, restoration of archaeological sites is also done under the auspices of the Festival: indeed, the site of the 1989 festival on Nuku Hiva was originally the home of the mother (Putahaii) of the chief of Taiohae (Kiatonui) at the end of the C18th. It had been abandoned in 1901. We have heard wonderful drumming in the early evening these past several days.\n\nSaturday was market day…we were told that the fruit and vegetable market opened at 4:30am. That was a little too early for us, however by 6:40am I was back on board s/v Wadda laden with fresh fruit and vegetables. The market is conveniently located next to the dock, in a small clean roller door sided building. The dock is where the fishermen clean their catch, the off-cuts chucked back into the sea to be eagerly gobbled up by the local shark population.\n\nA huge cruise ship anchored at the entrance to the bay around 10am on market day. We were told there were 1800 passengers on board…if they all disembarked they would have about doubled the island population.\n\nWe went ashore again during a brief break in the rain to see how the town responded to a cruise ship visit. In a three sided performance hall the townsfolk essentially had a rehearsal for the upcoming festival, and us tourists (cruise ship and sailors alike) were able to watch them go through their paces. The women’s singing was warmly harmonious and the men’s dancing spirited. It was all rather nice. There were, of course, various trinkets, hand crafts and food for sale.\n\nAfter several tedious days of rain, the sky cleared on Sunday, so we were able to dry out the cockpit. In the afternoon I went for a walk around the bay, in search of more Tikis and gardens. There were quite a few people out and about of all ages, enjoying a leisurely Sunday afternoon. Well away from the fish cleaning station/shark feeding area, many children and adults cooled off in the water. Volleyball was played by both the young (teenagers) and the young at heart. One family had a fine time playing pétanque. In some parts of the world, folks wash their cars on Sunday. On Nuku Hiva, folks wash their horse on Sunday…in the ocean…so I guess that makes them sea horses.\n\nThe Tikis stand guard at the entrance to several of the businesses (eg the bank) and municipal buildings\n\n(eg the fire station)…in fact, once you start looking, you realize they’re everywhere.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the next Marquesas Festival will take place in December 2011. Off the road out of town is one of the locations for this year’s festival. We visited Monday, 24 October. The restored site, as at Puama’u, sits in a clearing amidst fairly dense vegetation. It was wonderfully peaceful. There is a main stage, and several smaller performance areas off to the side. The stage roof is supported at the front by carved posts… a tremendous amount of work. We wandered all over, envious of those of our friends who will be here for the grand occasion, but delighted that we were able to see what we did.\n\nIf you’re not tuckered out by Tikis, head over to here for more of the carved wooden posts (TallChick, there are >5 photos).\n\nWe cut short our explorations further afield. There is presently a man hunt underway here. A German sailor went hunting with the only sociopath on the island and did not return. Human remains were found and later identified as those of the sailor’s.\n\nWe shall be on our way again shortly. Time is tiki tiki tiking away\n\nMargaret and Moe"
