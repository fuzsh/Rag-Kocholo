The dive center loan, steel tank, shorty, jacket(scubapro), regulator R 190 (scubapro), weight belt, flippers, mask...\n\nWarning: Bagage allowance 20 kg on Air Tahiti flights.The price of the dives includes the loan of diving material.\n\nPossess a current diving certification card from a recognized scuba diving instructional agency.\n\nENTRY:\n\nExcept for French citizens, anyone visiting French Polynesia needs a passport.\n\nCitizens of Argentina, Canada, Chilli, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the U.S, and some other European country can stay up to one month without a visa.\n\nMONEY:\n\nThe unit currency in French Polynesia is the franc CFP, whose value is tied to the French franc and euro. 1 US$ = \"100 FCP\" that depend the currency.\n\nExchange only at the Taiohae bank, some hotels accepts credit cards.\n\nNote that there is a weekly limit of 35000 CFP for ATM withdrawals or advances from any one account.\n\nThe C.P.M don't accept credit cards.\n\nTIME:\n\nThe Marquesas are a half-hour ahead of the rest of French Polynesia (noon in Tahiti is 12:30pm in Marquesas).\n\nELECTRICITY:\n\nThe electricity is usually 220 V, Sockets are generally the European two round pin style.\n\nHealth:\n\nThe mosquitoes and nonos (no see'ums, biting flies) have bad reputation, but are in fact not so annoying if you protect yourself properly: light trousers, and insect repellent are recommended for valley excursions. No obligatory vaccinations.\n\nSHOPPING:\n\nThe Marquesans handicrafts are well known for their tattoos and woodcarving.\n\nPRINCIPAL DIVING SPOTS IN NUKU HIVA\n\nWith more than one hundred kilometers of basalt coast line beaten by the by the pacific ocean, Nuku Hiva is a privileged land for under water exploration, a large number of caves teeming with spectacular fauna. And of course the hammerhead sharks have not been forgotten. The Marquesas Diving Center organise daily outing more than ten dives sites, of which the most remarkable are:\n\n1) HAMMER HEAD GUARD ROCK:\n\nIt is always impressive to come across, in the deep, manta an rays and a wide diversity of marine life. More surprising still, and very rare, to spot hammerhead sharks with such regularity. This is virtually guaranteed to happen between the surface to 90 ft. According to statistics compiled by the Marquesas Diving Center, divers have a 70% chance of spotting hammerhead during their dive. Usually the sharks pass by at a depth of less than 15m, which provide a unique opportunity for novice divers to approach them in shallow waters. The sharks are often curious and will come close to divers. The visibility amounts to 20m on average, but can be reduced to 5m at low tide when the current, flowing out of the bay, carries particles. In this case, your chances of glimpsing the hammerheads dwindle dramatically. If sharks are not in the area or if the visibility is minimal, focus on the wall. Its caverns form a good habitat for moray eels and scorpion fish, and shells are plentiful, including the Gauguini, a rare species endemic to the Marquesas that is ideal for macro photography. Ten minutes by boat ride. Expertise rating: Intermediate.\n\n2) TIKAPO ROCK:\n\nThis site boasts a spectacular topography. Rising from the depths, a rocky peak brush the surface. Found at the exit of Taipivaï valley (where Herman Melville stayed, and hence wrote his book Taipee), domited by the cliff approximately 400m faced off Cap Martin, where hundreds off birds nest. Tikapo a perfect place for spotting a dense population of both pelagic and reef species. Photographers will enjoy this site, particulary for shooting pelagics, as the current is too tricky to master close-ups of smaller fish. Going around the peak, you will come upon impressive schools of trevellies, unicorn fish and barracuda sweeping around in search of easy pickings. There are large numbers of jacks, abundant groups of eagle rays and, parrotfish, triggerfish, butterfly fish, puffer fish, soldier fish, and hunting packs of dogteeth tuna, together with scorpion fish around the crevices. White tip reef sharks are also common here. Invertebrates are relatively limited, except for porcelain crabs, urchins and encrusting sponges that form delicate orange patches. Site exposed to the swell and sea wind. Half an hour by boat ride. Expertise rating: Intermediate.\n\n3) THE PYGMY ORCAS\n\nThis site is one of the most stunning in all of French Polynesia. Please note that good weather conditions are essential, as this side of the island is exposed to the prevailing winds and the swell. If the sea is choppy, it's not accessible. The prominent and unique feature of the dive is the incredible concentration of melon-headed whales (peponocephala electra) that congregate in the area every morning. It's hard to count them, but according to some estimates, there can be as many as 400. They usually gather and stay at the surface, with their noses emerging, vertical or horizontal, sometimes playing, some times motionless. Snorkelling is the best way to approach them. You can hear their distinct, piercing sounds, and you will easily notice their white lips, which are thought to be phosphorescent at night to lure the squid they feed on. The site itself is quite impressive, since it is anywhere between 300m and 1km off the coast, in a blue sea. Occasionally, one can also see yellofin tuna and sail fish cruising through this area. About 40 minutes by boat ride. Expertise rating: Novice.\n\n4) EKAMAKO CAVE\n\nThis site offers an unforgettable cave diving experience and provides a unique opportunity to approach stingrays .It centers on a large, open-fronted cavern deeply undercutting the basaltic cliff at 10m. A flashlight is indispensable for exploring the cavern. Upon entering, you will cross a vast chamber that continues on the right until a freshwater resurgence; on the left, it slopes up smoothly to a large air pocket. The sandy bottoms of both sections are literally carpeted by stingrays, the star attraction of the dive. The numerous crevices and fissures in the left section of cave are home to huge lobsters and sleeping lobsters. Given the shallow depth, you will have plenty time to explore all the nooks and crannies of the cave. 15 minutes by boat ride. Expertise rating: Intermediate.\n\n5) MOTUMANO POINT\n\nThis strategic location exposed to open sea current, acts as magnet for pelagic. Numerous sharks, in particular hammerheads and white tip reef sharks, have made this area their hunting ground. And if you want to approach manta rays, this is a site not to be missed .Be on the lookout for schools of snappers, barracuda, trevallies and the star attractions of the dive, manta rays and hammerheads. White tip reef sharks tend to gather around the extremity of the tip, an area subject to a surge and strong currents. 30 minutes by boat ride.Expertise rating: Novice.\n\n6) MATATETEIKO\n\nAt the western side of the island, this site is the farthest from Taiohae. It features is a rocky platform visible from the surface at the bottom of the cliff that continues underwater for about 100m toward the open sea. Entry place in a sheltered inlet next to the emerging platform. The descent is gradual until 30m.It is bordered by walls and peppered with small canyons and caverns. This point is an ideal location for admiring schools of prowling predators: barracuda, treallies, tuna and white tip sharks. Expect a challenging current that usually sweeps over the area, but also expect the most prolific underwater life drifting with the turbulence. Take the time to explore the small canyons and scattered boulders, as they harbour soldier fish, octopuses, lobsters and snapers. Look around and above you so as not miss the manta rays and hammerheads that often pass by in the shallow waters near the cliff. 40 minutes by boat ride. Expertise rating: Intermediate.\n\n7) DULCINEA\n\nDulcinea consists of a rocky seamount brushing the surface in a protected bay. It features an interesting underwater topography that is divided into two connected tunnels shaped like an inverted V. The site is typically profuse with snapers, urchins, shells, lobsters and other crustaceans, together with curtains of soldier fish that provide a magnificent backdrop for photographer near the exit. Novice divers wishing to experience cave diving will appreciate this site because the conditions are optimal. Though a flashlight is recommended, you never loose sight of natural light. 15 minutes by boat ride. Expert rating: Novice.\n\nDIVING CONDITIONS:\n\nWater temperature: 28° all year round. Since the Marquesan waters are devoid of any protective barrier reefs, divers should be prepared to cope with sometimes difficult conditions, particulary the swell, to get to the site.\n\nCertain site need good experience.\n\nFor melon Headed whale (pygmy orca): January to April.\n\nBest time for hammerhead sharks: June to November.\n\nPacific manta ray and all the fauna are present all year round."
