        "text": "At Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., our mission is to provide superior cruise vacations for our guests. This mission applies to all our activities including the products and experiences we offer on board our ships, at our destinations and ports of call, and online through websites and interactive features, including applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network \"tabs,\" and other online or mobile offerings (which we collectively call the \"Services\"). Our Services are owned and/or operated, either directly or through our service providers and business partners, by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and brands, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\").\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes what data we collect online and offline and how we use, share, and secure that data. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, correction, and deletion of your personal data. Personal data is information, or a combination of different types of information, that could allow you to be identified.\n\nWe encourage you to review our Privacy Policy and click on the available links if you want additional information on a particular topic.\n\nBy providing us with your personal information or otherwise using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.\n\nWe may collect the following categories of data either directly from you or from our business partners or third parties and in accordance with applicable law:\n\nPersonal details (e.g., name, salutation, title, date of birth, place of birth, gender, photographs, images, and military service)\n\nContact details (e.g., email address, telephone number, mobile number, address, and emergency contact information)\n\nHealth details (e.g., past medical history, temperature readings, test results, and vaccination history)\n\nTravel/vacation preference details (e.g., flight number, hotel booking, cabin number, special occasion dates, special accommodations, loyalty program information, dietary preferences, travel companions, and family members)\n\nYour location and activities (e.g., CCTV footage of public areas and records of your entries and exits from the ship)\n\nDetails regarding your previous travels, locations you have visited, and contacts\n\nGovernment-issued documents (e.g., passports, alien resident cards, visas, residency permits, social security numbers, national and state identification numbers, driver’s licenses, and redress numbers)\n\nDetails regarding your use of websites and applications (e.g., usernames, passwords, security answers, geolocation information, details regarding your interaction with websites, applications, and emails, such as whether you opened an email, which may permit us to recognize you across multiple devices, or to know if you watched the health and safety video or viewed certain content on our websites and applications)\n\nFinancial details (e.g., credit card information, transactional history and purchases, amount paid for Services, bank information, income, and business information)\n\nDetails of your play and spend at casinos, loyalty rewards, and, if you apply for credit for use at our onboard casinos, credit-related information\n\nInformation available via public records and publicly available content on social media platforms\n\nDetails regarding your interactions with our team members and call centers, including email communications and recordings of your calls\n\nEmployment application details (e.g., name, employment history, telephone number, address, email address, education history, reference details, military service, and immigration status)\n\nData collected when you create an account with us, purchase our products, or use our Services may include data about yourself, those traveling with you, and your emergency contacts. By providing us with the personal data of any third party, you confirm that you have the authority to do so on their behalf and have provided them with the information set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe operate closed circuit television (\"CCTV\") cameras on our ships, including at all access points and throughout public areas. These CCTV cameras record continually and images of you may appear in these recordings.\n\nPlease be aware that we have photographers on board taking photographs for guests to purchase. If you would not like to be photographed, please let our photographers know and they would be happy to take reasonable steps to comply with your request. Please note that we are unable to guarantee that you will not be included in photographs on an incidental basis.\n\nSome of the categories of data that we collect in connection with the provision of our Services or through the employment application process may constitute special categories of personal data (also known as sensitive personal data). In particular, we may collect personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical, or political beliefs, sexual orientation, or data concerning health, such as medical history or dietary restrictions, if in connection with our provision of Services or through the employment application process.\n\nWe collect this information when you choose to provide it to us or to a service provider or third party such as a travel agent or through the employment application process. We use this information to provide a service you request, such as medical care on board one of our cruises (whether in person or through our telehealth services), or special dietary accommodations, or in connection with your application for employment.\n\nIf, while traveling with us, you allege a personal injury or submit a claim after alleging a personal injury, we may collect personal data concerning the alleged incident, including healthcare information.\n\nWith your consent, we may use facial comparison technology to facilitate and expedite your embarkation and/or disembarkation by taking your photograph and matching it against the photograph we collected from you during check-in or embarkation. When there is a match, you will be able to board the ship or be checked out of your cruise.\n\nSeparately, we may securely provide your disembarkation photograph to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), who uses its own facial comparison technology to match the photograph against images of you that CBP already has on file from your passport, other travel documents or prior CBP border inspections. Once we receive verification of your identity from CBP, we will delete your disembarkation photograph immediately. We do not retain your facial recognition data beyond the duration of your cruise or use it for any other purpose other than those described above. If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP will maintain your photograph for no more than 12 hours. For certain non-U.S. citizens, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will store your photograph for a longer period. For more information on how CBP uses your biometric data, please visit www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics.\n\nGlobal health data\n\nFor the health and safety of our guests and crew, we may process additional personal data during a pandemic or other global health crisis, including taking individuals’ temperatures through means such as thermal imaging cameras.\n\nIf we are made aware that an individual is exhibiting symptoms of an infectious disease, we may evaluate our transaction data and photographs taken during your cruise and may run facial recognition technology on our CCTV footage to notify the persons who were in close proximity with the affected individual and take appropriate action to mitigate the spread of the disease. Such steps may include medical examinations, testing, containment, and/or disembarkation of the affected persons.\n\nWe retain your personal data for as long as we have a relationship with you or in accordance with applicable law, and such relationship includes any request to receive marketing or other promotional materials from us or membership in our loyalty programs. When deciding how long to keep your personal data after our relationship with you has ended, we take into account our legal obligations, including requirements of regulators and governmental agencies that have authority over us. We may also retain records to investigate or defend against potential legal claims.\n\nWe will delete or anonymize your personal data at the end of the retention period. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.\n\nOur Services may be used by, or collect personal data about, children under the age of 16 only with the involvement of and, as needed, consent from the child’s parent or guardian. To the extent we process personal data about children, we do so for the purposes described in the consent request and to provide the requested Services.\n\nIf you have reason to believe that we have collected personal data from someone under 16 years of age in connection with our Services without adequate involvement from the child’s parent or guardian, please let us know by contacting us via the methods described under “How to Contact Us.”\n\n1 .

In response, we may provide a list of specific third parties or categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed any personal data, depending on applicable law.\n\nRequest a copy of, port, or transfer your personal data (in some situations, in a specific type of format, such as a structured and commonly used technological format).
