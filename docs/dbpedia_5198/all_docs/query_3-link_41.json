        "text": "What is a passage? To me, it is anything overnight. I am not sure why I categorize it that way, but I do. We could do a 65nm (nm=nautical mile) sail during the day and it would not be a passage. But it becomes a passage if we did the same trip at night. Yep, no logic to my thinking. Most cruisers probably consider a passage to be something longer than 24 hours at sea. A “big” passage is anything longer than 5 days at sea. Now, 5 days does not seem that long in the grand scheme of things. But imagine, being at sea for 5 days and 5 nights, with no proof of life (no birds, fish, land, or boats), and being confined to a space that is 47’ long x 25’ wide while it is being tossed around the sea. Five days becomes an eternity.\n\nAs you can tell, I am not a fan of long passages. I am prone to sea sickness which prevents me from being on the computer (writing) and limits my time on the kindle, phone or any other electronic device. Which makes the day a bit boring? Lucky for me, I did no get sick on this passage despite the sea’s best attempt to make the boat uncomfortable.\n\nIf you were to take an 800-mile road trip (maybe San Antonio to El Paso or San Diego to San Francisco), it would probably take you about 13 hours (avg. speed of 65 mph). Our 800-mile trip took us 5 days and 4 hours to sail. Just a smidge different, right?\n\nLand lubbers (that’s you!) Here is some terminology which might help you understand this blog better.\n\nNM = nautical mile which is 10% more than a regular mile. So, 1.1 nautical miles = 1 mile.\n\nMETERS = We use the metric system on the boat (not imperial). So, when we reference the sea state it will be in meters. A good sea state is >.5 meter or under 1.5’. On this passage we constantly had a sea state of 2+ meters and on some occasions 3 meters (over 9’).\n\nKT or kt = knots which is how we measure the speed of the boat and the wind\n\nSWELL INCREMENTS: Big seas are not “that” bad if they have large increments in between each swell. A longer increment allows the boat to climb and descend nicely. However, when the increments become short, >6 seconds, then it becomes really uncomfortable, lumpy, bumpy, and bashing.\n\nREEF = a reefed main or jib is when we decrease the amount of sail space. For example, in light winds we will have full sail, no reefs. In stronger winds we might go to 1 reef or 2. In really strong winds we will reef up to 3 which means we have the least amount of canvas up before going to bare poles.\n\nWINDS. For this passage, the ideal wind direction is North of East. Anything coming from the South will cause us to turn on the motors or tack a bunch of times. You cannot very well sail into the wind as you need the wind to fill your sails.\n\nInsurance Stipulation\n\nEvery boat insurance policy requires a sail plan where you provide the location and schedule of your boat for the policy period. We submitted our sail plan for April 2019-March 2020 to our insurance company in February 2018 (a long time ago). We received approval to be in the Marquesas for cyclone season as it is “out of the zone.” However, we really wanted to get back to the Gambiers which meant we had to travel 900-miles south during cyclone season. So, we had to get approval from our insurance company to ensure we are covered. The reply was that if we had, and could prove, a safe weather window, we were allowed to go. Great! A safe weather window requires the following:\n\n1. North of East winds (we are heading south so we don’t want south winds)\n\n2. Limited or no squalls\n\n3. Average wind speed below 20kts (preferred)\n\n4. Wind Gusts below 35kt\n\n5. Average waves or swell below 3 meters\n\nWe would have waited for a safe weather window regardless of insurance requirements, because, duh! But, it is nice to have a company that trusts our judgement to sail our boat in safe conditions.\n\nWeather\n\nWe look at several weather sources including Predict Wind (which includes 4 sources) and MaxSea. We can pull a weather report every 12 hours which will give us four different models of the wind, rain, clouds, gusts and waves. Our dearest friend and guardian, Donald pulled MaxSea reports for us daily as well.\n\nPassage Day 2, this is what Predict Wind showed for wind. If you look below the map image, there is a color bar which shows the severity of the wind (left to right). Yellow and green are good, whereas red and dark red are strong winds.\n\nPassage Day 2, this is what Predict Wind showed for rain. You can zoom in on the black box which shows the details of the wind and barometric pressure\n\nPassage Day 2, this is what Predict Wind showed for gusts. Now, it looks horrible with the red and dark red patches, but when you zoom in to the black box with the details you see that the gusts were less than 20kts.\n\nPassage Day 2, this is what Predict Wind showed us for waves. It looks great with a nice beam (on the side) but when you zoom in you can see that they are 1.8m in 7.1 seconds causing a bumpy ride!\n\nTwo Days Prior to the Passage\n\nWe were anchored in Nuku Hiva which is the northern most island in the Marquesas (which is the northernmost archipelago in French Polynesia). We were heading to the Gambiers which is the southernmost archipelago in French Polynesia. So, first we had to head to the southernmost islands in the Marquesas before starting our big passage to the Gambiers. These first two days are not counted toward our actual passage (of 838nm) as we stopped each night making our way south. With that said, we were still at sea, moving and transiting toward our destination.\n\nTransit toward Southern Marquesas\n\nDeparted from Nuku Hiva, Marquesas to Tahuata, Marquesas\n\nOn 13 February, we left at 0500 to begin our 85nm trip to Tahuata. We had big seas with a swell of 2-meters, winds 18-24kts coming North of East. We started out with 1 reef in the main, but added the 2nd reef when winds kept gusting over 25kts. Then the wind shifted directly on to our nose forcing us to motor the last 13nm to the anchorage. We dropped the hook, had dinner and went straight to bed.\n\nTotal miles traveled: 85nm\n\nTotal time traveled: 14.5 hours\n\nDeparted Tahuata, Marquesas to Fatu Hiva, Marqueasas\n\nOn 14 February we left Tahuata at 0700. We slept in a bit as we had less than 50nm to sail today. The seas continued to wreak havoc on us at 2+ meters and we had a current pushing us backwards at .5-1.5 nm. Still strong winds at 20kts N of E with gusts up to 28-30kts. We were double reefed (2 reefs) most of the day.\n\nTotal miles traveled: 46nm\n\nTotal time traveled: 8.5 hours\n\nTune in on 31 March for the continuation of our passage to the Gambiers.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nProvisioning, what is it? You have heard me say a number of times, that we had to provision the boat. What exactly does that mean? You, as a landlubber (yes, that is what we call you), can easily walk or hop in your car and go to the nearest Costco, Super Target, Ralph’s or Randalls to pick up your groceries. You can even pop in a convenience store (7-11) or mini market (gas station) to get basic supplies. Not to mention the farmer’s market to get fresh goods from growers. You are after all in the land of plenty.\n\nHere in the islands, we don’t have those luxuries. I am not complaining, just stating the facts. Almost every island has a “magasin” which is a type of market or grocery store. It is similar to a minimarket or 7-11 and about the same size with twice as much stuff packed into the same amount of space. With the exception of Tahiti, most islands and atolls are limited to what they can store and sell in between deliveries from the supply ships.\n\nSupply Ships\n\nThe number and size of these magasins are dependent on the size of the island, the population, and the number of tourists. Most of the Tuamotu atolls have very small and limited provisions. However, the larger islands like Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa (Marquesas), Mangareva (Gambiers), and Tahiti, Bora Bora (Society) will have more variety.\n\nThe supply ship comes from Tahiti and brings provisions to the outer islands. For example, in Nuku Hiva, the supply ship comes every 2 weeks. However, we visited during the holidays and we ship was here once in 2.5 months!\n\nNuku Hiva Magasins\n\nNuku Hiva is the largest and most populated island in the Marquesas. It has several decent magasins, a produce market, and plenty of fruit bearing trees. We shop for provisions (food, produce, fruit, veg, beverages) at the local magasins, produce market, and buy direct from locals. On very rare occasions, we will pick directly from the trees when they appear to be on public property (not on private land).\n\nSo, what does a local magasin look like? Let me tell you, the Nuku Hiva magasins are above average in size and stock. Good for us, for now! Most have between 3-4 isles, with end caps, frozen area, liquor area, and produce area.\n\nMagasin Celine\n\nThis magasin offers hydroponic lettuce which is a rare treat. It has a super small produce area (see bottom photo in back on red baskets), 2 freezers and plenty of dry goods.\n\nYou might see an entre isle or two of cereal, but here we have a ¼ of an area for cereal. But, you an see we have Special K. They do have an entire isle filled with liquor though.\n\nOne thing we leaned very quickly is that liquor is extremely expensive here. Thank goodness we did not need to purchase any during our year stay. I took some photos of liquor bottles…an easy conversion is to drop the last two digits. So, for example the bottle of Baileys is $49, he Jack Daniels is $86, and the Bombay is $79.\n\nMagasin Kamake\n\nThis magasin has its own bakery and supplies other magasins with fresh baguettes. It is a little more stocked with a different variety of food. They do have an “organic” or “natural” isle which is intriguing.\n\nTheir produce area is actually refrigerated (to make them last longer) and they have a few more freezers of meats.\n\nProduce Market\n\nProvisioning runs always include a search for fresh produce. Nuku Hiva has its own produce market, which is a rare treat! They are open in the mornings from 0530-1130. Each day it differs depending on the local deliveries. The lower left photo is a tasty fruit called pumplemouse which is similar to a grapdefruit.\n\nArtisan Market\n\nAnother wonderful treat is the artisan market. We have only seen an artisan market in a few islands and we have visited well over a hundred throughout French Polynesia! This is where the local artists showcase and sell their crafts. It can include hand-carved marlin bone, necklaces, tapa cloth, hand-carved wood statues and oh so much more.\n\nJewelry, honey, carvings\n\nIn short, provisioning in the islands is a smaller version of shopping in the States. Less variety and quantity, but what do you expect living in a third world country in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? I’m thinking we are pretty darn blessed.\n\nThe economy in the Marquesas is very fragile, but from what we have seen it is still thriving. Provisioning for locals usually consists of their own fresh produce and fish that they catch.\n\nOther Services\n\nNuku Hiva is way advanced compared to most places. They have a very robust recycling program. With all of the provisioning we cruisers do it is nice to know we can recycle our glass, plastic and aluminium.\n\nAll of the post offices are yellow and look the same. Most post offices have an ATM (because there are no banks on smaller islands or atolls) and sell the local cell/data sim cards.\n\nThere is one jail on the island, which was generally used for ‘short stay’ internments such as the last 3 months of sentences and was also often altogether empty. Lately, however, prisoners can opt to do their full sentence here if they have no family on Tahiti, so the Nuku Hiva jail now has inmates all the time.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
