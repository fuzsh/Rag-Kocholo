        "text": "GO. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT!\n\nI have been on 3 Big Fish Expeditions trips by now and have more trips to look forward to in the near future. First of all I share a big passion for sharks, whale and other big marine life and Big Fish Expedition is all about that. As an amateur photographer is great to be among equals and even better to get new tips and ideas from professionals.\n\nAndy is very helpful showing new tricks and talk about UW photography in between dives. Sure the destinations offers world class diving but it’s also about the people and the relation to people and Andy surely gives everyone the feeling of being very welcome and try to give everyone a lifetime experience.\n\nAnother good thing is that Andy is maybe the only pro shooters who offers trips to very reasonable prices. I won’t go into details about all the good dives I’ve done with Big Fish but instead say GO, you will never regret it!\n\nBr, Rasmus Raahauge\n\nDenmark\n\nABSOLUTELY AMAZING TIME WITH BIG FISH EXPEDITIONS\n\nAndy is one of the best in the business. I would highly, highly recommend anyone interested in an animal focused trip to go with big fish expeditions.\n\nThe quality of experience and knowledge of the trip leader really sets them apart. Expect to get your fill of animals no matter what the trip is. Andy is also great at finding other animals to incorporate within the trips.\n\nIf you’re looking for a shark trip or big animal experience, this is your place. Period.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJesse B.\n\nOntario, Canada"
