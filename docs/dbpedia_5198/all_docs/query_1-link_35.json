        "text": "Set on the hillside, in a lush tropical garden, Le Nuku Hiva by Pearl Resorts offers an unobstructed view of Taiohae Bay.\n\nHere, between the ocean and the mountain, the sun sets the pace of the day, deploying the charms of its energizing glow every morning, and the promise of enchanting tomorrows every evening.\n\nThe Lodge and its 20 spacious bungalows will be the ideal base from which to explore the island and its countless treasures.\n\nEach attentively decorated bungalow combines modern comfort and local materials, sculpted or embellished by Marquesan artists.\n\nA pleasant walk will take you to a black, warm sand beach and the small town of Taiohae.\n\nAt the end of the day, from the pool or the bar, relax and let Mother Nature cradle you in its generous embrace.\n\nThe Lodge experience aims to be authentic, laid-back, in harmony with the Marquesan life philosophy.\n\nWelcome ! Kaoha Nui !\n\nLegend says that when the Marquesas were created, each was a piece of a house. Nuku Hiva is the roof of that faraway archipelago.\n\nMade of 12 islands, only six of which are inhabited, the Marquesas Islands' native name is 'Henua Enana' or 'Land of Men'.\n\nNuku Hiva is the largest island (130 sq. miles) and the archipelago's administrative capital.\n\nThe most remote archipelago on the planet is divided in two groups : the Northern group (including Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou and Ua Huka) and the Southern group (including Hiva Oa, Tahuata and Fatu Hiva)\n\nMore than 900 miles north-east of Tahiti, Nuku Hiva is a mystical island hiding many natural wonders, such as the Hakaui waterfall, plunging down a thousand feet.\n\nNature here is raw, and preserved. Encounters with wild horses, goats and boars are common.\n\nMost of the islanders live in the three main villages : Taiohae, Taipivai and Hatiheu. Many live from wood or stone carving, hunting and fishing.\n\nTaiohae is a pretty, small seaside town. It is the administrative, economic and educational center of the Marquesas Islands, with French and Polynesian administrations, police, post office, hospital, city hall, Air Tahiti agency, bank, schools and a few shops.\n\nMave Mai ! Kaoha Nui ! Welcome to the Marquesas !\n\nTime zone : The Marquesas Islands are in a different time zone than the other islands of French Polynesia. You will have to set your watch 30 minutes forward when you arrive from Tahiti.\n\nPopulation : The 2017 census taken by French Polynesia's statistics institute counted 2 951 inhabitants in Nuku Hiva, or 32% of the archipelago's total population.\n\nCurrency: French Pacific Franc XPF (1USD = 105 XPF)\n\nLanguage : The official language is French, as everywhere else in French Polynesia. However, between themselves, locals most often speak Marquesan, which differs from Tahitian. Marquesan is recognized as a regional language of France, and subdivided in two distinct dialects, from the northern and southern groups of islands."
