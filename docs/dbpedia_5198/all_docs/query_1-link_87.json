        "text": "Nuku Hiva Island (aka Nukahiva) is the biggest of the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia (an overseas territory of France in the Pacific). Nuku Hiva (formerly named \"Ile Marchand\" and \"Madison Island\") has population around 3,000 and covers a total area of 339 km2 (131 mi2).\n\nAdministratively, Nuku Hiva is part of the municipality (commune) of Nuku-Hiva, itself in administrative subdivision of Marquesas Islands. Administrative centre of Nuku-Hiva commune and also of the administrative subdivision of Marquesas Islands is Taioha'e, a settlement located on Nuku Hiva's south side, at the head of a bay of the same name.\n\nThe central part of Nuku Hiva Island is a high plateau named To'ovi'i, covered by a tall-grass prairie. Cattle raising experiments are taking place on it for the first time. Fifteen years ago the cattle here were feral and had to be hunted with rifles. The island's highest peak, Tekao (1224 m / 4016 ft) rises on the western edge of To'ovi'i. The northern and western edges of Toovii are a mountain ridge, catching much of the rain which waters Nuku Hiva Island.\n\nTypee (book by Herman Melville) is based on his experiences in Taipivai Valley (Nuku Hiva's eastern part). The first landfall of Robert Louis Stevenson on his voyage on Casco was at Hatiheu, on the north side of the island, in 1888. In 2001, Nuku Hiva Island was used as the filming location for the 4th season of 'Survivor', American reality competition series, airing in the USA in 2002. Ben Fogle, British explorer and presenter, in 2015 filmed an episode of 'Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild' with a nomadic couple residing on a boat, moored off Nuku Hiva Island at the time of his visit.
