        "text": "Upon Pick up you will drive to Taiohae, the capital of the Marquesas is a quiet city set on the bay and surrounded by rocky cliffs. Taiohe is home to more than half the population of Nuku Hiva and is a pretty city of black-sand beaches, tropical blooms, and a distinctly French ambiance. The center of town is easily explored on foot. Be sure to visit Notre Dame Cathedral, displaying stone and wood carvings from each island of the archipelago. Another highlight is a wooden statue of Herman Melville, who based two novels (Typee and Omoo) on his stay in the Taipivai Valley. The waterfront features plenty of tiki statues including the Temehea Tohua, featuring an almost extraterrestrial visage.\n\nContinue to Taipivai valley, a lush mountain scenery tumbling down to Controlleur Bay characterize this valley where Moby Dick author Herman Melville was held captive for three weeks. Little remains of the village that inspired two novels, but the ride alone is enthralling for its spectacular vistas of the coastline, bays, and valleys, and the valley itself is one of the richest archaeological sites in the Marquesas Islands.\n\nVisit the Hatiheu, a picturesque village on the shores of Hatiheu Bay. A statue of the Virgin Mary presides over the village thousands of feet up at the top of a towering cliff set against a curving black-sand beach. Visit the acheorlogical sites of Hikokua, Kamuihei, Tahakia and Teiipoka. Discovered in 1957, a cluster of archeological sites near Hatiheu were used for ancient festivals, rituals and human sacrifice. Framed by the steep cliffs of Hatiheu, traverse among giant banyan trees, ancient stones and tiki while you marvel at the majesticness of it all."
