        "text": "Boundaries\n\nLocated 1370 km from Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands (7-10° S, 138-140° W) comprise the northernmost islands within French Polynesia in the South Pacific Ocean. The largest islands in the group include Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa, and Ua Pou.\n\nTopography\n\nThe Marquesas Islands are largely high volcanic islands, with only two that are atolls with sandy islets. The topography of the volcanic islands is characterized by narrow and deep valleys, steep dissected coastlines, high plateaus, and rugged mountains, with the highest peak being Mount Oave (1230 m asl) on the island of Ua Pou.\n\nFreshwater habitats\n\nThe islands include perennial rivers like the Hakaui, Taipivai, and Hatiheu on Nuku Hiva. There are also numerous intermittent streams during the rainy season.\n\nTerrestrial habitats\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion defined by WWF for the Marquesas Islands is Marquesas tropical moist forests [OCO108].\n\nDescription of endemic fishes\n\nMore than 40% of the fish species are endemic to this ecoregion. All are gobiids, and include such species as Lentipes rubrofasciatus, Sicyopterus marquesensis, Sicyopus bitaeniatus, Stenogobius caudimaculosus, Stenogobius marqueti, Stenogobius squamosus, and Stiphodon tuivi.\n\nJustification for delineation\n\nThe Marquesas Islands ecoregion was defined on the basis of distinctive (endemic or near-endemic) fish faunas. Regional species sources included Keith et al. (2002)."
