        "text": "Nuku Hiva, the Land of Men!\n\nNuku Hiva is the largest island in the Marquesas Archipelago, both in size and population. It is 1400 kms away from Tahiti. Like the rest of the archipelago, it is a volcanic island formed by the emerging ridges of volcanoes that have been extinct for millions of years.\n\nIts relief is made up of basalt peaks a hundred meters high. Its highest point is the Mount Tekao with its 1,224 meters. The main village is Taiohae, located at the bottom of the bay of the same name.\n\nTaiohae is the center of the economic and administrative life of the archipelago.\n\nIn Nuku Hiva, it is a grandiose and mystical landscape that stands before your eyes: vertiginous peaks, steep cliffs, green trails that match the blue color of the Pacific Ocean, breathtaking waterfalls, archaeological remains, a culture rich in history and magical legends. So many treasures to discover among a welcoming and warm people who live very close to its traditions!\n\nMarquesians take pride in their traditional culture – through arts and crafts such as sculpting or tattooing. Spectacular in her unique way, Nuku Hiva will undoubtedly touch and mesmerize you, that’s for sure!\n\nNuku Hiva is a preserved island that offers magical archaeological and natural sites.\n\nTAHITI EXPERIENCES recommends to choose a native guide of the island to assist you throughout your discoveries.\n\nYour private guide will be proud and honored to share the treasures of his lands, such as the impressive Kamuihei Valley that will take you on a journey back to his ancestors’ way of life, or discover the magical waterfalls running down the cliffs.\n\nHakaui is the third tallest waterfall in the world, starting at 350 meters from the ground. The Anaho Bay is also a gift of nature with its surprising and majestic white sand beaches, accessible only by foot or boat, from the charming little village of Hatiheu.\n\nExplore Taipivai, one of the most fertile and green valleys on the island. It offers several waterfalls as well as the enigmatic site of Puake, one of the most beautiful archaeological sites on the island with many “Tiki” – wooden or stone carving representing half-human, half-god ancestors – that can reach 1.70 meters in height.\n\nDiscover Taiohae, a quiet little village nestled at the bottom of a spectacular bay, protected by two rocky massifs where the landscape is both exotic and charming. Long black sand beaches with trees planted all along make it a great place to walk around.\n\nIt is very common to come across proud horseback riders who, just like before, still use horse as their primary mode of ground transportation.\n\nAmong the must-sees: the majestic Notre Dame Cathedral of the Marquesas Islands, the He’e Tai Inn Museum and several monuments including the stele of Herman Melville, which made the island famous thanks to his novel “Taipi”.\n\nFeel free to choose your activities with the expertise of local professionals. Interested in water activities, choose between a fishing trip or a diving sessions. And for the land explorers, choose among a 4×4 safari, hiking or horseback riding – just make your choice!"
