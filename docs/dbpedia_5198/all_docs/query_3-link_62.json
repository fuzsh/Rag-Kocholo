        "text": "Transfers\n\nNuku Hiva airport, called Nuku A Taha, or \"Deserted Land\", lies on the northwest coast of the island, approximately 2 hours by car from the different villages.\n\nAir Tahiti FBO can organise your transfer to your final destination.\n\nOpening hours and control tower\n\nBecause the airport has no runway lights, its opening hours depend on the sunrise and sunset.\n\nFor further information, please contact us directly.\n\nCommunication with the control tower is in French only. If you do not speak French, we will arrange you a departure from Tahiti with a French-speaking cabin crew member that will allow you to communicate with the control tower.\n\nAircraft parking\n\nThe aircraft parking area accommodates a single machine.\n\nBookings are therefore strongly recommended.\n\nFuel\n\nJet-A1 refueling is possible on Nuku Hiva, but you will need to put in a prior request, as there is only a limited quantity of fuel available on the island.\n\nRestricted operating weight(payload)\n\nGiven the specificities of the runway of Nuku Hiva, heavier aircrafts are subject to an operating weigth restriction for landing there.\n\nThis applies in particular to Gulfstream IV (GLF4) and Bombardier Global Express (GLEX) machines."
