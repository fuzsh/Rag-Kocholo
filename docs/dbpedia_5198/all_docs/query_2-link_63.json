        "text": "We pulled into Taiohae Bay after dark and dropped anchor out beyond the boats in fifty-five feet of water. Way deeper than I’d normally like, but it’s a muddy bottom and there wasn’t much wind, so we’d worry about getting into a better spot the next day.\n\nIn the morning Ali got cranking on some laundry while I headed to town to try and track down a water pump. Fortunately, the marine chandlery that is now here on the island is incredibly well stocked and they had a pump in stock. Back at the boat we were right back in business with running water again. I noticed at the chandlery that on the shelf above the pump they had dozens of pump switches, confirming to me that it isn’t the pumps that go bad, it’s the auto-switches. I’ll get the part numbers for our broken pumps and get those working again. Soon I’ll have so many water pump spares around I’ll have to get rid of some to conserve weight onboard.\n\nIn town I also stopped off at the mayor’s office to pay my garbage disposal fee. For about $7/mo they provide us cruisers with a convenient place to dump our garbage. Such a nice solution to such a big problem. I can’t imagine that dealing with the garbage from hundreds of boats each year is much fun for an island to take care of. Everyone who visits here seems to comment on how clean it is, too.\n\nWe got resituated in a much prettier spot a few hundred yards closer to the beach.\n\nNuku-Hiva is the epicenter of the Marquesas. The biggest town, Taiohae, with a population of about 2,200, combined with a huge protected bay, make it a popular spot.\n\nThe waterfront is lined with shady trees and a nice sidewalk. We quickly found our preferred hang out spot and would spend hours there every afternoon from then on.\n\nI’d brush this guy off of me, and a minute later he’d be right back again.\n\nAt low tide it can be a little tricky to load back into the dinghy.\n\nOne day on the boat Lowe said, “Wait, there’s snow at the top of the mountains?” I turned around to see what the heck he was talking about, and my eyes saw it too. Rocky, snowcapped peaks, or a canopy of trees, what does your eye see first?\n\nWe have different dog friends every single day. This one walks with a sideways limp, but is so happy he can’t seem to stop his entire body from shaking with his tail.\n\nI was very happy to find a spare battcar connector in amongst the various bits and bobs on the boat. I was able to repair the mainsail easily, and replaced all the lines that attach the battcars that are in-between these ones.\n\nWe’ve fallen into such an afternoon routine that we even remember to bring our own spoons for the ice cream, and coozies for the beer.\n\nMaybe our eyese are just going bad, but every time we looked over at our bags we would see this sneaky creature coming down the tree eyeballing our stuff.\n\nAnd yes, that’s a can of dog food. That’s also become part of the afternoon routine.\n\nThis really is a nice place to hang out for a while. I’ve got a new alternator on the way, and a handful of other projects I’m working on in the meantime.\n\nThe refrigerator power consumption remains top of the to-do list. Because this one is easy to pull out of its cabinet it was the first one to get tackled. Once it was out I was able to see just how much it was running. The compressor would cycle on for :30 – :36 seconds, and then cycle off for :15 seconds. An absolutely ridiculous cycle for a refrigerator to run at, and the reason why our power consumption has been so insane.\n\nI contacted Isotherm directly for some help, and while they would reply to my emails they wouldn’t answer my direct questions or really provide ANY helpful advice whatsoever. They told me, “It’s hard to get in-depth with trouble-shooting without the unit being here.” Really? Is it? These are not rocketships.\n\nI checked voltages, fiddled around with wiring, and anything else I could think of for two days, but nothing helped. But answers to problems like this always seem to come to me eventually. As I was lying in bed one night thinking it through it occurred to me that the thermostat probe was just dangling off of the ceiling of the fridge in mid-air. I remembered that on our Grand Banks refrigerators the probe had a specific slot that held it tight against the cold-plate. In the morning I looked in again and sure enough, there was a spot for the thermostat probe to slip right into. It looked like someone had replaced the thermostat at some point, but simply not finished the job correctly. I slid the thermostat in the right place, adjusted the temperature, set the stopwatch, and held my breath. The fridge ran for six minutes, then shut off. And then it stayed off for twelve full minutes. Ran again for six. Off for twelve. Problem solved. During the heat of the day the fridge now runs 1/3 of the time, with only about 3 cycles per hour versus ~70 cycles previously. That is a massive power savings.\n\nThat solves one fridge. Now I’ve got another fridge, and a freezer, to tackle. Hopefully these have the same problem.\n\nLooking out at the entrance to Taohaie Bay on Nuku-Hiva.\n\nBumfuzzle at anchor.\n\nThe perception of what it is like to sail across the Pacific and anchor your boat in the Marquesas Islands.\n\nThe reality of anchoring in the Marquesas Islands.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there is plenty of space for everyone here in the Marquesas. It is, however, a good reminder for us world cruisers that we aren’t quite as unique as we sometimes fancy ourselves."
