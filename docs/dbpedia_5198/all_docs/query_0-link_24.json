        "text": "Mangareva is the largest of the coral islands in the Gambiers, ringed by smaller islets and atolls like Aukena, Akamaru and Taravai. The island is marked by a fabulously blue lagoon with crystal clear waters and densely forested volcanic mountains.\n\nTubuai is the capital of the Austral Islands, and also the largest among all seven islands of the archipelago. Its coral reefs, fertile green plains, gently rolling hills, and cool climate make Tubuai the fruit and vegetable orchard of this group of islands.\n\nHiva Oa, the second largest of the Marquesas Islands, has been attracting artistic souls down the years for a reason. Find out what made Paul Gauguin paint some of his best works on the island, or what inspired Jacques Brel to compose his final music album here.\n\nFakarava is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve for numerous rare species of birds, plants and crustaceans in French Polynesia. This protected coral atoll and natural reserve is the second largest coral reef of the Tuamotu Islands, to the south of Rangiroa.\n\nRangiroa is one of the largest atolls on the world. Part of the Tuamotus Islands, this is big sky country, unlike its more rugged and mountainous sisters among the French Polynesian islands.\n\nMaupiti is every traveler’s dream of a picture-postcard tropical island come true. It is a ravishing coral island, fringed by little volcanic islets bound together by sand bars, coral reefs, and swaying palms.\n\nHuahine, the cradle of ancient Polynesian culture, is a tropical paradise of incredible scenic beauty. A 40-minute flight from Tahiti, Huahine is home to many archeological sites, pristine beaches, lush forests and quaint villages with friendly locals.\n\nTetiaroa will cast its spell on you instantly. It is a tiny secluded atoll in the Windward group of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, 30 miles north of Tahiti. It is composed of a ring of thirteen islets, surrounded by a glittering lagoon and protected by a coral reef.\n\nRaiatea, the second largest of the Society Islands after Tahiti, is located just 45-minutes by air from Papeete. True to its name, this island is indeed a slice of “faraway heaven” and was once the cultural and religious center of the islands."
