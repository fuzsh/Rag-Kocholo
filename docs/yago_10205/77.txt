Frederick William IV of Prussia and his wife Elisabeth ludovika of Bavaria were married in 1823 and otl had no children. They were seemingly devoted to one another and there is no record that I can find that states that Fred had a mistress or any illegitimate children.

Therefore my question is this what consequences could there have been if they'd had the following kids:

Frederick William (b. 1824)

Elisabeth (b 1827)

Henry (b.1830)
