        "text": "Duchess Helene in Bavaria (April 4, 1834 – May 16, 1890), nicknamed Néné, was the Hereditary Princess of Thurn and Taxis as the wife of Prince Maximilian of Thurn and Taxis.\n\nShe was a Duchess in Bavaria by birth as the daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika of Bavaria.\n\nFamily\n\nDuchess Helene in Bavaria’s father, Duke Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (4 December 4, 1808 – November 15, 1888), known informally as Max in Bayern, was a member of a junior branch of the royal House of Wittelsbach who were Kings of Bavaria. He is most famous today as the father of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (“Sisi”) and great-grandfather of King Leopold III of the Belgians.\n\nDuke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria was born at Bamberg, the only son of Duke Pius August in Bavaria (1786–1837) and his wife, Princess Amélie Louise of Arenberg (1789–1823). On September 9, 1828, at Tegernsee, Duke Maximilian Joseph married Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, the sixth daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, his father’s cousin. They had ten children.\n\nPrincess Amélie Louise of Arenberg was the only daughter of Prince Louis of Arenberg (1757–1795) and his first wife, Marie Adélaïde Julie de Mailly-Nesle, Dame d’Ivry-sur-Seine (1766–1789).\n\nPrincess Ludovika of Bavaria was born to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden as their fifth child. The birth of Princess Ludovika was known to be difficult. Ludovika was christened one day after her birth as Ludovika Wilhelmine.\n\nLudovika and her sisters received many lessons in literature as well as geography and history. They both spoke German and French.\n\nPrincess Caroline of Baden was the eldest child of Prince Charles Ludwig, Hereditary Prince of Baden, and his wife Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was born 13 July 1776, twin sister of Katharina Amalie Christiane Luise.\n\nPrincess Caroline was considered as a bride for Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, but the fear of attracting opposition from France made her family hesitate.\n\nMarriage prospects\n\nIn 1853 Princess Helene in Bavaria traveled with her mother, Ludovika, and her younger sister Elisabeth to Bad Ischl, Upper Austria for the birthday of her cousin, Franz Joseph I, then the Emperor of Austria. During this visit, Franz Joseph asked for Elisabeth’s hand in marriage.\n\nHistorical accounts often contain the assertion that according to a plan by the two mothers, Franz Joseph was to be engaged to Helene instead. However, recent source investigations have shown that there is no written evidence to support this claim. Neither in the correspondence of Archduchess Sophie nor in the surviving correspondence of Duchess Ludovika are there indications of a planned engagement in Bad Ischl.\n\nBy 22 years old, Helene was not yet married, and Ludovika became concerned that her incredibly pious daughter would take the veil and join a convent. Therefore, Ludovika arranged for her to meet the wealthy Maximilian Anton, Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Duke Maximillian Joseph, Helene’s father, invited the Thurn and Taxis family to Possenhofen for a hunting party, at which Prince Maximilian was introduced to Helene.\n\nMaximilian was born on 28 September 1831 in Regensburg, Kingdom of Bavaria to Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis and Baroness Wilhelmine of Dörnberg.\n\nWhile the prince was vacationing at Possenhofen, he brought his marriage plans to his parents, who immediately agreed. The only difficulty involved was that, although the Thurn and Taxis family were counted among the richest in the land, they were not considered social equals for a princess of royal blood and a member of the House of Wittelsbach. Because of this, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, who was a cousin of Helene, did not at first agree to a marriage between the two, but through Elisabeth’s influence on the king, the marriage took place nevertheless.\n\nMarriage (1858)"
