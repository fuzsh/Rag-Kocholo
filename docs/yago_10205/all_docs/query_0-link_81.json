        "text": "Reports may possibly reach Your Lordship of disturbances in this Capital, and as more importance may be attached to them than they deserve, I beg leave to enclose the Berlin State Gazette of the 19th Instant from which you will find that the little that has passed here has arisen principally from the misconduct of a Police Officer upon the occasion of a trifling quarrel between some of the lower Classes in the neighbourhood of the Royal Palace in the evening of the 16th. A report was spread on the following day that the Palace would be attacked by the Populace in consequence of which a crowd collected before dark in that quarter but from its general description evidently more from motives of curiosity than from any other. Half the Garrison was however immediately ordered out, the crowd increased, and in the confusion and attempts of the Soldiers to disperse the People several well dressed Persons received Sabre and bayonet wounds. No Symptoms of disaffection were shewn except a few hisses from boys and some of the lower Classes, twenty or thirty of whom were arrested. After eleven O'Clock not a soul was seen in the streets except the Military.\n\n117 The Verein für die Besserung der Strafgefangenen (Association for the Amelioration of Delinquents) was founded by members of the Prussian administration in Berlin at the end of 1826. The association was supposed to ‘improve’ delinquents and turn them into ‘pious and useful citizens’. On 10 September 1828 its statutes were approved by the Prussian Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Justice. The papers mentioned by Russell were transferred to the Home Office and are not extant in FO 64/221.\n\n195 Westmorland is referring here to the promise of a constitution in 1815, and its confirmation in 1821 and 1823. The Order of Cabinet of 11 June 1821 and the Gesetz wegen Anordnung der Provinzjahtände of 1823 followed the vague statement in the National Debt Law of 1820, in which the convocation of a national diet was dependent upon a further decision by the King; cf. nn. 141, 180 in this section.\n\n223 The Friends of Light, a free-religious movement that had existed since 1841, held the view that the Bible was not the only valid norm of Christianity. Religious selfdetermination should take the place of the orthodox belief in the Revelation. As precursors of liberalism within the church, and indeed as proponents of liberal and democratic ideas in the political sphere, they attracted quite a following. Their meetings were banned by the Prussian government in 1845.\n\n248 Enclosures: 1. King of Prussia's Message to the United Diet concerning the interpretation of Paragraphs of Ordinances of 3rd of February 1847 respecting loans, Berlin 24 June 1847; 2. King of Prussia's Message to the United Diet relative to Petitions for changes in the Patent & Ordinances of the 3rd of February 1847, Berlin 24 June 1847; 3. King of Prussia's Message to the United Diet concerning its close on the 26th instant, Berlin 24 June 1847; 4. Translation of No. 1; 5. Translation of No. 2; 6. Translation of No. 3.\n\n252 The first chamber (chamber of peers) agreed to the periodical assembly of the diet, with the proviso that the king himself must decide how long the periods between sessions should be. The first chamber also agreed to reduce the authority of the United Committee of the States, which was supposed to continue the work of the diet once its sitting was over. Moreover, the election of the United Committee was to be postponed. However, the proposal by the second chamber that the United Committee be abolished altogether did not gain a majority."
