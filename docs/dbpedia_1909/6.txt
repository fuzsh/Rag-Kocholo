Would anyone on here be able to help me out with a good set of Cumbia songs that'll sure get them on the dance floor.

Really appreciate it.

Also, I was asked for a bunch of "Mexican" songs this evening as well. Other than the mexican hat dance, what are some similar songs for the mexican style they will dance too.

laugh, but there's been plenty of nights when it packs the floor full of ladies wiggling their butts to that song. and i spent a bit of time in the Rio Grande valley - high school during the day and clubs across the river in Reynosa all night.

Thanx caliente,

At that party at the Mexican Restaurant in N.E. USA, there were Mexicans that seem to have friends there that were requesting "Cumbia", then the Mexicans would come up and say "Do you have any Mexican Music". I'm like, I need folders one for Mexican, salsa, Merengue, and Cumbia, and Nortenas, and maybe more.

Just want to separate the Mexican stuff from the Cumbia Stuff right now?
