Let’s be honest, a party isn’t a party unless there is some cumbia playing. The rhythm is infectious enough to call everyone— even a couple of spirits—to the dance floor. And at this point, cumbia is a global force that’s snaked its way through all of Latin America from its origin in the Caribbean Coast of Colombia. As time and taste have evolved, Colombian cumbia has shifted into techno cumbia, cumbia sonidero, chicha, and so much more.

Luckily for those of us leaning into the spooky vibes of the holiday, there are plenty of creepy cumbias to pull out this Halloween. We’ve got you covered whether you’re two-stepping on a patio, house party, or just alone in your living room.

Hoping to make contact with some extraterrestrials? The Meridian Brothers know the way. Looking to summon powerful spirits from the great beyond? Grupo Jejeje’s cumbias rebajadas are for you. If keeping it classic is your jam, then Grupo Lazima is your best bet for a Latine spin on the quintessential slasher boogeyman. And if you like your cumbia better suited for the monthly goth night, La MiniTK del Miedo has something for you.
