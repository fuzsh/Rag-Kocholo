        "text": "March 31, 2022 will mark 27 years since the late Tejano superstar Selena Quintanilla-Perez was tragically murdered by a former employee at age 23. For the past three decades, fans of Selena have immortalized their fallen icon and kept her legendary catalog of cumbias, conjuntos, rancheras, and Latin pop songs alive. They cherish fond memories of her glittering stage outfits, dazzling smile, infectious laugh, sultry dance moves, and larger-than-life persona. They admire her kind, joyful spirit and her dedication to being a role model for children and honoring her Mexican-American identity.\n\nNow, fans will have even more of Selena’s legacy.\n\n/*! elementor – v3.7.8 – 02-10-2022 */\n\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=”.svg”]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}\n\nAbraham Quintanilla, the singer’s father, announced last week that a new posthumous album of previously unheard material will be released in April 2022. The album will feature over a dozen tracks featuring digitally enhanced vocals and remixes of Selena’s best-known hits.\n\n“What’s unique about it is not only the music, completely new arrangements, but my son worked on Selena’s voice with the computers. And if you listen to it, she sounds on this record like she did right before she passed away,” Abraham said in an interview with Latin Groove News.\n\nSimilar to albums released during the singer’s life, Selena’s brother A.B. Quintanilla III served as the producer of the album. In a recent interview with Tino Cochino Radio, A.B. revealed more details about the production of Selena’s vocals.\n\n“We were able to detune her voice to make her sound older than what she was. So, she was 14 or 15, but we were able to make her sound like she just stepped out of the booth at 23 years old,” he explained.\n\nSuzette Quintanilla, Selena’s sister and former drummer of their band Selena y los Dinos, is designing the album’s artwork, making the project even more of a family affair.\n\nNot all Selena fans are in favor of the new release, however, with some accusing the Quintanillas of trying to profit off the singer’s death. Regardless, any opportunity to hear Selena’s voice is exciting and will surely serve as a reminder of her undeniable talent and potential.\n\nWhile we eagerly await this new release from the Queen of Tejano Music, check out Selena’s highly acclaimed 1994 album, Amor Prohibido."
