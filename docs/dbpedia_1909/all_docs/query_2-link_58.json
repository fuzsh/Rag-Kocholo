        "text": "The legacy of Selena Quintanilla PÃ©rez continues to live on nearly thirty years after her untimely passing. Born on April 16th, 1971, Selena's musical journey began as a child when she would perform at her father's restaurant Papa Gayo's, where her talent was immediately noticed. From a professional standpoint, Selena's music career kicked off with the formation of the band Selena y Los Dinos, who would frequently tour along with performing locally in Selena's hometown of Texas, gaining popularity through the years. What followed was a burst of popularity and success for the singer in which she earned the title \"Queen of Tejano music,\" selling millions of records worldwide as people clamored to hear increasingly popular music. Today we'll be taking a look at the best Selena Quintanilla songs of all time in honor of her legacy.\n\nWhile Selena started off only making Tejano music, she was began to experiment with R&B in the 1990s. Aside from her music career, Selena also became a commercial success landing major endorsements such as her legendary deal with Coca-Cola. Unfortunately Selena's life would tragically end early at the age of 23, but the incredible songs and performances she gave us in her short time here have not only withstood the test of time, but continues to grow with each new generation.\n\nRELATED: The 15 Best NSYNC Songs, Ranked\n\nFrom: Amor Prohibido (1994)\n\nReleased in July 1994, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a pop song with a little bit of rock, a little bit of reggae, and a lot of history. Selena's performance of the song at the 1995 Astrodome is regarded as one of the highlights of her career, and the song itself as both the Best Texas Songs of All Time, and one of the best Tejano recordings of all time. In the years since her passing, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has gone to become a song of remembrance for Selena fans."
