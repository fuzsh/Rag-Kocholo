        "text": "The best part of a Monday is that a brand new weekend is just 5 days away! That might be “pushing it” for some, but it’s a true statement whether you agree with it or not. Once Friday is over, a fresh new weekend will be upon us. I guess what I’m trying to say is that there is no room for complaining that today is Monday again and that our weekend is over. Just work hard in whatever it is that you do Monday through Friday…. and eventually the weekend will be back! (Coffee and micheladas are very helpful in the meantime.)\n\nDancing is also a great way to cope with anything that comes your way throughout the work week. There is nothing like having a dance session and just letting the music take control of your body! Since we are in the last week of National Hispanic Heritage Month, our MICHE MIX OF THE WEEK is made up of epic songs that mothers and tías would most likely enjoy jamming out to during their Zumba class or any type of dance/workout session. It’s a mix that will make it impossible to just stay seated or stand motionless next to a wall. You will be up on your feet ready to hit the dance floor. All these songs are señora approved. (¡Un saludo especial a todas las abuelitas, mamás y tías que nos obligaban a bailar en las fiestas familiares!)\n\nThe musical genres featured in this playlist include: salsa, cumbia, merengue, bachata, quebradita and pop that should all be part of any dance session. Some of the songs are silly and just take you back in time. All of them are hits that should be played and replayed forever. If you ever need a boost of energy and happiness, this playlist will make it happen.\n\nIf anyone knows of a Zumba class that plays this type of music, let us know so that we can sign up immediately. Getting a workout in while dancing to fun music is the thing to do, people!\n\nAll this dancing will most likely leave you thirsty and dehydrated. Make sure you take a few sips of water if available. If not, the next best thing is an ice cold michelada. It’s never too early in the week to pair your favorite beer or sparkling water with any of our “I Love Micheladas” mixes! You can make your own by visiting your local latino supermarkets to buy our 32 oz bottles there or by purchasing online at www.ILoveMicheladas.com. (Our 32 oz bottles are now now available at all Food 4 Less stores!!!) Once you have our mix, preparing the michelada is one of the easiest things on earth. All you have to do is prepare the rim of your favorite cup with lemon/Tajín/chamoy, open the bottle of our “I Love Micheladas” mix, pour it into your cup, pour your favorite beer/sparkling water, mix it all and enjoy. It seriously can’t get any easier. Make sure to tag us on your “I Love Micheladas” creations on Instagram and Facebook using @ilovemicheladas!\n\nNow that you have the perfect michelada and the perfect playlist for your Zumba session… you are ready for an amazing time! (Feel free to tell your instructors to use this playlist instead of their boring music!) Let’s get our dancing session started in 3, 2, 1…… ¡¡A BAILAR SE HA DICHO!!"
