I have been looking for it ever since it came out. It's an amazing song.\n\nIt's still so sad that she's no longer with us. :'(\n\nPost by Twiloboy on\n\nYou are amazing. Thank you so much. Just a few days ago, I got out my cd/dvd of her greatest hits. Great stuff.\n\nI hope that her last concert includes Coma La Flor. That was amazing live.\n\nPeace,\n\nBen\n\nPost by Spoken Word on\n\nGood remixes - she also had some decent remixes from Morales and Tony Moran for \"A Boy Like That\" and \"I'm Getting Used To You\". I also think she had remixes out for is Is It The Beat? (Enamorada English Version)\n\nPost by Zetroc Rodama on\n\nWow, I didn't know you guys liked Selena? I have the other promos for \"I'm Getting Used To You\", A Boy Like That\", \"Is It The Beat?\", and \"Techno Cumbia\". All of them Have Remixes on them, it's amazing how a few of her songs have been Remixed. Selena herself said she thought the whole idea of Remixing songs was \"Cool\" how she could do a ballad and then have it Remixed and be all \"Funky\"... I'll post them ASAP today! :)\n\nPost by Fool_4_Music on\n\nWow. I can't believe it's been 10 years since Selena passed. It doesn't seem that long ago. Thanks for posting this!\n\nPost by Spoken Word on\n\nIs It The Beat? and Techno Cumbia would be interesting to hear. I have the Brazilian Nut Re-Mix somewhere and always liked that. I didn't know there was a promo out of just that song. I've seen the Brazilian remix on a promo with Dreaming Of You before.\n\nPost by Zetroc Rodama on\n\nYeah, the promo is \"Techno Cumbia/Dreaming Of You\". The promo I have is from Mexico, I'm uploading the songs right now...\n\nPost by Spoken Word on\n\nThe new remix for Baila Esta Cumbia is out now. It's actually now called Baila Esta Kumbia and its remixed by the Kumbia Kings (her brother and his bandmates)\n\nPost by strong4PMB! on\n\nHector said:\n\nWow!! Thanks so much for posting these. It's so hard to find them\n\nPost by 620 Soul Train on\n\nThank you for sharing, I think my sister has my mini-broadcast of this song reaching number one on my personal chart in 1997. I have the single that I bought at Target as a bonus CD for buying the soundtrack the J.Lo movie \"Selena\". Rick Dees played this as an extra as well on his weekly top 40 show.\n\nPost by Zetroc Rodama on\n\nCool!!! You know what, when this song was released I was in Junior High and I wanted the Remixes so much, and I didnt have the DJ connections that I do now. So I saved all of my money and bought the promo off of Ebay for $80 and after I sent the money I saw that Target was selling the Soundtrack with the promo as a bonus CD fo $14!!! And I had the worst case of buyers remorse and I tried getting my money back but I didnt but its all good. Now I have three of those promos, 1 Mexican Promo, 1 Red Vinyl, and the 1 I paid $80..."
