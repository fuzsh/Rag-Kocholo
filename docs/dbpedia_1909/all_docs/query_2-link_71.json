        "text": "Background and Production\n\n\"Techno Cumbia\" was one of the first songs composed for Selena's fifth studio album, Amor prohibido (1994), and was included in the crossover attempt on Dreaming of You (1995). It was written by Selena's brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla III, backup singer Pete Astudillo, lead keyboardist Ricky Vela and produced by Quintanilla and Brian \"Red\" Moore, a family friend, who helped with audio mixing. \"Techno Cumbia\" was written during the Selena Live! Tour (1993â€“94) and was inspired by Los Dinos band member Astudillo, who wrote down the concept of the song. Quintanilla later wanted it to be a cumbia song mixed with techno. He also believed that Selena was the first artist to sing a \"Techno-Cumbia\" song mixed with R&B, blues and funk influences. Selena recorded the song at Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas, her father Abraham Quintanilla Jr's record studio.\n\nRecording and production of the single took under 24 hours to complete. Selena insisted that she should rap in the opening of the song, which was not planned. In the recording studio, Los Dinos performed back-up vocals while Quintanilla performed a rap verse during the bridge."
