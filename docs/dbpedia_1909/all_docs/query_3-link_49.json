        "text": "They are designed by the same graphic designer who is behind the album art for Charm, the latest LP from our Issue 157 cover star.\n\nCrack Magazine has teamed up with American singer and songwriter Clairo (real name Claire Cottrill) to offer 100 exclusive pins to our Supporters.\n\nMade of soft enamel, the bunny pins are designed by Bijan Berahimi, who was also responsible for the graphic design on the album cover of Charm, Clairo’s third and most recent LP. The pins will be available to new and existing Crack Supporters for free (excluding shipping).\n\nClairo covered our July issue of Crack Magazine. In our interview with her, she examined her maturing sound. “Charm is a feeling you have. When you’re charmed, it’s that perfect blend of being goofy-eyed over a person – platonically, romantically – and not knowing how long it will last,” she said of the LP’s name.
