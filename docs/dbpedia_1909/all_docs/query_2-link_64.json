        "text": "Selena Quintanilla fans got a sneak peek of the entire MAC Cosmetics collection honoring the “Queen of Tex-Mex.”\n\nSelena Quintanilla’s 15 Most Memorable Lyrics\n\nVia Periscope, Selena’s sister Suzette Quintanilla unveiled the collection that includes lipsticks, eye-shadows, foundation, brushes and other makeup wear. “A lot of you thought it would only be a lipstick but it’s actually a full collection,” said Suzette who helped curate the makeup line with MAC.\n\n“I want to go over some of the [lipstick] colors that I feel embody my sister Selena and her look. The ‘Como La Flor’ lipstick is a beautiful red-tone color, a signature color that my sister would wear when performing onstage. There is a deeper tone that Selena loved to wear called ‘Dreaming of You’ and ‘Amor Prohibido’ is a nude tone lipstick.”\n\nSelena Quintanilla‘s Family Shares Previously Unreleased Track: Listen\n\nOther eye-shadow hues and a blush/foundation duo are also named after Selena hits like “Fotos y recuerdos” and “Techno cumbia.” The MAC Selena multi-product collection is due in October.\n\nTrending on Billboard"
