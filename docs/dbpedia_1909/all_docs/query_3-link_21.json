        "text": "It was 1 a.m., and Thursday night had become Friday morning when Anthony Dominguez, known around the New York City D.J. scene as hellotones, took the stage at the Market Hotel, a club in a 19th-century building whose windows look directly on the elevated J and M trains passing through Bushwick, Brooklyn.\n\nThe theme of the evening was “experimental Latin sounds,” and arriving at his console, Mr. Dominguez unleashed a thunderous bass. Then came the beat, from a metal comb scraping a ridged, hollow tube, known as the guacharaca: chik-chika-chik-chika-chik, repeating over and over.\n\nMr. Dominguez, who was born in New York to Mexican parents, spins remixed cumbias, a riff on the indigenous and Afro-Colombian tropical genre that has inspired countless interpretations across Latin America. His sets are what he calls “a party mix bag of chips,” and he often digs deep into the past and has recently found “a beautiful pocket of Argentinian cumbia.”\n\nBut the sounds Mr. Dominguez produces from the booth also represent a new kind of cumbia, remixed for a new audience. Mr. Dominguez still relies on tracks by Mexican cumbia groups such as Los Daddys, which resonate with the generation born after their Mexican parents settled in the city in the late 1980s, like Mr. Dominguez’s father. But he also drops in samples of dreamy synthesizers and hip-hop."
