        "text": "The best techno DJs have been lighting up the club and festival scene for decades while helping to establish the genre and reach millions of fans.\n\nFrom the founders of the scene in the 1980s to relative newcomers who’ve reshaped techno for modern audiences, their legacies are well and truly secure.\n\nIn this article, we’ve covered the most significant techno DJs in the genre’s history and the record labels and venues that helped make them famous.\n\nThe 10 Best Techno DJs of All Time\n\nTechno is one of the oldest subgenres in the dance music world, with a long history spanning decades and featuring true megastar DJs.\n\nWe’ve ensured this list covers everyone you need to know, from the genre’s founding fathers to today’s rising stars forging a new path.\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s our breakdown of the ten best techno DJs of all time:\n\n10. Charlotte De Witte\n\nA relative newcomer to the world of techno, Belgian DJ Charlotte de Witte quickly rose to prominence thanks to her unique approach to minimal techno music.\n\nCurrently ranked among the best underground DJs in the world, de Witte has performed sets at some of the biggest festivals and venues worldwide.\n\nKnown for blending elements of acid house with her techno sets, she’s influenced many techno DJs since her arrival on the techno scene.\n\nIn addition to DJing, Charlotte de Witte established her own record label, KNTXT, through which she has released music by herself and other techno artists.\n\nHer experience and talent as a DJ and producer are reflected in original releases such as “Doppler” and “Return to Nowhere,” as well as remixes such as “Space Raiders” by Eats Everything.\n\nPrior to hitting the big time using her real name, Charlotte de Witte performed under the alias Raving George, notably at the Tomorrowland festival in 2011.\n\nShe has won many dance music awards over the years, surpassing techno DJ icon Carl Cox as the best techno DJ in the world at the 2018 DJ Awards.\n\nIn 2021, Charlotte de Witte announced her engagement to the Italian techno DJ Enrico Sangiuliano, another icon of the genre we’ve featured in this article.\n\n9. Daniel Avery\n\nDaniel Avery began his career as a music producer under the moniker Spotmakingme in 2009 before transitioning to playing music using his real name.\n\nBorn in the United Kingdom, Daniel Avery cut his teeth in the music industry, performing with a series of bands inspired by My Bloody Valentine and Kyuss.\n\nHe transitioned into the techno scene with regular DJ sets at the iconic techno nightclub Fabric in London, where he met future collaborators, including Kelly Lee Owens and James Greenwood.\n\nIn 2013, he released his debut studio album, Drone Logic, fusing elements of rave, house, and minimal techno music to critical acclaim.\n\nAs his discography evolved over the following years, his production became noted for fusing elements of modern techno with diverse acts within the music scene.\n\nThis included a collaboration with the band Nine Inch Nails, later followed by the album Love + Light, which drew upon his interest in downtempo and ambient musical styles.\n\nIn 2019, Avery sat on for Mary Anne Hobbs on the iconic BBC Radio show 6 Music Recommends, where he expressed his admiration for his mentor Andrew Weatherall.\n\n8. Richie Hawtin\n\nAn overview of the history of DJing wouldn’t be complete without Richie Hawtin, one of the best techno artists of all time and a key figure in electronic music.\n\nRichie Hawtin’s career took off during the 1990s at the height of the techno genre, quickly rising through the ranks to become one of the top techno DJs worldwide.\n\nIndeed, this experience and prestige are reflected in his many awards and nominations, which saw him crowned the Best Techno DJ three times.\n\nA hugely influential producer and a world-class DJ, Richie Hawtin’s own music has been widely played by DJs throughout the techno scene.\n\nHis seminal album Plastikman set the benchmark for techno studio albums, with the lead single “Spastik” becoming the centerpiece of Hawtin’s live DJ sets.\n\nThe many collaborations Hawtin has been involved with over the years read like a who’s who of the best techno DJs from over two decades of experience.\n\nRicardo Villalobos, Akufen, and Sven Vath are just a handful of the outstanding artists Hawtin has worked on a string of incredible releases that reshaped techno music.\n\nRichie Hawtin’s career continues to thrive to this day, releasing new music through his label, Plus 8, and playing good techno music at clubs worldwide.\n\n7. Adam Beyer\n\nSwedish techno producer and DJ Adam Beyer is another iconic figure in the techno scene who first came to prominence during the 1990s.\n\nAlong with Cari Lekebusch and Jesper Dahlbäck, he helped to transform the profile of techno artists and popularize the genre to a new generation of music fans.\n\nAs a music producer, Adam Beyer has released several notable albums, EPs, and singles, including Decoded and Ignition Key, from the 1990s to the 2000s.\n\nHe has also released several significant techno mixes, with his 2005 contribution to the Fabric line of mixes a breakthrough contribution to techno music.\n\nIn 1996, Beyer founded his own record label, Drumcode Records, through which many of his tracks have been released over the following years.\n\nOther notable techno DJs featured on the label include Amelie Lens, Green Velvet, Joey Beltram, and Steve Lawler.\n\nMore recently, Adam Beyer has branched out into podcasts with the techno podcast Drumcode Radio Live, showcasing his unique style and bringing new artists into the spotlight.\n\n6. Daft Punk\n\nDaft Punk needs no introduction to anyone with even a passing interest in dance music; widely regarded among the best EDM DJs of all time and the most influential.\n\nBeginning their career in the 1990s, Daft Punk were catapulted into the mainstream spotlight following the release of their debut album, Homework, in 1997.\n\nWhile they were initially known for their forward-thinking deep house music, their sound evolved over time to combine elements of funk, techno, and disco music.\n\nThis paved the way for many international tours that cemented their reputation among the most significant electronic music artists of their generation.\n\nLike Orbital, they became known for hiding their identity behind costumes that concealed their faces, a practice that other techno DJs since have engaged in.\n\nIn addition to their work together, the duo has produced music independently, with Thomas Bangalter composing the soundtrack to the movie Irreversible.\n\nFew techno DJs have contributed as significant an impact on the music scene as Daft Punk, with their work still resonating with DJs and producers to this day.\n\n5. Nina Kraviz\n\nRussian-born DJ and producer Nina Kraviz began her professional career in dentistry before making the transition to techno music.\n\nIt was while working as a dentist in Moscow that Kraviz began DJing at local clubs while also hosting a local radio show and writing for a fanzine.\n\nBy 2005, she had been accepted into the Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, but due to Visa issues, she was unable to attend.\n\nInstead, Kraviz began her residency at the Propaganda Club in Moscow, and in 2012, she released her self-titled debut album on the Rekids record label.\n\nThis release marked her breakthrough into the techno scene, paving the way for her own label, Trip, and mixing the 48th DJ Kick mix album.\n\nThe following year, Nina Kraviz released another mix compilation for Fabric’s line of mixes, with a string of techno singles also hitting the charts.\n\nHer diverse selection of releases also includes music for the 2020 game Cyberpunk 2077, which cemented her reputation as one of the hottest techno producers around.\n\n4. Sven Vath\n\nLike Ritchie Hawtin, Sven Vath has been present on the techno scene for decades and is ranked as one of the genre’s true pioneers.\n\nA true master at DJing in clubs, he’s won several DJ awards over the years and is known for branching out across multiple genres, including house and tech house.\n\nThe German DJ began his career with the release of “Electrica Salsa,” released in 1986, and became a huge hit throughout the clubs of Europe.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Vath had established the club Cocoon, which proved to be hugely popular and hosted parties that included luminaries such as Ricardo Villalobos and Matt John on their roster.\n\nSven Vath transported the Cocoon concept to Ibiza in 1999, with big-name artists such as Carl Craig, Adam Beyer, and Josh Wink performing mixing duties on the decks.\n\nAs a producer, Sven Vath has been incredibly prolific, with dozens of singles and many solo albums and mix compilations in his discography.\n\nA staunch supporter of vinyl, Vath insists on only playing tracks in his sets using the classic format and has described Technics turntables as “instruments.”\n\n3. Carl Cox\n\nOne of the most famous DJs in the world, Carl Cox, is a British producer and DJ who has won dozens of awards throughout his illustrious career.\n\nRegarded as the leading founder of techno music, Cox began his music career in the late 1970s during the birth of the Chicago house music scene.\n\nBy the 1980s, he was a key player in the electronica industry and a founding member of what would become the British rave scene in the early 1990s.\n\nRenowned for his three-deck mixing style – something that Jeff Mills would also be noted for – he pushed cutting-edge techno music into the mainstream.\n\nLike many of the best techno DJs, Carl Cox was praised for his DJ sets at some of the biggest festivals and nightclubs around the world.\n\nMany of his live performances were held at his “Carl Cox and Friends” stages at festivals, including The BPM Festival, Ultra Music Festival, and Tomorrowland.\n\nAs a producer, Carl Cox initially released tracks on Paul Oakenfold’s Perfecto label and labels such as 23rd Century Records and Intec Digital.\n\nHis list of remixes includes an extensive selection of the leading artists in the dance music scene, such as Moby, Slam, Grooverider, and Deadmau5.\n\n2. Enrico Sangiuliano\n\nItalian techno DJ Enrico Sangiuliano is perhaps best known for his close association with the techno label Drumcode, which has released many classic tracks.\n\nNoted for his impeccable production, his music is widely played thanks to its pounding kick drums and basslines combined with intricate synths and effects.\n\nWidely regarded as one of contemporary techno’s most innovative stars, he’s fostered an outstanding back catalog of tunes that have dominated the scene.\n\nEnrico Sangiuliano is also known for his lengthy DJ sets, often playing for several hours on end and crafting a musical journey for the audience.\n\nHe’s not afraid to be experimental with his set construction, using elements of sound design as much as he plays outstanding techno tracks.\n\nIn addition to his releases through Drumcode, Sangiuliano has released music through his own record label, NINETOZERO, where he’s free to explore more experimental sounds.\n\nOne of the rising stars of the modern techno scene, the Enrico Sangiuliano remix of Moby’s “Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad” is a standout release from his discography.\n\n1. Jeff Mills\n\nLast but by no means least, Jeff Mills needs little introduction; widely considered to be the grandfather of the techno scene and a true pioneering DJ,\n\nMills emerged on the scene way back in the 1980s and began working as a DJ and producer with a solid sensibility for track curation.\n\nAfter learning how to DJ with vinyl, he mastered the most advanced techniques and forged a new path for what was possible to achieve with decks and a mixer.\n\nBy 1992, Jeff Mills had founded the record label Axis Records, through which he promoted cutting-edge producers along with his own compositions.\n\nLater, Mills became a founding member of Underground Resistance, a techno label that has since become one of the most prestigious in the industry.\n\nHis DJ sets are widely praised for using three decks in addition to a Roland TR-909 drum machine, with up to seventy records played within an hour.\n\nA true master of the genre, few DJs can compare to Jeff Mills, who remains an icon for techno DJs to this day.\n\nSummary\n\nSo there you have it, our overview of the best techno DJs of all time, covering the trailblazing founders to today’s rising stars.\n\nTechno continues to be hugely popular among dance music fans, with new talent constantly emerging on the club scene.\n\nAs it grows in popularity, we anticipate more great DJs making their mark and reshaping the genre in new and exciting ways."
