        "text": "A Selena Quintanilla-themed cruise is scheduled to sail out of the Los Angeles area next year.\n\nThe three-day cruise is called Dreaming of You 25 Years: The Como La Flor Cruise, and is slated to sail from Long Beach, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, in September 2020. According to the cruise's website, Selena Quintanilla's husband, Chris Perez will perform with Grupo Metal. There will also be cumbia lessons, artist Q&A sessions, meet and greets, trivia contests and \"Selenaoke.\" (That's Selena karaoke.)\n\nPerez was a guitarist in Quintanilla's band Selena Y Los Dinos in 1990. The couple married in 1992—three years before the singer was shot and killed in a hotel room in Corpus Christi, Texas, by Yolanda Saldívar, the president of Quintanilla's fan club. Quintanilla was 23 years old when she died.\n\n2020 will mark the 25th anniversary of the singer's murder. Quintanilla, known to many as \"The Queen of Tejano Music,\" won a Grammy at age 21 and has reportedly sold more albums than any other woman in Latin music history.\n\nQuintanilla's album Dreaming of You was released posthumously in 1996 and contained five English tracks as well as remixes of Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Como la Flor, Techno Cumbia and Amor Prohibido. The album has sold nearly 3 million copies in the last quarter-century, according to Nielsen Music.\n\nSince her death, a panoply of Selena-themed products and services have been developed in the United States. In 2016, MAC Cosmetics named a makeup collection for the Tejano singer, introducing bronzers and lipsticks named after her most popular songs. In April 2019, San Diego State University revealed plans for a Selena Quintanilla-themed course that will begin in spring 2020.\n\nBooking for the tribute cruise is now open. The cruise website says cabins start at $950 per person, and there's a $100 deposit required to reserve a spot. For more information, visit selenatributecruise.com."
