Called the Queen of Tejano music, her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican American entertainers of the end of the 20th century as Hispanics elevated her into sainthood. She was named the \"top Latin artist of the '90s\" and \"Best selling Latin artist of the decade\" by Billboardmagazine, as well as the \"Mexican equivalent\" of Madonna in terms of her clothing choices. The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene along with her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla III and Suzette Quintanilla as a member ofSelena y Los Dinos in 1980, and began recording professionally in 1982. In the 1980s, Selena was often criticized and was turned down at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male- dominated music genre. However, her popularity grewafter she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1986, which she won nine consecutive times. Selena signed with Capitol EMI Latin in 1989, and released her self-titled debut album that same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter. Her 1990 album Ven Conmigo became the first recording by a female Tejano artist to achieve gold status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n3. Selena released Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), which peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to name the album as her \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, \"Como La Flor\", became one of hersignature and most popular songs. Her Live! (1993) album won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a Tejano artist to do so. In 1994 Selena released Amor Prohibido, which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. The album was critically acclaim as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era in its history as it became one of the most popular Latin music genre at the time. Selena began recording English-language songs for her crossover album. Aside from music, Selena was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. Coca-Cola named her their spokesperson in Texas, and Selena became asex icon, despite her comments on being a role model for young women, which she was often criticized for wearing suggestive outfits. Selena and her guitarist, Chris Pérez, eloped in April 1992 after Quintanilla, Jr. raised concerns over their relationship. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar her friend and former employee of her boutiques. Hispanics reacted negatively to the news of her death, and was compared to the death reactions of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and US president John F. Kennedy. Her posthumous crossover album, Dreaming of You (1995), debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat. Two weeks after her death, George W. Bush (governor of Texas at the time) declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. In 1997, Warner Bros.released a film about her life and career, which starred Jennifer Lopez as Selena. As of 2012, Selena has sold over 60 million albums worldwide.[1] Contents [hide]  1 Life and career o 1.1 1971–88: Early life and career beginnings o 1.2 1989–90: Self-titled album and relationship with Pérez o 1.3 1990–91: Ven Conmigo and the Selena fan club o 1.4 1992–93: Elopement, Entre a Mi Mundo, and Selena Live o 1.5 1994–95: Fashion venture, film debut, and Amor Prohibido  2 Murder o 2.1 Impact  3 Artistry  4 Public image  5 Philanthropy  6 Legacy and influence o 6.1 Posthumous film and honors  7 Discography  8 Filmography o 8.1 Film o 8.2 Television  9 See also  10 Notes  11 References o 11.1 Sources  12 External links Life and career 1971–88: Early life and career beginnings\n\n4. Selena Quintanilla was born on April 16, 1971 in Lake Jackson, Texas.[2][3] She had Cherokee ancestry,[4] and was the youngest child of Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora) and Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. a former Mexican American musician.[5] Selena was raised as a Jehovah's Witness.[6] Abraham noticed Selena's musical abilities when she was six years old. He told People magazine \"Her timing, her pitch were perfect, I could see it from day one.\"[7] In 1980, Abraham opened his first Tex-Mex restaurant in Lake Jackson where Selena and her siblings—Abraham III on bass guitar and Suzette Quintanilla on drums, and Selena singing—would often perform.[7] The following year, the restaurant was forced to close after the recession due to the Texas oil bust of 1980. The family declared bankruptcy, and were evicted from their home.[7][8] They settled in Corpus Christi, Texas, while Quintanilla, Jr. began promoting the newly formed band Selena y Los Dinos as the band's manager.[7][9][10] They needed money and played wherever they could get a gig. They performed at street corners, weddings, quinceañeras and fairs.[7][11] Because the demands of her performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education as her popularity as a singer grew, her father took her out of school when she was in the eighth grade.[12] Selena's teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena's musical career.[13] She threatened to report Quintanilla, Jr. to the Texas Board of Education believing that the conditions Selena was exposed to were inappropriate for a girl her age, which he in turn told her to \"mind her business\". Other teachers expressed their concerns when they noticed how tired Selena would be when she arrived at school.[13] At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from The American School of Correspondence in Chicago,[14] and was also accepted at Louisiana State University.[15] However, Selena enrolled at Pacific Western Universitytaking up business administration as her major.[16] Quintanilla, Jr. refurbished an old bus which he named \"Big Bertha\" which became the family's tour bus.[17] In the first years of touring, the family sang for food and barely had enough to pay gas.[17] In 1984, Selena recorded her first LP record Selena y Los Dinos, for Freddie Records.[18] Selena recorded Tejano music compositions, despite her wishes on wanting to record English-language recordings. As a male-dominate genre,[19] Tejano music—a Spanish- language music genre popularized by Mexicans in the United States with German influences[20] of polka, jazz, and country music,[21] was coined by Quintanilla, Jr. who believed that Selena should record musical compositions of her heritage.[22] During the recording sessions for the album, Selena had to learn Spanish phonetically and with guidance from her father.[23] The album helped Selena to appear on the Johnny Canales Show, a popular Spanish-language music show in 1985, she would then continue to guest star for several years. Selena was discovered by Rick Trevi founder of the Tejano Music Awards where she won the Female Vocalist of the Year award in 1987 and eight consecutive years after that.[24] The band was often turned down by venues across Texas because of their age and because Selena was their lead singer.[25] By 1988, Selena had released five more LP records; Alpha (1986), Munequito de Trapo (1987), And the Winner is... (1987), Preciosa (1988), and Dulce Amor (1988).[26] 1989–90: Self-titled album and relationship with Pérez Chris Pérez (far right) and Selena began a relationship, despite disapproval of her father. Jose Behar of newly formed label EMI Latin Records, together with the new head of Sony Music Latin, watched Selena perform at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards.[27] Behar was searching for new Latin acts and wanted to sign Selena to EMI's Capitol Records, while Sony Music Latin was offering twice Capitol's sum to Quintanilla, Jr.[27] Behar thought that he had\n\n5. discovered the \"next Gloria Estefan\" but his superior called Behar illogical since he had been in South Texas less than a week.[12][28] Quintanilla, Jr. chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a crossover album, and becoming their first artist that signed with them.[29] Before Selena began recording for her debut album, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested a crossover album for Selena.[30] She recorded three English-language compositions for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told that she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album.[31] Behar thought that EMI Records and the public did not believe that a Mexican American woman could have \"crossover potential\".[28] Selena released her self-titled debut album on October 17, 1989. Selena recorded most of the songs in San Antonio, Texas at AMEN Studios, while \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded in Houston, Texas at Sunrise Studios. Selena wrote \"My Love\", and wanted the song to be included on her first recording. Her brother, Quintanilla III became her principal record producer and songwriter for most of Selena's musical career.[32] The only tracks Quintanilla III did not write on her debut album were \"Sukiyaki\", \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", and \"No Te Vayas\". The former was an original 1960s Japanese recording by Kyu Sakamoto. The lyrics Selena used were a Spanish version of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson.[33] The lead single, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart, while the album peaked at number seven on the USBillboard Regional Mexican Albums chart,[34] becoming Selena's first single and album to debut on a national music chart.[35] Her self-titled recording performed better than albums from other female Tejano singers at the time.[35] In the same year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena to become one of their spokespeople in Texas.[36] The jingle used in her first two commercials for the company were composed by Quintanilla III and Chris Pérez—who joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist.[37] Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend back at San Antonio.[38] After a Mexico trip with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for him and Selena if he tried to distance himself from her, but found it difficult and decided to try building a relationship with her.[39] They expressed their feelings for each other at aPizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple.[40][41] Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing that Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break them up.[42][43] 1990–91: Ven Conmigo and the Selena fan club Selena released her second studio album, Ven Conmigo in 1990. The album yielded Selena's first gold album by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 50,000 copies. Ven Conmigo became the first album by a female Tejano singer to reach gold status in the United States.[44] The album produced three singles; \"Ya Ves\", \"La Tracalera\", and \"Baila Esta Cumbia\".[45] The latter, aMexican cumbia song, became one of Selena's biggest hit singles. Its popularity grew in Mexico where a compilation album bearing the single's name was released there, the recording was certified platinum by theAsociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), denoting sales of 150,000 units.[46][47] A registered nurse and fan named Yolanda Saldívar asked Quintanilla, Jr. to start a fan club in San Antonio.[48] Saldívar had the idea after she had attended one of Selena's concerts. Quintanilla, Jr. approved Saldívar's request, he believed the fan club would bring more exposure for the band. Saldívar soon became a close friend to Selena and the family, she was trusted and became the acting president of the fan club in 1991.[49] That same year, Salvadoran singer Álvaro Torres composed a duet he wanted to record with Selena.[27] The song \"Buenos Amigos\" was produced by Enrique Elizondo and was released on Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).[50] The recording peaked at number one on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart, giving Selena her first number one single. The music video for \"Buenos Amigos\" earned Selena and Torres two nominations at the 1992 Billboard Music Awards.[51] The track was nominated for Duo of the Year at the 1992 Tejano Music Awards.[52] Deborah Parédez wrote in her book Selenidad, that the track enabled Selena to tour the west and east coasts of the United States.[53] According to John Lannert\n\n6. of Billboard magazine, the song was helped by increased airplay on regional Mexican and Tejano radio stations, which had previously dismissed Selena's recordings.[54] 1992–93: Elopement, Entre a Mi Mundo, and Selena Live Selena's sister Suzette, found Selena and Pérez flirting with each other and immediately informed their father.[55] Quintanilla, Jr. took Pérez off the bus and told him that his and Selena's relationship was over.[56] Selena and Pérez continued their relationship despite Quintanilla, Jr's disapproval;[57][58] Selena's mother, Marcella, approved of their relationship.[59] Quintanilla, Jr. spotted Selena and Pérez romantically together on the bus, he pulled over and an argument between him and Selena ensued. He called Pérez a \"cancer in my family\", and threatened to disband the group if they continued their relationship.[60] Selena and Pérez relented; Quintanilla, Jr. fired him from the band, and prevented Selena from running off with him.[61] After Pérez was fired from the band he and Selena secretly continued their relationship. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena and Pérez decided to elope, believing that Quintanilla, Jr. would never approve of their relationship.[60][62] Selena believed that Quintanilla, Jr. would leave her and Pérez alone if they were married, and they would not have to hide their feelings for each other. Within hours of their marriage, the media announced Selena and Pérez' elopement.[63] Selena's family tried to track her down; Quintanilla, Jr. did not take the news well, and alienated himself for some time.[63] Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment together in Corpus Christi.[64] Quintanilla, Jr. approached Pérez, apologized, accepted the marriage and took Pérez back into the band.[65] A month after her elopement, Selena released her third studio album, Entre a Mi Mundo, in May 1992. The album was critically acclaim for being a \"breakthrough album\" for Selena.[66][67][68] The recording peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months,[69] it was certified 6x Platinum by the RIAA for shipments of 600,000 copies.[70] In Mexico, the recording was certified gold for sales of 300,000 units.[71] Entre a Mi Mundo became the first Tejano album by a female artist to sell over 300,000 copies.[a] Selena outsold male Tejano singers with her album, according to editors of theMiami Herald and the San Jose Mercury News.[74][75] The album produced four singles; \"Como La Flor\", \"¿Qué Creías?\", \"La Carcacha\", and \"Amame\". The lead single, \"Como La Flor\", became Selena's signature recording,[76] and was critically acclaim by music critics as being a career launcher for Selena.[77] \"Como La Flor\" helped Selena to dominate the Latin music charts and become immensely popular in Mexico, where Mexican-Americans were generally not liked among citizens, which was well received by critics.[78] The track was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards.[79] The single peaked at number six on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart.[80] Selena released Live! in 1993, it was recorded during a free concert at the Memorial Coliseum in Corpus Christi, on February 7, 1993.[81] The recording included previously released tracks which were sung live and three studio recordings; \"No Debes Jugar\", \"La Llamada\", and a duet with Tejano musician Emilio Navaira on \"Tú Robaste Mi Corazón\".

Both were equipped with in-house beauty salons.[87] She was in negoitations to open more stores in Monterrey, Mexico and Puerto Rico.[88] Saldivar served as the manager for both\n\n7. boutiques after the Quintanilla family were impressed with the way she managed the fan club.[89] Hispanic Business magazine reported that the singer earned over five million dollars from these boutiques.[90] She became the top twentieth wealthiest Hispanic musicians who grossed the highest incomes in 1993 and 1994.[91] Selena released her fifth studio album, Amor Prohibido, in March 1994.

The song got to number one on the Top Latin Songs chart,[117] which enabled Selena to tour in New York City, Argentina, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America, where she was not well known.[118][119] In late 1994, EMI chairman Charles Koppelman felt that Selena had succeed her goals in the Spanish-speaking market. He wanted to propel Selena as an English-language American solo pop artist. Selena continued touring while EMI began preparing the crossover album with Grammy Award winning composers.[120] By the time Selena performed to a record-breaking sold out concert at the Houston Astrodome in February 1995, work had already begun on her crossover album.[120] In 1995, Selena made a cameo appearance in Don Juan DeMarco, which starred Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway.[121] Murder Main articles: Murder of Selena and People of the State of Texas v. Yolanda Saldívar The Quintanilla family named Saldivar the manager of Selena's boutiques in early 1994.[49] Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldivar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena.[89] In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores decreased.[122] According to staff members, Saldivar largely fired anyone she personally did not like.[123] Staff members at the store constantly complained about Saldivar's behavior to Selena who dismissed the claims, believing that her \"friend\" wouldn't negatively impose on her fashion venture.[123] According to Quintanilla, Jr. the staff then turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldivar. Quintanilla, Jr. took the claims serious and informed Selena to \"be careful\" and that Saldivar may not be a good influence.[123] She dismissed her father's inquires since he had always distrusted people in the past.[123] By January 1995, claims from Selena's cousin, her fashion designer Martin Gomez, and clients, expressed their concerns over Saldivar's behavior and management skills.[123][124] During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News believed that Saldívar's devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.[89]\n\n8. According to Quintanilla, Jr. it was not until January when he began receiving phone calls from fans who reportedly paid their membership for the Selena fan club and received nothing, that he began an investigation.[125] Upon investigation, Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar was embezzling more than $60,000 in forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.[125] Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting the night of March 9 with Selena and Suzette, at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies concerning the disappearing funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told Saldívar that if she didn't come up with evidence that disproved his accusations, then he was going to get the police involved. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldivar from having any contact with Selena.[125] However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she felt that Saldívar was essential to whether the clothing line would take off in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements and financial records necessary for tax preparation.[125] On the morning of March 31, 1995, Selena met up with Saldivar at her Days Inn motel room in Corpus Christi.[9] At the motel, Selena demanded the financial papers; Saldívar delayed the handover by claiming she had been raped in Mexico.[12] The singer then drove Saldívar to Doctors Regional Hospital where doctors found no evidence of rape.[126] At 11:48 am, Saldívar drew the gun from her purse[127] and pointed it at Selena.[128] As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing an artery and resulting in a massive loss of blood.[128] Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood 392 feet (119 m) long.[128] She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called 9-1-1, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a \"bitch\".[129] Before collapsing, she named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot.[130] Meanwhile, Saldívar got into her pickup truck and attempted to leave the motel. However, she was spotted by a responding police cruiser.[128] Saldívar surrendered after nearly nine-and-a-half hours of a standoff between police and the FBI.[9] By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.[9][128] Since the bullet had pierced an artery, after 50 minutes the doctors realized that the damage was irreparable. Selena was pronounced dead at 1:05 pm from blood loss and cardiac arrest.[128][131] Impact Selena's murder had a widespread impact. Her death reaction was compared to the deaths of musicians John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and the assassination of US president John F. Kennedy.[132][72] Major networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news; Tom Brokaw referred to Selena as \"The Mexican Madonna\".[133] It was front page news on The New York Times for two days after her death.[134] Numerous vigils and memorials were held in her honor, and radio stations in Texas played her music non-stop.[12] Her funeral drew 60,000 mourners, many of whom traveled from outside the United States.[12] The news struck the Hispanic community extremely hard; many traveled thousands of miles to Selena's house, boutiques and the crime scene.[135][136] By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' houses.[137] Among the celebrities who were reported to have contact the Quintanilla family to express their condolences were Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Julio Iglesias, and Madonna.[138] Other celebrities took to radio stations to expressed their thoughts about Selena's death, including Stefanie Ridel, Jaime DeAnda (of Los Chamacos), and Shelly Lares.[139] A People magazine issue was released several days after her murder. Its publishers believed that interest would soon wane; they released a commemorative issue within a week when it became apparent that it was growing. The issue sold nearly a million copies,[140] selling the entire first and second run within two weeks. It became a collector's item, a first in the history of People.[141] Betty Cortina, editor of People, told Biography that they never had an issue that was completely sold out; \"it was unheard of\".[141] In the following months the company released People en Español (aimed at the Hispanic market), due to the success of the Selena issue.[141] This was followed by Newsweek en Espanol and Latina magazine.[142] A few days later, Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder and burial, poked fun at her mourners, and criticized her music. Stern said, \"This music does absolutely nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul ... Spanish people have the worst taste in\n\n9. music. They have no depth.\" Stern's comments outraged and infuriated the Hispanic community in Texas.[143] Stern played Selena's songs with gunshots in the background.[144][145] After a disorderly conduct arrest warrant was issued in his name, Stern made an on-air statement, in Spanish, for his comments that he stressed were not made to cause \"more anguish to her family, friends and those who loved her.\"[146][147] The League of United Latin American Citizens boycotted Stern's show, finding his apology unacceptable.[148] Texas retailers removed any products that were related with Stern, while Sears and McDonalds sent out a disapproval letter to the media that addressed their stance against Stern's comments, after fans believed they sponsored his show.[149] Within a week, on NBC'sThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Stern and Robin Quivers (his African- American co-host) were asked if Stern's remarks about Selena were acceptable. Quivers decided not to talk about the situation, to avoid arguing with Stern. When Linda Ronstadt (a pop singer of Mexican-American heritage) appeared on the show, she and Quivers quickly got into an argument when Ronstadt defended Selena.[150] On April 12, 1995, two weeks after her death, George W. Bush (governor of Texas at the time) declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas.[36][151][152] Some European Americans in Texas wrote to the editor of theBrazosport Facts during April and May, asking what the big deal was; some were also offended that Selena Day fell on Easter Sunday. Others agreed that \"Easter is more important than Selena Day\", and believed that everyone should let Selena rest in peace and go on with their lives.[153] Mexican Americans in Texas wrote vociferously to the newspaper. Some agreed that others were too critical of Selena Day, and stated that they didn't need to celebrate the day and should not have responded so rudely.[154] In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar of first degree murder and sentenced her to life in prison, with the possibility of parole in 2025.[155][156] Under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed in 2002, and the pieces thrown into Corpus Christi Bay.[157][158] However, fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun citing that the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.[16] Artistry Selena's vocal range was soprano.[159] In an April 1995 interview with Billboard magazine, Behar explained that he saw Selena as a \"cross between Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston in style, feel, and vocal range.\"[160] Although Selena did not write most of her songs, she incorporated R&B,[161] Latin pop, techno-pop,[162] country western, and disco into her Tejano music repertoire.[163] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News, writes that Selena \"merges Tejano's infectious cumbia rhythm with street-savvy R&B, old-school soul, dancehall reggae, sizzling salsa, and trippy, loopy funk.\" during her musical career.[164] Selena's recordings expressed \"love and pain, as well as strength and passion.\" according to Charles Tatum.[165] She also recorded independently driven, female-empowerment themed compositions; \"Si La Quieres\", \"¿Qué Creias?\", \"Ya Ves\" and \"Ya No\", which centered around wrongful relationships and empowering battered women.[166] Peter Watrous of The New York Times believed that Selena's voice \"sometimes quivered\" and that she \"roughed it up a bit. At its best, it had a coolness, a type of unadorned passion\".[167] Ilan Stavans called her music as \"cursi--melodramatic, cheesy, overemotional, not too far from Juan Gabriel and a relative of Iglesias.\"[168] Richard Corliss of Time magazine believed that her songs \"are perky, cheerful rather than soulful.\" and that earlier recordings \"with their tinny, Tijuana Brass charts, and keyboards that evoke calliopes, are ideal for the fairground or merry-go-round.\" Corliss calls Selena's singing as an \"expert mimicry of everything from Edith Piaf's melodramatic contralto to the coloratura riffs of Mariah Carey. But the sounds are still lightly Hispanic.\"[169] \"Dreaming of You\" (1995)\n\n10. MENU 0:00 \"Dreaming of You\", an English-language recording, became one of four English cuts Selena recorded for her crossover from Spanish into English pop music. Problems playing this file?

Meier wrote in his book The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia (2010), that Selena exhibited \"contagious energy\" during her concerts and that she displayed \"warmth, passion, and sexuality\" while exuded a \"down-to- Earth persona of the wholesome young girl next door.\"[185] Selena was known to wear outfits that accented her physical attributes and was also not afraid to wear costumes or outfits that she liked,[141] despite criticism from parents of young children who felt that Selena's choice of outfits were inappropriate for young girls who began emulating Selena.[186] Selena's views on public image in the fashion industry were bothersome, she explained that she was against the image that all woman should be \"rail-thin\" and the notion that they must wear certain outfits and be \"super-young to be beautiful.\"[187] In the early 1990s, Selena began wearing decorative bustiers, spandex or tight pants, and attractive unbutton jackets during her concerts.[186] She was inspired by Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, and Madonna.[186] During a 1992 interview, Selena expressed that her choice of clothing does not reflect who she is as a person.[141] NBC News called Selena's outfit \"provocative\".[188] Because of her choice of outfits and dance moves, she was named by her fans as the \"Mexican Madonna\".[189][190] According to Suzette, Selena often designed and sow her own outfits backstage with her designers, moments before she is due to be on stage.[141] Quintanilla, Jr. disapproved of Selena's outfits, however, he later accepted it when Selena discussed about it being a fashion trend.[141] Selena became an inactive member of the Jehovah's Witnesses due to her exotic clothing.[191] During the photo shoot for Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), a photographer remarked on howSelena's choice of clothing effected Quintanilla, Jr. tremendously who often left sessions when Selena would appear in suggestive outfits.[192] Selena was credited as being the first women to change the minds of people about feminine beauty, she also started that movement, and was also trailblazing for other female artists during her career.[141][193] Following Selena's death, the singer grew criticism from celebrities who question her role model status among Hispanic women. Hispanic filmmaker Lourdes Portillo expressed concerns on whether or not Selena was a great role model to young women in her documentary about the singer in 1999.[194] Portillo believed that Selena was sending the wrong message to young girls by dancing in clothing that suggests hypersexualization.[195] American author Sandra Cisneros, agrees with Portillo's assessment that Selena \"is not a good role model to Latina women\".[196] Media outlets also shared Portillo's comments and believed that the \"fairy tale story\" of Selena is one that her family would want to preserve, questioning Quintanilla, Jr.'s role for pushing an image that Selena had \"never made mistakes\" into the media, calling it \"lies\" and \"not the real story\".[197][198] Philanthropy During her childhood Selena helped organizations such as Toys for Tots.[199] Selena was active in the Latino community in the United States.[200] She visited local schools to talk to students about the importance of education.[200] She attended and educated a gathering of two-hundred high school students in Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, about positive attitudes and setting life-goals for achievements in their adult life.[199] Selena urged children to stay in school throughout her talk sessions in school districts in Texas, she also told children that alcohol and drugs will lead them no where in life.[201] She spent her free time helping her community.
