        "text": "The announcement of plans for a Selena Quintanilla-themed cruise on social media, has prompted some fans to question its legitimacy.\n\nIn just a few days, the \"Selena Tribute Cruise\" changed its name to \"Como la Flor Cruise,\" the cruise's website shows.\n\nThe website says the cruise ship will depart from Long Beach, California, on Sept. 25, 2020. The second day of the cruise will be spent at sea. The third day will be spent in Ensenada, Mexico, before the ship returns to Long Beach, the website states.\n\nThe cruise advertisement states cabins start at $999 per person, and $100 is needed to reserve a spot.\n\nAn organizer of the cruise, who declined to give his name, told the Caller-Times on Tuesday Chris Perez signed a contract to perform during the cruise. He said the cruise has been scheduled for about a month, and the ship has space for about 2,400 people.\n\nHe said the cruise is being put on by a travel agency that has a \"host agency\" in Jacksonville, Florida. He declined to name the travel agencies, and said they work with 5,000 agencies nationwide.\n\nPerez's official Facebook page includes a reply last month to a fan who asked whether the cruise was real.\n\n\"Just got word back from my people about this cruise,\" Perez's comment reads. \"Found out ... It's true guys! See you there. I only wish it was happening sooner ...\"\n\nWHO IS BEHIND THE SELENA CRUISE?\n\nThe Caller-Times hasn't been able to confirm who is organizing the cruise. The website lists only social media accounts for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with a form to send an email. Promotional material states the event is from Los Angeles while a phone number on event fliers online has a Las Vegas area code.\n\nHowever, officials with Carnival Cruise line told the Caller-Times this week the three-day cruise is scheduled through their company.\n\n\"We will host these types of affinity groups from time to time working with local travel agents who put these groups together,\" Carnival Cruise officials wrote in an email.\n\nA staff member who answered the phone at Q-Productions, which is owned by the Quintanilla family, said the cruise has \"nothing to do with us\" and declined further comment. Selena's father, Abraham, had been locked in a legal battle for years with Perez over his attempt to have his memoir, \"To Selena, With Love,\" made into a TV series.\n\nAttempts this week to reach attorneys who represented Perez in the lawsuit for comment about the cruise weren't successful.\n\nThere's several company names listed in various places on the cruise website. Terms of the cruise initially list Cruise Kingz LLC as the company involved in the cruise. The Caller-Times couldn't find a company registered with that name. \"Soul Train Cruise 20 LLC\" and \"Selena Tribute Cruise 2020 LLC\" are also listed as companies involved in the event.\n\nSome sections of the website appear to be copied verbatim from an excerpt about a cruise with Carnival. A photo used on Carnival Cruise Line's official website also appears on the Selena-themed cruise site. Several other unattributed photos show swanky guest suites, a giant water slide, and other luxurious amenities that are identical to ones shown on Carnival Cruise Line's website, other cruise line company websites like iCruise.com, Royal Caribbean, travel sites, blogs or are stock images. One, of a group of scantily clad women in sombreros, came from PubCrawls.com. In some cases it appears watermarks that were on the original photos were cropped out.\n\nOn Friday, Bidi Bidi Banda sent an email to the Caller-Times saying they \"formally pulled out of the Selena/Como La Flor Cruise.\"\n\n\"It just doesn't work for us,\" the email reads.\n\nIs the Selena cruise a scam?\n\nThe Better Business Bureau warns against sharing personally identifiable information with someone over the phone, email, social media or in person. Information includes birth date, social security and insurance numbers and banking and credit card information.\n\nThe site advises those looking to book to have their date of birth, country of citizenship and passport number ready. A flier found on the website also says no passport is needed for the cruise.\n\nOne Facebook post on the cruise's Facebook page touts that \"no passports are needed for U.S. citizens\" while another urges fans to book soon because 25 percent of rooms have been filled.\n\n\"Scammers typically try to make you think something is scarce or a limited time offer. They want to push you into action before you have time to think or to discuss it with a family member, friend, or financial advisor,\" the BBB website reads. \"High-pressure sales tactics are also used by some legitimate businesses, but itâ€™s never a good idea to make an important decision quickly.\"\n\nThe BBB also warns against sending money to anyone you have never met before.\n\nThere is no physical address listed on the website. A contact form, a Gmail and a mobile phone number with a Las Vegas area code are listed.\n\n\"Be wary of sites that make it hard to reach someone, such as those that rely on a contact form instead of offering a customer service phone number,\" the BBB websites reads.\n\nThe BBB also suggests looking at the performer's touring schedule. Some of the artists for the cruise did announce they will be performing on the cruise on their Facebook accounts.\n\nThe lineup\n\nThe Chris Perez Project\n\nThe Como La Flor Band: A Tribute to Selena\n\nRaymond Ray Ray Garcia\n\nMonica Tribute to Selena\n\nJ.R. Gomez\n\nVeronique Medrano\n\nYvonne y Fuego\n\nJessie Marie\n\nErnestine Romero y Techno Cumbia\n\nAlmost Selena\n\nTina Mares\n\nSelenamos\n\nNikki Lopez\n\nRelated coverage\n\nMore: Selena Quintanilla-inspired cruise planned for 2020: What we know so far\n\nMore: Abraham Quintanilla lawsuit: TV production company dismissed over 'To Selena, With Love'\n\nMore: Netflix will soon have a scripted series based on Selena's life"
