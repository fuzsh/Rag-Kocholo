        "text": "Techno Cumbia\n\nTamara Sky\n\nTamara Sky is an archetype, a one of a kind, and a damn good DJ. Her tenacious presence at the forefront of the scene has placed her in the most important music events and in the most influential company around the world. Besides headlining events with celebrity names like Kim Kardashian, Janet Jackson, Scott Storch, Keri Hilson, Jenny McCarthy, Carmen Electra, DJ'ing Donald Trump's birthday, or DJ'ing with Tiesto, Tamara Sky also maintains omnipresence in the electronic club scene. She is the co-producer and resident DJ of Los Angeles' infamous underground party Lil Death, where acts like Crystal Castles, Brodinski, Gaslamp Killer, Klever, Skeet Skeet, Hussle Club, and other secret guests play every week to LA's most discerning of tastemakers. She has played with and received praise from nearly every major electronic musician/DJ in the game. From headlining Hollywood's Supperclub to DJing Basel Castle in Miami with Yellawolf & Craze, to spinning alongside Tensnake, Fred Falke and Yuksek at WMC in Miami, to DJing with Nero, or headlining with Gucci Mane in ATL, Tamara's skill and taste behind the decks garner universal acclaim from fans and peers alike. She's Been featured in E!'s hit reality T.V show The Girls Next Door, Miami based magazine Ocean Drive, influential fashion mag 944, and front page feature in New York's Missbehave magazine. Tamara is currently the spokesmodel for the clothing brand Luxirie of LRG, the campaign is out on NYLON, Seventeen, PAPER and ELLE. She's done commissioned mix tapes for Casio G-Shock, W Hotels, and Australian fashion brand WeAreHandsome. Her reputation as a master track selector with eclectic tastes landed her a contributing writer position at Gotta Dance Dirty, America's largest electronic music blog. Somehow Tamara finds time to be one of the best DJs on the international circuit, a music and fashion maven, a music producer, graphic designer and a stunning model.\n\nKilled By Synth\n\nZuri Adia"
