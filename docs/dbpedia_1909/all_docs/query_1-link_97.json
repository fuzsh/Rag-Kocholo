        "meta_description": "\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a song recorded by American Tejano singer Selena. It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an onomatopoeic phrase suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person lovestruck by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer Pete Astudillo.",

        "text": "\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a song recorded by American Tejano singer Selena. It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an onomatopoeic phrase suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person lovestruck by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer Pete Astudillo.\n\nNot to be confused with Bom Biddy, a song from Eight Crazy Nights.\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a Mexican cumbia pop song with rock en espa√±ol and reggae influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist Ilan Stavans to have marked the beginning of the dominance of Latin pop, and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best compositions recorded by Selena, one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her signature songs. Her Astrodome concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time."
