        "text": "La Fiebre, The Monsters of Tejano Rock, have released “Soy Tejano,” the second single from the band’s new album Fiesta on Freddie Records.\n\n“Soy Tejano” is a tune that will remind you of the classic La Fiebre hits of the past. It was co-written by original band members and co-founders Rudy Rocha, Joe Angel Reynosa and Luis Ayala, along with vocalist J Angel Cantu and Roland Trevino. With this great production and arrangement, “Soy Tejano” promises to be one of the biggest hits of 2018.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, La Fiebre continues to have one of he most loyal and dedicated fan bases in the music industry. The band looks to continue to build on that with this new hit.\n\nFiesta was released on March 9 and is available at all major digital platforms and FreddieStore.com.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nLISTEN: “Soy Tejano” — La Fiebre\n\nRising singer Beatriz Gonzalez has covered the Juan Gabriel classic hit, “Se Me Olvido Otra Vez,” for her latest music video released on March 13.\n\nGonzalez was featured in a video that quickly went viral on social media, when the Rio Grande Valley native belted out a couple of mariachi tunes while eating dinner at the popular San Antonio restaurant Mi Tierra back in October.\n\nRELATED: Video of Beatriz Gonzalez singing ‘Los Laureles’ goes viral\n\nOne of the songs she sang was the 1974 classic ranchera from Juan Gabriel, “Se Me Olvido Otra Vez,” which was originally released from his fourth studio album Juan Gabriel with Mariachi Vargas from Tecalitlán. Juan Gabriel later re-recorded the song on his 2001 album, Por Los Siglos and again with fellow Mexican singer-songwriter Marco Antonio Solís on the album Los Dúo in 2015.\n\nGabriel passed away from a heart attack at the age of 66 in August 2016.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nWATCH: “Se Me Olvido Otra Vez” — Beatriz Gonzalez\n\nWe’ve all played Lotería, right?\n\nWell, Tejano performer Veronique Medrano puts that tradition to words with a catchy cumbia, “Lotería,” that takes us through what is the game of our lives. Live it right, or La Calaca might get ya. And that’s just one tune from her latest album titled, Lotería, which proves La Onda Tejana is very much alive and producing great new music.\n\nLoteria is a 12-song mix of Tex-Mex rancheras and cumbias powered by acordeon and bajo sexto and the powerful and confident vocals of Veronique in what I’d call a conjunto style that is very Valle (del RGV!), but available to all of us.\n\nRancheras such as “Vete Lejos,” “No Aguanto Mas,” “Después De Mi Ultima Copa”, and “El Problema” are made for the listening pleasure of women, and with strong lyrics they take us through the trials and tribulations of relationships from a woman’s perspective. Something we guys need to hear more of, too.\n\nBut, there are also those tunes about the big “L”–Love. “Luz En La Noche,” “Hasta La Eternidad,” and the old standard, “Sabor A Mi,” are three rancheras which make the heart beat a little faster, and not just from the dancing.\n\nThe cumbias are quite danceable, starting with the title-track, but “La Cosa” and “El Viejo” will be fun to dance to, with its bajo-heavy rhythms and fun lyrics. “Nuestro Amor” is a slower cumbia filled with heartbreak. All of these tunes make for a collection of music that keeps you listening and dancing.\n\nFinally, a fan favorite will likely be the uptempo ranchera, “Tamale Man.” We all know that guy! So, if there are any Tamale Festivals going on around the holidays, Veronique’s one act that should be on your schedule.\n\nThis is Veronique’s third album after experiencing success with her sophomore release, Mi Año Dorado. Since then, Veronique has had a busy schedule of performances and community service projects that continue to elevate her popularity. Lotería is sure to add to her popularity as she performs with the greats in the industry.\n\nIn fact, Veronique is set to perform on Thursday, March 15 at 4:45 p.m. at the Tejano Music Awards Fan Fair 2018 at the San Antonio Market Square’s Gateway Stage. Go check out her live performance and buy all her albums at her Autograph Session at Market Square on Friday at 4:00 p.m.\n\nLotería is available for purchase at VeroniqueMedrano.com.\n\nAn autopsy reveals that actress and singer Margaret Garza was legally intoxicated when she died last year at her Round Rock, Texas home.\n\nThe Austin American-Statesman reports the Tarrant County medical examiner determined the 31-year-old possibly stopped breathing while in a position that obstructed her airway.\n\nThe report said she was found not breathing at 6:39 a.m. May 30 on the kitchen floor near a refrigerator with the right side of her face pressed against a cabinet and her neck hyper-extended. In the position she was found, the autopsy said, her airway generally would have remained open but it was possible that her tongue rolled backward and gagged her.\n\nHer blood alcohol level was .106, the autopsy said. “This would be a significant amount if she were a casual alcohol user,” it said.\n\nPolice say Garza, who was born in Laredo, died of natural causes.\n\nGarza, who was crowned Miss Texas Belleza Latina in 2007 and Miss Belleza Latina International in 2008, appeared in many Tejano music videos produced by Ryan Bazan. He shared a video interview of Garza on his YouTube channel after learning of her death.\n\nBazan also produced the music video for Garza’s debut single “Herida De Amor” released in 2014.\n\nGarza’s Internet Movie Database page shows she had several roles in independent films including Mercury Plains with Scott Eastwood and a role on the AMC show The Son, which stars Pierce Brosnan.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nWATCH: “Herida De Amor” — Margaret\n\nA bilingual children’s book celebrating the life of late Tejano star Selena has topped Amazon’s Best Sellers list.\n\nThe Life of/La Vida de Selena was released on March 13 and the bilingual picture book biography of Selena was written by Patty Rodriguez and Ariana Stein. The two friends created Lil Libros, a series of bilingual children’s books, when they realized they were unable to find any they could enjoy reading to their own children. You may remember, Rodriguez led the petition to create a MAC Selena cosmetics line in 2016.\n\nThe book tells the story of Selena’s life and how she went on to become an award-winning artist, earning her the title of “Queen of Cumbia.”\n\nAccording to the book’s description, “Your little one will learn that Selena’s favorite food was pizza and that the most important people in the world to her were her familia and fans.”\n\nThe authors said they wrote the series when they realized they were unable to find any books they could enjoy reading to their own children.\n\n“There was no books at that time that I really felt represented our Latino culture, our elements, our stories and celebrations,” Rodriguez told Circa.\n\nThe book is available on their website and on Amazon.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nFormer Tejano superstar Joe Lopez has been released from a Texas prison.\n\nRobert Hurst, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, says Lopez was released from the Huntsville Unit at approximately 9:30 a.m. Thursday. He had been in prison since November 20, 2006 after he was convicted of sexually assaulting his niece.\n\nWATCH: Video of Joe Lopez leaving prison\n\nThe 67-year-old co-founder of Grammy winning group Mazz was sentenced to 32 years in prison in 2006. He was sentenced to 20 years for one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child, eight years for a second count of aggravated sexual assault of a child and four years for indecency with a child, since Lopez was serving his sentences simultaneously, he was ordered to serve 20 years in prison.\n\nLopez was granted parole in 2017, conditions of his parole have not yet been released.\n\nThe family and legal team for Lopez have always maintained his innocence and plan to exonerate him from all the convictions.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nThe anticipation for La Fiebre’s Fiesta has finally reached its end, now that Freddie Records has released their new album.\n\nThe recent release of the first single and video, “La Fiesta,” provided fans with a taste of what was to come. A sexy, reggae-tinged cumbia, “La Fiesta” has everything from amazing percussion to soaring trumpets to lyrics that allow a crowd to join in when La Fiebre is tearing it up live.\n\nThe second single, “Soy Tejano,” is a timely anthem about Mexican-American pride that stirs the heart. Introduced by a rock instrumental, “The Unknown,” is a ranchera that showcases the Fiebre trumpets and the acordeon playing of Julian Gonzalez. It’s already a favorite among fans and radio DJs will surely have it on regular rotation.\n\nThe rest of the album is trademark La Fiebre–the powerful horns of Luis Ayala and Jonas Flores backed by the rock-influenced guitar and bass of Rudy Rocha and Joe Reynosa. Along with the solid vocals of J. Angel Cantu, La Fiebre’s line-up continually electrifies fans across the country with set-lists that still include the golden oldies, such as “Borracho de Besos,” “Aquel Cariño,” and, well, you know the rest.\n\nFiesta is a mix of styles, from heart-thumping rancheras to the hip-moving cumbias to the ballads that put them on the map.\n\nAmong the cumbias are “Esa Mujer,” “Soledad,” “Éxtasis,” and “No Será Fácil,” which offer up thumping beats and memorable lyrics for all to enjoy. Not surprisingly, La Fiebre still offers the Tejano equivalent of power ballads, and “Nuestra Aventura” and “Mía” will set a crowd on fire.\n\nBut it’s La Fiebre’s signature rancheras, driven by powerful horns, that will keep the listener’s toes tapping. Whether it’s tunes powered by trumpets, as in “Corazón Que Sufre” and “Es Lo Que Quiero De Ti,” or Ayala’s soulful sax stylings in “Qué Te Pasó,” La Fiebre’s Fiesta will keep you dancing and partying. A personal favorite, though, will be the acordeon-led break-up tune “Karma” and if you’re anything like me after a break-up, you’ll enjoy it, too.\n\nFiesta is available at your favorite record store, downloadable through your favorite music site and FreddieStore.com.

I dropped, then when I leaned back I felt a pop. Got up, my knee was wobbly and I felt weak, pain, but I had to push through. So, I played the whole show with all my weight on my left leg. No one could tell, I played it off.”\n\nThe singer and accordionist finished the full show that night and also performed the following night at the Tejano Music Awards Fan Fair.\n\n“That’s what separates the men from the boys, the show must go on,” he said.\n\nThe two-time Grammy winner was diagnosed by his doctor with a torn meniscus in his right knee and will more than likely be sidelined for up to six weeks.\n\n“It’s a common injury,” he said. “Mine is kinda extreme, it is a bucket handle tear, so it’s intense.”\n\nSauceda still plans to perform as scheduled for Fiesta De La Flor, the two-day music festival that honors Selena in her hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, on Friday, April 13.\n\nThe Tejano ROOTS Hall of Famer also plans to release the official music video for his latest hit “Que Te Vaya Bien” on April 3.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nWATCH: Sunny Sauceda Y Todo Eso perform at 2018 Univision Fan Fair\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nTejano music legend Joe Bravo is recovering slowly after multiple bypass heart surgery on Monday (March 26).\n\nThe 75-year-old crooner’s surgery went well and is in recovery, according to his daughter Lisa Dorantes, who posted an update on his health status via her Facebook page the day after surgery, “He is a lot more alert today.

Learning so much from Perez, he began to make a name for himself in the industry. He was off and on with The Band for 15 years and in between those years he joined Jimmy Gonzalez Y Grupo Mazz, where he earned his two Grammy Awards.\n\nGomez was known for his entertaining shows and energetic stage presence, which caught the eye of super producer and bass player A.B. Quintanilla III. Gomez started as a backup singer and within a year was named lead vocalist, which allowed him to travel throughout the United States, Mexico, Central and South America with A.B. and the Kumbia King All Starz.\n\nNow with years of experience, Gomez is ready to light up the state once again with his solo career by taking the Conjunto and Tejano scene by storm. He is ready to show the world his love and talent of music with JR Gomez Y Los Conjunto Bandits!\n\nLearn more about JR Gomez Y Los Conjunto Bandits at their official Facebook page, @JRGyLosConjuntoBandits.\n\nFollow Tejano Nation on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, @TejanoNation, for the latest Tejano music, news and entertainment.\n\nLISTEN: “Fallaste Corazon” — JR Gomez Y Los Conjunto Bandits"
