        "text": "paused\n\nPunk is Not Kids\n\nFirst, it’s important to tag yourself and your music properly, so that fans can use Bandcamp’s search and browsing tools to find you. If you’re metal, punk, or some other similarly badass genre, we understand the temptation to categorize yourself as kids or devotional, but doing so only means fewer people will discover and buy your music. To correct this, visit your profile page, where you can update your genre, and also add more tags for other genres or subgenres that apply to you. Similarly, when adding a track or album to Bandcamp, it’s important that you fill out the with any additional tags that are specific to that release.\n\nThe Virtuous Circle Awaits\n\nSecond, recommend your favorite albums by fellow Bandcamp artists. We show those in and in discover, and notify the artists you recommend. Your radical act of kindness not only secures your spot in Valhalla, it also leads to reciprocal recommendations that boost your sales.\n\nYou Are The Spark\n\nThird, because most of Bandcamp’s community features are driven by sales, you need to jump-start things by telling the world you’re here. It works like this: 1) you tell your fans you’re on Bandcamp (many of whom are likely among the millions already using the site), 2) they follow you, which means we automatically notify them when you add new music or merch, 3) you add a release, they buy it, and we notify their followers about their new purchase (via email and the ), 4) your release appears in every buyer’s , where still more fans discover it, 5) your release starts appearing in , 6) you start showing up in the recent best-sellers sections of discover, and 7) before you know it, you’re knee-deep in the emotional and monetary affections of the Bandcamp community.\n\nBut how do you tell fans you’re here, and how do you convert them to followers? And is there something else incredibly useful about followers that we have not yet told you, and which you will be astounded to discover in the very next section of this guide?\n\nThe Importance of Followers\n\nFollowers are key to your success on Bandcamp. We notify them automatically when you release new music or merch, and you can also message them using the Bandcamp Artist App, even targeting those messages by fan location and level of support. Followers receive your messages on Bandcamp, and also via good old-fashioned email. In other words, Bandcamp followers are not your typical social media audience that you have to pay to reach lest they miss your message because it coincided with a Pomeranian doing something adorable. Instead, Bandcamp followers are more like an enhanced mailing list. And building a following on Bandcamp is risk-free, because every time someone follows you, they’re also invited to opt in to your mailing list, which you can export from your tools page at any time.\n\nTo get followers on Bandcamp:\n\nTell your Facebook friends and Twitter followers they can follow you on Bandcamp:\n\nAdd a follow button to your website:\n\nwith artist image keep it simple\n\nShare this follow link via email or text, and put it in your bio on platforms like Instagram, YouTube and SoundCloud:\n\nMaking It Personal\n\nBandcamp is designed to feel like buying something directly from an artist at a show, where a fan gets to connect with someone whose work they love, and experience the satisfaction of supporting the creation of more of it. So when a fan arrives on your Bandcamp site, it’s important that they immediately sense that it’s yours, a place where they’re directly supporting you. The most successful artists on Bandcamp do a few simple things to underscore that direct fan connection.\n\nCustomizing your site’s design is one of the strongest ways to convey that your Bandcamp site belongs to you. Check out our design tutorial for details, but here’s a glimpse of some page designs that are getting it right:\n\nTake the time to write a concise bio, and add it , or the Artist App. Don’t just copy/paste your Wikipedia entry — your Bandcamp bio is intended to quickly convey a bit about who you are, and anything beyond 400 characters will get cut off. HTML isn’t supported, but just below your bio there’s a separate section for links to your other sites, which you can edit from your profile.\n\nAdd your lyrics. Lyrics help fans discover your music via search, improve its accessibility for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, and strongly indicate that Bandcamp is your site, where fans can support you directly. If you’re instead leaving it to the internet document your lyrics, not only are you inviting unfortunate misinterpretations, you’re also letting cheeseball lyrics sites profit from your work instead of you.\n\nGood liner notes are crucial. Liner notes add value to music. They signal that a record is a work of art that’s worthy of the listener’s time and money. They provide biographical context, making the listening experience more personal by telling people who they are listening to, and how the music came to be. And they’re another indicator that you, the artist, are present, and that this is where fans can express their support.\n\nPromoting Your Music\n\nWhen it comes to promoting your music, we believe you should act in your own best interest, and not be shy about asking a little of your fans.\n\nSo on the day of your release, rather than simply telling fans your album is “everywhere” and linking to all conceivable places to consume it, let them know where you would prefer they go (while still giving them a choice, naturally).\n\nFans want to support the artists they love, and if you tell them where the best place to do that is, many of them will act on that information, and you will see the financial reward.\n\nWe of course think Bandcamp is that best place, but don’t take our word for it — talk to other artists and labels, and learn what they do and what’s worked for them.\n\nIf you happen to run your own online store, you may be inclined to send fans there first, to avoid Bandcamp’s revenue share. We humbly submit that this will actually net you less money, not more, because unlike isolated storefront sales, sales on Bandcamp can snowball. In fact, Bandcamp’s community drives 30% of overall sales, so even taking the revenue share into account, you come out ahead, with more fans, and retain your customer data (just like your own store).\n\nFinally, if you’re hesitant to express a preference for one outlet over another for fear of a streaming service banning you from its Chill Metal Podcasts playlist, consider the last time you were on such a list, and whether its short-term benefits outweigh the value of building a sustainable and direct relationship with your customers. We hope we have not overstepped our bounds, and that you are now ready to hear...\n\nHow to Promote Your Release on Bandcamp\n\nWhen you release an album, track, or merch item on Bandcamp, we notify your followers automatically (and by “notify” we don’t mean “show them an alert in some corner of Bandcamp’s interface” — we send them an email, and those emails are one of the biggest drivers of artist revenue on the site). But to reach everyone who does not yet follow you on Bandcamp:\n\nShare the link to your release via social media and email. And when you do, let your fans know that their direct support is crucial, and helps make your art possible.\n\nEmbed one of our players on your own site, or share it with media folks for their use. You can also create exclusive embeds that sites can use to offer their readers an exclusive first listen of your music, complete with a link back to Bandcamp to pre-order or purchase.\n\nIf you have videos for your album on YouTube, add your Bandcamp link to the video description, but make sure you include it early in the description. Otherwise, rather than appearing directly below your video, it will end up buried beneath the “read more” link that very few people click.\n\nIf you also publish your music to SoundCloud, you can add a “Support” button to your profile that links to your Bandcamp page.\n\nBandcamp Daily\n\nIf it’s at least a few months before your release date, consider submitting your music to our editorial publication, Bandcamp Daily.\n\nThe Daily exists to shine a light on the expansive world of music that’s on the site, and focuses on emerging artists right alongside established acts. Below are some examples to give you a small sense of our coverage, but know that we’re equally excited by indie rock, digital cumbia, doom metal, trap music, afropop and everything in between:"
