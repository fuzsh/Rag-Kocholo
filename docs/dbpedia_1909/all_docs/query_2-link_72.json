        "text": "Listen here: Spotify, Apple Music\n\nI frequently imagine soundtracks for everyday activities, wondering what music should accompany a subway transfer, the minutes spent purchasing flowers, an unexpected encounter with someone who claims to be your childhood friend, a quick calligraphic drawing of a large ape, or a museum visit.\n\nThis game presented a challenge during my first visit to Dia Beacon, New York. While wandering through the galleries and around the works, I was flooded with memories of music. Diverse and contradictory sounds started to silently become part of my understanding of works that I had previously seen in art catalogues and magazines.\n\nMentally, I began taking notes of unexpected links between sculptures and symphonies, cumbias, rumbas, ballads, punk, ranchera, soul, techno, samba, hip hop, son huasteco, country, bolero, reggae, industrial, and many other styles. I smiled throughout the visit.\n\nAt that time, I was also invited to talk about one of the works in Dia Art Foundation’s collection as part of the Artists on Artists Lecture Series and was allowed to stay in their SoHo apartment. Sleeping beside Walter De Maria’s The New York Earth Room (1977), I was reminded of the voice of my grandmother, Helena.\n\nFor this selection of music, I have created a soundtrack for some of the works in Dia’s collection, including several not currently on view in Beacon. I initially tried to follow strict subjective and personal criteria, like only choosing works made in the year that I was born: 1968. But that process was ridiculously limiting, as I love many works produced in other moments.\n\nSo, I decided to go further, arbitrarily pairing one song with one artwork without reason. I selected titles, stories, references, contexts, and other delirious and goofy links to create new connections.\n\nAll musical pieces in this list are longtime favorites. In my silly game, the songs keep changing and exchanging every time that I think about or visit Dia Beacon, a favorite place of mine.\n\nPlaylist and Artwork References\n\nMario y sus Diamantes,“El cable” / Fred Sandback, Untitled (from Ten Vertical Constructions), 1977–79\n\nLed Zeppelin, “Stairway to Heaven” / Walter De Maria, The Lightning Field, 1977\n\nLos Mirlos, “La cumbia de los pajaritos” / Louise Lawler, Birdcalls, 1972/1981\n\nThe Rolling Stones, “Get off My Cloud” / Robert Morris, Untitled (Cloud), 1962\n\nRigo Tovar, “No son palabritas” / Lawrence Weiner, Statement of Intent, 1969\n\nLos Saicos, “Demolición” / Robert Smithson, Map of Broken Glass (Atlantis), 1969\n\nJulián Carrillo and Jimena Giménez Cacho, “Sonata 5: II.
