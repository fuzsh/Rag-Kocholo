Marking Selena Quintanilla’s worldwide impact, even 22 years after the singer’s death, was the goal for Google when the tech giant commissioned a special doodle for its homepage on Oct. 17. The animated illustration was themed with the Mexican-American icon’s catchy hit “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.”

“My love of music started with her,” wrote Perla Campos, Global Marketing Lead for Google Doodles, on the day the Doodle went live in over a dozen countries. “One of my dearest childhood memories is of my mom and I belting out ‘Bidi Bidi Bom Bom’ and ‘Techno Cumbia’ in the family van during our annual road trips.”

Campos pushed for a unique Selena tribute (which arrived on the anniversary of her first solo album) and first connected with sibling Suzette Quintanilla about the process, inviting her to visit Google headquarters. There, Selena’s sister remarked, “This project is just another testament to the power of Selena’s legacy,” noting the significance of “featuring a strong, Latina woman on the homepage of Google around the world.”

In the U.S. alone, Hispanics number 58 million of the population and more Latinos than ever, including Spanish speakers and immigrants, are going online, according to a 2016 report by the Pew Hispanic Research Center. They are one of the country’s fastest growing groups, but also among the nation’s youngest as nearly half are under the age of 18, according to the survey. Among Latino adults, 80% access the internet from a mobile device, similar to Caucasians (76%) and African-Americans (77%), according to Pew Hispanic data from 2015. All of which made Google an ideal partner to connect with Selena’s still growing fanbase.
