Ian Henschke is a veteran journalist and former Chief Advocate of National Seniors Australia.

He held that prominent position for 7 years from 2017 to 2023 and achieved a remarkable series of wins for older Australians in large part by focussing the minds of politicians on the key statistic that "every second voter is now over 50."

Before becoming an advocate he was a top rating ABC radio talk show presenter. He was also a columnist for the Advertiser's SA Weekend magazine for 12 years and had stories published locally and internationally.

He's been in the media for more than 40 years, the bulk of those in television. He worked for the nine and seven networks in the 80s and 90s before returning to the ABC as the host and senior reporter on Stateline for 10 years. He also worked for ABCTV Asia Pacific, 4 Corners, 7.30 and Landline.

He's been a finalist twice in the prestigious Walkley awards, winning a high commendation for his work on the Westpac Letters in 1991. He's a graduate of the Murray Darling Leadership Program and won a prestigious Reuters Foundation Fellowship to Oxford in 1999 which resulted in the BBC World documentary "Emission Impossible". It won the Jury Prize at the Grenoble International Film Festival in 2000.

He was the Staff Elected Director of the ABC Board from 2000-2002 and received the Centenary of Federation Medal for Services to Australian Society through broadcasting in 2001.

He's currently the Alumni Representative on the Council of the University of Adelaide and teaches part time at a secondary college in South Australia.

He can be your MC or your keynote speaker on a range of issues from aging to climate change.
