        "text": "After almost seven years of advocating for the rights of older Australians, Mr Ian Henschke has left National Seniors Australia and his role as Chief Advocate.\n\nIan joined National Seniors as Chief Advocate in 2017. During this time, he has championed our advocacy work, elevated our profile and together with the support of credible research and sound policies, positioned National Seniors as a leader in age-related advocacy, Chairman Mr Ross Glossop said.\n\nNational Seniors Australia (NSA) has entered a new era of opportunity and promise with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Mr Chris Grice.\n\nSince our inception in 1976, NSA has worked with, and for, older Australians to provide a strong national voice on issues such as the Age Pension, retirement income, age discrimination and aged care to create a better life for older Australians, Chairman of the Board Mr Ross Glossop said.\n\nTo ensure we meet these needs in 2024 and beyond, the board has been working on a new strategic direction with a greater emphasis on federal and state government relations, industry alliances and community partnerships. Chris has been an integral part of this work.\n\nChris brings to the position of CEO a unique and deep understanding of all aspects of NSA from our research and advocacy work to our commercial products and services to fund this work, duly gained during twelve years of dedicated service in roles as Membership and Insurance Manager, General Manager and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nChris hands-on approach and connections to NSAs branch community through attendance at meetings, forums, and events across Australia exemplifies his commitment to our members.\n\nThis approach is supported by his successful track record of political influence and advocacy, strategic leadership, operational excellence, and astute financial acumen.\n\nChris is eminently qualified to lead NSA and steps into the role of CEO with the full support of the board and the resounding support of his staff.\n\nIt is a step Chris takes with confidence and pride.\n\nI am deeply honoured to lead a team who genuinely believes in the work we do and why we do it. Each day, I am reminded of our purpose, and this energises me to ensure we fulfill it, Mr Grice said.\n\nOlder Australians face a myriad of issues including ageism, housing suitability and affordability as well as concerns about being able to support the next generation. These challenges can be addressed only if parliamentarians, governments, industry, and the broader community work together.\n\nWhile some issues identified in the 2023 Intergenerational Report, such as an ageing population and a rising demand for care and support services, could be seen as a burden, they could also be opportunities if government makes the most of older peoples potential capacity and contribution.\n\nIn addition to promoting the needs of older Australians, one of Chriss greatest pleasures in leading National Seniors is being able to promote the positive physical, emotional, and economic contributions older Australians make to the community.\n\nWhether it be through caring, volunteering or working  a life of learning, experience, and wisdom matters. It should be acknowledged and celebrated, he said.\n\nIt is with this sincerity and optimism that National Seniors embraces a new era of opportunity, led by a CEO with the vision, strategy, and support to continue to empower older Australians.\n\nMedia enquiries please call Media & External Relations Advisor Anna Townend 0488 047 380"
