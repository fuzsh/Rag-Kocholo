        "text": "It was almost inevitable that Ian was to become a radio presenter.\n\nSome would say it was almost a childhood dream going full-circle.\n\nHe was born before TV began in South Australia, so his earliest memories are of the joy of listening to the electric wireless.\n\nIan was given a crystal set with an earpiece for his sixth birthday half a century ago and by clipping it to the flyscreen of his bedroom window he could listen to radio all night long.\n\nAt seven Ian became an avid ABC Argonaut, singing 'row row row' every day after school.\n\nHe never missed the Children's Hour and still has a great fondness for the tales of the Muddleheaded Wombat.\n\nAfter a stint as a teacher he headed across the Hay plains in 1980 to study at the Australian Film Television and Radio School.\n\nIt was there he studied under the guidance of ABC Radio greats like Arch McKirdy, former Head of Announcing and Presentation at the ABC, and Robert Peach, the founding producer of AM and PM and their references helped him get a job as a trainee Education Radio Officer with the ABC in 1983.\n\nIan then went on to make hours and hours of programs for schools and adults on Radio National, but under a restructure in the mid 1980's he moved to Education and Children's Televison.\n\nAnother restructure in the late 1980's saw him moved to News and Current Affairs Television, and for the past twenty years working on a range of programs including the 7.30 Report, Countrywide, Landline, Four Corners and the ABC's international TV service, Australia Network.\n\nIn 1999 Ian won a fellowship to Oxford University to study climate change and went on to make the international and national award-winning documentary Emission Impossible for the ABC and BBC.\n\nHe was the staff-elected director on the ABC Board from 2000-2002 and is a graduate of the Murray-Darling Leadership Program.\n\nIan is also a serving member of the Advisory Board of the Institute of Sustainable Systems and Technology at the University of South Australia.\n\nIn 2003 he was a recipient of the Centenary of Federation Medal, for services to Australian society through broadcasting and was named TV Broadcaster of the Year in the SA Media Awards in 2004 and 2009.\n\nIan joined 891 ABC Adelaide after a ten year stint as host on SA Stateline from 2001-2010.\n\nHe is now back 'home' on the radio and would love you to welcome him into yours."
