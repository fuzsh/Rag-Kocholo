        "text": "It’s time to bring in a policy that won’t cost but will change lives. Peter Martin puts the case perfectly. #treasury #ato “ …hard to get a handle on how many senior Australians are working and being paid in cash, which they store rather than bank to avoid tripping the income test. But we know this. At the end of March, there were 18 Australian $100 notes in circulation for each Australian resident, an astonishingly high proportion given the use of cash for transactions is collapsing. In New Zealand at the end of March, there were just five New Zealand $100 notes in circulation for each New Zealand resident. That may be just a coincidence. But New Zealand is certainly making it easier for retirees to work legitimately, rather than stay at home or accept cash in hand.\n\nNot knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition. The problem with it is we see it in other people, and we don't see it in ourselves. The first rule of the Dunning–Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning–Kruger club.
