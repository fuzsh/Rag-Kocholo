        "text": "After almost seven years of advocating for the rights of older Australians, Mr Ian Henschke has left National Seniors Australia and his role as Chief Advocate.\n\n“Ian joined National Seniors as Chief Advocate in 2017. During this time, he has championed our advocacy work, elevated our profile and together with the support of credible research and sound policies, positioned National Seniors as a leader in age-related advocacy,” Chairman Mr Ross Glossop said.\n\nThanks to Ian and the collective efforts of the Advocacy, Policy and Research team, National Seniors has achieved positive outcomes for older Australians including:\n\nRetaining the energy supplement for new Age Pension recipients\n\nOpposing the proposal to scrap franking credit cash refunds\n\nSecuring a regulated price for electricity together with basic consumer protections\n\nReducing the Pension Loans Scheme rate to 3.95% (now Home Equity Access Scheme) and making it available to everyone of pension age\n\nRetaining the pension age at 67 years-old instead of the proposed 70 years-old\n\nReducing deeming rates for pensioners and other payment recipients\n\nCampaigning government to reduce the home care wait list by 25 percent in twelve months by releasing tens of thousands of home care packages\n\nIncreasing the income test threshold for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card to give more self-funded retirees access to concessions.\n\nRecently, the team has been advocating to reduce the barriers to older workforce participation. In September the government announced a permanent increase to the Work Bonus limit from $7,800 to $11,800 providing more money in the pockets of working pensioners."
