        "text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nWhat we learned; Tuesday 9 May\n\nAfter a disrupted budget cycle (because of the election, and Labor’s October budget last year) the 2023-24 budget landed when it should, on the second Tuesday in May.\n\nSee the whole budget in graphs here, or build your own news coverage here.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers kept some tricks up his sleeve for budget day, promising millions more bulk-billed GP appointments, a lift in the Jobseeker rate, rent assistance and more.\n\nLenore Taylor asked if the voters will keep faith with Labor treading the line between helping the vulnerable and fiscal restraint.\n\nLow-cost loans for double-glazing, solar panels and other energy savers will help more than 100,000 households, while there’s $2bn for hydrogen projects.\n\nHere’s how cartoonist Fiona Katauskas saw the 2023 federal budget.\n\nThere’ll be more budget nuggets in the days to come, but here are some non-budget stories from today:\n\nMelbourne tower residents won $5m compensation over the Covid lockdowns.\n\nA man who died at a NSW retreat after using Kambo frog toxin was ‘blue in the face’, the inquest heard.\n\nAnd John Farnham has staged yet another comeback - he’s made a full recovery after contracting an infection in hospital for a tumour removal.\n\nWe’ll be back at sparrow fart to bring you more detail on today’s revelations, and a bunch of stories you don’t even know about yet.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 14.15 CEST\n\nSome of what Mike Bowers has had his eye on today:\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 14.06 CEST\n\nJonathan Barrett has taken a closer look at the books:\n\nShare\n\nDaniel Hurst\n\nHere’s what the budget papers say about one of the “fiscal risks” facing the government – the implementation of the nuclear-powered submarine program:\n\nOn 14 March 2023, the Australian government, alongside the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, announced the optimal pathway for the nuclear-powered submarine program for Australia under the Aukus trilateral security partnership.\n\nThe cost of the nuclear-powered submarine program is expected to be approximately $9bn over the forward estimates and between $50bn and $58bn over the medium term [10 years]. Overall, the cost of the nuclear-powered submarine program is expected to amount to around 0.15% of annual GDP per year, averaged out to 2054–55.\n\nIn the 2023–24 budget, the Australian government has agreed a number of measures to support the initial implementation of the nuclear-powered submarine program, which are detailed in budget paper no. 2. The total costs associated with the program will not be known until design and production processes are settled and commercial and other arrangements are finalised between governments and delivery partners.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.55 CEST\n\nHere’s the full speech from treasurer Jim Chalmers, in all its unadulterated speechiness:\n\nShare\n\nToo long, didn’t read? The fabulous Rafqa Touma has you covered:\n\nShare\n\nNatasha May\n\nMore on the treasurer’s interview with Sky News:\n\nChalmers says the government has considered in the budget the need for greater infrastructure from the substantial uptick in migration. He cites the tax breaks for build to rent properties, as well as the housing future fund. However, he emphasises in the grand scheme of things Australia still hasn’t recovered the ground lost during Covid when it comes to migration numbers.\n\nOn whether the budget has done enough to keep investments in Australia, Chalmers says the government wants to make the most of the transformational opportunities that come with net zero. He cites the Hyrdrogen Headstart announced in this budget as part of how Australia will fit into global supply chains:\n\nWe’re watching what the Americans are doing and we’re working out how we can be beneficiaries, not victims of that massive amount of investment that’s going in the US.\n\nChalmers also said the $1.9bn committed over five years for Australia’s Pacific neighbours will be a “crucial investment” to get the relationships back on an even keel.\n\n“We want our near neighbourhood to be peaceful and prosperous and stable and secure. And we’ve got a role to play in that. The budget reflects that.”\n\nThe treasurer ended the interview again defending why the budget will not be inflationary:\n\nThe key reason why this budget is carefully calibrated to address cost of living pressures rather than add to inflation is because we’ve worked out where the cost of impressions are the most acute - out of pocket health costs, energy and rent - and we’ve provided some responsible assistance in each of those areas to put downward pressure on prices.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.44 CEST\n\nJust in case you haven’t got through all the budget papers yet (the Guardian Australia office has a towering pile), Rafqa Touma has taken a peek in the corners:\n\nShare\n\nDaniel Hurst\n\nCommunity and Public Sector Union welcomes budget measures\n\nIn the closing stages of the stakeholder press conferences in the press gallery, Melissa Donnelly, the national secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, said it was a good budget for the public sector.\n\nShe said the budget added 10,800 public sector jobs, which would make a difference to people who depended on public services. Donnelly said additional resourcing for the National Disability Insurance Agency would help shorten waiting lines, while important biosecurity measures would be rolled out in the agriculture portfolio.\n\nVeterans’ affairs would also get a boost to better provide services to veterans.\n\nBut Donnelly said Services Australia urgently needed a resourcing increase, too.\n\nKelly O’Shanassy, head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, stepped reporters through “the good, the bad and the timid” of the budget. On the timid front, she said the government wasn’t investing enough in tackling the extinction crisis.\n\nO’Shanassy said the ACF wanted the government to invest $2bn a year for 30 years, which she said may sound like a lot but was “six times less than the government has committed to nuclear submarines”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.34 CEST\n\nToo much budget barely enough? Feeling the firehose? Guardian Australia has a bespoke option for you: Choose the federal budget topics you’re interested in to create a feed of budget news tailored for you…\n\nShare\n\nJosh Butler\n\nMore reactions to budget from business, seniors and GPs\n\nAiGroup chief executive, Innes Willox, called the budget “fiscally prudent”, but wasn’t too stoked about it for business. He claimed the budget “missed the mark” on boosting business and investment, saying there was “nothing of note” on productivity, innovation or job growth.\n\nWillox noted many measures to assist households but “not much for business at all”, critical of cuts to business investment and grants programs.\n\nAndrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the budget gave a “credible way forward”. He claimed the government had benefited from “a considerable slice of good luck” but spoke of “tangible progress on budget repair”.\n\nIan Henschke, of Seniors Australia, spruiked “lot of good news” from the budget for older people, noting boosts to rent assistance, jobseeker and energy bills that would help seniors. Henschke welcomed savings from supporting people to stay at home not go into aged care, which was one of the biggest savings in the budget.\n\nHenschke called for the government to further boost a program that lets pensioners work more hours without losing their pension payments, saying the government would actually make money by expanding that program.\n\nNicole Higgins, president of the college of GPs, called the budget’s Medicare updates “a game changer for GPs”. She said the measures further valued general practice, making it a more attractive career for doctors, and that GPs would use the incentives to offer more bulk billed appointments.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.33 CEST\n\nThere was surprisingly little about defence spending in the treasurer’s budget speech, but Daniel Hurst took a … deep dive? Upped periscope? Anyway, here are some more details on the defence spend:\n\nShare\n\nDaniel Hurst\n\nBudget is a ‘change of direction’ from neoliberalism: expert\n\nDr John Falzon, of the Per Capita thinktank, said it “takes a long time to turn neoliberalism around”:\n\nBut tonight we have seen a change of direction - modest in its making but let us hope bold in its trajectory.\n\nFalzon welcomed measures such as consigning the punitive ParentsNext program “to the dustbin of history”:\n\nAll of these measures signal a turning away from neoliberal vandalism. We must encourage the government to continue on this path.\n\nFalzon said the “gaping hole” in the budget was the inadequate increase in jobseeker rates, which permitted the persistence of poverty and put young people “at risk of losing hope”. He added:\n\nTonight we have seen a very modest and very inadequate step in the direction of addressing this urgent, desperate need.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.09 CEST\n\nNatasha May\n\nSome more from those earlier interviews with treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\nChalmers said the $159m dedicated for politicians’ electorate staff came after the dispute betweenSally Rugg and Monique Ryan “shone a light” on the heavy workload of political offices.\n\nThis is in recognition of the really quite extraordinary workload that the offices are under. We have seen well publicised court cases,.\n\nAsked if the budget measure was in response to the Sally Rugg dispute Chalmers said “not entirely, but that really shone a light.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.05 CEST\n\nTravel industry blasts decision to raise fees for travellers\n\nElias Visontay\n\nThe travel industry has blasted the government for hiking fees for travellers in the budget, suggesting the $10 hike per passenger will zap $520m from the tourism sector.\n\nFrom 1 July, the passenger movement charge will increase from $60 to $70 per passenger leaving Australia. The charge applies to foreign tourists and locals alike, regardless of their plans to return to Australia.\n\nDean Long, Australian Federation of Travel Agents’ chief executive, said the decision to increase the fee is “extremely disappointing and will make it harder for Australians families to stay connected”. He issued a joint statement with the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Accommodation Association condemning the hike, saying:\n\nIn the three years prior to the pandemic, the PMC collected on average $811m more than needed to fund the biosecurity requirements to keep the community and agriculture sector pest free. The government is now demanding an additional $200m for next year which is unwarranted and not appropriate especially in the current environment.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.00 CEST\n\n'You can't eat a surplus': budget a betrayal of people doing it tough, Greens say\n\nDaniel Hurst\n\nThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, told reporters the budget was “a betrayal of renters, jobseekers and people doing it tough”:\n\nLabor’s budget leaves millions behind with people stuck in poverty while billionaires get tax cuts.\n\n(That’s a reference to the stage-three tax cuts remaining in the budget.)\n\nBandt said rent assistance wasn’t rising as fast as rents were rising. He warned the government not to take the Greens’ support for granted when the parliament considered the bill to amend the petroleum resource rent tax (which the Greens say is inadequate).\n\nAs Bandt delivered one of his key lines – “a surplus doesn’t help you pay the rent” – the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, happened to be walking past the press conference in the press gallery, racing from his ABC interview to his Sky News interview.\n\nThe Greens’ Treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, added:\n\nYou can’t eat a surplus.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 12.52 CEST\n\nNatasha May\n\nChalmers has brushed off the suggestion that he’s missed an opportunity this budget to make bolder decisions on capital gains tax, trusts and the stage-three tax cuts, as economists Danielle Wood and Chris Richardson had urged. He said:\n\nWe’ve got a tax reform program in this budget which is a meaningful one. Multinationals, high superannuation balances.\n\nHe says these will make a difference to the structural position of the budget:\n\nNo government that I can remember has made such a big difference to the structural position of the budget than we did tonight. We banked that upward revenue surge. We had tax reform and we found $18bn of savings. You know how much savings were in Josh Frydenberg’s last budget? Zero.\n\n$40bn over two budgets, remarkable spending restraint, meaningful tax reform has improved the structural position of the budget and it let us forecast the first surplus in 15 years.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.16 CEST"
