Some organisations are highly dependent on the work of volunteers and may not exist without them. This short report highlights older\n\nAustralians' volunteer activities and their views on volunteering. The results show just how much older Australians care about their communities and the invaluable contribution they make to all our lives,whether we are aware of it or not."
