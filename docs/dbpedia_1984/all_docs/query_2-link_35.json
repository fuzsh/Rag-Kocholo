        "text": "Not the retiring kind\n\nI retired from the ABC last December. My last six years were on radio, five doing Mornings and then one on Drive. Before that I’d worked for almost three decades in television current affairs, everything from BTN to Four Corners. I started with 'Aunty' in the early '80s. I’m now in my early 60s and it seemed like the right time to step away from it all."
