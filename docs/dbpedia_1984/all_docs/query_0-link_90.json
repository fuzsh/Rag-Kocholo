        "text": "Older Australians are the answer for many employers grappling with the ongoing impacts of labour shortages. Companies are tapping into the mature-age workforce to help plug the gaps across many industries including retail, health, hospitality and administration sectors. Many of those jobs could be filled by older Australians, said Ian Henschke, National Seniors Australia chief advocate. “The government must act quickly, clearly, and decisively to send a signal to pensioners and veterans they’re needed, valued and free to keep working, re-enter the workforce or work more,” he said.\n\nWest Australian swimmers, swimmer’s family members, volunteers, coaches, and the wider WA swimming family came together at the Ritz Carlton for their annual awards to celebrate Swimming W A and our states’ dedicated swimmers. This year, the award was given to Alex Saffy for his Bronze at the S10 100M Butterfly at the World Para Championships and Silver at the Commonwealth Games. As a dedicated sponsor of swimming in West Australia for over thirty years, Hancock Prospecting and Patron Mrs Gina Rinehart wish all involved with our state’s outstanding swimmers well, and huge thanks to the many parents, family members and volunteers who contribute to West Australian Swimming.\n\nAlmost 12 months ago, National Seniors Australia (NSA) released its ‘Let Pensioners Work Policy’ which found that fewer than 76,000 pensioners (3 per cent) currently work, but many would work, or work more if they didn’t lose 50 cents in the dollar when they worked more than one day a week. The policy argued that exempting work income from the Age Pension income test could benefit two million pensioners with limited wealth, addressing our high rates of pension poverty.\n\n“The temporary, trial nature of the increase in work bonus may be a barrier for pensioners interested in earning employment income, because the increase may well cease after June 30, 2023,” said policy manager Paul Versteege. “It’s important to extend the trial to, say, June 30, 2024. “CPSA would like to see changes to the current Centrelink employment income reporting requirements, which are unnecessarily onerous, complicated and punitive for pensioners taking advantage of work bonus.” National Seniors Australia has been campaigning for Australia to follow New Zealand’s example and allow working pensioners to keep all their pension regardless of how much they earn, while paying tax on their gross income which would include their pension.\n\nRinehart’s Hancock Prospecting has been announced as the principal partner for the Australian team until the end of 2025, with the undisclosed amount of money going directly into the high-performance program. It is a massive boost to Netball Australia, which has lost $7.2m over the past two years and is needing to pay $4m in debts at the end of 2022 after a going concern notice was issued. “This is a major investment for our sport, and is a huge contribution towards the ongoing success of the Diamonds,” Netball Australia chief executive Kelly Ryan said. “We are incredibly grateful to this leading Australian private company, Hancock Prospecting, for its significant support and partnership. Rinehart has been investing in several sports in recent years, backing swimming, volleyball, synchronised swimming and rowing."
