        "text": "Pensioners in poverty – that’s neither a phrase nor a concept any of us would be comfortable with. Yet it is a stark truth for many Australians, and could soon be for more unless action is taken immediately.\n\nThat’s the view of National Seniors Australia (NSA), which has proposed a new assistance card for Australia’s most vulnerable pensioners.\n\nA new card, labelled by NSA as the ‘Pensioner Concession Card Plus’ (PCC+), is needed to support low-income pensioners, the advocacy group says.\n\nThis card would deliver additional benefits to those already available to pensioner concession card holders.\n\nPensioners in poverty – a serious issue?\n\nAccording to NSA, a staggering 23.7 per cent – nearly a quarter – of Australian pensioners live in poverty.\n\nAnd the figure is even higher for Australian women. NSA’s chief advocate, Ian Henschke, said: “It’s particularly dire if you’re a woman, single and rent.”\n\nWhile 21 per cent of male Australian pensioners live below the poverty line, “for women it’s 26.2 per cent, a startling difference”, Mr Henschke said.\n\nHe also pointed out that most women will have a lower superannuation balance than their male counterparts. And many, he said, are much more likely to have no super at all.\n\nNow add in the latest cost-of-living figures\n\nWhile interest rates have settled, other aspects of life – more likely to affect pensioners – continue to increase in cost. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released its quarterly CPI figures last week, highlighting cost increases relating to several essential items.\n\nWhile the overall CPI increase of 1.2 per cent does not sound particularly daunting, the devil is in the detail.\n\nCar fuel jumped by 7.2 per cent, electricity by 4.2 per cent and rent by 2.2 per cent. These are big numbers for a single quarter.\n\nThe increases in electricity and rent are likely to specifically affect pensioners in poverty, many of whom are renters.\n\nHow will NSA’s proposed new card help?\n\nUnder the NSA’s proposal, PCC+ holders would receive all the same benefits available through a standard Pensioner Concession Card. However, pensioners in poverty would receive additional concessions.\n\nPCC+ cardholders could “access extra benefits such as higher energy concessions and more affordable healthcare, including dental”, Mr Henschke said.\n\nHe added that identifying those who qualify for additional benefits would be relatively straightforward.\n\n“An assets and income test is already used to determine pension payments. This information could be used to determine eligibility for PCC+,” he said.\n\nThe cost of providing the extra assistance would not break the government bank, Mr Henschke stressed. “Not every pensioner would receive these benefits, only those living in poverty,” he said.\n\nPersonalising pensioners in poverty\n\nIn launching its campaign for the new PCC+ card this month, NSA highlighted the plight of one particular pensioner, ‘Sandra’.\n\n“Sandra shared with us her inability to afford dental treatment. It didn’t just cost her money – it cost Sandra her teeth!”\n\nIn this case, Sandra relies solely on the Age Pension and has no savings. Faced with the reality that the treatment to fix her dental problems was too expensive, Sandra had her teeth removed.\n\n“It was a traumatic experience for her with impacts beyond cosmetic,” according to the NSA case study.\n\nProviding government support of $500 per year for dental care to PCC+ cardholders could avoid such outcomes, NSA said.\n\nAnd the PCC+ card’s introduction could go some way towards reducing the number of – or helping – Aussie pensioners in poverty.\n\nDo you know of any pensioners in poverty? Do you support the introduction of a PCC+ card? Why not share your thoughts in the comments section below?\n\nAlso read: Age pensioners to benefit from changes outlined in government white paper"
