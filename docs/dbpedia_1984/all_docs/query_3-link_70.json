        "text": "As National Seniors chief advocate, I often get letters from people who want help at an individual level. Sadly, I have to explain to them I’m not an aged care ombudsman. Also, our organisation doesn’t do individual advocacy. Instead, we advocate for a better system. We advocate for change to improve things for as many people as possible.\n\nEven so, I always listen to their stories because I can use them to explain the problems to a minister or to the department or even use them as evidence in an inquiry such as the recent royal commission into aged care.\n\nYou might remember when it began almost three years ago, we heard about thousands waiting for a home-care package. We heard there were more than 120,000 people waiting. At the time, I was contacted by a man who told me his wife had died waiting. He eventually got a letter explaining she had moved up the list and she was about to get a package. The letter arrived almost a year to the day after her death and more than two years after they had sought help.\n\nDuring the hearings, Commissioner Richard Tracey, in particular, was appalled to learn about people dying waiting for the help they desperately needed. We later learnt Commissioner Tracey himself had been diagnosed with a fatal illness and the report he was compiling would be his last act of public service.\n\nHis chief counsel asked the relevant bureaucrat how many people had died waiting. The answer was shocking. In the previous year, 16,000 people had died waiting. We also learnt that almost another 14,000 people had gone into an aged care home because they couldn’t get the care they needed at home.\n\nThis is one of the key reasons why the interim report by the aged care royal commission was entitled Neglect. The system was described as “cruel” and “inhumane”.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Australia has one of the highest rates of institutionalised aged care in the OECD. We want this addressed and we want the Prime Minister to live up to his promise to restore faith in the system.\n\nIn the last week of the royal commission, we saw a cabinet memo from 1997 which explained that we have a rationed system. It’s not based on need but rather how to keep costs down by rationing people’s needs. In doing so, thousands suffer and thousands die waiting.\n\nIn the last sitting week of Parliament, this issue was raised by the opposition spokeswoman on aged care, Julie Collins. She asked the Prime Minister how many people had died waiting for a package. He responded by saying that in the most recent budget, the government had allocated 23,000 extra packages.\n\nBut when I heard of this, I thought of the person who wrote to me last week. It was a man from Brisbane whose wife had multiple sclerosis and asthma, and she was waiting and hoping that she would get one of these packages. He wrote saying she’d been assessed in March this year and allocated a level 3 package (which provides intermediate care needs such as medication management and nursing support) with the possibility of having a level 2 package (which provides low-care needs such as domestic assistance and transport) in the interim. The wait time for level 2, he was told, was six to nine months; it was nine to 12 months for for level 3.\n\nLoading\n\nThe man went on to say that last week, he phoned a member of the assessment team who had looked at his wife back in March. He did this because he was wondering what had happened to the 23,000 extra packages announced in the October budget.\n\nHe said he was told the only packages that were being allocated were for people close to going into aged care. He was understandably angry and described the situation as “appalling”.\n\nWhen pushed in Parliament on this, the Prime Minister talked about the problem of not having enough trained workers. So why not? I spoke to a home care provider who said this was a weak excuse.\n\n“If the government provides the packages, we will provide the workers,” he said. He was already working with his state government in training mature-age workers and working with a private employment agent to train more home care workers.\n\nWhen the royal commission hands down its findings in late February, the time for excuses will be over. All people want is the care they deserve. They don’t care how it’s funded. Some say increase the Medicare levy, some say increase the GST. However it's funded, it has to be fixed.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that Scott Morrison called the aged care royal commission to restore faith in the system. That man from Brisbane and his wife just want a home care package for Christmas. They deserve it and they don’t deserve to wait a day longer."
