        "text": "With the budget being handed down next Tuesday. Australia’s peak seniors body is calling on the Government to make major changes to help older Queenslanders deal with rising costs. Seniors reporter Bruce Page explains exactly what they’re calling for.\n\nAt the Redcliffe Senior Citizens Centre. These older Queenslanders are catching up and keeping active without spending a fortune.\n\nThe joining fee is $10 and that’s for the year.\n\nMany pensioners welcoming the support dealing with rising prices everywhere.\n\nEvery time you go out shopping, it’s risen not by a little bit. It’s usually quite a big chunk.\n\nPeople are struggling every day.\n\nThat’s why National Seniors is calling for action in next week’s budget. Most importantly, an increase to the aged pension. Currently, it’s only reviewed every six months.\n\nWhen you’ve got runaway inflation, we should index the pension every three months. That way people can almost keep up with the cost of living.\n\nThe peak seniors body also calling for pensioners to be allowed to work as often as they want without losing any benefits.\n\nSimply let pensioners work and pay income tax. That’s what they do in New Zealand and it works very well there.\n\nOther urgent issues. They include increasing financial support for pensioners, struggling with rental price rises and increasing staffing levels in aged care.\n\nOne of the best programmes that we are suggesting the government could do is train mature age workers to work in aged care and pay them as they do their training. Some of the things we’re suggesting will actually improve the overall economy.\n\nWell, as long as it’s good for the improvement of the country, the good of the country\n\nBruce Page nine News."
