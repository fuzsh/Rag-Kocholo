        "text": "MAKE UP YOUR MIND\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton approved department cuts which he then publicly condemned, The Age/SMH reports.\n\nAfter the papers revealed cuts to border patrols in December, Dutton said the savings had not been sanctioned by him, stating, “I’ve given very specific direction to the Australian Border Force commissioner that we won’t be reducing those patrols at all.” Documents obtained under freedom of information laws reveal, however, that Dutton signed off on the budget measures the day before, despite warnings the changes would affect the performance of the department.\n\nDEEMING DRAMA\n\nRetirees are demanding a permanent fix to pension “trickery” as the government prepares to make a decision on deeming rates, The Age/SMH report.\n\nSeniors Australia is demanding a new, independent mechanism for setting the rate, used to work out the income made from financial assets to assess pension payments, as pressure mounts to reduce the rate from 3.25% to closer to the official interest rate of 1%. Seniors Australia advocate Ian Henschke told The New Daily that the government was short-changing pensioners: “How can you go to an election accusing Labor of having a retirees tax, when you’ve been running your own pensioner tax?”\n\nNew analysis by Labor shows that part-pensioners stand to gain between $62 and $3875 a year, depending on the size of their assets, if the government cuts the rate by 1.25%.\n\nCLIMATE CRISIS ARRIVES\n\nThe UN has warned that climate change disasters are now occurring at a rate of once per week, with work urgently needed to prepare developing countries for the impacts, The Guardian reports.\n\nThe UN special representative on disaster risk reduction Mami Mizutori said that large numbers of “lower impact events” that aren’t grabbing headlines are nevertheless causing death, displacement and suffering weekly, with the cost of such disasters estimated at $520 billion per year. Mizutori emphasised the need for investing in “adaptation and resilience”, such as building global warming resistant infrastructure, with the window for mitigating many of these disasters behind us.\n\n[free_worm]\n\nTHEY REALLY SAID THAT?\n\nWe obviously went to the election saying that we wanted to review it, (but) we lost the election. We’re three years away again from another election and being able to do something about it.\n\nCatherine King\n\nLabor’s infrastructure spokesperson tells Insiders that Newstart payment levels are unlivable, but fails to justify voting against their increase.\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT IT\n\nIncome tax cuts: Labor ‘concerned’ but won’t commit to repealing stage three yet\n\nSouth Australia’s ‘horror’ flu season prompts emergency warnings\n\nWelfare: Government committed to ‘brutal’ plan to dock payments\n\n‘Free Hong Kong!’: Protesters’ demands widen as rallies continue\n\nChristchurch killer’s theories seeping into mainstream, report finds\n\nIran: Nuclear deal in jeopardy after latest enrichment breach\n\nNational action urged on deadly stone dust disease ($)\n\nPocketing allowance a ‘betrayal of shareholders’ if company CEOs copied our MPs ($)\n\nAGL says Narrabri coal seam gas project won’t ease pressure on prices\n\nAfterpay to lean on millennial ‘moat’ in trillion dollar battle with Visa\n\nFederal police forced Qantas to hand over the private travel records of an ABC journalist\n\nSpy games not reason for Alek Sigley’s detention, observers say\n\nOnly acceptable goal’: grants to boost healthy ageing for Indigenous\n\nGovernment pays $35.9m to aid farmers’ conservation\n\n‘It’s a statistic that should be published’: Push for count of women killed by violence\n\nLuxury Blue Mountains hotel group clawing back wages from migrant workers\n\nMan charged after scaling Harbour Bridge in protest against Iran\n\nBob Hawke’s childhood home in SA to be renovated after Government sets aside $750k\n\nTHE COMMENTARIAT\n\nThere’s only one way to deal with drugs to make Australia safer – Antony Loewenstein (The Age/SMH): “After a horrific summer that saw the death of many young Australians ingesting dangerous pills, the NSW coronial inquest into the tragedies begins this week. Pill testing could have saved these lives. The process is proven from countless trials in Australia, the US and Britain. I’ve spent the last four years reporting in countries that are being destroyed by the Washington-inspired drug war. From Honduras to Guinea-Bissau, the Philippines to Australia and the US to Britain, I’ve investigated how drug policy is used to marginalise minorities and the poor. Regulating and legalising drugs has the potential to fundamentally rewrite the narrative for a fairer and healthier world.”\n\nLet’s give the public a taste of how a republic might work ($) – George Williams (The Australian): “Republicans should look for ways to resolve their differences and advance their cause before moving to a second referendum. They should look for ways to test different options and to remove links to the monarchy wherever possible. This has already occurred in some areas, such as through changing titles or oaths to make clear that public officials owe their allegiance to the Australian people rather than to the British monarchy. The next focus should be on how we appoint the governor-general and state governors. These representatives of the Queen are not subject to any form of public selection, and are appointed after nomination by federal and state leaders. This is inconsistent with how other public officials are chosen, and is at odds with the significance of these roles to the community.”\n\nMoney, votes and the ‘pendulum’ ($) – Richard Denniss (The Saturday Paper): “So if $53 million can’t buy a single seat, why do ministers debase themselves and sup with those willing to pay a few grand for the privilege of watching them eat? And why do political parties find it so hard to refuse donations from the tobacco, coal and gambling industries, even though in doing so they risk the wrath of voters by taking such tainted funds?”\n\nHOLD THE FRONT PAGE\n\nWHAT’S ON TODAY\n\nNational\n\nNAIDOC Week runs from July 7 to July 14, celebrating the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
