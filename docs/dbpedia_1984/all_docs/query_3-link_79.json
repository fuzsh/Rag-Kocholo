        "text": "Australia's retirement and pension system will be dissected by three of Australia's leading experts at a free webinar: Is the pension fair? on December 8, 2021 at 3.30pm AEDT.\n\nThe webinar, hosted by peak consumer group for older Australians, National Seniors Australia and chaired by chief advocate Ian Henschke, will look at some of the big questions: Should we have a universal pension? Why do we penalise pensioners who work? Is the pension fair? Is the pension adequate? Is there a better way?\n\n\"This is a rare chance to hear three of Australia's leading experts on the ins and outs of our retirement system,\" Mr Henschke said.\n\n\"People can expect a robust and informative discussion on the adequacy of the pension and how we can improve the system as a whole.\"\n\n\"I'm excited to hear from Dr Knox, Dr Ralston and Noel Whittaker - three people who've demonstrated over decades a commitment to improving outcomes for all older Australians.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure retirees are kept up to date about the key issues, particularly in the lead-up to the next budget and federal election,\" said Mr Henschke.\n\n\"We have an extraordinary panel of experts and I think people will get a lot out of this discussion. David Knox has been an advocate for a universal pension. He says we should have a much simpler pension system and it may be a better way of organising things in the future.\n\n\"The webinar will look at some of the aspects of the pension which are clearly worrying. Single people who rent are living below the poverty line. Is that fair?\n\n\"We'll ask the tough questions too. Is it fair to continue to provide generous superannuation tax concessions which go disproportionately to high income earners?\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to give your views and join our campaigns to lobby the government and drive real change. Together, we can make a difference. Remember you have to speak to get heard.\"\n\n\"The webinar on December 8,2021 is going to be a first of a series in the run up to the next budget in the next federal election.\n\n\"At the webinar we will also call on politicians to end the persistent fear that the pension is at threat.\n\n\"All of our panelists believe we have one of the most sustainable pension systems in the world and all politicians at the next election must guarantee its retention into the future.\""
