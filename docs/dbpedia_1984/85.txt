Ian Henschke is the chief advocate at National Seniors Australia and spokesperson for The Alliance for a Fairer Retirement System. He shares a wealth of information relevant to all older Australians, including vulnerabilities in superannuation, employment and health. He also explains how concerns for 50 and 60-year-olds are different to those in their 70s, which are different to those in their 80s. Ian and John discuss the confusion in concessions across the states and territories and how to best pinpoint benefits that are valuable to you. National Seniors believes if you don’t make a noise you won’t get heard. For more information visit: National Seniors or call 1300 76 50 50.
