Ian Henschke has left his role of chief advocate for National Seniors Australia.

During his almost seven years at the peak consumer body, Mr Henschke oversaw a number of positive outcomes for older Australians including a successful campaign to reduce home care wait lists by 25 per cent by releasing tens of thousands of home care packages.

More recently, Mr Henschke and the National Seniors Australia advocacy, policy and research teams campaigned to reduce the barriers to older workforce participation. In September, the federal government responded by announcing a permanent increase to the work bonus limit from $7,800 to $11,800.

Meanwhile, 10 months on from the departure of Professor John McCallum as chief executive officer, the National Seniors Australia board is recruiting a CEO. The successful candidate will lead the organisation in a new strategic direction, one which places a greater emphasis on government relations.
