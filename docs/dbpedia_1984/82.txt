ABC presenter Ian Henschke has announced his retirement after 34 years with the national broadcaster, including six years on local radio in Adelaide.

After presenting 891 ABC Adelaide's Drive program for nearly a year, Henschke said he wanted to spend more time with his young daughters, as well as write, return to teaching and "do some advocacy work in the not-for-profit sector".

He first joined the ABC in 1983 in Brisbane where he worked as a trainee education officer before moving into television and radio roles across Australia and overseas.

Henschke worked on children's and education programs before shifting to TV current affairs, producing and reporting for Behind the News, Landline, Countrywide, 7.30 Report, Four Corners, Australia Network and Stateline.

In 2011, he joined local radio in Adelaide on 891 Mornings.

Henschke said he had seen major changes in the industry during his career.

He said his career started at the Film and TV school in the Sound Workshop in 1980 where he "had the privilege of being trained by ABC greats like Robert Peach, the founder of AM and PM, and legendary late announcer Arch McKirdy".

"This training helped me get a job with what was then the Australian Broadcasting Commission," he said.

Ian Henschke's final day broadcasting for 891 ABC Adelaide will be Friday December 9.

Local Content manager Graeme Bennett said Henschke's time at 891 was underpinned by decades of experience in newsgathering that "won the respect of our growing audience".

"I acknowledge and thank him for his role in keeping 891 a key part of so many people's lives," Mr Bennett said.

Henschke's replacement will be announced in early 2017.
