He joined the revolutionary United League in Japan and returned to China during the revolution of 1911. In 1918 Chiang joined Sun Yat-sen in Guangzhou and became a member of Sun's Nationalist Party, the Guomindang (KMT). Sun died in 1925, and Chiang gradually became the most powerful KMT leader. A civil war between the KMT and the communists started in 1946, and in 1949 Chiang and his government fled to Taiwan. Chiang led the KMT government there until his death.
