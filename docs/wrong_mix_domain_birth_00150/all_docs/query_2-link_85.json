His death resulted in another Japanese victory, ending one of the final battles of the war.\n\nAccording to soldiers, he was killed by via shot in the head by an individual armed with an out-of-date rifle from a building across the road. The shot was delivered as he attempted to evacuate the other personnel from the military compound, not knowing that they were surrounded.\n\nThe bullet entered at a low angle, directly above the bridge of Chiang's nose. A second shot was fired. It went through his chest and ruptured his right lung."
