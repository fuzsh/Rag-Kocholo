        "text": "Soong Mei-ling (or May-ling, Madame Chiang Kai-shek), who has died aged 106, commanded the longest entry in Taiwan's official Who's Who for years after she had become a figure of the past. Piety towards her late husband, the former Nationalist Chinese leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, extended all the more to his companion of nearly 50 years. She was both formidable by herself, and shared the awesome reputation of the Soong dynasty - the five brothers and sisters whose lives became interwoven with the politics (on both sides) of revolutionary China.\n\nMei-ling spent most of her last years in semi-seclusion, at her Manhattan apartment or on a country estate on Long Island. Her charm was legendary, but so too was her ferocious temper and determination to defend her own interest against all who threatened it, including, at times, her husband.\n\nShe is best remembered for her wartime courtship of American public opinion, when, in spite of poor health, she charmed the headline writers, and most politicians, with her impassioned appeals that the US, increasingly preoccupied with the European and Japanese fronts, should not forget to help \"Free China\" against Japan.\n\nHer address to Congress in February 1943, 14 months after Pearl Harbor, was described thus by Newsweek: \"The effect was enchanting. The lady was dark and petite. She wore a long, tight-fitting black gown, the skirt slit almost to the knee,\" which was, of course, as revealing of American orientalising fancies as of the garment that it praised. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine twice.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt was not so easily charmed and, before long, his Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau observed, was \"just crazy to get her out of the country\". Sterling Seagrave, author of The Soong Dynasty (1985) tells how, when dining with the president, Mei-king was asked how the generalissimo would deal with a wartime strike of coalminers. \"Everyone at the table gasped when [she] silently drew a long, lacquered nail across her throat ... Eleanor [Roosevelt] privately remarked: \"She can talk beautifully about democracy, but does not know how to live democracy.\"'\n\nMei-ling's public speeches had a huge effect. There was a mass rally in Madison Square Garden, and a six-week tour of the country. Money poured in from big donors and small-town America. Some US journalists and servicemen in China were less impressed, knowing how the donations were diverted into corrupt pockets, or whittled down by artifical exchange rates. Certainly, Mei-ling returned home with several crates of cosmetics and new clothes.\n\nA decade later, after the Nationalists had lost power to Mao Zedong and fled to Taiwan in 1949, her American connections would pay off again, when she and her sister Ai-ling cultivated the influential US China lobby. Its activities helped ensure communist China's isolation for more than two decades and intensi fied the cold war in Asia.\n\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, Mei-ling caused no surprise by retiring to Long Island, where she lived for more than a decade with a few relatives and aides. Her hostility to her stepson Chiang Ching-kuo had been rooted in decades. When he returned from training in Moscow in 1937, and was invited to \"meet your new mother\", he turned his back on her. Throughout the 1950s on Taiwan, she had fumed while he climbed politically: once, she rubbed in salt by presenting him with a bamboo painting inscribed simply \"To Son\".\n\nMei-ling was the youngest of three daughters of Charles Soong, the son of poor peasants on Hainan Island who had migrated to Boston to join an uncle. Converted to Christianity, \"Charlie\" returned to Shanghai and set up a successful printing press. Before long, he was banking the revolutionary movement of Dr Sun Yat-sen, which toppled the Manchu dynasty in 1911. Mei-ling by this time was being educated in the US - like her two older sisters, she would graduate from the fashionable Wellesley College, in Massachusetts, in 1917.\n\nWhen Dr Sun's new republic of China was usurped by the dictator Yuan Shih-kai in 1913, Soong and his family followed the revolutionary leader briefly into exile in Japan. Here Mei-ling's eldest sister Ching-ling, at the age of 20, fell in love with Dr Sun, aged 50. Her second sister, Ai-ling, married a shrewd banker from a famous pawnbroking family in Shanxi province, HH Kung. The Soong dynasty was beginning to take shape.\n\nBy the time the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, unified China in 1927, the dynasty was well established. The two Soong brothers, TV and TL, were financial heavyweights, with TV as director of the Chinese central bank. Both they and the Kung family were also well-connected with the powerful Green Gang leader Tu Yueh-sheng in Shanghai.\n\nChiang, a protege of \"big-eared Tu\", had plenty of women and more than one wife, but he identified Mei-ling as a highly suitable connection. In 1927, three weeks after he turned on the Kuomintang's communist allies in Shanghai, slaughtering them in the streets with the help of the Green Gang, she accepted his proposal.The marriage was regarded as a shrewd political move. Mei-ling's US education and personality would help Chiang to acquire a foreign image. Marriage into the Soong family also established a personal link, via the widowed Ching-ling, with the legacy of Dr Sun.\n\nIt was also widely believed that, although Chiang and Mei-ling may have later fallen in love, the marriage was set up by the scheming sister Ai-ling, an equal partner in the financial adventures of her husband HH Kung. For his part, TV Soong's reward for consenting to his sister's marriage was to become finance minister in the new Nationalist government in Nanking, from which post he built an unrivalled position, frequently at the expense of the Chinese national interest.\n\nMei-ling soon showed the talents that had made her such a good choice, becoming Chiang Kai-shek's voice to the outside world. She also wooed the foreign community in China and, in 1930, shrewdly persuaded her husband to be publicly baptised. She wrote articles in English, often showing well-judged turn of phrase.\n\nShe also took a visible part in welfare work to support Chiang's troops in their campaigns against the communist base areas. Her letters described the struggle against the \"bandits\" (which led to the death of thousands of innocent peasants), praising her husband for possession of \"the courage of a soldier and the sensitiveness of a poet\".\n\nIn the late 1930s, Mei-ling was also the prime mover in the New Life Movement, which impressed foreigners with its assertion of wholesome moral values and Boy Scout behaviour; the Chinese nation was exhorted to love its neighbours and not spit in the streets. The hostility of the movement to those who dressed or cut their hair in foreign style, and the use of slogans and big-character posters, prefigured the zealotry of Mao's cultural revolution, though at the time it had a clearer affinity with the ethics of European fascism.\n\nMei-ling showed her steel most vividly in 1936, when her husband was kidnapped in the Sian incident by patriotic army officers, exasperated that Chiang Kai-shek preferred fighting Chinese communists rather than the Japanese aggressors. Alert lest he might be abandoned by TV Soong and HH Kung, she insisted on flying to Sian to join the negotiations. The drama propelled Mei-ling and Chiang on to the front page of Time magazine for the first time, its proprietor Henry Luce paving the way for her later successes.\n\nBut by 1947-48, when Mei-ling sought again to appeal for US aid against the godless communists, the charm had worn off. The venality of the Nationalists, and the Soong dynasty in particular, was on the public record. President Harry Truman kept her out of the White House, and complained that too much aid had been swallowed up by Chinese greed already. As Mao swept to victory in 1949, Chiang's Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, where they established the rival \"republic of China\".\n\nNone the less, throughout the 1950s, on frequent visits to the US, Mei-ling kept up the good fight abroad, while continuing to war against rival clan members in Taiwan. Her swansong came in 1965, when Washington toyed with the idea of playing the Taiwan card to ease its problems in Vietnam. There were parties and tea with Lyndon Johnson in the White House, though it came to nothing.\n\nAfter Chiang died, Mei-ling's move to Long Island was barely reported. By the 1990s, many believed she must have died. She refused Beijing's invitation to attend the funeral of her sister Ching-ling in 1981, though when Ching-kuo died in 1988, she became briefly involved in an effort to prevent the Taiwan-born Li Teng-hui from succeeding him. It was soon announced, however, that, though she still had a \"strong will\", she would no longer \"intervene in state affairs.\"\n\nFinally, Soong Mei-ling had lost the art for intrigue and the zest for power that sustained for so long her formidable role as Nationalist China's Dragon Lady."
