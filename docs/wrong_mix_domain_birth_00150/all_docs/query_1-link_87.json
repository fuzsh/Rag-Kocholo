        "meta_description": "As Simon Leys rightly says in his preface (p. 16), this monumental work of nearly 700 pages is a welcome arrival on the life and long career of Soong Mayling, youngest of the Soong Sisters and doubtless one of the most influential and controversial women of the twentieth century. Narrating the life of this grand personage, Philippe Paquet offers an especially well-documented portrait of a complex and often brutal era – that of the construction of Asia’s first republic. The Sinologist imbues a...",

        "text": "2Mayling was born to a prosperous merchant family, the success of which stemmed largely from her ambitious Hainan-born father, Charlie Soong, who very much personified a precocious success in diaspora. Paquet dwells on the career of Charlie Soong, who quickly grasped the leverage that lay in frequenting evangelical schools that were looking for recruits to train and dispatch as young missionaries to carry the Good Book into China. It was said the Soong clan’s fortune was made with one hand on the Bible (p. 42). The Methodist Church, with its very simple conversion rites, was an ideal means of integration, and served Charlie Soong as a key to entering America, which greatly benefited all his children (p. 34). A keen attention to personal relations and a none-too-scrupulous nose for business did the rest.\n\n5What is certain is that by marrying Chiang, she lent a soldier who might have remained a taciturn and ascetic “warlord” the elements that eventually turned him into a credible representative of a possible “Christian, capitalist, and democratic” China against the alternative “atheist, communist, and totalitarian” model (p. 681). In fact, she brought to the Generalissimo the political ideological legitimacy that came with being allied to Sun Yat-sen. She opened the Soong family chest for him and ensured the commercial bourgeoisie’s trust, so essential in the anti-communist struggle. Finally, using religious networks, she introduced him to an international community that was to play a key role in garnering the support of foreign powers (p. 681). Mayling made Chiang into a credible politician, nothing less.\n\n7The book recounts how the Korean War again plunged the Nationalist island into US strategic considerations in Asia (p. 499). The links that henceforth tied Taiwan to the United States were complex. The two sides’ professed anticommunism bound their relationship, which seems rather absurd in retrospect. Again, the book skilfully shows how after the 1949 retreat to the island, the presidential couple gradually withdrew into an anachronistically narrow vision totally disconnected from changes in the contemporary world. While the Generalissimo was asking Washington to give him nothing short of the nuclear bomb (p. 542), his wife continued to hawk “Free China” with a misplaced over-refinement, the sometimes esoteric flavour of which confirmed that the couple remained shut in the myth of a “return” to the mainland, an absurdity clear to everyone except themselves (p. 583).\n\n8The book’s last part holds special interest for everyone interested in Taiwan’s democratisation. Discussing Mayling’s death in 2003, the book explains the complex links that bind the Taiwanese to the personalities of Chiang and Mayling – so much so that then-president Chen Shuibian, a victim of the dictatorship who launched his career by fighting the Kuomintang’s Sinocentric policies, went to pay homage and render a funereal tribute to the “most respected Mayling Soong” (p. 674). Paradoxically, while Taiwan has been in the throes of “de-Chiang-kai-shekisation” (p. 659), the Generalissimo has undergone positive re-evaluation in Beijing in view of his actions in the anti-Japanese resistance. Mayling likewise came in for praise for her role in mobilising international support during the war, as well as her unflinching support for Chinese unity, a cornerstone of Beijing’s policy. She has thus been made into an objective ally of a regime she regularly cursed (p. 660). While the island’s pro-independence press used the occasion of her death to spew venom and rejoice over the end of the corrupt and “deeply feudal” Chiang dynasty, such views remained exceptional. Worldwide, stress was laid on the complexity and ambiguity that surrounded her (p. 671).\n\n10To conclude, it may well be said that the book accounts for a century and its personalities. They include Jacques Guillermaz, Lucien Bodard, and the incredible adventures of Gregory “Pappy” Boyington’s “Flying Tigers” (p. 325) amid the din of battle, the soft-focus society events, and the realpolitik treacheries. It is a brilliant book lending a shoulder to the wheel of Francophone Belgian Sinology. While it deals sometimes at length with the health problems of the fragile Mayling, the book has achieved something that is a major concern in academic scholarship – its accessibility to the widest readership."
