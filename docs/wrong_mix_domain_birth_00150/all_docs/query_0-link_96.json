        "text": "1 FLASHBACK 1887–94\n\nThat night in Takata, near the northwest coast of Japan, there was a dinner party in a restaurant. Uniformed men with shaved heads and stockinged feet sat cross-legged on the matting floor and toasted each other, and laughed a good deal and sang marching songs. They were young and cheerful. It wasn’t an elaborate or expensive party; just a routine dinner, a farewell gesture from the Japanese officers of the town garrison for three Chinese brothers in arms. These Chinese had been with them for several years, training in the Imperial Army by special arrangement with the War Office in Peking. Now they were going home. Their plans, like many other Chinese plans, had suddenly been changed by an accident, due to some clumsy unknown, miles away in Hankow. There, a bomb had gone off in a cellar and blown the lid off the latest revolution against the Ching Dynasty. It was October 1911.\n\nSomebody filled one of the tiny cups with water instead of rice wine, and with a sweeping gesture handed it to his neighbor, a Chinese. Military people don’t drink sake, he said. \"Please drink water instead. According to the bushido spirit of Japan, drinking water means that the soldier won’t return alive.\"\n\nAll the Japanese nodded approvingly and in silence watched the little ceremony that followed. Two of the guests took a sip, but the last one to hold the cup, a solemn young man named Chiang Kai-shek, swallowed all the water that was left.\n\nGentlemen, thank you for the honor you have done me, he said.\n\nAnd as he drank his face was red with emotion, said General Nakaoka, trying valiantly in 1928 to recall whatever he could of the long-forgotten incident. Whoever dreamed that the student of those days would ever be chairman of the Chinese Government? None of us thought that Mr. Chiang was going to be a historic personality.\n\nStill less, he might have said, did anybody in the regiment think that some day the Japanese, above all people, would have violent reactions to Chiang’s name. In 1911 he was one of the most obscure Chinese students that had ever been sent over to finish his military training in Asia’s up-to-date army. Most youths in his category were related to the noble families of China and had got their places through political pull, but Chiang Kai-shek was a nobody.\n\nThe officers were sorry later on that they had neglected to notice him. By the time Nakaoka gave his newspaper interview the Japanese had developed a keen interest in that all but forgotten young man, and were even proud of him. In 1928 he was famous as the Chinese leader who had suddenly broken with Russia and taken the new Republic out of Communist clutches. Still, there it was; nobody among the Japanese in his old regiment remembered him except in a vague way, in that scrap of the general’s reminiscence. Only a sergeant, a man named Shimoda, could add more to the picture.\n\nThe only thing remarkable in him, said Shimoda, was the impressive and forbidding expression which would instantly come upon his face when he was ordered to clean the stables.\n\nThe twenty-four-year-old Chiang sailed to Shanghai in a state of elation that his code of manners made it necessary to conceal. It was against his philosophy of self-control to exhibit emotion, but he had waited a long time for this moment. This, he felt, was it at last; this time the revolution would succeed. He liked the Japanese well enough after all these years of arduous training; he admired their endurance, and he had long since got used to their scanty diet of cold rice garnished with a little fish and pickle. He knew he had been lucky to get the chance of training with the only modern army in the Far East. Most of the boys sent over from home on the government training scheme were naturally pro-Manchu. But Chiang was different. Already, in spirit, he was a seasoned revolutionary. Nor was it only in spirit that he knew his way around that dimly lit world of the fugitive in which his revered leader, Sun Yat-sen, had lived his adventurous life. Already he felt like a veteran. He didn’t look like one—he looked like a boy of sixteen—but it is the feeling that counts.\n\nChiang knew Shanghai well; the foreign settlements, the great walled estates, the hotels, and the drab Chinese city full of pig-tailed workers. It looked normal when he landed, but something was going on behind the humdrum façade of streets and people. Not only China had been rocked by that amateurish little bomb. The world was following developments.\n\nThe French Concession and the International Settlement offered the conspirators who were Chiang’s friends their only safety in all the country. Protected by the flags of Europe, Sun Yat-sen’s followers had for years been holding their meetings and taking up collections for armaments.\n\nAs soon as his ship had docked, the young soldier hurried to the house of his good friend Chen Chi-mei. Whatever was happening, Chen would know the true story. There had been other alarms and they had always turned out to be false or abortive, but this time, Chiang knew, things were better prepared than they had ever been before. There would be popular support in widespread districts. This time, revolution against the Manchus couldn’t be quelled. That was why he had insisted upon coming back to his country instead of staying on in the hope of more training. One couldn’t go on forever just preparing. A keen young soldier must find his place in the sun; he need not forever accept a role in the background, giving way to spoiled scions from the higher social circles of Peking. There had been a lot of that already—too much. Chiang had suffered a long, long time from resentment and a feeling of neglect. He had a passionate and jealous nature.\n\nHe was born in Chikow, a village near the town of Fenghua, in Chekiang. Chekiang is a small province on the Chinese seacoast, south of Shanghai. The land is fertile, and it is counted a wealthy province. Chikow is inland among the hills, where farms are tip-tilted, in a mountain range that runs north and south along China’s edge. We have seen its mountains, or their prototypes, in Chinese paintings; austere, jagged outlines against the sky, softened here and there by floating scraps of mist.\n\nHe could not have been more widely separate from our country if he had been born in 1587 instead of 1887; his people knew almost nothing about America or any other land, though Americans knew a little—not much, but a little—about China. There were stories of the East told in America: there were pictures painted by Chinese, and missionaries’ stories, and there were live Chinese, too, quite a few of them living in California cities or wandering inland to set up shops and laundries. Americans, if they were interested, learned a good deal about China, and her people—the black-haired women who wore trousers, and the men’s long pigtails. But in Chekiang, America was only a vague name.\n\nFrom his birth the baby was never out of hearing distance of rushing water. A brook flowed along the foot of the bluff where his house stood. Like the neighbors, his family farmed bits of ground in the nearby valley, but Kai-shek’s father Chiang Su-an was also a shopkeeper. (As a child, Kai-shek had another name; as he grew older and went to school the name was changed, and later he took yet another. But the unfamiliar syllables are confusing enough without this added elaboration, and we had better ignore it.) Su-an was the local salt merchant. Salt was a government monopoly and Chiang held a license to trade in it; his income was steady if modest. Just how modest it was is difficult for a Westerner to estimate.\n\nWere the Chiangs poor? We might think so. But Chiang Kai-shek in his memoirs speaks of his grandfathers as having been wealthy men. The Chiang grandfather had been a salt merchant like Su-an, and the maternal grandfather, Wang, had moved into Chekiang from Anhwei and become a landowner. After the fall of the Taiping kingdom, says Chiang, \"he felt heartbroken … and traveled to the west of Chekiang … In a few years the rice fields increased and the estate became very rich. For scores of li the property was all his.\"\n\nChiang’s official biographers have been victims of a conflict. They want to prove that their hero has illustrious family connections, if only because it would be discourteous not to say that he has. Yet there was a new fashion, even before the Communist conquest, to emphasize the virtues of the simple life—Lincoln is very well thought of in China. The nearest thing to Lincoln that can be found in their history is the Confucian sage Mencius, and they have worked hard to show parallels between his life and Chiang Kai-shek’s. Mencius had a wise, self-sacrificing mother who brought up her son admirably, in spite of abject poverty, and Chiang’s chroniclers point out the things he can claim in common with the sage—the widowed mother, the poverty … Perhaps they overdid it; he wasn’t as poor as all that.\n\nChiang Kai-shek himself is taciturn about his background. If he hadn’t become a Christian and joined the Southern Methodist Church, the notion of being ashamed of his history might never have entered his head. He did become a Methodist, though, and he is ashamed; and it is possible, as a matter of fact, that anybody in China would have been affected to a certain extent in the twenties by our opinions on morality, no matter what religion he held. It may be irrational of Chiang to criticize his Buddhist family for not living according to Christian ideas of propriety, but in these matters few of us are governed by reason. The particular fact he does not wish to dwell on is that his mother, twenty-two years younger than her husband, was not Su-an’s first wife, the big mistress of the house. She was the little mistress, the second wife—a concubine, we would call it. This worries the Generalissimo.\n\nNo blame attached to Miss Wang for assuming this relationship. There was nothing illicit about a concubine’s status. She had her place in the family, by law and custom, and her children enjoyed equal rights with those of the first wife. She was considered as good a woman as any in the community: the rank of concubine did not connote immorality. Before Chiang was converted he must have accepted the general Chinese opinion on such matters: indeed, no other attitude could possibly have occurred to him. It is different now.\n\nIn an attempt to compensate for this fact, which he considers a blemish, the log-cabin fanciers talk a good deal about his mother’s virtues, and Chiang’s memoirs are enthusiastic on this subject. Alas! he wrote, my mother endured thirty-six years of hardship. She swallowed much bitterness and never refused any kind of toil, all for her unfilial son, who, she hoped, would establish himself. But I was unworthy.… Not only have I been unable to achieve deeds of virtue or do work of importance so as to fulfill my mother’s ambition for me, but I have also failed utterly in the filial duty of a son to look after his mother’s health constantly and in making her happy even for a single day. On the contrary she had been allowed to drag on with some kind of a serious illness for over ten years.… This was written in 1921, when her son was thirty-four years old and had done quite a lot of important work. It is the way polite Chinese talk: it is not to be taken literally.\n\nOther narrators are not so modest on his behalf or hers. One story current among his underlings is that Mrs. Chiang, in order to support her fatherless children—Chiang Su-an died when the boy was eight—went out to work as a housemaid. It is not true. She belonged to a large clan, and Chinese families look after their own. She found it hard to manage financially, but there were brothers-in-law and cousins and uncles who helped. She worked embroidery and sold it: she did this work among her own people.\n\nSu-an’s first wife had borne two children, and when she died their care was entrusted to Kai-shek’s mother. She herself had four children: Kai-shek was the eldest and he had a brother and two sisters. The boy and one of the girls died in infancy, so Kai-shek did grow up, like Mencius, the only son of his widowed mother. Mencius or no Mencius, however, we must not think of him as dwelling in a miserable hovel, in lonely poverty. The Chiangs could afford to indulge in a certain amount of ambition. It was taken for granted, for example, that the boy be educated. He was too bright and lively to be wasted.\n\nThe spirit of the West was slowly percolating through the country. Politically, everything seemed stagnant, but politics are never static. The Manchu Dynasty was in the saddle again after years of Taiping rule in the South, but Manchu energy had been ebbing for generations, and would have died out naturally if outside influences hadn’t kept it going.\n\nThe powers of the West supported the Manchus because they profited by the arrangement, and so a rotten government was aided to hang on for years beyond its normal span. If the Chinese had not feared the West they would have thrown off the Manchus. As it was they smoldered and watched in impotent hatred while foreign powers grabbed one concession after another from them.\n\nUnable to take out their feelings in direct action, they waited and reminded each other that the Manchus, like the Westerners, were foreigners. In later years when the main cause of irritation was removed, Chiang Kai-shek was to take a more moderate and characteristically Chinese viewpoint, declaring that Manchus and Chinese are of the same race. Even then, Chinese had become accustomed to the same Manchu laws that seemed tyrannical three hundred years before, when the Ching Dynasty first promulgated them. There was the queue, for example. When the Court issued the original order that all Chinese men must wear their hair in this fashion, there had been weeping and wailing, yet in the 1880s queues were the convention, and were even cherished. But other grievances were not so trivial: the Manchus were detested and blamed for every misfortune. Taxation was oppressive, corruption was extreme even for people accustomed to venality, and the government was blamed when crops were disappointing, for heaven rewards a country or punishes it according to the virtue or wickedness of its emperor.\n\nThe ordinary man had always been content to accept the comfortable fact that he was Chinese and therefore the salt of the earth. Now he was beginning to question this axiom.\n\nEvery military convulsion seemed to bring another European country into the picture, ostensibly to watch her nationals’ interests or to protect China from herself, and the result was always the same: more and yet more foreigners arrived and made claims. From their point of view these incursions were justified. It was the nineteenth-century faith in Europe that trade should be spread throughout the rest of the world, even when it meant forcing Western-made articles upon Orientals who didn’t realize what was good for them. But the Chinese didn’t agree. They were still smarting from the indignity of the Opium War and its outcome—the establishment of treaty ports, and British management of their Customs. It was cold comfort to be told by bossy British officials, in schoolmistressy accents, that the Chinese Customs Department was the only one in their government free of corruption. Pigheaded people that they were, they actually preferred homemade Chinese corruption to foreign purity.\n\nAfter an incident in which a British consul was killed in the interior, the British had insisted that the reluctant Manchu Court permit foreigners to travel anywhere in the Empire under protection of the authorities, in 1875. Barely a year after this humiliation, Russia legalized her occupation of the Ili Valley to the north. In 1882 there was more foreign trouble, this time in Korea. China claimed Korea as a tributary, but the relationship was a loose one. No objections came from Peking when Korea signed a commercial treaty with Japan. But then the King of Korea quarreled with his new friends and Japan moved in troops. Then the Manchus sat up and took notice, and nearly became involved in all-out war with the Japanese. They managed to steer clear of it; an agreement was signed in 1885; the armies of both countries were evacuated from Korea, but the peninsula was to remain a sore point.\n\nEighteen eighty-seven, the year of Kai-shek’s birth, was marked by another flurry over the same country, this time between Great Britain and Russia, both of whom attempted to occupy Port Arthur. The two nations finally withdrew their troops and promised each other to leave Korea alone. China, the nominal sovereign state, was completely ignored in the exchange.\n\nWith all this, the most effective infiltration of the West was neither military nor commercial, but religious. There are qualities in the Chinese character that work both for and against missionaries. Most Chinese are not mystic. They are attracted by philosophy rather than the religious spirit, and are not prone to sudden exaltation or emotional conversions. On the other hand, they are not averse to new religions; they are interested and tolerant. The Catholics who came into China in the sixteenth century had found themselves befriended and hearkened to but did not succeed in convincing many of their hearers that the old ways of filial piety and Confucianism or Buddhism were not best. And even the early toleration of Christianity disappeared after Emperor K’ang-hsi expelled the missionaries. It took courage and wit for a Chinese to cling to Catholicism after that, though there were some who did.\n\nThe Protestants entered at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and they persisted in spreading the gospel, often at considerable risk, through the troubled years that followed. As treaty after treaty was forced upon China by the Western powers, the missionaries marched farther and farther into the country with their compatriots, the traders. They found more hostility than friendship.\n\nYet the Christians from the West played an important part in reconciling East and West points of view. Missionaries spent much more time in the country, as a rule, than did the foreign government officials, and when people live in one place for a long time, especially if they behave circumspectly and with good will, friendship with the neighbors is bound to develop. Many of them took eagerly to the ways of the educated Chinese and became Sinologues, a sure way of winning the respect of the locals. Through mission money, schools were built. Missionaries brought in Western books and medicines. Their influence cannot be overrated. They played an essential part in the education of Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries. Even Chiang, though he didn’t join the Church until middle age, felt their presence long before his conversion.\n\nMeanwhile the Manchu Court at Peking, walled off from the vast country it professed to govern, carried on in medieval splendor in complex conditions. The Emperor, Kuang Hsu, was only a boy, and his claim to the throne was shaky, but he had been placed there by the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, who was Regent, and no one attempted to question it. Tzu Hsi had everything under control. She was a redoubtable character with great tenacity and a greedy ambition. Also, she possessed all the prejudices of her class. In this respect Manchus and Chinese were alike: they hated Western innovations.\n\nThere were no state schools for young children. Education was the responsibility of the villages or of private persons, but since in China there has always been a tradition of respect for learning, most communities managed somehow to provide a teacher for their young. Chinese have always honored scholars above all other men, paying their learned gentlemen every courtesy except that of a living wage. This remark is not as cynical as it sounds, for honor means much in China and not only the scholars, but most other people, were poor. If a man’s son showed a talent for books he was not pushed into a more profitable occupation. His father would make great sacrifices to obtain an education for him.\n\nAs Americans we applaud the sentiment, but our teachers would look with horror on the school system that was the result of it. At the age of four little Kai-shek had fearsome tasks to accomplish. He was expected to start off with Confucius.\n\nThe first little book which the scholar has put into his hands, wrote Arthur Smith, a missionary contemporary in China, is probably the ‘Trimetrical Classic,’ so called from its arrangement in double lines of three characters above and three below, to a total number of more than 1,000. Reasonably well-educated people aspire to the knowledge of two or three thousand characters, but a truly learned man knows at least six thousand. … The very opening sentence of this initial textbook in Chinese education contains one of the most disputed doctrines in the ancient heathen world: ‘Men at their birth, are by nature radically good; in their natures they approximate, but in practice differ widely.’\n\nTry that out on your own four-year-old.\n\nOf course a child that age wasn’t expected to take in the philosophical connotations of the text. The system was aimed solely at developing the memory, a most important function when you consider the complications of Chinese writing. Nevertheless there was a secondary hope that the boy, babbling such pious precepts in singsong, would ultimately imbibe their meaning by a process of osmosis. And so he did. At least, Chiang has not forgotten his first textbook maxims: he is never at a loss for some historical example or improving proverb with which to illustrate his oratory, and for this he is much admired in China. (Though he bores people, too.)\n\nHis lessons must have been unutterably wearisome. Children were expected to begin their studying before breakfast and carry on until the end of daylight, and Kai-shek was not considered too young for this routine. For two years he concentrated on reading Confucius’s Great Learning and The Golden Mean.\n\nThese two works … are in classical style, says S. I. Hsiung. Rarely could a boy in his early teens really understand their meaning. (Chiang Kai-shek had to tackle them at five.) … they are the first two volumes of the Four Books of the Confucian Classics, which are invariably imposed upon any youthful beginner who is intended for a scholastic career.\n\nThe Chiang child finished memorizing his first two classics by the age of seven. He was now attending school in the village, a place which was not luxurious. It took little preparation to open a Chinese classroom; any empty room in a temple or an unused house would do, and the scholar provided his own table and stool. Discipline was severe and from our viewpoint unconstructive. It was assumed that a scholar who didn’t know his lesson was being deliberately naughty, and a forgetful boy was roundly beaten. Every day the pupil would be given a line of characters to learn in his book. The teacher ran through them with him once or twice so that he might hear the right pronunciation, and from then on for the rest of the day the child was left to study, shouting aloud at the top of his voice, committing the sounds to memory. When he was word-perfect and could chatter the line, parrot-like, at top speed, he was given another selection.\n\nWe are in no position to patronize; our own system at that time was not much better. Our schools too favored the committing to memory of catalogues, lists of kings and battle dates. But in self-defense we can at least lay claim to an alphabet of only twenty-six letters, which is not much tax on the memory. Chinese students had to remember vast numbers of ideographs, and from this exercise they developed extraordinarily retentive visual memories which served them well in examinations, but let them down when they had to show initiative. Even today, Chinese are slow in developing their talent for independent reasoning: it becomes almost ossified during their youth.\n\nThe adult Chiang Kai-shek is austere: he has much respect for discipline, and no wonder. It took a long time to instill that respect, however. Nature kept breaking in: the boy was often boisterous.\n\n2 IDEALS AND REVOLUTION 1905–12\n\nChiang got into trouble with the authorities when he was about eighteen. He was no gangster: he had the most exemplary reasons. All boys with any gumption, he might well have protested, got into trouble with the authorities sooner or later, especially when they were southerners like himself. Take it all in all he was a pretty solid citizen by that time, and a married man to boot. His mother had found a suitable girl in the village, a Miss Mao, and married him off when he was fourteen. As was customary in his country, the marriage made little difference in his life. He had changed schools some time before and was now living with his mother’s family in nearby Fenghua, helping out in the shop when he wasn’t studying. Miss Mao remained in Chikow in the Chiang house.\n\nChiang was a grave youth according to all accounts, and a photograph taken in 1905 bears this out: he looks repressed and humorless. Of course, sitting for a photograph in those days was no joke, but we know that he really worked at being grave and inscrutable. He would stand with his eyes closed and his mouth tightly shut, says Chiang Hsing-hai, for a quarter of an hour or more as if he were going through some exercise to strengthen his will power. That is exactly what he was doing, as a matter of fact; his diary confesses it. He had, and still has, several heroes in history; chief among them is Chu-ko Liang, nicknamed Wo Lung, or Sleeping Dragon. Wo Lung was a great military strategist and sage of the Three Kingdoms, who lived in the third century A.D. It was said of him that he was so free of wrinkles that his face was like a piece of white jade. No Confucian gentleman gives rein to his emotions; emotions are what wrinkle the face.\n\nHollington Tong, whose life has since been mingled with Chiang’s to an intense degree, knew him then as a student; Tong was English teacher in the Fenghua school. A certain aloofness—that has since been mistaken for pride—manifested itself, he says. Although he was ready to join any game in which physical fitness was a requisite—he ran third in a race at the first international school athletic meeting in Ningpo—he was averse to spending his time in empty talk. Often, while others were engaging themselves in the ‘tremendous trifles’ that preoccupy schoolboys, he wandered away by himself and was evidently ruminating deeply.\n\nChiang had gone to Hangchow to investigate the possibilities of continuing his education in a law school there. That was his mother’s idea: his own tastes were already formed: he preferred military science. Hangchow, the capital city of Chekiang Province, is one of China’s famous beauty spots. The lake has been landscaped; a charming series of zigzag pathways on piles, like bridges going nowhere, lead out over the water to pavilions. Ornamental flat-bottomed pleasure boats drift about, and gentle hills fade away in the distance across the lake, giving an illusion of size and space. There are famous Hangchow dishes of fresh-water fish and shrimps; there are innumerable walks and pine-forested temples and tombs of heroes. It seems that Chiang was sitting in one of the lakeside restaurants eating his lunch and bothering nobody when the waiter asked him to move to another place. The table he had, explained the waiter, was the best in the place and was wanted by a couple of important officials.\n\nChiang took umbrage. He had—perhaps—drunk a little wine; in any case he was easily inflamed by any show of authority on the part of Manchu-appointed officials. He refused to give up his table. He made a scene. The outcome of the story is rather vague; some people say that the police followed him back to his lodgings and kept an eye on him after that, but this is doubtful. If it were true he would probably never have got into a government military academy as he later did. However, the incident became famous in a small way, and it led him to acquaintanceship with older men who were genuine revolutionaries.\n\nIt would have been strange if he hadn’t been implicated in some conspiracy. He was an impressionable boy when the Japanese trounced China’s forces and chased them out of Korea, when the Manchu Court had to sue for peace and sign the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki. Chiang heard furious talk about this in the teahouses of Fenghua. He was thirteen at the time of the Boxer rising, and there was more humiliation for China in that. By the time he had grown up he was spoiling for great deeds to do and his mind was full of the heroes of old he had read about at school and seen on the stage, who had freed their country from tyrants. When he wasn’t seeing himself as the smooth-faced Wo Lung, he dwelt lovingly on the story of Yo Fei.\n\nYo Fei was a twelfth-century general of the Sung Dynasty, who at the age of twenty-five, when China was overrun with barbarians from the north, delivered Hangchow from bondage and chased the enemy back to Shantung. He would have pushed them beyond, into Manchuria, if plotters at Court had not falsely accused him of treason and brought him to account. There was a splendidly dramatic moment during the trial when Yo Fei snatched off his clothes to exhibit his back, on which his mother, presumably in nursery days, had branded the words, Be loyal to your country. But he was dishonored in spite of this proof, and died in prison. The statues of the wicked Minister Chin Kuei and his wife, who conspired against the hero, stand near his tomb in Hangchow, where people still spit on them in passing. The story of Yo Fei was heady stuff for Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nAnd a modern hero was not wanting, for there was also Sun Yat-sen. Sun was a Cantonese doctor, a southerner like Chiang, poor too—even poorer than Chiang—and a born rebel. He was twenty-one years older than the Chekiang boy. Emigrating to Hawaii as a child to live there with an older brother, he had been converted to Christianity and promptly sent home by his scandalized relatives. Back in Choyhung he was so faithful to his new religion that, though a gentle man ordinarily, he deliberately damaged the idols of the village temple, and had to be shifted out of town again, this time to Hongkong.\n\nBritish Protestant missionaries helped him attend the Hongkong College of Medicine, where he took his degree. Joining the political struggle was inevitable for a man of Sun’s temperament. He soon founded a secret society, with branches abroad, aimed at collecting funds to promote reform for the people of China. As its representative he traveled about furthering the cause. He brought about revolutions, many of them, and all but one abortive. The first failure sent him into exile, and at that time he made a gesture familiar among people of his persuasion: he cut off his queue. (Among the purchases made and smuggled into China for the revolt—gunpowder and rifles for the most part—was a most hopeful item; a pair of scissors intended for everybody’s queue. The scissors, and the Day of Jubilo, had to wait.)\n\nThe most exciting part of Sun’s early history, the incident that made him internationally famous, was his kidnaping by Manchu agents in London in 1896. Thanks to his missionary friend Cantlie and the British Foreign Office he was extricated. After that his name was an inspiration to China’s discontented youth, and he continued to be a romantic figure, coming and going in disguise, running the gauntlet of Manchu guards at the seaport.\n\nThere were other excitements in the North: the Hundred Days’ Reform of 1898 when a scholar named K’ang Yu-wei almost managed to instigate a peaceful change-over to more enlightened government and saw his Emperor disempowered for his pains; then the Boxer rising and its aftermath. All this was a long way from the Fenghua school and the solemn, eager young man who was interested only in military subjects, but he knew every bit of news about local revolts that ever drifted down to Chekiang. He had his sources.\n\nThe Hangchow project had not worked out, but Mrs. Chiang, after scraping and saving and coaxing her brothers and in-laws for enough money to send her son somewhere for a higher education, did not intend to drop her ambition for him. For some time before the final decision they wrangled, if wrangled is the word for Chiang’s respectful discussions with his mother, as to what he should do with that money instead of training himself as a lawyer. He wanted to be a soldier. Mrs. Chiang opposed the idea strongly because in China soldiers were thought to be low morally, intellectually, and socially. Chiang wanted to be like Yo Fei, the gallant martyr, delivering his country from tyrants, but his mother saw him, if such a catastrophe as a military career should actually overtake her darling son, as a down-at-heel hangdog mercenary, a bogey of country children, a second-string bandit, a permanent landless wanderer. Nevertheless he had his way. Circumstances helped. While he was still smoldering with rebellious fervor after the Hangchow restaurant scene he had a run-in with the local authorities about something that was not his fault at all. A neighbor failed to pay his taxes, the taxgatherer held the whole village responsible, and Chiang Kai-shek was summoned to court arbitrarily, to be rated and disgraced. He came home in a fury against Manchu injustice and packed his bag and marched out. As a final sign of defiance, he cut off his queue, like Sun Yat-sen.\n\nJapan was his destination; in Tokyo there was a famous military academy, the magnet for all Chinese would-be generals. Japan’s stock in the Eastern world even more than in the Western had been soaring high ever since her defeat of Russia. Every Asian felt vicariously proud of the islanders, and the fame of their newfangled methods in naval and military technique had spread a long way through the countries on the mainland. Yuan Shih-kai, Generalissimo of the Imperial forces of China, had made an arrangement by which a number of his young hopefuls crossed the waters every year to enter the Tokyo academy and take lessons from these masters.\n\nToo, Japan was the place where every up-and-coming"
