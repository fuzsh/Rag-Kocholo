The annual diocesan eucharistic procession organised on the feast of Christ the King at Milagres Cathedral evoked good response from nearly four thousand Catholics representing 51 parishes of the Udupi Catholic Diocese on Sunday.

According to a release, Most Rev. Dr. Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese, along with the priests concelebrated the solemn eucharistic mass in the presence of a large number of people.

During the homily, the bishop highlighted the importance of the eucharist and its evolution by citing a number of examples and events from both old and new testaments. The mass was followed by adoration of the holy eucharist.

Soon after the adoration, the solemn eucharistic procession began.

The brass band led the procession followed by the cross and candle bearers and the people holding lighted candles. The bishop held the blessed sacrament that was rested on a pedestal fitted on a decorated vehicle.

The procession moved through the Milagres Cathedral through ozanum house and entered the Mount Rosary Church Santhekatte premises.

Rev. Fr. Stany B. Lobo, Rector of Milagres Cathedral, expressed gratitude to all those who had helped in organising the annual diocesan eucharistic procession.
