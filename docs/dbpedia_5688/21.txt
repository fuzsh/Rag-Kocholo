The new building of Sacred Heart Church will be inaugurated at Yermal-Uchila in Udupi district on May 14. Bishop of Udupi Catholic Diocese Most Rev. Dr. Gerald Isaac Lobo will inaugurate it and also celebrate the Holy Eucharist.

According to a press release here on Saturday, Yermal was originally under the jurisdiction of Shirva for nearly 40 years.

From 1939 onwards, the parish priest of Shirva Church used to celebrate Mass at a house.

Later, six devotees donated 3.66 acres of land on which a chapel was built and it was inaugurated on April 25, 1961. When Kalathur attained the status of a parish on June 7, 1971, Yermal came under its jurisdiction and was served from Kalathur.

On May 25, 1993, Yermal became an independent parish and Fr. Peter Nazareth became the first parish priest. Fr. Henry Castelino and Fr. Vishal Lobo also served the community as parish priests.

Fr. Lawrence Rodrigues has been serving as parish priest since 2009.

There are 65 families in the parish with a total of 250 parishioners.

The rear portion of the building was withering and accommodating the huge congregation during Mass was a problem.

Hence, a new building was planned by the parish council.

Fr. Rodrigues took up this project and with the help of parishioners, donors and well-wishers, completed it.

The inauguration function on May 14 would be followed by felicitation function.

Vinay Kumar Sorake, Urban Development Minister, Lalaji Mendon, former MLA, Abdul Hakim Musliyar of Sayyed Arabi Masjid, Uchila, and other dignitaries would participate in the felicitation function.
