        "text": "Rt Rev Dr Basil S D’Souza, Bishop of Mangalore was celebrating Holy Eucharist at Bishop’s Chapel, Kodialbail at 5.30 a.m along with his Vicar General Very Rev Msgr A. F. D’Souza and Fr Robert Miranda, Bro. Rony and Bro. Francis whom he had prepared for a mission. While he invoked God’s Blessing on the new mission, the Lord strengthened them all with His own self-gift, the Eucharist those on mission were very well encouraged by the assurance of the Bishop would accompany them to Bidar. With much love and foresight he had personally arranged for all the basic needs of the mission which included some warm clothing, kitchen vessels, mats, etc. It was raining cats and dogs. Driver Jossy was ready with the car. Taking a light breakfast after the Mass, the Bishop, the Vicar General, and the young missionaries boarded the car. The mission left the Bishop’s House, Mangalore at 6.45 a.m. sharp and moved fast northwards to Bidar. A new epoch in the history of the diocese of Mangalore had dawned.\n\n17th June, 1982.\n\nAfter a long journey of over a thousand k.m. by road, the missionaries entered the frontiers of Bidar at around 5.00 p.m. interestingly a drizzle from the heavens welcomed the missionaries. A welcome sign indeed! A Shower of Blessings from above! The missionaries along with the Bishop alighted at the inspection Bungalow near the Ambedkar Chowk in Bidar city, and a few of Catholics welcomed them warmly. A little later, the Archbishop of Hyderabad – Most Rev Arulappa arrived there along with Fr Marianna and Fr Rayappa. In the informal meeting that followed, Rt Rev Dr Basil S D’Souza, the Bishop of Mangalore, accepted Bidar district for Evangelization from the hands of Most Rev S Arulappa, the Archbishop of Hyderabad to whom the district belonged juridically. “Pray to St Joseph. He will do everything for you” said the Archbishop to Bishop Basil smilingly and in good faith. Trusting in the powerful intercession of St Joseph, Bishop Basil did not have a second thought. He simply agreed and accepted the mission taking St Joseph as the patron of the new mission – THE BIDAR MISSION,\n\nEven though a good room was arranged for the overnight’s stay, at the IB itself Bishop Basil preferred to stay with the young missionaries in a little room on the outskirts of the city. ( near Fateh Darwaza). Mr Prem Kumar of Shoba Nivas, a Methodist Christian, had offered a room for the stay of catholic missionaries. Ex Flt Lt Samuel SS, a Mangolorean by birth who stayed nearby, offered them food. The Bishop stayed in this little room with the driver and the missionaries for the next three days. This single room served all purposes – of prayer, rest, recreation and cooking. all in one! The Bishop slept on a simple mat on the floor, sat on the floor to pray, also to eat and to chat. The young missionaries, who stayed in this room for the next 4 months, would recall later the days they stayed in this room and were the happiest days in the mission life.\n\n18th June, 1982.\n\nAround 4.00 p.m., the little flock of Catholic believers, around 40 in number, had assembled in a primary school class room belonging to the Railways. Among them were Naden, M.D Shah, Samuell SS, M.V Augustine, Stopno, Leon Charles and thier family members. There were also a few Air Force employees. They had prepared themselves joyously for the celebration of the Eucharist that day, as it would be a historic day in the history of the Catholic Church at Bidar. Even though a small community, they were very happy and excited that the Catholic Church at last had come! On this blessed day, a Sunday and the Feast day of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Rt Rev Dr. Basil S D’Souza, Bishop of Mangalore, celebrating the Holy Eucharist along with the guest priests declared the catholic mission formally opened. BIDAR MISSION WAS BORN’\n\nTwo days after the Inauguration, the Bishop took us by car to Hyderabad to show us the Archbishop’s House. After introducing us to the place and people over there, he had to leave us and proceed to Mangalore. He reached us to the APSRTC Bus stand at Afzalgunj. We were touched as we saw tears rolling down from’ the eyes of Bishop Basil and driver Jossi as they said, “Good bye” and “God Bless You”. And they left us, we came back to Bidar.\n\nEarly Days :\n\n“Faith is a leap in the dark” said Kierkegaard. It was a leap, yes! but a leap with firm faith in the Lord who said, “Behold, I am with you always”. He’ never failed. Our Faith and Hope, Prayers and words of encouragement from our near and dear ones sustained us in those difficult days of our mission life. As we were entirely new to this place, our first task was to know Bidar – the people, society, religious belief and practices andculture, geography, socio economic situation and weather. Wasting no time, we moved out of our little room which we named as ‘Joseph Nilaya’ and make acquaintance with people. We had purchased a bicycle for us for our travel. Brothers were so good and concerned about me and my broken leg that they often took me on their cycle and did not allow me to cycle. When we were cycling, often the wind against us, we remembered the Apostles who were asked by Jesus to take a boat and go ahead and reach on other side of the lake (Mk 6:45). His presence was felt in many ways. As we started off on our quest, we were greeted by many people who greeted and said ‘Jai Christ’ to us. Soon we learnt, Christianity is not new in Bidar. The Good News was first proclaimed to the people of Bidar a hundred years before (1890), by the Methodist Missionaries. The ‘Madiga’ group of people ( a scheduled cast) had accepted the Good News in great numbers. The District Superintendent of the Methodist Church at Bidar and Assistant Pastors, Mesrs. Gyani, Nehemia, Contractor Rajappa, SR Pandit, David Narasappa,a Dr Mrs Sunderraju, Solomon DPPI, George BEO, were some of the people who helped us in the early days. Dr Mrs Sunderraju often received us in her house and treated us as her own sons. With their help we moved to a rented house in the city where the faithful could conveniently assemble for the Sunday Eucharistic celebration. Sufficient land was purchased for the mission on the outskirts of the city at the village Haldkeri in bidar, Hydarbad Road.\n\nBidar, we had learnt in schools, is the most backward district of Karnataka. To stay here, live with these people and know them was a unique and precious life experience. The villages consisted of a cluster of houses in one place and apart from other such villages by several miles with no habitation in between. The Society sharply divided on the caste basis; People of the same caste live together but away from the other caste even within a small village. While the high caste people, who were also land owners, occupied the central place in the village, the low caste people had to live on the outskirts or even outside the village. The low castes the poorest are often oppressed by the landlords. Their wages were less than Rs 10 for women and Rs 15 – 20 for men folk. Their low earnings even during work seasons or no earnings at all in timeof draught always put them at the mercy of the landlords who squeezed life out of them. Many lived as bonded labourers for generations. Besides this, they had to bear the brunt of the caste system. They were considered ‘untouchables’. They could not enter their landlord’s compound or draw water from the community well.\n\nPoverty at home didnot allow them to send their children to school. Poor educational facility coupled with corruption in every Government Department including Education made the situation deplorable everywhere. As we completed our study of Bidar by the year end, the need of good education being the prime need of the place and a solution to many ailments of this society, we applied for a Kannada Medium School at bidar. We also managed to register the Catholic Diocesan Society at Bidar under which all our future works would run. Both these were accomplished after a patient and persevering struggle with the government officials who would normally not do a thing without money moved into their hands under the table.\n\nAnother important task given to us by the Bishop was to find out the most responsive area to start the evangelization work. As we went round the district, we found among the 5 Talukas of Bidar district, Methodist Church was sufficiently well organized in Bidar Taluka. They had contributed much to Bidar in educational and health fields. All other denominations, such as, the Seventh Day Adventists, New Apostolic Church, Hebron Church, Pentecostal Church – were in Bidar already before us spreading Good News to people in their own ways. Often these Church pastors were found wrongly motivated. They cared more for monetary gains than the faith of the people and did nothing to improve the living conditions of the poor. They induced people to join them by the offering ‘Paeti (Harmonium), Tabala and Gudi. offer of a Harmonium, Tabala as music accompaniments for Bhajans\n\nBhajans a the popular form of devotional songs among to new christians. As new denominations were coming into the villages, and each one working in a competitive spirit rather than ecumenic, people responding to the Word of God, were demoralized. In the absence of committed spiritual leadership from any of the denominations, they were, like sheep without a shepherd. The situation was no better than what we read in Ezk 34:3-6. Many were eager to listen to the Word, but not one to proclaim. ‘The harvest was rich indeed, but the labourers were few. It was in this situation, the catholic Church entered into Bidar\n\nCatholic Church in Bidar :\n\nThe consecrated life of the Catholic priests and nuns, celibacy, prayer, austere life, simplicity and commitment to God’s work impressed the people of Bidar very much. They had never seen such way of life before. Even the Lingayats and people of other religions were impressed by us and they treated us with love, respect and reverence. None of the Christian denominations except the Methodist Church seemed to have made any impact on people. Under these circumstances we chose Bhalki as the suitable place for starting evangelization work. After several visits, we managed to take a room on rent at Bhalki town in the house of Mr Gurunath Swamy, a Lingayat.\n\nA new batch of Missionaries arrived with the Bishop in June 1983, in the person of Fr Benjamin, Bros. Louis D’Sa and Peter D’Souza. Bhalki Mission was inaugurated on 7th June, 1983, and was dedicated to Christ the Holy Redeemer. Their residence was ‘called ‘ Yesu Nilaya’. Rev Srs. Concetta, Bertille and Maria, Anita, the Apostolic Carmel sisters also, landed in Bidar to serve the people at St Joseph’s Convent School, which was inaugurated on 6th June, 1983. We named their convent Maria Nilaya. They were the first sisters to come and work in this mission. Phenomenal growth of the mission took place then onwards. Even though it is worthwhile recording the growth of every mission centre and apostolate, it is not possible to record it here. It would be no doubt very informative and interesting for readers and those working in this mission to know how the early missionaries started the work of preaching the Word of God.\n\nFr Benjamin with great enthusiasm went all around, the length and breadth of Bidar, walking, cycling, by truck or bus making acquaintance with people and place. Fast he established contacts with prominent Christian and other leaders. He became popular among the poor in no time as people saw in him a man of God, a man for others. During those days, the New Apostolic Church that had already spread into Bhalki villages, was not functioning well. Both people and the local leaders of this Church were disheartened and disappointed. Touched by the life of priests and sisters in the Catholic Church, N.R Luke, a ‘shepherd’ in rank of the New Apostolic Church, took initiative and met Fr Benjamin with his associates. Fr. Benjamine instructed these enthusiastic men about Catholic Church, its origin and history. Having heard about it, they recognised the Catholic Church as the Mother of all the Churches and called it ‘Tayi Sabhe’. They were now ready to come over to the Catholic Church. Accepting their genuineness Fr Benjamin sent them to Mangalore for an intense formation course at Mangala Jyothi (DBCL). This course was taken up by Fr Mark Veigas who took all pains to instruct them about the Catholic faith and practices. Having completed their course, the Bishop Basil baptized them in the Catholic Church at Kodiyalbail Chapel in Mangalore in May 1984. These the first fruits of the Mission were named Luke, John, Mark and Mathew. It is through the contacts made by these men and a few who later joined, more people in and more villages were contacted as years passed.\n\nBut then, we were all young inexperienced people working in this field. Things were not clear in our minds concerning the approach we needed to take in this mission. But our Bishop had clear thoughts in his mind on what we were here for. Therefore by his unfailing visits at least twice a year, he guided the team members continuously unto his last moments of life. He loved to visit people in villages, preach the Word of God, and spend time with people. With concern for their social and economic welfare, as the communities were strengthened in faith, he helped us start development activities in Bidar. ORBIT (Organisation for Bidar Integral Transformation) started in1983 as a sister concern of- CODP, Mangalore, began working in full swing for empowering the marginalised sections of the society. It was the initial plan of the Bishop Basil to start at least one mission centre in all Talukas in five years. We accepted that it was neither possible nor necessary for us to go on with such a speed. However, this dream of his, of reaching out to all Talukas of Bidar was accomplished when ‘Kristashrama’ the centre at Kaudiyal, Basava Kalyan was blessed on 3-12-1996 a few months after his death.\n\nBidar center institution\n\n1. SACRED HEART CHAPEL :\n\nBIDAR CHAPLAIN: Fr. Clevan Gomes\n\nThe history of Bidar Mssion began with mission activities in Bidar Taluk itself. The mission was formally inaugurated on the Feast Day of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on 17th June 1982, in the presence of a small congregation gathered in a school class room, near Bidar Railway Station. As the need was felt for a place of worship, a small Church built and dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was inaugurated by Rt. Rev. Dr. Basil S. D’Souza on 12th February 1985. Frs. Robert Miranda, Baptist Menezes, Mathias Pereira and Jerome D’Souza, Fr. Ivan Michael, Fr Stany Pereira, Fr. Fredrick D’souza, Fr. Praveen Martis, Ferdinand Gonsalves Fr. Stany Lobo Fr. Leo veigas, Fr. Pradeep Mangalgi OFM, Fr. Wilson Fernandes have rendered their services in this Church. Fr. Clevan Gomes is its present chaplain.\n\nThe Catholics residing under the jurisdiction of this church is not steady due to the transfer of government officials. Presently, the number of Catholics is increasing with migrant youth studying in different colleges. There were 140 Catholics only with five permanent families.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Chapel has not restricted its activities to Catholics alone. but reaches out to people of all denominations in a spirit of love and service. A branch of the All India Christian Forum was inaugurated in the chapel on 6th August, 1995. In 1996. when the road leading to the Sacred Heart Chapel and the adjacent colony was blocked by vested interests, the people of the colony came together irrespective of caste and creed, and successfully fought against the idgah committe. Several poor people have been helped for housing and self-employment. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the various chaplains, the Chapel has truly become a symbol of Christian faith.\n\nMARIA NILAYA CONVENT: (Apostolic Carmel) :\n\nAll the sisters except invited in the pastoral and school ministry. The sisters, in their usual style., give their selfless service both inside and outside the school. They regularly visit the houses of the students, comfort those who are sick. The convent was started in June 1983. Sisters stayed in Rev Gyanis’s house. Sr. cencetta, Sr. Bertille, Sr. M Anitha were the first nuns to work in Bidar district.\n\nSt Joseph’s Higher Primary School : It was the first educational institution started by the Catholic Church in bidar mission in 1983. Perceiving the need for good education, especially for the poor, the permission for a kannada medium school was obtained and the school was opened on 6th June, 1983. This school, which saw its beginning in a small room at Fatch Darwaza, shifted to the present place in 1984, was upgraded into high school in 1990. Today nearly 900 children, irrespective of caste and creed, study in the primary and midldle school section. The school caters to the poorest children from the surrounding areas of Bidar towm and also from the villages of Bidar district, who stay in boarding. The school is rightly acclaimed as the best Kannada medium School in Bidar district. The school authorities have an uphill task controlling the rush for admissions. The school has set a standard for academics and moral values. It strives to bring up students as loyal and responsible citizens.\n\nJeevan Prakash study Home (for Boys) and Jeevan Jyothi study Home (for girls)\n\nAfter stating the school at Bidar, it was soon realized that the majority of our poor children in the villages (Mission) from various taluks of Bidar district, could not benefit from the school. The Jeevan Jyothi study Home started in 1986 to help to such poor children. In 1995 the study Home was divided into two sections, for Boys and Girls separately. The objective of this Study Home was to educate the poor, deserving and talented children from our villages and form them into nucleus educators who on completion of their studies will go back to their villages, and help to educate their own village people. These Children are trained with a vision of making them the future leaders of their communities, who would bring solace and liberation to the oppressed people. The High School children, during their holidays would conduct regular literacy classes for the government primary school children in these villages and improve their learning. A homely atmosphere is maintained in the Study Homes and study Home are given for their all-round development. The Warden takes special care in achieving the objectives of these Study Homes with a clear action plan. Due to financial constraints, the average strength of the boarding is restricted to 70 every year.\n\nST. JOSEPH’S HIGH SCHOOL, BIDAR\n\nMr. Veerappa Moily, the then Education Minister of Karnataka inaugurated the St. Joseph High School (kannada Medium) in the academic year 1990-91. However, it took a long time of two years to obtain the required permission from the department. Though this school is acclaimed as one of the best Schools in Bidar, it is yet to receive the Grant-in-aid from the Government. Apart from having 100 % result in the year 1995-96, the school had an average result of above 90 per cent during the past 28 years. This is all because of the selfless and dedicated service of Correspondents the Fr. Baptist Menezes and the headmaster Fr. Ferdinand Gonsalves and the team of teachers in the school, who worked hard in the beginning. Every year, over 70 children appear for Drawing, Science and Hindi State-level Examinations and all of them pass with distinctions. The school works hard to stop mal-practices during the examinations by educating the students not to indulge in copying. Various club activities like art, craft, dance, music, needle work, and gardening are organized. The students secure District as well as State-level Honours in various competitions.\n\nMoral Values, devotion to God, respect to the country and elders are given importance in the school. The school is preparing the students to live in harmony with all people in the society irrespective of cast and creed..\n\nMaria Nilaya, Bidar\n\nOn the evening of 4th June 1983, after a long journey of about 20 hours, with night halt at Shimoga, the second batch of missionaries arrived at Bidar, along with Rt. Rev. Basil S. D’Souza the Bishop of Mangalore, Fr. Robert Miranda, the pioneer of the Mission, welcomed them warmly . The members in this new batch of missionaries were: Sr. Concetta AC, Sr. Bertille AC, Sr. Maria Anita AC and four Regents- Brothers Albert D’souza, James D’Souza, Peter D’ Souza, Louis D’sa and Fr. Benjamin D’Souza. For the first time Bidar witnessed the presence of Siters. As a convent building was not ready, the sisters stayed in Mr. Samuel Sequeira’s house for the first two days. Later, they shifted to Rev.Gyanis house.\n\nOn 6th June 1983, at 11.30 a.m. Maria Nilaya, the A.C. Sisters Convent was inaugurated by the Bishop at Fate Darwaza, in a space provided on rent by a kind Methodist Contactor D. Rajappa. A Carmel Home for the Missions was born in Bidar to be Missionaries in this predominantly a non-Catholic place, working for education, family apostolate and to a certain extent through direct evangelization. The Community: Maria Nilaya Convent moved to the present place on 8th Dec 1984. Unfortunately only two small rooms were available to them of the proposed convent building.\n\nV. Rev. Sr Veronica A.C. the then provincial superior took personal interest in the Mission and prepared the team of Sisters to meet the challenges of the Mission. It was Sister Veronica who saw the hand of God in Bishop’s Invitetionto serve in Bidar Mission and do the pioneering work in the field of education.\n\nThe formal inaugural function of St. Joseph’s Convent School took place on 07.06.1983 at 11. 00 a.m. with the DDPI of Bidar presiding over the function. The Bishop of Mangalore blessed the rooms at Fate Darwaza, rented out by the Methodist Contractor D. Rajappa. This modest three room abode served as a residence for the Sisters as well as the class rooms for the students.
