        "text": "History of Eparchy of Bathery\n\nThe Malankara Catholic Eparchy of Bathery, established in 1978 by Pope John Paul II and formally inaugurated on 2 February 1979 has been the fruit of a long term missionary zeal for greater geographical and religious expansion and diversity of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. In 1958, the Holy See extended the jurisdiction of the Eparchy of Tiruvalla further towards the North of Kerala and some districts of Karnataka and Tamilnadu. His Excellency the late Zacharias Mar Athanasios pioneered the Malabar mission which resulted in an unprecedented evangelisation process, accelerating the Reunion Movement which resulted in the mushrooming of parishes and mission centres in the North. Most Rev. Zacharias Mar Athanasios requested the Holy See to bifurcate the Eparchy of Thiruvalla and to erect a new Eparchy with Sulthan Bathery as its headquarters. Pope John Paul II erected the Eparchy of Bathery on 28 October 1978 as a suffragan eparchy of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Archieparchy of Tiruvalla and Rev. Dr. Cyril Malancharuvil was appointed as the first Bishop of Bathery. Most Rev. Dr. Cyril Mar Baselios officially took charge of the Eparchy of Bathery on 2 Ferbruary 1979 and the new Eparchy was inaugurated during the solemn function held at St. Thomas Pro-Cathedral, Sulthan Bathery. The Eparchy of Bathery comprises the district of Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu State; the civil districts of Wayanad, Malapuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasargode of Kerala State . The Ecclesiastical districts of the Eparchy are Bathery, Pulpally, Nilgiris, Nilambur, Edakkara, Kozhikode, Mananthavady, Kannur, Kalpetta and Kasargod.\n\nThe eparchial headquarters is situated in Sulthan Bathery in the district of Wayanad in Kerala. Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thomas was appointed as the third Bishop of the Eparchy of Bathery and enthroned on 13 April 2010 by His Beatitude Moran Mor Baselios Cleemis Catholicos at St.Thomas Cathedral, when his predecessor Most Rev. Dr. Geevarghese Mar Divannasios was given the charge of the newly erected Eparchy of Puttur. Today the Eparchy of Bathery which started its journey of evangelisation with around 8500 Malankara Catholic faithful in 43 parishes and mission stations is the third largest diocese with His Excellency Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thomas, the charismatic and dynamic prelate shepherding the Eparchy with enhanced vigour and vitality. The consecration of the St. Thomas Cathedral, one of the most aesthetically beautiful Cathedrals in India on 20 September 2016 has opened up the portals of the Eparchy of Bathery to pilgrims from across the world. In the words of Dr. Joseph Mar Thomas it was like opening the gates of Christianity to the human community irrespective of colour, caste, creed or religion. As of 2016 there were nearly 30,000 Malankara Catholic faithful in 107 parishes and mission stations in the Eparchy of Bathery.\n\nFrom the date of its inception in 1979, the pastoral care of the community was entrusted to 18 diocesan priests and 2 priests from Bethany Ashram who were zealous and committed in the Apostolate. This has now grown to 86 priests of the diocesan clergy, five priests from Bethany Ashram, Sisters from Bethany Congregation, Daughters of Mary, Deena Sevana Sabha, Holy Spirit Sisters, FMM Sisters, FSM Sisters, John the Baptist Sisters etc render their valuable service in the Eparchy.\n\nAs a result, thousands of families and some priests from prominent families came into full communion of the Catholic Church. Within a short period of time, many parishes and mission stations were established in different parts of the Eparchy.\n\nHis Beatitude Moran Mor Cyril Baselios Catholicos of revered memory, gave great leadership for all the pastoral activities. The far-sighted vision and spiritual leadership of Mar Baselios led the Eparchy to the heights of its growth.\n\nThe Apostolate of the Eparchy is organized under various departments. The faith formation of the children, youth, men and women are guaranteed by the Apostolate of Catechism, Youth Ministry, ‘Pithrusangam’ and ‘Mathrujyothis’. The Bible Apostolate Department takes initiative for the promotion of Bible studies and distribution of Bibles among the faithful. Malankara Catholic Association is the official organ of the Malankara Catholic faithful for its Social involvement and leadership. The Eparchy also gives due importance to its social commitment, taking the life situation of the people it encompasses seriously. The Eparchy has a well chalked out social programme aimed at stimulating the fundamental growth of its children both male and female. The Social Service Centre, named ‘Shreyas’ is the official organ of the Eparchy for promoting Social justice and fellowship. This has been set up with a view to create a more humane and just society, based on scriptural values implemented scientifically through programmes of mass education, mass mobilization and mass action. The Eparchy has also a network of Educational Institutions under the Corporate Educational Agency and Higher Education Board to impart a value based education to the youth irrespective of caste and creed. Pazhassi Raja College is its first higher education Institution. At present the Eparchy has got Gurudev College Kannur, Alphonsa College, Bathery, Fathima College, Moothedam and Baselios College of teacher Education. These Institutions and other educational initiatives act as an excellent network of the educational apostolate of the Eparchy of Bathery.\n\nRt. Rev. Msgr. Mathew Nedungatt, Rt. Rev.

His Eminence Wladislao Cardinal Rubin, the former Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches visited the Eparchy on 9 January 1981 and inaugurated the Pastoral Council and Parish Senate of the Diocese.\n\nThe Eparchy of Bathery was blessed by the visit of His Eminence Simon D.

As a result many parishes and mission stations together with social, charitable and educational institutions were established in the Karnataka region of the Eparchy.\n\nA new Eparchy for the Karnataka region was a long cherished dream of the Malankara Catholic faithful in the region. This dream was fulfilled at the moment of the solemn declaration of the new Eparchy of Puttur on 25 January 2010.
