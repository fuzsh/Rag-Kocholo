        "text": "The Immaculate Conception Church is one of the most loved, revered, spiritual and historical early churches of Mangalore Diocese. It is situated 18 kms from Kundapur city and at present belongs to the Diocese of Udupi.\n\nChurch History\n\nIn the year 1629, Portuguese Commander, Dom Miguel Noronha conquered Gangolli and built a fortress dedicated to St Michael and a church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. But in 1630, it was re-dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. Fr George de Concessao and Fr Francis Cordeiro of the Franciscan Order used to offer mass here. In 1757 the Portuguese had to leave Gangolli and the church was destroyed.\n\nChennammaji, the Queen of Keladi might have donated the place where the present church stands, to build a church. Blessed Joseph Vaz, the Vicar of the Kanara district (1681-1685) lived here and constructed the chapel. Fr Joachim Miranda (1759-1762), a Goan missionary known as Arkula Guru by the Hindus worked here before 1778. He was parish priest at Arkula church presently known as Omzoor. He had opened a Seminary at Monte Mariano. In about 1785 Tipu Sultan demolished the church. Gangolli was one of the five churches coming under Barcelore before 1816, dedicated to Nostra Senhora de Concessao, (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception) a title still retained. The church was rebuilt after the return from captivity.\n\nAfter 1812, Mr Louis D'Silva with the help of Rs 1,000/- (50% of it being aid given by Collector Harris) and the 8,000 stones from the Battery in Gangolli, began the construction of the church. Later with Rs 500/- collected as donation and another Rs 300/- by selling his wife's gold ornaments, he completed the church building. The church had a resident priest until 1845 when it began to be served from Kundapur of which it formed a part. From 1845 to 1902 nothing was heard about Gangolli as a separate parish. It was served from Kundapur. Fr Emmanuel Fernandes was appointed by Bishop Cavadini as the parish priest on March 10, 1902. He built the presbytery. Fr P.V. Gonsalves (1926-1937) constructed the Grotto. He also built a chapel at Padukone. Fr Paul D.G. Rego built the portico to the presbytery. Fr M.S. Menezes built the belfry with the donation from Mr Ignatius Almeida. In 1956, Fr Joseph D'Souza (1956-1962) renovated the church building, except the altar and facade, and also built a chapel at Trasi, which was served from Gangolli.\n\nFr Michael Noronha (1962-1980) built the parish hall. Elizabeth Meier donated a huge bell from Germany and a belfry was built by Fr Thomas D'Sa to house it. Byndoor in 1850, Tallur in 1929, Padukone in 1935 and Trasi in 1971 were carved out of this parish. On May 13, 1996, a shrine in the memory of Bl. Joseph Vaz was erected and it was dedicated by Bishop Basil S. D'Souza. A chapel was erected at Kannada Kudru in 1997. On May 9, 1997 a chapel dedicated to Bl. Joseph Vaz was constructed by Fr Felix Noronha, 22nd parish priest of Gangolli since 1902. The presbytery was completed in 2000.\n\nEducation :\n\nFr Paul D.G. Rego started the Labour School on October 1, 1949. Fr Michael Noronha constructed St Joseph Primary and Stella Maris Girls' High School. Fr Thomas D'Sa constructed the new school building at Kannada Kudru. Fr Felix Noronha did the renovation of the school building in December 2001. A new school building was constructed and computer education was started at the elementary school.\n\nAn innovative pioneer Fr Michael Noronha:\n\nFr. Michael Noronha was appointed as the parish priest in 1962. His tenure of 18 years was a period of great paramount importance in the history of the parish. His farsightedness brought a revolution to this part of Gangolli. He brought Apostolic Carmel sisters to serve in the parish and established a convent for their stay. He started the Holy Cross hospital in Tarsi. As a part of his contribution to the field of education he started Stella Maris Girls’ High School. As an extension of his campaign, he started St.Joseph’s Higher Primary School. Being an ardent follower/devotee of St.Joseph Vaz, he constructed a hall dedicated to St. Joseph Vaz. He renovated the sacristy.\n\nFr. Serrano, Fr.Thomas Desa, Fr.Peter Nazareth, Fr.Albert Menezes, Fr. Felix Noronha, Fr. Anil Cornelio, Fr. Stany Pereira, and Fr. Alphonsus D’lima were the Parish Priests who followed Fr. Michael Noronha & continued the same spirit of versatility. They worked for the development of the people and to strengthen the roots of Christianity in this area.\n\nThe Renovation of the church:\n\nThe longstanding yearning and aspiration of the parishioners started to expedite during the term of Fr. Alphonsus D’lima in 2015. When this topic was discussed with the higher authority, they consented and sent Fr Albert Crasta, a priest of competence to this benevolent mission. Though he was new to parish ministry, he wholeheartedly accepted the dual responsibilities. As he joined the parish, the renovation project got precipitated and all the related tasks started to spurt. On 15 January 2016, the foundation stone was laid to this renovation project by Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese. Many renowned political, social, religious dignitaries and zealous parishioners witnessed the historic event.\n\nWith emphatic donors, ardent parishioners, indulgent parish council and eminent parish priest, the project went on with full swing and got completed within 16 months. The project went on in an incredible way and the parishioners believe it’s another miracle of the Patron, who stood by her devotees these four centuries.\n\nThe beautiful and historic renovated church was inaugurated on 18 May 2017 by Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese. It was an occasion of great celebration and pomp.\n\nSt Joseph Vaz:\n\nSon of Goa, Apostle of Canara and Sri Lanka came to revive the spirits and faith of the widely scattered Roman Catholic community of this region in 1681. He repaired the old church. In his short stay, Vaz acquired a great and saintly reputation. He did yeoman service to the cause of the upliftment of the downtrodden. This greatly helped to keep alive and encourage the religious fervour for Christianity. A shrine dedicated to St. Joseph Vaz in the pristine beauty of Kannadakudru island witnesses the exceptional service of this living icon of God’s mercy and reconciling love.\n\nMiracle of the Patron:\n\nThe church has witnessed a miracle which strengthened the faith of the locals. When the people and the church had faced a cyclone, the people tried to safeguard the statues of the church. But they could not lift the statue of Mother Mary. The next day when the people came to the church they witnessed a miracle where they saw the statue had faced the sea and the cyclone had completely subsided.\n\nSilver Jubilee celebration of St Joseph Vaz Chapel, Kannadakudru :\n\nSt Joseph Vaz Chapel celebrated the silver jubilee of its establishment at Kannadakudru near Gangolli on 05 May 2022.\n\nMost Rev. Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese celebrated the holy Eucharist along with Most Rev. Fr Henry D’Souza, Bishop of Bellary; V. Rev. Fr Stany Tauro, Dean of Kundapur deanery; Rev. Fr Thomas Roshan D’Souza, Parish Priest of Gangolli and other guest priests.\n\nAfter the mass, a short felicitation programme was held. Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop Henry D’Souza, V. Rev. Fr Stany Tauro, Rev. Fr Thomas Roshan D’Souza; Rev. Fr Albert Crasta, former parish priest; Rev. Fr Alphonsus D’Lima, former parish priest; Rev. Fr Anil Cornelio, former parish priest and others were present on the dais.\n\nBishop Gerald Lobo, Bishop Henry D’Souza and Rev.
