        "text": "Samudayotsav – 2020 concludes with felicitation of Christian achievers of Udupi Diocese\n\nUdupi: “If everyone uses his or her talents for the welfare of the society the benefits are enormous and hence it is important that everyone in the Christian community should manifest their talents and abilities for the betterment of the society”, said the Bishop of Mangalore Diocese Dr Peter Paul Saldanha.\n\nBishop Peter Paul Saldanha was speaking as the chief guest at the valedictory function of the historic Samudayotsava 2020 organized by the Catholic Sabha of Udupi Diocese at the grounds of Mount Rosary Church, Santekatte, Kallianpur.\n\nFurther speaking, Bishop said that even though the Christian community is a minuscule minority compared to other religious communities, its contribution in the fields of education, health and social service has been remarkable. The Christian community being disciplined and peaceful and having been not vociferously responsive to many important issues and its advantage has been taken by many vested interests. There are also attempts to paint the Christian community in negative colours. In this respect, the Christian community has to be alert. Leadership in the Christian community should not be confined to the four walls of the Church but manifest their leadership qualities by doing social work beneficial to all communities.\n\nIvan D’Souza, member of the Karnataka Legislative Council who was another chief guest in his message said that in recent times there have been many dark shadows on the Christian community. Hence, they have to be vigilant. Though there are many community leaders among the Christians, it is important that they should pay more attention in entering the political field.\n\nDuring the discussion programme convener of the committee Walter Cyril Pinto placed before the audience 9 resolutions addressed to the government at the Diocesan level.\n\nOn this occasion, Christians of Udupi Diocese who have achieved greater heights in different fields abroad as well as in different states such as the cooperative movement, Directors of APMC, Gazetted and higher officials as well as those who have been serving in different organizations were felicitated. These achievers included: John D’Souza, Kundapura (Media), Julian Danti (Progressive Farmer), Roshan D’Souza, Belman (Social Service) and Francis Andrade, Kalmady (Traditional Medicine). Besides these, John D’Silva, the doyen of cooperative movement was conferred with the Lifetime Achievement honour.\n\nThe ICYM members of the Udupi Diocese presented variety entertainment programme during the lunch break.\n\nThe valedictory function was presided over by the President of the Catholic Sabha, Udupi Pradesh Alwyn Quadros. Bishop of Udupi Diocese Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, AICC member Jannet D’Souza, Karnataka Christian Development Corporation President Joylus D’Souza, President of Model Cooperative Bank, Mumbai Albert D’Souza, Mangalore MCC Bank President Anil Lobo, AICU President Lancy D’Cunha, Mumbai Catholic Sabha President Raphael D’Souza, Catholic Sabha Udupi Pradesh Spiritual Director Fr Ferdinand Gonsalves, Treasurer Gerald Rodrigues, elected President Robert Menezes, former President Valerian Fernandes, Parish Preist of Mount Rosary Church Fr Leslie D’Souza, Vice President of PPC Baptist Dias, former Zilla Panchayat President Gerald Fernandes, Gladys Almedia, AICU National President Assisi Gonsalves, Udupi Zilla Panchayat member Wilson Rodrigues, Catholic Sabha Zonal President Ronald Heric, Samudayotsava 2020 Secretary Mary D’Souza, Catholic Stree Sanghattan Udupi Diocese President Pramila D’Sa and others were present for the valedictory function.\n\nConvener of Samudayotsava 2020 Elroy Kiran Crasto welcomed the gathering, Catholic Sabha Udupi Pradesh Secretary Santosh Cornelio delivered the vote of thanks and Edward Larsen D’Souza, Suja D’Souza and Jenevive D’Souza compeered the programme.\n\nWe are jealous of our own leader – J R Lobo\n\nWe are jealous of our own leaders, we never support them nor we will be happy for him/her said former Mangaluru South MLA J R Lobo.\n\nHe was delivering the Key Note address on the topic ‘Existing situation of Christian community and future prospects’ at “Samudayotsav 2020” at Mount Rosary Church Ground on Sunday.\n\n“We are not united. There are many denominations in Christianity apart from some mainline churches. When there is no unity outsiders try to weaken us. We are jealous of our own leaders, we never support them nor we will be happy for him/her. We have no systematic plan for the new Christians which would help them to be inclusive with us. If we treat them as separate they will surely go back to their origin. Which is “Ghar Wapsi” he said.\n\n“In democracy number plays a great role. In some other districts, Christians are regarded as lower caste. Hindu fundamental groups are awakening us”\n\n“Children are our assets. We seriously need to think of having at least 3-4 children in every family. When we build people that is permanent. Media is also not in support of us. A Professional academy to train civil servant aspirants is the need of the hour. Many people who studied in Christian institutions themselves have pelted stones on our churches in Mangaluru. This means we have failed to deliver to the students of our institutions’ Christian values. Youths are not interested in the Church today. They are far from inter-human relations” he added.\n\nRetired KAS Officer Antony Mendonca, senior journalist Gabriel Vas and Advocate Fr Assissi Almeida replied to the talk by JR Lobo. Dr Vincent Alva principal of Milagrees College Kallianpur moderated the Talk."
