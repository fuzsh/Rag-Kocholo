        "text": "Geographical Location:\n\nMudarangady is a small town situated on the Indian West Coast, 5 miles east of Arabian Sea. Being primarily an agricultural area, Mudarangady is found 6 miles north-east of Padubidri (a place 40 miles North of Mangalore and 20 miles South of Udupi on the National Highway No.17) and 6 miles south of Shirva, also known as Manchakal.\n\nThe Background:\n\nShirva Parish in Udupi Taluk in Udupi Diocese was then a vast and extensive one. The Catholics of two wards – Kenha and Yellur – to the south of Shirva, 6 miles away from the Shirva Church were without spiritual care and facilities.\n\nRev. Fr. Antony Menezes of Shirva parish thought of building a Church here to ameliorate the conditions of the faithful, but his plans were frustrated as the people were not enthusiastic. So, he went to the northern side of Shirva and built a Church at Moodubelle at his own resources. Read More\n\nThe quite reliable Parish History Book gives a succinct account of the historical background of the beginning of our Church in following words: “From times immemorial there was only one Catholic Church at Kallianpur dedicated to our Lady of Miracles.The jurisdiction (was) from Airody north and Udyavara river south on the sea coast. After the Concordat in 1857 between Portugal and Rome there was erected one Church close to the mother Church. Later a chapel was built at Barkur under the control of Kallianpur Milagres Church with the united help of all the parishioners, even Udyavara parishioners inclusively."
