        "text": "This article gives a list of the territories of the dioceses of the Catholic Church in India.\n\nEach diocese is administered by a bishop. Dioceses are further grouped into ecclesiastical provinces. The most important diocese of the province is the archdiocese and the bishop of this diocese is an archbishop. While they each usually consist of a few Indian civil districts, dioceses can range in size from just a portion of a district to spanning entire states. The civil district should not be confused with ecclesiastical district or deanery, which is another type of subdivision of a diocese.\n\nAll Catholics in India are under the authority of the respective Syro-Malankara, Syro-Malabar or Latin bishop. Only in the Syro-Malabar dioceses of Adilabad, Bijnor, Chanda, Gorakhpur, Jagdalpur, Rajkot, Sagar, Satna and Ujjain, the authority of the Syro-Malabar bishop is over both, Syro-Malabar and Latin rite Catholics.\n\nIn the following, the names listed after the name of the state or union territory are the names of civil districts, unless otherwise mentioned. Some newly-created districts may be missing from this list."
