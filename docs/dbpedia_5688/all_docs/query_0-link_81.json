        "text": "History\n\nIn 1880, Fr Albert D’Souza (1879-1890) decided to build a new church and the location was shifted to Nejar Hill. The foundation stone of the new church was blessed by the then Bishop of Mangalore Most Rev. Pagani on 26 November 1880. Due to paucity of funds, Fr Albert D’Souza could not complete the church. At this juncture, Mattheus Rebello, hereditary Patel of Kallianpur pledged his property, took a loan and completed the church building. The first mass was in the newly constructed tiled roof church building was offered on 14 May 1882. On 9 January 1883, the statue of Holy Rosary was installed in the church. The church also got some land from the Patel, Ignatius Fernandes. The expansion of the church was done at gradual stages. Fr J.M. Masse (1890-1916) built the presbytery in 1895 and Fr John Salvadore Mathais constructed the portico. Fr Piedade Saldanha (1931-1938) built a shrine to commemorate the centenary of the church in 1937. Fr Rosario Denis Sequeira (1957-1967) built the grotto. The sesqui-centennial (1837-1987) celebrations were held in 1987 during the time of Fr Victor Saldanha. The cost of construction of the new belfry was donated in memory of late Louis and Leticia Rebello by their family members. The newly erected belfry was inaugurated on January 30, 1999. Fr Godfrey Saldanha completed the church hall which was inaugurated on January 4, 2001 by Most Rev Dr Leo Cornelio of Khandwa diocese who is presently the Archbishop of Bhopal. Realizing the need to spread education among the girls a primary school for them was started in 1925 and it was handed over to the Carmelite Sisters in 1933. On June 1, 1958 Lourdes Hospital built by Msgr R Denis Sequeira was inaugurated which was handed over to the Sisters of the Queen of the Apostles in 1962. Realizing the importance of English education following the liberalization and globalization policy of the government, Fr Godfrey Linus Aurelius Saldanha began Mount Rosary English Medium School in 1997. The new school building was inaugurated on June 1, 1999. Mount Rosary Church completed 175 years of existence in 2012. In order to mark the event and provide sufficient space to the ever increasing parishioners, Parish Priest Fr. Philip Neri Aranha who had taken charge of the parish since 2010 in consultation with the Parish Pastoral Council and the parishioners in general decided to rebuild the church. In order to raise the new church, a prominent site where the previous Mount Rosary church existed was selected. The foundation stone was blessed by the Bishop of Mangalore Diocese, Most Rev. Dr. Aloysius Paul D’Souza during the Mass that was held at the Millennium auditorium on March 3, 2012 and the laid at the site in the presence of a large number of parishioners including Jerry Vincent Dias-Vice President of the Parish Pastoral Council, Secretary Richard Dias and former Vice Presidents- Stany Cornelio, Prof Ligory Aranha and Benedict Menezes. The construction work of the church went on for 2 years and 9 months. As a result of meticulous planning and sustained work ably supervised by Fr. Philip Neri Aranha supported by Jerry Vincent Dias, Richard Dias and others the work of the new church is completed to the delight of all the parishioners."
