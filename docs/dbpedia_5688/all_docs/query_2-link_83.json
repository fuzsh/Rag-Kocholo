        "text": "KARNATAKA\n\nKARUNALAYA - BANGALORE\n\nThe Sisters of Charity began their services at St. John’s Medical College and Hospital and the Nursing School since 1982. The hospital is situated in the south of the city of Bangalore. It is a National Academy and is governed by the Conference of Bishops of India; hence it is an independent institution. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. The Institution has 1200 beds for inpatients distributed among various departments. More than 1500 students reside here and are studying in different institutions such as the Medical College, College of Nursing and attending other courses. Students hail from all over India. About 1000 employees are also lodged in different hostels in the campus. More than 4000 employees render their services in different departments of the hospital and teaching institutions. About 400 sisters belonging to 93 religious congregations render their services as staff and students. Most of the helpers are from low socio-economic and different cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe community of Karunalaya was officially erected as a community on 24th June 1996 in view of better service. At present sisters are involved in Administrative Services in the College of Nursing, education of the student nurses, patient care in the hospital, faith formation of students and staff nurses and service in the hostels as wardens and take care of the formation of our student sisters.\n\n*NAVA JEEVAN - is the off-shoot of Karunalaya which consists of three sisters who render full time service in Central Jail Bangalore (Prison Ministry) where more than 4,000 prisoners are detained. Special care is given to the Catholics teaching them catechism and preparing them for the sacraments. They also extend their service to persons of all faiths through their good word and counselling. Sisters work in collaboration with the pastoral plan of the diocese. They are also involved as members in Prison Ministry of India (PMI).\n\nPREM SADAN CONVENT - CHIKKAKAMMANAHALLI\n\nPrem Sadan Convent is located in Chikkakammanahalli in South East Bangalore. The Sisters of Charity started their mission in the year 1970. The aim of the mission was to build the faith of the Catholic communities who were a mixture of Tamil and Telugu languages. Their main apostolate was teaching and pastoral work. The Sisters started teaching in the lower Primary School which already existed. The majority of our beneficiaries come from lower middle class. They are often affected by social evils such as drunkenness, immoral life, exploitation of women and girls and exploitation of the poor by the land lords. 70% of the people are Catholics; 30% are Hindus and Muslims. Faith formation is the most urgent need of the hour. The sisters encourage the youth and orient them towards a value based life.\n\nSNEHALAYA - SOLUR\n\nThe mission of ‘Snehalaya’ was started in 1975, after having made a study of the socio-economic, cultural and ecclesial situation of the place which is 48 kms away from Bangalore city. In 1979, the community was erected mainly with the intention of reviving and strengthening the faith of the Catholics and to render health care to the people of Solur and of the surrounding villages since they could not have access to any hospital.\n\nMoved with compassion and considering the health needs of the people of the village, a dispensary was started and later a hospital was constructed and Nursing Aid Course was introduced. To take care of the unemployed a Rehabilitation Centre was opened in 1977 and an embroidery class was started in 1978. To save and safeguard the life of the abandoned babies a Crèche was opened and adoption work was taken up in 1979. Being provoked by so many young girls/women without education and struggling to maintain their family life the sisters felt the need to start a Grihini Training Centre and a Nursery School.\n\nThe sisters are engaged in the education of children, promotion of health and hygiene and prevention of AIDs, eradication of social evils such as abortion, alcoholism and superstitious beliefs. In order to reach out in service to the remote villages they organize various activities: mobile dispensary, medical camps, awareness programmes, and self employment schemes.\n\nThe sisters render their active service in the parish which has 130 families. The Catholics here need to be strengthened in their knowledge and practice of the Christian faith. Faith formation and continual follow up work, teaching catechism and preparing the people for the reception of sacraments are the services they offer to the parish community.\n\nSTELLA MARIS CONVENT - BANGALORE\n\nThe community was started on 11th May 1957, as a welcoming community to provide accommodation to our sisters who came to Bangalore, the state capital on official work. It had a poor beginning with 4 sisters who stayed in a rented house. They also engaged themselves in the educational apostolate by opening a school in the same house for 27 poor children of the locality. Today it has a full-fledged school from Kindergarten to High School that provides God oriented and other oriented education towards life.\n\nThe Community is situated in 23, Gayatri Devi Park Extension Bangalore with a total population of 1,61,31,589 among whom the Christian population is 4,25,000. Bangalore is a fast growing city. Its population at large is subjected to certain hardships due to overcrowding and the knowledge sector has created a lot of job opportunities. Institutions for IT, professional studies and higher qualifications are on the increase. Being a metropolitan city, its people belong to various classes, religions and language groups. Families maintain isolation and anonymity. Christian life is rather superficial and often uncommitted. Increasing tension between language groups is a sore point in the local church\n\nInspired by the availability of Mother Mary - the Patroness, the sisters commit themselves to provide education especially to the socially and economically marginalized of this locality, to prepare them to secure decent employment so as to help them to live with human dignity. They give special attention to the poor and weak students through extra coaching classes, building closer relationships with the families by their visits and offering right orientation towards life through personal guidance. The sisters actively participate in the parish activities.\n\nSNEHA SADAN - KANAKAL, BASAVANA BAGEVADI\n\nBasavana Bagevadi is one of the most backward taluks in Bijapur district, consisting of 120 villages. It is a thickly populated area with a population of 3,03,290. It is backward in all respects, especially in education and socio-economic spheres. Literacy, hygiene and health care are extremely low. Literacy is 54.47%. It has historical importance because it is the birth place of Basavanna, a Hindu reformer. Basavana Bagevadi is a home of many cultures and religions. Casteism is very much prevalent in this place. There are various categories of people such as Hindus, Muslims, Lambanis, Gollas and Maragammas. There is no Christian presence at all in this region. The caste ridden society is also afflicted with a number of social evils such as bonded labour, child labour, child marriage, devadasi system, superstitious beliefs, untouchability, oppression, exploitation and injustice. The people being illiterate are easily influenced by the religious and social customs of their neighbours. The villages are situated far away from the town and the transportation to these villages is very poor and irregular.\n\nTo this poor and neglected district of Karnataka, Jesus called the Sisters of Charity of Mangalore to incarnate themselves as missionaries to share the compassionate love of God with the most needy. The sisters from Mangalore arrived in Basavana Bagevadi in 1997, in response to the Church’s call for evangelization in view of the great jubilee of “Yesu Kristha Jayanthi 2000”. At the request and with the consent of the then Bishop of Belgaum, Most Rev. Bernard Moras, the sisters at Basavana Bagevadi were constituted as a community on 2nd January 2000 for the purpose of rural health care, empowerment of women and literacy programme of the poor and needy. Since the sisters lived in a rented house, the community was shifted to the new building at Kanakal on 29th of March 2001.\n\nSEVA SADAN - MUDDEBIHAL\n\nThe community of ‘Seva Sadan’ at Muddebihal was opened in 2006, as an offshoot of ‘Sneha Sadan’ at Kanakal in Bijapur. It was in response to the Church’s call to evangelization and harkening to the urgent request of the General Chapter, that our Provincial Superior sent a team of 3 sisters to launch out to Muddebihal. Muddebihal is one of the taluks of Bijapur which belongs to the diocese of Gulbarga. Initially the sisters experienced rejection from the people because of their fear of being converted to the Christian faith. After having appreciated their service at Kanakal, the Junior Chamber of the Jaycees invited the sisters to take up the management of their school. In addition to educational service the sisters also pursued social developmental activities side by side. The Provincial Superior, considering the needs of the locality, erected the community of Seva Sadan on 12th February, 2009 consisting of 3 sisters.\n\nThe caste ridden society is afflicted with a number of social evils such as: bonded labour, child marriages, superstitious beliefs, untouchability, oppression, exploitation, injustice etc. The catholic population of Bijapur district is 270 with 50 catholic families. There is no catholic presence in Muddebihal taluk except the sisters’ presence. The sisters are engaged in: education, health care, social service, vocational training, employment of women and pastoral care.\n\n*JYOTHI NIVAS - Gulbarga is the off-shoot of Seva Sadan - Muddebihal. The sisters render their service at Mother Theresa Charitable Hospital run by the Bishop of Gulbarga Rt. Rev. Robert Miranda.\n\nSPOORTHI SADAN - TALIKOTI\n\nThe community of Spoorthi Sadan was erected on 12th February 2009. Inspired by the services of the sisters at different places in Bijapur, Dr. Anand Bhat, the manager of the School handed over the management of the school to the Bishop of Gulbarga Rt. Rev. Robert Miranda. He requested, the Sisters of Charity to render their services in this school. The school was upgraded to a high school in 2011 with the name Sacred Heart School.\n\nTalikoti is one of the towns of Muddebihal Taluk in the District of Bijapur, which consists of a population of 75,000. There are various categories of people such as Hindus, Muslims, Lambanis, Gollas and Maragammas. Casteism is very much prevalent and quite a number of Marwadies have migrated from the Northern states of India. There is no Christian presence except for one Protestant family. The sisters are part of St. Ann’s Church, at Bijapur, which is 95 kms away and it consists of 50 Catholic families.\n\nSisters cater to the needs of the locality through value based education, promotion of women, evangelization through family visits and life witness.\n\nSHANTHI NIVAS - BETTADAMANE\n\nThough ‘Shanthi Nivas’ at Bettadamane was started in the year 1983, as a house of prayer and a holiday home for the sisters of the Mangalore province, the community was officially erected only in the year 1993. The community of Shanthi Nivas is 14 Kms away from the town of Mudigere which is the Taluk head quarters. The Bettadamane village comes under the ecclesial jurisdiction of Gonibeedu parish of Chikmagalur diocese. In the year 2003, on September 3rd the original vision of the province was finally realized with the blessing and inauguration of the prayer house for the sisters of the province.\n\nIt is an estate area with coffee as the main crop. Economically and socially it is a developing area. A few landlords hold the sprawling coffee estates and fields, while the mass of people work under them as day labourers. Around 20% of the people are illiterate. 55% of men and 47% of women are addicted to alcohol. People are also prone to superstitious practices especially in times of death and misfortune in the families. Health and hygiene are poor. The moral tone of the families is poor and family bonds are weak.\n\nBeing provoked by the needs of the people, the sisters actively got involved in the faith formation of catholic families, parish apostolate, giving value based education to non Christian families, empowering the women and villagers and offering them assistance to maintain health and hygiene. Since the need for social action ministry is strongly felt they join hands with Chikmagalur Multi Social Service Society (CMSSS) and reach out to 12 villages of Mudigere Taluk. Through 206 Self Help Groups they help 2087 families, unmindful of castes, creeds or languages.\n\nHOLY ANGELS’ CONVENT - BELVEDERE, MANGALORE\n\nThe community was erected in 1936, for the purpose of providing a more conducive atmosphere required for the novitiate house and the formation of the novices.

The sisters working in the novitiate were also the members of Belvedere community under the same superior. On 21st July 1986, for a more effective formation of the novices, the novitiate was formed into a separate community, the novice mistress also being the superior of the novitiate community. On the 10th of November 1988, the ‘Come and See’ programme for the candidates (period of Orientation) was started at Rosa Hill. The Candidates’ House was entrusted to the novitiate community. On 15th August 2009 the novitiate was constituted as an ‘Interprovincial House’ for the provinces of Mangalore and Dharwad and the community became interprovincial with the insertion of a member from the province of Dharwad.

In the following year the Rector of the college had an inspiration to convert this shelter of the TB patients into a boys’ home as this would provide scope for service to the Aloysian boys. After obtaining the necessary approval the enthusiastic sisters entered this apostolic field with great trust in God. At the inception, there were only 9 boys. This home was soon to become a Government recognized institution. It was directly attached to the provincial house; but in 1983 it became the off-shoot of Nirmala Convent. It was only on Sept. 8th, 1993 a community was erected here. The Aloysian boys’ home caters primarily to delinquent children, runaways, those remanded to custody by the police.

After the example of St. Vincenza Gerosa’s love for the poor, the sisters were inspired to open a boarding house in order to cater to the weaker sections of the society. A Tailoring class was begun in order to help the poor young girls to earn their living. In 1973, the present convent was constructed within the very premises of St. Gerosa School. In order to help to build healthy relationships between boys and girls, co-education was started in the year 2010 in L.K.G and U.K.G and then continued up to S.S.L.C.

PHILOMENA’S CONVENT - HASSAN.\n\nThe community was started in compliance with the request of His Lordship Rene Feuga, Bishop of Mysore and the civil authorities of the town, on 21st July 1945 for the purpose of education especially of Catholics.

The Catholic population is about 4,500 and they belong to the lower economic group. This is the only Catholic Educational Institution exclusively for girls in the city. The sisters commit themselves to provide value oriented education to the students, to support and aid the Catholic children who seek shelter in their boarding house due to poverty and lack of schools in the native villages, to provide hostel facilities for the PU and Degree students and also for employees, to have faith formation for the Catholic students in the Institution and to involve in the parish activities.\n\nIn fact the history of St. Philomena’s is like the story of the mustard seed in the Gospel. It was started as a humble middle school, but has now grown into a mighty tree embracing students from the Nursery to a full-fledged Degree College.\n\nJEEVANDHARA - HASSAN\n\nThe Sisters of Charity at St. Philomena’s Convent - Hassan were rendering their service through education and became more concerned towards the children of the slums and the nearby villages.
