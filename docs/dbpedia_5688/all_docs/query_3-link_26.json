Among this, around 6-7 lakhs are Christians and among them 30 thousand are the members of Syro-Malabar Catholics.\n\nIn 1999 there were only 33 Parishes where as now there are 52 Parishes and 10 Mass Centers which established to cater to the spiritual needs of the people of God.\n\nThe Bishop make extensive visits to the Parishes, meet the people and send circulars and pastoral letters which are relevant to the needs of the time.\n\nThe main and primary aim of the diocesan pastoral care is to make the people to grow as real people of God, to gain deep faith and reach the zenith of spirituality. It aims at forming the faithful according to the mind of Christ. Pastoral care is extended not only in the parishes but also in the schools, colleges, hospitals, and other institutions.\n\nHealth care, educational service and social work are extended to all the people of the diocese irrespective of any socio religious differences. The people at large are appreciative of the selfless work of the Church for the development of the whole area.\n\nPastoral care is systematically organized in the diocese via family units. The family units are small groups of catholic families in a parish. The members gather at regular intervals to study and discuss the Holy Bible, to pray, and to plan various works of charity in the community. An essential characteristic of the group is Christian fellowship. The leadership in family units is entrusted primarily to lay people under the guidance of the Priests.\n\nIn parishes there are parish councils constituted according to the norms of the Particular Law to help the parish priest in pastoral administration."
