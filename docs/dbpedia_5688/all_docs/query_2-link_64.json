        "text": "Fr. Alfred Roche, son of late Isaac Roche and late Carmen Montero, was born on 3rd April 1924 at Pandeshwar Kudru, a small island, belonging to St. Peter’s Church, Barkur, in the diocese of Mangalore (presently diocese of Udupi). His baptismal name was Peter John. He had two elder brothers -- Alphonse and Louis -- and two elder sisters -- Juliana and Cecilia. His dad, a farmer, was a sacristan in his parish for nearly 50 years, daily crossing the Sita river on a canoe (today there are solid bridges on either side of the island). It was nothing but an expression of his deep faith in God.\n\nPeter John had his primary studies at Moodahadu; his secondary studies at Sastan in St. Antony’s Parish School; and his high school studies in Milagres School at Kallianpur. He joined the Capuchin Order in 1944 at the age of 20 and did his novitiate at St. Fidelis Friary, Monte Mariano, Farangipet, in the diocese of Mangalore, and did his first profession on 11th April 1945 during which he received his new name, Alfred, as a sign of his dedication to the Lord in the Capuchin Order. In fact, changing of name before the first profession was a common practice in the pre-Vatican context.\n\nIt was during the initial formation in the Capuchin Order (postulancy, novitiate, philosophy, theology, and pastoral studies) that his love of God and love of neighbour, particularly his love and concern towards the poor and the marginalized, got consolidated. He did his final profession on 11th April 1949 at St. Antony’s Friary, Tillary, Quilon, where he did his philosophical studies and received the Sacerdotal Ordination on 11th April 1951 at St. Joseph’s Friary, Kotagiri, Nilgiris, in the diocese of Ooty, where he had the theological studies. On 14th April 1951 he had the First Eucharistic Celebration in his home-parish dedicated to St. Peter at Barkur.\n\nThe tree of Fr. Alfred Roche, sprouted and nurtured in the Roche-family, St. Peter’s Parish, Barkur, got manured and watered in the Capuchin-family during his initial formation for seven years, was ready to bear fruit in his priestly ministry. After his sacerdotal Ordination Fr. Alfred Roche was appointed the assistant novice-master at St. Fidelis Friary, Monte Mariano, Farangipet (diocese of Mangalore) on 14th April 1952. In the novitiate he rendered his precious service for four years in inspiring and accompanying the novices through his teaching and exemplary life-pattern, collaborating with the novice-master.\n\nOwing to certain schisms cropping up in the Holy Family Church at Brahmavar in the diocese of Mangalore (presently the diocese of Udipi), his Excellency Raymond D’Mello, the then Bishop of the diocese, wanted to hand over the parish to the Capuchins ad perpetuum. So, Fr. Alfred Roche was transferred to the Holy Family Church as the parish priest on 6th April 1956. He was the first Capuchin to take up this responsibility in this parish wherein he rendered his pastoral service for 16 years. One can summarize his apostolate this way:\n\nFaith-formation: This was his primary goal. With his life of simplicity and poverty, and the well-prepared sermons, he was able to touch not only the mind but also the heart of the faithful. With the gift of music that he had, along with the Sisters of Charity (Maria Bambina), he trained the parishioners in liturgical music so that the entire assembly could sing and participate in the liturgy. As a result, even the faithful from the neighbouring parishes liked to come to the Holy Family Parish to participate in the Eucharistic Liturgy.\n\nEducation: Seeing that the level of education was very low and so many children were not going to school, and on account of poor economic condition even intelligent students were not able to continue their higher studies, he began to help them through relatives, friends, and benefactors. Besides, he helped the Sisters of Charity (Maria Bambina) in purchasing the necessary plot of land so that they could start a high school which was a felt need.\n\nVocation Promotion: As the parish priest he encouraged and motivated the youth and several young boys and girls become priests and religious. To mention a few who became Capuchins: Fr. Dayanand, Fr. Vincent Furtado, Fr. Reginald Furtado, Fr. Charles Furtado, Fr Francis Furtado, Fr. Steven Lewis, Fr. Rohan Lobo and others.\n\nEcumenism: Owing to the divisions and schismatic currents that were gaining ground in the parish as well as in the neighbouring parishes, Fr. Alfred Roche, with his deep spirit of prayer and with his humble and fraternal approach, was able to build up friendly relationships with the pastors and to bridge the existing relational gaps. As a result, quite a number of families that had lost the Christian faith and had left the Catholic Church did come back to the Catholic fold.\n\nInter-religious Dialogue: Even in the pre-Vatican context, Fr. Alfred Roche was able to build up good relationship with the members of other religions. Of course, this was not an academic dialogue with a deep scientific knowledge of other religions. No, it was a friendly and fraternal dialogue. While he was visiting the families of his flock, he was also visiting the Hindu and Muslim families to build fraternal rapport with them. So, they were freely coming to him in their spiritual, social, and economic needs.\n\nConstruction of Church: When Fr. Alfred Roche was transferred to the Holy Family Church, Brahmavar, the work of the church was not complete. Only the skeleton of the church was ready. It was he who continued the work of plastering, flouring, and setting the beautiful altar with the generous help of relatives, friends and benefactors, and of course with collaboration of the parishioners. The sonorous bell that came from Italy was raised on a mighty belfry when he was the pastor. In addition to this, the beautiful chapel, dedicated to St. Paul the Apostle at Nilavar, was built under his leadership.\n\nFr. Roche was transferred to St. Anne’s Church at Binaga in the diocese of Belgaum (presently diocese of Karwar) as the parish priest on 18th July 1972. Once again, he was the first Capuchin to take up this responsibility in this parish. His pastoral ministry of 3 years in this remote parish is highly appreciated by one and all even today.\n\nGod-centred Life: First and foremost, he was a devout minister with a lot of pastoral experience. His prayer-life and fraternal approach attracted the attention of one and all. Besides, he said to the parishioners within a few days after his arrival: “Please accept me as one of your family members.” This touched the hearts of the young and old.\n\nProfound Knowledge: Since he was well-informed of the new insights presented by Vatican II, he could enlighten the faithful on issues where there were misconceptions and confusions on certain aspects of the faith. With his humble and simple approach, he could explain and strengthen the faith of some and bring about reconciliation between conflicting groups and greater communion in the parish.\n\nEvangelical Approach: Within a short time, he noticed that a few parishioners were living an immoral life and a couple of families were practicing idol-worship and even magic. Instead of marginalizing them and distancing himself from them, he tried to build closer contact with them by visiting them, particularly when they were in need. This evangelical approach of the pastor brought about miraculous changes in the hearts of these individuals who became vital members of the parish, regularly receiving the sacraments and participating in all the parish activities.\n\nRelationship with other Religions: The love and concern of the good shepherd was not just limited to his flock. It was wider than that. It came to light in a graphic manner when a Hindu boy (Bhandary by name) was killed in police firing on the occasion of the “Karwar Bund”. When the kind-hearted pastor came to know about it, he went to the house of this boy to console the family members. Besides, in order to help this mourning family, which was pretty poor, he brought two music-groups from Mangalore and gave the total collection to this family.\n\nAs Fr. Alfred Roche was rendering his devout service in St. Anne’s parish at Binaga, the Major Superiors felt that his efficient pastoral service was needed at St. Joseph’s Parish at Lower Kasarkod in the diocese of Belgaum (presently diocese of Karwar). So, he was transferred to this parish as the parish priest on 30th April 1975. Once again, he was the first Capuchin to work in this parish. The quality of his ministry in this parish can be easily known from the book of Fr. Santa Lopes OFM Cap titled Fr. Alfred Roche: A Capuchin after the Heart of Jesus. Fr. Santa Lopes is a son of the soil. He was an elementary-school-boy when Fr. Alfred came to this parish:\n\nEducation and Vocation-Promotion: Along with faith-formation, knowing the poor economic condition of the parishioners and others, his focus was on education. Seeing that boys and girls, owing to poor economic condition, were working in tile factories, fishing boats, shops, and other places, he rightly guided them to resume their studies by helping their parents economically, irrespective of caste and creed. On account of the timely guidance and support from their loving pastor, some of them have become priests and nuns. To mention the names of a few: Fr. Lancy Fernandes, Fr. Antony Lopes, Fr. Salvador Fernandes, Fr. Santa Lopes, Fr. Robin Lopes, Sr. Vinney Lopes, Sr. Leena Dias, Sr. Domenica Lopes and others. Then, there are those who gained name and fame in the parish and the society at large.\n\nReconciliation: As Fr. Alfred Roche took up the responsibility of the parish, he noticed certain conflicts and divisions in some families and in some parts of the parish. With his kind and empathetic approach and with the support of a special group called “Shanthi Dal” (instrument of peace), that he formed, he was able to bring about reconciliation and peace in the families as well as harmonious atmosphere in the parish.\n\nIn June 1981, Fr. Alfred Roche was transferred to St. Fidelis Friary, Monte Mariano, Farangipet, as the superior where he had already rendered his service as the assistant novice-master for four years. Of course, as the superior of the entire fraternity his responsibility was much greater. But, by the grace of God, his spiritual depth, vast experience in different parish contexts, and specially with his humble and simple approach he was able to shoulder this new responsibility adequately. As there were good-hearted and generous friars in the fraternity, he took them in confidence and shared different tasks with different members.\n\nAlthough, during his six years’ term as the superior, his focus was within the friary in building up the Franciscan-Capuchin Charism, nevertheless he could find some time to render a little pastoral service in the neighbouring parishes, in preaching retreats to priests, religious, and lay faithful, and specially in animating the SFO fraternities in different parishes.\n\nOn 1st June 1987 once again he was transferred to St. Joseph’s parish at Lower Kasarkod as the parish priest and the superior of St. Joseph’s Friary. The parishioners were immensely happy to welcome their highly loved and respected pastor who had already worked for them and with them for six years. During this term of office for 6 years, the aim of the good and zealous pastor was practically the same: deepening the faith of the children and the youth through catechesis, educating them and finding adequate jobs for them, enlightening and enriching the faithful spiritually through liturgical music and well-prepared homilies based on the Word of God, and fostering Eucharistic devotion.\n\nAs Fr. Alfred Roche was getting elderly and sickly, in 1994 he was transferred to Holy Family Friary as the vicar of the fraternity and to help out in the Holy Family Church, Brahmavar. It was here that he celebrated the Golden Jubilee of his consecrated life. In spite of his declining health, he continued his service till the end.\n\nOn 31st December 1996 at 5.30 am came the “Final Transfer from Above” at Fr. Muller’s Hospital, Mangalore, through a cardiac attack, telling: “Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world” (Mt 25,34).The Funeral Eucharistic Liturgy was officiated by his Lordship Aloysius Paul D’Souza, the then Bishop of the diocese of Mangalore, along with Rev. Fr. Vincent Furtado OFM Cap, the Provincial Minister of the Holy Trinity Province, with many priests and religious, thousands of lay faithful and many members of other religions on 1st January 1997.\n\nOwing to the requests of the faithful of the Holy Family Church, Brahmavar, the provincial council granted the permission to have the holy remains of Fr. Alfred Roche to be interred in the Parish Cemetery of the church where he had rendered his pastoral service for 18 years. By the grace of God, he has been raised to the level of SERVANT OF GOD by holy mother the Church. His tomb is visited by many."
