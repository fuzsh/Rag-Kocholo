Fr Vishal Lobo\n\nParish Priest\n\nOur Lady of Fatima Church, Perampally is situated in Udupi district, a coastal district of Karnataka State. Surrounded by lush greenery, the Church is about 4 kilometres away from the District headquarters and seven kilometres away from the main city of Udupi. Parishioners of the Church at Perampally are basically agriculturists. Since cultivation and agricultural products are the main source of their livelihood.\n\nPrior to becoming an independent Parish in the year 1958, Perampally was a part of Milagres Church, Kallianpur and later that of Kolalgiri Church jurisdictionally. The Catholic faithful living in and around Perampally had to take a lot of trouble to reach the Parish Church for their spiritual needs and to fulfil their obligations. During the rainy season the situation was bad because the low-lying area around used to get flooded thereby making the people quite difficult to get out of their houses. Under normal circumstances, they had to cross a river to reach the church. The threat or danger of getting drowned in the river was always there.\n\nA primary school was built at Perampally to start with the presence of a church activity and thereafter during important feasts, the parish priest from Kolalgiri church came over to offer holy Mass. A strong desire for an independent church and parish developed in the Catholic faithful of Perampally so in the year 1954, under the leadership of Rev. Fr Harry, they appealed to the Bishop B. S Peris of Mangalore Diocese for an independent parish at Perampally. Read More"
