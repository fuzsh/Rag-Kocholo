It is situated 18 kms from Kundapur city and at present belongs to the Diocese of Udupi.\n\nGangolli is a small peninsular village of Udupi district flanked by the Arabian Sea from the west and a river from the east. It is the river Pancha Gangawali which separates Gangolli from Kundapur. The place has been famous since the 16th century. It was a major trading port during the times of Tipu Sultan, Portuguese and other British rulers. Till today it has maintained its popularity and is one of the most famous fishing centers of Karnataka.\n\nHere you will experience the sheer pleasure of living a full life with the scenic beauty of the Arabian Sea, the calm backwaters of the River Pancha Gangawali, peace and quiet ambience that makes you crave for more.\n\nIn spite of the diversities present, Gangolli has been a symbol of unity in diversity and the people here, experience a feeling of oneness among them. Having imbibed a historic, cultural and religious repute, our Immaculate Conception church stands as an epitome/ensign to this cultural heritage.\n\nChurch History\n\nIn the year 1629, Portuguese Commander, Dom Miguel Noronha conquered Gangolli and built a fortress dedicated it to St Michael and a church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. But in 1630, it was rededicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. Fr George de Concessao and Fr Francis Cordeiro of the Franciscan Order used to offer mass here. In 1757 the Portuguese had to leave Gangolli and the church was destroyed. Chennammaji, the Queen of Keladi might have donated the place where the present church stands, to build a church. Blessed Joseph Vaz, the Vicar of the Canara district (1681-1685) lived here and constructed the chapel. Fr Joachim Miranda (1759-1762), a Goan missionary known as Arkula Guru by the Hindus worked here before 1778.\n\nAfter 1812, Louis D’Silva with the help of a little financial aid from the officials and friends began the construction of the church & completed it. The church had a resident priest until 1845 when it began to be served from Kundapur of which it formed a part. Fr Emmanuel Fernandes built the presbytery. Fr P.V. Gonsalves (1926-1937) constructed the Grotto. Fr Paul D.G. Rego built the portico to the presbytery. Fr M.S. Menezes built the belfry. Fr Joseph D’Souza (1956-1962) renovated the church building, except the altar and façade. Fr Michael Noronha (1962-1980) built the parish hall. Elizabeth Meier donated a huge bell from Germany and a belfry was built by Fr Thomas D’Sa to house it. Byndoor in 1850, Tallur in 1929, Padukone in 1935 and Trasi in 1971 were carved out of this parish. On May 13, 1996, a shrine in the memory of Bl. Joseph Vaz was erected and it was dedicated by Bishop Basil S. D’Souza. A chapel was erected at Kannada Kudru in 1997. On May 9, 1997 a chapel dedicated to Bl. Joseph Vaz was constructed by Fr Felix Noronha, 22nd parish priest of Gangolli since 1902. The presbytery was completed in 2000.\n\nEducation:\n\nFr Paul D.G. Rego started the Labour School on October 1, 1949. Fr Michael Noronha constructed St Joseph Primary and Stella Maris Girls’ High School. Fr Thomas D’Sa constructed the new school building at Kannada Kudru. Fr Felix Noronha did the renovation of the school building in December 2001. A new school building was constructed and computer education was started at the elementary school.\n\nSt Joseph Vaz:\n\nJoseph Vaz: Son of Goa, Apostle of Canara and Sri Lanka came to revive the spirits and faith of the widely scattered Roman Catholic community of this region in 1681. He repaired the old church. In his short stay, Vaz acquired a great and saintly reputation. He did yeoman service to the cause of the upliftment of the downtrodden. This greatly helped to keep alive and encourage the religious fervour for Christianity. A shrine dedicated to St. Joseph Vaz in the pristine beauty of Kannadakudru island witnesses the exceptional service of this living icon of God’s mercy and reconciling love.\n\nAn innovative pioneer Fr Michael Noronha:\n\nFr.Michael Noronha was appointed as the parish priest in 1962. His tenure of 18 years was a period of great paramount in the history of the parish. His farsightedness brought a revolution to this part of Gangolli. He brought Apostolic Carmel sisters to serve in the parish and established a convent for their stay. He started the Holy Cross hospital in Tarsi. As a part his contribution to the field of education he started Stella Maris Girls’ High School. As an extension of his campaign, he started St.Joseph’s Higher Primary School. Being an ardent follower/devotee of St.Joseph Vaz, he constructed a hall dedicated to St. Joseph Vaz. He renovated the sacristy.\n\nFr. Serrano, Fr.Thomas Desa, Fr.Peter Nazareth, Fr.Albert Menezes, Fr. Felix Noronha, Fr. Anil Cornelio, Fr. Stany Pereira, and Fr. Alphonsus D’lima were the Parish Priests who followed Fr. Michael Noronha & continued the same spirit of versatility. They worked for the development of the people and to strengthen the roots of Christianity in this area.\n\nMiracle of the Patron:\n\nThe church has witnessed a miracle which strengthened the faith of the locals. When the people and the church had faced a cyclone, the people tried to safeguard the statues of the church. But they could not lift the statue of Mother Mary. The next day when the people came to the church they witnessed a miracle where they saw the statue had faced the sea and the cyclone had completely subsided.\n\nThe Renovation of the church:\n\nThe longstanding yearning and aspiration of the parishioners started to expedite during the term of Fr. Alphonsus D’lima in 2015. When this topic was discussed with the higher authority, they consented and sent Fr Albert Crasta, a priest of competence to this benevolent mission. Though he was new to parish ministry, he wholeheartedly accepted the dual responsibilities. As he joined the parish, the renovation project got precipitated and all the related tasks started to spurt. On 15 January 2016, the foundation stone was laid to this renovation project by Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese. Many renowned political, social, religious dignitaries and zealous parishioners witnessed the historic event. The renovation project’s contract was given to a well-known expert and builder Roy Castelino, Roy Constructions, Mangalore.\n\nWith emphatic donors, ardent parishioners, indulgent parish council and eminent parish priest, the project went on with full swing and got completed within 16 months. The project went on in an incredible way and the parishioners believe it’s another miracle of the Patron, who stood by her devotees these four centuries.\n\nThe beautiful and historic renovated church will be inaugurated on 18 May 2017 by Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese. It is an occasion of great celebration and pomp.\n\nPresent Scenario of the church:\n\nPresently the church has 210 families grouped under 7 wards spread in the area of Gangolli, Gujjadi and Gangolli panchayat. We have 18 commissions and associations who work hand in hand for the overall betterment of the parish. God has blessed us abundantly and the families are doing well, earning here and abroad their daily bread. Many of the parishioners were called to God’s service and are serving God’s people with commitment.\n\nConclusion:\n\nToday at this phase, with an earnest leadership of Fr Albert Crasta, keen and dedicated parish council leaders, Vice-President Gerald Crasta and Secretary Preeti Fernandes and fervent parishioners, the longstanding desire has been fulfilled with flying colours by the grace of God. It’s our humble wish that in the same way May the good God continue to bless us through the intercession of our patron Mother Mary and sustain us throughout our life.\n\nGerald Newton Crasta vice president parish pastoral Council, Preethi Fernandes Secretary Parish Pastoral council, Charlotte Lobo media convener were also present in the press meet."
