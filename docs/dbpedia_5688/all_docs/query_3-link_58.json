        "text": "Mysuru: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said Saturday that probe into some of the alleged scams are underway and he will speak on them once the investigation report comes to him.\n\nThe Congress veteran said he was overwhelmed at the success of the Janandolana held in Mysuru on Friday.\n\nThe Janandolan in the chief minister's home district was in support of him and to counter the opposition’s allegations and their foot march. Asked about opposition leaders' claim that they will continue their fight until the CM resigns, Siddaramaiah said, \"Will I fear such things, will I bow down to such things? If they indulge in false propaganda. People will suppress their agitations that are with false allegations, on getting to know the truth.\"\n\nThe CM also visited Sri Chamundeshwari Devi temple atop the Chamundi Hills after a long time to mark Shravana Shanivara. Last year he has visited the temple in August to make the goddess the first beneficiary of Gruhalakshmi scheme, one of the five guarantees of the Congress government.\n\nAttacking the BJP in the state, Siddaramaiah said he knows what the saffron party state president B Y Vijayendra, his father and former CM B S Yediyurappa, Union Minister H D Kumaraswamy and Opposition Leader R Ashoka have done. “There are some more scams to be unearthed,” he added.\n\nThe BJP-JD(S) are scheduled to conclude their protest march on Saturday in Mysuru city. The final day of the 'Mysuru Chalo' protest march began at Ramaswamy circle here today and will culminate at Maharaja’s College Grounds, where a valedictory rally is organised.\n\nTo a question on the opposition’s allegations against him, Siddaramaiah said, he will tackle them politically and legally. Describing the allegation against him as ‘false’, he said, \"I have spoken on a few issues in the Janandolan and will present some more issues before the people shortly.\"\n\nSpeaking on the Janandolana, the CM said, \"It was held to counter the opposition’s padayatra, to counter their false allegations. It was held, to tell the truth to the people. The BJP-JD(S) alliance is trying to project me in bad light. They are trying to weaken the democratically-elected government in Karnataka. They think that they will be politically benefited, if they defame me. They are involved in various scams. I will expose them all, and initiate action against them.\"\n\nBengaluru: A video clip featuring former BJP MP for Mysuru-Kodagu, Pratap Simha, questioning his party’s treatment of Vokkaliga leaders has gone viral on social media. In the clip, Simha indirectly accuses the BJP of sidelining leaders from the Vokkaliga community, while also noting the prominent position held by Lingayat leaders within the party.\n\nThe authenticity of the video has yet to be verified. However, in the clip, Simha is seen expressing his disappointment with the current Mysuru-Kodagu MP, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, and Pramoda Devi Wadiyar for not informing him about Yaduveer’s plans to contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.\n\nSimha pointed out that his own situation within the BJP reflects a broader issue faced by Vokkaliga leaders in the party. Despite his strong track record and popularity as an MP, he was not given the party ticket for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. He attributed this denial to a scheme by certain leaders who used the ‘OBC’ card to ensure Yaduveer’s nomination as the BJP candidate.\n\n“I don’t think this could ever happen in Lingayat-dominated seats like Haveri, Belagavi, or Shivamogga, where Lingayat leaders are the candidates. It only happens in a seat where a young, popular, and emerging Vokkaliga leader is contesting,” Simha stated.\n\nDespite his criticisms, Simha stopped short of naming any specific party leaders, other than Yaduveer.\n\nBengaluru: EducationUSA, the US government’s official source of information on higher education in the US, will host an education fair in Bengaluru on August 18. The fair is part of a series of eight such events planned across India.\n\nThe Bengaluru event will be held at Hotel Taj on MG Road, between 2 pm and 5 pm.

There is no participation fee. Students can register for the fair on https://bit.ly/EdUSAFair24Emb\n\nThe discussions with US universities, EducationUSA advisers, and US Embassy representatives will help the students make informed choices about US higher education and learn about the US student visa application process, an official statement said.\n\nUS Ambassador Eric Garcetti said the fairs offer the students a chance to meet representatives from a huge range of US colleges and universities and get first-hand information on admissions, scholarships, and campus life.\n\nThe fairs will be held at Hyderabad (August 16), Chennai (August 17), Bengaluru (August 18), Kolkata (August 19), Ahmedabad (August 21), Pune (August 22), Mumbai (August 24), and New Delhi (August 25)."
