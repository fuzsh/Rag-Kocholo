        "text": "History of Mount Rosary Church is equally deep rooted as its Mother Church, Milagres Kallianpur, which took its birth in 1678 and the present geographical areas, though thinly populated, in those days, now under Mount Rosary jurisdiction, were under religious care and custody of Milagrians. In other words, our ancestor Rosarians about 200 years ago and earlier, were parishioners of present Milagres Cathedral.\n\nOf course various hearsay stories are making round to explain why within a furlong a new Church was formed in the year 1837. After a fairly careful, systematic and impartial study we can summarise the history of our forefathers and our beloved Church as below:\n\nLegends and folk-stories:\n\nLegend has it that Christianity was spread in Coastal Karnataka, by two of Christ’s Apostles, viz, St Thomas and St Bartholomew, after the Master’s resurrection and ascension to heaven, who arrived by sea route and landed near Tonse, hence the place eventually named after him and Bartholomew who accompanied him all the way, later finding it difficult to continue his mission and journey with the former, down to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, for he kept poor health and opt to stay back in Colombe island and spread the good news at and around Kallianpur. The estuary embracing Arabian Sea with both Swarna and Seeta rivers together was an ancient maritime port. In this surrounding they spread the good news and baptised many. At that point of time, the faith in Almighty God was propagated as a way of life, than a new found religion. It is said that he worked extensively in Barkur, healing sick hence the place was given his name Bartho-lomew-ooru, Barakuru. While discussing with a few elders of the parish, we feel proud to claim that it is our Coastal Canara was first to receive warm reception to the disciples of Jesus Christ, who were the live witnesses, to live, dine and taught by Him some 2000 years ago…..!!\n\nArrival of European Missionaries in Konkan region and Portuguese influence from Goa over Canara:\n\nWith above in mind and lot many folklore stories, one can infer that Christianity was in existence in this place in the early Christian era. It was given a proper shape or form by the Europeans especially by the Portuguese Missionaries in the 15th Century having their political as well as religious head quarters located in Goa. Migration of these Konkani speaking Konkans down to Coastal Karnataka, due to various socio-economic reasons in large number received overwhelming reception by the then rulers of Canara, especially Keladi Kings, for their hard work, honesty and enterprise. When these settlers increased by number as years rolled on, the Catholic faith and Mother Mary’s special devotion they brought with them needed Sacraments to enrich their faith and pass it on to generation next. There were visiting Goan Priests arriving to Canara to preach and pray especially during Lent, feast of Nativity of Blessed Mother and Advent to celebrate Holy Mass and practice and celebrate Sacraments and religious activities.\n\nIt was around this time, some community leaders approached Rani Chennammaji for royal patronage and Queen generously gifted spacious land to establish its Milagres Church in Kallianpur in the year 1678. (Now almost 340 plus years gone by) The community prospered and secured for almost a century, with no considerable threat or uncertainty. Many households had their business in agro-based produce like, coconuts, areca, rice cereals, spices etc and islands or Kudru’s so far left un- explored were developed as coconut groves and paddy fields etc.\n\nAtrocities of Tippu’s soldiers and infamous captivity of our ancestors on 24th February 1784:\n\nTippu the son of Hyder Ali was then the Sultan of Mysore, with whom British were having wars, suspected that the Christians in Canara were attached to English. On the 30th January 1784, English lost war with Tippu at Bidanore, and surrendered to Tippu’s forces. He gave secret order to his Commanders to seize all Christians in Canara and take them captive to Srerangapattana, Mysore. It was an unexpected and sudden strike on that fateful Ash Wednesday on the 24th February 1784, wherein the soldiers of Sultan carried out Tippu’s secret orders and arrested Christians en-masse, throughout Canara simultaneously. Kallianpur being the nerve centre of Catholics in Northern Varado, hundreds of families were arrested and marched to Mysore by barefoot. It is said a few ran away by that night by boat, some hide in forests and a few took shelter in Hindu and Muslim friends’ houses. Exceptionally a few families were untouched and in Tonse, Thottam, Kemmannu these families were located. Along with Milagres Kallianpur, then existing Churches in Barkur and Petre too were either destroyed or damaged….. It needs pages to narrate this ordeal of suffering. Only after the death of Tippu in 1799, in the last Battle of Mysore, very few survivors returned back to Canara to see their belongings and property in the hands of others.\n\nOnce again they had to start everything by scratch and the hardworking community first built the damaged Church in the year 1806. The Goan priests were serving in Kallianpur.\n\nThe conflict of Padroado and Propaganda Mission of Verapoly:\n\nOne has to study, political history, social status and religion together to understand the ups and downs in the long voyage of Catholicism during the past 350 years or more, in Kallianpur and its surrounding. Similarly, the very birth, of our Rosary Church, and later its struggle to survive and establish as an independent parish, sacrifices of both laymen and clergy, challenges within and external, hardship to keep the flock together and continue the faith in one Almighty Lord etc is worth a mention and understanding.\n\nThe influence of Hindu Caste system was deep rooted even in the minds and dealings of newly converted faithful, though Church never entertained such discrimination. Diminishing political power compared to British resulted in loosing hold or clout of Portuguese in colonial India, with the dawn of seventeenth century. Holy See during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI started appointing Bishops, in 1832. Earlier practice was Crown enjoyed influence to appoint and Pope normally used to endorse. It so happened the Arch Bishop Antonio Feliciano Carvalho chosen by Portuguese King not consecrated and approved by the Pope, arrived and took the administration of the Goan diocese on the 20th September 1836.\n\nChurches in Canara till then served by Goan priests under Pedroado Jurisdiction. Since long the religious needs were well taken care by Goan priests, the majority of the faithful preferred to continue with the Arch Diocese of Goa. On the other hand Holy See was entrusted with the responsibility of serving the then existing Churches in Canara to Vicariate of Verapoly. In this confusion, there formed two groups, one insisting to keep the status quo with the Goan Arch Diocese and the other showing affiliation to Verapoly Mission directly reporting to the Holy See in Vatican, Rome.\n\nThe construction of a separate Rosary Church in 1832:\n\nNow coming to Kallianpur Milagres Church, a section of few households, aware of this dual jurisdiction by then made links with Vicar Apostolic of Mission Verapoly, tried to convince the majority but not succeeded and eventually revolted and came out and started the process to establish a separate Church just opposite to Milagres Church in the year 1832. Mr Antony Rebello of Tonse donated a part of his landed property in front of the Milagres Church for the erection of the new Church. A rickety shed, with a thatched roof got ready for the celebration of the first parish feast, at about the beginning of January 1837. Internal feud and misunderstanding was continued for almost 50 long years till the year 1878, Rev. Fr Albert D’Souza was appointed as first Parish Priest over here. In one sentence, it was in subordination but no ideology or doctrine was involved, in this war of one up-man-ship…..!!\n\nWe find no authentic records to explain how this temporary thatched roof Church served, maintained or continued its existence. There are some hearsay reports to state, once in a while some visiting priests from Verapoly Mission used to visit this place and offer Holy Mass. The structure was not safe and secure to keep the Sacrament and there was no resident priest.\n\nWe feel proud to state here, the land on which early ‘Rosary Church’ was standing later given to Board High School on rent. It was our valuable Church property, with provision of shops earning a small income and in the year 2020, this plot measuring 85 Cents was donated by our Mount Rosary Church to the Diocese of Udupi, for its developmental work.\n\nNew Mount Rosary Church in the present location on Nejar Hills in 1882:\n\nAfter almost half a century of uncertainty, 1832 – 1878, probably first resident Priest Rev. Fr Albert D’Souza, was appointed to look after the Rosary Church, just a furlong away from Milagres Church in Kallianpur.\n\nA man of far sight, devotion, specially chosen to make peace, by the then Propaganda Mission, Rev. Fr Albert D’Souza, took the flock together and convinced politely to look for a new location not to hurt their feelings to remain independent and a vast 17 acres of land was procured on Nejar Hills, where today our present Church stands. The present site, which was then a piece of barren wasteland was obtained from the Government on darkas by Mr Ignatius Joseph Fernandes, Potail of Tonse East and West and one of the Moktesars of the church. It was acquired in his name and later on transferred to the Church.\n\n14th May, 1882, is the day written in Golden letters in the history of Rosarians. A new Church was built and probably it is one of the earliest to come under Propaganda Mission of Verapoly. Around this time Vicar Apostolic of Mangalore Msgr Pagani was promoted to the grade of new Bishop of the Diocese of Mangalore, and consecrated on 25th November, 1885 and on 25th January, 1887, Mangalore was declared as an independent diocese.\n\nOnce the Mount Rosary Church was erected, its boundaries were not based on geographical landmarks, which was an accepted practice. People and families surrounding Mount Rosary, had an option to choose their parish. It is said competition leads to confusion and our parish was smaller in size, less number of parishioners with a single priest serving over a period of next 50 years.\n\nA royal and loyal flock of Mother Mary of Mount Rosary – with determination, self respect and independence:\n\nOur ancestors in Mount Rosary parish were highly devout over the decades and devotion of Rosary was very close to their heart. Various priests led the flock to divinity and a life of prayer.\n\nVICARS OF MOUNT ROSARY CHURCH, KALLIANPUR – AT A GLANCE\n\nFr Albert D’Souza 1878 – 1890 Vicar\n\nFr Maffei S.J. 1890 – 1916 Vicar\n\nFr John S.
