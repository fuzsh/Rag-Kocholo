        "text": "NEW WEBSITE: www.ephesians-511.net DECEMBER 2006\n\nPENTECOSTAL GROUP MASQUERADES AS CATHOLIC:\n\n‘ THE ARMY OF JESUS’ EX-NUNS\n\nLord of Hosts. Hosanna! This is the title of a booklet of 1000 Biblical verses issued by The Army of Jesus [Trumpet Publications]. The address 6, Vivekananda Street, Srinivasa Nagar P.O., Perungalathur, Chennai 600 063, Tamil Nadu;\n\nTel. 2239 5221. Perungalathur comes under the jurisdiction of the Catholic diocese of Chingleput, a suburb of Chennai.\n\nThe Army of Jesus will sometimes be referred to as AoJ in the report below. It is led by five ex-Catholic nuns.\n\nThe AoJ was founded by\n\nSr. Angelica\n\nof the Sisters of St. Anne, Trichy [S.A.T.]. When moving in non-Catholic circles, they use the prefix “Sol.” [=Soldier] to their names; with Catholics however, they use “Sr.” [=Sister]. For the sake of convenience, I will continue to use “Sr.” before the names of the ex-nuns.\n\nIn the booklet, Sr. Angelica states, “On March 7th of 1993, I was praying with three sisters in my convent. The Lord commanded me to raise an Army for Him, pronouncing the verses of EZEKIEL chapter 31, verses 1 to 10. I diligently obeyed him. The consequence is The Army of Jesus, which is a multitude of warriors for God. The first troop of the Army was formed on 1998 November 12 at Manaparai*, Tamil Nadu, India in the name of ‘El-Shaddai’, God Almighty, consisting of 10 soldiers. ‘The Lord Almighty is mustering an Army for war’ ISAIAH 13:4…” *Catholic diocese of Tiruchirappalli\n\nShe thanks Sol. Merine Alex of Thangachimadam who formulated the booklet, 4000 copies of which were printed and distributed in Tamil in 2001, [“A number of people who prayed making the use of this booklet were released from the bondages of sin, curses and sorcery”], and Sol. Geetha of Pune who undertook the translation into Marathi.\n\nThe sisters have been conducting meetings in Catholic homes in the city of Chennai for several years now. One unit of the AoJ, formed about four years ago, has about eight members mostly from the parish of St. Anthony’s Church, Pudupet.\n\nThrough Catholic friends, I received invitations to join these meetings and meet some “mighty warriors of God” as the nuns were described. I could not accept the first invitation on the 15th of November, 2006, as I had to make a dash to Bangalore to check out an event at the NBCLC [National Biblical, Catechetical and Liturgical Centre of the CBCI. Report as yet incomplete.] But I was able to read a copy of the 20-plus resolutions of the meeting, and note a few of them, which are:\n\nMeeting of November 15, 2006, at the residence of Mr. Cletus Vincent*, Chennai\n\n1. “Immersion baptism should be introduced.”\n\n2. “Distribution of wine along the bread.”\n\n3. “People who are involved in adultery and other bad habits should not be pardoned more than three times.”\n\n4. “Celebration and veneration of feasts and saints should be banned forever.”\n\n5. Statues in the church should be located at a minimum of eight feet above the ground. [Ostensibly so that devotees would then be unable to touch or kiss them]\n\n6. “Abolish the gifts received from Constantine, instead accept the gifts of the Holy Spirit.”\n\nA Catholic charismatic who has led a prayer group in the city was present at this meeting as well as at the following two.\n\nMeeting of November 21, 2006, at the residence of Mr. Cletus Vincent*, Chennai\n\nPresided over by Sr. Angelica\n\nand\n\nSr. Leemarose.\n\nSr. Angelica did all the talking. She introduced Sr. Leemarose as a former Mother-General of the congregation of the Sisters of St. Anne, Trichy [S.A.T.], who had been in Rome for many years, and had “come out” and joined the A0J.\n\nBoth were attired in the white religious habits of Catholic nuns. Around her neck, each wore a chain with a pendant.\n\nShe wanted to know the different Church affiliations of those present, about 15 in number. The hosts and I, just three, identified ourselves as Catholics. A fourth Catholic identified himself as an ecumenical Catholic. The others were from the Church of South India, the Orthodox Church, and from minor Pentecostal ministries. The daughter of a Protestant Bishop was in attendance.\n\nSr. Angelica shared her testimony. She had faithfully served in Administration for 30 years, but had never really felt happy or satisfied with her life as a nun. She had also never read the Bible, never heard of the Second Coming of Jesus, and never evangelised anyone in her life. She was trained to believe that obedience to her Superior, to the Congregation and to the Church was obedience to God, and doing the will of God. She never realised that actually that was incorrect.\n\nThen, one day “When I was praying in the chapel,” [of her convent], “the Lord asked me, ‘Are you serving Me, or are you serving the Congregation or the Superior-General?’ ” It was then that she realised that the three were not the same.\n\nShe experienced a desire to leave the Order, but was hesitant because a nun who leaves her Congregation is not accepted by family, the Church and society, and life would be very difficult for her in the world outside.\n\nFive years later, when she was in Madhya Pradesh, “The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘One day I will take you out’.”\n\nSr. Angelica also shared about her many visits to Padua [in Italy] where she venerated the [still incorrupt] tongue of St. Anthony, and to Lourdes in France where she venerated the [miraculously preserved] body of St. Bernadette.\n\nNow the Lord spoke to her that He was not a God of the DEAD, but the God of the living. She quotes, “Depart, depart, come forth from there, touch nothing unclean! Out from there! Purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. Yet not in fearful haste will you come out, nor leave in headlong flight, For the Lord comes before you, and your rear guard is the God of Israel.” Isaiah 52:11, 12\n\nSr. Angelica shared, though the chronology is not clear, that a Ravindran [evidently a Pentecostal] had prophesied to her in a ‘prayer meeting’ that God had revealed her name to him, that God had a mission for her.\n\nTaking it as a sign, she and two other sisters “came out” of the Order. “The Lord asked us to come out to raise leaders.”\n\n“The Lord gave us a fifteen days Bible course which is called ‘Shekinah’. We conduct it once every month at Manaparai from the 15th to the 30th. Upto now, over 2000 people have attended the course. This ministry we have been doing for the last eight years. It is called ‘The Army of Jesus’.”\n\nAccording to her, the names given by them to their organization and courses, the contents of the courses etc. are all by revelations received from God.\n\n“In September [2006], I got a revelation as in Genesis chapter 41. It concerns India where just 2% of the people are Christians. That is because we have failed to preach the Gospel. The Lord revealed to me that there will be a period of seven years [from 2007] of plenty- spiritual abundance and evangelisation. It will be followed by seven years of famine [of the Word of God] washed with the blood of the martyrs, persecution… a freedom struggle from sin and Satan. After that India will be a Christian nation.”\n\nGod has further revealed to Sr. Angelica after the seven plus seven years are over that “The Bible will be taught in all schools, and the salaries of the Bible teachers will be paid by the government of India.”\n\nSr. Angelica shared that she became fascinated about the ‘Second Coming of Jesus’. As a nun, she had never heard of it, Catholics do not talk about it, and priests do not preach about it. Or about “the rapture, when the just will all be caught up in the air in the twinkling of an eye”, 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17, 1 Corinthians 15:52, and the millennial or 1,000 year physical reign of Jesus on earth. The mission given by God to The Army of Jesus is to help prepare for this Second Coming of Jesus. She studied the Bible rigorously from this perspective, especially the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe north of India, she explained, has just 20% of the Christians, whereas 80% of all Indian Christians live in the south.\n\nThat is because Christians have failed to do missionary work in the north of India.\n\nThe Lord has “asked us to collect 20% of the believers from every Church and send them to the North. The Lord has given them a name, ‘hill horses’ [‘malai kuthirai’, in Tamil]…” She called for a show of hands of those who were ready to go on mission to the North of India. The Church is not about an organisation or structure where people collect and remain. Christians should not remain in any structure. They should be trained for a period, for a year or even two, and then they should be sent out to proselytize others, and in turn train them and send them out to preach the Gospel. “Being a member of a Church and sitting in church is like watching a circus or an orchestra. ‘This is not the Church’, the Lord said,” referring to people who fulfill their Sunday obligation of attending a service and being satisfied with it, according to Sr. Angelica.\n\nThe ex-nun received her latest revelations while spending time in private retreat at a quiet place- Avila Farm, Pudupathi, Navakkarai, Coimbatore 641 105, near the Palghat, Kerala border. Avila Farm comes under the diocese of Coimbatore.\n\nRecently, according to Sr. Angelica, on one of her visits to Chennai, God spoke to her to attend the funeral of a pastor of the A.C.A. Church. She had never heard the name of the pastor before, she explained. When she went for the service of pastor Jeevanandam, she was saddened to note that all Christian denominations were represented there, except the Catholic Church. Since then, she has a burden for the unification of the Churches. Then she “got a message” to meet Pastor D. Mohan of the New Life Assemblies of God. After that, she has been contacting the leaders of the different denominations in the hope of bringing them all together, especially in the light of her vision of the seven plus seven years now commencing. She expressed her desire that some Bishop of the Catholic Church would support her efforts.\n\nThe meeting ended rather abruptly with Sr. Angelica excusing herself as she had an appointment with pastor D. Mohan.\n\nI informed Sr. Angelica that I was associated in the release of the first issue of a Catholic fortnightly named “The Catholic Times” which we were about to bring out in December, and requested her for an interview. She replied that she would like to “pray over” my request, and asked me to hand over my contact details to Sr. Leemarose, which I did. I did not hear from the ex-nuns after that. It was probably my response [to her initial enquiry about our individual backgrounds] that I am orthodox in my Catholic faith, that determined her decision to not give me the interview.\n\nWanting to know more about their activities and to question them, I accepted a second invitation to meet them during their presentation at a Catholic home.\n\nMeeting of December 4, 2006, at the residence of Mr. Cletus Vincent*, Chennai\n\nPresided over by\n\nSr. Angelica\n\nand Sr. Roger.\n\nAs earlier, Sr. Angelica did all the talking. She introduced Sr. Roger who had been in the Congregation for 40 years and had also “come out” and joined her.\n\nMuch into the meeting, she enquired about the different Church affiliations of those present, over 30 in number. About half of those present were Catholics, and identified themselves as such. As before, others were from the Church of South India and from minor Pentecostal ministries. This time, the wife of a former CSI Bishop was in attendance. About ten persons present here had attended the earlier meeting.\n\nAlmost at the start of her testimony, when explaining to the gathering her earlier experience as a nun, she said, “We have the Blessed Sacrament- we Catholics have in the box- I hope you understand.”\n\nShe informed the group that the Bishop of Trichy had “sent a statement to the priests saying not to entertain the sisters because they don’t encourage Catholic preaching.”\n\nThis presentation of Sr. Angelica was almost on the same lines as the earlier one, except for a few additional details which, for the sake of convenience, are included in the above report of the November 21 meeting.\n\nAfter she completed her narration, one of the persons present, a Mrs. Olive Brady who said that she was a teacher from St. Mary’s School, shared that she had received a “message” from God about the same seven plus seven years, but did not understand it at that time. Sr. Angelica enquired from her when she might have had that vision, and Mrs. Brady replied that it was about three months ago. On hearing that, Sr. Angelica declared that it was the same time when she had received her message, so it was a confirmation by God that such an event was surely going to take place.\n\nThe ecumenical Catholic quoted Amos 8:11 concerning the “famine of the Word of God” that God warned His people about.\n\nSr. Angelica’s revelations that India would be a Christian nation in another fourteen years, and of the Indian government actually paying the salaries of Bible teachers in all schools, were among a few statements that were greeted by applause.\n\nIt was fairly obvious that no one was going to question her critically on any aspect of her sharing, so this writer requested and received permission from Sr. Angelica to seek some clarifications from her.\n\nI first asked her what it was about the AoJ that the Bishop of Trichy did not approve of- that he had to warn his priests not to entertain the sisters. I added that even after my presenting evidence to Bishop Anthony Devotta, the Bishop was permitting priests to continue to practice many errors [see my report on CATHOLIC ASHRAMS] in his diocese. So, what was the reason that the Bishop had taken exception to the AoJ’s activities, I enquired.\n\nSr. Angelica replied that she would not like the names of Bishops to be taken and would rather not reply. I insisted that it was she who mentioned the Bishop, and it was she who expressed the desire that she would like to have a Bishop support their movement. I added that I was aware that Archbishop Abraham Viruthakulangara of Nagpur had recently attended one of their programmes, which meant that she did have the support of a Catholic bishop. She responded that the Archbishop knows her since a long time and hence he had accepted their invitation to attend the programme [see below].\n\nI requested sister to explain the manner in which she received her messages from God, how she heard His voice or experienced divine revelation as she frequently said things like “the Lord asked me”, “the Lord gave us”, etc. She did not give a satisfactory response to that question.\n\nAt the previous meeting too, Sr. Angelica repeatedly claimed that Catholics are not only ignorant of the Bible but that the Church had kept it away from the common people. The Protestants in the group supported her. I had objected to those statements, and provided facts, figures, dates, and historical evidence from the Councils of Carthage and Hippo to the time of the Reformation, to refute her erroneous claims.\n\nI now explained to sister that Catholics are not as ignorant of the Bible as she was continually making us out to be, that Catholics have awareness of the verses about the “rapture” etc, that there are Catholic Bible colleges in India which we have attended, and that Catholics do not interpret the Bible literally [her interpretation of periods of 1000 years, 7 years and 3 ½ years, the millennial reign of Jesus, etc] as many Protestants do. A person enquired of her as to when Jesus was coming again. She admitted that she could not say anything about the time of the Second Coming of Jesus.\n\nI enquired about the pendant on her chain and asked her if she did not consider it as an idol. She smiled and answered that they had replaced the medal of their former Order with one bearing the Word of God.\n\nNext, I drew her attention to her dress which was the religious habit of a Catholic nun, and I asked if she had not received any message about discarding it. Again she smiled and replied that Jesus has not spoken to her yet about it.\n\nComing to the issue of her burden for unification of the Churches, I asked her if it is not a paradox that she herself has left the Catholic Church to form her own and is thus further dividing the Body of Christ. I pointed out that she was always using negative phrases like “come out’ and “get out” when referring to the Catholic Church, and that she had declared that God had revealed to her that she had to get out because the Church was dead and unclean.\n\nA lady interrupted to protest that I was the only one asking questions and the group did not want to hear sister’s answers to my probing. I replied that sister was speaking in a Catholic home wearing the habit of a nun while at the same time urging people to come out from the Catholic Church, and there were Catholics in the group that wanted me to question her.\n\n*Cletus Vincent has now left the Catholic Church and become a member of a Pentecostal denomination- Michael\n\nI added that I had talked to several priests before attending the meetings [including Fr. Charles, the Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Madras-Mylapore on November 23] and they had given me a mandate to come back to them with a report.\n\nSr. Angelica said that she would like to meet me separately and answer all my queries. I regretted that I could not agree to that because she had already turned down my request for an interview with her after the earlier meeting.\n\nOne person who seemed to be arranging these visits of the AoJ, an ex-Catholic who is still very actively engaged in joint-programmes involving our Catholic priests, one of them being the subject of my August 2006 exposé IN PRAISE OF SHIVA [the investment by Fr. Jegath Gaspar Raj of Rs 1.5 crores in a music audio praising the Hindu deity], intervened and tried to bail out the ex-nun. At this point of time, Sr. Roger rose from her seat and hurried out of the room.\n\nI requested him not to answer for the ex-nun. And, I firmly insisted that Sr. Angelica answer my questions. She talked so much about facing martyrdom and persecution, I pointed out to her, but was afraid of answer questions concerning her beliefs. It seemed that almost everyone in the room was on her side, and I was isolated, but I still had no fear, I said.\n\nAs a Catholic I wanted clear answers from her, and was ready to face the consequences of my standing for my faith. Why was she masquerading as a nun? I asked her; why couldn’t she boldly state that she is a Pentecostal?\n\nI reminded her that she had said,\n\n“We have the Blessed Sacrament- we Catholics have in the box.” People here were confused, I told her, because that statement meant she accepts being Catholic, yet she spoke disparagingly of what Catholics have “in the box”. So, was she Catholic, or not. She declined to answer the question. I persisted, demanding that she answer with a forthright ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Did she believe in the Real Presence in the Eucharist, did she attend Holy Mass, did she believe and participate in the Sacraments of the Church?\n\n“No,” she answered.\n\nMEETING WITH SOLDIERS OF “THE ARMY OF JESUS”\n\nAccompanied by a friend who operates a Catholic ministry on the internet, I met with AoJ members who have left the Catholic Church and whose names I will not divulge in writing for several reasons, some of which are these. They seem to be sincere Christians with a great thirst for both receiving as well as sharing the Word of God with everyone they meet.\n\nAs Catholics, they had led very un-Christian lives, some of them even worshiping Hindu deities. Many of them experienced repentance and conversion after retreats at the Divine Retreat Centre, Muringoor. They were active in charismatic prayer groups and meetings in their parishes and homes. In this, it appears that they have received little support and much opposition from their parish priests. In most cases, it seems, only one family member has come out of the Church, while the rest of their family members remain Catholic. Their homes still have crucifixes, statues, and pictures of the Blessed Virgin and the saints retained by the Catholics in the family; but there are the new additions of framed quotations of Bible verses. In one home that we visited, the AoJ member was on his knees in prayer. Some of these people have spouses, children and grand-children working or studying in Catholic institutions.\n\nPerceiving me as a potential member and future trainer, they confirmed to me what I had already recorded, and provided further information of their own free will even after I revealed to them that I am Catholic and in fulltime ministry.\n\nThe AoJ members believe that they are “saved” after they left the Catholic Church and joined the AoJ. [Some of them unknowingly contradict themselves when they claim that they were “saved” at Divine Retreat Centre years ago]. Those in their family who are still members of their parish, go for Mass, practise Catholic pieties and maintain “idols” in their homes, are “not saved”. In some homes, these “idols” have been smashed to pieces or burnt. The AoJ does not believe in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist and the Blessed Sacrament. They also reject clericalism and the papacy. The basis for their beliefs and practices is their interpretation of the Bible. They do not accept the Deutero-Canonical books.\n\nThe look-alike Catholic pendant at the end of the chain that the sisters wear says, “Army of Jesus. God, All in All” according to an AoJ member. I never got close enough to check it out for myself.\n\nAoJ members point to the influence of Sr. Angelica in their leaving the Church. Sr. Angelica had mentioned to us that it took a long time for her to convince Sr. Leemarose to leave the Order with her. When she and Sr. Leemarose “came out”, they were staying in a hut with no toilet facilities. Sr. Leemarose used to attend Holy Mass at a parish church only so that she could use the toilet on the premises. When the parish priest learned about this, he put a lock on the door to the toilet, so the nun stopped attending Mass. Eventually a family gave them a decent place to live in. They faced a lot of opposition from their family, friends, and Catholic society, even from Sr. Anitha, the elder sister of Sr. Angelica who was also in the congregation of the Sisters of St. Anne, Trichy [S.A.T.]. It took a few years for Sr. Anita to “come out” and join the AoJ.\n\nThe AoJ believes that if the sisters divest themselves of their habits, they will not be able to attract and influence Catholics. According to them, Catholics believe anything that is preached by someone wearing a cassock or a habit [and there IS some truth in that]. The ex-nuns therefore still wear their habits to be able to access Catholics, and they avoid criticising Catholic beliefs during their home visits, or answering delicate questions [as with me at both the meetings that I attended].\n\nThe aim is to get people to join their 15-day Shekinah programmes. Here, Catholics are indoctrinated in the AoJ gospel, but very gradually. Their true beliefs are brought out by the third or fourth day, at which point many Catholic leave. Some have left the AoJ after completing the courses and returning home because of pressure from their families or the Church. Others have faced the wrath of irate fellow-parishioners for denouncing the cult of Mary. A few report that they faced problems with their parish priests when “unsaved” family members needed to get married in the Church.\n\nSome AoJ members however still hold to some Catholic beliefs and practices and are unable to break away for different reasons, even after taking immersion baptism, which is how they get “saved”. The immersion baptism is conducted by a pastor of any non-Catholic denomination.\n\nWith the numbers of AoJ adherents increasing, the need is being felt for a sort of ‘support group’ for those who face such problems after leaving the Church. Prominent ex-Catholic preachers [see below] might work together for a solution.\n\nThe Shekinah courses are free of cost, to attract people, and are now conducted at various centres that are mushrooming all over Tamil Nadu. As Sr. Angelica cannot handle the increasing activities, trained lay ex-Catholics are assisting her.\n\nOne such regular meeting point near Tambaram on the outskirts of Chennai is Jacob’s Garden, rented from the Brethren Church. AoJ members admit that they often conceal the fact that the programme is of 15 days duration in order to attract [lure?] potential members. Depending on the situation, they have sometimes advertised it as a four-day course, and are not averse to lying in order to “save” people from the error that they live in as Catholics.\n\nWe were given to understand that AoJ has recruited many Catholics into their fold among the predominantly Catholic fishing communities in the coastal areas of Pamban and Rameswaram, villages around Trichy, and all over Tamil Nadu.\n\nWe were given the names of rich and influential Catholic businessmen in Trichy, Chennai and Coimbatore who have given donations and logistical support to the AoJ.\n\nOne of them is industrialist Mr. V. J. Wilson, Managing Director, Wilson Equipments, Rainbow Industrial Complex, Civil Aerodrome P.O., Coimbatore 641014, tel. 2626915; residence: Beth Asher, 50/2 Rainbow Avenue, Krishnaswamy Nagar].\n\nThe Avila Farm, which Sr. Angelica uses as a retreat, is owned by him, according to AoJ members.\n\nIt is said that at least one nun from a congregation other than the S.A.T. has joined the AoJ. While Catholics are the “main target group” in the words of the AoJ members whom I spoke to, they report that Christians from other denominations have started joining the AoJ. No details were available of their reaching out to people of other religious persuasions, which is an issue that I took up at the end of the December 4 meeting, pointing out to the gathering that true evangelization and costly discipleship would mean taking the Gospel to those who have not yet heard it, instead of sheep-stealing from the other Christian denominations and especially the Catholic Church, which is exactly what is presently going on.\n\nWe were also informed that though some supporters have made offers to donated land or buildings to the sisters for their meetings, the Lord has spoken to them that they are not to own any property, so they declined these offers.\n\nAgain, in an attempt to show that they are different from Catholic priests and nuns who amass property and money, they seek not to hold money but to utilise completely what they receive by sharing it with the needy.\n\nThe Eshcol National Harvest Festival, 8th and 9th November, 2006 organized by The Army of Jesus\n\nTwo well-known Catholics who are now not in communion with the Catholic Church were among those present at the AoJ’s Eshcol National Harvest Festival held at Padapai [a suburb of Chennai]: the lay preacher\n\nMr. Cruz Divakaran\n\nwho has given retreats several times at many Catholic churches in the city including the National Shrine, the Basilica of St. Thomas in San Thomé, and\n\nFr. S.J. Berchmans, the founder of Jebathottam [Prayer Garden] Ministries. An Anglican Bishop was also in attendance. The rest of the dignitaries at the Festival were pastors from different Pentecostal churches, including the New Life Assemblies of God’s D. Mohan [Little Mount] and the Apostolic Christian Assembly’s M.K. Sam Sundaram [Purasawalkam]. Hundreds of Catholics have left the Church to join these sects in Chennai.\n\nCatholic Archbishop Abraham Viruthakulangara of Nagpur graced the AoJ’s Eshcol National Harvest Festival [he was there only for a day]. Padapai comes under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Chingleput. The sister also met with Archbishop Abraham at the Coimbatore railway station on the 18th of November on his return journey from Thrissur to Nagpur. I was informed that Mr. V.J. Wilson of Coimbatore was the sponsor of the Archbishop’s trip.\n\nOn the 7th and 8th of December, Sr. Angelica presided at the programme of Fr. Berchmans at his Kalaiyarkoil centre, in Sivagangai district, Tamil Nadu. She had another ex-nun along with her. Cruz Divakaran was also invited to conduct some sessions. I confirmed this by calling 04575- 232266 [the number of the office] as well as 94436 12625 [Br. Joseph] and 94438 61025 [Bro. Sekhar]. This centre is in the Catholic diocese of Sivagangai.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nA group of nuns of the Order of St. Anne of Trichy led by Sr. Angelica have left the Church, guided by private revelations reportedly received by her from God. Still wearing the religious habit, they masquerade as nuns who have discovered that a literal interpretation of the Bible holds the answers to the Church’s apparent shortfalls and errors. They have established centres in several places in Tamil Nadu where they conduct regular courses during which they attempt to convince attendees that to be “saved” they need to “come out” of the Catholic Church, abjure all its teachings and practices, and be subjected to a second baptism by immersion by which they are inducted into their movement called The Army of Jesus.\n\nThe Army of Jesus has found support from some rich and influential Catholics, and through them have been able to meet other Catholics and thus expand the areas of their operations and influence. They have allied themselves not only with the whole spectrum of Pentecostal churches, but especially with the leading ex-Catholic now-Pentecostal ministries of Bro. Cruz Divakaran and Fr. S.J. Berchmans.\n\nIn the above connection, I have written three email letters to each of the Bishops of Trichy, Dindigul, Coimbatore, Nagpur and Chingleput. I have received a response to this matter of most serious concern only from the Bishop of Trichy.\n\nFrom:\n\nprabhu\n\nTo:\n\ntrichidio@eth.net; antonydevotta@rediffmail.com\n\nSent: Tuesday, December 05, 2006 5:52 PM\n\nSubject: THE ARMY OF JESUS\n\nKIND ATTENTION: MOST REV.

In late October, a decree from the Vatican Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life expelled the nuns from the order. Archbishop Franc Rode, prefect of the congregation, said in a letter to Sister Barbara Rodek, the official mother superior, that he saw “no readiness for dialogue or signs of good will” from the nuns. Sister Barbara has been staying in Lublin with other nuns from the order while waiting for a resolution.\n\nFather Puzewicz said: “Unfortunately the sisters in Kazimierz did not wish to acknowledge the resolutions of responsible church authorities, nor did talks with archdiocese representatives and local parish priests’ help.”\n\nThe Polish Press Agency reported Dec. 1 the nuns refused to accept the ruling and hired bodyguards.
