        "text": "\"All I wanted was to come home to spend Christmas with you.\" Disney has unveiled an official trailer for a short film called The Shepherd, based on the book about a RAF pilot's miraculous flight. This project is co-produced by none other than fellow filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón, who's enthusiastic about adapting this story. On Christmas Eve in 1957, a fighter pilot on his way home from a distant mission gets lost mid-flight over water and needs a miracle to land safely. It will, of course, be streaming this December just in time for the holidays. Cuarón explains: \"I was a long-time admirer of this story and, being old friends with Iain, he was the perfect match to bring this beloved narrative to life on film for the first time.\" I'm nice to hear this kind of support. He was inspired by the success of last year's short Le Pupille, which we've also added below. The 38-minute film stars Ben Radcliffe, Steven Mackintosh, Luca Slade, Millie Kent, Asan N'Jie, and John Travolta. This looks much better than it sounds - tons of nice shots of this plane flying right on the edge of the atmosphere. And, how's this, it's also from the same director as Hackers! Check it out below.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Iain Softley's short film The Shepherd, direct from YouTube:\n\nAnd here's the trailer for last year's short film Le Pupille by Alice Rohrwacher, also right from YouTube:"
