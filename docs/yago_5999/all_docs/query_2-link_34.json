The music was produced by Don Was. A score based album with Don Was' original music was also released. Recording sessions for the album started on March 26, 1993 at Ocean Way Recording, in Los Angeles, California.[2] Many of the songs on the album were first takes.[3][4] Don Was stated in an interview with Variety, that \"the makeshift band recorded 15 songs in three days with virtually no overdubs (except Pirner’s vocals, recorded on separate dates) and no more than two takes. “The self-imposed deadline was one of the devices that I used to keep it raw and spontaneous, so we wouldn’t scrutinize too much,” Was said. “Because at that stage the Beatles were a wild teenage band that compensated for their lack of finesse with a tremendous amount of energy\".[5] The promotional video for \"Please Mr. Postman\" was filmed in Germany, in March, 1994, for the UK promo single, which was released on May 3, 1994.[6][7]\n\nThe album won the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.\n\n\"The Backbeat Band\" consisted of:\n\nDave Pirner (Soul Asylum): vocals\n\nGreg Dulli (The Afghan Whigs): vocals\n\nThurston Moore (Sonic Youth): guitar\n\nDon Fleming (Gumball): guitar\n\nMike Mills (R.E.M.): bass guitar\n\nDave Grohl (Nirvana): drums\n\n\"Money (That's What I Want)\"\n\n\"Long Tall Sally\" – Dave Pirner\n\n\"Bad Boy\"\n\n\"Twist and Shout\"\n\n\"Please Mr. Postman\"\n\n\"C'mon Everybody\" – Dave Pirner\n\n\"Rock & Roll Music\"\n\n\"Slow Down\"\n\n\"Roadrunner\" – Mike Mills\n\n\"Carol\"\n\n\"Good Golly Miss Molly\" – Greg Dulli\n\n\"Twenty Flight Rock\" – Dave Pirner\n\nA three-track CD single was also released of music from the soundtrack, including two songs that did not appear on the album.\n\n\"Money (That's What I Want)\"\n\n\"He's Wearing My Bathrobe\" (End Title)\n\n\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\"\n\nAn album with Don Was' original score music."
