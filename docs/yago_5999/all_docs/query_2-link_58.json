        "text": "When people remember the Beatles, they think of John, Paul, George and Ringo. However in the early days, the Fab Four were five, when Stuart Sutcliffe played alongside the legendary musicians. Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff) had only a passing interest in music and a passion for painting. For his best friend, John Lennon (Ian Hart), Rock’n’Roll was the only art. “Backbeat” tells the true and tragic story of their friendship, the music, the woman who came between them and the wild times they shared when their innocence was lost. The legend was born.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
