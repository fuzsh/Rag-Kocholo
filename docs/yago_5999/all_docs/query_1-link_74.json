Every week we’ll be plucking the highlights. This is that.\n\nTEN TERRIBLE MOVIES BY GREAT DIRECTORS\n\nHow to describe the experience of watching a movie by your favourite director only for it to slowly dawn on you that it’s a horrible, horrible piece of work? Betrayal? Bewilderment? Anger? Sometimes it just feels so impossible to believe that people as talented as Francis Ford Coppola, Dario Argento, or Gus Van Sant can churn out these cinematic horrors.
