        "text": "The rise of the Beatles will now be the subject of an upcoming theatre production.\n\nThe 1994 flick Backbeat – the story of the early days of the Beatles in Hamburg, Germany – has now been adopted for the stage.\n\nThe film’s plot was based on the relationship of Beatles’ original bass player Stuart Sutcliffe and a local snapper, Astrid Kirchherr. Iain Softley, the helmer of Backseat, has directed the stage production. And, Softley has planned to open the play in Scotland where Sutcliffe was born.\n\n\"I am so delighted that, after all these years, we can bring Backbeat to the theatre, and to debut in Scotland where Stu was born,\" the Daily Express quoted him as saying.\n\nThe play will debut in February 2010 at Glasgow's Citizens Theatre Scotland."
