        "text": "DVD & Blu-ray: Backbeat (1994)\n\nI remember the massive fuss over this film when it came out, and there’s no doubt watching it now, it’s a film of its time.\n\nBackbeat is a snapshot of Hamburg and John Lennon’s (Ian Hart) (and the Beatles) relationship with Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff), the original bass player who only got the job because he was John’s best friend in school. Oh and he looked cool (Google him, so cool).\n\nOf course the film makers didn’t have the rights to use any of the Beatles back catalogue, so they responded with 50s rock and roll songs (which in fact was accurate, they really did do covers in Hamburg), sung by the rock stars of the 90s.\n\nWe follow John and Stu forming the band and heading off to Germany to play strip clubs. But of course Stuart’s heart wasn’t really in music, it was art, and it was only a matter of time before he met his muse; photographer Astrid Kirchherr (enigmatic pixie cut Sheryl Lee). With her friend/boyfriend Klaus, she introduces Sutcliffe to the German avant garde art scene, and much to Lennons chagrin, he belongs.\n\nIt’s then played as a love triangle between Astrid, Stuart and John. Sutcliffe’s sister, Pauline Sutcliffe, in her 2001 book ‘The Beatles’ Shadow,’ Pauline considered the possibility that the two men may have had sexual encounters. “They clearly had a very emotionally intimate relationship,” she wrote. “Anything could have happened.” Which may or may not be true. She also said it was Lennon who kicked Sutcliffe in the head and it wasn’t a street brawl…as shown at the beginning of the film.\n\nDorff’s portrayal of Sutcliffe is good (just the odd – ‘what accent is THAT’? here and there), but it’s Ian Hart’s film. He played Lennon before in the short The Hour and the Times, and I’m always amazed he’s not one of our national treasures, a working class lad, who’s just an outstanding actor and really makes Backbeat come alive with his palpable jealously, anger, and brilliance.\n\nI kinda like this film, its aged really well, and if you’re a fab four (or five) fan, it’s a must.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nAudio Commentary with Iain Softley, Ian Hart and Stephen Dorff.\n\nA conversation with Astrid Kirchherr.\n\nDeleted Scenes.\n\nInterview with Director Iain Softley and Actor Ian Hart.\n\nIain Softley Interview for the Sundance Channel.\n\nTV Featurette.\n\nCasting Sessions.\n\nStills Gallery.\n\nDirector’s Essay (DVD only).\n\nTrailer.\n\nReleased 6th May 2024."
