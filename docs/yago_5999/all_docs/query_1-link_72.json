        "text": "Six years ago there was a little movie called “Hackers” about a group of smart teenagers who use their computer hacking skills to challenge the government and bring down an evil corporation. This film, directed by Iain Softley (“Backbeat”), is considered by some to be a cult classic.\n\nUsing techno music and flashy computer graphic displays mixed with witty dialogue and a fantastical plot, the movie seems right at home with contemporary fare. After “Hackers,” Softley took a few years off and then directed the critically acclaimed art-house period piece, “Wings of the Dove,” in 1997.\n\nNow four years later, Softley is back again with the new film, “K-PAX.”\n\nThe obvious draw for this movie is Kevin Spacey (“American Beauty”) in the lead role. He’s displayed prominently on the poster, decked out in red sunglasses and looking towards the sky. His co-star, Jeff Bridges (“The Big Lebowski”), is just a blurry huddled figure in the background. This poster arrangement is more or less an accurate graphic portrayal of the dynamic between these men in the film.\n\nThe plot is simple; Prot (Spacey) claims to be an alien from the planet K-PAX. He may be a delusional genius or he might really be a tourist from outer space. The previews for the film wisely leave the question unanswered, and this review will respect that. Prot ends up spending some time in a New York City mental hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges).\n\n“K-PAX” primarily concerns itself with following Prot around and watching him interact with other patients and Dr. Powell. Much like “Hackers,” “K-PAX” is full of clever dialogue and amusing vignettes.\n\nSoftley displays his directing chops repeatedly as he manages to do amazing and beautiful things with light throughout the entire film. The score by Ed Shearmur is as playful and enchanting as the story it weaves itself around.\n\nSpacey displays his flawless delivery of razor-sharp dry comedy and sprinkles in a few moments of raw dramatic intensity for good measure. Bridges, who is capable of tremendously well-executed comedy, opts instead to play straight man to Spacey’s Prot. The result looks something like the poster — Spacey shining brightly in the foreground while Bridges fades softly into the background.\n\nThe film is well executed and flows smoothly and quickly from one episode to the next. The patients in the mental hospital where Prot lives are all carefully constructed two-sided stereotypes. They are, at least, treated with some respect instead of being purely exploited for comic value.\n\nIn fact, calling this movie a comedy isn’t entirely accurate. The humor is understated and somewhat cynical. The funniest moments come from Prot deadpanning criticism at the stupidity of the human race. The film builds towards a dramatic and rather disturbing climax and ends with a voiced-over lesson about savoring life.\n\n“K-PAX” originated as a popular novel by Gene Brewer. The script is clever and it gives Spacey plenty to do during the two-hour run time. It is also a skillfully shot and well-orchestrated production. The edge of “Wings of the Dove” is missing, but “K-PAX” continues in “Hackers'” playful and innovative footsteps."
