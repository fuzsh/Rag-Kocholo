        "text": "If you haven't seen Hackers before, it's awesomeness is comparable to that of The Fifth Element and Real Genius. The film opens on a SWAT takedown of a tiny boy, Dade Murphy, or \"Zero Cool,\" who has committed various felonious acts by hacking into computer systems and planting a virus he designed. His parents are fined a ridiculous amount of money and he is banned from using a computer or anything close to one until his 18th birthday.\n\nFlash forward to high school. Dade meets the smokin' hot Angelina Jolie in one of her very first films, as well as young versions of future stars Jesse Bradford, Matthew Lillard and Renoly Santiago. They discover a secret plot to plant a supervirus by a super douche in the business, and must use all their skills together while avoiding the Secret Service, who has noticed that the craziest hacker of all time is back on the web, and trying not to dry hump Jolie every time she says something sarcastic.\n\nThe best part of this film is the special effects of \"the internet.\" Whoever made this film obviously thought that all business and personal networks were connected somehow on the web, and that you could access them and, at the same time, unlock a tiny screen world of rolling colorful characters similar to the cover of a little indie flick called The Matrix (don't worry, you probably haven't heard of it). The prank sessions and the secret hacker show are close runner ups on the scale of awesome. This movie is also rife with references to nerdy pop culture, including Transformers, Allan Ginsberg, and the Bible.\n\nHackers is rated PG-13, but it's for language and Angelina Jolie, so I would say somewhat mature tweens would be totally fine watching. As for everyone else: if you haven't seen it, for the love of awesomeness please go rent it; if you've seen it before, go rent it again and show it to your loved ones. I will leave you with this quote:\n\n\"Spandex: it's a privilege, not a right.\" - Cereal Killer, Hackers, 1995"
