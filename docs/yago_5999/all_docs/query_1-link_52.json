The interior shots were instead taken at Shepperton studios in the United Kingdom.\n\nUsing Liguria as the dominant backdrop for the film was ideal for evoking the fairytale feel of the story, also as the city has both coastal and mountain scenery.\n\nhe first part of the film was filmed in the Piedmontese town of Entracque, which lies in the province of Cuneo and was covered in artificial snow for the purpose, the valley near Colle di Tenda and the ancient bridge of Fanghetto, in the province of Imperia. The fortress of Realdo was instead used as the home of the evil Capricorn, whose village was reconstructed in the old town of Balestrino in the province of Savona. The coastal scenes were filmed in the historical centres of Laigueglia and Albenga and in the Art Deco railway station of Alassio.\n\nWhere it was filmed 'Inkheart'\n\nAll the exterior shots in the film were taken in the very same places in which Cornelia Funke set her book of the same name, which the film is based on, and where she herself lived for several years.
