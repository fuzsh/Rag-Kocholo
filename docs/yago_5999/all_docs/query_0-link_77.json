        "text": "We all need a little hope… and perhaps a guardian angel to help us lead the way. Get the Kleenex ready for the Disney+ short film, The Shepherd.\n\nBased on the novella by the acclaimed author Frederick Forsyth, The Shepherd follows the story of a young RAF pilot flying home across the North Sea on Christmas Eve. He finds himself in peril when his radio and electric power cut out, leaving him stranded and running on limited fuel. Just when it appears his luck is about to run out, a mysterious good Samaritan appears above the fog below him and the story takes an unexpected turn. The Shepherd brings to life a much-loved tale that was previously adapted for stage and radio but never before seen on-screen.\n\nIain Softley has made a wide range of international films as director, writer and producer. His first film, Backbeat, which he wrote and directed, opened the Sundance Film Festival and went on to receive a BAFTA Award nomination for Best British Film. Iain received Best Newcomer Awards from The London Film Critics Circle and Empire Magazine. His film Hackers, starring Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie in her feature film debut, became a cyber punk cult classic. Other Softley films include The Wings of the Dove, which earned 4 Academy Award nominations and won a number of awards including two BAFTAs, The Skeleton Key (Kate Hudson, Gena Rowlands, John Hurt), and Inkheart (Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren, Paul Bettany, Jim Broadbent).\n\nThe Shepherd - Streaming December 1st on Disney+\n\nI spoke with Iain Softley about adapting this beautiful story for the screen and what it was about it that touched his heart."
