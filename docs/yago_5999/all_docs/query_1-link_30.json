        "text": "by Cheri Barner\n\nAfter years of paying his dues in commercials, music videos, and BBC\n\ndocumentaries, Iain Softley made the difficult leap into feature films\n\ndirecting. Softley’s first film “Backbeat“, the story of Stuart Sutcliffe,\n\nreceived critical raves, allowing him to go big budget with his second\n\nfilm, “Hackers“. But after the techno-thriller “Hackers” proved to be a misfire\n\nboth at the box office and with critics, Softley nearly became one of\n\nindependent film’s many one hit wonders. Recently, Softley answered\n\nquestion about his new project. “The Wings Of The Dove” is being released\n\nby Miramax.\n\nindieWIRE: How did the director of “Backbeat” and “Hackers” come to choose a\n\nHenry James novel for his next movie?\n\nIain Softley: I was offered the book when I was in post production for\n\n“Hackers” by Steve Evans, who is one of the producers on the film. I looked\n\nat the book about the same as Hossein Amini the screenwriter, and I think\n\nwe were both confused as to why this book had been chosen as a potential\n\nfilm, because it’s very episodic, there is very little dialogue, it’s all\n\naction that you can’t translate at first sight. It’s almost a series of\n\npsychological commentaries, almost an impressionistic piece, it was\n\nobviously going to be quite a chore to adapt it. But in the process of\n\ndiscussing this, we both realized that it, particularly in the character of\n\nKate Croy, was a very interesting story about love and betrayal.\n\nThe characters themselves, have a dark side to them that to us, made them\n\nfascinatingly human. (They are) full of contradictions, not easy to read\n\ninitially, which suggested to us that they were really interesting\n\ncharacters for a film treatment. We had the idea of approaching it as film\n\nnoir. My approach was from the beginning was to not make something that was\n\nto the traditional literary adaptations — to reach an audience that was\n\ninterested in cinema, but who might be unaware of the book, as most of the\n\naudience would be. There was a sense in which I wanted to be different from\n\nthose films in that we were concentrating on the things that were perhaps\n\nsimilar between those periods and now, as opposed to the things that\n\ndistinguished it. And to only include things if they worked in terms of\n\nfilm, and be really ruthless with the source material. So I started working\n\nwith Hossein, and we spent about eight months on the script together.\n\niW: Since Kate was the impetus for your interest in the project, was that\n\nthe most important role for casting purposes?\n\nSoftley: Yes, she was, and the relationship between Kate and Merton was\n\nvery important as well. There was sort of an age span that the part could\n\nbe played in, and it was really when I met Helena (Bonham Carter) that I\n\nrealized that (her’s) was really the right kind of combination of ages. She\n\nneeded to have a child like vulnerability on the one hand, but also to have\n\na womanly sexuality — and Helena can really play that gamut.\n\niW: You chose to change the novel, creating a nude love scene at the end of\n\nthe film, why?\n\nSoftley: Well, it was really on two levels; one, was that it was a piece of\n\nsocial observation, you know that this is something that often happens in\n\nrelationships that are breaking up, that people make one last desperate\n\nattempt to resuscitate the relationship. Often it ends in a desperate\n\nclinging to each other, almost like drowning souls. On the other level it\n\nreally was a portrayal of the fact that all of the deceptions, all of the\n\nveils were pulled away, that here were the characters naked in front of\n\neach other, confronting each other with just themselves. In a sense there\n\nis, I feel, a redemption at the end, because for the first time they are\n\naware of what they’re doing. They’re being honest with themselves. They’re\n\nasking each other direct questions, and giving each other direct responses.\n\nSo it was really the inexorable move towards the core of the relationship,\n\nand the realization of what it’s come to.\n\niW: How was the translation of the book?\n\nSoftley: It was a massive, I mean the only way to approach the book was to\n\nsay “We’re completely forgetting the book.” We didn’t refer to it when\n\nwriting the script at all, it was just done from memory. Interestingly in\n\nthe notes for the book that I read, there is an interview with Henry James\n\nwhere he talks about the possibility of doing a theater production of “The Wings Of The Dove”, and I was very reassured that he had as a bold an\n\napproach to reconceiving his work for a different medium as we had. That he\n\ntook to completely changing the story once he put it on stage, which really\n\nindicates to me the hopelessness of attempting to be too literal in a\n\ntranslation.\n\niW: Did you have an idea of who you wanted to play the parts when you were\n\nwriting the script?\n\nSoftley: I don’t really envisage people at the beginning. I try not to\n\nbecause, apart from the obvious thing of avoiding disappointment if one\n\ncannot get the person that one had in mind for the whole process of writing\n\nthe script, I think that it’s important to start with a blank sheet of\n\npaper through audition process, and really to be open to be surprised by\n\npeople. We might to have seen people in one role when they come in, and you\n\nmight see a woman who is only known as an action movie actress who actually\n\nhas this incredible background in some independent work that one might not\n\nbe aware of, and when you put the actress together with the text in an\n\naudition it’s interesting how often one’s surprised that people reveal a\n\nside that’s different from the stereotypes that you might have.\n\niW: Did you know there were other Henry James films coming out at the same\n\ntime?\n\nSoftley: The first we knew of it was when we realized that there were other\n\nactresses and other people auditioning for another film in the Chateau\n\nMarmont at the same time as we were, and it happened to have been another\n\nHenry James film. So that was quite interesting.\n\niW: Were you worried about the competition?\n\nSoftley: I think in an ideal world there wouldn’t be any other’s around. I\n\nhave to be honest about that, but there comes a point when one has to have\n\nconfidence in the work of oneself.\n\niW: What’s next?"
