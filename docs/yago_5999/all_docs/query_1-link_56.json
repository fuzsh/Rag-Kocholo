        "text": "Writer and director Iain Softley has very successfully brought to life author Fredrick Forsyth’s novel The Shepherd. It lauds the brave and heroic pilots of World War II who repeatedly fly out to meet battle-damaged aircraft returning from their mission and they would go above and beyond their call of duty to guide the battered plane and their airmen home to safety.\n\nFlying officer Freddie played by Ben Radcliffe puts in a stellar performance as the unfortunate pilot suffering aircraft instrument failure, his wrestling with the anguish of his situation and professional training is complimentary of the RAF. In addition, Freddie is accepting of the whole situation right up to the end, realising that the events could only have been ‘heavenly.’\n\nJohn Travolta as John Kavanaugh, the shepherd raised the bar of the film, his performance so typical of World War II US airmen is epic.\n\nThe cinematography by John Mathieson was an excellent mix of monochrome and soft colours.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the accompanying music by Anne Chmelewsky, a good fusion of stirring American bravado and stiff-upper-lip Britishness.\n\nThe Shepherd deservedly has been given the nod for an Oscar."
