        "text": "\"Foster's thoughtful and well-researched look at race and the blues via an exploration of a distressed and declining Southern rural town will be useful to music and sociology academics.\"--Library Journal\n\n“This is a book about music and culture. But, most of all, this is about Clarksdale’s Black residents’ self-conscious challenging of the possibilities denied to them by the status quo. . . . [Foster’s] work also opens room for other comparative investigations approaching similar processes all over the African Diaspora spaces in the American continent . . .” --Oral History Journal\n\n“I Don’t Like the Blues interlaces historical events and personal stories that illuminate the lived experiences of Black residents of the city of Clarksdale, Mississippi. . . . [Foster’s work] retains the true characters of Black Clarksdalians whilst providing them a space and tool to talk about their lives.”—Social Forces\n\n“Just as southern Black folks are supposed to uncritically love the blues, a sociologist is not supposed to give us such a superbly written book. But southern Black folks will fool you, and apparently so will southern Black sociologists. There will be important books and essays written about what B. Brian Foster has done from a critical and methodological perspective, but the writing in I Don’t Like The Blues is breathtaking—the best I’ve read in 2020. I have never needed a book as much as this one.”—Kiese Laymon, author of Heavy: An American Memoir\n\n\"With this moving book, B. Brian Foster offers us a landmark study of race and music in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and asks us to consider what Black life looks like and, most importantly, sounds like in the rural South. No one before Foster has captured Black voices as clearly and poignantly. Drawing from nearly 250 interviews, he spends time ‘kicking it with folks’ who express their anger and disappointment that blues music has been stolen from them. I Don’t Like the Blues is a gritty, deeply human book that every American should read.\"—William Ferris, author of Give My Poor Heart Ease: Voices of the Mississippi Blues"
