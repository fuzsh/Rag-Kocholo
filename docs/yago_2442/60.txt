Emma Thompson and Greg Wise have been married for more than 20 years - and the secret to their long-lasting love has been revealed.

Greg, who turns 58 today (May 15), first met Emma, 65, on the set of Sense and Sensibility in 1995. The couple tied the knot in 2003 and share two children together; adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, 36, and daughter Gaia, 24.

Opening up on how their relationship has lasted the test of time, Greg told HELLO!: "To keep bloody working at it. If it's a friendship that also has a love and children attached, you've got to work that much harder."

The film producer recognised that their work means they have to spend time apart, but they have managed to take it in their stride.

He added: "Possibly the secret is not spending the entire time together. As actors, there is a lot of separation in our life because we get ripped away to spend months filming or touring. So we are probably quite good at plumbing ourselves back in after long times of being apart."

In March, the Strictly Come Dancing alum appeared on Good Morning Britain where he revealed he wasn't invited to the Oscars when Emma won her second Academy Award, despite starring in the film with her.

The Harry Potter star won the Adapted Screenplay award at the 1996 ceremony for Sense and Sensibility. However, Greg's role as John Willoughby in the period drama wasn't enough to score him an invite to the star-studded event.

Emma was instead accompanied by her mother, actress Phyllida Law, to the ceremony. Host Susanna Reid was stunned that Greg didn't get a ticket to the glittering ceremony, however, the actor didn't seem to mind.

"Yeah. That's how it works. I am holding up the ballerina," he said, using the metaphor of the male dancer holding up the leading dancer.

The dad-of-two added: "I was no one." To which Susanna insisted: "But you're not no one." Greg interjected: "That's fine. I don't have to go to everything."
