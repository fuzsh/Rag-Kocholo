Just two.\n\n“But you don’t know, do you?\n\n\"They haven’t got time for a lot of shagging, I hope, they’ll be so exhausted.\n\n\"I am not going to the show every week.\n\n\"Karen’s gorgeous, she’s from Venezuela and is only 39.”\n\nMeanwhile, the couple’s daughter Gaia, 21, added that her dad would be prepared to perform shirtless because he has a six-pack.\n\nAt the Icon Ball for London Fashion Week on Friday night, she said: “He has a six-pack and will take his top off if he is needed to.\"\n\nGreg has asked for advice from last year’s winner, Bill Bailey, 56.\n\nHe said: “Bill was very useful. One of the things he told me is to get my patent leather ballroom shoes ready and wear them around the house.\n\n\"He had a problem with blisters on his heel over the run.”"
