        "text": "With actor Greg Wise having been signed up for this year’s Strictly, viewers can expect to see his wife Emma Thompson cheering him from the audience.\n\nThe couple have been happily married for almost two decades after originally meeting on a film set.\n\nNow proud parents to two grown up children, they have one of the strongest partnerships in Hollywood.\n\nBut how did they make it to where they are now? Let’s take a look.\n\nGet exclusive celebrity stories and fabulous photoshoots straight to your inbox with OK!'s daily newsletter. You can sign up at the top of the page\n\nEmma met Greg on the set of the film Sense and Sensibility in 1995 when she was 36 and he was 29.\n\nSpeaking about the meeting, Emma has previously said how Greg was expecting to meet someone but took a while to realise it was her.\n\n\"Before he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy and she said he would meet his future partner on the film,\" Emma revealed.\n\n\"He assumed it wasn't me because I was married and quite a lot older than him so he thought it might be Kate. He took her to Glastonbury, and she was so bored, and he thought, 'This isn't going to work, who can it be?'\"\n\nIn fact, it was Kate who encouraged him to look towards Emma after they realised the two of them were not best suited.\n\n\"[Kate] pointed out that we were right for each other and told me that Emma’s marriage was over,” he reportedly explained. “It was all meant to be, just as my friend Helen had predicted.\"\n\nEmma was previously married to Kenneth Branagh for five years before they split, citing conflicting work schedules as the reason the relationship broke down.\n\nHowever, it has been reported that Kenneth was unfaithful while filming with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nEmma hinted at the rumour when she said that real life experiences influenced her Love Actually role, of playing a cheated on partner.\n\nHowever, she has also credited meeting Greg as helping her to move on from the experience.\n\nEmma once told Radio 4, “Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.”\n\nIn 1999, they welcomed their first child, a daughter called Gaia.\n\nEmma struggled to conceive again naturally which led to the couple’s decision to adopt their second child, a son called Tindyebwa Agaba Wise.\n\nShe, Greg, Gaia and Tindy were photographed outside the palace after Emma received her Damehood for services to drama.\n\nAfter eight years of dating, the couple married in July 2003 with Gaia as their flower girl. Greg wore a traditional Scottish kilt for the occasion.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, Emma declared at the time, \"This for me is heaven. It has been a wonderful day”, before joking, \"We'll need to get inside, Greg has got no knickers on.\"\n\nWhile Emma’s sister and fellow actor Sophie Thompson is said to have shared that \"there wasn't a dry eye in the house\" on their wedding day.\n\nEmma has joked that she’s given her husband Greg Wise condoms in case he falls victim to the infamous ‘Strictly curse’.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Greg’s dancing debut, the Oscar winner told The Sun: “I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so. I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two. But you don’t know, do you?”\n\nThe star went on: “They haven’t got time for a lot of s***ing, I hope, they’ll be so exhausted!”"
