        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing launches on Saturday night, and taking to the dance floor in a bid to impress the judges and viewers at home will be actor Greg Wise.\n\nGreg, 55, married his Sense and Sensibility co-star Dame Emma Thompson in 2003, having begun their relationship in 1993.\n\nThey welcomed daughter Gaia in 1999, and four years later they informally adopted Tindyebwa Agaba, a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier.\n\nTindyebwa graduated with two degrees and speak eight languages, and he is now a humanitarian who works with a specialist arm of the Metropolitan Police, helping refugees just like him.\n\nGreg said of the Met Police role: \"Tindy is just about to start a job there and he’s doing some very interesting things for them – an adjunct of the work he was doing in war zones.\n\n\"Helping struggling people, working with victims of trafficking and radicalisation… that kind of thing.\n\n\"It’s a very rewarding thing to have happened.\"\n\nFor more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.\n\nTindy's biological father died of AIDs when he was just nine, and when he was 12, soldiers with machine guns stormed his village to kidnap its children.\n\nHe was rounded up along with nine other children and marched across unfamiliar bush for days.\n\nHis next memory is of arriving at a prison camp where he would remain for three years – to be radicalised, brainwashed and trained as a child soldier.\n\nAged 16, having finally escaped Rwanda, thanks to the kindness of a charity worker at Care International, he boarded a flight for London to claim asylum.\n\nBut he ended up living a difficult life, sleeping rough on the streets around London’s Trafalgar Square.\n\nHe met Emma when she offered him help at a Refugee Council event, before tracking him down again and inviting him round for a Christmas Eve dinner.\n\nThat dinner turned into regular stays at her £15million house in West Hampstead, North London, where he was given his own room, and that turned to whole weekends, and whole weeks.\n\nIn the end, Emma and Greg adopted him \"informally\" – as by then, Tindy was enough to make his own legal decisions, and he moved in with the family permanently.\n\nSpeaking about the reasons they decided to informally adopt Tindy, Emma has previously said: \"Sometimes being friends is not enough.\n\n\"You need family. I think we don’t talk enough about the happiness that it gives you to find new connections with strangers and people who aren’t familiar to you.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of his Strictly debut, Greg explained he has a touching reason for taking part - his sister Clare, who died of cancer in 2016, aged 51.\n\n\"I was asked and I thought, 'No, I absolutely can’t do it',\" Greg said during a press webinar.\n\n\"And then I thought about it. Almost exactly five years to the day my sister died will be the first day we do our routines on this and my sis was a real disco diva.\n\n\"She was the dancer in the family and she left this world in a glitterball coffin, and as this show is all glittery and diva-y and disco-y, I thought I had to do it for her.\"\n\nAsked what Emma thought of his new project, Greg revealed: \"She said, 'You’re mad, you’ve got to do it!'\"\n\nHe continued: \"We were going to go on holiday and over the space of a five minute conversation we had, the whole of autumn was kicked into the long grass and here I am.\n\n\"She’s thrilled because she’ll be able to relax, support me and watch every Saturday night - or as many Saturdays as I survive.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share? We'd love to hear all about it. Get in touch via yourmirror@mirror.co.uk\n\n* Strictly Come Dancing launches on Saturday, 18th September at 7:45pm on BBC One"
