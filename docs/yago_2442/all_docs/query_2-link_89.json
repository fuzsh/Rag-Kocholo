Which I think took the sting out of it slightly on the Saturday night.\"\n\nBefore this he had not shown or told Emma and his family anything about what he was doing on the show, he said: \"I didn't pass anything by them, at all.\"\n\nGreg and Emma have been together since 1995 after they met on the film set of Sense and Sensibility. They married in 2003 and later that year they adopted a Rwandan orphan Tindyebwa Agaba.\n\nStrictly It Takes Two is on every weeknight from 6:30 PM on BBC2."
