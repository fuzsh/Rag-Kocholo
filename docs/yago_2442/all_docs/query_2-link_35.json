        "text": "It's not about money for anyone, the show doesn't pay enough for that to be the primary reason anyone does it. The idea of an Emmy-winning Hollywood actor doing Strictly is just ridiculous.\n\nIt is, the best they can do is have a partner of a genuinely famous person, ie Penny Lancaster or Greg Wise: in Greg‚Äôs case Emma Thompson was in the audience on several occasions and gave excellent participation from her seat, I counter that saying this was in the height of the first lockdown so she was probably at a very loose end üòâ\n\nThere wasn‚Äôt a lockdown during the 2021 season, though she may well have been at a loose end\n\nCovid restrictions were in full flow but yes an actual lockdown might not have been in progress actually during the series, one came pretty soon thereafter though. I just remember the very empty studio.\n\n3\n\nWe're so close now. But I'm going to be too busy tomorrow to watch any shows in the morning. I guess I'll have to keep refreshing the BBC website where they should hopefully have the announcements. How long after a celeb is announced on TV is it posted on the BBC website, especially if it's not on a BBC show?\n\n0\n\nAlso hope we don‚Äôt have any rubbish like ‚ÄúI hope this celeb actually knows what hard work is!!!‚Äù because victim blaming is still rife, particularly over on other channels.\n\nI was watching some old routines on TikTok earlier and almost every video posted recently had people saying ‚Äúwell that celeb knew what hard work is so did well‚Äù, instead of y‚Äôknow, considering they had a partner who didn‚Äôt verbally or physically abuse them, and having natural ability is also a bonus.\n\n8\n\nJordon North is set to be one of the named lineup for Strictly this year. Great promo and lot of practice dancing in between shows on Capital breakfast.\n\nRumoured line up\n\n1. ü™© Sam Quek\n\n2. ü™© Pete Wicks\n\n3. ü™© Nick Knowles\n\n4. ü™© Chris McLausland\n\n5. ü™© Tom Dean\n\n6. ü™© Shane Ward\n\n7. ü™© Jordan North\n\n8. ü™© Hannah Waddingham\n\n9. ü™© Jamie Borthwick\n\n10. ü™© Tasha Ghuri\n\n0\n\nThe only news around Jordan North and Strictly is he apparently said 5 days ago that he isn‚Äôt doing it:\n\n\"If I was on Strictly I would constantly look like I was constipated, it would be awful. And I'd be like, 1‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶3‚Ä¶4.. I can't dance. I'm honestly not doing it but no one will believe me anyway,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't dance for toffee, I have no rhythm, the only dance I can dance do, confidently, is a Cha-Cha-Slide. Because they tell you what to do. One hop this time‚Ä¶left right foot stomp, right foot left stomp.\"\n\n8\n\nWell, today is the day. I've got the Strictly Instagram page open on my phone so I can refresh it and see if anyone comes up. Is it usually 2 a day?\n\n2\n\nWell, today is the day. I've got the Strictly Instagram page open on my phone so I can refresh it and see if anyone comes up. Is it usually 2 a day?\n\nSome days have more, some days have less but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever usually over 3 a day.\n\nThis was the pattern looking back on last year:\n\nFriday 4th: Amanda, Angela R, Layton (3)\n\nSaturday 5th: Krishnan (1)\n\nSunday 6th: Eddie (1)\n\nMonday 7th: Angela S, Zara (2)\n\nTuesday 8th: Adam, Nikita (2)\n\nWednesday 9th: Ellie, Jody, Bobby (3)\n\nThursday 10th: Nigel, Annabel (2)\n\nFriday 11th: Les (1)\n\n3\n\nEmma Thompson does turn up on random shows just because she wants to\n\nShe was on my favourite sgow sorted food https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00uzzFkU6r8\n\nMind you Prince William pops up on that occassionally\n\nBest ever episode below, Jamie or Mike for Strictly\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW1YOwD1ueo\n\n1\n\nWell, today is the day. I've got the Strictly Instagram page open on my phone so I can refresh it and see if anyone comes up. Is it usually 2 a day?\n\nI'm guessing it'll probably be towards the end of This Morning.\n\nThis Morning, The One Show, radio programmes etc all usually do that to keep people watching/listening to the entire show.\n\n8"
