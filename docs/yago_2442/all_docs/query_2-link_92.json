He met the actress Emma Thompson on set and the couple were married in 2003. They have a daughter, Gaia, 15, and a grown-up son, Tindy, 28, whom they informally adopted when he was a 16-year-old.\n\nMarriage has taught me kindness. Kindness is more important and more powerful than intellect – often intellect is used as a weapon. Life would be so much more glorious if there were more kindness and less politicking and intellectualising."
