        "text": "Rom-com queen Emma Thompson isn’t sugarcoating the truth about love.\n\nThompson, who famously starred in the 2003 romantic comedy \"Love Actually\" alongside Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, opened up about her view on romance in an interview with the Radio Times Podcast published Tuesday.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress stars in the Shekhar Kapur romantic comedy \"What’s Love Got to Do with It?\" and said the film has reminded her of the unattainability of romantic love.\n\n\"It’s philosophically helpful and uplifting to remember that romantic love is a myth and quite dangerous,\" Thompson said. \"We really do have to take it with a massive pinch of salt: to think sensibly about love and the way it can grow is essential.\"\n\n'Matilda the Musical': How Darth Vader inspired Emma Thompson's 'shocking' Trunchbull\n\n'We said YES!': Rebel Wilson gets engaged to girlfriend Ramona Agruma in matching sweaters\n\nThompson is married to British actor and producer Greg Wise, who she wed in 2003. She was previously married to actor Kenneth Branagh from 1989-1995.\n\n\"Long-term relationships are hugely difficult and complicated,\" Thompson added. \"If anyone thinks that happy ever after has a place in our lives, forget it.\"\n\nThompson also spoke about the relatability of her 2022 movie \"What’s Love Got to Do with It?\" character, Cath, explaining that she symbolizes the struggles of aging.\n\n\"She’s so inappropriate! She’s got absolute cloth ears,\" Thompson said. \"She’s the sort of person who’ll say, 'The nice thing about a burka is it’s just wonderfully forgiving, isn’t it!' And you just groan.\n\n\"But I find myself saying something and my daughter will say, 'Mum, you actually can’t say that.' Cath represents all of us as we get older, because we’re always saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing.\"\n\n'Love Actually' director says film's 'lack of diversity' makes him feel 'uncomfortable'"
