Thompson and Wise met in 1997

British actress Emma Thompson has wed her long-time partner Greg Wise in a ceremony in Scotland.

The Oscar-winning star married fellow actor Wise at their home in Argyll, before going on to a reception at a nearby hotel.

Friends and family gathered for the ceremony on Tuesday, including the couple's three-year-old daughter Gaia, the paper added.

"This for me is heaven. It's been a wonderful day," Thompson said.

Thompson, 44, split from first husband Kenneth Branagh in 1994, after five years of marriage. He recently remarried in a secret ceremony.

Family time

Wise, 37, met Thompson in 1995 when they starred together in Sense and Sensibility, the movie adaptation of Jane Austen's book which also won Thompson a best screenwriting Oscar.

He went on to star in Mad Cows and spy spoof Johnny English.

After putting her acting career on hold to start a family, Thompson recently starred in the TV drama Wit, playing a woman dying of cancer.

Her upcoming projects include a role in Richard Curtis' Love Actually and the TV mini-series Angels in America.

She has also become more involved in campaigning projects, recently criticising Western governments for ignoring the plight of Aids in Africa, on behalf of UK charity ActionAid.
