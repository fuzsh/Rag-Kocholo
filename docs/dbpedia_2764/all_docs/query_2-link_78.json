        "text": "Amy Ignatowski Memorial Award applicants must be an active U.S. Coast Guard member, Coast Guard Reservist or their dependents from USCG Sector Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, accepted as a student in any course of study at Lake Superior State University, with a GPA of 2.0 or higher. Active-duty Coast Guard members must have completed a minimum of six months of military service and reservists must be in drilling status.\n\nApplication deadline is Monday, August 8, 2022.\n\nAmy Ignatowski\n\nThose who knew Amy Ignatowski knew a young lady with a very outgoing personality. She wore a perpetual smile that could light up a room, and loved to share her positive attitude. She had many life-long friendships and made new friends everywhere she went. Amy thought friendship to be very important, and had the utmost loyalty toward her friends, among whom she counted the many men and women with whom she served in the United States Coast Guard.\n\nAmy believed in self-improvement. She loved exercising both mind and body and setting new challenges and goals for herself. She worked out almost every day and was a voracious reader of books. She loved listening to music and going to concerts. She enjoyed many outdoor activities, among them hiking, snowboarding, swimming, fishing and kayaking.\n\nHaving grown up in Sault Ste. Marie, Lake Superior State University was a natural choice for her and she attended classes there and was a member of Alpha Theta Omega sorority before her enlistment in the Coast Guard. She was attracted to the Coast Guard’s lifesaving mission, and their can-do attitude made the service a perfect fit for her.\n\nAmy’s assignments included WAGB-11 Polar Sea, aboard which she crossed the Arctic Circle, earning her “Blue Nose” certificate. She served briefly at USCG Air Station Humboldt Bay before attending aviation school at Elizabeth City, N.C., for Aircraft Maintenance Technician training. She graduated with excellent scores and another group of friends.\n\nA warm climate and her desire to fly in the HH-65 helicopter influenced her choice of Corpus Christi for her first air station assignment as an aviation maintenance technician (AMT). She was working on earning her wings at the time of her death in May of 2008.\n\nAir Station Corpus Christi Command saw fit to award Amy her wings posthumously, giving her the title of Petty Officer Amy Lynn Ignatowski, AMT3."
