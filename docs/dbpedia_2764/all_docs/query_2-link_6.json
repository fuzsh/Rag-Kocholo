        "text": "Hydrogen is an important energy carrier that can play a key role in reducing carbon emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and aviation, heating and distributed power, and industrial applications like steelmaking, glassmaking and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThere is growing interest around wider adoption of hydrogen and its potential economic and environmental benefits, and so the University of Michigan has launched a new initiative to support and catalyze multidisciplinary research involving the universe’s lightest and most abundant element.\n\nMI Hydrogen, a joint venture by the Office of the Vice President for Research, Michigan Engineering and the School for Environment and Sustainability, will foster collaboration among U-M researchers, community groups, government and industry partners so they can address existing knowledge gaps and develop strategies to help society transition toward an energy future that is equitable, affordable, clean and secure. The initiative, which will engage faculty across disciplines, is designed to provide the leading research necessary to accelerate the use of hydrogen beyond current industrial limits.\n\nMI Hydrogen is part of the newly launched Institute for Energy Solutions, which is supported by Michigan Engineering and the Office of the Vice President for Research. Professors Todd Allen and Greg Keoleian, who have extensive research experience in fields ranging from nuclear engineering to sustainable systems, will serve as co-directors for MI Hydrogen.\n\nAllen and Keoleian recently convened a series of visioning sessions with faculty engaged in the hydrogen space to solicit feedback regarding ways in which U-M can help accelerate clean and just energy transitions. The initiative builds upon the Hydrogen Roadmap for the State of Michigan Workshop hosted last spring at U-M, which brought together stakeholders from academia, industry and government, and led to a report published by the Center for Sustainable Systems, a lead collaborator of MI Hydrogen.\n\nBased on community input around the proposed design and direction for the initiative, MI Hydrogen will launch with a set of new research projects focused on transportation and industrial applications. Hydrogen is primarily used nowadays in the chemical and petroleum refining industries.\n\nTeams also will analyze the potential statewide demand for hydrogen, and develop a framework for hydrogen ecosystem planning and implementation. A majority of hydrogen production in the United States and abroad is generated from steam methane reforming of natural gas, which is problematic from a climate change perspective.\n\nThe potential for hydrogen to serve as a clean, economical energy carrier has generated increased momentum federally, highlighted by a recent commitment from the Department of Energy to invest $7 billion toward the creation of six to 10 regional hubs designed to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen across the U.S.\n\nAndré Boehman joined the University of Michigan Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2012, after serving for 18 years at the Pennsylvania State University. He also currently serves as the director of the renowned Walter E. Lay Automotive Engineering Laboratory, conducting automotive research centered around engine, battery, powertrain and vehicle autonomy.\n\nIn 2023, Boehman was appointed the Vennema Professor of Engineering, an endowed professorship supporting scholars whose work will impact the technologies of tomorrow. With over 26 years of experience in hydrogen research, Boehman has been lending his expertise to the MI Hydrogen initiative since its inception.\n\nBoehman’s interest in automotive emissions control began in childhood while helping his father (a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Dayton) to do tailpipe exhaust measurements as a public service in the early 1970’s. As a graduate student at Stanford University and postdoc at SRI International, Boehman studied heat and mass transfer issues in automotive catalytic converters. In 1994, he joined the Fuel Science Program at Penn State, focusing on fuel processing catalysis, coal-based jet fuel formulation, diesel combustion, diesel emissions, diesel emissions control and alternative fuels.\n\nEarly in his career at Penn State, he began collaborating with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., prominent for its work in the widespread generation and distribution of hydrogen. Air Products’ interest in the production of synthetic fuels led to multiple collaborations with Boehman, including the conversion of a Penn State campus shuttle bus to operate on dimethyl ether. In addition, the collaboration with Air Products led to research on the application of hydrogen in internal combustion engines.\n\nThroughout his career, his work has maintained a consistent theme of alternative and reformulated fuels, and combustion and pollution control. When the MI Hydrogen initiative launched, Boehman was eager to get involved.\n\nKey objectives of MI Hydrogen include determining how to generate hydrogen and how to best use it. Boehman’s group concentrates on uncovering the most impactful ways to use hydrogen to produce fuel, as well as to determine how hydrogen can work in concert with other fuels to operate an engine. The innovative work led by Boehman greatly contributes to the MI Hydrogen initiative and the U-M research community.\n\nTopical Areas of Interest: combustion, emissions, emissions control, renewable fuels, alternative fuels\n\nBoehman holds a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Dayton (1986) and an M.S. (1987) and Ph.D. (1993) in mechanical engineering from Stanford University. He held a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in the Molecular Physics Laboratory at SRI International, in Menlo Park, CA. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers (2012), of the American Chemical Society (2019), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (2019) and a Fellow of the Combustion Institute (2022). He has been awarded the John Johnson Award for Outstanding Research in Diesel Engines, the Arch T. Colwell Merit Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers, the Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Dayton School of Engineering (1999), and the Internal Combustion Engines Award (2020) and the Charles T. Main Bronze Medal(1986) from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nA native of the Azores, Portugal, Joaquim R. R. A. Martins has always had an interest in aircraft. It was this interest that led him to pursue a degree in aeronautics at the Imperial College in London. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University where he developed a more specialized interest in aircraft design optimization.\n\n“Aviation makes the world go around,” said Martins. “It is the only way to move something or someone across the world in a day or less. It connects people, and it plays a crucial role in the economy.”\n\nIn 2002 Martins joined the University of Toronto as an associate professor. It was there that he founded the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Laboratory (MDO Lab) research group, specializing in optimizing complex engineering systems across various disciplines to advance the design process of aerospace vehicles and other high-performance structures. Since then, he has directed his aircraft design optimization efforts toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions caused by aviation.\n\nMartins began his appointment at the University of Michigan in 2009, serving as a Pauline M. Sherman Collegiate Professor of Aerospace Engineering with a courtesy appointment in Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering. He also continues to lead the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Laboratory.\n\nToday, Martins is a leading researcher in computational methods for the design optimization of engineering systems. His innovative methods have been applied to the design of aircraft, wind turbines, hydrofoils, cars and satellites.\n\nFor over a decade, he has collaborated on projects with NASA, including in the development of OpenMDAO, an open-source platform for high-performance systems analysis and multidisciplinary optimization. The system can quickly improve the design of complex engineering systems, including aircraft and their systems.\n\nAs hydrogen research gained momentum with increased interest, Martins teamed up with his students to write a review on hydrogen-powered aircraft, exploring a range of concepts, technologies and their environmental impacts. In place of conventional fuels like kerosene, they have redesigned engines to use hydrogen and are exploring ways to use hydrogen in fuel cells for electrification.\n\nMartins notes that since the 1960s, great strides have been made to decrease the fuel burn in aircraft. However, after exhausting the incremental improvements, the rate of progress has plateaued. “Now,” he submits, “it’s time for something else. And I think that something else is hydrogen.”\n\nTopical Areas of Interest: aircraft fuel burn​\n\nMartins obtained an MEng in aeronautics (1995) from Imperial College (UK), and an M.Sc. (1997) and Ph.D. (2002) in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He was a Visiting Professor at ISAE–SUPAERO, Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France in 2015-2016 under a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship. He was a US–Norway Fulbright recipient in 1996–1997 and received the British Aerospace Award in 1995. He has served as Associate Editor for the AIAA Journal, Optimization and Engineering, and Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization. He is currently an Associate Editor for the Journal of Aircraft.\n\nZetian Mi joined the University of Michigan as a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in 2016 after nearly ten years as a professor at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Mi’s research focuses on semiconductor nanotechnology and its applications in electronic, photonic, clean energy and quantum devices and systems.\n\nA key milestone in Mi’s career occurred when he took part as a scientific director in the ERA Grand Challenge Award. Using artificial photosynthesis and solar hydrogen technology, Mi’s team won both the first and second rounds of the $35-million global competition. The competition’s aim was to develop innovative carbon reducing solutions, and strategies to transform carbon dioxide from a liability to an asset. Mi’s achievement laid the groundwork for his work with MI Hydrogen.\n\nBuilding on his use of artificial photosynthesis and solar hydrogen technology, Mi has developed a semiconductor that not only resists high-temperature degradation but is also orders of magnitude smaller and significantly less costly than some previous options. Using this technology in solar panels allows Mi’s team to extract hydrogen from water more efficiently than natural photosynthesis. The process employs a catalyst made of indium gallium nitride nanostructures that, when exposed to sunlight and heat, speeds up the water-splitting process and encourages the hydrogen and oxygen to remain separate. This technology allows the team to harvest hydrogen more economically and with greater efficiency.\n\nMi was the director of the Blue Sky Initiative, established by the College of Engineering to support high-risk, high-reward ideas such as hydrogen generation. To bring his discoveries to market, Mi co-founded NS Nanotech, Inc. and NX Fuels, Inc. Notably, NS Nanotech launched the world’s first solid-state far-UVC chip, which emits short-wavelength UV light to neutralize Coronavirus. This product was named as one of the top ten in 2020 by Electronic Products.\n\nReflecting on the significance of the MI Hydrogen initiative, Mi said, “This is a great investment by the university and by the community because this is a very important area not only today, but in the next several decades. It will continue to provide a great platform for our university colleagues to work together and is a vehicle to reimagine the industry.”\n\nTopical Areas of Interest: semiconductors, hydrogen production\n\nZeitian Mi holds a Ph.D. in applied physics from the University of Michigan (2006). Mi is a Fellow of IEEE, APS, Optica,and SPIE. He received a Young Scientist Award from the International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors, a Young Investigator Award from the 27th North American Molecular Beam Epitaxy Conference, a Distinguished Lecturer Award from IEEE Photonics Society, and a Distinguished Lecturer Award from IEEE Nanotechnology Council. He received the David E. Liddle Research Excellence Award in 2021, the EECS Outstanding Achievement Award in 2024, and the Rexford E. Hall Innovation Excellence Award in 2024.\n\nTim Wallington joined the University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems (CSS) in the School for Environment and Sustainability in 2023 after 35 years at the Ford Motor Company, where he led the Environmental Science Group.\n\nWallington’s research interests at CSS focus on the use of life cycle assessments to examine the sustainability of global transportation, including energy use and emissions, air quality and climate change impacts, and material availability and flows. His work within MI Hydrogen is aimed at addressing the question of where hydrogen might be used to power future sustainable ground, water and air transportation either directly, or indirectly in synthetic fuels.\n\n“This is a complex question which needs a systems thinking approach,” said Wallington. “We must ask where the hydrogen comes from and what environmental and social impacts and financial costs are associated with obtaining it, distributing it and using it in transportation. At the point of use in a fuel cell, hydrogen only emits water and so it has zero impact. However there may be substantial impacts upstream of the point of use.”\n\nIn his research, Wallington stresses the importance of each of the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social and economic. For hydrogen to play a future role in transportation it will need to be not only environmentally and socially acceptable, but also economically viable.\n\n“It is hard to overstate the importance of the recent economic policy support for hydrogen”, he noted. New policies have been enacted in the U.S. and EU to incentivize the production of clean hydrogen, providing generous financial support for clean hydrogen production over the next decade and an opportunity for the decarbonization of transportation sectors such as heavy-duty road, marine and aviation that are hard to electrify.\n\nOriginally from Northampton, England, Wallington came to the United States to conduct postgraduate research at the University of California-Riverside Statewide Air Pollution Research Center in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, he moved to the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington, D.C. before joining the Scientific Research Laboratories at Ford Motor Company in 1987. Wallington’s early experiences with environmental sciences opened his eyes to the opportunities in the field.\n\n“Given its benefits in terms of lower emissions and the generous financial policy support available there’s a lot of interest in the use of hydrogen as a future transportation fuel,” said Wallington. “The MI Hydrogen team is working to understand just how that future might evolve.”\n\nTopical Areas of Interest: Life cycle assessments, hydrogen, electric vehicles, climate change, atmospheric chemistry\n\nWallington holds a B.A. (Chemistry, 1981), Ph.D. (Atmospheric Chemistry ,1983), and D.Sc. (Atmospheric Chemistry, 2007) from Oxford University.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Department of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) has formulated a Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program which includes up to $7 billion to establish seven regional clean hydrogen hubs across America. As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the H2Hubs will form the foundation of a national clean hydrogen network that will contribute substantially to decarbonizing multiple sectors of the economy including heavy industries and heavy-duty transportation. The Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2) with proposed activities in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois is one of the seven hubs invited to enter negotiations with the DOE. This presentation will give an overview of the H2 Hubs program and envisioned activities of MachH2.\n\nBio:\n\nNeil Banwart, CFA\n\nChief Integration Officer, MachH2\n\nAs Chief Integration Officer, Neil Banwart’s responsibilities include ensuring MachH2 maximizes all sources of funding and also working to continually expand the reach and impact of MachH2. In conjunction with the CEO, he also represents MachH2 in public facing matters such as media interviews, on panels, and at tradeshows.\n\nNeil also serves as Managing Director-Hydrogen at Energy Systems Network (ESN). Prior to ESN, he spent nearly a decade at Cummins Inc. He has held several M&A, Treasury, and finance roles in his career, including service as the CFO of a small private equity fund. Neil earned a Bachelor’s in Finance from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an MBA from Bradley University. He is a CFA Charterholder and serves on the Board of Directors of the CFA Society of Indianapolis as the immediate past president.\n\nRecent federal investments in hydrogen are intended to significantly accelerate timelines for the deployment of hydrogen technologies. States, in response, are working to align with stakeholders, establish individual strategies, and determine what this rapidly developing industry means for their residents and economies. Michigan, as a selectee for a Regional Clean Hydrogen hub, a leading member of the 7-state Midwest Hydrogen Coalition, and having recently secured significant investments from leading companies in the hydrogen supply chain, is well positioned to be a leader in the development of a national hydrogen economy. In this session, representatives from the Michigan Infrastructure Office will discuss the broad vision for hydrogen in Michigan, key projects and investments underway, and the challenges and opportunities facing the Great Lakes State.\n\nZachary Kolodin serves as Chief Infrastructure Officer and Director of the Michigan Infrastructure Office.
