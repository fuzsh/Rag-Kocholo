        "text": "School-based Health Center\n\nServices are available during school hours and open to students ages 5-21. This allows for consistent, convenient and carefree medical services-including everything from sports physicals and well-child visits to treatment of illness, injuries or chronic conditions to counseling and health education. This approach helps to ensure the best care possible for the students-right in their school.\n\nIndividuals without insurance will have access to a sliding fee scale based on income. The staff at the School-Based Health Center is also able to sign students up for both MiChild and Healthy Kids if they are uninsured.\n\nHow Do I Get Services?\n\nParental consent required for all services (except Adolescent Confidential Health Services as per Michigan law).\n\nWalk-ins are welcome\n\nStudents or parents may call and make appointments\n\nStudents also have an opportunity to be involved with their School-Based Health Center through the Teen Advisory Council which is established at Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy. Some of the activities include: participating in awareness campaigns on the issues of teen sexual health, pregnancy prevention, dating violence prevention, etc.; going to Lansing annually to participate in “Advocacy Day” for school-based health centers across Michigan; and by participating in community events to promote their health center and encourage people to enroll their students."
