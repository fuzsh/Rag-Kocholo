        "text": "Considered one of America’s most significant designers, Ann Lowe was born in Clayton, Alabama, around 1898 and reared in Montgomery.\n\nHer mother, Janie Cole Lowe, and her grandmother, Georgia Thompkins, were skilled dressmakers who sewed for wealthy white families in the state. And they taught Lowe to sew as early as age five. By the time Lowe was six, she had developed a fondness for using scraps of fabric to make small decorative flowers patterned after the flowers she saw in the family’s garden. This childhood pastime would later become the signature feature on many of her dresses and gowns. By age 10, she made her own dress patterns.\n\nBased on the extensive scholarship of Margaret Powell, there are numerous inconsistencies related to Lowe’s early life, including her actual year of birth, age at the time of her first marriage, and whether she was widowed when she left Alabama for Florida. Powell writes that Lowe indicated she dropped out of school at 14 to marry. In the same document, Powell cites U. S. Census records indicating that Lowe was “living in Dothan, Alabama, with her first husband, Lee Cone, in 1910.” Based on the 1898 date of birth, she would have been 12 years old at the time of her marriage. In a 1964 Saturday Evening Post article, the reporter noted that Lowe married a man 10 years her senior shortly after her mother died in 1914, when Lowe would have been 16 or 17 years old. Lowe’s son and later business partner, Arthur Lee Cone, was born a year after she married.\n\nLowe’s mother’s death was unexpected. At the time, her mother was working on four dresses for a New Year’s Eve ball, at least one of which belonged to the first lady of Alabama. Lowe’s successful completion of the gowns helped establish her as a skilled dressmaker in the state.\n\nIn 1916, a chance encounter in a department store with influential Tampa socialite Josephine Edwards Lee changed Lowe’s life. Mrs. Lee observed that Lowe’s outfit was fashionable and exceptionally well-made. Lowe informed her that she made the ensemble, which prompted Lee to invite Lowe to Florida (as a live-in dressmaker) to make the bridal gowns and trousseau for her twin daughters. After discussing the offer with her husband, who wanted her to remain a housewife, Lowe accepted the offer and moved with her son to the Lee family estate at Lake Thonotosassa in Tampa. She later described the opportunity as “. . . a chance to make all the lovely gowns I’d always dreamed of.” In Tampa, she developed a list of loyal clients and supporters.\n\nWhile reading a fashion magazine, Lowe, who was eager to enhance her skills, learned about the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York City. With Mrs. Lee’s encouragement, she applied for admission and was accepted.\n\nIn April 1917, Lowe left Tampa for New York. When she arrived at the S.T. Taylor School of Design, she was shunned by the school’s director because of her race. He allowed her to attend the school, but segregated her in another classroom because her classmates refused to be in the same space with an African American. The sad irony was that Lowe’s design abilities were far superior to her classmates, and her creations were used as models of exceptional work for the other students. Due to Lowe’s advanced skill and ability, she successfully completed the program in half the required time, though accounts differ on the program’s length.\n\nLowe worked briefly in New York before returning to Tampa. According to Powell, there are more incongruities about what she did during this period. In 1966, the Oakland Tribune quoted Lowe as saying she “. . . worked as a finisher in a Manhattan dress shop for several months.” A Sepia magazine article in the same year reported that she made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a dress shop in New York after finishing design school.\n\nLowe returned to Tampa at a time when there were growing demands for ball gowns, cotillion wear, and other formal attire. To respond to those needs, she hired and trained 18 seamstresses and opened her own shop, the Annie Cone boutique.\n\nAround 1920, Lowe married Caleb West, her second and last marriage. A hotel bellhop and day laborer, West and Lowe were officially married until 1942. Although initially supportive of her work, agreeing to establish her shop at their home at 1514 Jefferson St. in Tampa and moving to New York with her in 1928, the difficulties of being a successful dressmaker eventually took a toll on their marriage.\n\nGasparilla Celebrations, 1924–1929, 1957\n\nBeginning in 1904, the city of Tampa organized numerous festive events named for 18th century pirate Joseˊ Gaspar. These annual celebrations were major social affairs, and each attendee wanted a lavish one-of-a-kind dress to wear. From 1924 to 1929, dressing the elite women who attended the Gasparilla balls was a primary source of creative expression for Lowe. According to information on the Plant Museum website, Lowe designed at least one dress for the Gasparilla festivities in 1957. This suggests she maintained her connections to the Gasparilla events long after she moved to New York.\n\nNew York, 1928–1972\n\nLowe long aspired to establish her own salon in New York, where she could make beautiful, custom gowns for women listed on the Social Registry. She left Tampa to pursue that dream. She also had $20,000 in seed money, an impressive amount of money for the time. During various interviews, she implied that the money was either from her personal savings, the Lees and a few of their friends, or a loan from Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc., an African American fraternity. It was quite possible that her savings were a combination of all those sources.\n\nIn 1928, Lowe closed the Annie Cone boutique and permanently moved to New York, where she continued to design for elite women and their families. Over the course of her life, she operated several shops in New York, including Ann Lowe Inc. at 667 Madison Ave. during the late 1940s and early 1950s; Ann Lowe Gowns at 973 Lexington Ave. in 1955; A.F. Chantilly Inc. at 558 Madison Ave. in 1965; and Ann Lowe Originals in Manhattan on Madison Avenue in 1968 until she retired in 1972. The Madison Avenue locations solidified Lowe as the first African American to have a shop on the famed fashion retail strip, and it attested to her significance as an American couturier of note.\n\nWork for Other Design Houses\n\nWhen Lowe arrived in New York, she rented a workspace at West 46th Street, where she struggled to cultivate patrons. By 1929, she had exhausted her funds. At the same time, the American stock market crashed, plunging the country into the Great Depression which lasted for 10 years. Coupled with her personal financial losses and the national disaster, Lowe was forced to work for other fashion houses, including Hattie Carnegie, Sonia Gowns, Inc., and Chez Sonia. Through those connections, she met affluent clients who were members of the Social Registry and who appreciated her unique designs and the fine quality of her craftsmanship.\n\nAcademy Award-Winning Design, 1947\n\nIn 1946, when Olivia de Havilland accepted the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie To Each His Own, she wore a hand-painted floral Ann Lowe original design. At the time, Lowe was working for Sonia Gowns, Inc., and that fashion house was given high praise for the gown.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lowe made several trips to Paris fashion shows, not as a designer but as a guest fashion reporter for The New York Age, an African American newspaper. She recounted one instance in which Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, a client, introduced her as “Miss Lowe, head of the American house of Ann Lowe.” At the time, she was operating Ann Lowe Gowns on Lexington Avenue.\n\nIn 1957, for the launch of their Great Lady perfume, the Evyan perfume house commissioned several designers, including Lowe, to duplicate 29 inaugural gowns of the American first ladies in miniature form. She created six sets of inaugural gowns based on the originals, which are on exhibit in the First Ladies’ Hall at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nWhile there were many highs during this period, there were an equal number of lows for Lowe. In 1958, her son was killed in a car accident. The tragic loss marked a general decline in her financial stability, her health, and eventually her career. There was no evidence that she hired an accountant or financial adviser after her son’s death. And the eyesight in her right eye continued deteriorating as a result of glaucoma. Mounting tax debts forced her to close her business in 1960.\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue, The Adam Room, 1960–1962\n\nIn 1960, Saks Fifth Avenue was one of the leading American luxury department stores specializing in debutante and wedding gowns for elite women in the country. In 1956, Saks dedicated a space for exclusive services for these customers. Mrs. Edward Ewen Conner, the founding manager, named the space The Adam Room, in honor of Adam Gimbel, the head of Saks.\n\nShortly after Lowe closed her salon, Saks invited her to work in The Adam Room. The offer, a prestigious affiliation for Lowe, came with some fanfare. Saks’s official ad, with a silhouette of Ann Lowe, publicized the business arrangement, declaring, “Saks Fifth Avenue takes pride in announcing that the Debut and Bridal Gown Collection created by Ann Lowe can now be found exclusively in The Adam Room.”\n\nThe contract was extremely uneven and not to Lowe’s advantage. In exchange for a workroom, she brought with her a coveted list of select clients. She had to purchase her own supplies and fabrics, which were of the highest quality, and she had to pay her staff. Saks set the final sale prices for the garments. Ultimately, Lowe was paid significantly less than the labor and materials she put into the dresses. By the time she realized the extent of her losses, she was deep in debt. In 1962, she left Saks and opened a small workshop on 53rd Street.\n\nCommissioned for Balls and Coronations, 1961–1962\n\nDuring her tenure at Saks, Lowe designed gowns for several major balls and coronations across the country. The Texas Rose Festival and the Nebraska Ak-Sar-Ben Coronation Ball were two of the most outstanding.\n\nThe Texas Rose Festival, Tyler, Texas, 1961 and 1962\n\nTyler, Texas, was considered the “Rose Capital” of America because the flower was a staple of the community. The first Tyler Rose Festival was organized by the Tyler Garden Club in 1933 to celebrate the rose industry in the area. Three years later, the annual festivities were renamed the Texas Rose Festival.\n\nIn 1961, Lousanne (Orr) Wise was chosen as the Texas Rose Festival Queen. Her gown and train were created by Lowe."
