        "text": "Contributed by Jerome & Eileen Norris of Rydal Lodge to whom the extracts were sent.\n\nRydal Â Lodge Â Entries\n\nBackgroundArthur Maclver, b, 1905 & in 1925 a classics student at Oxford lived in Blrkenhead and during Oxford holidays. at Rydal Lodge with has mother Florence. Â His father Andrew had been killed in the First World War and his only sibling, âJohnâ had dled aged 5. Â\n\nThey stayed at Rydal until Florence bought Brown How, on Coniston in 1939.Â\n\nLater in the period covered by the diaries. Arthur had various university teaching posts.Â\n\n(He eventually became Professor of Philosophy at Southampton)\n\nChristmas 1925\n\n23rd.Â Â (December) At last at Rydal Lodge and for the first time since I began to keepÂ this diary nearly three months ago in one of our own houses!... (He had spent theÂ time at Oxford and at Wanlass because his mother was looking after her dyingÂ father Arthur Crosthwaite, in Llverpool.)\n\n24th.Â Â ....The snow was thick on the ground and as every now and then during theÂ morning it began to fall again we kept thinking of poor Uncle (Tinley CrosthwaiteÂ who was coming with his family from Liverpool for Christmas)â¦ we went to the villageÂ and spent a very long time shopping... In the afternoon we went to Grasmere to MissÂ Reads being the only good bookshop in the neighbourhood and bought a PocketÂ Oxford Dictionary for Uncle Tinley and the second series âPoems of To-dayâ as aÂ stop-gap present for Mummy. Then we returned and waited for the family, meanwhileÂ sawing two coconuts for the tits; by five oâclock no one had arrived, so we had tea;Â then they telephoned that they were having tea at Riggâs all but Wendy and EvelynÂ who had come up by train and gone on by peril (the nickname for the bus which wasÂ yellow); ultimately they all arrived and before dinner we garaged Tanny (Uncles car)Â in the Party [?] he going up the snow-clad hill without a murmur..\n\n25th. Â (Christmas Day)Â 'twas very fortunately determined last night that only MummyÂ should go ...to the early service at Wray this morning it was therefore possible for theÂ rest of us to sleep peacefully and rise late. Â The snow lay all over the ground asÂ before but had frozen harder in the night. Â Breakfast was pandemonium - foodÂ shouts parcels and paper all over the room and especially the breakfast table for myÂ own part I had received âBiography for Beginnersâ from Auntie Dums and began atÂ once to read most of itâ¦ Then at last we made ready and went to church... At theÂ dismissal of the catechumens Mummy and the children went out and home in JaneÂ (Florries car) calling at Wanlass for toboggans; I remained with Uncle Tinley andÂ Auntie Gwen for the communion. When we returned they were all toboganning onÂ the father side of the foot-bridge. Â After lunch they went out again Â we watchedÂ them for a while, then for a walk (of all minus the children) along the side of the lakeÂ onto Loughrigg Terrace the snow all the way was quite deep but very light andÂ feathery. Â Then tea. Afterwards made some attempt (hardly successful) to readÂ Cicero. Â For dinner we all wore masks and there was much noise; I note that I have aÂ distinct penchant for turkey though I see little merit in trifle or plum-pudding at theÂ end I had to go masked into the kitchen with the trifle and found a young man there,Â so procured him a mask as also the others, but whether he wore it I do not know.\n\nAlter dinner we tried first to play âSpelkaâ (a word-making game) then relapsed intoÂ âNoahs Arkâ; much noise ending when the family went to bed at ten..\n\n26th.Â It had thawed on the night and during the morning it drizzled softly turningÂ yesterdays white feathery snow into a most abominable slush. Meanwhile I played aÂ little ping-pong with the children and also read a little Cicero. In the afternoon I wentÂ for a walk with Uncle Tinley, Auntie Gwen and Wendy along the same path asÂ yesterday but across a very different surface; all the then white snow was a grey soupÂ and at one point (by the lake) the path had become a running river; neverthelessthere was still some ice left both on Rydal and on the waterfalls at Red Bank end ofÂ Loughrlgg Terrace. Â It was wet enough for it to be quite necessary on returning toÂ change my stockings. Â And then, after tea, there was a family ping-pong tournament n(handicap) won by Peter, my game going to pieces in the final. Â Alter dinner we hadÂ âcards - first âNoahs Arkâ and then somewhat uproarious âSpelkaâ of which we haveÂ at last mastered the rulesâ¦\n\nNew Year 1930\n\nJanuary 1st Â Â Â ..We are now at Rydal where we have had a wild wet windy Christmas, rather piano in this house (but I went for my Christmas lunch to Wanlass) because on the 23rd Mummy fell over the laundry-basket in the bicycle room in the dark, giving herself a very nasty bruise on the left temple and a headache.\n\nSeptember 1931 - visit by Paul Robeson\n\nSeptember 3rdÂ Paul Robeson came to sing at Kendal and we went to hear him;Â Mummy on the strength of one meeting at the Ravens, wrote beforehand and invitedÂ him to lunch with us and (to our surprise) he accepted and came the next day andÂ stayed to tea, after which Mummy took him in the car to Keswick where he wasÂ singing again that evening - a damned intelligent man"
