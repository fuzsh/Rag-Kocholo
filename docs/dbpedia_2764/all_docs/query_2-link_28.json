        "text": "Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL)\n\nThe central academic service unit that provides programming, resources, and support for graduate students’ and post-docs’ development as educators.\n\nQueen's University Library\n\nThe Queen's University Library offers a number of resources for graduate students. The Helen Howard Graduate Students Reading Room on the third floor of Stauffer Library offers graduate students a quiet place for individual or group study. There are also two smaller rooms which are available to reserve in advance. Access is provided through the School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs.\n\nEach academic department or research area at Queen’s is supported by a liaison librarian who can provide expert knowledge and guidance on the research literature in your area. Our librarians offer appointments for personalized in-depth consultations. History's liaison is Elizabeth Gibson.\n\nThe Library has also developed History Research Guide, a resource that includes information on how to find books, journal articles, and background information. If you work in the pre-modern period, you may also find the Classics Research Guide useful.\n\nSee Resources for Graduate Students in History for more information.\n\nSchool of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs (SGSPA)\n\nSGSPA is home to a wealth of academic resources for graduate students at Queen's University.\n\nNotably, the SGSPA regularly organizes Writing Camps, including Dissertation Bootcamp, Dissertation on the Lake, and Lake Shift, and PA Day Writing Circles, to help graduate students make writing progress and provides opportunities to share your research through Grad Chat, a weekly radio show on CFRC 101.9 FM, the Three-Minute Thesis Competition (3MT), Indigenous Research Collaboration Day, the Research Showcase, and GRADflix.\n\nThe SGSPA has also compiled a list of research resources on such topics as research ethics, Indigenous research ethics, library resources, academic integrity, and intellectual property.\n\nIn 2023, SGSPA launched the Queen's Public Scholarship Program, a new initiative for graduate students interested in public scholarship and community engagement. Through a series of specially designed workshops and activities, students will develop and refine their skills as socially engaged, responsive scholars and community members. Students new to public scholarship or students whose research already reflects public scholarship are welcome to participate in the program.\n\nThere are two streams for engagement. Stream 1 is open to all graduate students. Programming will consist of a series of workshops and activities designed to support students whose research already qualifies as public scholarship as well as those students who are simply interested in learning to develop these skills. Students who complete a requisite number of workshops and activities will receive a Public Scholars Program Certificate of Completion. Stream 2 will identify 8 inaugural Public Scholarship Fellows through an application process, who will receive a $5,000 fellowship to engage in public scholarship activities through the year affiliated with their existing research. They will participate in monthly workshops and activities along with Stream 1 students, but also obtain additional training and receive 1:1 mentorship from a faculty member skilled in public scholarship. Each scholar will be expected to produce a brief final outcomes report (2 pages max) that describes their work over the course of the fellowship and reflects on their learning.\n\nStudent Academic Success Services (SASS)\n\nSASS provides academic skills and writing support to Queen’s students at every level.

With the benefit of a fresh, interdisciplinary, analytical approach, the organization may receive the help needed to move forward in a positive way. Each team will be assigned a mentor who will provide guidance and advice about working as a team, managing a project, and working with partners.\n\nThe PhD-Community Initiative provides PhD students with an exceptional interdisciplinary, experiential learning opportunity that requires the application and translation of skills and knowledge gained in graduate training to address a problem outside of their area of research or scholarship.\n\nQueen’s Public Scholarship Program (QPSP)\n\nSGSPA has launched the Queen's Public Scholarship Program (QPSP), a new initiative in 2023-24 to support graduate students whose research is intended to directly impact local, national, and global communities.

The first stream will consist of a series of workshops and activities designed to support students whose research already qualifies as public scholarship. Graduate students who are simply interested in public scholarship and/or want to develop new skills are also welcome to participate. Students who complete six workshops/activities will receive a Public Scholarship Program Certificate of Completion. The second stream will identify eight inaugural Queen’s Public Scholarship Fellows. These graduate students will receive a $5,000 fellowship to engage in public scholarship activities affiliated with their existing research over the 2023-24 academic year. Fellows will participate in monthly workshops, obtain additional training, and receive one-on-one mentorship. Applications to stream two will be accepted between June 12, 2023 and July 26, 2023.\n\nQueen's Work Study Program\n\nBased on financial need, Queen's Work Study program provides eligible students the opportunity to receive priority for certain part-time positions during a specified period of study.
