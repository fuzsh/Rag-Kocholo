        "text": "Studying at Arthur Lakes Library\n\nThe college experience may involve way more than just academics, but at the end of the day, you need to buckle down and get some work done. And with Arthur Lakes Library nestled right in the heart of campus, you can be sure to find the perfect spot to study—whether on your own or with a group of friends. With librarians eager to share their knowledge and a whole host of resources to help you with your latest project, the library is the perfectspot on campus when you need to focus on your classwork. Did we mention there’s also a coffee shop readily available for when you need an extra shot of espresso to get through that last bit of homework?\n\n“I spent a lot of time in the library during freshman and sophomore years. It is a great place to stay focused for multiple hours, and there are lots of little nooks so you can have your own space. There is also usually a group studying for a class that you are taking as well, and it is easy to jump into a review session there. Something about being in the library makes you feel more productive and excited to dive into your course material. Being around other students who are studying very intensely makes you want to work that much harder.”\n\n“The Arthur Lakes Library has become a staple study spot for me in my time at Mines. I love the fact that there are so many whiteboards to work problems out, and there are opportunities for solo studying in quiet spaces on the upper floors but also a lot of spaces for studying with friends. Additionally, there are so many resources in the library, including the CASA tutoring center, the computers, the campus database and so much more. There is also Book and Brew coffee shop, so when you need that extra boost, they have you covered!”\n\n“I think the library is a great place to study. It’s huge and provides spaces for both individual study time as well as group work. I’d also recommend checking out the map room on one of the lower levels. It’s a giant room full of every map you can imagine, and there’s also an interactive sand pit that can be used to create topographical maps.”\n\n“The Arthur Lakes Library is my favorite place on campus. I know most of the people working there on a first-name basis, and Book n’ Brew is the BEST coffee shop on campus! Even if you don’t like coffee, try the London Fog—it’ll change your life!”\n\n“Studying at the library can be extremely helpful for focus because it gets you out of your house. I recommend having a coffee and a friend and heading to the library especially during finals week or when you feel like you have a lot of assignments due.”\n\n“Studying at the Arthur Lakes Library can be fun. There’s the design room in the back of the library that isreally nice if you’re trying to get a group project done. There’s also plenty of resources and maps that you can use, really helping in your research projects.”\n\n“There is way more space in the library than you think, whether you’re looking for a private room upstairs (small but good for one or two people) or for a large table to cram in and study with your friends. It’s comfortable and quiet. Book and Brew is awesome, and there’s a math tutoring center based there that most people don’t know about! Take advantage of the tutors—they’re usually pretty free and have a lot of help to offer.”"
