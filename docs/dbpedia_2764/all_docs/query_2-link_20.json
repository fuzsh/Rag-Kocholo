        "text": "Pioneering plant geneticist and research leader\n\nVicki L. Chandler, PhD, is recognized as one of the foremost geneticists in the world. She has conducted critical research in the field of plant genetics for more than three decades. In 2014, she was appointed to the National Science Board by President Barack Obama for a six-year term.\n\nDr. Chandler is chief academic officer and provost at Minerva University, providing administrative leadership and budgetary management for academic affairs, admissions and advising functions, with oversight of all academic programs and policies. She previously served as dean of natural sciences at Minerva.\n\nPrior to joining Minerva University, Dr. Chandler served as the chief program officer for science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. She led research programs and taught at the University of Oregon and the University of Arizona. She has served extensively on national advisory boards and panels, including the National Science Foundation’s Biological Directorate Advisory Committee (2001-2004), and she was elected to the governing council of the National Academy of Sciences (2007-2010). She currently serves on the Board of Science Education for the Academy and on the management board for the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University.\n\nDr. Chandler’s pioneering research on the control of gene expression in plants and animals has garnered numerous awards, including the Presidential Young Investigator Award, the National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers, and the National Institutes of Health Director’s Pioneer Award. She has also been named a Searle Scholar. Dr. Chandler is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nShe has chaired or co-chaired Keystone, Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and Gordon Research conferences, serving the latter as an elected council member and a board trustee. She has been president and served on the Board of Directors for the Genetics Society and served as president of the American Society of Plant Biologists.\n\nDr. Chandler received her BA in biochemistry from the University of California Berkeley and her PhD in biochemistry from the University of California San Francisco. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University.\n\nFor her vast contributions to the field of plant genetics, Drexel is proud to confer upon Dr. Vicki L. Chandler the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa.\n\n(The graduate’s dissertation title and advisor are indicated.)\n\nMaria R.
