        "text": "Arthur Lake, who portrayed the comic strip character Dagwood Bumstead and called for help with a high-pitched ''Blonnndie!'' in more than two dozen films, has died at the age of 81.\n\nMr. Lake, born Arthur Silverlake, died of a heart attack Friday at his desert home. He was best known as the bumbling husband of Blondie, played by Penny Singleton, in the series of movies that ran from 1939 to 1950.\n\nColumbia Pictures was struggling financially when it cast Mr. Lake and Miss Singleton in the first ''Blondie'' film, which cost a mere $85,000.\n\nThe picture grossed $9 million and led to a successful string of sequels like ''Blondie Meets the Boss'' and ''Blondie Brings Up Baby.''\n\nMr. Lake and Miss Singleton also played the parts for the first seven years that ''Blondie'' ran on the radio.\n\nDon Miller, a film expert, called the signing of Mr. Lake as Dagwood ''the greatest piece of casting in the history of movies.'' The actor ''made Dagwood a bit more dumb than he was in the funnies and etched the characterization more broadly,'' Mr. Miller said. ''He was Dagwood Bumstead.'' Mr. Lake was born April 17, 1905, in Corbin, Ky. His father and uncle were touring with a circus as an aerial act called ''The Flying Silverlakes.''\n\nHe moved to Hollywood with his mother when he was 12 years old and made his debut as a child actor in ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' in 1917.\n\nMr. Lake and his wife, Patricia, co-starred in a television series, ''Meet the Family,'' in the 1950's.\n\nAlso surviving Mr. Lake is his son, Arthur Jr."
