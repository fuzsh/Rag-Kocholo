        "text": "ARTHUR RALPH COGSWELL JR., FAIA (1930-2010)\n\nCogswell was born in Jacksonville FL. He graduated in Drama from UNC-Chapel Hill in 1952 and served in the Air Force during the Korean War. After attending the NCSU School of Design and graduating in 1959, he worked for Don Stewart at CPAA before opening up his own firm in 1962. In 1964, he hired Werner Hausler. By 1967 they were partners in Cogswell Hausler, a firm that lasted several decades. The partnership at one time was named CHR for Cogswell, Hausler, and Alan Rimer. One of their many notable commercial projects was the Duke Faculty Club (below).\n\nDuke Faculty Club (destroyed)\n\nWhen the partnership broke up, their records were also divided. Records from Hausler, who died in 1999, were in a storage unit destroyed by Hurricane Floyd. In 1972, Cogswell was named an FAIA, the youngest architect (42) at the time to receive that honor. His career exemplified former NCSU School of Design Dean Henry Kamphoefner's conviction that \"the social responsibilities are as vital as the design.\" In his last years, he was occupied with an innovative process to relieve famine in Libya. In perfect health, he died of an accidental head injury sustained while walking his dog. Cogswell left a legacy of mid-century houses that are still prized today. Posthumously, he received the AIA NC Kamphoefner Prize in 2012.
