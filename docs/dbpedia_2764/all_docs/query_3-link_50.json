        "text": "Brown Bag Session #5, Wed. February 8, 2017 Take Away Notes\n\nWed, Feb 1: The Role of Library Instruction (MIT Recommendation 3): Furthering the library’s mission to equip Mines’ community members with essential skills for effectively using, creating, and disseminating information and knowledge.\n\n9 attendees, including 2 faculty members; 1 CCIT staff member; 1 student; 1 campus architect; 1 member of the Colorado Geological Survey , 2 Trefny Center staff\n\nMajor Takeaways\n\nUndergraduate courses don’t involve much library research. Most that do are humanities. More library instruction needed in STEM vs. humanities courses.\n\nBut HASS courses may be easiest place to further integrate IL since these classes tend to require more research than STEM, and because they are integrated throughout the undergraduate curriculum.\n\nNeed for scaffolding library instruction to prepare students not only for senior design projects, but also for graduate and doctoral students.\n\nStrong need to reach graduate students\n\nInformation literacy (IL) instruction needs to fit “naturally”. It has to have context and a purpose for students to value it.\n\nLibrary component in CSM101 is optional. Making it a required course component is desirable but difficult.\n\nNot enough students know about ILL and options to obtain information sources from other libraries.\n\nIdea: Reach senior design students at beginning of semester when they’re researching and brainstorming for projects. Perhaps flipped classroom group sessions, as the library does with EPICS.\n\nLet students pick their own topics so they’re interested in them.\n\nDisintermediation is an issue – students use library resources via Google Scholar but don’t realize it.\n\nReducing barriers to entry (ease of use) is important to increase use of library resources.\n\nOnline modules have to be contextual, at point of need. But also useful to physically bring first-year students to the library, so they see it’s a good place to work, see how to connect with reference librarian assistance.\n\nOnline materials must be interesting and short as well as useful; otherwise won’t be used.\n\nFor faculty, they won’t need help until they need it, and then you need to reach them right at that point. Difficult challenge.\n\nMines students may be more self-sufficient as high achievers. May not have used a library, or may be reluctant to do so. Seen as a weakness. How to break through that barrier?\n\nNeed to make research easier, provide help at point of need.\n\nCASA, Writing Center, and library are three places where people do ask for help – these units need to partner to connect with students when and where they’re already asking for help.\n\nStudents may not know they can get help at the library, as they can with CASA, Writing Center, and other places on campus. How to raise awareness? Integrating Libguides throughout Canvas is one way.\n\nIdeas for connecting with faculty via Trefny Center.\n\nConcern about IL being deemphasized in revisions of ABED accreditation criteria.\n\nLibrary doesn’t currently reach graduate students much. This is partly a limitation of staffing. Offering open workshops on graduate-level topics may be one approach that is efficient with staffing. We’re just starting on this.\n\nGraduate students come in with varying IL skills. And some graduate research programs may not involve much academic research. Greater focus on applied research.\n\nLibrarians need to participate in curriculum committees.\n\nFULL SESSION NOTES\n\nBrown Bag Session #4, Wed. February 1, 2017\n\nSession Notes\n\nWed, Feb 1: All About Open Access (MIT Recommendations 1, 6, 7): Developing open access platforms, content, and policies to support the producing, using, sharing, and preserving of knowledge (e.g., institutional repository, open educational resources, open access scholarly publishing).\n\n9 attendees (Ye has sign-in sheet and can add/correct): 1 USGS rep; Mines bookstore manager; 1 Student Life staff member; 1 campus architect; 1 undergraduate student; 1 graduate student; 1 CASA staff member; 2 professors; 1 CCIT staff member.\n\nMajor Takeaways\n\nFaculty concern with open access is hefty fees charged by publishers. Raising awareness of repository permissions options to Mines faculty is one possible approach. Library fund to support open access fees is another option. Many emerging models.\n\nOpen access policy for Mines will help campus reach consensus on appropriate models.\n\nFaculty concern about trustworthiness of open access journals (pay to play). Library can promote vetted lists of reputable OA journals (e.g., DOAJ).\n\nEducation about open access and copyright can be part of policy, as at MIT. Library can play role here.\n\nNot all faculty know about extent of Mines thesis/dissertation coverage in our institutional repository.\n\nFaculty present don’t have great concerns about intellectual property protection and open access. Embargo period on IR submissions addresses any concerns they have.\n\nStudent: If researcher has the choice, it’s okay. Library could help students pursue patents or publish via open access. Library can be an educational resource, would be very helpful.\n\nLook to open access policies at other institutions as models for Mines.\n\nFaculty interest in open courses\n\nFaculty interest in assistance publishing online instructional materials (handouts; pdf’s, etc.). Interest in library support for this.\n\nStudents very interested in OER textbooks via library due to cost. Even if just a few and then build it.\n\nStrong discussion about need for commitment by faculty, library, students, admin for OER initiatives to move forward.\n\nFULL BROWN BAG OUTLINE\n\nFrom the Desk of the University Librarian\n\nHappy February, all! Much is afoot at the Arthur Lakes Library:\n\nFirst, a reminder: Many of you have come to enjoy the library’s Annual Book Sale, which has traditionally taken place on President’s Day in February of each year. We know how popular this event is with the campus and community, but after much deliberation the library staff decided to discontinue the event in favor of devoting more time to initiatives that further contribute to creating a 21st-century library for Mines.\n\nIn place of the book sale, we have placed a Free Books Giveaway Shelf just inside the main entrance of the library. It’s already proving quite popular, and free books are flying off the shelves each day. Stop in frequently to see what new titles are available!\n\nFebruary 9 is #idigmines Giving Day, a 24-hour fundraising event that lets you demonstrate your support for the campus causes you care about most. We encourage all to visit the Arthur Lakes Library’s #idigmines page on February 9 and show your love for the library. Contributions can be as small as $5.00 and will help us introduce much-needed study space improvements for our students. The #idigmines cause attracting the most number of donors will earn a $25,000 bonus, so please think of us!\n\nThe library continues to introduce innovative new services to improve the digital library experience. If you haven’t yet heard, we now offer Browzine, a platform that lets you browse, read, and monitor the latest scholarly journals in your discipline, either via a web browser or your favorite mobile device. Browzine is a user-friendly way to organize your fa vorite e-journals into customized virtual bookshelves, be alerted to new issues, save articles, and read e-journals in a user-friendly environment. To learn more and get started, visit our guide at http://libguides.mines.edu/browzine\n\nAnd thank you for everyone who has been coming to the library’s series of Brown Bag lunches. The sessions have been well attended and we are gathering remarkable insights into how the library can better serve our users, insights that are supporting the development of a strategic plan and are informing plans for a renovated and rejuvenated physical library. These brown bag sessions take place each Wednesday at noon in the Boettcher Room of the library through March 1. Learn more.\n\nThe library’s popular Concert Series is already under way. If you missed January’s rousing jazz guitar session, no worries. In February, you can enjoy:\n\nFriday, February 10: Colorado Fuel Cell Center Troubadours\n\nFriday, February 24: Melodic Miners, Women’s A Cappella Group\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback about how the Arthur Lakes Library can better serve you, please let me know.\n\nSpring is around the bend!\n\nCarol Smith\n\nUniversity Librarian\n\nBrown Bag Session #3, Wed. Jan 25, 2017 – Institutional Publishing\n\nWed, Jan 25: Institutional Publishing (MIT Recommendations 1, 4): Becoming a trusted vehicle for disseminating Mines’ research to the world.\n\n11 guests attended this session, including three students, one campus architect, three faculty members, the CIO, the Sr. VP for Research and Technology Transfer, one CASA staff member, and one additional unidentified attendee.\n\nMajor Takeaways\n\nMany questions about ORCID iD; awareness building is needed but the support and interest is there\n\nThere is a recognized need for copyright compliance support on campus. The need for expertise, the time requirements involved, and legal concerns were all mentioned. Role seen for library in facilitating copyright compliance.\n\nAttendees see value in the opportunity to more comprehensively disseminate research\n\nSome faculty maintain Google Scholar profiles, but not all. Faculty recognize the problems and limitations of Google Scholar. Faculty see value in a comprehensive approach managed and controlled by our own institution.\n\nRecognition that this is not just about disseminating research and connecting scholars. It’s also about marketing\n\nThe idea of storytelling as a marketing component resonated strongly with the group. Role seen for library. Stories need to be short.\n\nCriticism of Mines web site, but a new one is coming soon\n\nConcern about interoperability of various systems (Mines website; library site; institutional repository; future expert system)\n\nStudents need to better understand importance of keywords to discoverability and access and how to craft appropriate keywords. Library has role.\n\nFor the Full Notes on The Brown Bag CLICK HERE\n\nLibrary Brown Bag Session #2: Wed. Jan 11, 2017 – Session Notes\n\nBrown Bag Session #2, Wed. Jan 18, 2017\n\nSession Notes\n\nDigital Library Resources (MIT Recommendation 5): Expanding the library’s ability to provide the digital content needed to support learning and research.\n\nTen guests attended this session, including five student; one faculty member; one CASA staff member; one campus architect, and two representatives from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nMajor takeaways, summarized:\n\nNeed more interdisciplinary, “soft” titles vs. just hard STEM titles\n\nNeed to do better job of communicating/marketing e-resources\n\nStudents think they can just use Google Scholar vs. library resources\n\nLibrary needs more study space, more group collaboration space, brighter, more open space\n\nSeveral user questions about platforms\n\nDesire for property data\n\nFaculty not pointing students to library resources, library guides. Need better communication.\n\nTAs just point students to Google. Need to connect with and train TAs.\n\nNeed to better communicate that users can request title acquisitions\n\nNeed to better communicate ILL as an option\n\nDesire for more Nature titles. Budget issue.\n\nPerception/reality that graduates need and use library resources much more than undergraduates.\n\nDesire for free textbook access. Need to promote OER more.\n\nThe VPN is a significant challenge for off-campus library use. Need proxy server for authentication.\n\nInterest in multimedia resources\n\nAnna Seiffert introduction to the topic:\n\n90% of our collections budget goes to electronic resources (e-resources)\n\n119K e-journals, just 20K in print\n\n180K e-books; a bit more in print\n\nOverall 3:1 e-resources : print resources\n\nShift to e-resources\n\nIntroduces Libguides (new, multimedia friendly research guides\n\nIntroduces Browzine (new user-friendly tool for browsing and reading e-journals\n\nQuestion: What does “shift” mean. Answer: transition away from print resources to e-resources\n\nStudent: Can we get more books or e-resources that are not just hard science? Had a specific desire for a book on how economics shape science. An interdisciplinary title. Scholarly journal reviewed and discussed the book, but Arthur Lakes didn’t have it. Realized most materials in the library are hard STEM vs. interdisciplinary. Need “soft” titles as well.\n\nDiscussed how to recommend new titles\n\nDiscussed how to use ILL\n\nDiscussed possible return of Prospector for in-state resource sharing\n\nDiscussed patron-driven acquisition models\n\nCarol asked if the student was interested in leisure reading materials. Answer: Not so much.\n\nStudent: I thought it was odd that we didn’t have this particular title. “Looked into ILL but we’re not a part of it – she meant Prospector – and it would be great if we could rejoin.\n\nStudent: I agree with the shift to more e-resources, but the library needs to do better job of communicating resources to students. He only knows about Mango, and that’s because of the posters. We should similarly market other resources that are just as useful. He doesn’t know what other e-resources we have.\n\nWe asked: What is the best way to reach students? Answer: Visually (e.g., posters). Not all students come to the library, so posters and fliers in other buildings. It helps make the library “not too imposing”.\n\nStudent: In EPICS 1 and 2, and in other classes, we usually focus on just one type of resource (e.g., articles). I thought we could just use Google Scholar and bypass the library. It would be helpful to have a list of resources for that class – a resource guide.\n\nPointed out the new research guides\n\nSame student: I transferred in from a community college –\n\nSame student: I transferred to Mines from a community college that was smaller than Mines. The community college had a smaller library but way more study rooms, more open space. The library was more of a study place but also a group place for collaborating. It had no “twisty, ducking”…it was an open and brighter space.\n\nUSGS question: Does the front page library search tool cover all 267 databases?\n\nAnswer: Most but not all. It’s getting better all the time.\n\nUSGS question: Is the interoperability of different library resources improving?\n\nAnswer: Yes, Primo helps to integrate resources. Our institutional repository is now searchable. Getting better all the time\n\nUSGS question: Is our current platform open source?\n\nStudent question: In chemical engineering, we use a lot of data. Physical property data is more important to chemical engineering students.\n\nYe shows that we have a libguide page on property data. Also shows subject guides in chemistry and chemical engineering with property books, data, etc.\n\nComment: Some kind of communication bridge between librarian and faculty members would probably help use of e-resource. He heard about a website from his professor and used it but didn’t know this (library resource guides) existed. The department doesn’t direct student to library but to external sources instead, but perhaps that’s just a problem with that department\n\nThought: More instruction, better faculty communication needed\n\nStudent: I have used these guides, but TA’s just say to Google it.\n\nThought: We need to connect with the TA’s. Need TA training.\n\nStudent: But the problem also lies with students. Students are stubborn too.\n\nThought: Resources need to be easier to access and use.\n\nAnna: Our resources do connect with Google scholar\n\nAnna: She hears the feedback that we need more interdisciplinary titles, but she isn’t getting any recommendations/suggestions for specific Why – is it because people think we can’t afford the titles? Or is it that they don’t know they can ask?\n\nStudent: Okay, here’s a specific journal I’d like: Nature Chemistry. Our department publishes in it frequently yet we can’t look it up online\n\nAnna: We only subscribe to 3 of the 27 Nature titles. They’re extraordinary expensive and they don’t negotiate. Budget issue.\n\nStudent: In terms of reaching out, you need to consider which student body is more likely to use a resource. I think many are more applicable to graduate students, 90% of them could use these, but not as many undergrads will.\n\nBrianna has an EPICS research guide geared towards undergrads, with broader subjects.\n\nUndergrad: I didn’t have much need for library research as an undergrad, mostly textbook recommendations.\n\nDiscussion on need for textbooks\n\nPaul Martin: The number of available textbooks will increase as open access electronic becomes more important\n\nLibrary: We promote open education resources (OER) in a STEM libgude\n\nStudent: Are some textbooks available? This is biggest complaint from students. If they are available for free, most don’t know that…\n\nPaul: Students need to be communicating this. Do you want e-book textbooks?\n\nStudent: If free, yes! Even if they are biased towards print, free is better.\n\nQuestion: Are there areas other than textbooks where print is preferred over e-resources? Discussion of reference resources.\n\nCarol: Do you ever have trouble accessing library resources off-campus?\n\nAnswer is a resounding YES.\n\nStudent: The VPN is a problem. We were taught how to use VPN in EPICS. Taught how to use it to get Z drive. But sometimes if using Chrome doesn’t work, you have to turn to a different browser. Why is that? Is it a wifi issue? You have to know that you have to be on the VPN to use the library resources. And it doesn’t always work, especially after campus got a new VPN. It was confusing at the beginning as a new student. Had to download the VPN software many, many times.\n\nAnna: And if switching between multiple devices, have to have VPN software on all devices\n\nQuestion: What’s a VPN?\n\nE-learning tab with library resources discussion\n\nQuestion: Is the library going to be included in Shibboleth login?\n\nAnswer: We use it for back-end library work, so we do some interfacing with Shibboleth. But it’s not universally enabled across our resources. It’s individual at the point of each resource, so not a broad solution for user authentication.\n\nQuestion: Regarding media types: do you have statistics on how much text resources are accessed vs. newer information formats such as audio and video delivery. Are you seeing a shift?\n\nAnna demonstrates streaming media options JOVE and Kanopy\n\nQuestion: is there a shift to this?\n\nExcellent further discussion about open access, and about library’s role in assisting authors (e.g., copyright).\n\nLibrary Brown Bag Session 1: Wed. Jan 11 Input Received\n\nThe Physical Library (MIT Recommendation 2): Redesign the library’s physical spaces to support the way scholars learn and collaborate today.\n\nSeven guests attended this session, including one student; two faculty members; one CASA staff member; two campus architects; one design architect\n\nStudents:\n\nBig tables with room to spread out. “I have favorite spots in the library and they’re all big tables.”\n\nRoom between tables\n\nMore space, generally; space is a campuswide concern as well as in the library. “Students have other spaces they go to, but the library is their home, used in a productive way, and you can’t say that about every other building. They think of CASA and they think of the library”\n\n“I know lots of students who come to the library by themselves to get a lot done and they don’t like the table next to them having a bunch of people talking and being pretty loud”.\n\n“Needs to be bigger. I sometimes walk around the library and can’t find a spot that’s open, so having it be bigger would be beneficial.\n\n“Plus it would be able to host more spaces for future growth in the school”\n\nLate hours; earlier weekend hours before 11:00am\n\nQuiet space\n\nMore computers\n\nMore collaborative computers (dual screens) in computer labs – they work together\n\nComputers in group study rooms\n\nModular furniture in some “Whether or not students want to push tables around all the time, not sure”\n\n2-3 chair group study rooms are useful\n\nGroup study rooms should be reservable\n\nIf flat screens in group study rooms, must be easy to use. There are some elsewhere on campus and students use them.\n\nComfortable chairs; beanbags\n\nWould like a social/fun zone for games. A study break space. “I think students would definitely use that.”\n\nPlugs!\n\nWhiteboards or glass boards with plugs nearby\n\n“Having whiteboards is a big thing, very useful, even glass”\n\nBetter layout of library – currently closed off, confusing\n\nMultiple entrances. Have to walk all the way around the building to enter it right now.\n\nNo small desks\n\n“More spread out – I know I keep saying that”\n\nMakerspaces are less of a priority – Brown is getting a big one, several across campus. Some are locked up, so you have to be certified to get access.\n\nLittle need for books (in sophomore year) or research help; mostly uses online library resources\n\nNot sure about need for presentation practice space; interview space\n\nLikes new food policy; should offer/sell food in library\n\nFaculty:\n\nFaculty lounge for interdisciplinary conversation; a social/tea hour space\n\nBroader-ranging concept of what type of space could be helpful for the faculty. Informal space for discussion.\n\nCross-campus conversations right now about need for this need for an informal faculty meeting space, a communal space. And they think of the library as a community space. Makes sense to be thinking about this when thinking about space design.\n\nNot just specific to faculty. Faculty have students, and faculty and students could also use it to get together.\n\nHave also been discussing that other institutions around world have this type of space with traditions. In England, often have tea hour. And it would be every day. Go there for tea, but then during that time, faculty would talk about physics. And with students. A space where ideas could come up, and these types of conversations don’t happen so easy without the space and the time.\n\nWe’re lucky that this school is still small enough for this to work.\n\nBerkeley model for cross-disciplinary exchange\n\nStudent satisfaction – faculty want happy students\n\nMore resources, for both student and faculty satisfaction\n\n90% of faculty conversation is about need for stuff, for resources, for journals\n\nTextbook library – ask faculty to donate to it\n\nCASA staff:\n\nPartnership with the library would be great\n\nMaking up exams. Currently only have 16 seats, and gave 333 exams\n\nTutoring services and space\n\nSupportive learning environment\n\nNew University Librarian: Carol Smith\n\nHappy New Year from the Arthur Lakes Library!\n\nAs the new University Librarian, I would like to thank everyone who has helped me settle in quickly to the Mines community. I met as many people as possible during my first two months here, but I know I still have many more of you to get to know and hope to do so early in the Spring 2017 semester. My door is always open to faculty, staff, students, and community members; feel free to drop by anytime you should find yourself at the library. I also welcome any and all opportunities to schedule a hello visit over a cup of coffee.\n\nMuch is underway at the Arthur Lakes Library. Beginning next week, both the library and the CSM Geology Museum will be embarking together on an intensive 12-week process to review and update our mission, vision, and values statements, and to develop ambitious yet achievable strategic plans that align with and contribute to the university’s strategic goals. We will be sharing our respective plans with you at the beginning of April and look forward to the new directions that come out of this process. Among other benefits, the library’s strategic plan will directly inform and guide our campus and design architects as we work with them to envision a renovated Arthur Lakes Library that better serves how scholars research, collaborate, and learn in today’s digital environment.\n\nYou can help! As I often like to say, it’s your library – you own it. Your input is essential to help us craft an innovative strategic plan for a 21st century STEM library. Accordingly, the library will be hosting a series of eight weekly themed brown bag lunch conversations, beginning Wednesday, January 9, at noon. All lunches will be held in the Boettcher Room and beverages will be served. Please see the attached flyer for additional details. We encourage you to attend any and all sessions and let us know what you’d like to see in your future library. Input can relate to the session’s primary theme, but we will also allow plenty of unstructured time for you to share any and all ideas you may have. And we’ll use this blog to share your input as we gather it.\n\nWe’re not waiting until the library renovation commences, though, to introduce improvements for both our physical and our digital library users. Those visiting the library will now find bean bag chairs, FitDesks, under the table cycles, and other short-term physical enhancements to make for a more comfortable and active study experience. We’ve also relaxed our food policy – we know that you need sustenance to study, so food and beverages (containers with lids) are now welcome anywhere in the library’s open spaces. We just ask that library users clean up after themselves, and cleaning supplies can be found at the circulation desk.\n\nHalf of the modern academic library is now electronic, and library users will find several significant improvements to their digital library experience. Our many course and discipline-specific research guides are now powered by a user-friendly, multimedia empowered platform. You’ll also find our A to Z list of electronic resources to be easier to navigate and access.\n\nAnd of course, more of our popular library music concerts are on the way, beginning with a guitar event on Friday, January 27th – watch for announcements in the Daily Blast!\n\nI wish everyone a successful Spring 2017 semester. If you have any feedback about how the Arthur Lakes Library can better serve you, please let me know.\n\nStay warm out there!\n\nCarol Smith\n\nUniversity Librarian\n\nDeselection Criteria\n\nFor the deselection process, we’re guided by assessment data that support informed decision-making and evaluation by knowledgeable library staff.\n\nBaseline criteria include:\n\nUsage\n\nAvailability of other copies (in print or e- format) at Mines\n\nAvailability elsewhere within our regional library consortium (the Alliance)\n\nRelevance to campus programs and individuals\n\nAcquisitions date/publication date\n\nOf course, these don’t give the full picture. From there, we evaluate items based on a wider range of factors that could include:\n\nUser input; feedback from library staff on how the item supports users (reference assistance, instruction, research); subject-specialist input.\n\nDegree to which the item supports campus programs; relevance to Mines research activity; multi-disciplinary support.\n\nPhysical condition; availability of newer versions or alternatives.\n\nCharacteristics of the literature by subject; the item’s role within a larger subject collection; modern or historical relevance.\n\nDegree of availability from other libraries; resource-sharing developments; collection trends in our Alliance partner libraries.\n\nQuestions? Post a comment here, or contact Anna Seiffert, our e-Resources Librarian."
