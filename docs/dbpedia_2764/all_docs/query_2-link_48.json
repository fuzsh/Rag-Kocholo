        "text": "Loved and cherished by all, she was known by Pat, Patti, and Nannie. A unique God-fearing lady of impeccable faith & character, Pat had a beautiful smile that was her trade-mark to the very end. She was an avid cook and could bake delectable lip-smack’n desserts & sweets to everyone’s delight such that she became the “kitchen queen” and her home became her castle. She loved having her “brood” gather at the house to enjoy one of her big dinners and she was instrumental over many years enjoying family and friends while on vacation at Crystal Beach, Texas.\n\nBorn on July 7, 1941, in Port Arthur, Texas, Pat spent her teenage years growing up and being educated in that area. She was a licensed beauty operator and operated but a short time when she married Calvin Jaetzold on December 21, 1959, her husband of near 65 years. They moved with his job to several Texas towns before settling in the Lake Charles area in 1978 and have been here ever since and currently reside in Carlyss.\n\nDuring the early years when rearing her 3 children, Pat took great pride in her family and followed her sons to countless sporting events and various church activities. She made certain that she accompanied her daughter to various school activities and was active as a Girl Scout leader. Pat was active in her church St. John Lutheran Church where she was a Sunday School Teacher, in Ladies Aid, regularly attended Adult Bible Study and weekly Sunday services. She help coordinate many of the annual fund raiser “rummage sales” to help fund other church projects. She dearly loved antique shopping especially her trips to Fredricksburg, Texas. And to top off her social calendar she immensely enjoyed gathering with the “gang” of close friends to cook, party, and socialize and seasonally attend McNeese football games. Pat retired from JC Penneys following 26 years of service.\n\nPat leaves to cherish her memory her husband Calvin and three children. Two sons, Trent & Spencer Jaetzold and her daughter Candace Weidner & husband Glenn along with her sister Mary Stewart. She has seven grandchildren and seven great grand children along with numerous nephews & nieces. Most of her “brood” lives in the immediate area.\n\nThose who proceeded Pat in death were her parents, Arthur and Gloria Goodman, four brothers, James Bennett, Shelly Walker, Arthur Goodman, and Jesse Goodman.\n\nThe family extends their special thanks & gratitude to Harbor House Hospice and the nurses and aides for their excellent compassionate care, plus the professional and attentive loving care provided daily by Ruthie Jones.\n\nServices will be held on Thursday, May 23, 2024, at St. John Lutheran Church, 600 University Dr., Lake Charles.\n\nVisitation will begin at 1:00p until 2:30p with the service beginning at 2:30p and internment will be at Consolata Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be sent to the Alzheimer’s Disease Research, Bright Focus Foundation, 22512 Gateway Center Dr., Clarksburg, MD 20871."
