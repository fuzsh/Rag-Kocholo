        "text": "Dr. Paul Arthur Will, 77, of Alpine, Texas, made his entrance into heaven February 26, 2023 in Waco, Texas. Paul recently celebrated his birthday on February 9th. He was born to Arthur Walter and Mary Belle Denman Will in Weslaco, Texas. He met the love of his life Mazie Elizabeth McLellan, and they were married 52 years.\n\nPaul graduated from Donna High School in Donna, Texas. While there, he was a member and President of the Donna 4-H Club and raised and showed sheep. Paul was a trombone player in the school band. Upon graduating, he enrolled at Texas A&I University in Kingsville, Texas for three years before transferring to Texas A&M University where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science. Upon graduating, he accepted a position as a Lab Technician at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary School. He moved to Stillwater with his new bride, Mazie. He later earned a Master of Science and PhD in Food Science with a specialization of Meat Science.\n\nIn 1978, Paul accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Animal Science (Meat Science) at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas. He was a faculty member for 38 years. He served as Chair of the Department of Animal Science for 12 years and retired as a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in 2016. In honor of his devoted service to Sul Ross, the University named one classroom the Paul A. Will Lecture Hall. Paul loved working with his students in the meat lab and seeing their successful careers after graduation. His fondness for sausage making earned him the title of “Sausage King of the Big Bend.” He was President of the Alpine Rotary Club in the mid 80’s. He and Mazie were Alpine Band Booster Co-Presidents.\n\nPaul was a devoted husband, father, grandfather (PawPaw), professor, colleague, mentor and friend who loved the Lord.
