        "text": "MCKEE, ARTHUR GLENN (12 Jan. 1871-19 Feb. 1956), engineer and designer of iron and steel mills, was born in State College Pennsylvania, the son of Professor James Y. and Margaret Anne (Glenn) McKee. He attended public schools in the college town and Pennsylvania State University, receiving a B.S. in 1891 and later an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the school. After holding a series of responsible positions in the iron and steel industry, McKee came to Cleveland in 1901 to work at the American Steel & Wire Co., becoming district engineer by 1905. That year he left and founded his own consulting engineering firm, and in 1906 electrical engineer, Robert E. Baker, and construction engineer, Donald Herr, joined as partners in the firm. McKee developed blastfurnace specialties, including the revolving distributor, stock bins, and test rods and held many patents in the field. The Blast Furnace Appliance Co. was organized to hold the patents and license their use in the iron and steel industry. The Arthur G. McKee Co., which incorporated in 1915, expanded and gained a reputation for sound engineering. McKee himself became one of the top engineers in the country.\n\nMcKee married Marion Fairbanks Deane 20 April 1899, and they had 2 daughters, Mary Katherine (Mrs. Paul O. Semon, Jr.) and Marion Glenn (Mrs. John Latta). After his wife's death 4 June 1948, he married Mrs. Bennetta Heath Alexander who survived him. McKee died at his Cleveland home and was buried at LAKE VIEW CEMETERY.\n\nArthur G. McKee Co. The McKee Organization (1961)."
