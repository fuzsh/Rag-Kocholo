        "text": "\" A lion roars within\" - Arthur to Tedros\n\nKing Arthur is a figure from Arthurian legend. He is the father of Tedros and Chaddick, and the ex-husband of Guinevere.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nWhen Arthur was younger, he had been adopted by Sir Ector, whom he considered his father. His real parents were unknown.\n\nOne morning he’d gone out feverishly seeking a new sword for his master — Arthur had been punished for losing the old one — and he stumbled upon Excalibur, trapped in an anvil in the village square. He pulled the sword easily, without a second thought, intending to return it to the stone at a later date. What he didn’t know was that Excalibur had been placed in that stone by the Lady of the Lake to settle the question of who would rule Camelot after a violent period of chaos and anarchy. Thousands had come from all over the Woods to try their hand at the sword before Arthur freed it from the stone without any knowledge of the consequences.\n\nBack then, Camelot was so in need of a leader that they crowned Arthur even though he wasn’t yet sixteen.\n\nOn the morning of his coronation, as per tradition, he had his portrait painted by the Palace Artist. Though it depicted him as a scrawny, timorous, red-faced teenager who didn’t look capable of brushing his own teeth, let alone running Camelot. Given the result, he fired the artist.\n\nHe made the palace staff take it down again and again. But in time, it would always mysteriously return, most likely by his own hand. It became quite clear that though he loathed the painting, he also couldn’t part with it. Perhaps it reminded him of the ‘real’ Arthur, before his time at the School for Good and Evil changed him.\n\nWhen he was crowned and needed a steward, he brought Lady Gremlaine to Camelot even though she was hardly capable of managing a king. They had met because she had been a housemaid to Sir Ector. They had become friends, for they were both treated quite poorly as children. But somehow they muddled through together, bucking his Council of Advisors and forging their own path, until he went off to school.\n\nArthur attended the School for Good as a legitimate king and an instant celebrity. There, he met and fell in love with Guinevere, who was actually in love with Arthur's best friend, Lancelot. During the Snow Ball, Lancelot danced with Guinevere when she was Arthur's date.\n\nHe excelled in his work and became a Leader in his third-year track, along with Guinevere. Then, he convinced Guinevere to be his princess since he was a Leader, while Lancelot was just a sidekick.\n\nAfter graduation, Merlin became Arthur's sidekick. Arthur then ruled over Camelot with Guinevere as his queen.\n\nWhenever Good and Evil faced a common threat, the whole Woods looked towards King Arthur to come save them with his loyal knight, Sir Lancelot, by his side.\n\nMarriage to Guinevere[]\n\nAfter making Guinevere his queen, Arthur loved and cherished her, showering her with precious gifts. Together, they kept Camelot prosperous and the castle minty clean and fresh. They had son together called Tedros. To ensure Tedros' coronation painting would be to his liking, Arthur solicited a seer to imagine his upon his birth. A portrait that would capture the essence of his soul and future.\n\nWhen Guinevere and Lady Gremlaine had a falling out, Arthur's wife forced him to fire her.\n\nAt some point of their relationship, around the time Guinevere was pregnant, he cheated on her with Lady Gremlaine. This resulted in the birth of Chaddick.\n\nOne day, when Tedros was 9 years old, a possessive Arthur became suspicious of his wife's activities at night while she slept in her own room. He went to Merlin and demanded a way to spy on Guinevere. Merlin refused to help him, leading Arthur to steal a potion from him. The potion temporarily changed Arthur's gender, allowing him to spy from under Guinevere's window.\n\nAt night, Arthur discovered Lancelot under Guinevere's window. Furious, he came with guards to imprison Guinevere and Lancelot for their betrayal. But the two had already escaped on horseback and could not be tracked. An angry and heartbroken Arthur then put a price on both of their heads. Merlin also disappeared (to secretly help Guinevere and Lancelot), destroying Arthur's faith in magic. He then banned all fairies from the castle and resorted to drinking.\n\nTedros watched Arthur waste away as he died the next year in battle, when his son was 10 years old.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil[]\n\nHis famous tale made his son, Tedros, very popular at the School for Good. There was also a hedge depicting his story.\n\nQuests for Glory[]\n\nWhen Tedros was to be crowned Camelot's king, he returned home with Agatha, to see that Arthur's advisors pocketed all of Camelot's money after his death, leaving it bankrupt. For the coronation test made by Arthur, Tedros had to pull Excalibur out of a stone but failed horribly.\n\nAfter his failed coronation, he spent months having nightmares about his father and not being as good as him. During one nightmare, his father told him to \"unbury him\".\n\nA Crystal of Time[]\n\nTedros went to Arthur's grave and found his preserved ghost. They had an emotional conversation that awoke the Lion inside Tedros.\n\nOne True King[]\n\nArthur made a Tournament of Kings with 3 tests, giving Tedros another chance to prove that he is the true king.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nGuinevere[]\n\nMain Article: The Legend of King Arthur\n\nTedros[]\n\nTedros was Arthur and Guinevere's son. To ensure Tedros' coronation painting would be to his liking, Arthur solicited a seer to imagine his upon his birth. A portrait that would capture the essence of his soul and future.\n\nWhen Guinevere ran away with Lancelot, Arthur was heartbroken and turned to alcohol to numb his pain. Tedros watched him waste away. As Arthur put on his armour before going to fight his last battle, Tedros begged his father not to go, to no effect. Arthur then died of mortal wounds on the battlefield.\n\nFor the coronation test made by Arthur, Tedros had to pull Excalibur out of a stone but failed horribly. After his failed coronation, he spent months having nightmares about his father and not being as good as him. During one nightmare, his father told him to \"unbury him\".\n\nTedros went to Arthur's grave and found his preserved ghost. They had an emotional conversation that awoke the Lion inside Tedros. Arthur made a Tournament of Kings with 3 tests, giving Tedros another chance to prove that he is the true king.\n\nLancelot[]\n\nArthur and Lancelot met at the School For Good and became best friends. Though they were both in love with Guinevere. During the Snow Ball, Lancelot danced with Guinevere when she was Arthur's date. Arthur convinced Guinevere to be his princess since he was a Leader, while Lancelot was just a sidekick.\n\nAfter graduation, Lancelot became Arthur's loyal knight and rode beside him in battle many times. He was Tedros' role model.\n\nWhen Arthur discovered Guinevere and Lancelot's betrayal, he came with guards to imprison them. But the two had already escaped on horseback and could not be tracked. An angry and heartbroken Arthur then put a price on both of their heads and resorted to drinking to numb his pain.\n\nLancelot continued to guide Tedros when he became king, up until his final moments.\n\nMerlin[]\n\nMerlin became Arthur's sidekick after graduation. He guided Arthur through many problems and was very close to him.\n\nWhen Arthur became suspicious of his wife, he went to Merlin and demanded a way to spy on Guinevere. Merlin refused to help him, leading Arthur to steal a potion from him. The potion temporarily changed Arthur's gender, allowing him to spy from under Guinevere's window.\n\nWhen Arthur discovered Lancelot and Guinevere's betrayal, he came with guards to imprison them but the two had already fled on horseback. Merlin also disappeared (to secretly help Guinevere and Lancelot), destroying Arthur's faith in magic. He then banned him from ever returning to Camelot.\n\nGrisella Gremlaine[]\n\nArthur met Lady Gremlaine when he had been brought to Sir Ector's home from the orphanage, where she was a housemaid. They had become friends, for they were both treated quite poorly as children. When he was crowned and needed a steward, he brought Lady Gremlaine to Camelot even though she was hardly capable of managing a king. But somehow they muddled through together, bucking his Council of Advisors and forging their own path, until he went off to school.\n\nLady Gremlaine had always been in love with Arthur- the whole kingdom knew that. So when he came back to Camelot after graduating with Guinevere on his arm, she absolutely loathed her. Right after Tedros was born, Arthur's wife forced him to fire her.\n\nAt some point, around the time Guinevere was pregnant, he cheated on her with Lady Gremlaine. This resulted in the birth of Chaddick.\n\nLady Gremlaine was disappointed when Tedros revealed that Arthur had never even mentioned her to his son. She had wanted to help him raise his child.\n\nChaddick[]\n\nChaddick was Arthur's illegitimate child with Lady Gremlaine. It is unknown wether the two knew about their relation since Lady Gremlaine had left the castle after being fired by Guinevere before giving birth and Chaddick had been killed long before the truth was revealed.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nArthur was bearded and powerfully built with grey hair, a square jaw and crystal-blue eyes.\n\nWhen he was younger, he had his portrait painted by the Palace Artist. It depicted him as a scrawny, timorous, red-faced teenager who didn’t look capable of brushing his own teeth, let alone running Camelot.\n\nLegend[]\n\nMain Article: The Legend of King Arthur\n\nTrivia[]"
