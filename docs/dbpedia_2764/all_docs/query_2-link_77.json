        "text": "Student Publications\n\nColumbia Daily Spectator, the student newspaper, has been digitized and is easily searchable (by text or by date). You can find articles and photographs from 1877 to the present.\n\nThe Blue Books were student handbooks meant to acclimate students to campus and the surrounding community. Information on student activities and clubs was provided as well as services in the community such as churches and social gatherings. Academic information and descriptions of faculty were also included. The handbooks were published for many years by the Christian Association, the campus name for the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), and then starting in 1923-1924, by the Columbia Spectator. It appears that the last Blue Book was published during the University's bicentennial year, 1953-1954.\n\nThe Columbia Jester was the student humor magazine established in 1901. The publication has been printed mostly continuously through 1997 and was revived in 2001 and again in 2005. The March 1912 issue was digitized as part of the Seymour B. Durst Old York Library collection at the Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library. A mostly complete run of the paper copies (with links to digital issues) is available at the University Archives.\n\nThe Blue and White, Columbia's undergraduate magazine, originally ran from 1890 to 1893. These early issues have been digitized for preservation.\n\nBlue and White, 1890-1891\n\nBlue and White, 1891-1982\n\nBlue and White, 1892-1893\n\nPublication resumed in 1998 and the Blue and White Archive provides access to digitized copies from 1998 to 2013. To see content from 2014 to the current issues and podcasts, please visit the magazine's website.\n\nThe Federalist aka The Fed was originally intended to address political issues and was started by Neil M. Gorsuch, Andrew Levy and P.T. Waters in 1986. Since then the Fed has evolved and it is now better known for its humor and satirical take on the news of the day. The Fed keeps an archive of some past issues on their website and a selected number of issues from 1986 to 1988 are available here.\n\nColumbia College Today, the alumni magazine, offers extensive coverage of life \"around the quads.\" There are student profiles and interviews, sports updates and news, and whole issues devoted to campus matters: religion on campus, college students and their emotional needs, coeducation, etc. The issues from 1957 to the present are easily accessible online. There is also an index to help you find articles and students (current and former) featured in its pages.\n\nPaper copies of the publications are non-circulating and can only be viewed in the Rare Book & Manuscript Library's reading room (RBML). In order to use the University Archives collections at the RBML, researchers are required to register their own Special Collections Research Account before their visit and to validate the account in person with government-issued photo identification or Columbia ID card. For more information on how to access our collections, check out our Research & Access website.\n\nStudent Group Records\n\nThere are dedicated research guides for the LGBT student groups, Varsity Show, and the 1968 student strike.\n\nHistorical Subject Files\n\nThis collection consists of clippings, press releases, programs, and other printed matter compiled over the years by curators of the Columbiana Collection and staff of the University Archives. The files contain an assortment of information on numerous topics related to Columbia University history and are a very good reference source and starting point for research on many areas of Columbia's past. Look for the series on Athletics, Demonstrations, Publications, Social Issues, Student Life, and Women at Columbia.\n\nColumbiana Manuscripts\n\nThis collection consists of a wide range of documents but student groups are well represented. You can find minutes, rosters, correspondence and constitutions of various student clubs including the Bicycle Club, Shakespeare Club, Romance Club, Dramatic Club, Debating Society, Glee Club musical scores and materials related to the Philolexian and Peithologian Societies.\n\nColumbia University Committee on Student Organizations records, 1905-1919\n\nThe collection consists mostly of correspondence as well as constitutions, pamphlets, newspaper clippings, and request forms, generated by the Committee from 1905 to 1919. Correspondence relates to general administrative matters including eligibility requirements, governance of the Committee, correspondence with student organizations regarding eligibility of members as well as filing of eligibility blanks maintained by the Committee.\n\nStudent organizations representing the University before the publicThis publication, similar to the bulletins, lists information about the management and structure of student organizations (the regulation of the University Committee on Student Organizations) as well as list of clubs and their officers. We do not have a complete run, just a few bulletins (1903-1904, 1907, 1909, 1910-1911, 1923-1924). Call number CP2 I.\n\nCentral Files (Office of the President records) is a great source to investigate the changing nature of student activities and student relations with the administration, and how student organizations reflect upon the University. Between 1900 and the 1940s in particular, Columbia sought ways to centralize the administration of nonacademic services. Look for Frederick Goetz (who served as comptroller to student organizations); King’s Crown (the alumni body which oversaw the budgets of certain student organizations); the Committee on Student Organizations (which wrote regulations governing the selection of speakers by student organization); and the Registrar (all student organizations needed to complete a form with the purpose and membership of the organization, forms from 1940-1962 are in boxes 568-570).\n\nWhile many campus groups records can be found in the Historical Subject Files, here are some collections of records from specific student activities on campus:\n\nCU Amateur Radio Club records, 1920s-2000s\n\nChicanx Caucus records, 2001-2014\n\nColumbia Clefhangers records, 1990-2011\n\nColumbia Daily Spectator records, 1886-1982\n\nColumbia Sigma Xi records, 1902-1997\n\nGlee Club collection, 1912-2011\n\nPhilolexian Society - This literary and debate society is the oldest student group at Columbia.\n\nOnline\n\nA history of the Philolexian society of Columbia university from 1802-1902, by Ernest A. Cardozo, '99.\n\nConstitution & By-Laws of the Philolexian Society of Columbia College\n\nIn-Person\n\nHistorical Subject Files – including by-laws, constitutions, correspondence, newsletters and writings, newspaper clippings and articles.\n\nRoll books, from 1830-1905 (microfilm) and 1907-1910.\n\nSignatures of members and past officers of Philolexian Society, Columbia University secured at the Centennial Dinner of the Society, held in May, 1902.\n\nPhilolexian Society Minutes, 1843-1870 (microfilm)\n\nArchival collections are only accessible in person at the Rare Book & Manuscript Library (RBML) reading room.Visitors are required to register their own Special Collections Research Account before their visit and to validate the account in person with government-issued photo identification or Columbia ID card.
