He writes \"Our hospital quarter is located in the fair grounds. The medical services are not perfect yet, but we must try our best for the Japanese evacuees to keep them healthy and well. There are about eight thousand people in the four areas and we physicians are only five in number. Moreover, yesterday one of us, Dr. Akamatsu, was ordered to move to Tule Lake Center Camp with only one day notice. We are obliged to change our daily schedule very often. People are overanxious and we are called for nothing very often.\" Koike writes that Matsushita's wife, Hanaye, is still suffering from nerves but \"is never in sick bed even a day after coming here.\"",
