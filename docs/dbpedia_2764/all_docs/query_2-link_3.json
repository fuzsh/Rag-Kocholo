My previous projects focused on stream restoration, the political economy of environmental expertise, environmental markets, and the ways in which water policies shape fluvial systems in the US. My current work focuses on anthropogenic flooding in the US Midwest. I have published in journals ranging from Science to Social Studies of Science and am the author of two monographs: Fields and Streams: Stream Restoration, Neoliberalism, and the Future of Environmental Science (2012, University of Georgia Press) and Streams of Revenues: The Restoration Economy and the Ecosystems it Creates (2021 MIT Press; co-written with Martin Doyle). I have co-edited four volumes: the Handbook of Political Economy of Science (2017), the Handbook of Critical Physical Geography (2018), and two collections on Doreen Massey (2018). Over the last five years, I have given 29 invited talks and keynotes (including four at the invitation of undergraduate or graduate student organizations) at institutions in Aotearoa/New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, and the US. Teaching is one of my favorite parts of academia. My courses combine physical and human geography approaches to the environment, particularly in relation to environmental conservation, ecological restoration, multispecies relations, and water resources. I was my department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies for eight years and have won multiple teaching awards.\n\nPublic Engagement and Synergistic Activities: I co-founded EDGI (the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative), an international network started in in response to the 2016 US presidential elections, which provoked deep fears about the loss of environmental data collected and held by the US government and about the rollback of environmental protections more broadly. I was the initial coordinator of EDGI’s website tracking team, which monitors, documents, and publicizes changes to tens of thousands of US federal agency webpages, particularly those related to climate change and environmental justice.\n\nRead her president's columns\n\nSusan L. Cutter\n\nGeographer and disaster researcher Susan L. Cutter is the Carolina Distinguished Professor and Director of the Hazards Vulnerability & Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina. Her work focuses on factors that contribute to people’s and places’ susceptibility to disasters. She has studied how vulnerability and resistance are measured, monitored, and assessed; how people can recover from disasters; and how to predict and map disasters and hazards. She earned her bachelors degree at California State University, East Bay and her masters and doctorate at the University of Chicago. In addition to her work at the University of South Carolina, she has taught at the University of Washington, Rutgers University, and the University Institute for Environment and Human Security in Bonn, Germany. A prolific writer, she has published more than 150 papers, given testimony before Congress, and authored or edited 14 books, many on risks and hazards. In 2019 she was appointed a Fellow of AAG.\n\nWilliam L. Graf\n\nOne of the preeminent river scientists in the world, Graf focused on fluvial geomorphology in arid regions. He also was a recognized expert on Federal land policies. Graf earned his bachelors, masters and doctorate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, all in physical geography. After graduation, he taught briefly at the University of Iowa. He then moved to Arizona State University where he became a Regents Professor. When he retired, he joined the University of South Carolina as the University Foundation Distinguished Professor, subsequently chairing the department of geography and serving as interim Associate Dean for Research in the College of Arts and Sciences. He was also influential in public policy, appointed to the Presidential Commission on American Heritage Rivers by President William Clinton, and also chairing the Environmental Advisory Board of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. At the time of his death in 2019, he was serving as a science advisor to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Missouri River Recovery Program Implementation Committee, to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydropower Initiative, and to American Rivers, Inc. At AAG, he will be remembered for his presidential catchphrase, “It’s a good day for geography.”\n\nLawrence A. Brown\n\nLawrence A. Brown (born Browamik) is known as one of the primary movers of geography’s quantitative revolution, that prepared the way for geospatial technology, including GIS. His book, Innovation Diffusion, became a definitive work for the adoption of new products and techniques worldwide. He served AAG in many capacities, including vice president before he was president, and received an AAG Lifetime Achievement Award. Brown was a first-generation American whose family fled the pogroms against Jews of the Ukraine; the family name was changed from Browarnik to Brown when they immigrated to the U.S. via Ellis Island. He grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania intended to be a car mechanic, but was bitten by the geography bug while traveling with his brother Ed. Brown earned his Ph.D. in geography from Northwestern University in 1966. A Distinguished Professor and former chair of Ohio State University department of geography, Brown passed away in 2014.\n\nGeorge J. Demko\n\nGeorge Demko was a professor emeritus of geography at Dartmouth College with a special passion: the geographies of mystery stories. He was a prolific teacher and writer on the spatial elements of crime fiction and, at the time of his death, was at work on a book, Landscapes of Murder: The Locus Operandi of Crime Fiction. The child of immigrant parents from the Ukraine and then-Czechosolvakia, he also specialized in the urban and political geographies of the Soviet bloc and Russia. After receiving his Ph.D. from Penn State University in 1964, he taught at Ohio State University for 20 years. From 1984 to 1985 he shifted to public service, directing the Office of the Geographer before his appointment to Dartmouth. During his career, he also was program director of Geography and Regional Science at the National Science Foundation, and executive director of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.\n\nNicholas Helburn\n\nOutdoorsman, organic gardener, ecologist, peace activist, mentor and educator Nicholas Helburn was a bridge builder during World War II, as a conscientious objector to the war, and also served as a smoke jumper in Montana. He earned his Ph.D. in geography from the University of Wisconsin after earning a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago and a master’s degree in agricultural economics from Montana State University. In 1965, he was appointed the director of the High School Geography Project, a curriculum project sponsored by the National Science Foundation to develop a new approach for teaching geography in high schools. He also became the first director of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) for Social Studies. He joined the faculty of the University of Colorado, where he chaired the geography department for three years. During his lifetime, he was recognized for his efforts to further the cause of world peace.\n\nHarold M. Rose\n\nHarold Rose was the first African American elected President of the AAG and among the first tenured Black professors at the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin. He was a pioneer in research on race and segregation; as his 2016 obituary states, “His scholarship established that examining segregation was not just about mapping the distribution of racial groups across the urban landscape, but also about understanding the social processes and attitudes about race that produced those patterns.” Dr. Rose’s extensive research focused on how racism and racial policy affected urbanization, development, and human experiences of cities. He earned his bachelors at Tennessee State University and his masters and Ph.D. at Ohio State University. Although Rose began his academic career exploring issues of land use and natural resource management, he shifted focus after arriving at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1962, where he spent most of his career. AAG’s Harold M. Rose Award for Anti-Racism Research and Practice was created in his honor.\n\nEdward J. Taaffe\n\nEdward (Ned) Taaffe was born into an Irish-American family on the south side of Chicago. His family moved throughout the city almost every year. He later said the only advantage to this was how he got to know the city’s breadth and diversity. His first encounter with spatial science was as a trainer for meteorologists in the Army Air Corps, before he had even completed college. After the war, he enrolled in the University of Chicago’s graduate geography program. As a professor at Northwestern University and then as chair of the geography department at Ohio State University, he built a reputation as an urban and transportation geographer. He also was an influential voice in securing more recognition for geography as a social science.\n\nArch C. Gerlach\n\nFor much of his career, Arch Gerlach was chief of the Geography and Map Division at the Library of Congress. One of his longstanding projects was a summer geography employment program for students to bring uncategorized map materials into the collection. Under his supervision, some 2 million maps were documented, and 1 million duplicates were sent to other collections. During World War II, he worked at the Geography and Map Division of the U.S. Department of State. After the war, he taught geography for nearly four years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but soon returned to Washington, D.C., for the rest of his career. He remained connected to global contexts throughout his career, especially in his leadership as a member and president of the Pan American Institute of Geography.\n\nGilbert F. White\n\nGilbert F. White’s work on natural hazards, especially flooding, were among the most important contributions by a geographer in the 20th century. In the 1980s, he also contributed to the literature on preventing nuclear proliferation and restoring geopolitical balance. The common thread was his dedication to “the human family” as he once described humanity. A Quaker and lifelong pacifist, White aspired, for example, to ensure safe water as a human right for all people. His devotion to sound water management earned him the title of “father of floodplain management.” He served six years in the New Deal administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later became the youngest-ever president of Haverford College. He then chaired the geography department at the University of Chicago, his alma mater, and joined the faculty of the University of Colorado in 1969, where he was affiliated until his death in 2006. A Fellow of AAG, White is the namesake of AAG’s Gilbert F. White Distinguished Public Service Honors.\n\nJoe Russell Whitaker\n\nResource conservationist Joe Russell Whitaker lived a life as expansive as the field of geography—he was born in 1900 and lived until 2000. Raised in rural Bluegrass Kentucky, he went on to study under J. Paul Goode at the University of Chicago and to work with major conservationists such as Aldo Leopold. Whitaker deplored what he called the “fruitless effort to ‘define’ geography; a dead-end effort,” when he saw the field as dynamic and interdisciplinary to its core. His greatest passion was teaching, and he taught at numerous institutions, notably Marquette, and Peabody College. Writing became his focal point at age 68, when be began to write essays on science, philosophy, and cultural history, according to his obituary by Geoffrey J. Martin in The Annals of the American Association of Geography. He said, “Seneca came still closer to my attitude toward study and teaching when he wrote, over 1900 years ago, ‘I am glad to learn in order that I may teach’.”\n\nGriffith Taylor\n\nT. Griffith Taylor was born in England and received his doctorate from the University of Sydney in Australia, where we went on to direct its geography program. Later in his career, from 1929 until 1951, he held geography positions in North America, first at the University of Chicago and then at the University of Toronto. A highlight of his work was when he accompanied the Terra Nova expedition to Antarctica from 1910 to 1913, leading the team of mappers who created the first maps and geological interpretations of that continent. Taylor authored more than 20 books and 200 scientific articles, most of them from the standpoint of environmental determinism and theories of scientific racism. He also proposed dire and controversial limits for Australia’s population by the end of the 20th century. He was nonetheless honored throughout his life, including with an Australian postage stamp in 1976.\n\nOliver E. Baker\n\nWorld renowned agricultural geographer and population expert Oliver Baker was co-author of the Atlas of World Geography, published in 1917. Baker later also produced the Atlas of American Agriculture. Earning his master’s in geography at Columbia, Baker pursued additional studies in forestry at Yale and agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1912, Baker took a position with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where he worked off and on for the next 30 years. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1921, and taught part time at Clark University from 1923 to 1927. His focus was on regional agricultural geography and farm populations. He was particularly interested in the migration of rural youth into urban areas, and in improving the standards for American farmers. His research on population problems stemmed from his interest in what he saw as the most valuable farm product: outstanding citizens. In the early 1940s Baker established the Department of Geography at the University of Maryland.\n\nIsaiah Bowman\n\nBorn in 1876 in Ontario Canada, Isaiah Bowman became a U.S. citizen in 1900. He studied under AAG’s first President, William Morris Davis, at Harvard, then pursued his Ph.D. at Yale. Early in his career, his work focused on physical geography, population, and settlement. His book Forest Physiography (1911) was the first comprehensive work published on American physiographic divisions. He did extensive field studies in the Andes mountains in 1907, 1911, and 1913. In 1915, Bowman became first Director of the American Geographical Society. In 1918, he played a critical role under President Woodrow Wilson determining land areas and national borders, especially in the Balkans, after World War I. This experience caused him to turn away from the environmental determinism that had previously driven his work, and made him one of the first political geographers. From 1911 to 1937, he produced several significant publications, including The New World: Problems in Political Geography (1928). In 1935, he became Johns Hopkins’s fifth President.\n\nEllsworth Huntington\n\nA geographer and climate determinist, Ellsworth Huntington traveled extensively through Asia and Europe during his career. Like many geographers of his generation, he relied heavily on theories of environmental determinism and eugenics that led to false conclusions about racial and cultural “fitness,” and scientific racism. Although he acknowledged instances when the data contradicted his theories, he did not categorically use his findings to justify white supremacy. As an instructor at Euphrates College in Turkey, he explored the canyons of the Euphrates River in 1901. He also supported AAG’s first President William Morris Davis on an expedition to Turkestan. He earned degrees from Beloit and Harvard before earning his Ph.D. at Yale. He spent nearly 30 years teaching at Yale, continuing to travel and write extensively. He also worked in research at the Carnegie Institution in Washington D.C., focusing on the influence of climate on landforms, geological and historical changes, and human settlements.\n\nEllen Churchill Semple\n\nAAG’s first woman president and a founding member, Ellen Churchill Semple was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1863. She attended Vassar for her bachelors and master’s degrees, then studied at the University of Leipzig under the influential, controversial geographer and ethnographer Friedrich Ratzel. Because she was a woman, she was not allowed to receive a Ph.D. for her work conducted at Leipzig. Her work raised awareness about human geography, which she described as “the changing relationship between the unresting man and the unstable earth.” She was also instrumental in promoting early theories of environmental determinism, now largely discredited by geographers, as it was used to justify ethnic and racial pseudoscience. Her two geography textbooks were widely used by countless students in the early 20th century. Her first book, American History and its Geographic Condition, published in 1903, brought her national recognition.\n\nCharles R. Dryer\n\n“The eclectic life of Charles Redway Dryer began in Victor, New York, with his birth on August 31, 1850,” says an unnamed biographer in the note on his collected papers at Indiana State University. Raised in upstate New York, he graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., in 1871, subsequently working as a school teacher, law clerk, and doctor (although he apparently never practiced medicine). After a stint in the Indiana Geological Service, he joined the faculty at the Indiana State Normal School, and became a professor of geography and geology at the Terre Haute School, where he taught for 20 years. He resigned his post in 1913 but remained a prolific scholar, publishing more than 250 books, articles, and pamphlets, including many for education. “The distribution of ideas and emotions is as truly a part of geography as that of rainfall or corn crops,” he once wrote.\n\nMark Jefferson\n\nMark Jefferson’s career began in astronomy. After working at Argentina’s Observatorio Nacional for six years, he became a high school teacher, principal, and superintendent in his home state of Massachusetts. He earned his master’s degree from Harvard University, “then a Mecca for young geographers,” under the influence of William Morris Davis, according to Jefferson’s former student Isaiah Bowman. Following the devastation of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Jefferson the chief cartographer of the American Delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Jefferson and his team created as many as 5,000 maps to chart Europe’s shared values, commerce, language families, and natural features in the hopes that this would help envision peace for the continent. Jefferson was also the head of the geography department at Michigan State Normal College (MSNC), now Eastern Michigan University (EMU), from 1901-1939, and offered one of the nation’s first college courses in urban geography. A building was named for him on campus in 1967.\n\nRollin D. Salisbury\n\nAmerican geologist and educator Rollin Salisbury was an academic prodigy in his youth, completing his studies at the Whitewater State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisc., in just over two years instead of four. He joined the faculty of Beloit College immediately after receiving his bachelor’s degree from the school in 1881. He became chair of the geology department just three years later. He served on the U.S. Geological Survey from 1882 onwards. In 1892 he was one of the scholars on the Peary Relief Expedition to Greenland. From 1899 until his death, he served as dean of the Ogden Graduate School of Science at the University of Chicago, where he organized the first notable department of geography in the U.S. in 1903."
