        "text": "Two of CarePoint Health’s three Hudson County hospitals have been approved by the state Department of Health to transition to a nonprofit entity, but the third remains “under consideration,” state officials said.\n\nThe applications for certificate of need for the ownership of Hoboken University Medical Center and Bayonne Medical Center to be transferred to recently formed CarePoint Health System were signed off by Department of Health (DOH) Commissioner Judith M. Persichilli on March 20. Each approval came with nearly two dozen stipulations regarding issue like financial transparency and patient care.\n\nThe application by Christ Hospital in Jersey City, is still under review.\n\n“CarePoint Health System is grateful and excited to have received final state approval for the transition of Hoboken University Medical Center and Bayonne Medical Center to a nonprofit entity, and we expect that Christ Hospital’s approval will follow in the coming days,” said CarePoint Health System spokesman Phil Swibinski.\n\nCarePoint officials noted that the transition to nonprofit status “opens up a wide array of funding and grant opportunities to support Hudson County’s underserved patients,” including eligibility for additional state funding.\n\nThe 11-page approvals also noted that CarePoint Health violated state regulations when ownership of the hospitals were donated from Vivek Garapalli and Jeffrey Lawler to the newly formed nonprofit CarePoint Health System without the DOH’s approval.\n\n“Therefore, the department will consider further action under separate review,” Persichilli wrote. “The department determined that it is in the best interest of the affected communities to continue to process this application while reserving the right to assess penalties at a later date.”\n\nUnder the terms of the approval, the CarePoint Health System board of trustees — currently William Pelino, the hospital’s former chief financial officer; Dr. Achintya Moulick, the hospital’s current chief executive officer and Ryan Meeuf, former chief information officer of the hospital — would add three community members, one to represent each hospital.\n\nThe approval of the Bayonne Medical Center for nonprofit status would appear to clear the way for the BMC Hospital LLC to purchase an additional 39.1% of the hospital, which would bring its ownership to just under 50%.\n\nThe approval letters noted that the hospitals “has committed to retaining all (its) current employees when the transfer of ownership is completed” and that the hospitals do not “anticipate any changes in the current contracts with professional staff subsequent to this change of ownership.”\n\nIn the end, the commissioner said that the denial of the applications “could adversely affect patients” in the Hudson County community, including the indigent and uninsured."
