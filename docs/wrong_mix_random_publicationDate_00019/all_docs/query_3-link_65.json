        "text": "Each state has different requirements for forming a limited liability company (LLC). Whether you are starting a business or incorporating a business already in existence, you'll want to understand the New Jersey LLC formation requirements.\n\nHow to start an LLC in New Jersey\n\nStarting a new business comes with a variety of challenges. The following highlights some of the critical steps needed to keep your business compliant if you decide to form a New Jersey LLC. For more information on forming an LLC for your business, view our webinar “What You Need to Know When Deciding Whether to Register Your Small Business”.\n\nDecide on a name for your LLC\n\nNaming your LLC is an important step that needs to be considered carefully. There are many business and compliance requirements to weigh when making the final decision on your LLC’s name.\n\nGenerally, your name cannot be the same as the name of any entity on file with the New Jersey Division of Revenue & Enterprise Services, and it can’t be misleading. Read our article for more tips on naming your business.\n\nBizFilings offer a free state name check to help you check the availability of your desired LLC name and we can help you reserve your name when you’ve made your decision.\n\nDetermine management structure (member vs. manager)\n\nOne of the reasons you may have selected an LLC as your business type is the management structure. LLCs can have one of two management structures: member-managed, or manager-managed. The difference between the two comes down to the relationship between management and ownership:\n\nIf an LLC is member-managed, then all members are active in the decision-making processes.\n\nIf an LLC is manager-managed, then one or more managers are designated to make the decisions on its behalf. A manager may be a member or a non-member.\n\nWhen starting your LLC, it is critical to understand how you plan to manage your business. Read our article LLC members vs. LLC managers for more information on LLC management structure.\n\nSelect your registered agent\n\nA registered agent (also often referred to as agent for service of process) is a person or business you appoint to receive and forward to you important legal and tax information. New Jersey requires an LLC to appoint and continually maintain a registered agent located in the state. BizFilings includes this service in all incorporation packages.\n\nPrepare and file with New Jersey\n\nCreating your LLC in New Jersey requires you to initially submit a Public Records Filing for New Business Entity with the Corporate Filing Unit of the NJ Division of Revenue & Enterprise Services. Then within 60 days of forming your LLC, you must file a Business Registration form.\n\nNew Jersey does not require you to submit an Operating Agreement to form your LLC. However, it is important for every LLC to have an Operating Agreement, establishing the rules and structure of the business. The Operating Agreement is a private agreement and is not filed with the state. Read our article on LLC operating agreements for more information.\n\nObtain a federal employer identification number\n\nA Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN or Tax ID) is an IRS identification number used for businesses. The most common comparison is to an individual’s Social Security Number. The EIN must be obtained by LLCs to be used when filing taxes. However, it is also often used for other important business activities, such as opening a business bank account, obtaining a loan, or paying invoices. Check out our article on Federal EIN for more information.\n\nMeet your license and permit requirements\n\nYour LLC may be required to obtain licenses and permits before it can legally operate in New Jersey. There are many factors that go into determining which licenses and permits at the federal, state, and local levels are required for your business. For example, if you plan to hire employees, you may need a payroll tax registration and depending on where they are based that could have implications as well. Read our article “Understanding business licenses” for more information.\n\nCost to form a New Jersey LLC\n\nAt BizFilings, we clearly outline our fees and the New Jersey state fees. When you view our pricing to form an LLC you plainly see:"
