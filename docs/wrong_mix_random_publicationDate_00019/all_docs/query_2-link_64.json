        "text": "In memory of revered concert pianist and music faculty member emerita Jean Wentworth, her family has made a generous gift to establish the Jean Wentworth Music Residency.\n\nWell known as a Debussy scholar, Jean Wentworth was also highly respected for her performances of solo, chamber, and orchestral works by Debussy, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Bartok, and many more. She taught piano, chamber music, and music history at the College for more than 40 years. The Jean Wentworth Music Residency will bring performing musicians of distinction to campus to work with students in program areas of music and beyond, and to offer cross-disciplinary engagement and audience building. Each semester, the residency will culminate in a concert open to all students, the campus community, and the public.\n\nSarah Lawrence has gratefully received a generous commitment of $3 million to support the Barbara Walters Campus Center, made anonymously in memory of literature and writing faculty member emeritus Joseph Papaleo ’49 by one of his former students.\n\nJoe Papaleo was a prolific and widely published writer of fiction and poetry who received numerous awards for his work, including an American Book Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He also translated Eugenio Montale and Dario Fo into English. For more than 30 years, he led the College’s writing program and served as a beloved mentor and friend to generations of Sarah Lawrence students. The Barbara Walters Campus Center’s magnificent open atrium, designed to connect the north and south ends of the Sarah Lawrence campus, will be named in his honor.\n\nAn alumna and her spouse have designated a $10 million portion of their estate to establish the Lydia and Veselin Kesich Endowed Scholarship Fund in memory of the alumna’s dons.\n\nLydia Kesich taught Russian (1970–1993) and her husband, Veselin, taught comparative religion (1966–1986). To strengthen socioeconomic diversity at the College, the scholarship fund will give preference to international students, students who are first-generation Americans, and students who are first in their family to attend college.\n\nSarah Lawrence has been awarded a $2 million grant from New York State’s Higher Education Capital Matching Grant Program (HECap) in support of the Barbara Walters Campus Center.\n\nEstablished in 2005, the HECap Program provides matching grants to finance capital projects and equipment purchases by independent institutions of higher learning in New York State to enhance programmatic offerings or student life at the college or to provide economic development benefits to the area surrounding the college campus."
