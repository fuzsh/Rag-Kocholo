        "text": "THE COMIC ART OF DARIO FO\n\nRON JENKINS\n\n\"The clown has taken the place of the Pope,” laughs Dario Fo as he surveys the exhibition of his artwork in a deconsecrated fifteenth-century church. He strolls gleefully around a Harlequin that sits on a throne in the center of the church beneath an effigy of the Pope that hangs suspended from the ceiling in an undignified pose. On first glance, one might imagine that the Pope is ascending toward heaven, but a closer inspection reveals another joke: the flying Pope is wearing Fo’s face, a memento of the 1991 satirical play in which Fo played the part of a pontiff embroiled in drug dealing and corruption. The real Pope has been thrown out of the church completely and banished to hell in a satiric monologue being performed later that evening by Fo’s wife, Franca Rame. Written by Fo, the monologue recounts a Dantesque voyage to the underworld, where Rame finds the head of the Vatican consorting with crooked politicians while starving children ask for food. Shocked to find the Holy Father in hell, Rame is informed reassuringly by the devils that he’s only visiting.\n\nFo uses laughter to turn the world upside down, to give power to the powerless, and to ridicule the sacred cows of authority. The absurd reversals in Fo’s comic theater are echoed in the fanciful ironies of his paintings, sketches, and scenic designs. His visual and verbal skills conspire to construct a delightfully subversive vision of Italian politics, culture, and religion. The sixty-seven-year-old Italian master began his career as a student of painting and architecture, but went on to gain international acclaim as a comic actor, satirist, and playwright. Dozens of his plays have been translated into over thirty languages and he is now Italy’s most frequently produced living playwright. While he is recognized primarily as a performer and writer, Fo’s drawings and watercolors reveal the visual foundations of his comic art. The play of color, composition, and perspective in his artwork mirrors the tricks of character, narrative, and point of view he uses to seduce his audiences from the stage.\n\nFo attributes his story-telling techniques to the medieval Italian troubadors known as giullari, these comic minstrels traveled from one town piazza to another performing Bible stories and historical chronicles. Fo’s intimate and irreverent style helped to humanize the gospels for audiences of peasants whose lives were distant from the formalities of the Roman Catholic Church. Fo believes that these popularized unofficial versions of Bible lore were influenced by medieval folk paintings of religious subjects, and that the painters were in turn influenced by folk processions of religious mystery plays. He has studied all these arts in an effort to re-create the effects achieved by the giullari. It is, in a way, the theatrical equivalent of cinematic montage.\n\nFo uses laughter to turn the world upside down, to give power to the powerless, and to ridicule the sacred cows of authority. The absurd reversals in Fo’s comic theater are echoed in the fanciful ironies of his paintings. . . .\n\n“When painters tell a story, they are outside language,” explains Fo. “They don’t show the perspective of only one person. They show diverse points of view. In the sacred presentations of the mystery plays in the Middle Ages, people would play a variety of scenes from the life of Christ, showing the actions of Jesus, the Madonna, the devils, etcetera. And when the painters designed their religious frescoes, they mechanically re-created the things that they had seen in the theater of the religious festivals. The painters show the processions as they are seen from different points of view: the same scene from behind, from the front, from a distance. The techniques of cinema were not born with the invention of the camera. They have been used by painters and storytellers for hundreds of years.”\n\nFo’s first solo masterpiece on the stage made direct reference to his medieval predecessors. Entitled Mistero Buffo (Comic mystery play), the 1968 stage piece is an epic representation of the gospels, in which one man plays all the parts. When Fo recounts the resurrection of Lazarus, for example, he demystifies the event by presenting it from the viewpoint of the masses. Jesus becomes a peripheral character as Fo shows the reactions of the peasants and working people who have come to the graveyard to watch the miracle. Working solo, he becomes the characters in the surging crowd: the sardine vendor hawking refreshments, the worm-infested corpse, and the gamblers taking odds on the miracle’s chances of success. When it was broadcast on Italian national television in 1977, Mistero Buffo was declared blasphemous by the Vatican and Fo was banned from state television for the next eight years.\n\nMistero Buffo employs the shifting points of view Fo discovered in medieval frescoes, but the relationship between Fo’s paintings and performances can be seen most clearly in his newest epic, Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas. Padan is an imaginary character inspired by Fo’s readings of fifteenthand sixteenth-century diaries written by European explorers of the New World. As he began imagining Padan’s adventures as a con man, shaman, and New World igiullare, Fo outlined his story in pictures rather than words.\n\n“These drawings are not illustrations of the story,” emphasizes Fo. “They are the story as it existed before it had ever been told.” The sketches are a visual record of Fo’s imagination as his story was taking shape in words and movement. As he speaks about the pictures, Fo’s supple body mimics the curves he has painted on the page. “One sketch shows the Indians dancing for joy,” says Fo. “It looks like lots of different people dancing, but I become each one of them when I act out the scene onstage. ” Fo dances all the shapes in the collective celebration by himself, a one-man bacchanalia whose rubbery limbs display the same freedom expressed in the willowy forms of his painting.\n\nWatching Fo perform the story in the theater, the audience is struck by its unique pictorial style. Alone on the stage, without props or costumes, Fo creates a panoramic landscape of shipwrecks, warfare, feasting, treachery, and magic. When the Italian sailor Padan teaches the Native Americans to frighten the Spanish conquistadores with fireworks, Fo paints the illusion of a pyrotechnic display in the sky with nothing but the explosive sounds of his voice and the quicksilver motion of his hands. The black space above his head becomes his canvas, and Fo’s fingers trace the swirling jets of light. A few minutes later he tells of the smoke signals used by the Indians to communicate across long distances. His gestures conjure up the fire, the clouds of smoke, and the Indians’ message of despair as they signal for rescue from the European invaders.\n\nThe fireworks and smoke signals that Fo conveys so vividly onstage have their origins in the drawings he made as he was piecing together the story. The sketches capture Padan’s adventures as Fo first conceived them in a visualized stream of consciousness. They depict the carnage wrought by the Spanish, the comic miracles performed by Padan, and the lush landscape of a pre-Christian America. Fo’s drawings are the fireworks of his creative process and the smoke signals of his imagination. They explode onto paper with cascading bursts of color, and float contentedly on the page. Images rise up out of one shape and dissolve into the next. For those who have seen Fo create these illusions on the stage, the sketches are startling reminders of his mercurial style of acting. For those who have never seen him perform, they offer a tantalizing glimpse into the mind of a clown."
