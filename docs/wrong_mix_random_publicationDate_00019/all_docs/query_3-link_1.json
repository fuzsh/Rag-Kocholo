        "text": "Historical company research can be conducted on businesses still in operation, as well as those that no longer exist. While there are many reasons to research a historical company, some may include wanting to:\n\nTrack or verify a business's location.\n\nDetermine whether a business is still operating.\n\nFind information on a business owner.\n\nGenerate a list of businesses or industries that were in a specific location.\n\nFind a historical map or image of a business location.\n\nWhen conducting your research, you will most likely need to piece together information from multiple sources. Below are various sources available through the New Jersey State Library and online that contain historical company information.\n\nThe amount of information available on a company will depend on it's business structure, as well as when and where it operated. Usually you will find more information for public companies, which have more federally-mandated reporting requirements than private companies.\n\nCurrent State Filings\n\nCurrently, businesses must register with NJ Department of Treasury, Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services (DORES). DORES’s Business Records Service portal allows users to search for information on businesses operating in New Jersey. While most business documents and reports can be ordered for a fee, some important information can be viewed for free.\n\nThe Business Entity Name Search allows you to look for existing registered businesses by name, keyword, or Entity ID. This search returns the business’s name, Entity ID, city, business type, and incorporation date. The following results are for The Taylor Provisions Company, maker of Taylor Pork Roll.\n\nAdditionally, within the Business Entity Documents search, you're able to see the name and year of documents on file. This information can be helpful in determining if and when changes occurred with a business. In the example below, you can see the documents filed by Bayada Home Health Care, Inc., including those filed when it changed from a for-profit corporation to a nonprofit corporation in 2019.\n\nNJ DORES's guidelines provide helpful tips for searching by name and keyword. For more information about the types of documents and reports available to order from NJ DORES, visit their Frequently Asked Questions page.\n\nCounty Clerk Filings\n\nSole proprietors and general partnerships in NJ, who don't wish to do business using their personal names, must register their trade name with the County Clerk’s Office in the county where they operate. This requirement began in 1906 with P.L.1906, c. 240 and continues today under N.J. Statute 56:1-1 et. seq..\n\nSome counties provide online access to filed Trade Name Certificates through their County Clerk Office's website. However, each county is different in how they make trade name registration information available. Information found on Trade Name Certificates includes the business's name, address, nature of the business, and the names and addresses of its owner or partners.\n\nIn some cases, articles of incorporation were also retained by the County Clerk, although this practice varies from county to county. Monmouth County is a notable example. Their Corporations & Business Names Collection, 1833-1995 finding aid provides a detailed history of the business records filed at the county level in NJ.\n\nHistorical Corporate Filings\n\nFrom colonial times until 1875, NJ businesses were incorporated through charters granted by special acts of the Legislature. An “Act Concerning Corporations”, passed on February 14, 1846, further led to businesses filing their certificates of incorporation with the Secretary of State.\n\nThe following index lists corporations filed with the Secretary of State, under general laws, from 1846-1870, and corporations chartered by the Legislature from 1693-1870, with the exception of some entity types. Pamphlet Laws (P.L.) referred to in this index can be found in the Acts of the Legislature for that year.\n\nCity Directories\n\nThe New Jersey State Library has an extensive collection of New Jersey city directories, both in print and on microfilm, dating from 1835-1988. While the contents of city directories can vary by location and year, most have a business directory that lists companies by product or industry. Businesses are also included in the alphabetical index, usually in bold face to distinguish them from individual residents. Company information found in city directories can include the name, address, proprietor, and nature of a business. Additionally, most city directories include advertisements for local businesses that may provide images and other relevant information.\n\nBelow are the advertisement and listings for William F. Taylor Barrel Co. in Newark, NJ, taken from the 1921 Elizabeth, NJ city directory. This is a great example of how an advertisement can provide additional information. This advertisement shows an image of the factory, the years the company was founded and incorporated, its telephone number, and the names and positions of its board members. Notice how this business is located in Newark but is listed in Elizabeth's city directory. This is not uncommon for businesses located close to municipal borders.\n\nImage Source: (1921). Elizabeth Directory 1921, pp. 17, 477, 653.\n\nNewspapers\n\nMany components of a newspaper, like advertisements, articles, and legal notices, can contain helpful information about a company. The New Jersey State Library provides access to many NJ newspapers in print, microfilm, and subscription databases. Our Newspapers Research Guide contains a full description of our newspaper holdings.\n\nMany newspapers are available digitally. Digitized newspapers can be valuable resources, especially when you have limited information on a company, because many are keyword searchable. Our New Jersey Digitized Historic Newspapers Research Guide can be used to locate digitized NJ newspapers by county and municipality.\n\nThe article below is from the Trenton Evening Times and was found using the NewsBank database. This article gives the details of why the Semple Rubber C ompany went into receivership in 1922.\n\nImage Source: (1922, August 10). Trenton Evening Times, p. 4.\n\nOther trade periodicals that are out of copyright have been digitized and are freely accessible online through sites like HathiTrust or Internet Archive.\n\nThe article below, from The Rubber Age, was found using HathiTrust and describes the new bloomer uniform worn by women working at Semple Rubber Co. in Trenton. A photograph of female employees wearing the new uniform accompanies the article.\n\nImage Source: (1917, July 10). The Rubber Age, p. 317.\n\nSecurity and Exchange Commission (SEC) Filings\n\nFollowing the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created in 1934. Several federal laws regulate securities to ensure that publicly traded companies honestly disclose financial and investment information. For this purpose, the SEC requires public companies to file regular reports. Companies file many different types of forms with the SEC. However, the following forms contain a wealth of business information and are good starting points when researching a company:\n\nForm 10-K - Annual report\n\nForm 10-Q - Quarterly report\n\nForm 8-K - Current report\n\nIn 1995, the SEC mandated that companies file reports electronically through their Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. EDGAR maintains a freely accessible database of SEC filings from 1994 to the present.\n\nAn annual report is a yearly statement of a company's activities and financials. While U.S. private companies may issue annual reports to their internal stakeholders, unlike publicly-traded companies, they aren't generally required by law to publicly share this information. For this reason, finding annual reports and other financial information for private companies in the United States can be very difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, public companies are required to submit annual 10-K reports to the SEC. Additionally, some companies will also issue an annual report to shareholders (ARS). An ARS is usually an illustrated booklet that contains a message from the company's leadership, an overview of the company's history and structure, and a detailed description of it's achievements from the past year. More recent annual reports can be found on company websites. Some older annual reports have been digitized and are available for free online or through subscription databases, like Mergent Archives.\n\nIn order to find information on historical companies, you may need to look outside the collections available through the New Jersey State Library or online. Libraries and historical societies local to where the company operated can be great places to start. Below are some additional resources to help you locate materials related to historical companies owned by other institutions."
