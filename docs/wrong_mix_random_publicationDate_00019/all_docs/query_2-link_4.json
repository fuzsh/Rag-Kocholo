        "text": "Dario Fo (born March 24, 1926, Leggiuno-Sangiano, Italy—died October 13, 2016, Milan) was an Italian avant-garde playwright, manager-director, and actor-mime who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997 though he often faced government censure as a theatrical caricaturist with a flair for social agitation.\n\nFo’s first theatrical experience was collaborating on satirical revues for small cabarets and theatres. He and his wife, the actress Franca Rame, produced (1962) humorous sketches on the television show Canzonissima that soon made them popular public personalities. They founded the theatre companies Campagnia Dario Fo–Franca Rame (1958), Nuova Scena (1968), and Collettivo Teatrale La Comune (1970), developing an agitprop theatre of politics, often blasphemous and scatological but rooted in the tradition of commedia dell’arte and blended with what Fo called “unofficial leftism.” With the latter troupe they began to tour factories, parks, and gymnasiums.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nFo wrote more than 80 plays, coauthoring some of them with Rame. Among his most popular plays are Morte accidentale di un anarchico (1970; Accidental Death of an Anarchist) and Non si paga, non si paga! (1974; We Can’t Pay? We Won’t Pay!). As a performer, Fo is best known for his solo tour de force Mistero Buffo (1973; “Comic Mystery”), based on medieval mystery plays but so topical that the shows changed with each audience.\n\nHis later works, some of which were written with Rame, include Tutta casa, letto e chiesa (1978; “All House, Bed, and Church”; Eng. trans. Adult Orgasm Escapes from the Zoo), Clacson, trombette, e pernacchi (1981; Trumpets and Raspberries), Female Parts (1981), Coppia aperta (1983; The Open Couple—Wide Open Even), L’uomo nudo e l’uomo in frak (1985; One Was Nude and One Wore Tails), Il papa e la strega (1989; The Pope and the Witch), Johan Padan a la descoverta de le Americhe (1992; Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas), Il diavolo con le zinne (1998; The Devil with Boobs), Lu santo jullàre Françesco (1999; Francis, the Holy Jester), and L’anomalo bicefalo (2003; The Two-Headed Anomaly).\n\nIn addition, Fo wrote two illustrated novels, La figlia del papa (2014; The Pope’s Daughter) and C’è un re pazzo in Danimarca (2015; “There Is a Mad King in Denmark”). The former was adapted as a stage play."
