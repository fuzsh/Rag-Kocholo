        "text": "The NJCU New Jersey 50 Index was created in December 2017 to track the Garden State’s top 50 companies and provide those in the financial world, researchers, journalists, and students with a barometer of the New Jersey economy.\n\nDeveloped by the NJCU School of Business in partnership with Standard & Poor’s, the NJCU New Jersey 50 Index is available under the ticker NJCU50PR. The index is a reference and perspective point as it focuses on New Jersey vs. the Dow Jones Industrial Average (30 diverse stocks) and the S&P 500. It lists the largest 50 companies that are headquartered in New Jersey and listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.\n\nThe NJCU New Jersey 50 Index will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis, and the University will note any additions or deletions from organizations comprising the Index.\n\nLink to the NJCU New Jersey 50 Index at S&P."
