        "text": "\"The Step by Step School - where every step a child takes, a new journey begins.\"\n\nApproach to Learning\n\nThe Step by Step School is the perfect place for your young learner.\n\nThe Step by Step School uses a multi-theory curriculum that encourages developmental growth, supports social-emotional skills, and promotes academic success. Our daycare and afterschool programs are aligned with local elementary schools and New Jersey State Standards.\n\nThe Step by Step School curriculum was created to provide students and their individual needs a safe environment where they are able to learn at their own pace. Utilizing this multitude of theories allows teachers to be creative in providing developmentally appropriate multi-sensory tools and strategies in the classroom to support all styles of learning; therefore, allowing children to grow emotionally, physically, and intellectually.\n\nHandwriting Without Tears (HWT) introduces gripping for our infants and pre-toddlers establishes a proper handwriting foundation for our toddlers, supports the basis for proper handwriting skills for our preschoolers, and enhances proper handwriting skills for our school-aged students. Starting at an early age, our students begin to build essential skills for emergent writing and handwriting success.\n\nThe Clover Model focuses on the social-emotional development of children of all ages and stems from an understanding that a studentâ€™s academic success is directly tied to his or her emotional well-being.\n\nMississippi Learning Standards describes the first three years of life that have a strong impact on brain development and learning. They are the foundation of healthy development and positive learning outcomes in early years, in preschool, and beyond.\n\nThe Waldorf Philosophy gives students a daily schedule to follow a consistent and creative routine.\n\nUtilizing The Play-Based Philosophy educators encourage students to learn through play and exploration.\n\nEncouraging The Cognitive-Based Philosophy supports active exploration giving opportunities to develop a positive self-concept, independency, and self-sufficiency.\n\nAbout The Step by Step School\n\nThe Step by Step School provides loving and educational childcare services through its daycare, after school, and summer camp programming.\n\nAt The Step by Step School, we take great pride in providing a safe and nurturing setting in which children can learn and play in the company of their peers and a caring staff. We foster a community-based environment where everyone is treated with respect and in which communication is a priority. Our days are filled with fun and engaging activities in which children ages six weeks and up can flourish. Our goal is to build lasting memories for our students and their parents alike.\n\nInfants 6 weeks - 15 Months\n\nThis rapid developmental period gets off to a strong start as our caregivers form a bond with your child to foster emotional security.\n\nOne-Year-Olds 15-24 months\n\nA dynamic classroom setting encourages exploration and the development of physical and socialization skills.\n\nTwo-Year-Olds 2-2.5 & 2.5-3\n\nAs your child shows greater independence, teachers ensure that individual interests are enhanced and supported. Due to the drastic developmental growth that takes place during the year 2-3, this age group is broken into a 2-2.5 classroom and a 2.5-3 classroom.\n\nPre-School 3 & 4 Year-Olds\n\nA focus on reading and writing skills helps to build a strong foundation for school success.\n\nAfter school Pre-K 3 & Pre-K 4\n\nCore basics such as reading fundamentals, science, and art, are enhanced by a changing line-up of unique enrichment programs.\n\nStep Up Afterschool: Kindergarten & Up\n\nEngaging lessons, activities, and games promote a STEAM-based curriculum in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.\n\nChoose Step by Step Daycare Center\n\nAs a parent juggling the demands of work and family life, it's essential to entrust your child to an institution that provides exceptional childcare assistance by fostering a love for learning. At The Step by Step School, we understand the intricate balance of professional and familial responsibilities. That's why we offer comprehensive programs starting from infant daycare to after-school sessions and summer camps, ensuring that your child is engaged, nurtured, and continuously challenged in a supportive environment. Our commitment to continuous professional development for our educators means that your child receives the highest quality of care and education from experienced childcare providers, allowing you to focus on your career knowing that your little one is thriving and flourishing every step of the way.\n\n\"\n\nThe staff have genuine love, energy, and passion for the kids and Step By Step program. Children and parents alike love them.\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nThe Step by Step School has been a truly excellent experience for our daughter. The Program is well-organized and communication with parents is excellent. The teachers are loving and engaging, and they make learning exciting and fun.\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nWithout hesitation, I would recommend any parent to consider Step By Step School. It is much more than an average aftercare - it's really been an extension of our son's development. He has grown so much through the program.\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\nAll the teachers at The Step By Step School are wonderfully warm and fun, and we love hearing about all the exciting and educational activities they plan for the kids.\n\n\"\n\nComing Soon:\n\nask about our new Scholarship Program!\n\nParent check-ins\n\nDownload the App"
