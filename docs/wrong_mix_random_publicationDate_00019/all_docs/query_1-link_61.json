        "text": "The launch of the Just Health Foundation is a significant step forward as we expand our efforts to provide care, particularly for the underserved and often overlooked populations in Hudson County. The foundation’s mission aligns perfectly with our vision of promoting inclusivity, social responsibility, and equitable access to high quality care and I am looking forward to what we are going to be able to accomplish through the efforts of the Just Health Foundation.” President and CEO of CarePoint Health, Achintya Moulick, MD, MBA, MCh.\n\nCarePoint Health sees amongst the largest number of uninsured patients in NJ at 50,000 and 1 in every 7th patient in the Emergency Department is uninsured. Hospitals have had very little support from the state unlike other centers, so the community NEEDS to support the community hospitals as care has become local.\n\nThe Just Health Foundation’s primary objective is to bolster the work at CarePoint Health’s hospitals and will seek to raise funds in order to enhance key areas such as the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, Center for Personalized Health, Cancer Programs, the Neighborhood Health Center, Infusion Centers, Ambulatory Center, Cardiac Rehabilitation and additional initiatives to provide greater access to compassionate and quality care to the communities being served in Hudson County and surrounding areas. Community needs should be met by Community Hospitals."
