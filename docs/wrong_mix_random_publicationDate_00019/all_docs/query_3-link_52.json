New Jersey Court Said It Would Not Dismiss Hoboken Climate Case in Deference to New Jersey’s Pending Case. A New Jersey Superior Court rejected fossil fuel industry defendants’ argument that it should dismiss the City of Hoboken’s climate change case against them because it was “nearly identical” to the State of New Jersey’s suit. The court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss on this ground. The defendants’ motion, which asserted multiple other grounds for dismissal, remains pending. 09/08/2023 Reply Download Joint reply filed in support of defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the grounds of the State's duplicative suit. 08/11/2023 Opposition Download Memorandum of law filed by plaintiff in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss on \"subsumption\" grounds. 07/07/2023 Motion to Dismiss Download Joint opening brief filed in support of defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fossil Fuel Industry Defendants Sought Dismissal of Hoboken’s Climate Case. Fossil fuel industry defendants filed a motion in New Jersey state court to dismiss the City of Hoboken’s claims seeking to hold them liable for the effects of climate change. They first argued that the court should defer to State of New Jersey’s “nearly identical” suit and dismiss the City’s suit. Second, they argued that the City’s state law claims could not be constitutionally applied to out-of-state conduct such as global emissions of greenhouse gases. Third, they contended that the Clean Air Act preempted the City’s state law claims. Fourth, they argued that the claims raised nonjusticiable political questions. Fifth, they argued that claims based on an alleged “campaign of misinformation” (as opposed to “greenwashing” claims) were barred by the statute of limitations. They also argued that the City’s complaint failed to state a claim under New Jersey law. 07/07/2023 Motion to Dismiss Download Motion to dismiss filed by BP p.l.c. and BP America Inc. 07/07/2023 Motion to Dismiss Download Anti-SLAPP special motion to dismiss filed by Chevron Corporation and Chevron U.S.A.

Hoboken Filed Suit Seeking Damages from Energy Companies for Climate Change Impacts. The City of Hoboken, New Jersey filed a lawsuit in state court asserting climate change-based claims for damages and injunctive relief against energy companies and the American Petroleum Institute. The City alleged that the defendants caused climate change-related harms through production of fossil fuels and concealment of fossil fuels’ harms. The complaint alleged that Hoboken is “uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise” and that the city was experiencing more frequent and severe storms as a result of climate change. In response to these impacts, Hoboken alleged that it had developed an adaptation and mitigation plan to address rainfall and seawater flooding that would cost more than $500 million. The complaint asserted claims of public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. The relief sought included compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages; treble damages under the Consumer Fraud Act; an order compelling the defendants to abate the alleged nuisance and to pay costs of abatement; an order enjoining future acts of trespass; and attorneys’ fees and costs. 10/12/2022 Order Download Motion to stay the mandate denied.

The defendants had argued that issuance of the mandates should be stayed to allow the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. 10/11/2022 Opposition Download Opposition filed by plaintiffs-appellees to defendants-appellants' motion to stay mandates. 10/04/2022 Letter Download Letter filed by defendants regarding citation of supplemental authorities (Supreme Court invitation to Solicitor General to submit views on certiorari petition in Boulder case). In a letter to the Third Circuit in support of its motion to stay the mandates in the City of Hoboken’s and State of Delaware’s cases, the defendants argued that the Supreme Court’s invitation to the Solicitor General to submit the U.S.'s views on the certiorari petition in the Boulder case made clear that these jurisdictional questions were “substantial.” The defendants cited an article that found that certiorari petitions were more than 46 times more likely to be granted once the Court sought the Solicitor General’s views. The defendants also cited the position the United States had previously taken in amicus briefs in Baltimore’s case and the Oakland/San Francisco case that the plaintiffs’ climate change claims were “inherently and necessarily federal in nature.” 09/30/2022 Motion Download Motion to stay the mandates filed. 09/30/2022 Order Download Petition for rehearing denied.

The defendants-appellants filed a petition for rehearing en banc in which they contended that the Third Circuit panel erred by concluding that cases “that are necessarily federal by virtue of federal common law derived from the Constitution’s structure” were not removable. The defendants argued that the panel’s decision misinterpreted Third Circuit precedent, “deepened” a circuit split, and was at odds with the position of the United States and “the teachings of the Supreme Court.” The petition for rehearing also contended that that the panel erred in giving effect to Hoboken’s and Delaware’s “artful disclaimers” that the defendants said were “designed to evade federal jurisdiction.” 08/29/2022 Order Download Motion for extension of time to file petition for rehearing granted. The Third Circuit granted a motion to extend the time to file a petition for rehearing. The deadline is September 14, 2022. 08/17/2022 Opinion Download Remand order affirmed. Third Circuit Affirmed Orders Returning Hoboken and Delaware Climate Cases to State Courts. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed remand orders in climate change cases brought by the City of Hoboken and State of Delaware against fossil fuel industry defendants. The Third Circuit found “no federal hook” that would allow the defendants to remove the state tort law actions to federal court, rejecting arguments that the state law claims were inherently federal or necessarily raised a substantial federal issue or that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or federal officer removal statute provided a basis for federal jurisdiction. The Third Circuit stated that “[c]limate change is an important problem with national and global implications” but that “federal courts cannot hear cases just because they are important.” 06/21/2022 Not Available Oral argument heard.

On November 15, 2021, fossil fuel company defendants-appellants filed their opening brief in their appeal of the remand order in the climate change lawsuit brought by the City of Hoboken, New Jersey. The defendants argued that Hoboken’s claims were based on interstate and international emissions and therefore arise under common law, that removal was also proper because Hoboken’s claims necessarily raised disputed and substantial federal issues, and that the district court had jurisdiction under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or the federal-officer removal statute."
