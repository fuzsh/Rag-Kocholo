        "text": "On average, Hoboken homeowners spend around $3,537 on foundation repair. The cost of foundation repair is based on several factors. Things like the type of repair needed, the extent of the damage, and the size of your home will all play a part. The fastest way to learn how much a job could cost is to speak with a local foundation repair expert and schedule a free inspection and estimate.\n\nTypes of foundation repair include leak repair, crack repair, stabilization, underpinning, and waterproofing.\n\nFor both leak repair and crack repair, a technician will come to your home, perform an inspection, and use various measures to remedy leaks or cracks. The cost of these procedures will vary greatly depending on the size and root cause of the problem.\n\nStabilization is the process of fixing bowing walls by inserting carbon fiber or steel strips. The cost will depend on the material chosen and how many strips are needed. The cost of underpinning also varies. This process, also called piering or leveling, involves leveling your foundation by underpinning it with concrete piers; the cost depends on how many piers are used.\n\nIf you're interested in waterproofing your foundation or basement, we suggest talking to a waterproofing specialist. This process can include outdoor waterproofing, indoor waterproofing, or both.\n\nIf you're building a new house, make sure that a soil report is completed. A soil report will contain information regarding how well your soil can support a foundation, and can offer you a heads-up about any potential future problems. If your concerns are about an existing home, for a few hundred dollars, you can get an inspection and report by a structural engineer. They can point you to any issues that could use some attention, and advise you on avoiding future problems.\n\nYou also want to make sure that the moisture around your foundation is appropriate. As Hoboken sees more rain than many other places, keep an eye on your gutters and landscaping to make sure too much water isn't getting into your soil or foundation. You should also stay vigilant for leaky gutters or pipes and repair them quickly.\n\nWe recommend that you do not put off a foundation repair project. A seemingly small issue may have an underlying cause that could potentially result in future problems, and it's better to get ahead of the issue as soon as possible. A minor problem now could turn into a large and expensive one in the future if left untreated."
