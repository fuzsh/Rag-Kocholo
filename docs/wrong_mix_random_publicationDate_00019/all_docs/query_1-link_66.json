        "text": "The Montclair State University Foundation, Inc. was created in 1960 by alumni and friends to provide financially for the educational needs of Montclair State. The Foundation is a separate not-for-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation established under the laws of the State of New Jersey. It has been designated by the Board of Trustees of Montclair State University to solicit, receive, hold and manage funds and property on behalf of the University.\n\nSince its inception, Montclair State University Foundation has received contributions from alumni, businesses, corporations, private foundations, and other friends engaged in educational philanthropy. The Foundation endowment is valued in excess of $50 million. The Foundation ensures professional management and stewardship of contributions to support specific programs and projects at Montclair State University and maintains strict adherence to the donor’s philanthropic intentions.\n\nThe Foundation provides support for University fundraising and capital campaigns, sponsors more than 350 annual scholarships and underwrites a variety of programs to reward excellent teaching and scholarship. The Foundation’s annual grants fund start-up costs of worthy programs in both the academic area and student life, improve facilities, and cover costs of special, unanticipated opportunities that would otherwise go unrealized.\n\nWhen you support higher education by making a gift to Montclair State University, you are investing in the future. A gift of any size to the Montclair State University Foundation is a significant way of acknowledging the University’s efforts to help its students meet the needs of an increasingly complex society."
