        "text": "A Hudson County hospital system with a history of questionable business practices and corporate turf battles is facing new scrutiny after state regulators raised concerns about the financial stability of its Hoboken flagship.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health late last month warned local and state lawmakers that CarePoint’s Hoboken University Medical Center has been operating at a loss this year and now has less than a month of cash on hand, a critical measure of a hospital’s financial stability. Nationwide, nonprofit hospitals had an average of 216 days of cash on hand last summer, according to Beckers Hospital Review, although industry reports suggest acute care facilities in New Jersey have traditionally held somewhat lower cash reserves.\n\nThe medical center’s financial distress is considered a “high concern” to state regulators, according to the Health Department’s Oct. 20 letter, which was first reported by the Hudson County View.\n\nIn addition, for the second year in a row, CarePoint requested an advance on its charity care funds for all three hospitals, “citing cash flow and other financial issues,” the letter notes.\n\nThe system also owns Jersey City’s Christ Hospital and Bayonne Medical Center. So far this year the state has provided more than $10 million from the charity care pool, a mix of state and federal money hospitals receive to offset the cost of treating uninsured and under-insured patients.\n\nState law requires acute care hospitals to provide all necessary care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Hospitals then petition the state’s charity care program to cover these costs and are awarded payments based on a formula that considers the volume of uninsured patients, the type of care provided, regional demographics and other factors.\n\nIs charity care the issue?\n\nOfficials with CarePoint — which converted from for-profit to not-for-profit status in recent years partly to access new revenue streams — said more state funding is needed for the three hospitals to continue to serve patients who lack insurance.\n\nCarePoint spokesperson Philip Swibinski said that this year the three hospitals will treat more than 50,000 uninsured patients, generating a charity care tab of at least $110 million and a burden he called “unsustainable” without additional funds.\n\n“CarePoint will keep working with Hudson County’s state legislators, elected officials and community leaders to ensure that every possible step is taken to support the critical work being done every day in these safety net hospitals,” Swibinski said. “Not being able to provide care to desperate people in need would be a tragic outcome that no one should want to see, but it could become the reality if CarePoint does not receive the financial support it needs.”\n\nNew Jersey hospitals rarely receive enough charity care funding to cover all their uncompensated care costs.\n\nIt is not clear if other New Jersey hospitals are facing similar financial struggles. A Health Department spokesperson said that warning letters related to other hospitals have been issued to elected officials this year but declined to elaborate. Only one other hospital requested a charity care advance, according to the department.\n\nHoboken officials deferred comment to CarePoint. State Sen. Brian Stack and Assembly members Annette Chaparro and Raj Mukherji (all D-Hudson) either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment last week through their Trenton offices.\n\nSurvival on the line, lawmaker says\n\nBut in a statement to other news outlets, Mukherji said that without tens of millions in additional state support the “hospital system’s survival is jeopardized.” Chaparro said Christ Hospital is also struggling financially, according to NJ.com.\n\n“The current situation should surprise no one,” Mukherji told The Jersey Journal in late October. “In terms of the percentage of charity care and Medicaid patients, this system endures more than any other in the state. It is not sustainable without state and federal support.”\n\nHealth Department records, while a few years old, suggest CarePoint’s charity care burden is far from extreme. And between 2020 and 2022 the state provided more than $65 million to the Hudson County system to help offset these unfunded costs.\n\nWhat state audits show\n\nThe most recently available state-audited data for all 72 of New Jersey’s acute care facilities, from 2020, shows 14 hospitals provided more free care than Hoboken did that year. Hoboken University Medical Center provided just under $9 million in charity care that year, according to the report. Christ Hospital was 23rd on the list and submitted $6.5 million in claims, while Bayonne, with under $2 million in claims, ranked 47th. Charity-care claims declined statewide that year as the COVID-19 pandemic derailed much of hospitals’ regular business.\n\nCarePoint aggressively tried to expand its footprint in Hudson County and elsewhere in north Jersey and butted heads with other hospital systems in the process.\n\nGiven the limited funding pool, public charity care funds generally cover just under half of the uncompensated care claims submitted by New Jersey hospitals. Between the 2020 and 2022 fiscal years — the years for which the most recent information is available — Hoboken received roughly $33.2 million in state and federal funds, while Christ Hospital got around $31.5 million, and Bayonne received almost $1.9 million.\n\nAs a comparison, in 2022 alone, Newark’s University Hospital — the state’s only public hospital and a key safety net for much of Essex County — was allocated the most charity care, $62.7 million. St. Joseph’s Medical Center in Paterson, with one of the busiest emergency rooms in the state, got the second-highest payment, at $40.5 million. Jefferson Stratford Hospital, in suburban Camden County, received the lowest charity care payment last year at $291,000.\n\nCarePoint leaders, who purchased the three Hudson County hospitals between 2008 and 2012, have long argued that if they didn’t rescue these operations from bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy, patients would have lost critical care options.\n\nTurf battles\n\nSince then, CarePoint has become enmeshed in various battles over payments and market share, several of which resulted in litigation. The system worked for years to receive not-for-profit status, a process that required principal owner Vivek Garipalli to donate his interest in the three facilities to the new entity, according to media reports. The nonprofit is headed by cardiac surgeon and entrepreneur Dr. Achintya Moulick.\n\n‘Whether a non-profit or a for-profit institution, there must be accountability of our hospitals to ensure profits are invested in healthcare services.’ — Debbie White, Health Professionals and Allied Employees union\n\nSwibinski said CarePoint is “actively working to enhance its financial position” through a new philanthropic arm and is pursuing endowments, partnerships and other revenue possibilities. “The mission that these hospitals strive to follow every day is to care for the needy, and unfortunately that is unsustainable without both philanthropy and state support,” he said.\n\nIn 2015 the system claimed in a federal lawsuit that Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey — the state’s largest health insurance company, with more than 3 million policy holders — owed it $76 million in unpaid claims. Horizon said this figure was greatly inflated. The two parties settled in 2017, when Horizon agreed to include CarePoint’s hospitals in its network of providers.\n\nBy then CarePoint was aggressively trying to expand its footprint in Hudson County and elsewhere in north Jersey and butting heads with other hospital systems in the process. In the years to come CarePoint would announce a deal to sell two of its three facilities to RWJBarnabas Health, one of the state’s largest hospital systems which operates several facilities that compete with CarePoint hospitals.\n\nThe deal eventually fell apart and in 2022 CarePoint filed a federal lawsuit accusing RWJBarnabas of antitrust violations and colluding with other stakeholders to harm CarePoint’s business. The litigation is ongoing, Swibinski said.\n\nConsulting and management fees\n\nIn 2019 the State Commission of Investigation reported that CarePoint’s three hospitals had paid $157 million in consulting and management fees to companies that essentially funneled the money to the company’s three principal owners. The SCI did not allege anything illegal but suggested the state needed better tools to oversee the complex finances of hospital systems.\n\nLawmakers soon proposed several bills to strengthen state oversight and the Health Department separately took steps to require greater financial disclosure from hospitals. By the spring of 2019 Health Department officials were speaking with CarePoint leaders about the health system’s finances on a near-weekly basis, officials told lawmakers at a budget hearing in April.\n\nThe Health Department’s October letter notes CarePoint has failed in recent years to comply with these disclosure requirements. The system recently filed audited financial forms for 2020 and 2021, which the Health Department letter notes were delayed “due to internal issues” with their auditor. CarePoint has yet to file 2022 documents and is behind on other reporting, according to the state. Swibinski, the spokesperson, declined to comment on the delays.\n\nThe ongoing financial struggles — and CarePoint’s reporting delays — underscore the need for careful hospital oversight, according to Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union, the largest health-care labor group in New Jersey, which has long advocated for greater hospital transparency. White, who raised concerns about layoffs at CarePoint hospitals in the summer of 2019, urged state officials to continue to monitor the status of these facilities and intervene if needed to protect the hospitals and their patients.\n\n“Our hospitals are an essential asset in our communities. Whether a non-profit or a for-profit institution, there must be accountability of our hospitals to ensure profits are invested in healthcare services,” White said last week. “The public deserves to know that their community hospitals will remain financially solvent and that they will continue to have access to quality healthcare.”"
