        "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 1, 2001 — ISO, a leading property and casualty insurance information company, has moved its international headquarters to the Newport World Business Center in the Pavonia-Newport section here.\n\nFor the first time in its 30-year history, ISO unites more than 1,400 employees formerly based in Manhattan, Pearl River, N. Y., and Rahway, N.J., in the new 22-story ISO Building.\n\nEffective today, all facets of ISO's operations — analytical, actuarial, statistical, product-development, marketing and information technology — will reside under one roof.\n\nISO's new main telephone number is (201) 469-2000. All ISO toll-free numbers and e-mail addresses remain the same. ISO's new mailing address is:\n\nInsurance Services Office, Inc.\n\n545 Washington Boulevard\n\nJersey City, N.J. 07310-1686\n\nThe location of ISO's regional offices throughout the country are not affected by the home-office move.\n\nPlanned in 1999, the move will vastly improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, and significantly lower real-estate expenses.\n\nThe 788,384-square-foot, 22-story ISO Building is a granite and aluminum structure that features a double-vaulted marble lobby with a two-story atrium. The office tower is equipped with the most advanced dual fiber-optic telecommunications system in the metropolitan area to meet ISO's demand for a high-technology environment.\n\nIn relocating to Jersey City, ISO joins numerous Fortune 500 companies — including PaineWebber, J. P. Morgan Chase & Co., U.S. Trust, and Cigna.\n\nISO, a privately held corporation, is a leading source of information, products and services related to property and liability risk. For a broad spectrum of commercial and personal lines of insurance, ISO provides statistical, actuarial, underwriting and claims information and analyses; consulting and technical services; policy language; and information about specific locations. In the United States and around the world, ISO serves insurance and reinsurance carriers, agents, brokers, self-insured entities, risk managers and insurance regulators and other government bodies.\n\nRelease: Immediate"
