        "text": "Avocado Mattress® was cofounded in 2015 by Jeff D'Andrea, Dan D'Andrea, Jay Decker, and Mark Abrials. Avocado Mattress was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, where we maintain our corporate offices and original Experience Center right across from the Hoboken PATH station. Before Covid-19, most of our design, creative, marketing, and customer experience teams are also headquartered in Hoboken.\n\nIn 2018, Avocado Mattress completed a merger with Brentwood Home®, which has been making luxury, non-toxic mattresses in California since 1987. Vy Nguyen is the second-generation owner and CEO of Brentwood Home.\n\nThe new top-level corporate entity formed is Avocado Green Brands™ and remains privately held. Avocado Brands owns a growing portfolio of allied brands that share a singular mission — to foster socially conscious lifestyles that share a profound responsibility for our planet.\n\nAvocado Brands also owns the factories in Los Angeles that proudly make our eco-luxury mattress, bedding, and furniture products by hand. We currently have a 32-acre footprint with nearly 750,000 square feet of manufacturing and production space in Orange County, Los Angeles. We also maintain a growing number of retail stores. We also have facilities in Tecate, Mexico.\n\nAvocado Green Mattress — the #1 rated mattress brand in America, proudly made from natural, certified organic, and non-toxic materials. GOTS, GOLS, FSC® (C156318), Fair Trade, and Climate Neutral Certified®.\n\nBrentwood Home – is one of the most reputable and trusted manufacturers of mattresses, bedding, and home essentials, with a focus on natural, recycled, and alternative materials."
