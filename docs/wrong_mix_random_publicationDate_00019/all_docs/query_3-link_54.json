        "text": "The Office of the State Auditor, which is in the legislative branch of government, was originally established in 1934 pursuant to P.L. 1933, c.295. A number of statutory amendments dealing with the powers and duties of the State Auditor were enacted in the ensuing years. The Office of the State Auditor is within the Office of Legislative Services under the provisions of the Legislative Services Act.\n\nThe State Auditor is a constitutional officer appointed by the Legislature for a term of five years and until a successor shall be appointed and qualified. On February 23, 2021, Mr. David J. Kaschak was confirmed by a joint session of the Legislature as the State Auditor.\n\nThe organization of the office within the legislative branch permits the State Auditor to be independent of the executive and judicial branches of government. This independence is critical in terms of meeting professional standards and in providing fair and objective reviews and audits of governmental operations.\n\nUnder the provisions of Article VII, Section I, Paragraph 6 of the State Constitution and N.J.S.A. 52:24-1 et seq., the Office of the State Auditor is required to conduct post-audits of all transactions and accounts kept by or for all departments, offices, and agencies of state government. Reports are submitted to the Governor, the Legislature, and the Executive Director of the Office of Legislative Services.\n\nThe Public Laws of 2006, Chapter 82 authorized the State Auditor to conduct a performance review of any program of any accounting agency, any independent authority, or any public entity or grantee that receives state funds. The law also requires the State Auditor to conduct a follow-up review to determine agency compliance with our audit recommendations. In addition, at the request of the legislative leadership or the Legislative Services Commission, the State Auditor conducts studies on the operation of state and state-supported agencies with respect to their efficiency, internal management control, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nAddress:\n\n125 South Warren St.\n\nP.O. Box 067\n\nTrenton, NJ 08625-0067\n\nTelephone:\n\n609-847-3470\n\nFinancial Audits\n\nFinancial audits are designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of an audited entity are fairly presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The primary financial audit conducted by the office is the state’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which is published by the Department of the Treasury. In addition, we also publish the Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards, which is an integral part of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report opinion audit. We have also issued a special report related to fund balances as of June 30, 2022 in accordance with statutory requirements. Four other financial audits were issued in calendar year 2022.\n\nPerformance Audits\n\nThe objectives of this type of audit are to determine whether financial transactions are related to an agency’s programs, are reasonable, and are recorded properly in the accounting systems. This type of audit may also focus on specific performance issues. Where appropriate, these engagements may also provide economy and efficiency comments. Audits are selected using a risk-based approach. Larger departments are audited on a divisional, agency, or program basis rather than on a department-wide basis because of their size and complexity. We completed nine performance audits in calendar year 2020. These audits encompassed $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion of expenditures and revenues, respectively.\n\nInformation Technology Audits\n\nThe objectives of this type of audit are to determine whether the data maintained by a particular computer system is reliable, valid, safeguarded, and recorded properly; whether agency networks are properly managed to provide for business continuity and the prevention of system abuse; and whether system development and maintenance is performed in accordance with guidelines and best practices.\n\nThe office has trained all audit staff on the basics of integrated auditing, where non-IT field auditors learn how to review IT controls while performing other audits. If the system they are reviewing has more complex controls, an IT auditor can be consulted or the system itself can be assigned to the IT unit as a separate audit. This effort will allow for review of a greater number of IT controls.\n\nSchool District Audits\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:7F-6d authorizes the Office of the State Auditor to audit the accounts and financial transactions of any school district in which the state aid equals 80 percent or more of its net budget for the year. In addition, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 18A:7A-57, the State Auditor is authorized to perform a forensic audit of school districts with a general fund deficit and meeting additional specific criteria as stated in the statute. We audited two school districts in calendar year 2022.\n\nLegislative Requests\n\nReporting will include assurances on the financial operations of the state."
