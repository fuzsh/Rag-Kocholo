        "text": "by Redazione , published on 12/02/2022\n\nCategories: Museums / Disclaimer\n\nWith an investment of 7.7 million euros, the city of Pesaro is preparing to open a museum entirely dedicated to Dario Fo and Franca Rame. It will be based in the Rocca Costanza.\n\nA museum dedicated to Dario Fo and Franca Rame will be created in Pesaro. The official go-ahead for the operation was given by Culture Minister Dario Franceschini with the allocation of 2.35 million euros to redevelop the spaces of Rocca Costanza, which will become home to the museum. The new resources are in addition to the 5.4 million already announced in December, stemming from the agreement between the Agenzia del Demanio, the General Directorate of Archives of the MiC and the Municipality of Pesaro to enhance the building in order to host the museum, which will also be a venue for live performances. In all, an investment of 7.7 million euros to create the first and so far only museum dedicated to the couple.\n\nThe museum dedicated to the 1997 Nobel Laureate in Literature and the great actress and playwright, companions in work and life, finds a place in Pesaro because Fo and Rame habitually frequented the area and trod the stage of the Pesaro Theater numerous times, but they also had close relationships with the Rossini Opera Festival, the Fano Carnival and the University Theater of Urbino. The museum’s time frame will be quite long, the Pesaro City Council anticipates. With the establishment of the museum, which will complement the Rossini National Museum and the National Motorcycle Museum, Pesaro, which is a finalist for the title of Italian Capital of Culture 2024, also hopes to have a few more chances for the final victory. “Our plan,” deputy mayor Daniele Vimini explained, “is to create a cultural network of medium-sized cities, capable of presenting the best of tourism and cultural offerings in Italy to the world.”\n\nThe venue in which the museum will take shape, Rocca Costanza, is an imposing fortress built between 1474 and 1483, named after Costanzo Sforza, who designed it: the purpose of the fortification was to improve the city’s defensive system. In 1864 it became a prison, and remained so until 1989. Today it is used as a venue for events, concerts, performances.\n\n“Dario Fo and Franca Rame,” says Pesaro Mayor Matteo Ricci, along with Culture Councillor Daniele Vimini, “were an extraordinary couple. A point of reference for the world of culture. An example of civic and political commitment. It will be a privilege to host a piece of our country’s history in Pesaro.”\n\n“We are happy to learn this news, in recent months we have been working with the city administration on this project convinced that the city of Pesaro is the right location for the museum dedicated to Dario and Franca,” says Mattea Fo, president of the Fo Rame Foundation. Who adds, “We began our collaboration with the City of Pesaro when two years ago the City Council decided to title the court of Palazzo Mazzolari Mosca to Dario and Franca. During that event we felt welcomed and appreciated the affection shown toward my grandparents, as well as the surprise in discovering how vivid was the memory of Dario and Franca’s stay in Pesaro while directing Rossini operas for the ROF. The administration of Pesaro was willing to think concretely about the project, and so we were able to identify a location that would give due prominence to a precious heritage and unite the needs of preservation, protection and enhancement of the immense variety of materials preserved in the Fo Rame Archive. Without neglecting the importance of exhibition spaces, which are indispensable for creating a true dialogue between archives and museum. In recent months we have been working on this project convinced that in Pesaro the Fo Rame Museum could have a future. We would like to thank all those who collaborated in reaching this solution, especially Minister Franceschini, Mayor Ricci and Deputy Mayor Vimini.”\n\nA museum dedicated to Dario Fo and Franca Rame will be created in Pesaro."
