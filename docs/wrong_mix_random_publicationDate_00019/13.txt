On the first Saturday of every month watch your children laugh, sing, dance and be entertained by professional magicians, puppeteers, theatre troupes and more. One Saturday children may be flapping their wings to a song or petting a parrot. On another Saturday they may be creating characters from Snow White out of balloons.

The Hoboken Public Library distributes Community Care Kits to help serve individual needs. Friends & Foundation funds the purchase of care kits that contain essential relief items, including hygiene kits, period kits, code blue kits, & life-saving kits.

These kits are distributed based on need to Hoboken community members.

The oral history project was initiated in 2000 to capture, through the recollections of longtime residents, the working-class identity and tradition of multi-ethnic living that has been disappearing as Hoboken has gentrified. These stories have been turned into a series of "chapbooks". The books are produced by the Hoboken Historical Museum and partially funded by Hoboken Public Library Friends & Foundation.

Visit the Historical Museumâ€™s website to read these Hoboken stories.
