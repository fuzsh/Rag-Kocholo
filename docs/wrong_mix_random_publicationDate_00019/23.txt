The Hoboken Public Library Friends & Foundation is passionate about the role our library plays in our community. And we are excited and determined to extend the reach of the library through fundraising, volunteer and program support, and advocacy.

Formed by the union of two like-minded organizations, our legacy includes supporting library programs like free museum passes and Family FUNday, and vital capital funding for library restoration and the new childrenâ€™s reading room.
