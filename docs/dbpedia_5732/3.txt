Sea Fury Poster

UK Quad cinema poster for "Sea Fury" (1958) with poster illustration by Angelo Cesselon.

The film re-united Cy Endfield & Stanley Baker after "Hell Drivers" (1957) & the partnership was resumed to spectacular effect again with "Zulu" (1964). The film was a nautical adventure (with love interest) set in the seas off Spain. The glorious artwork was by the Italian artist Angelo Cesselon (possibly from an Eric Pulford design).

Poster folded with a couple of tiny edge nicks (with conservation tape repairs to the reverse) but still displays to excellent effect.
