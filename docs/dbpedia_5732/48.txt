The Hawker Sea Fury stands as the last piston engine-driven carrier-based fighter in British history. Although absent from the Second World War, its valor shone brightly during the Korean War, where it demonstrated unmatched performance and resilience. From British and Australian carriers to service in nations like Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, the Sea Fury's legacy echoes across continents and generations.

Originally conceived as the Hawker Fury in response to RAF's need for a lightweight Tempest II replacement, the Sea Fury's journey began with a chance encounter—an erroneous landing by a Luftwaffe pilot, offering the British a glimpse into the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Thus, the Sea Fury was born, evolving from a land-based fighter to a carrier-based interceptor.

Deck trials aboard HMS Victorious marked the Sea Fury's entry into naval service during the winter of 1946-47, eventually becoming the Fleet Air Arm's principal single-seat fighter. Its prowess in combat was evident during the Korean War, where it outperformed its contemporaries and solidified its place in history.

Beyond military service, the Sea Fury continues to captivate audiences in racing competitions and air shows worldwide, a testament to its enduring legacy and timeless design.
