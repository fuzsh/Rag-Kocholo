        "text": "The first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career. Which isn't too say that it's GOOD you understand; it sure is fascinating, though, mostly for all the wrong reasons but then, it does boast director Joseph H. Lewis, who went on to make Gun Crazy and The Big Combo, and not for nothin', but when you've got The Invisible Ghost on your resume, having Gun Crazy on there too sure doesn't hurt your place in cinema history.\n\nBela is disturbed by the disappearance years ago of his wife, who ran off with some other guy who no doubt wasn't Hungarian. When I say \"disturbed\", I don't mean \"annoyed\" or \"vexed\", I mean, oh, \"unhinged\" and \"demented\". He sets a place for her at the table, has his faithful servant Clarence Muse serve her soup, compliments her on how particularly beautiful she looks on any given occasion, and is quite convinced that some day she'll return. Boy, is HE right, because she's actually living under the garage in a secret room; she'd been in an auto accident that gave her brain damage and she's cared for and fed by gardener Ernie Adams, and why he does that we'll never know, but \"abject stupidity\" is part of the norm with Monogram scripts, so please hush. The plot of the film, such as it is, is that Mrs. Lugosi (played by, of all people, Betty Compson, and if you just said to yourself, \"Surely not the Betty Compson from Docks of New York and the 1930 version of The Spoilers? Not the Betty Compson who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress? SHE didn't end up on Poverty Row, did she? Please, tell me this is some OTHER Betty Compson! PLEASE TELL ME THAT!\" To which I can only say, \"Life ain't easy, pal, life ain't easy.\" To say that she's the best actor in this film is like getting a blow job in the bathroom of a McDonald's and then announcing you finally had something there you liked.\n\nWell, on THAT possibly inappropriate note, we return to our film and find Betty wandering around the grounds of Manor Lugosi, where her husband occasionally finds her peering in the window, which sets him off into a homicidal rage and he strangles one of the servants. Apparently, this has been going on for YEARS and (a) the police can't figure out who is behind this, and (b) they don't have any trouble whatsoever hiring new servants. Bela also has a daughter, Loretta Young's lookalike sister but not the one that's Sally Blane, no, this lookalike sister is Polly Ann Young, and she's engaged to a nice young man who used to sleep with the household's new maid, and so when she's murdered he's accused, despite the fact that nearly a hundred other servants have been strangled in the same house, and he's executed but his twin brother shows up to woo Polly Ann and figure out who REALLY killed the girl and I TOLD you Monogram pictures were stupid and by the way, both brothers are played by John McGuire and neither of them can act. Neither can Polly Ann or maid Terry Walker or police detective George Pembroke, who apparently was instructed to \"dress like a police detective\" and so wears a trench coat and fedora and chomps on an unlit cigar in every scene he's in, no matter where or what he's doing. Seriously, this is one of the worst-acted films I've ever seen. Clearly, director Lewis was concentrating on other things, because it's terrific to look at, with a lot of unusual shots and camera angles and long takes and weird POVs and stuff like that, way above the Monogram Pictures norm.\n\nAnd then there's that Lugosi fellow.\n\nSee, here's the thing... When that ol' debbil takes him over, he acts like a somnambulist, staggering around the house in a daze, arms outstretched, fingers flexing for a warm throat to crush. Lewis lights him from below, so his face is filled with the shadows of eerie madness. In 1941, in the gloom of a darkened theatre, I'm certain it was most horrifying, and worthy of the good name of Bela Lugosi, Master of Screen Terror. Seriously, it's scary. Um, well, that is to say in 1941 it was. Now? If you don't laugh out loud and think it's one of the stupidest things you've ever seen, it's because you fell asleep during the film, always a possibility with these things. It's a rip-snorter. And only Lugosi can say \"Apple Pie? My! That WILL be a treat!\" and make it sound terrifying. But fret not, there's a lot of million-dollar stupid Monogram dialog in the film for EVERYONE to say.\n\nMillion-dollar stupid Monogram dialog:\n\nCop in trench coat and fedora, chomping on unlit cigar: \"All we want to know is if the fellow's crazy.\"\n\nAged, wise psychiatrist guy: \"That's very easy to determine.\"\n\nRotten actor twin brother man: \"Is it possible, doctor, for a man to be normal, say, for two or three months at a time and then go completely insane for an hour or two?\"\n\nPsychiatrist: \"Yes. Quite common!\"\n\nBela: \"This should be most interesting.\"\n\nYeah, it SHOULD be, huh?\n\nActually, as mentioned, the film IS interesting; director Lewis takes crap and makes a tasty omelet out of it (so to speak). There's also something to be said for letting Bela be Bela; none of this \"bill him prominently but have him play the red-herring butler or groundskeeper who's only in a few scenes\" when Lugosi was at Monogram or PRC, peoples. How many of YOU have got to spend the better part of an hour wandering through a big, dark house with a flashlight under your chin? I mean, in a movie, not in real life.\n\nI always wanted to give a shout out to Clarence Muse, who plays the Negro manservant with dignity and poise and is also one of the best things in the picture. Nice to see a character like this as something other than comic relief.\n\nThe Invisible Ghost is in the public domain, meaning it's on a thousand or so DVDs, but the Roan Group also offers it and they have a nice print of it, not great but nice enough until the Criterion folks finally do something with this film.\n\nThe first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career.

Factory BD $39.95) One of those âfilm classicsâ Iâve never seen; Carl Reiner directed, 1979, Steve Martinâs big-screen breakout role.

I would like to think that thereâs people out there (besides me) who sees AGFA on the label and knows it is worth a buy.\n\nThe Triple Echo (Indicator BD $34.99) A WWII suspense film with Glenda Jackson and Oliver Reed, directed by Michael Apted, 1972, and released in the U.S. as Soldier in Skirts.\n\nThe Unknown Man of Shandigor (Deaf Crocodile BD $29.99) If youâre looking for a 1967 spy spoof made in Switzerland and seen by about a dozen people since it was made, well, have we got a movie for you.\n\nVillage of the Giants (Kino BD $24.95) Bert I. Gordon, a score by Jack Nietzsche, dancing colossal teenagers, and huge ducks. Donât ask, just snap it up. A Balcony favorite.\n\nVoices (Indicator BD $34.99) 1973 film that sounds a lot like Donât Look Now: strange things occur to a young married couple after their child is drowned.\n\nSo exciting to see so many previously-rare Hal Roach short subjects and features come to Blu-ray and DVD recently from VCI/The Sprocket Vault; One Million B.C. and Topper were both exceptional Blu-ray releases of two of Roachâs better films, and this DVD-only release is certainly entertaining, if not as thrill-and-laugh-studded as those two.\n\nBrian Aherne and John Carradine are British political prisoners shipped off to Australia for indentured servitude, where they find themselves under the yoke of one of the screenâs great villains, George Zuccoâs unscrupulous landowner. Zucco and his henchmen, Charles Middleton and Douglass Dumbrille (howâs THAT for an unholy trio?!?) are intent on terrorizing local homesteaders and driving them off the land, so Aherne and fellow prisoner/sworn enemy Victor McLaglen decide to bury the hatchet and rob from the rich (Zucco) to give to the poor (âpoorâ defined as âthe homesteadersâ by Aherne and âMcLaglenâ by McLaglen) in this quite agreeable historical action film.\n\nWe talk more about Hal Roachâs turn with United Artists (1938-1941), which practically destroyed the Roach enterprise, in our review of the Forgotten Comedies disc; suffice to say here that Roach envisioned he was joining the âmajorâ independent producers but with tough financing, the closing of foreign markets during wartime, and booking problems (unlike his previous MGM distribution deal, United Artists didnât block book, meaning each film release had to be sold on its own merits) box-office returns were invariably disappointing. Worse, Roach was forced to step in and direct many of the films himself, and while he certainly was competent in that role, he wasnât exactly Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, or George Cukor, some of the guys he was competing with for audiences. Captain Fury is a fun matinee movie but you feel itâs aspiring to be more; Aherne tries his best to be Errol Flynn (but doesnât make it) and leading lady June Lang is pretty but no threat to Carole Lombard (or even Rosina Lawrence). McLaglen steals every scene heâs in, and our trio of villains steal the rest of the picture. Itâs also worth mentioning that, while laudable that Roach set a film in Australia, filming it at the familiar Southern California shooting locations (including Malibu!) is another puncture in the filmâs lofty ambitions, although footage of a few native Australian animals are sprinkled in for ârealism.â\n\nMillion-dollar Dialog:\n\nAssistant to the Governor: âI STILL insist that itâs preposterous for you, the most important personage in the colony, to travel through this everlasting dust just to hang one man!â\n\nGovernor: âHanging is also important, Hamilton. Especially to the man whoâs being hanged.â\n\nThe print of the film is okay, but wonât knock you out; great materials of most of the Roach films simply no longer exist, so weâre certain this is the best print youâre likely to see. About 10 minutes of Hal Roach trailers and film clips is the only bonus material.\n\nPop some corn and keep expectations turned down just a little bit and youâll find an entertaining feature but donât expect The Adventures of Robin Hood, folks."
