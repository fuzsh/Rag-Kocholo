He was in the Costa Brava, Spain filming \" Sea Fury\". The film, though British was directed by Cy Endfield, a South African born director who had previously worked in Hollywood. Endfield had been forced to leave America after he was blacklisted following allegations of Communist activities by a US Senate commision. The film itself centred around the efforts of two men, Victor Mclagen and Stanley Baker to woo the beautiful Luciana Paluzzi. Mclagen played the captain of an ocean going salvage ship and Baker his deputy. Baker is clearly Paluzzis favourite yet her family disaproves. In a dramatic final scene Baker rescues the young beauty from certain death whilst Mclagen meets his demise. The film was a huge success, not least for Endfield. The director went on to make several films with Baker, not least of which was 1964s \" Zulu\"\n\nmirrorpix\n\nSpain\n\nGL*739272\n\nMedia ID 21253677\n\nÂ© Mirrorpix\n\nMovies\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
