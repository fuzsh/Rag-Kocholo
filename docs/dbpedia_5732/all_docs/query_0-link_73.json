Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n★ ‘Amy’ (R, 2:08) Asif Kapadia’s shattering biographical portrait of the British singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse traces the arc of her short, messy life from smoky-voiced jazz singer to global pop sensation to her death in 2011, at 27, from alcohol poisoning. This material makes for uneasy viewing, as do some of her agonizing self-portraits, though there’s a great deal more to this documentary than sad spectacle. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n‘Ant-Man’ (PG-13, 1:57) Paul Rudd joins the Marvel Universe as Scott Lang, a skilled thief who crosses paths with a cranky scientist (Michael Douglas) and his impatient daughter (Evangeline Lilly). Directed by Peyton Reed and enlivened by a supporting cast that includes Michael Peña, Judy Greer and the rapper T.I., this is a lighthearted, small-stakes superhero movie. (A. O. Scott)\n\n‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ (PG-13, 2:21) For Marvel agnostics, the single most interesting thing about this sequel is that you can sense that the director, Joss Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first “Avengers,” has struggled mightily to invest this one with some life. He has and he hasn’t. (Dargis)\n\n‘Best Of Enemies’ (R, 1:27) In 1968, ABC News hired Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, intellectual titans of the day with a shared penchant for television showboating, to debate each other during that year’s presidential nominating conventions. Their encounters are notorious for venom and not always high-minded invective (Buckley famously threatened to “sock” Vidal in the face). In Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon’s lively documentary, those televised skirmishes are seen as a turning point in the history of American politics and mass media, to be viewed both with nostalgia and with dread. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘A Borrowed Identity’ (No rating, 1:44, in Hebrew and Arabic) There is sublime literary pacing in Eran Riklis’s well-observed adaptation of autobiographical novels by the author and journalist Sayed Kashua (who wrote the script). When a gifted Arab-Israeli tries to assimilate into a Jerusalem boarding school, he finds resentment and frustration at every turn. His ultimate solution to his troubles is seemingly unlikely and yet somehow inevitable. (Andy Webster)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
