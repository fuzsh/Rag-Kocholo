This follows the style set in The Secret of Kells, with it mainly appearing with a flat or 2-dimensional aspect, but also incorporating some 3-dimensional image modelling. Aptly, the imagery of the animation is composed in the form of water-colours, especially in the backgrounds and in the narrative flash-back scenes.\n\nThe film began production soon after the release of The Secret of Kells, premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on 6 September in the \"TIFF Kids\" programme.[8] The film had a limited release in certain countries, but won the Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature and European Film Award for Best Animated Feature Film, as well as the nominations for Best Animated Feature at the 87th Academy Awards and 42nd Annie Awards.[9][10][11]\n\nThe Irish-language version has been produced by Macalla with funding from TG4 and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, with selected cinemas in Ireland screening it from 10 July 2015.[12][13] Brendan Gleeson and Fionnula Flanagan reprised their respective roles in this version. The DVD with the Irish audio can be bought in Cartoon Saloon's online store.[14]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1981, Conor, a lighthouse keeper, lives on an island off the north-west coast of Ireland with his wife, Bronagh. After bearing a human son named Ben, the couple expect a second child, but Bronagh disappears after giving birth to their daughter Saoirse, apparently dying in childbirth.\n\nSix years later, Conor dotes on the mute Saoirse, while Ben is resentful of her, as he blames her for his mother's disappearance; his sole companion is the family's Old English Sheepdog, Cú. On Saoirse's birthday, the children are visited by their Granny, who regards the lighthouse as an unfit place to raise the children. That night, Saoirse plays a seashell given to Ben by their mother, and is led to a white sealskin coat inside Conor's closet. Donning the coat, Saoirse goes to the sea and transforms into a selkie. After swimming, she is found by Granny on the seashore, and the frightened Conor locks the coat in a chest and throws it into the sea. Granny takes the children to her home on the Mainland in Dublin, with Cú staying at the lighthouse. Along the way, Ben draws up a map of the route, and on the eve of Hallowe'en or Samhain he and Saoirse run away from Granny's home to return for Cú [lit. Irish: hound / dog].\n\nSaoirse again plays Ben's seashell and is abducted by a trio of daoine sí, taking her to their lair underneath a bushy roundabout. The daoine sí rejoice at Saoirse's appearance, hoping that she can return them to their homeworld if she sings her song while wearing her coat. However, their jubilation draws the attention of owls belonging to a witch named Macha, who had turned the other daoine sí to stone by sucking their feelings out of them. The owls attack the shelter and turn the daoine sí to stone, but Ben and Saoirse escape. The children make their way toward the lighthouse to retrieve Saoirse's coat, and are reunited with Cú, who swam across the strait in pursuit of them.\n\nDuring a rainfall, Ben and an ailing Saoirse take shelter in a hut, in which Saoirse falls into a holy well. Cú and Ben pursue Saoirse, but Ben gets lost and emerges in a cave inhabited by the Great Seanachaí. Through strands of the sage's beard hair, Ben sees the story of the giant Mac Lir, who cried out in a terrible fit of grief and threatened to flood the world. Macha, Mac Lir's mother, was unable to endure her son's anguish and thus deprived him of his feelings, turning him to stone. Finding Saoirse's whereabouts through another strand, the Great Seanachaí tells Ben that Macha has kidnapped Saoirse and that if Saoirse does not wear her coat and sing her song by dawn, she and all other magical beings will die. Following one of the Great Seanachaí's hairs to Macha's lair, Ben sees a flashback of the night Saoirse was born and learns the truth: Bronagh was a selkie, and she had to return to the sea so Saoirse could be born safely, leaving her husband and children behind.\n\nBen, in his encounter with Macha, learns that the grief-stricken witch seeks to save others from suffering and sadness by turning them to stone just as she had to Mac Lir. Macha herself has partially been turned to stone as she encloses her own strong feelings within enchanted glass jars. Ben finds Saoirse, who's been nearly turned to stone, in the attic. Apologizing for being a bad brother, Ben encourages Saoirse to play the seashell, which breaks the jars and returns Macha's feelings to her, restoring her kindness. Macha helps Ben, Saoirse and Cú return to the lighthouse, riding the wind, with the aid of two spectral hounds of the air.\n\nAs Saoirse is exhausted and near death, Conor attempts to take her to a hospital on the mainland, unwilling to heed Ben's explanation. Ben resolutely dives into the sea alone to retrieve the coat, and unlocks the chest with the aid of a group of seals. Saoirse puts on the suit and begins to sing, which frees all magical beings from their petrified state. As the beings depart for their homeworld beyond the sunset, Bronagh appears before the family to take Saoirse with her. When Ben and Connor plead her not to take Saoirse, Bronagh gives her daughter the choice to stay, as she's half-human. Choosing to stay, Saoirse removes her seal coat, thus untangling the two worlds forever. Bronagh shares one last goodbye with her family and departs.\n\nSometime later, the no-longer broken family celebrates Ben's birthday, and he and Saoirse go swimming with the seals.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Rawle as Ben\n\nBrendan Gleeson as Conor and the Mac Lir\n\nFionnula Flanagan as Granny and Macha\n\nLisa Hannigan as Bronagh;[15] Ben and Saoirse's mother\n\nLucy O'Connell as Saoirse\n\nJon Kenny as Ferry Dan and The Great Seanachaí\n\nPat Shortt as Lug\n\nColm Ó Snodaigh as Mossy\n\nLiam Hourican as Spud and Bus Driver\n\nKevin Swierszcz as Young Ben\n\nWill Collins as Additional voices\n\nPaul Young as Additional voices\n\nIrish\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Ó Floinn as Ben\n\nBrendan Gleeson as Conor and the Mac Lir\n\nFionnula Flanagan as Granny and Macha\n\nGráinne Bleasdale as Bronagh[15]\n\nFionán Farley Nolan as Saoirse\n\nMaurice O'Donoghue as the Great Seanchaí\n\nDonncha Crowley as Lug\n\nNiall McDonagh as Mossy, Ferry Dan, and Rock Shee\n\nTomás Ó Súilleabháin as Spud and Bus Driver\n\nRíona Farley Nolan as Young Ben\n\nScottish Gaelic\n\n[edit]\n\nKathleen NicAonghais as Ben\n\nDàibhidh Walker as Conor, Mac Lir and Rock Shee\n\nDonna Nic 'Ille Mhoire as Macha\n\nCatherine Tinney as Saoirse and Young Ben\n\nMàiri Nic 'Ille Mhoire as Bronagh\n\nAilig Dòmhnallach as Ferry Dan and Lug\n\nAnna Mhoireach as Granny\n\nIain MacFhionghain as Mossy and Bus Driver\n\nIain MacRath as Spud and the Great Seanchaí\n\nFrench\n\n[edit]\n\nJean-Stan DuPac as Ben\n\nPatrick Béthune as Connor\n\nNolwenn Leroy as Bruna\n\nNathalie Homs as Granny and Macha\n\nCyrille Artaux as Lug\n\nPascal Sellem as Spud\n\nThisbée Vidal-Lefebvre as Young Ben\n\nMarc Perez as Mossy\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nSong of the SeaSoundtrack album by Released1 January 2014 ( )GenreFilm scoreLength54:02LabelUniversal Music Group\n\nThe original music for the film was composed by Bruno Coulais, in collaboration with the Irish group Kíla. \"The Derry Tune\" originally featured on Kíla's 2010 album Soisín.
