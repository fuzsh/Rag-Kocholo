        "text": "The aircraft, a Sea Fury, made by the same company that built the iconic Hawker Hurricane, wowed crowds on Gyllyngvase Beach with loop the loops and spins over the sea.\n\nThe aircraft was understood to be from the Royal Navy Historic Flight, based at the Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton in 1972 in order to preserve Naval heritage and to be a living memorial to all Fleet Air Arm personnel.\n\nIt was part of the part of the display for the Emergency Services Summer Ball at Pendennis Castle.\n\nWatch the video below.\n\nCredit Martin Perrett.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury was a British fighter aircraft designed and manufactured by Hawker.\n\nThe type is distinctive due to it being not only the last propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy, it is also one of the fastest production single piston-engined aircraft ever built.\n\nDeveloped during the Second World War, the Sea Fury has many similarities to Hawker's preceding Tempest fighter; the type had several qualities that made it more suitable for carrier operations, being a lighter aircraft and the pilot having a significantly improved field of view.\n\nIntroduced to operational service in October 1945, too late to participate in the war itself, the Sea Fury would slowly supplant older fighters used by the Royal Navy such as the Supermarine Seafire."
