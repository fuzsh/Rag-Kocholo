        "text": "Michael Douglas\n\nAmerican actor and producer\n\nQuick Facts\n\nIn full:\n\nMichael Kirk Douglas\n\nAwards And Honors:\n\nAcademy Award (1988)\n\nAcademy Award (1988): Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAcademy Award (1976): Best Picture\n\nCecil B. DeMille Award (2004)\n\nEmmy Award (2013): Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie\n\nGolden Globe Award (2019): Best Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy\n\nGolden Globe Award (2014): Best Actor in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nGolden Globe Award (1988): Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama\n\nNotable Family Members:\n\nfather Kirk Douglas\n\nMichael Douglas (born September 25, 1944, New Brunswick, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American film actor and producer who is best known for his intense portrayals of flawed heroes.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nDouglas, the son of film legend Kirk Douglas and British actress Diana Dill, received much of his education in filmmaking by accompanying his father to various film locations. After studying drama at the University of California at Santa Barbara (B.A., 1968), Douglas made his screen debut in Hail, Hero! (1969), a Vietnam-era antiwar film now regarded as hyperbolic and dated. He made a handful of mostly forgettable films—the best of which was the Disney-produced family adventure Napoleon and Samantha (1972)—before landing the role of Steve Keller on the popular television series The Streets of San Francisco (1972), costarring with veteran actor Karl Malden.\n\nSuccess as a producer: One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nDouglas became a driving force in the entertainment industry when he produced a screen rendering of Ken Kesey’s novel One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975). Douglas’s father had acquired the rights to Cuckoo’s Nest when he starred in a Broadway adaptation during the early 1960s, and for many years he tried to interest a producer in a film version. When his efforts failed, he sold the rights to his son, who in turn produced the second film in Hollywood history to win Academy Awards in all five major categories: best picture, best actor (Jack Nicholson), best actress (Louise Fletcher), best director (Miloš Forman), and best screenplay. From this triumph, Douglas went on to both produce and star in some of the biggest box-office hits of the next two decades. Other films Douglas produced included Starman (1984), Flatliners (1990), Face/Off (1997), and The Rainmaker (1997).\n\nNoteworthy acting roles\n\nDouglas coproduced and costarred in The China Syndrome (1979), a taut thriller set in a nuclear power plant that was ironically and fortuitously released the same week as the real-life nuclear crisis at Three Mile Island. He appeared with Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito in the highly successful action-adventure Romancing the Stone (1984) and its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile (1985), and again teamed with the same costars for the popular dark comedy The War of the Roses (1989). One of Douglas’s most memorable roles was in Fatal Attraction (1987), in which he portrayed a family man terrorized by a woman (memorably portrayed by Glenn Close) with whom he has an adulterous affair. In the same year, Douglas delivered an Oscar-winning performance as a ruthless, morally empty financier in Wall Street (1987). Douglas’s screen persona was well showcased in this film, in that his antiheroic character of Gordon Gekko—whose personal credo is “greed is good”—is both unctuous and charismatic. Several of Douglas’s performances flaunt this dichotomy: his villainous characters exhibit personal magnetism, and his heroes are often victim to their own inadequacies. He (like his father) was one of the few actors to build a successful career out of portraying less-than-virtuous characters.\n\nBasic Instinct (1992), a film as controversial as it was successful, was in the same genre as Fatal Attraction and served to pigeonhole Douglas as an actor specializing in violent or sexual fare. Such films as Black Rain (1989), Falling Down (1993), and Disclosure (1994) added to this characterization. Endeavouring to change his image, Douglas starred in the romantic comedy The American President (1995), in which he portrayed a widowed chief executive.\n\nLater films\n\nIn 2000 Douglas received widespread praise for his performances as a depressive college professor in Wonder Boys and as the recently appointed American drug czar in Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic; he costarred with Catherine Zeta-Jones in the latter film, and the couple married that same year. Douglas starred alongside his father, Kirk, and his son, Cameron, in It Runs in the Family (2003), about three generations of a dysfunctional Manhattan family. He later played a secret service agent wrongly accused of being part of an assassination attempt in The Sentinel (2006), and in King of California (2007) he portrayed a patient recently released from a mental hospital who is looking for gold underneath a discount store.\n\nDouglas reprised the role of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), a sequel set in 2008 amid the global financial crisis. Reuniting with Soderbergh, he appeared as a shady government official in the action thriller Haywire (2011) and starred as Liberace in Behind the Candelabra (2013), a witty account of the entertainer’s private life near the end of his career; Douglas won an Emmy Award for his work on the latter production. He joined Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline in the buddy comedy Last Vegas (2013). Douglas again displayed his comic skills as a curmudgeonly realtor in the romantic comedy And So It Goes (2014). He then produced and starred in the critically panned thriller Beyond the Reach (2014), in which he hammed it up as a psychotic big-game hunter who, after accidentally shooting a man, turns the only witness into his next quarry. Douglas then appeared as Dr. Hank Pym in the superhero movie Ant-Man (2015) and its sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). He also played the character in Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nIn 2018 Douglas returned to television, appearing as an aging actor turned acting teacher in the Netflix series The Kominsky Method; the show ended in 2021. He later lent his voice to the animated series Green Eggs and Ham (2019– ), which was based on Dr. Seuss’s children’s classic; it also aired on Netflix.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2010 Douglas announced that he had been diagnosed with advanced throat cancer; the following year he announced that the disease was in remission. He revealed in 2013 that he had actually been suffering from tongue cancer but had misrepresented his condition because it was known that the surgical treatment of tongue cancer was sometimes disfiguring. He had worried that public knowledge of that possibility would affect his career prospects. He was ultimately treated with chemotherapy and radiation rather than surgery.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
