        "text": "Spoilers beware.\n\nHaving seen only a handful of David Ayer’s films, I can say with confidence that Fury — the 2014 fictional war story set in WWII — is the best of his filmography that I have personally seen (that being Suicide Squad and Bright, so…not exactly stiff competition). While the pace of the story can feel a little on-and-off at points and it’s overall structure as a war film has been done better in its contemporaries, Fury relishes in it’s bleak, brutal approach to it’s WWII setting. Not only could this be my favorite direction in any of David Ayer’s films, but the performances by the talented ensemble do a lot to give the film the gravitas it needs.\n\nThe year is 1945, the final weeks of the European theater in WWII. Don Collier, staff sergeant and commander of the M4 Sherman tank Fury alongside Grady, Boyd, and Gordo, finds himself down one man after a vicious tank battle. When they reach a camp, they find out that their former partner is being replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, a young man who was meant to be a mere typist and who’s been in the armed forced for only a few weeks. Through Norman’s more inexperienced perspective, the horrors of war are brought forth: the violence, desensitization, and mental scarring that occurs when war becomes all you know to be true."
