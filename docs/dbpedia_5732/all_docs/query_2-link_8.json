Fury.\"\n\nAstrid: \"A Light Fury.\"\n\nHiccup: \"Yeah, yours is better, probably.\"[src]\n\n” — Hiccup and Astrid discovering a Light Fury\n\nThe Light Fury is a medium-sized Strike Class dragon, and a variation of the Night Fury[1] that first appeared in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is the name of the Light Fury in 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'?\n\nThe Light Fury in 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' does not have a specific name. She is simply referred to as 'Light Fury'.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat animal was the Light Fury based on in its design?\n\nThe Light Fury from 'How to Train Your Dragon' was inspired by several animals in its design. The primary inspirations were the snow leopard, axolotls, and terns. The snow leopard, in particular, influenced the Light Fury's feline-like qualities.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat class of dragon is the Light Fury in 'How to Train Your Dragon'?\n\nThe Light Fury in 'How to Train Your Dragon' is a medium-sized Strike Class dragon.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat are some unique qualities and abilities of the Light Fury?\n\nThe Light Fury, a dragon species from 'How to Train Your Dragon', is known for its unique qualities and abilities. It has a striking white coloration with a blue and pink tint, which allows it to blend seamlessly into clouds, sea fog, and distant horizons. This dragon has cat-like eyes and a long, thin ridge running down its spine. It also features triangular tail flukes and four small nubs on its head. The Light Fury's abilities are quite impressive, including cloaking via plasma blasts, camouflage, stealth flight, and dive-bombing. It also has reflective scales and retractable teeth. Despite its skittish and skeptical nature towards humans, the Light Fury shares a deep sense of empathy and is known to defend anyone in danger with its plasma blasts.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow is the Light Fury different from the Night Fury in 'How to Train Your Dragon'?\n\nThe Light Fury, a character from 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a distinct species from the Night Fury. One of the key differences is their color, with the Light Fury being white, often associated with its stealthy nature. The Light Fury also has a unique ability to become nearly invisible when flying through direct sunlight, a feature not seen in the Night Fury. Additionally, the Light Fury and Night Fury have different eye and tail shapes. The most significant difference, however, is that the Light Fury and Night Fury can interbreed, producing a hybrid offspring known as the Night Light.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nOfficial Description\n\n“ The Light Fury moves as fast as Toothless and shares his ability to blend into the sky — even during daylight hours.\n\nWith her white coloration, the Light Fury hides seamlessly in clouds, sea fog, and distant horizons. Although skittish and skeptical, the Light Fury also shares Toothless' deep sense of empathy and will always wield her plasma blast to defend any in need.\n\nTemporarily transforms each scale into a reflective surface that mirrors the Light Fury’s surroundings, essentially rendering her invisible. ” — Dragonpedia\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe Light Fury was specially designed to be very similar to the Night Fury, but still have its own unique qualities and abilities.[2] While Toothless is based in part on a black panther, Simon Otto based the Light Fury in part on another feline, the snow leopard.[1] The Light Fury is also described as very rare, very elusive, and very wild.[3]\n\nAccording to Simon Otto, the Light Fury was inspired by snow leopards, axolotls, and terns. He views Toothless as a lion and the Light Fury as a lioness. The goal was to make her different enough from Toothless to stand out, while similar enough for them to be mates.[4]\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nEgg\n\nIn School of Dragons, Light Fury eggs are plain oval, with an icy blue coloring and darker spots all over them.\n\nIn Dragons: Rise of Berk, a Light Fury egg is more round, with a scale-like pattern covering it in its entirety. It is entirely white in color.\n\nHatchling to Adult\n\nLight Furies greatly resemble Night Furies, but they are sleeker and less heavy with lighter coloring and glimmering textures that include white, blue, and pink. They possess a long, single spine running down the center of their back and light blue eyes. They also have two pairs of ear-like appendages on the top of their heads and a pink-colored nose. They also have some very light blue on their underbelly/chest area and feet. They are also somewhat smaller than Night Furies.\n\nAs it is a variation of the Night Fury, there are some notable differences. Toothless, the only known Night Fury, has very large scales covering his appendages, legs, and snout. The Light Fury does not show these traits. Also, the Night Fury has ridges going along the middle of its head, whereas the Light Fury does not. On the sides of its head, the Light Fury has two fewer appendages (or \"nubs\") than the Night Fury that are shorter and rounder, and the head of the Night Fury is slightly longer. The mouth of the Light Fury is shorter, and it doesn't stretch as far across its face as the mouth of the Night Fury. This last trait, however, might just have to do with the personal traits of Toothless and his mate, and it may not have anything to do with the species.\n\nThe wings of the Light Furies are slightly shorter than those of the Night Furies, and they possess no sharp tips at their ends. They are glittery white in coloration and have stripes of glittery light pink, purple and pale blue running down their wings- which are, in contrast to a Night Fury's bat-like wings- rounded in an almost butterfly-like fashion.\n\nThe tail flukes of the Light Furies are triangular and slightly resembles a heart, white in color, as well as shorter than those of the Night Furies. They have two smaller triangular flukes just above the main ones, these are hard to notice.\n\nAbilities\n\nFirepower\n\nLight Furies are capable of firing explosive plasma blasts that are almost identical to the ones produced by Night Furies. In the same respect, Light Furies have an amount of control over when their flame blasts explode in the air. The Light Fury's plasma blast is capable of smashing apart full-grown trees in one shot.\n\nAs seen in How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming, Light Furies can send a plasma blast towards a crystal and leave it glowing green for many hours.\n\nStealth and Camouflage\n\nDue to their cloaking ability, Light Furies are very stealthy dragons. They can walk through the middle of a village without any humans or most dragons sensing them. The pale white bodies of Light Furies allow them to easily blend in with clouds and the sky at daytime in a similar way that Night Furies blend in with the night sky. Light Furies also easily blend into mist due to their white scales.\n\nCloaking\n\nLight Furies possess the ability to seemingly disappear by flying through the blasts of their plasma fire. This is, in fact, a form of cloaking that occurs when they heat up the trace silicates in their skin, causing their scales to have mirror-like qualities, allowing them to temporarily blend in with their surroundings using reflection of the light.\n\nSenses\n\nSimilarly, to Night Furies, Light Furies also have acute senses, as the Light Fury sensed Hiccup and Astrid before firing at them. She later sensed Grimmel, who was nearby. It likely that Light Furies have night vision like Night Furies, but it isn’t very powerful, as the Light Fury had to light a crystal to check on the Night Lights.\n\nSpeed and Agility\n\nLight Furies share the same speed and agility with that of the Night Furies, for one can swiftly swoop in and grab Hiccup, as well as taking off rapidly upon seeing Hiccup and Astrid. Even when drugged by Grimmel, the Light Fury was able to keep ahead of Toothless and Hiccup. Light Furies can also presumably preform dive-bombing techniques, just like Night Furies.\n\nStrength and Combat\n\nLight Furies can carry heavy objects, including humans and dragons that are larger than themselves.\n\nEndurance and Stamina\n\nLight Furies are shown to possess a great amount of stamina, for they can travel long distances without showing signs of exhaustion. They are also very durable, for they can get up after crash-landing without injury. They also can recover a few seconds after being drugged by Deathgripper venom after the collar had been taken off.\n\nIntelligence\n\nJust like Night Furies, Light Furies are very intelligent, as one can quickly fly away upon sensing danger and understanding a human's plea to save another dragon.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nTail Fin Dependency\n\nJust like Night Furies, Light Furies are unable to fly if one of their tail fins is destroyed or cut off.\n\nBehavior and Personality\n\n“ The feline-like Light Fury is gentle and playful by nature, like Toothless, but fiercely protective when danger is present. ” — Dragonpedia\n\nJust like Night Furies, Light Furies are very intelligent, expressive and very elusive. They seem to be sociable towards other dragons, but highly aggressive towards humans. Light Furies also seem to be more aggressive and are more willing to attack than Night Furies (though this could be because the female Light Fury had been attacked first by humans). In the first film when Astrid found Toothless, Toothless had been willing to attack, but he never charged a plasma blast. In the third film when Toothless first met his future mate, she immediately shot a fireball powerful enough to destroy a large tree after hearing the first sign of humans. However, they will eventually warm up to humans that have proven themselves as allies.\n\nLike Night Furies sometimes do, Light Furies sleep like a bat hanging from a tree but have also seen sleeping on the ground.\n\nTraining\n\nIf already wary of humans, Light Furies can be very aggressive towards them. However, a Light Fury's trust can be slowly earned. If a person helps a Light Fury or saves its life, the dragon will return the favor, and will from then on be a friend. Another way is to find its egg and train it from when it hatches.\n\nComparative Statistics\n\nStatistics Across Multiple Media Ultimate Book\n\nof Dragons Guide to\n\nDragons Books Dragonpedia Dragonpedia\n\nStat Cards World of\n\nDragons School of\n\nDragons Other CLASS Strike Strike Strike Strike SIZE 22 feet WINGSPAN 42 feet WEIGHT 1,600 lbs ATTACK 15 15 15 SPEED 20 20 20 10 ARMOR 18 18 18 FIRE POWER 14 14 14 6.7 SHOT LIMIT 6 6 6 6 VENOM 0 0 0 JAW STRENGTH 6 6 6 STEALTH 18 18 18\n\nAppearances\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\n\nMain article: Light Fury (character)\n\nThe Warlords managed to capture a female Light Fury shortly before the events of the film. When the Dragon Riders raid the ship the dragon was on, they miss the Light Fury, due to her ability to camouflage. She was successfully delivered to Grimmel the Grisly, who decided to use her to capture Toothless.\n\nMany Light Furies are among the myriad of dragons that reside in the Hidden World.\n\nGames\n\nDragons: Rise of Berk\n\nThe Light Fury is added to the game as a Unique Dragon in a 2019 Valentine update as a tie-in for the release of the third film.\n\nIn September of 2023, a baby Light Fury was added to the game.\n\nSchool of Dragons\n\nLight Furies were added in the game in the update 3.0.0. A player can have a Light Fury only if they have membership. The unnamed Light Fury also appears in the game during \"The Hidden World\" expansion. As part of the shutting down of the game, customizable Light Furies were released on June 9th, 2023, along with Light Fury eggs and hatchlings.\n\nDragons: Titan Uprising\n\nThe Light Fury is a limited time offer, only to be gained in special events. All players start with a baby Light Fury, but they can't level it up. The special event was used to get trust points so the player could level it up. These special events return periodically.\n\nTrivia\n\nNight Furies and Light Furies have the exact same stats.\n\nDean DeBlois refers to the Light Fury as a subspecies of the Night Fury, a classification under that of ‘species,' where populations of a species vary in habitat and physical characteristics but can still interbreed.\n\nUpon obtaining a three-star Light Fury in Titan Uprising, the Light Fury's dorsal spine glows blue like Toothless'. There also appears to be two extra spines running down its back on either side.\n\nThe Light Fury was named by Astrid. While Hiccup tried naming it a \"Bright Fury\", he yielded to Astrid's name for it.\n\nReferences\n\nSite Navigation\n\nDragon Species of\n\nDeathgripper • Light Fury • Night Fury • Skrill • Snow Wraith • Songwing • Triple Stryke • Woolly Howl\n\nBubblehorn • Fireworm • Flame Thrower • Flame Whipper • Gobsucker • Green Death • Hobgobbler • Hobblegrunt • Large Shadow Wing • Magma Breather • Moldruffle • Monstrous Nightmare • Night Terror • Red Death • Silver Phantom • Singetail • Sky Torcher • Small Shadow Wing • Snowtail • Terrible Terror • Threadtail • Typhoomerang\n\nBewilderbeast • Fathomfin • Flood Fang • Luminous Krayfin • Mist Twister • Octofin • Purple Death • Ripwrecker • Sand Wraith • Scauldron • Seashocker • Shellfire • Shockjaw • Sliquifier • Submaripper • Thunderdrum • Tide Glider • Windwalker\n\nCatastrophic Quaken • Crimson Goregutter • Eruptodon • Fault Ripper • Grapple Grounder • Groncicle • Gronckle • Hotburple • Screaming Death • Sentinel • Shovelhelm • Snafflefang • Thunderpede • Whispering Death\n\nDevilish Dervish • Egg Biter • Evolved Scuttleclaw • Grim Gnasher • Hackatoo • Raincutter • Razorwhip • Scuttleclaw • Shivertooth • Speed Stinger • Stormcutter • Thornridge • Timberjack • Windstriker • Woodchipper\n\nArmorwing • Boneknapper • Buffalord • Cavern Crasher • Changewing • Deadly Spinner • Death Song • Dramillion • Featherhide • Flightmare • Foreverwing • Gem Blaster • Hideous Zippleback • Hobgobbler • Jörmungandr • Prickleboggle • Sandbuster • Silkspanner • Slithersong • Slitherwing • Smothering Smokebreath • Snaptrapper • Spiderwing • Sweet Death • Sword Stealer • Tormentipede • Yetiwing\n\nDeadly Nadder • Gembreaker • Glass Caster • Mudraker • Rumblehorn • Snifflehide • Snifflehunch • Thunderclaw • Vine Tail • Windgnasher\n\nLycanwing • Stinger • Unknown Dragons"
