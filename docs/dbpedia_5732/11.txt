Stanley Baker 1958 making film Sea Fury in Estratit Costa Brava Spain

The actor Stanley Baker with a somewhat unusual leading lady. He was in the Costa Brava, Spain filming " Sea Fury". The film, though British was directed by Cy Endfield, a South African born director who had previously worked in Hollywood. Endfield had been forced to leave America after he was blacklisted following allegations of Communist activities by a US Senate commision. The film itself centred around the efforts of two men, Victor Mclagen and Stanley Baker to woo the beautiful Luciana Paluzzi. Mclagen played the captain of an ocean going salvage ship and Baker his deputy. Baker is clearly Paluzzis favourite yet her family disaproves. In a dramatic final scene Baker rescues the young beauty from certain death whilst Mclagen meets his demise. The film was a huge success, not least for Endfield. The director went on to make several films with Baker, not least of which was 1964s " Zulu"
