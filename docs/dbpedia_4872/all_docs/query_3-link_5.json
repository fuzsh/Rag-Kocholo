        "text": "Columns\n\nTroops were ready to cope with violence andÂ Â bloodletting but there was none\n\nTamil parties talk with President on interim measures but they provoke only heated exchanges\n\nUphill task for Ranil in resolving key issues relating toÂ ethnic reconciliation based on 13th Amendment\n\nBy our Political Editor\n\nOnly the war with Tiger guerrillas is over. The other wars appear to continue, remarked President Ranil Wickremesinghe jokingly, during an informal chat with his advisors.\n\nHe was alluding to bickering that occurred among top brass in the defence and security establishment. The occasion was an informal discussion of last Saturdayâs tough security cordon around the city of Colombo and its environs by security forces and the Police. Reports of a 1000 packets of meals ordered by university students had sparked fears of a major protest like the ones seen last year. That was to be on Sunday. Thus, troops and the Police were ready to cope with feared bloodletting and violence. There was nothing. Within some 72 hours there was a gradual withdrawal of the deployment.\n\nIt is not unusual for those in the defence and the security establishment to make assessments based on food orders. During the separatist war, intelligence officials kept a tab on bakeries in the guerrilla held north. Their attention would be triggered when an unusual volume of bread or buns was made. That made them suspect there was going to be an attack.\n\nThe 1000 packets of meals did raise questions about the ground assessment on the accuracy of reports of a crisis. If indeed there was one, the buildup of an unprecedented strength came as a deterrent and the hours passed by without incidents. Not even the shouting of slogans. So much so, when the most senior top brass met to take stock of the situation on Monday with government leaders, there was no need for a discussion. If indeed they had planned for a protest, it had fizzled out. So, they delved into other unrelated matters.\n\nNevertheless, the unprecedented security cordon around Colombo and the suburbs came in an interesting backdrop. After last yearâs protests or aragalaya, which prompted then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country, there has been controversy over how troops and the Police acted last year. Before Gotabaya Rajapaksaâs humiliating exit from the country, was a probe he initiated. One of his primary concerns was the mob attack on his private residence in Pangiriwatte Road at Mirihana in Nugegoda. So, he named three top military officers fiercely loyal to him to a Board of Inquiry. It was headed by Fleet Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda and included onetime Army Commander General Daya Ratnayake and Air Force Marshal Roshan Goonetilleke.\n\nTheir report was disclosed for the first time in these columns on March 5. Among other matters, it said: âFocus on the 17-page report, besides annexures, gained greater public attention after selected sections were leaked to the media. Those placed the blame on General Shavendra Silva for alleged lapses during the protests that drove Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of office last year. A former Army Commander, Silva is now Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). He joined the Army on March 5, 1984, as an officer cadet in the 19th intake. He was born on June 22, 1964. In fact, as a serving military officer, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not only promoted him but also appointed him Sri Lankaâs Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York.â\n\nThe Board of Inquiry noted: âAlthough many factors contributed to this situation, the Board of Inquiry will concentrate on the military and intelligence lapses as per the terms and references. Even though the Police activities were not within the purview of this BOI, the Board was compelled to go into some of their decisions and activities that resulted in the declaration of emergency and mobilising the military to assist the Police in maintaining law and order.â\n\nâThe protest led by Hirunika Premachandra,â the Board of Inquiry said in its report, âhad taken the Presidentâs security detail by surprise.â It said: âThe following day many discussions had been held including some chaired by the Defence Secretary to work out contingency plans to prevent such situations in the future. However, the contingency plans prepared were not properly executed by any intelligence agency although the peaceful protest that preceded it was known.â\n\nâThe mob activity at Mirihana had not been detected by any intelligence agency although the peaceful protest that preceded it was known. On instructions of the Secretary of Defence, the Air Force and the Navy reacted promptly and arrived at the location on time. However, it was observed that the Army had delayed in deploying their troops, which resulted in their inability to reach the required location on time due to the increasing numbers of protestors blocking the road. As a result of this, the Old Kesbewa road had been totally blocked by protestors from the directions of Mirihana and Embuldeniya.â\n\nâThe Secretary of Defence, Secretary of Public Security, Chief of Defence Staff, three Service Commanders and the IGP had rushed to the Army operations room in Akuregoda, to monitor, co-ordinate and direct operations. The mob violence escalated to a point where damage to public property took place in the form of burning a CTB bus and damaging walls and houses in the vicinity of the private residence of HE the President. At approximately 0100 hours on April 01, 2022, the STF (Special Task Force) supported by the Air Force had baton charged the violent mob and chased them towards the Embuldeniya junction. The situation has been brought under control by 0200 hours on April 01, 2022. The lack of professionalism leading to indecisive action displayed in handling the Mirihana situation had given confidence for mobsters to carry out a series of similar activities in other parts of the country thereafter.â\n\nâOn April 05, 2022, instructions had gone from the Army Headquarters to all Field Commanders to carry out reconnaissance of VIP residences and record the distances from the nearest Army camp to rush troops if the requirement aroseâ¦â¦..â\n\nThe BOI report also said: âThere had not been a proper command structure in place to command and co-ordinate HE the Presidentâs security at Mirihana to deal with the situation that occurred on March 31, 2022. A comment on this is pertinent. Such a command structure should have been the responsibility of the Defence Ministry since it involves the co-opting of several fighting units from different security arms. The security of a President is as important as the security of the entire nationâ¦..â\n\nFirstly, the findings of the Board of Inquiry, particularly the absence of some security measures, had prompted those who planned the security cordon last week to factor them in. There was reconnaissance. There was a centralised co-ordination of activity by troops and Police. What were considered vulnerable points were identified and deployments covered by them. Yet there was no sign of resistance. If one were to quote a Shakespearean play, there was no Hamlet although the play was staged. Politicians of various hues had their own theories. Funnily enough, one of them spoke about students capturing the university. How could they have worked it? That is not all. By some coincidence there were also answers over why the security forces and the Police did not crack down on the protestors on the previous occasion. .\n\nThe man behind the move was former military strongman, who commanded troops to military victory against Tiger guerrillas. It was last Friday that the government leaders marked Victory Day. However, then President and Commander-in-Chief under whom the defeat came, Mahinda Rajapaksa was absent. Those who attended were mostly government leaders other than Opposition Leader, Sajith Premadasa.Â Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, now a politician, has admitted that he told General Shavendra Silva, in a telephone conversation not to open fire at last yearâs protestors. The disclosure, in a video interview FM Fonseka gave a social media outlet, has now become public.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of what FM Fonseka has said: âA small number of senior officers are there in the Police and Army who would like to carry out errands of politicians. It is normal within our system. I did not go and ask my military and Police contacts why the security was placed at Colombo and put them in a difficult situation. I know of the laws which could affect them. It is not ethical to collect information like spices. Therefore, I donât use efforts to learn such information.â\n\nâAt the time Army Commander Gen. Shavendra Silva called me twice during two instances where protestors were on the verge of breaking the barriers and barge into the Parliament after Gotabaya Rajapaksa had fled the country. They knew I had connections with the protestors. I am a Member of Parliament. There is no law that a person who oversees the Army cannot speak to others. I was also a powerful person in the Army. I was also there in the protests. The protestors knew I could work with some success due to my conduct in the past.\n\nâHe was also uneasy when he called. At that moment the Police and military were helpless. I was a politician of the Opposition party; the government ministers have life threats. His residence was also near the Parliament. His wife and mother-in-law were there. My only advice to him was not to allow anyone to shoot, and meanwhile try to remove politicians if possible. For a second time when things got escalated, he called me again. I gave him the previous advice and said establish your security. Ensure the safety of the politicians, if they breakdown barriers you cannot shoot. You cannot shoot civilians. If I was there, I would remove the politicians from there. That was the only option.â\n\nâGen. Shavendra Silva must take decisions for himself as he has his responsibilities and a position, but at that moment they were helpless. I did not speak because I was a former Army commander. I was also a Member of Parliament and a Field Marshal and they worked under me, they had no other place to get advice. He could ask another former army commander or if he saw fit that Sajith Premadasa could advise him, he could have asked for advice. He could not get it done but somehow the soldiers got it controlled. Though there was no shooting, they fought and got injuredâ¦..â\n\nFM Fonsekaâs remarks debunk claims by Wimal Weerawansa, who claimed in a booklet, about a conspiracy over why security forces and police did not crack down on the protestors. FM Fonseka was highly critical of Weerawansa.\n\nAnother event of significance this week was President Ranil Wickremesingheâs meeting with Tamil political parties. The subject was a proposal for an interim arrangement to be put into operation until the fuller implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution is acted upon. TNA stalwarts Rajavarothayam Sampanthan and Abraham Sumanthiran had heated exchanges with President Wickremesinghe. They were opposed to the interim arrangement.\n\nSumanthiran told , âEven though we had several rounds of talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in recent weeks, nothing substantial has been achieved so far, except one thing at the last meeting where a directive was issued to the Archaeology Department to stop land acquisitions.â\n\nHe also noted that few Tamil prisoners detained under the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) have been released after several years in remand custody. The latest to walk free after being acquitted from all charges is Sivalingam Aaruran, an engineer who was in custody for more than 15 years this week over the case of an attempted assassination of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa when he was Defence Secretary on December 1, 2006, in Kollupitiya.\n\nOne solution to the ethnic conflict,Â Sumanthiran claimed, President Wickremesinghe had abandoned the principles. âWe have been engaged in since last December and now prefer to discuss an interim administration proposal for Provincial councils. This was brought in by former Northern province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran. The proposal is a mechanism to govern PCs till fresh elections are held. We categorically rejected it since it was introduced as a temporary mechanism before the 13th amendment came into effect. The President proposed a committee to be appointed to study the proposal which we refused as well.â\n\nBefore the Presidential talks last week, the proposal for interim administration was circulated among the Tamil political parties. Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) out right rejected it and other parties Tamil Eelam Liberation Front (TELO) and Peoplesâ Liberation Organisation Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) also followed suit.\n\nMany Tamil MPs were surprised to see that the proposal was tabled at the talks with the President. Even President Wickremesinghe had one copy on his table as the talks went on. âAt one point President Wickremesinghe shared his copy with me,â Sumanthiran said.\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice and now Jaffna District Parliamentarian C.V. Wigneswaran presented a two-page memorandum incorporating an interim arrangement possibly until the Presidential elections were held. It had been drafted by a former bureaucrat, K. Vigneswaran. President Wickremesinghe offered to set up a committee to study the draft, but the TNA said it would not join in. The document had been signed by Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, Douglas Devananda, C.V. Wigneswaran, Ananda Sangari and K. Vigneswaran. This is what the memorandum addressed to President Wickremesinghe said:\n\nMOVEMENT FOR DEVOLUTION OF POWER:\n\nâThe Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 27 July was signed in Colombo after all the representatives of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka comprising the EPRLF, EROS, LTTE, PLOTE, TELO and the TULF gave their consent the previous night, in New Delhi. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution was the outcome of that Agreement. However, when steps were taken to implement that Amendment, the unanimity that existed within the Tamil side had disappeared. Furthermore, the Sinhalese side became apprehensive about an end to the war with the implementation of the 13th Amendment. As a result, the 13th Amendment suffered a complete setback over the past 35 years.â\n\nâThe country is now in the midst of an economic crisis. The Tamil side has come to realise the urgency for the Full Implementation of the 13th Amendment for the moment. The Provincial Council elections have been put off for nearly 10 years. A few more months of delay in holding the elections will not matter very much.Â But we are of the view that certain preliminaries must be attended to urgently prior to holding the elections.â\n\nâOver the years, many powers devolved to the Provinces had been intruded upon by a section of the bureaucracy in Colombo. All such issues have to be rectified. For nearly 35 years, the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been discouraged to enact Statutes. Their independent administration had been interfered with. It will therefore be necessary to pass Provincial Statutes to rectify some of these matters. The 13th Amendment itself has provisions to enable the passage of Statutes even when an elected Provincial Council is non-functional. In India, such a situation is described as âa period of Presidentâs Rule in a State.ââ\n\nÂ\n\nâThe Governor of a Province has to report to the President that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the province cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution (Article 154 L). Thereupon, the President by proclamation assumes to himself all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor or any other body. He also declares that the powers of the Provincial Council shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament. The Parliament is empowered to confer on the President the Power of that Provincial Council to make Statutes and to delegate the power so conferred to an authority specified by the President (Article 154M). That authority would be a Board of Advisors appointed by the President for that Province. In our view, such a Board must comprise representatives of each of the recognized political parties active in the Province, and which unequivocally have called for the Full Implementation of the 13th Amendment.â\n\nâRepresentatives of recognized political parties nominated for the Board of Advisors shall not be members of Parliament, Members of Provincial Councils or elected members of any local authority, or any serving officer of the Government or a Provincial Council. The President shall delegate his powers of making Statutes to the Board of Advisors, and other functions that he may deem necessary. Such a Board would make Statutes as and when required and submit the same to the Governor for his assent.â\n\nâThe Chief Secretary of the Province shall be the Secretary to the Board of Advisors. He shall be an officer who would be able to understand records in the language of records of the province. Tamil is the language of records of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The President shall also appoint an Advocate General to the Province, or in the alternative appoint a Legal Advisor to the Governor of the Province. The main function of this officer will be to provide legal advice on the preparation of Statutes.â\n\nâIn the Annexure to this Memorandum, we give restructuring that need to be undertaken before any election is contemplated for the Provincial Councils of the North and East. It is our assessment that such a restructuring will take a period of around six months. We therefore urge that once the restructurings have been completed, the Elections Commission calls for nominations for the Provincial Council elections, may be, during the second half of January 2024, and conduct the elections with the procedures laid down.â\n\nWhen the TNA declined to serve in a committee to study the interim arrangement, President Wickremesinghe warned he would have to go ahead without them. Moreover, he said he would have to make it known that the TNA was not willing to serve. It was C.V. Wigneswaranâs view that the enforcement of the interim measures would help the government to conduct Presidential polls early and the provincial council elections later.\n\nThere is little doubt that the government has gained complete control of the defence and security establishment, a sine qua non for any elections. However, resolving key issues related to ethnic reconciliation seems an uphill task for President Wickremesinghe."
