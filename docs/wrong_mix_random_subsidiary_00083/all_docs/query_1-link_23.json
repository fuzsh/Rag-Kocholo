        "text": "You don’t have to worry about singer-actress Jill Scott. Sure, the past few years have been tough for the Philadelphia native, who not only went through a break-up in her personal life but also in her career when she parted ways with her record label. That somewhat explains why it took Scott four years to release new CD “The Light of the Sun,” the follow-up to 2007’s “The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3.” “I always take breaks in between recording and performing,” said Scott, calling from the road somewhere between Philadelphia and Boston. “It’s very important to me to try to keep a balance. The entertaining life can be so over the top that I have to go home, and I have to do simple things. I have to re-pot plants and just read some books and talk to friends and go bike riding and do simple things. It’s easy to get caught up in this lifestyle, and it’s just a lifestyle.” For the past decade, that lifestyle was built around a successful recording career, beginning with her 2000 double-platinum debut, “Who is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1.” All told, she’s released four studio albums, sold more than 5 million records, won three Grammy Awards and helped define the neo-soul movement. In addition she became a working actress (“Girlfriends,” “Why Did I Get Married?” and “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency”). While Scott awaits that one “meaty” role, which she admits she may have to write herself, the 39-year-old singer felt it was time to return to her love of music. For “The Light of the Sun,” her modus operandi was all about exploration without pressure. “I wanted to feel free, create free and enjoy music freely,” Scott said. “I’m an old-school hip-hop girl. I enjoy that sound and imagery, and that’s pretty much the gist of it. I love live musicianship, so I called some friends in — some great musicians — and just asked them to play until the feeling felt right. Sometimes it took four or five hours until we were there, but when we were there we were completely there. That was really exciting to me and it just felt good.” Among her favorites are the ’30s ragtime piano-esque “All Cried Out Redux” and the organic-sounding “Le BOOM Vent Suite.” She’s looking forward to playing the new material on her Budweiser Superfest “Summer Block Party Tour,” which includes a show Wednesday at Jacobs Pavilion at Nautica. Scott said she’s can’t wait to return to fashion-conscious Northeast Ohio. “Cleveland is always a really good audience,” Scott said. “The folks are singing, and you guys normally come dressed up, too. I guess it’s because Cleveland is sharp. But this time it’s a block party, so you don’t have to get dressed up for this one at all. Summer-casual works for me.” Will she be dressing summer casual, as well? “Oh, well, I’m at work,” Scott laughed. “I’ll probably have on something a little bit dressier, but don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about me.” Details What: Budweiser Superfest “Summer Block Party Tour” featuring Jill Scott, Anthony. Hamilton, Mint Condition, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Doug E. Fresh. When: 7 p.m. Wednesday. Where: Jacobs Pavilion at Nautica, 2014 Sycamore St., Cleveland. Tickets: $59.75 to $99.75 at Ticketmaster outlets. Info: 216-241-5555 or\n\nwww.ticketmaster.com\n\n. Jill Scott’s “Shame” video:"
