        "text": "By borrowing from computer coding strategies or computer-based communication tools and rules, by re-thinking typo-graphic and layout strategies, the digital or electronic short forms of twenty-first century e-pistolary novels are made of are crossbreeds that expressively capture and mirror the fragmented, often simultaneous and multi(p)layer, nature of the contemporary conversation threads within a pervasive communicative environment. The result is that e-pistolary fiction revises correspondence typologies, thematic patterns, conventions, techniques and rules at various levels, namely narrative, symbolic, linguistic while disrupting the linearity of the book form through high discontinuity as well as refashioning and jeopardizing one of the strongest assumptions of epistolary novels, i.e. materiality. Not intended as an investigation of traditional letter novels, the aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it intends to provide a preliminary mapping of some of the computer-mediated short forms and their re-shaping in literary works in book form: to this end, somenarratives are briefly introduced as specimens of twenty-first century e-pistolary novels and some of their salient features highlighted - a question that has as yet received little critical attention. Four are the examples that have been selected: Microserfs (1995) and J-Pod (2006) by Douglas Coupland; The PowerBook (2000), by Jeanette Winterson; and Black Box (2012) by Jennifer Egan. On the other hand, this paper discusses e2 A novel (2010), the second e-pistolary novel by British author Matt Beaumont, as a case study of a remediation in print of some born-digital short forms compiled through an almost filmic montage: an effective rethinking of the letter novel that cleverly combines a multitude of characters, several subplots, and a variety of text types that are a collection of electronic messages emerging from the contemporary digital environment rather than from literary history or tradition.\n\nThanks to progress in learning and in postal organization, the letter becomes an important medium for communicating information and can be viewed as a precursor to the modern gazette. So the evolution of the epistolary form facilitates news circulation concerning politics, literature, family and society: it's the main way used by aristocracy and bourgeoisie to find news (Grassi, 1994 : 302). So the readers are impatient to receive a letter to enliven an ordinary life. The value of a letter lies in several aspects considering that the \"art\" of letter writing under the Ancien Régime in France clearly has an ethic as well as an aesthetic importance, a politic as well as a poetic component. So letters published as \"art\" under Classicism are always transformed into illustrations of the \"art\" of writing letters where the writing subject is positioned as a loyal (male) servant of an aristocratic order revolving around an absolute king 1. However, epistolary novel gives arise in the second half of the eighteenth century. The beginning of the Eighteenth is dominated by memoirs in which the protagonists offer their experience of life and love. The principle quality, attributed to a letter, is its capacity to transmit feelings immediately: in fact, a letter avoids temporal distance between lived experience and its written expression. In this way, the absence of a narrator guarantees the authenticity of narration because nobody can talk or think in place of characters (Burel, 2012: 506) 2. 1. \"This writer serves the monarch through public speech acts that constitute a predictable and universally imitable model of courtesy. The counter current to this dominant Classical model, which coexists with it from the outset, is epistolary 'art' interpreted as inimitable but inspiring emulation, because it is understood to emanate from differing, private literary spaces that articulate the particularities of historical contingency. The latter concept of epistolary art generates discourses of cultural difference, which will assume a renewed ascendancy in the eighteenth century\" (Altman, 1986: 62). 2. P. V. Conroy analyses the principal elements concerning the French epistolary genre (epistolary choice, public and authenticity) in this way: \"By adopting the epistolary format, the novel took upon itself that particular way of rendering the outside world that the letter had already conditioned the reading public to accept as normal. To the extent that fictitious novel followed the same conventions and satisfied the same expectations as did American Research Journal of English and Literature Abstract: The eighteenth century is considered as the golden age of epistolary art. If we analyse the historical and social value of letters, we notice that epistolary exchange soon becomes one of the principal ways of communication and of providing information. One of the most important qualities of the epistolary novel is its ability to effectively convey emotion. The epistolary novel removes the temporal distance between personal history and its written form. The most famous writers of the time (such as Montesquieu) and libertine writers (Laclos and Sade in particular) employed the epistolary novel in different ways. So eighteenth-century literature is characterised by the successful epistolary novel. Since the Modern Age letter has held great historical and social importance due to the power of letter to act as a vehicle for information. This emerges as one of the main reasons for the rise in popularity of the epistolary novel.\n\nThese three short papers were initially formulated as contributions to a roundtable discussion on The Novel and Media held at Harvard University’s Mahindra Humanities Center in May 2018. Their brief was to contribute to the recent project of methodological reflection set in train by a resurgence of formalist analysis in literary criticism by thinking about the intersection of the novel form, novel theory, and media studies; at the most general level our challenge was to reflect upon the relation between the medium and the form of the literary text, and beyond that about the relation between the print medium in which the novel originated and the other media which form its environment and on which it frequently reflects. We start, then, with a reading of one of the most influential recent attempts to rethink formalist analysis, Caroline Levine’s Forms; John Frow contrasts her project with Jonathan Grossman’s Kittlerian reading of The Pickwick Papers in terms of the relation between two media of communication (coaching and the postal service) and the two novelistic forms that ‘correspond’ to them, in order to open up some questions about the limits and the appropriate focus of an analysis of novelistic forms. Melissa Hardie then moves to a consideration of the novelistic medium at its most material, taking the ‘queer materiality’ of Alvin Lustig’s 1948 jacket design for Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood as an index both of the ‘pulp’ presentation by which modernist texts acquired a wider readership and of the ‘queer ekphrasis’ of the novel itself. And Kelly Rich reads Zadie Smith’s NW as offering a robust account of the encounter between the novel as a narrative genre and various forms of digital media. In Alan Liu’s words, the novel is engaged in and works to illuminate the ‘thick, unpredictable zone of contact … where (mis)understandings of new media are negotiated along twisting, partial, and contradictory vectors’.\n\nTo acknowledge that the beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed the rise of literary narratives that make extensive use of visual or graphic elements such as photographs, typographical experimentations, unusual page layouts, drawings, illustrations, etc., is not a novelty per se. Neither is it, in recent years, to explore digital narratives and their affordances. Rather, these explorations have received much attention in narrative theory and in contemporary literary and cultural criticism. Since the digital turn, new studies have approached both subjects. However, while most of these studies are either inquiries into new digital devices and digital narratives (e.g., digital narratology) or focus on experimentations with the materiality of the book (e.g., multimodal narrative), this article will consider the two issues as part of the same phenomenon. On the one hand, literary experimentations with the materiality of the book have been especially flourishing since the emergence of new digital technologies. On the other hand, contemporary fictional writers, who are becoming more and more aware of the affordances offered by digital media, have started exploiting the properties of these new technologies to supplement their print narratives. These new but recurrent practices are thus both historically grounded in the socio-cultural context of the twenty-first century and consistent with a knowledge-sharing mode embedded in web 2.0 technologies. As I will show, the correlation between (a) the materiality of the book and (b) the digital supplementary material to be found on writers’ personal websites and blogs and in social media finds its origins in Gérard Genette’s concept of paratext and, in particular, in his subdivision into (a) peritext, i.e. the paratextual elements situated in proximity of the text, and (b) epitext, i.e. the paratextual elements “not materially appended to the text within the same volume, but circulating [...] in a virtually limitless physical and social space” (Genette [1987] 1997: 344). In the first section of this article, I highlight how the concept of paratext, despite some lacks and ambivalences, is still able to offer a valuable perspective on contemporary practices. I will introduce recent investigations on issues of media, mode, and materiality in order to contextualize my study in a wider cultural and theoretical discourse. The second section analyzes how paratextual elements are employed in a contemporary novel, Jennifer Egan’s A Visit From the Goon Squad (2010). This analysis sheds new light on the way visual and digital elements may be used in a literary narrative. Drawing on this paradigmatic case, the third section puts forth my proposal of “paratext 2.0.” Formed by the categories of material peritext and digital epitext, the conceptualization of paratexts 2.0 allows for the identification of several functions. Far from containing a definitive reconfiguration of paratext for literary narrative in the digital age, this article provides new a vocabulary and, more significantly, new insights to answer some of the urgent questions twenty-first century literary practices are posing to narrative theory."
