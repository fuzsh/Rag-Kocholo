        "text": "Dean E. Peters, 62, of Quincy, passed away at 4:19 am Monday, July 15, 2024, at Blessing Hospital in Quincy, IL.\n\nDean was born June 21, 1962, in Quincy, IL to Dwight and Bette (Caine) Peters. He attended Quincy High School, where he graduated in the early 1980s, setting the stage for a life of service and community involvement. Dean’s commitment to his country was unwavering, as he served with honor in the United States Army before continuing his service with the Army Corp of Engineers for 22 years. His dedication to his work was matched only by his faith, as he was a devoted member of The Crossing Church.\n\nOn December 27, 1985, Dean married the love of his life, Aneta DeWeese, in a ceremony surrounded by family and friends. Their union was blessed with two children, Darin Peters and Crichette Gower (Joey), who brought immeasurable joy to Dean’s life. He was a doting grandfather to five grandchildren: Thalia, Taylin, Alivia, Paxton, and Paizlynn, each of whom he cherished deeply. Dean’s family circle also included his sister, Janet Ancell (Chuck), and his nephews, Jason Zwick (Stacy Davis) and Joey Zwick (Jill), all of whom survive him and will hold his memory dear.\n\nDean’s zest for life was evident in his many interests and hobbies. He was an avid enthusiast of dirt bikes and motorcycles, with a collection that grew over the years. His love for the outdoors was clear to all who knew him, as he relished car rides and walks by the river, his favorite place. Kayaking at Bear Creek was a treasured pastime, as was playing poker at the Lock & Dam. Dean’s sense of humor was infectious, and he was always ready for a bit of fun.\n\nAbove all, Dean was a family man through and through. He found joy in the simple pleasures of life, like singing silly songs with his grandchildren, cheering on his grandson’s Jr. Sprint car races, and savoring the treats from his granddaughters’ Easy-Bake Oven. His presence at family gatherings was a source of happiness and comfort, and his absence will be deeply felt.\n\nDean was preceded in death by his parents, Dwight and Bette Peters, and his twin sister, Judy Peters.\n\nDean E. Peters lived a life marked by joy, service, and an unwavering commitment to his loved ones. His memory will be treasured by all who had the privilege of knowing him, and his legacy will continue to inspire those he has left behind.\n\nFriends and Family are invited to Dean’s Life Celebration at a visitation that will be Friday, July 19, 2024, from 10:00 am to 11:00 am at O’Donnell-Cookson Life Celebration Home in Quincy, IL. A memorial service will follow at 11:00 am with Pastor Zach Campbell officiating. Burial will follow at Quincy Memorial Park in Quincy, IL with full military honors being given by the United States Army Funeral Honors Detail and American Legion Post #37.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to Aneta Peters to help with expenses.\n\nOnline condolences may be shared and video tribute may be viewed at www.ODonnellCookson.com."
