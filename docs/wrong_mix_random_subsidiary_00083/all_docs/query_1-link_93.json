        "text": "Roy Keane was playfully branded a \"k***head\" by Jill Scott in yet another enthralling episode of the Stick to Football podcast - hitting back by calling the England legend a \"classy lady\".\n\nThe duo have combined for several hilarious moments on the show that also includes Gary Neville and Ian Wright but they perhaps took it to new heights in a recent edition of the popular podcast that's been churning out content in Germany throughout England's run to the final of Euro 2024.\n\nWith the quartet discussing how their names had fallen out of fashion - with only under 30 Garys born in 2021 - they decided to rename Ian Wright, 'Teddy'. This led to Scott brutally telling Keane that instead of Roy, he should now be known as \"k***head\".\n\nThe Irishman hit back at his female counterpart, sarcastically dubbing her a \"classy lady\" before asking whether she'll be articulating her \"vulgar\" vocabulary at Wimbledon.\n\nThe topic of tennis was discussed on the show with Andy Murray making his last Wimbledon appearance last week ahead of his retirement from the sport following the Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nWhile Scott, Wright, and Neville discussed the sadness of the Scotsman coming to the end of his illustrious career, Keane didn't share the same sympathy. He said: \"He's 37 years old, had a brilliant career but had plenty of injuries, so he should count his blessings that he's had such a successful career.\n\n\"He must have been crying… although it's okay to cry. That's not sad news. It's good news. He's got a lovely family. Good luck to him. He had a brilliant career. They talk about him playing in a great era… we were up against the great Barcelona. He could have been with Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe!\"\n\nWith all the talk of Murray's prowess on the court, Scott revealed her tennis skills as a youngster saw her become the under-13 champion in her native Sunderland.\n\nWhile Neville suggested there may not be many tennis courts in her hometown, Keane was right on time with a quip as he retorted: \"That's why she's the champion. There was no playing! Jesus.\""
