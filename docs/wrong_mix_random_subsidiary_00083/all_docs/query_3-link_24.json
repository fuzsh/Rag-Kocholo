The training covers the foundations of NACO including the shared database environment, MARC 21 format, and documentation sources. Each day focuses on a different topic such as describing persons, corporate bodies, or places. The training also covers principles for working in a shared database such as making changes to existing records, related record requirements, and the parameters for NACO contributions and deletions.\n\nRelated slideshows\n\nкшенский (1)\n\nкшенский (1)\n\nArt NACO Pasadena 2013-04-29: Family Names\n\nArt NACO Pasadena 2013-04-29: Family Names\n\nArt NACO Pasadena 2013-04-29: Personal Names\n\nArt NACO Pasadena 2013-04-29: Personal Names\n\nArt NACO Pasadena 2013-04-29: Foundations\n\n1.

Day 5: Making Changes to Existing NARs and NACO Administration • Changes to NARs (DCM Z1) • Review LC-PCC PSs & DCM Z1 • Practicum and exercises • NACO administrative details 8Module 1. Foundations\n\n9. Day 1: NACO Foundations This module is designed to introduce NACO participants to: • The shared database environment • PCC NACO principles and parameters • MARC 21 Authority Format • LC Guidelines Supplement to MARC 21 • DCM Z1 9Module 1. Foundations\n\n10. NACO Principles: Authorities in a Shared Database 10Module 1. Foundations\n\n11. Standards in Card Catalogs “The Card Division” in the early 1900s 11Module 1. Foundations\n\n12. Standards Today • We have moved away from limitations of card catalogs • LC is a member of PCC and must meet the same standards as any NACO library 12Module 1. Foundations\n\n14. Name Authority Cooperative Program (NACO) • Over 785 NACO members –Full-level members –NACO funnel projects • Funnels may be based on geography, specialization (art, music), or language • NACO partners contribute name authority records to LC database via utilities 14Module 1. Foundations\n\n15. Exchanging Records • More standardization required • Local systems/utilities are different • Earlier MARC formats were diverse (US MARC, CanMARC, UK MARC) • MARC 21 is more universal 15Module 1. Foundations\n\n16. MARC 21 to BIBFRAME • Efforts are underway to transition from MARC 21 to a new bibliographic framework • Collaborative process • Focus: translate the MARC 21 format to a linked data model – While retaining as much as possible the robust and beneficial aspects of MARC • Proposed model: BIBFRAME – http://bibframe.org/ 16Module 1. Foundations\n\n17. 17 Authority Record Creation and Distribution Utilities British Library LC/NACO AUTHORITY FILE (NAF) Utilities (such as OCLC and SkyRiver) and the British Library contribute authority records, which are then sent to LC. Each morning all contributed authority records, including LC’s, are redistributed to the BL, the utilities, and all CDS customers. Module 1. Foundations 17\n\n18. High Value – Low Effort NACO’s goal: • To build a name authority file • For the greatest good of all • With the least amount of effort by participants 18Module 1. Foundations\n\n19. Dynamic File • The LC/NACO Authority File is a dynamic file, changing every 24 hours • Any record may be changed by another NACO participant for appropriate reasons 19Module 1. Foundations\n\n20. The Catalog Serves the Users According to the Statement of International Cataloging Principles: • Controlled access points should be provided for the authorized and variant forms of names • Controlled access points provide the consistency needed for collocating the bibliographic records for sets of resources 20Module 1. Foundations\n\n21. NARs and the NAF • Name authority record (NAR) shows authorized access point and variant access points • LC/NACO Authority File (NAF) includes all NARs • Libraries choose levels of authority control • DCM Z1 Introduction describes LC’s policies for when to create a name authority record 21Module 1. Foundations\n\n22. Cataloger’s Judgment • Use judgment when applying many instructions • A different choice isn’t always an error, so respect the judgment of your colleagues • Leave a correct, unique authorized access point alone 22Module 1. Foundations\n\n23. Specific Practices • A practice may not apply equally to all parts of NACO work e.g., Geographic names always require research, but personal names seldom do 23Module 1. Foundations\n\n24. Focus on Work in Hand • Focus on records related to an item being cataloged • NACO (including LC) catalogers are discouraged from cruising the database to find errors to report 24Module 1. Foundations\n\n25. Go To the Source • Ask the other library’s NACO contact if you notice problems in an authority record • NACO liaisons: http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/pccliaisons. html 25Module 1. Foundations\n\n26. NACO Parameters • Documentation • Contribution guidelines—PCC • Changes to existing NARs • Cancellation of NARs • Bibliographic File Maintenance (BFM) • Searching (why, how, and when) • Normalization rules 26Module 1. Foundations\n\n27. NACO Parameter: Documentation • RDA Toolkit • LC-PCC PSs • MARC 21 Authority Format • LC Guidelines Supplement to the MARC 21 Authority Format • Descriptive Cataloging Manual (DCM : Z1) 27Module 1. Foundations\n\n28. Use Both RDA and LC-PCC PSs • RDA gives the basic instructions • LC-PCC PSs give further explanations, additional applications, and examples • LC-PCC PSs tell which RDA options and alternatives to apply LC-PCC PSs take precedence over RDA 28Module 1. Foundations\n\n29. 29 29 MARC 21 Format : Cataloger’s Desktop Module 1. Foundations\n\n30. LC Guidelines Supplement to MARC 21 Authority Format • Instructions for LC, NACO, SACO, series, subjects practices • Many have the statement “Do not use this field/subfield” 30Module 1. Foundations\n\n32. Descriptive Cataloging Manual (DCM Z1): Name and Series Authority Records • Instructions on handling NAR and SAR practices • LC & PCC practices where they differ • NACO normalization • Examples 32Module 1.

Place name or corporate body in qualifier • If a place name or a corporate body is used in a qualifier, it must be established 110 2_ Galleria d'arte contemporanea (Turin, Italy) 151 Turin (Italy) 130 _0 Circular (New York State Museum) 110 2_ New York State Museum 64 Must be established! Module 1. Foundations\n\n65. 65 NACO Parameter : Changes to existing NARs All authorized access points in the NAF are eligible to be changed by all NACO participants Module 1. Foundations\n\n66. 66 NACO Parameter : Deletion of NARs • Only LC catalogers can delete NARs in the NAF • NACO libraries notify LC to delete NARs • LC/NACO database is redistributed daily to the utilities Module 1. Foundations\n\n67. 67 NACO Parameter : Bibliographic File Maintenance (BFM) LC bibliographic records (as distributed by CDS) must remain in synch with the NAF NACO partners must notify LC when certain types of changes to NARs affect authorized access points used on LC bibliographic records http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/bfmguide.html Module 1. Foundations\n\n68. BFM : Examples • BFM NOT required: changes to authorized access points – e.g., revised authorized access point including a death date – Reports are generated by bibliographic utilities • BFM required: new NAR is created for a person previously on an undifferentiated NAR (and LC bib records are affected) 68Module 1. Foundations\n\n69. 69 NACO Parameter : Searching Catalogers keep the database clean by searching for related records before contributing an authority record to the LC/NACO Authority File Module 1. Foundations\n\n70. 70 Why Search? (1) To prevent duplicate NARs • Authorized access point for entity already established? • OCLC de-dupe detection and validation programs need to be run • Report deletions to Cooperative Programs Section Module 1. Foundations\n\n71. 71 Why Search? (2) • To avoid conflict in authorized access points and variant access points – Information on normalization rules coming up • To gather information from existing bibliographic records Module 1. Foundations\n\n72. Why Search? (3) • To identify existing records that may need to be evaluated and re-coded for RDA – Presence of 667 note: THIS 1XX FIELD CANNOT BE USED UNDER RDA UNTIL THIS RECORD HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND/OR UPDATED • To identify and re-code an existing RDA-acceptable AACR2 NAR to RDA • More information: Summary of Programmatic Changes to the LC/NACO Authority File http://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/pdf/lcnaf_rdaphase.pdf 72Module 1. Foundations\n\n73. 73 Why search? (4) • To identify bibliographic records that will need BFM • To revise an existing NAR  Personal name changes  Corporate earlier-later  Other revisions Module 1. Foundations\n\n74. 74 Searching : How? • Search bibliographic and authority files • Maybe even subject headings in bibliographic and authority records • Search more than one form, e.g.: Fowler, Esther Miller Fowler, E. Miller, E. Miller, Esther Miller, E. Anne • Search both the authorized access point and the variant access points Module 1. Foundations\n\n77. Searching : When? • Don’t leave authority records in the save file too long • Search again if 24 hours pass to:  Avoid conflicts  Avoid duplicates 77 Remember: 24 Hour Rule to Avoid Duplicate Access Points Module 1. Foundations\n\n78. NACO Normalization • Normalization is the conversion of a text string to a normalized form • Text strings that normalize to the same form are considered to be duplicates and must be differentiated from each other • The goal of normalization is to ensure that each authorized access point is unique 78Module 1. Foundations\n\n79. Normalization: Documentation • DCM Z1: Introduction 79Module 1. Foundations\n\n80. Normalization: Documentation • Linked from NACO Documentation & Updates 80Module 1. Foundations\n\n81. Impact of Normalization • Until early in 2013, “non-unique” or “undifferentiated” personal name NARs were sometimes created due to normalization • Beginning in January 2013, NACO catalogers were asked to avoid creating new undifferentiated personal name authority records (or adding to existing ones) 81Module 1. Foundations\n\n82. 82 NACO Normalization • OCLC and SkyRiver run databases against a computer program using NACO Normalization rules • Error reports on duplicates and conflicts come to LC – Coop catalogers handle them Module 1. Foundations\n\n83. 83 What happens in the Normalization process? • All letters are converted to upper case • Modified letters are converted to unmodified letters • All diacritics are removed Module 1. Foundations\n\n84. 84 What happens in the Normalization process? • Most punctuation is removed. – Exceptions: first comma in subfield a; hyphen in birth and death dates • Subfield delimiters and subfield codes are retained and considered • The contents of 1XX, 4XX, and 5XX fields are compared Module 1. Foundations\n\n85. 85 Tags Are Not Compared • MARC 21 tags are NOT considered when the computer compares access points for uniqueness –Subfield codes ARE considered • Different MARC tags (100, 110, 111, 151, 130) do not make an authorized access point unique Module 1. Foundations\n\n86. 86 What happens to the symbols? • Deleted with no space remaining: [ ] ′ • Replaced by a blank space: @ ? / () = “ , - • Unchanged: - & + # b apostrophe quotation mark musical sharp musical flat Comma after first one in birth/death dates except in birth/death dates Module 1. Foundations\n\n87. 87 What is Compared? Line of characters that are part of the tagged field (character “string”) 100 1 _ Le Bret, $c Monsieur $q (Alexis-Jean), $d 1693-1772?

Normalized match between •1XX vs. 1XXs •4XX vs. 1XXs & 5XXs •4XX vs. 4XX in same record But •5XX must normalize to 1XXs •4XX to 4XX is fine in different records Module 1.
