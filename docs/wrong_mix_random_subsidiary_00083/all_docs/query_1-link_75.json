        "text": "—\n\nBy Christina Fuoco-Karasinski | For The Flint Journal\n\nGrammy Award-winning singer Jill Scott guarantees that her Saturday concert with Maxwell at The Palace of Auburn Hills will be an evening of \"music.\"\n\nAnd she doesn't say that lightly.\n\n\"People put things in boxes and say, 'Oh, it's music,'\" Scott said. \"This is something different. There are a lot of musicians on stage. There's a live performer without any autotuning or anything recorded previously. It's a live energy performance from myself and Maxwell. It's really a pleasure to offer this to everybody.\"\n\nScott — who will be performing hits spanning her 10-year career starting from her double platinum, Grammy-nominated debut album \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol.1\" through her upcoming album \"The Light of the Sun: Words and Sounds, Vol. 4\" — said the show is a great opportunity for fans.\n\n\"It's going to be a great night of music: Real music, real musicians, real vocalists in real time,\" Scott said. \"I think that's fantastic not only for the people who are going to come, but us as well. Within the music industry as a whole, there is a market for live performances. There is a market for it. I think the industry may have forgotten there's a market for something that is genuine. Everything is fixed and precise these days. I don't think that's what music is at all. I think music is a real expression of a human being.\"\n\nScott is a renaissance woman. Recently seen as \"Janice Raleigh,\" a woman who beat her disabled sister on \"Law and Order: SVU,\" she also had the lead role in HBO's critically acclaimed mini-series \"The No.1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,\" directed by the late Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella. Along with prepping two movies, a cartoon series, and a new bra for her Ashley Stewart intimate apparel line, she is in the throes of recording her new album set for release in 2010.\n\n\"I feel strongly about it coming out in 2010,\" Scott said about the album. \"I'm not rushing. I look at my work as food. I have to cut the wood, and then I have to make the fire, and I have to take my time with it. It's not microwave food. I'm a potbelly stove.\"\n\nAlthough she's unsure of the release date, she can guarantee one thing: \"The Light of the Sun\" will be revealing to a certain degree and it will include \"a lot of genres of music.\"\n\n\"I'm a method singer so I have to be in the emotion in order to sing a song,\" Scott said. \"I'm digging in a couple places. I'm freeing myself and, hopefully, other people as well from hurt and loneliness and confusion in a sense. For me, I'm the kind of artist where I like to explore those things in myself. It can be difficult but I've chosen to go into the studio and just sing. Most of it is freestyled so that there's nothing blocking the way. I'm not in my way. That's freehand, but without the hand.\"\n\nBut of everything she's accomplished during her 10-year career, she's most proud of her audience.\n\n\"I fully foresee and hoped in the very beginning that I'd have a career, something like Frankie Beverly or Barbra Streisand or Bette Midler,\" Scott said. \"Even when I'm 60 years old, I want to go out and perform a show and it'll be sold out. I'm hoping and praying for longevity. Ten years is great but I'd like another 15, 20 if I can...maybe more.\n\n\"I'm really proud that when the audience comes out they know the words. They sing along. They put their arms in the air. They enjoy themselves and they allow themselves just to be for a night, without dealing with issues.\n\n“Or sometimes I look out and people are crying. That means I've tapped into a place that they need to let go of or look at or be honest with. That makes me feel really proud.\""
