        "text": "Empowering Veterans + Survivors\n\nWe believe veterans and families of the fallen are critical resources to unite communities and strengthen our national character. In order to adequately equip them for their role as leaders, Travis Manion Foundation is committed to providing them with personal development and training to grow and thrive. Our programming addresses the needs of veterans and survivors, and meets them where they are – beginning with mental health and wellness, and continuing to community support. Armed with these resources, they are empowered to serve and unite communities while addressing our country’s most pressing challenges.\n\nThis year, TMF continued to increase opportunities for veterans and families of the fallen to access personal development and mental health resources, as well as build community through in-person engagements. First, thousands of veterans, survivors and inspired civilians completed our Leading With Your Strengths course, available in person and online through our Spartan Development Center sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.\n\nFinally, our immersive 7-month Spartan Leadership Program also continued its incredible impact by helping to develop a selected group of leaders dedicated to creating actionable change in their communities.\n\nWith 1 in 3 youth reporting they have no positive role model in their lives, developing character is one of the most impactful ways our Mentors serve. Powered by Under Armour, our best-in-class Character Does Matter program allowed Mentors to connect with and provide character education to nearly 43,000 youth online and in person. More than 350 veterans and families of the fallen joined our network of Mentors, which has allowed us to continue expanding the program and developing character in even more communities.\n\nAdditionally this year, TMF also empowered families of the fallen to serve on Expeditions that helped them address meal insecurities, renovate homes and community centers, and serve elderly veterans. In total, more than 105 survivors honored their fallen loved ones on service Expeditions to Atlanta, Montana, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and New Orleans.\n\nOur ongoing effort to prepare and empower volunteers nationwide helped us keep a pulse on communities and appropriately respond when pressing needs arose. That cooperation was evident in focused efforts for Veterans Day and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, where TMF Chapters activated volunteers for service projects that addressed meal insecurities, community beautification, and renovating and rebuilding homes.\n\nFor the first time, TMF veterans and survivors also helped shoulder an economic burden among families as students prepared to start a new school year in fall 2021. As part of our inaugural Back to School Character Days initiative, Mentors provided a day of mentorship and backpacks full of school supplies to over 2,500 youth across the country.\n\nIn addition to service projects that honor fallen heroes, two major initiatives this year that paid tribute to those who served and sacrificed for our country included #TheHonorProject and our recognition of the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001. Hundreds of volunteers paid tribute to over 4,000 fallen service members on Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery, standing in for family members and battle buddies who could not visit their loved ones on the day of remembrance.\n\nThen, on the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, our annual 9/11 Heroes Runs brought together more than 60,000 participants in small- and large-scale community events aimed at honoring the sacrifices of that day and the wars since. Race events returned in 90 communities nationwide to unite communities in honor of our fallen and veterans who have served since the attacks.\n\nStrengthening Veteran + Survivor Leaders\n\nIn 2021, two cohorts of veterans and survivor leaders completed the 7-month Spartan Leadership Program journey of character-based learning, self-discovery, and experiential leadership development. Through a blend of in-person and virtual engagements, veterans and families of the fallen were challenged to reflect on and develop a deeper understanding of personal values, strengths, and purpose. The experience culminated with each member developing a comprehensive plan of action to enact meaningful change in their communities. Due to initial success of the Spartan Leadership Program, TMF has increased the size of each cohort to develop more changemakers nationwide.\n\nMarine Veteran Finds Purpose + Renewed Call to Serve\n\nMarine Veteran Chuck Segel, who was serving alongside 1stLt Travis Manion when he gave the ultimate sacrifice in 2007, fought depression, PTSD, and losing his sense of purpose upon leaving the military. After years of struggling on his own, he connected with TMF and found healing through giving back to his community. Now a highly engaged Spartan leader and TMF service project leader, Chuck has reconnected with his drive to serve and the feeling of belonging he’d lost years before.\n\nSurviving Parents Honor Fallen Soldier Son through TMF Service\n\nWe continued to impact families of the fallen like Steve and Susan Cavanaugh, who traveled to Anchorage, Alaska on a TMF Expedition to honor their son, SPC Max Cavanaugh. Alongside other survivors, they paid tribute to Max by repairing and rebuilding the home of a Gold Star mother and assisting a local veterans home. Since then, they have continued to build bonds in the survivor community and carry on their son’s legacy of service through numerous other TMF Expeditions and service projects.\n\nMarine Veteran Brings Lessons in Character to St. Louis Step Team\n\nAfter years serving as a Character Does Matter Mentor, Marine Veteran Chris Randall has realized the value of the “If Not Me, Then Who…” ethos with youth in his hometown of St. Louis. A longtime advocate and co-founder of a local boys' step team, Chris began incorporating Character Does Matter lessons into his weekly rehearsals. Now, Chris’ passion has not only helped to develop their character; he and the CDM curriculum have inspired them to begin serving in their communities.\n\nAfter the Afghanistan withdrawal, tens of thousands of U.S. allies were evacuated and brought to the United States to start new lives. They lacked support networks, essential resources, and guidance on navigating life in a foreign land. In partnership with the American Red Cross, TMF first deployed groups of veterans and families of the fallen to military bases where evacuees were being housed following their exit from Afghanistan. We then continued to form bonds with five local Afghan families in several communities throughout the country, offering support in finding essential services, mentoring and engaging Afghan youth, learning English, and navigating everyday life. Additionally, TMF provided our veterans and families of the fallen struggling with news related to the withdrawal with community support and access to free mental health resources like Check-In. The tool connects veterans and their families with free clinical care.\n\nAfter a devastating tornado hit Mayfield, KY, in late December 2021, local Veteran Mentors knew they had to act. With support from TMF and Spartans within their network, the team gathered over 1,000 pounds of food and supplies and immediately drove them to Kentucky. After arriving, they were able to connect with a local church managing a supply distribution center and help feed over 100 people. They also distributed TMF clothing to those receiving support throughout Mayfield and shared several stories of fallen heroes with the community.\n\nFollowing several different national crises - including the withdrawal in Afghanistan - TMF continued to conduct mental health buddy checks with our Spartans across the country and offer emotional support, when necessary. TMF is a proud member of the Veterans Wellness Alliance through the George W. Bush Institute. Through this partnership, we’ve directly connected our veterans and families of the fallen with no-cost mental health resources and clinical care. We know that our mission of empowering veterans and survivors to develop character in future generations begins by ensuring those within our community are well."
