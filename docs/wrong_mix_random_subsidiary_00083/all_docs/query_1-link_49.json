        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- âLove yourself a little bit more every day.â\n\nThatâs the resounding message three-time Grammy winner Jill Scott shared with the packed crowd at the Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater on March 7. The Philly songstressâ stop in Austin was the third leg of her âWho is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol 1â national tour. Moonchild performed as a special guest.\n\nThe North American tour is named for Scott's debut album and is a celebration of her 20 years in the music business since its release in 2000. Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1 peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200 chart, \"bringing her unique brand of R&B and spoken word to a mainstream audience,\" according to her artist page on the Grammys website. The debut launched the singles \"Gettin' in the Way,\" \"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)\" and \"A Long Walk,\" which landed in the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 that year.\n\nJill Scott performs in Austin in this image from March 7, 2020. (Nicole Cross/Spectrum News)\n\nAudience members from all walks of life chanted and screamed as Scott sang about relationships, self-love and female empowerment. Her set list was every song from that first album, sung in order, plus two others at the end âHate on Meâ and âGoldenâ which left the crowd begging for more.\n\nThe 21-city tour kicked off in Kansas City, Missouri. The last stop of the North American portion of the tour is June 20, 2020 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California."
