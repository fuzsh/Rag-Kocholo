        "text": "Roy Keane was humorously labelled a \"k***head\" by Jill Scott, who sarcastically responded by calling her a \"classy lady\" on the Stick to Football podcast.\n\nThe show, which also features Gary Neville and Ian Wright, has been producing content in Germany throughout England's journey to the Euro 2024 final.\n\nDuring a discussion about their names falling out of fashion, with fewer than 30 babies named Gary born in 2021, they decided to rename Ian Wright 'Teddy', which prompted Scott to suggest that Keane should henceforth be known as \"k***head\".\n\nREAD MORE:Man United great Roy Keane's brilliant reaction to Ollie Watkins England winner\n\nREAD MORE: Roy Keane admits he's been asked to ‘go easy’ on footballer he’s grilled as a pundit\n\nKeane responded by mockingly referring to Scott as a \"classy lady\", questioning whether she would use such \"vulgar\" language at Wimbledon. The conversation then turned to tennis, following Andy Murray's final Wimbledon appearance before his retirement after the Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nWhile Scott, Wright, and Neville expressed sadness at the end of the Scotsman's starring career, Keane showed less sympathy, stating: \"He's 37 years old, had a brilliant career but had plenty of injuries, so he should count his blessings that he's had such a successful career.\n\n\"He must have been crying... although it's okay to cry. That's not sad news. It's good news. He's got a lovely family. Good luck to him. He had a brilliant career. They talk about him playing in a great era... we were up against the great Barcelona. He could have been with Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe!\"\n\nScott, who was an under-13 champion in her hometown of Sunderland, also shared her own tennis experiences before Neville suggested that there might not be many tennis courts in Sunderland, to which Keane humorously responded: \"That's why she's the champion. There was no playing! Jesus.\"\n\nKeane, Neville, and Wright will be on hand to deliver analysis of the Euro 2024 final on Sunday where England will aim to claim their maiden Euros trophy ahead of the three-time champions Spain."
