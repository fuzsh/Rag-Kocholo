Born in Newark, New Jersey, she signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released her debut album All Hail the Queen on November 28, 1989, featuring the hit single \"Ladies First\". Nature of a Sista' (1991) was her second and final album with Tommy Boy Records.\n\nLatifah starred as Khadijah James on the FOX sitcom Living Single from 1993 to 1998. Her third album, Black Reign (1993), spawned the single \"U.N.I.T.Y.\", which was influential in bringing awareness to women's rights and towards raising the perspective of women in communities worldwide.

She then starred in the lead role of Set It Off (1996) and released her fourth album, Order in the Court, on June 16, 1998, with Motown Records. Latifah garnered acclaim with her role of Matron \"Mama\" Morton in the musical film Chicago (2002), receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nLatifah released her fifth album The Dana Owens Album in 2004. In 2007 and 2009, she released two more studio albums – Trav'lin' Light and Persona. She created the daytime talk show The Queen Latifah Show, which ran from late 2013 to early 2015 on CBS. She has appeared in a number of films, such as Bringing Down the House (2003), Taxi (2004), Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2005), Beauty Shop (2005), Last Holiday (2006), Hairspray (2007), Joyful Noise (2012), 22 Jump Street (2014) and Girls Trip (2017) and provided voice work in the Ice Age film series.

Latifah's work in music, film and television has earned her a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, two NAACP Image Awards, an Academy Award nomination and sales of over two million records.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nDana Elaine Owens was born in Newark, New Jersey, United States, on March 18, 1970, and lived primarily in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita Lamae (née Bray; d. 2018),[3] a teacher at Irvington High School (Latifah's alma mater), and Lancelot Amos Owens, a police officer.[4][5][6]\n\nEducation[]\n\nOwens attended Essex Catholic Girls' High School in Irvington, but graduated from Irvington High School.[7][8][9] Her parents divorced when Latifah was ten.[9] Latifah was raised in the Baptist faith[10] and attended Catholic school in Newark, New Jersey.[11][12] She found her stage name, Latifah (Script error: No such module \"Lang\". laţīfa), meaning \"delicate\" and \"very kind\" in Arabic, in a book of Arabic names when she was eight.[9] Always tall, the Script error: No such module \"convert\". Latifah was a power forward on her high school basketball team.[13][14] She performed the number \"Home\" from the musical The Wiz in a grammar school play.[15] After high school, Queen Latifah attended classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College.[16]\n\nMusic career[]\n\n1988–1989: Career beginnings[]\n\nShe began beat boxing for the hip-hop group Ladies Fresh and was an original member of the Flavor Unit, which, at that time, was a crew of MCs grouped around producer DJ King Gemini, who made a demo recording of Queen Latifah's rap Princess of the Posse. He gave the recording to Fab 5 Freddy, the host of Yo! MTV Raps. The song got the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who signed Latifah and in 1989 issued her first single, \"Wrath of My Madness\". More recent artists, like Ice Cube and Lil' Kim, would go on to sample Latifah's track in their songs, \"Wrath of Kim's Madness\" and \"You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo\" in later years.[17] Latifah has a two-octave vocal range.[18] She is considered a contralto, having the ability to both rap and sing.[18]\n\n1989–2002: Rap and hip-hop[]\n\nLatifah made her mark in hip-hop by rapping about issues surrounding being a black woman. Her songs covered topics including domestic violence, harassment on the streets, and relationship problems.[19] Freddy helped Latifah sign with Tommy Boy Records, which released Latifah's first album All Hail the Queen in 1989, when she was nineteen.[9] That year, she appeared as Referee on the UK label Music of Life album 1989—The Hustlers Convention (live). She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1992.[20] In 1998, co-produced by Ro Smith, now CEO of Def Ro Inc., she released her fourth hip-hop album Order in the Court, which was released by Motown Records. Latifah was also a member of the hip-hop collective Native Tongues. Her Grammy Award-winning song ‘\"U.N.I.T.Y.” was very influential to women.\n\nLatifah performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show.\n\n2003–2009: Change to traditional singing[]\n\nAfter Order in the Court, Latifah shifted primarily to singing soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip-hop-oriented records. In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards The Dana Owens Album. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. In front of a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, which was billed as the Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including \"California Dreaming\", first made popular by 1960s icons the Mamas & the Papas. Later in 2007, Latifah released an album titled Trav'lin' Light. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances.[21] It was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album\" category.[22]\n\nIn 2009, Latifah, along with the NJPAC Jubilation Choir,[23] recorded the title track on the album Oh, Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration, covering the song that the Edwin Hawkins Singers made popular in 1969.[24]\n\n2008–present: Return to hip-hop[]\n\nIn 2008, Latifah was asked if she would make another hip-hop album. She was quoted stating that the album was done already and it would be called All Hail the Queen II. The following year, in 2009, she released her album Persona. The song \"Cue the Rain\" was released as the album's lead single. She also has a song with Missy Elliott.[25] 2011 saw Queen Latifah sing \"Who Can I Turn To\" in a duet with Tony Bennett for his album \"Duets II\".[26] In January 2012, while appearing on 106 & Park with Dolly Parton, to promote Joyful Noise, Latifah stated that she had been working on a new album.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Queen Latifah among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[27]\n\nFilm and television[]\n\n1991–2001: Early career[]\n\nShe began her film career in supporting roles in the 1991 and 1992 films House Party 2, Juice and Jungle Fever.
