        "text": "The Mayor of Gateshead joined legendary Lioness Jill Scott at the unveiling of a new statue temporarily placed alongside the Angel of the North.\n\nStanding tall at over 4 metres high, the bronze statue of the footballing legend and reigning Queen of the Jungle was unveiled this morning (4 July) to announce Jill as a team captain on the new season of Sky's 'A League Of Their Own'.\n\nMeasuring the height of two Football Association goal posts and weighing in at 500kg, equivalent to three lionesses, the lifelike statue is located in a community close to Jill's heart after starting her footballing journey with Gateshead College Footballing Academy in 2003. She went on to play for Sunderland and retired with over 160 England caps and 27 goals.\n\nReliving the unforgettable moment when she celebrated the Lionesses' 2-1 victory against Germany at Wembley, the statue depicts Jill with her arms outstretched and has been erected on the football pitch adjacent to the Angel of the North. It will remain there until 9 July, when it will begin its journey down south - to take pride of place in opposing team captain Jamie Redknapp's back garden.\n\nLed by the Mayor, a blindfolded Jill made her way to the statue. After seeing it for the first time, Jill met with players from her former team Boldon Girls and Gateshead College then grabbed a pair of goalkeeping gloves to join them on the pitch.\n\n<\n\n>\n\nx\n\nCouncillor Eileen McMaster, Mayor of Gateshead, presented Jill with a brooch featuring the image of the Angel of the North to commemorate the event. She said: \"I'm so pleased to welcome Jill back to Gateshead. She's a fantastic advocate for grassroots and community sports, as well as a wonderful ambassador for the North East. I hope that her achievements inspire the young people here today and across the region to keep pursuing their goals.\n\nI'm delighted that Gateshead was chosen as the location for the announcement of Jill's team captaincy on A League Of Their Own.\""
