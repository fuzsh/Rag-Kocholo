        "text": "Julius Doyle, Charlie Milne, Nick Hall and Isaac Deavin were in Berlin when they bumped into England Lioness heroine Jill Scott MBE and were filmed for a segment on ITV’s morning show.\n\nIsaac and Nick from Falmouth and Julius and Charlie from Penryn had arrived in Berlin as part of interrailing when they bumped into one of England’s most decorated players.\n\nNot only that but an ITV news team was filming at the same time and the four friends ended up being on national TV.\n\nThey told the Packet: “It was cool to see her being so social with the fans, exciting to see someone we watch on TV. We were chatting about England's performance ahead of the final.”\n\nThe boys are all aged 18 with Julius is from Broad Street Penryn, Charlie from West Street Penryn, Isaac is from Swanpool Falmouth and Nick is from Acacia Road, Falmouth.\n\nThey didn’t have tickets for the final and were in Berlin purely by chance as it was part of their interrailing itinerary for the summer before going to college or university.\n\nThey left Falmouth last Saturday night by National Express after the England game. First stop Amsterdam by the Eurostar, and then Berlin where they saw the next England game in a bar.\n\nThey headed to a EuroBar in Berlin for the semi-final match and were looking to head to the Brandenburg Gate FanZone in Berlin to view the final.\n\nThe boys, who all went to Penryn College have been in Berlin since Wednesday and will subsequently travel on to Prague, Marseilles and Barcelona.\n\nBefore the final they told the Packet they were very excited to be able to be in Berlin and predicted a 2-1 victory for England, but unfortunately it was not to be.\n\n“Very excited for the atmosphere,” they said before the final, “loads of British fans are here alongside people from all over the world celebrating the tournament.\"\n\nThey said they were unbelievably excited and were so lucky to be in Berlin with the final on despite the final result.\n\nOne of England's most decorated players, Jill Scott is one of the select few Lionesses to have surpassed 150 caps and after featuring at no fewer than nine major tournaments she finally got a winners' medal as part of the team who won EURO 2022 on home soil.\n\nShe reached the milestone of 150 caps in February 2021 when she led out the Lionesses against Northern Ireland at St. George's Park."
