Most recent are listed first.\n\nPlease follow links for special memorials and notes for founder/execs Ken Olsen, Win Hindle, Gordon Bell, Harlan Anderson, andStan Olsen.\n\n************************** May 17, 2024 ******************************\n\nSad news from the New York Times: On May 17th, Gordon Bell passed away at age 89 from pneumonia at his home in Coronado CA. Gordon was Sr. Engineering VP and master architect into VAX days and at Digital from 1960-1983.\n\nLink to the NY Times obituary article.\n\nC. Gordon Bell, a technology visionary whose computer designs for Digital Equipment Corporation fueled the emergence of the minicomputer industry in the 1960s, died on Friday at his home...\n\nHere are links to eulogies sent to us by 2 of Gordon's mentees in Australia, provided by Craig Mudge and Steve Blank of DEC Australia.\n\n************************** May 14, 2024 ******************************\n\nOur condolences to his wife Reedy and Digital friends at CXO of Jim Porter, who passed away on May 14, 2024 in Colorado Springs.\n\n************************** May 7, 2024 ******************************\n\nThanks to our Colorado Springs friends for letting us know about the passing of Chet (Chester D.) Jacobs, 81, of Stow MA.\n\nHis career with Digital Equipment Corp (DEC), Compaq and HP spanned many years and many miles. His forte was storage technologies and participated in the development of the DLT tape technology. From there he joined the global technical speaker team for DECâs StorageWorks division. Many of you may remember him as a speaker who could make dry material fascinating and keep a large audience laughing. Although he never lived in Colorado Springs, he could often be found here giving presentations, working with engineering teams and learning the next evolution of StorageWorks products. He became a friend to all that knew him.

Marilyn worked for Digital for 20 years and retired after serving as the Event Planner for the Eastern States Sales Organization. In the mid-1990s, Maryland became the Director of Chapter 1776, one of the chapters of the Digital Retiree Association [DRA]. She became a Board member in 1997. She also served three years on the BOD of the Hewlett-Packard Retiree group as a representative from Digital.\n\nMarilyn continued to serve on the DRA Board. In 2006, the DRA was enhanced with a website and a new name, the DECconnection. Marilyn was a major contributor to this effort and active in member outreach and retiree events. She remained on the Board until 2023. If not for Marilynâs 20-year commitment to the Digital Retiree Association, it is unlikely that the DECconnection organization would exist today. Marilyn will be greatly missed by the DECconnection Board and by the many lives she touched in her efforts to bring Digital retirees together.\n\nIn addition to her devotion to all things Digital, Marilyn had many hobbies: gardening, bike riding, Alpine skiing, playing guitar in a Scottish orchestra, singing in the Chapel Choir and Gospel Group at her church. She also enjoyed knitting, sewing, cooking, reading and history. And of course spending time with her 2 sons and extended family.\n\n************************** February 12, 2023 ********************************\n\nI am very sad to report the passing of my friend Richard G.

Gourd, 77, has passed away:\n\nFor the ex-DECies, I heard yesterday that Roger Gourd has died; rsg (aka Fossil) was the probably the best SW engineering manager the industry ever produced. His legacy is amazing. In the mid 1970s, he was Dave Cutler's boss during the \"Vax SW\" project Â­ which would become VMS. He would leave DEC to run the SW division at Gould and come back to Boston to be the head of SW at Masscomp. He was eventually the VP of Engineering at OSF, which I believe was his last rodeo before he retired to Florida to raise orchids. Many of us that were in the business learned a great deal from him and have modeled much of our style and methods from him.\n\nHe died April 21, 2016 in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. He had been sick the past few years, suffering from Parkinsonâs, Alzheimer's and diabetes Â­ which is a nasty combination. As our friend and co-worker Jack Burness put it: \"I'll remember Roger as a vibrant, strong person.\" I suggest he was one of kind. He had a wonderful, albeit sometime a little warped (non-PC), sense of humor. He was demanding but also dedicated to his people and would ensure that \"upper management\" got it. He understood peopled truly treated us all the same. He helped us bring out our best in all we did.\n\nThe last time many of us saw him was 2010 in Boston. Jack had come to Boston that summer and a number of us got together with Roger and wife Sally at their condo in Beacon Hill. At that time, he was still the same Roger we all knew and loved. Many of us will miss him. Sadly, the industry lost a great person.\n\n************************** April 14, 2016 ********************************\n\nMember Alex Tellert sent in sad news of the passing of E.
