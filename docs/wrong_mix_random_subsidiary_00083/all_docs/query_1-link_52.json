        "text": "This article originally appeared on EW.\n\nBlack Lightning just cast another musician in an antagonistic role.\n\nGrammy Award-winning singer Jill Scott is joining the cast of The CW’s forthcoming superhero drama to play DC Comics villain Lady Eve, who will be the bridge between Tobias Whale (played by L.A. rapper Marvin “Krondon” Jones III) and a secret group of corrupt leaders. Always a consummate professional, Scott’s onscreen alter ego presents herself in Freeland as the owner of a funeral parlor, but quickly becomes an adversary to Black Lightning (Cress Williams). (In the comics, Lady Eve is a member of the Kobra Cult.)\n\n“Jill is an amazing artist who can embody any character and give them an authentic voice that is both nuanced and richly complex,” said showrunner and executive producer Salim Akil in a statement. “I am excited to see her in the role of Lady Eve.”\n\nDeveloped by Salim and Mara Brock Akil alongside super-producer Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schecter, Black Lightning follows Jefferson Pierce, a high school principal and retired superhero with electricity powers who suits back up when both his daughters and his community are threatened by Tobias Whale’s 100 Gang.\n\nThis isn’t Scott’s first superhero project: She previously voiced Storm on BET’s short-lived animated series Black Panther in 2010. Her other onscreen credits include Why Did I Get Married, 2012’s Steel Magnolias, and guest turns on Fringe and Being Mary Jane.\n\nBlack Lightning will debut in 2018 on The CW."
