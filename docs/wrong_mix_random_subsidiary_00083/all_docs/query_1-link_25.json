        "text": "Former England and Manchester City midfielder Jill Scott announced her retirement in August after an 18-year career, including 161 England appearances — making her the country’s second-most capped footballer — a European Championship winner’s medal and three FA Cup titles.\n\nHaving been crowned Queen of I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! (although the trophy and crown stayed in Australia), appearing on Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, commentating on England fixtures alongside her idol Steven Gerrard and quizzing England men’s record goalscorer Harry Kane, Scott is briefly back in her Manchester coffee shop, Boxx2Boxx, doing the dishes and making coffee.\n\nHere she tells The Athletic about doing it her way, a love of poetry and Matt Hancock.\n\nWhat is the one question you’d ask yourself?\n\nWhen I was playing football, I used to ask myself a lot, ‘Are you enjoying this?’. That has to be my biggest thing.\n\nWhat is the question you’re always asked?\n\nAbout Matt Hancock in the jungle — every single interview. I haven’t had an interview where I haven’t been asked it, so you could be the first….\n\nWhat’s the question you hate being asked?\n\nI’m willing to answer anything. That’s a really good question in itself. I’ve been asked a lot of stuff around like LGBTQ+ and I don’t mind answering. I just want it to be normal if you’re with a man or a woman. It’s 2023, and you get asked a lot of questions about it.\n\nWhat’s the question you’d ask your parents?\n\nMy parents, oh god. Well, what was I like as a child? I think I was quite annoying, driven and stubborn. So what was it like bringing us up and showing us the way. They would say I just got on with it and did my own thing.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you’d tell your 16-year-old self?\n\nJust to keep going. At 16, it was a difficult age. I had been left out of the England squad and probably didn’t think I was going to get the opportunity to play for my country. So it would be, keep believing in myself. I did do that. There are going to be difficult days but if you work through them, good days are just around the corner.\n\nHow would financial investment in grassroots have changed your life as a young footballer?\n\nIf I had been younger, there would have been a lot more opportunities for myself. As you look back, you probably made opportunities for yourself because it wasn’t there. Now those paths are going to be there for girls and things are just going to be a little bit easier. That makes us smile a lot.\n\nHaving that help from Xero, I know as a small business with Boxx2Boxx coffee shop — and also coming through grassroots football — really helps to manage our finances and run a business.\n\nWe know we need money to get girls playing football. The strength of women’s football is at the bottom of the pyramid. If businesses are run properly, we know we can open up so many more opportunities for women and girls to work in football.\n\nYour retirement letter mentioned when playing for Everton the three-hour car journeys on the M62 from Sunderland to Liverpool with packets of Dairylea Lunchables and Yazoo milkshakes in the back of your Peugeot 106…\n\nI was ill a lot because I was traveling so much and not eating properly. Now you see the level of women’s football going up so much because they have nutritional support, daily training; they’re getting looked after. They’re going to be a lot better than me when I was as a player. You had to go off path when I was younger, but those barriers are being taken away for the next generation. That makes us happy.\n\nWhat will your obituary say?\n\nIs that when you die?\n\n‘She did it her way’. Keep it simple.\n\nWhen you look in the mirror, what do you see?\n\nA lot of lines on my face from smiling and laughing. When I look in the mirror in the morning I think, ‘Can you go out there and make a change to one person’s life every single day?’. It may be coaching a young kid, having a conversation in the coffee shop with an elderly customer that wouldn’t have had a chance to chat that day. That’s what I see — an opportunity to help someone with my day.\n\nWhat is the biggest unknown about your future that you want to know?\n\nI don’t want to know. I’m not a long-term planner. The feeling of the unknown excites us. If you just try and be yourself every single day, then your future will work out whichever way it’s meant to go. I just take each day as it comes because tomorrow is not guaranteed. So hopefully they won’t be reading my obituary any time soon (Scott laughs).\n\nPeople would be surprised that…\n\nI write poems a lot. They all rhyme. Before I went into the jungle I wrote about 20 poems in one day because I was in an isolation period on my own. Sitting at the train station the other day, there was a 15-minute delay so I wrote five poems. I just love getting my thoughts down on paper. I’m quite a creative thinker.\n\nWhere does your sense of humour come from?\n\nMy mum reckons she’s quite funny when she’s at work. There might be a little bit of genetics. I always joke that I’ve had to rely on my personality a lot over the years. I like to have a laugh and make people smile. I’m really quick thinking. Sometimes my partner Shelley Unitt will ask, ‘What are you thinking about?’. I’ve had about 10 thoughts to her one. I do think I’ve got an overactive brain.\n\nFootball is…\n\nMy life. It’s been my life for so long and it’ll continue to be my life.\n\nXero, the small business accounting software, has partnered with Lioness Legend, Jill Scott, to highlight the importance of financial investment and sustainability in women’s grassroots football."
