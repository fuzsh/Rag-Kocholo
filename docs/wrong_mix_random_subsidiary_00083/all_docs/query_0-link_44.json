Louise \"Lou\" Ernst - March 06, 1940 - March 23, 2023\n\nDeparted: 03/23/2023 (Olney)\n\nObituary Preview: E. Louise (Lou) Ernst 83, of rural Sumner passed away on Thursday, March 23, 2023 in Olney, Illinois. Lou was born on March 6, 1940 in Olney, Illinois, the daughter of Charles and Elouise (Overbay) Gibson. After moving from Illinois to New Mexico in 1961 and while living there for 14 years Lou expanded her childhood interest of the southwest and American Indian culture. She met and made lifelong friends of several Indian women living on the Santa Domingo and Isleta pueblos. She met them by loading her 4 wheel drive pickup with no longer needed furniture and outgrown children’s clothes. She would drive out to the pueblo, park her truck in the courtyard and several women would slowly approach. After a while she would be invited into one of the women’s homes. Once inside, the home would slowly fill up with other women who would quietly slip in. The women would converse with each other in their native tongue, laugh and giggle but would switch to English when bartering with her. She would trade her items for their handmade pottery, silver/turquoise jewelry (the women or their husbands had made) and one time traded for a large drum made from a hollowed out cottonwood log. She never brought back anything she had taken to trade. If she couldn’t trade for something, she would give her item/s away to whomever needed them. She made these trips many times down through the years. Lou enjoyed hiking & picnicking with her “coffee group” friends in the Sandia Mountains and the many tram rides to the top of Sandia crest. Upon moving back to Illinois in 1975 Lou was co owner and instrumental in the startup of Lazy 8. She served as secretary and book keeper from 1976 until her retirement in 2014. Lou liked telling about driving an army 6x6 towing a trailer on her 1000 mile move from New Mexico back to Illinois and being trapped in a snow storm in Southern Missouri in the process. She enjoyed taking some of her Indian pottery, jewelry, baskets and the drum when asked by local elementary school teachers to give a talk on her experience with the pueblo Indians. She loved to tell of the look of awe on the children’s faces as they got to file by and beat an actual Indian drum at the end of her presentation. Having successfully raised two boys, she switched gears and got involved in Girl Scouts with her granddaughter and was a troop leader for several years. She ultimately served one term on the board of the Girl Scout’s Southern Illinois council. Lou liked to travel and had been in 46 of the lower 48 states. She traveled by pickup camper while in New Mexico and by motor home while in Illinois. She especially liked to take paddle wheel river boat cruises on America’s rivers. In recent years she organized and attended monthly lunches at different area restaurants with her classmate friends. Having been friends with some of the ladies since before the first grade made it especially enjoyable for all. She was preceded in death by her parents and sister; Amanda Tipton. Lou is survived by her husband Lynn of 65 years; son, Gary (JoAnn) Ernst, rural Claremont; son, Bret (Barb) Ernst, rural Olney; granddaughter, Lindsey (Jordan) Tomlin, rural Noble; granddaughter, Heather (fiance Jennaire Lewars) Ernst, Champaign Illinois; grandson, Eric (fiancee Taylor Booker) Ernst, Olney; great granddaughters; Leah and Jamie Tomlin; sister, Janet (Ken) Gower, Scottsboro Alabama; five nieces, two nephews and four cousins.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nGeorge Elmer Shaw - October 02, 1930 - March 18, 2023\n\nDeparted: 03/18/2023 (Olney)\n\nObituary Preview: George Elmer Shaw, age 92, died Saturday, March 18, 2023 at his Olney home surrounded by his family.

Suzanne was born May 16, 1963 in Olney, the daughter of Sheldon and Doris Burgener. Mark, her brother, came along a few years later. She gave her life to her Savior, Jesus Christ, at an early age and lived the rest of her days to bring Him glory. She fell for the love of her life, Greg, at age 14 and they were together for five and a half years before becoming man and wife on October 8, 1983. They were married for 39 years. Greg and Suzanne had such great chemistry between them and were truly a team, experiencing together life’s challenges and opportunities. They raised three kids Jacob, who married Reiley Ferrell-Stout in 2016 and live in Olney; Brittany, who lives in Montezuma, IA; Christian, who married Melinda Morgan, also in 2016 and are raising two beautiful children, Arlo (2) and Indie (newborn). After high school, Suzanne attended OCC in Olney and then EIU in Charleston, where she graduated with a degree in Elementary Education. She later obtained a Masters Degree in Administration from EIU. She was a natural born teacher, a gift she shared with Greg. She taught at the Olney Christian Fellowship School for a few years before becoming a personal aide to a high school student. She went on to work as a teacher’s aide at Cherry School before beginning 19 years as a 5th grade teacher, first at Claremont School, then at Richland County Elementary School in Olney. The last three and a half years of her career she took on a new challenge of becoming the Art teacher to 800(+) students ages pre-school to 5th grade. She really enjoyed teaching the kids art and was able to impact even more lives. Suzanne loved her students and truly cared about each one, developing them as individuals. Those who were taught by her often shared with her how much of difference she had made in their lives. Suzanne was a strong decisive woman who naturally led others to accomplish more. She was immensely talented and creative, engaging in everything from calligraphy and counter cross-stitch to free-lance and zentangle drawings. She was extremely generous with her time, her talents, and the resources she had been given in life. Her gifts extended to the ability to play instruments and sing. She played French horn and piano in school as well as singing in various groups. Greg and her sang together for weddings and specials at church. They also were in two Christian bands, Pipeline and Oracle. They have been together leading worship at Elm Street for over 30 years (Suzanne on vocals and Greg on percussion). Suzanne served alongside Greg as a member of Elm Street Christian Church in many ways, including Muppet groups, teaching youth, leading children’s choirs, teaching adult Sunday school classes as well as an online Bible study for the last two years. She was always busy with an activity or a project. Suzanne was an incredible wife, and mother who dedicated herself to raising her kids to love the Lord, the fruit being seen in each of her children having given their hearts to Jesus. She was loyal to, and deeply loved, her friends and built lasting relationships with so many people. She could brighten any room she walked into, as a family enjoying many times of laughter and fun. She radiated with the joy of the Lord, and often her family would wake up to her singing a praise song while dancing around the house with a big smile on her face. Suzanne is survived by her husband, Greg Michels, son Jacob Michels and his wife Reiley (Ferrell-Stout) Michels, daughter Brittany Michels, son Chris Michels and his wife Melinda (Morgan) Michels, grandson Arlo Michels, granddaughter Indie Michels, father Sheldon Burgener, mother Doris Burgener, brother Mark Burgener and his wife Charissa (Wimberly) Burgener, sister-in-law Kathy Keimig, sister-in-law Cheri Michels, and several nieces and nephews.

Dick was born August 5, 1934, in Olney, IL to Eugene and Mary (Williams) Hahn. He married Coralee Jane (Dennis) on July 27, 1963, in St. Joseph Catholic Church. Coralee preceded him in death on March 14, 2015. Dick was a loving husband, beloved father, doting grandfather, and committed friend to many. For those lucky enough to make his acquaintance, he would leave an unforgettable mark, and with many, he formed lasting friendships. Throughout his life, Dick always stayed busy: he served in the U.S. Army, owned a Pontiac-Buick dealership, took his children on frequent vacations, frequented the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts with Coralee, and managed multiple rental properties right up to his passing. He was also a dedicated member of St. Joseph Catholic Church. Dick was an avid coin collector, automobile enthusiast, and fisherman. During what little free time he had, Dick would don his fishing clothes and head to Hahn Lake to see if the fish were biting. Although a shrewd businessman, he was generous, donating often to the St. Joseph Catholic School in Olney and to the Krannert Center. Dick was compassionate, always eager to help those around him. Last, but not least, he was faithful. Dick remained committed to Coralee for their 51 years of marriage and never left her side as she battled cancer and until her passing in 2015. When Dick was 14 years old, his father Eugene Hahn, a self-taught engineer, began construction on the property that is now Hahn Lake. Shortly after, Dick left home to attend St. Ambrose University in Davenport, Iowa. After college, Dick served in the U.S. Army as an M.P. Dick returned to Olney after serving and worked as a salesman at Hahn Motor Sales, his father’s Pontiac-Buick dealership. He would later go on to take over ownership of the dealership. Dick married Coralee in 1963 and became a father to Doug, Stephen, and Lori and stepfather to Coralee’s son Ron. In 1988, Dick sold the dealership and used the proceeds to purchase rental properties. When Dick was out at Hahn Lake, he was truly home. He spent many memorable occasions fishing with family and friends and enjoying the inevitable fish fry dinners that followed. His 88 years of life were full of memories. He was proud of his 1906 Buick, which he would drive in the Olney Christmas parades. He would sit hand in hand with Coralee listening to Itzhak Perlman playing the violin at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. By the year 2003, Dick had 6 grandchildren. He eagerly anticipated visits with each of the grandkids and enjoyed every opportunity to fish with them at the Lake. Before his passing, Dick was proud to see all his grandkids attend college. Dick would often express his thankfulness to be surrounded by such loving family and friends. Dick is survived by son, Ronald William Holt of Champaign, IL; son, Douglas Hahn and wife Trang Bui of Los Altos, CA; son, Stephen Hahn and wife Yoko of Aliso Viejo, CA; daughter, Lori Kish of Palatine, IL; grandchildren, Zoe and Jeremy Hahn, Joshua and Grace Hahn, and Sophie and Ryan Kish; brother, Paul Hahn; special friend, Janet Wending of Olney; and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by parents; wife; brothers, John Hahn, David Hahn and Frank Hahn, and sister, Mary Loritz. A visitation for Dick will be held on Friday, November 25, 2022, from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at Kistler-Patterson Funeral Home in Olney. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10:00 AM on Saturday, November 26, 2022, at St. Joseph Catholic Church, with Father Mark Stec officiating. Interment will follow the mass at St. Joseph Cemetery in Olney. Full Military Rites will be performed at the graveside. Memorials can be made to the St. Joseph School Foundation Trust or to the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJames H. \"Jim\" Williams - April 05, 1947 - November 12, 2022\n\nDeparted: 11/12/2022 (Olney)\n\nObituary Preview: James H. \"Jim\" Williams, 75, of Olney, died on Saturday, November 12, 2022 at Richland Nursing & Rehab in Olney.
