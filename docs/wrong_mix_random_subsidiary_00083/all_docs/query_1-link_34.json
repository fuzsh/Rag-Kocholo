After a couple of intense auditions, I was chosen as one of two dancers for the \"Who Is Jill Scott Words & Sounds Vol. 1 23rd Anniversary Tour.\" My role is to add a visual interpretation of the story that the artist is telling through my dance performance,” says Lindsey.\n\nThe Nashville native earned her animal science degree from AAMU in December 2022 and grew up as a competitive dancer with Malone Studios."
