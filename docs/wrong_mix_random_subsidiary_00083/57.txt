Jill Scott’s plans for a 20th-anniversary tour celebrating her debut album “Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds Vol. 1″ (released in 2000) were cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The North Philadelphia native rose to prominence in 2000 with her debut album, and now the neo-soul singer will make her grand return to Philly to celebrate the 20th anniversary three years later on tour in 2023.

Scott will perform in Philly on March 16 and March 18. She will perform her entire debut album from “front to back” at The Met, Philly Voice reported, including hits “Gettin’ In the Way,” “A Long Walk” and “The Way.”

“My band and I were so excited three years ago, but that damn COVID shut us down,” Scott said in a statement. “Now, we outside! Come see me. Come feel again. Relive your favorite moments. Ya’ll ready to settle down and get with this?! It’s a lot of love here.”

The tour begins on Feb. 28 in Augusta, Georgia, and concludes in Los Angeles on June 22.
