AUSTIN, Texas -- âLove yourself a little bit more every day.â

Thatâs the resounding message three-time Grammy winner Jill Scott shared with the packed crowd at the Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater on March 7. The Philly songstressâ stop in Austin was the third leg of her âWho is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol 1â national tour. Moonchild performed as a special guest.

The North American tour is named for Scott's debut album and is a celebration of her 20 years in the music business since its release in 2000. Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1 peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200 chart, "bringing her unique brand of R&B and spoken word to a mainstream audience," according to her artist page on the Grammys website. The debut launched the singles "Gettin' in the Way," "He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)" and "A Long Walk," which landed in the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 that year.

Audience members from all walks of life chanted and screamed as Scott sang about relationships, self-love and female empowerment. Her set list was every song from that first album, sung in order, plus two others at the end âHate on Meâ and âGoldenâ which left the crowd begging for more.

The 21-city tour kicked off in Kansas City, Missouri. The last stop of the North American portion of the tour is June 20, 2020 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.
