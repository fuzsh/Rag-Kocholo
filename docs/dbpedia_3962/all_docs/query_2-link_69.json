        "text": "For the Protestant believer, there was at this point in time a special work of Divine Providence in that corner of the world known back then as Christendom. Here was the finger of God rearranging the social landscape for the Reformation to become a mighty movement in His hands that would soon recover the old time gospel of Christ lost under the shadow of darkness caused by the departure of the Medieval Church from the biblical faith. It was the right time (the 16th century) just at the right place (Western Europe) for the right men (Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, John Knox, among others) to do the right thing â€“ the reformation of the Christian religion by divine appointment."
