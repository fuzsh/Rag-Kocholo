        "text": "We partner broadly. We partner closely with three church associations that we helped to establish. We partner with three seminaries and a few Bible schools. We also partner with several other ministries though not as closely.\n\nWe have established or helped establish additional ministries that are now independent of OMF. This includes Christian bookstores, foundations, a Christian publisher, student ministries, video ministries, and much more.\n\nSeveral leaders of the church in the Philippines regularly mention that they would like to see more OMF missionaries serving here.\n\nMissiologists say that three generations of a people needs to be discipled before the Gospel exerts a broad and deep impact on their culture. Among some peoples, we are already serving the third generation of Christians. Among others, we are serving the first or second generations. It would be wise to serve them for several more years. Our role among them is often a behind-the-scenes one: training, mentoring, coaching, and encouraging.\n\nThe Philippines experiences many natural disasters. We are thankful that local prediction and warning services are improving all the time.\n\nThe nation also experiences many man-made disasters. Since we often have a sense of where they might take place, we can avoid most of them.\n\nThere are several rebel groups in the country. Most of them operate in known geographical areas. We tend to stay out of their territories. We only enter them when local leaders invite us and guarantee our safety.\n\nMany peoples live in the Philippines. Most sources mention that around 180 languages and dialects are spoken here. To effectively serve the least-reached peoples, most OMF workers learn two languages and cultures. So if you find it hard to learn other languages, yes, it could be hard to serve in the Philippines.\n\nOn the other hand, if you find it enriching to learn languages and cultures, then the Philippines could be a good place for you. Having said the above, Filipino is now being spoken in more and more of the country. It is slowly becoming the national language.\n\nA local author titled his book Authentic Though Not Exotic. He agrees that there are more exotic cultures in the world. This is largely because a wide variety of outside cultures have influenced the peoples of the Philippines. As a result, a unique and authentic culture has developed among each people group although they are not exotic like those that have been less touched by the outside world.\n\nThere are many ways to measure the greatness of a nation’s spiritual needs. By some of those measures, there are greater needs in many other countries. By some of those measures, there are still large needs in the Philippines.\n\nFor example, 90 million Filipinos still need to hear the good news of Jesus Christ in a meaningful way. Half of the 42,000 communities still lack a church. Millions of Filipinos are young Christians who need to be discipled.\n\nThe Philippines is a republic with a voter-elected, democratic government. The peace and order situation in most of the country is more than adequate.\n\nWe avoid places where people are rallying against the government or a foreign government. During election periods, we also avoid places where candidates are campaigning.\n\nThe political situation in Asia is dynamic. Countries are moving in a variety of directions. In this shifting context, the Philippines works hard to maintain good relationships with its near and distant neighbors.\n\nWe praise God that the church in the Philippines has grown significantly since the 1970s. However, the growth has been inconsistent. Some peoples are reached. Other peoples still have very few churches and Christians. While we are helping train some of the more reached groups, we are also doing pioneering work among several of the least-reached peoples.\n\nWatch this video by Andy Smith, OMF International Coordinator for Evangelization explaining the need for evangelization in the Philippines.\n\nWe are thankful that many local ministries are seeking to reach the least-reached peoples. Several of them very much want us to continue serving alongside them. Plus, multi-cultural teams can model the universal church among such peoples which is often a powerful witness.\n\nWatch this video by Bishop Chito Ramos, National Minister, ABCCOP, on how OMF Philippines partners with the local church.\n\nThe answer to this questions depends on what you mean by strategic. By some definitions, the answer would be yes. By other definitions, the Philippines would qualify as a strategic field.\n\nFor example, many Philippine peoples are highly religious. They want to engage in discussions about the most important things in life. If you consider it strategic to invest mission resources among spiritually open people, then the Philippines is very strategic.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a missionary to evangelize and disciple a Filipino who takes a job overseas in the near future. Large numbers of Filipino Christians work in places where missionaries cannot go. They are naturally friendly and often make friends with local people. By this measure, it is very strategic to invest mission resources in the Philippines."
