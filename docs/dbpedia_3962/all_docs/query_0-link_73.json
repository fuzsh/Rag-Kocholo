        "text": "I would like to begin with genuine thanks to Tom Maddux for organizing this roundtable, and to the participants for their thoughtful and engaged reviews. Katherine Carté Engel, Nicholas Guyatt, Stephen Tuffnell, and Kariann Yokota are ideal commentators for this work, coming as they are from the various subfields that Christian Imperialism attempts to integrate. It is a real treat to have a virtual conversation about the book with scholars whose work I admire so much.\n\nChristian Imperialism recounts the first several decades of American foreign missionary activity, from the 1790s through the 1840s, with a focus on what this movement reveals about evangelical Americans’ vision for the role of their new country on the world stage. It is part of a growing historiography that rethinks the way that historians have traditionally understood this period in relation to American engagement with the world. The reviewers all do an excellent job of describing the book’s scope and its contributions to the historiographies of American diplomatic history, the history of the Early Republic, and American religious history. It was extremely gratifying to see them each focus on different aspects of the book, but generally agree on the value of thinking about missionaries and their ‘hierarchy of heathenism’ in our discussions of the history of foreign relations in this era. In this response, I will address some of the questions and thoughts for future work that emerge out of these reviews.\n\nWith a book titled “Christian Imperialism,” I am obviously engaged in the project of thinking about American approaches to empire and imperialism, which came up in the reviews of both Guyatt and Tuffnell. There are several imperialisms in action here: the British Empire, which as Tuffnell usefully discusses, was itself in a state of flux and transition at this moment; a nascent American empire, which as Guyatt describes, was largely continental and settler colonial in its form; and this Christian imperialism, which was an imagined model that the missionaries embraced. It understood political empire as a tool of evangelism, and asserted that Christian nations (and they thought both Britain and America fit this definition) ought to have Christian empires. Taking these missionaries seriously as participants in the conversation about America’s place in the world at this time reveals this third category and highlights the ways that continental empire was not the only kind of empire that Americans could imagine at this time, as well as the ways that the British Empire served as a model, not a counter-example, for some Americans in this moment. Much of the book is an exploration of how this imagined imperialism came into conflict with the real political and commercial empires that missionaries encountered through their work around the world.\n\nTuffnell asks a series of excellent questions about the nature of the Anglo-American connections in the Board’s work. “That American missionaries were co-evangelizers and at times co-opted British power Conroy-Krutz establishes beyond doubt,” Tuffnell writes, “but were they co-colonizers?” This is a great question. If by co-colonizers, Tuffnell means equal partners in the work of colonization, then certainly not. Part of what is so interesting about this moment is the impossibility of such a partnership—the United States simply did not have the power to act on a world stage in the same way as Great Britain. American missionaries’ opportunities were shaped by this basic fact. And yet, Americans did see themselves as partners to the British in this work. As Tuffnell suggests, they were junior partners for sure, but partners nonetheless. Americans may have been only a ‘minor distraction’ for the British officials who were engaged in the work of building and solidifying their empire in the regions in which the missionaries worked, but the British loomed large in Americans’ eyes. Part of my argument here is about the ways that American evangelicals understood this work as being partly about claiming equality with Britain. National and religious identities took precedence at different times, but one of the central claims of the foreign mission project in this moment was that the United States, as an independent country, was now able (and indeed, duty-bound) to take part in the global moral and evangelistic work in which their British peers were engaged.\n\nOn this point, Tuffnell’s question of how American missionaries viewed fellow missionaries, including British ones, is interesting. The intra-reform tensions that are so important in Tyrrell’s work are less important in this era, again largely because of the lack of stability for the American presence. Americans were indeed critical of other reformers at times, usually across denominational lines, but this period saw more of an emphasis on a shared identity as fellow Christians who were collectively trying to change both the places where they were active and at times the structures of imperial power that governed them. India, for example, saw the formation of a Missionary Union that was international and multi-denominational in its membership. The Sandwich Islands missionaries, too, corresponded with British missionaries in the region. And of course the Board itself corresponded regularly with the London Missionary Society throughout these years on a range of topics, with real friendships developing among the leaders of the groups (68). But denominational differences did matter. While the Board’s missionaries were generally respectful and appreciative of the expertise of British Baptist missionaries such as William Carey, they separated American Baptists into a distinct missionary body. Real theological differences divided them even as they adopted many similar policies and worked without competition in these years. The Board missionaries’ writings on the Church of England in India are perhaps most to the point here. American missionaries could be quite critical of what they saw, comparing the worship ritual to that of the Catholics (never a good sign from this group) and criticizing what they saw as an over-commitment to the Empire in place of the Church. The Board and its missionaries generally got along much better with the missionaries of the London Society, who shared their theological viewpoint. As the mission movement grew later in the century, conflicts were more common, usually arising over one group’s assertions that another was interfering with its work in a particular location. To avoid these conflicts, American and British missionary organizations became more likely to divide space among themselves, assigning particular locations to particular organizations.\n\nForeign missions are a rich topic for exploring alternate perspectives on the history of America in the world. As Guyatt’s comparison of my work with Christine Heyrman’s wonderful American Apostles suggests, there is a lot to say about these missionaries in this era, and a range of ways to rethink how we might integrate missions into U.S. history more generally.[16] My approach here was to try and recreate what the mission movement writ large looked like to its supporters in the early nineteenth century. In Christian Imperialism, I try to reconstruct their map of the whole world—what places seemed more important than others and why, how incredibly diverse spaces seemed logically connected to each other in the missionary mindset, and where the United States fit into a global order.\n\nAs Yokota points out in her review, this choice does constrain other options. Since my interest was in reconstructing an imagined global order created by American evangelicals, I spent less time here focusing on the native response to the missionaries’ actions. I agree wholeheartedly that a necessary area for further research is to examine the perspectives of those whom the missionaries sought to convert. The very nature of that kind of study, which often requires multi-lingual research among other things, tends to limit the geographic scope of the study.[17] Since I wanted to get at a more comparative focus of the American view of the world, I did not do as much here on the dynamics between missionary and would-be-convert as a scholar with different research questions might have done. In my chapter on mission schools and conversion, though, I do discuss the ways that missionaries and converts talked about the mission’s work at Bombay. Through a close reading of the memoir of Babajee, a Brahmin convert at the Bombay mission, I discuss the ways that missionaries used his story and that of his wife to tell their American readers a particular story about conversion, civilization, and the way that God worked in the world to advance Christianity in places like India. I also, though, suggest that we can read this mediated source against the grain to identify some of the ways that Babajee had his own understanding of what it meant to be a Christian and to work for the mission that differed from the ways that missionaries packaged his tale (91-101). I look forward to future research that does more than I was able to in this project to examine these kinds of dynamics and advance our understanding of what American missions meant for those who were on their receiving end.\n\nGuyatt raises some important questions about the Cherokee case in particular and whether the removal crisis challenged the Board’s thinking about empire around the world in the following years. As he suggests, discussion of the Cherokee in Liberia “might clinch the book’s argument that missionaries learned some tough lessons about empire from President Andrew Jackson.” Yet Guyatt wants to see more sources indicating the “synoptic view” that I argue the Board had for its overseas work, particularly in the case of Liberia. As I discuss throughout the book, we can see this view when the Board provided instructions to new missionaries and regularly encouraged them to peruse the instructions to previous missions, even to very different locations. We can see it in the Monthly Concert of Prayer, which was intended to spiritually unite supporters of the movement around the world as they prayed for each other. We can see it, also, in the publications of the Board, which regularly described the diverse activities of the mission movement side by side, and clearly understood them all to be related. The Board, particularly in these early years when a single corresponding secretary was responsible for all of the missions around the world, understood its global work to be connected.\n\nAccordingly, crises in one location tended to have significance for other places. The crisis over Cherokee removal absolutely marked the beginning of a move towards a very different conception of the role of missions in the world. While individual missionaries well into the later nineteenth (and even twentieth) century would continue to embrace some of the ideas that motivated this first generation of missionaries, the official policy of the Board was quite different and revealed an end to the idea of American missionaries as partners in empire. In my chapter on Liberia, I discuss some of the ways that the beginning of this shift shaped missionary policy in Cape Palmas. The Cherokee and Liberian examples pair very nicely for this question for many reasons, including the fact that the missionaries in each space were partnering with American agents of empire. In the Cherokee case, this was the U.S. government in the years before removal; in the Liberian case, it was the officers of the Maryland Colonization Society. In both situations, the Board initially expected significant overlap in its priorities and those of the relevant government. Of course we know the story of how this fell apart in North America.\n\nGuyatt is right to expect some agonizing over the Board’s decision to shift mission policy toward removal. As I discuss in the book, both missionaries in the field and the Board in Boston experienced internal dissent at the time (143-149). In fact, it was those agonizing discussions that would have made later references to the Cherokee example particularly striking for the Board’s leaders. In Liberia, as tensions emerged between the colony, the missionaries, and the Grebo, both colonists and missionaries referred to the Cherokee example as an analogy. As Guyatt points out in his review, this happens in only a few sources, but there are enough that we need to pay very close attention to them. The invocation of the Cherokee example by the Liberian colonists was striking and inflammatory enough to the missionaries that they reported it back to the Board in Boston in their regular dispatches. Later, the missionaries themselves repeated the comparison as part of a critical commentary on what they saw as the harmful behavior of Liberian colonists towards the Grebo (167-170). The situations in Liberia and Georgia were in fact quite different; it is significant that both missionaries and colonists used the Cherokee as a point of comparison. It is also significant that these arguments helped convince the Board to remove its missionaries from Liberia and to relocate them to Gabon, which was then independent. I find the discussion of the Cherokee example in Liberia to be a useful way of understanding the shifting ways that missionaries approached their work in West Africa, as well as the ways that they would go on to think about their work in Singapore and elsewhere around the world. Scholars are only beginning to uncover the many links between Indian removal and colonization. Between my work, Guyatt’s recent book, and recent and forthcoming work by Brandon Mills, I imagine that we will be having many fruitful conversations about these topics in the years to come.[18]\n\nEngel’s comments focus on the place of this book in the historiography of American religion. Her piece considers the two central questions that emerge from writing a history that is at once religious and international in its focus: what difference does religion make to the history of America in the world, and what difference does the global context make to a history of American religion? I am deeply flattered to hear Engel say that the book “demonstrates with clarity that attention to the ideas and actions of religious communities must play an important part of placing the Early Republic in a global perspective,” as this was one of my major goals with the book. The second question, as she suggests, is tricky, and should remind us of the divisions within American Christianity in the early republic. The differences between the narrative of American religion that emerges from Christian Imperialism is different than the narrative of revolutionary-era Methodist Francis Asbury that she lays out here largely due to denominational, geographic, and political divisions among American Christians in this period, as Engel points out. The Board was built by Anglophilic Presbygationalist Federalists who occupy a particular place in American religious history as the leaders of the “Benevolent Empire” of the Board, the Tract Society, the Bible Society, and other similar groups in this era. Missionaries in the field had different perspectives than the Board did in Boston, as domestic politics and religious concerns animated the Board’s directors more than it did its missionaries (Jeremiah Evarts, for example, wrote extensively to the missionaries in India about the threat of Unitariansim in Boston. I have not seen any evidence that they responded with any commentary on the issue.)\n\nThe questions Engel brings up about the ways that the missionaries’ Anglophilia fit in with their fellows at home goes beyond religious history to a general issue of where these missionaries fit in with our general understanding of the Early Republic and the ample Anglophobia of the second quarter of the century. The book will be read, I hope, alongside the growing transnational historiography of the Early Republic to help answer questions about how the United States emerged as an independent nation on the world stage. The missionaries and their supporters that I discuss in Christian Imperialism do not stand in for the entire country. They had a particular vision for what America might be that was shaped by their religious perspective. But it was a well-articulated vision that spoke not only to the missionaries who actually went out into the field, but also to the significant number of Americans at home who supported their work through financial contributions and prayer.\n\nThis book is about what early republican missionaries saw when they looked out at the world and what this can tell us about their vision for their country. It examines early American thinking about empire and nation, about the place of the United States in the world, and the ways that Americans thought about race, culture, and civilization. The questions raised by Guyatt, Tuffnell, Engel, and Yokota suggest many of the exciting directions for further research that await scholars of diplomatic and religious history. I am looking forward to pursuing some of them in my own future work, and to reading the work of others who take up these themes."
