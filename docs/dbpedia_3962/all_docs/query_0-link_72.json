        "text": "“Blessed are the people who worship Jesus on this earth, being called for Eternal Salvation rather than Eternal Judgement”\n\nHow happy are we, that we love Jesus from all our heart , mind and soul , we have already placed a reservation in heaven.\n\nJesus is also very happy with everyone that more and more people are coming to him , but seems more confused now.\n\nIt is being very tiring, now a days in heaven, all the angels and saints have been put to work by Jesus.\n\nThe heaven has already been divided into thirty three thousand sections and work still in progress to build more.\n\nSt John is showing that the church is indeed the Bride of Christ (Revelation 19:7-9), but we have 33000 churches now\n\n– Show quoted text –\n\nJesus is already being condemned by the satan to have more than 33000 brides wherereas this is very controrary in the bible.\n\nThe Bible the most spiritual book for all the christians has become the most controversial book for all the christians.\n\nOh no ! what is this , fights are taking place in heaven . Is it between Jesus and Satan ? i exclaimed.\n\nNo no , somebody murmured…..this fights are of every day now. Even Jesus does not know what to do now.\n\nHis one of the apostles, St Peter it seems is not been allowed to enter in one of the sections in heaven.\n\noh marvellous ! even his mother is not been allowed to enter in some sections…… oh wat is this\n\nThe holy spirit is confused now…..he has been highly called by some communities high & low.\n\nFeeling very sorry for St .John the baptist , He is sitiing alone with his community away from the apostles & Jesus.\n\nThe whole heaven is filled with chaos, different types of worships going on….Jesus really does not know , where to go ?????????\n\nThe early christians and the saints are being criticized very heavily for their oral traditions & Beliefs.\n\nHad it not been their oral traditions , the bible would not have been there and there would been no conflicts amongst the christians.\n\nThe early christians are complaning to Jesus about the internet, languages, his mother and his qoute to let Peter to be the head of his church .\n\nThey are constantly complaining about Jesus Hyperbole’s in his speech maily the ‘ROCK ‘ has become the major issue.\n\nSatan is seen slowly creeping towards heaven gates, while Peter is busy negotiating with one of the communities in heaven.\n\nOh, he is on a friendly visit to Jesus, asking his permission to give an advise to him for the current scenario in Heaven.\n\nwhy not have elections here in heaven ! satan exclaimed ….which community is the best…it shud be a democratic christian community.\n\nCommunities are excited , to prove themselves right…each one preparing to be true , but disgracing the other.\n\nSatan seems very happy now…..but Jesus is crying bitterly ….his body is continously being divided.\n\nSources say that Jesus has to die again now.Even God is unhappy , his only son is being sent to earth to die again & again.\n\nThe whole heaven is filled with enmity now …..communities are fighting for the body of christ.\n\nHey i cannot believe what i just saw in heaven, contradictory to the first line mentioned in this letter.\n\n“Blessed are the people who worship Jesus on this earth, but are being called for Eternal Judgement rather than Eternal Salvation”\n\nOhhhhhhh it was a very horrible dream , but good it was only a dream….otherwise the number would have increased to 66,000.\n\nWhat are we doing brothers & sisters and why we are doing it ….this is the question asked to each one of us.\n\nThe body of Jesus is being contionously divided and the blood of Jesus is being scattered like a blood of a lamb slaughtered at a butcher’s den.\n\nIs this is what Jesus really wants……Noooo . Be CAREFUL rather , Cos at the day of Eternal Judgement. Jesus might say.\n\n“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works?” Matthew 7:21-22\n\nQuoting from the Bible itself , which has been the major tool for some communities to DIVIDE AND RULE\n\nSalvation thru Faith is a grace of GOD , but is it Faith , the only instrument to have salvation . hmmmm than there should be only one commandment in the Bible. LOVE THE LORD GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART , MIND AND SOUL . But Jesus has given a second commandment also …LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR ALSO AS U LOVE YOUR SELF…. It seems the second commandment is not applicable for some communities.\n\nThe question is ” The devil also believes and has faith in Jesus that thru his sacrifice on the cross , Jesus has redeemed the world , so is devil granted a place in heaven.\n\nThe answer is noooo…..The devil inspite of having faith in Jesus cannot do GOOD WORKS which is essential for our salvation and that is the second commandment of Jesus. Faith and Good works are neccessary for our salvation.\n\nWe live in a modern world and man is filled with constant ideas…but we still live on traditions. It is traditions that we come across historical truths…..the passover festivals were held both in the old testament and new testament.\n\nThe successions of the apostles were needed to build the church, had the succession not needed ,than Mathias would not have been succeeded in Judas place .\n\nLet us come togather to reunite the body of Jesus with a common doctrine, with a common worship and be humble in our behaviour for not everyone is called to interpret his own beliefs but rather share the same belief which is universal.\n\nThe time has come that we shud pray for the lost sheeps in the world who have gone away from us ,bcos it is only the holy spirit to convince these sheeps to come into truth and not humans to convince them. As Jesus said “If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets,\n\nneither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.’” Lk 16:19-31 .\n\nThank you Vivator. You are a true apologist. You managed to say everything I always knew to be true! I had a similar journey as you because in my family, we were cultural Catholics, though God-fearing. I was never taught properly about the riches of grace in our wonderful Roman Catholic Church and drifted into Protestantism because I was so attracted by their emphasis on the personal love of God. That is one thing I really appreciate about the Protestants. Also, I am a verbal learner and I loved the emphasis on the Word of God. It took me a few years to discern their heresies. But again, I have to thank them because they confused me so much so as to make me want to explore the riches of my own Catholic faith 😉 I love the Word more than ever now because 2 days at a Charismatic Catholic Retreat in Mumbai gave me a peace that 10 years of Bible reading and Protestant ‘interpretation’ could not do. In fact, I was confused beyond imagining and may have put many people off Christianity during those years. The reason I’m writing this is to express the answers to common Protestant challenges in a coherent manner (and without getting into an oral quarrel which just leaves bad feelings).\n\nI’ve experienced the ‘less than respectful’ attitude of the Protestants towards the Church, I remember their contemptuous looks whenever the word ‘Catholic’ was mentioned, all of which has played on my mind and pushed me to get to the bottom of the whole Truth which I have done in a very objective way, if I say so myself. I would challenge my priests and family with the same questions and knew all the answers typically given by the Catholic Church but this retreat gave me such integrated Scriptural knowledge and an experience of the Holy Spirit. Protestant preachers are fond of talking about authority (usually to serve their own interests). Well, Martin Luther and Henry VIII evidently didn’t think obedience was so important. The stakes were HUGE but they thought nothing of tearing the Body of Christ into fragments for their own selfish ends. No wonder they are called wolves in sheep’s clothing! Martin Luther’s problem was that he had a troubled relationship with his father, he was superstitious and suffered from a guilt neurosis which is basically unbelief and denial of Christ’s saving work.. HE was the one who refused grace through the sacraments and the doctrine of sanctification along with them. If he had lived in this century he would have been diagnosed with OCD, going to Confession sometimes several times a day!! And the fruit of this schism – he ran off with a nun and had four kids. Every pastor who defects to start a new denomination cannot have much use for ‘obedience to authority’. Who appoints this authority anyway? It is self-appointed!\n\nI’ve experienced both Catholicism and Protestantism and I know without a shadow of a doubt which one is the TRUE CHURCH:\n\nCatholicism WORKS! It is not a ‘Church of works’! If, by works, you mean ongoing sanctification, then, yes. The Protestants have twisted the words ‘grace’, ‘faith’ and ‘works’ altogether, to create a loophole where none exists. The Catholic Church preaches GRACE which gives us the OPPORTUNITY to REPENT. Heaven was opened for us; It was accessible to us, Christ did not win us an unconditional pass to eternal life. ‘Run in such a way that you may obtain the prize’. Repentance must be coupled with BELIEF or FAITH and then, produce fruit. ‘Faith without works is dead’. Catholics do not try to EARN salvation; no one can! Salvation was God’s initiative but there must be an ongoing response to His gracious Initiative. Good works are simply the fruit, a grateful response, as it were, to His grace, not a duty and a burden. God’s Justice cannot sentimentally overlook people’s sin and say ‘Oh now, they’ve accepted My Son so I will dress them up in white robes and make them look pure and holy!’ Christ’s grace is to give us the OPPORTUNITY to grow in sanctification through the sacraments and prayer and the Eucharist. Protestants take salvation for granted; their presumption of salvation as a one-time event is masqueraded as ‘humility’, a deadly and false humility. ‘How can you deny Christ’s saving work?’ they ask, appalled. The Catholic position does not deny Christ’s saving work, She doesn’t want believers to fall into presumption. Would you, as a Judge, have clemency on a person who misused your mercy and grace? Only witness the sad decadence of nations that have embraced this heresy – the permissiveness of the European and American society and political system are proof positive of the consequences of twisting the Gospel. Making God out to be a sentimental fool who is not concerned with our attitudes or behaviour after accepting Christ as Lord and Saviour is no better than Muslims believing the silly notion that God in His Infinite sentimentality, miraculously substituted Jesus with some other person on the Cross!\n\nDO CATHOLICS BELIEVE IN THE WORD OF GOD?\n\nEVERYTHING has a scriptural base in the Catholic Church – if you sincerely want to know the Truth, read ‘Rome Sweet Home’ by Scott and Kimberley Hahn and Francis Beckwith’s ‘Return to Rome’.\n\nDo CATHOLICS WORSHIP MARY AND THE SAINTS?\n\nNO! We do not worship Mary nor the saints. We only worship the Triune God. Mary is to be venerated and revered in her role in God’s plan of salvation. When we say the Rosary, we are repeating SCRIPTURE – i.e the HOLY SPIRIT”S WORDS through ELIZABETH and the ANGEL GABRIEL. This sanctifies us; it gives us a ‘dose’ of grace. Also, the Rosary is a plea asking Mary to pray FOR us, much as you would ask someone in your prayer group or your mother to pray for you. We are praying TO God WITH Mary. Jesus grew in obedience and though God is Sovereign, Jesus can never refuse Mary anything. ‘The prayer of a righteous man availeth much.’ When she asked Him to turn water into wine, she precipitated the public ministry of Jesus, which she knew would lead to the Cross. Such is Mary’s concern for us, such is her selflessness. Whether spiritual or temporal, our petitions and prayers of thanksgiving get an extra special touch when presented to God through her. I’m amazed how much the Protestants go ON and ON about Abraham, David, Jacob, Gideon, Esther, Ruth etc all of whom were very important in God’s long relationship with Israel. How can they, then, IGNORE the role of Jesus’ mother?!?! Mary our spiritual Mother (not divine), was given to us by Jesus Himself and our older brothers and sisters, the saints are Catholics who serve as an example through their life of prayer and penance in cooperation with God’s grace in their sanctification (remember, we have to work at it with fear and trembling). They are God’s gracious means of enabling us in our sanctification. Protestants take the verse about being ’saved by grace and not through works’ as a verse which denies the thunderous cry of the rest of Scripture. The narrow gate we have to walk is the tension between our flesh and our spiritual lives in Christ. It’s something Luther would not handle and the Enemy tempted him to lead the Body of Christ to be torn apart. It continues to be torn apart by quibblers and charlatans everyday. There are 5 new denominations every week! If you have the intellectual and spiritual honesty, i.e, if you want to make an HONEST SEARCH, attend a Catholic Bible Study (done by Word Ministers, clergy or lay people), all your doubts and questions about the Church instituted by Christ Himself will be wiped away. There is never any Protestant bashing at the Catholic Church. There is only patient longing for the Prodigal to come home. I challenge doubtful and stubborn Protestants to undergo Bible study from a Catholic source with respect, suspending prejudice and judgment, just as I did with Protestantism. If the Catholic Church were eager to get numbers, She would admit people without any lengthy initiation like RCIA. But She insists on Her members knowing the whole Truth and the scriptural basis for it. Not so, however, for Protestant megachurches! You can church-hop much like a job which is what it is to most Protestant preachers. There are sincere people among them, of course, but they have, as my friend Vivator says, a confused individualistic interpretation which breeds confused congregations who keep looking for answers and trying to ‘get’ more faith so they can get God to ‘bless’ them or more commonly still, to bless their finances.\n\nRegarding individual Bible Interpretation:\n\nIt is inconceivable that God means for every individual to interpret the Bible for him/herself. That would mean 6 billion plus churches, all living unto themselves. That would be chaos and as you can see, it IS! I mean, the Protestant phenomenon is fertile ground for charlatans and prosperity gospel preachers. The ‘Hmm, what can God do for me today?’ gospel is especially rife in the United States of America. Individualism is the scourge of the 20th and 21st centuries; it is what has bred Humanism which is a BIG enemy of Christianity. Civil ‘rights’ to abort the unborn? Are civil rights above God’s law? The Protestants have created a monster! Honestly, if you take the Bible out of context, you can make the Word say anything you want It to. And you do! Protestant America has made a God in its own image – a Capitalist Republican, with the US as His ‘favourite’, sanctioning any number of righteous wars against hapless nations like Vietnam, fighting Communism by force and guile. THAT is SELF-IDOLATRY; Roman Catholic priests never talk about money at all! It was Pope John Paul II who made endless efforts to bring down Communism in the USSR through prayer and diplomacy. That was just one of this charismatic and holy man’s contributions. I could go and on about him. Idolatry is NOT the innocent representation of our Lord’s face and person. And neither are the Democrats any better; I would venture to say that humanists are the Anti-Christ.\n\nI can’t even begin to address the 10,000 Protestant interpretations of the Book of Revelations and other books of the Bible which mostly star the USA as the world’s defender and hero and Israel as the helpless heroine. I mean, please. Get over yourselves.\n\nRegarding the Sacraments:\n\nThe next disagreement with the Catholic Church is that we have ‘rituals’. They are only rituals for people who are lukewarm or who see them as such. Is Bible reading a ritual? It can be. I have had miraculous physical healings not once but TWICE after Confession (one of the best things about the Church), even though I may have told my friends the same weaknesses and failings a thousand times. The sacraments are abundant channels of God’s grace.! The consecrated priest administers God’s grace. Why have Protestants robbed their church by taking away the sacraments?!? It’s a mistake of the Protestants to think that one has to be intellectual and clever to be redeemed. Even unlettered people who don’t understand the Bible but come in simple faith, can be sanctified through the sacraments. The Separated Brethren have done themselves a great disservice and it saddens us. It is not ’sola scriptura’ nor ’sola fidelis’. And by removing holy pictures and statues, icons etc, you are pretending that we are not human beings, humble creatures with senses! God’s grace is imbibed through our eyes, our ears, our hearts and so on, not just our intellects. One person may be inspired through the sight and fragrance of candles or a work of art like ‘The Pieta’. Or a beautiful painting or stained glass window. ‘All of Creation for the Creator’ is God’s original purpose! Everything can be holy. Idol worship refers to FALSE idols, that is worship of creatures or worship of self. This does not refer to legitimate pictorial representations of the Lord and the Apostles, His mother, the Holy Angels, and the saints. We are not worshipping these statues, they are an aid to our creaturely senses. I may add that Protestant churches are the bleakest, most sterile looking buildings I have ever been in.\n\nThere was this wonderful anthropologist on TV who explained that primitive tribes would adopt an animal as their mascot because they saw in that animal, characteristics that they felt they had and that made them successful. As strong as an ox, or graceful as a horse or sly as a serpent or wise as an owl, etc. That was the beginning of nature worship which is nothing but self-idolatry. That sounds exactly like what the American idea of God is. A Republican, wheeling dealing Capitalist who wants your tithes. Humorously, he said that is the tithing system were in the New Covenant, the hymn books all over the world would have to be changed: ‘One tenth to Jesus I surrender, one tenth to Him I freely give.’\n\nWhy does the Roman Catholic Church make such a ‘big deal’ about Divorce, Euthanasia,Contraception and Abortion?\n\nHave you ever stood up for the unvarnished and unpopular Truth? And what has been your experience afterward? In the world, it has become fashionable and politically correct to bash the Roman Catholic Church. People only throw stones at fruit bearing trees. When unbelievers ridicule or reject Christians because of our zeal, we have no problem in believing that we are being persecuted! That’s exactly what the Catholic Church suffers. Which Protestant megachurch would be so unequivocal about grave issues like abortion and contraception, euthanasia and other Pro Life concerns? Or divorce, for that matter? It would be too afraid of losing members, maybe even the pastor himself. Or herself! Proud people mock at the Roman Catholic Church, but they have a grudging respect for Her all the same because She is more concerned about safeguarding the Truth than pandering to half baked, populist ‘Christians’.\n\nDo Catholics worship the Pope?\n\nThe shocking thing is that people have dared to say that the Pope is the anti-Christ because the Roman Church using that same old misinformed line about Her being a Church of works! How prejudiced and how ignorant! The Pope is a fallible human being but he IS infallible ONLY in the matter of safeguarding faith and guiding morals. He can lose his temper. He is fallible. He can complain in suffering. He is fallible. He goes to Confession to a humble ordinary priest every week. God in His wisdom may decree something which to our human understanding may not seem ‘democratic’ or ‘humanist’. However, when it comes to setting out the CODE of TRUTH and MORALS and FAITH, the Pope is God’s infallible instrument, through the Holy Spirit and the authority vested in him by Christ Himself.\n\nPaedophilia in the Church:\n\nThe Church is made up of human beings. Priests are fallible. That does not mean they are not channels of God’s grace. The point is, the Church is for sinners to be redeemed and a priest can be redeemed if he truly repents of his sin, humbly accepts God’s grace and works on his own sanctification. The priest is consecrated, not like Protestants who marry and divorce numerous times. Talk about immorality! Celibacy can be a struggle but not everything that is a struggle is to be conveniently done away with.\n\nThe Church is not trying to come up with some doctrinal innovation every other day, or a nuanced spiritual principle which gets God to make your life more pleasant, prosperous or exclusive. In other words, it is sincere, and not trying to sugarcoat the TRUTH. The Protestant Prosperity Gospel is a travesty of the Good News. Mostly, those ‘preachers’ come back to what they know best – sowing and reaping, tithing and harvesting – a big raise, or huge growth in business etc. Mike Murdock is one example. Their belief is that Jesus Christ fully endorses capitalism and the American Way. Money is an obsession – because Protestants believe there is no spiritual obligation left on earth, since they believe there is no need to grow in grace, they have figured out what to do with their time on earth – grow RICH, PROSPER! They measure God’s favour by how wealthy and ‘prosperous’ one is. Hence Benny Hinn’s big mansion and private jet, Joyce Meyer’s big mansion, flashy clothes and private jet, Creflo Dollar’s Rolls Royce, (a sign of God’s ‘favour’) and various others. It’s the American Way! Protestant preachers tell you you’re not blessed because you don’t have enough faith and if you ‘sow’ into their ministry, you’ll be ‘blessed’; Can God’s ‘favour’ be measured through worldly prosperity? You got that job because you had God’s ‘favour’? So the other guy who didn’t get it and goes to the same church as you, and more often, didn’t, because he doesn’t? Mary,the Mother of Jesus, was favoured but I doubt she was very rich. ‘For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.’ 2 Timothy 4:3.\n\nIn short, the main difference between Protestant and Catholics is that the first denies the Cross of Christ and the second embraces it to attain fuller union with Him. Suffering is not the enemy. It may be allowed by God BECAUSE you have faith. He wants you to accept His Will, whether it seems pleasant or unpleasant to you. It’s not always ‘name it and claim it’. Resignation to God’s Will is something that sanctifies us.\n\nI have seen the chaos and confusion and contempt and exclusivity of the Separated Brethren and I have seen the enduring devotion and humility of the Roman Catholic Church. YOU SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUIT.\n\nFor the record, I consider myself to be an Evangelical Catholic 🙂\n\nGod bless you."
