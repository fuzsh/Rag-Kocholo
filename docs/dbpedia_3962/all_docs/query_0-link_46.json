        "text": "This article offers a framework for historical analysis of the goals of Protestant missionary projects. ‘Conversion’ in Protestantism is not clearly defined, is liable to be falsified and may (in some missionary views) require preparatory work of various kinds before it can be attempted. For these reasons, Protestant missionaries have adopted a variety of intermediate and proxy goals for their work, goals which it is argued can be organised onto four axes: orthodoxy, zeal, civilisation and morality. Together these form a matrix which missionaries, their would-be converts and their sponsors have tried to negotiate. In different historical contexts, missionaries have chosen different combinations of priorities, and have adapted these in the face of experience. The article suggests how various historical missionary projects can be analysed using this matrix and concludes by suggesting some problems and issues in the history of Protestant missions which such analysis can illuminate.\n\n3 For an example of the phenomenon of the ‘conversion’ of missionaries, eased in this case by Vatican II's avowed openness to learning from ‘what is good and holy’ in non-Christian religions, see Rademaker, Laura, ‘Going Native: Converting Narratives in Tiwi Histories of Twentieth-Century Missions’, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 70 (2019), 98–118CrossRefGoogle Scholar, esp. 113. This is distinct from the wider notion that missionary ventures could be transformative, even ‘conversionary’, for the societies which sent them: see David A. Hollinger, Protestants Abroad: How Missionaries Tried to Change the World but Changed America (Princeton and Woodstock, Oxon., 2017).\n\n5 Norman Etherington, ‘Introduction’ to Missions and Empire, ed. Norman Etherington (Oxford, 2005), 2, 4, reviews literature depicting missionary motivations as tainted by commercial and imperial imperatives, which Etherington sees as of the past; but cf. John Barker, ‘Where the Missionary Frontier Ran ahead of Empire’, ibid., 86–106, esp. the conclusion at p. 105; and Mark Thomas Edwards, Faith and Foreign Affairs in the American Century (Lanham and London, 2019), 19–23, 52–5. The tendency in the social sciences to see missionaries’ motivations predominantly in negative terms is effectively problematised by Priest, Robert J., ‘Missionary Positions: Christian, Modernist, Postmodernist’, Current Anthropology, 42 (2001), 29–68CrossRefGoogle ScholarPubMed.\n\n10 For some compelling recent case studies that illustrate this truism, see Travis Glasson, Mastering Christianity: Missionary Anglicanism and Slavery in the Atlantic World (Oxford, 2012); D. L. Noorlander, Heaven's Wrath: The Protestant Reformation and the Dutch West India Company in the Atlantic World (Ithaca, 2019); James Van Horn Melton, ‘Conversion and Its Discontents on the Southern Colonial Frontier: The Pietist Encounter with Non-Christians in Colonial Georgia’, in Protestant Empires: Globalizing the Reformation, ed. Ulinka Rublack (Cambridge, 2020), 228–53. In the nineteenth century, famously, David Livingstone won only a single African convert.\n\n28 See e.g. Talhamy, Yvette, ‘American Protestant Missionary Activity among the Nusayris (Alawis) in Syria in the Nineteenth Century’, Middle Eastern Studies, 47 (2011), 215–36CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Okkenhaug, I., ‘Christian Missions in the Middle East and the Ottoman Balkans: Education, Reform, and Failed Conversions, 1819–1967’, International Journal of Middle East Studies, 47 (2015), 593–604CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Proctor, J. H., ‘Scottish Medical Missionaries in South Arabia, 1886–1979’, Middle Eastern Studies, 42 (2006), 103–21CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Dorothy Birge Keller and Robert S. Keller, ‘American Board Schools in Turkey’ and Virginia A. Metaxas, ‘Dr. Ruth A. Parmelee and the Changing Role of Near East Missionaries in Early Twentieth-Century Turkey’, in The Role of the American Board, ed. Putney and Burlin, chs. 4–5.\n\n31 See e.g. Philip Wingeier-Rayo, ‘The Impact of the World Missionary Conference on Mexico: The Cincinnati Plan’, in The Reshaping of Mission in Latin America, ed. Miguel Alvarez (Oxford, 2015), 36–46, 731–3, 736–7; Kling, A History of Christian Conversion, 414–15, 420–2; Fernando Santos-Granero, Slavery and Utopia: The Wars and Dreams of an Amazonian World Transformer (Austin, 2018), 21–2, 139–64, 167–9, 173–7; Richard W. Schwarz and Floyd Greenleaf, Light Bearers: A History of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, rev. edn (Nampa, ID, 1995), 276–8, 283–6; G. Alexander Kish, The Origins of the Baptist Movement among the Hungarians (Leiden, 2012); Ackers, Peter, ‘West End Chapel, Back Street Bethel: Labour and Capital in the Wigan Churches of Christ c.1845–1945’, Journal of Ecclesiastical History, 47 (1996), 298–329CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and, for more recent history, Hans Krabbendam, Saving the Overlooked Continent: American Protestant Missions in Western Europe 1940–1975 (Leuven, 2020).\n\n37 This was typical of eighteenth-century projects in both the Dutch and British empires: see for example the Congregationalist missionary to the Native Americans, John Sergeant, who in 1743 concluded, after five years in the field, that there was no alternative but to ‘take such a Method in the Education of our Indian Children, as shall in the most effectual Manner change their whole Habit of thinking and acting; and raise them, as far as possible, into the Condition of a civil industrious and polish'd People … to root out their vicious Habits, and to change their whole Way of Living’: most of the adults were beyond hope. Samuel Hopkins, Historical memoirs, relating to the Housatunnuk Indians (ESTC W14473. Boston, MA, 1753), 97–8. For a similar, more systematic approach in the Dutch empire, see Jurrien van Goor, Jan Kompenie as Schoolmaster: Dutch Education in Ceylon 1690–1795 (Groningen, 1978)."
