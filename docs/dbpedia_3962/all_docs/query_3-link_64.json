        "text": "Planning and Outlining our experience before CCF\n\nIn this specific fieldwork activity, we focused on learning and observing the activities, culture, people and experiences that took place in a sunday service hosted by Christ’s Commission Fellowship or CCF. Although the activity took place for only about an hour and thirty minutes (on June 30, 2019), we were able to generate significant amounts of insights, thoughts and information regarding the culture and traditions revolving around CCF and its community. Before the fieldwork was conducted it was important for the participants to establish a key informant, Ivan Gonzalo who provided us with the venue tours, introduction to the community and its events. Next, the group made sure to generate enough context and background about the community and mass. This included dressing appropriately (long pants, relatively covered tops and closed shoes) and properly interacting with the people throughout the mass. We made use of other data collection methods like interviewing the ushers.\n\nDuring the actual fieldwork, we were able to participate and observe the many families and people who attended the mass. We witnessed homilies by various speakers and families talking about how practicing the teachings from the CCF community has impacted their lives today. For the most part, we participated in their worship service by singing their choir songs and listening to the homilies which provided insight on the primary drivers of these families and the foundation of their beliefs as not just Filipinos but as a Christian-Protestant community.\n\nA Brief Background on the History of Protestantism in the Philippines\n\nAs stated in our fieldwork plan, it was important for the group to learn about the context of CCF or Christ’s Commission Fellowship which was founded on Protestantism. In the Philippines, Protestantism started to develop during the late 19th and early 20th century when the Americans acquired the Philippines from Spain. Under the American rule, the Catholic church was disestablished as the state religion which gave Protestant missionaries more opportunities to enter the Philippines. The Spanish-American War was informed about the anti-Catholicism in the United States and because of this, the Protestant Americans did not consider the Christianized Filipinos to be fully Christian until they became Protestant, and this annexation was supported by most Christian Evangelicals. Some American Christian groups, however, opposed this annexation since it would lead to Catholic, non-white immigration. The decision to annex the Philippines was based on economics, but justified using Christian rhetoric. When American leadership sidelined the Catholic church, many of those from the Filipino clergy continued to oppose the Americans the same way they opposed the Spanish.\n\nIn 1901, a Comity Agreement was established between various Protestant missions which separated the islands into the spheres of Protestant influence. The Comity Agreement divided places of ministry to avoid future conflicts among themselves and their converts. This agreement aimed to organize the Evangelical union, choose a common name for Protestant churches, and delineate the geographical work allotments for each church. After this agreement, missionaries began learning the local language while local missionaries took leadership and established the foundations of a Protestant clergy. There were a number of seminaries that came about facilitating the growth of the local clergy, and Protestants strongly supported the creation of a public school system. In 1963, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP) was formed to represent the voice of the Filipino Protestants. This also became the first religious body in the Philippines to officially condemn the Marcos Regime in 1973.\n\nWhat exactly is CCF?\n\nAccording to their website, CCF, short for Christ’s Commision Fellowship, is a non-denominational church in the Philippines that was founded by Doctor Peter Tan-Chi. It is composed of both men and women who strive to share God’s love and the Gospel, similar to that of the first century Christians. CCF’s main center of worship is located in Ortigas East, Pasig City. The CCF community is a warm and friendly environment filled with people who are excited to share Christ’s love with basically everybody. CCF is a church that continues to develop, with over 60 satellites here in the Philippines and more all over the world.\n\nJust like any other church, CCF also have their own core values and this helps guide them in their journey with God. These core values include: Love God, Love Others, Obey God’s Word, Volunteer, and Engage the Family. It is noticed that the abbreviation of their core values spell out LOVE because they believe that love is what you need to be closer to others and God. The structure and approach of the CCF community revolves around the D12 or the Disciple 12. This is based on Jesus’ model of discipleship and it is used to pursue the vision and mission of God. The D12 strategy is implemented by the 4Es; Engage, Evangelize, Equip, Empower. From the 4Es, Engage means to reach out with God’s love to others like family, friends, colleagues, and others who are not aware of who Jesus is yet. Evangelize means to share the gospel of Jesus Christ who is in the power of the Holy Spirit and to leave the results to God. Equip means to disciple people towards spiritual maturity, resulting in spiritual multiplication. And Empower means to challenge people to spiritually multiply and encourage generation after generation of Christ-committed followers. CCF’s mission aims to honor God and make Christ-committed followers who will extend these core values in hopes of making Christ-committed followers. Their vision is to see significant movement between millions of committed followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, meeting in small groups and transforming lives, families, communities and nations, for the glory of God.\n\nCCF also have these groups called Dgroups or Discipleship groups that aim to grow one’s relationship with God and with one another. A Dgroup is a small group that consists of men, women, couples, children, and the youth, who meet daily or regularly so they could learn how to become committed followers of Christ. There is no particular requirement to join a Dgroup, it is open to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge about God and the Bible. These Dgroups foster communities that help people grow his/her relationship with God and with others, a place where one can find people who support, encourage, and pray for him/her, and a place where one can also learn to care for others. Overtime, they hope to encourage character that helps one grow in Christ-likeness and collaboration where one can serve God with other people.\n\nSunday services in CCF consist of hour long messages that are thought provoking, engaging, and bible based. The sermons, very much like a homily, are preceded by high-energy praise and worship as well as a pre-service prayer time. For those families who bring children, the Children’s Ministry, NXTGen, have fun-learning activities for the kids.\n\nOur First CCF Experience\n\nAfter gaining a bit of context about CCF and what to generally expect about them, our group decided to attend one of CCF’s Sunday services. On June 30, 2019 we attended the afternoon (12:00pm) gospel service of the CCF community situated in Pasig city. Being that most of us were relatively near pasig city, getting to CCF was quite easy by car. We also decided to come about an hour before the actual service to tour around the vicinity.\n\nWhen we all finally arrived at the venue Catrina’s cousin, Ivan was the key informant for the field-work experience. But before we fully immersed ourselves in the service, we had a few questions that needed to be corrected. These were addressed by Ivan, our key informant and point person for the duration of the Sunday service. Firstly, he informed us that it was better to refer to the CCF community and its people as Christian rather than Protestant since being called Protestant may allude to a negative connotation. He mentioned that they did not practice the action of the sign of the cross, a generally common act in both orthodox and catholic practice and it came as a surprise to us. He explained that it was because they believed that Jesus was only God and not necessarily the father and the holy spirit. After answering our questions, Ivan and his family toured us around CCF and explained to us the different facilities that were open to everyone.\n\nWhen we entered the CCF building itself, there were tons of people. The building had four floors in total, the welcome center, the auditorium (which comprised 2 floors) and the sports and recreational center. On the first floor, the welcome center, we were introduced to the many different areas of the floor that catered to the convenience of the church-goers. There was a canteen with reasonable prices with meals and food. There was a kids center like a daycare where parents could leave their children while they attended the service. There was also a café shop called “A Cup of Faith” Ivan mentioned was owned by the Perkins Twins who were a singer and songwriter duo that were popular among the teens or millennials. They have also been serving within the Church and have been active in leading youth groups and seminars in CCF. There was also a bookstore where people could purchase bibles, Christian books and albums to further lengthen their Christian values and resources. For church-goers who did not understand English, CCF provided headsets that were in their primary language so they could be apart of and listen to the testimonies during the service. Irvan emphasized that CCF was very passionate about their outreach works and how they could be of service to other people, especially the less fortunate. Several posters and booths were stationed throughout the area and advocated for the less fortunate. We saw several people setting tithe boxes around the welcome center and auditorium. In these boxes people could donate to the current charity partnered with CCF by assigning a certain amount of money in an envelope and placing it in these tithe boxes. After visiting the welcome center, we visited the auditorium which took up both the second and third floors. It was like a concert hall with somewhat freezing aircon, comfy movie-like chairs, huge multi-LED flat screen TVs, a hefty surround sound system and a sizable center stage. This was where the main worship service was meant to place in. Following the auditorium, we went to the fourth floor which was where their recreational area was. Ivan told us that this was where the employees, pastors, choir members and even church goers went to break a sweat and try various sports activities like basketball.\n\nSoon before the service began, we headed back to the auditorium where the main service was to be held. When we entered the auditorium again, the first thing we noticed was that it was unlike the Eucharistic celebration for Catholics, there are no statues of Mother Mary instead were surrounded by different saints. There was also no tabernacle and no mosaic images that showed the life of Jesus which were two very important symbols in typical catholic mass/services. Although there were no specific statues, they had a cross which served as their religious symbolism. Ivan informed us that Protestant Christians did not believe in saints and mother mary. They perceive them as a part of Jesus’ lives but did not regard them as holy figures and thus, did not pray and worship them. Ivan also mentioned that Protestant Christians did not partake in eating the host or having the sacrament of communion in every worship. They ate crackers and grape juice only on the first Sunday of the month. As we make our way through our comfy seats, there was a huge screen that displayed the bible reading for the day. A camera crew was also present because apparently, as Ivan said, they offered live streaming that was accessible on their youtube page for those who wanted a recap of the worship service.\n\nAt the beginning of the service, there was a thirty minute song and praise wherein the church goers sang their worship songs which was led by their church choir and live band comprised of both old and young members. While we sang along with them, we saw that they were really passionate about it to the point that they raised their hands up as a sign of praise towards Jesus. The songs started off as very vibrant, active, upbeat, loud and energetic that in a way made the goers excited and eager for the service. After a few songs, we noticed that the happy and upbeat songs became slow and soulful. It really gave us and presumingly the audience goosebumps. It was so powerful and it was sung so beautifully. After the musical portion of the worship, the service proceeded into the sermon or the testimony. According to Ivan, every Sunday, there were different speakers who hosted these sermons and on the day we attended, Pastor Peter Tan Chi Jr was the speaker. One of the readings that he discussed was from the bible verse, Philippians 2:3-4, which was also the focus of the days sermon: “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own”. The pastor talked a lot about having certain idols that we selfishly adored or worshiped over God. He mentioned how Idols were not necessarily just an object or statue but it also ideas that could come in the form of money, the dream you are chasing, career or attitude. His wife shared that she has had a past idol of wanting to live in New york. She wanted to show off to her family and friends that she could afford living in New York. To her it was a boost towards her ego but she did not take into consideration that while she would thrive in New York, her family was still in the Philippines and needed her support. In reflecting on these thoughts and beliefs, she knew that she had to adjust and adapt to live in the Philippines to continue supporting and being there for them. In light of this situation, the pastor reminded us to be more considerate of what others and not just of your selfish needs. We live in a society where one person has an important role for the other. Especially in the context of Filipino culture, kinship and family is one of the greatest bonds we have as human beings. It sets our foundation as individuals in society. That is why we must continue to love and help one another as we love ourselves because we are all somehow connected to each other. And this comes in learning to embrace and accept each other through the power of God’s love.\n\nAfter the sermon, we headed towards the Welcome center to ask the ushers about certain practices that differentiated their religion from Catholicism. The ushers explained that they were considered a non-denominational church wherein they valued their relationship with God. The cross is presented without Jesus because they believed that He is risen and alive and not dead. Jesus is God but he his not the father and the holy spirit. The ushers also said that the pastors were allowed to get married and have a family of their own. Some of these ushers have been a part of the community for so long and have seen many families join the community. Ivan even introduced us to some families who were also newcomers and some apart of the community for generations. Our experience which was coming to a close was incredibly fulfilling and somewhat wholesome.\n\nOverall, CCF caters not just to people in their Christian religion but also towards non-Christian members. We also found out that they were handicap and foreign friendly as they have reserved places for the handicaps and provide interpretative headphones for their convenience. It is a pleasant field work and CCF was able to enlighten our minds and we were able to experience something new as Catholics.\n\nThe Aftermath – Our Thoughts and Takeaways From the Experience\n\nAttending the CCF was definitely a quite wholesome experience for all of us. The physical feeling of being able to sing along with the entire community and feeling the vibrations of the voices resonating within the crowd really gives you a different perspective of how important union and communal practices are within the CCF. There is a sort of familiarity and larger than life aspect that becomes integrated in the study when there is a participation element included. Additionally, sitting in and listening to the speakers talk about their lives and the impact CCF has had in their lives really puts your life into perspective against others. It was interesting to talk to the families Ivan introduced us to and to people that attended the mass because many of them have been going for years while others have only started going and have come to like it. But what was really interesting was how friendly and welcoming everybody was. The families and ushers we talked to were very interested in hearing about our story too and why we were there. They were very fond of what we had to say even though we had just met. Everyone we talked to and observed was very respectful of one another and to be quite honest even curious. Moreover, despite the massive amounts of people that came, the ushers were able to accommodate them all, even the children as they had designated spaces for them too. And despite the huge venue, the setting was still quite intimate and everybody somewhat new each other to some extent. But while it was quite a new experience for us, the CCF had many newcomers coming in each Sunday so seeing and meeting us was nothing really new to their community. It was just another reason for them to continue welcoming people into the community and encouraging the spread of God’s love. And while it can be overwhelming being apart of such a large community, talking to these families and really getting to know these people can make it seem less daunting.\n\nSpending the afternoon in CCF was a good avenue for us to conduct our socsci project and at the same time, get food for our souls by grasping the message of the sermon and being holistically involved with the Protestant Christian community. Throughout the service, we felt a sense of satisfaction where we were able to integrate ourselves so easily and this was because there were so many similarities between Catholicism and Protestantism. Protestant Christians are not so different compared to our Catholic faith. These religions still focus on the main dogma of loving one another as you love yourself. During the service, the talk was relatable to our socsci class since it talks about how we should be people persons and we should not think only about our selfish desires. In relation to socsci, it discusses the fact that we should take into account the feelings, thinking and communicative style of other people so that there will be a mutual understanding and relationship being formed. Overall, CCF envisions a community that advocates loving God and loving others. It allows Christians and Catholics to share the good news of God and practice the value of compassion.\n\nRevisiting CCF and Looking Further\n\nDespite living in the same country, city, or neighborhood, there are times that we Filipinos have different beliefs, but that speaks in the diversity of our society especially with our religions. Amidst this, we have to remember; despite our differences in our beliefs, ideologies, and cultural practices (i.e. religion), we still share various similarities and a Filipino culture that we all should cherish. It is due to our society’s collective actions which result in how our world is shaped. For example, Catholicism influences its followers regarding the belief of various symbols such as Saints, while Protestantism doesn’t deem religious symbols such as Saints as a symbol of worship. In understanding this, the CCF as a whole is a solid community, which tries its best to invite, not impose, their ideologies and religion.\n\nAs a society and filipino community there are still many values we share and still consider with importance. In this experience that was shown in familial and communal acts most especially in a religious setting.\n\nAnswering our Guide Questions:\n\nWhat insights were gained from participation compared to just observing?\n\nCompared to simply observing these activities and experiences, actually being apart of the crowd, singing along and listening to the many speakers of the mass was a totally different feeling and experience. Merely observing from afar and creating inferences from them does not fully capture the essence of this community. By being apart of the experience we were able to generate more personal observation and sincere viewpoint. It is vital especially for activities like this that heavy integration is involved into the activity to truly experience, talking and being apart of the community. It is a way to really understand them and what they continue to believe in. As primarily Catholics, we were able to find more similarities than differences between our beliefs and practices in the community. We gained more intimate insights and personal views on the topic because we were able to talk to these families and ushers and integrate ourselves in the mass.\n\n2. What did having a key informant add to your understanding?\n\nHaving a key informant is essential in doing ethnographic research. They represent that certain community, perspective and can explain the context to the researcher. It enables us, researchers to further understand and grasp where they are coming from and we get to learn their perspective on these matters. Together with his family, we were able to immerse ourselves into the practice of being Christian or Protestant.\n\n3.What was learned from participant observation at this event that a questionnaire or interview about it might miss?\n\nParticipant observation has an advantage over questionnaires as it offers the [researcher] the opportunity to immerse themselves into the situation/event firsthand. In our group’s context, we were able to experience what Protestants experienced firsthand, and it was easier for us to observe their activities, their clothes, their environment, and the differences between their religion to our group’s, where all of us are Roman Catholic. Also, participant observation can reduce biases, as it [goes] past what an interviewee may be able to describe in words, and allows the interviewer to be the participant and immerse themselves into the environment they are inquiring about, thus giving them a better opportunity to understand the practices\n\n4.For what purposes might a questionnaire or interview be better than participant observation?\n\nIn questionnaires and interviews, one may be able to ask more personal questions to the interviewees. For example, one may be able to ask about the person’s full view on their worship, such as the advantages and disadvantages, that one may not be able to immediately realize given he/she experiences it firsthand. Other questions may relate to their personal experiences regarding their religion, their personal mission, and others. It creates a deeper connection between the interviewer, interviewee, and the topic at hand.\n\n5.What insights did you gain about Philippine society and culture from the event that you observed and participated in?\n\nWe observed that the worship exhibited natural Filipino traits, such as hospitality. Structurally, this can be seen as the CCF complex offers various amenities such as a playground/daycare for kids, and a canteen and a café for food and beverages. In addition to that, they’re very welcoming to even non-members of their community, as they allow outsiders to attend their worship, and at the same time, treat them as if he/she was a member. The CCF also surrounds a lot of its time in worship into inviting all to sing various Christian songs, which is one of the community’s main attractions. Our group observed that Philippine culture is very diverse yet accepting. The faith-driven community accomplishes various missions for the betterment of everyone, Protestant or not, such as the facilitation of various outreach programs and allowing non-English speaking members to attend the mass by providing headphones so that they’re able to listen to the pastor’s testimonies. Despite prioritizing support for others, they still give significance to enjoyment, as they also offer various facilities for sports such as the basketball court and the gym.\n\nReferences\n\nChrist’s Commision Fellowship.
