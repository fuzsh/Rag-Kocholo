        "text": "Early Protestant Reformation Period Early Modern Ages Dates 1517-1547 AD Chronology Preceded by\n\nEarly Age of Discovery Followed by\n\nEarly Scientific Revolution\n\n“ A revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past. ”\n\n–Fidel Castro\n\nThe Early Protestant Reformation lasted from about 1517 AD until 1547 AD. It began with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517. It then ended with the reign of Henry VIII, whose disagreement with the Pope on the question of an annulment, led almost by accident to the English Reformation.\n\nThe demand for renewal within the Catholic Church and to rediscover a simpler, more authentic version of the Christian life, was something in the air at the beginning of the 16th-century, spurred by earlier reformers such as John Wycliffe and Jan Hus. All it was waiting for was the man and occasion that would make them into a religious revolution. Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk, deeply read in theology, and somewhat tormented in spirit. He came to reject several teachings and practices of the Church; in particular the sale of Indulgences, and arguing for the holy text to be translated into every language to bring the Gospel truth closer to ordinary people. Luther's refusal to renounce all of his writings, resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor. Yet, through the revolutionary potential of the printing press, Luther's ideas spread throughout Europe within two months, sparking an unparalleled conflagration that shook Christendom for more than a century, with far-reaching religious, political, economic, and social consequences. The Protestant Reformation diversified almost immediately, and other reformers arose independently of Luther such as Zwingli and Calvin. Yet none of these provoked the first major rejection of Papal authority by a nation-state. In England a unique religious change arose almost by accident. Henry VIII, the second king of the Tudor line, became entangled with the papacy over his wish to annul the first of his six marriages to get an heir. This led to one of the most remarkable assertions of secular authority in the whole 16th-century; one fraught with significance for England’s future. With the support of his obedient parliament, Henry VIII proclaimed himself Head of the Protestant Church in England. The Catholic Church was slow to respond to the Reformation, and the internal problems that had triggered it. But reinforced by the Counter-Reformation, the Papacy was soon well-placed to confront the challenge, providing standards to which Catholic rulers would rally. The whole of Europe became embroiled in the growing religious fissure, bringing with it more than one hundred years of religious war. What we might term Round 1 of these wars, from 1529 to 1555, involved Zwinglians, Lutherans, and Catholics in Switzerland and Germany; Round 2, from 1560 to 1609, involved Catholics and Calvinists in France and the Dutch Netherlands; and round 3, the Thirty Years' War from 1618 to 1648, involved nearly all of Europe. All of these wars involved political and dynastic issues as well as religious ones, creating a combustible cocktail.\n\nPerhaps these were good years only for the Ottoman Turks. Venice watched her empire in the eastern Mediterranean crumble away. Charles V Habsburg, perhaps the most powerful rulers in Europe since Charlemagne, abdicated in frustration at the end of his reign; much of his inheritance in Hungary had been lost to the Turks, who at one point besieged Vienna itself; his rivalry with Francis I of France had resulted in little more than the illusion of dominating Italy; and the Reformation had ended forever the religious and political unity of the Holy Roman Empire. In his last years, Charles V was crippled by debt, despite a seemingly endless flow of treasure from the Americas, after the discovery and destruction of the Inca and Aztec civilisations. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Turkish war machine rolled on. At its peak under Süleyman the Magnificent, the empire encompassed the Balkans, Anatolia, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Arabia, Egypt, and north Africa. A new balance of power also emerged in the Mediterranean, with the Ottomans and Spain each dominating their respective halves, gradually reducing the Italian naval powers to irrelevant. Süleyman was a reformer as well as a conqueror, who turned his vast empire into a just and well-administered domain. At the time of his death in 1566, the Ottoman Empire was one of the foremost powers in the world, but tough times lay ahead.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRoots of the Reformation[]\n\nOn All Hallows’ Day 1517, in the university town of Wittenberg on the Elbe, a prominent local monk nailed a multi-point challenge to Rome onto the doors of the cathedral. His name was Martin Luther and his 95 Theses sparked the Protestant Reformation (1517-1645), a great crisis that shook western Christendom and destroyed forever the old medieval unity of the Roman Catholic Church. Given that the reform movement, of which Luther was a part, had political, social, and cultural ramifications far beyond what would today be understood as the “religion”, it has joined the Renaissance and Age of Discovery as marking the beginning of the modern world. In the half-light of a dawning modernity, the Church was a powerful political, intellectual, and economic institution, as well as a lived religious experience of rituals, practices, and beliefs. The local priest was there for every pivotal moment of all a man's lives; baptizing them, marrying them, hearing their confessions, and providing last rites. Before there were clocks, only the bell of the parish church supplemented the sun as a record of passing time. Most people found the church's practices meaningful and accepted clerical behaviour, but there was nothing new about demands for ecclesiastical reform. They complained about bishops who lolled back upon the cushion of privilege to gratify their appetites and neglect their flocks; that abbot were financially and morally corrupt, guilty of simony (buying and selling church offices) and pluralism (holding several offices at once), and maintaining secret mistresses; that priests were barely able to read in any language, and went through the motions of mass in Latin without understanding what the words meant. The wish to rediscover a simpler and more authentic version of the Christian life was characteristic of many new movements. The Albigensian Crusade of the early 13th-century did not prevent the appearance of new heresies again and again in the next three centuries, because they expressed real needs; the quiet devotional Brethren of the Common Life, followers of the Dutch mystic Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471), to name but one. Heretics, in a sense, were living proof of dissatisfaction. In the century between the Great Papal Schism and the Reformation, there were some dismal popes who resisted refrom; the Renaissance Papacy (1414-1517). Unlike their European peers, popes were not hereditary monarchs, so could only promote their own families through nepotism; the word \"nepotism\" originally referred specifically to popes elevating their nephews to the College of Cardinals. The College became dominated by cardinal-nephews, crown-cardinals (relatives of European monarchs) and members of well-heeled Italian families (there were two pope each from the houses of Medici and Borgia). The wealthy popes and cardinals increasingly patronized Renaissance art and architecture, rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, commissioning the Sistine Chapel, and summoning artists from all over Italy. Meanwhile, the Papal States began to resemble a nation-state, with the papacy more often engaged in war and diplomacy than theological matters: Pope Paul II (d. 1471) had a virtual mania for jewels and collectibles; Pope Alexander VI (d. 1503), born Rodrigo Borgia, fathered at least seven illegitimate children, three while serving as pope; Pope Julius II (d. 1513) became known as the \"Warrior Pope\" for his enthusiastic involvement in the Italian Wars; and Pope Leo X (d. 1521) supposedly quipped upon his accession, “God has given us the papacy, now let us enjoy it”. With expensive wars and ambitious building projects, popes turned to new sources of revenue from the sale of offices to indulgences (a remission for guilty sinners of time spent in the cleansing fires of Purgatory before entering Heaven). As a concept, indulgences had been part of Christianity from very early on, granted for specific good works such as going on pilgrimage. Then in the 12th-century, they became commercialized to fund expensive projects such as Crusades or cathedrals. By the 15th-century, indulgences were increasingly popular, but abuses had become a serious problem; the point had arisen as early as the days of Pope Boniface IX (d. 1404). Such is the great paradox of the Church in the early-16th-century. It had risen to a pinnacle of power and grandeur, but the point of this huge concentration of wealth was to preach a faith at whose heart lay the glorification of poverty and humility, and the superiority of things not of this world.\n\nMovements had been made towards a Reformation prior to Martin Luther. Two outstanding men, John Wycliffe in England and Jan Hus in Bohemia (now Czechia and Slovakia), added theological issues to these critiques of Church structure, practice, and worldliness. John Wycliffe (d. 1384) introduced so many themes of the coming Reformation that he is usually identified as the main precursor of this greatest of all Christian upheavals. As a priest and professor at Oxford University, his writings took a controversial line on a great many issues: condemning the wealth and privileged status of the high clergy; questioning the pomp of their ceremonies; arguing that the Church had a defined sphere of activity, which did not extend to meddling in secular affairs; challenging indulgences and chuch sanctuary; condemning monasticism altogether as irredeemably corrupt; denying the doctrine of transubstantiation (that the bread and wine are literally changed into the body and blood of Christ during the Eucharist); and, perhaps most provocative of all, finding no Scriptural or historical basis for the papacy itself (\"Christ is the only mediator between God and ourselves\"). Central to his ideas was that all a Christian needed was the example of the Bible, which everyone should be able to read in their own language. In keeping with this, Wycliffe became involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English; a version now known as Wycliffe's Bible (1384), although his actual contribution is disputed. As the printing press had not yet been invented, very few copies ever existed. Moreover, it had been indirectly translated from Latin rather than the original Greek and Hebrew, so later biblical translators largely ignored Wycliffe's version. In 1377, Pope Gregory XI condemned Wycliffe and ordered his arrest, but he had a powerful supporter in John of Gaunt (d. 1399), the king's third son. He was briefly put under house-arrest, but then Pope Gregory died, plunging the papacy into the Great Papal Schism, and Europe's two rival popes had more pressing matters than an English heretic. After his death, Wycliffe's followers, derogatorily called Lollards (a Dutch word for \"mutterer\") by their Catholic contemporaries, grew more strident in their views. The Twelve Conclusions, drawn up by Lollards in 1395, went even further than Wycliffe in a more scornful tone; finding fault in saint relics, holy images, pilgrimages, confession, and clerical celibacy. They were driven underground by English Catholic authorities, but remained a persistent irritant until the English Reformation made their views the norm.\n\nWycliffe was a thinker rather than a man of action. A generation later, Jan Hus (d. 1415) became the leader of a movement that involved political as well as ecclesiastical issues. Ever since the native Slavic dynasty of Ottokar II Přemyslid petered-out in 1306, Bohemia (now Czechia and Slovakia) had been ruled by the German House of Luxembourg. While the ethnic link between crown and subjects had been severed, Bohemia enjoyed something of a golden age in the 14th-century. Charles IV Luxembourg (d. 1378) was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1346, and made Prague his imperial capital. Under his enlightened rule, Prague became one of Europe's most splendid cities, with Charles Bridge, St. Vitus Cathedral, and Prague University (the first university in Central Europe) built under his patronage. Alas, Charles' son, Wenceslas IV Luxembourg (d. 1419), proved unworthy of his inheritance. During a long reign, he was twice imprisoned for lengthy spells by rebellious Bohemian nobles, and eventually deposed in both Germany and Bohemia; Wenceslas' brother, Sigismund (d. 1437), succeeded him, who was already king of Hungary. Into this volatile atmosphere emerged Jan Hus, principle preacher at the influential Bethlehem Chapel and professor at Prague University. For ten heady years, Hus preached and agitated along largely Wycliffite lines in his own native Czech rather than Latin, comprehensible to ordinary men and women. He was first and foremost an ecclesiastical reformer, but this was also about the still-unresolved tension between Slavs and Germans for control along the Elbe. Hus made Prague so unfriendly to thousands of German teachers and students that they left en masse, relegating the city’s famous university to obscurity. With the Great Papal Schism moving to a close, Hus' criticisms of the Church put him in obvious personal danger. As a prominent voice for ecclesiastical reform, he was naturally invited to the ecumenical council of Constance (1414) to defend his views; the same council that restored unity to the papacy. Emperor Sigismund reassured him by promises of safe-conduct, but Hus perhaps knew what his fate would be, making his will before setting out. Within weeks of his arrival at Constance, Jan Hus was condemned as a heretic and burned at the stake, apparently with the emperor's tacit approval. Hus' outraged followers erupted at the news, led the remarkable Jan Trocznowski (d. 1424), better known as Jan Žižka (\"one-eyed\" Jan), a successful general who had fought at the Battle of Grunwald (July 1410), and probably at Agincourt (October 1415) as an English mercenary. In 1419, the Hussites headed by Žižka marched through the streets of Prague to the Town Hall, and tossed several members of king's council from the windows to their deaths; sparking the Hussite Revolt (1419-1434) as well as introducing the word \"defenestration\" into European political lexicon. Skilled metal-workers, Hussite citizen armies were some of the earliest adopters of field artillery (mobile cannon-wagons) and arquebuse (the first reasonably portable firearms), at a time when both horses and men were naturally gun-shy. They also developed the military tactic we might call circling-the-wagons, creating temporary fortification made of armoured wagons arranged in a circle. The Hussites defeated four separate imperial-papal armies, and repeatedly ravaged central and northern Germany, even reaching the Baltic coast, where, it is said, they filled their drinking-flasks with sea-water to show that the Slavs, not the Germans, now owned the Baltic Sea. Eventually, the Hussites split into moderate and radical factions, and began fighting among themselves. In 1434, they submitted to the authority of the Bohemian king and Catholic Church. The peace agreement was a fudge: moderate Hussites were allowed to worship in their own idiosyncratic way; their seizure of church lands was authorized; and Bohemia was granted an effectively national church under a locally-elected archbishop. Despite this apparent victory, the Hussite Revolt left Bohemia devastated, impoverished, and under German dominance once again; this time by the Austrian Habsburgs.\n\nThere had also appeared in the 15th-century another current in religious life, perhaps more profoundly subversive than Wycliffe or Hus, because, it contained forces which might cut at the roots of the traditional religious outlook itself. This was the learned, Humanist, rational, intellectual movement which, for want of a better word, we call Religious Humanism. It is associated above all with the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus (d. 1536), a sometime monk and later the foremost scholar of his time in all of Europe. Erasmus spent most of his life travelling Europe, finding employment as he could, and bringing him into contact with other like-minded men such as Thomas More of England and Lefèvre d’Etaples of France. The interest which united them can be described as using humanist learning, not as an alternative to Christianity, but as a means to deepen Christian spiritual life. Erasmus was profoundly loyal to his faith, and that meant, unquestionably, that he did not challenge the authority of the papacy or Catholic Church. But in a subtler way he challenged that authority in principle, for his scholarly and popular work had implications which were deeply subversive. Erasmus learned Greek so as to carefully edit the New Testament in its original form, stating in his preface that he wanted the holy text translated into every language to bring the Gospel truth closer to ordinary men and women. By correcting and analysing Scripture, he hoped to renew theology, but, unwittingly, became a great exposer of the spurious texts upon which bizarre Church dogma had been raised. Of that Church, he had a detached and even satirical view of the foibles of contemporary ecclesiastical reality, which envisioned reform from within. This reform would be based on what Erasmus called the “philosophy of Christ”, which emphasized inner spirituality and personal morality rather than doctrinal observances and outward displays of piety such as pilgrimages to religious relics; he once quipped that it was unfortunate there were only twelve apostles, because fourteen of them were buried in Germany. Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of thought and of politics, including Charles V Habsburg and Henry VIII of England. Though him, they learned to disentangle their own logic and faith from the mummified traditions of the Church, laying the intellectual foundations for the coming Reformation; when monks accused him of “laying the egg that Luther hatched”, Erasmus replied that he had expected “quite another kind of bird”. But events overtook this well-meaning man. In later life, Erasmus was side-lined for refusing to come-down firmly on Luther and the growing Reformation, instead emphasizing a middle way; his collegue and friend, Thomas More, died a martyr because he could not in good conscience accept the political cynicism of the English Reformation.\n\nDiscontent with the church practice and clerical behaviour was something in the air at the beginning of the 16th-century, waiting for the man and the occasion which would make them into a religious revolution. No other term is adequate to describe what followed the unwitting act of a German monk named Martin Luther.\n\nProtestant Reformation[]\n\nMartin Luther (d. 1546) was the son of a copper mine owner in Saxony, who enrolled at the University of Erfurt, intending to become a lawyer. In 1505, he was caught in a thunderstorm, and vowed to become a monk if his life was spared. Much to his father’s dismay, he took this vow seriously, joined an Augustinian monastery, and switched his studies from law to theology. In 1508, he accepted a position as professor at the the newly founded University of Wittenberg, where he spent the rest of his life except for brief absences. In 1510, he had an opportunity to visit Rome, and came away disillusioned and discouraged by the corruption, immorality, and lack of spirituality at the very heart of Christendom. Luther was somewhat tormented in spirit, obsessed by doubts about his own sinfulness and fears of damnation, This led him to fast frequently, wear a hair-shirt, and pour through the Scriptures, verse by verse, giving commentary. In working through the letters of Paul, he found the basis of an essential understanding of Christianity different from the one he had been taught. Luther’s thinking is based on two principles. The first, sola scriptura (\"Scripture alone\"), asserts that God’s word is revealed only in Bible, not in the traditions of the Church. It was a fundamentalist demand to cleanse Church teaching, creed, and practice of everything that could not be based solely on the Scriptures. This was nothing new; Wycliffe, Hus, and even St. Augustine (d. 430) could be quoted in favour of it. The second pillar of Luther, sola fide (\"faith alone\"), was genuinely radical. For Christians, salvation and redemption is a free gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith, not good works on the part of the individual. No one can \"buy\" Heaven through enough good deeds, observance of the sacraments, or endless pilgrimages. This contrasted with Catholic teaching that both faith and good works are necessary for salvation. At the same time that Luther was experiencing his inspiration, materialism within the Church was offensively evident in Germany. Foremost among the German high nobility was Bishop Albrecht of Mainz (d. 1545), one of the seven prince-electors. Albrecht held the archbishopric of Magdeburg in addition to Mainz. Such pluralism was against Canon Law, but Pope Leo X had agreed to overlook the irregularity in return for a large donation to the building costs of the new St. Peter’s Basilica. Both pope and archbishop were men of the world; the pope was a Medici. Leo made it possible for Albrecht to recover his costs by granting him permission to sell of Indulgences. Such a secret agreement might shock the faithful, but more immediately distressing to some was the behaviour of Johann Tetzel, a Dominican frair employed by Albrecht to run the indulgence sale. By all accounts, Tetzel was a showman, and went far beyond official Catholic doctrine on indulgences. He even had a catchy jingle, \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from Purgatory springs\". In October 1517, gullible parishioners returned to Wittenberg with Tetzel's extra-potent sin-clearing certificates, and news of this travesty reached the ears of Luther. Nothing could be further from his concept of salvation by faith than the impudent selling of God's grace. Luther had often preached against indulgences in his sermons, but now he took a more public stand. As both a lawyer and theologian, he formulated his famous Ninety-Five Theses with great care, and enclosed a copy in a letter to Archbishop Albrecht, who passed them to Rome accusing Luther of heresy. According to some accounts, he also nailed them to the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg. Such an act would have been very strange - they were written in Latin for those learned in theology, not ordinary church-goers - but it has become a standard part of Luther lore. The tone of the Theses is scholarly, rather than defiant, proposing them as subjects for debate. Instead of launching a debate in Wittenberg, he sparked a European conflagration of unparalleled violence. By January 1518 friends of Luther had translated the Theses from Latin into German, and the recently invented printing press transformed the situation. Within two weeks, copies had spread throughout Germany; within two months, they were everywhere in Europe. Luther was as surprised as anyone else by the eruption which now engulfed him. In the summer of 1518, Luther was ordered to present himself in Rome, which he was only able to avoid due to the intervention of Frederick \"the Wise\" of Saxony (d. 1525), whose rule included Wittenberg. The delay in scotching the chicken of heresy in the egg was fatal. Soon the papacy found itself confronted by a groundswell of support in Germany, fueled by deep grievance at centuries of papal interference, and sustained and inflamed by Luther’s own sudden discovery that he was a literary genius of astonishing fluency and productivity; the first to exploit the huge potential of the printed pamphlet. In his writings, sermons, and lectures, Luther continued to develop his reform ideas, moving further and further away from Catholic theology: asserting that both popes and ecumenical councils could err; that secular leaders should reform the Church if the papacy did not; that there was no distinction between clergy and lay people (an idea known as “the priesthood of all believers”); and that requiring clergymen to be celibate was a fruitless attempt to control a natural human drive.\n\nThe papacy was determined to suppress this impertinence. In June 1520, a papal bull banned Luther's writings, and threatened him with excommunication unless he recanted. His response was to publicly burning a copy of the bull before a wondering audience; his excommunication followed in December 1521. The enforcement of the ban fell to the secular authorities, so supporters of Luther prevailed upon emperor Charles V Habsburg (d. 1556) to hear his case at the Diet of Worms (April 1521). Luther obtained a safe conduct to and from the imperial parliament, but was no doubt aware of the value of imperial promises to Jan Hus a century earlier. Luther arrived at Worms supported by a large number of enthusiastic German knights. In a lengthy speech before the assemble, he once again refused to give-in to demands that he recant his ideas. “Unless I am convinced of error by the testimony of Scripture and plain reason,” he said, “I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise.” The most famous part, “Here I stand”, has come to be viewed as the beginning of modern freedom of religious conscience; it was the title of a popular biography of Luther published in the 1950. Alas, the words have not stood up to historical scrutiny, recorded in none of the eye-witness accounts, and were added later as a rhetorical flourish. In response, Charles V and the Diet issued the Edict of Worms, declaring Luther an outlaw. He left Worms with his safe conduct guaranteed for a few days, but, once it expired, it became the duty of every loyal subjects to seize the heretic, and a crime to give him shelter. Bumping along in his wagon to Wittenberg, Luther was \"abducted\" by soldiers of Frederick the Wise, and taken to the safety of Wartburg Castle. The German princes were entangled it in their own complicated relations with the emperor and the papacy; Luther had become a handy weapon in the ancient struggle to decide who truly ruled Germany. Luther remained in hiding for the better part of a year, where he plunged into a task that profoundly influenced the development of both Protestantism and German literature; translating the New Testament into pithy colloquial German. The Luther Bible was ready for publication in 1522; and the complete Bible, with the Old Testament translated from the Hebrew, was published in 1534. Others had already translated the Bible into German, but Luther's rhymes and rhythms, consciously drawn from the speech of ordinary people, are timeless. Even the glories of England's King James Bible can’t compete. During Luther's absence, Wittenberg had degenerated into choas, with moderate and radical followers competing to put Luther's ideas into practice. Although still under threat of arrest, Luther returned to Wittenberg in March 1522, where he preached a series of powerful sermons that quickly calmed the situation. The German Reformation had by then become entangled in German politics and the country seemed on the verge of civil war. Luther was thus able to spend the rest of his life in his home city, writing and organising a new church, Lutheranism. Setting a model for later Protestant clergy, Luther married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, and the couple eventually had six children.\n\nThere was no simple Reformation phenomenon; throughout Europe other individuals began to preach and publish against the existing doctrines and practices of the Church. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli (d. 1531), the powerful preacher at Zürich's major church, developed his own reform ideas at the same time as Luther. The cities of Switzerland were the perfect context for the new movement of reform. Independent, free of any feudal ties, they were run by municipal councils in which merchant elites usually had the predominant voice. Zwingli agreed with Luther about the primacy of faith and the Scriptures, preached against indulgences, the veneration of saints, clerical celibacy, and began translating the Bible into Swiss German. He advocated an even simpler service than Luther, with no liturgy, music other than the singing of psalms, or church decorations; he sought an Iconoclast-style eradication of all religious images and shrines, no matter how historic or beautiful. Zwingli and Luther also disagreed vehemently about the meaning of the Eucharist, the central sacrament in Christianity, based on Jesus’ words as he gave his disciples bread and wine at the Last Supper. No issue in the Reformation was debated as sharply as the Eucharist. Although both rejected Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, Luther replaced it with a view of of Christ's presence even more difficult to grasp, while Zwingli understood it merely as a commemorative service. Luther attacked Zwingli as “of the Devil” and nothing but a “wormy nut”, until fellow reformer Martin Bucer (d. 1551) attempted to mediate between the pair. The three men met at Marburg in 1529, but could not reach agreement on the Eucharist, though they did agree to tone-down their rhetoric. From that point, the reform movement split into two major branches: followers of Luther now called Evangelical Protestantism and those who followed Zwingli called Reformed Protestantism. In general, Reformed ideas spread more widely in Switzerland and southern Germany, while Evangelical ideas in northern Germany and Scandinavia. Meanwhile, Zwingli recognized that, if reforms were going to be permanent, secular authorities as well as religious individuals would have to accept them. He worked closely with the municipal council of Zurich, which officially changed the structure of the church service, ordered that religious images be removed from churches, and established a new court to adjudicate cases that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the bishop’s court. Like Luther in Wittenberg, Zwingli faced radicals who believed that his reforms were too conservative, and moved independently toward a more extensive break with the past. Their leader, Conrad Grebel (d. 1526), insisted upon logic the sacrament of baptism; one of only two sacraments retained by Luther and Zwingli, the other being the Eucharist. If each member of the reformed faith is personally responsible for his/her relationship with God, then how can an infant be baptised? For this we now called this group “Anabaptists”. Under Zwingli's guidance, the reaction of Zürich was swift and extreme; \"if they wanted water, they shall have it\". Anyone even attending a ceremony of this kind was liable death by drowning. Anabaptists were just one of several emerging groups of the so-called “Radical Reformation”, whose theology and spiritual practices varied widely. Over the next century both Catholics and Protestants tortured and executed thousands of radicals in many parts of Europe, often in very gruesome ways. Persecution led them to move to parts of Europe that were more tolerant and later even further; Socinians went to Ottoman Hungary, Hutterites to southern Russia, while Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers to the United States, among others. Anabaptists themselves survive in off-shoots such as the Mennonites and Amish.\n\nSwitzerland’s most important contribution to the Reformation was created by John Calvin (d. 1564). Calvin was born in France and originally studied law. Having converted to Protestantism, he fled persecution in Catholic France for Geneva in 1534, where he soon published The Institutes, a synthesis of Protestant thought arranged in a logical, systematic way. In this, Calvin sets out his key doctrine: God is all-power but loving; the fall of Adam separated humanity from God's love; all humanity is completely sinful and depraved; redemption and a possible reunion with God comes through the redemptive power of Christ; and there is no free will, for God has determined who will be saved and who will not. The latter idea, the doctrine of predestination, had been asserted by Christian thinkers since St. Augustine (d. 430), but Calvin made it absolute. God’s election occurred at the beginning of time, so one's own actions could do nothing to change one’s fate. It is not easy to understand the success of this gloomy creed. However, asking how do we recognize the elect, Calvin replied that we cannot know for sure, but we can confidently say that immoral people are not saved and good people are; those who pray, who attend mass, who are hard-working, honest, thrifty, and generous of spirit. Since redemption had already been decided, human energies could be put to fulfilling God-given “calling” (occupation or profession) in this world. Calvinism ultimately appealed to a wide spectrum of people, but proved especially popular with urban professionals who were attracted to its vigour and dynamism. In 1538, Calvin was expelled by Geneva's city council, alarmed at the rigour of his creed. He sheltered in Strasbourg for three years until Geneva reconsidered, having lapsed in his absence into religious discord. On his return, Calvin sets about transforming the city into a civic theocracy; the church and state should act together, and the leaders of the church should have ultimate authority. Under Calvin, Geneva was not a place for the easy-going. A well-disciplined city, like a well-disciplined individual, might be evidence of God’s election. Most public entertainment - such as theatres, dances, card games, and even drinking - were prohibited or restricted, both because they could lead to immorality and wasted time for the elect. The pastors investigated and disciplined those guilty of heresy, profanity, adultery, gambling, witchcraft, family fights, premarital sex, and absence from church. They made annual visit to every home, and encouraged people to report improper behaviours of their neighbours. Their punishments ranged from scolding to whipping to the death penalty, On one occasion a young man was beheaded for striking his father. Men and women received the same punishment, unlike the European norm in which women were considered morally and intellectually weaker, so indulged with milder punishments. On the credit side, there was a more democratic approach to church affairs. The presbyterian system puts power jointly in the hands of pastors and lay elders, with neither having any authority until elected by the congregation. Calvin was, meanwhile, deeply committed to uplifting the French Huguenots in his homeland, and poured enormous energies into an academy for those who wished to become clergymen and missionaries. Moreover, Geneva became the unofficial epicentre of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for exiles from all over Europe; most were greatly impressed by what they saw. Calvinism spread in different patterns in various parts of Europe. In Germany, it became the state church of a few principalities, even though it was not officially recognized by the Peace of Augsburg. In England, Calvinist reformers worked within the state church to move theology in a Calvinist direction, which came to be called Puritanism. In Scotland, John Knox, who had studied with Calvin in Geneva, worked through the Scottish Parliament to set up a Calvinist state church; Scottish settlers took Calvinism to Ireland later in the century. In France and the Dutch Reformation, which were officially Catholic, they were initally organized secretly, though later more openly.\n\nThe variety of the Protestant Reformation defies summary and simplification. Complex and deep-rooted in its origins, it owed much to circumstance and was varied in its expressions. In Europe, it was disruptive, creating new ecclesiastical cultures founded on the study of the Bible, intense personal scrutiny, and preaching, to which it gave an importance sometimes surpassing even the sacraments. Negatively, it called into question all existing ecclesiastical institutions and created political forces which princes could manipulate for their own ends; usually against the popes whom they saw simply as princes like themselves. Rightly, Protestantism was to become one of the forces determining the shape of modern Europe and therefore of the world.\n\nCatholic Counter-Reformation[]\n\nLeaders within the Catholic Church responded to the Protestant challenge with the Counter-Reformation (1534-1645). which historians see as two interrelated movements, one a drive for internal reform linked to earlier reform efforts, and the other a series of measures designed to combat Protestantism intellectually, politically, militarily, and institutionally. In both, the papacy became the centre of the reform movement rather than its chief opponent. It began somewhat fitfully under Pope Paul III (1534-49), who appointed reform-minded cardinals to report on abuses within the church. The cardinals found evidence of many of the failings pointed to by Martin Luther, including simony (buying and selling church offices), pluralism (holding several offices at once), incompetent and absentee bishops, laxity in monastic orders, and inadequately trained priests. But it took the pope a full 11-years to finally establish a formal response, an ecumenical council at Trent in northern Italy in 1545. The delay was largely caused by the many conflicting interests between Charles V Habsburg and Francis I of France; the former insisted on it being held on imperial territory, while the latter feared that may somehow benefit Charles. From an unpromising start, the council grew in stature, meeting off and on for the next 18-years until 1563. By the end it proved a turning point for the Catholic Church, responding with considerable vigour to the two prongs of the Protestant counter-challenge. On the question of abuses within the Church, the council accepted the validity of the criticism, and put in place corrective measures: doing away with simony and pluralism; requiring bishops to live within their dioceses; founding seminaries to properly train clerics in preparation for a more austere life; archbishops and bishops were given more authority; and parishes took on new importance. On doctrinal matters, the council refuses to yield an inch: the number of sacraments remained at seven; transubstantiation was reaffirmed; clergymen were to remain celibate and chaste; redemption by good works as well as by faith was endorsed; the efficacy of pilgrimages and relics restated; and the Pope's right to grant Indulgences was confirmed, though the involvement of any fee was forbidden. Theologians, such as Robert Bellarmine, were tasked with defending Catholic doctrinal positions that had been attacked by the Protestant reformers, though none could rival the eloquence and moral engagement of Luther or the passion of John Calvin. Paul III, and his successors, Paul IV (d. 1559) and Pius IV (d. 1565), also supported measures designed to stop the Protestant momentum. The Inquisition was given the power to investigate those committing acts deemed theologically unacceptable, and was particularly effective at ending Protestantism in Italy. In 1556, the popes promulgated the first Index Librorum Prohibitorum (\"Index of Prohibited Books\"), a list of thousands of book and authors that Catholics were forbidden to read, print, or distribute; it later included intellectual works of the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment. Like Reformation, the Counter-Reformation went beyond forms and principles in a new devotional intensity, rejuvenating the fervour of laity and clergy alike. Besides making weekly attendance at mass obligatory, and regulating baptism and marriage more strictly, it sought, too, to redeem rural districts sunk in traditional superstition so deep that missionaries called them \"our Indians\".\n\nReforms involved monastic orders as well. Older orders - such as the Benedictines, Franciscans, and Dominicans - carried-out measures to restore discipline and get back to their original aims of caring for the poor and the sick, and public preaching. The most important of the new religious orders was the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits, founded by Ignatius of Loyola (d. 1556). Loyola was a Spanish nobleman and gallant soldier. After being wounded in one of Charles V's wars, he was force to lie in bed recuperating for weeks. During this time, he found himself without the kind of books he enjoyed, heroic romances. Instead, the only reading available was a religious text by a German monk about the lives of saints, in which the spiritual life was conceived as one of holy chivalry; the idea fascinated Loyola. Like Luther, he went through a period of inner turmoil, obsessed by doubts about his past sins. But rather than a new theological approach, he ultimately resolve this through a rigorous program of meditation, prayer, and self-discipline; adapted from Christian mysticism. He later described his techniques in the Spiritual Exercises. At the age-of-33, Loyola began preparing himself for a spiritual life. With no formal educations, he first enrolled at a preparatory school to improve his Latin; his classmates were under 14-years-old. After this, he spent a decade or so studying theology in the Spanish universities of Alcalá and Salamanca, and then Paris; by a curious irony, he studied in Paris at the same time as John Calvin, though it is not recorded that they ever met. In each university, the charasmatic Loyola gathered a group of like-minded young followers, including Francis Xavier, whose later missionary work in Asia won him the title \"Apostle of the Indies\". Though most of them were not ordained, they bound themselves together by taking the standard monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In 1537, they travelled together to Rome to offer their services directly to Pope Paul III, echoing the visits of St. Francis and St. Dominic to Innocent III. Like these 13th-century saints, Loyola was very much of his own time; a man of the 16th-century, where the twin challenges were the drift of much of Europe into Protestant heresy, and the opening up of a far-flung pagan world by the Age of Discovery. To these challenges Loyola could bring the energy and the organising skills of a veteran soldier. After some initial misgivings, the pope responded in 1540 by recognizing the group as a new religious order, the Society of Jesus. Their warrior-founder liked to think of the Jesuits, as they soon came to be called, as the militia of the Church, highly centralized, utterly disciplined, and completely subordinate to papal authority; they were sometimes dubbed \"Soldiers of God\". By his death in 1556, Loyola's order has more than 1,000 members. Preparation for admission took many years of training, and only those who passed rigid examination were allowed to take the special fourth vow of obedience to the pope as a full member. In Europe, the Jesuits undertook extremely effective missionary work both in areas that were wavering in their loyalty, such as Poland-Lithuania, and in territories that had officially become Protestant, such as England, despite the risk of arrest and execution. The order founded schools, taught at universities, and composed thousands of textbooks; during their first two centuries, the Jesuits established over 700 schools in Europe and another hundred in the rest of the world. Their intellectual eminence and political skill raised them to high places in the courts of Europe; often becoming confessors to kings. Meanwhile, the Jesuits were at the forefront of missionary efforts in every part of the world. Francis Xavier (d. 1552), one of the original companions of Loyola, led an extensive mission into Asia, notably to India and Japan; he is reputed to have converted more people than anyone since Paul the Apostle. Matteo Ricci (d. 1610) is considered the founding figures of the Christian missions to China; he became the first European to enter the Forbidden City of Beijing in 1601. Jesuit missionaries were also active among indigenous peoples in New France (Canada), Portuguese Brazil, and the Spanish Americas.\n\nWith the ancient colourful certainties reinforced, an improved priesthood entering service, and the foot-soldiers of the Jesuits, the Catholic Church was suddenly well placed to confront the Protestant challenge, and to provide standards to which Catholic rulers could rally. Many Catholics really took the Church's reforms to heart, intensifying their devotions. Among the most renowned was the Spanish nun and mystic, Teresa of Ávila (d. 1582). At age 21, against her family's wishes, Teresa professed vows as a Carmelite nun at Ávila. The convent was known for its leniency, but, after a serious illness forced her to spend three-years in relative quiet, she began to live-out the Church's rededication to faith and good works, being extremely strict in her practice. She was a proponent of self-flagellation in imitation of Christ's suffering on the cross. Increasingly at odds with the spiritual malaise prevailing in her convent, she began founding reformed Discalced Carmelite convents restoring austerity and strictness to religious life. Teresa's written contributions, which include her autobiography The Life of Teresa of Jesus, and her seminal work The Interior Castle, went on to become Counter-Reformation classics. The same reforming zeal was applied to monasteries by Spanish friar, St John of the Cross (d. 1591). Saints such as Teresa of Avila, and there would be several during the 17th century, were the perfect Catholic response to the Protestant reformers; they were as morally severe as any Swiss Calvinist or English Puritan. This revitalization was also a matter of devotional life at the local level. Confraternities, Catholic voluntary associations of lay people, were established or expanded in many urban parishes and even in villages; Venice had almost 400 by 1700. They held processions and feasts, handed out charity to the poor, administered hospitals and orphanages, and purchased candles, furnishings, and art for churches. It is conventional to call this renewal of the Catholic Church the Counter-Reformation, but the phrase is too negative. In the end, the movement had effects just as deep and long-lasting as the Protestant Reformation.\n\nHenry VIII of England[]\n\nHenry VIII Tudor (1509-1549 AD) is without doubt one of England's most famous kings; arguably one of the world’s most famous kings. Part medieval tyrant, part glamorous \"Renaissance Prince\", the complexities and sheer scale of his legacy ensured that, in the words of one historian, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\". When Henry ascended the throne he was just seventeen. A well-proportioned, good-looking but restless youth, until his brother Arthur’s death he had been intended by his father, Henry VII. for the Church. He was unusually intellectual, the first English king to receive a first-rate humanist education from leading tutors; he read and wrote English, French, and Latin, his annotations filling the books in his large library. He was also a complicated man; intelligent, athletic, a poet, boisterous, passionate, arrogant, and ruthless. Henry’s first act, even before his coronation, was to marry his brother’s widow, Catherine of Aragon (d. 1536), the daughter of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella. He respected the Roman Church and won ready dispensation from the pope to marry a sister-in-law, on the grounds, strongly asserted by Catherine, that her marriage to the 15-year-old Arthur had been unconsummated. There is every sign that Henry and Catherine were happy. She was attractive and intelligent, and they remained together for the first twenty years of his reign. At this stage in his life, Henry cared little for politics, spending most of his time on his leisure - gambling, jousting, hunting and tennis - with government delegated to the royal council. Like his Henry VII, he chose advisers on merit rather than birth, the most prominent initially being Archbishop Thomas Wolsey (d. 1530), thought to have been a butcher’s son. Under king and cardinal, the avoidance of foreign wars, so scrupulously maintained by Henry VII, broke down. In 1511, Pope Julius II made an abrupt about-face in the Italian Wars (1494–1559), creating the the anti-French Holy League. Henry followed Ferdinand V of Spain, and Maximilian I Habsburg into the new League against Louis XII of France, having decided to use the excuse to revive the hoary claim to French territory. In 1512 he sent an army under Thomas Grey of Dorset to reconquer Aquitaine, which England had lost during the Hundred Years' War, only to see it return defeated. A year later, Henry went to France in person, besieging Thérouanne, defeating a French relief force at the Battle of the Spurs (August 1513), and besieging and taking Tournai. The French kind urged James IV of Scotland (d. 1513) to honour the Auld Alliance, renege on Henry VII’s Treaty of Perpetual Peace, and respond in kind to this English aggression. In August, James crosses the river Tweed to invade northern England. In Henry's absence, Thomas Howard of Surrey was charged with driving the invaders back to Scotland. The two sides met at the Battle of Flodden (September 1513), one of the biggest disasters in Scottish history. Scottish pikemen were slaughtered by storms of English arrows, with Henry’s brother-in-law James IV killed in the fighting, alongside 10,000 soldiers includning a large proportion of the nobility. The Scottish crown devolved on to the head of an infant, James V, as Scotland entered a profoundly unsettled period. Meanwhile, Henry decided not to pursue the war with France; he had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian, but received little in return, and England's coffers were now empty. Wolsey had a key role in negotiating the subsequent Anglo-French peace treaty, under which England retained Tournai, secure an annual pension, and Louis XII would marry Henry's young sister, Mary. Wolsey was now in the ascendant. Twenty years the king’s senior, he became chief minister in 1515 and a cardinal the same year, uniting in his portly person the political power of church and state. Henry meanwhile dabbled in ship-building, expanding the royal navy from five ships to thirty. and theology, corresponding with Erasmus. When Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of Wittenberg church in 1517, Henry wrote a lengthy denunciation of them; a grateful pope awarded him the title \"Defender of the Faith\", which still graces all British coins. The king and Wolsey now looked across the Channel at the emerging conflict between new kings Charles V Habsburg and François I of France, but were soon out of their diplomatic depths. In 1520 came the ultimate folly of a star-struck ruler; a summit conference with Francis, the Field of Cloth of Gold at Guînes, near Calais. Pavilions in renaissance designs containing a great hall, a chapel, and a fountain in the courtyard with three separate spouts from which flowed water, spicy wine, and red wine. The meeting between the two monarchs with a retinue of some 6,000 attendants was interspersed with jousting and entertainers. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decades. Wolsey instead arranged an alliance with Charles V, but England’s only rewards were to lose the French subsidy won at Tournai, reprisals against the English cloth trade with the Dutch Netherlands, and a growing enmity between Henry and Wolsey. The cardinal's magnificently expanded palace at Hampton Court, outshining Henry’s Richmond, became a source of envy rather than wonder, as did his new Cardinal’s College in Oxford.\n\nIt was at this time, the mid-1520s, that Henry VIII concluded that his marriage was cursed. A wife in any great dynastic marriage was expected to provide a male heir for her husband, and in this, Catherine of Aragon tragically failed. She bore Henry six children, three of them sons. All were either stillborn or died in infancy, except for one, a daughter Mary, the future Queen Mary Tudor. But female succession was risky, especially as the Wars of the Roses had shattered the certainty of royal succession. No woman had inherited the English throne since Matilda in the 12th-century, and she did not provide an encouraging example. Henry had fathered at least one illegitimate son - Henry Fitzroy of Richmond, born in 1519 to his mistress Elizabeth Blount - which convinced him that the problem was his marriage. Some historian have speculated that a genetic abnormality explains both his reproductive problems and his later physical decline, but his own diagnosis was that his marriage to Catherine was against God’s commandments, as laid down in the Book of Leviticus, “Who so marrieth his brother’s wife doth a thing that is unlawful, he shall be without sons”. This, in fact, is mistranslated from Hebrew, and should say “they shall be childless”, but that of course did not fit. Meanwhile, Henry was openly infatuated with Anne Boleyn, a charismatic lady-of-the-court of 25. She had been unusually well-educated in Paris for a woman of that time, and dazzled the court with her French clothes, music, dancing, and wit. Although her sister, Mary, had been one of Henry’s earlier mistress, Anne rejected his advances, even when reinforced with a shower of jewels and lover’s knots. She would have no sexual relations with him while he was still married to Catherine. A divorce could be achieved by a papal annulment of the marriage. There was good recent precedent; Louis XII of France had his first marriage annulled in 1498, for the nakedly political reason of securing Brittany for France. To allow Henry’s current marriage to Catherine, the pope had accepted that she had never consummated her marriage to his brother, Arthur. Henry now needed to assert the reverse, that it had been consummated, and therefore his marriage to Catherine was invalid. The obstacle was that Catherine resisted with Spanish defiantly stuck to her story, denying the consummation; an annulment would make her daugter illegitimate. In addition, politics inhibited any readiness by Pope Clement VII to be accommodating. After the Battle of Pavia, the pope was effectively a prisoner of the Charles V Habsburg, who was Catherine’s nephew. Circumstances made the issues of principle - which Henry took very seriously - far more dangerous. Could the pope interpret (or as Henry saw it, break) God’s law expressed in the Bible? Was the pope superior to a Christian king in his own realm? These were burning questions in the 1520s and 1530s. Henry was not a patient man, and his attempt to persuade the Pope to annul his marriage took the form of pressure and threats. His explosive frustration, exacerbated by a jousting wound in his leg, led him, in Wolsey’s words, \"to put one half of his realm in danger … and set private whim against all Christendom\". Wolsey struggled hard to secure an annulment, but failed and his star abruptly fell. In 1529, he was stripped of his offices and property, most famously Hampton Court, which became one of Henry's favourite residences. Wolsey fell ill and died on the journey south from York to the Tower of London. Yet his disappearance solved nothing.\n\nHenry VIII now took his revenge on the Church, as Wolsey had predicted. From 1529, he had parliament pass one measure after another to remove the English Church from the jurisdiction of Rome. Although those who held Protestant sympathies in England remained a minority of the population until political events intervened, but they were particularly prevalent among certain groups; merchants with connections to continental Europe, humanist academics, lawyers who resented the clerical privileges, and political opponents of Wolsey. Henry's legislation thus passed the House of Commons easily, but in the Lords, where bishops were strong, there was furious resistance. Henry was not a subtle man, so cajoled, pressured and bullied the Lords; three bishops were arrested, and pardoned only after paying a huge fine. Meanwhile, more and more men, who were hostile to Rome, were appointed to senior clerical offices, most importantly Thomas Cranmer (d. 1556) soon to be made an archbishop. In 1532, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, balked at a final breach with Rome, and, resigned, rather than concede the king’s absolute supremacy over the church, passing his office to a brilliant young lawyer, Thomas Cromwell (d. 1540). By December of that year, Anne Boleyn was pregnant, and, lest his child be born out-of-wedlock, the king pursued both his will and his pleasure with despatch. In January, he privately married Anne, the bigamy quietly ignored. In March, Cranmer was appointed to the recently position of Archbishop of Canterbury; approved by the pope in an effort to prevent a final breach. In April, parliament approved the crucial Act of Restraints in Appeals, ending legal recourse to Rome. In May, Archbishop Cranmer, sitting in judgement at a special court at Dunstable Priory, ruled Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon illegal, and his marriage to Anne Boleyn valid. In June, Anne was crowned queen, while Catherine was banished from court, and forbidden to see her daughter Mary. In 1534 Henry enacted the formal Act of Supremacy, under which the king was \"supreme head in earth of the Church of England\", and made it treason punishable by death to deny it. Prominent figures in public life were required to swear on oath of their acceptance. A few brave men refuse to do so, including two men of European fame: Bishop John Fisher of Rochester, a pioneer of Greek and Hebrew learning; and Sir Thomas More, former chief minister and renowned author of Utopia (1516), an original work of humanist thought descibing an imaginary land governed by equality and justice. Fisher had gone so far as to encourage Charles V Habsburg to intervene, while More had firmly remained silent though now this was being described as \"a silence that echoed across Europe\". A compromise would have been possible, as Archbishop Cranmer urged, but Henry insisted on complete public submission. At show trials in 1535, both were found guilty and beheaded. But most bishops and lower clergy obeyed the king’s will, as did the nobility. This did not make them Protestants. Henry himself was no evangelical reformer, and doctrine was barely involved. He reconfirmed almost all Roman Catholic beliefs and practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy, confession to a priest, withholding communion wine from the laity, prayers for the dead, and salvation from good works (not from faith alone). Those less moderate than himself - even those close to him - risked the block; he continued to have Lutherans or Calvinanist burned as heretics throughout his reign. Henry had not so much denied the pope, as usurped him; instead of the Roman Catholic Church, there was to be an English Catholic Church. The Church of England would only begin to be transformed into a recognisably Protestant denomination during the regency of his son, Edward VI Tudor, but conflicts between conservatives and radical reformers within the Church would convulsed England for more than 150 years.\n\nHenry did back reform where pilgrimages and monasteries were concerned. By the former, he wanted to forestall the dangerous likelihood of More and Fisher becoming modern Thomas Beckets, popular defenders of the church's liberties. Royal injunctions were issued ordering the destruction of shrines and images to which pilgrimage offerings were made, such as lighting votive candles; the shrine of the \"traitor\" Becket were destroyed at Canterbury Cathedral. Meanwhile, Henry set about replenishing the royal coffers with the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the efficient Thomas Cromwell. While the king was not opposed to religious houses on theological grounds, there was concern over the loyalty of the monastic orders, which were international in character and resistant to the new royal authority. The confiscation was not unprecedented; Henry V had dissolved around ninety smaller houses to pay for Agincourt; and Gustav Vasa of Sweden provided a tempting contemporary example. Beginning in 1535, Cromwell's were sent out to make a detailed inventories of ecclesiastical property, and to find evidence of laxity, immorality and corruption; not hard to find prior to the Catholic Counter-Reformation. In 1536, the process began of closing down nearly 900 monasteries, convents and other religious houses, and confiscating their wealth; their land, their libraries, their art, their jeweled shrines and sacred vessels. Most were stripped and then demolished, often using gunpowder. Many sites became quarries, the excellent stone used for a slew of picturesque Tudor manor-houses. Monasteries had often been unpopular as landlords, but their suppression, and fear of what might follow, provoked the biggest popular uprising of the century in northern England, calling itself the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536-37). The participants, who numbered over 40,000, demanded an end to the closure of religious houses, which were centred of community life and relied on by the poor for food and shelter. Many were simply devout Catholics distressed at the upheaval that the king and parliament had visited on their faith. They repaired and reopened some monasteries that had been closed. Henry was responded with characteristic vindictiveness, promising the rebels that he would \"burn, spoil and destroy their goods, wives, children with all extremity\". But Thomas Howard of Norfolk, sent to suppress them, risked his master's wrath and negotiated, promising a general pardon and a parliament to be held at York to address their demands. As in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, the rebels should never have trusted him. When the danger subsided, Henry renounced all concessions, and ordered summary executions of rebels. In all, 216 people were tried and executed, including two lords, seven abbots, and several knights. By 1540, all monasteries, convents and other religious houses had gone. Monastic lands were sold to anyone with money to pay, creating a revolution as a new merchant class gained access to a landed status previously confined to the nobility; forming a powerful interest group against a return to the old order. No comparable transfer of wealth had occurred since the Norman conquest. The consequence did more than anything to prepare the English nation for the modern age.\n\nNot many men have six wives; even fewer execute two. It is not surprising that Henry VIII has an assured niche in popular English history. His marriage to Anne Boleyn, at first passionate, lasted only three years. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover, made her too independent to play the submissive role expected of a queen. Eight months after their marriage, came the disappointing birth of a girl, Elizabeth; the future Queen Elizabeth Tudor. For Henry, this was an apparently unforeseen catastrophe; he had defied his Church and fought parliament to beget a son, and Anne, like Catherine, had failed him. She instantly lost her charm, and he was soon comparing her unfavourably with the submissive charms of a 25-year-old court beauty, Jane Seymour (d. 1537), to whom the king shifted his favour. Anne's downfall came shortly after her third miscarriage, probably of a male child, in January 1536. In May of that year, she was suddenly arrested and sent to the Tower of London on charges of adultery. Anne’s fate has attracted many theories, but remains an enigma. Was it an all-out effort by Henry to leave his fruitless marriage? A plot engineered by Cromwell who viewed Anne as a liability in his pursuits of an alliance with Spain? Malicious and unfounded court gossip? Or simply the perils of being close to a merciless and unpredictable tyrant? A young household musician, Mark Smeaton, was arrested and confessed, probably under torture, to adultery with the queen. This single confession was sufficient, but three other courtiers, including Anne's own brother, were accused of being her lovers. Though the others protested their innocence, all four were tried, condemned, and executed on 17 May. Anne Boleyn herself was beheaded on Tower Green two days later, delayed only by her request to be beheaded in the French manner, with a sword rather than an axe. If Henry felt tearful self-pity at the execution of his wife, he soon got over it; eleven days later, he married Jane Seymour. In October 1637, she did at last bear a son, and England had a future king, Edward VI. but the birth was difficult and the queen died twelve days later. The euphoria that had accompanied Edward's birth turned to deep sorrow, but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his third wife; she was to be the only queen he chose to be buried with. At the time, Henry recovered quickly from the shock, and measures were put in place to find another wife, which, at Cromwell's insistence focused on a continental alliance, for the breach with Rome had pitted all of Catholic Europe against him. In 1539, he was persuaded to marry a Dutch princess, Anne of Cleves, as a diplomatic necessity. The story is famous. Cromwell eulogised on Anne’s beauty, backed up by a portrait of her as a glamorous young lady by the leading artist of the day, Hans Holbein. His diplomacy foundered on the rock of reality. Anne turned out to be a tall, lanky thirty-four-year-old with a pockmarked face who spoke only German. When she arrived in England, Henry went in disguise to meet her, and disliked her on sight, dubbing her no better than a \"Flanders Mare\". He conceded a diplomatic wedding, but carefully did not consummate it on the wedding night; parliament annulled the union within months. She backed out good-naturedly, and received a generous allowance with the title of \"The King's Sister\". Also part of the story is that Henry blamed Cromwell, which brought about his downfall. In June 1540, Cromwell, who had towered higher even than Wolsey, was brusquely arrested at a meeting of the royal council, and his badge of office ripped from his neck. As with most of the sudden dramas of Henry’s reign, the reasons are probably more complicated. Cromwell had shown himself too favourable to religious radical reformers, extending his monastic dissolution into a wave of iconoclasm, and facilitating the circulation Lutheran beliefs forbidden by the king. With his Reformation well advanced, Henry was now seized by doubts. He worried that he had gone beyond offending Rome and had offended God. In 1539, he passed the so-called Act of the Six Articles, explicitly aimed at radical Protestant evangelicals; Anabaptists were burned at the stake. Cromwell lost his head in July 1540, the day Henry married Catherine Howard (d. 1542), young niece of the powerful and conservative Duke of Norfolk. Henry - now an unhealthy fifty-year-old, grossly overweight, and in constant pains from gout - was undoubtedly less rampant than in his prime. His new queen was an auburn-haired 17-years-old, but she only briefly rekindled the dying embers. Catherine sought consolation from her large and gloomy husband by committing in reality what Anne Boleyn had been accused of; namely insanely reckless indiscretions with young men. When the king was inevitably informed that she had been neither a virgin on her wedding night, nor faithful as a wife, Catherine and her alleged lovers ended up on the scaffold in 1542. In a remarkable triumph of hope over experience, Henry got married yet again in 1543, to an intelligent and cultivated 31-year-old widow, Catherine Parr (d. 1548). This time nothing untoward happened, and, importantly, Catherine exerted a calming influence. She nursed her ailing husband, guarded Edward, and reconciled the king with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth; both were restored to the line of succession to the throne in 1543. For his remaining few years, all Henry's children, from three different mothers, lived together for the first time in the royal household.\n\nAs king, Henry VIII greatly expanded royal power during his reign. All the decisions were ultimately made by the king himself, and his closest advisors such as Wolsey, More, Cromwell, and later Richard Rich (d. 1567). This spurious air of autocracy was emphasized by the frequent use of strenghtened treason laws to quell dissent, often without a formal trial by means of bills of attainder. Henry did undoubtedly execute at will, including two of his wives, two top aides, eight close attendants and friends, 20 peers, one cardinal (John Fisher), and numerous abbots. Neverheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, he stayed within established limits, that forced him to work closely with parliament, though it proved highly supportive of his religious policy, with little dissent. Unlike his frugal father, Henry was an extravagant spender. He augmented the royal treasury by seizing church lands and converting money previously paid to Rome into royal revenue, but was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance. In 1538, Henry began the construction of an extravagant new palace in Surrey, lavishly decorated throughout in Renaissance style by craftsmen mainly from Italy, some of whom had worked on the French king's Fontainebleau. Its name reflected conscious competition, in this field as in others, with his fellow monarchs in Europe; it was called Nonsuch, a boast that there was no such palace elsewhere equal to it in magnificence. He seldom occupied Nonsuch Palace, and it survives only in a few prints, torn down in 1683. Vast sums also went on extending or adorning Richmond Palace, the Palace of Whitehall, Westminster Abbey, King's College Chapel in Cambridge, Trinity College, Cambridge, Christ Church in Oxford, and Wolsey's Hampton Court Palace. Henry is traditionally cited as one of the founders of the Royal Navy, increasing it from five ships to thirty and personally supervising the design of a seven-tier battleship, Henry Grâce à Dieu (also known as \"Great Harry\"), the biggest in Europe. By acts passed in 1536 and 1543, English law and administration were for the first time effectively extended both to Wales and to Ireland. In Wales, this was to some extent beneficial, as it abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and English, and gave them representation in parliament. But the acts also contained an infamous language clause, banning Welsh speakers from public office. The effect was to codify a class system based on language; Welsh was now seen as the language of the lower class, with those of higher class choosing English over Welsh. The Welsh Tudors thus did more to suppress Welshness than any Plantagenet. As for Henry’s religious revolution, Wales for the most part followed England in accepting Anglicanism. In Ireland, it was a different story. In 1534 the powerful Fitzgeralds took advantage of Henry’s international isolation to rebel, though to secure broad support. What had effectively become a civil war was end by the intervention of 2,000 English troops - a large army by Irish standards - which began bloody and indiscriminate repression. This initiated the Tudor Conquest of Ireland, an escalation of violence and religious conflict that led to repeated atrocities during five wars over 150 years, as any hope of reasonable Anglo-Irish coexistence disappeared. The conflicts of the 16th century would be transmitted into every succeeding century. In foreign affairs, Henry desire to cut a figure on the European battlefields led him to re-enter the Italian Wars in 1542. With both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations with Charles V improved considerably, and concluded a new alliance. The Anglo-French War (1542–1546) was a ruinously expensive and unsuccessful adventure, only remembered now because during a French attack on Portsmouth, in 1545, the great ship Mary Rose capsized and sank, drowning 500 men. In preparation for a planned march on Paris in alliance with the emperor, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under youthful James V. The Battle of Solway Moss (November 1542) can only be described as a Scottish route; James, who was not present, died a short time later, it was said of \"a broken heart\". The next year, Henry hesitated to invade France, annoying Charles. When he finally went to France personally in 1544, but the long sieges of Boulogne and Saint-Dizier, and the failure of the allies to cooperate, meant the campaign fizzled out. By the end of the year, Charles concluded a seperate peace with France, leaving Henry with Boulogne, expensive to capture, fortify and garrison, and later sold back to the French at a loss. The most lasting effects of the war were a line of forts along the south coast built against a feared French counter-invasion, and the elevation of infant Mary Queen of Scots. There followed eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed the Rough Wooing, to force Mary into marrying Henry's son Edward. The king’s powers were now waning; his armour for the French campaign survives, showing his vast obesity. As death approached, he appeared to modify his commitment to the Reformation, asking for masses to be said in perpetuity for his soul. In his last speech to parliament, on Christmas Eve 1545, Henry pleaded not for the old or the new religion but rather for a reconciliation between the two under a newly \"nationalised\" Church of England. But it was not a Catholic but his old Protestant ally, Archbishop Cranmer, who attended him at his death in 1547. Henry did what many European monarchs regarded as undoable, he defied Rome and survived. He was one of Europe’s great revolutionaries. Henry VIII was succeeded in turn by each of his three children, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I.\n\nEarly Reformation in Germany[]\n\nIn imperial Germany, the Reformation became inexorably entangled with the ancient struggle to decide who truly ruled; the Holy Roman Emperor or the German princes. When Charles V Habsburg (d. 1558) secured the imperial throne in 1591, his vast dominions included, not only the German states of Austria and Bohemia (now Czechia and Slovakia), but also Spain, Flanders (now Belgium), the Dutch Netherlands, part of Hungary, Naples, and Sicily, as well as most of the New World. The famous phrase \"the empire on which the Sun never sets\" was first coined for this realms, rather than the later British Empire. Here at last was a king-emperor with the power and wealth to become a new Charlemagne. To secure their position against a ruler with such unheard-of resources, the German princes needed to find new resources of their own. They enlisted the support of their subject, by appealing to long-standing resentment at papal meddling in German politics, and by claiming that they were acting in the interests of the nation. Martin Luther himself unleashed his incomparable pen on a national tale of historical victimhood, \"The Emperors Frederick, the First and the Second, and many other German emperors were, in former times, so piteously spurned and oppressed by the popes … Therefore let us rouse ourselves, fellow-Germans, and fear God more than man\". This was not a new idea. In 1508, the German prince-electors claimed the privilege to crown the Holy Roman Emperor themselves, dispensing with the centuries-old custom of waiting for an imperial coronation by the popes. Meanwhile, Luther worked closely with secural princes, especially Frederick of Saxony, who kept him out of danger after being outlawed. He viewed them as fully justified in asserting control over, and reforming, the church within their territories. In On Secular Government he instructed all Christians to obey their secular rulers, whom he saw as divinely ordained. In this, Luther’s hopes were largely fulfilled. Individuals may have been convinced of the truth of Protestant teachings, but territories became Protestant when their ruler - whether a prince, a noble, or a city council - brought in pastors who had accepted Protestant ideas, sponsored public sermons, re-educated their clergy, supportrf schools and universities that would impart correct doctrine, closed convents and monasteries, and confiscated church property. This happened in many of the states of the Empire during the 1520s and '30s. There was a danger, too: might not Luther’s radicalism stir-up their subjects into reject all earthly authority? In the Knights' Revolt (1522-23), free-knights, who controlled small territories along the Rhine, revolted against larger territorial princes. Their grievances were primarily economic and military; knights were becoming obsolete because of recent military changes, and their small estates could not support them. But they used rhetoric based on Luther's ideas to justify their movement. This revolt was quickly suppressed but inspired another revolt with much more far-reaching consequences; the Great Peasants' War (1524-25). Peasants in many parts of Germany objected to new laws enclosing common land and resticting fishing rights, and rising levels of taxation. In 1524, what began as a protest about fishing in a particular stream, quickly became a widespread peasant rebellion; the largest mass uprising in Europe before the French Revolution. In March 1525, a union of seperate groups in central and southern German issued the Twelve Articles, calling for the complete abolition of serfdom, as it was invented by man without basis in Scripture; thus linking Protestant ideas of religious freedom with issues of social justice. Their demands were backed by military action, and peasant armies seized castles, noble houses, abbeys, and a few cities. They had expected Martin Luther to support them, but he was by nature conservative, urging rulers “as God’s sword on earth to knock down, strangle, and stab the insurgents as one would a rabid dog”. Peasant armies included former mercenaries, so were not completely inexperienced, but once veteran imperial armies returned from Italy to rally territorial rulers, they were duly crushed with brutality and vengeance; slaughtering upwards of 100,000 peasants and poor townsfolk.\n\nThe Reformation was now safe for the rulers of Germany. The first to take the plunge was the furthest from Rome, the Teutonic State beyond the Elbe. Their Grand Master, Albert Hohenzollern (d. 1568), having met Luther personally, declared himself no longer the mere head of a religious order obedient to the pope, but the hereditary duke of a Protestant state. This was in 1525; political Protestantism and Prussia were thus born in the same moment. Others followed where Prussia had gone: mostly northern German princes and southern German cities. While Charles V at first took a hard line on Luther, outlawing him and banning his work, thereafter, he became increasingly distracted by wars against Francis I of France and the Ottoman Turks. Hoping to pursue a policy of reconciliation, he called an Imperial Diet in 1530, to meet at Augsburg. Luther’s associate Melanchthon developed the Augsburg Confession, and the Protestant princes presented this to the king-emperor. He strongly rejected it and Protestant princes closed ranks, forming a military alliance called the Schmalkaldic League (1531). The military situation meant that Charles could not respond immediately; he had only recently seen off the Ottoman high tide at the Siege of Vienna (1529). The 1530s and early '40s saw complicated military and political maneuvering among many of the European powers, but, by 1543, Charles V had triumphed in his great struggle, and was now in no mood to compromise. Initially the king-emperor was very successful, driving the League's forces out of southern Germany, forcing the southern cities to come to terms, and culminiating in the Battle of Mühlberg (April 1547). A highly-trained veteran army, including the dreaded Spanish Tercios, marched deep into Germany, and decisively defeated the League on the banks of the Elbe. Once again, a Holy Roman Emperor seemed to bestride Germany. However much the German princes disliked one another, they disliked the prospect of losing their independence even more. Protestants and Catholics banded together and threatened to call on French help rather than allow Charles V to rule absolutely. After a period of inconclusive fighting, it was clear to both sides that no military victory could resolve the deep religious divisions within the empire. In 1555, a weary Charles V, desperate for a solution, instructed his brother, Ferdinand, to call another Imperial Diet at Augsburg to sign the Peace of Augsburg (1555) in his name. In effect, the emperor conceded to the reality that had emerged in Germany since Luther's Ninety-Five Theses sparked-off the conflict. Each German ruler, great or small, was given the right to decide whether to be Lutheran or Catholic; neither Calvinism nor Anabaptism were allowed. The formula was later succinctly described in the Latin phrase cuius regio, eius religio (whoever rules the territory, his is the religion). It was a curious concession for an emperor who had sought to create a united Empire with a single church. Yet it was one necessary if he was to keep any loyalty of Germany’s princes as a splendid but distant overlord. The Peace of Augsburg did accomplish what its makers had hoped: it ended religious war in Germany for many decades, in large part because the forces of Protestantism and Catholicism were so finely balanced. Limitations and problems in the settlement would become clear by the late-16th-century, with the issue fought out once again on bloody battlefields of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nScandinavia Reformation[]\n\nCompared with the religious turmoil that engulfed the European powerhouses of Germany, England, and France, Scandinavia adopted Protestantism somewhat more peacefully. After the 10th-century Viking Age, Scandinavia tends not to play a major role in wider European politics. The story of the next 500 years was one of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (which included what is now Finland) struggling to maintain stable kingdoms, with the added ambition of bringing one or both of the others into a political union. Norway gradually became the junior of the three, dominated first by Sweden, and then by Denmark. Denmark and Sweden, meanwhile, engaged in two closely related means of shifting the balance of power, warfare and marriages, set against a backdrop of moves by the German-dominanted Hanseatic League to gain monopoly control of the fur and fish trade. In 1388, Swedish nobles turned to Margaret Estridsen of Denmark (d. 1412) for help in opposing the Germans. Their combined efforts were successful, and in 1397 a treaty set up the Kalmar Union, uniting Denmark, Norway, and Sweden under Margaret. The treaty provided for a common foreign policy, but separate laws and representative assemblies in each kingdom. The Swedish Riksdag was unique, because along with the usual estates of clergy, nobility, and bourgeois, it had a fourth estate for the peasantry. The Kalmar Union (1397-1523) only briefly remained a political reality. Margaret's successor Eric VII Estridsen (1412-42) fought less successfully against the Hanseatic League and appointed Danes to public office in Sweden, souring relations. In 1438, the Swedish parliament effectively withdrew from the union, electing their own king, which in turn prompted the Danish nobility to depose the unpopular Erik. Attempts to restore the union of the three realms continued for another century, with only brief success. The last such king, Christian II Oldenburg of Denmark (d. 1523), reconquered Sweden on his third attempt in 1520, though it proves a shortlived triumph. With almost the entire Swedish nobility gathered in Stockholm for his coronation, Christian promptly had them all arrested and convicted of heresy by the pro-union Archbishop Gustavus Trolle. Over the course of three days from 7 November 1520, eighty Swedish nobles, bishops, and prominent bourgeoisie were brought to the main square to be beheaded. The so-called Stockholm Bloodbath became one of bitterest moments in Sweden's history. If the intention had been to secure the throne, it proved wholly unsuccessful. Among the victims were the father and two uncles of a young noble, Gustav \"Vasa\" Eriksson, who emerged as the leader of the Swedish independence movement. Gustav received financial backing the Hanseatic League, which was at war once again with Denmark, but, at first, enjoyed little success, failing to garner sufficient support to challenge Christian's regime. Chased by loyalist armies, Gustav had no alternative but to flee Sweden for Norway. Two exhausted skiers caught-up with him near the Norwegian border, to tell him that the nobles, who had until now refused to support him, had changed their minds. This pivotal event is still celebrated every year in the famous Vasaloppet cross-country ski-race. After this, the rebellion steadily grew in strength, and, in June 1523, Gustav entered Stockholm to be crowned king.\n\nAs king of Sweden, Gustav Vasa (1523-60) was in a precarious position, his realm devastated by three years of civil war, and with the hard-nose businessmen of the Hanseatic League impatient for a return on their investment. But how to repay in a country where only the Church was rich? And how to get rid of his most prominent opponent, Archbishop Trolle? The solution to both problems presented itself in two clerics, brother Olaf and Laurentius Petri, who had recently returned from the University of Wittenberg where they studies under Martin Luther himself. Like his contemporary Henry VIII of England, politics were intertwined with religion to produce the Swedish Reformation. At the Diet of Västerås (1527), Gustav persuaded the assembly to break from the papacy, and establish a Lutheran Protestant Church. If Henry VIII had little genuine religious conviction, then Gustav had none, only a desperate need of funds. He plundered Church property and wealth with astonishing cynicism, and used it to buy the support of the lower nobility with part the proceeds. The rest, he used astutely to centralize his administration, and build an extremely efficient army and navy, both of them used frequently over the next century and a half. Hostilities and alliances among Scandinavian powers shifted constantly, with the Danes and Swedes sometimes united as in the Thirty Years' War in Germany, and sometimes fighting against each other, as in the Great Northern War (1563–70), which ultimately ended in Danish defeat.\n\nMeanwhile in Denmark, the parliament (rigsraad) deposed Christian II soon after the loss of Sweden, and elected to the throne his uncle Frederick I Oldenburg (1523–33), ruler of Schleswig-Holstein on the southern Jutland Penisula. Frederick rarely visited Denmark proper, but, when he did, the rigsraad was alarmed to observe that he appeared to sympathize with the Lutheran heresy. He openly protected Protestant reformer Hans Tausen, another student under Luther at Wittenberg. In 1525, Tausen was expelled for his views from Antvorskov Church in Viborg, but continued to travel and preach throughout Denmark, at first in the open air, and then a small chapel that soon proved too small for the crowds. He eventually moved to Copenhagen, which became a hotbed of reformist activity, fostered by general resentment a Church tithes. On Frederick's death in 1533, the Catholic majority in the rigsraad attempts to withhold the crown from his son, Christian III Oldenburg (1534-59), who was known to be an even more committed Lutheran. The result was a civil war, which ended in Christian's favour thanks to his brilliant general Johann Rantzau, and support from the merchant classes; by now the Hanseatic League was dominated by Protestants. After capturing Copenhagen in July 1536, Christian arrested several prominent Catholic bishops, established a Danish Lutheran Church, and confiscated Church property in order to clear his war debts. Surprisingly little violence took place in Denmark, but imposing Lutheranism on Norway proved more difficult, and even more so on Iceland, which Denmark also dominated; though \"exploited\" perhaps better reflects their relationship. In Iceland, widespread Catholic resistance continued until Bishop Jón Arason was beheaded in 1550. Brought into the new faith within a few short years due the financial problems of two rulers, Scandinavia has nevertheless remained firmly Lutheran ever since.\n\nSwiss Reformation[]\n\nIn the early 16th-century, Switzerland was a semi-independent part of the Holy Roman Empire, though it was really a loose confederation of thirteen cantons. The cantons were often hostile to one another, as well as to powers from outside the Swiss Confederation. Promoted initially by Huldrych Zwingli in Zurich, Protestantism spread to five other cantons, while seven remained Catholic. After numerous minor incidents and provocations from both sides, a Protestant pastor was burned on the stake in Schwyz in 1529. and in retaliation Zürich declared war; the Wars of Kappel (1529-31). The Catholic cantons formed an alliance and sought the support of the pope and Charles V Habsburg. Not to be outdone, Zwingli made treaties with other Protestant cantons and planned a grand anti-Habsburg alliance involving France, England, and others. None of this ever materialised, but the two sides met militarily at the Battle of Kappel (October 1531), just south of Zurich; a decisive Catholic victory in which Zwingli was killed. Both sides quickly decided that a treaty was preferable to further fighting; the Peace of Kappel basically ordered each side to give up their foreign alliances, and allowed each canton to determine its own religion; introducing the principle cuius regio, eius religio (\"whoever rules the territory, his is the religion\") later adopted in the Peace of Augsburg (1555). The defeat meanwhile ended the pre-eminence of Zürich in the Swiss Reformation, with John Calvin and Geneva picking up the torch. But the tension and distrust between Catholic and Protestant cantons remained essentially unresolved, paralysing any common foreign policy. Unable to agree which side to take in the Thirty Years' War, the Swiss stuck to a policy of neutrality that is still characteristic of modern Switzerland. The Swiss Confederation, established courageously in the 15th-century, almost collapsed under the strain of Reformation and Counter-Reformation. But it did somehow hold together, while becoming an increasingly sleepy backwater of Europe, until rudely awakened by Napoleon in 1798.\n\nFrancis I and Charles V[]\n\nHenry VIII of England was just one of a trio of glamorous European rulers born within a few years of each other. A new mood of youth and swagger entered the French court with the accession of the 20-year-old Francis I Valois (1515-47), a cousin and son-in-law of childless Louis XII. It was clear from the outset that Francis really loved being king: loved the hunting, the feasting, the jousting, and loved above all the ready availability of beautiful women. He was married twice, who gave him seven children, but not much else. They were certainly no match for their husband’s regiment of mistresses; of whom the influential at court was Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly, and the most famous was Mary Boleyn, later the mistress of Henry VIII and sister to his wife, Anne Boleyn. Francis was, in every fibre of his being, a man of the Renaissance; he also possessed the wealth to indulge his genuine passion for art. The magnificent art collection of French kings, which can still be seen at the Louvre, was begun during Francis' reign. It was entirely typical of him that he brought an aged Leonardo da Vinci from Italy, settling him in at Amboise, where the great man lived in comfort until his death; he painted very little during these years, but brought with him many of his greatest works, including the Mona Lisa. Books, too, he revered, working diligently to improve the royal library, which at his death contained over 3,000 volumes, and was open to any scholar; in the fullness of time it provides the nucleus of the Bibliothèque Nationale. His greatest intellectual triumph came in 1529 when, to the fury of the Sorbonne, he founded the Collège de France as an alternative, to promote such disciplines as Hebrew, Ancient Greek, and even Arabic. Francis poured vast amounts of money into building. Château d'Amboise was very largely his creation, as were Blois and Chambord and, best-loved of all his châteaux, Fontainebleau, where he gave his favourite painter, architect and sculptor, Francesco Primaticcio, a free hand and which still bears his salamander in every room. He also rebuilt the Château du Louvre, transforming it from a medieval fortress into a building of Renaissance splendour. Francis later married his son, the future Henry II Valois, to Catherine de' Medici (d. 1589), who, though infamous for her role in the French Wars of Religion, made an important contribution in bringing the arts, music, and ballet of her native Florence to the French court. It would have been an excellent thing for France if the Valois kings had been able to keep their hands off Italy; alas, they could not. Francis took up his father-in-law's ailing and expensive cause in Italian Wars (1494-1559). He wasted no time revenging himself for the loss of Milan. He defeated the forces of the Holy League at the long and hard Battle at Marignano (September 1515), shattering their Swiss mercenaries whose halberds had previously seemed invincible. In a mood of medieval chivalry, Francis had himself knighted on the battlefield by the almost legendary Pierre de Bayard; known in his own lifetime as the \"knight without fear and beyond reproach\". In October, he rode triumphantly into Milan, beside himself with joy and pride. During these early year of his reign, Francis was the premier monarch of Europe. But in 1519, there was a serious challenger to this position.\n\nIn that year, Maximilian Habsburg died, and was succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor by his grandson, Charles V Habsburg (1516-56). Through a mix of shrewd marriages and good fortune, Charles with his younger brother Ferdinand ruled a very large slice of Europe and beyond, including the imperial German crown, Austria, Spain, Flanders, the Dutch Netherlands, Bohemia (modern-day Czechia and Slovakia), and Hungary, as well as most of the New World. Other European rulers were desperate to foil this plan for virtual world hegemony: both Francis and Henry VIII declared themselves rival candidates for the imperial throne of Germany. Although the prince-electors, all German, hated the idea of a French or English emperor as much as Charles himself, the Habsburg took no chance, clinching the election by dispensing vast sums in bribes. This was the first encounter in a rivalry between Charles and Francis which came to dominate the politics of early-16th-century Europe; it involved a large measure of personal animosity. Charles' election expenses had been truly breathtaking, in part because his staunch Catholicism contrasted with the growth of Lutheranism alienating a few German princes, but mainly because the prince knew that, with such powerful candidates, they could hold out for truly stupendous kickbacks. Despite his vast domain and the flow of bullion from the New World, Charles V was crippled by debt throughout his reign; the interest rates of his Augsburg-based bankers, the Fugger family, were never less than 12% per annum. Meanwhile, other European rulers were desperate to foil his plan for virtual world hegemony. Francis, preparing to make war on his rival, attempted first to secure an important ally in his neighbour to the north, Henry VIII of England. The two were of much the same age and character: they shared the same boisterous energy, the same love of beautiful women. A degree of jealousy was inevitable; and of mistrust too, because of Henry's brief invasion in 1513. The two met in June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. It was a magnificent name and the occasion was more magnificent still. There was seemingly endless jousting, banqueting, dancing, mutual embracing, and exchanging of lavish presents neither could afford. It was all great fun, but when the two monarchs separated at last, neither trusted the other an inch. The English king immediately moved on to a less sumptuous but more fruitful meeting with Charles V in Kent. In 1521, Charles V strengthen his hand further, signing a treaty with Pope Leo X, as the result of which a papal-imperial army expelled the French once again from Milan, restoring the house of Sforza. This committed the pope fairly-and-squarely on the imperial side, and when Leo was succeeded in 1523 by his cousin as Pope Clement VII, Charles V naturally assumed that he would follow the same policy. Instead, the pope tried to make peace between the pair; an attempt that failed utterly, just as everyone had told him it would. The emperor was adamant that he would yield Milan only in exchange for Burgundy, part of his grandmother's inheritance. Francis in turn was determined to claim Milan once and for all. In mid-October 1524, Francis crossed the Alps for the second time, at the head of an army numbering more than 40,000. Before the end of the month, Milan was duly recovered. He then turned south to Pavia, whose imperial garrison proved a tougher nut to crack than he had expected. With winter approaching, the French king’s most sensible course would have been to retire to Milan. Instead, he besieged Pavia for four unusually cold and uncomfortable months without success, and was still there in February when an imperial army appeared on the horizon. The ensuing Battle of Pavia (February 1525) was the first to prove conclusively the superiority of firearms over medieval warfare. When the fighting was over, the French army had been virtually annihilated. Francis himself had shown, as always, exemplary courage; after his horse was cut from under him, he had continued to fight on foot until at last, overcome by exhaustion, he had allowed himself to be captured. A few weeks later, he was in a deeply gloomy fortress in Madrid, negotiating peace with Charles under duress. The only thing to be said about the resulting Treaty of Madrid (January 1526), by which, in return for his own liberty, Francis surrendered Burgundy as well as Naples and Milan, is that he had not the faintest intention of observing it. Before Francis returned to Paris, there was one unhappy little ceremony to be completed first. On the Bidasoa River, which formed, as it still does, part of the border between France and Spain, two rowing boats made their way from opposite banks to a pontoon in mid-stream; one carried the king; and the other bore two little boys, the 8-year-old Dauphin and his younger brother, who were on their way to Spain as hostages.\n\nFrancis of course refused to surrender Burgundy, but did not w"
