'From Cover to Vinyl â The Artistry of Elvis Bootlegs' New Book: When 'Bootleg Elvis' was published in 2012, it sold out almost immediately, and became an instant favorite of Presley collectors all over the world, most calling it the Bootleg Bible.

Since then, additional rare bootleg titles have been discovered, not to mention many unexpected variations of some classic albums.

So â¦ it seemed to be time for a new and updated look at this world.

Whereas Bootleg Elvis mainly relied on text to tell the story, this new edition chooses to focus on photographs.

Using the 2012 classic as a reference point, we decided to feature scans of every cover, label, piece of vinyl and insert for you.

This will make it easy to identify each and every pressing and variation.

We also decided to split the original book into two volumes. In the first, every known bootleg 7" and 10" record will be noted.

The second will cover all the wonderful 12" releases and is scheduled for a Summer 2019 release.

In Bootleg Elvis, some of the original bootleggers were given space to recount the ins and outs of making their releases a reality.

This time we allow the FBI some equal time, and let you see their side of the story. We were able to lay our hands on a massive collection of FBI files regarding the Presley bootleg industry, and will share the best of that material, for the first time ever, in this book.

For example, in the first volume weâll show how the FBI prepared for the UPDATED - âWhere No One Stands Aloneâ In-Depth Review: It is forty years since Elvis Presley entered a recording studio and he seems very reluctant to record anything new. So in terms of releasing a "new" album of Elvis material the topic has always been a tricky one. After commercial failure of the last Elvis / RPO album that concept has been dropped in favour of an Andy Childs led âRe-Vampâ of some Elvis Gospel.

Recorded over fifty years ago there is no doubt that some of Elvisâ Gospel songs might benefit from some sensitive modern production. And, after all, there is an interesting selection of tracks to work with. Not only that, but Lisa Marie was also involved in the recording.

So can a new âRe-Vampâ of Elvis Gospel really work and can we recommend it to Elvis collectors?

And HAVE YOUR SAY - what do you think of the new album? Are we wrong in our opinions?

(CD Reviews, Source;ElvisInfoNet) 'Elvis' Home-Recordings' Bootleg Cancelled: As we noted below several Elvis bootleg suppliers have jumped on the bandwagon offering the newly found Bad Nauheim home-recordings. These recordings discovered by the truly generous Juan Luis Gonzalez Brugal have been offered for FREE DOWNLOAD via the Phoenix Elvis Forum.

One company the "3DM audio" label however offered these recordings on CD as a "non-profit base" release.

Others have been priced at US$45 / EuroE40 + postage for the 3cds.

EIN is hoping that these recordings find a home on FTD perhaps on CD 2 of the 'For LP Fans Only' Classic Album.

Today's update is that the "3DM audio" label has now cancelled their"non-profit base" release.

They note, "Due to the push of dealers and producers we are not able to realize our gesture.

It is impossible to give something for free..

if we would have more reactions it can go after all but for now.

We are very, very sorry to inform you that, due to the low response of our offer to GIVE out the home recordings restored on CD for only production costs, is cancelled.

We need a minimum of 300 orders to break even. At the moment the numbers are too low.

The material is ready with correct facts and background information.

Not like what all announced releases of these home recordings state.

We wanted to enclose the complete fool sessions and a short unreleased conversation from a German fan with Elvis in Germany in 1958 about music with was very informative from Elvis side. As also rare kindly donated unpublished photos.

We realize that an act of generosity less appreciated than asking the full amount.

In the meantime Juan Luis has confirmed, "If I sign something it would be a waiver to Sony/FTD. I am not making money off of this or endorsing anything outside FTD/Sony. I hope that is very clear."

The Cleveland, November 6, 1976 Afternoon & Evening shows are previously unreleased and moreover, they were never available in listenable sound, until now!

Elvis November â71 tour was rated as one of Elvisâ very best in the 70s. Compared with previous tours in September and November 1970, individual shows were longer and set list was variable more than before. It was the only tour in 1971 and it was the last time when Elvis was accompanied by The Imperials, too. Elvis played 14 shows in 12 days in 12 different cities.

Among the concert highlights are fantastic performances of 'Proud Mary', 'How Great Thou Art', 'Iâm Leavinâ', 'Bridge Over Troubled Water', 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy' and 'The Impossible Dream'.

Both concerts are taken from direct transfers of recently-found original audience-recorded cassette tapes. Ask your supplier for samples.

This CD is packaged in a nicely designed double digipak.

'The Asheville Marathon' Import CD: The publicity notes... âAudiRecâ is back with a very nice and special 4 CD box, titled 'The Asheville Marathon'. Hear three of the most unusual Elvis Presley Shows of the 1970s! When Elvis came to Asheville, NC in late July of 1975 to play the final shows of his running tour, he was indeed in a âgivingâ mood. Elvis delivered a whole bunch of rarely performed song material and handled a big part of them in a kind of âElvis By Requestâ style. These are AUDIENCE recordings. In July 1975, Elvis played 21 shows in 11 different cities. This tour was rated as being one of the very best in Elvis' last years. His powerful vocal delivery, his entertaining mood and his willingness to improvise various unusual songs are what make this tour such a stand-out, and the final 3 shows in Asheville, NC were simply stunning! In Asheville Elvis also played the longest shows of the tour and performed many rarely sung songs. He was kind of promoting his new album âELVIS TODAYâ with âShake A Handâ, âFairytaleâ, âT.R.O.U.B.L.E.â and âPieces Of My Lifeâ. More than any time before he was interacting with his audience, singing songs by request. For example âMemphis Tennesseeâ, âAn American Trilogyâ, âHeartbreak Hotelâ, âJailhouse Rockâ, âSomethingâ, âReturn To Senderâ or âWooden Heartâ.

Elvis was in a hilarious mood. He gave away several golden rings and a fan in the first row was lucky to get Elvisâ Gibson Ebony Dove guitar! These shows were previously released, but all original releases are very hard to find now. Our friends from SA have enhanced the sound from scratch, so we are sure that those shows never sounded better! The release is in a deluxe 4 CD Long-Box with 16-page booklet, filled with photos and press reviews. To make our release even more attractive for serious collectors, we present it in 3 different variations.

EIN Note: All these shows have been previously out on bootleg 'Gyrating Asheville' and 'Pieces Of My Life' being the most well-known. - See 'All The CD News 2018' for full details & tracklist

IT IS A FAKE! Elvis Secret Rehearsal tape! The recent Record Collector magazine features an incredible side-story stating that '68 Comeback percussion player Frank Devito has an unreleased reel-to-reel tape of Elvis rehearsing in a trio.

It sounds way too exciting to be true and hard to believe that a working musician has never thought about the importance of his Elvis rehearsal tape. However Devito is still a working musician so there is a possibility that he has never had time to explore his old reel-to-reels.

Checking session notes unfortunately Claude Williamson is not credited as playing on any Elvis recording session.

It is a fact though that Frank DeVito played bongos.

EIN has confirmed that the tape is a FAKE, with "Elvis" supposedly rehearsing 1970's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' at the June 1968 NBC sessions.

It was always too good to be true.

Devito said that he had no way of playing or checking the reel-2-reel however as a still active musician this is a little hard to believe. UPDATED - âWhere No One Stands Aloneâ In-Depth Review: It is forty years since Elvis Presley entered a recording studio and he seems very reluctant to record anything new.

Checking session notes unfortunately Claude Williamson is not credited as playing on any Elvis recording session.

He was however a noted Jazz pianist and did play piano for NBC "In 1968 he started working as a pianist for NBC first on The Andy Williams Show, then for Sonny and Cher" (ex wiki). So there is a possibility, albeit slight, that he was around the NBC studios in June 1968.

The NBC orchestra led by Billy Goldenberg who played at the NBC sessions did not include a piano player, it was Don Randi from the Wrecking Crew who played in the band. It is a fact though that Frank DeVito played bongos.

EIN notes - The set features nothing new gathering all its material from official releases as well as previous bootlegs such as 'Elvis Rebooked'. The bootleggers are struggling to make a buck. Checking the tracklist they have taken the recent FTD 'OFF STAGE' release and re-sequenced it to the two correct concerts.

Other material is such as FTD's 'Polk Salad Annie' Feb 15th show.

It all combines to makes 7CDs, albeit the two 16th & 17th shows being only the 6 / 7 songs released by FTD so are super short.

I guess it is comparatively cheaper than buying every release individually but then again, nothing new and no nice booklets photos. Fans should support official releases.

EIN's good friend Keith Flynn's fabulous Elvis Sessions website shows where everything comes from.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) Three new Straight Arrow CD releases:

'Rumble In Rhode Island' - Out first "Rumble In Rhode Island: Musical Chairs at The King's Lair". This is Straight Arrow's very first release from Elvis' June/July 1974 tour and the Providence concert is easily one of the best of the tour!

The Providence, June 22nd, 1974 3pm is a completely new show, even for die-hard Elvis fans. It has never been in circulation - in any form! Our CD is taken directly from an original audience recorded mastertape source. It was recorded by the same guy who taped those other Providence concerts on June 26, 1976 (afternoon) and the May 23rd, 1977 shows. The sound quality is very good for an off-line recording in a big auditorium. Highlights include a pounding 'Big Boss Man', and a truly dynamite 'Trying To Get To You'. 'Help Me' is sung with great warmth and sincerity.

This release is presented in a de-luxe 6-panel digipak.

See 'All The CD News 2018' for full details 'My Wish Came True': It was the 1st tour of 1977 and in spite of his unhealthy look, Elvis was in solid voice - especially near the end of the tour. February 20 1977 is one of best shows of the tour and was the first time that Elvis attempted his recent single "Moody Blue".

Our release has been taken directly from a 1st generation copy of an original audience recorded master cassette tape, as recorded by Claude Baker (aka Crazy Canuck), who passed away in September 2016. Claude attended, and recorded, all of Elvis' shows during the February tour of 1977.

Portions of the Charlotte concert were previously released from a soundboard tape on the official 'Follow That Dream' label, but this show has never been available on CD in its entirety before. Note: This is the very last audience-recorded show from the February 1977 tour that is still unreleased. The sound quality is very good. There are highlights a-plenty, including a soulful 'You Gave Me A Mountain', strong versions of 'My Way' and 'How Great Thou Art', and a truly gorgeous 'Unchained Melody'.

This release is presented in a de-luxe 6-panel digipak 'There's A Sweet Spirit In This Place' - A new special find. But just weeks ago we were suddenly able to obtain this very interesting recording in excellent sound - and complete. We are aware of the fact that there is a so-called May 4th, 1976 D/S in circulation, but it presents only half of the show in average sound. It was even spliced with about 30 minutes of May 2nd, 1976 D/S! What we are releasing now is the real McCoy, folks!

So now for the first time ever - in excellent audience recorded sound, and complete from beginning to the end! The show is a true delight - Elvis is in a relaxed mood, singing remarkably well... Best show & best sound of the season!

This release is presented in a de-luxe 6-panel digipak with a collection of photos taken in Lake Tahoe, May 1976 as well as an original pre-season promotional article.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) âElvis Presley: Stories Behind the Songsâ New Book: A new Elvis book for Christmas, 'Elvis Presley: Stories Behind the Songs' from Matt Shepherd a 200-page volume will be released December 3, 2018.

Matt Shepherd has presented several shows for BBC Local Radio on Elvis Presley over the years, including more than 50 with his good friend Freddy Zapp on BBC Radio Cornwall.

Matt who is an EIN contributor has been a fan of Elvis for more than 30 years and over the years has collected a huge collection of hundreds of records and Elvis information.

He has written Elvis-related articles for Elvis publications and has also interviewed many Elvis friends over the past decades, including Jerry Schilling, George Klein, Larry Geller and the late Joe Esposito.

The book starts in 1969 â 50 years ago â when Elvis was re-discovering himself as an artist, after years in the Hollywood wilderness. He had just performed the 68 comeback special â showing that he was still able to excite as a performer. The book looks at those essential 1969 Memphis recordings, it looks at Elvisâ majestic return to the live stage, and the huge concerts at Madison Square Garden and the Aloha Satellite Show from Hawaii. Although many of Elvisâ countless solid gold hits feature in the book, the author is also keen to explore the lesser known album tracks â all of which he feels deserves their special place centre stage. . The book aims to have the reader look at each song in a different light â maybe go back and play the lesser heard songs and appreciate them in a whole different way after reading the story behind that particular track. If it further builds on the fansâ knowledge about Elvis and brings around a bigger appreciation of Presleyâs music then the book will have achieved its purpose.

Shreveport photographer Jack Barham dies: He may not be a household name but Shreveport photographer Jack Barham documented some of Elvis' most important moments as he headed for stardom.

Jack Barham, chief photographer for the Shreveport Journal died Friday aged 92.

Barham, a World War II combat photographer, worked for the Journal from three days after he came home from the the Second World War until March 1991 when it closed.

In addition to his World War II photography, Barhamâs photography took him to 20 foreign countries.

Often, Barham became personal friends with celebrities after photographing them, and those friendships lasted throughout their lives.

When a young singer named Elvis Presley made several appearances on KWKHâs popular radio show, The Louisiana Hayride, Barham was there to photograph him.

The two became friends, and Jack often would tell stories of the young Elvis to young reporters as he developed photos in his lab at the back of the Shreveport Journal newsroom.

Barham also photographed and became friends with Bob Hope and John Wayne during their visits to Shreveport.

When Wayne filmed the Civil War movie, The Horse Soldiers in 1959, he asked Barham to take the publicity shots.

Barhamâs photographs often appeared in newspapers across around the world through the Associated Press and have also shown up in National Geographic and Encyclopedias.

New Elvis Home Recordings Discovered: EIN is stunned that another tape has been discovered from Elvis' Home Recordings in Bad Nauheim, Germany late 1958.

HUGE THANKS to Juan Luis Gonzalez Brugal who has obtained the tape which features Elvis singing at home with Red West, Rex Mansfield, Charlie Hodge and Lamar Fike. Previous songs from the same session have been released such as Earth Angel, I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen, There's No Tomorrow, and The Fool.

However this second tape features some fabulous incredible performances of 'He Knows Just What I Need', 'Like A Baby', 'His Hand In Mine', a very different arrangement ofÂ 'Stand By Me' even an amazing home-recording of 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' all being performed at home before Elvis recorded them professionally. For full tracklist see my good friend Keith Flynn Sessions website here

(See earlier details below) Elvis Home-Recording New Bootlegs: From the moment that the new Elvis Home-Recording tapes were discovered and offered for free, EIN could hear the bootleggers' computers whirring into life creating "New" bootlegs CD covers.

It was all so inevitable and a little sad - signs of desperation if anything.

At least THREE bootlegs were announced in the following 24 hours and all sadly opportunistic and basically rip-offs.

Burton is best known for his time playing with Elvis but also with Ricky Nelson's band and his list of accomplishments are too many to name.

The James Burton International Guitar Festival made a huge holiday announcement, they will be putting on a special Christmas concert at Margaritaville in December.

"The James Burton Christmas Concert: Memories of Elvis" show will take place at the Paradise Theater on Saturday December 8th.

Not only will James be on hand to play, but Estelle Brown of the Sweet Inspirations, who toured with Elvis from 1969 until his death in 1977, will preforming as well.

Plus James Burton is teasing about other special guests.

The super group will be performing a Christmas set of some of Elvis' favorite songs plus some classics from the iconic singer as well. Jerry Lee Lewis and Mick Jagger at Sun Studios: Posted yesterday was a photo of the great Jerry Lee Lewis along with Mick Jagger and author Peter Guralnick outside the legendary Sun Studios.

Back in 2013 we reported that director Kevin MacDonald (Last King of Scotland) was on board to direct the Elvis Presley biopic âLast Train to Memphisâ based on the Peter Guralnick biography however the movie has been in development ever since.

The film would chronicle Elvis' early years and his transformation from a high school kid to an overnight sensation credited with ushering in a radical new era in music.

Mick Jagger and Victoria Pearman were announced as produces through their Jagged Films banner. John Fusco was adapting the script.

Since then Jagger produced the sensational biopic about James Brown along with a documentary DVD follow up.

Let's hope this shows that more 'A Little More Action' is happening.

Baz Lurhman has also announced that HIS movie about Elvis is now in production. (see news below)

A man named Max Wiggins from Kemah, TX paid $67,650 â though he said he "would have paid any price for it because it belonged to Elvis" â for the 60 feet long and 12 feet wide mobile home once owned by Elvis and Priscilla. The two bedroom abode had been recently restored to the condition the couple left it in, which included a lavish gold sink and bathtub.

The late King of Rock and Roll and his then wife previously used the mobile home as a vacation getaway and placed it on the 163-acre grounds of their famous Circle G Ranch, which is located 10 miles south of Graceland where they spent part of their honeymoon there after tying the knot in May 1967.

Queen / Adam Lambert cover Elvis: Queen with Adam Lambert kicked off their 3 week Las Vegas residency cleverly including Elvis' Heartbreak Hotel in their set-list.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) 'The Comeback: Elvis And The Story Of The 68 Special' New Book: Out today yet another new book about Elvis' stunning 68 resurrection, 'The Comeback: Elvis And The Story Of The 68 Special' by Simon Goddard - "possibly the most original Elvis book ever written". "A Technicolor drama with scripted dialogue ... a picture, not a lecture."

The publicity notes.. 1968. A year of riots, revolution and world-changing Rock'n'roll. Except for Elvis Presley. The King of the Fifties had become the Clown of the Sixties, churning out bad music in dismal films, a humiliating spectre of his former glory. In the words of the hip young director assigned to his first TV special, Elvis' reputation was "in the toilet." However the same director, Steve Binder, was now about to save it. Together they would embark on the biggest creative fight of Elvis' life. Overcoming insecurity, paranoia, a failing marriage, network censors, drugs, the over-protective Memphis Mafia, the sabotaging whims of manager Colonel Tom Parker and the heat exhaustion of his soon-to-be iconic black leather suit, with his '68 TV Special Elvis gave the defining performance of his career. He never sang harder, rocked wilder or blazed sexier. This was Elvis, The Resurrection.

Hardcover: 256 pages, from Omnibus Press

First review has noted, "Brilliantly written against the backdrop of the Kennedy assassinations, Martin Luther King, The Watts Race Riots and Presley's extremely complicated love life, the book tells how he eventually wrested back control of his career from The Colonel to triumph again."

EIN Nigel notes "Far from everyoneâs 'cup of tea' but a whirlwind ride." - Our full EIN review will be posted soon.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) Two New FTDs for September: FTD is pleased to announce two new releases for this month...

- âElvis: `What Now My Loveâ - a live soundboard released as a 5â double-digipack, this set features Elvis in great form from his legendary Vegas shows in August 1972 at the Hilton Hotel, Las Vegas.

'What Now My Love' consists of the Midnight Shows on August 11 and 12 1972 . Between Madison Square Garden and Aloha From Hawaii, the Elvis Presley Show was at its peak!

Elvis is in top form with both new and old songs in his repertoire, and especially with the addition of 3 great new songs, âWhat Now My Love,â âFeverâ and âMy Way.â In an effort to find the right style for each arrangement, Elvis totally commits himself to each performance.

"ELVIS 68 Comeback Special" Top Cinema Music Event of 2018: The Cinema presentation of ELVIS'Â 'Comeback Special' 50th anniversary was sensational. The great news is that there was such a big fan turnout the 2018 cinema "Comeback Special" was the top performing Fathom music event of 2018 and the top performing music event in cinemas worldwide this year. The event was presented in nearly 700 movie theatres across the U.S. on August 16 and 20. The two-night event attracted more than 70,000 attendees domestically and is estimated to sell more than 165,000 tickets across 1,000 movie theatres internationally.

Both event dates performed in the top 10 at the box office; the first night secured the fourth highest per-screen average attendance and the second night secured the second highest per-screen average attendance.

Each screening included bonus content about the making of the special with audiences taken on a walkthrough of the NBC soundstage with insights from Binder, Priscilla Presley and others.

The short documentary was produced by Spencer Proffer, CEO of Meteor 17, a partner to Fathom and ABG on this successful project.

"Even 50 years after the original premiere of the special, audiences were eager to experience it on the big screen," said Fathom CEO Ray Nutt. "In partnership with ABG and Spencer Proffer, we were able to create a successful campaign creation of new behind-the-scenes content and a promotional screening in New York. Combined, these tactics brought in a whole new generation of Elvis fans."

Diana Goodman recalls passionate love affair: Promoting her new book, Elvis' girlfriend in 1975 Diana Goodman has been publicising her story.

Diana Goodman, the Southern belle who became Miss Georgia USA and would later appear in the popular variety show âHee Haw,â revealed how her life forever changed in the new book âHollywood Lights, Nashville Nights."

Before Goodman made her mark on TV she was involved in a passionate affair with Elvis Presley that ended in heartbreak.

The then-25-year-old first met Elvis shortly after she became Miss Georgia in 1975 and was visiting Memphis on a media trip for the pageant.

In the book, Goodman candidly described how she was easily captivated by the rock ânâ roll icon. And while Presley couldnât resist the blonde beauty from the Deep South, he had specific requirements for his special lady.

âI like long hair,â Elvis allegedly told Goodman. âI like long nails too. But you know what I donât like? Jeans. You see, growing up, we were real poor and the only kind of clothes my mama and daddy could afford to buy me were dungarees, so blue jeans remind me of that, and I donât like thinking about being poor, so Iâd rather see you in something else when weâre together.â

Goodman insisted Presley was an unforgettable lover.

ââ¦ Iâd never felt safer than right there, with Elvis holding me while I trembled like a virgin bride on her honeymoon,â she wrote. ââ¦ He kissed me like he wanted to eat me up, and made love to me like he could never get his fill.â

And while Elvis was âa creature of the night," his days away from the stage were surprisingly ordinary, involving pancakes with along with a generous serving of âThe Price is Right.â

The relationship ultimately came to an end after the singer planned on sending Goodman back home temporarily while he focused on his non-stop schedule without distractions.

Still, Elvis allegedly checked in on Goodman while he was away.

But Elvis ultimately moved on to a new girlfriend, 20-year-old Ginger Alden, who later became his fiancÃ©e.

"Elvis was so larger than life, He was hard to put together. The superman and the reality of him as a human being. Although she knew he was probably killing himself with the unhealthy life he livedâ¦ there was something supernatural about him. So you certainly didnât expect death.â

Goodman claimed there was no sense of closure.

Collingwood Elvis Festival To End?: Could the 25th year be the last for the Canadian Collingwood Elvis Festival? Will Elvis be leaving the building next year?

Collingwoodâs draft parks, recreation and culture master plan, which was presented last week, is calling for the town to âreposition or retireâ the Collingwood Elvis Festival. The town has approved the festival for its 25th year, but not for the 26th.

âWe asked for the mandate to get to the 25th year, because in our minds that seems like an achievement, a goal to set,â said director of parks, recreation and culture Dean Collver.

âPart of it is understanding where the Elvis Festival is in its lifespan. Collver said the recommendation made in the plan will force council to have a discussion about the festivalâs future.

The numbers for the 2018 festival havenât been released but in 2017, the estimated attendance was about 16,760 in 2017. The economic impact to the community was about $1.5 million. The net cost was $124,000.

While its future hasnât been decided yet, a group of Elvis fans are looking to secure its future.

Elena Chisholm has started an online petition calling on the town to continue the event past its 25th year.

âThe Collingwood Elvis Festival is known worldwide. It has brought so much talented ETAs to us and many friendships have been created which we now consider them as the Elvis family.â

Linda Sutherland believes the festival should continue. âIt is a lot of fun and I have met some great people and have become good friends with most of them,â she wrote.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) Lisa Marie's Good Day In Court: Lisa Marie finally had a good day in court when a judge ruled this week that she does not have to pay one single cent to her estranged husband, Michael Lockwood, in their acrimonious divorce.

Last week, Lockwood had argued in court that the post-nuptial agreement that the couple signed in 2007 should be torn up because he didn't read it and his attorney didn't explain it to him. Wow, he sounds like a special kind of stupid. The 2007 agreement simply stated that Lisa Marie would have no rights to Lockwood's property or spousal support and Lockwood would have no rights to Lisa Marie's property or spousal support in the event of a divorce.

L.A. Superior Court Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman ruled: "The Court finds that the post-nuptial agreement signed by the parties November 28, 2007 is valid and enforceable in whole. If Respondent Lockwood elected not to read the post-nup and accept the consequences that it would be upheld, that is also his choice."

In February, Lisa Marie was ordered to pay nearly $100,000 of Lockwood's legal fees. Lockwood's attorney Jeff Sturman, argued that his client had received death threats when he split from Lisa Marie and that she'd turned him into a pariah in the music industry.

The biggest issue in their divorce proceedings was the validity of the post-nuptial agreement. Lisa Marie wanted the post-nup enforced. She claimed Lockwood ran up millions on her credit card. Lockwood wanted the judge to throw the post-nup out on the grounds that he didn't read it before he signed it because it "didn't interest him."

Presley's attorney Gary Fishbein told the court: "I have been doing this for 38 years and I have never heard of anyone asking a court to void an agreement on the basis of saying, 'I didn't read that agreement', following it by saying, 'I wasn't interested in it. Lockwood freely and voluntarily entered into the post-nuptial agreement. He acknowledged that he was not threatened, Miss Presley did not threaten to divorce him if he didn't sign. Mr. Lockwood said that he didn't read a single word of the post-nup because it was not interesting to him. Frankly that is mind-boggling."

In 2006, the year they got married, Lockwood made $245,000 a year as Lisa Marie's musical director. In 2007, the year they signed the post-nup, he made $150,000.

Lockwood tried to claim that Presley hid her wealth from him. However, Lisa Marie's attorney pointed out that a statement of her assets and liabilities was attached to the 2007 post-nup (the one Lockwood could not be bothered to read) and it listed her net worth at the time at $62 million.

Lockwood's attorney told the court that if he doesn't get any money from Presley he'd be living on a poverty level income and be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.

Lisa Marie revealed in court documents that she is $16 million in debt, $10 million of that is back taxes that she owes. In February, she filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against Barry Siegel, her former business manager. She is accusing him of charging her $700,000 a month while losing her $100 million trust fund.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) We need Elvis now more than ever: In this charming article, from US Time magazine, Ace Atkins suggest that the USA needs Elvis now more than ever.

The article 'Memories From the South: In Elvis We Trust' includes...

... Growing up in Georgia and Alabama in the 1970s and â80s, I always felt that the bad old days of Southern prejudice and ignorance had passed, that we were entering a new South built upon hard-won racial equality, charity and the sense that no one was better than anyone else. The country had a long way to go, but if the South had come so far in just a generation, then nothing could stop progress.

Iâm not so sure anymore. Lately, I feel like our moral compass has been broken, spinning to intolerance, greed, hypocrisy and a meanness thatâs as thick as the humidity in July.

In times of trouble, I put my faith in Elvis Presley, who represented the Southâs better angels. He was a hard worker, and although he lived the high life, he never forgot that he had been born into poverty. I donât think youâll ever hear an interview with the man when he didnât express gratitude and humility for all that life had given him.

And he was a self-made talent, perhaps the greatest entertainer of all time, born in a two-room shack in Tupelo, Miss., in 1935. Iâve been to that small shotgun house many times, reflecting on what it says about America. Greatness can be born anywhere.

Elvis was famous for his generosityâultimately to a faultâgiving away cars, expensive gifts and other handouts to anyone who needed a leg up.

The house still looks like a shack. But it was nicer than what many other families in Tupelo, in Mississippi and around the South had in 1935.

Politicians had a hard time demonizing the poor in the 1930s and â40s. That doesnât seem to be the case today. Today demagogues and charlatans court Southern crowds with messages that exalt the rich and powerful and dismiss the poor and marginalized as being somehow deserving of their fate.

I still believe in my heart that most Southerners are still more like Elvis than the President. We are most likely to pull over and help someone stranded on the roadside. Most of the people I know in my Mississippi town would give you the shirt off their backs. Most Southern preachers donât spend Sundays in the pulpit spewing hatred and intolerance. Most people agree that racism and white supremacy are evil. Australia's unique Elvis Presley memorial: It was the world's first memorial erected after Presley's death, but Elvis never visited Melbourne, or even Australia - so what is it doing here?

Wayne Hawthorne is the president of the Elvis Presley Fan Club of Victoria and every year on August 16th he gets up early and heads to the Melbourne General Cemetery to cleanse of "promotional rubbish" the memorial to the singer he commissioned 41 years ago.

"People try to make a buck out of Elvis (with impersonators) but these people have nothing to do with the club who built the monument; they're just trying to make money out of this time of year" says Hawthorne.

The Melbourne General Cemetery has been operational since 1852 and houses prestigious monuments to Malcolm Fraser, Sir Robert Menzies and Burke and Wills. For 100 years, the 36-tonne Burke and Wills monument was the most visited spot in the cemetery - until the Elvis Presley memorial was erected. It's still believed to be the only authorised Elvis Presley memorial outside of the US. But what is it doing in Melbourne?

Hawthorne, who joined the fan club in 1964 and became president in 1971, remembers receiving a phone call out of the blue from an Elvis fan, who suggested that Hawthorne's fan club commission a memorial.

"I said, 'Well excuse me, where do you think we're getting the money from?' and he said, 'That's taken care of. I will pay for it. You arrange it'."

The donor asked to remain anonymous, and provided the funds required to commission prominent stone masons, Giannarelli & Sons. Hawthorne insists that to this day, he's the only one who knows the fan's true identity.

"He didn't want any publicity; he wanted it for Elvis, to tell you the truth, I can't tell you if he's even alive now."

The fan club secured permission from Elvis' father, Vernon, to erect the world's first monument to his son's death, unveiled by "Australia's king of rock", Johnny O'Keefe, on 26 November 1977.

It was erected before even the monument in Memphis, Hawthorne says, and Elvis fans flocked to the Melbourne cemetery.

"The Fan Club wanted a shrine where they could go regularly, play out their grief and show their respects," explains Dr Celestina Sagazio, historian for the Cemeteries Trust. "I see more people in front of Elvis's memorial than anything else ... I've seen people crying in front of it - it's certainly taken seriously."

The perfect storm of mysterious elements came together to create one of the strangest, and rarest, monuments of the world.

"At the time a lot of people didn't even believe that Elvis had died - it was a funny period," Hawthorne says. "It happened so quickly that I sort of take it for granted now. But it was incredible. This was put up basically within three months of Elvis dying. I'm grateful to the gentleman who funded it for the rest of my life."

(News, Source;G/ElvisInfoNet) UPDATED - Keith Alverson 'Strictly Elvis 76-77' Interview: The deluxe hard-back book 'Strictly Elvis: 1976-1977' is the follow up by Keith Alverson and Erik Lorentzen to last year's stunning 'Strictly Elvis Vol 1: 1973-1974 - 1975'.

Keith Alverson first saw Elvis in concert in the early 70s when he secretly smuggled in his small pocket camera to sneak a few photos of Elvis and from there he went from strength to strength. One of his first Elvis' concerts where he was able to get quality photos of Elvis in concert was in Atlanta, July 1973, after which he saw Elvis over 80 times live on stage. Alverson's outstanding photos of Elvis in his "Phoenix" jumpsuits are known by every Elvis fan and it is obvious that the quality of Alverson's photos got better and better as the years went by.

In last year's EIN interview we discovered the background surrounding photographer Keith Alverson as well as how he got to become one of Elvis' most well-known concert photographers.

With Strictly Elvis Volume 2 just published EIN's Piers Beagley tracked down the man - as he packed for Memphis - to ask him more about the last two years of capturing the King in concert....

The book contains over 800 previously unseen photos of Elvis on stage.

We asked him that, as we all know of Elvis' sad decline over these two years, do fans really need to see so many images of an unhealthy Elvis?

on the big video screen and the Stamps quartet on the left and Olivia Newton Johnâs band on the right.

Seeing ELVIS on the Big Screen was a great final night and while it was not as emotional as in the past, when it featured all of Elvisâ TCB original musicians and singers, it was still wonderful. What struck me this week is how old a lot of Elvisâ contemporaries have now become and that so many are missing because they have passed away. How fortunate we all are to have seen them all in previous Elvis Weeks!

Luckily for us for the last 2 songs Ronnie Tutt came on stage and drummed! The crowd exploded with appreciation. What a joy it was to see him back in action and his drumming on âAn American Trilogyâ was a perfect addition and what a finale for the final night. Afterwards we all felt that Elvis had really left the building â for now.

Elvis in UK's Big Issue: UK's 'The Big Issue' last week (the street magazine that helps people in poverty) featured a fine article on Elvis and also puts our man on its cover.

The main article is "Elvis Presley, the '68 Comeback Special and the radical rocker that never was".

The feature includes some comments from Uk's Todd Slaughter.

He notes, "I first went to the States to see Elvis in 1972 and he was fine. His health suffered drastically from 1975. We took the final trip to see Elvis in concert in Cincinnati and Indianapolis in 1977. Our group saw the last two shows Elvis performed.

In the very last CBS Special Elvis in Concert, you can see a man, only 42, who had not fared well. But when you see the film of me and Elvis he's laughing. There was not that horror presented to me at that time. During that last show in Indianapolis, he was on stage for an hour and a half, which was unusual because he usually only did 50 minutes. Elvis included his own hits, pertinent covers and classic rock 'n' roll, and there was a crescendo of gospel which was always a showstopper.

It was a special show. He sang his heart out. Having only seen Elvis on stage in Las Vegas in previous years in front of an audience of 2,000 people the atmosphere was equally electrifying in front of 15,000, and the whole audience erupted when he announced that in the audience there were 250 Brits.

The '68 Comeback Special is Elvis in the raw. Seeing it 1,000 years from now could be rather like finding the Dead Sea Scrolls - but more visual. Elvis did very little television so it really was a special Special."

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) Elvis lived to make people happy, and he himself was happiest when he brought joy to someone else. I wish there was a way all the good he has done with his gifts throughout the world could be measured.

Four decades after his death, Elvis Presley still reigns unchallenged as the King of rock 'n' roll, the greatest superstar the world has ever known.

All the tabloid reporting and ugly rumours can't change the fact that there never was anyone like him and there never will be another again.

The comfort and enjoyment his music still brings to millions every day is impossible to comprehend. His influence as a performer and as a humanitarian has touched untold millions of people. We can never compile exact statistics, but I believe Elvis Presley will forever remain one of the most inspirational and influential men the world will ever know. Elvis was the most extraordinary ordinary man. - Joe Esposito Lisa Marie this week revealed that she still feels a deep closeness to her father 41 years after his death.

âWhen recording the new duet with Elvis' voice playing in my headphones I felt really emotional. Itâs never pleasant to sing and cry. You just canât do that in a good way. I had to keep my composure, but I felt very connected to him and to the song.â

âI wouldnât say I still talk to him â¦ I just remember everything. I can sort of pull out of the files whatever memories I have and stuff like that. And occasionally ask for help. Which was the case with this record. I just felt like a hand come down to me, it felt like that a little bit.â

Lisa Marie still says she feels most comfortable when sheâs upstairs in the living quarters of Graceland by herself.

âI recently discovered a quote by Elvis as I was leaving the new Graceland exhibit, it said something like, âBecoming a father is the best thing thatâs ever happened to me.â I had never seen it before. I knew there was a great love there, there was a really strong connection there since the minute I can remember. "

Elvis died of a heart attack on Aug. 16, 1977, when he was 42 years old. Lisa Marie was just 9 years old at the time of his death Elvis Week 2018: Elvis Week hits the emotional time of remembrance as fans gather for the Candlelight Vigil and EIN's Mandy Squair is there.Â The Candlelight Vigil was tonight from 8.30 marking the 41st anniversary of Elvisâ death. The service at the Graceland gates was first and all out special candles are lit. Then everyone walked up the driveway of Graceland to the Meditation Garden where Elvis is buried. The line of candles up the driveway is very moving. The Elvis Country Fan Club this year selected "Thinking About You" as the theme. They also played the video of Lisa Marie singing her new duet with her father - the gospel song âWhere no one stands aloneâ with all Elvis loving fans gathered together this felt very special. There were not many people this year compared to last year and everyone was through the gates by 10.15 pm.

(ElvisWeek, Source;MandySquair/ElvisInfoNet) Aretha Franklin Had Died, August 16, 2018: Aretha Franklin who was born in Memphis has coincidentally died on August 16th at home in Detroit. She was 76.

Aretha Franklin became a singing legend and in the mid-sixties was crowned the Queen of Soul, selling 75 million records and inspiring generations.

Franklin died on Thursday at 9:50am at her home in Detroit surrounded by family and loved ones.

Franklin was known for her powerful voice and for many hits, including Respect, (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, Chain of Fools and Think.

Elvis had several of Franklin's albums in his own record collection, including 1972's 'The Gospel Soul Of Aretha Franklin'

Elvis' backing group The Sweet Inspirations sang backing vocals on many of Aretha Franklin's hits including the stunning (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman and Chain of Fools.

Franklin won 18 Grammy Awards and became the first female performer inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Musicians around the world have made emotional tributes to Aretha Franklin, the âqueen of soulâ.

Lady Gaga wrote that Franklin was an âangel of musicâ.

Elton John called her death âa blow for everybody who loves real music: Music from the heart, the soul and the Church. Her voice was unique, her piano playing underrated â she was one of my favourite pianists.â

Cher said Franklinâs âone of a kind voice will be with us foreverâ.

Paul McCartney called her âthe Queen of our soulsâ and said âthe memory of her greatness as a musician and a fine human being will live with us forever.â

Willie Nelson said "Whether it was Gospel, Blues, Jazz, R&B, Pop,or Civil Rights, Aretha Franklin was the greatest gift and the voice of a generation. She could turn any song into a hymn. She will be greatly missed here on earth, but that band in heaven just got our Angel"

RIP Aretha FranklinÂ 25 March 1942 - 16 August 2018

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) There have been a number of variations of the special over the years, and this one is new to me. One thing that surprised me is that the âTroubleâ / âGuitar Manâ opening is followed by âThatâs All Right, Mamaâ from one of the sitdown shows.

Other surprises include âTrying To Get To Youâ and âWhen My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Againâ from the sitdown shows, as well as âBaby What You Want Me To Doâ from one of the standup shows.

Even though I have seen this special numerous times over the years, I was once again blown away by Elvisâ talent and charisma. This special showcases him at his best, and this edit works especially well. I really hope that we will get this on Blu-Ray, as per the rumor.

One minor disappointment is that the first part of âOne Nightâ is missing.

The âLet Yourself Goâ scene works better on the big screen than on television, and the body language between Elvis and Susan Henning leaves little to the imagination. On the other hand, the âIt Hurts Meâ scene with the fight sequence still feels a bit hokey, and is actually reminiscent of Elvisâ poorer films.

Elvisâ voice sounds so powerful throughout the special, but never more so than on âIf I Can Dreamâ. Itâs a very fitting conclusion to the special.

Instead of the usual closing credits with Elvis playing âfakeâ guitar on an instrumental âLet Yourself Goâ, we get âA Little Less Conversationâ and new production credits.

I know that some of you are curious about the quality of the footage and the audio. What is important to remember is that the special was made for television 50 years ago, and not for the big screen. Since then, the footage has been stored on videotape, which obviously has some serious limitations. With all of that in mind, I was very impressed with what I saw. The â68 Comeback Special has never looked nor sounded better. Clearly, a lot of effort went into the transfers, and it looks like they went back to the original masters to get the best quality.

Following the special, we get a 10-minute âHaving fun with Elvis at Burbankâ, which is an entertaining and well-edited compilation of outtakes & cool moments from the recording of the special. A nice surprise, and one that I for one didnât expect.

Itâs clear that everybody involved really went to town to make this screening something memorable for the fans, and this is also a great showcase for Elvisâ enduring talent and charisma.

Go out and see this, and bring a friend. You wonât regret it.

Kevan Budd contacted Graceland auction for a sample from the acetate and was surprised by discovering a never-before heard false-start for "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone" .

The ever vigilant Kevan Budd has informed Ernst Jorgensen, although where and when this might be officially released is anyone's guess.

The SUN Acetates ended up selling for $3,625.

The pair of Sun Records acetates were recordings for Sun Records 216 and the side B songs from Sun 217.

Sun 217 is the Elvis Presley single release for "Baby Let's Play House" (matrix 143) and side B "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone" (matrix U-142) which was Elvis' fourth single release of five with Sun Records. "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone" was recorded in March 1955 and the single with "Baby Let's Play House" was released in April 1955.

(News, Source;EPE/ElvisInfoNet) 'The Steve Allen Show' EIN Spotlight: Much has been written about The Steve Allen Show appearance over the years and with each retelling of the story, much of the information required to give a fair hearing to Allen is conspicuous by its absence. Recent articles in ETMHM as well as Elvis Files magazine still repeat the usual story.

But was Steve Allen really the rock'n'roll hating villain as usually portrayed in the Elvis story?

In the past, this might have been done because some of the information was not available, but with the appearance of online newspaper and magazine archives over the last decade it is much easier to piece together the complete story rather than the fragments of it that have been passed down amongst Elvis fans over the last sixty years.

After all, alongside Parker, Allen has become the second of the pantomime villains in the Elvis story, and it is time to investigate anew in order to see what really happened, and what Allenâs real relationship with rock ânâ roll was.

In this fascinating new article, EIN contributor Shane Brown investigates the truth behind ELVIS on the Steve Allen show...

'Orgies and Orgasms:Â Presley in the Press 1956'- an in-depth Spotlight: By the beginning of 1956, everything was in place for Elvis Presley to burst onto the national and international music scene. Within weeks of his signing to major label RCA he would record Heartbreak Hotel, his first single for RCA and his first to reach number 1 in the U.S. charts, and then, at the end of January 1956, he would appear on national television for the first time.

Despite all of the success that 1956 would bring Elvis, with three singles and two albums reaching the top spot in the U.S. charts, the year would also prove to be a difficult one when it came to his treatment in the national and international press.

Mainstream media published reviews such as...

"Every girl watching him sees herself as Elvisâ partner in his fantastic writhing orgy"

and "Presley is suggesting he is about to have a self-induced orgasm!"

So, letâs go back in time and examine how a single television performance in June 1956 resulted in a change of attitudes towards Elvis within the media from little more than curiosity about the new phenomenon to downright hostility and revulsion.

Go here as EIN contributor Shane Brown investigates the phenomenon of Elvis in 1956 - and what the media made of this new, and middle-America shocking, entertainer.

(Spotlight, Source;ShaneBrown/ElvisInformationNetwork) Baz Luhrmann ELVIS Movie: Elvis Presley's life and career are set to be the topic in a new movie directed by Baz Luhrmann, the celebrated director behind âRomeo + Julietâ, âMoulin Rougeâ and âThe Great Gatsby.â

The project was started way back in 2014 but a production start date has now been confirmed.

With Elvis' unique flamboyant style, sensual croon and iconic outfits, itâs now his turn to be the subject of a major biopic, after figures like Whitney Houston and Freddie Mercury.

Australian director Baz Luhrmann will also write the movie, taking over from previous scriptwriters Kelly Marcel (see below) and Jeremy Donner.

Although no plot details have been released, we know that the movie will be split into two parts â his early success aged 20, and his career from the age of 35.

Two actors (names not yet revealed) have been cast by Kristy Carlson to play the King in these two different eras. Production begins in March 2019.

It was back in May 2014 that EIN first reported that Baz Luhrmann was in negotiations to direct an Elvis Presley biopic at the time being written by Kelly Marcel ('Saving Mr. Banks'). Warner Bros were behind the project and had reportedly scored the rights to Elvis' extensive music catalogue. In 2014 the script was supposedly finished.

Luhrmann at the time promised an "extravagant but truthful" retelling of these years in an as-yet uncast and untitled film for Warner Bros, it WAS due out in 2016. And in April this year Luhrmann was in the news as weighing up which of two projects (a âChinese-yâ western) or the Elvis movie to begin first.

Now it seems Luhrmann's Elvis movie is finally on.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) Steve Binder revisits Elvis â68 Comeback Special: Rolling Stone has a feature on director Steve Binder looking back, as the concert film makes its way into theaters for a special re-release.

The article includes... When Elvis Presley was filming the intro to his fabled ââ68 Comeback Special,â the programâs director had an unusual problem. âI ended up having too many Elvises in the background,â filmmaker Steve Binder tells Rolling Stone. âI hate to fire anybody, so I decided to use them all. We were afraid the scaffold was not gonna hold the weight. We were sure we were gonna have a major lawsuit if it collapsed.â

Today, the image of the King, flanked by dozens of Elvises and wearing black clothing and a tough look on his face, has become iconic. The special, known then simply as "Elvis" relaunched his singing career and proved that, after nearly a decade of making movies, he was still one of the most thrilling performers around. Now Binder is hoping the film reaches a new audience when the special gets a theatrical release this month to mark its 50th anniversary.

Binder says that part of the reason the special was such a success was because he was able to put Presley at ease. Leading up to the show, the King was nervous so Binder made it so that Presley didnât have to think about much more than performing. âMy biggest contribution was saying, âElvis, you just make an album and Iâll put pictures to it, and I donât want you to be aware of where the cameras are,'â he says. âWith television concerts up to that point, you put a piece of tape on the floor and told the artist to stand there, and you shot it all from the front. I was determined to make it like a real concert and three-dimensional.â He also worked with his production staff to make Elvis look larger than life, dressing him in bespoke costumes and erecting the giant E-L-V-I-S sign behind him (taking inspiration from The Judy Garland Show).

When they were rehearsing, Presley asked to move into the studio to shorten his commute. âHe said, âMaybe if I get a dressing room big enough, I can put a bed in there,'â Binder recalls with a laugh. âThatâs what we did, and that was the reason I did the acoustic improv sequence. Every day after rehearsal or taping, he would go into the dressing room, and here was this incredible performer who was totally relaxed, all mussed up, having fun and sharing stories with everybody.â He brought the idea to the Colonel who stuck his nose up at it but eventually relented, leading to a memorable summit of Presleyâs friends and early collaborators, like Fontana. It was loose and fun, it showed off the Kingâs sense of humor and it allowed him to cut loose on âHound Dog,â âLawdy Miss Clawdyâ and âCanât Help Falling in Love.â âI knew it was really the heart and soul of the show,â Binder says.

Ultimately, Binder ended up with too much good material and went rogue, cutting his own 90-minute version of the special and begging NBC to expand it from an hour-long broadcast. At the time, the execs said no, but after Presleyâs death, they ran the longer cut that is now the best-known version. The special would subsequently become one of the Kingâs defining moments.

When he thinks back on the struggles he faced to make it, Binder is especially happy about the specialâs longevity. âI did it in 1968 and thought it was gonna air one time for 48 minutes and that was the end of it. So Iâm thrilled itâll come back 50 years later.â

Go HERE to Rolling Stone for the full article.

The article includes a 3 minute preview of the special feature that will accompany the Cinema screenings.

'Elvis: Ohama, Nebraska '74' FTD in-depth Review: This FTD double-pack features two concerts from Elvisâ third tour of 1974, both performances from Omaha on June 30 1974. It was the first time Elvis had played Ohama, Nebraska since 1956 and it was the penultimate city on this 25 performance tour. Elvis played three shows over two days, and a six week holiday was in sight.

Elvis was in a fine mood, did he really...

- Announce that he wasÂ âJimmy Deanâ âIâm here to sell some Pork Sausagesâ?

- Joke that his first movie was 1972 porn flick âBehind the Green Doorâ?

- Start singing âWhat a friend we have in Jesusâ?

. . . . . You bet he did!

.. Groundbreaking New Elvis Album features 14 Original Performances of Gospel Songs with Newly-Recorded Instrumentation and Backing Vocals featuring Legendary Presley Alumnae including Darlene Love, Cissy Houston, The Imperials and The Stamps

RCA/Legacy Recordings will release "Elvis Presley - Where No One Stands Alone," a new Elvis album celebrating the artist's everlasting love of gospel music, on Friday, August 10.

Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and Andy Childs, "Where No One Stands Alone" introduces newly-recorded instrumentation and backing vocal contributions from music legends who'd performed on-stage and/or in-the-studio with Elvis. It also includes a reimagined duet with Elvis and his daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, on the album's title track and spiritual touchstone.

"It was a very powerful and moving experience to sing with my father," wrote Lisa Marie in her notes for the album. "The lyrics speak to me and touch my soul. I'm certain that the lyrics spoke to my father in much the same way."

beloved enduring gospel classics (the 1965 Top 5 smash "Crying In The Chapel," "How Great Thou Art," "You'll Never Walk Alone"), praise-filled gospel-rockers (Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller's "Saved") and traditional hymns and spirituals ("So High," "Stand By Me," "In The Garden," "Amazing Grace").

Elvis Presley once said, "Since I was two years old, all I knew was gospel music. It became such a part of my life, it was as natural as dancing. A way to escape my problems, and my way of release." It was Elvis'

explosive mix of styles--blues, bluegrass, country, swing, pop--that generated his iconic world-changing rock n' roll, but it was the hymns, spirituals and church music of his childhood, the deep-seated gospel roots that sustained Elvis and his musical vision throughout his life.

Friends and family would often recall hearing Elvis sing gospel tunes at home and to warm up before concerts. "We do two shows a night for five weeks," Presley said in an interview featured in the documentary 'Elvis On Tour' "A lotta times we'll go upstairs and sing until daylight-gospel songs. We grew up with it... It more or less puts your mind at ease. It does mine."

Lisa Marie states in the album notes, "This was his favorite genre - no question about it. He seemed to be at his most passionate, and at peace while singing gospel. He would truly come alive - whether he was singing just for himself and me at home, or on stage in front of thousands of fans."

TrackList 1. I've Got Confidence 2. Where No One Stands Alone (with Lisa Marie Presley) 3. Saved 4. Crying In The Chapel 5. So High 6. Stand By Me 7. Bosom Of Abraham 8. How Great Thou Art 9.

(News, Source;ElvisInfoNet) DJ Fontana Obituary and Interview: D.J. Fontana was born in Shreveport Louisiana on March 15 1931 and originally began backing Elvis Presley, Bill Black and Scotty Moore when he worked at the Louisiana Hayride as early as 1954. By his early 20s he performed at strip joints and spent enough time around the âHayrideâ that he was hired full time. Sun Records Sam Phillips originally assembled Elvis' Blue Moon Boys without a drummer and so it wasn't until the key RCA session of January 10 1956 that DJ Fontana joined the band on studio recordings.

That session produced 'Heartbreak Hotel' and the music world would never be the same.

EIN presents a spotlight on DJ Fontana along with a new interview âI Tell You What, He Loved Gospel Musicâ by EIN contributor Thomas Melin.

While DJ Fontana created some of the greatest rock'n'roll drumming ever cut on wax he always stated that he liked to "keep things simple" in a way that complemented not just Elvis, but also his other band-mates.

Go here as EIN pay their respects to the charming DJ Fontana.

(Spotlight, Source;ElvisInformationNetwork) D.J. Fontana Has Died aged 87: EIN has terrible news as DJ Fontana, Elvis' legendary drummer, has died aged 87.

The last of the 'Blue Moon Boys' has now left to join his fellow musicians - the creators of the Rock'n'Roll big-bang.

Dominic Joseph Fontana passed away in his sleep last night.

His son David Fontana, wrote: âMy dad passed away in his sleep at 9:33 tonight June 13. He was very comfortable with no pain. We ask for privacy at this time. Thank you for your love and prayers.â

Fontana, who was born in Shreveport Louisiana on March 15 1931, originally began backing Elvis Presley, Bill Black and Scotty Moore when he worked at the Louisiana Hayride as early as 1954.

Sun Records Sam Phillips originally assembled Elvis' Blue Moon Boys without a drummer and so it wasn't until the key RCA session of January 10 1956 that DJ Fontana joined the band on recordings.

That session produced 'Heartbreak Hotel' and the music world would never be the same.

Fontana's key input would be his solid beat creating the stunning impact on songs such as 'Hound Dog' and 'Jailhouse Rock'.

Elvis, Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana continued to play and record together throughout the 1960s.

D.J Fontana Interview: D.J Fontana was Elvis' drummer from 1955 to 1969. Elvis first met Fontana when he appeared at the 'Louisiana Hayride' on October 16, 1954. In fact Fontana became the first person to play drums on the 'Louisiana Hayride' doing so behind a curtain since percussion accompaniment to "real" Country Music was still frowned upon. After joining Elvis' band Fontana played drums on around fifty Elvis recording sessions between 1956 and 1968. After 1969 Fontana became a session musician in Nashville. Fontana also appeared in several Elvis movies such as Loving You and Jailhouse Rock.

Earlier this year D.J. Fontana was still on the road performing in Crowley, Louisiana where he talked about his time with The King.

And in 1998 DJ Fontana was interviewed by EIN contributor Arjan Deelen.

UPDATED - COME ON FTD! Let's Speed Things Up A Little!: EIN has very strongly supported the FTD label from the start even though their quality control has slipped at times.

Recently this seems to have got worse, perhaps due to the producers Ernst Jorgensen and Roger Semon's extra work with mainstream SONY releases.

The last couple of FTD live soundboards have notably run slow dragging down the pace of Elvis' performance. This has also been an issue on some previous concert releases.

On ELVIS LAS VEGAS '74' FTD the dates were wrong with the two shows reversed from what the cover indicated.

Do FTD collectors deserve better or should we be happy to have anything released with faults and all?

(Spotlight, Source;ShaneB/ElvisInformationNetwork) âBicycle Rider: Thoughts on The Searcherâ: One of EINâs most insightful contributors George Smith has written a stunning essay on the new HBO documentary âElvis Presley: The Searcherâ.

In his review âGeorge Smithâ captures the essence of the narrative, Zimnyâs production decisions and notes the difficulty of having to create a documentary about Elvisâ music and having to keep it under 4 hours.

His review includes,Â Â Â

âThe genius of the documentary though, is in its decision to present Elvis Presley to all viewers in a new and unexpected fashion. For the devotees this is realised through the constant use of new film (professional and amateur) and studio outtakes: it keeps the faithful on their toes and creates the impression of seeing and hearing Elvis anew. This is why Zimny insisted on using the alternative Aloha, the handheld âTrilogyâ and âNever Been to Spainâ, the âBurning Loveâ rehearsal, the âIf I Can Dreamâ outtake, the off-air segments from â68, the non-masters of âLonely Manâ, âHurtâ, âSuspicious Mindsâ, âLoving Youâ.. It is a deliberate and clever approach which was much appreciated by this writer.â

FTD will NOT end in 2019:Â A fair number of uninformed supposed Elvis "insiders" (even some Fan Club Presidents) have been publishing fictional stories that the FTD label is planning to close in 2019.

Ernst Jorgensen had strongly denied this story stating, that FTD has plans to continue for the foreseeable future.

In an interesting interview about 'The Future of FTD' - with Trevor Cajiao in the recent ETM&HM magazine - Ernst Jorgensen's main points were....

1. FTD will not be closing in 2019

2. The 'Classic Albums" series is nearly complete but there are more to come, noting 'Aloha' and 'Madison Square Garden' are still to be done.

3. Expanded "complete session tapes" releases are being considered

4. Plenty more soundboards to come

To read the complete story including answers about FTD deletions and other future ideas please read the December issue of ETM&HM.

UPDATED - Trying To Get To You: The Truth Behind The Elvis And Roy Orbison Show Rumours: For decades there has always been an unsubstantiated rumour that Elvis Presley appeared as a guest on Roy Orbison's TV show on the local station KOSA.

The Roy Orbison website notes that both Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley performed on Royâs TV show in late 1955.

Respected author Colin Escott wrote in his book Good Rockinâ Tonight about a kinescope of Elvis on the Roy Orbison TV show actually existing.

Some keen Elvis fans have said that they have seen this very kinescope at Elvis Week shows back in the 80s.

But like infamous Pied Piper of Cleveland does this footage really exist and is there any real proof that Elvis did appear on the Roy Orbison TV show?

Shane Brown (author of Reconsider Baby: Elvis: A Listener's Guide) has done an immense amount of investigation and thinks he has found the answer.

Go here as EIN contributor & author Shane Brown investigates and checks the facts and the fantasy.

(Spotlight; Source;SBrown/ElvisInformationNetwork) 'Elvis:The Last Movies' FTD in-depth Review: Charro!, The trouble with girls, Change Of Habit, finally Elvisâ last soundtrack recordings are brought together in a cohesive release that works as a companion set for the FTD 7â Classic Album series.

âThe Last Moviesâ contains outtakes and an informative illustrated 16-page booklet with rare memorabilia and photos.

In this period Elvis' voice had matured and the sound of â68/â69 was a great musical turning point for Elvis with the NBC TV special and the Memphis sessions. While some of the movie compositions were not as good as he deserved, with Elvis sounding vocally great at this time what does this new Classic Soundtrack have to offer?

The one disc contains previously unreleased material, including "rough mixes" and also multiple outtakes from 'The Trouble With Girls' 'Almost' session.

UPDATED - 'ELVIS: That's The Way It Was & This Is How It Is Today': Elvis is no longer with us but his spirit lives forever. Elvis fans always discover something quite magical when they get the chance to âWalk-a-mile-in-his-shoesâ. Graceland, when not overrun by crowds, feels very special indeed. Standing in the quiet you can almost feel the spirit of Elvis still inhabiting his home. The feeling in Memphisâ Sun Studios can bring fans to tears.

One of the places that Elvis spent a large part of his life is the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel â now the Westgate. Elvis performed a stunning 636 concerts in the Hilton showroom and the impact of his incredible legacy can still be felt. - NOW with more great Hilton photos - plus EIN Readers Feedback.

Arjan Deelen recently returned to the classic hotel to investigate âElvis Hotspotsâ andÂ discovered that behind the showroom stage it is relatively unchanged.

UPDATED - 'ELVIS Christmas with the RPO' CD Review: The new Christmas album supposedly brings together the legendâs yuletide performances from his 1957 Christmas Album and Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas from 1971, re-imagined with new arrangements performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

It's the third album of orchestral re-workings of tracks performed by Elvis, following 2016's The Wonder Of You and 2015's If I Can Dream both reached Number 1 on the Official UK Albums Chart.

But can producers Nick Patrick, Don Reedman and Priscilla Presley really keeping milking the money-making Elvis cow or will they turn out an overdone Christmas turkey?

Do the "new" Producers even care about Elvis' fabulous musical legacy?

Go here as EIN's Piers Beagley and Brittany Edwards go into the Listening Booth to cause "Double-trouble" and try and discover what's good and bad...

'Roustabout' FTD Soundtrack Review: Roustabout was Elvis' 16th movie, it had been five months since Elvisâ last album session and his publishers had a chance to secure soundtrack material from a variety of composers. Eleven songs were needed and while the carnival theme stopped most of them having any inspired lyrics, at least the composers Leiber / Stoller and Otis Blackwell were included in the selection.
