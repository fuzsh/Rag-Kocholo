Tracks were taken from tapes circulating among traders: \"Do You Remember?\" from 1980 \"Savage Young Du\" demo; \"Drug Party\" #1 from 21 Jun 1985 Patio (Indianapolis) show; \"Drug Party\" #2 from 10 Mar 1984 Vig's (Madison) show; \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\" from Dec 1986 WB promo. \"Do You Remember?\" has since been released in much more listenable form on Everything Falls Apart And More. Artwork sleeve is heavy paper, single sheet folded once. Plain white inner sleeve. This issue came with a paper insert, as shown on the artwork page. Vinyl is a small-hole 7\", recorded at 33 RPM. There are inscriptions etched in the runout areas of each side: (A) \"What is it?\" (with quotes) has been scratched out and replaced with \"What it is\" (no quotes); (B) \"Spot I hear a radio.\" Contents: (A) Do You Remember?

Location: See above Recording Quality: B- Time: 15 min Notes: Italian red vinyl counterfeit of US boot. No insert Some copies came with white inner sleeve. 45 RPM. Careful examination of 7-11 photo on sleeve shows it clearly to be a 2nd-generation halftone (dots are clumped). See comparison images on artwork page. Blue graphics are slightly misregistered. Label is solid black and entirely blank. Runout inscriptions merely read \"H-DU A\" and \"H-DU B\". Serial numbers appear to have been handwritten after the sleeve was printed, and research confirms that they differ from copy to copy. No confirmation that the pressing ran to 500 copies as indicated on the sleeve.

Album cover is a pretty good counterfeit, but the extra tracks listed on the back are a dead giveaway. Poorly photocopied lyric sheet from EFA included. \"Statues\" and \"Amusement\" are listed in reverse order on the sleeve. \"What Do I Want?\" is listed as the second-to-last track but does not appear on the record.

It has been described as a recording of a 1989 New York City performance, but a tape purportedly made from it is clearly heard to be the Cabaret Metro show from the above date, minus \"Brasilia.\" On the tape version at least, the last song is truncated. It's conceivable that the WXRT tape was aired in New York, which could possibly account for the confusion in provenance.

Recording Quality: Unknown Time: Unknown Notes: German counterfeit. This may be Whyno 123464 listed above, but that number appears nowhere on the sleeve or record. In fact the sleeve is a near-perfect copy of the original, except that it is printed in solid black on white instead of black and green on white. The record itself bears a blank label with only \"HD-1\" and \"HD-2\" inscribed in the runout areas of the respective sides. Price tag on the sleeve reads DM 24.50 (about $16.90 US).

Inlay artwork (a concert shot with Bob Mould prominent in the foreground) appears to be a screen capture from the Makes No Sense... video.

Has different picture insert, taken from Warehouse photo sessions, and different artwork on disk itself. Otherwise the two appear to be the same, as the number on the disk is the same in both cases and \"I Apologize\" skips in the same spot on both CDs. The individual track times vary slightly. The track anomalies cited above regarding \"Celebrated Summer\" and \"Folklore\" are present in this case as well. If that's not sufficient evidence, both disks bear the holographic number WIZARD A 0321 Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail.

The Hüsker songs, inexplicably identified as \"Shut Up And Kill Yourself\" and \"Do The Body Strut,\" are listed as track 4 on the inlay but play as tracks 7 and 8. The disk itself was manufactured in Korea according to the holographic inscription, which also bears the number \"HAC-9217 T102-14301.\" The Amusement 7\" sleeve is one of 4 pictured on the inlay.

Recording Quality: A Time: Notes: Another Mark Corner effort. Taken from BBC Mark Goodier sessions (first air 24 Aug 1992). \"Where Diamonds Are Halos\" is erroneously listed as \"Every Little Bit Helps\" on the picture sleeve. Every track except \"Hoover Dam\" is available legitimately elsewhere. There is some uncertainty about the total number of tracks of tracks actually recorded for the Goodier Sessions, as well as the number of airings. Selling price ranges from $4-10.

Disques Catalog Number: SPIN01 [France release] Date Recorded: 28 Aug 1985 Release Date: Early 1993 Location: 1st Ave, Minneapolis Recording Quality: A- Time: 51 min Notes: Here it is again. Could this be a 12\" made from the CD that was made from another 12\"? \"Folklore\" is again omitted, but the extraneous listing of \"Celebrated Summer\" is not present. Nice color photo of band on cover, taken from Warehouse tourbook. Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail. Contents: [Identical to the \"Lynndale\" LP above] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Artist: Hüsker Dü Title: Live in Boston 1986 Medium: CD Label: None Catalog Number: HUDUCD93 Date Recorded: 28 Aug 1985 Release Date: Early 1993 Location: 1st Ave, Minneapolis Recording Quality: B+ Time: 50:47 Notes: Matrix number shown only on disk, not on inlay. \"Folklore\" appended to track 6 as with the Lynndale clones above. This disk bears a different holographic number, however (HUDUCD93). What's a bootlegger to do when the same old Spin show has been repackaged so many times that everyone who's ever going to buy a copy already has one? Why not stoop to deliberate deception? As a possibly intentional clue to this item's bogosity, the inlay photo depicts a street in what looks suspiciously more like Manhattan than Boston. Caveat emptor. CD was \"reissued\" in 1997 with different artwork. Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail.

Recording Quality: A Time: 69:30 min Notes: Recording of concert at U4 in Vienna that was broadcast a day or two later on Die Musicbox, a program on FM station Ö3 that showcased music by indie/underground artists of the day. Hence the statement in the liner notes that the set was \"Recorded live in the studio during 1989 for German radio\" is somewhat off the mark. It's also pretty obvious from the audience noise level that the recording was made in a good-sized venue. Fine- sounding and nicely-packaged CD with full-color front and back inlays featuring photos of Bob Mould.

Recording Quality: A Time: 69:20 min Notes: This is identical in program content to the Live In Europe boot. Packaging is different: front inlay is the Workbook cover with \"Alive on Radio\" stamped in gold or black on it; back inlay features the Black Sheets back cover photo of Bob looking very punk in shorts and Docs; disk artwork is also different, bearing the title \"Live over Europe.\" The first two songs are combined onto a single track, and the first six and a half minutes of the track labeled \"All Those People Know\" is a jammy continuation of \"Whichever Way The Wind Blows\" followed by a pre-encore interlude before the named song begins. Recording qquality is pretty good, but Bob's voice is a bit hoarse.

Contents: Unknown ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Artist: Sugar Title: On The Edge Format: 12\" Label: Iron Records Catalog Number: RLP 19 [UK release] Date Recorded: 02 Oct 1992 Release Date: 1993? Location: Pavilion, Brighton UK Recording Quality: B Time: 55 min Notes: Album sleeve proclaims \"For radio station use only. Not for sale.\" Rationale for the title is unclear, but may be an attempt to pass the item off as a legitimate radio show (it's the name of a syndicated US radio program). Record label features a reproduction of part of a UK 1-kg sugar package. The recording sounds as if it's been made from an audience tape, and the pressing itself is a bit noisy. \"After All The Roads Have Led To Nowhere,\" \"Frustration,\" \"Tilted,\" \"Sapphire Capital\" and \"The Beer Commercial\" are all listed on the cover as \"unknown.\" \"Anyone\" is listed as \"If I Didn't Want You\" and \"Clownmaster\" is listed as \"Instrumental.\" Running time is about 55 minutes, as the opening few songs of the set are not present. Front cover is black with small (~1.5\" square) negative photo of Bob Mould with guitar in the center; title appears beneath the photo. Back cover features a vertically stretched photo of the three band members and the track listing (with errors as described above). The sleeve notes say only that this is a live recording from the 1992 UK tour, but direct comparison to a tape of the Pavilion show provides conclusive evidence of the date/venue.

There's a photo of Bob on the disk itself. The 8-page insert booklet includes the same photo, a photo of the entire band, a KTS catalog, and off-the-wall liner notes in slightly fractured English by \"Professor Stone.\" A recording of the WXRT FM broadcast of this show was apparently used as the master for this disk, as there are occasional RFI-type glitches. As usual, there are plenty of mistakes in the track listing: \"The Act We Act\" is listed as \"The Act We Follow;\" \"Running Out Of Time\" is \"Time;\" \"Where Diamonds Are Halos\" is \"Every Little Bit Helps;\" \"Armenia City In The Sky\" is simply \"Armenia City\" and a single track containing \"Slick,\" \"Clownmaster\" and \"Tilted\" is listed as \"Medley: Slick/Come Around.\" This CD sells in the US for $20-25.

Beginning of \"I Don't Know For Sure\" is missing and the track fades in. Vinyl pops audible. Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail.

Mastered from a low-gen copy of the audience tape Chuck Erb recorded on his DAT Walkman, complete with shifting soundstage and somewhat brittle midrange. The guitar is very low in the mix, but that was the fault of the soundboard guy. Five songs were cut out between \"Clownmaster\" and \"The Slim\" due to CD time limitations. Omitted are \"The Right Words\" and the first four songs of Beaster (then simply called 1-2-3-4 and referred to collectively as the \"Jesus Christ Cycle\"). Front inlay features a band photo from the time of the \"Helpless\" promo video and back inlay has a photo taken during the spring 1993 tour. Tracks misidentified on the inlay: \"Clownmaster\" is called \"Beaster\" and Mike Nesmith's \"The Door Into Summer\" is called \"Penny Whistle Band.\" This version of \"Clownmaster\" has lyrics. CD selling price is in the US$20 range.

Records Catalog Number: DYRR001 [UK?] Date Recorded: 27 Apr 1987 Release Date: Nov 1993 Location: Fox Studios, Hollywood Recording Quality: B- Notes: Clear red-orange vinyl with black & white picture sleeve. Band photo dates to well before the Warehouse era (looks to be from about 1982 or 1983). Joan Rivers' intros are present at the start of each track, but the interview segment is absent. Hüsker Du is identified on the sleeve, but the label credits \"Bob Hart-Norton,\" a typical display of bootlegger cutesiness. Sound quality is strictly lo-fi mono, decidedly unpleasant. Typical price = UK£4-5.

The ULU tracks sound as if they came from an audience tape.

The most obvious indicator (of many) is Bob's intro: \"The next one is called 'If You're True.' It's not on the album; please listen to it.\" There may have been a NYC rebroadcast of this, which could account for the venue error. The front inlay is blue with an amateurishly-rendered drawing of a diver whose helmet has eight hoses attached to it. Rear inlay says \"all songs written by Bob Mould,\" a statement whose 89% accuracy is about as close to perfection as bootleggers get. The disk itself is inscribed: \"Rocks. A trademark of ROCKDREAMS S.A.R.L Luxembourg\" and bears a 1993 copyright. The sound is muddy and the speed is off (runs fast). For some reason, both \"Brasilia\" and \"See A Little Light\" were edited out. Considering that there are tapes of this performance that are not only complete but much better sounding, this is a disappointing effort. List price is about $25, way too high.

It sounds as if some sort of digital processing has been applied in an attempt to reduce the tape hiss. The first \"One Step At A Time\" is omitted from the track listing and the second occurrence is mistitled \"Monday Will Never Be The Same\" (this was probably intentional, because it's clear that the people behind this had access to an accurate track listing). Grant's untitled piano noodling is arbitrarily assigned the title \"Granted\" and his remarks at the end of the song have been cut. Several of the best tracks were left off the CD altogether, including the terrific version of \"Somewhere\" with the additional guitar overdub. These omissions were almost certainly made to keep the total time under 60 minutes to save costs. The holo data on the inner circumference of the disc has been deliberately scratched out, but enough remains to indicate that this was produced in the US. The packaging is shoddy, monochrome inserts with a motif of traditional Chinese art; the inner pages are blank. The disk itself is devoid of artwork except for the legend \"Side A.\" Selling price in the Boston area was about $14 at the time this was released, but it's long out of print.

The liner notes state, \"No one knows where [the performance] was recorded, and perhaps this is fitting.\" Fitting or not, and notwithstanding a story about this being stolen from the soundboard at an Albany NY show, direct A-B comparison to an audience tape of the Town & Country show confirms the date and venue listed above. \"Hare Krsna\" (which, it's almost frightening to note, is actually spelled correctly in the track listing) is a throw-in from the Warner Bros Do You Remember promo CD. The sound is occasionally muddy and the midrange is a little weak, but overall this is a good-sounding CD. KTS did a nice job on the silk-screening of the disk artwork, which is a photo of Bob standing with the flying vee.

It sounds as if some signal processing has been applied in an effort to clean up the sound, with okay results. A few tracks are commercially available, if rare. \"Erase Today\" is listed as \"Friends.\" \"Sore Eyes\" is listed as \"It's Alright\" and categorized, along with \"Do You Remember,\" as a Warehouse outtake. \"All Work And No Play\" is listed as \"Instro\" and is the rough mix with no vocal track. \"Misty Modern Days\" is also listed as \"Instro,\" and \"Just Be\" is listed as \"Outtake.\" \"You Can Live At Home\" is listed as \"You Can Leave\" and is the rough mix with just the backing vox.

As with the Spin! Disque vinyl boot above, this record appears to have been pressed from one of the Lynndale-clone boot CDs; as seen before, \"Celebrated Summer\" is erroneously listed and \"Folklore\" is omitted. No way to date this thing. Disk labels just say \"A\" and \"B\" in artsy lettering. Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail.

Recording Quality: B+ Notes: Counterfeit \"limited Edition\" vinyl EP that most likely used tracks from the 1993 Everything Falls Apart And More CD as its source. Release date is a guess, based on an initial sighting in Dec 2000. Cover artwork probably scanned in from an original (loss of detail apparent), and titles redone on a computer in a low-resolution font; New Alliance logo obliterated from sleeve, but New Alliance cited in lyric insert, which claims a run of 500 copies. As a curiosity, this item is worth maybe $5-10 to diehard collectors (I paid a lot more on eBay just to find out what it was; make no mistake: it's a fake). It bears some striking similarities to the Happy Moose The Early Years bogus reissue (folded paper \"sleeve\" made from the same stock; similarly colored labels). Matrix number in runout area scratched out. Contents: (A) In A Free Land What Do I Want? M.I.C.

The Hüsker song, a Zen Arcade outtake, sounds pretty good, much cleaner than the version on the Now And Zen boot CD. Very nice packaging job, superior to many mass-produced boots.

This is a vinyl repressing of the Everything Falls Apart And More CD with the tracks rearranged a bit. Back cover says \"Alternative Rock Productions, Kopenhagen, Denmark\" and \"Made in the EEC 2002.\" Recording quality is decent, except that the stereo field drifts back and forth annoyingly on some tracks and there are multiple glitches/skips on the \"Statues\" track. Size of the production run is unknown. This copy turned up at a record fair in England, and I paid way too much for it on eBay. Contents: In A Free Land 2:55 What Do I Want? 1:16 M. I.

Nice packaging, though; even the disc artwork is beautifully done (probably via inkjet, but I'm not going to run hot water over it to find out). This item started showing up on eBay in 2004, and has reportedly been seen for sale in record stores and at record fairs. The address on the back cover for \"Odyssey Records\" -- 14 Venus Lane, Boise ID 83301 -- is fictitious. As for content, this is just another copy of the 28 Aug 1985 Minneapolis Spin show, obviously cloned from the first Live In Boston 1986 boot CD, the only variant with which all the track times match exactly. \"(You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)\" is present on the recording but not listed in the liner notes; \"Celebrated Summer\" is listed but not present (in the semi-usual tradition).

Location: Studio demos Recording Quality: B Time: Notes: Nice, thick-vinyl pressing made from (at best) mediocre-sounding source material. Most likely based on a cassette copy of the \"Savage Young Du\" demos, although the song order is shuffled a bit. Origin is murky; my copy was bought on eBay ($30) from a seller in Greece who says he acquired a few of these from a guy in Germany. There are no clues to manufacture on the disc; runout area is blank. Packaging is pretty crappy -- photocopied front and back, glued to plain white cardboard sleeve. The version of \"Writer's Cramp\" is the faster one. Contents: Picture Of You Can't See You Anymore The Truth Hurts Do You Remember?

The High end is a little muffled and there are frequent faint clicking noises (that sound more like digital artifacts than flaws in the vinyl), but overall the sound is not bad for a bootleg. Packaging isn't exactly sturdy, but the artwork is printed on the cardboard outer sleeve (as opposed to a paper insert or glue-on). Inner sleeve is plain white. The version of \"Somewhere\" is the alternate take with the extra guitar overdub. First time on vinyl for outtake tracks \"Some Kind Of Fun\" and \"Dozen Beats Eleven.\" The issuing \"label\" and matrix number, \"A Cheapo Disc 001,\" is etched in the runout area. Other runout inscriptions include: \"TAKE THAT SST\" (side 1) and \"RIP: HAPPY MOOSE, AGRESSIVE BUDDHIST, AND RECOMMENDED\" (side 2), a reference to bootlegger imprints of years gone by. There's also a small personal signature on side 1, semi-legible at best and probably meant as a tease (although it could say \"R. Bryan\" or \"K. Bryan\"). According to one eBay seller, the pressing was limited to 300 numbered copies. The record is typically priced at about $15 US.

This, the first vinyl version, has a gatefold cover of decent quality. Presumably a companion piece to the Live Mould boot CD. Track listing below is as it appears in the liner notes (not verified).

Described as a \"numbered, limited edition\" on clear vinyl. The sleeve pictured in the listing indicates that the specific item for sale is #1 of a run of 50. The seller's other (non-Hüsker) items are also all #1 or #2 of 50. Conjecture: the record was probably cut on a home recording lathe, not pressed, and the run was likely far smaller than suggested. The initial listing for the Hüsker record closed without attracting a buyer. It may or may not reappear (stay tuned). The two songs on the record were previously bootlegged as the opening tracks on the Supernova CD. Seller is located in Greece. Contents: (A) These Important Years (B) Charity, Chastity, Prudence And Hope ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Artist: Hüsker Dü Title: Live In Minneapolis Subtitle: August 28th 1985 Format: 12\" (33 RPM) Label: DOL Catalog Number: DOR2151H Date Recorded: 28 Aug 1985 Release Date: Mid(?) 2017 Location: First Avenue, Minneapolis Recording Quality: A- Time: Notes: DOL is a sketchy Russian outfit that specializes in unauthorized \"reissues.\" The label's purported website, www.vinylogy.ru, displays a nonsense page. There's an attempted DOL catalog listing on Discogs, but it's incomplete. Release date is listed as 01 Jan 2017 on Amazon, but this is most likely a default for unknown day/month, as no references to this album appeared until summer 2017. The 180-gram vinyl is a clean pressing: the sound is pristine, but thin, heavily compressed, and low in level. Track listing is accurate, and is identical to the The Complete Spin Radio Concert boot LP. Refer to Spin Radio Concert Bootleg Comparison Charts page for more information and obsessive detail.

Album release date is as shown in Amazon listing. LP pressed on 180-gm white vinyl. Title and much of the album artwork is the same as the CD version on the Interference label. Track cue bands are narrow and difficult to discern on the white vinyl, but are in the correct spots.

Label: Smokin' Catalog Number: SMCD965 Date Recorded: 13 Jul 1981 Release Date: 2018 Location: Euphoria Tavern, Portland OR Recording Quality: B+ Time: 39:11 Notes: European (UK?) CD peddled as a \"radio broadcast\" to circumvent copyright restrictions. (It's conceivable, at least hypothetically, that the recording of the performance, which was widely circulated among tape traders back in the day, was broadcast on a college radio station or something, but there's no evidence of it.) Amazon lists a release date of 08 Feb 2019, but there are earlier reported sightings of this boot. For some reason, three songs were omitted: \"Data Control,\" \"Tired Of Doing Things,\" and the fragmentary snippet of \"Sexual Economics.\" \"Termination\" is incorrectly credited to Bob Mould instead of Greg Norton. No info available about the purported vinyl LP version.

Pressing is clean, but the audio is a bit muddy. \"Reoccurring Dreams,\" which led into \"Eight Miles High,\" is listed on the back cover, but has been awkwardly edited out. The closing song, \"Love Is All Around,\" is missing altogether. Undoubtedly another European release (UK maybe?) taking advantage of the cloak of legitimacy offered by the EU ruling that all live broadcasts are public domain and thus don't need to be licensed.

See previous notes for discussion of the \"radio broadcast\" claims that purport to confer legitimacy on the release of these recordings in Europe. In any case this is a clean pressing of a shitty copy of one of the widely circulated tapes of this gig. Sound is thin and the speed fluctuates. Three of the tracks listed on the back cover of the album are not actually present: \"Diane\" and \"Gravity\" at the end of side 1 and \"Termination\" at the start of side 2.
