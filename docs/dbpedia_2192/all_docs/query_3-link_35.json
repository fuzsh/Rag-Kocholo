        "text": "Lots of good questions. Even though I am far from an LP\n\ncollector, let me try to provide some answers.\n\nIn article <4v0b40$n...@taco.cc.ncsu.edu>, Randy Darrah\n\n{ rlda...@unity.ncsu.edu> writes:\n\n|> Here is the first of my questions concerning record\n\n|> collecting, specifically Blue Note LPs.\n\n|>\n\n|> There seems to be a world-wide demand for Blue Note LPs. However, as\n\n|> much as I look through records, I cannot find any at all. I realize that\n\n|> Blue Note artists were from the NYC area (for the most part) and rarely\n\n|> played outside that area, thus limiting their exposure to the rest of the\n\n|> country. As a result of this, BN LPs did not sell in even modest\n\n|> quantities outside of the East Coast. I can attest to their rarity from\n\n|> the fact that I do not see any, in any condition, at all.\n\nThis is exactly the reason I gave up record collecting ... most\n\nused record stores have 20 copies of Elton John LPs or fusion\n\nLPs from the 1970s, but very little vintage jazz, except for\n\ncheap late-70s or early-80s reissue pressings.\n\n|> But this is not my question.\n\n|>\n\n|> I am interested in finding out WHY you are seeking out these long lost\n\n|> and hard to find LPs?\n\nPeople have various reasons including:\n\n*Sound quality. Very often the original LPs sound much better\n\nthan the CD reissues, either because the master tapes have\n\ndegraded over the years, or because the CD reissue was\n\nbotched in some way, or, and this is debatable but believed by\n\nsome, good LPs played on a really good turntable usually\n\nsound better than even the best CDs.\n\n*Cover art. The tiny CD booklets simply cannot compare with\n\nthe lush thick full-size cardboard sleeves of many vintage LPs.\n\nAlso, many CD reissues substitute cheesy new cover art for\n\nthe original cover art; even when the original cover art was\n\nnot too good, the new cover art meant to give the CD a more\n\n\"modern\" appeal is almost never even that good. Sometimes the\n\noriginal LP has a fancy foldout cover or a booklet that\n\nthe CD does not or cannot reproduce.\n\n*Collectibility. Original or early pressings often become\n\ncollectors items. Just like first printings of books, people\n\noften value the originals even when they offer no particular\n\nadvantages over subsequent reissues. In the case of LPs,\n\nthe first pressings often sound better than subsequent\n\npressings, sometimes dramatically so, if for no other reason\n\nthan that the first pressing usually receives more careful\n\ntreatment.\n\n*Out-of-print. Some albums are not available on CD and\n\nmay _never_ be available again.\n\n|> Also, WHEN did you first become interested in BN jazz?\n\nAround 1988.\n\n|> Did your Dad play them for you when you were young, thus making you\n\n|> search for the sounds you heard as a child? This is a very common reason\n\n|> that collectors give, including myself.\n\nNo. My dad had a few records --- honkey tonk piano, Little\n\nRichard, etc. --- which my mother let me stomp on for fun\n\nas a toddler, which story my father never tires of recounting.\n\nMy family picked up other records during my childhood years,\n\nincluding, bullfight music, Stauss Waltzes, Puff the Magic Dragon,\n\nsoundtrack to Paint Your Wagon, and so forth. No jazz.\n\nIn fact, the first time I remember hearing jazz was as\n\na child. I remember distinctly watching a film strip,\n\nprobably in 5th grade, in which they showed a clip of\n\na \"jazz\" band; I thought \"wow, jazz really stinks, I'm\n\n_never_ going to listen to jazz.\" In restrospect, I\n\nrealize it was probably some sort of early-70s funky\n\nfusion pop-jazz band, which I still hate.\n\n|> Did you expose yourself to this music on your own?\n\nYes.\n\n|> Were you old enough at the time these LPs were \"current\"\n\n|> thus able to buy something new and different and taking a\n\n|> chance you may or may not like it?\n\nNo. In my 20's, I got tired of alternative rock and just\n\nfigured, for no particular reason, that jazz had to be\n\nbetter. I bought a copy of the Rolling Stone Guide to\n\nJazz Records, made up a list, and started buying.\n\nMy best early purchases included Thelonius Monk \"Monk's\n\nDream\" on Columbia, Art Blakey's \"Moanin'\" on Blue\n\nNote, Eric Dolphy's \"Out to Lunch\" on Blue Note,\n\nand a Blue Note compliation that led me to buy a lot\n\nof other Blue Note albums. I also bought a number of things\n\nwhich did nothing for me, including some Columbia compliations\n\nand the Smithsonian collection (sorry). Overall, though,\n\nby sticking mainly with classic reissues, I had a high enough\n\nsuccess rate to keep me interested.\n\n|> Do you collect them just because they are rare records and not so much\n\n|> for the musical content?\n\nI tried, I really tried, to collect LPs. I found a couple or\n\noriginal Impulse! LPs, but nothing special. At the time,\n\neven the Liberty reissues of Blue Note LPs were selling for\n\n$20, when you could find them, and that was not even anything\n\nnear mint condition. If you live in a big city like New York,\n\nor know enough to do mail order, that's another thing.\n\nOtherwise, you just have to be lucky to live near a store\n\nthat looks for good stuff, and does not price it into the\n\nstratosphere; that, in my experience, is extremely rare\n\n|> PS: The same questions can be asked for Prestige and other 50s jazz\n\n|> labels in big demand today. What is drawing so many people to this\n\n|> material these days?\n\nAs far as the music goes, I think at least part of it is\n\nthe \"live in studio\" recording technique that was used,\n\nof necessity, until the late 1960's. In the old days, it\n\nmight take a few hours to record an ordinary small group\n\njazz album, not including rehearsal time; these days,\n\nit might takes days, or weeks, or months. Also, I think\n\nthe simpler recording styles suit jazz much better than\n\ntoday's processed pop-rock-derived recording styles (in\n\nfact, I think the simpler recording styles and live-in-the-\n\nstudio playing was much better for rock, as well as jazz,\n\nbut that's another story, as well as a sort of long\n\ntime theme for me when it comes to music, predating\n\nmy interest in jazz by many years).\n\nWhile the market for pre-1970s jazz has never been huge,\n\nit does seem to be growing faster than the general population.\n\nWhen you consider that most of the original albums sold\n\nin the thousands --- tens of thousands was extraordinary --- its\n\nnot hard to understand why these have become rare and valuable\n\ncollectors items. For me, having exhausted most of the\n\nobvious choices, t is usually enough of a challange\n\nfinding what I want on CD. If I had started collecting\n\nearlier, and had a good depth of quality jazz LPs, I might\n\nhave stuck with LP, but as it was...\n\nBert\n\n<gran...@grove.ufl.edu> wrote:\n\n>I can't speak for anyone else, but I am interested in Blue Note products\n\n>because, in my opinion, they are simply the best and most consistent jazz\n\n>label of all time.\n\nGosh, where were you when we needed you a while back! You missed that thread...\n\n>This is slightly off-topic, but I have a problem with \"collectors\" who buy\n\n>stuff by people they don't even like or know, and then try to resell it at\n\n>amazingly high prices.\n\nThey are not collectors. They are dealers. But not all are this mercenary\n\n(some yes, yich, wretch)... Some dealers became such in \"self-defense\"...\n\nthey are ardent jazz-a-holics, vinyl lovers, and also compulsive completist\n\ncollectors... but not being rich they could not afford to amass a superlative\n\ncollection. So they became dealers in order to do so. Armand Lewis comes\n\nto mind in this regard. And then there is my friend Tom Burns. Tom loves this\n\nmusic and has dedicated his life to it, even subsidizing a jazz record label\n\n(Capri) with his modest income selling \"rare\" jazz LPs. I have personally seen\n\nTom pay an extra-ordinary amount of money for a mega-rare jazz LP (often to a\n\ncollector or musician) where he stands to make a miniscule mark-up.\n\n>To me, that mentality goes against the nature of\n\n>music, in that it is to be shared with everyone and not hoarded by greedy\n\n>people.\n\nWell, this would be nice in Shangri-la, but it was a business back then, and is\n\na business now. And most performers want to make good money and deserve to...\n\n>To me, that purposely keeps people from getting exposed to new\n\n>artists.\n\nI don't understand this... Does the previous reference to theoretical hoarding\n\nby greedy people keep others from discovering _today's_ new artists -- or the\n\nold ones? New artists are on CD... this has _no_ effect on it at all... other\n\nthan record collecting probably turns more new people on to jazz as a genre,\n\nand may lead to increased sales for new artists. Does it keep people from\n\ndiscovering the older (vinyl, 50's-70's) artists? How? Because they are\n\n\"hoarding\" all the copies of the LPs? And you said _purposely_... A\n\nconspiracy? \"Let's not let more people discover how great BN's are -- so we\n\ncan hog all the LPs?\" That's just not true...\n\n>I have seen people selling albums for as high as $80, and I think\n\n>that it outrageous.\n\nWell, I spent $1800 each for my tonearm and cartridge... is that outrageous?\n\nIt was a luxury, yes... and my previous ones were about a third of that... but I\n\nhad the cash at the time, and I could hear a difference... and at the time I\n\nseriously listened to 2-3 hours of music per night... And I'm in showbiz, and I\n\npull up at fancy restaurants in a pick-up truck, not a BMW... to me $50,000\n\ncars are \"outrageous\"... but I can understand it...\n\nAs far as $80 albums... that's very moderate -- depending which ones. First\n\noff, I can't help some yahoo putting an $80 price tag on a common LP, worth\n\n$8... I can only defend true collectible jazz LPs. In real jazz collecting...\n\nI'll use your years, most BN's from 1960-61 go for $50 to $150 each, for the\n\nmono first pressing in _true_ near-mint condition, both LP and cover. Do you\n\nknow how rare it is to find the art work perfectly preserved? No tape, no\n\nwriting on the cover, no split seams or ringwear? Much of the collector value\n\nis for the cover/art... And one can get \"the music\" for much less, buying a\n\ndecent first pressing LP in not-so-great cover. Or a stereo copy. Next comes\n\nthe \"NY, usa\" Blue Notes 1962-65ish... These are generally $30-60 mono NM, a bit\n\nless for stereo. And a few tougher titles like Mobley's \"Workout\" and such go\n\nfor $100 easy... Next come the Liberty's (8)4251 onward... and these go for\n\n$10-30 for the earlier ones... and easily below $10 an LP for the later. The\n\nWayne Shorter Super Nova you mentioned, is easily available in used LP store\n\nbins in major cities for under $10... These mid 70's BN's sold more than the\n\nolder ones, and many are around.\n\nNow, these prices (vary from place to place, higher in high rent/cost towns like\n\nNY and SF) ... These prices are for the _first_ pressing only! There are second\n\npressing, thirds, fourth and fifths! All at increasingly lower prices on 90% of\n\nthese issues! If one culls the bins in almost any major city... And is willing\n\nto take any clean vinyl reissue of a blue note: Blue labels, UA, DMM's... One\n\ncould easily amass a good collection of BN titles and average around $10 each.\n\nEven more complete if you average around $12-15... This is not outrageous,\n\ncomparable to CD, and many of the titles are not yet out on CD... And the\n\nJapanese CD's are $20 ot $25 (due to currency problems)... So again, this is\n\nnot outrageous. On top of this, many of these titles are available on CD, or\n\nfrom Mosaic, and more will continue to be... So how does the few first pressings\n\ngoing for collectible prices keep people from being exposed to the music?\n\nIn fact everytime I learned about a really rare/expensive jazz LP... (a $500 one\n\nmore so than an $80 one)... I'd run out an buy the cd, or a re-issue, just to\n\nhear the music, and see what the fuss was about. Also, the almost the entire\n\nBN catalog, has been systematically been reissued in Japan for the last 18 years\n\nor so... On lovely vinyl issues, with nice reproductions of the original cover\n\nart. These used to be $15-18, but are up to $35, due to the currency\n\nimbalance... but that's not the fault of greedy record hoarders. And used\n\ncopies of these are often available.\n\n>I enjoy vinyl because of its different (I won't say\n\n>better) sound quality from cd and beacuse of the larger artwork,\n\nAha! And for some people it's worth a premium. You have people wanting the\n\noriginals who _do_ vastly prefer the sound (including me)... You have people\n\nwanting to hear the mono mixes (including me, but not all record collectors)...\n\nYou have compulsive compleatist collectors (not me) who would be on stamps or\n\ncoins if they didn't love jazz... And you have people in Asia and Europe\n\ncollecting our jazz records (as I'm now collecting thiers)... And why not? How\n\nmany of our favorites artists would have starved without their love for jazz in\n\nthe 60's and in fact to this day? I live in tiny Cambria, CA, and so does Red\n\nHolloway, but he has to go to Europe 6 months of the year to make a living.\n\nSo anyway, you have all these people wanting the originals... And there are so\n\nfew... (but there are plenty of reissues to around... the music is _not_ being\n\nhoarded!)\n\n>but I\n\n>will not pay more than $10 for an album.\n\nWell, if your on a budget that's understandable. But if your a rich guy, then\n\nsorry, IMO your being cheap (for I realize, noble, idealistic, semi-socailist\n\nvalues)... Let's take Tommy Flannagan \"Overseas\" on Prestige. According to\n\nTom Burns only 300 copies were pressed, half promos. How many near-mint ones\n\nhave survived? 10%? How many of those have really near perfect covers? 10?\n\nThis is an LP that one copy every two years turns up! I'd gladly pay $500 for\n\none... maybe more for the one with the perfect cover... Now, should this copy\n\nbe no more than $10? Who gets it? You? Is this fair to the selling collector\n\nwho bought it and preserved it for 40 years, while most others thrashed their\n\ncopies... Should that seller or his widow only get $10? What if it's a\n\nmusician selling his LPs? What if it's the musician who recorded it?\n\nIs the music available... yes... There's a Japanese vinyl issue (I have) and I\n\nthink CD as well... The record is actually not much in demand musically, and I\n\nthink fantasy/OJC hasn't bothered to stock it... but they could anytime at $9.99\n\nI may be buying some LPs from the original collection of a musician who's super\n\ndedicated but went into teaching. He played his LPs only once to tape them,\n\nperfectly preserved them for 30 years... Has dedicated his life to jazz and is a\n\nworking guy. Now should he sell 50 of his let's say medium-rarity records to\n\nyou at $10 each... or to me at $80 each? Or to a store for 50cents so they can\n\nafford to re-sell them for \"no more than $10\"... Which would be more fair?\n\n>Any more than that, and you might\n\n>as well buy the cd and at least ensure the artist is getting some\n\n>royalties.\n\nThis is not acurate... and I'm living on royalties right now, so believe me I am\n\nsensitive to the subject. Okay first off... the \"valuable\" jazz LPs, are 97%\n\nfrom the 1950's and early 1960's... According to several threads here in the\n\npast, and my own research... almost all your favorite BN's from those years were\n\n\"buy-out\" deals... Flat rates. Most of the Prestige and other stuff too.. So\n\nwhen you go buy the new batch of re-issue CDs... When you buy you're OJC's...\n\nno one is getting a nickel in royalties. And believe me, even in little sliver\n\nof the market jazz represents, there are 100's to 1000's of CDs sold for every\n\nfirst pressing of the LP at $80 to a collector. That is the real shame here...\n\nOJC/Fantasy, and Blue Note (or atleast Mosaic) could easily voluntarily\n\nset-up royaly funds... but as far as I know they don't. Would we all (with all\n\nthe price griping) agree to pay an extra buck or two a CD for the BN\n\nconnoisseurs, or OJC reissues... if it was going to the artists? Nothing short\n\nof a serious boycott campaign IMO could cause this to come about.\n\nAnd I have no idea how it could be done.\n\n>In all the talk about how great vinyl is, it seems nobody\n\n>mentions that when you buy wax, the only person getting paid from it is\n\n>the person selling the record.\n\nOr on a used CD... But that has always been part of the bargain. And for\n\nartists with royalty deals, people dumping LPs to go CD is giving them a\n\ndouble dip... As will the \"next\" format after CD perhaps give David Murray\n\na boost around 2010.\n\nI'm friends with one of the largest private jazz collectors in the country.\n\nHe has 30,000 lps... but also 2000 cds of newer music... If it hadn't of been\n\nfor record collecting, he'd have never become such a compleatist nut and\n\nbought all those CDs...\n\nAlso, it is not just for the rich. I know a very working-man jazz drummer in\n\nTexas, who tours, and lives on a budget, and combs stores around the country,\n\nand records shows, and answers ads, and goes to moving sales... and invests\n\nsweat equity and has a great collection. And as I've pointed out in other posts\n\nthere first or early pressings of many great sessions, that are only of modest\n\ncost... more than $10, but $15 to $40 is not unreasonable... try collecting\n\n50's/60's baseball cards at those prices. And we get to listen to what we\n\ncollect!\n\nFinally, even with the mercenary aspects, and certainly the capitalist ones...\n\nI think jazz record collecting, of first pressings or reissues, or whatever...\n\nonly increases awareness and love of jazz... and ultimately helps today's\n\nand tommorows artists.\n\n>> Also, WHEN did you first become interested in BN jazz?\n\nWell, let me also answer Randy's original question... I got interested, really\n\ninterested after I'd aquired about 150 japanese reissues of BN LPs... at once...\n\nand finally started listening to them about 6 months later, and went, \"woah!\" I\n\nwas into softer stuff... Got a call one night from a friend who's business\n\ndidn't survive the recession... \"Lew, I can't pay my rent... I'm selling my\n\nrecords, get over here with some cash\" I go, \"You can't do that\". He goes,\n\n\"I sold the turntable 6 months ago. If you don't come over they go to record\n\nsurplus in the morning\"... I went to the ATM then to his place. I basically let\n\nhim pile up what I should get. I owed a lot more than the cash I'd brought.\n\nAbout 20% of my total savings by the time we were done, and they was lean\n\ntimes for me... but we went to the bank the next day and I got him more cash.\n\nAnd among other things I went home with all these \"blue notes\"... that I thought\n\nthey played too damn fast on...\n\nWell my friend and Linn \"dealer\" Michael Frasier once told me... (Now, here's\n\na guy with a baby grand piano, 5000 classical LPs alone, builds his own hi-fi\n\ngear, and has always sold and repaired hi-fi systems or Linn turntables)...\n\nHe said to me during my classical phase, after I'd bought my first couple big\n\nband and one ben webster record, he said about jazz, and especially post-bop...\n\n\"one day you'll come to realize it's the greatest music ever made...\" I was\n\n_very_ doubtful. Two years later I ran into him and told him he was right...\n\nThat's why I still keep the later Coltrane records I don't like... he told me\n\none day I would.\n\nLew"
