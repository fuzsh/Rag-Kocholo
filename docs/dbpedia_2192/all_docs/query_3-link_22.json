        "text": "Led Zeppelin Bloomington 1975\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nMet Center, Bloomington, MN, USA – January 18, 1975\n\nDisc 1 (54:01) Introduction, Rock And Roll, Sick Again, Over The Hills And Far Away, When The Levee Breaks, The Song Remains The Same, The Rain Song, Kashmir, The Wanton Song\n\nDisc 2 (54:34) MC, No Quarter, Trampled Under Foot, Moby Dick, Stairway To Heaven. Bonus Trax: Soundboard Fragments: MC / When The Levee Breaks, MC / The Song Remains The Same, MC / The Wanton Song, Black Dog\n\nThis is my third title featuring the opening night of Led Zeppelin’s 1975 North American Tour having previously reviewed both the audience and soundboard recordings, my enjoyment of this concert has not been diminished. This review will be strictly on the sound quality of the Graf Zeppelin version of the audience tape. First we go Somewhere Back In Time…In late April 2021, The Dogs Of Doom unearthed an incomplete audience recording of the Bloomington concert on Liberation Series Vol. 10, in very good quality to boot. This quickly made the rounds and was quickly released as Bloomington 1975 (No Label) followed by Jesus-Live In Minneapolis (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD-1280/1281 &Jesus BONUS), First Show From North American Tour 1975 (Wisteria 2021-007), and Bloomington 1975 (Graf Zeppelin LZSC-118A/B).\n\nThe sound of the recently unearthed audience tape from Minneapolis falls into the good to very good range. It was recorded by Don R on a National Panasonic recorder with a built in mic, there are several cuts throughout the tape between song in an effort to conserve tape. Seemingly the taper only brought one tape, In My Time Of Dying and the encores of Whole Lotta Love and Black Dog are missing. The sound is slightly distant and a bit boomy and bass heavy capturing the acoustics of the 15,000 seat Ice Hockey arena. The sound is thankfully clear and each of the four instruments can be heard and is fairly well balanced, Bonzo’s drums are powerful in the mix, always a plus.\n\nThe sound quality of this Graf Zeppelin title is very similar to the Wisteria title, the differences are minute, if anything it sounds like Wisteria removed a small amount of tape hiss. This new Graf Zeppelin sounds a bit closer to the original tape sound on the torrent with just a tad more openness to it, both titles slightly increased the volume. Graf Zeppelin did not edit the tape in any way and there are no issues at the track changes either, typical for Graf Zeppelin they present the complete recording with sound quality as good as it will get for the audience source with tasteful and quality mastering.\n\nAs I wrote previously, to my ears this recording sounds best in my home versus car, this is a tape that needs the open air to breathe and the confines of my car do not allow it to, this opinion has not changed. The taper was able to get a nice capture of the opening concert on the 1975 North American Tour, there is a little bit of audience chatter a couple of times and you really get an idea of how much the audience enjoyed the performance. It is great to hear their reaction to certain songs, most notably When The Levee Breaks, as soon a Bonzo begins the drum beat a punter near the taper scream loudly with excitement. The audience source also masks a few flubs by Page who is quickly getting used to his three fingered technique, but like I stated in my review of the soundboard, a very well played concert by Led Zeppelin.\n\nAs far as the audience sources are concerned, this is certainly the best of the audience recorded versions of When The Levee Breaks and The Wanton Song making this an essential recording for Led Zeppelin collectors. Of course with the appearance of the excellent soundboard recording found on Wanton Song 1975 Met Center (No Label) and All Is Safe For Rock And Roll (Eelgrass EGL20280/81/82/83), Bloomington 1975 (Graf Zeppelin LZSC-118A/B), Jesus (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD-1280/81 & Jesus-Bonus), and Salvation Through Him (Eelgrass EGL20286/287) it lessens this recordings appeal, however it should not be discounted. Don R captured a timeless piece of Led Zeppelin history and the audience recording should be listened to as intently as the soundboard as it captures the event from the audience. Again, praise and thank you must go to The Dogs Of Doom for seeking out and freely sharing this music with the fans.\n\nGraf Zeppelin also added four and a half minutes of bonus material, prior to the release of a four song sample, someone released short minute long soundboard samples of Levee, The Song Remains The Same, The Wanton Song, and Black Dog. These snippets are important for one main reason, we can hear Graf Zeppelin’s mastering on the soundboard. From what I can hear they took some of the sizzle off the top end, sadly it’s hard to confirm the extent of the mastering and if it is improvement or not since most of the snippets are Robert’s introductions. This is the only source, for good reason now, of these snippets as they serve no real purpose and are just a curiosity.\n\nThe packaging is typical Graf Zeppelin, a live shot of Page on the cover, a live shot of Robert on the rear and the interior features shots from the pre tour rehearsals just prior to this concert, the band looking relaxed and ready to get back in front of an audience. The shots are candid showing the group in the Met Center from presumably the day before the concert. Graf Zeppelin consistently put out quality product, this title certainly meets my expectations and is my preferred version of the Bloomington 1975 tape.\n\nThe Rolling Stones Live’r Than You’ll Ever Be (1969/2011)\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nThe importance of The Rolling Stones Liver Than You’ll Ever Be cannot be over estimated. Great White Wonder cover the Bob Dylan basement tapes was the first commerically produced bootleg and is rightly priased for the industry it helped promote. The Dylan was produced out of an encounter, happenstance and need, but the Rolling Stones title was produced out of a deliberate act of producing a definitive live souvenir of the first Rolling Stones tour in three years.\n\nAnd unlike the Dylan and others, this established a market for audience recording sourced bootlegs. The Dub taped used for the original Lurch (and subsequently TMOQ) releases remains one of the most clear, vivid and enjoyable documents from the tour.\n\nLiver Than You’ll Ever Be, the new four disc title on Dog N Cat, is a collection with a newly surfaced audience tape of the November 9th late show. To celebrate this occasion it is packaged with material from the opening acts, the Bill Graham soundboard recording, and the famous TMOQ tape in one convenient package.\n\nSeasoned Rolling Stones collectors may scoff at this release as a cynical attempt to get more money by packaging the new tape with the older. But for collectors who do not have copies of all the tapes DAC-116 is a very good sounding and packaged document.\n\nDAC are self-consciously following the example of last year’s Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out 40th Anniversary edition which included multiple sources for those shows and included a disc devoted to the opening acts (something which Mick Jagger originally envisioned for the project in 1970). Unlike the official product no DVD is included because no footage exists from the show.\n\nThe website Revelations On The Rolling Stones summed up the importance of this show the best. In the article “The LIVEr Than You’ll Ever Be’ Story,” he writes:\n\n“‘LIVEr Than You’ll Ever Be’” is not only significant because of its place in the bootleg history, but also because of the mood and feel that it captured as the Rolling Stones returned to live performances for the first time in over three years with new guitarist Mick Taylor. Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, and The Cream had all happened since the last tour through the States. Guitar heroes and songs with great solos were the talk of the day. There was a stark difference between the screaming crowds that marked the close of their last US tour in Hawaii July 28, 1966, and the audiences they were now facing who were sitting down during the shows and listening to the music.\n\n“The Oakland performances were early in the tour and the band was still getting acquainted with itself in a live setting with the sound system that could be heard in the far reaches of the stadiums they were playing in. The recording is primal in it’s musical depth compared to the well known “Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out!” commercial release from the 1969 tour. There are no vocal or instrumental overdubs on LIVEr which enables the listener to compare the band early in the tour to the slicker overdubbed recording that would represent a band that had musically evolved very quickly during the course of the tour. It has been written that ‘Get Your Ya-Ya’s Out!’ was released to counter sales of this record.”\n\nOakland Coliseum, Oakland, CA – November 9th, 1969 2nd show\n\nDisc 1 (49:26): Ike & Tina Turner: Come Together, Respect. Terry Reid: Marking Time, I’ve Got News For You, Superlungs My Supergirl. B.B. King: Get Off My Back Woman, instrumental\n\nDisc 2 (74:42): Jumping Jack Flash, Carol, Sympathy For The Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Prodigal Son, You Gotta Move, Love In Vain, I’m Free, Under My Thumb, Midnight Rambler, Live With Me, Gimme Shelter, Little Queenie, (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Honky Tonk Woman, Street Fighting Man\n\nNovember 9th is the third stop (and fifth overall concert) on The Rolling Stones’ first tour of the US in three years after opening in Colorado and Los Angeles. The new tape source is very good but distant from the stage. It has a very loud echo surrounding the music. There is nice balance and detail in the music, and since the audience were catatonic that night there is very little audience interference.\n\nOnly fragments of the opening acts are included. Ike & Tina Turner bring their soul and blues revue to Oakland. “Come Together” is a rather faithful cover the The Beatles’ song from Abbey Road. It’s remarkable since the album was only released a few months prior. “Respect” is a long cover of the Arethra Franklin hit, expanded with Tina’s long feminist rap. She gets the audience motivated, telling men that women can be unfaithful too!\n\nJudging by the official release, much of the set is missing including “Gimme Some Loving,” “Sweet Soul Music,” “Son Of A Preacher Man,” “Proud Mary,” “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long” and “Land Of A Thousand Dances.”\n\nTerry Reid’s portion includes three songs. He had toured the US the previous year with Cream and was with the Rolling Stones to promote his new album Terry Reid (US title: Move Over for Terry Reid). He is joined by Pete Solley on keyboards and Keith Webb on drums. The first, “Marking Time,” is a long original number and is followed by the Ray Charles cover “I’ve Got News For You.”\n\nThe final song included is the first song from the album, a cover of the Donavan Leitch song “Superlungs My Supergirl.”\n\nB.B. King’s songs are two long guitar based blues numbers. “Get Off My Back, Woman” is an original song released on his latest LP Live & Well. It was issued earlier that year with half of the songs recorded live and five tracks in the studio and was a commercial breakthrough for King since it was his first to enter the Top 100. Judging by the 40th Anniversary version, this is only a small taste of his entire set.\n\nThe Stones come on stage after being introduced by Sam Cutler and start with “Jumping Jack Flash.” It is slow, deliberate, and crawls on stage as the band try to warm up. Jagger tells the audience that “we’re really pleased to be back here. Really! No bullshit. We’re really gonna give you … we know it’s a bit late, but we hope you don’t mind if we stay” before the first Chuck Berry cover of the night “Carol.”\n\n“Sympathy For The Devil” is tight if a bit stiff. Jagger tells the audience they are going to “get back to the ladies” before an excellent “Stray Cat Blues.” It is curious how the enthusiasm in the audience drops after the opening number. The vocals for “Stray Cat Blues” are very clear and it causes one to wonder if the audience were shocked by the narrative.\n\nThey remain quiet when the rest of the band leave the stage leaving only Jagger and Richards. “At this point we’re gonna sit down … bring out the stools … and you be quiet” Jagger says. Someone in teh audience shouts “alright Mick” prompting Jagger to respond “alright Jack” to some laughter.\n\nAfter a brilliant “Love In Vain” they play “I’m Free,” the second oldest song in the setlist (released as a single in 1965). It wasn’t kept long in the set since it didn’t elicit much reaction from the audience. In the second Oakland show it sounds lifeless and dull despite Mick Taylor’s efforts. It would be dropped following the following night’s show in San Diego and not reappeare again until the Stones hit the east coast, when it would form a short medley with “Under My Thumb.”\n\nJagger tells the audience to shake their asses before an effective version of “Midnight Rambler.” This would be their major improvisational showpiece for this and several other tours and rarely sounds bad live. More new songs follow including “Live With Me” where Taylor’s amplifier breaks down in the middle prompting Jagger to sing “I think we got a problem / I think we got a problem” until it’s fixed. he complains about it afterwards too.\n\n“Gimme Shelter” is the final new song of the night. It was played in the opening night in Colorado and would be played in Phoenix on the 11th, on the “Ed Sullivan Show,” in Miami on November 30th and Altamont. It wouldn’t be a regular track in the Stones’ stage show until the 1972 tour.\n\nBefore “Little Queenie” Jagger wants to see how the audience are dressed before doing “one from a long time ago while when we was all falling out of our cradles.” This little quip found its way into the film Gimme Shelter. The last couple of songs “Honky Tonk Women” and “Street Fighting Man” are a marked improvement over the earlier parts of the show with much more confidence and energy from both band and audience.\n\nFM soundboard source\n\nDisc 3 (36:53): Sympathy For The Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Prodigal Son, You Gotta Move, Love In Vain, Live With Me, Gimme Shelter, Little Queenie, Satisfaction\n\nBill Graham himself broadcast this tape on KSAN in San Francisco on October 29th, 1972, the same month the late, great Tom Donohue became program director for this progressive station. The existence of this tape is as much a testimony to the Stones as it is to the glory days of free form radio in the late sixties to the late seventies.\n\nStations like KSAN in San Francisco and WNEW in New York were not beholden to the rigid programming of the AM top-40 format and the presentation of rock and roll was as much of an art form as the music itself. Hearing music, even from popular bands, out of the context of the proscribed hits was more common then than now.\n\nThis tape was first booted on vinyl in Germany and is the source for the earliest CD release, Hangout (World Production Of Compact Music D 047-2). Oakland ‘69 (Audifon AF 005) and Oakland Sixty-Nine (Vinyl Gang Product RS-692 VGP-003) are two more recent releases of this show. The last version before DAC is Oakland Coliseum Arena 1969 FM-SB (SODD-029) released several years ago. DAC sounds much more natural compared to the SODD title.\n\nTMoQ source\n\nDisc 4 (74:40): Jumping Jack Flash, Carol, Sympathy For The Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Prodigal Son, You Gotta Move, Love In Vain, I’m Free, Under My Thumb, Midnight Rambler, Live With Me, Gimme Shelter, Little Queenie, (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Honky Tonk Woman, Street Fighting Man\n\nThe final disc of this set covers the famous Trade Mark of Quality recording. According to the book Bootleg by Clinton Heylin, the taper used “a Sennheiser 805 ‘shotgun’ microphone and a Uher4000 reel-to-reel tape recorder, which was real small, 7 1/2 inch per second 5″ reels.” The LP was released just over a month after the show on the Lurch label.\n\nThe recording has such an impact that it received a review in Rolling Stone. Author Greil Marcus opined, “How it was recorded is more interesting, because the sound quality is superb, full of presence, picking up drums, bass, both guitars and the vocals beautifully. The LP is in stereo; while it doesn’t seem to be mixed, the balance is excellent. One of the bootleggers says the recording was done on an eight-track machine… So these may in fact be tapes that were made on the stage by someone involved in setting up the Stones’ own sound system.”\n\nIt has been featured on countless titles over the years including Live’r than You’ll Ever be (The Swingin’ Pig TSP-CD-043), Revolution Sixtinine (Great Dane Records GDR CD 9105), Vintage but Vigorous (WPOCM 0590 D 052), Have a Beer (Teddy Bear Records TB 38), Stone from the Bay (Wild Bird Records WBR CD 9014), The Original Live’r than You’ll Ever be (VGP-024), From San Francisco to Paris (VGP-276), Out of Joint (Black ‘n Blue RSBB-2004/005), Live’r than You’ll Ever be (Tarantura TCDRS-1-1,2) and Live’r than They’ll Ever be (SODD 013). DAC do not tamper with the tape and include the dropouts on the original tape and sounds very nice.\n\nLiver Than You’ll Ever Be is packaged in a basic fatboy jewel case. The front cover contains a reproduction of the concert poster and with several rare pictures on the back in insides. DAC also include an obi strip (written in Japanese) to be placed over the spine and recounts the other Satanic tour releases in their catalogue. Like many DAC releases, this is redundant for many collectors since much of it has come out before. However for newer collectors it is a very good title worth having.\n\nBruce Springsteen Winterland Night (1978)\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nWinterland, San Francisco, CA, USA – 15 December, 1978\n\nDisc 1: Intro, Badlands, Streets Of Fire, Spirit In The Night, Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Factory, The Promised Land, Prove It All Night, Racing In The Street, Thunder Road, Jungleland, The Ties That Bind\n\nDisc 2: Intro, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, The Fever, Fire, Candy’s Room, Because The Night, Point Blank, Mona/Preacher’s Daughter, She’s The One, Backstreets, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\n\nDisc 3: Intro, Born To Run, Devil With The Blue Dress On, Good Golly Miss Molly, C.C. Rider, Jenny Take A Ride, Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, Raise You Hand, Quarter To Three\n\nBonus Tracks: Paramount Theater, Seattle, WA, USA – 25 June, 1978: Growin’ Up, The Promise, I Fought The Law; Masonic Temple, Detroit, MI, USA – 1 September, 1978: Heatbreak Hotel, Lost In The Flood, Adam Raised A Cain, Chimes Of Freedom\n\nIn 1979 ( or possibly early 1980) I acquired my very first bootleg recording, thereby gaining my first experience of a live Springsteen concert. The 3-LP set I discovered on a London market stall was called Live In The Promised Land (Slipped Disc Records/Piste Disques) and it contained the majority of Springsteen’s Winterland Concert of 15 December 1978. I was overwhelmed by the quality of the performance and with good reason. Crystal Cat’s booklet calls this “a performance that is commonly regarded by many Bruce Springsteen fans as one of the all time classics.” The Killing Floor Database states that “the performance was one of the best ever.” Lynn Elder, author of the early 1990s Springsteen bootleg CD guide, You Better Not Touch, is particularly effusive when writing about Great Dane’s later CD incarnation of the show:\n\n“One of the most important shows Springsteen ever performed, and one of legendary status among fans, this boot captures Springsteen in his prime…The performance is simply monumental and must be considered one of Springsteen’s best ever. An essential item for any Bruce fan to own.”\n\nLive In The Promised Land appeared in three packages: a box, a gatefold sleeve and a single sleeve. It also spawned several copies on various labels, some in very shoddy packaging. However, there was also an LP version of the full concert, the 4-disc Winterland (no label). The show was released on CD in 1989 by the Great Dane label as Live In The Promised Land and reissued the following year in improved sound quality in their Master Plus series. There was also a version on the Golden Stars label entitled Live At Winterland, which I believe was a copy of the original Great Dane version. The CD-R Santa Claus In Winterland (Alternative Edge Productions) was also a knock-off of the Great Dane release. The Brucebase website mentions a further version of the show called Prodigal Son At Winterland – 25th Anniversary Edition. Although this is more recent than the Crystal Cat version under review, I have no further knowlege of this release.\n\nUnlike Great Dane, Crystal Cat’s release includes a DJ from KSAN-FM welcoming the listeners from the various radio stations also broadcasting the concert. This is followed by Bill Graham’s introduction, in which he asks the audience to welcome “the chairman of the board, the great one – Bruce Springsteen.” (Having had to suffer the negative consequences of excessive hype on more than one occasion already in his career, one wonders whether Springsteen would have been pleased by being described in such terms.)\n\nThe show itself begins with a thunderous rendition of Badlands, which heralds a slew of songs from Springsteen’s then-latest LP Darkness On The edge Of Town. Seven of the first eight numbers come from the new LP (the exception being a boisterously enjoyable Spirit In The Night). Tougher, darker and bleaker than Springsteen’s earlier albums, it has often been described as a more “adult” work (as opposed to the “adolescent” Born To Run). This harder edge comes across very effectively in the renditions of Badlands, Streets Of Fire, Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Factory and The Promised Land, all of which are played in performances very close to the LP versions, but with even greater fire and energy (or, in the case of the slower and quieter Factory, more poignancy). The renditions of Streets Of Fire and Darkness On The Edge Of Town are particularly impassioned.\n\nHaving been greatly impressed thus far, I was stunned by what came next. Prove It All Night opens with some melodic mid-paced piano from Roy Bittan and then, after a brief spoken introduction, continues with a superbly played guitar solo from Springsteen which builds in intensity until it culminates in an explosive opening to the song itself. At the end of a stirring performance further guitar work brings this eleven-minute number to a triumphant conclusion. The song was played regularly in this fashion on the Darkness On The Edge Of Town tour but this is the finest version I have heard.\n\nAn excellent rendition of Racing In The Street follows, featuring mellifluous piano from Bittan, whose playing provides a bridge into an equally fine full-band performance of Thunder Road. The epic Jungleland brings the first set, though not the first disc, to a close. The second set is too long to fit on one CD and so Crystal Cat end disc one with its first song, an enjoyable performance of the then-unreleased The Ties That Bind.\n\nDisc 2 begins with a spoken introduction to Santa Claus Is Coming To Town. Springsteen relates the story of how he and Steve Van Zandt, carrying their guitars and amps home from a gig, run into Santa Claus himself. Judging by the deep-voiced “Ho! Ho! Ho!” and the audience cheers Santa is played by a thinly-disguised Clarence Clemons. The band then launch into the song itself with great gusto, producing their best live rendition of an admittedly throwaway number. This is followed by a smokily atmospheric rendition of The Fever with Danny Federici’s organ, Roy Bittan’s piano and Clarence Clemons’ saxophone combining to great effect. Fire continues in a similar vein and then the tempo changes with the breathless Candy’s Room and an inspired seven-minute Because The Night. Much as I enjoy Patti Smith’s lighter and more melodic version (described in Angus MacKinnon’s New Musical Express review as “a near perfect single”), it must be said that Springsteen takes the song to a different level. With a harder edge than the Smith recording, this version features further superb guitar work from Springsteen – a slow opening features an effective combination of guitar and piano and a faster guitar solo appears later in the song.\n\nLike the version of Prove It All Night the next song, Point Blank, is one of the highlights not just of this set, but of Springsteen’s entire recorded live work. After an superbly atmospheric introduction featuring Bittan’s piano backed with Max Weinberg’s shimmering cymbals and Clemons’ triangle, the song, driven by Bittan’s haunting piano, delivers a shattering account of life lived in poverty and in the grip of drug dependency. The song made its debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles on 7 July 1978 and Springsteen explained that it concerned a couple he knew who had to work two jobs a day to avoid having their house repossessed. However, there is also a clear theme of drug use (“And so you stumble out into the morning/Searching for your usual fix”). According to Patrick Humphries and Chris Hunt in Blinded By The Light this was the result of “a girl friend’s drug addiction”. The harrowing nature of the lyrics comes from the sense of utter hopelessness. As Springsteen went on to say at The Roxy, it is “a song about being trapped and not being able to get out” – and, even worse, not even being able to comprehend who is responsible for your plight (“So you go home and you pack your pistol/And you go out looking for someone/But, girl, can’t you see they got you caught in the middle?/You don’t know where to aim your gun”). The version of this song on The River, as well as being inferior in execution, dilutes the emotional impact by introducing a relationship break-up theme (prompted, according to Christopher Sandford in Point Blank, by the ending of Springsteen’s relationship with Lynn Goldsmith).\n\nShe’s The One follows, prefaced, as often, not just with Mona but with a brief excerpt from Springsteen’s own The Preacher’s Daughter. The performance culminates in the “I Get Mad” section, which Humphries and Hunt list as a discrete song. Then comes the third stunning highlight of this concert, a heartfelt Backstreets which features the most impassioned and poignant version of the spoken “Sad Eyes” interlude. Having been betrayed by his lover in the number itself (“But I hated him and I hated you when you went away”) the song’s protagonist meets his ex-lover long after the relationship’s end, which culminates in an almost unbearably sad reminiscence (“You promised you’d never leave without me…like everything else from those days, you promised…and you lied”).\n\nAstoundingly, Springsteen then introduces Rosalita as “the saddest song we’re gonna play all night.” The conceit here is that Rosie has left him and that he is on “a nationwide hunt [for her] disguised as a rock and roll tour.” After the genuine emotion of Backstreets, this comes across as unbelievably crass. Fortunately, the song itself, replete with band introductions, brings the second set to its usual triumphant conclusion.\n\nThe encores consist of raucous versions of Born To Run and the Devil With The Blue Dress Medley, followed by exuberant renditions of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and (after a pause and some DJ comments) Eddie Floyd’s Raise Your Hand. The concert should have ended here and the disc contains parting comments from the DJs. However, Springsteen and the band returned unexpectedly to perform a wild version of Quarter To Three – or did they? The song is lacking its beginning, which is commensurate with everybody (even recording engineer Jimmy Iovine) being caught by surprise but the sound is quite different from that of the rest of the show. It seems, in fact, that the final song was Twist And Shout. One audience member recalls: “Finally he came back alone, and the band finally trickled out and Bruce said, ‘We’re off the radio now, but I’ll do one more for you guys. This is the first song I ever learned to play on the guitar,’ and then Twist And Shout. A great version too.” In addition to the fan’s conviction (“I was there and I’d stake my life on it.”), Humphries and Hunt confirm that Twist And Shout was indeed the first song Springsteen learned how to play. The current consensus, therefore, is that Quarter To Three comes from another, unknown source.\n\nCrystal Cat fill out disc 3 with a thoughtful collection of bonus tracks from two other 1978 concerts. Two of these are distinctive: an early version of Dylan’s Chimes Of Freedom, which would not be played again until June 1988 and what the booklet notes describe as “a one off (in terms of recording at least!) Darkness tour solo piano version of Lost In The Flood (its last ever performance to boot!)”. The highlight, however, is a moving performance of The Promise which features excellent playing from Bittan and does, as the booklet claims, “send shivers down your spine.” Though I am not sure that I would agree with the claim that this is the definitive version, it is certainly a contender.\n\nThe quality of the sound on these CDs is excellent. According to the booklet, “this release offers the finest sound quality that this show has ever been graced with, transferred digitally from the radio station master reels and mastered with the customary care and attention!” The sound is not absolutely perfect, however, but this seems to be more to do with the sound balance achieved by Iovine during the recording. As the Killing Floor Database states: “This release was not taken from the same tape as the GDR release. The sound is PERFECT, even if not perfectly mixed, so that some instruments lose something. Anyway, surely the best quality you can get for this show by now.” The CDs are housed in a thick jewel case with a trifold booklet. The photos appear to be from the actual concert (though this is not specified) and the discs themselves are printed in colour. This release is exemplary in every way and it should be a key component of every serious Springsteen collection.\n\nLed Zeppelin – Bath Of The Blues (1970)\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nBath Festival, West Showground, Shepton Mallet, UK – June 28, 1970\n\nIf there is one Led Zeppelin concert from 1970 that has been iconic since the band played it, it is most certainly their performance at the Bath Festival of Blues & Progressive Music ’70. The band considered it a key gig right from the start, their chance to hit the home crowd with a visceral performance that had been such an important factor in breaking North America. In speaking to the press prior to the show Robert Plant had this to say “Bath is going to be my thing this year. So many people can be a really wonderful thing. The Festival feeling is something you really need. We all need it. I really hope there is no hassle so everyone enjoys themselves”. The music papers were rampant with false information, rumors of the band breaking up were making the rounds, we now know this was the complete opposite, in fact the synergy between the four was unparalleled. The last word came from John Bonham whose statement was direct, “To put an end to all the break up rumors, anyone who goes to bath will see and hear Led Zeppelin play as they’ve never heard us play before”. Most diehards know the story, Peter Grant had a perfect time spot, just as the sun would be setting, a natural light show for his musicians. The Flock was running over, Grant takes matters into his own hands and basically pushes them off the stage so that Zeppelin’s equipment could be set up. This paid off, the band plays a spellbinding concert that not only breaks them big in England, but goes down in history as one of THE best.\n\nRaw Transfer and Final Mixdown\n\nDisc 1 & 3 (65:36) Crowd, Immigrant Song, Heartbreaker, Dazed and Confused, Bring It On Home, Since I’ve Been Loving You, Organ Solo, Thank You, That’s The Way (The Boy Next Door), What Is And What Should Never Be\n\nDisc 2 & 4 (64:55) Introduction, Moby Dick, How Many More Times, Whole Lotta Love, Communication Breakdown, Long Tall Sally, Say Mama, Johnny B Goode, Bye Bye Johnny, That’s Alright Mama, Long Tall Sally, Bye Bye Johnny, Outro\n\nThere was a film crew documenting the event but in a sad twist of history, the footage was not usable, the only documents are a brief snippet of 8mm footage, a lot of pictures and thankfully two audience recordings. Up until ten years ago, the quality of the audience recordings was fair to good at best, overloaded and distorted and difficult to listen to, I can remember have the Le-Mon title years ago, I listened once and shelved it and eventually sold it. The source of the old bootleg titles was Source 1, this was first pressed onto vinyl as Knock Oneself Out Vol 1 & 2 (Magic Market MM-101 A/B), a title that Robert Goodwin rates the sound as “incredibly bad” and “horrible”. There was a compilation record featuring two songs, Bath Festival 1970 (Krishna Records), with much better sound, the proverbial light at the end of a dark tunnel. Early CD titles were Bath 1970 (Le-Mon Recording Co. LZ 1 & 2), Bath Stop (Image Quality IQ-069/70), and Bath Festival 1970 (Empress Valley 68/69). Then in 2010 an upgraded version of Source 1 was released and quickly pressed on CD as Bath Festival 1970 (Empress Valley 540/541/542/543), Bath Festival 1970 (Wendy WECD-128/129), The Boy Next Door (No Label), In Yokel Mode (Boleskine House Records BHRCD-3), and most recently Bath Festival of Blues & Progressive Music ’70 (No Label).\n\nIn late December 2019 Tarantura 2K made the announcement that they were releasing a new title featuring the Bath concert from the original Source 1 Krishna master tape. Like many I was excited but reserved at the same time. The general consensus of many I know is that Tarantura 2K titles were mastered horribly, incredibly loud, compressed and for the most part I have avoided buying them unless it was an absolute must have. After a few email conversations with those in the know, I was assured this title would be different, so I took the plunge, the only title I own of Bath is the No Label title The Boy Next Door, and it has served me well in the past 10 years.\n\nFirst a bit of info on this new title, a four disc mini box set featuring a “Raw Transfer” set and “Final Mixdown” set with individual gate fold sleeves house in a mini box with OBI, you know the drill. The set comes in your choice of three different covers, I believe each cover was limited to 70 numbered copies. OK, on to the content, like The Boy Next Door, Tarantura 2K has used Source 2 to fill small gaps, they do not use it for the very beginning where Robert says “Hi….one two…”. I listened to the first four songs of the No Label title then proceeded to get into the first disc of the Raw Transfer. First off the sound is so much better even during the very unbalanced beginning of Immigrant Song, it brings a smile to your face. This is a major upgrade to what I have heard before. Yes this is the same recording yet the level of distortion is much less and there is a greatly improved separation between vocals and instruments that provides a clarity I have not heard in this recording prior. The recording is still thin and there is a small amount of tape hiss present, where the old The Boy Next Door was in the good range, this is in the very good range. The final group of encores are the worse sounding portion of the tape, and even then is greatly upgraded to what I have heard, the light at the tunnels end.\n\nBoth the Raw Master and Final Mixdown share the same content and disc times, the main difference being for the final mixdown there is less hiss and better lower frequencies, I have listened to both a couple times apiece and have not found myself preferring one over the other. This recording was purportedly made with an unknown tape recorder with a microphone on a 12 foot pole 200 yards from the stage, the latter is certainly not true. For a microphone twelve foot tall would put it at least six foot above the crowd yet this recording picks up coughs and audience interaction in very close proximity. Judging by the sound of this recording, our archivist was probably near a PA stack. There are gaps in the tape filled with Source 2, the first is a 1:32 gap between Since I’ve Been Loving You and the very beginning of the Organ Solo, from :32 to :35 of Thank You and finally a :15 second gap between How Many More Times and Whole Lotta Love, the seams are smooth and well handled.\n\nWhat can one say about Bath? It’s one of the great gigs of the year, certainly on par with the March and September gigs at the LA Forum and is really only rivaled by the Second show at Madison Square Gardens also in September. The embryonic version of Immigrant Song is incredible, lyrics almost seem improvised on the spot. Dazed and Confused is spellbinding and the acoustic That’s The Way is somehow intimate among the crowd of 150,000 people. What can be said of the incredible How Many More Times in its last time being book ended by the “oldies” medley, and what a medley it is. The Neil Young songs, the Elvis songs set the mood perfectly blending contemporary and classical. The last medley is frenzied and orgasmic, Long Tall Sally, Johnny B Goode, That’s All Right Mama…this, my friends, is real Rock and Roll. Rather quietly T2K has released two essential tapes in the past year, this new upgrade and the Peach recording of the famous 9/29/71 gig.\n\nAfter the dust had settled, the campaign was an obvious success and Robert had this to say, “We knew it was going to be a crucial thing. We went one and knew for the next two or three hours we were going to be the ones as far as holding our heads high. I think we weren’t into it until the acoustic number, when we all had a chance to sit down and take a look around. Then it was like clockwork. We looked at each other and we heard it was sounding good, and we looked down and everybody was grooving too”. Jimmy Page was equally moved, “There have been two or three magic gigs. Bath was one of them, because everything seemed to be right for us. The energy was monumental”. Last words go to one John Henry Bonham, “The atmosphere was fantastic really when you consider it was cold and windy. And even when it rained they sat through it and could still be happy. I didn’t think you could get an atmosphere like that at a concert”.\n\nAs previously reported, this new title features two gate fold sleeves house in a mini box. Each gate fold and box has its own OBI and there are three different covers to choose from. I chose the “Live Pics Box” and my number is 0042. I like the use of the less professional, rarer pictures used on the covers, the OBI of the Raw Source has a small reprint of a newspaper report entitled Bath Of The Blues, thus giving its name to this set. Each CD has a different picture on them, the Raw Source has two distant audience shots, the Mixdown Source has shots of Jimmy. First off I paid a reasonable price for this 4 disc set, always a plus as T2K has always been on the higher side of pricing. Secondly the packaging is great, something no one can argue about. Lastly this is a tremendous upgrade of an essential concert, now made even more enjoyable. From what I have been told, T2K has enlisted a new individual(s) to due their mastering and if this can be judged with this new release, we can expect good things from Tarantura in 2020.\n\nLed Zeppelin Listen To This Erik (1977)\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nThe Forum, Inglewood, CA, USA – June 21, 1977\n\nDisc 1 (70:03) Intro, The Song Remains The Same, Sick Again, Nobody’s Fault But Mine, Over The Hills And Far Away, Since I’ve Been Loving You, No Quarter\n\nDisc 2 (53:29) MC, Ten Years Gone, The Battle Of Evermore, Going To California, Black Country Woman, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, White Summer / BlackMountain Side, Kashmir\n\nDisc 3 (74:56) MC, Over The Top, Heartbreaker, Guitar Solo, Achilles Last Stand, Stairway To Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Rock And Roll\n\nIf there is one concert in Led Zeppelin’s illustrious touring history that has risen to almost mythical status it would probably be the famous June 21, 1977 date at the world famous LA Forum immortalized by taper Mike Millard. His vivid recording has come to be known after its bootleg name, “Listen To This Eddie” and features a performance that rivals its sound quality for sheer excellence. In fact the recording is so famous even Jimmy Page acknowledged its greatness and used a portion of the recording for a menu on the incredible 2003 DVD collection simply titled Led Zeppelin.\n\nIn the unofficial collectors circles there have been a massive amount of releases on both vinyl and compact disc, many of the compact disc versions use an alternate recording that fills small gaps, most famously in Ten Years Gone. Little is known about the alternate recording except all that circulates is Ten Years Gone, so one can assume that the full recording remains in the hands of hoarders. Much to our surprise, in November 2017 on a well known torrent site a third source for this legendary concert appeared under the moniker “Listen To This Erik”. With full acknowledgement of the original taper and his gift to the Led Zeppelin community, I think that it is appropriate to provide the background to the recording, its name, and the incredible work of the JEMS archivists that brought this new recording to the masses.\n\nSo this is directly from the torrent file:\n\n“Forty years after the band’s legendary performance, one of the most iconic Led Zeppelin bootlegs of all time, Listen To This Eddie, gets a companion with the first-ever release of GaryB’s mono master tapes from The Forum, June 21, 1977. This newly uncovered second recording of the show complements the work of legendary taper Mike Millard (whose tape is the source of the LTTE bootleg) to provide an alternative perspective and a fresh, compelling way to listen anew to this fantastic and familiar show. For decades, Millard’s recording stood as the only document of the show to surface, though GaryB and friends have been listening to his recording since the day after, especially his buddy Erik who, having taken some “mood enhancers” prior to the show, woke up the next day with almost no memory of what took place. Because Erik couldn’t remember much, GaryB titled his tape Listen To This Erik.\n\nGaryB’s title implies that he was familiar with the famous Eddie bootleg, and indeed he was. In fact, it was because of Millard’s tape/the Eddie bootleg that GaryB never felt there would be any desire for his recording, since he deemed the quality of Eddie to be superior to Erik. For that reason, his tape of the show went unheard by Zeppelin collectors at large until a couple months ago when, to recognize the show’s 40th anniversary, GaryB posted an incomplete and cobbled together MP3 of his tape to YouTube. The response from Zeppelin fans was immediate: WHERE DID THIS COME FROM and HOW CAN WE GET THIS?\n\nWhat Zep fans were responding to both in YouTube comments and on message boards was atmosphere. As great as Millard’s Led Zeppelin recordings are, one thing they don’t unmistakably capture is the electric atmosphere of the crowd, something those who were there remember so clearly. “From 8:15 to 9:45 pm,” GaryB recalls, “every time a song on the pre-show tape began to fade, the crowd started cheering. By the time they came on, insanity.” He continues: “The electricity of the crowd always stood out to me. Springsteen once said that the very word ‘concert’ means BOTH the audience and artist are engaged. On this night, both Zeppelin and the crowd brought their A game and the result was an epic show. I thought the band just fed off the crowd and kicked it up to a rarely seen level. Listen to the audience when Page is introduced: the ovation was crazy. I tell my wife and kids that when I’m old and I can’t remember anything, just put on my concert recording of 6/21/77 and I’ll have a huge smile on my face.”\n\nGaryB’s tape captures that atmosphere brilliantly from the get-go, as we get over 90 seconds of ecstatic audience build up before Jimmy hits that preamble chord then launches into “The Song Remains the Same.” There’s plenty of appealing audience response throughout, and while the quality of GaryB’s recording is not quite at Millard’s level, it is still better than many ’77 audies, sounding especially clear in quieter songs and holding up respectfully when the band is at full power. It was made on a borrowed recorder that we haven’t been able to fully identify, but GaryB says was a substantial piece of gear, with solid metal parts and a brown leather case. He knew he was in for a long show, so he snuck in two Memorex 120-minute tapes, which he says he copied off many years ago and avoided playing to help preserve them.\n\nDuring the show, GaryB and his brother Dave took turns holding the recorder, which had to be held up relatively high all night because the microphone was built in. Gary adds, “Like me, Dave also had to keep quiet the whole show because we were taping. Very hard not to react on a night like that!” The YouTube and message board posts prompted Gary to seek someone who could properly transfer the masters and JEMS was lucky enough to be recommended for the gig by our dear friend BW with whom I had the following email exchange:\n\n(September 25, 2017 at 5:48 PM) Fwd: Led Zeppelin 1977 Forum recording\n\nJust got this email request. Is it something you would be interested in doing?\n\n(September 25, 2017 at 5:52 PM) Re: Led Zeppelin 1977 Forum recording\n\nAbsolutely! I am the man for the job.\n\n(September 25, 2017 at 5:54 PM) Re: Led Zeppelin 1977 Forum recording\n\nWow, what took you so long to respond?\n\nGary shipped the tapes to JEMS South and the work began. Those who have experience with 40-year-old, 120-minute cassette tapes know they are temperamental to say the least. GaryB had re-shelled one of the tapes (i.e. moved the actual interior tape and reels from the original cassette shell into a newer one) at some point in the past and that needed to be done again, as the pressure pad was gone on tape two and it wasn’t running smoothly. The new shell helped, but it still took multiple passes and a lot of hand-winding to capture the entirety of both sides. Tape one, while fussy in its own ways, played through relatively well given its age, the condition of its original shell and pad still viable. With great relief, I informed GaryB that the transfer was successful.\n\nBut there was still plenty to do. We have taken the rare step of noting this recording as “restored.” This is due to the work undertaken to repair several dozen short audio dropouts (likely due to movement of the tape deck during the show) inherent in the master. Using the latest iZotope RX software, we were able to fix the dropouts in a manner that should be relatively transparent to many listeners in most instances and substantially lessens the auditory defect. The manner of recording also required re-sequencing of parts and multiple pitch adjustments have been made to fix speed issues throughout, though most pronounced in the show’s final 30 minutes (“Achilles” to the end) when batteries were beginning to fail, slowing the recording, which then sounds sped up on normal playback. The fixes aren’t perfect by any means, as the speed change grows highly variable, but they are a marked improvement to the original.\n\nWe are presenting the final product in two forms. For the 16/44.1 edition, we have mastered GaryB’s restored recording to offer what in our opinion is a high-quality listening experience. For the purists out there (and surely to the delight of many Japanese bootleg labels: Maido arigatou gozaimasu!), we present a high-resolution, 24/96 restored but unmastered edition.\n\nSpeaking of Japanese bootlegs, there is a title which patches the missing portion of “Ten Years Gone” on Millard’s recording with a second source, but no other audio of the second source was released. We don’t believe GaryB’s tape was the mystery source, but we hope a knowledgeable collector will let everyone know.\n\nThis project was a labor of love for me and everyone involved. First and foremost, GaryB has been an absolute pleasure to work with and get to know. It is through his generosity that we get to hear a different version of one of our favorite Zeppelin shows of all time. Thanks for trusting JEMS, Gary. We hope you like the result. Thanks as well to BW, who made the introduction to GaryB and whom I love dearly. The stalwart mjk5110 stepped up as he always does, this time contributing critical feedback and countless hours to fix the pitch and speed issues in addition to his vital, on-going, post-production support. I would also like to recognize the work of the late Mike Millard, whose recording of this show and so many others have been critical listening to Zeppelin fans since the ‘70s. Over the years, we have met folks who knew Mike personally (including our own Stan, the S in JEMS), and they tell us that the Mike Millard described on the internet is not man they knew. He had many good friends and wasn’t at all the dour loner those descriptions would have us believe. Here’s to another amazing example of finding “lost tapes.” Let’s hope there are still many more to come”.\n\nGreat story, I really enjoy listening to tales of old tapers and history of their experiences from back in the day, where houses of the holy were filled with rabid rock fans there to enjoy the music. No cell phones and other distractions, back when it seemed music was the only thing that mattered. Let’s get into sound quality of GaryB’s tape. It is more distant that Millard’s but is very clear with a nice range of frequencies, there are occasional changes in sound as GaryB and his brother took turns holding the recorder coupled with the movement of the crowd being the culprits. All instruments and vocals are clear and you get a really nice music to audience mix, in fact that is one of the highlights of this tape, we all knew that the first show in Los Angeles was incredible, this recording give more of a complete perspective from a fans view so to speak. The band and audience seem to have a conjoined existence at this concert, the band gives off great vibes, the audience gives off great vibes and the whole thing is like an orgy of ones aural senses.\n\nThe tape had some issues, most of them were addressed by the JEMS group, the speed reconstruction is certainly the work of gifted hands, so cheers to them. The other issues were the tape cuts, JEMS left them alone so the folks at No Label have addressed them by using Mike Millard’s recording to fill the gaps. The first gap comes in at 12:27 to 12:45 in No Quarter, the GaryB recording during the John Paul Jones Grand Piano solo is very clear so the switch of recordings is not harsh to ones ears. There is another 15 second gaps during Robert’s introduction and the first seven seconds of Ten Years Gone. There are several tape cuts on the third disc, first one being in Heartbreaker, first from 3:09 to 4:58 then from 5:08 to the last three and half minutes of the song as well as 30 seconds of crowd noise and the complete 16:31 of Page’s guitar solo and the first 48 seconds Achilles Last Stand followed by another cut from 8:53 that lasts from the last 25 seconds of the song until the beginning of Stairway To Heaven. Not done yet, there is a cut in Stairway from 10:22 to 10:36 right in the hard rocking section. The edits are very well done, the transitions from tape to tape is seamless although at times a few are noticeable due to the difference in sound quality between the two.\n\nWhat can one say about this famous concert? Certainly top three concerts from 1977 and for most, top ten concerts from Led Zeppelin’s entire live career, it’s just that good. This recording really gives you the vibe of being at a shit hot Led Zeppelin concert, there are the occasional comments near the taper, or possibly even by the taper and his friends as one would expect. Very rarely in 1977 do you get a great recording of a superb performance, other than the second night in Cleveland and the other Millard recordings from LA come to mind. This is not to say there were not other great concerts on this tour, there are, but most have average audience recordings or the rather dry soundboards. I read an interesting comment about the soundboards, someone was commenting on Page’s thin sound and another person chimed in about Page’s use of the ambient hall to give him the fuller sound you hear on many audience recordings, makes sense I guess. This concert was one of the first I bought years back, on vinyl picture disc Listen To This Eddie (Rock Solid RSR 202A-B), for those who have it page 261 of Robert Goodwin’s 3rd Edition Illustrated Collectors Guide To Led Zeppelin, (boy I wish I didn’t sell my old vinyl) and like most others, has been a favorite for the past three decades.\n\nThe packaging is typical for the No Label titles, full color inserts featuring live shots of the band circa 1977, picture CD’s, numbered sticker all housed in a fat boy jewel case and at least where I bought this from, very reasonably priced. A very nicely produced title and while the thanks goes to GaryB and JEMS for their work, the folks at No Label have done a nice job honoring this new recording, if you love the Millard recording, you will certainly enjoy this alternate view.\n\nBruce Springsteen You Can Trust Your Car To The Man Who Wears The Star (1975)\n\nFrom theamazingkornyfonelabel.wordpress.com\n\nBruce Springsteen Live at the Main Point, Bryan Mawr, Pennsylvania, February 5th, 1975\n\nFM Broadcast on WMMR – A Main Point benefit show. This was the premiere of Thunder Road, actually called Wings For Wheels at this time and of both Back In The USA and Mountain Of Love.\n\nAlso with early live versions of Born To Run and Jungleland, and a amazing cover of Dylan’s I Want You.\n\nIntro, Incident on 57th Street, Mountain Of Love, Born To Run, The E Street Shuffle, Wings For Wheels (Thunder Road), I Want You, Spirit In The Night, She’s The One, Growin’ Up, It’s Hard To Be A Saint In The City, Jungleland, Kitty’s Back\n\nThe concert continued with: New York City Serenade, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight), 4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy), A Love So Fine [incorporating Shout], For You, Back In The USA.\n\nFrom collectorsmusic.com: “one of the most legendary shows of Bruce’s career.” The Brucebase website refers to it as “one of the most compelling performances of Springsteen’s entire career.” Lynn Elder’s guide to early Springsteen bootleg CDs, You Better Not Touch, agrees, stating that “the show easily ranks as one of Bruce’s best ever.” Clinton Heylin, in The Great White Wonders, refers to it as a “testament to Springsteen at-his-peak.” The first twelve songs initially appeared on the LP You can Trust Your Car To The Man Who Wears The Star (SODD, later TAKRL). The show was broadcast on WMMR-FM and the incomplete LP version obviously utilized an off-air tape, extremely listenable but not quite top-notch in sound quality. There were small cuts during the opening bars of Incident On 57th Street caused by the excision of some talking by a DJ.\n\nWMMR DJ Ed Sciaky, who introduced the concert, explained how it was recorded and broadcast in issue number 82 of Backstreets magazine: “We didn’t have a phone line from the Main Point, so they had to tape the show in hour-long segments and then drive them to the station and put them on air.”\n\nSome background information regarding the source tapes:\n\nWhen it comes to ranking the all-time, top-10 Springsteen concerts/concert recordings, there are vigorous debates about which Darkness tour shows belong (Passaic vs. Winterland vs. Agora vs. Portland), and even a heralded performance like A Night For Vietnam Veterans (August 20, 1981) has its detractors, those who claim it wasn’t even the best show in that five-night LA run. But NO Bruce collector in her right mind would quibble with the inclusion of The Main Point, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, February 5, 1975.\n\nIt is–as it should be–on any sane fan’s list of Bruce’s greatest shows and rightly so. The Main Point captures the best-recorded transition performance between two splendid eras, previewing new material for what would become Born to Run while still delivering epic readings of early songs like “Kitty’s Back” and “New York City Serenade” (the latter, arguably, in its definitive live performance).\n\nThen there’s the addition of Suki Lahav. She–the short-tenured, one-woman string section of the E Street Band–makes jaw-droppingly sublime contributions to the show-opening “Incident on 57th Street” and the striking cover of Bob Dylan’s “I Want You.” Throw in “Wings for Wheels” (the proto “Thunder Road”), “Mountain of Love,” “A Love So Fine,” “Back in the USA” and the rest, and you have a show for the ages.\n\nThe Main Point’s place in the pantheon is greatly aided by the fact that a recording of the complete set has been available for the last four decades thanks to its same-night (though not live-as-it-happened) broadcast on WMMR Philadelphia. In fact, Bruce and the band’s appearance was a benefit for the Main Point itself and the station solicited for donations to be made by phone during the broadcast. The gig happened at the request of WMMR deejay and key early supporter, Ed Sciaky, who serves as the night’s master of ceremonies and is mentioned several times by Bruce in the show.\n\nThe bootleg history of the Main Point show is a long one indeed. The show was available in edited form on vinyl by the late ’70s and tapes of the full broadcast were in modest circulation earlier than that. Awareness of the show really soared in the bootleg CD era, when pioneering Italian label and Springsteen specialists Great Dane Records released the show on the cleverly titled two-CD set The Saint, The Incident & The Main Point Shuffle.\n\nThat boot utilized the commonly circulated recording of the broadcast that had been around for years and was presumably made by a fan in Philly. But the Main Point has never been a tape traded with a known lineage. Evidence suggests that every copy of the show to circulate or see release since all trace back to the same, original, off-air recording first heard on the vinyl boot. The tape edits are the same wherever it has appeared.\n\nAs outlined clearly in the entry for this show on the awesome Brucebase Wiki, the broadcast that night was unusual. As noted above, the show was not aired live, but instead reel-to-reel tapes were rolling at the venue and when the first reel was complete, someone ran it over to WMMR where it was played over the air creating a one-to-two hour delay.\n\nThe next point is one of modest conjecture, but the basic notion is accurate: at some point in the audio chain between the original recording at the venue and the tape being played back on a reel to reel through the mixing board at the station and over the air, a limiter or some type of auto-leveler was introduced. A limiter automatically adjusts recording levels when the volume goes above a prescribed point. It can help smooth out dynamic material that has unexpected peaks in sound levels and prevent over-recording. An auto-leveler does the same thing but adjusts for highs and lows.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the limiter/leveler employed on the Main Point broadcast was extremely aggressive. When you listen to the FM recording, there are dozens if not hundreds of instances where the level change is audible. Worse still, not only do levels change jarringly at times, but the limiter/leveler itself seems to add a slight clicking sound in spots.\n\nA couple of years after the Great Dane release, a minor miracle occurred. A 10-inch tape reel of the first 90 minutes of the Main Point show made its way into collectors’ hands. This reel contained a pre-FM recording of the show, often presumed to be the very tape that was walked over from the venue to the station (though given that it was recorded on both sides and not one, it is very likely a safety copied from the production reels after the fact).\n\nOn this recording there is no limiter and the sound quality is far superior to the much more compressed off-air recording. It is a gorgeous, stereo spectacle that made this already special show all the more special. The only disappointment is that the recording was not of the entire show. The last 70 or so minutes of the performance, or what’s presumably on a second reel, were never found from the pre-FM source.\n\nBut that upgraded 90 minutes spurred a host of new releases, including the first “Masters Plus” reissue by Great Dane itself, which paired the new 90 pre-FM with the original, FM-sourced remainder of the show. Others followed suit, like You Can Trust Your Car to The Man Who Wears a Star (Labour of Love), which used the new and old tape sources and packaged up the CDs to look like the original vinyl boot of the same name. The fan release Prodigal Son at the Main Point attempted to remaster the same sources. Some consider it the best version of the show to date. And Crystal Cat took its own stab at remastering on Main Point Night. Then, earlier this year, yet another version of the Main Point surfaced, as, exploiting a supposed loophole in UK copyright law, British label Left Field Media issued Live at the Main Point as a quasi-official though unauthorized two-CD set. But they too had to work with the same stuff and simply nicked their master from an extant bootleg.\n\nThe catch with every Main Point CD to date is that each relies on the same source for the last 70 minutes of the show, that original, well-circulated, off-air fan recording of unknown generation. And while we’ve all hoped or prayed that someday a pre-FM source of the end of the show would appear to match the start, 36 years later we’re still listening to the same old recording. Until now.\n\nEarlier this year, a box of reel-to-reel tapes was obtained from a home-taping enthusiast who lived in Philadelphia in the ’70s. Using his Tandberg 3300 tape deck, the man recorded several live radio broadcasts over the years, preserving the shows on reel at 3-3/4 IPS. The tapes had not been played since the late ’70s and one of them, as luck would have it, was of WMMR’s Main Point broadcast, captured as it happened that night. A fresh, azimuth-adjusted transfer was made and the recording was then speed-correct, de-clicked, phase-corrected and ever-so-lightly mastered to make it sound as good as possible.\n\nNow before anyone gets too excited, this master recording of the broadcast still has the limiter issues of the prior source (only a pre-FM would fix that) and there’s still slight distortion at the climax of “NYC Serenade.” But guess what, it sounds better. Materially better. Not pre-FM better, but in moments you might confuse it with the first set. Says one knowledgeable and trusted collector: “There is absolutely no comparison between the master FM reel and the Prodigal Son version. This new one sounds so much smoother and warmer and fuller. And the PS version has some sections in mono, as well.” It is wide stereo here.\n\nAnd while it contains no additional music, the new recording does add some deejay chatter, station IDs and closing credits that must have been edited out of the original source.\n\nSo for now, until the Angel of Pre-FMs answers our prayers, this upgrade offers the best version to date of those amazing last 70+ minutes of the Main Point. The switch from pre-FM to FM occurs around the 8:14 point in “Kitty’s Back” and you’ll have no trouble noticing. The first couple minutes of the new FM source seem to be its weakest (also the case on the circulating source), but give it a longer listen and you’ll start to realize just how good it is and what an improvement it is on that same old tape we’ve all been hoping would sound better some day. Now it does. Samples provided.\n\nWe’ve chosen to present this recording as a straight-up replacement for disc two of Prodigal Son. It begins exactly where Disc Two of that set does, so, if you like this, you can swap it out for that disc and you’ll have the best possible complete show.\n\nGenesis – Man On The Hammersmith (1982)\n\nHammersmith Odeon, London, England – September 29th, 1982\n\nDisc 1 (70:18): Dance On A Volcano, Behind The Lines, Follow You Follow Me, MC, Dodo / Lurker, Abacab, MC, Supper’s Ready, Misunderstanding, Man On The Corner, Who Dunnit?\n\nDisc 2 (51:15): Band Introductions, In The Cage, The Cinema Show, Slippermen Of The Colony (Raven), Afterglow, Turn It On Again, Drum Duet, Los Endos, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Watcher Of The Skies, I Know What I Like\n\nGenesis’ Three Sides Live Tour aka Encore Tour ended with four shows in London. They played a wild show at the Marquee for old time’s sake followed by three at the Hammersmith Odeon on September 28th, 29th, and on the 30th.\n\nMan On The Hammersmith is the first silver pressed edition of the September 29th and the first from the three to appear from any of the Hammersmith shows since Highland’s horrid release of the September 30th show on Man On The Corner (HL 548/549).\n\nVirtuoso contains an excellent stereo audience tape of the entire show. There are a few cuts between numbers but no music is lost and is a great overall document of the show.\n\nThe Encore tour was a bit odd because Genesis weren’t promoting a new studio album. The live album Three Sides Live came out in June 1982 with three sides of live material and a fourth with several new songs, but none of the new songs were regular inclusions in the set. (The New York performance of “Paperlate” the only real exception).\n\nDuring the afternoon of this show the band rehearsed the reunion gig with Peter Gabriel. “Dance On A Volcano” was moved up to the opening number from the finale followed by the “Behind The Lines” from Duke and “Follow You, Follow Me” from And Then There Were Three.\n\nAfter Phil Collins greets the audience with his usual humor, they play the two long and bizarre epics from Abacab, “Dodo / Lurker” and “Abacab.” And, after speaking about the band’s tenth anniversary, introduces “Supper’s Ready.” This is the first time the Foxtrot epic was a regular part of the setlist since the Wind & Wuthering tour in 1977. “Carpet Crawlers,” “Me And Sarah Jane,” “No Reply At All” and “Firth Of Fifth” were dropped to make room for the reintroduction of the epic to the setlist. This would be one of the final performances of the entire piece live.\n\nThe hit “Misunderstanding” follows as does the relatively quiet “Man On The Corner.” After “Who Dunnit?” Collins jokes with the audience, asking if they are enjoying their dinner and introducing the band including Daryl Stuermer, who came on tour with only his pajamas.\n\nA complete “In The Cage” from Lamb Lies Down On Broadway starts the big oldies medley. The segue into the fast instrumental and ending of “The Cinema Show” which goes into a bit of the instrumental “Slippermen Of The Colony (Raven)” and ending with a majestic “Afterglow.”\n\n“Turn It On Again,” played the same as on the Duke and Abacab tours, segues into the drum duet and the show’s finale “Los Endos.” It’s great to hear the start and end of the show derived from their masterpiece A Trick Of A Tail. The encore starts with “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway” and, after some variations in melody and key changes segues into the short instrumental version of “Watcher Of The Skies.”\n\n“I Know What I Like,” turned into a quasi football chant, closes the show.\n\nMan On The Hammersmith comes packaged in a double slimline jewel case. The artwork is inspired both by the Three Sides Live official live album release and the “Man On The Corner” single. It has a great performance and is a rare silver from Genesis’ semi-prog period in the very early eighties.\n\nLed Zeppelin – Amazing Second Detroit Tape – July 13, 1973\n\nCobo Hall, Detroit, MI – July 13, 1973\n\nDisc 1 (65:59) Intro, Rock And Roll, Celebration Day, Black Dog, Over The Hills And Far Away, Misty Mountain Hop, Since I’ve Been Loving You, No Quarter, The Song Remains The Same, The Rain Song\n\nDisc 2 (73:44) Dazed And Confused, Stairway To Heaven, Moby Dick\n\nDisc 3 (29:00) Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love, Dancing Days\n\nBonus CD-R (54:03) Moby Dick, Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love, Dancing Days\n\nIt was quite a blessing when The Dogs Of Doom unearthed a near complete audience recording from Led Zeppelin’s second night at Detroit’s famous Cobo Arena in 1973. The only known recording up to that point was an incomplete soundboard tape of the last hour of the show made famous for the inclusion of the only known recording of Dancing Days played as the encore, and sadly incomplete. While the second leg on the 1973 North American tour started off a little slow, the band quickly returned to form and turned in two excellent concerts in the Motor City.\n\nThis new source is an audience source that is near complete save for a few gaps due to tape flips and according to the original torrent was recorded by a fellow named Jon Anthony. The transfer was not done from the master tapes as they do not exist anymore, so this version comes from probably a second generation source. The quality of this recording is in the very good range, it is a bit distant and picks up just a bit of the echo of the hall. It is clear enough that all of the instruments and vocals are clear in the mix, Plant’s vocals are more prominent than the instruments yet once the recording settles down all are easily discernible. There is also a small amount of tape hiss present but certainly does not interfere with ones listening enjoyment and certainly should be expected of a recording, and tape generation, of this age.\n\nThere are a few titles available with this material, Detroit 1973 2nd Night (No Label), Friday The 13th (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD 1401/1402/1403/1404), Motor City Daze (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD 1401/1402/1403/1404), The Last Dancing Daze In Electric Form (Tarantura TCD-213-ZOSO), and Detroit Rock City 1973 Volume 2 (Graf Zeppelin LZSC-713A/B/C/D). For this review I will be using the Graf Zeppelin for comparison. First off the sound on this Wisteria title is really nice, it has a natural sound and is not overdone. It has the same volume levels as the Graf Zeppelin title with less hiss, so some noise reduction was done, but gently as too much will begin to give that metallic sound in its place. To my ears I hear just a tad more depth in the Graf Zeppelin, other than that both sound really nice. Wisteria has a few digital remnants during track changes and for some reason have made small cuts on the first disc removing about 12 seconds of tape between songs on the first disc. The cuts are difficult to hear and one has to time the between song distance to catch it, Bootledz evaluation of this title notes a digital tick during Whole Lotta Love, I did not detect one on my copy. This Wisteria title also came with a bonus CD-R of the soundboard source, like the audience source Wisteria has done noise reduction work and while the hiss is slightly less, it loses the warmth and depth found on the Graf version of the SB.\n\nThis recording follows the pattern of the other 1973 concerts, the opening of Rock And Roll into Celebration Day into Black Dog shows the band getting into the concert early on, the second night in the Motor City finds the band in a relaxed mood and the music flows nicely. “Good evening…well the way we are feeling I think we better welcome you to Detroit…last night we did the same gig here and it was and it was truly fine”, confirmation by Plant himself on the excellent first night in Detroit. He does try and set ground rules for this evening, “Listen I tell you what, before we start let’s have a little pact. We’ll play our balls off, you stop throwing those fire crackers and torches alright?”, getting the response he wants the band go into “A track off Houses of the Holy…it bares reference to…well to existence”, or as we know it Over The Hills And Far Away. It should be noted that due to the distance of the recording, I did not detect any loud explosions during the opening numbers but it was mid July in Detroit so shenanigans were certainly abound.\n\nIt seems like the Detroit crowd was arriving fashionably late as described during Robert’s introduction to Misty Mountain Hop, Robert turns in a fine vocal performance during Since I’ve Been Loving You, Page is still playing well but not pushing it although the heat is rising. Things begin to warm with an excellent No Quarter, Page turns in a perfect solo that seems to weave through the dry ice fog of Cobo Arena and rises to the sound surface just before the cut at the 7:05 mark, not much is lost and the sound improves slightly perhaps due to mic repositioning. There is some really nice interplay between Page, Bonham, and Jones and the solo after the tape flip is very exploratory with the musicians in sync with each other…fantastic. Plant pays homage to the Grande Ballroom and dedicates The Song Remains The Same to the hallowed Detroit concert venue immortalized on the MC5’s Kick Out The Jams record. Divine inspiration? Perhaps as the band begins to kick into high gear playing stellar versions of TSRTS and The Rain Song, a fact that is acknowledged by the audience who gives the pieces a fine ovation.\n\n“Meanwhile back in the jungle…” is the lead into Dazed And Confused, Jonsey’s first bass notes elicit a loud ovation from the audience and we prepare for an excellent and exploratory version of the song. Plant’s vocals during San Francisco and prior to the bow solo are wonderful, Bonzo is right there and punctuates Page’s movements to perfection while, at times, directing the flow. Page gets into some interesting rhythm patterns prior and during the tape cut at the 21:58 mark that evolves into the breaks and response section. Jimmy’s playing is very fluent during the songs entire 33 minute length, this version rivals the best of the tour. As usual Stairway To Heaven garners a massive response from the crowd, by this point the song is excellent on every night and is a celebration of the Holy.\n\nMoby Dick clocks in at close to a half hour, the crowd seem a little bored about 10 minutes in and several loud explosions are heard, leftovers from the 4th of July no doubt. While the audience tire easily, Bonzo keeps up a great pace and his solo is actually very entertaining, an overture of pounding rhythms at their finest. His solo gives time for some quiet commentary that provide the location of the taper being in the upper seating deck as a woman comments she “can’t walk” and further comments of the steep stairs. The cut at the 22:22 mark is not noticeable and had I not known it was there would not have caught it, hidden in the hand tympani portion. “John Bonham…The only drummer left in Rock”, our dear John only takes a minute break then leads the group into a fat version of Heartbreaker. Five minutes in, Jimmy breaks into a bit of Bring It On Home much to the delight of the audience, he then leads back into Heartbreaker and rips into a fantastic solo.\n\nEven in its condensed North American arrangement, Whole Lotta Love still delivers, during the Boogie Chillun section Robert gets into some Elvis inspired vocals much to my delight (I am a big fan of The King), and Jimmy’s soloing is incredibly fluent and delightful. The band return to play “One more….a track from Houses Of The Holy. It’s about the sort of the fetish for fifteen sixteen year old chicks who seem to wait at bus stops after they come out of high school…it’s called Dancing Days”, Robert’s intro is met with many cheers of approval. Finally we get the only complete version of the track from the North American tour, the recording quality is at its peak as well so this is extremely enjoyable to have this version in this quality, and also a great way to end an excellent two day stop in Detroit.\n\nThe packaging is full color inserts with live photos of the band, the rear cover has a photo and write up from the Detroit press which is a nice addition. This is all housed in a fat boy jewel case plus let’s not forget the OBI, the folks at the Wisteria Lodge turn out nice looking product. This is a nice sounding version of the tape, as I have said before, if they would tighten up their quality just a tad, this would rival the Graf Zeppelin as best version of this show but tape cuts and digital noise at track changes let this title fall short.\n\nLed Zeppelin – Winter In Winterland 1969 (2021)\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com\n\nWinterland Ballroom, San Francisco, CA – November 07, 1969\n\nDisc 1 (55:26) Tune Up, Good Times Bad Times, Communication Breakdown, I Can’t Quit You Baby, Heartbreaker, Dazed And Confused, White Summer / Black Mountain Side\n\nDisc 2 (63:42) Babe I’m Gonna Leave You, What Is And What Should Never Be, Moby Dick, How Many More Times, Bring It On Home\n\nIn March 2021 The Dogs Of Doom released an alternate recording for Led Zeppelin’s November 7, 1969 performance at San Francisco’s 5,400 seat Winterland Ballroom, the venue operated by the famous promoter Bill Graham. The first recording has circulated for years and has seen a number of releases, Winter Of Our Content (Missing Link ML-008/9), Room 2/3 (Image Quality IQ-019/20/21), Good Old Led Zeppelin (Tarantura TCD-89-92), and Final Winterland (The Chronicles Of Led Zeppelin TCOLZ 064-069). The first source is an incomplete recording that suffers from distortion and speed fluctuations yet easily falls in the good range.\n\nThe new source is a nearly complete very good sounding recording that is slightly distant yet very clear and detailed with excellent balance, all instruments and vocals clear in the mix. The concert was recorded by Gerry Olsen using a Sony TC-124 cassette deck and a Sony F-99S Stereo mic, Gerry is also responsible for the transfer. This recording was quickly released as Final Winterland 1969 2nd Night (No Label), Rare Magic (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD-1445/1446), Return To San Francisco (Graf Zeppelin LZSC-1107A/B/C/D), and this title from Wisteria. Tarantura has released their version of the recording along with the November 6, 1969 concert in a box set called Stand Up, Sit Down Up There Settle Down (Tarantura TCD-214-1/2 ~ 215-1/2).\n\nThis new title from Wisteria uses the newly discovered source 2 as a foundation and fills a gap in Moby Dick with source 1. Like the two other Wisteria titles I’ve reviewed, this new Winterland title also has small cuts in the recording, 10 seconds of the intro, and an additional 20 seconds from between songs. I also detect digital debris at a few track changes, while not a deal killer, they are there regardless. The sound on this title is nicely done, there are no signs where heavy handed mastering can be heard. The large cut from 1:30 to 12:16 during Moby Dick is filled with source 1 and is well done, so the mastering is good save the removal of tape.\n\nThis is the last known recording from North America in what was an important and highly successful year for Led Zeppelin, to play their last gigs in the city that embraced them earlier in the year was fitting. Many other reviewers tell of the importance of the bombastic beginning of the late 1969 concerts that began with Good Times, Bad Times for good reason, it’s so powerful and you get a feel for that in this recording. Just before the band begin there are shouts of “Sit down” then the band begin and a huge cheer comes up from the crowd. Communication Breakdown weaves in like a bullet and the Zeppelin is off in full flight, Jimmy’s solo is perfect and the band is on. A wonderful relaxed I Can’t Quit You Baby follows, Page’s leads flow from his finger tips, at times Plant seems just a half step behind. The audience responds with cheers during the quiet sections, relaxed intensity. Heartbreaker is muscular, there are a few cheers and claps, there are certainly a few people who picked up the recently released second album in attendance, love Robert’s deep voice on this version.\n\nA disturbance can be heard in the distance at the beginning of Dazed And Confused, so much for the laid back West Coast Bay Area vibe, it is a prelude to a mysterious Dazed And Confused. During the bow solo Jimmy starts a riff and the band follows then goes back into the bow solo with Bonzo highlighting with a few smashes from his gong, this only mildly interests the crowd near the taper as some chatting is heard, the band soon quiets them with sheer power. There is a little damage at the 13:53 mark that is short, like the tape got eaten, thankfully it’s short, this is followed by Jimmy going into the stratosphere. White Summer clocks in at nearly 15 minutes but never gets boring, in fact Jimmy seems to be trying different rhythmic combinations with Bonham that are quit effective.\n\nThis is the last recorded version of Babe I’m Going To Leave, the only other documented recording after this is from the second show in Hawaii on September 6, 1970, while there is no audio there is a very short video snippet. The band begin What Is And What Should Never Be to no applause, curious as Led Zeppelin II had been released a few weeks prior. The benefit of this new recording is we finally get the complete How Many More Times with Robert introducing the band during the Jazzy prelude. The instrumental passage that lead up to Rosie is excellent, Page solos effortlessly and Plant interjects lyrics known, like Neil Young’s Down By The River “Be on my side I’ll be on your side…” to obscure moans seemingly to just get off before getting into the medley properly. Boogie Chillun’ goes into Move On Down The Line, Plant is interjecting lyrics at will leading into a very powerful Bottle Up And Go that evolves into the Squeeze My Lemon lyrics, from the sound it receives a rather lackluster response. The audience is digging the show though as Robert has no issues getting them to shout along to “I got you in….” that leads into the How Many More Times reprise, Page does some interesting tuning with his guitar that sounds like Jimi Hendrix joined them onstage.\n\nThe biggest revelation on this recording is not the excellent How Many More Times medley, it’s the encore of Bring It On Home making its only known appearance in 1969. Clocking in at just over nine minutes the song is everything we expect it to be and one has to wonder if they had played it previously. The beginning riff harmonica jam is great and gets the audience clapping along. There is no hesitation, just pure beautiful playing that sounds confident and Rocks hard, John Bonham’s drumming is excellent playing rapid fire during portions punctuating the riffs. He gets into a drum guitar battle in the middle that equals the Robert Jimmy guitar vs. harmonica that follows. What a great surprise to have this early version and this recording helps better define what an excellent concert this was, Zep was flying high!\n\nThe front cover shot of Page is not from 1969, nor the one on the interior cover, the rear tray shots are from 1969, the gig poster is on the back also, always liked it with massive Zeppelin in the holding bay. This release also comes with a CD-R of the recently surfaced third audience source from the Texas Pop 8/31/1969 recording, like their other releases, the label has cropped off nearly a minute from the recording. I didn’t put any times listening to this as it’s a CD-R but found the sound to be consistent with the original torrent. These Wisteria titles could be very nice, they are doing a great job with the sound but the needless cuts will keep their titles from being considered definitive.\n\nLed Zeppelin – Atlanta International Pop Festival 1969\n\nFrom collectorsmusicreviews.com March 17 2021\n\nAtlanta International Speedway, Hampton, Georgia, USA – July 5, 1975\n\n(41:40) The Train Kept A Rollin’, I Can’t Quit You Baby, Dazed And Confused, White Summer / Black Mountain Side, You Shook Me\n\nThere is a new team whose objective is to actively seek out Led Zeppelin material that is completely new to circulation, this collective is aptly named The Dogs Of Doom. They are hitting Led Zeppelin aficionados fast and furious with both audio and video, all of which has not previously circulated freely. Let’s take a look at their output for just 2021, Volume 1 audio recording of Led Zeppelin’s performance at the Atlanta Pop Festival in 1969, Vol 2 is 8mm film footage of the Detroit Olympia 1/31/1975 concert, Vol. 3 is a fourth source for Jimmy Page’s Manchester UK 11/26/1988 audio source, Vol. 4 is Auckland 2/25/1972 8mm film footage, Vol. 5 is a third audio source for the Sydney Australia 2/27/1972 concert featuring Immigrant Song and Heartbreaker, both of which were missing from the previous two sources. Vol. 6 features other artists from the 1969 Atlanta Pop Festival including Johnny Winter, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Janis Joplin and others, and most recently, Vol. 7 which features a second source for the 11/7/1969 Winterland Ballroom concert that is much longer and features a complete How Many More Times and encore of Bring It On Home. Previous year releases have included the incredible 8mm footage from the first Cleveland show 4/27/1977 and the second source for Glasgow 12/4/1972.\n\nThis new title from the Graf Zeppelin features the audio from the Atlanta Pop Festival in 1969, and is a reason to celebrate as there has not been a new Zeppelin recording to surface for eight years, that previous recording was the excellent Piston ’70 Chantenay-Malabry, France Dec. 6, 1969 concert. This new recording from the Atlanta Pop Festival in 1969 was shared on various torrent sites freely and was only a matter of time before it hit the collectors market. Atlanta Pop Festival 1969 (No Label), Rocks In Atlanta (Empress Valley Supreme disc EVSD), and Atlanta International Pop Festival 1969 (Graf Zeppelin LZSC-705), all feature this recording. I made the easy decision and went for the Graf Zeppelin title, the subject of this review.\n\nThe sound quality of this new audience recording is very good, slightly distant with the individual instruments clearly discernible in the mix. There is just a very minor amount of tape hiss as one would expect from a recording of this age. The recording is also incomplete, the taper recorded all of Led Zeppelin’s set but at some point accidentally erased some, the missing songs are most certainly How Many More Times and the encore of Communication Breakdown. He also paused the machine between songs so some commentary is missing. The Graf Zeppelin typically excellent mastering shines on this release, increasing the sound just a tad and slight sound adjustments that smooth out the original recording.\n\nThis is the first concert of the tour and the performance is in line with the others from the summer of 1969, Led Zeppelin fully in control of their music and live presentation. The intro of The Train Kept A Rollin’ comes fast and in contrast to the slow blues of I Can’t Quit You Baby. One would think that the blues would be calming but this is a festival and there are some distant conversations going on and cries of “Sit down” are heard. Robert is singing a lusty version of I Can’t Quit You, after listening to a lot of 1975 and 77 shows recently, hearing this primal music is a breath of fresh air. Jimmy’s playing is exquisitely fluent and not overplayed one bit as he easily manoeuvers between the leads and simple riff.\n\nDazed And Confused clocks in at 11 and a half minutes, again Robert is feeling it and is turning in a fine vocal performance. His Blues meet scat vocals are effective and seem to be calling out to Jimmy’s guitar waiting for the response. Jimmy plays a variation of Over Under Sideways Down during the post solo fast section just before moving back into the main theme, compact yet wickedly good version. White Summer / Black Mountain Side gives the audience a bit of time to chat, not even when Page breaks into Black Mountain Side do they stop. You Shook Me is introduced as a thing by Muddy Waters and features Plant on Harmonica. Like I Can’t Quit You, the blues was the foundation of the 1969 sets and features some of the most enjoyable playing of the concert, relaxed but intense. Shouts of sit down sound menacing, the casual festival atmosphere certainly irritating those who came to listen in the pre cell phone age nonetheless. John Bonham is inspired and is laying down some tasty fills as Jimmy and Robert on harmonica riff back and forth, the whole thing ends with Robert almost whispering the lyrics much to the delight of the audience, the recording ends as the final note is played. My copy is a two disc set, the second disc is a CD-R of the recording sans the mastering, interesting to compare the two but after a couple listens I go back to the mastered version, it’s better.\n\nThe packaging is great, the inserts all pay tribute to the event. The front cover is taken from the event poster and the rest are actual pictures from the concert itself. Small stage on a hot day, a couple pictures show Robert without a shirt, something you don’t see a lot, Jimmy in hot dark pink pants with a light pink shirt, or is it salmon colored? Yes there is a numbered sticker and picture on the disc, the whole kit and caboodle housed in a slim lined jewel case. A great, new addition to the Live Zeppelin cannon, for the committed this recording is a must have."
