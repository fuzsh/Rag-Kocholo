        "text": "King Crimson is not a single band, but rather the name given to a series of bands with one common member (uber-guitarist Robert Fripp, who has only sometimes been the primary creative force of the group). Love them or hate them (and believe me, I do my fair share of both), few bands can (or should) command more of my respect. Of all the classic \"progressive rock\" bands, King Crimson is just about the only one to have understood the term in the literal sense of the word, as opposed to a genre distinction (created by Crimson themselves, of course) whose potential was 95% used up by 1975. The result is that the band has created some of the most interesting music of the rock era, and has consistently challenged the listener to embrace new ideas and genres.\n\nThat said, appreciating King Crimson took a long time for me. The main thing is that, within the prog genre, my tastes naturally gravitate more towards Yes, Genesis or even ELP than KC. The conception my brain has of prog is the kind of bombastic, \"symphonic\" prog that makes up stuff like Close to the Edge and the like (including KC's first two albums). Crimson's form of prog, however, tended to incorporate heavy elements of modern classical (sometimes), avantgarde jazz (sometimes), and later heavy elements of New Wave. For a \"classic\" prog lover, who wants their favorite bands to churn out endless clones of early 70's works, this can be a nightmare. For the more adventurous amongst us, though, this can lead to some incredibly interesting experiences, and it's worth it to willingly allow one's tastes to expand in order to enjoy the best stuff here.\n\nOf course, the downside with any great experimental band is that, well, experiments sometimes fail. While the band is very often able to perfectly balance accessibility and complexity to stunning effect, the band also often veers too far into the experimental end to be enjoyable or even listenable. It's not that I have anything against the band's endless pioneering (I fully understand that to get to heaven, sometimes you have to go through hell), but that doesn't mean I have to pretend to enjoy all of it. In particular, I'm referring to many of the band's live improvs, which often sparked great ideas for later tracks but that don't often have much value on their own (unless you get off on technical proficiency as an asset in and of itself).\n\nIt should also be noted that the band, in its last couple of incarnations, has seemingly regarded studio recordings as far less important than live performance. 80's (and beyond) King Crimson too often sounds like complexity and studio trickery for its own sake, a very artificial cut-and-paste process of taking the least accessible chord sequences imaginable and jamming over them. Sometimes this can be really enjoyable, sometimes not, but maximum enjoyment of modern KC can only take place in a live format. Of course, I make that statement with the caveat that I'm referring to the band's performances of proper studio work, not purposefully unlistenable stuff a la THRaKaTTaK...\n\nAs far as the lineup goes, that's very \"era-specific,\" and it would be useless to name every lineup here. I should, however, say a few words about Robert Fripp, the only constant. Fripp is an easy target for mockery, and I know that I once let myself majorly despise him. Frankly though, I'm not sure it's worth it. Yes, from many perspectives, he is a HUGE abberation of rock culture - he sits while playing his instrument, he wears a sportscoat, he gets furious at his fans when they bootleg or take pictures, he speaks like a super stuffy academic, he's arrogant as hell (well, that's not much of an aberration), he's reluctant to delve into back catalogue, etc etc. As my brother would say, though, he's nothing more than the latest in a long, long line of British eccentrics - he may be unusual for rock music, but he's far less uncommon as a whole than you'd imagine. And besides, I get the feeling more and more that he just wants to push the buttons of the people he knows will get upset with him for what he does, and that he has his detractors right under his thumb, where he wants them.\n\nBesides, let's not dwell on the negatives with Fripp. Whatever you may think of the man, no reasonable person can deny his complete mastery of all things related to the guitar. Robert Fripp, for me, is the heir to Jimi Hendrix's title of \"best complete guitarist on earth.\" Fripp has amply demonstrated that as far as the combination of soloing, riffing and feedback creation goes, few if any people can beat him in terms of the \"total package.\" The last is particularly noteworthy with Fripp - he is a MAJOR pioneer in making the guitar take on sounds that are completely non-standard for the instrument, particularly with his soundscapes that are kind of like synthesizers but not. Add this to his favored brand of atonal feedback, and you have a sound that, at the very least, is usually able to perk up my ears.\n\nOverall, then, I'm able to give the band a rating of 4 out of 5, which isn't bad considering I once feared the band like mad. I should note, though, that the decision is only made into a slam dunk because of the brilliance of Absent Lovers; it took a long time for me to regard of any its studio albums at the E level (though I eventually came around on Red). Regardless, when all is said and done, I do put the band on the same level as Yes and Genesis, just in a different way. They bore me more frequently than do those bands, but I can't ignore that the band has way way way too many classics in its wake. I can't and I won't. Onto yonder reviews.\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (10/23/02)\n\nGlad to see you start on the Herculean task that is summarising the career of the mighty Crim. I LOVE this band, they are different from any other \"prog\" band for oh so many reasons. For one, they rock harder than any prog band you'd care to name, especially during the Cross/Fripp/Wetton/Bruford period. Secondly, as you mention, they are a band that don't look backwards at their own history, but progress, even if that means a radically different path (with the exception of The ConstruKction Of Light, which was often strangely derivative). Thirdly, they have had a strong emphasis on improvisation, whereas most prog bands prefer pieces that, though improvisation may sometimes play a part in the initial writing, are usually very strictly structured. Improv is critical to the best, and indeed the worst, monents in the Crim catalogue. Their edginess, their unpredictability is what makes them frightening to some but it is also what makes their best moments so good and their catalogue so rewarding to those who dare to delve.\n\nI would like to offer my opinion on THE most common belief about KC - that Crimson = Fripp. Yes Robert is the only constant in the various lineups. However, except for a brief period, say 1970-early 1972, Crimson has ALWAYS been a collaborative thing. That is not to say that Robert Fripp isn't important, indeed he is pivotal to the group(s). But he works best in collaboration with other musicians, and that is, for the most part, what he does in KC. He (usually) chooses his musical company well, too. John, you alluded to what I have mentioned i this paragraph at the top of your page (kudos to you for doing so too!) but I felt this was a vital point worth mentioning in detail. I thank you for your indulgence and look forward to the individual reviews.\n\nChristine Rhodes-Fiocchi (rhodesfiocchi.earthlink.net) (11/13/02)\n\nI first heard King Crimson at the age of fifteen.I fell in love with their music immediately.The very first record that I heard was IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON.Then ISLANDS,COURT,and LIZARD-in that order.The early period was very magical for me.I remember standing in my neighbor's cornfield and hearing their music in my head.At night I would listen to all four records while a cool breeze blew through my window.Another fun thing to do was putting the speakers in the window and while their music played I would glance at the stars.This was great to do either on the front steps of the house or on the roof.Their music was my high and I needed no drugs.However I was being criticized left and right by fans of southern rock. In south jersey there is no culture.The ART POLICE keep an eye out for people who listen to underground music.But,enough of that.The next record that I bought was McDONALD AND GILES.I now own the jap import on disc.I loved it! There are parts of that record that remind me of the middle sections of SCHIZOID MAN and PICTURES OF A CITY.Unfortunately, there are other parts of the record that sound like corny english pop rock.The year was 1973 I believe and Crimson reformed.Larks Tongues in Aspic was a really bizzare sounding record for a kid to hear.I was under the impression at the time that the band may have been associated with witchcraft.Then I heard STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK and was convinced that there had to be a connection.KING CRIMSON are my favorite gothic band.I have heard their music most of my lifetime but,they are timeless and because of that I can still get into the right mood to enjoy a few hours of their fascinating compositions.They were an obsession of mine.I bought offshoot projects all the time. Such as:GORDON HASKELL'S IT IS AND IT ISN'T.Some of the folk songs on this record are reminiscent of early Crimson ballads .There is frequent use of the mellotron and his voice is a little like Nick Drake.I also had a record titled SEPTOBER ENERGY BY CENTIPEDE.As you probably know this was a project KEITH TIPPET put together.It included the horn players that appeared on LIZARD and ISLANDS and of course much later -RED.Fripp was involved with the production I believe.It was the kind of avant garde style that could raise the dead.A real rigor mortis kinda music.Especially the piece where every one with vocal capability proceeds in making hellish sounds as if they are being thrown into a hot bubbling cauldron. Very undead.When Mel Collins,Boz Burrell,and Ian Wallce left Crimson to join up with Alexis Corner I ran out and bought the record. It's not a bad record if you like blues. Pete Sinfield's Still I was dissapointed in but the title track is very good. Greg Lake sings on this one! Very beautiful. There was a really nice record by a band called FIELDS. A self titled album with melodic arrangements and wonderful keyboard playing from GRAHAM FIELDS.ANDREW MCULLOCH one of the great drummers with King Crimson plays so beautiful on this record.I love this record! Do you know where I can obtain a copy on disc?GRAHAM FIELDS of course worked with RARE BIRD.ANDREW MCULLOCH went on to GREENSLADE. JACKSON HEIGHTS was a band that MICHAEL GILES recorded with and I really don't remember their sound.They might have sounded like BARCLEY JAMES HARVEST I don't know.MICHAEL GILES is really great on an ANTHONY PHILLIPS piece titled NIGHMARE.It is from an album titled SIDES.Also,don't forget WISE AFTER THE EVENT,MICHAEL GILES does a great job on that one.He also worked with PENQUIN CAFE ORCHESTRA,maybe a couple of tracks.GILES,GILES,AND FRIPP is sort of poppy but,some of the instrumentals are unbelievable.I am still looking for the cd:THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO KING CRIMSON the compilation of Crimson music circa:1969-1974.I passed it up twice and I can't stand myself for that.I remember seeing it in 1987.I believe it is a Japanese import. Do you know where I can find it? I beleive there was an album that ROBERT FRIPP recorded with a witch in England back in 1971 during a KING CRIMSON personal transition.I read about this in the booklet that came with the Young Person's Guide To KING CRIMSON album.I would like to find this record.I never liked the later KING CRIMSON. The discipline line up. I purchased new releases of early concerts and was very pleased with the following\" THE GREAT DECEIVER box set is really worth the price! EPITAPH was okay.I'm impressed how they cleaned it up.I have to say that the best thing about this record is the Fillmore West show.It's very strange thinking about King Crimson performing in front of hippes in 1969.KING CRIMSON U.S.A. is nothing to kill for believe me. I give it a b- minus. As for EARTHBOUND, someone must really be hard up for money to release this horrible recording.I think it sounds like a toliet flushing over and over again and that's it!BOZ always had a great voice for singing soft stuff. I can't believe how good his voice sounds on ISLANDS .It had a similar sound to the vocalist in GENTLE GIANT. The kind of vocal atmosphere that they created in ballads. On EARTHBOUND he sounds like he is throwing up.I like being honest about my favorite band. They were innovators in a style of music that almost seems forgotten today. more at 11:00, Johnny\n\nreflections.ixpres.com (1/17/05)\n\nThe best.\n\nAs a total package, no equals...even today, athough I think Fripp may be getting old.\n\nI have found that the direction of his work is not working for me, with the exception of soundscapes, which, If I lived long enough to see it, might evolve its own 'order from it's chaos'.\n\nRijk Zandstra (rzandstr.gmail.com) (08/13/14)\n\nKing Crimson has always been my favourite progband, right from when I heard the title track of the Itcock album. It blew my mind as a teenager. It's the only \"band\" that never ever succumbed to cheap commercial success. They have always stayed true to their prog roots.\n\nThe Cheerful Insanity Of Giles, Giles And Fripp (Giles, Giles and Fripp) - 1968 Deram\n\nA\n\n(Very Good / Good)\n\nBest song: One In A Million, but that's only because I can't really count the various Saga Of Rodney Toady bits as \"songs\"\n\nOnce upon a time, before the days of King Crimson, Robert Fripp and original KC drummer Michael Giles were part of a trio (with Giles' brother, Peter) called, appropriately, Giles, Giles and Fripp. Their one and only album, reviewed here, sold a very very small number of copies, and it is definitely quite true that the only reason I should know of its existence is that all of its members would eventually play for the mighty Crim. Despite that, though, it's amazingly enjoyable, and definitely not a chore to sit through or to review.\n\nThe greatest thing about this album is that, whereas Crimson albums wouldn't have anything resembling a \"national identity,\" this album is so thoroughly British in so many places that I can't help but grin. First, I must point out that, thanks to this album, I can never ever hold any malice towards Robert Fripp again, if only because nobody who can deliver such a hilarious spoken piece as The Saga of \"Rodney Toady\" deserves anybody's hatred. This is BRILLIANT straight-faced British humor, and Fripp's delivery is simply perfect as perfect can be - I can't imagine anybody else saying \"Rodney's mother was fat and ugly, and Rodney's father was even .... fat-and-uglier\" or anything along those lines and doing it better than good ole Robert does here. God Bless Robert Fripp.\n\nThe rest of the album, with the exception of a LAME repeated spoken partner to \"Rodney Toady,\" entitled \"Just George,\" is basically a ton of Kinks-style Brit Pop crossed with some jazz ideas and the occasional bit of Moody-Bluesian balladry. Some bits of Crimsonian elements creep in here and there (some of the vocal harmonies in \"North Meadow,\" the brass riff in \"Elephant Song,\" the dissonant guitar lines of \"The Crukster,\" the bits of classical influence in \"Suite No. 1\"), but for the most part this is just really solid, slightly tweaked pop with elements of music hall. For a Crimson fan, I guess that wouldn't necessarily be the best news, but for somebody like me, who likes the concurrent Kinks albums (not to mention that I consider Between the Buttons one of the best pop albums ever), it's cause to pump my arms up a couple of inches and utter a quiet \"woo hoo.\" Some songs are better than others, to be sure, but I'm quite sure that I won't be able to get the melodies to \"One in a Million,\" \"How Do They Know?,\" \"North Meadow\" and \"Thursday Morning\" out of my head for quite a while.\n\nSo yeah, even though it's kinda hard to give this an extensive review (not necessarily because of the album itself - I'm in kind of a daze as I write this, you see), this is one of the most worthwhile historical curiousities I've come across in a long time. There's tons of interesting, tweaked and hilarious bits to dig out while listening throughout, and if it weren't for all these ridiculous \"Just George\" bits, this would have a chance to take quite a significant place in my collection. As is, it's still freakin' amusing.\n\nAnton Jägare (antonjagare.hotmail.com) (11/13/09)\n\nDelightful. Cheerful insanity indeed. This is what, British art-pop with serious jazz influences? And the Saga of Rodney Toad of course.\n\nAll the first three songs not only have amazing hooks, North Meadows has a brilliant jazzy guitar solo, Newly-Weds is one of the cutest pop tunes I've ever heard and One In A Million is just delightful beyond all words. Oh that silly little bass line, oh those flute flourish (or whatever they are). And it hardly gets worse from there. Nearly every sone offers something interesting, my favourites (beyond the first three) would have to be Elephant Song, with that ultra-cool jazzy brass riff (cool in a way only jazzy brass riffs can be) and hilarious lyrics (what do these guys have against fat people by the way?) and Suite No. 1 where young Fripp just really shines. And the moody mid-section is no slouch either.\n\nOverall, a definite 12 from me, and not a weak one either. I can only recommend you (and anyone who likes this) to try and find The Brondesbury Tapes from the same fellas, which is just as good if not even better (you havn't lived until you've heard Fripp's Why Don't You Just Drop In, an anti-hippie song which is as biting and catchy as anything Zappa penned at the time).\n\nIn The Court Of The Crimson King - 1969 EG\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: 21st Century Schizoid Man or Epitaph\n\nIt would be difficult to fathom a genre that owes more to a single album than does prog rock towards In the Court of the Crimson King. It's not as if it's the best prog album ever or anything like that - honestly, it would be hardpressed to crack my top ten. It's not even really the first prog album - even if you distinguish between \"art rock\" and \"prog rock\" (and you SHOULD), that honor arguably falls to The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack by The Nice. There can be little question, however, that it is the most important prog rock album ever released. It's been occasionally referred to as the Sgt. Pepper's of prog, and that analogy is apt in more than a few ways. Not only did this album firmly establish the rules and potential of the genre, it also managed to popularize the genre all by its lonesome to a greater degree than could ever have been expected.\n\nOf course, one should note that its impact and importance wasn't completely for the better. On the one hand, its overnight success inspired many bands that might not have otherwise done so to take up the prog genre, and that wasn't (at least in the short term) necessarily a good thing. It's no concidence for me that the outpouring of terrific prog albums began not one year later, but two years later - 1970 is filled to the brim with clumsy transitional albums by talented bands that wanted to be prog but hadn't quite figured out the genre's finer points. There were some exceptions (Gentle Giant, though it's VERY much like this album, or H to He by Van Der Graaf Generator, though even they put out their own mediocre prog album that year in The Least We Can Do is Wave to Each Other, or ELP), but they were just that, exceptions.\n\nThere's also the fact that, ultimately, this album, in my humble opinion, helped shorten the shelf-life of \"quality\" prog. Most genres have a lengthy \"embryonic\" stage, where the rules and boundaries and positive qualities of the genre are established. Then there's a \"peak\" period, where a slew of solid albums are released within the genre, and afterwards there's a decline, where high quality output gets harder and harder to find. In the Court of the Crimson King had the interesting effect of completely eliminating the \"embryonic\" stage in one fell swoop. Ultimately, 95% of all the further developments of the genre were embellishments of the ideas presented here, and while that allowed for greatness for a good while, the possibilities were capped simply by this fact.\n\nAlright, enough of the peripheral impact of this album, let's talk about the music. The most important member of the band at this point, despite what \"Fripp runs everything\" proponents might believe, was mellotronist/saxophonist/flautist Ian McDonald, who also played the biggest role in the songwriting. The melodies are heavily based in a classical, operatic tradition (except for the opener, of course), with some connections to regular pop but much more bombastic. Still, the melodies are GOOD, so even somebody who might hate the idea of pretense in music might still get a kick out of the quality tunes found here. The arrangements tend to follow suit - the mellotrons create an overwhelming symphonic effect at times, while the drumming (courtesy of Michael Giles) is deep, echoey and, yup, bombastic. Fripp is mostly downplayed (except, again, on the first track), yet makes his presence felt with some brilliantly beautiful electric and acoustic lines.\n\nThe vocals and lyrics also fit firmly into the bombast motif. Pete Sinfield contributes the lyrics (though nothing else), and while they're as pretentious as all get-out, they're not imageless by any means. It actually helps to listen to the lyrics the way you'd listen to the lyrics of an opera - listen to the sounds of the words, occasionally pick up on a moving or repeated line here and there, and just let them blend into the instrumentation. Granted, Sinfield turned out to be a HORRID influence, provoking whomever to jot down the most pretentious yet meaningless stuff imaginable (\"All we are is dust in the wind!\"), and even he himself wasn't so great all the time, but on this album, he's more or less ok. And besides, it helps that he has Greg Lake to sing his lines - of all the voices in rock, I can't think of anybody more suited to bombastic, near operatic-singing, and he allows all the lines, good and bad, to come alive.\n\nNow, at this point, I should start talking about the actual songs. Problem is, this album has been reviewed a 100 zillion times by sites like mine, and I'm not sure there's ANYTHING left to say about them that hasn't been said. So here's the general breakdown - if you want more details, just piece them together from the other review sites on the net.\n\n\"21st Century Schizoid Man:\" Booming guitar-based rhythm track, distorted screaming vocals, beautifully apocalyptic lyrics, incredible mid-song sax-guitar jam, WILD Hendrix-style guitar soloing.\n\n\"I Talk to the Wind:\" Lovely melody, lots of flutes, ultra-pretentious lyrics, nice breather between epics.\n\n\"Epitaph:\" Brilliant melody, layers of well-constructed bombast, lots of mellotron and woodwinds, terrific lyrics, AWESOME vocals, beautiful guitar solo, lengthy but not overlong fadeout.\n\n\"Moonchild:\" The mis-hit of the album, first two minutes are an interesting ballad (with a fascinating atmosphere), next ten are quiet and incoherent rambling jamming on vibes and bits of percussion. Blargh.\n\n\"In the Court of the Crimson King:\" Ultra-bombastic, brilliant melody, TERRIFIC harmonies following the chorus, lots of mellotron, lots of variation on the main theme.\n\nThere you have it. Again, if you go to this album looking for the pinnacle of prog, you'll be disappointed, but if you come here looking for where it all began AND why anybody cared in the first place, you won't be let down.\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (10/29/02)\n\nWow! What a start. As you alluded in your review, unlike bands like Yes, Genesis and the like, the first King Crimson album was fully prog, and surprisingly cohesive, mature (the band had not even been together a year when they recorded this, more like about 7 months), fully realised.\n\nAs for the songs, \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" is a mind-blowing opening, showing everything the band had - brilliant musicianship, great singing, interesting lyrics - what more could you want? \"I Talk To The Wind\" is a great ballad, showing the quiet side of KC. The gentle flutes starting this song so soon after the cacophonous ending to \"Schizoid Man\" just melted my brain the first time I heard it. \"Epitaph is a powerful song with another great lyric, and possibly the best vocal Greg Lake ever recorded. \"Moonchild\" demonstrated one of Crim's great passions - improvisation. the extended improv after the short \"song\" section is love it or loathe it stuff. When in the right frame of mind, I do enjoy the piece. Finally the title track, and it's another tour de force, though, for mine, not quite as fine as \"Epitaph\" I'd have to give it 9.5 out of 10.\n\nOn a side note, I'm not sure one could call The Nice's The Thoughts Of Emerlist Davjack the first prog album. For me, there is only one really prog track - \"Rondo\". The rest of the album is more geared toward psychedelic pop with the occasional spurt of bombast from Keith Emerson. If I were going to award this one, I'd say right band, wrong album and give the award for first prog album to their second album, Ars Longa Vita Brevis which featured both a classical piece reinterpreted (\"Karalia Suite\") and a side-long epic (the title track, complete with \"movements\", and another classical quote to boot with the \"Brandenburger\" section). Just my two cents worth!\n\nbsitting.mail.math.ucsb.edu (11/13/02)\n\nYou pretty much hit this album right on the nail (including 'summaries' of each of the songs, instead of reviewing the songs as usual...)! Personally, either \"Epitaph\" or \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" is my favorite song from this album. As it's mentioned, this album is surprisingly well-conceived for a debut album (minus half of \"Moonchild\" of course).\n\nIt is quite astute of you to bring up the influences this album had on prog, especially the \"shorter shelf life\" comment. I didn't quite think of it quite that way, yet there seems to be so much truth to that. Even mid-70's Crimson owes to this record! (The 80's is another beast all together...) I must say that the nonsensical lyrics seem to have gained notoriety in the Psychedelic era (from which it seems the experimental aspects of this era led to prog rock) at least. A prime suspect of this comes from Cream (\"Those Were the Days\", \"Swlbar\" (sic)). But, admittedly, Sinfeld wrote some really BAD lyrics on the next album.\n\nOh, and I agree with the 9(13).\n\nRaghavan RANGANATHAN (S3046624.student.rmit.edu.au) (8/10/03)\n\nThis is a good album but I am not sure if I would place it on such a high level as you do. The songwriting seems to be a bit underdeveloped. The title track and Schizoid man each feature just a single verse sung 4 times over (albeit with different lyrics). No chorus, no middle eights, nothing and it frankly gets boring when the same melody is repeated over and over again without any variations. Oh well, I still like the album anyway.\n\nAkis Katsman (watta502.yahoo.gr) (9/30/03)\n\nI think it's a brilliant album, especially in its time, except the clinky-tinky part on 'Moonchild' which has no reason to exist. The other tracks rule though. '21st Century Schizoid Man' is, without a doubt, the best song of 1969, hands down. It was like nothing else at that time. Brilliant. Lake does his best on 'Epitaph' and the title track, two great epics. 'I Talk To The Wind' is a little less interesting, but pretty as a teddy bear. I dig the flute too. Get this album, regardless of how much money you have. An absolute classic. 9.5/10 (half a point off due to the pointless 'Moonchild').\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (10/27/06)\n\nI bought this after I got into ELP. And the reaction was \"Wow!\". Of course, Lake's voice is really the only link. The power of the album is undeniable. I remember once Justin Hayward taking a dig at Crimson for copping their sound. While this is true to a certain extent, Crim took the sound into a far darker direction. (Only the Moodies track \"What Am I Doing Here?\" approaches the bleakness of \"Epitaph\" or the nightmare of the title track.) Of course, \"..Schizoid Man..\" sounds nothing like the Moodies, and the group's technical proficiency was far superior. Another thing that made them stand out was that they were really the first art rock band to truly incorporate jazz into their music. (The Nice tried, with covering Dave Brubeck's \"Blue Rondo a la Turk\", but all they did was rearrange it into a rock mode). This, of course turned out both great (the \"Mirrors\" freak out middle section of \"..Schizoid Man..\") and really bad (the endless coda to \"Moonchild\". They called this section \"The Dream\" and \"The Illusion\", but it should been called \"The Nap\" and \"The Snooze\"). With \"Moonchild\", they did bite off more than they could chew so that they could fill up space on the album, but becuase they tackle jazz as well as folk and classical influences, I also agree that this is the first truly prog album. A classic.\n\nSergei (swamprock.mail.ru) (03/17/07)\n\nArgh...! Similar, you as well as majority critics who describe this album suppose the main mistake. Under the review it is visible that you too abuse with words like \"bombastic\", instead of main - recognition of the valid greatness of songs and album as a whole. So, we have the really great rock-album which has rendered ENORMOUS influence on development progressive-rock (would be very strange if you did not recognize it!). I advise you to look on \" In The Court \" from other, less prejudiced point of view. Really you can not forgive to group avantgardish improvisation in Moonchild? It not seems that other tracks (like 21st Schizoid, Epitaph, In The Court) are so majestic what is possible to not accept to heart even long 10-minute \"caprice\" Moonchild? Eventually, silly to put \" In The Court Of The Crimson King \" lower than fucking Close To The Edge (which two third - ABSOLUTE bullshit) by Yes. Believe, it is ridiculous!\n\nI not die-hard fan of Crimson and I heard of enough various music to speak about \" In The Court... \" as about one of greatest products of rock. Ok, it deserves (at least!) 10 (14), but I would put 10 (15).\n\nPS: Please, pay attention to other album KC - Lizard. Your estimation and in this case is too prejudiced, I am sure that you in earnest did not want to understand Lizard. It is a remarkable album. Too.\n\n\"matt faris\" (7headedchicken.gmail.com) (01/13/11)\n\nI can imagine what it was like to invent progressive rock. In the midst of a big trend, you want to play something that is only somewhat in line with what is going on with the scene, or maybe not at all in line with it, and that also happens to draw influence from music that many people who are part of that scene probably have either not listened to since joining the scene or even never listened to. You show your new ideas to people who are supposedly in the know, and their reaction is less than accepting. Nevertheless, something inside you propells you forward, encouraging you to follow your heart, until suddenly a whole new genre of music is being made and appreciated. Of course, both the people and even the trends themselves then were fathoms more open-minded than they are today, so the chance at something this influential happening again is very slim. Well, even if this album didn't technically start prog-rock, it's still great enough to be as credited for it as it is - and, I, personally think it did, if not for the structure of the album alone, full albums themselves being a key asset to the nature of prog. It's so different sounding from other 60's music - truly from another world; I was blown away the first time I heard it... to Daniel and Corine Bosch: I had that same experience with \"I Talk To the Wind.\" In fact, I'd probably say that's my favorite track on the album, although \"The Court of the Crimson King\" and \"Epitaph\" come close, and I happen to love the jam at the end of \"Moonchild\", especially the slowly strummed upper-register guitar chords. Some call this pointless noodling, but I love stuff like this, like a lot of what is on *Islands* and the quiet parts of Genesis' *The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway*. If I had any complaints, it would be that I always thought the verses to \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" were a little ridiculous, but you can't beat that lightening fast unison riff in the middle. I'm not sure I fully understand how your scale works, but if I were to use it, and give this album a 9(14), then I can only pray that a 50 lb. sack of creamed corn doesn't fall on my head.\n\nEpitaph - 1997 DGM\n\nA\n\n(Very Good / Good)\n\nBest song: Mars (both of them)\n\nIf you're one of those people that thinks the only true King Crimson was the very first incarnation (hang your head in shame if that's true), then this 2-CD archive release is a necessity (there's actually a 4-CD version directly available from DGM, but it appears to be just more of the same). Featuring a complete show on the second disc (the last this incarnation ever did) and recordings from a few places on disc one, this may not have the best audio in the world, but it's a good overview of the power the band was able to produce on stage. Plus, it has three versions of \"Schizoid Man,\" all with Fripp attacking the solo with much more reckless abandon than in the studio (it's funny to read the liner notes and see Robert ripping on his own guitar playing in the studio version), and more \"Schizoid Man\" is almost always better \"Schizoid Man.\"\n\nOne thing that keeps getting stressed in the liner notes is that, as good as it might have been, Court didn't totally capture the intensity of the band's stage performances, and these performances definitely show a lot of sonic and rhythmic power (the tradeoff, though, is that the stage didn't have as much precision from the mellotron). Aside from multiple renditions of the big three epics of Court (no \"Talk to the Wind\" or \"Moonchild\" here), there are two renditions each of \"A Man, A City\" (later \"Pictures of a City\") and \"Mars\" (later \"The Devil's Triangle\"), and they're a freaking blast. \"A Man, A City\" might go slightly overboard with the jazzy mid-section, but I enjoy it just fine nonetheless, and the 'main' sections of the song rule as much as they would in the studio version. My definite favorites of this set, though, are the two renditions of \"Mars,\" which do an incredible job of pounding that steady menacing rhythm into my head while the mellotron does its atmospheric thing. So help me, I'm a sucker for a good crescendo, and while the band would have great success in later years with \"Talking Drum\" and \"Dangerous Curves,\" I'm not totally sure it ever surpassed the sheer grandeur of its live Mars performances for head-pounding build-up.\n\nThere are also a number of tracks that didn't make it to any studio album, and they're of, um, mixed quality. \"Drop In\" would later have some of its music reworked into \"The Letters,\" and it's okayish, though it's easy to see why it was relegated to rarity status. \"Get Thy Bearings\" (which I first heard on Ladies of the Road) isn't very impressive, Mantra has completely passed me by every time, \"Travel Weary Capricorn\" sounds like a bad outtake from In Search of the Lost Chord (not in lyrics, but definitely in music), and \"Travel Bleary Capricorn\" shows that King Crimson had a long ways to go before it could produce effective improvised jazz rock (I'm not a huge fan of the improvs from the '73-'74 incarnation, but on the whole they're way above what's here).\n\nOverall, then, this isn't a must-have for any King Crimson fan, but as I said, a big fan of the first era would do well to hear this album at some point. Giles is a little less precise than in the studio, as is McDonald, but Lake is mostly spectacular on vocals, Fripp sounds fine, and overall the band gels into something incredibly special. Hearing this album, if nothing else, makes it even more clear why King Crimson became such a huge sensation in such a brief period, and from the historical document angle, that makes this worth seeking out. Don't get it before Court or Poseidon, though.\n\nDaniel Bosch (bicycle_legs.optusnet.com.au) (09/29/07)\n\nI love this release. I am definitely NOT one of those who think this is the only KC (I think every incarnation has produced some special music, except maybe for the rotating door 1970-72 period). However, This release does make me wish that this incarnation had done one or two more albums. BTW, if you don't have it, I thoroughly recommend getting the McDonald & Giles album, it's great, IMHO essential for anyone interested in this period of Crim.\n\nIn The Wake Of Poseidon - 1970 EG\n\nC\n\n(Very Good / Great)\n\nBest song: Pictures Of A City\n\nPoor Robert Fripp. Frankly, I wouldn't wish the circumstances surrounding this album upon my worst enemy. When a band has a debut that's such a critical and commercial smash as was Court, it's only natural that expectations be sky high for the sequel. Unfortunately, the band hit a little snag along the way to this album - Ian McDonald, the man who was THE creative force of the debut, left. Fripp took over the mellotron duties, and he brought in one Mel Collins to contribute woodwind parts, but that couldn't cover up the loss of the man who both guided the direction and penned most of the melodies. To make matters worse, Greg Lake then announced that HE was leaving the band to join ELP, and while he agreed to contribute vocals (the bass parts were done by Peter Giles), he also made no contribution to the songwriting (a pity, since he soon showed in ELP that he had a strong talent for creating interesting chord sequences).\n\nSo Fripp took over the songwriting duties, almost by default. Unfortunately, he had another major problem to face - I get the strong feeling that Fripp feared that, along with the loss of the main songwriter, a change in direction could prove fatal for both the band's ability to keep fans and to maintain critical respect. As a result, he panicked more than a bit - the first side of this album, by and large, is a direct remake of the first side of Court, and that fact alone seemingly drives some fans away to this day. As an aside, I also get the feeling that Fripp's near maniacal refusal to live in the past that has characterized most King Crimson through the 70's, 80's and 90's is a direct factor of adamently refusing to make a \"copying mistake\" that even remotely resembles what happened between this and Court. But I digress.\n\nYou see, remake or no, this is still a high quality effort. Comparisons with the debut are only natural, and in the end this album is worse in some ways than Court, but better in others. The drawbacks, other than the remake factor, are basically the following: first, strewn throughout the album are three \"Peace\" songs, with mostly a capella Lake vocals singing some really stupid and really pretentious lyrics. Second, Sinfield's lyrics have taken a major dip in quality from Court (with the exception of one track) - they're as bombastic as ever, but now there are no cleverly ear-catching lines that make them stand out in any good way. Lake does his best to make them work, and he sometimes succeeds, but overall it's hard not to fidget at times.\n\nOn the good side: No \"Moonchild!\" The album also boasts better production than its predecessor - the mellotrons are grander and more awe-inspiring than ever, and everything else just seems to have more punch and vigor. The second side also has a couple of great tracks the likes of which were DEFINITELY not found on Court. First, there's \"Cat Food\" (which I guess is a leftover from the first album sessions - McDonald has a writing credit), a dissonant-piano-driven proto-New-Wave piece that was picked as the advance single for some reason or another. The lyrics are actually funny for once, the melody is catchy in its own way, and Lake's screams do a great job of making it work. Following that is something completely different - the three-part \"The Devil's Triangle,\" an adapation of Gustav Holst's \"Mars The Bringer of War,\" which had been part of their stage set for quite some time (McDonald has a writing credit here, in the first part). True to the form of the original, the first couple of minutes are a very slow, very intense crescendo with some bits of mellotron here and there, but later it turns into a creepy noisefest with all sorts of eerie keyboard parts moving up and down and side to side, and even a brief quote from the last album's title track. It be neat, yes it be.\n\nAh, but there's still the issue of the first side, the Court-ripoff. Well, let's be frank - ripoff or no, it's GOOD. The songs may be very stylistically similar to their corresponding tracks on Court, but they're hardly direct ripoffs, and they're definitely performed well. \"Pictures of a City\" is a great, great sequel to \"Schizoid Man\" (oddly enough, though, it was performed in the same shows as \"Schizoid Man\" as early as 1969) - it features the same kind of structure as that track, but there are plenty of differences. The general feel is much jazzier, as the main riff of the track has enough to amply satisfy both rock and jazz lovers fully. It has the same \"Lake screams over a booming rhythm track\" motif in the verses, yes, but never mind that - the jam in the middle of the track is both better produced and more complex (with another bunch of great Fripp solos) than the \"Schizoid\" jam, and overall I have trouble seeing how somebody who loved \"Schizoid\" could hate this (well, except for the fact that the lyrics on this one can't hold a candle to those of \"Schizoid\").\n\nNext up is the \"I Talk to the Wind\" match, the lovely poppy \"Cadence and Cascade.\" For this one, the band actually brought in one Gordon Haskell to sing the vocals, and first time I heard it, I didn't even know it wasn't necessarily Lake himself. I'd say the melody is even prettier than the one to \"Wind,\" and the piano/acoustic arrangement could easily be appreciated by somebody who hated \"Wind\" on general principle (why somebody would hate it I'm not sure). Of course, once again, the lyrics blow chunks, but that's been covered.\n\nThen there's the title track, the \"Epitaph\" clone. The lyrics are a good deal worse, yet Lake delivers another amazing vocal performance, one that allows me to focus on the sound of his voice and ignore the lyrics. As for the melody, it's much the same as before, but there are a couple of moments of catharsis in the chord sequences that even \"Epitaph\" struggled to match. Add in that the mellotrons are (as mentioned earlier) much louder, and that the lengthy fadeout gives a genuine epic symphonic feel not really found elsewhere in the world of rock music, and you have a track that, while not exceeding \"Epitaph,\" at least makes a good run at matching it.\n\nAnd that's your followup. It has its problems, but it's definitely not a huge stepdown from Court (it's pretty close to a D, if you ask me), and Fripp should be given plenty of credit for that. And if you have more doubts about the quality of the album, know this - my brother, whose favorite band is KC, now feels that Court is the worst Crimson album barring Lizard, yet he digs this album. Go figure.\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (10/29/02)\n\nYes, OK, this album has similarities to the first one. There are good reasons for this. Firstly, as you point out, Robert Fripp didn't want to stray too far due to the personnel changes. Secondly, however, despite the writing credits alot of this album was devised by the original lineup. If you don't already have it, I strongly recommend the two CD box Epitaph which documents the original lineup live. \"Pictures Of A City\", for example, was in the original lineup's repetoire, known as \"A Man, A City\". Similarly \"The Devil's Triangle\", as you pointed out, is an adaptation of \"Mars\" by Holst, also an early live staple. The \"Peace\" tracks are silly (although the instrumental version Fripp plays on acoustic is gorgeous) but too short to upset me. On side one the only failure for me is the title track, a flat rewrite of \"Epitaph\" with much weaker lyrics, a much less impressive vocal from Greg and a tune that is just too similar for its own good. The rest is great though and side two is also impressive. \"Cat Food\" is my personal favourite, a witty lyric sung with relish and some nutty piano from Keith Tippett. After the debut - wich was a truly collaborative effort, this album was, I think, Robert Fripp trying to find his feet as \"bandleader\" or whatever. I give it 8.5 out of 10.\n\nbsitting.mail.math.ucsb.edu (11/13/02)\n\nSuch pretentious album titles! Personally, the rip-offs do annoy me a little bit (especially on the title song). But, it's hard to deny they are still worthy rip-offs, as Fripp put enough twists to still make it sound fresh. Still, I prefer the originals (though there's more guitar and jazz, making things interesting). Also, Gentle Giant's \"Alucard\" improves on \"Pictures of a City\".\n\nBack to the album itself. In all truth, except for the two acapella \"Peace\" snippets, the songs are really good. And things get even better (and weirder) as we pass to the \"original\" songs. \"The Devil's Triangle\" could have made a good soundtrack to a march (what a great build-up). Of course, you noted the reference to the last album (so much for an original comment!). In short, this gets an 8(12) from me (considering I thought it way more pale until recently).\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (05/03/07)\n\nI like it a lot, too, even if half of it's a retread. It does sound a lot clearer than the first album. Sinfield's lyrics had really degenerated into blather, especially on the title track, where he seemingly threw together disconnected phrases for the heck of it. But it sounds cool, anyway. I do think, on the other hand, that the lyrics to \"Cadence and Cascade\" (a couple of groupies who evidently become disappointed when they meet their hero in the flesh) are quite touching and delivered nicely by Haskell. I really like Giles' work here, as well as on \"Pictures..\" and \"The Devil's Triangle.\" Unlike you, I do think that he gave Bruford a run for the money, at least at this point. The album may not break enough new ground for hardcore Crim-heads, but I wouldn't have minded if the continues along these lines, based on the quality of this one.\n\n\"matt faris\" (7headedchicken.gmail.com) (01/13/11)\n\nThis is the first Crimson album I bought, so I didn't have the dissapointment of the first side being similar to the debut that is common, but it may not have been too much of a dissapointment anyway: maybe the 2nd and 3rd tracks aren't necessarily improvements, but \"Pictures of a City\" is an improvement to me. The vocals sound better, the whole thing is groovier, and that guitar tone! When that first distorted chord smashes down in the verse, I think - \"no way....no way this could have been recorded in 1970.\" One thing that I think really pulls the album together and uniquifies it in structure is the 3 \"Peace\" tracks. So people are saying that Robert Fripp doesn't like having his picture taken, and I think we all know what that means: he doesn't want people to know that he's not the singer....... no, seriously, there could be many reasons for that. He might prefer to be asked first, or maybe he had a bad childhood experience. Maybe he's humble, or maybe he worries that someone will photoshop in a guitar that he would never play - (probably not that, since they didn't have photoshop in the 70's) - or maybe he has a completely different reason that only he could tell you. Who cares. He's a great guitarist.\n\nLizard - 1970 EG\n\n4\n\n(Bad / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Prince Rupert Awakes\n\nWhile it's good that Robert Fripp was so intent on avoiding a second 'clone' of Court, this is a clear example of my belief that change is only for the better if, well, it's for the better. Except for Fripp and Sinfield, all remnants of the Court lineup have been swept away by this time, and it's obvious that Robert wanted to make a clean break from the stylistics of the first two albums and establish his own identity. There are some people who played on Wake - Gordon Haskell is now the bassist and lead vocalist, Mel Collins is the fulltime woodwinds player, as well as a couple of others - but the sound couldn't possibly be more different from that on those albums.\n\nThe problem, though, isn't that the album is different. The problem is that the album sucks. Fripp may have had to assume the songwriting duties on Wake, but much of that merely constituted of slight tinkering with ideas from the first album (with a bit of structured avantgarde here and there). On Lizard, however, Fripp had to assume control of both the songwriting and the artistic direction, and it seems to me that shouldering both proved too much for him. With only a very small number of exceptions, Fripp's goal seemed not to lean towards any kind of memorability or even sense, but rather trying to be as complex and grandiose and epic and avantgarde as he could without considering whether or not these qualities served any purpose. For a hardcore prog fan, Lizard might seem fine for just those reasons; however, as much as I love my Close to the Edge and Foxtrot and Octopus, I require that complexity and its cousins in some way entertain me. Simply put, Lizard doesn't.\n\nFripp's songwriting, however, does not get full blame for how much I dislike this album. Gordon Haskell was an alright vocalist on \"Cadence and Cascade,\" but this album is a whole other story. Basically, he's an incredibly mediocre tenor that sounds like he has a frog in his throat at all times. It's not just that he's worse than Lake - it's that he's worse than almost EVERY SINGLE VOCALIST I'VE EVER HEARD. However, in the area of the vocals, Haskell isn't even the biggest problem - rather, that honor goes to what he's singing. On this album, Sinfield simply went berzerk with his lyrics, penning such brilliancies as \"Stake a lizard by the throat\" (and that's a lyric from the best part of the album!). In short, awful vocals + awful lyrics + incredibly mediocre vocal melodies = bad music made worse.\n\nSo what about the songs? I can find some good things here and there, but wow I have to reach. The opening \"Cirkus\" is more or less tolerable - everything associated with the vocals is dumb (including the instrumentation under the vocal parts), but the mellotron-guitar breaks between verses are rather interesting, and some of the \"soaring\" mellotron parts provide a slight return to the well-done epic vibe of the first two albums. I also more or less enjoy the first section of side-two's sidelong title track, as it's basically just a nice pop song with guest vocals from Yes' Jon Anderson (hey, did you know there was a rumor of Robert Fripp joining Yes as Peter Banks' replacement? Imagine how THAT would have turned out...). The lyrics are of course utterly abominable, but I'm able to lose myself in the neat pop chorus and even in the more atmospheric parts of the verse melody. So yeah, there's some good stuff on the album after all.\n\nHowever, that's more or less it as far as really good music goes. The rest of the first side is practically worthless - \"Lady of the Dancing Water\" is the best of these, and that's only because it does nothing instead of actively offend. And offend the others do. \"Indoor Games\" is a 4th-rate \"Pictures of a City,\" with a laaaaazy saxophone riff that hasn't 1/100 of the intensity of that near masterpiece, nor a single decent hook throughout. Bear in mind, that's before the last chunk of the song, when we're greeted with the DUMBEST SOUNDING SYNTH EVER, and a fadeout with Gordon laughing \"menacingly\" for no apparent reason. This in turn leads to \"Happy Family,\" one of the most abominable songs I've heard in some time. The instrumental parts are just about the very definition of mindless, directionless jamming, with seemingly random piano and synth and guitar noise and whatever for some of the worst four minutes of my life. This is compounded by the fact that Fripp found the one way to make Haskell's voice more unbearable - he encoded it in distortion, and suddenly Haskell's obnoxious human voice became an obnoxious android voice.\n\nNow the second side (after \"Prince Rupert Awakes\") is a bit strange for me. I like PARTS of it (at least, after many many listens), but as a whole, I consider the track a failure. \"Bolero - The Peacock's Tale\" is an attempt to fuse jazz ideas with modern classical ripoffs, and while it mostly bores me, it does have a reeeeally pretty mellotron line that pops up a couple of times. During the next part, the ten-minute \"The Battle of Glass Tears\" (with three parts of its own), the music just kinda goes and goes, though there is a reasonably interesting theme that parts of it seem to be based on. I also kinda like \"Prince Rupert's Lament,\" the only time of the album where Fripp's guitar is prominent (not in shred mode at all, but the tone and note choices are quintessential Fripp), and the ending \"Big Top\" is amusing in a kitcsh sort of way. Again, though, a couple of decent moments in a track this long just doesn't cut it for me.\n\nIn short, this album is one of the great failures of progressive rock (I know there are plenty of people who strongly disagree with this, but I just can't work my way around thinking this). This is the sort of album that gives a bad name to prog rock, one filled with pretense and poorly executed ambition, hoping to get by on bombast with no substance. I originally wanted to give it a lower grade, but even after finding a little more good material within, I cannot in good conscience increase it by much.\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (11/06/02)\n\nDefinitely a step down from the first two albums, but I do still like this on, if in the right mood. \"Cirkus\" is probably my favourite song, I love the menacing mellotron/guitar riff after each verse. Haskell is definitely the worst vocalist they ever had, no doubt. Apparently he is also the only ex-Crimsonite with whom Fripp still does not get on with, to the point that on the box set Frame By Frame he gets Adrian Belew to re-record the vocal on \"Cadence and Cascade\" and Tony Levin to redo the bass on \"Bolero\". But I digress. \"Indoor Games\" is OK but slight, \"Happy Family\" is an interesting idea wrecked by the vocal effects and the directionlessness (is that a word?) of the jam. \"Lady Of The Dancing Water\" is pretty, with lovely flute by Mel Collins. As for the \"Lizard\" suite, it's quite good, for mine. Big surprise you chose \"Prince Rupert Awakes\" as your favourite, you big Yes fan you!!! (so am I anyway). About the only time KC did a pop song, in the 70s anyway. The various instrumental passages are nice, no better but no worse than \"The Devil's Triangle\". Robert Fripp's guitar in \"Prince Ruper's Lament\" is awesome, so mounful. The best bit about the suite - virtually no vocals from Haskell!! I'm gonna give this a solid 7 out of 10.\n\nBTW, it is true that Yes offered Robert Fripp the guitarist's job before getting Steve Howe, but Fripp turned it down. I have also heard say that Fripp turned around and offered Jon Anderson the permanent vocal spot with KC after Haskell split (Haskell left 2 days after finishing the album BTW), but Anderson was too committed to Yes. So there you go.\n\nAkis Katsman (watta502.yahoo.gr) (9/30/03)\n\nThe worst Crimson album I have listened by far, but not a bad one. The main problems are 1) Haskell's horrible voice, and 2) A lot of dull moments. Both 'Indoor Games' and 'Happy Family' would have been better if there was a better singer. I like 'Circus' and 'Lady Of The Dancing Water' much, especially the former, but the title track, while not bad, compared to other 20+ min. prog songs (i.e. 'Karn Evil 9' and 'Supper's Ready') seems very dull and completely emotionless. I like 'Prince Ruppert Awakes' (that with Jon Anderson) and the jazzy feel of 'Bolero: The Peacock's Tale' but then I get tired, although the rest of side 2 isn't that horrible. The end with the tape effect is cool, though. I warn you: Don't start your Crimson collection with this one, get the debut instead. The lyrics are iffy, too. I recommend this album only to hardcore jazz-rock weirdos. 6/10 on a good day, no more.\n\nMike (thedukeofprunes.webtv.net) (12/23/03)\n\nA very strange album indeed. Not for the average King Crimson fan but for serious die-hard fans only. The best and strongest track I feel is 'Cirkus'. I love the melody in the middle with Fripp's mellotron and Mel Collin's sax solo. Gordon Haskell was not a very strong vocalist and I'm not sure he was even right for the band. This guy actually made a handfull of solo albums that aren't that bad. Why is he laughing for no reason at the end of 'Indoor Games\"? I have no idea and it's maybe best no one ever finds out. The beginning melody of 'Bolero' I feel is beautiful and does send chills up my spine (what can I say...I'm a sucker for a good melody) but soon bores me with clumsy jazz noodling and endless jamming. Basically for me 'Lizard' and their next album 'Islands' are somewhat boring but aren't that bad. Not bad albums but not any of my favorite Crimson albums. They sound horribly outdated and have not stood the test of time, they got better though, way better. But you have to hand it to Robert Fripp, he was trying to do something new and creative. Did he succeed? Yes and no.\n\nAfter listening to 'Lizard' and 'Islands' back to back (if anyone can), you get the feeling of a somewhat Beatles influence kind of gone wrong. But both albums are very creative because I have never really heard anything like these albums ever again and that might be a good thing who knows. Still, not bad albums but I wouldn't recommend them.\n\n\"Eden, Scott C Mr (Contractor) MONROE\" (scott.eden1.us.army.mil) (4/21/04)\n\nYet again, my musical tastes differ from the majority of other listeners. Lizard is my favorite Crimson LP, with Red being a close second. On the other hand, I think Poseidon and Islands are the weakest albums, though neither is bad and both have some killer tracks on them. I'm also not a big fan of \"In The Court\". For the life of me, I cannot understand why sooooooo many people dislike Lizard, even hard core Crimson fans. For me, everything works on this album and there is not a weak song on it, with Lizard and Cirkus being my favorites. I pretty much never listen to \"Lady Of The Dancing Water\". This is definitely Crimson at their most avant-garde, with a heavy dose of jazz elements thrown in, making it hard to put a label on it. It is certainly unique among the Crimson catalog, though Islands would probably be the closest relative to it. I think the lyrics are Sinfield's best. They are typical Sinfield, maybe even more so, which is probably not to everyone's tastes. Gordon Haskell's vocals are great and I think Sinfield's treatments of them work well. I have to admit, though, that after reading the great \"In The Court Of King Crimson\" by Steve Smith, I find Gordon to be a nonstop whiner and complainer and whose opinions on the album are off mark. I think Andy McCulloch's drumming on this album is superb and one of the best on a Crimson album. He is certainly the forgotten Crimson drummer, which is a shame. He uses the most odd signature drumming style I've heard on a Crimson album and is playing all over the place. Admittedly, he is more of a top end drummer here, with little of the power that Bruford (and other drummers) brought. Maybe that is why is does not get the credit he deserves. If you've never focused on his playing here, give it a listen and you may agree with me.\n\nI can understand why this is not everyone's favorite Crimson album. It is their \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\", which also happens to be my favorite Yes album. Both albums generate more controversy than any other in each band's catalog. I don't think I've even read a single positive review from any of the band members about this album. This does not bother me, as musicians are usually the worst judges of their own music. For the record, I think Lizard is a great album. As is typical for my musical luck, this was the only Crimson lineup that never toured (in terms of core members), thanks to Gordon for acting immature and stomping out the door like a child as tour preparations were being made. Too bad, as this would have been a most interesting tour. The Island tour did feature some Lizard material, but Boz did not have the chops to pull them off. Similarly, Ian Wallace's drumming never impressed me and I do not think he was capable of replicating Andy McCulloch's style.\n\n[ BTW, my interest in Crimson is limited to the 1969-1984 period ]\n\nSteve Rogers (beeflin.mac.com) (7/25/04)\n\nAbsolutely agree. Such good musicians could have made a great album if it wasn't for the abysmal vocals and abysmal lyrics. Very frustrating. Wouldn't it be great to hear it without the vocals...?\n\nMATTHEW CONSTANTINE (11/22/08)\n\nI love this album.\n\nCirkus, what about Fripp's acoustic guitar fills in the sung-verses? And Mel Collins's solo breaks sounding so chilled out he must be in a different room to the rest of the band?\n\nIndoor Games, is this synth really any dumber than the \"musical fart\" synths that crop up all over Selling England By The Pound? FACT: Haskell's (VCS3-treated) laughter at the end seems to be edited together from two incidents: Sinfield mooning at the band through a window, and Haskell becoming disgusted with the closing lyrics.\n\nHappy Family, you guessed it: I love this! Including the VCS£'d vocals. The mid-song jam bursting with detail: the truly evil-sounding trombone and flute are first things you notice, but what about the drumming, Tippett's electric piano or Fripp's all-over-the-place guitar chording? FACT: the lyrics are about the Beatles' breakup (in case you didn't know).\n\nThe Lizard Suite, even if you don't like it you ought to at least note the admirable contributions from Robin Miller with his double-reeds, Tippett with his acoustic and electric pianos and not forgetting the Evans/Collins/Fripp exchanges in the battle scene which are even sicker than those in Happy Family.\n\n\"matt faris\" (7headedchicken.gmail.com) (01/13/11)\n\nA 10(15) from me. Just one of those instances where you love a work of art that not many other people do, and can even explain why, but not in a way that would likely be understood by others. Oh well, I still love *Lizard*. Kinda starts off like a regular King Crimson album with \"Cirkus\", but then goes way off the deep end with \"Indoor Games\" - again, I don't know how to explain why I like the sound of this one so much, but it's odd combination of elements makes me laugh with refreshed delight every time. And I didn't know that \"Happy Family\" was about the breakup of The Beatles... I will have to give it another listen now. I think \"Lady of the Dancing Water\" is much prettier than \"Cadence and Cascade.\" The \"Lizard\" suite really gets my attention, though. I like the emotional catharsis in the \"Prince Rupert's Lament\" part a lot, and the dynamics of the whole suite seem to have taught me about certain aspects of life that can't be explained with words, but my absolute favorite part of the whole album is the oboe melody on \"Bolero - The Peacock's Tale.\" That melody is so beautiful, and played so emotionally, I can't remember for sure, but I think it may have acutally made me cry before. I know you don't like them, and I may be a little off about this, but this is my take on the lyrics to the chorus of \"Prince Rupert Awakes\":\n\nEven though your opinion doesn't count, say it anyway\n\nIt's a tough world out there - be prepared\n\nDon't get caught up in the past, but don't worry too much about the future\n\nIt's okay not to be a vegetarian\n\nSo this is my favorite King Crimson album. If I were in a room filled with stereos playing all the albums in the world simultaneously, would I be able to pick out the one that was playing *Lizard*? Well, that's a good question, but that's not the point. That sounds like a hellish experiment that I would never dream of doing to myself. I just want to listen to * Lizard* the way I always used to. On vinyl!\n\nEric Benac (sonicdeath10.hotmail.com) (10/13/15)\n\nRead through your King Crimson reviews again: pretty much agree with everything you have to say, though I am more partial to improvisation. As for \"Lizard,\" I can say that my appreciation of it has increased slightly over the years, but only to the point where I'd give it a \"5\" on your scale instead of a \"3.\" What Fripp was trying to do is theoretically interesting (a nearly free jazz approach in a prog rock context) but a practical failure.\n\nHowever, that wasn't exactly why I e-mailed: I was actually wondering if you'd ever read any of Fripp's diary at DGM Live. I have puttered around on there here and there, but I ran into this particular entry that I thought you would like: Fripp basically agreeing with your assessment of the album. Click this link to read it.\n\n\"Unlistenable.\"\n\nHonestly, the more I read of Fripp and the more I read about him, the more I like him. He has the natural tendency of people from the UK (Wales, in his case) to self deprecate or to at least be brutally honest. Clearly, he knew the album had problems and was not one of the finest things he's ever done. I consider it the band's only failed studio album and, what's more, probably the only failed studio album Fripp has worked on. His second collaboration with Andy Summers (Bewitched) is also a bit slight, but by no means terrible.\n\nThat album and \"I Advance Masked\" are pretty enjoyable, but I had to stop collecting all those slight Fripperies and collaborations because it was driving me into the poor house. And I know other readers have suggested it, but \"The Brodensbury Tapes\" isessential for any fan of Giles, Giles and Fripp and Crimson. The songs are great and watching the band rework them and subtly change is astonishing.\n\nIn fact, Starostin went so far as to say that had the band taken the best songs there, reworked them a little, dropped \"Moonchild,\" and created a double album out of \"Court,\" that it would have been something like the prog album to end all prog albums.\n\nmarc white (marcwhite29.icloud.com) (12/13/15)\n\nI actually like this record quite a bit. Yes, Haskills annoys me. That said, there is a unique quality in this record not heard in the rest of Crimson's catalog. Not my favorite Crimson album, but I like it more than Islands, which actually bores me.\n\nIslands - 1971 EG\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Islands\n\nKing Crimson's slide towards irrelevancy continues with this album, but strangely this a good deal better than Lizard. The lineup changed once more, as future Bad Company bassist Boz Burrell took over Haskell's bass and vocal duties (and believe me, he may not be any sort of brilliant singer, but he's miles above Haskell), and one Ian Wallace (who also later played on live tours with Bob Dylan - is there any band more useful for six degrees of separation games?) took over the drum duties. Fripp remained the primary songwriter, and while some of the material on here is worse than anything on Lizard, a good deal of it also shows that Robert was really getting the hang of this whole songwriting thing.\n\nThe bad news of the album comes in the form of the first seventeen minutes, a combination of two tracks, \"Formentera Lady\" and \"Sailor's Tale.\" The actual song isn't that bad - after pointless instrumental wanking for about two minutes, we're greeted with a pleasant late-60's-style easterny psychedelic ballad (with prog lyrics, of course), and while it's nothing genial, it's still a nice escape from stuff like \"Happy Family\" off the last album. Unfortunately, Fripp just couldn't let a good thing go undisturbed - over the next seven minutes or so, he goes for dissonance overload, throwing in choirs purposefully singing off key and various instruments just playing whatever. Then the band breaks into \"The Sailor's Tale,\" and while Fripp gets a lengthy guitar solo that might seem alright in its bizarreness, it pales to any number of his efforts before and after. And the rest of the music, well, it's basically just more of the same - instrumental noise taking the place of good ideas and cohesion. I will admit that some bits and pieces of the jamming are interesting on a purely technical level, but once again, I've heard much much better in my life.\n\nAmazingly, though, the rest of the album is totally unlike that seventeen minute waste. The next two tracks are, like, actual songs! With real melodies, real dynamics, real riffs, you name it. Just as well, Sinfield all of a sudden develops a decent talent for lyric-writing - \"The Letter\" is clear, concise and non-cliched in its tale of one man and two women, \"Ladies of the Road\" is filled with puns about screwing groupies, and the closing title track provides nice imagery of floating on your own private island. Nothing pretentious, nothing meaningless, just some nice texts allowing for actual resonance with the listener. So hats off to our favorite lyrical dork.\n\nBut back to the music. The opening melody of \"The Letter\" is quietly eerie, with Boz setting the scene of the first two verses, and then out of nowhere comes this GREAT mellotron/brass riff with Fripp doing some of his stuff over it. Then there's some slight sax noodling to build up the tension further, with Fripp adding some guitar coloring once more, and following that Boz starts screaming the \"IMPALED ON NAILS OF ICE\" part in a way that really conveys the hurt and frustration of the wife, before going back to the quiet eerie melody that goes with the wife killing herself. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest rock song of all time or anything like that, but it's just such a nice pleasant surprise to discover that Fripp could, in fact, pen a solid rock song, albeit with some necessary Crimson twisting.\n\nThen of course there's \"Ladies of the Road,\" with naughty music to go with the naughty lyrics. The verse melody drips with subtle sleaze, the instrumental breaks are bass heavy with great sleazy sax parts, there's bits and pieces of typical Fripp guitar, and there's even an ultra-charming Beatlesesque chorus to match! WHERE WERE YOU ON LIZARD??!!!\n\nNow the next two tracks are a bit more \"pretentious,\" but in a good way. \"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\" is a 100% classical composition by Fripp, who takes full advantage of the presence of all the instrumentalists available to him in the studio. It doesn't break any ground in classical music, of course, but I don't really mind that - the era of classical music Fripp is emulating with this piece was characterized by rigid rules and standards, after all, and this is just another quality composition following those rules. Besides, Fripp is one person I'd much prefer to stick to \"regular\" classical than modern classical - if ever there was a creative person who could afford some (not total, but some) \"rigidity,\" it's Fripp.\n\nThen there's the title track, a pleasant nine-minute ballad driven by keyboards and Mark Charig's (one of the album's featured players) cornet. Whatever be, the music creates a really beautiful atmosphere - I really feel like I'm on a sea floating towards an island, except that for me, the sea I'm on is in outer space, and the island is somewhere in the middle of the gorgeous album cover. Major kudos go to Fripp for the restraint shown in this composition - the Fripp of the previous year would have tried to make the last six minutes of this into \"The Battle of Glass Tears,\" after all. Here, though, Fripp managed to create one of the ideal songs for listening to just before it's time to go to bed, and that's a compliment. Of course, for whatever reason, after the track ends, there's silence, and then a tape of Fripp giving some direction in the studio, followed by strings tuning up. Fripp's voice is neat, that's all I can say about that.\n\nOverall, I can see how many KC fans could end up hating this - the second half of the album isn't really \"progressive\" at all, and the first half gives a bad name to experimentation in rock music. However, as one who judges music by its quality and not by how many points on the \"progressive checklist\" it matches, I can tell you that the second half of this album is very very enjoyable. Don't overspend on the album, but don't avoid it either.\n\nDaniel and Corine Bosch (dcbosch.optusnet.com.au) (11/06/02)\n\nAnother year, another lineup! It must have been unsettling to Fripp for this to keep happening. And with another lineup, another stylistic change, leaving the jazz influenced freakouts behind for classical (on the quieter pieces) and, on the louder pieces a sign of things to come - hard rock. I have to admit I don't like this album any more than Lizard, posibly a little less. The reason? Although this album has some killer cuts (\"The Letters\", \"Ladies Of The Road\", \"The Sailor's Tale\") Thel long, quiet pieces are a problem for me. \"Formentera Lady\" and \"Islands\" are pretty, Boz sings them pretty well and the lyrics are not as bad as the admittedly got at times on Lizard, but they don't do alot - they drag on and on, not going anywhere. And \"Prelude - Song Of The Gulls\" is pretty but hardly Crimson, if you ask me. All up, I tried to give this a 7, but could only manage a 6.5 out of 10\n\nDon't know if you noticed, but there are a couple of rehashed ideas on this album too. \"The Letters\" borrows it's melody entirely from an In The Court Of The Crimson King era song called \"Drop in\", but has an entirely different lyric and feel. Also, ever notice the similarity between \"Prelude\" and the second movement of Fripp's \"Suite No. 1\" from The Cheerful Insanity Of Giles Giles and Fripp? Something to think about.\n\nAkis Katsman (watta502.yahoo.gr) (9/30/03)\n\nOne of the weakest Crimson albums. It has the beautiful classical piece 'Prelude: Song Of The Gulls' and the amazing title track (one of my favourite Crimson songs ever), but the other songs are messy and not very exciting. 'Formentera Lady' has a nice melody but it's too long, the singer sings too quiet and the 'operatic' ending is dumb. 'The Letters' and 'Ladies On The Road' are okay jazz-rock songs, but the lyrics suck ass. I dig the saxophone part on 'Ladies' though. As for 'Sailor's Tale', I don't have any problem with it, I can say I almost enjoy it, but give me 'Fracture' or 'Larks pt.2' any day, I enjoy them much more. Not the best album for a King Crimson introduction. I give Islands a 6.5/10.\n\nLazer59882.aol.com (11/17/03)\n\nTerribly underrated by just about everyone (well not REALLY everyone). Formentera Lady is overlong and a little wanky. BUT the melody is beautiful in its simplicity, and Boz's oh-so-subtle variations on the bassline keep it from getting too boring. The horn solo sounds like it belongs on another song, as do the voices at the end because they're so offf key. When the voices begin to die down, however, the song builds to a crescendo with the strings, then finally fades into the cymbals of Sailor's Tale. It takes awhile to get going, but when the sax solokicks up its just thrilling and very jazzy. The guitar solo, dare I say, SUCKS! Even the solo on the Earthbound version is better. Here we just have noise-tuneless and cacaphonous. When the rest of the band comes back in we get some stupid noises and more cacaphony which finally dies into nothing for a few seconds. The Letters is great. The lyrics are seemingly soap opera-ish until the end. The main song part is nice and the jazzy midsection is wonderful. The way Fripp's guitar wail just slides down into the quiter section with Boz's pulsing bass building tension...masterful. Finally, for the last two verses, Boz really sings here (mind you he's no Greg Lake), the verses louder and more powerful than the former two. Next is Ladies of the Road. Great chorus and some interesting instrumental passages, but i dont see the point. Boz doesnt sing as much as he yells and it drags on too long. Also it doesnt fit with ANYTHING in the KC catalogue. Ever. It's just so non KC. It's just not my cup of tea. Prelude: Song of the Gulls is beautiful with the uncredited string section. I dont neccessarily dig this type of classical music (I prefer grand symphonies and the like) but it's great. Finally, Islands closes the album. It too is beautiful. Mark Charig's cornet solo - just behind the beat - over Fripps harmonium is a thing to behold. You're absolutely right when you say Fripp shows restraint (though i dont know the song you are referring to). No weirdness or pretentiousness, just pure unadultered beauty. Ian's percussion is great in its simplicity, just a 1-2-3-4 thing, but it helps build the tension to the climax with the grand mellotron. I've heard rumors that the end (with Fripp counting and the strings tuning up) was supposed to be the beginning to Formentera Lady, which would explain the beginning of that song's \"pointless wanking.\" Either way, I like it.\n\nOverall, I would give it a 8 (12), with the best song being Islands. BTW: I bought this at the same time as To Our Children's Children's Children and i listen to this much more. Interesting...\n\nMike (thedukeofprunes.webtv.net) (12/23/03)\n\nNot a bad album really but not one of their best nor not one of my favorite Crimson albums. I feel 'The Sailor's Tale' is the best and strongest track on the album and it brings jazz fusion up a notch. This album and their previous album (Lizard) I would recommend for serious die-hard Crimson fans only.\n\n\"Saenz, Jason\" (jsaenz.sagetelecom.net) (10/11/04)\n\nWhy does everybody bash and smash this album so bad? I just dont get it, ISLANDS is not terrible at all, in fact it's really trippy and really complex. Of course you do have to give it a couple of listens before you are able to appreciate it, but once you understand where Mr. Fripp is trying to take you it gets much better. I guess you have to really understand it a lot and let yourself get into it. If you just want to put a number on an album, then I agree with your rating, if you want to rate music, I think you need to think about that crappy rating again, why does everyone rate this so low? I know you might look for stability in a record or some good hooks, but come on man! All we are saying is give ISLANDS a chance, you might like it a lot!\n\nMatti.Alakulju.upm-kymmene.com (12/27/07)\n\nA nice little story, not directly about this album, but this line-up: As you know, Fripp has always been unwilling to play his old hits, and I admire and respect him hugely for that. Back in 1971, this band was playing in Detroit, and the loud American audience was all the time requesting In The Court or Schizoid Man or Epitaph. By the end of the gig old Bob got pissed off and decided to give them some old hits.\n\nThe band returned for an encore, they started to play a very sleazy typically American Hoochie Coochie Man- type vamp. On top of this Boz sang a couple of verses of In The Court, and after that it all veered off into a free jazz jam! This is one of the funniest musical jokes I've ever heard. This gig was released through the on-line collectors' club of King Crimson.\n\nMATTHEW CONSTANTINE (11/22/08)\n\nI love this one, too - including the opening medley. It's worth noting that (FACTS) Fripp's guitar solo on Sailor's Tale features yet another use of the VCS3. And that Prelude is an orchestration of one of the key themes from the Giles Giles & Fripp \"suite\".\n\n\"David Sheehan\" (davidasheehan.gmail.com) (01/13/10)\n\nWow, big disagreement on this one, John. I really like this album. I think most of your review kinda mirrors my feelings towards it, but I just can't seem to share your hatred of the first seventeen minutes (the \"waste\" as you put it). I have listened to it over and over, and I just don't hear a lot of pointless wanking, or hell, even that much dissonance. The female vocals towards the end of 'Formentera Lady' sound good to me. A little off, but appropriately weird. I don't hear much dissonance for dissonance's sake. Maybe my ears are wired differently than yours. I also really think that 'Sailor's Tale' is really exciting and energetic, especially Fripp's crazy solo. The rest of the album is really solid, and while 'Ladies of the Road' doesn't necessarily fit with the other songs, it's still a good track. Sounds almost like Crimson doing the Rolling Stones. I think there is a slight possibility that I'm overrating this by a smidge from hearing Lizard first. That album is rank. Also, the album cover is sooooooo pretty (I'm kinda of an astronomy enthusiast), that maybe I'm transferring those feelings to the actual music a little bit. But probably not. I do agree 100% with your feelings about the final track 'Islands.' It's a good example of atmosphere over substance really coming through in a song's favor in a big way. There's not really much to that song, but it is so nice. I wouldn't mind if it was extended another nine minutes.\n\nOh, I give the album a twelve. Really.\n\n\"matt faris\" (7headedchicken.gmail.com) (01/13/11)\n\nI have to admit I'm not as familiar with this one as some of the others. It was one of my last purchases before losing everything, but I would like to hear it again. I don't remember any of the lyrics, but I remember the first song being very interesting, reminding me of a lot of 20th Century classical. And \"A Sailor's Tale\" seemed to be very intense, and the title track very beautiful and majestic, reminding me of some of Mark Isham's work. I do, however, very vividly remember your pick for best song, \"Song of the Gulls.\" If Robert Fripp conducted those strings, then he really knew what he was doing. The precise timing of those \"lifts\" very acurately depicts the motion of seagulls while flying.\n\nLadies Of The Road - 2002 DGM\n\nA\n\n(Very Good / Good)\n\nBest song: Schizoid Men\n\nBetween Islands and the next album, Crimson originally released a live album entitled Earthbound. Supposedly, the sound quality is awful beyond all possible comprehension, and the performances are subpar, and as such I haven't sought out a copy (even though in 2002 it was, in fact, remastered and reissued). In any case, this archive release, a collection of live recordings from the Islands tour, makes that album irrelevant, so here we are.\n\nThe first disc is what you'd expect out of a standard live album - a bunch of performances taken from the tour and strung together to seem like a full (or at least a good chunk) concert. Frankly, the first disc isn't much to get excited about - some performances are great, some are just good, and some are quite ehn. The opening \"Pictures of a City\" loses the hard edge it once had, with the main riff becoming more lounge-jazzy to less-than-great effect. \"The Letters\" is done mostly pro forma, with one unfortunate exception - rather than belting out the \"impaled on nails of ice\" lines, he just sings them quietly, and while I guess that works in its own way, I'd much rather have some screaming there. And \"Formentera Lady\" is, well, \"Formentera Lady\" - starts out ok, then just becomes pointlessly wanky. There's also a pair of jazz improv thingamajigs that pop up on here - \"Groon\" (which kinda sucks, has no vocals, and takes up a whole seven minutes) and \"Get Thy Bearings\" (a Donovan cover with some needless vocals, that's at least better than \"Groon\"). If you can come up with better descriptions, I'd like to see you try.\n\nOn the other hand, \"The Sailor's Tale\" turns out to translate VERY well into a live environment - for whatever reason, my brain is more willing to accept a jam of that nature outside the studio than within. \"Cirkus\" also improves from before, primarily because Burrell's vocals are ten times what Haskell's were in the song - I almost find myself getting swayed by the meaningless imagery here, and that's something I wouldn't have said before. It's also taken at a slower tempo than on Lizard, and for whatever reason this seems to up the intensity of the piece enough to make it quite tolerable. There's also a terrific version of \"Schizoid Man\" on this disc, with the band booming and jamming in a way they don't even approach elsewhere on the album - Burrell does a GREAT job of singing the verses, even without distortion, and the mid-song jam is just what you'd expect from a high quality \"Schizoid Man.\" And finally, the disc closes out with one of the biggest surprises imaginable - a forty five second snippet of \"In the Court of the Crimson King\" ... done as a BLUES number. Yup, you read that right - I wish they'd included the whole track, but what's here is definitely nice for some giggles.\n\nAs you might guess, while the first disc is ok, it is definitely NOT the justification for giving this compilation an A. Disc 2 is one of the best ideas Fripp has ever had in compiling an archive release - after the first track, which is the first verse of a live Schizoid Man, the next 50-odd minutes are various Schizoid jams (from this same tour) strung together without break (well, sort of - for whatever reason, there's about a minute of silence in the middle of track 11, before we get yet another jam). Let me tell you something - if this disc is any indication, this was a GREAT era for \"21st Century Schizoid Man.\" One incredible blast jam comes after another, waves of WILD saxophone and guitar solos keep pouring out, and it never EVER gets boring. Some solos are jazzier, some more psychedelic, and every last one of them is improvised jamming BLISS.\n\nIn short, NO fan of the band can possibly be without the second disc. The first disc could be done without quite easily, but it's still ok, so if you see this for a reasonable price, make sure to swipe it up.\n\nEric Benac (sonicdeath10.hotmail.com) (04/29/08)\n\nI quite like this live album, and didn't even know it existed until reading your review! This particular group did have some playing talent, and some good songs, but I'm glad they broke up because...well, uh, the Larks group is a tad bit better, I think. Still, good stuff on here, with most of the downfalls of this particular version of the group handily avoided.\n\nBy the way, you do well to avoid Earthbound except for one thing: the rendition of 21st Century Schizoid Man is the best I've ever heard. I know that sounds weird, but Boz's screaming on the track, while rough, fits it, even with the weird synthesizer effect they throw on it for no reason. The weird, thick sound of the rest of the album actually fits really well onto this song. Robert has never sounded so dirty in his guitar playing, and the rest of the band thump and blow on the song in ways like...well, like the Schizoid tracks on Ladies of The Road...still, it's really the best I've heard, so the album is, unfortunately, not something you can avoid...I'm just trying to get you to pay 8 bucks on a shitty album, see? It's fun. The rest of it is funk blues improv scat nonsense that does NOT serve the King Crimson name well. Fripp seems pissed off and illustrates it with his solos and that's kind of fun.\n\nChris Ray (chris.ray.hunterlink.net.au) (10/05/08)\n\nOne of my favourite King Crimson albums, well disc 2 of it is, I don't listen to disc 1 much, but disc 2 is awesome. As you say a brilliant idea from Fripp to string a whole series of Schizoid solos together, and they really do never get boring. There's not many guitarists you could say that an hour of their solos (and some Collins sax solos, but it's mainly guitar solos) wouldn't get boring but Fripp is one of the few (along with Hendrix and maybe Omar Rodriguez from The Mars Volta, though I'm not sure how many people would agree with me on that one). Hopefully one day he'll do another volume with the Schizoid solos from the 73-74 band, as all the versions I've heard from that era are equally as good, though with perhaps more of a metal edge, which isn't a bad thing. And to the comment from Eric above saying that you need to get Earthbound just for the version of Schizoid Man, well you don't because it's on this album (well the jam is at least); track 5 on the Schizoid Man disc is the Earthbound version.\n\nLarks' Tongues In Aspic - 1973 EG\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Larks' Tongues In Aspic Parts 1 and 2\n\nThe last couple of Crimson albums might have more-or-less stunk, but let's be fair to Fripp - he wasn't exactly surrounded with the mightiest of talent. Compounded with the fact that Fripp's bandmates weren't really on the same conceptual page as him - he wanted weird, they wanted more conventional jazz and blues modes - and it's no wonder those albums weren't quite up to par. So Robert fixed these problems - he surrounded himself with people with more playing talent than the band had yet fathomed, and (more importantly) who were able to share a common goal with Fripp. The result was the band's best album yet, and an album that (in many ways) has served as the foundation for all King Crimson to the present day.\n\nThe new direction for the band, as defined on this album, can best be described (in my opinion) as \"Heavy Avant-Prog.\" If we accept Robert's description of the initial King Crimson as \"Hendrix plays Bartok,\" this new version can be described as \"Hendrix plays Eric Dolphy plays Bartok.\" This album is prog rock, but rather than pushing the stylistic boundaries of the Court formula, like most bands in the genre were doing at the time (not that I'm putting those bands and albums down, you see), it instead seeks to totally break down and rebuild the genre from its very foundation. Combining the already established manner of \"Schizoid\" jamming with elements of avantgarde jazz, and framing these jams within a tight mathematical setup of climaxes, rises and falls, it's little wonder that some critics of the day referred to this as \"outer limits\" music. NOBODY was making music quite like this, and no wonder; nobody else had a combination of people conducive to making this sort of art, and it's doubtful that many others would have even if they could.\n\nThe new KC lineup included six people, counting a replacement lyricist for Peter Sinfield (who went off to join ELP), one Robert Palmer-James. Palmer-James, for better or worse, doesn't really have any impact on the album whatsoever - three of the six tracks contain lyrics, and while they're not blatantly icky, there's not much in the way of consistent imagery contained within. \"Easy Money\" does have some amusing anti-capitalist rantings, but I've heard better. Still, there's something to be said for the fact that there's no \"Stake a lizard by the throat\" to be found here.\n\nNow, the lyrics may be irrelevant, but that obviously can't be extended to the rest of the players. The bass and vocals void is filled by one John Wetton, previously a member of Family and later of Asia fame. He's not a great vocalist, but he's unquestionably the best the band has had since losing Lake, and his bass-playing skills are simply superb. He's not afraid to play at a higher volume than normal, or to put different effects on his bass, and he's able to both create a solid foundation and to augment the general sound well.\n\nThe most novel part of the sound of this lineup comes courtesy of David Cross, master of violin and viola (and mellotron, as needed). The modern cynic might feel a bit uncomfy at the idea of a fulltime violin player in a rock (ha) band, given that history hasn't shown this can produce consistently tasteful results, but such fears should most definitely be laid to rest. Cross shows an amazing ability to accentuate the dark mood that permeates so much of the album, yet is also able to create occasional stretches of surprising loveliness. There are also a number of passages that show him playing his instrument in such a way that definitely doesn't match anything I've heard anywhere else - it's hard to be innovative in playing a violin, but he definitely pulls it off.\n\nThe biggest coup for the band, however, came in the percussion section. First, Robert managed to snatch up a maniacal eccentric by the name of Jamie Muir. His percussion style was WILD, a kind suited to total avantgarde improvisation, and very different from anything previously found in prog rock. He's responsible for many of the most exciting and unexpected moments on the album, throwing in a useful enough dose of instability to really give the album an edge. Yet as interesting as this is, his brand of insanity is the kind that is much more effective in either a distilled fashion, or even better, a kind useful in a mentor-student relationship. In other words, Muir needed a student...\n\n...and who should need a teacher but Bill Bruford. Bruford, by his own admission, had peaked with Yes' Close to the Edge - he believed that any followup by Yes could only be \"Son Of Close to the Edge,\" and he did not see what else he could do within a Yes context. So he tendered his resignation from the band before that album's tour; Fripp was all too happy to snatch him up, and Bruford was all too happy to have a new start. In my opinion, Bill had proven within Yes that he was one of the top three or so drummers in the world of major rock bands, but he did have one slight weakness; his style tended to be a bit too anal at times with his precise, jazzy rhythms. Under Muir's tutelage, Bruford took his previous style and crossed it with healthy doses of spontaneous, instinctual power, and in the process made himself (in my mind) the king of all drummers. His drumming on this album is nothing short of spectacular, combining the best aspects of his Yes work with stretches that defy all possible expectations of quality.\n\nThis bizarre mix of players and ideology introduces itself to the world in a big way with the opening 13-minute title track (part one - part two closes out the album). The first 2:50 or so is devoted to a relatively quiet marimba improvisation, with bits of chimes here and there, and also with occasional bits of violin (I guess... it's hard to tell what exactly is what on this album) chiming in to increase the ominous effect. About halfway through, Bruford begins slowly riding his cymbals, gradually increasing their volume as the marimbas fade into the background, raising the apprehension and feeling of expectation of the listener to very high degree. Then the main piece begins - Cross begins playing an INCREDIBLY spooky violin line while Fripp plays some distorted notes here and there, then disappears for a couple of seconds, then builds it back up again, and then there's a MONSTROUS distorted heavy riff played a few times (with some soloing overdubbed). Then it's violin again, the distorted guitar notes come back with heavy bass in tow, the tension builds again, and then there's that riff again! Fripp throws in a very brief typical guitar line for him, and the band breaks into a weirdass jam, featuring Muir creating rhythmic woodblock noise in the midst of it all. This goes on for about a minute, the groove slows down, and then they break into another even wilder jam (app. 6:15-7:35). Fripp's guitar and Wetton's bass are most prominent here, but take special care to notice the absolutely INCREDIBLE drumming from Bruford here. The combination of power and speed here, oh man, this has few, if any, analogies in the rock world, I can tell you that.\n\nEventually, around 7:40, the jam ends, and the piece returns to Cross' hands. His playing over the next three or so minutes can't really be explained in terms of rock music, but ... have you ever heard the Camille Saint-Saens piece \"Dance Macabre?\" It has this whole creepy \"dead people at dawn\" atmosphere to it, and for whatever reason, I'm always reminded of it by Cross' playing here. But I digress. Eventually, this playing fades out, the initial violin lines pop back in (the ones before the \"main theme\" pop up), and we hear a bunch of really quiet voices mumbling things over the lines, before the violin and bass help fade things out. And that is how you build a brilliant introduction to an album.\n\nThe next three tracks aren't as brilliant, but part of the reason for that is that they have lyrics, and as such are closer to being \"normal\" songs than the exploratory opening track. Not that normalcy is inherently inferior to experimentation, of course - I usually consider prog tamed with \"convention\" to be superior, but let's face it, this incarnation (at this point) was better at experimentation than songwriting. Still, that hardly means these tracks are anywhere near bad. \"Book of Saturday\" is the weakest of the lot, but it's still a pretty decent ballad with bits of weird guitar and violin sound to accompany an ok melody. \"Exiles,\" on the other hand, is a major winner - the lyrics don't add much to the effort, but the vocal melody (and delivery) is terrific, and Cross' violin theme ads more than enough resonance to make up for the lyrical deficiencies. The song does have the drawback of a little too much meandering in the instrumental breaks, with Fripp messing with spacey feedback and ideas that have nothing to do with the rest of the song, but hey, at least he makes the song totally unique by doing so.\n\nFlipping over to side two, we're greeted with a bizarre percussive rhythm, overlaid with all sorts of gritty guitar feedback and wordless syllabic vocals, serving as an introduction to \"Easy Money.\" The song itself has a really cool vocal melody, with all sorts of neat percussion underneath that, and then it breaks into a really eerie, pretty quiet (yet suprisingly intense in its quietness, and I'd guess because of the quietness) jam, with Fripp leading the way with some absolutely terrific soloing. There's bits of mellotron here and there to augment it, but the emphasis is clearly on Fripp, until about halfway in, where Wetton becomes the highest instrument in the jam, not letting it down in the slightest. Not surprisingly, the song then closes out with another iteration of the verse melody, louder and more intense this time around, fading out with some VERY disturbing laughing sounds. It's hardly the best track on the album, but it's definitely a worthy inclusion.\n\nSo thus ends the sung portion of the album. But not the album itself! In fitting fashion, the band decided to close out the album with 14-and-a-half minutes of instrumentals, split over two tracks. The first, \"The Talking Drum,\" is just about the textbook definition of how to properly work a lengthy crescendo. It starts off very, VERY quiet (with a buzzing fly sound, for some reason), with Muir randomly banging on bongos (I guess), until Wetton starts playing a simple bassline again and again about 1:40 in, with Bruford riding his snare in lockstep fashion. And then Cross pops up, working off a brilliant up-tempo (yet somber) theme and playing it every which way. Eventually Fripp joins the party, throwing in his own theme that he plays every which way. Slowly but surely, the intensity reaches an utterly feverish pitch, with all these seemingly disparate ideas working as one to drive the listener into a total frenzy. My brother and I once decided that, essentially, this is the music you'd hear on the elevator down to hell, and I still stand by that assessment.\n\nThen out of nowhere, the piece grinds to a halt, there's a screech of guitar feedback, and we launch into \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic 2,\" the best riff-rocker prog has ever seen. In some ways, I prefer later live versions to this studio original, but make no mistake, this original has an atmosphere and aspects untou"
