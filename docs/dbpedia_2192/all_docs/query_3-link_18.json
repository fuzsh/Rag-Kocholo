        "text": "Upper: Two \"timtom\" inscriptions found in U.K. 7\"\n\ncopies for Hungry Heart (paper label) and Cadillac\n\nRanch. The inscription of the former is difficult to\n\nread with an extra hand-etching (probably \"cbs\").\n\nLower : \"Ty\" inscribed on Side B of Hungry Heart. This is probably the sole example of a NEBRASKA track\n\nthat is clearly indicated as \"MONO\" among all the vinyl\n\npressings of the album and singles released therefrom. Whoever credited (see the inset taken from the lyric sheet), the\n\nmaster lacquer of this vinyl pressing is cut by someone else.\n\nShown is a U.S. repressed copy of THE RIVER Disc 1, where the\n\nmatrix inscription \"chet\" means that the master-cutting engineer\n\nis Chet Bennett who worked for CBS Records in the 1980s. A Grammy-winning engineer cut several of Springsteen's U.K. releases in\n\nthe early 1980's. This U.K.-only 12\" EP has two typical his signatures,\n\ntimtom on Side A (lower right) and Ty on Side B (upper right). Left Two: \"BS - 1\" stamp found on the Side One deadwax of the original (left) and 1987 reissue (right). Right Two: \"SG 1\" (or \"SG I\") hand-etching on the original press (left) that is scratched out on the repressing (right: Note that \"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN\" is not printed on the label). The artist's name is removed from all six side labels on the three discs of the 1987\n\nre-release (right). There is, I guess, the possibility that bootleggers might have\n\nmodified the labels intentionally to differentiate the two editions, because except\n\nfor the labels, the reissue faithfully reproduces the original artwork and design. Examples of various non-original vinyl copies of FOLLOW THAT DREAM that typically came with plain colored labels and featured the \"Bruce alone\" photo inside the gate-fold sleeve. The single-pocket sleeve version is also known to exist. Note that these are not from my collection.\n\nThis DARKNESS outtake album shows similarities to the U.S.\n\nversion of FOLLOW THAT DREAM with respect to the inside\n\ndesign of the gate-fold sleeve and the use of plain colored\n\nlabels on the waxes. The front sleeve is shown on the lower\n\nright corner. The second pressing came in a black & white\n\nslick cover as shown on the upper left. I remember back\n\nthen, most of the takes that are included in this studio\n\nbootleg were new listens to me. Which one is the earlier release? Shown above are two different issues both of which carry black labels on\n\nthe waxes and feature an on-stage band shot on the inside of the full-color gate-fold sleeve (the two apparent\n\nprerequisites for the original). The original edition of this classic bootleg title from the early 1980s was and\n\nstill is highly sought after by Bruceleg collectors. The original has the Ludam Records label on the waxes and comes in a\n\nhinged box. Despite being one of the worst underground releases, this\n\nbootleg had repeatedly appeared on the market with different labels in\n\nan unhinged box and even in the form of picture disc (as a single disc\n\nrelease). One of the earliest known THE RIVER tour boots to circulate. The Stockholm concert was also released on another 3-LP bootleg that\n\nused the same recordings as those of FOLLOW THAT DREAM. However, it\n\ndoes not feature the entire performance, missing several songs, and the\n\npackage pales so much in comparison. The illustration on the upper right\n\nis taken from the rear side of the unspectacular single-pocket sleeve.\n\nFrom a bootleg catalog issued September 1987 by a Japanese retailer.\n\nFor price comparison, back in 1987, the official Japanese edition of\n\nLIVE/1975-85 (CBS/SONY 75AP 3300-4) five-LP box was sold at the set\n\nprice of 7,500-Yen. Due to the limited supply, he urges customers\n\nnot to miss this opportunity to purchase the three Swedish triple-LP\n\nboots. Take note that the retailer believes or pretends to believe\n\nFOLLOW THAT DREAM as soundboard-sourced. Two horizontal dashed lines of green color on top of the composite label image indicate the width of dead wax space of the early U.S. pressing; a single dashed pink line denotes that of the Japanese test pressing.\n\nTwo various artist promo CD rarities from SONY Japan featuring\n\nBorn In The U.S.A. They are released in the early 1990’s with a\n\nbooklet. The deluxe packaged COMMEMORATIVE COMPACT DISCS\n\n(SONY TDCD 90042-90043) is a double CD set that includes both\n\ndomestic and overseas artists. HAKURAIKUN ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\n(SONY XDCS 93098-93101) is a 4-CD volume containing foreign\n\nartists exclusively. \"HAKURAI\" means seaborne or imported\n\narticles/goods/products while “KUN” is a honorific suffix\n\nmainly used for males. It is of note that the HAKURAIKUN set\n\nuses facial shots of a company executive and an employee\n\non the front and rear sleeves, respectively (and that’s why\n\nthe images are not shown here). Another flawed copy of the album from my\n\ncollection is the U.K. first pressing, as indicated\n\nby the matrix number CBS-86304-A1, which\n\ncomes with the blank label on Side One. Two horizontal dashed lines of green color on top of the image indicate the width of deadwax space of the early U.S. pressing. Not sure if the Italian and Mexican copies shown here correspond to a very early pressing released in each country (matrix numbers are CI 86304-1L-16-5-84 and 50-04-16122-1B-1, respectively, on Side One). Both Filipino and Dutch pressings carry a MASTERDISK stamp on each side of deadwax space, an indication of the U.S. origin of master lacquers that were utilized for vinyl pressing in these countries.\n\nUpper: The Filipino LP is known for the modified front sleeve that\n\nuses orange fonts for artist name and additionally mentions\n\nfive featured tracks beneath the album title/artist.\n\nLower: The deadwax carries the matix number information\n\njust like that of the early U.S. pressings\n\n(RL inscription is encircled)."
