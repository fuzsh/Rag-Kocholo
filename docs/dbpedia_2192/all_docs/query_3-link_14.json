So, without any further ado, I'd like to thank everybody without whom this site would not exist in the form it does. I'd also like to express my appreciation to the group of talented and dedicated professionals whose hard work helped to make this site come true.\n\nDave Lewis of Tight But Loose for his extremely kind permission of using short quotes from his book \"Evenings With Led Zeppelin: The Complete Concert Chronicle\" (Omnibus Press, 2021). Also the same to the co-author Mike Tremaglio. Without it this project could not be as comprehensive as it is. Steve Benson of Hot Wacks On-Line for support. Gerard Sparaco of Collector Music Reviews for help and support too. Sam Rapallo of Led Zeppelin Official Site for allowing me to review each show. Brannon of Bootledz for his great work and accurate updates. Phil Bushe and Paul Sheppard for their massive and unvaluable works on Tarantura and other Japanese labels. Scott Martin for fine updates from the land of rising sun.\n\nAlso thanks to all the other people who had anything to do with this project for their help, information, and/or assistance (however major or minor) over the years."
