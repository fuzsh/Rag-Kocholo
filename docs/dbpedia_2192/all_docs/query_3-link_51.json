The benefits of interfering with such trading are fairly minimal compared to the potential ill-will generated against the artist, as the illicit works are generally circulated among the artist's most loyal fans, which have the most interest. Most record companies also have not shown an interest in pursuing or prosecuting small-scale bootleggers, but this could change at any time.\n\nHowever, in 2004 U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. struck down a 1994 law banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances. [cite web\n\nurl = http://www.iprinfo.com/page.php?page_id=52&action=articleDetails&a_id=349&id=27\n\ntitle = Constitutional Impediments to Protecting the Live Musical Performance Right in the United States\n\naccessdate = 2006-09-23\n\nlast = Landau\n\nfirst = Michael\n\nyear = 2005\n\nmonth = April\n\nwork = IPRinfo Magazine\n\npublisher = IPR University Center] He dismissed a federal indictment of Jean Martignon, who was running a Manhattan mail-order and Internet business that sells bootleg recordings. The Recording Industry Association of America disagreed with the ruling, saying the decision \"stands in marked contrast to existing law and prior decisions that have determined that Congress was well within its constitutional authority to adopt legislation that prevented trafficking in copies of unauthorized recordings of live performances\", according to spokesman Jonathan Lamy. [cite web\n\nurl = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-09-24-copyright-has-limits_x.htm\n\ntitle = N.Y. judge strikes down anti-bootleg law\n\naccessdate = 2006-09-23\n\nlast = McClam\n\nfirst = Erin\n\nyear = 2004\n\nmonth = September\n\nwork = USA Today\n\npublisher = Associated Press] In 2007, Judge Baer's ruling was overruled, and the 2nd Circuit of the US Court of Appeals found that the anti-bootlegging statute was within the power of congress. 492 F. 3d 140\n\nLegal alternatives to illicit bootlegging\n\nArtists and record companies have attempted to find ways to provide authorized alternatives to satisfy consumer demand for bootleg recordings, including the marketing of their own live albums and rarities collections.\n\nAuthorized live bootlegs\n\nAn increasing number of artists have decided to allow and encourage live audience recording, although they and their fans generally consider the \"selling\" of such recordings—as opposed to keeping them for one's own personal enjoyment or trading them for other audience recordings—to be illegitimate bootlegging. Fans cite the encouragement of these recordings as a key factor in their long-term loyalty to these bands.\n\nIn addition, many performers have made joking suggestions to bootleggers presumably in the audience, especially when a new or unusual song is about to be performed. Fans often hopefully cite such comments as evidence of permission to make bootleg recordings.\n\nThe Grateful Dead is well known for explicitly allowing their shows to be taped.\n\nInstant live bootlegs\n\nIn the early 2000s, artists responded to the demand for bootleg concert recordings by experimenting with the sale of authorized bootlegs made directly from the unmixed soundboard feeds, or from on the fly multitrack mixes, and thus superior to surreptitious audience recordings which are typically marred by crowd noise. These releases were generally available a few days to a few weeks after the concert.

Notable examples include Genesis, and Peter Gabriel, who has released such copies of live recordings for most of his concerts since 2003.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, improving technology in high-speed CD reproduction made some of these \"official boots\" available to audience members immediately as they leave the concert; some companies can begin selling complete concert CDs less than ten minutes after the end of the show.

When Clear Channel divested its live entertainment business into the spin off company Live Nation in 2005, the patents were transferred as well. The patent (US patent|6917566) was revoked by the USPTO in 2007 after challenges filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

In 2002 Dave Matthews Band released \"Busted Stuff\" in response to the Internet-fueled success of \"The Lillywhite Sessions\" which they had not intended to release.\n\nee also\n\n* Magnitizdat, for live recordings of banned bards and musicians in the Soviet Union\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Heylin, Clinton. \"The Great White Wonders: The Story of Rock Bootlegs\".
