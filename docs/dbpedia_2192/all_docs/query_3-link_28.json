A relativistic outlook replaced the universal perspective of modernism (the international ambitions of the 12-note style); the grand narrative of the evolution and dissolution of tonality was challenged, and emphasis shifted to cultural context, reception and subject position. Together, these have conspired to eat away at the status of canonical composers and categories of high and low in music. A need has arisen, also, to recognize and address the emergence of crossovers, mixed and new genres, to engage in debates concerning the vexed problem of what constitutes authenticity in music, and to offer a critique of musical practice as the product of free, individual expression. Popular musicology is a vital and exciting area of scholarship, and the Ashgate Popular and Folk Music Series aims to present the best research in the field. Authors are concerned with locating musical practices, values and meanings in cultural context, and draw upon methodologies and theories developed in cultural studies, semiotics, poststructuralism, psychology and sociology. The series focuses on popular musics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is designed to embrace the world’s popular musics from Acid Jazz to Zydeco, whether high tech or low tech, commercial or non-commercial, contemporary or traditional. Derek B. Scott Professor of Critical Musicology University of Leeds, UK\n\nThis page has been left blank intentionally\n\nAcknowledgements This study has had a lengthy gestation, and I am grateful for the patience of those interested in the topic, who have supported me along the way, and who have had a long wait. I initially became interested in undertaking an academic study of record collecting after reading the novel High Fidelity (1995) by Nick Hornby, and then seeing the feature film based on it (High Fidelity, 2000). As a collector myself, and with many friends who considered themselves collectors, I felt both the novel and the film tended to caricature the ‘record collector’. Accordingly, through 2001–02, I interviewed 67 record collectors (see Appendix 1 for details). The results of this survey were incorporated into: a circulated ‘Report’ to the interviewees; some preliminary presentations at several academic conferences; a contribution to the first volume of The CONTINUUM Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World (Shepherd et al., 2003); and an article, ‘Beyond the High Fidelity Stereotype’, published in Popular Music (Shuker, 2004). The idea of a full-length book gradually emerged, and initial research on broader aspects of the topic, especially the historical development of record collecting, was undertaken during periods of research leave in 2002 and 2003. A number of developments then delayed and thwarted the project: in 2003 I took up a new and extremely demanding academic job, which also involved a family relocation and two house moves; I developed a serious health problem (now resolved!); and the collecting study was put on hold while I undertook other publishing commitments. In 2008–09 I returned to the project, ‘updating’ a number of the earlier interviews, adding others and revisiting the literature. To those who have periodically asked ‘where is the book at?’, here is my answer. I am especially grateful to all those who took the time to complete my on-line survey, and respond to follow up questions, or were interviewed in person: Ray Alcock, Neil Ames, Malcolm Bancroft, Keith Beattie, Albert Bell, Michael Bollotin, John Book, Phillip Braithwaite, Marc Brennan, Catherine Brown, Norma Coates, Gregg Crossan, William Dart, Peter Dawson, Susan Fast, Michelle Flannery, Lee Ann Fullerton, Liz Giuffre, Matt Glesne, Barry Grant, Warren Green, Joel Hayward, Michelle Henry, Shane Homan, Hasse Huss, Jonathon Ibell, Tina Janering, Bruce Johnson, Anti-Ville Karja, Danny Keenan, Keir Keightley, Joe Kellich, Brett Loper, Colin McLeay, Steven Mallet, Lee Marshall, Jo Mason, Shawn Mawer, Allen Meek, Grant Mitchell, Tony Mitchell, Craig Morrison, Terry Newman, Andre Nuchelmans, Andrew Njsse, Paul Oliver, Shane Palmer, Gonny Pasaribu, Nick Plimmer, Aaron Regev, Motti Regev, Jane Roscoe, David Sanjek, Ian Shirley, Gary Shuker, Andrew Stafford, Geoff Stahl, Yngvar Steinbolt, Juliette Taylor, Mark Vanderdrift, Laura Vroomen, Steve Waksman, Oliver Wang,\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nMichelle Wauchope, Michael Weber, Martin Webster, Lisa Wheeler, Craig Wilson, Joel Wing and Brennon Wood. One of the pleasures of the research has been eventually meeting a number of these collectors, in several cases, visiting them in their homes, viewing their collections and enjoying their hospitality. Copies of their unpublished work on record collecting were generously supplied by Lee Marshall (his PhD study of bootleggers and tape traders), Ed Montano (his dissertation on collecting The Shadows; thanks also to David Horn for alerting me to it), Julie Bogle (her graduate paper on women record collectors; thanks also to Nabeel Zuberi for alerting me to this), Lee Ann Fullerton (her conference papers on women collectors and the independent record shop) and Jonathon Kelso (his graduate project on on-line record collecting). The initial development of the project was shaped by informal chats with Henry Barnard, Tom Gati, Simon Hay, Peter McLennan, Allen Meek, and Dave Laing and John Shepherd. It was subsequently extended through discussions, in some cases on-going since 2002, with Peter Dawson, Susan Fast, Haase Huss, Craig Morrison, Andre Nuchelmans, Michael Pickering, Gary Shuker, Geoff Stahl, Simon Sweetman, Jim Urry and Tom Weber. Tim Anderson alerted me to the work of Robert Crumb and Harvey Pekar. Most recently, Gabor Valyi, Mikey Vallee and Johannes Brusila provided helpful references and insights on the history of vinyl and its current revival. Alan Lewis, the editor of Record Collector, was very helpful in clarifying my use of the magazine, and providing me with a personal perspective on his own collecting and career in the music press. Ian Shirley, the editor of the Rare Record Price Guide 2010, and writer of a regular column in Record Collector, provided extensive replies to my questions about the current state of record collecting. Useful feedback on ‘work in progress’ was made by those attending my papers at IASPM (the International Association for the Study of Popular Music) conferences in Turku, Finland in June 2001, Montreal in 2003 and Wellington, New Zealand in 2006, and at seminars at Victoria University in 2006 and 2008 and Otago University in 2008. Helpful commentary on various early drafts of material has been provided by Keith Beattie, Ed Montano and Mary Jane Shuker. At Ashgate, Derek Scott provided insightful comments on the initial proposal and Heidi Bishop proved extremely patient as I stumbled towards providing the final manuscript. My thanks also to Jonathan Hoare, for exemplary copy-editing.

I refer to it as a social practice since the characteristics, motivations and practices exhibited by record collectors are social activities. I focus on the questions of who collects, and why, what is being collected and the process of collecting, including sites of acquisition, the thrill of the chase and the ‘find’. I also consider the context created by the music industry, especially the role of the music press and record companies in both shaping and responding to record collecting. In considering these questions, I draw on the general literature on collecting, along with previous studies of record collecting, historical and contemporary profiles of record collectors, including a number of personal interviews (see Appendix 1), and other relevant secondary literature on popular music. In addition, I have utilized the music press, primarily the collector oriented publications. As a long-time collector (see Appendix 2), I also draw on my own experiences, in part through a ‘participant observer’ study of what can be termed sites of acquisition: record shops, record fairs, and thrift shops, and through the internet. Reflecting the location of the collectors I talked to, my coverage is restricted largely to record collecting in the United Kingdom and the United States, with some examples from Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. Let me begin with some indications of the scope of collecting popular music and the widespread interest in it, as both an economic and cultural commodity, during 2007–08: •\n\nIn early 2008, the ‘World’s Greatest Record Collection’ was offered for sale on eBay, with a starting bid of (US) $3 million, and an estimated value of $50 million. By the end of March 2008, more people had window-shopped the collection than any other item offered in eBay’s history. Consisting of an estimated six million recordings, it had been put together by its owner Paul Mawhinny, over some fifty years, and stored in his 16,000 square\n\nThis is not a book about which records – and associated musical artefacts – are collectable, where to find these and how much they are worth. These topics are necessarily engaged with here, but extensive information on them is readily available from introductions such as Dave Thompson’s excellent The Music Lover’s Guide to Record Collecting (Backbeat, San Francisco, 2002), the various Record Price Guides, the main collector magazines, notably the UK-based Record Collector and, in the United States, Goldmine (see Chapter 6); and collector websites such as the Record Collectors Guild.\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\n• •\n\n•\n\n• • •\n\n•\n\nfoot, climate controlled combination record shop and archive in Pittsburgh, United States. The 10th edition of the Rare Record Price Guide was published, now a massive tome of 1,408 pages, and featuring colour illustrations. The rarest listings included the two-LP set The Beatles (Apple, 1968) at £5–7,000. In 2008, the opening, due for 2009, of the Abba Museum in Stockholm was announced. Capitalizing on the continued fascination with the Swedish pop quartet, the most commercially successful group of the 1970s, the new museum will feature the gold and platinum discs of former band members. Guinness Publications issued California Dreaming: Memories and Visions of LA 1966–1975, by photographer Henry Diltz, in a print run of 2,000 copies; the signed, handmade limited edition book was available for £225 (Record Collector, January 2008: 20). Auction house Christies, New York, November 2007 sale of rock’n’roll memorabilia included a signed copy of Jimi Hendrix’s Axis Bold as Love vinyl album, along with related photos, which sold for US$23,000. Long-established music fairs in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States attracted large numbers of collectors. Despite the continued decline of the record industry, the reissues labels were stronger than ever, with a plethora of individual reissues and boxed sets from record companies such as Ace, Cherry Red and Rhino (De Whalley, 2007). A week in the life of a collector, April 2008: I purchased a copy of Lester Bangs’s extremely scarce book on Blondie, from local web auction site Trade Me (cost NZ$10); obtained a June 2004 issue of MOJO – the Morrissey cover – needed to complete a run of the magazine, from a second hand bookstore (NZ$2); and found a near-mint copy in a local thrift shop of Iron Butterfly’s 1970 Live album (NZ$3), featuring the extended version of the band’s ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’, a catalyst in establishing ‘progressive’ FM radio programming.\n\nhttp://www.thegreatestmusiccollection.com. The collection was not sold, and was subsequently purchased privately. Often referred to as ‘The White Album’, it is the unique numbering system that makes this the most collectable UK album; the album was released with its sleeves numbered consecutively for the first 500,000 copies, each number embossed on the cover. This valuation was for copies numbered between 1 and 10 (Rare Record Price Guide 2010, 10th edition, published at the end of 2008). Number 00010 was sold at a Christies auction in 2001 for £6,000. http://www.abbathemuseum.com (Abba broke up in 1982). This illustrates the role of the search and ‘the find’, especially at a bargain price, as central to the enjoyment of collecting. All of these were obtainable on the web, but at greater cost.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs these examples suggest, I am using the term ‘record collecting’ as shorthand for a variety of distinct but related practices. ‘Record collecting’ can be pursued via the collection of particular formats, genres, performers, record labels, producers or some combination of these. It can also embrace the use of – and sometimes collecting of – related print materials: the music press generally, but especially the specialist collector magazines, fanzines, discographies and general guidebooks; the recording industry targeting of collectors (reissue labels; promotional releases, remixes, boxed sets); and dedicated sites of acquisition (record fairs, second-hand and specialist shops, eBay and high-profile auctions). The term ‘records’ is often used to refer to vinyl recordings, but here I use it to include sound recordings in any format, most notably shellac 78s, vinyl LPs and 45s, audiotapes, CDs and as digital downloads. A brief history of record collecting Record collecting has a now extensive, although largely unexplored history. During the mid-to-late nineteenth century, a mix of capitalism and consumerism, increased leisure time, disposable income and nostalgia made collecting a significant aspect of the social identity for the new middle classes of Europe, Britain and its colonies, and the United States. Record collecting as a social practice was a logical extension of such activities. At the end of the nineteenth century sound became ‘a thing’, a material product for sale in the market (see the discussion in Chapter 1). Its subsequent reproduction as a cultural and economic artefact has produced the ‘sound recording’ in its various historical formats, along with related technology, memorabilia and literature. Record collectors who were active during the period 1903 to the 1950s and the advent of vinyl collected 78s and, in some cases, cylinders as well. This group established ‘record collecting’ as a major form of collecting, with its own set of practices and related literature. These early collectors were associated with the emergence of what can be termed a gramophone culture, which embraced a number of sites: physical and social spaces, and institutions which facilitated and shaped the production and consumption of recorded music. These included the early recording companies, record clubs and appreciation societies, music retail outlets and the second-hand market, and the music press. By the introduction of vinyl records in the 1950s, record collecting was already a well-established ‘hobby’. Record collecting since the1960s has seen the steady expansion of the overarching infrastructure within which the hobby was already embedded: the rise of record fairs, specialist record shops (independent and second hand), increased major label interest in reissues and their back catalogue, specialist reissue labels, and a collector press. Well documented in the United Kingdom and the United States, such developments are also evident internationally. Looking back in 1996, Peter Doggett observed:\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures As we discovered, there was no such thing as a pop or rock’n’roll collector until the 1960s. Only then did dealers start importing material from the US, and loyal R&B fans began to flood into places like Soho market in London every weekend, searching through piles of old 45s and 78s in the hopes of finding an obscure rockabilly or blues gem. (Doggett, 1996a: editorial)\n\nFrom there, a small but dedicated collectors’ network began to spread across the country. By the early 1970s, there were specialist shops, mail order dealers, and a bunch of soul, rnb and r’n’r fanzines. Around the same time, the reissue market – which had always been a purely low budget affair – started very slowly to get off the ground. (Doggett, 1987: 16)\n\nA key moment was the establishment of Record Collector magazine, in 1979, which provided a focus for collectors. A similar pattern was evident in the United States: What started as a small-time, largely underground hobby has expanded into a respected, full-fledged industry. In 1974, almost no one could make a living collecting music. Now [1994], with the advent of computer databases, new recording options and more, the hobby/industry is more efficient, lucrative and wide-reaching than it ever has been before. (Thompson, 1994)\n\nThe launch of Goldmine in 1974 did much to consolidate record collecting in North America. The landscape of record collecting has changed dramatically in the past 15 to 20 years. The range of collectibles has increased, with promotional material and memorabilia more prominent. Record collecting has become more organized, more intense and, at times, more expensive. The internet has added a major new dimension to collecting, creating increased opportunity but also fuelling price rises. Reflecting such developments, the record collecting press has mushroomed, with a succession of ever-larger and more comprehensive magazines, guidebooks, price guides and discographies. Today, record collecting is a major form of collecting, with its own set of collecting practices. Yet while record collecting is a significant social activity, it remains a relatively neglected aspect of the consumption of popular music. There is a plethora of guidebooks on record collecting, but these focus primarily on documenting artists and their collectable recordings, and their economic value, along with some attention to questions such as where to find records, the importance of condition and their care. In academia, general studies of music consumption, especially fandom, provide some insights, but more extended critical discussion is sparse. Accordingly, the topic is ripe for a fuller analysis, with particular attention to the\n\nIntroduction\n\nmotivations and characteristics of collectors as well as their collecting practices and the context within which these take place. The following sections introduce some of the relevant literature on collecting more generally and, then, record collecting in particular. The themes and concerns evident here are ones that will be returned to throughout this study. Collecting We can point to the development of a collecting sensibility, linked to possessive individualism, historically present since the Greeks, but more fully realized under contemporary capitalism. As social anthropologist James Clifford puts it, in the Western world, ‘collecting has long been the strategy for the deployment of a possessive self, culture, and authenticity’ (Clifford, 1988: 218). Today, as Pearce observes, ‘the gathering together of chosen objects for purposes regarded as special is of great importance, as a social phenomenon, as a focus of personal emotion, and as an economic force’ (Pearce, 1995: Preface). Collecting is a very common activity: in the contemporary Western world around a quarter to a third of adults are willing to identify themselves as collectors, and this ‘collecting disposition’ cuts across class and gender boundaries (Belk, 2001; Pearce, 1995; 1998). The extensive Leicester Collecting Project amply demonstrated, with the exception of the financially very expensive collectibles (Old Master paintings and suchlike), that every kind of collection occurs in every kind of social background (Pearce, 1997). In examining the social location of collectors there has been very limited attention paid to the role of ethnicity and class, but the ‘gendering’ of collecting has attracted considerable attention. While there is convincing survey evidence that the majority of collectors are women, male collectors and their preferred collectibles usually are given more public prominence. The studies by Pearce, Belk and others show that most children collect, and both boys and girls are equally likely to be avid collectors before their teenage years. During adolescence collecting declines for both boys and girls, but especially for girls. There is a tendency for men to renew collecting in middle age – a trend not seen to the same extent among women. In general, women’s emotional investment in the collecting process, and the nature of the artefacts collected, differs from that of men, with a greater emphasis on domesticrelated collectibles, while men are more interested in the investment rationale of collecting. As Belk argues, ‘collecting is most often a highly gendered activity with the greatest social sanction for those collections and collector traits that fit masculine sex-role stereotypes’ (Belk, 2001: 99). Characteristic collector traits include those identified as ‘masculine’: aggressiveness, competitiveness, desire for mastery over a symbolic realm; and those seen as ‘feminine’: preservation, creativity and nurturance. These can, of course, be combined: collecting is one of the few socially sanctioned opportunities for men to be expressive, while at the same time being aggressive and competitive.\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nGiven its social prominence, it is hardly surprising that collecting has been the subject of considerable theoretical speculation and empirical study, with major contributions from sociology, anthropology, history, social psychology, museum studies and market research, especially consumer studies. Most recently, collecting is an aspect of the study of material culture, which has defined itself as a distinct area of academic inquiry. Key questions addressed in this body of work include: In what ways do we interact with material things? How do material objects affect the way we relate to each other? What are the connections between material things and social processes? (See Miller, 1998; 2006; Tilley et al., 2006.) The literature on collecting embraces a now fairly standard set of motifs and an associated vocabulary. Collectors and the collecting process are variously associated with: longing, desire and pleasure; ritualistic, near-sacred and repetitive acquisition; passionate and selective consumption; stewardship and cultural preservation; and obsession and linked pathologies such as completism, accumulation and a preoccupation with collection size. The collection exhibits a series of attributes: it is a source of pleasure; an economic investment; an exhibition of logic, unity and control; an indicator of cultural and social capital; and a socially sanctioned form of materialist and competitive consumption, consumer culture taken to excess As shall be demonstrated later, all of these are present among record collectors and their collecting. Record collecting Belk provides a working definition of ‘collecting’, which is essentially compatible with others in the literature: ‘the process of actively, selectively, and passionately acquiring things removed from ordinary use and perceived as part of a set of nonidentical objects or experiences’ (Belk, 2001: 67). This is essentially to distinguish collecting from acquisitiveness and accumulation, though elements of both may be part of the collector’s persona and collecting practices. However, elements of Belk’s definition of collecting are awkward in relation to record collecting. Sound recordings are largely mass-produced artefacts, and therefore hardly non-identical in that individual copies exist even if from the same master recording. Further, even when collected, recordings will frequently retain a strong element of use value – people will play them – thereby placing them not too distant from ‘ordinary’ use. More useful for my purposes is the work of Pearce, who distinguishes three coexisting modes of the relationship of collectors to the collected object: souvenir, fetishistic and systematic. In souvenir collecting, ‘the individual creates a romantic life-history by selecting and arranging personal memorial material to create It is, however, the exceptions to the mass-produced recordings that are often the most sought-after and valuable collectibles, such as unique album covers, promos, acetates and test pressings.\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhat … might be called an object autobiography, where the objects are at the service of the autobiographer’. In contrast, in fetishistic collecting ‘the objects are dominant and … are allowed to create the self of the collector, who responds by obsessively collecting as many items as possible’. Thirdly, systematic collecting is characterized by an ‘intellectual rationale’, with the emphasis placed on the completeness of the collection (Pearce, 1995: 32). Pearce stresses that the three approaches are not exclusive, and can coexist in each collection. Each of these collecting modes are represented among record collectors, broadly corresponding to varying emphases: on recordings as part of identity formation and life history (souvenir collecting); accumulation and completism (fetishistic collecting); and discrimination and connoisseurship (systematic collecting). Muesterberger, a psychoanalyst, claims, ‘Collectors themselves – dedicated, serious, infatuated, beset – cannot explain or understand this all-consuming drive … is it an obsession? An addiction? Is it a passion or urge, or perhaps a need to hold, or possess, to accumulate?’ (Muesterberger, 1994: 3). This is an overstatement. While it is true that many collectors find it difficult to pinpoint the precise set of motivations that drive their collecting, they are frequently well aware of the various explanations offered for it (see, for example, the biographical accounts in Blom, 2002; Elsner and Cardinal, 1994). This was particularly evident among my record collectors, whose responses to two central questions covering self-definition and perceptions of collectors and the collecting process showed considerable awareness of the ‘High Fidelity’ stereotype, along with a concern to distance personal practice from this. As Chapter 2 shows, their responses suggest a range of characteristics associated with the label ‘record collector’, while demonstrating that the concept is far from a unitary one. Given that record collectors can be regarded as a type of fan, the literature on fandom is relevant to a consideration of record collecting. The traditional view of fandom has situated it in terms of pathology and deviance, reserving the label ‘fans’ for teenagers who are generally presented as avidly and uncritically following the latest pop sensation. These fans have been unfairly denigrated in most writing on popular music and, indeed, by many other consumers. Their behaviour is often described as a form of pathology, and the terms applied to it have clear connotations of condemnation and undesirability: ‘Beatlemania’, ‘teenyboppers’, ‘groupies’ (Lewis, 1992). As Nick Hornby’s novel High Fidelity (1995) suggests, a similar labelling process can be seen in the tendency to associate record collecting with paradigms of obsession and addiction, arrested adolescence and social awkwardness. This image of the record collector as anti- or a-social has been reinforced by the manner in which the phenomenon is treated in other popular texts, including the film Ghost World, and the cartoons by Robert Crumb and Harvey Pekar featuring record collectors. The contributors to Lewis’s classic study showed fandom to be a complex phenom­enon, related to the formation of social identities, especially sexu­ality. This view of fandom as an active process has been confirmed by later studies, which essentially view fandom as a form of sustained affective consumption (Sandvoss,\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\n2005; for accounts from fans themselves, see Aizelwood, 1994; Hunter, 2004; Smith, 1995). This approach is evident in several accounts of popular music fans, notably Cavicchi’s detailed ethnography of Bruce Springsteen fans, whose collecting of Springsteen recordings, including bootlegs, was a significant aspect of many of their lives (Cavicchi, 1998). Such fandom offers its participants membership of a community not defined in traditional status terms. We can usefully extend the term fan to embrace those who see them­selves as ‘serious’ devotees or aficionados of particular musical styles or performers. These are fans in terms of the word’s origins in ‘fanatic’, but their fanaticism is usually at more of an intellectual level and focused on the music per se rather than on the persona of the performer(s). Indeed, such individuals would often not describe themselves as ‘fans’, preferring instead to describe themselves as ‘into’ particular performers or genres, or as ‘music lovers’ or, indeed, as ‘record collectors’. Adopting this distinction is not to perpetuate an aesthetically-based, discriminatory view of the former group (fans in the traditional sense). Both categories of fan engage in fandom as an active process, and both often display impressive knowledge of their preferred genres or performers. My argument is that their emotional and physical investments are different, as are the social consumption situations in which their fandom operates. As Campbell observes, ‘A record collection does not a record collector make’ (Campbell, 2001). This is to make a central distinction between (simply) liking the music – in the sense of a fan, or music lover – and methodically seeking out and acquiring it. Consequently, possessing an abundance of records is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the self-recognition of a ‘collector’. The central factor is the systematic approach to acquiring new material for the collection, a characteristic commonly seen as distinguishing collecting: ‘In the collecting form of consumption, acquisition is a key process. Someone who possesses a collection is not necessarily a collector unless they continue to acquire additional things for the collection’ (Belk, 2001: 66). While fans will collect records, record collectors are more often characterized by what can be termed ‘secondary involvement’ in music, activities beyond ‘simply’ listening to the music: the seeking out of rare releases, such as the picture discs and bootlegs; the reading of fanzines in addition to commercial music magazines; concert going; and an interest in record labels and producers as well as performers. As this brief discussion has indicated, attempts to define (record) collecting and the (record) collector are fraught. Such concepts are far from unitary, and should be regarded as a set of motifs and social practices, themes that shall be returned to throughout this study. Investigating the record collector There are a small number of studies of record collectors and record collecting. The best known of these is Will Straw’s contribution to Sexing the Groove. Drawing\n\nIntroduction\n\non some of the considerable general literature on collecting and collectors, Straw usefully speculates on the psychology of record collecting as a social practice, especially its largely male character. He identifies several characteristics of record collecting ‘which are more easily recuperable’: hipness, connoisseurship, bohemianism and the adventurous hunter. These are related to the record collector’s ‘obscurantist interest in the marginal’, a stance which clearly resonates with ‘rock culture’s mythic emphasis on oppositionality’. The valorizing of the obscure is linked to trash fandoms generally, and the consequent discourse surrounding these is a feature of the homosocial world of young men (Straw, 1997a). While frequently convincing, Straw’s analysis arguably lacks any systematic embedding in the views of the collectors themselves. Collectors feature more prominently in a number of recent academic studies: Hayes (2006) on young Canadian vinyl collectors in the digital age; Dougan (2006) on canon formation and blues record collecting; Hosokawa and Matsuoka’s historical analysis (2004) of vinyl record collecting in Japan; and Marshall’s study of bootleggers and tape traders (2005). Unpublished graduate research studies include Bogle (1999) on women who collect records; Kelso (2007) on digital collecting; and Montano (2003) on Cliff Richard record collectors. Other published accounts include Incredibly Strange Music, profiling collectors of exotica (Vale and Juno, 1993; 1994); Milano’s study of well-known vinyl collectors (Milano, 2003); and Dean’s account of 78 collector Joe Bussard (Dean, 2001). There is also an on-going series on individual collectors in the magazine Record Collector; and the documentaries Vinyl, by Canadian film-maker and collector Alan Zweig, and Desperate Man Blues (on Joe Bussard). An entertaining and informative account of the hunt aspect of record collecting is provided by Blecha (2005), and there are several accounts of ‘digging in the crates’ (for example, Schloss, 2004). In addition to the academic literature and popular journalism, the representation of record collectors and collecting in various popular culture texts has been important in establishing a stereotypical view. As already indicated, popular discourse around record collectors and collecting, in common with discussions of collecting generally, construct a dominant representation of record collectors as obsessive males, whose passion for collecting is often a substitute for ‘real’ social relationships, and who exhibit a ‘trainspotting’ mentality toward popular music, a concern with the details of recordings. This is very much the case in the best-known representation of record collectors, the novel High Fidelity (Hornby, 1995), and the subsequent film of the same name, directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Cusack, released in 2000. With some reference to the above literature, this study draws primarily on 70 extensive ‘interviews’ with record collectors, mostly undertaken in 2002–03, with some follow ups and new interviewees in 2007–08 (see Appendix 1 for details). In addition to this body of work in English, there is Robert Haagsma’s Vinylfanaten, a study of 22 avid vinyl collectors from Holland and Belgium; see Record Collector, September 2007: 10–11.\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\n10\n\nMy opportunity sample fell into two groups of record collectors, although with some overlap between them: 1. An older group (largely 40 plus) who collect rock and pop recordings, primarily within the period 1945 to 1980, with a marked preference for vinyl. This group is almost exclusively male. Their preferred genres include reggae, ’60s guitar rock, psychedelia/garage, rockabilly and surf. While love of music is central to their collecting, there is some concern with the rarity and associated economic value of the recordings. 2. A younger group (under 40) who primarily collect popular music on CDs, although with some attention to vinyl. Their genre preferences at times include the 1950s through to and into the ’70s, but their collecting focus is usually on genres of the last 20 years, especially non-mainstream styles such as punk, goth, new wave and rap. While males are still in the majority here, there are a number of women collectors within this group. While several of these collectors are aware of rarity and economic values, and may even spend considerable amounts on particular recordings, they are arguably more concerned with the aesthetic qualities of the recordings: the music as such. The ‘social practices’ of both groups, shared by other record collectors, presents an interwoven narrative of desire and identification, alongside notions of cultural and economic value, which characterize many collectors’ accounts of their passion. Book structure Chapter 1: The 78 era: creating a collector constituency The chapter covers the early development of record collecting, following the advent of sound recording and the rise of a gramophone culture. It considers the early collectors of 78s, their motivations and collecting practices, and the context in which they collected: the role of record labels, record clubs and the music press, especially the collector magazines, and music retail. The chapter then sketches the post-1960 collecting of 78s. Chapter 2: The contemporary collector: beyond the High Fidelity stereotype Contemporary record collectors are shown to demonstrate a complex mix of characteristics: a love of music; obsessive-compulsive behaviour, accumulation and completism, selectivity and discrimination; and self-education and scholarship. As a social practice, contemporary record collecting presents itself as a core component of individual social identity and a central part of the lifecycle, related\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nto issues of cultural consumption, social identity and ‘the construction of self’ in contemporary society. Chapter 3: Formats, collectors and the music industry The focus here is on the development of successive recording formats, along with the collecting of each. Individual collector preferences relate to an amalgam of the age of the collector and associated notions of nostalgia, historicism and authenticity; availability, collector ambition and cost; and aesthetics, in terms of preferred artists and genres, sound quality, and aspects such as album cover art. The chapter begins with an examination of the historical development of the various recording formats, moving from these to the collecting of each. It then considers the role of the music industry in both responding to and shaping the record collecting market. Chapter 4: Taste, the canon and the collectable This chapter considers the issues of taste and cultural capital, and what is ‘collectable’. Intersecting with personal taste is the key notion of ‘collectable’, with the collecting process and what is collectable shaped by considerations of demand and availability; condition and cost; aura and authenticity; and rarity and value. Taste and what is collectable are historically contingent, reflecting generational and demographic trends in collecting, and both engage with varying forms of cultural capital. The complex interaction of these various factors is illustrated through a consideration of collectable artists, genres and recent top-selling recordings. What is collectable can also be informed by a strong sense of discrimination, in part based on views of which artists, recordings and genres have musical/aesthetic value: a canon. There are also collectable fields which are not (necessarily) so informed by these collecting principles, but which are subsumed under the broad rubric of ‘record collecting’. Examples of these are the collecting of chart number 1 hits, compilations, bootlegs, memorabilia and music magazines; these are underpinned by different inflections of taste and collectability. Chapter 5: Collecting practices Hunting metaphors abound in the general literature on collecting, and collectors frequently refer to notions of pleasure and desire in the pursuit of items for their collection. This is a process involving competition, effort (as with visiting sites of acquisition and the physical act of sorting through records) and choice (between desired items, especially if budget is a consideration), underpinned by a strong element of compulsion. The chapter examines the collectors hunt for new material, and the various sites for its acquisition. Also considered are issues and\n\n12\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\npractices around the storage and cataloguing of the collection, whether or not to lend recordings, and the public and private display of the collection. Chapter 6: Record collecting and the music press The music press is a key part of the infrastructure of record collecting. Record collectors are among the readers of the music press in general, but also consume a number of publications aimed more specifically at them. These include general collecting guides, price guides, discographies, and magazines such as Record Collector and Goldmine. As the field of collecting has grown, there has been a proliferation of this literature, along with increased specialization among its titles. This chapter examines the historical development of these publications since 1970, their emphases and the use made of them by record collectors. Chapter 7: Collector profiles In ‘cut and pasting’ individual collectors across the various chapters and topics covered, rarely does a sense of ‘the whole collector’ – the individual voice – emerge. Accordingly, this last chapter includes a series of ten collector profiles. Most are collectors with whom I have had on-going contact over the past eight or nine years, in some cases, even longer. This time frame demonstrates the shifting physical and emotional investments made by collectors in the hobby, as their musical interests and life circumstances change. I have chosen them to represent a range of collecting interests, ages and geographic locations. Conclusion The conclusion to this study draws on the seven chapters to make some general observations on record collectors and their collecting practices and the context within which these take place. It also considers collecting in relation to the wider study of collecting. As the general discussion and the extended profiles (Chapter 7) show, it is difficult to sustain a unitary definition of the record collector and record collecting. Rather, given the different emphases and practices taken on over time by individual collectors, I argue that it makes more sense to speak of ‘a career’ in record collecting.\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe 78 era: creating a collector constituency This chapter begins with the early development of record collecting, as the advent of recorded sound at the end of the nineteenth century created a new form of music collectible, associated with the emergence of what can be termed a gramophone culture. Record collectors active during the period 1903 to the 1950s and the advent of vinyl collected 78s and, in some cases, cylinders. This group established ‘record collecting’ as a major form of collecting, with its own set of practices, associated literature and appreciation societies. These collectors had a shared interest in sound recordings as both sources of listening pleasure and significant cultural artefacts, with associated notions of discrimination, musical canons and rarity. They also shared the dominant characteristics of collectors more generally, albeit with particular inflections of these: the thrill of the chase; obsession, linked to accumulation and completism; at times a preoccupation with rarity and economic value; and a concern for cultural preservation. The concern involved self-education and public, vernacular scholarship, drawing on the collection as a resource. These traits were subsumed into collecting as a significant aspect of social identity, involving the acquisition of cultural capital, overlaid with a patina of nostalgia. Gramophone culture operated within a context that shaped the emergence and subsequent development of a collecting constituency and record collecting as a social practice. While there is frequent overlap between them, especially through their respective roles in shaping taste and discrimination (including canon formation), this context included a number of sites: physical and social spaces, practices and institutions which facilitated and shaped the production and consumption of recorded music and its collectors. These sites were: • • • •\n\nsites of production and promotion: the role of the early recording companies; sites of appreciation: record clubs and societies; sites of acquisition: music retail, and the second-hand market; and sites of mediation: the music press.\n\nA consideration of these forms the second part of the chapter. What I have termed the 78 era was over by 1960. The 78 was supplanted by vinyl during the 1950s, and the gramophone replaced by new forms of sound reproduction. But the passing of the 78 recording did not end interest in the era and its music. The recordings and the equipment used to play them have remained highly collectable. Since the 1960s, there has been a proliferation of interest in the\n\n14\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nperiod, with a considerable amount of scholarship devoted to documenting its music and the associated technologies. A good deal of this research has been undertaken by collectors. Today, there is an active network of 78 collector societies, specialist dealers and auction houses, and publications, with much of this accessible through the internet. The last section of the chapter briefly considers 78 collecting and collectors since the early 1960s. The rise of gramophone culture Collecting was a prominent part of the social life of the new middle classes, emerging along with industrialization and urbanization during the mid-to-late nineteenth century, with the collector’s ‘cabinet of curiosities’ a feature of many Victorian lounges (Blom, 2002). A mix of capitalism and consumerism, increased leisure time, disposable income and nostalgia made collecting a significant aspect of social identity for the middle classes of Europe, Britain and its colonies, and the United States. The state art galleries, museums and libraries of the Victorian era owed much to the generosity of those collectors who endowed and funded them. Music was already well established as a form of collectible by this time. Prominent collectors had built up libraries of music publications, especially sheet music (Hermann, 1999; King, 1963); the collecting and publication, and in some cases field recording, of traditional folk songs had emerged as a major movement, initially in England and on the European continent, then in North America and throughout the world (Oliver, 2003); and both private collectors and institutions had long collected musical instruments. Record collecting as a social practice was a logical extension of such activities. Indeed, collecting ‘sound recordings’ was an activity accessible to a wider, more socially democratic constituency, since it did not necessarily require the same levels of capital investment as traditional music collectibles. Edison invented the phonograph, a ‘talking machine’, in November 1877, a device which used cylinders to record and reproduce sound. The first commercially marketed recordings were produced by several companies, most notably Columbia. These early impressed tin foil records were very restricted in use, since they were destroyed once removed from the supporting metal cylinder. As such, they hardly made ideal collectibles. After some initial development, Edison abandoned the fledgling phonograph for a decade, turning instead to the development of electricity, but he eventually produced a considerably improved phonograph in 1887. Around the same time, Berliner further developed the new technology with his gramophone (1888), using a flat disc technique instead of the cumbersome cylinder. He tried several materials for the accompanying discs, before utilizing shellac in 1891, a compound derived from a natural resin secreted by the lac beetle. The shellac 78 became the industry standard, a position it maintained over the next half century. (On the development of sound recording, its technological and social impact, see Chanan, 1995; Copeland, 1991; Day, 2000; Millard, 1995.)\n\nThe 78 era\n\n15\n\nAs Fabrizio observes, ‘A period of nearly 20 years elapsed between the invention of sound recording/replay and the point at which the majority of Americans could afford to buy a talking machine’ (Fabrizio, 1999). The resurrected phonograph was to be a business machine, but this application proved limited. However, an enterprising dealer equipped the phonographs with a coin-operated mechanism that played a cylinder, featuring a popular tune or comic monologue, through a set of ear tubes to the patron. These caught on hugely in the early 1890s, and were part of many public spaces and entertainment venues. In 1896, Edison and the Columbia label introduced the first machines targeting the home entertainment market in the United States. The phonograph represented the true beginning of recorded sound technology, replacing ‘the shared Victorian pleasures of bandstand and music hall with the solitary delight of a private world of sound’ (Millard, 1995: 1). By 1900, several large commercial recording companies were operating on a stable national basis, and listening to the various new ‘talking machines’ was a popular pastime. A strong link between hardware and software was established from the start of sound recording, with companies marketing both their models of the phonograph and the recordings to be played on it. The terms ‘phonograph’ and ‘gramophone’ were initially both widely used, indicating the different models, but the latter came to denote all forms of ‘record player’. By the early 1900s, it had emerged as the fashion accessory of the day and was recognized as a familiar object in the home. The recording industry took off around the turn of the century. In 1899, 151,000 phonographs were produced in the United States alone, and there was now a steady, though limited, supply of discs and pre-recorded cylinders. In 1897 only about 500,000 records had been sold in the United States, but by 1899 this number had reached 2.8 million, and continued to rise. In the United States, the period 1889–1912 saw the production of over 8,000 masters of Edison’s ‘TwoMinute Cylinders’, with total production running into the millions. Spoken word recordings by leading figures of the period formed an important part of the repertoire, which was associated with a concern with fidelity; ‘the illusion of real presence’, as Scientific American magazine termed it in 1877 (Thompson, 1996: 3). During the 1920s over 100 million records were sold in the United States alone, before the Depression brought the recording industry to the verge of collapse (Gronow, 1983). The gramophone, as various historians of recorded sound have observed, played a role in defining modernity, being put to use in ways that sharply changed the culture of music in the home and turning music into a ‘thing’ (see Eisenberg, 1988; Kenney, 1999). The domestication of recorded sound increased the musical repertoire available to the home listener, while freeing up the experience of music from its physical location in place and time. As Gronow put it, ‘the musician became immortal’ (Gronow, 1983: 54).\n\n16\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nThe first record collectors Those who first began collecting recordings, primarily 78s, although in some cases cylinders as well, established ‘record collecting’ as a major form of collecting, with its own set of collecting practices and associated literature. They also helped form the dominant image of the record collector as an obsessive personality, although this must be strongly qualified in relation to their sense of community, their role in cultural preservation and their sociability. These first record collectors are difficult to profile extensively, since biographical material is sparse. My account is reliant on a handful of previously published profiles and recollections, scattered across a range of monographs, biographies and journal articles. Most are of collectors initially active in the 1940s. As might be expected, more material is available on collectors whose activities had a wider profile, through the writings and recordings they produced drawing on their collections. These include the folk collectors Alan Lomax and Harry Smith, blues aficionados John Hammond and Jerry Wexler, classical music collectors such as Compton McKenzie and Michael Corenthal, and prominent jazz collectors such as Brian Rusk. They were concentrated in those countries and areas subject to the greatest penetration of gramophone culture, especially the United States, England and Western Europe, but also in Japan, New Zealand and Australia. As a group, it would appear that they were exclusively male and often of middle-class backgrounds. Of course this claim must be related to the point that it is usually members of socially dominant groups who leave the majority of surviving historical traces. The field of record collecting was initially largely a male preserve. The biographies and recollections I have accessed are all by and about men, and few saw fit to comment on the absence of women from their collecting activities. Explanations for this situation include the point that time and disposable income, even more so than now, were more available to males. It would also have been difficult for women to break into the masculine peer groups who dominated early record clubs and societies. The gendered nature of related psychological and personality attributes have seen the subsequent common perception of record collecting as a male activity (see Chapter 2, for discussion of the gendered nature of contemporary record collecting). This also appears to be very much a white group in the United States, where in the 1920s there was only a tiny black middle class, and they did not represent enough disposable income to be catered for by most recording companies. As the existence of ‘race records’ and associated labels (from Okey in the 1920s) indicates, black people bought records, but if any collected in any systematic way, no traces of this activity have survived. The middle-class location of collectors is supported by the professional backgrounds of the collectors profiled, while the earliest known American collectors of jazz and blues were university students. John Hammond, who studied at Yale, later reflected on the appeal of black culture: ‘All music fascinated me, but the simple honesty and convincing lyrics of the early\n\nThe 78 era\n\n17\n\nblues singers, the rhythm and creative ingenuity of the jazz players, excited me most – certainly all those I liked best – were black’ (Hammond, 1977: 30). What was collected? The genre interests of these early record collectors in both the United States and the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad groups, with little overlap between them: 1. Those collecting in the classical repertoire, especially vocal (opera). Initial collecting interest was largely in this genre, in part as classical music was already a well-established and valued art form. 2. Those collecting within ‘popular music’, often collectively termed ‘Early American music’ or ‘old time music’, and including the various genres which progressively emerged: jazz, big band, c&w (country and western), r&b (rhythm and blues – usually referred to as ‘race’ music until the 1950s) and the various ‘ethnic’ musics associated with American immigrant groups. While the classical collectors valorized the aesthetic qualities of recordings, the ‘popular’ collectors more frequently valued scarcity, combined with associated notions of authenticity. I draw here on both groups for examples of collecting practices. Behind the collecting impulse The early record collectors were motivated by a mix of motives: a love of the music, a concern with cultural preservation, scholarship and education. Michael Corenthal provides an evocative example of a love of the music of the 78 era and its performers: Amid the usual assortment [of an accumulation of discs left by a husband to his widow] was a small box of these superb Wisconsin black and blue label Paramount recordings. Keep talking. Well, I [Corenthal] wasn’t about to let history go down the tubes so I captured these rare Black stylists of the 1920’s jazz and blues performances. One item of memorable fondness was Paramount #12252. This was a Paramount recording from October 1924 featuring Ma Rainey and her Georgia Jazz band. It wasn’t a bad little band at that, accompanying the principals were Louis Armstrong on cornet, Buster Bailey on clarinet, and Fletcher Henderson on piano. Right on. I can [now] appreciate Ma Rainey because I’ve had the opportunity to appreciate her extraordinary recordings. (Corenthal, 1986: 12)\n\n18\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nAt times lurking alongside such enthusiasms were usually less lauded, psychological tendencies: compulsion and addiction, with their associated tendencies of accumulation and completism, and the emphasis on the ‘hunt’ aspect of collecting. The case of Dr John Grams illustrates such a mix. In 1946, the release of the Columbia picture The Jolson Story led John to collect Al Jolson’s recordings. Temporarily, he was satisfied owning the Jolson recordings on Decca Records released from the film and newer releases such as the Anniversary Song. One day, while visiting a radio store in Sheboygan, John saw jutting out of a wire rack a Brunswick release #4033 issued in 1928 featuring the younger Jolson performing at the height of his career Sonny Boy and There’s a Rainbow ’Round My Shoulder. John simply had to have this record, quite scratched and very dusty. When he approached the proprietor about this matter, the fellow seemed quite annoyed by his interest and demanded the astronomical sum of $2.00 for this shellac beater. (Corenthal, 1986: 123)\n\nJohn was stunned, since new 78s were then selling at 53¢, but still bought it: ‘A collector was born and without any clue or system, John began addressing the problem of how to find other Jolson recordings from the past.’ Eventually he had them all. Cultural preservation, education and scholarship As Corenthal’s reference to ‘history’ indicates, cultural preservation was a major theme in the collecting activities of this group. Purchasing sound recordings was an important way for American immigrants to preserve their own folk culture, and motivated several prominent collectors, such as Ford Porter, ‘The Polka King’ (Corenthal, 1986: 98ff.). The collections they built up provided an invaluable archive for later compilations and re-releases of early American music, which otherwise would have been lost. In several cases, they also recorded and documented the music, as did blues collector Samuel Charters, John Lomax and his son Alan, and Joe Bussard. Perhaps the best known example of cultural preservation during this early period of collecting is Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music. Born in 1923 in Portland, Oregon, Smith grew up in and around Seattle, Washington. In 1940 he began to collect commercially released blues and country 78s from the 1920s and 1930s, records which were often cheaply available in thrift shops. In 1952, by which time his collection numbered tens of thousands, he assembled 84 discs by mostly forgotten performers on an anthology he entitled American Folk Music. Including recordings originally released by such still active labels as Columbia, Brunswick and Victor, the compilation was released by Folkways\n\nThe 78 era\n\n19\n\nRecords as three double LPs, re-titled the Anthology of American Folk Music (Cantwell, 1996; Dougan, 2006: 7–8). In 2000, a decade after Smith’s death in 1990, an intended fourth volume finally appeared, issued on two CDs (Revenant); the liner notes include a 1968 interview with Smith. In 2007 a tribute album indicated the Anthology’s continued legacy. Obsessive-compulsive behaviour As the various collector clubs/societies (below) indicate, there was a clear collegiality and sense of community among record collectors. While examples of competition, one-upmanship and social dislocation are present, more commonly their collecting provided the basis for enduring friendships. At times, however, the collecting practices of some early collectors, along with their general social habits, lend themselves to the classic images of collectors as obsessive personalities. Acquiring vast quantities of recordings, regardless of aesthetic value, was less evident in this early period, presumably reflecting a combination of the relatively high cost of records along with their more limited availability. Completism was more common. It included wanting every imaginable version of a particular tune; wanting all one artist’s output; and collecting every recording within a particular series: One of my early addictions [note the metaphor] was the Meditation Theme from the opera Thais. I [Corenthal] was enchanted by the violin solo by Mischa Elman on the single faced Victor Red Seal and would have rested my case if I hadn’t noticed another version by Fritz Kreisler on this same Victor Red Seal label and had to compare the two great violin virtuosos. The Victor Company really loved this tune because in a few months the Thais Meditation appeared to me again and this time the artist was Maude Powell. [this is pre-1920] … Thus a new aspect of collecting was opened up to me. Later on as a collectordealer, I stumbled into a goodly number of variations of a tune called Tiger Rag introduced in 1917 by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Now I became a serious fanatic. I scoured through stacks and stacks of records to come up with every conceivable rendition and just my luck, there were hundreds of recorded versions. (Corenthal, 1986: Introduction)\n\nWith his dealer’s hat on, Corenthal also participated in such a search for a collector ‘desperately seeking’ to complete a Wayne King collection:\n\nThe set became a foundation stone for the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, influencing performers such as Bob Dylan, Roger McGuinn (the Byrds) and Jerry Garcia (the Grateful Dead). It has continued to exert an influence, especially among folk revivalists.\n\n20\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures He had searched high and low in his career to locate everything Wayne King had ever recorded. He even convinced Wayne King himself to part with rare transcriptions after agreeing to have everything placed on tape. And yet with his devotional search and dedicated effort, one disc had eluded him. This was a Wayne King selection on a 1931 Victor Orthophonic recording of Stardust coupled with Ted Weem’s version of My Favorite Band. The recording issued at the height of the depression was only moderately successful and eventually dropped from the catalogue [Victor later reissued it around 1934 but with a different coupling]. The fellow in fact had several of these but was adamant about owning Victor #22656 containing the original issue. Finally I obtained the record. The fellow arrived with a record album containing space for ten discs from the beginning of Wayne King’s career. One slot was vacant and this was the pocket for Victor #22656. Once he stuck Stardust in the slot, I doubt if he ever went back to look at those records. That’s just part of the strange phenomenon of collecting. (Corenthal, 1986: Introduction)\n\nThese examples illustrate the key role played by the hunt in collecting, its obsessional overtones, and the attraction of ‘the aura’ of the original recording; I will have more to say about these in later chapters. In addition to collecting particular artists and styles of music, completists began collecting whole series of releases. Prominent examples of this were the Victor company’s Red Seal recordings, and the ‘Black Platties’, blues and jazz records by black artists, produced by Paramount in the 1920s. Discrimination, authenticity and value Among collectors of classical music, there was an emphasis on discrimination. This is strongly evident in the editorial columns and other contributions in The Gramophone (UK, 1923 on) and in several early collector guides. For example, Boris Semeonoff’s Record collecting; a guide for beginners, published in 1949, regarded collecting as a process involving discrimination, rather than simply personal taste: ‘Record collecting is a term used loosely to imply no more than the acquiring of a library of recorded music. Collecting, in the proper sense, implies taste, discrimination, and, increasingly, knowledge.’ And: ‘Mere quantity counts for little. Quality in the true sense is what counts, and quality and rarity are by no means synonymous (Semeonoff, 1949: 1). This discrimination is almost entirely predicated on aesthetic criteria, with some reference to the condition of the recording. Here collecting becomes part of the acquisition of middle-class cultural capital and its potential contribution to upward social mobility. On the other hand, among many collectors of early popular music, discrimination is not so much on aesthetic grounds, as on a preoccupation with authenticity and the aura of the artefact: in some cases the more obscure the recording the better. Again the collection provides a major source of cultural capital, though usually among one’s collecting peers rather than a larger social group. This leads to a\n\nThe 78 era\n\n21\n\npreoccupation with rarity, condition and economic value. The last was not the primary motivation of early collectors, since prices in the 1920s and ’30s were largely still within the reach of most collectors’ pockets. However, this changed as the dynamics of supply and demand shifted. While there was still a plethora of 78s available to the collector in the 1940s, some labels, performers and styles were already extremely rare. Semeonoff documented how, following the Second World War, this increased interest in and development of record collecting was evident in the current ‘Exchange and Mart’ section of The Gramophone, compared to a decade earlier. He observed that not only had the number of advertisements greatly increased, but so had prices – ‘very considerably’ (Semeonoff, 1949: 19). Paradoxically, however, while many early collectors were now prepared to pay large sums for the scarcer recordings, typically more pleasure remained in obtaining an item very cheaply, usually from a seller who has no idea of its ‘real’ value. The collecting context I turn now to the context within which early record collecting took place: the role of the industry, record clubs and societies, and the music press in manipulating and mediating the collecting process; and the hunt for records. Marketing to collectors A range of marketing practices emerged amongst the early recording companies. While these were oriented towards the general market, most also targeted the music collector, several almost exclusively so. The most obvious marketing strategy was the production of catalogues and other advertising material. Both of these are themselves now very collectable, and linked to the continued interest in collecting 78s, along with antique phonographs. Victor, Zonophone and Columbia all published catalogues and monthly record supplements from the early 1900s. These alerted retailers and collectors to what was available, and also to what was not; consequently, collectors often lobbied companies to release recordings of particular repertoires/performers. An important promotional strategy was the production of ‘celebrity’ discs (by better-known artists), which were sold at a higher price, adding to their cultural cachet. The Gramophone Company of Great Britain released a number of these between 1920 and 1925. They featured different coloured labels, representing different prices, ‘which in turn reflected the eminence of the performers’ (Copeland, 1991: 39). Perhaps the best-known example of this music industry practice is the well-documented Red Seal recordings. A related marketing practice, since it frequently featured celebrity recordings, was the very successful subscription service introduced in the United Kingdom by HMV in 1931. This collected subscription advances for great but as yet unrecorded classical compositions,\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\n22\n\nmaking them only when the required commercially viable number of subscribers had been reached, a strategy especially appropriate in the depression years (Chanan, 1995). A further strategy was the release of picture discs, first produced in the 1920s, by companies in Germany, Great Britain and the United States. The best known are those later released by Vogue, in 1946–47, in a limited series (of 74) which became highly collectable. The often visually striking picture discs appealed to collectors attracted by their aesthetics. They also attracted the interest of those who wanted a fuller collection of their preferred performer(s), and had the appeal of a bounded series, with at least the possibility of completion. Usually available commercially, picture discs became a more extensive and established part of the industry’s promotional apparatus in the 1980s. In sum, early retailing strategies and recordings aimed to create and serve record collectors, with industry practices reinforcing the notion of collecting as a selective process, especially in the classical repertoire. Sites of appreciation Record appreciation societies were similarly important for fostering collecting as a selective activity, involving the acquisition of discrimination, discernment and cultural capital. Initially, this was especially the case in relation to classical music and, in particular, opera singers. Later, jazz, while originally a populist genre (the Jazz Age of the 1920s), proved increasingly attractive to those looking to explore a more musically complex style of popular music. A key example of this process was the U.K. Gramophone Society. A number of local groups came together in 1923 to form a national association, linked to a new publication, The Gramophone, edited by Compton McKenzie. A 1933 survey of the Society showed it to have 33 member societies, with approximately 1,500 members. Four had existed prior to 1914, but most had formed during the previous few years. Initially there was an emphasis on the intricacies of sound reproduction and its technologies, but later there was a marked shift towards musical appreciation: ‘The new societies are generally small groups of intelligent music lovers … it is the aim of nearly every society to effect an interchange of ideas on nearly every type of music, thus promoting an all-round appreciation of the musical art.’ In the United States, the hot jazz clubs and jazz societies of the 1930s (Lopez, 2002) played a similar role for their sub-genre, as did those in the United Kingdom (Parsonage, 2005). In Japan, the initial development of record collecting emphasized ‘the appropriation of foreign music’. Listening clubs, established around 1915–16, and guides to Western classical music, which first appeared in the 1920s, guided the early collectors ‘toward the Western sensibility; the [musical] connoisseurship was thus “borrowed” and authenticated’ (Hosokawa and Matsuoka, 2004: 151, 153). The Gramophone, 1936, 14 (158): 86.\n\nThe 78 era\n\n23\n\nSites of acquisition Where collectors acquired recordings depended to an extent on what styles of music were being collected, and the initial appearance of these. Reflecting its early dominance of recordings, the classical repertoire, especially its vocalists, was the first genre to have been systematically collected. Jazz collecting became prominent in the 1930s, with some emergent interest in early blues. However, most early American popular music remained a neglected form through the 1930s, with very few collectors and extremely limited resources to facilitate their efforts. So, where did the early record collectors obtain their recordings? Two main sites were utilized: conventional retail, including mail order, and a variety of secondhand sources. Sheet music retailers quickly moved into selling recorded music, and mail order was available from the late 1890s. Record company catalogues, and the adverts in early issues of The Gramophone and the jazz-oriented Melody Maker (1926 on) provide evidence of both. In the case of the classical repertoire, retail and mail order were the main sources for additions to the collection. Given the relatively easy availability of classical recordings, and their largely middleclass consumers, the culture of classical collecting did not need to associate with the ‘down market’ practice of scavenging through thrift stores and such like. Recordings in the popular repertoire were also available through retail music shops, but their circulation was more restricted. Jazz and blues records had limited distribution and sales through the 1920s and much of the ’30s as most record stores were limited in the labels they sold. Collecting hot jazz records, therefore, … meant generally rummaging for jazz records in remainder bins at furniture shops, junkyards, or Salvation Army depots located mostly in black neighbourhoods. More committed collectors would roam black neighbourhoods door to door [referred to as canvassing], or take autos, buses, and trains to different parts of the country searching for jazz records. (Lopez, 2002: 160)\n\nJohn Hammond relates his regular search through New York stores for records, as a teenager in the early 1920s: I was paid $1 a week as my allowance, and for that I could take the bus down Fifth Avenue to 37th Street, spend an hour at the Widener store listening to new Columbia and Okeh releases on which most of the early Negro and country artists appeared. Then I spend half an hour at the Hardman-Peck store, where Brunswicks were sold, and finally I stopped for a couple of minutes at Landay’s Victor Records store. I could spend seventy-five cents, which would buy one ten-inch Columbia or Brunswick record, take the bus home, and have a dime for the rest of the week. (Hammond, 1977: 30)\n\nIn the United States, the buyers of many earlier blues and jazz records were almost exclusively poor blacks, and the few records sold generally were played on\n\n24\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\ninferior equipment, resulting in damage or destruction. Consequently, as Hilbert later observed in his guide to prices for such material: ‘There are many jazz and blues records that exist only in a handful of copies’ (Hilbert, 1998: Introduction). A few original collectors of popular genres bought off the shelf as the recordings were issued. Later, in the 1930s, used records could often be found by ‘junking’ or canvassing, searching a neighbourhood house by house, asking occupants if they had any old records (often holding up a 78 to make clear what sort of records were sought). This practice continued into the 1950s, although there were decreasing returns by the 1960s, as the sources and numbers of surviving recordings dried up and became fully exploited. There developed among collectors of early American/old time music a major emphasis on this hunt aspect of collecting, with frequent tales of canvassing, trawling for material and finds of rare recordings. Jerry Wexler recalls: ‘We were record collectors, fierce and indefatigable. To discover, in the back of some basement in far Rockaway, a carton of unopened, still-in-original wrappers sets of Black Swan – a label owned by W. C. Handy and responsible for Ethel Waters first recordings – was an experience second only to orgasm’ (cited in Lopez, 2002: 261) – and one gets the impression that some collectors gave their collections the higher priority! Richard Nevins recalls how rare records like Champion 16,000s could usually only be found by canvassing, knocking on doors in rural southern locales where old blues country records had originally been predominately sold: Many of the great collectors in the eastern U.S. were put together with a great deal of canvassing back in the 1950s and 60s when 78s were still in the same houses in which they had been purchased in the 1920s and 30s. The folks who had bought them originally still had them, but stored them away after LPs and 45s became the current formats. We used to knock on doors and ask folks if they had any old records that they didn’t play anymore and would consider selling. Just about any house in the South in which people over 60 lived still had records from 40 to 50 years ago, and most were happy to sell the old unplayed discs. (Nevins, 2006)\n\nThrough the 1930s, hot jazz clubs ran swap meets, and some began to run auctions. By the early 1940s there were jazz record stores, which usually had a bin or two of used records in addition to new stock. But the wider hunt aspect remained vital, as Harriet Hershe (in 1940) shows in her lament on life married to a hot jazz collector: He collects every available record in every available spare moment … he can make the necessary excursions to the darkest part of the city and countryside, Jerry Wexler, 1917–2008, went on to have a high-profile and very successful career in the music industry, primarily as a producer for Atlantic from 1954 to 1979.\n\nThe 78 era\n\n25\n\ncanvass the basements of second-hand stores, and Salvation Army outlets … He goes about with a haggard, hazy look, a copy of Downbeat in one hand, and a record catalogue in the other. (Lopez, 2002: 159)\n\nSites of mediation: the music press The experience of Harriet Hershe’s husband, with its reference to Downbeat, hints at the importance of the music press to the avid record collector. We now tend to take for granted an extensive literature serving record collectors, including general guidebooks, discographies, critics ‘best of’ and consumer record guides, and collector-oriented magazines. Together these are involved in creating and maintaining a set of collecting practices and conventional wisdom, especially notions of the canon – what is/should be collectable (see Chapter 4). Early collectors had far less available to help them, and often produced the forerunners of today’s plethora of publications. Here I refer briefly to several of these early efforts, and the manner in which they consolidated a number of central themes in collecting. Publications on recordings of classical music strongly emphasized discrimination, almost entirely predicated on aesthetic criteria, although with some reference to condition. This is particularly evident in the editorial columns and other contributions in The Gramophone (UK, 1923), where collecting becomes part of cultural capital and upward social mobility. It has justifiably been viewed as ‘the first magazine in any language to treat recorded music as seriously as the great British literary reviews examined the written word’ (LeMahieu, 1988: 172). After selling an impressive 500 copies a month in its first year, by the late 1920s its sales had reached 12,000 per issue. Its own survey of readers (in 1931) showed them to be largely a broad cross-section of the professional middle classes. The Gramophone reviewed new releases, disseminated information on technical developments in sound reproduction, and encouraged record companies to produce and the public to buy ‘serious music’, a label essentially equated with the classical canon. Several early collector guides offered additional advice and information to the classical collector. EMG Hand Made Gramophones Ltd published a series on ‘The Art of Record Buying’ (available free prior to the Second World War; the last appeared in 1940). Johnson refers to it as ‘Probably one of the first selected record catalogues to be issued, and one of the best’ (Johnson, 1954). More significant was Morton Moses’ The Record Collector’s Guide: American Celebrity Discs, first published in 1936 as a 44-page pamphlet. The first edition was followed by a fuller version in 1949, in which Moses observed that ‘the interest in collectors’ recordings has increased tremendously’ since his earlier guide. The period covered by Moses (in his 1949 edition) is between the release of the first Columbia celebrity discs in April 1903, and the issuance of the first complete Victor catalogue in January 1912: the era of acoustical recording. The catalogue is arranged alphabetically, by artist, from Bessie Abbot to Nicola Zerola. Moses\n\n26\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nstressed the educational role of his guidebook, and the esoteric nature of record collecting and the role of specialized knowledge was already evident. He observed that the would-be collector of rare records must learn to distinguish between five types of Victor labels: the early Monarch (10 inch) and De Luxe (12 inch) labels; the Grand Prize label, adopted 1 December 1905; the Patents label, adopted in 1908, with three variants to the endings of the patent numbers at the bottom of the label; the No-Patents label, adopted in 1914; and the Victrola label of subsequent single- and double-faced issues. Anyone with an interest in opera and its greatest stars should find this information valuable. To know how many records an artist made, what selections he sang, how old he was at the time, cannot be regarded as unimportant. To be stimulated by this knowledge to a further investigation of the achievements of some of the world’s most talented musicians would be an even greater compliment to the purposes of this book. (Moses, 1949 [1936]: Preface)\n\nMoses refers to the increasing scarcity and value of many of these recordings, especially where the master recordings were soon destroyed. The majority of Columbia records included in his book fell within this category. His guide has remained in print, and second-hand copies continue to fetch good prices, indicative of the continued interest in 78 collecting. Discrimination continued to be emphasized by the post-war guides; for instance, Blanks detailed overview of Western classical recordings is subtitled A Record Collector’s Guide to Music Appreciation (Blanks, 1968). In such views, ‘planning a record collection is more than a matter of personal taste … as well as being curtailed by economy, personal taste must also be limited by selectiveness’ (Gillies, 1966: 7). As Bryant (1962: 22) observed, guidelines were necessary given the vast selection of recordings already available. Accordingly, such guides provided guidance on ‘the best’ of the available recordings. Gillies sought to ‘deepen our awareness of the range of music offered on records’, in the process aiming to provide ‘a realistic selection from the music of every period’ (Gillies 1966: Introduction). As noted earlier, Semeonoff observes that the rapid expansion of collecting can be seen by comparing the ‘Exchange and Mart’ section of a current issue of The Gramophone with a pre-war issue. Not only are there an increased number of listings, but ‘prices have increased very considerably’ (Semeonoff, 1949: 2). However: ‘Music lovers do not know how to set about increasing the scope of their collections, nor what pitfalls are to be avoided. It is to the beginner that this book is addressed. No attempt has been made to cater for the specialist or the advanced collector’ (Semeonoff, 1949: Introduction). His chapters indicate the scope of such guides, dealing with the history of recording; formats (from the acoustical to the electrical age), with reference to the numbering systems used by the early recording companies; Good and Bad Recordings; Dating and Identification; the Condition of Records; Storage and Indexing; Gramophone Societies; Literature;\n\nThe 78 era\n\n27\n\nincluding periodicals, yearbooks, and company catalogues; Shops and Buying by Post. Later chapters cover Singers; Instrumentalists; Conductors and Orchestras; and Jazz (a chapter contributed by Alexander Ross). The hunt, and the chance of a ‘find’, is central to these accounts: ‘One never knows when something one has been looking for months or even years, is going to turn up. There is, too, the chance of finding records one did not know even existed’ (Semeonoff, 1949: 2). This was a possibility underpinned by the unsystematic operating practices of the early record companies, and made knowledge central to building the collection. Gillies suggests that having obtained a player and a few records, the novice collector’s ‘next step should be a subscription to a good record review’ (Gillies, 1966: Introduction). Following this advice himself, Blanks praises The Gramophone as a key source, referring to how he also went through all the back issues to become familiar with the available repertoire, and the recommended recordings contained in it (Blanks, 1968: 3). The early recording companies were frequently very unsystematic in their operating practices, especially in terms of tracking inventory and cataloguing releases. While some catalogues were produced, there was a general lack of these, especially from the smaller companies, along with a failure to keep thorough records of releases. There was also the ephemeral nature of much of this material, which was then rarely kept in libraries and archives. This lack of systematic and accessible information on releases made collecting a challenge, a detective-like activity adding to the thrill of the chase: the hunt for elusive or even unknown or unrecorded items. In so doing, it fostered discography as an important aspect of collecting. In 1934, the French critic Charles Delaunay was the first to publish a comprehensive discography, a word he coined. His Hot Discography was then published in English in 1936, while in 1935 the first such British compilation had been published: Rhythm on Record, by Hilton Schelman, assisted by Stanley Dance. These two books were ‘a basis for and inspiration to later works of similar character’ (Godbolt, 1984: 175). Through the later 1920s and through the 1930s, hundreds of discographies of early jazz and jazz-related recordings were produced by collector enthusiasts, often in home-produced magazines, sometimes in the pages of Britain’s jazz-oriented Melody Maker, Hot News and Swing Music. At times, heated arguments raged over attribution and provenance of particular artists and recordings, and the intricacies of various labels’ notation/cataloguing practices. This vernacular scholarship provided an essential resource for major compilations to come (see Godbolt, 1984; Lopez, 2002; Parsonage, 2005). Beyond the 78 era What I have termed the 78 era was over by 1960. The 78 as a format had been supplanted by vinyl by the end of the 1950s, and the gramophone replaced by new forms of sound reproduction. But the passing of the 78 recording did not end\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\n28\n\ninterest in the era and its music. The recordings and the equipment used to play them have remained highly collectable. A number of those who had begun their collecting during the 1940s and 1950s continued to do so, and were joined by younger collectors attracted by the 78s’ associations with authenticity and romance. Indeed, since the 1960s, there has been a proliferation of interest in gramophone culture, with a considerable amount of scholarship devoted to documenting its music and the associated technologies. A good deal of this research has been undertaken by collectors. Who and why Contemporary collectors of 78s display similar practices and behaviours as their earlier counterparts: a mix of a love of pre-1950 musical styles, completism and a concern for authenticity, rarity and value. The collectors of 78 recordings in the 1960s and 1970s were an older group. Many such collectors had grown up through the era of 78s, and became collectors at an early age: for example, Joe Bussard, born in 1936, started collecting at age ten; and Sam Charters, born in 1929, began buying old recordings by American blues musicians in his teens. In 1985, when Corenthal interviewed and recorded the recollections of six major collectors of 78s, five were in their 60s. This aging constituency were now joined by younger collectors, attracted by the 78s’ associations with musical authenticity and the romance of a nostalgic past. Soderbergh (1983) cites a 1980 survey of US collectors of 78s which showed that 32 per cent were not old enough to remember the 78 era, so they were presumably born around 1945–50. Some were collecting the CD and vinyl reissues of the 78 era, as well as the original recordings. Former rock musician Jeff Healey, with his band The Jazz Wizards, drew on Healey’s lifelong love of 1920s jazz and his extensive collection for a new album of old standards: Among Friends (2002). Healy states why he was attracted to the project: ‘It’s a classic time period in American songwriting … I’ve always actively acquired records from the ’20s and ’30s. I now sit here with 25,000 78s and 4,000 CDs of material issues from that period, so there’s a fair amount of material to choose from.’ To play 78s, you need equipment that is much less commonly available now. To a degree, this presents a barrier to accessing the music the fragile shellac recordings contain, but it also forms part of their appeal: the ritual aspect of handling and playing them on gramophones (similar to the appeal of vinyl and turntables to collectors of vinyl recordings). There is also, to varying extent, an associated ‘rejection’ of the present era and its music: Corenthal refers to ‘how misguided efforts [record price guides, which largely ignore pre-1950 music and 78s] can so monopolize and homogenize younger generations that they virtually eliminate competition of musical forms’, replacing this with a preoccupation with Eye Music, Toronto, 20 June 2002: 27. Healey died in 2008.\n\nThe 78 era\n\n29\n\n‘sexuality, drugs and noise distortion’ (Corenthal, 1986: 19). Joe Bussard profiler Dean recounts how … a jeep packed with teenagers swings past the window, blaring bass-heavy rap that resonates for blocks around. ‘Listen to that shit’, hisses Bussard. ‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’ He begins to rail against the contemporary world anew, once again comparing it with the ’20s, the zenith of Western civilization. He rhapsodizes about this lost age and its enduring artistry. (Dean, 2001)\n\nAs with the earlier collectors, cultural preservation and enjoyment of the music of the gramophone era are central themes. Many contemporary 78 collectors are involved in radio programmes, reissue-oriented recording companies, and historical research, especially the production of discographies. The editors of an extensive early bibliography noted how: On the research level, many full or part-time hobbyists have turned to constructing biographies, discographies, and comprehensive articles on the many available subjects which the era includes. Others are experimenting to re-record the finer material of the era on modern tape equipment for the dual purpose of reissue in LP form and preservation of what is now recognized as a dynamic part of the oral, social, historical, and musical heritage of America. (Betz and Betz, 1966)\n\nA few brief examples of such contributions must stand here for a wider body of such work. Dr John Grams, a collector of jazz recordings and a radio broadcaster, through the 1960s and ’70s ran a five-hour radio show every Saturday evening, offering jazz appreciation for a new generation of collectors. He also prepared a series of short radio spots for public radio, chronologically highlighting developments in jazz history, and taught jazz courses at Marquette University (Corenthal, 1986). From 1956 to 1970, Joe Bussard ran the last 78 record label Fonotone, dedicated to releasing new recordings of old time music – in 2005, a five-CD anthology of Fonotone releases was issued by Dust-to-Digital. Bussard gladly shares his collection; he has long taped recordings for a nominal sum, and undertaken a number of radio programmes; recently he established his own website and he is also on MySpace. Walter Welsh was for many years a collector of early acoustical phonographs, records and related memorabilia. While a professor at Syracuse University, he invented and patented a system for reproducing acoustical recordings, co-wrote a key study of the early development of sound recording (Welsh and Burt, 1994) and developed the Syracuse Archive. Allen Koenigsberg, drawing on his own collection, and with the input of other collectors, produced a detailed history of the development of Edison cylinders (1988), and edited The Antique Phonograph Monthly (APM Press, Brooklyn, 1972–), a scholarly publication providing a forum for those interested in the 78 era. Finally,\n\n30\n\nWax Trash and Vinyl Treasures\n\nRichard Nevins drew on his own collection and borrowed recordings from others to compile a collection of rare 78s: This 2 CD set is comprised of super rarities and unissued gems that would cause even the most advanced collectors to sit up and take notice – one might consider many of the tracks to be as revelatory in their domain as the Dead Sea Scrolls were in theirs. Indeed, a number of selections will be heard here for the very first time as no existing copies have been found before, while many others that survive only one known copy have lain hidden away out of common access. Some of the unissued test pressings used here have been sparsely heard before, but only in very poor sound quality that failed to impart their power and eloquence. Show a collector of old 78 records items like the Son House and Georgia Potlickers one-of-a-kind rarities that appear here and he’ll tell you items like that are ‘the stuff that dreams are made of.’ (Nevins, 2006)\n\nThe tradition of the record collector as an archivist and cultural preserver has been an ongoing and influential one. What is collected: rarity and value Early cylinders are now extremely rare, and acoustical disc recordings prior to 1925 are also scarce. So too are early gramophones. Increased interest in pre1950s recordings generally, combined with the relative scarcity of particular genres, artists and labels, meant that the rarer recordings had become economic investments by the 1980s. Soderbergh observed, … the 78s that bring the stiffest prices are seldom the garden variety records such as you and I possess. If I were to characterize the most prized 78s on the current market, it would be a disc featuring black artists released on an uncommon label, recorded between 1920–1934, that did not sell a million copies, and was jazz or jazz-inflected (rather than of the pop swing persuasion). (Soderbergh, 1983: 11)\n\nWriting in 1988, Hilbert noted that each year more of the fragile and easily-broken 78s are destroyed or lost: ‘the supply dwindles, the demand sizzles and prices soar.’ (Hilbert, 1988: Introduction). He was referring to jazz and blues 78s, but his comment was more generally applicable. Critical of the ‘pricing books flooding the market’ in the early 1980s, with their emphasis on ‘eccentric oddities’, Corenthal (1986: 18–20) offered his own selection of a dozen rare recordings from the 78 era. Drawing on various published guides, Soderbergh listed 132 records now priced at $50 or more in contemporary guides. He was astonished to find ‘so many records with such lofty price tags’. ‘Had I lowered that figure to $10, there would be at least 500 items on the list.’ He emphasized that top prices held only for a record that’s condition is ‘clearly excellent’ (Soderbergh, 1983).\n\nThe 78 era\n\n31\n\nMore recently, the advertising in collector magazines such as Discoveries and Goldmine, and the bidding wars on sites such as eBay, illustrate how many items are now beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest collectors. The market for blues 78s by artists such as Robert Johnson continues to be strong: in 2007 a copy of his ‘Preaching Blues’ sold for £3,332 on eBay, despite its B-side ‘Love in Vain’ being graded at E (Record Collector, 344, Christmas 2007). Rock’n’roll 78s have become one of the hottest commodities in the record-collecting world. ‘In general, the rarest rock 78s are the most obscure issues on the best-loved labels – early Sun, Chess, and Vee-Jay releases, for example. The most expensive, on the other hand, tend to be those by the best-known artists’ (Thompson, 2002: 101), as with the Everly Brothers 78s released in the British market, but not released in the United States. Sites of acquisition Although there are still finds to be made, the days of ‘junking’ are now largely over. Accordingly, record dealers have become more important as a source of recordings for collectors. The first national directory of collectable-record dealers, published in 1980, could already include over 250 dealers in over 40 American states (Felton, 1980). Collectors’ magazines such as Goldmine, Discoveries [now defunct] and the UK-based Record Collector include extensive dealer advertising, usually listing records for auction or set sale (at fixed prices), so also collectors’ (and dealers’) ‘wants lists’. Only a small proportion of this is for 78s, but they remain an important niche market. Record fairs and conventions, some now very large in scale, still include dealers specializing in 78s, as do some auction houses. The internet has added a new locale for these activities (see Chapter 5).
