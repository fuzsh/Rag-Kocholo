        "text": "Blessings\n\nIt's always a pleasure to work with EQUIP and listen to Kevin's music. As one of my favorite artists this week was truly a great experience for me to help tell his story and the creation of this album. This is without a doubt one of the best albums to be released this year and it means the world to be able to share a part of it with all of you!\n\nIn other news, If you saw at the top of the homepage, I just launched a Patreon for the site. This is something that I ruminate quite a bit about, and felt like it was the next logical step in this site's longevity. I've been at this for almost a year, and it has honestly changed my life. If you want to help support me in this next chapter of new content creation, feel free to head over to the Patreon page I set up and start this new journey with me!\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/VGMWAX\n\nDefense Curl\n\nHey everyone, hope you are all doing well. This past week has been pretty crazy in the VGM WAX world. I'm currently in the middle of moving so the pictures for this week feature a different background and surface entirely. Apologies for those expecting that classic VGM WAX style. Hopefully, I was still able to give the release some justice with my shots. I don't think it turned out half bad at all. Keep your needles in the groove because I have a killer review and interview coming up later this month that you do not want to miss! Much love to you all!\n\nＶＡＰＯＲＷＡＶＥ\n\nTwo R23X releases in the span of a month? This truly is a blessed timeline we've found ourselves in isn't it? I feel absolutely privileged to be able to take a look at this release along with SOUND_TRACK ~ [MP3].torrent in such short proximity to each other. As I've stated before, R23X is the artist that got me into vaporwave in the first place and is one of the best artists in the industry. Feel free to check out my previous interview with Marc and read about all of the awesome magic that went into making both of these releases a reality in my review for SOUND_TRACK ~ [MP3].torrent. Thanks for reading!\n\nHard Times\n\nThis week has been pretty rough for me. My brother has been in the hospital since last Thursday with liver problems since his surgery three weeks ago, so things have been pretty hectic here in the VGM WAX space. If you ever feel overwhelmed or alone just remember that you're not. Things will get better and you can overcome anything you set your heart and mind to. If you ever need someone to talk with or reach out to feel free to drop a line on social media, or via email. I'd love to chat! Keep breathing, and move on from one day to the next until you've come out the other side a better person. Much love!\n\nShadowrunner\n\nIt’s always a pleasure to look at one of Black Screen Records’ releases. As the first label ever featured here on the site, they definitely hold a special place in my heart. Each release has so much love poured into it; they are definitely one of the premiere labels in the industry in my opinion. As a massive fan of Jon’s work it’s always a fun day when I get to spend some quality time pouring over one of his albums. His work on Shadowrun is just paramount. Get your jacks ready because it’s time to plug in!\n\nFloat On\n\nThis game was a special thing to experience and was even more special to experience the music on vinyl. This is seriously one of the best mobile games I have ever played, and it’s music and story is something that has stuck with me ever since I finished it. Kevin Penkin has always been one of my favorite artists since his Defender’s Quest release, and this album is no exception to his stellar work. I highly recommend you check this one out!\n\nWelcome Back!\n\nWhen I started this project back in September of last year, I had no idea that I would ever get the opportunity to share stories like the one from this week. When I began writing my reviews for VGM WAX, my idea was to make short little ramblings of releases that would hopefully help people make an informed decision on what to add to their collections next. I feel so fortunate to be able to share the love and passion that creators have for their work with all of you. I hope it helps you like it does me to gain an even greater appreciation for the music we all love so much that we want to cherish it forever on vinyl.\n\nAsk A Ninja!\n\nWhen iam8bit announced this soundtrack, I was completely blown away considering my friend was telling me to check out this game and it's soundtrack a week prior to this vinyl's announcement. Getting to experience the game and it's soundtrack in such a coincidental way just added to the enjoyment I had with this record. This is seriously one of the most unique soundtrack experiences I think I have ever witnessed. The amount of work and time that went into crafting these two unique experiences will completely blow any chiptune fan away.\n\nIt was an extreme pleasure to pick Rainbowdragoneyes’ brain about his work on this soundtrack. Please consider helping to support his move. Check out the sale on his Bandcamp and merch pages. Use the code FEEDME to get 50% off your order until the end of June, and help Mr. Rainbowdragoneyes relocate to a brand new home! Hope you enjoy the interview!\n\nHappy Pride Month!\n\nBig love to all of you out there who have struggled to feel a part of the world we have all found ourselves in. I hope you all continue to grow, flourish, and become the best version of yourself that you want to be. Thank you so much for your support and for reading my content, it means more than you could ever know. Keep spreading the love!\n\n❤️ Happy Anniversary! ❤️\n\nTomorrow on May 30th will be 10 years since I let the love of my life and best friend into my life. My fiancée is seriously the best person in my life and I would be nowhere near the person I am today without her support and help through this past decade. I am so blessed to have such a wonderful person in my life to continue pushing me into being the best version of myself that I can be. Her continued support of VGM WAX since I started this project has been one of my favorite journeys with her over the past year. Whether it's by helping pick releases to cover or edit the words that you all read every week, I owe her everything in helping me make this platform the best it can be each week. Thank you so much Michelle for all you do for VGM WAX and for me. I love you with all my heart. Here's to another ten years!\n\nPew! Pew!\n\nThis soundtrack was such a pleasure to listen to. I had never heard of this game or it's music before it was announced by Data Discs. Shoot 'Em UPS have never been anything I was very skilled at, but after seeing the remake on Nintendo Switch I had to take the deep dive into what I heard was one of the genres greatest. I have to say, this game and its music is truly exquisite in every sense of the word. If you have not checked this album or the game it comes from, I highly recommend you do so -- you won't regret it!\n\nT-Shirts\n\nI have limited stock left of VGM WAX shirts from my initial run last year. I made these mainly for friends and family and to send out to the winners of the VGM WAX Awards 2018. If you are interested in acquiring one of these limited shirts hit me up on my social media pages or via email at jacob@vgmwax.com I will even throw in a random VGM WAX sticker with your order!\n\nThanks so much for your support!\n\nR.I.P.\n\nThis has kind of been a stressful week for me. The computer I used to build this site and start the VGM WAX project kicked the bucket after eight long years. This same computer got me through my entire college career and has carried me through many video game stories over the years. I am sad to see it go, but thankfully all of the data I had on it is safe and secure. If anyone has any leads on a good PC or any advice on a good one to buy or build, hit me up. I am definitely in the market!\n\nChillin’ Out!\n\nAnother Materia Collective release, another Zelda album. It seems to be a super popular thing to cover in the video game music scene. I can’t really complain -- Zelda has ingrained itself as being a cornerstone franchise, and the work Koji Kondo and Nintendo has achieved is nothing short of amazing. I know some people might be getting tired of how saturated the Zelda arrangement scene has gotten, but for me, the albums are so unique in their own way and a pleasure to listen to. I wouldn’t be hurt to see some other classic game series’ get the same love as Zelda. The more music the better in my opinion. Definitely can’t wait to see what’s next from Mikel!\n\nHibernation\n\nMan, what a wild week this has been. This has been one of the most in-depth articles I think I have worked on yet here at VGM WAX. I am so happy that I got to talk with James about his inspirations, memories, and experiences while working on Rain World. I am completely and truly grateful to be able to share all of this with you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did putting it all together. Thanks James & Kevin for making this a truly special VGM WAX moment for me to share with the world.\n\nIn Bloom\n\nThis was one that I was pretty excited to cover. I never played this game until I owned a Playstation 4, and boy did I miss out as an Xbox 360 owner. This game and its music is such an experience, one that I think everyone should expose themselves to. I don't think I had ever been enamored by such a pure and simple video game experience before! It completely blew me away.\n\nStay tuned next week for when Spring really opens up. Rain has always been one of my favorite things in this World…\n\nRetrospective\n\nReturning to Rozen’s work after a long hiatus was a fun and exhilarating experience. His Ballads of Hyrule was the second release I covered when I started my website, and was one of my favorite releases from last year. It is wild to look back at this site when it was in its infancy! This sort of feels like a capstone in a way. I have grown a lot from then and continue to write more and fill into this job I love. I certainly can’t wait to see where I will be when I review another Rozen release. I’m sure things will be even better than they are now as this industry continues to grow and flourish. Thank you so much for reading!\n\nDeploying the Ultramarines\n\nThis album is definitely one of those that I didn’t expect to ever get released on vinyl. The memories I have playing the multiplayer for this game are ones that I will cherish forever. This game is seriously one of the most underrated games in the entire series and has some great music. If you haven’t checked this game out, I highly recommend it. You can more than likely find it pretty cheap, and if you can find a group to play the multiplayer with I guarantee you will have a great time!\n\nWizorb!\n\nThis soundtrack was an absolute blast to cover. I remember picking this game up as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 6. This was when I was first exposed to the game and it’s soundtrack as it was included with the bundle price. Man, what an experience it was to get such a hidden gem amongst all the other legendary indie games at the time! The thing that stood out to me most about this game was the soundtrack and just how intoxicating it was. I hope you all enjoy the review, and most of all enjoy the music!\n\n“No way to get back up! Now what am I going to do?”\n\nWelcome back for another review. This week was a fun one! I absolutely love Secret of Mana and it's soundtrack is something that I have always regarded as one of my favorite from the 16bit era. This recreation of all those classic tunes I remember and love was a fun trip down memory lane. I have recently been playing the remaster on the Playstation 4, and I have to say it is a blast to revisit. I really hope this version gets released on the Switch, or we possibly see a port of the Seiken Densetsu Collection over here in the West. Hit me up on social media and let me know what some of your favorite classic games are! I’ll see you all on the next one.\n\nHi!\n\nWelcome back for another review. This album is really great and honestly one that flew completely under my radar when it came out. If you have not checked this one out, I highly recommend you do. Give the review a read and the album a listen, you won't be disappointed I assure you!\n\nI have some crazy things in the works, so keep yourself locked into that groove. If you haven't already, sign up for the First Pressing List so you can stay up to date on a few things coming in the future!\n\nWelcome Back!\n\nThank you all for coming back again this week as I take a deeper look into the soundtracks that fill out my collection. I’m still working on some of the backend on the site and hopefully making it easier for you all to browse around and explore the fantastic people who make all of the releases I cover possible. I’ll see you all next week!\n\nUpdate!\n\nI have been pouring over a ton of website revisions this past weekend. The reviews are now under a new section of the site labeled “reviews” instead of “blog.” I think this makes way more sense, and is more honest about what I am doing here with this project. A couple other pages on the site have seen some revisions, namely the “Artists” and “Record Label” pages. Artists are being updated to have their own pages on VGM WAX, where you can see all of their social media pages and where they have been featured on this site. The same goes for the record labels: they have been overhauled to have their own pages, and they will also start to feature articles from here on the site in their respective sections. I hope that some of these redesigns make the site more user friendly and help the usability for those who wish to explore. Thank you so much for your continued support -- I’ll see you all next week with another review!\n\nBlog Post #21 has arrived! Time to party!\n\nThanks for coming back another week to enjoy some awesome music with me. I really enjoyed my time with this one and I know you will too. FlybyNo is one of those composers that never really disappoints, and I am super happy to be able to listen to his stunning arrangements on vinyl! These are super limited, so don't hesitate to support G4F Records and treat yo’ self to a new record!\n\nYou're too sloooooow!\n\nI decided to change things up a bit and bring some fresh content to the weekly review format. I hope you all enjoy learning a little bit more about the man behind the music on this one. Please don’t hesitate in heading over to Saskrotch’s Bandcamp page and giving him a follow and listen to some great music while you’re there. There’s even a little “Adopt a 'Skrotch” button over there if you feel like supporting him to continue making awesome tunes! Saskrotch even has a Twitch channel if you would prefer to head over there and chat with him while he plays games. Please let me know how you all enjoyed the article this week and don’t forget to give me a follow over on social media!\n\nLight World\n\nWell here we are — another week, another WAX Wednesday. This was a really fun album to listen to. Whether you are a fan of the Zelda series or not, you owe it to yourself to give this album a listen. The love and dedication here towards Koji’s wonderful arrangements is quite admirable; a lot of love and respect went into this album!\n\nWill has given me a few Bandcamp codes to share with all of you, so keep your eyes here on the site and on my various social media pages in order to win a copy. Spread some love to Switched On SNES and give the album a listen today. You won’t regret it!\n\nThe Next Chapter\n\nI have chosen to step down from my full time job to pursue my dream full time — the biggest part of that dream is this website. Get prepped to see a lot more content in the next coming months as I continue to flesh out the remainder of the site. I look forward to seeing where this journey will take me, and I am so happy to be sharing it with each and every one of you who support me every week. Thank you for all that you do and continue striving to be the best version of yourself you can be. I know I will!\n\nConfession…\n\nI have got to say, Quantum Break was actually an enjoyable game to me. I remember back in the day when it came out and it received pretty polarizing reviews/reception, but the general consensus was that Remedy missed the mark with this one. Science fiction stories hold a special place in my heart and Quantum Break was just cheesy and B-Grade film-like enough for me to thoroughly enjoy it. I feel like if people where to take a look back at this game and give it a fair shake they’d see the potential and hard work that was put into this uniquely interactive game. With Petri’s score here that’s one less thing you’ll have to worry about not being up to snuff. Seriously the music is great!\n\nI’ll catch you all next week!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nHello and welcome back to your weekly dose of wax. I took a little break at the end of last year from regularly scheduled vinyl postings to bring you the VGM WAX Awards. I hope you had fun taking a look back at some of my favorite releases from last year. I know with the next one, I want to include many more categories and give out a ton of awards. There are just so many amazing people out there that didn’t get recognized, and I want to fill up the prize pool as much as possible.\n\nHappy New Year to you all - I hope 2019 is your best year yet. Make the best of everything given to you and strive to become the version of yourself that you want to be. Keep your needles balanced and adjust your anti-skate, because 2019 is going to be amazing!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nWell here we are: another week, another post. I really enjoy this soundtrack a lot and I was always super bummed that I missed out on this one the first time it was pressed. I am very happy that Invada Records re-pressed this incredible soundtrack!\n\nI hope you all have a great time this holiday season no matter what you are doing. Be in good company and listen to wonderful music. Share your love with those around you and spread it as far as you can. I will see you all next week!\n\nHoly Releases!\n\nThis past month has been insane for video game vinyl. I feel like every week since the beginning of November we have had a new soundtrack announcement. I am super excited for a lot of these new titles, as well as ones from earlier this year that are starting to get shipped out. It feels like I have had a consistent list of tracking numbers to handle, and all I can say is that I am excited. This year I feel has been absolutely crazy for this industry and I can’t even imagine what 2019 will bring!\n\nThe Game Awards\n\nTomorrow is The Game Awards, and today’s soundtrack is up for “Best Score/Music”. Be sure to head over to The Game Awards website and cast your votes for this years nominees. Music from Celeste will be performed live at the show, and it is sure to be a blast! Keep an eye on my social media for a chance to win a Bandcamp version of Celeste, provided by Lena herself, to listen to until your hearts content!\n\nThank you, Supergiant Games!\n\nThis was a truly surprising release for me, and I am so grateful that I was able to snag a copy of this re-press. Darren Korb has always been one of my favorite composers ever since experiencing Bastion with everyone back in 2011. His work has always stuck with me, and the work here on Transistor is, without question, incredible. I want to give a huge shoutout to everyone on the team for signing my copy and for providing extra Bandcamp codes for some of my lucky readers. Please keep an eye on my social media pages — Instagram, Twitter, & Facebook — for a chance to get a digital copy of this incredible soundtrack!\n\n🎂 Birthday! 🎈\n\nToday marks another revolution around the sun for me and a lot has happened this year that makes me feel very grateful to be doing what I love. This has been one of the best years of my life by far; my continued passion and drive pushes me into becoming the best version of myself for those I love, and the industry I care so deeply about.\n\nI thank each and every one of you who come and read my thoughts every week. It truly means the world and so much more to me. Thank you for your support and for all your love, I hope to spread as much of my own to you.\n\nLet’s continue this journey together and make the best of this ride we possibly can!\n\nHave a spooky one!\n\nAfter working almost 24 hours in two days at my job, it was wonderful to sit down and listen to some awesome music and share my thoughts and a fond memory with all of you! Take a moment to reminisce with me about a classic release, one that I’m sure we all hope gets a much needed re-press. Whether you are out with friends tonight or tucked into your homes playing games, I hope you have a wonderfully spooky evening!\n\nThis weekend I am going to spinning a bit of my collection at my favorite local spot, Club Geek! I want to spread the love of music as far and wide as I possibly can. I hope you all can join with me in supporting all these amazing artists that help make the games we play the best they possibly can be!\n\nWelcome back!\n\nThanks for coming back for another weekly dose of WAX! Covering Synthetic Core 88 was a real treat. This is truly one of my favorite releases to come out this year, and I am extremely excited to see what Equip comes up with next. I highly recommend you go through and listen to everything from Equip, Kevin Hein, and Subhumanizer. The talent on display from all of these libraries of music is extraordinary! Stay tuned next week for a spooky Halloween edition of WAX Wednesday!\n\nThank you!\n\nI hope everyone has had a wonderful week. I have got some exciting new vinyl on the way. I’ve been slowly trying to catch up on all the amazing releases over the past year or so. This year is not even over, and I feel like there has been more amazing releases this year than in the past. We are nearing the end of 2018, and it seems like there are many more surprise announcements to come. Keep an eye on my social media pages, and give a follow to all the amazing labels I have linked HERE.\n\nTake care, and I will see you all next week for another Blog Post!\n\nStay locked into the groove!\n\nA lot of exciting new content will be coming up soon. Thanks so much for continuing to come back week in and week out to follow my passion project. This is truly a delight for me to sit down each week and really focus on a particular release in my library. I hope that you all are having as much fun reading my thoughts as I am with sharing them. None of this could be possible without the incredible support of my family and friends, not to mention the insane work that record labels and artists have put into making this an industry worth supporting. There has been a lot of heartache surrounding bootlegs this week, and I just want to be upfront. I will not be featuring any release that does not directly support those who pour their heart and souls into making the things that enrich our lives so much a reality. Keep on pressing, much love to everyone!\n\nWelcome back!\n\nThanks for stopping by and checking out my website. There are tons of awesome upcoming releases, so keep an eye on my Twitter to see when I retweet announcements. Also, Blip Blop is literally one of the best resources out there for staying up to date on releases as soon as they are announced. I will be working more on the new releases part of my site in the future (there’s a lot of ‘em), but for right now those are the best resources out there!\n\nTake care, and I’ll catch you on the B-Side!\n\nYou are awesome!\n\nThanks for stopping by and checking out this weeks blog post. I have a lot that I am still working on getting up and running here on the site. Please feel free to check out my Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, where I post regularly and engage with the community. I’d love to see you over there, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you so much to everyone who has been so supportive of this journey; whether you are family, friends, or industry wax heads, please know that you are loved, and I appreciate all of you more than you know.\n\nCatch you on the next one!"
