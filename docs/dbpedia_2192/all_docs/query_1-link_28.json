        "text": "When the Hall of Presidents and First Ladies in Pennsylvania shut down in January, Rachel Maddow, Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart each bought a presidential wax figure. John Oliver bought five, spending $13,700 on the wax presidents.\n\nOn Sunday, Oliver revealed his team purchased the wax figures of Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, William Henry Harrison and Warren G. Harding. The Last Week Tonight host expressed his disappointment that there is no Harding biopic, despite Harding’s interesting life story.\n\n“The problem is, who would do it? It would have to be someone with way too much time on their hands, way too many resources and unfettered access to a life-sized replica of former president Warren G. Harding,” said Oliver. He then introduced a trailer for his own fake biopic about the late president.\n\nOliver wasn’t messing around with his casting either — he recruited four Oscar-nominated actors to take part in the trailer. Anna Kendrick, Laura Linney, James Cromwell, Michael McKean and Campbell Scott are all featured in the preview for the movie.\n\nLinney plays Harding’s devoted wife while Kendrick is Harding’s mistress. Harding’s wax figure gives Kendrick flowers and even has a love scene with the actress in bed.\n\nWax President Harding has difficulty standing up, but manages to drink cocktails and turn his back on the First Lady while they are in an argument.\n\nWatch below."
