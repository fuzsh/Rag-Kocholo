        "text": "Pink Floyd, recorded at Musikhalle Hamburg on Thursday, 25 February 1971\n\nSources 1: German original bootleg – M-502 copy – CBM release a. (Hamburger) – CBM reissue (Music Halle)\n\nThe “Arab Family” insert. Extremely rare double LP, part of the 2LP reissues that Contraband is known for. A copy sold for over $1000 in 2004. Only ever seen with red pirate labels. This release has many ”ancestors” that I will try to add one by one.\n\nMatrix: PF47094 A/D\n\nSide 1: Green is the Color/ Careful with that Axe, Eugene/ Cymbaline Side 2: Embryo/ Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun Side 3: A Saucerful of Secrets Side 4: Atom Heart Mother suite\n\nQuality rating: Good stereo on floydboots.com, where it says “A re-release of Hamburger from the same plates”, which is an “Excellent stereo” rated title.\n\nBelow: Rare alternate insert\n\nMatrix: PF-47094 A/D\n\nOther label variations:\n\nA copy of:\n\nMatrix / Runout: -M-502-1-\n\nMatrix / Runout: -M-50 2-2-\n\nMatrix / Runout: -M-502-3-\n\nMatrix / Runout: -M-502-4-\n\nGerman copy of original release. Much easier to locate than an original copy, so that “M-502” has been adopted as the name for the original 2 LP set.\n\nCan be recognized by: – Cover not laminated; front cover says “Pink Floyd” or “Pink Floyd Live”, lesser print & audio quality (distortion in louder passages); back cover may have track list using two different types of fonts.\n\nFirst up, the more common version:\n\nThis is the rarer version:\n\nUsed label variations – the yellow one is most common – missing is white with silver text:\n\n****\n\nThe mega-rare original:\n\n****\n\nMatrix: The numbers 1 to 4 on each side\n\nCan be recognized by: – Laminated cover; no writing on front or back; track listing on inside panels; thin paper quality.\n\nFound labels (some copies had none):\n\n****\n\nUS/UK TMoQ copies: 1. Embrwo\n\nThe story behind this release goes like this: In late 1972 a copy of “M-502” had found its way to Britain and a bootleg dealer/distributor, who would leave his mark on the insert of a UK produced version of the TMoQ Rolling Stones bootleg Beautiful Delilah : Freddy Stomper “The Marked Hand”. Freddy did not only want to sell albums made by others, he wanted to sell his own product.\n\nShown here: A UK “Freddie” pressing of a Rolling Stones title:\n\nHowever, finding a pressing plant that would accept a ‘vinyl for cash’ after hours job with no questions asked and information passed on proved basically impossible back then, so Freddy decided to use his contacts in California, have the records pressed there and imported without covers, so customs would not be tipped off right away.\n\nThe discs carried the 1 to 4 large number labels TMoQ were using at that time and came in green, blue and bright red. The cardboard used on these is significantly thinner than the common US plain white sleeves. Freddy also ordered his own title stamps and I believe that this title ended up with the misspelling as his handwriting on the stamp order form must have been less than perfect. A small pink insert was pasted onto the rear as shown above. On this insert, the double LP is called “Embryo”, showing that the misspelling had not been made on purpose.\n\nAll known copies were bought in the UK. Not many were made and many of them were confiscated by the British Phonographic Industry when Richard Branson’s Virgin Records store at 24 Oxford Street in London was raided for selling bootlegs in March of 1973.\n\n***\n\nNext up: “Wizardo Rekords” is born and learns the art of recycling.\n\n“Some interesting facts for you about this release. I personally had something to do with the original American vinyl release of this show (as 2 LPs: Take Linda Surfin’ and The Miracle Muffler). This show was originally released in Germany, and the CD cover art that comes with this torrent is copied from the original German release, which had a fold-out double-LP cover. It was pressed with high quality vinyl, and was an excellent product all around.\n\nAt the time a group of us were heavy bootleg collectors in Los Angeles. We met a distributor who often imported European bootlegs. He said he had some original metal stampers for an unknown Pink Floyd bootleg which he offered to sell us. He was evasive about where he’d gotten them. He had no idea which Pink Floyd show it was, only that it was Pink Floyd. As a diehard Floyd fan, I bought them.\n\nThe stampers were very heavy-duty. Whereas American-made stampers were fairly thin and could be bent in your hands, these German ones were solid stainless steel and weighed several pounds each [These might have been the Embrwo stampers, I am not sold that they were the German M-502 stampers, see the matrix comparison below proving this].\n\nThen we (I won’t disclose who the other people were) found a pressing plant in LA, Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, which specialized in, among other things, making reference copies of LPs (i.e. the very highest quality pressings) [from Mofi’s website: “In 1977, he founded the renowned audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.” Obviously, these bootlegs were made around 1972, early 1973 at the latest, so this person is mistaken]. They were not a known bootleg maker, which was one reason we chose them. Had we gone to pressing plants in west LA which were known for making bootlegs, it was likely our stampers would have been stolen or “broken” by the established bootleggers. This had happened to a friend of ours.\n\nWe decided to go all out and make the highest quality pressing, to distinguish our product from the lower-quality vinyl on the market (all that colored vinyl stuff looked nice, but didn’t stand up to wear). We paid a premium to use the highest quality vinyl that was used for reference discs [I doubt that MoFi used multicolored vinyl]. We told the pressing plant that it was our band. They were suspicious, and asked us what kind of music it was. We fudged it and made up some stories. Remember, we didn’t even know which concert this was, whether it was AHM or something earlier.\n\nWhen we showed up to pick up the discs, the managers took us aside in another room and said “Are you telling the truth that this is your band?” We confirmed that it was. Luckily these guys were obviously not into trippy psyched-out English bands, because they told us they’d all listened to the records to determine whether we were making bootlegs. None of them recognized the music! So we got away with it. This was around 1972. “Meddle” had recently come out, so it was pre-Dark Side and thus Pink Floyd was still somewhat lesser-known in America.\n\nOf course I figured out the setlists, but we still didn’t know the actual source of the show. We hadn’t put 2 and 2 together regarding the German bootleg. When we asked the guy who’d sold us the stampers, he said he thought the show was from London. So that’s what we put on the covers [only TLS says “London concert” (see below), MM mentions “Hamburg, Germany” – so does this mean that TLS came out first?]. A graphic artist friend of ours designed the covers. It was another bootlegger who pointed out to us a couple years later about our mistake. When we compared the matrix numbers, we knew he was right.\n\nAbove: The “folded over” insert part for Take Linda Surfin’ mentioning “London concert” in the line above the track listing\n\nAbove: Equivalent part of the insert flap for Miracle Muffler\n\nThus, Take Linda Surfin and The Miracle Muffler are from the identical stampers as the original European release. We later sold the stampers to another large-scale bootlegger. Wish I’d kept them as souvenirs.\n\nIt’s no wonder that the later CD remasters of these shows have no surface noise. The European pressings were good quality vinyl, while ours were the best quality available anywhere. Even after dozens of playings, it was rare to hear a pop on our versions. [I do not believe that these US versions sound better than the original German 1, 2, 3, 4 version. floydboots.com does not even rate them on the same level as “M-502” ]\n\nAs an aside, we put huge effort through our connections throughout the bootleg community around the world to find the maker of the German original, mainly because we wanted to find out if he had any other tapes. We couldn’t trace him. As far as I know, no one has ever discovered the original source tapes of this show.\n\nI sold my entire bootleg vinyl collection years ago, and forgot to keep even a single copy of the original Take Linda Surfin and Miracle Muffler. So it’s cool, and nostalgic, to hear this again. Still my favorite Pink Floyd boot of all time.” [post made on a torrent site for live recordings]\n\nMatrix comparison of side 3 of the double sets / side 1 on TLS:\n\nOriginal “open legs” 2 LP: ‘3’\n\nM-502 copy: -M-502-3-\n\nEmbrwo: PF RECORD – 3\n\nTake Linda Surfin’: PF RECORD – 3\n\nPrinted labels that look hand drawn, a specialty Wizardo would retain for their ‘dog & cat’ and ‘Old Glory’ labels.\n\n*** I have been informed that this ‘purple insert’ version is actually a forgery/copy from the 1980’s (the one with the blue insert below is real). Oh my, counterfeit bootlegs… ***\n\nHas any LP ever resembled a pizza more (in this case “Hawaii”)?\n\nHot Wacks wrote: “First pressing consisted of only 300 copies. Second on black only. Third & fourth on CV.” So, what color was the first pressing?\n\nWizardo’s album title inspiration.\n\n****\n\n****\n\nThe “Atom Heart Mother” Tour started in the summer of 1970 with festival appearances in Europe (Kralingen and Aachen), before starting the tour proper in North America in late September. Beginning of November saw the band start the European leg of their tour with gigs in Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, France and the UK.\n\nPink Floyd had already played to 4,000 at the barn-like Ernst-Merck Halle on 14 November ’70, nevertheless another return to the city by the North Sea was booked for 25 February, during leg two of the Europe tour. First planned for the Hamburger Staatsoper but had to be moved to the Musikhalle “proven ground for pop shows” as the equipment set up time could not be guaranteed at the opera house. Tickets were rather expensive as the band reportedly asked for a fee “close to DM 50,000”. A local concert promoter was quoted as stating rather bluntly “I don’t understand why this has to be so idiotically expensive”.\n\nTicket for next day’s show in Offenbach, note the price difference.\n\nWhen John Lennon stepped on stage at Madison Square Garden for the matinee performance on August 30th 1972, there was no shortage of recording devices capturing this historical event. Multitrack tapes archived both shows, as well as several film cameras and amateur equipment in the audience. Despite all of this, several of the vinyl bootlegs reviewed here are still required to help us reconstruct both shows.\n\nThe last 3 images were taken by John Skelson\n\nThe set list was:\n\n01. Power To The People intro / New York City\n\n02. It’s So Hard\n\n03. Move on Fast [# 5 in evening show]\n\n04. Woman Is The Nigger Of The World\n\n05. Sisters, O Sisters [# 3 in evening show]\n\n06. Well, Well, Well\n\n07. Born In A Prison [# 10 in evening show]\n\n08. Instant Karma [# 7 in evening show]\n\n09. Mother [# 8 in evening show]\n\n10. We’re All Water [# 9 in evening show]\n\n11. Come Together\n\n12. Imagine\n\n13. Open Your Box\n\n14. Cold Turkey\n\n15. Hound Dog\n\n16. Don’t Worry Kyoko [only performed at the matinee concert]\n\n17. Give Peace A Chance [only performed at the evening concert]\n\nAlthough a website states that “The evening show featured fewer songs, with several sung by Yoko Ono omitted.”, the analysis based on the audience recordings shows that “Don’t Worry Kyoko” was the only Yoko song cut from the evening show.\n\nThe audience recording of the matinee show remained unreleased until Contraband released it on Hound Dog (5040) several years after the event.\n\nThe professional audio and video recording of 8 songs from the evening show (05., 08., 09., 11.- 15.) was broadcast in the U.S. on December 14th as part of an ABC TV “In Concert” special, with the soundtrack being in mono.\n\nAn FM simulcast was broadcast in many cities as well and from 1973 the King Biscuit Flower Hour live radio show produced a five song edit of highlights (09.+ 10. – 12. + 17.) from the evening performance, which was played on radio stations via a transcription LP (with Yoko’s song usually not being aired subsequent to its initial airing in 1972). This can be found on the wolfgangsvault website in complete form:\n\nhttp://www.wolfgangsvault.com/john-lennon/concerts/madison-square-garden-august-30-1972.html\n\n“Compared to the afternoon show, John seems more comfortable here and the band performances are stronger. One may wonder why the afternoon performances were favored for the officially released CD, when these may indeed be superior performances.” [wolfgangsvault.com]\n\n“The most recent issuance of One To One material was the inclusion of three tracks and Geraldo Rivera’s introduction from the evening on Anthology. Although the performances are considered to be superior to those of the matinee, they were considered unusable at the time of Live In New York City’s release du to unacceptable noise levels. Advances in digital restoration software allowed their inclusion on Anthology.” [Madinger & Easter, p. 80]\n\nIn the vinyl age, the TKRWM bootleg Joshua Tree Tapes probably had the best sounding (incomplete) version of the KBFH broadcast.\n\n***\n\nThis 1973 Contraband LP was the first bootleg LP from the event:\n\nMatrix #: WEC RI-3949-AX / WEC RI-3665-A\n\nSide 1: Mother / We’re All Water (not listed) / Imagine / Come Together/ Give Peace A Chance\n\nThe source was the very first KBFH broadcast, as this is the only bootleg LP to include “We’re All Water”. The quality only achieved a “Poor stereo” rating in Hot Wacks but a Japanese bootleg blog gave it a “relatively good mono” unless something got lost in translation.\n\nSide 2 presents John & Yoko’s entire performance in Ann Arbor on December 10/11 1971 as part of the “John Sinclair Freedom Rally”: John Sinclair/Attica State/Oh Sisters/Luck Of The Irish “The video feed, capture by Detroit television station WTVS (channel 56) was bootlegged in lo-fi on CBM’s Lennon-McCartney [which was a reissue of the side 2 master of this album as side 1] (the three John tracks were lifted from the CBM disc for release on Wizardo’s One – One Concert + More). ” [Eight Arms To Hold You, page 67]\n\nOnstage at the Chrysler Arena in Ann Arbor\n\nHere’s something new, dating a release by the cover image used. The John & Yoko image was taken in March of 1973, when they were on a house hunting trip to Greenwich, CT (more images are in Bob Gruen’s photo book John Lennon – The New York Years). This means that this LP was probably released in the second half of 1973 at the earliest.\n\n***\n\nIn 1975, Wizardo issued their own version of the show as their very first release but taken from an ABC TV “In Concert” video sound track:\n\nDoes not look like a fake to me but what is it – an advance pressing?\n\nThe text at the bottom reads: CONCEPT & DESIGN: MAUD’S HOUSE ART DIRECTION: MAD JACK ILLUSTRATION: JOAN KING 5.1.75 ♂\n\nThe last three songs on side two are studio recordings. The Wizardo LP makes the core list for the ABC broadcast versions of ‘Imagine’ and ‘Give Peace A Chance’.\n\nThe same Japanese blog hands the victory clearly to Wizardo on this one (“SIDE-A is overwhelming victory of 301. …very good to excellent,… For ONE TO ONE confrontation is 301 wins overwhelmingly. “), which is also reflected in the Hot Wacks ratings difference, giving this LP a very good mono.\n\n***\n\nInstant Analysis label, released in spring of 1974 – Matrix: JL 5040A / B\n\nThe infamous vinyl bootleg that was destroyed in Hot Wacks’ description: “Very poor. Worst bootleg ever!”.\n\nHot Wacks lists “Cold Turkey” before “Hound Dog” and this is the order in which they had been performed. This LP was the first time any of the audience recordings were released. It featured three songs from the matinee show, and three of them are still part of the core collection to this day: “Move On Fast” can only be found on this album, as it has never been released in any form and a video of that performance was only broadcast once, on UK’s BBC 2’s The Old Grey Whistle Test on 30 January 1973 [source: The Solo Beatles Film & TV Chronicle 1971-1980].\n\nTwo others, “It’s So Hard” and “Woman Is The Nigger Of The World” are also necessary from this LP to get the full audience mix from the matinee performance (the rest are found on the Japanese CD release mentioned below).\n\n“The complete matinee performance circulates among collectors as a poor audience recording, most of which was unbootlegged until the release of the three CD Japanese set One To One Concert. […] side two of the Instant Analysis release Hound Dog included four cuts from the unprocessed audience tape, some of which are more complete than the Japanese collection. They too are in abysmal quality, but due to their content must be considered as the suggested bootleg source.” [Madinger and Easter, p. 81]”\n\n****\n\nHonorable mention goes to two later bootlegs:\n\nThis tastefully done Melvin Records release made the core list for the ABC broadcast versions of “Instant Karma”, “Come Together”, “Cold Turkey” and “Hound Dog” as well as “Mother”, which is called an “ABC Outtake” in Eight Arms….\n\n***\n\nI should also mention the Hoffman Avenue Records title Plop Plop….Fizz Fizz (which can be found here) and their dissing of how other bootleggers presented this material, featured prominently on top of the back insert:\n\n***\n\nThis 1990s Yoko Ono bootleg is a core release at least for the ABC broadcast version of “Sisters, O Sisters”.\n\nThis song was officially released on the Live In New York City where it was edited and features a single track lead vocal but it is unedited on the bootleg recording and due to some post-production for the ABC airing a second lead vocal has been dubbed. There are many more differences and explained edits for the available non-bootlegged versions, which are explained in detail in Eight Arms To Hold You or issue # 9 of the 1987 publication ‘Illegal Beatles‘.\n\n****"
