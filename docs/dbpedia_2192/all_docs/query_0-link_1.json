        "text": "Hot Wacks VIII from 1980 !\n\nThe cover photographs are by punk rock photography legend Rodney Bowes credited as 'RODEY BOWES'.\n\nHot Wacks is a book about bootlegs with lists of bootlegs available at the time. Bootlegging was very common in the 1970's and a thriving industry in it's own right albeit illegal and underground! This was a reference book for collectors.\n\nYou can also see that there are some posters listed as well. DAvid Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith and more.\n\nAlso included:\n\nA-Z .. Starts with AC/DC.. includes a lot of the classic artists of the day. We’d be happy to check if your favourite artist is listed and let you know how many entries there are.\n\nWikipedia has this to say about Hot Wacks:\n\n“Hot Wacks is a Canadian book that has been in circulation for over 25 years, featuring reviews of bootleg music releases. Reviews include information such as source, quality, track listing and packaging. It is commonly referred to as the 'Bootleg Bible' by bootleg collectors. Hot Wacks was the work of Kurt Glemser. Before Hot Wacks he wrote two other bootleg discographies - Bootlegs (March, 1973) followed by Underground Sounds (October, 1974). It was published in Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nHot Wacks spawned a magazine Hot Wacks Quarterly which also reviewed bootlegs as well as other collectible records (Communist pressings, box sets, etc.) as well as featuring pictorials of female rockers.\n\nHot Wacks went through 15 printings starting with Hot Wacks Book I (November, 1975) and ending with Book XV: The Last Wacks. The latter was almost 800 pages long. Additional Supplements, numbering 1 - 6 were published after Book version XV.”\n\nThe book is the size of a conventional paperback and is approx 1.5 cm thick\n\n210 pages."
