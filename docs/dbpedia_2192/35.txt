HOT WACKS REFERENCE GUIDES & PERIODICALS

09/14/15

Hot Wacks has been the 'grand daddy' of bootleg reference guides. It has been called 'The Bootleg Bible' by some and was even published under license in the UK under that title. By its own admission, it is/was an alphabetical by artist compendium of bootleg release information with titles, track listings, sources if known, and a description of the media, labels and cover type. The editor was dependent upon either bootleg producers sending them sample copies or collectors forwarding information to be included in an issue. It was acknowledged to not be complete and was intended to be a resource for collectors as they searched for their next boot acquisition. For many of us, it was indispensible.

The publication went through its own evolution over time, starting with a book that was then further updated in an expanded, cumulative edition, and then a short lived companion quarterly magazine with relevant articles and color photos of releases. It then became a final cumulative edition in 1992, followed by 7 supplement books detailing only new releases. Finally, their output changed to first a subscription based and now a free online version that seems to have launched in mid-2003.

Part of the challenge that this series has endured, was to ride out the evolution of the bootleg recording format. As modern collectors know, bootlegs began initially as a vinyl LP format, which was inaugurated by the first Bob Dylan, Great White Wonder LP in 1969, that was acknowledged to have opened the bootleg floodgates for the rock n' roll era. The media format later transitioned into CD and CDR releases in the early 1980's, and was further augmented by the release of bootleg videos and DVDs.

To quote from book issue VII:

"HOT WACKS was first issued in 1975. The first edition, which consisted of two volumes, had only a run of 500 copies. Since then our press runs have steadily increased as has the size of the book. It has become steadily harder to keep up to date with new releases because of the work involved in updating each new edition.

Some critics feel that we only cover 85% of the bootlegs available (see BOMP March, 1979 page 35). Yet even they realize that it is because of the time needed to prepare the next edition. By the time you read this at least 50 new releases will have appeared."

In my opinion, the bootleg collecting community owes a great deal of debt to both Kurt Glemser and subsequently Bob Walker for their pioneering work in producing this reference series.

Historically it is worth noting that Kurt Glemser preceded the publication of the first edition of Hot Wacks, with the publication of two other bootleg discographies - Bootlegs (March, 1973), followed by Underground Sounds (October, 1974).

I am posting the following summary of images, so that collectors will have a visual reference of the Hot Wacks issues that were published for their possible acquisition.

******************************************************************************************************************

The current online version of Hot Wacks appears to concentrate on CD and DVD releases only, and forsakes any vinyl releases, whether they were issued before 2003 or after.

It is still a wonderfully illustrated and detailed listing of more current bootleg releases.

Additionally, it is probably worth noting that this Canadian publication is occasionally confused with a Scottish fanzine also called Hot Wacks. This other one occupied a similar terrain to that of the UK Zig Zag magazine, before the advent of punk. It was published in Edinburg, Scotland from February 1974 - May 1983, with a total of only 23 issues.
