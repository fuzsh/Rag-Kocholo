The Who: An Illustrated Discography by Ed Hanel

(ISBN 0.86001.810.5 Omnibus Press)

Though long outdated, I still highly recommend this book. It lists regular WHO and solo

releases from the U.K./ U.S./ Canada, Germany and many other countries, as well as

vinyl and tape bootlegs up to 1981 and provides more detail than most other source,

however, this book does not list CDs.

This book has been reissued and is again available.

Hot Wacks: The Last Wacks - Hot Wacks Book XV as well as; Supplements 1, 2, 3,

4, 5 & 6. (ISBN 0-96980 80-3-8, Fourth Printing May 1995 (Hot Wacks Press, P.O.Box

544 Owen Sound, Ontario, N4K 5R1 CANADA, Fax 519-376-9449)

This series of books list in brief detail information such as LP / CD titles, track lists,

labels, index #'s, sound quality and any other details (if known). Supplements are

periodically issued.

A “must have” for all serious bootleg collectors!
