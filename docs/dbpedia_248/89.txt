Vasaloppet’s historical background stretches almost 500 years back in time, more precisely to 1520, at a time when Sweden was under Danish rule. Gustav Eriksson Vasa, a Swedish noble opposed to the Danes, was a fugitive hunted throughout Dalarna by soldiers of the Danish King Kristian II, but sheltered and protected by the people of Dalarna. After many adventurous episodes, Gustav Vasa was finally elected king of a free Sweden on 6th June 1523. Four hundred years later, in 1922, Anders Pers, from Mora and editor of a local newspaper, wrote about the contemporary interest in skiing, and linked this to Gustav Eriksson Vasa’s flight on skis from Mora towards Norway in 1521. He also launched the idea of a commemorative Vasaloppet between Sälen and Mora.

After some discussion in the press IFK Mora’s Board of Directors on March 5th decided to organise a trial race. The national newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, donated 1000 crowns to the organisers thereby providing a financial backing to run the first Vasaloppet on Sunday 19th March 1922. In total there were 136 entries via telegraph and telephone and at the start there were 119 skiers. Ernst Alm, from Norsjö, won the 90 km race in a time of 7 hours 32 minutes and 49 seconds.

Vasaloppet COURSE

Vasaloppets course, Vasalopps Arena, as locals call it, lies between Sälen and Mora villages of Dalarna region and is framed by small chalet villages and open pine forests, crossed by gravel tracks and paths beaten out by generation after generation making their way between the villages. Vasalopps Arena is very far from wild football hooligans, VIP reception lounges, and flashing neon signs with the latest match results. This arena is something completely different. Over the years it has become an important part of the national soul, containing a lure, a challenge, and the promise of adventure and a lifetime memory. It has declared 90 kilometres long and 10 metres wide nature reserve. It is in truth a unique nature reserve well worth a visit in both the summer and winter seasons.
