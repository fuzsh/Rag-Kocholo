Ghanaian attacker Kingsley Asante Ofori recorded a brace for SJK Akatemia in their 9-1 home win against Vasa IFK in the Finnish league.

Ofori registered SJK's third goal in the 21st after striker Valentine Gasc and midfielder Robbie Malolo had put the home side up by two goals.

The 19 year old doubled his goal tally in the 88th minute to register his fourth of the season in the last three matches for SJK Akatemia.

Both goals were produced in fashion that showcased his incredible skills on the ball. He wriggled his way through two Vasa IFK defenders to place the ball in the bottom corner to score the first goal. And then latched on to a through ball, skipped past a defender to his second of the game.

Prior to this game, Ofori had found the net in each of their previous two fixtures. Kingsley is on a six months loan deal at the Finnish club and is being rumoured to Spanish side Elche in the summer.
