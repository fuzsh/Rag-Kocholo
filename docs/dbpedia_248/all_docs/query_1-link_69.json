The club changed its name in 1988 after a merger with another club, BK-48, and was called BK-IFK during the late 1900s. The name was changed back to VIFK in year 2000.\n\nContents\n\nCurrent squad\n\nAchievements\n\nSeason to season\n\nReferences\n\nTheir representative team moved up to Ykk√∂nen at end of season 2005 which is the second-highest level in Finland. The visit lasted three years and the team was relegated to Kakkonen after finishing 12th place in the 2008 season.\n\nThe club has a great history, but has yet to achieve the same kind of success as in the mid-20th century. Vasa IFK have won the Finnish championship three times, in 1944, 1946 and 1953. They were runners-up in 1945 and 1951 and finished third in 1950 and 1955. In 1947 and 1948, Vasa IFK also won the league hosted by the FA. In that time there were two separate leagues due to political circumstances. The other league was hosted by the organisation for the labour clubs, TUL.\n\nThe club has also been active in women's football and other sports. In 1949 and in 1964 VIFK was the runner-up for the Finnish championship in bandy.\n\nThe current chairman of the club is Henrik Skytte."
