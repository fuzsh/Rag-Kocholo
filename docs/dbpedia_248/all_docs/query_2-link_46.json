        "text": "This may be the coolest Finnish rifle I’ve found yet.\n\nAccording to Suojeluskuntain Ase- ja Konepaja Oy inspection records, the rifle was equipped with one-piece birch stock. It was inspected by Kosti Eskola at the factory in Riihimäki on 6 July 1928 and shipped to Helsinki Civil Guard District on 9 July 1928. From the District it was transferred to Swedish-speaking Vita Avdelta Kompaniet (\"White Separate Company\", VAK). This Civil Guard was formed in 1923 around Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna, Helsingfors (\"Sports Association Comrades, Helsinki\"), Tekniska Förening (\"Technical Association\", an association for Swedish-speaking people with MSc in engineering or architecture) and Vasa Nation (\"Vaasa Nation\", a student organisation in University of Helsinki). The VAK flag contains the symbols of all three founding organisations.\n\nThe rifle was first issued to Guardsman Rödlin on 5 June 1929. During an inspection on 11 April 1933, it was noted the sights have been filed down and the condition of the barrel has been reduced to \"II\" (out from I to IV). Rödlin returned the rifle back to the armoury on 21 March 1935. Another Guardsman briefly used the rifle between May 1935 and January 1936, after which the rifle was again returned to the armoury. Apparently there was something wrong on the stock as it was repaired at the District armoury in March 1936. Unfortunately, there isn't any detailed information available at the time of the nature of the repair. During the final pre-war inspection on 13 April 1939, it was noted there was was a problem with the sight leaf. Again, no detailed information about the nature of the problem has been written down.\n\nCarl-Christian Rosenbröijer was issued with the rifle on 28 September 1939. He was born in Helsinki in 1921 and had not been conscripted before the Finnish Defence Forces were mobilised in October 1939. He was transferred to Tykistökoulutuskeskus 2 (\"Artillery Training Centre\") operating near the City of Vaasa and was still being trained as an artillery officer when the Winter War ended in March 1940. It seems he was forced to leave the rifle behind him when he was transferred or discharged in 1940. Rosenbröijer worked as an artillery officer during the Continuation War and as a business executive in the Finnish paper industry after the war. He passed away in Kauniainen in 2015. The rifle was probably moved to storage in late 1940 and returned to the Civil Guard on 18 March 1941. There seems to have been no further users during the Interim Peace.\n\nOne additional document I had found earlier indicates a m/28, \"No. 7586\", was returned by the 2nd Company of Erillinen Pataljoona 14 (2./Er.P 14, \"Separate Battalion 14\") to Pohjois-Satakunta Civil Guard District storage upon the demobilisation of the Finnish Defence Forces on 21 November 1944. The handguard of the rifle was listed as broken. The Company was formerly the 5th Company of Jalkaväkirykmentti 60 (5./JR 60, \"Infantry Regiment 60\") until April 1944. \"KT\" might refer to the user of the rifle during the time when it was issued to the Company.\n\nM/28 rifles were removed from Finnish Defence Force service on 1 January 1986 and the rifle was exported to Canada sometime in the 1980s or 1990s.\n\nBELOW: Guardsmen of Vita Avdelta Kompanie sometime during the 1920s or 1930s.\n\nBELOW: Undated photograph of Carl-Christian Rosenbröijer was published in Helsingin Sanomat newspaper upon his death in 2015."
