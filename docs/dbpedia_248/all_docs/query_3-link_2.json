        "text": "The Ski Classics Pro Tour starts March with the traditional and centennial Vasaloppet on Sunday, March 2, 2025. The 90-kilometer classic race in Sweden marks the 10th stage and the third Grand Classics event of Season XVI.\n\nVasaloppet, the 90-kilometer race on the first Sunday of March, is the oldest and most prestigious event in Ski Classics. With 15 thousand participants standing together at the same starting area, this long-distance race is one that every Pro Team athlete dreams about winning.\n\nIn 2025, the iconic Vasaloppet celebrates its 101st edition in a true Folkfest. According to many skiers, it is the most prestigious of all long-distance skiing events. It will also mark 100 years since the first radio broadcast from Vasaloppet, the first Swedish national radio broadcast from a sporting event.\n\nVasaloppet – Ski Classics Pro Tour – Event 10\n\nDate: Sunday, March 2, 2025\n\nPlace: Sälen-Mora, Sweden\n\nDistance: 90km\n\nTime: 7:50 – 12:55 CET\n\nHighest Point: 526m\n\nElevation Gain: 948m\n\nLast Edition Winners: Emilie Fleten (4:23:06.7) and Torleif Syrstad (3:52:43.7)\n\nSC Play: Vasaloppet\n\nMore information about Vasaloppet can be found HERE\n\nRelevance and Traditions\n\nVasaloppet is not just the biggest ski race in the world; it’s also one of the most significant sports events globally. The brand has evolved into an institution with several events and activities in its annual Summer and Winter weeks.\n\nSince 1922, over 1.8 million participants have crossed Vasaloppet’s finish line portal. The race’s saga goes back to 1520, depicting the tale of Gustav Eriksson Vasa, who rebelled against Denmark and eventually became the first King of free Sweden.\n\nA Popular Mountain Destination\n\nSälen, the start location of Vasaloppet, is Sweden’s most popular alpine ski area, known for its seven alpine ski resorts. The oldest of them is Högfjällshotellet, which was built in 1937 and remained one of the most popular vacation destinations in the area. In 2019, Scandinavian Mountains Airport opened.\n\nMany mountain huts also serve waffles, snacks, and hot drinks, which Vasaloppet participants can enjoy before the long journey from Sälen to Mora.\n\nSwedish Tradition at its Best\n\nOf course, Mora is world-famous as the finish location of Vasaloppet, but it is much more. There is a very idyllic Scandinavian-style downtown area with boutiques, cafés with Swedish’ fika,’ great diners, and restaurants serving local dishes.\n\nThe town is also known for its Mora knives and longcase clocks, and today, for example, high-quality mixer taps with functional designs are manufactured and sold in the global market. Everyone also knows the area’s symbol: “Dalahäst,” a traditional carved, painted wooden statue of a horse originating in the Swedish province of Dalarna. IFK Mora is one of the most successful cross-country ski clubs in Sweden.\n\nWith good cooperation over the years, Vasaloppet and Ski Classics have continued to develop together, bringing a century of traditions and culture since 1922 and recreating it in a modern way.\n\nSki Classics Pro Tour Season XVI (2024/2025)\n\nEvent 0: Friday, December 13, 2024 -Ski Classics Pro Team Presentation XVI – Bad Gastein, Austria\n\nEvent 1: Saturday, December 14, 2024 – Bad Gastein ITT – Sportgastein, Austria, 7km\n\nEvent 2: Sunday, December 15, 2024 – Bad Gastein Criterium – Sportgastein, Austria, 36km\n\nEvent 3: Saturday, January 11, 2025 – 3 Zinnen Ski-Marathon – Sexten, Italy, 60km\n\nEvent 4: Sunday, January 12, 2025 – La Venosta ITT Kapron-Melago – Val Venosta, Italy, 12km\n\nEvent 5: Saturday, January 18, 2025 – Engadin La Diagonela – Pontresina-Zuoz, Switzerland, 55km\n\nEvent 6: Sunday, January 26, 2025 – Marcialonga – Trentino, Italy, 70km\n\nEvent 7: Sunday, February 9, 2025 – Jizerská50 – Bedřichov, Czech Republic, 50km\n\nEvent 8: Saturday, February 15, 2025 – Grönklitt Criterium 61 – Orsa Grönklitt, Sweden, 61km\n\nEvent 9: Sunday, February 16, 2025 – Grönklitt ITT – Orsa Grönklitt, Sweden, 12km\n\nEvent 10: Sunday, March 2, 2025 – Vasaloppet – Sälen-Mora, Sweden, 90km\n\nEvent 11: Release June 3, 12:00 CET\n\nEvent 12: Release June 4, 12:00 CET\n\nEvent 13: Release June 5, 12:00 CET\n\nEvent 14: Release June 5, 18:30 CET\n\nFull Calendar Release: June 6, 12:00 CET\n\nThe Season XVI of Ski Classics Pro Tour consists of 14 events on 10 event weekends in 6 different countries.
