        "text": "The 95th Vasaloppet will start in Sälen on Sunday, March 3, 2019, at 08:00. Vasaloppet is fully booked, as usual, which means 15,800 registered participants. In total around 62,000 participants have registered so far for the Vasaloppet Winter Week 2019 races. This is the 42nd year that Vasaloppet will be broadcast live on Swedish Television. Here is some background information for the world's biggest cross-country ski race.\n\nHistory\n\nGustav Eriksson’s adventure in Dalarna took place during the winter of 1520–21. In 1523 he was elected King of Sweden. The first Vasaloppet took place on Sunday, March 19, 1922. Now the 95th Vasaloppet will take place, which is also the 23rd with a special competition class for women (started in 1997). Three races have been cancelled: 1932, 1934 and 1990. Since 1948 the race has always run on the first Sunday of March, except in 2015 when the race ran on the second Sunday because of the World Ski Championships in Falun.\n\nThe first live TV broadcast of Vasaloppet took place in 1966. This will be the 42nd time that Vasaloppet (in part or in its entirety) is transmitted live, and it’s the 37th time that the Vasaloppet start is broadcast live on television. 1973 was the first year with a live broadcast in colour. Since 1992 Vasaloppet has been shown live every year. Vasaloppet and SVT’s current broadcasting agreement extends until 2020. Vasaloppet was first broadcast on Swedish Radio in 1925.\n\nSince 1922 a total of 575,620 Vasaloppet skiers have completed the 90-kilometre Vasaloppet; put together they have covered a distance equal to 1,292 round the world trips or 67 journeys to the moon and back!\n\nCounties\n\nVästra Götaland has now passed Stockholm as the county with most participants in Vasaloppet! Halland also breaks into the top ten counties list this year. The ten biggest counties in Vasaloppet 2019 are, according to this week’s statistics: Västra Götaland 2,787 participants, Stockholm 2,527, Jönköping 801, Dalarna 787, Skåne 705, Östergötland 700, Uppsala 675, Halland 533, Västerbotten 459, Värmland 433. (Changes can be made up until the start so statistics are not final.)\n\nBut if you look at the amount of Vasaloppet participants in 2019 per capita things look a bit different: Dalarna (2.74 participants per 1000 residents) is biggest followed by Jämtland (2.27), Jönköping (2.21), Uppsala (1.79) and Norrbotten (1.72).\n\nNations\n\nVasaloppet 2019 has participants from 45 different nations, counting Sweden. About 3,700 of the registered participants come from countries other than Sweden, most from Norway (1,115). Then come Finland (551), Denmark (462), Germany (303), Czech Republic (264), Estonia (138), Switzerland (138), Italy (132), Netherlands (91), Iceland (67), Austria (64), Russia (63), France (51), Great Britain (32), Belgium (31), Canada (29) and the USA (24).\n\nThe Average Skier\n\nThe average age of Sweden’s population (2018-12-31) is 41.23 years. The average age in Vasaloppet 2019 is 42.2 (42.8 for the gents and 39.0 for the ladies) and the average participant has skied Vasaloppet previously 3.7 times. For the first time ever there are over 2,500 women ladies registered for Vasaloppet, which means we’ll have 16 percent female participants in the tracks this Sunday.\n\nThe Elite\n\nAndreas Nygaard, Norway, won Vasaloppet 2018 and the ladies’ class victor was Lina Korsgren, Sweden. The latest men’s class winner from Sweden was Jörgen Brink in 2012. The male winners these past six years have all been from Norway.\n\nApart from Andreas Nygaard we’ll see several previous victors in the elite group this year: Anders Aukland, 2004, Jörgen Brink, 2010, 2011 and 2012, John Kristian Dahl, 2014, 2016 and 2017 as well as Petter Eliassen, 2015. Also worth noting: Stanislav Rezác, Czech Republic (born 1973), skiing his 21st Vasaloppet this year. 14 out of 20 times Rezác has been in the top 10, and in the top 3 six times, but no win.\n\nThe female winners from these past four years are all in the elite start group this year: Laila Kveli, 2013 and 2014, Katerina Smutná, 2016, Britta Johansson Norgren, 2017 and Lina Korsgren 2018.\n\nVasaloppet 2018, men:\n\n1) Andreas Nygaard, NOR, 4.24.36\n\n2) Bob Niemi Impola, SWE, 4.24.39\n\n3) Stian Hoelgaard, NOR, 4.24.40\n\n4) Jörgen Brink, SWE, 4.24.41\n\n5) Öystein Pettersen, NOR, 4.24.41\n\n6) Magnus Vesterheim, NOR, 4.24.41\n\n7) Stanislav Rezác, CZE, 4.24.42\n\n8) Anders Aukland, NOR, 4.24.42\n\n9) Tord Asle Gjerdalen, NOR, 4.24.42\n\n10) Thomas Gifstad, NOR, 4.24.42\n\nVasaloppet 2018, women:\n\n1) Lina Korsgren, SWE, 4.41.50\n\n2) Astrid Öyre Slind, NOR, 4.46.31\n\n3) Katerina Smutná, CZE, 4.47.48\n\n4) Britta Johansson Norgren, SWE, 4.51.51\n\n5) Sara Lindborg, SWE, 4.56.02\n\n6) Heli Heiskanen, FIN, 5.00.56\n\n7) Laila Kveli, NOR, 5.03.37\n\n8) Roxana Lacroix, FRA, 5.12.18\n\n9) Marit Engeseth, NOR, 5.12.47\n\n10) Evelina Bångman, SWE, 5.14.34\n\nOdds\n\nThe Svenska Spel gambling site gives odds for Vasaloppet 2019:\n\nspela.svenskaspel.se/oddset\n\nCross-country cup\n\nThe international cross-country cup Visma Ski Classics takes place for the ninth time.

The first prize is a kiss, a garland, a trophy and 95,000 SEK (for both the winning man and woman). The men’s class winner will also get the Kranskulla honorary award. The first prize is now raised by 1,000 SEK every year.\n\nThere are seven spurt prizes for both men and women: 10,000 SEK in Evertsberg (The Hill Prize) and 5,000 SEK at the six other checkpoints; Smågan, Mångsbodarna, Risberg, Oxberg, Hökberg and Eldris. Vasaloppet’s total prize sum for 2019 is over 565,000 SEK. (Visma Ski Classics also has its own spurt prizes for Mångsbodarna and Evertsberg.)\n\nIf a winner, male or female, breaks the Vasaloppet record time for their class they are awarded a 50,000 SEK record bonus.\n\nEveryone who completes Vasaloppet gets a diploma. Participants who finish within the winning time plus 50 percent are also awarded the Vasaloppet medal. In 2018, 3,054 men were awarded the medal. For them the medal time was 6.36.54 since Andreas Nygaard’s winning time was 4.24.36. 181 women were also awarded the medal in Vasaloppet 2018. The 2018 medal time for women was 7.02.45 since Lina Korsgren’s winning time was 4.41.50.\n\nKranskulla and Kransmas\n\nThis year’s Kranskulla is skier and biathlete Emma Höglund (Kranskulla no. 95) and the Kransmas is ski cross competitor Victor Sticko (Kransmas no. 31), both from IFK Mora.\n\nRecords\n\n57 men have won the 94 races. One time, in 1988, the victory was shared. Most Vasaloppet victories: Nils ”Mora-Nisse” Karlsson (9 wins), Janne Stefansson (7 wins), Arthur Häggblad and Jan Ottosson (4 wins), Oskar Svärd, Daniel Tynell and Jörgen Brink and John Kristian Dahl (3 wins).\n\nSofia Lind has most victories, four, in the women’s class (1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005). Sofia Lind was also the top woman in 1996, the year before Vasaloppet’s official ladies class was introduced.\n\nErnst Alm, who in 1922 won the very first Vasaloppet, is the youngest male victor. He was 22 years and 18 days old when he won (born 1900-03-01). The oldest Vasaloppet victor is Jörgen Brink who was 37 years, 11 months and 23 days when he won in 2012 (born 1974-03-10).\n\nYoungest and oldest Vasaloppet winners among the ladies, since the official women’s class was introduced in 1997, are Sofia Lind (born 1975-09-04) and Svetlana Nagejkina (born 1965-02-02). Sofia Lind was 21 when she won in 1997 and Svetlana Nagejkina was 37 when she won in 2002.\n\nJust eight male and three female winners have managed to defend their Vasaloppet title by winning two years in a row. The latest were John Kristian Dahl in 2017 and Laila Kveli in 2014.\n\nOnly four victors have won three or more Vasaloppet in a row: Nils ”Mora-Nisse” Karlsson (a total of 9 wins, of which 7 were in a row), Janne Stefansson (7 total wins, 5 in a row), Jan Ottosson (4 wins, 3 in a row) and Jörgen Brink (3 wins). The highest number of years between a victor’s first and last win is 10 years (”Mora-Nisse” Karlsson 1943–1953).\n\nThe current record time for men is 3.38.41 (Jörgen Brink, 2012) and for women 4.08.24 (Vibeke Skofterud, 2012).\n\nThe largest winning margin in the men’s class was when Nils ”Mora-Nisse” Karlsson won by 21 minutes and 17 seconds. The largest winning margin in the ladies’ class, since its official introduction in 1997, is from Vasaloppet 2003: Ulrica Persson won by 10 minutes and 5 seconds. The smallest margin between the male and female victors was in 2007 when Elin Ek was only 4 minutes and 49 seconds after the male winner Oskar Svärd. (Best total placement for a lady was Justyna Kowalczyk in 2015, who was 71st to cross the finish line. Britta Johansson Norgren was 89th that same year. Elin Ek was 92nd in 2007.)\n\nIn 2013 Jörgen Aukland became history’s first Vasaloppet winner to pole his way through the whole race without using grip wax (since skate was prohibited). In 2014 Laila Kveli became the first lady to win without grip wax.\n\nLive Broadcasts around the World\n\nIn addition to Sweden, Vasaloppet 2019 will be live broadcast on TV in the following 16 countries: Norway, Finland, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, France, Denmark, Latvia, Israel, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

See the complete list of races below.\n\nVasaloppet’s Summer Week 2018 attracted 33,147 registered participants!\n\nVasaloppstrippeln\n\nVasaloppstrippeln means completing three different types of Vasaloppet during one and the same calendar year.
