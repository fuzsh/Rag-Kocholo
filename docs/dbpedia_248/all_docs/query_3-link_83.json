        "text": "Anders Ström won his first race in 1923 at regional level. His greatest achievement came three years after the 1928 Winter Olympics, when he won the Vasa run as the first runner from Mora in the Dalarna province. Together with his brother Johan and Harald Nyström, both non-Olympians, he was also a member of the best team (IFK Mora) in the 1931 Vasa Run."
