We present below our usual detailed figures for the previous week, covering the returns for the period ending with Saturday noon Sept. 16, and the results for the corresponding week in 1898, 1897 and 1896 are also given. In comparison with the preceding week there is an increase in the aggregate exchanges of three hundred and thirty-nine million dollars, the gain at New York beirg two hundred and twenty-two millions. Contrasted with the week of 1898 the total for the whole country shows an increase of 280 per cent. Compared with the week of 1897 the current returntrecord a gain of 236 per cent, and the excess over 896 is 961 per cent. Outside of New York the increase over 1898 Is 26 2 percent. The excess over 1897 reaches 23-4 per cent, and making comparison with 1896 the gain is seen to be 61 '5 p. c. full details of clearings for ' 339,100 296.088 285,114 252,641 255,721 182.392,892 25,762,494 2,355.392 1.821,948 2,138,634 149.688.413 18,801,747 1,965,349 1,532,876 1,345,205 1,268,303 810,862 669,143 608,138 326,837 114.696 21 -7 13-6 27-5 35-7 -I-6-8 +321 --14-8 --44-7 --320 --21-2 --22-6 - -17*5 +9-9 300.30i -i-11-7 -110 +39-3 359,114 253,200 -I-18-5 283 948 -tl-7 4-15-2 4-27-6 285,562 194,546 149,601 208.174 -1-21-8 139.124,620 - -370 - -19-9 -18-9 - -590 - -76-7 +56-5 -13-2 28,360.519 12,104,015 9,263,981 6.625,031 4,391,037 3,095,082 2,234,765 1,300,629 669,587 833.342 439.219 289.813 62,973 95.747 -I-19-5 12,204,363 9,933,809 5,420,570 6,000,905 2,415,925 1,398,221 750,000 41,405,2211 -(-23-4 40.400.973] 31,841,294 6.693,935 7.591,696 3.647 250 4.516.447 2.990.986 3-766 527 2.029.367 1.568,183 1,420,166 948,698 1.825.9H2 Helena Fargo Sioux Falls 28,258.199 5.806.974 5.896,190 4,262,600 4-12-7 4-15-3 28,942.259 6.118.874 5.874.082 3,373,^50 4 247,830 398155 129,864 Total Pacific Kansas City Minneapolis Paul Denver Joseph Des Moines Davenport Sioux City St. Topeka Wichita Fremont Hastings Tot. other West.

Nor can we see any other explanacept by its French people regarding Dreyfus matter than their feeling that if the outbreak is to come, the army and its leaders must at all hazards be kept satisfied and loyal. That the army itself needs thorough reformation in its ideals and practices has been proved as conclusively by the proceedings at Rennes as by Lionel Decle's monograph, and the French people certainly cannot fail to see the system's points of weakness.

The vague intimation that \"something is likely to happen \" in the Grovernment or politics of that nation may be, and very possibly is, a product of the general restlessness of the day, which manifests itself more strikingly, as such conditions always have done, in the affairs of France. Possibly the shadow will fade away as so many other political clouds have done in France during recent years. Or it may be that the outcome will be a much-needed strengthening of the hands of Government for it is a strong administration for which many observant students of the times believe France to have been groping, and there is a very general feeling, in and out of the country itself, that things cannot go on much longer exactly as they The influences favoring conhave done in the past. servative solution of social and political problems ; are so overwhelmingly powerful in these days that a change, if change there is to be, is more likely to come on those lines than on any others. In other words, we think predictions of a violent movement against the existing order very ill-grounded a belief in which we have been strengthened by the ; and absurdity of all recent demonstrations in that direction. Yet in any situation of the kind there futility is always the inevitable \"perhaps.\" We do not see how The impression which study just submitted, of the Atchison Railway Company leaves of the annual report, Topeka and Santa Fe (1) that there has been a very extensive amount of new construction and improvement work done, partly out of earnings and is from capital account; (2) that there has been wonderful progress and expansion in the traflBc and revenues of the system, and (3) that the property is being managed with increasing economy and efficiency. The results which always attend such conditions have been experienced in this instance, namely increased partly returns for the security holders, the Adjustment Income bonds getting the first benefits and then the preferred stock falling in line and receiving dividends which hardly any one had dared look for so soon. Attention was directed a year ago to the heavy outlays for improvements and additions, and reference made to the statement of the management that the extraordinary betterment expenses paid for out of earnings might be expected to decline after the close of the calendar year 1898. This expectation has been measure realized, and yet the expenditures in this way have been very heavy nevertheless. From the in a analysis of the operating expenses given in the report, Tfe find that $7,672,108 was spent upon Maintenance THE CHRONICLE. 620 Boad and Structures While in the late fiscal year. compares with 18,281,398 for 1897-8, thus showing a reduction of $609,290, it compares with but $7,007,345 in 1896-7. Upon Maintenance of Equipment more was spent even than in the preceding year, the figures being $4,810,795 for 1898-9, $4,659,278 for of this [Vol; LXIX. net earnings were not afected by the change of methods noted. The total of the net is $12,906,81Y for the late twelve months, against $10,707,764 in 1897-8 and $8,396,428 in 1896-7— an improvement in the space of two years of over 50 per cent. After deducting rentals and other similar items, the amount net for the late year was $11,429,969, and the strength 1897-8 and $3,826,816 for 1896-7. The charged in expenses was equal to no less than $2,032 per locomotive, $715 per passenger car and $74 per freight car. Over 248 miles of track were ballasted new, 168 miles of ballast were renewed, 681 miles of new steel rails laid, 111 miles of second-hand steel rails laid, 496 miles of new fencing put in, 13 miles of wooden bridges, trestles and culverts replaced by permanent work, and 2,587,883 ties in the track renewed. In addition to this work, paid for out of earnings, almost four million dollars more was spent for improvements, extensions and additions, which have been charged to capital account in exact figures, the outlay paid with new capital was $3,919,726. — matter of course that, as the result of expenditures and outlays, traffic is being these heavy moved with much greater economy and efficiency. The company transported 1134- million tons of freight It follows as a more one mile than in the previous year, and did it with an actual decrease in the freight train mileage, the number of miles run by the freight trains being only 16,737,227, against 18,436,412, while the freightcar mileage was reduced from 370^ million miles to 354 million miles. The average train load was raised from 142 to 161^ tons, or not far from 14 per cent. The showing here is more noteworthy than might appear from the face of the figures. The improvement has been almost wholly the result of the increase in the capacity of the cars, effected in considerable part through the strengthening of the old cars. The company had the benefit for only two or three months of the larger engines provided. With these engines in use the whole twelve months, and with more of the same kind provided (48 locomotives being on June 30 1899 under contract for delivery during the three succeeding months, in addition to 58 delivered in 1898-9), the showing for the current or new fiscal year may be expected to be yet more striking. With reference to the growth in earnings, this is not reflected to the full extent in the company's statement of earnings. Apparently the increase in gross receipts over the year preceding has been only $1,299,399. But 712 in the the report this is in miscellaneous face of a decrease of $599,- earnings, such decrease, company's income position will be apparent whe^ we say that with this amount of net the obligatory ifixed charges were only $5,188,132, leaving a balance of $6,241,837. Parenthetically it may be pointed of the out that these fixed charges consist almost entirely of the interest on the 4 per cent general mortgage bonds, whiclj are practically a first lien on the entire system thousand miles, the only underlying interesttbearing bonds outstanding unon any railroad in the System being the $1,500,000 of Chicago & St. Louis bonds and $629,000 of bonds still out on the Chicago Santa Fe & California Railway. Even as regards the Adjustment Incomes, the company's position is a very strong one, for the call at the full 4 per cent on these incomes was only $2,053,840, as against the $0,241,837 of earnings available. Deducting the income interest, the final balance of net income was $4,187,997, which is equal to 3| per cent on the $114,199,530 of preferred stock outstanding. It will be remembered that in July the preferred stock was put on a basis of 2^ per cent dividends, payable per cent each six months. The first dividend ever paid on this preferred stock was 1 per cent last Januof over seven H ary. The 2i per cent will call for $2,854,142. the balance of income was, as we have As seen, $4,187,- 997, there will thus remain It million dollars surplus over and above even these dividend requirements. The report points out that the prospects for busi- ness during the current year, so far as they can now be forecast, are fully as good as for the year covered This seems a moderate statement by the report. considering that business revival is still in progress, and that Kansas, in which so large a part of the mileage of the system is located, has been blessed the present season with a phenomenally abundant corn crop. As bearing upon the importance of this last circumstance, it is worth noting that the gain in the freight traffic in the late year was not in the agricultural tonnage, of which indeed only 2,901,093 tons were moved, against 3,009,264 tons in 1897-8. In wheat there was considerable increase, the tonnage being 949,204 tons, against 861,108 tons, reflecting the exceptional wheat crop raised in Kansas, but the corn tonnage fell off, being only 376,750 tons, against 582,023 tons, the Kansas corn crop in 1898 having been poor. The current season this situation the wheat crop is not as good as last is just reversed year, but the corn crop is of extraordinary dimensions, tells us, being due to a change in the methods of accounting by which balances only are stated (instead of the debits and credits in full) in the case of such items as car mileage and rentals of locomotives, cars, tracks, terminals and switching. Bui for this change of method, miscellaneous earn- being estimated at above 300 million bushels, as ings would have increased $22,437, instead of showing against but 133 million bushels in 1898 and 162 : $599,712 decrease.

It may have escaped notice that of the gain in earnings in 1897-8 $1,180,598 came from passengers and of the gain in 1898-9 $778,780 came from that depart- ment, making pretty nearly two million dollars. Further additions from that direction the current year would be no surprise. The company's finances are in excellent shape. After having for a long time refrained from putting on the market the general mortgage 4 per cents to which it was entitled for improvements and additions made (the idea in withholding the bonds being to get the advantage of improved prices), nine million dollars of the bonds were disposed of in the late year. The accrued interest to June 30 on the Adjustment Incomes is now carried as a liability in the balance sheet; this made total interest unpaid and accrued cannot be denied that money is ex-^ tremely scarce throughout the country, chiefly on account of the many millions that were raised during the last few years, partly for the building of railways, partly for the creation of new industrial ventures now being practically absorbed and giving so far but Moreover, the circulation of little or no return. money in Russia cannot by any means be compared with that in any other country; for, excepting the highly developed private banking in the Western and Southern provinces, it is the Imperial Bank, possessing a great many agencies scattered all over the country, that has to perform the whole gigantic work of distributing and transferring money throughout the Empire. Under such circumstances it will readily be understood that money, when once brought out to the remoter provinces, is very slow to find its way back to the large financial and] industrial centres, all the more so as, in spite of the inducements held out by an excellent system of savings banks, very large ISTevertheless it June 30 $3,539,777.

On the other side of the account, however, we find $5,530,207 of actual cash, $3,200,053 of accounts receivable, and securities valued at $3,136,909. The company is also carrying an unusually large stock of materials and supplies, the total June 30 1899 standing at $2,860,778. This means that extensive purchases were made when prices were still low in anticipation of the subsequent rise. We notice that $500,000 was written off from cost of property, for discount on bonds sold, the credit balance to profit and loss being correspondingly reduced. This is a conservative step. The report discusses the various new acquisitions, particularly the San Francisco & San Joaquin Valley Railway. russian ceo ps, finances and railways:^ owners. Hence, judging from the undeniable scarcity of money, the question arises whether or no our means of circulation are altogether sufficiently numerous and wheiher the Minister of Finance, in bis ardent desire to transform our inconvertible paper- currency of former times into a currency resting on a solid basis of gold, did not shoot beyond the mark in withdrawing from circulation more paper money than he wished or was able to replace simultaneously by an equal amount of gold coins. At present our gold long time as to the probable results of this year's harvest; but, according to recent information, drawn from official sources, a decided improvement has set in during the last couple of months, so that a wheat crop of about the average may reasonably be expected. In some districts, especially so on the banks of the Volga and in Poland, the expectations are very favorable, although harvesting is still a good way off. A few days ago the official rate of the Imperial Bank for discounting three-months acceptances^was raised Commnnlcated by a Special Correspondent at St. Petenbor^. is esti- mated at about 400 millions of roubles, to which amount all notes in circulation have to be added, for, as pointed out above, our notes are not only entirely covered by the Government's holdings of gold, but there still remains over and above a very substantial reserve of the precious metal in the hands of the Government. This is a state of things that compares singularly with the issuing practice of all other issuing banks in existence; for with us notes are not created Petersburg, August 22, 1899. Rather unfavorable rumors have been afloat for a or withdrawn, owing St. circulation known to market requirements, but are to serve now-a-days the only purpose of taking the place of gold coins for the sake of greater convenience and simultaneously reducing expenses when money has to be sent from one place to another. The St. Petersburg and Moscow bourses were most seriously excited at two different occasions during the last few weeks. First, when it became known that the firm P. P. von Dervis had suspended pay- ment, and second when another formerly very wealthy concern, S. Mamontow, had to be declared bankrupt. The circumstances, however, under which THE (mRONICLE. 622 the two firms suspended payment are widely different, owing to unlucky specufor while the Mamontows lation have lost everything, the assets in the Dervis roubles, against failure are valued at 32 million which liabilities stand with only about 26 million — — roubles. The von Dervis failure was chiefly brought about by the fact that the firm, after having acquired very substantial holdings in a great many industrial undertakings, one fine day found itself neither to possess enough ready money nor to have any fresh credit offered to it, in order effectually to continue its various industrial interests. However, it cannot be denied that the condition of our industry in general is a highly satisfactory one, and that owing to the prosperous state of trade all over the world good results may reasonably be exOur furnaces are hardly able to meet the pected. enlarged demand for pig-iron, and the produce of the numerous petroleum ventures on the Caspian sea is marketed at, on an average, altogether very remunerative prices. At present our prominent naphtha producers are studying the question by the aid of which expedients our naphtha exports abroad, especially to Germany, as to the most important [Vol. LXIX. through Siberia, may indeed prove very slow before yielding any appreciable retura. For instance, doubts are entertained whether the nature of our possessions in Asia is in reality similar to that of certain parts of the United States. It is true of course that the parts of the United States to which allusion is thus made (namely, the West, where agriculture is now in a most flourishing state) owe their actual condition solely to their having been opened up in time by means of railroads. But to point to one difference only it must be confessed that our provinces in Asia are far from commanding a population which, regarding their standard of education and even their individual capital, may be compared with the immigrants into the Western States of America. For with us, to put it broadly, only those peasant families decide upon emigration who have lost (in many cases owing to their own carelessness) everything at home, and who, when arrived in Asia, as regards the lines — — are obliged continually to resort to the Government for help.

It appears from the statements of New York bankers who attended the conference that the consultation was important and likely to have a decided influence upon the check-collection policy of the banks in clearing houses throughout the country. Though the New York Clearing-House Association did not formally appoint delegates to the conference, having already established a check-collection system, it was thought proper to delegate a representative of the association to fully explain at the conference the New York system. To this end Mr. James G. Cannon, Vice-President of the Fourth National Bank of this city, was authorized to represent Mr. William A. Nash, Chairman of the Clearing-House Committee. This, as the sequel showed, was a wise selection, Mr. Cannon being thoroughly familiar with the details of the New York check-collection system. There were present at the conference representatives from twenty three out of thirty-one clearing-house associations which had been invited, and the only important body not represented was the Philadelphia organization. Previous to the formal conference, Mr. Cannon discussed the matter with prominent delegates to the conference, and he found that there was quite a general consensus of opinion in favor of the New York plan, and he was requested fully to explain this plan before the conference. The first important action taken at the conference was the adoption of the following resolution, noted in this column two weeks ago, offered by Mr. George Qugenberger.

Business on the Stock Exchange this week has been brought almost to a standstill by the arrest of a British editor at Johannesburg and an attempt at an arrest of several other prominent Uitlanders. and by the announcement that a Cabinet Council was called for yesterday. Parliament broke up barely a month ago, and Ministers dispersed for a much-needed holiday. It has been the custom always hitherto not to call Cabinet Councils during September. Very rarely have they been held in October. Usually they do not begin till NovemThe calling together, then, of a Cabinet Council so early as September 8 has naturally been regarded everywhere as a sign that the Transvaal crisis had become so grave that ber. was necessary to take the opinion of Ministers upon it. be recollected that Sir A. Milner at Bloemfontein suggested that a five-years' franchise to Uitlanders would be a reasonable basis for a settlement of all the questions outstanding between the Transvaal and this country. President Kruger refused on the ground that five years would let in so many British residents that the Government would be transferred from the Boers to the British. The Conference, therefore, broke up. But immediately afterwards, under pressure from the Orange Free State and the Dutch Party in Cape Colony, the Transvaal granted a seven-years' fraachise. They, however, accompanied it with so many conditions, that it has been asserted that practically no British subject would find it possible to naturalize. Mr. Chamberlain then suggested that a joint Committee should be appointed by the two governments to ic quire whether, as a matter of fact, the conditions were objectionable or not. But President Kruger evaded a direct answer to the suggestion and offered instead a five-years' franchise provided this country gave up its claim to suzerainty over the Transvaal. Mr. Chamberlain it It will refused the condition. The 625 doing in the American market, but it is by members of the Stock Exchange and professional operators, the great public holding quite aloof. In the South African mining market and in the Western Australian mining market there has been a sharp fall this week, and in all other departments there is practically nothing doing. In the money market short loans are in small demand and the rate of interest is very low. But, on the other hand, the discount rate in the open market is hardening, bankers being unwilliag to take bills just now. The opinion seems to be growing in the money market that the stringency in Germany this autumn will not be so great as hitherto has been anticipated. Germany has been able to obtain considerable supplies from the United States, from this country and from France, and besides the placing of a considerable proportion of the Mexican converted debt in New York has transferred a good deal of money to Germany. Before conversion the debt was held principally in Germany. Now that the United States has taken so much of it, a certain number of the old German holders have to be paid off, and that strengthens the Imperial Bank. How far all this reasoning is correct, the event alone will show. It is to be recollected that there is a great lock-up of capital in industrial companies, and indeed in all kinds of new ventures, and that trade is wonderfully active. There is the same activity and the same demand for money in the Scandinavian countries and in Finland; while in Russia the stringency in Germany has withdrawn a very large proportion of German capital formerly employed in that country, and its place has not been taken, or at least has not been fully taken, either by French or by British capital. That is one reason of the serious failure in St. Petersburg a couple of months ago, which has involved St. Petersburg and the Moscow banks in difficulties and has led to a great fall upon the Stock Exchange. Whether St. Petersburg or Moscow will be able to obtain accommodation in Berlin remains to be seen. It is certain that they are trying to get it at present. If they do that, there would be a fresh drain upon the money market and it might send up rates very considerably. In France business is held in check by the Dreyfus affair and all the other affairs that have sprung out of it, and the Bank of France is pursuing a very cautious policy. Whether there will be a demand for gold for the United States you are in a better position to judge than any one can be here. The general impression here is that probably some gold will be taken. It is not now thought likely that much gold will be sent to either India or Japan bnt of course the usual demand will have to be met from Egypt, Argentina or such countries. If a large British force has to be sent out to South Africa, it is likewise certain that gold will have to be remitted therefor; while if military operations begin, the export of gold from the Transvaal may be stopped for a time and thus the London supplies may be cut off. Upon the whole, the impression here is that for the next two or three months we may expect at any moment a considerable stringency in the market. The India Council continues to sell its drafts wonderfully well. It offered for tender on Wednesday 40 lacs, and the applications exceeded 1,433 lacs. The whole amount offered was sold at prices ranging from Is. 4d. to Is. 4 l-32d. per rupee. Subsequently a small amount was sold by private contract. Next week the amount to be offered will be raised to fiO lacs. The following return shows the position of the Bank of England, the Bank rate of discount, the price of consols, ftc, compared with the last three years: ; and now Mr. Chamberlain asks that a Conference should be held between delegates appointed by the two governments to consider the whole question of whether the new franchise is satisfactory or not. Evidently Mr. Chamberlain wishes that President Kruger should go to Capetown, that the conference between himself and Sir A. Milner should there be renewed, and that a final settlement should be made to secure peace. Apparently, therefore. President Kruger is very unwilling to leave the Transvaal, and he has sent an answer which neither accepts nor refuses the conference. His language seems to imply that he accepts it in principle. But the language does not bind him even to that much. At the same time, he asks for information as to the composition of the conference and where it is to be held. In all probability the information will be given. But it is very likely at the same time that a therefore, been withdrawn, time will be fixed for a definite atswer, either negative or affirmative, so that the negotiations should not be protracted beyond all reason. So far as the public is informer', then, here the matter stands. But the leading Uitlanders are flying from Johannesburg in immense numbers. One British editor there has been arrested on a charge of high treason, another has fled to escape the same fate, and the Boers are importing arms and ammunition, and are preparing in every possible way for war; while the people of Natal have called upon the Imperial Government to strengthen the garrison, evidently fearing a Boer attack. In the meantime it is understood that the Indian Government is prepared to send at a moment's notice 10,000 British troops from India, and it is said that 20,000 men here at home could be embarked within a week. That would make about 30,000 men; while there are in Cape Colony and Natal already, without counting armed police or colonial volunteers, about 10,000 regular troops. The result of all is that for the time being business on the Stock Exchange is quite paralyzed.
