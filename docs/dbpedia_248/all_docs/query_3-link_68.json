        "text": "History | Foundation | Finnish War | Town fire | New town | Capital of Finland | Post-war | Economy | Transport | Culture | Sport | Education\n\nðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® Vaasa is a city on the west coast of Finland. It received its charter in 1606, during the reign of Charles IX of Sweden and is named after the Royal House of Vasa. Vaasa is the regional capital of Ostrobothnia. Vaasa is also well-known as a major university and college city in Finland.\n\nThe city is bilingual with 69.8% of the population speaking Finnish as their first language and 24.8% speaking Swedish. The surrounding Ostrobothnian municipalities (such as Korsholm and Malax) have a clear Swedish-speaking majority, which is why the Swedish language maintains a strong position in the city, making it the most significant cultural centre for Swedish-Finns.\n\nVaasa is also known for Tropiclandia Water Park, which is located in the Vaskiluoto Island right next to a local spa hotel. In the immediate vicinity of Tropiclandia was the now deserted Wasalandia Amusement Park, which ceased operations in 2015 due to a small number of visitors.\n\n1\n\nHistory Over the years, Vaasa has changed its name several times, due to alternative spellings, political decisions and language condition changes. At first it was called Mustasaari or Mussor after the village where it was founded in 1606, but just a few years later the name was changed to Vasa to honor the royal Swedish lineage. Mustasaari (Finnish) or Korsholm (Swedish) remains as the name of the surrounding mostly rural municipality, which since 1973 surrounds the city. The city was known as Vasa between 1606 and 1855, Nikolajstad (Swedish) and Nikolainkaupunki (Finnish) between 1855 and 1917, named after the then late Czar Nicholas I of Russia, Vasa (Swedish) and Vaasa (Finnish) after the February revolution, with the Finnish spelling of the name being the primary one from around 1930 when Finnish speakers became the majority in the city.\n\n1\n\nFoundation The history of Korsholm and also of Vaasa begins in the 14th century, when seafarers from the coastal region in central Sweden disembarked at the present Old Vaasa, and the wasteland owners from Southwest Finland came to guard their land.\n\nIn the middle of the century, Saint Mary's Church was built, and in the 1370s the building of the fortress at Korsholm, Crysseborgh, was undertaken, and served as an administrative centre of the Vasa County. King Charles IX of Sweden founded the town of Mustasaari/Mussor on 2 October 1606, around the oldest harbour and trade point around the Korsholm church approximately seven km (4.3 miles) to the south-east from the present city. In 1611, the town was chartered and renamed after the Royal House of Vasa.\n\nThanks to the sea connections, ship building and trade, especially tar trade, Vaasa flourished in the 17th century and most of the inhabitants earned their living from it.\n\nIn 1683, the three-subject or Trivial school moved from Nykarleby to Vaasa, and four years later a new schoolhouse was built in Vaasa. The first library in Finland was founded in Vaasa in 1794. In 1793, Vaasa had 2,178 inhabitants, and in the year of the catastrophic town fire of 1852 the number had risen to 3,200.\n\n1\n\nFinnish War During the Finnish War, fought between Sweden and Russia in 1808â€“1809, Vaasa suffered more than any other city. In June 1808, Vaasa was occupied by the Russian forces, and some of the local officials pledged allegiance to the occupying force.\n\nOn 25 June 1808 the Swedish colonel Johan BergenstrÃ¥hle was sent with 1,500 troops and four cannons to free Vaasa from the 1,700 Russian troops who were led by generalmajor Nikolay Demidov. The Battle of Vaasa started with the Swedish force disembarking north of Vaasa in Ã–sterhankmo and advancing all the way to the city where they attacked with 1,100 troops, as some had to be left behind to secure the flank. There was heavy fighting in the streets and in the end the Swedish forces were repelled and forced to retreat back the way they came.\n\nGeneralmajor Demidov suspected that the inhabitants of Vaasa had taken to arms and helped the Swedish forces, even though the provincial governor had confiscated all weapons that spring, and he took revenge by letting his men plunder the city for several days. During those days 17 civilians were killed, property was looted and destroyed, many were assaulted and several people were taken to the village of Salmi in Kuortane where they had to endure the physical punishment called running the gauntlet. The massacre in Vaasa was exceptional during the Finnish war as the Russian forces had avoided that kind of cruelty that far. It was probably a result of the frustration the Russians felt because of intensive guerilla activity against them in the region.\n\nOn 30 June the Russian forces withdrew from Vaasa, and all officials that had pledged allegiance to Russia were discharged, and some were assaulted by locals. On 13 September the Russian forces returned and on the next day the decisive Battle of Oravais, which was won by Russia, was fought some 50 km (30 mi) further north. By winter 1808, the Russian forces had overrun all of Finland, and in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn (17 September 1809) Sweden lost the whole eastern part of its realm. Vaasa would now become a part of the newly formed Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire.\n\n1\n\nTown fire The mainly wooden and densely built town was almost utterly destroyed in 1852. A fire started in a barn belonging to district court judge J. F. AurÃ©n on the morning of 3 August. At noon the whole town was ablaze and the fire lasted for many hours. By evening, most of the town had burned to the ground. Out of 379 buildings only 24 privately owned buildings had survived, among them the Falanderâ€“Wasastjerna patrician house (built in 1780â€“1781) which now houses the Old Vaasa Museum.\n\nThe Court of Appeal (built in 1775, nowadays the Church of Korsholm), some Russian guard-houses along with a gunpowder storage and the buildings of the Vaasa provincial hospital (nowadays a psychiatric hospital) also survived the blaze. The ruins of the greystone church, the belfry, the town hall and the trivial school can still be found in their original places. Much of the archived material concerning Vaasa and its inhabitants was destroyed in the fire. According to popular belief, the fire got started when a careless visitor from VÃ¶rÃ¥ fell asleep in AurÃ©n's barn and dropped his pipe in the dry hay.\n\n1\n\nNew town The new town of Nikolaistad (Finnish: Nikolainkaupunki), named after the late Tsar Nicholas I, rose in 1862 about seven km (4.3 miles) to the north-west from the old town. The town's coastal location offered good conditions for seafaring. The town plan was planned by Carl Axel Setterberg in the Empire style. In the master plan the disastrous consequences of the fire were considered. Main streets in the new town were five broad avenues which divided the town into sections. Each block was divided by alleys.\n\nThe town was promptly renamed Vasa (Vaasa) after the Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown in 1917.\n\n1\n\nCapital of Finland During the Finnish Civil War, Vaasa was the capital of Finland from 29 January to 3 May 1918. As a consequence of the occupation of central places and arresting of politicians in Helsinki the Senate decided to move the senators to Vaasa, where the White Guards that supported the Senate had a strong position and the contacts to the West were good.\n\nThe Senate of Finland began its work in Vaasa on 1 February 1918, and it had four members. The Senate held its sessions in the Town Hall. To express its gratitude to the town the Senate gave Vaasa the right to add the Cross of Freedom, independent Finland's oldest mark of honour designed by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, to its coat of arms, to the town's coat of arms. The coat of arms is unusual not only in this respect, but also because of its non-standard shape and a crown are included. Because of its role in the civil war, Vaasa became known as \"The White City\". A Statue of Freedom, depicting a victorious White soldier, was erected in the town square.\n\n1\n\nPost-war The language conditions in the city shifted in the 1930s, and the majority became Finnish-speaking. Therefore, the primary name also changed from \"Vasa\" to \"Vaasa\", according to Finnish spelling.\n\nPost-war, Vaasa was industrialized, led by the electronics manufacturer StrÃ¶mberg, later merged into ABB.\n\nIn 2013 the municipality of VÃ¤hÃ¤kyrÃ¶ was merged into Vaasa. It is currently an exclave area of the city, since it is surrounded by other municipalities.\n\n1\n\nEconomy Vaasa is generally speaking an industrial town, with several industrial parks. Industry comprises one-fourth of jobs. There is a university (University of Vaasa), faculties of Ã…bo Akademi and Hanken, and two universities of applied sciences in the town. Many workers commute from Korsholm, Laihia, and other municipalities nearby. The Vaskiluoto power stations complex is situated on the island of Vaskiluoto, supplying electricity to the national grid as well as district heat to the city. The multi-use cargo and passenger Port of Vaasa is located in Vaskiluoto, connecting Vaasa with UmeÃ¥, Sweden, and destinations further afield. The film production company Future Film has its head office in Vaasa. Kotipizza has its head office in the Vaskiluodon Satamaterminaali.\n\n1\n\nTransport Main roads, including highway 3 (E12) and highway 8 (E8), connect Vaasa to Helsinki, Tampere, Oulu, Pori, JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Kokkola and SeinÃ¤joki. There are 419 km (260 mi) from Helsinki to Vaasa, 330 km (210 mi) from Turku, 244 km (152 mi) from Tampere, 319 km (198 mi) from Oulu, 121 km (75 mi) from Kokkola, 99 km (62 mi) from Jakobstad, 193 km (120 mi) from Pori, 83 km (52 mi) from Lapua and 78 km (48 mi) from SeinÃ¤joki. It is also a relatively short distance from Sweden to Vaasa. The tourist route called Blue Highway also runs from the port of Vaasa and through the city. In 1962â€“1964, other Finnish cities introduced regional speed limits of 50 km/h, but in Vaasa the limit was 60 km/h for a long time.\n\nVaasa Airport is located about nine km south-east of the city center. Finnair and Scandinavian Airlines operate from Vaasa Airport, but Norwegian Air Shuttle terminated the Vaasaâ€“Helsinki route on 10 January 2020. There is scheduled traffic from Vaasa Airport to Helsinki (flight time 45 min) and Stockholm (flight time 1 h 5 min).\n\n1\n\nCulture â€¢ Ostrobothnian Museum â€¢ Terranova Museum â€¢ Meteoriihi â€¢ Kuntsi Museum of Modern Art â€¢ Vaasa Car & Motor Museum â€¢ Platform, artist run gallery for contemporary art, media art, & sound art\n\nOther sights â€¢ The Statue of Liberty (Suomen Vapaudenpatsas)\n\n1\n\nSport â€¢ Vaasan Sport, men's ice hockey team playing in the Liiga, home ice is Vaasan SÃ¤hkÃ¶ Areena â€¢ Mailattaret, Vaasa, a women's Finnish baseball team playing in the Superpesis. â€¢ Vaasan Sport Naiset, women's ice hockey team playing in the Naisten Liiga, home ice is Vaasan SÃ¤hkÃ¶ Areena â€¢ Vaasan Palloseura, men's football club playing in the YkkÃ¶nen, home ground is Hietalahti Stadium â€¢ Vasa IFK, men's football club playing in the Kakkonen, home ground is Hietalahti Stadium â€¢ FC Kiisto, men's football club playing in the Kolmonen, home ground is Kaarlen kenttÃ¤ â€¢ Vaasa Rugby Club â—¦ Vaasa Wolves, inactive men's rugby union team, played in the Finnish Championship Rugby League until 2019 â—¦ Vaasa Foxes, women's rugby sevens team playing in the Finnish Championship 7's Series\n\n1\n\nEducation Vaasa has three universities. The largest one is the University of Vaasa, which is located in the neighbourhood of Palosaari. Palosaari is a peninsula near the centre of Vaasa, connected to it by bridges. The other two universities are Ã…bo Akademi, headquartered in Turku, and the Hanken School of Economics headquartered in Helsinki. Unique to Vaasa is the Finland-Swedish teachers training school Vasa Ã¶vningsskola, part of Ã…bo Akademi. The University of Helsinki also has a small unit, specialized in law studies, in the city centre.\n\nThe city has two universities of applied sciences: Vaasa University of Applied Sciences (former Vaasa Polytechnic), located right next to the University of Vaasa, and Novia University of Applied Sciences (former Swedish University of Applied Sciences).\n\nCity has about 13,000 university students and about 4,000 vocational school students.\n\n1"
