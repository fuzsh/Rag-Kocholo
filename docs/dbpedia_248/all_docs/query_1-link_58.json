The population consists of 65% Finnish speakers, 23% Swedish speakers, and 12% speakers of other languages.[6] The municipalities surrounding Ostrobothnia, such as Korsholm and Malax, have a clear majority of Swedish speakers. As a result, the Swedish language maintains a strong position in the city, making it the most significant cultural center for Swedish-Finns.[9][10][11]"
