        "text": "In heavy snowfall and tough conditions Petter Eliassen, Team Ragde Eiedom, and Lina Korsgren, Team Ramudden, won the 90 km long Vasaloppet. Eliassen passed Stian Hoelgaard, Team Koteng, in the last few meters winning Vasaloppet for the second time with a winning margin of one second. The winning time was 4.25,14.\n\nLina Korsgren skied to a big victory in the women’s class winning in 4.41,02 and 57th place in total of the race. Korsgren was more than six minutes ahead of Britta Johansson Norgren, Lager 157 Ski Team.\n\n13,900 skiers started in Sälen to ski to Mora in the 96th race since 1922.\n\nThe weekend had stunned the thousands of people present in the area for the race with perfect snow and sunshine, with Italian-like weather and temperatures right below zero.\n\nIn the night before the race has started to fall, covering the track with a soft white layer, in conditions that almost reminded last year’s ones, letting all racers face a tougher race.\n\nHaving a look into the race (Visma Ski Classics report):\n\n“I’m really glad for the victory. In the end, I tried to stay behind and then come with more speed at the finish,” says Eliassen.\n\n“I had an amazing day and amazing skis,” says Korsgren.\n\nIn the men’s race Morten Eide Pedersen, Team Kaffebryggeriet, and Andreas Holmberg, Lager 157 Ski Team, set the pace from start and Pedersen was four-tenths of a second ahead of Holmberg at the climb point after 3 km.\n\nTowards Smågan nine athletes got a gap with high speed despite the snowy conditions. They continued to go fast and the group contained athletes like Joar Andreas Thele, Team Ragde Eiendom, Viktor Mäenpää, Team Mäenpää, Øystein Pettersen and Stian Berg, Team Kaffebryggeriet, and Andreas Holmberg, Lager 157 Ski Team. Berg was first at the sprint point at Mångsbodarna after 24 km a second ahead of Thele. A big group of chasers was 47 seconds behind.\n\nTorleif Syrstad, Team Koteng, together with Alexander Panshinskiy, Team Robinson Trentino, made a move and catch the leading group after Mångsbodarna.\n\nAt the control point in Risberg after 34 km the leading group had extended the lead to the following group to one minute and 45 seconds.\n\nAt the sprint in Evertsberg at 47 km Stian Berg was first again and followed by six athletes: Syrstad, Pettersen, Holmberg, Mäenpää and Thele. The big group with Petter Eliassen, Team Ragde Eiendom, in front, was three and a half minutes behind.\n\nThele and Pettersen then pushed hard at “Lundbäcksbackarna” towards Oxberg and was follwed by Syrstad, Holmberg, Mäenpää and Berg. Pettersen and Syrstad fell just before the control and Thele got a small gap out from Oxberg with 28 km to go. Petter Eliassen and Stian Hoelgaard, Team Koteng, was almost catching up the leading group.\n\nSoon after that Eliassen, Hoelgaard, Thele and Syrstad got a gap. With about 20 km to the finish, Eliassen and Hoelgaard moved away from the other two. The margin to Thele was 38 seconds and the big group was a minute behind at Hökberg with 19 km to go.\n\nAt the last control in Eldris with 9 km to the finish Eliassen and Hoelgaard had a margin of 37 seconds to three following athletes: Klas Nilsson, Team Igne, Torleif Syrstad, Team Koteng, and Tord Asle Gjerdalen, Team Ragde Eiendom. The big group was two minutes and 18 seconds behind.\n\nEliassen and Hoelgaard could stay away from the followers and at the finish in Mora Eliassen had more power in the last meters passing Hoelgaard. This was Eliassens second victory in Vasaloppet. He also won in 2015.\n\n“The race was a lot like last year. It was hard in the front with a small group. But I tried to stay in front and work hard. Then in the last part I tried to stay cool,” says Petter Eliassen.\n\nIt was tough for Hoelgaard who has been top three the last four years in Vasaloppet.\n\n“The last 40 km was hard. Petter and I worked hard together. But then the finish was not so good for me,” says Stian Hoelgaard.\n\nThe women\n\nIn the women’s race Lina Korsgren, Team Ramudden, made a good start and was 35 seconds ahead of Britta Johansson Norgren at the climb point after 3,2 km. Korsgren stayed ahead of Johansson Norgren but at Mångsbodarna the margin was only 12 seconds and they were in the big second group in the field.\n\nKorsgren and Johansson Norgren stayed together passing Risberg and Evertsberg with Korsgren in front at the control stations. Katerina Smutná, Ed System Bauer Team, was third but more than three minutes behind and followed by Ida Dahl only 16 seconds after.\n\nKorsgren was really strong in the uphills towards Oxberg passing in 67th position and with a lead of two minutes and 20 seconds ahead of Johansson Norgren. At Hökberg Korsgren’s lead was four minutes and 16 seconds.\n\nKorsgren just increased the distance to Johansson Norgren winning by six minutes and 9 seconds.\n\n“I was surprised I got such a good start of the race. Then when I got a gap to Britta I understand it was my day,” says Lina Korsgren.\n\nLina set a record today finishing 57th in total of the race.\n\n“It´s good that we show that we girls are strong,” says Korsgren.\n\n“There was not a perfect day for me and Lina was so strong,” Johansson Norgren says.\n\n“It felt good until Evertsberg but then I had to dig deep”, Britta continues.\n\nRESULTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM\n\nRESULTS Vasaloppet 2020, men\n\n1 Petter Eliassen, (NOR), 4.25.14\n\n2 Stian Hoelgaard, (NOR), 4.25.15\n\n3 Torleif Syrstad, (NOR), 4.25.57\n\n4 Tord Asle Gjerdalen, (NOR), 4.26.02\n\n5 Klas Nilsson, (SWE), Skellefteå XC Club, 4.26.13\n\n6 Andreas Nygaard, (NOR), 4.28.31\n\n7 Nils Persson, (SWE), Östersunds SK, 4.28.32\n\n8 Anders Aukland, (NOR), 4.28.34\n\n9 Max Novak, (SWE), Offerdals SK, 4.28.34\n\n10 Simen Engebretsen Nordli, (NOR), 4.28.35\n\nRESULTS Vasaloppet 2020, women\n\n1 Lina Korsgren, (SWE), Åre Längdskidklubb, 4.41.02\n\n2 Britta Johansson Norgren, (SWE), Sollefteå Skidor IF, 4.47.11\n\n3 Katerina Smutna, (CZE), 4.49.25\n\n4 Ida Dahl, (SWE), IFK Mora SK, 4.50.50\n\n5 Kari Vikhagen Gjeitnes, (NOR), 4.51.25\n\n6 Laila Kveli, (NOR), 4.53.19\n\n7 Thea Krokan Murud, (NOR), 4.53.25\n\n8 Jenny Larsson, (SWE), Östersunds SK, 4.57.57\n\n9 Emilie Fleten, (NOR), 4.58.33\n\n10 Heli Heiskanen, (FIN), 5.08.54\n\nAchievement medal times\n\nMedal time for men, cut off: 14.37.52/ Time: 6.37.52\n\nMedal time for women, cut off: 15.01.33/ Time: 7.01.33\n\nSkiers who complete the race in the winning time plus 50 % receive an achievement medal.\n\nSveriges Television\n\nWatch Sveriges Television’s archived live broadcast of Vasaloppet.
