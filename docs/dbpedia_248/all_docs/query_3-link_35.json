        "text": "In the past years Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has emerged as a novel form of user-generated content, which involves active generation of geo-data for example in citizen science projects or during crisis mapping as well as the passive collection of data via the user’s location-enabled mobile devices. In addition there are more and more sensors available that detect our environment with ever greater detail and dynamics. These data can be used for a variety of applications, not only for the solution of societal tasks such as in environment, health or transport fields, but also for the development of commercial products and services. The interpretation, visualisation and usage of such multi-source data is challenging because of the large heterogeneity, the differences in quality, the high update frequencies, the varying spatial-temporal resolution, subjective characteristics and low semantic structuring. Therefore the German Research Foundation has launched a priority programme for the next 3–6 years which will support interdisciplinary research projects. This priority programme aims to provide a scientific basis for raising the potential of VGI- and sensor data. Research questions described more in detail in this short paper span from the extraction of spatial information, to the visual analysis and knowledge presentation, taking into account the social context while collecting and using VGI.\n\nMartin Knura\n\n·\n\nJochen Schiewe\n\nVolunteered geographic information is often generated as voluminous point data, leading to geometric and thematic clutter when presented on maps. To solve these clutter problems, cartography provides various point generalization operations such as aggregation, simplification or selection. While these operations reduce the total number of points and therefore improve the readability, information preservation could be harmed when specific spatial patterns disappear through the generalization process, possibly leading to false interpretations. However, sets of map generalization constraints that maintain spatial pattern characteristics of point data are still missing. To define constraints that support synoptic interpretation tasks, user behaviour while solving these tasks has to be analysed first. We conduct a study where participants have to perform such interpretation tasks, using a new method that combines think-aloud interviews and techniques from visual analytics. We reveal that the point density of a dataset has the biggest impact on the user behaviour and the respective task-solving strategy, independently from the actual task type executed. Furthermore, our results show that the graphical map complexity only has a minor impact on the user behaviour, and there is no evidence that point data cardinality influences task execution and the solution-finding strategies.\n\nView\n\nAlexander Dunkel\n\n·\n\nDirk Burghardt\n\nThe exponential growth of user-contributed data provides a comprehensive basis for assessing collective perceptions of landscape change. A variety of possible public data sources exist, such as geospatial data from social media or volunteered geographic information (VGI). Key challenges with such “opportunistic” data sampling are variability in platform popularity and bias due to changing user groups and contribution rules. In this study, we use five case studies to demonstrate how intra- and inter-dataset comparisons can help to assess the temporality of landscape scenic resources, such as identifying seasonal characteristics for a given area or testing hypotheses about shifting popularity trends observed in the field. By focusing on the consistency and reproducibility of temporal patterns for selected scenic resources and comparisons across different dimensions of data, we aim to contribute to the development of systematic methods for disentangling the perceived impact of events and trends from other technological and social phenomena included in the data. The proposed techniques may help to draw attention to overlooked or underestimated patterns of landscape change, fill in missing data between periodic surveys, or corroborate and support field observations. Despite limitations, the results provide a comprehensive basis for developing indicators with a high degree of timeliness for monitoring perceived landscape change over time.\n\nView\n\nWe present \"wq\", an open-source framework for developing robust applications allowing volunteers to collect geographic information (VGI) in the field. Successful VGI applications been deployed in various contexts, but much of the effort that is put into common programming tasks cannot be re-used, often because the application code is too closely tied to the problem domain. User-friendly campaign authoring tools are being explored as ways to facilitate the rapid deployment of VGI applications, but many of these tools necessarily enforce a restricted vocabulary of interface elements and database models, limiting their usefulness for more complex VGI project workflows. In contrast, we propose a highly modular, open-source approach that enables reuse of general-purpose components created to facilitate common design patterns -- without enforcing any hard limitations on the database model or interface. The framework builds off of and extends numerous existing open-source projects and leverages open standards (e.g. HTML5), which means it will work across all popular mobile devices as well as desktop browsers. The ideas behind wq arose from our ongoing efforts to generalize an existing data collection application initially created for community-based stream quality monitoring. In this paper we justify the design decisions made in creating wq and suggest general principles that should be taken into consideration when designing systems for collecting, storing, and utilizing VGI.\n\nView"
