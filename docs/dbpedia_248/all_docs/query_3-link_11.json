        "text": "OGDEN, Utah (Oct. 10, 2017) – Portland State swept Player of the Week honors after two dramatic wins on the week. Katie Forsee contributed to all three PSU goals with two goals and an assist to earn the offensive honor. Abbie Faingold made eight saves over the two game span to pick up the Defensive Player of the Week award.\n\nAbbie Faingold denied eight shots on goal and only allowed a single goal in Portland State’s two wins on the weekend. Against Northern Arizona, Faingold didn’t allow a goal despite NAU putting pressure on the Portland State defense the entire second half. The Lumberjacks attempted eight shots with two being on goal and Faingold stopped both shots. The goalkeeper really shined versus Sacramento State on Sunday. The Hornets attempted 16 shots, seven on goal, during the match. After Sacramento State scored right before intermission, the redshirt-junior denied every shot attempt in the second half as Portland State came from behind to win a 2-1 thriller.\n\nKatie Forsee produced two game-winning goals on the weekend with the first one coming over Northern Arizona off of a penalty kick for the only goal of the match. In Sunday’s thriller versus Sacramento State, Forsee earned an assist after a Morgan Matthews goal tied the match in the middle of the second half. Minutes later Forsee scored the go-ahead goal to clinch the win for Portland State.\n\nForsee’s two goals over the weekend upped her total to eight goals on the season which leads the Big Sky. Additionally, the senior leads the conference with 19 points and ranks top-50 in the nation in both categories.\n\nWith the two wins Portland State is sitting in second alone in the Big Sky standings with 12 points. The Vikings are set to collide with first-place Eastern Washington (13 points) in Cheney, Wash. on Friday night before finishing out the weekend at Idaho.\n\nOther nominees:\n\nOffense: Emma Vanderhyden (EWU), Myah Merino (UI), Alexa Coyle (UM), Adrian Nixt (NAU), Caitlin Prothe (SAC), MaKenzie Lawrence (SUU)\n\nDefense: Emily Busselman (EWU), Makayla Presgrave (UI), Taryn Miller (UM), Taryn Benham (NAU), Kaylyn Evans (SAC), Kaitlyn Caldera (SUU)\n\nThe Placer United U.S. Soccer Girls Development Academy teams had a surprise visitor at training last night as newly hired U.S. Soccer Northwest Technical Advisor, Megan McCormick, was on hand to watch and evaluate the level of each training session, as well as scout for future potential National Youth team players.\n\n“The DA Technical Advisor is here to assist the leadership of all the Academy clubs by monitoring and enhancing the players daily training environments to ensure better player development. They will not only attend training sessions, but also competitive games looking to identify those players with the potential and desire to be part of a U.S. Soccer National team,” explained Paul O’Brien, Director of Soccer Operations.\n\n“Megan was really great,” said 04 Girls Academy Coach, Don Finley. “She spoke with all the girls about her current role within the U.S. Soccer and her previous experiences as a professional player and head college coach,” he said. “Megan asked all the players a few questions including if they have noticed any differences already within the Academy system, to which one of my girls replied, ‘Yes we have a U.S. Soccer national staff member at our training session.'”\n\nThe 03 Girls Academy Coach, Ron Benjamin added, “It’s things like this that will quickly help all the players realize they are in a high profile environment, as not only did Megan attend last night’s training session, but she will be at all the Placer United U.S. Soccer DA home games this weekend.”\n\nAbout the U.S. Soccer Girls Development Academy\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review of elite player development in the United States and around the world, U.S. Soccer created the Development Academy in 2007. The Academy Program’s philosophy is based on standards of increased training, less total games, and more meaningful games using international rules of competition. The U.S. Soccer Development Academy recently expanded programming to include the Girls’ Development Academy which began in September 2017.\n\nCHICAGO (Aug. 30, 2017) – Recognize to Recover, presented by Thorne, and ThinkTaylor are partnering during the opening weekends of the U.S. Soccer Girls’ and Boys’ Development Academy to educate more than 17,000 players about handling concussions in the sport.\n\nAs part of U.S. Soccer’s continued effort to promote safe play and reduce injuries in soccer players of all ages, the Concussion Awareness Week will take place from Sept. 2-10 and all 197 member clubs will take part in the campaign.\n\nPlayers will be encouraged to take the #TTPledge, which is an oath from athletes to be educated on concussion symptoms, to be honest in their self-evaluation and to be supportive of anyone with a concussion.\n\n“We’re looking forward to this partnership between Recognize to Recover and ThinkTaylor as we continue to connect with youth players across the United States about their health and safety,” said U.S. Soccer Chief Medical Officer George Chiampas. “An important part of managing concussions is making sure that players are educated on how to identify when a possible head injury occurs, and are empowered to inform their parents and coaches. We want to change the culture within the game around reporting concussions and that needs to start at an early age.”\n\nRecognize to Recover, a first-of-its-kind comprehensive program dedicated to safe play and reducing injuries, was launched by U.S Soccer in 2015. The program was developed with the help of medical experts to provide coaches, players, parents, referees with information, guidance and educational materials to improve the prevention and management of injuries.\n\nConcussion and head injury awareness and prevention are a core part of the program, and in 2016 U.S. Soccer released a new video designed to raise awareness of this important issue and highlight it throughout its coach and referee education programs.\n\nWATCH: Recognize to Recover Concussion Awareness Video\n\nThinkTaylor was founded in 2011 by former Men’s National Team player Taylor Twellman after he was forced to retire from professional soccer due to post-concussion syndrome (PCS). ThinkTaylor is dedicated to changing the culture of traumatic brain injuries and aims to dispel the notion of concussions as something to “shake off” or play through, and establish protocol of handling brain injuries with the utmost seriousness.\n\n“There were times in my career I wasn’t honest with my coaches, my parents, my teammates, and it only made things worse,” said Twellman. “When you recognize the signs and symptoms of a concussion and you do something about it, you are already on the road to recovery. That’s why it’s so important to me that athletes are educated and honest about concussions. We only have one brain and it needs to last a lifetime.”\n\nAs the 2017-2018 Development Academy season is set to kick off, Concussion Awareness Week is part of the Academy and U.S. Soccer’s continued commitment to the long-term health and safety of its players.\n\nCHICAGO (September 5, 2017) – The U.S. Under-15 Girls’ National Team and the U.S Under-14 Girls’ National Team will hold concurrent training camps from September 10-17 at the U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Carson, California.\n\nU.S. U-15 GNT head coach Tracey Kevins has called up 24 players, all born in 2003, for what will be her first camp at the helm of this age group.\n\nU.S. U-14 GNT head coach April Kater has called up 24 players, all born in 2004. This cycle for the U.S. U-14 GNT would generally begin in early 2018, but this camp gives next year’s U-14s a head start. For all but the few players who have been called into U-15 GNT training camps, this will be the first experience in a National Team training camp environment.\n\nThe teams will scrimmage against each other during the week.\n\nThis group of U-15 players is in the first year of a two-year cycle before transitioning to U-17s in 2019, when they will form the core of the team that will attempt to qualify for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup.\n\nU.S. U-15 GNT Roster by Position:\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Haley Craig (Hawks-Wolves SC; Dexter, Mich.), Isabella Grust (San Diego Surf; Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.)\n\nDEFENDERS (7): Baleigh Bruster (Tophat SC; Smyrna, Ga.), August Hunter (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.), Andrea Kitahata (San Jose Earthquakes; Hillsborough, Calif.), Phoenix Miranda (Leahi SC; Aiea, Hawaii), Ayo Oke (Concorde Fire; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Kellie Pagador (Placer United; Roseville, Calif.), Lilly Reale (South Shore Select; Hingham, Mass.)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Korbin Albert (Eclipse Select SC; Gurnee, Ill.), Colby Barnett (Strikers FC; Los Alamitos, Calif.), Summer Denigan (Cincinnati Development Academy; Union, Ky.), Emma Egizii (Beach FC; Downey, Calif.), Carina Lageyre (Weston SC; Cooper City, Fla.), Olivia Pena (Solar Chelsea; Irving, Texas), Isabella Piete (San Diego Surf; Alpine, Calif.),\n\nFORWARDS (7): Simone Jackson (Slammers FC; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Caetlyn Johannes (Valley Isle SA; Kihei, Hawaii), Arianna Manrique (Tophat SC; Buford, Ga.).

The Academy develops world-class players by impacting everyday club environments across the country. Following 10 years of success for the Boys’ Academy, the Girls’ Academy launches this fall to bring the development initiative to female youth players.\n\nA total of 108 games will kick off on opening weekend, highlighted by the Girls’ Academy’s first feature game in Somerset, N.J. between Sky Blue – PDA (Somerset, N.J.) and FC Virginia (Chantilly, Va.) in the U-16/17 age group (2002/2001 birth years). The game will be streamed live at 11 a.m. ET on the U.S. Soccer Development Academy Facebook Page .\n\n“In support of U.S. Soccer’s long-term plan for player and coach development, launching a Girls’ Development Academy is part of an unprecedented commitment to elevating the women’s game,” said U.S. Soccer Women’s Technical Director April Heinrichs. “This program will directly impact the everyday environment for clubs and further connect players and coaches to our National Teams.”\n\nThe Girls’ Academy is the highest level of girls’ youth soccer in the U.S., and its start represents the implementation of the Academy’s philosophy and standards for the most committed youth clubs across the country. Academy clubs have an increased focus on training (minimum four training sessions per week) and play fewer total games in favor of more meaningful contests using international standards. The program prioritizes individual development ahead of winning team trophies and titles.\n\nA U.S. Soccer player development initiative, the Academy provides direct access to the Federation’s resources. Clubs receive a wealth of support with coaching education, scholarship funding, Academy staff dedicated to serving clubs, and support from Academy Technical Advisors that reside and work in club markets.\n\nIt also provides a clear pathway to National Team programs. More than 92 percent of players selected to Youth National Teams in the 2016-17 cycle came from Academy clubs, and 65 players from the most recent Women’s and Girls’ YNT roster call-ups will feature in the Academy this season.\n\n“The U.S. Soccer Girls’ Development Academy program will raise the standards and assure that the pathway for the most talented and dedicated female players exists, and that we will be able to continue to compete with the elite players and teams in the world,” Girls’ Academy Director Miriam Hickey said. “To achieve this, we must commit to a positive training and game environment at the club level to ensure the best players are playing together and not one talented player is overlooked.”\n\nA global leader in women’s soccer, U.S. Soccer’s implementation of the Girls’ Academy is part of the Federation’s efforts to grow the game and ensure that future National Teams continue to win at the highest level. Several current and former Women’s National Team players are involved in the Academy to further this mission. Their experiences winning FIFA Women’s World Cups and Olympic gold medals will be invaluable in raising the standard for female youth players.\n\nU.S. Soccer is launching the Girls’ Academy with backing from the National Women’s Soccer League . Now in its fifth year, the league is the longest-tenured women’s professional league ever in the United States. A total of 11 Girls’ Academy clubs are affiliated with NWSL teams, marking a major step forward in the league’s player development initiatives and the long-term growth of women’s professional soccer.\n\nFor its first season, the Girls’ Academy will feature four age groups: U-14, U-15, U-16/17 and U-18/19 competing in seven divisions across the country. Teams play consistently over a 10-month season from September to July, featuring Winter, Spring and Summer Showcases and culminating in the Academy Championships. The inaugural 69 clubs were chosen based on a variety of factors, including club leadership, infrastructure, resources, history of player production for National Teams, market and depth of the player pool and more.\n\nFor more information on the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, please visit ussoccerda.com .\n\nPlacer Adds Bashar Abduljalil to Coaching Staff\n\nIn our continuing effort to raise the standard and level of our coaching staff, Placer United is proud to announce the hiring of former Al Ain FC goalkeeper coach and game analysis coach, Bashar Abduljalil.
