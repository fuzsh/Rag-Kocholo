Ida Dahl won the first two races!\n\nNEXT YEAR: Registration for Vasaloppet March 5, 2023 opens on Sunday, March 27, 2022\n\nWEBSITE: vasaloppet.se\n\nHistory\n\nGustav Eriksson’s adventure in Dalarna took place during the winter of 1520–21. In 1523 he was elected King of Sweden. The first Vasaloppet took place in 1922. This year will see the 98th Vasaloppet, which is also the 26th with a special competition class for women (started in 1997). Three races have been cancelled: 1932, 1934 and 1990. Since 1948 the race has always run on the first Sunday of March, except in 2015 when the race ran on the second Sunday because of the World Ski Championships in Falun.\n\nThe first live TV broadcast of Vasaloppet took place in 1966. This will be the 45th time that Vasaloppet (in part or in its entirety) is transmitted live, and it’s the 40th time that the Vasaloppet start is broadcast live on television. 1973 was the first year with a live broadcast in colour. Since 1992 Vasaloppet has been shown live every year.\n\nIn 2021, Vasaloppet ran as two elite competitions with 73 starting women and 245 men. Fast and icy surfaces and a strong tailwind contributed to record times. Norway beat Sweden among the men and Sweden beat Norway among the women: Tord Asle Gjerdalen won ahead of Anton Karlsson with the new record time of 3.28.18. The women also got a new record time when Lina Korsgren with 3.52.08 took her third Vasaloppet victory. Marit Bjørgen came second in her comeback after a three-year hiatus.\n\nSince 1922 a total of 600,421 Vasaloppet skiers have completed the 90-kilometre Vasaloppet; put together they have covered a distance equal to 1,348 round the world trips or 70 journeys to the moon and back. The average finishing time for the 600,421 participants can be counted as 7.58.27 (average) or 7.54.13 (median).\n\nThe average skier 2022\n\nIn Vasaloppet 2022, the average age is 44.1 and the average participant has skied Vasaloppet 4 times before.\n\nOf the registered Vasaloppet skiers in 2022, 65 percent have skied Vasaloppet before. 35 percent are skiing Vasaloppet for the first time. 17.5 percent of the registered participants in the track on Sunday are women.\n\nThe winners\n\nThe men’s victors of the last nine years have all come from Norway, while the last five women’s victors have been from Sweden. Three previous winners are in the elite group this year: Anders Aukland 2004, Andreas Nygaard 2018 and Tord Asle Gjerdalen 2021. Three of the women’s winners in recent years are also in the elite group this year: Laila Kveli 2013 and 2014, Britta Johansson Norgren 2017 and 2019 and Lina Korsgren 2018, 2020 and 2021.\n\nOnly eight different men’s victors and four different women’s victors have managed to defend their Vasaloppet win the next year. Most recently, John Kristian Dahl 2017 and Lina Korsgren 2021. Only nine times in the men’s class (since 1922) and four times in the women’s class (introduced in 1997) has the person who finished second in Vasaloppet won the race the following year.\n\nStart list\n\nresults.vasaloppet.se/2022/?lang=EN_CAP&pid=startlist >\n\n(The elite start group is VL0, after which there are ten additional start groups.)\n\nLast year’s results\n\nVasaloppet 2021, men\n\n1 Tord Asle Gjerdalen, Norway, 3.28.18\n\n2 Anton Karlsson, Sockertoppen IF, 3.28.54\n\n3 Ermil Vokuev, Russia, 3.29.19\n\n4 Emil Persson, Östersunds SK, 3.29.54\n\n5 Ari Luusua, Finland, 3.29.57\n\n6 Johan Hoel, Norway, 3.29.57\n\n7 Oskar Kardin, 3.29.59\n\n8 Maxim Vylegzhanin, Russia, 3.30.01\n\n9 Karstein Johaug, Norway, 3.30.02\n\n10 Morten Eide Pedersen, Norway, 3.30.07\n\nVasaloppet 2021, women\n\n1 Lina Korsgren, Åre Längdskidklubb, 3.52.08\n\n2 Marit Bjørgen, Norway, 3.52.50\n\n3 Ida Dahl, IFK Mora Skidklubb, 3.57.07\n\n4 Thea Krokan Murud, Norway, 3.57.24\n\n5 Katerina Smutná, Czech Republic, 3.58.24\n\n6 Emilie Fleten, Norway, 3.58.28\n\n7 Britta Johansson Norgren, Sollefteå Skidor IF, 4.00.12\n\n8 Jenny Larsson, 4.04.07\n\n9 Linn Sömskar, IFK Umeå, 4.04.08\n\n10 Sofie Elebro, Östersunds SK, 4.05.26\n\nWatch Vasaloppet 2021 as a rerun on SVT Play >\n\nOdds\n\nThe Svenska Spel gambling site gives odds for Vasaloppet 2022.\n\nsvenskaspel.se/oddset >\n\nVisma Ski Classics\n\nThe international cross-country cup Visma Ski Classics, broadcast live on Swedish Television, is now in its twelfth season.

The first prize is a gold medal, a garland, a big red Dalecarlian horse and a cheque of 98,000 SEK (for both the winning man and woman). The men’s class winner will also get the Kranskulla honorary award, an embroidered pillow (the Kransmas honorary award was awarded in Tjejvasan). The total prize sum for 2022 is 571,000 SEK.\n\nThere are seven sprint prizes for both men and women: 10,000 SEK in Evertsberg (The Hill Prize) and 5,000 SEK at the six other checkpoints; Smågan, Mångsbodarna, Risberg, Oxberg, Hökberg and Eldris.\n\nVisma Ski Classics has a climb prize at the course’s highest point, 528 metres above sea level, three kilometres after the start. The first seven men and women to reach this height get points in the Climb Trophy cup. Visma Ski Classics also has sprint prizes for Mångsbodarna and Evertsberg. The first seven men and women to cross those checkpoints get points in the Sprint Trophy cup.\n\nIf a winner, male or female, breaks the Vasaloppet record time for their class they are awarded a 50,000 SEK record bonus.\n\nPlacement medals – gold, silver and bronze – are awarded to those who come first, second and third. Participants who finish within the winning time plus 50 percent are awarded the Vasaloppet achievement medal. 1,712 men and 116 women got the achievement medal in Vasaloppet 2020. The medal time for men was then 6.37.52 and for women 7.01.33.\n\nEveryone who completes Vasaloppet gets a diploma and a participation medal.\n\nGrand Slam\n\nFor last year’s season, Visma Ski Classics launched ”The Grand Classics” which includes the four big races Marcialonga in Italy, Jizerska50 in the Czech Republic, Vasaloppet in Sweden and Birkebeinerrennet in Norway. If a skier wins all four in one and the same season, they make a Grand Slam and win 100,000 Euros.\n\nSo far in history, no skier has managed to win all four races during the same season, not since Visma Ski Classics started nor before. The four races are also valued higher in Visma Ski Classics: Winners of these four races get 300 points in the overall cup, compared to 200 points for other races.\n\nKranskulla and Kransmas\n\nThis year’s Kranskulla is Wilma Björkman from IFK Mora (Kranskulla number 98) and Kransmas is Edvin Nilsson from Sälens IF (Kranskulla number 34).\n\nCounties\n\nThe participant numbers from different Swedish counties in Vasaloppet 2022 were, as of February 17: Stockholm (2500), Västra Götaland (2113), Dalarna (800), Skåne (685), Uppsala (638), Jönköping (556), Västerbotten (513), Östergötland (485), Halland (415), Örebro (369), Värmland (352), Gävleborg (332), Norrbotten (325), Västernorrland (314), Jämtland (300), Västmanland (288), Kronoberg (278), Södermanland (262), Kalmar (221), Blekinge (126), Gotland (71). Alterations may be made up until the start and statistics are not final.\n\nNations\n\nAbout 3,700 of Vasaloppet’s registered participants for 2022 represent 48 nations other than Sweden: Most come from Norway (851), Finland (507), Denmark (492), the Czech Republic (376), Germany (300), Switzerland (169), Estonia (166), Italy (147), the Netherlands (107), Austria (90), Iceland (80), France (62) and the United States (61).\n\nVasaloppet records\n\n61 different men have won the 97 races. One time, in 1988, there was a shared victory. The 25 years with a women’s class have seen 15 different ladies win.\n\nMost Vasaloppet victories on the men’s side: Nils ”Mora-Nisse” Karlsson (9 wins), Janne Stefansson (7 wins), Arthur Häggblad and Jan Ottosson (4 wins), Oskar Svärd, Daniel Tynell and Jörgen Brink and John Kristian Dahl (3 wins).\n\nSofia Lind has most victories, four, in the women’s class (1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005). Sofia Lind was also the top woman in 1996, the year before Vasaloppet’s official ladies class was introduced. Lina Korsgren has taken three victories.\n\nThe current record time for men is 3.28.18 (Tord Asle Gjerdalen, 2021) and for women 3.52.08 (Lina Korsgren, 2021).\n\nErnst Alm, who in 1922 won the very first Vasaloppet, is still the youngest male victor. He was 22 years and 18 days old when he won (born 1900-03-01). The oldest Vasaloppet victor is Jörgen Brink who was 37 years, 11 months and 23 days old when he won in 2012 (born 1974-03-10).\n\nYoungest and oldest Vasaloppet winners among the ladies, since the official women’s class was introduced in 1997, are Sofia Lind (born 1975-09-04) and Svetlana Nagejkina (born 1965-02-02). Sofia Lind was 21 years, 5 months and 26 days old when she won in 1997 and Svetlana Nagejkina was 37 years, 1 month and 1 day old when she won in 2002. What do Britta Johansson Norgren and Marit Bjørgen have to say about this?\n\nThe smallest margin between the male and female victors was in 2007 when Elin Ek was only 4 minutes and 49 seconds after the male winner Oskar Svärd. (Best total placement for a lady was Justyna Kowalczyk in 2015, who was 71st to cross the finish line.)\n\nJust 14 male victors and 4 female victors have won Vasaloppet on their first attempt. The latest were Petter Eliassen 2015 and Justyna Kowalczyk 2015. The one with most attempts before a first victory is Jörgen Aukland who won Vasaloppet 2008 the tenth time he participated. On the women’s side Jenny Hansson holds this ”record”: she won Vasaloppet 2011 when participating for the seventh time.\n\nIn 2013 Jörgen Aukland became history’s first Vasaloppet winner to pole his way through the whole race without using grip wax (since skate was prohibited). In 2014 Laila Kveli became the first lady to win without grip wax.\n\nTV broadcasts around the world\n\nVisma Ski Classics is broadcast by NRK (Norway), SVT (Sweden), NENT (Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Iceland), Czech TV (Czech Republic), JOJ channels (Slovakia), TVP (Poland), Best4sport (Lithuania), beIN Sports (Australia, Canada, USA).\n\nHere are all the times for radio, RV and streaming of Vasaloppet on March 6, 2022\n\nSveriges Radio P4\n\n07:18–14:00 Radiosporten is broadcasting Sportextra with Vasaloppet.

From 2020 and on you may also count Nattvasan 90. After the 2021 races, 1,122 veterans (of which 17 are ladies) have skied 30 or more races. 48 veterans have skied 50 races or more (Vasaloppet/Öppet Spår). In Vasaloppet, veterans start in their own row in start group 5 (closest to the wall).\n\nMost races, 60, have been skied by three veterans. Bengt Eriksson of Sälens IF skied his 60th race in a row in 2013 (54 Vasaloppet and 6 Öppet Spår between 1953 and 2013). Börje Karlsson from Landsbro IF SK skied Öppet Spår 2020 – his 60th race. Before that he’d completed 59 ”real” Vasaloppet.

For all this, 500,000 paper cups are needed (which are, of course, recycled).\n\nTime penalty\n\nIf a participant is found to have littered in or along the Vasaloppet course (which is a nature reserve) then he or she will receive a time penalty of 15 minutes. Disposing of litter is permitted in three different ways: In the bins at the Vasaloppet checkpoints; In the marked littering zones between each Vasaloppet checkpoint; Where you as a participant know that a team leader or associate will pick up what you throw. For elite skiers Vasaloppet holds special dialogue, requiring that each team takes responsibility for, and picks up, any of their waste that is thrown along the track.\n\nCompetition Jury\n\nVasaloppet’s competition jury consists of TD Thomas Granlund, assistant TD Stefan Bygdesson as well as competition managers Bo Johansson and Annlouise Almqvist.\n\nWeather\n\nThe lowest temperature at a Vasaloppet start in Sälen was -30 degrees C, measured in 1935 and 1987. The highest starting temperature, +4.5 degrees C, was in 2015. Over the 97 years that Vasaloppet has run, it’s been below zero at the start 84 times.\n\nTrain\n\nA special direct train with Vasaloppet participants runs from Malmö via Gothenburg and Stockholm to Mora.\n\ndirekttag-med-snalltaget >\n\nThe Summer Week 2022\n\nVasaloppet doesn’t just have a Winter Week.

The participant skis in Vasaloppet’s Winter Week and runs and bikes the same distance in Vasaloppet’s Summer Week in August.
