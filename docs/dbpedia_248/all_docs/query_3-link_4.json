        "text": "According to a press release from the Vasaloppet organization, millions of people from around the world will tune in to watch the race on TV. There are a record number of foreign participants, the age limit for participation has been lowered, there will be an opening ceremony before the start, and participants will experience an additional historical checkpoint between Risberg and Evertsberg.\n\nVasaloppet now joins the exclusive collection of major international sporting events that have been held for 100 years or more. One can think of events such as Wimbledon, Kentucky Derby, Tour de France, FA Cup, Stanley Cup, British Open, World Series, Indy 500, Giro d’Italia… But with the difference that anyone can sign up and participate in Vasaloppet.\n\nSince the first race in 1922, Vasaloppet has recorded 624.559 finishes; put together across the 99 races, participants have skied a distance equivalent to 1.405 laps around the Earth or 73 round trips to the moon. Counting all the different Vasaloppet ski races over the years, a total of 1.543.461 skiers have completed their race. If we also include all the finishes in the summer races since 2008, 1.813.643 finishes in Mora have been recorded (after Vasaloppet’s Summer Week in 2023).\n\nCheck out all the details about the world’s largest long-distance ski race happening this weekend.\n\nVASALOPPET QUICK FACTS\n\nDATE: Sunday, March 3, 2024\n\nSTART: Vasaloppet start, Berga By, Sälen\n\nSTART TIME: 08:00 CET\n\nFINISH: The finish line portal at the belfry in Mora\n\nDISTANCE: 90km, classic technique\n\nFOLLOW PARTICIPANTS: The official Vasaloppet app\n\nLIVE BROADCAST: On SC PLAY, radio, TV and streaming (see below)\n\nFIRST RACE: 1922\n\nCANCELLED: 1932, 1934 and 1990\n\nTHIS IS RACE NUMBER: 100\n\nREIGNING CHAMPIONS: Emil Persson (SWE) – Lager 157 Ski Team, and Emilie Fleten (NOR) – Team Ramudden\n\nREGISTERED PARTICIPANTS 2024: 15.800 (Total of 60.000 across all of Vasaloppet’s Winter Week 2024)\n\nRECORD NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: 15,709 started in 2010\n\nHILL PRIZE: Evertsberg 47km\n\nOTHER SPRINT PRICES: Smågan 11km, Mångsbodarna 24km, Risberg 36km, Oxberg 62km, Hökberg 71km, Eldris 81km\n\nSKI CLASSICS CLIMB: The highest point of Vasaloppet (528 meters above sea level) after 3km\n\nSKI CLASSICS SPRINT: Smågan 11km, Evertsberg 47km\n\nNEXT YEAR: Registration for the 101st Vasaloppet on March 2, 2025, opened on Thursday, February 22, 2024.\n\nWEBSITE: vasaloppet.se/en\n\nHistory\n\nGustav Eriksson’s adventure in Dalarna took place during the winter of 1520–21. On June 6, 1523, he was elected King of Sweden – as Gustav Vasa. The first Vasaloppet took place in 1922. This year will see the 100th Vasaloppet, which is also the 28th with a special competition class for women (started in 1997). Since 1948 the race has always run on the first Sunday of March, except in 2015 when the race ran on the second Sunday because of the World Ski Championships in Falun.\n\nThe first live TV broadcast of Vasaloppet took place in 1966. This will be the 47th time that Vasaloppet (in part or in its entirety) is transmitted live, and it’s the 42nd time that the Vasaloppet start is broadcast live on television. 1973 was the first year with a live broadcast in color. Since 1992 Vasaloppet has been shown live every year.\n\nRobin Bryntesson is making his debut as an elite skiing reporter and will provide reports from near the front. Artist Klara Hammarström and comedian Måns Möller will be featured as skiing reporters you can follow along throughout Vasaloppet.\n\nOpening of the 100th Vasaloppet\n\n07:15–08:00 CET – Vasaloppet start, Berga by. Opening speeches by the Malung-Sälen municipal councilor and by the chairman of Sälens IF. Presentation of the Bol-Bengt scholarship and traditional herding calls by Agneta Stolpe and Ann-Sofi Nilsson.\n\nThe extra checkpoint 2024\n\nAt an additional checkpoint, beyond the seven regular Vasaloppet checkpoints, participants and spectators will be transported 100 years back in time. The checkpoint will be set up between Risberg and Evertsberg, just before the Evertsberg lakes, in a historical environment with open fires and torches. There will be pine branch decorations, functionaries in period clothing, and horses and sleds. The focus is on the experience, and no extra food or drinks will be served; participants can instead enjoy those at the regular Vasaloppet checkpoints.\n\nLowered age limit\n\nThe Swedish Ski Association decided ahead of the 2023/24 season to remove the distance restriction for younger juniors (men/women aged 17–18). According to previous regulations, this age category could only ski a maximum of 50km in a competition class, meaning that you could participate in Vasaloppet from the calendar year you turned 19. Now, there is no upper limit in the distance table when an athlete reaches junior age, meaning that you are eligible at age 17 to obtain a FIS code for international competition and thus, with current regulations, you’re able to move up to a senior class with unlimited competition distances. Hence, you can now participate in Vasaloppet from the year you turn 17 (this year, that means being born in 2007 or earlier).\n\nThe youngest person on the 2024 start list is Olof Sundin (born 2007-09-23). He will be younger than Alvar Myhlback when he participated in Vasaloppet 2023. The youngest woman in Vasaloppet 2024 is Ester Borg (2007-11-23), becoming the youngest woman ever in Vasaloppet.\n\nThe average age in Vasaloppet 2024 is 43.0 years.\n\nMore women than ever\n\n20.5 percent of the registered participants in Sunday’s event are women, which is the highest percentage ever.\n\nStart list\n\nRESULTS.VASALOPPET.SE/2024\n\n(The elite start group is ”Elit,” after which there are ten additional start groups.)\n\nWinners\n\nThe last ten Vasaloppet winners, women\n\n2014 Laila Kveli, Norway\n\n2015 Justyna Kowalczyk, Poland\n\n2016 Katerina Smutná, Czech Republic\n\n2017 Britta Johansson Norgren, Sweden\n\n2018 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2019 Britta Johansson Norgren, Sweden\n\n2020 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2021 Lina Korsgren, Sweden\n\n2022 Astrid Öyre Slind, Norway\n\n2023 Emilie Fleten, Norway\n\nThe last ten Vasaloppet winners, men\n\n2014 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2015 Petter Eliassen, Norway\n\n2016 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2017 John Kristian Dahl, Norway\n\n2018 Andreas Nygaard, Norway\n\n2019 Tore Björset Berdal, Norway\n\n2020 Petter Eliassen, Norway\n\n2021 Tord Asle Gjerdalen, Norway\n\n2022 Andreas Nygaard, Norway\n\n2023 Emil Persson, Sweden\n\nLast year’s results\n\nOnly eight different men’s victors and four different women’s victors have managed to defend their Vasaloppet win the next year.

Ten times in the men’s class (since 1922) and four times in the women’s class (introduced in 1997), the person who finished second in Vasaloppet won the race the following year; something Emil Persson accomplished last year when he ended a ten-year streak of Norwegian men’s victors.\n\nResults Vasaloppet 2023, women\n\n1 Emilie Fleten (NOR), Team Ramudden, 4.04.08\n\n2 Silje Øyre Slind (NOR), Team Aker Daehlie, 4.06.41\n\n3 Ida Dahl (SWE), Team Engcon, 4.08.08\n\n4 Magni Smedås (NOR), Team Eksjöhus, 4.09.21\n\n5 Astrid Öyre Slind (NOR), Team Aker Daehlie, 4.11.22\n\n6 Anikken Gjerde Alnes (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 4.13.28\n\n7 Jenny Larsson (SWE), Team Ragde Charge, 4.14.02\n\n8 Kati Roivas (FIN), Team Naeringsbanken Stora Enso, 4.14.05\n\n9 Hanna Lodin (SWE), Ski Team Göhlins, 4.18.16\n\n10 Sandra Schützová (CZE), Vltava Fund Ski Team, 4.18.44\n\nResults Vasaloppet 2023, men\n\n1 Emil Persson (SWE), Lager 157 Ski Team, 3.37.43\n\n2 Andreas Nygaard (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 3.37.43\n\n3 Kasper Stadaas (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 3.37.44\n\n4 Petter Stakston (NOR), Team Aker Daehlie, 3.37.45\n\n5 Johan Hoel (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 3.37.49\n\n6 Joar Andreas Thele (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 3.37.59\n\n7 Oskar Kardin (SWE), Team Ragde Charge, 3.37.59\n\n8 Alvar Myhlback (SWE), Lager 157 Ski Team, 3.38.00\n\n9 Max Novak (SWE), Team Aker Daehlie, 3.38.01\n\n10 Karstein Johaug (NOR), Team Ragde Charge, 3.38.01\n\nAlso Read: Unveiling the favorites for Vasaloppet’s 100th edition\n\nSki Classics\n\nThe international cross-country cup Ski Classics, broadcast live on Swedish Television, has run ever since 2012.

The official awards ceremony for Vasaloppet 2024 will be held at 15:00 at Mora-Nisse’s Square in the finish area. Training scholarships will be awarded to the top 15 men and the top 15 women. The prize sum is the same in the men’s and women’s classes.\n\nThe first prize (for both men and women) is a gold medal, a green salal leaf garland, a big red Dalecarlian horse, and a cheque of 100.000 SEK, the biggest amount so far. In addition, the victors receive the sponsors’ honorary award, a brass cast ship’s bell, awarded this year by Ahlsell. The men’s class winner will also get the Kranskulla honorary award, an embroidered pillow. (The Kransmas honorary award was given at Tjejvasan). The women’s champion receives a pair of twine-knitted mittens with a “Vasaloppet 2024” embroidery from Mora Hemslöjd.\n\nThere are seven sprint prizes for both men and women: 10.000 SEK in Evertsberg (The Hill Prize) and 5.000 SEK at the six other checkpoints: Smågan, Mångsbodarna, Risberg, Oxberg, Hökberg, and Eldris.\n\nThe total prize sum for Vasaloppet 2024 is 620.000 SEK. If a participant sets a new record time in the men’s or women’s class of Vasaloppet, they will also be awarded a 50.000 SEK record bonus. The current record time for women is 3.50.06 (Astrid Øyre Slind, 2022). The current record time for men is 3.28.18 (Tord Asle Gjerdalen, 2021).\n\nPlacement medals – gold, silver, and bronze – are awarded to those who come first, second, and third. Participants who finish within the winning time plus 50 percent are awarded the Vasaloppet achievement medal. Everyone who completes Vasaloppet gets a diploma and a participation medal. This year’s medals have a special design inspired by older Vasaloppet medals.\n\nSki Classics has a” climb prize” at the course’s highest point, 528 meters above sea level, three kilometers after the start. The first seven men and women to reach this height get points in the Climb competition. Ski Classics also keeps track of sprints in Smågan and Evertsberg; the first seven men and women to reach those checkpoints get points in the Sprint competition.\n\nNo Grand Slam this year\n\nFor the 2020/21 season, Ski Classics launched ”The Grand Classics” which includes the four big events: Marcialonga in Italy, Jizerská50 in the Czech Republic, Vasaloppet in Sweden and Birkebeinerrennet in Norway. These four races are valued higher in Ski Classics: Winners get 300 points in the overall cup, compared to 200 points for other races. If a skier wins all four in one and the same season, they make a Grand Slam and win 100.000 Euros. So far in history, no skier has managed to win all four races during the same season, not since Ski Classics started nor before. Since Jizerská50 2024 was cancelled, no one can win a Grand Slam this year.\n\nThe 100th Kranskulla and 36th Kransmas\n\nThis year’s Kranskulla is Elsa Hermansson (Kranskulla no. 100) and Kransmas is Gustav Johnsson (Kransmas no. 36), both are elite ski orienteers from IFK Mora.\n\nParticipant numbers from different counties\n\nThe participant numbers from different Swedish counties in Vasaloppet 2024 were, as of this past Monday: Stockholm 2.610, Västra Götaland 2.006, Dalarna 781, Skåne 634, Uppsala 622, Östergötland 527, Västerbotten 488, Jönköping 455, Halland 432, Gävleborg 392, Jämtland 366, Värmland 355, Örebro 344, Norrbotten 326, Västernorrland 320, Västmanland 262, Kronoberg 230, Södermanland 220, Kalmar 181, Blekinge 120, Gotland 29.

This rule was introduced in 2017. Disposing of litter is permitted in three different ways: In the bins at the Vasaloppet checkpoints; In the marked littering zones between each Vasaloppet checkpoint; Where you as a participant know that a team leader or associate will pick up what you throw. For elite skiers Vasaloppet holds special dialogue, requiring that each team takes responsibility for, and picks up, any of their waste that is thrown along the track.\n\nBan on ski wax with fluorine\n\nStarting this year, Vasaloppet, like all other races in Vasaloppet’s Winter Week, has banned the use of fluoro wax.\n\nWeather\n\nThe coldest temperature at a Vasaloppet start in Sälen was -30 degrees Celsius, measured in 1935 and 1987. The warmest starting temperature, +4.5 degrees Celsius, was in 2015. Over the 99 years that Vasaloppet has run, it’s been below zero at the start 86 times.\n\nVasaloppet’s Summer Week 2024\n\nVasaloppet doesn’t just have a Winter Week. Since 2009, there’s also a Vasaloppet Summer Week with twelve mountain bike and running races, such as Cykelvasan 90 and Ultravasan 90.\n\nVasaloppstrippeln x3\n\nVasaloppstrippeln means completing three different types of Vasaloppet during one and the same calendar year. The participant skis in Vasaloppet’s Winter Week and runs and cycles the same distance in Vasaloppet’s Summer Week in August. The distances are 90, 45, and 30 kilometers."
