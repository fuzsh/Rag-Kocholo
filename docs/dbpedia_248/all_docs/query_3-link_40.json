These are very disturbinjitioHuences pressing upon us from all sides, and do not augur well for the early restoration of confldence, and of course until confldence is thoroughly re-established a permanent revival of business is impossible. The news from Australia, reporting the partial failure of the crops in some districts, is not pleasant reading, as it hints at a curtailment of our exports to that quarter in fact, the only bright spot on the commercial horizon Is the chance of our doing a gradually expanding trade with America. Meanwhile the want of elasticity in the revenue is indisput* able evidence of the indifferent state of affairs here. The returns for the financial year ending March 31 show that, except the Post Office, hardly an important source of revenue has yielded the return expected. In excise and customs the results are distinctly disappointing, the receipts from the former falling below the total of 1884-85 by £1,140,000 and the latter by £494,000. The actual increase in income in the twelve months is barely £1,540,000, or fully £1,000,000 less than what was anticipated in the revised budget. These are not satisfactory statistics to contemplate. It is, to say the least of it, unfortunate that the incidence of taxation should be so oppressive at a period when the nation is far from being well prepared to bear it, and it is a subject for regret that there is no probability of a speedy relief, which would strengthen any symptoms of reviving trade. Apparently the time has not yet arrived when we shall be able to abandon the waiting policy and extend more freely the ramifications of our trade. Money has been rather more wanted the past week, but the demand has been mainly in connection with the Stock Exchange settlement, and quotations at the close of the week were not so strong as during the earlier part. An important feature in the Bank of England weekly return is the decrease of £1,146,293 in private deposits. This should indicate a growing scarcity of money which should speedily affect quotations. Part of this loss £457,058 has gone to swell the total of public deposits through the revenue collections; but even allowing for this, and for the quarterly payments, it is clear that there has been more movement in money during the week. The present total of private deposits is £33,140,000. This is about £3,500,000 less than a year ago, when the Ba"
