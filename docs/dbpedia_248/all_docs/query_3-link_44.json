        "text": "From losing to Gothenburg Ice Skating Club to becoming Swedish Champions...\n\n2021/2022\n\nA historic season in many ways. Frölunda HC had planned to start a ladies team in 2023, but announced in October 2021 that the team will be in place earlier than that, one whole year to be exact. Former international goalie Kim Martin-Hasson was named general manager for the pioneer team and Erika Holst – another Swedish ladies legend – was appointed headcoach. Hanna Olsson, Swedish international, was first player in followed by a world class trio: Michelle Karvinen, Andrea Dalen and Stephanie Neatby.\n\nThe change of logotype actually took place the 20 of April, but not without controversy. The first version did not please the members at all and the process went on with the clubs members in control. From the members the club was assigned the task to present three variations of logotypes at a members meeting. At the meeting the members by vote decided on the new logotype for the club.\n\nOn the ice Frölunda finished fourth in the SHL and lost in the semifinal to Luleå. In the CHL Rögle won a tight semifinal.\n\n2020/2021\n\nA very strange season that was governed by covid.

The team went through to the quarterfinal, but was eliminated by Rögle who won four straight games. The CHL was canceled – no games played.\n\nLucas Raymond was drafted by Detroit Red Wings in the first round.\n\nFrölunda HC communicated in September 2020 that the club will present a new logotype in the summer of 2021.
