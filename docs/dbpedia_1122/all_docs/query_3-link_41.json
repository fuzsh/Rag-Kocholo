        "text": "The website Travelawaits.com is highlighting the SteelStacks campus as one of eight “incredibly cool” concert venues around the world, putting it in the ranks of the Sydney Opera House and the Red Rocks amphitheater in Colorado.\n\nThe site aims to serve travelers 50-and-older, but its ranking of eight venues around the world is sure to appeal to any music fan.\n\nHere’e what the website had to say about Bethlehem’s SteelStacks campus, which boasts the Musikfest Cafe inside of the ArtsQuest Center, the outdoor Levitt Pavilion and the main stage during Musikfest. (It looks like the site might not get the nuances of those stages, but that’s OK, since we all do.)\n\n\"SteelStacks is located on a 10-acre revitalized brownfield that was the former home of Bethlehem Steel. At nighttime, the enormous steelworks tower over the stage, creating the perfect backdrop for a once-in-a-lifetime photo. This place looks incredible, and the acoustics don’t disappoint -- not what you’d expect, given that you’re surrounded by tons of American steel.\n\nSteelStacks books a variety of artists, from stadium-level rockers like Weezer and Brad Paisley to smaller names like the Jayhawks and the Smithereens. You can also take a tour of the site, and the venue occasionally has special programming for families.\"\n\nThis puts Bethlehem in really good company. Other venues include:\n\nArena of Nimes, France - one of the world’s best-preserved Roman amphitheaters, originally built as a bullring, it has seating for 12,000.\n\nThe art gallery, theater and intimate music venue, the MeetFactory in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nDalhalla, Rattvik, Sweden, is surrounded by a former limestone quarry created by a meteorite impact about 360 million years ago.\n\nEveryone from the Beatles to opera stars have graced the stage at the geological phenomenon that is the Red Rocks amphitheater in Morrison, Col.\n\nThe Wieliczka Salt Mine in Krakow, Poland, is a concert venue, museum and tourist attraction that operated as a mine from the 13th century until 2007. It’s acoustics lend themselves to classical performances.\n\nSlane Castle in Slane, Ireland, only hosts one concert a year -- think big names like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica -- but it is quite an affair when it does.\n\nObviously, the iconic Sydney Opera House in Australia made the list as one of the world’s most famous performing arts venues and one of the city’s most distinctive buildings."
