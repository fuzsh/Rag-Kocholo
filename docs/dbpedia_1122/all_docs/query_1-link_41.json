There are many interesting places to visit on the route; Wasastenen, the church stables at Rättviks church, Rättviks old homestead and Dalhalla are just some.\n\nLength: 25 km Green Trail: Easy cycling in flat terrain Duration: 2-4 hours Start: The railway station in Rättvik Worth a stop Rättviks Gammelgård This is a typical homestead from the 1830s, the style of which has its origins in the middle ages. In the summer months there are daily tours of the homestead. Garden café Nyfiket would be delighted to serve you ecological coffee and buns and lunch. Dalhalla This is a feast for the eyes and ears, set as it is in a disused limestone quarry and fronted by an emerald green moat that separates the stage from the audience. World-class acoustics are promised here. Matsgården What you see inside the house here is how a wealthy farming family would have lived some 150 years ago and parts of it date back to the mid 17th century. Open summertime, so why not drop in to see one or all of the thirteen functional buildings? Bysjön lake Come to see the rich bird life and enjoy the bathing spot for dips in the lake.\n\nShow more Show less"
