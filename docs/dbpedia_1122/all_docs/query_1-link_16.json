        "text": "Dalhalla\n\nDalhalla is an outdoor amphitheater sitting in a former limestone quarry in Rattvik, Dalarna, Sweden. The stage stands at 200 ft below ground level and is about 570 ft wide. The quarry was in use until 1990 and was transformed into an outdoor theatre in 1995 to take advantage of its acoustics.\n\nThe venue usually holds around 20 to 30 performances each summer from June to September, when temperatures are at their peak. Performers from every genre are welcomed, including opera singers, jazz bands, and rock bands. Popular rock artists Pink Floyd and Lionel Richie have been some of the few to have the pleasure of performing on this beautiful stage."
