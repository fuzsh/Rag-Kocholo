        "text": "Information on the Processing of Personal Data by Rättvik Event AB\n\nRättvik Event AB values your personal privacy. Therefore, we always strive to protect your personal data in the best way possible and comply with applicable data protection regulations. Through this privacy policy, we want to inform you about how your personal data is processed by us. This privacy policy applies to those who visit an event, purchase a ticket, or otherwise use our products or services. We explain how we collect and use personal data. It also describes your rights.\n\nWhat is Personal Data?\n\nPersonal data is all information that can be directly or indirectly linked to a living person. Typical personal data includes personal identification numbers, names, and addresses. Photos and IP addresses are also classified as personal data.\n\nWho is Responsible for the Personal Data?\n\nRättvik Event AB (org no. 556709-3926) is the data controller for the processing of personal data.\n\nHow Do We Collect Data?\n\nWe collect information from you when you purchase a ticket for any of our events, visit our website, Instagram, or Facebook page, or otherwise interact with us. We process information about the events you have purchased through us or any of our resellers. We also process data about your purchase history. We process IP addresses, language settings, geographic information, and other data we receive when you visit our website or our social media.\n\nYou provide information about yourself when you subscribe to our newsletter.

We may also process your data because, through an established customer relationship with you, we have a legitimate interest in you.\n\nWho Can Access Your Personal Data?\n\nRättvik Event AB will not sell your data to a third party. In some cases, we share your personal data with entities that process personal data on our behalf, known as data processors. In the following cases, we share information with such parties:\n\nSuppliers, such as those providing IT systems, ticketing systems, managing bookings, or processing payments on behalf of our customers. Marketing companies and social media where these companies provide services, technical solutions, and platforms for our customer relations work. Collaboration partners where we want you as a customer to have the opportunity to use offers and benefits from our partners. In some cases, we may need to share names, email, and mobile numbers with you as a ticket buyer.\n\nOther recipients when required by law, other regulations, or authority decisions.\n\nWhen your personal data is shared with an independent data controller, such as an authority or a bank, the recipient’s privacy policy and information on personal data management apply.\n\nWhere Do We Process Your Personal Data?\n\nAs a general rule, we and our suppliers and collaborators process your personal data only within the EU/EEA. In cases where our data processors are established or store information in a country outside the EU/EEA, data may be transferred there. Regardless of the country where your personal data is processed, we take all measures to ensure that the level of protection is the same as within the EU/EEA. In cases where personal data is processed outside the EU/EEA, either a decision by the Commission that the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection exists, or appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your rights.\n\nHow Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data?\n\nWe store your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the processing or as required by applicable law. The personal data we collect during a booking is stored in our customer database. The data is stored to facilitate for you as a customer with us and as a basis for marketing and customer analysis to improve our offerings and product range. If personal data is linked to data related to accounting, this information will be stored for 7 years according to the Accounting Act.\n\nPersonal data provided during a subscription to our newsletter is stored for as long as you are an active reader.
