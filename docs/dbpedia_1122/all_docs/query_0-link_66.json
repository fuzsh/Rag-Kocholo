        "text": "after seeing phish play at the forum for the second time in under a year, i was blown away yet again by how great that venue is. the sound is flawless, there’s plenty of room on the floor, and not a bad view anywhere in the seats. since the msg guys bought it and have made it a music-only venue, the forum is now one of the premiere arenas in the country and hopefully a place that phish continues to perform in.\n\ni’ve been lucky enough to have seen concerts in some of the best venues in the united states (no gorge or red rocks, though, so maybe i’m a poser), but there is one venue that i’ve never been to, and it seems like a musical xanadu. my white whale of concert experiences: dalhalla in sweden.\n\nif you’re unfamiliar, dalhalla is an outdoor amphitheatre that was built in an old limestone quarry near lake siljan in the town of rattvik. and not only does it have a badass name, dalhalla is supposed to have some of the best sounding acoustics in the world.\n\ndalhalla hosts orchestras and operas in addition to traditional concerts so they have to deal with a lot of sound variety, and if you love phish then you can imagine how much fun kuroda would have at this place after looking at the pictures below.\n\nas a swede myself, i’ve wanted to visit the country for years, but a concert at dalhalla would be an experience of a lifetime. doesn’t even have to be a band or musician i’m into, i’ll go see the local retirement home’s choir sing viking folk songs in norse if it means being there at night under that wide open sky.\n\nbesides that, there’s not much else to say, the photos here do all the talking:"
