        "text": "The idea of cultural regions and regional cultures has a long pedigree in several disciplines and traditions, and in different national contexts. Indeed the variation of customs and habits across the face of the world seems one of the most basic elements experiencing the world. It is an impulse to curiosity, to travel, a source of misunderstanding and translation and sometimes conflict and hostility. Here I want to explore three consequences or issues thrown up by thinking of cultures as spatially patterning the world. The first is that of defining which culture occupies which territory. Typically we think of place and culture as bound together – each shaping the other, but I want to argue that our notion of these ‘regions’ and territories is at least as inflected by how the specific ways that have been used to interpret the world as by cultural patterns. In other words how do we define the ‘region’ or territory, and, relatedly, how do we define the culture. Second, this spatial patterning raises issues of scale. Thus we might at one level talk of ‘Latin American’ culture to refer to the shared histories of conquest, resistance and mixed Indian and Iberian heritage. At another level strong political claims are made by states to claim to legitimacy through the notion that one people form one state. In a problematic relationship to this then are accounts that see regional cultures within – and especially problematically – across nationstate borders. These we might say are thus respectively epistemological and ontological issues with thinking about regions and cultures. The third point I want to make is more of a consequence of how we think about regional cultures. It is to think then about how these ideas are represented, popularised and instantiated in society. So here I am going to chart particular preservation efforts through especially open air museums. How they move from the realm of academic studies of folklore, ethnology, cultural geography into popular culture, political institutions and so forth. Of course it is not quite as simple as this since I will try and show that academic interest often derives from precisely popular sentiment and the cultural zeitgeist as much as intellectual curiosity.\n\nWhat is Culture and Health? Culture and Health: A Wider Horizon introduces this highly topical field of enquiry from a broad, multidisciplinary perspective. The book addresses fundamental issues including: * What do the terms ‘culture’ and ‘health’ actually mean? * How has the field emerged in Sweden? * How can we research Culture and Health? * Can we avoid an instrumentalisation of art – and should we? Culture and Health: A Wider Perspective also provides a detailed introduction to two central, international research directions: ‘arts and health’ and the ‘medical humanities’. As well, the book sketches the diversity of research perspectives in the field at the University of Gothenburg. Culture and Health: A Wider Perspective is at once an accessible and in-depth introduction to the field with many approaches. Directed at researchers, students, policymakers and practitioners, the book is an important resource for future study and practical work.\n\nTHE FIELD OF ARTS AND HEALTH is part of the broader field of Culture and Health. Its orientation is practical and methodological and it translates and examines the idea that the arts can have a healing effect and promote well-being. ‘The arts’ is understood here in the plural and the designation, therefore, includes not only the visual arts but other aesthetic forms such as music, drama, dance, literature, theatre, architecture and sculpture. In the literature, it is consistently described as multifaceted in terms of the research disciplines, practical programmes and concrete activities that are included, as well as their aims and focus. What unites the varied programmes and activities is the interest in the significance of the arts to health and well-being. This chapter is an analytical introduction to the Arts and Health field and is not an exhaustive or systematic overview. The hope is that the chapter will engage and intrigue and lead the reader to explore further, for example via the extensive reference list. We also present a few concepts that can create understanding for the field – beyond the isolated examples that we discuss. The chapter is divided into three sections, which gradually elevate the analytical level. In the first, ‘The arts as the health-promoting link between body and mind’, we present examples of how people in the Arts and Health field justify their activities, because these seem to embrace a similar fundamental view on art as a remedy vis-à-vis the biomedical division of human beings into body and mind. The health-promoting effect of the arts is thus the focus of attention, but precisely what kind of projects this results in varies. In the second section of the chapter, ‘From spiritual inspiration to measurable health outcomes’, we present a model, the Arts and Health Diamond, which illustrates the various aims in relation to which Arts and Health projects are usually designed. This illustrates how the field encompasses projects that mainly focus on individuals or social interaction within and between groups, that certain projects take health-promoting potential as their point of departure, while others work as a complement to the traditional healing approaches of medicine. The chapter ends with the section ‘Arts and Health between science and society’, in which we analyse a few fundamental questions about the nature of science, art and social benefit. Arts and Health may be seen as incorporated in a multifaceted ‘boundary project’ in which the boundaries of good science and art are negotiated. This boundary project has bearing far beyond the field of Arts and Health."
