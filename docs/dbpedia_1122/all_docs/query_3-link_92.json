        "text": "She immediately saw the potential of the quarry for use as a music arena. The location was ideal, far away from all buildings, and well-shielded against noise pollution from roads and industry.\n\nShe was appointed project manager for the entertainment programme. The project was supported by Rättvik municipality and Dalarna County Council. In June 1993, a test concert was held with an invited audience, press and TV, and later the same year the Dalhalla Friends association was formed.\n\nThe first concert was held in 1994 and the official opening was on 21 June 1995, with the performance of a major opera. This was shown live on Swedish TV and attracted great media attention, even in other countries. In autumn 1999 the stage and seating area were rebuilt to increase the capacity from 2600 to 4000. The rebuilt arena was officially opened in summer 2000 with the Swedish King and Queen in attendance.\n\nSince then, the list of high-class events held at Dalhalla is long. World-famous artists have performed in the arena, and many of the most famous operas have been staged."
