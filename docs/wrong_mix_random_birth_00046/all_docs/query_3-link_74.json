        "text": "It was a late night. The enormous GOP crowd at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans Arena (now Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse), host to the 2016 Republican National Convention (RNC), was on its feet with future U.S. national security advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn at the microphone exhorting the delegates to chant, “Lock her up, lock her up.” Waiting in the wings just to the right of the podium was the next speaker, Iowa Gov. Jodi Ernst. She paced anxiously. With the end of network primetime coverage only minutes away, Ernst would likely not get to address a national TV audience as Gen. Flynn continued the flame-thrower rhetoric, his carotid artery bulging as sweat dripped off his brow. “I call on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race…because of her careless use of a private email server.” He went on to excoriate the enemies of the state and extol the qualities of the man many of us refused to believe would be the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The Party of Trump was being born that night. The city of rock and roll was clearly being rocked by what at first appeared as a fringe movement, but would later co-opt the entire Republican Party.\n\nI witnessed an intense and politically jubilant four-day political pep rally back in July of 2016. That convention ushered in a decidedly rightward shift within the Republican Party. It also yielded a candidate who had neither held public office or served in the military, a first. I came away, like so many, believing Hillary Clinton would have a cake-walk to the White House that November. The Democratic establishment thoroughly misjudged the mood of the electorate. In 2016, voter ire for the establishment was significant, and growing. The country was wanting to move past the political dynasties of the Bushes and the Clintons. Democratic leadership had an opportunity to change its stripes in the populist campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but the political omen went unheeded. Which brings us to today’s critical moment, when some of the same leaders within the Democratic Party seem unable to grasp the present moment. Democratic voters love Joe Biden, but more than 60% of them know it is time for him to leave the stage. Will the Democratic Party leadership heed the call?\n\nDonald Trump has been on a campaign-light mode since his June 27th debate with Biden, just watching the Democrats, and Biden, flail as they try to make an historic decision: how to replace an ailing, and stumbling, incumbent President. The Trump campaign is feeling so confident about the debate results that it has yet (Friday afternoon) to unveil its VP choice, as Biden continues to teleconference with various Democrats about his fate. This is the 15th day that the Trump campaign is not allowing the nation to take its eyes off of the Democratic Party’s ongoing political train wreck that is playing out in real time. Who will blink first?\n\nWhen I entered the Cleveland arena eight years ago for the RNC, it was a Trump campaign that was inexperienced and at times, flagging badly. The attitude at that convention on the part of Trump and his consiglieres–Steven Miller, Steve Bannon, and Flynn–was a glimpse at the course behavior and reckless policy statements to come. Throw anything at the wall and see what sticks. And the lies continue to pile up, witness the more than 30 false claims Trump declared in his recent debate with Biden. These lies have become acceptable, even among long-time GOP office holders and officials. Trump's party will enter the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on Monday without many moderates or political minders like former Chiefs of Staff, John Kelley and Mick Mulvaney. Gone are former old-style Republicans like Michael Steele and John Kasich, both from Ohio. The irascible former UN Ambassador John Bolton and former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney are likely no-shows. The Bush family too has long been sidelined in the party of Trump, replaced by further to the right populist operatives like vice-Presidential hopefuls, Senators J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio, and billionaire businessman and governor, Doug Bergum.\n\nThen there’s the “2024 GOP PLATFORM, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” [sic] At 16 pages it is the Cliff’s Notes version of past party platforms. The previous two were 62(2020) and 60(2016) pages of policy statements, respectively. This year’s GOP Platform is anything but modest and lacking in specifics. There is page after page of blunt statements like ”Republicans Will End Left-wing Gender Insanity,” many seemingly pulled directly from the former President’s speeches. Of course, there is also a sprinkling of Trumpian superlatives–chapter 2. Seal the Border, and Stop the Migrant Invasion” and “chapter 3. Build the Greatest Economy in History. There are doses of nostalgia–”chapter 4. Bring Back the American Dream,” militarism–”chapter 9. Return to Peace Through Strength,” and jingoism, “America First: A Return to Common Sense.” (Preamble)\n\nThere is also a notable backing away from strict abortion limits or a federal abortion ban,. Instead, the platform notes, near its end on page 15, “Republicans will protect and defend a vote of the people, from within the States, on the Issue of Life.” While the document extolls the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it also touts states rights. “After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” The only mention of “abortion” is “We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF(fertility treatments.)”\n\nSo bring your popcorn, the RNC begins for real gnday, but the political gamesmanship continues, 24/7. Will Biden step down? Who will be Trump’s VP choice? And of course, what do the latest polls say? Much more to come."
