        "text": "After careful consideration of the respective counsels’ arguments, I have concluded that President Trump is guilty of the charge made by the House of Representatives…. President Trump also violated his oath of office by failing to protect the Capitol, the Vice President, and others in the Capitol.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney is Utah’s junior senator and has served in this role since 2019. Prior to representing the people of Utah in the Senate, he served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican nominee for president. A proud Republican, Sen. Romney has not let petty partisan politics get in the way of respecting the rule of law and abiding by the Constitution. In February of 2020, Sen. Romney was the only Republican lawmaker to vote to convict Trump for abusing his presidential powers. He was one of the first GOP senators to congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their victory and has repeatedly denounced Trump’s attempts to spread lies and threats against local election officials saying, “It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President.”"
