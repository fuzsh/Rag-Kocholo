        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — State Rep. Stefani Carter of Dallas is headed to an unlikely place for a Republican — the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAs a surrogate for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, Carter leaves early Wednesday for North Carolina and will spend two days “bracketing,” the campaign term for crafting Republican media responses to Democratic convention claims.\n\n“I’m very excited. I really am,” she said. “I think that what we have here is a president who made a lot of promises that he didn’t keep. I’m proud to be part of the team that responds regarding what hasn’t been done in three and a half years.”\n\nCarter said her work for the Romney campaign began when she was invited as his guest to the annual convention of the NAACP in Houston in July. “Of course I was flattered,” she said, “and it took off from there.” She helped the campaign out again in Tampa at the Republican National Convention, fielding interviews directed at the Hispanic and black communities and tackling questions on everything from “energy to debt spending to the economy.”\n\nCarter doesn’t know her schedule in Charlotte yet; she said the Romney campaign paid for her flight and arranged for her transportation, and that she’ll be operating out of a satellite office.\n\n“I think the record President Obama has is, frankly, dismal,” she said. “Gov. Romney’s message will be considered more effective and more believable, frankly, than the president’s.”"
