        "text": "Presidential politics has always been a rich man’s game. But now, thanks to the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United that upended decades of limits on campaign donations, financing a presidential race is the exclusive domain of the kind of megadonor whose portfolios make Mitt Romney look middle-class. “I have lots of money, and can give it legally now,” Texas billionaire and top GOP moneyman Harold Simmons recently bragged to The Wall Street Journal. “Just never to Democrats.”\n\nIn past elections, big donors like Simmons gave millions for advocacy groups like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. By law, such groups were only allowed to run issue ads – but instead they directly targeted John Kerry, drawing big fines from the Federal Elections Commission. Now, with the blessing of the Supreme Court, the wealthy can legally hand out unlimited sums to groups that openly campaign for a candidate, knowing that their “dark money” donations will be kept entirely secret. The billionaire Koch brothers, for instance, have reportedly pledged $60 million to defeat President Obama this year – but their off-the-book contributions don’t appear in any FEC filings.\n\nEven more money from megadonors is flowing into newly created Super PACs, which, unlike advocacy groups, can spend every cent they raise on direct attacks on an opponent. Under the new rules, the richest men in America are plying candidates with donations far beyond what Congress intended. “They can still give the maximum $2,500 directly to the campaign – and then turn around and give $25 million to the Super PAC,” says Trevor Potter, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center. A single patron can now prop up an entire candidacy, as casino magnate Sheldon Adelson did with a $20 million donation to the Super PAC backing Newt Gingrich.\n\nThe undisputed master of Super PAC money is Mitt Romney. In the primary season alone, Romney’s rich friends invested $52 million in his Super PAC, Restore Our Future – a number that’s expected to more than double in the coming months. This unprecedented infusion of money from America’s monied elites underscores the radical transformation of the Republican Party, which has made defending the interests of 0.0001 percent the basis of its entire platform. “Money buys power,” the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman observed recently, “and the increasing wealth of a tiny minority has effectively bought the allegiance of one of our two major political parties.” In short, the political polarization and gridlock in Washington are a direct result of the GOP’s capitulation to Big Money.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThat capitulation is evident in Romney’s campaign. Most of the megadonors backing his candidacy are elderly billionaires: Their median age is 66, and their median wealth is $1 billion. Each is looking for a payoff that will benefit his business interests, and they will all profit from Romney’s pledge to eliminate inheritance taxes, extend the Bush tax cuts for the superwealthy – and then slash the top tax rate by another 20 percent. Romney has firmly joined the ranks of the economic nutcases who spout the lie of trickle-down economics. “Support from billionaires has always been the main thing keeping those charlatans and cranks in business,” Krugman noted. “And now the same people effectively own a whole political party.”\n\nHere are the 16 donors who have given at least $1 million each to elect Romney – and what they expect in return for their investment:\n\nTHE COKE DEALER: William Koch\n\nPosition The “other” Koch brother, Bill sold his stake in Koch Industries to brothers David and Charles in the 1980s. He now runs Oxbow Carbon, a global dealer in petroleum coke, a cement-manufacturing fuel that’s high in climate-warming carbon dioxide.\n\nAge 72\n\nFortune $4 billion (Forbes 400 rank: 81)\n\nPast Donations Koch and his wife gave $70,000 to House Speaker John Boehner last year. Boehner “looks out for business interests,” a Koch deputy explained.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $2 million to Romney’s Super PAC, including $250,000 in his own name, $750,000 through Oxbow Carbon and another $1 million through a subsidiary. A sister company of Oxbow operates a Colorado mine that sells coal to the federal government – meaning that its campaign contribution is subsidized, in part, by taxpayers.\n\nWhat He Wants To pollute for free. Koch’s fortune is tied up in some of the nation’s dirtiest industries. He blasts the EPA, which has been trying to crack down on carbon pollution, as “hyper­aggressive.”\n\nHow He Lives His wine collection, which includes 40,000 bottles, is worth $12 million. Owns a mansion in Palm Beach, a vacation villa in Cape Cod, four properties near Aspen worth $47.5 million, and a cattle ranch in Colorado decorated with an Old West ghost town that he bought for $3 million and moved to his land. Purchased the only known photograph of Billy the Kid.\n\nRelated\n\nTHE WASTE BARON: Harold Simmons\n\nPosition Traffics in toxic chemicals and hazardous waste as head of Contran; owns one of the world’s largest producers of titanium. A former corporate raider nicknamed “Ice Man,” he pioneered the leveraged-buyout tactics that decimated American industry.\n\nAge 81\n\nFortune $9.8 billion (Forbes rank: 33)\n\nPast Donations Spent $3 million to Swift-boat John Kerry in 2004, and another $2.8 million in 2008 on “issue ads” linking Obama to Sixties radical Bill Ayers. “If we had run more ads,” he lamented, “we could have killed Obama.”\n\nCurrent Donations Before backing Romney with $800,000, Simmons made $1 million bets on Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. His total giving of $16.7 million makes him the GOP’s second-largest investor after Adelson. Most of the cash went to American Crossroads, the Super PAC founded by Karl Rove that has close ties to the Romney campaign.\n\nWhat He Wants Plans to store radioactive waste from 36 states in an underground dump in Texas; has been sued repeatedly by the Justice Department for failing to clean up contaminated Superfund sites. Calls Obama “the most dangerous American alive, because he would eliminate free enterprise in this country.”\n\nHow He Lives Doles out $100 bills to panhandlers. Jets between his coastal estate in California, his Arkansas ranch stocked with 35 bears and 100 elk, and his $4 million mansion on a private lake in Dallas, surrounded by 17,000 tulips.\n\nTHE McMANSIONEER: Bob Perry\n\nPosition Owner of Perry Homes, a megabuilder of high-end sprawl in Texas.\n\nAge 79\n\nFortune Estimated at $600 million\n\nPast Donations Spent $4.5 million to Swift-boat John Kerry in 2004. A Texas good ol’ boy, his relationship with Karl Rove stretches back 25 years. In the past decade, Perry has invested nearly $80 million in political candidates, including $7 million to American Crossroads in 2010.\n\nCurrent Donations At $4 million, “Bobby Jack” is the top donor to Romney’s Super PAC – including a $3 million lifeline in February, after Romney went for broke in Florida. The two have enjoyed profitable relations since 2005, when Romney chaired the Republican Governors Association. Perry has also given nearly $2.5 million to American Crossroads.\n\nWhat He Wants Perry’s top issue is “tort reform,” which would limit the size of jury awards against homebuilders who do shoddy work. He knows political favors can be bought: He was a big donor to every justice on the Texas Supreme Court – known derisively as “the Perry Court” – which vacated an $800,000 judgment against Perry for crappy construction. A jury in the same case later hit Perry with $58 million in damages.\n\nHow He Lives A total recluse, Perry stays holed up in his 13,000-square-foot mansion in Houston. According to a friend, he’s the kind of guy “you couldn’t pick out in a grocery store.”\n\nMR. FAIR AND NEWBALANCED: Jim Davis\n\nPosition Chairman of New Balance shoes\n\nAge 69\n\nFortune $1.8 billion (Forbes rank: 242)\n\nPast Donations Davis is a high-roller for the Massachusetts GOP. Backed Romney’s Senate campaign against Ted Kennedy in 1994; economic adviser on Romney’s gubernatorial transition team in 2002.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $1 million to Romney’s Super PAC. The donation was so toxic for business that New Balance’s CEO raced to Facebook to dismiss it as “a private donation and not a contribution from New Balance.”\n\nWhat He Wants A lucrative defense contract. Soldiers currently get a cash allowance to purchase sneakers made anywhere; New Balance has lobbied the Pentagon to buy its made-in-America shoes in bulk.\n\nHow He Lives Owns a 17,000-square-foot mansion worth $14 million in Newton, Massachusetts, and a summer estate in Gloucester.\n\nTHE HOTEL TYCOONS: Richard Marriott and Bill Marriott Jr.\n\nPosition Heirs to the Marriott Hotel fortune\n\nAges 73, 80\n\nFortunes $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion (Forbes ranking: 312 and 331)\n\nPast Donations Have given at least $1 million in lifetime political contributions, including hefty donations to prominent Democrats like senators Max Baucus and Charles Schumer.\n\nCurrent Donations Have each given $1 million to Restore Our Future. Also served as top donors to the PAC that Romney used to sustain a skeleton campaign after his failed presidential bid in 2008, devoting $230,000 to the interim effort.\n\nWhat They Want Bill has publicly backed immigration reform to create a legal pool of foreign-born workers for their hotels. Bemoaning cancellations during the recession, he has also lobbied Congress to force taxpayers to continue to subsidize luxury travel for executives of firms that receive federal bailouts. The Marriott fortune and Romney’s are literally intertwined: Romney served twice on the Marriott board – most recently in 2011 – and is named Willard after Bill’s dad, J. Willard Marriott Sr. (As a child, Romney summered at the Marriott compound on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.)\n\nHow They Live Both own mansions in suburban Maryland ($5 million and 15,000 square feet for Bill, $4.3 million and 9.5 bathrooms for Richard). Inherited the family compound in New Hampshire, as well as a 4,200-acre ranch at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nTHE BAIN BUDDY: Edward Conard\n\nPosition Ex-managing director of Bain Capital, Romney’s private equity firm. Wrote defense of Wall Street deregulation and monstrous inequality, Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You’ve Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong.\n\nAge 55\n\nFortune Estimated in the nine figures, rivaling Romney’s $250 million.\n\nPast Donations Has supported Romney since he ran for the Senate in 1993; gave nearly $10,000 to Romney’s PAC when he was governor of Massachusetts. Maximum donor to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $1 million to Restore Our Future, obscuring his contribution through a shell corporation, W Spann LLC, that dissolved right before Romney’s Super PAC was forced to reveal its donors. Conard came clean only after watchdogs noted that Spann shared an address with Bain. Tagged as a likely “bundler” for Romney donations, but the campaign will not disclose how much he has raised.\n\nWhat He Wants To screw taxpayers. Like Romney and many hedge-fund managers, Conard profits from the “carried interest” loophole that allows him to pay half the tax rate that others do on the same income. The Buffett Rule, backed by Obama, would force him to pay his fair share, effectively doubling his taxes.\n\nHow He Lives Owns a $7 million triplex on the Upper East Side of New York. A Harvard MBA, Conard believes the economy is governed by “Darwinian survival of the fittest.”\n\nTHE PYRAMID SCHEMER: Frank VanderSloot\n\nPosition CEO of Melaleuca Inc., a “multilevel marketing” firm based in Idaho that sells off-brand cleaning products and nutritional supplements. Moonlights as a megarancher of cattle and quarter horses.\n\nAge 63\n\nFortune Melaleuca’s annual revenues last year totaled $1 billion. VanderSloot is the 86th-largest private landowner in the United States, holding 110,448 acres.\n\nPast Donations More than $500,000 to Republicans, including $8,100 to former GOP senator Larry Craig of Idaho.\n\nCurrent Donations Melaleuca and three Asian subsidiaries gave a combined $1 million to Romney’s Super PAC. VanderSloot also serves as a national finance co-chair of the Romney campaign.\n\nWhat He Wants Fewer consumer protections. The FDA has rebuked Melaleuca for making “false and misleading” claims about its supplements, and the company has signed a consent decree agreeing to “not engage in the marketing and promotion of an illegal pyramid.” VanderSloot is also an anti-gay crusader: He tried to kill a PBS program for promoting “the homosexual lifestyle,” and gave big bucks to pass California’s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nHow He Lives Owns a 17-bedroom home in Idaho Falls. Breeds Angus cattle in Idaho and quarter horses in Utah.\n\nTHE OLYMPIC PARTNER: Steven Lund\n\nPosition Vice chairman and former CEO of Nu Skin enterprises, known as the “Mormon Amway.”\n\nAge 58\n\nFortune Reported $31.9 million in Nu Skin stock in company’s latest filing.\n\nPast Donations More than $80,000 to Republicans since 1990, including $7,300 to GOP senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $2 million to Restore Our Future. Like Conard, Lund obscured his donation through two shell companies: a defunct publishing business he incorporated in 1997, and a firm at the same address registered to his son-in-law.\n\nWhat He Wants A world safe for false advertising and marketing scams. Nu Skin has been charged by the Federal Trade Commission and state authorities with operating a pyramid scheme and making unsubstantiated claims about its cosmetics. In 1997, it was fined $1.5 million for violating a consent decree with the FTC. Romney has directly aided Lund’s fortunes: As head of the Salt Lake Winter Games, he secured a $20 million sponsorship from Nu Skin, putting the Olympic name and credibility at the service of Nu Skin’s sketchy products.\n\nHow He Lives Unlike most of Romney’s moneymen, Lund avoids conspicuous consumption. His five-bedroom home in Provo, Utah, is valued at only $263,000. One indulgence: He owns a first-run edition of the Book of Mormon.\n\nTHE TAX DODGER: Julian Robertson Jr.\n\nPosition One of the first hedge-fund titans, Robertson ran Tiger Management Corp. He now takes an ownership stake in new hedge funds, known as “Tiger cubs,” directed by former deputies.\n\nAge 80\n\nFortune $2.5 billion (Forbes rank: 166)\n\nPast Donations More than $1.8 million in lifetime contributions, including $60,100 to John McCain in 2008 and donations to Wall Street-friendly senators like Joe Lieberman and Chuck Schumer.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $1.25 million to Restore Our Future – “one of the most important investments I’ve ever made.”\n\nWhat He Wants Unfairly low taxes. Robertson has embraced tax avoidance as a lifestyle: In 2000, despite living and working in Manhattan, he logged 182 days outside the city – often racing to flee town by midnight – to avoid paying local income tax. Also admits to seeking direct access to the president: “I would expect Mitt Romney to speak to me occasionally,” he has said.\n\nHow He Lives Owns an apartment overlooking Central Park, estates in New Zealand and Long Island, and vacation hideaways in Sun Valley. Beat back a court challenge to his claim of nonresidency, robbing New York of $27 million in city taxes.\n\nGOLDMAN’S SUGAR DADDY: John Paulson\n\nPosition Hedge-fund colossus who profited from the nation’s pain by shorting the housing market before the collapse. “I’ve never been involved in a trade with such unlimited upside,” he bragged.\n\nAge 56\n\nFortune $12.5 billion (Forbes rank: 17) In 2010, Paulson made a record $5 billion haul on Wall Street by speculating on gold.\n\nPast Donations Gave $250,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2010.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $1 million to Romney’s Super PAC. In April, hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Romney at his home in Manhattan that did not appear on the candidate’s schedule.\n\nWhat He Wants No federal restrictions on Wall Street gambling. Paulson was a key player in Goldman Sachs’ infamous Abacus deal. The bank let him pick assets to short, then marketed those toxic securities as high-grade investments. Paulson cleared $1 billion on the rigged deal.\n\nHow He Lives Owns a 28,500-square-foot townhouse on the Upper East Side and a mansion in Southampton worth $40 million. The collapse of the housing market hit him hard: His eight-acre estate in Aspen, which he bought in 2010 for $24.5 million, is now worth only $15 million.\n\nTHE VULTURE CAPITALIST: Paul Singer\n\nPosition Founder of Elliott Management, a hedge-fund firm that buys up “distressed debt” from Africa and South America, then squeezes countries to pay up.\n\nAge 67\n\nFortune $1 billion\n\nPast Donations Has kicked in nearly $9 million total, including $3 million to the Republican Governors Association.\n\nCurrent Donations Gave $1 million to Romney’s Super PAC. Pushed to get New Jersey governor Chris Christie to enter the race, but Romney – whose personal trust has $1 million invested with Singer’s hedge fund – was a clear second choice.\n\nWhat He Wants Needs backing from the U.S. government for his lawsuit to collect more than $2 billion from Argentina. Also loathes the Federal Reserve, which he calls a “group of inbred academics.”\n\nHow He Lives Owns two $9 million ski chalets in Aspen and a luxury apartment on Central Park.
