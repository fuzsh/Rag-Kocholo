        "text": "I’m a classic Republican and he’s a classic Democrat; obviously, President Biden and I usually didn’t see eye-to-eye. I opposed many of his initiatives. But we did find common ground on infrastructure, Ukraine, the Electoral Count Act, adding religious liberty protections to the marriage bill, gun safety measures, and chip manufacturing. Others will judge his presidency. However, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country. Ann and I send warm personal wishes to the President and First Lady.\n\nSenator Romney secured several measures in the 2025 NDAA, which passed the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. The bill would authorize funding levels and provides authorities for the U.S. military and other critical defense priorities, ensuring America’s forces have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out their missions\n\nSenator Romney joined a group of colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) Consumer Protection Branch and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products Director requesting more information about the recently announced interagency task force to combat the illicit sale and distribution of unauthorized e-cigarettes.\n\nSenator Romney joined a group of his colleagues, led by Senator Lankford in sending a letter to President Joe Biden to express concerns regarding his Executive Order that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States."
