        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nFor most, this was no surprise ending.\n\nDuring the Senate trial, Democratic House managers spent days arguing for the conviction and removal of Mr. Trump, claiming his pressure campaign on Ukraine for political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter posed a national security risk.\n\nBut Republicans came to agree with the president's attorneys, who argued that Mr. Trump's actions were inappropriate, but not impeachable, that additional testimony from witnesses with firsthand information, like John Bolton, wasn't necessary, and that to remove a president in an election year was undemocratic.\n\nToday's vote in the Senate to convict or acquit was expected to fall along party lines. But, still, all eyes were on a few moderate senators who had held their cards close until the last moment, among them, Doug Jones, a Democrat running for reelection in deep red Alabama, who, today, stuck with Democrats, voting — quote — \"reluctantly\" to convict the president.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nWest Virginia West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin also sided with his fellow Democrats, saying in a statement that the evidence — quote — \"clearly supports\" the charges against the president.\n\nAnd Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema announced she too would vote to convict, writing that her highest duty and — quote — \"greatest love\" is to the Constitution.\n\nBut it was Utah Republican Mitt Romney, who'd already sided with Democrats in their call for witnesses, who became the first in his party to call for Mr. Trump's removal, voting to acquit the president on obstruction of Congress, but to convict him on abuse of power.\n\nYamiche Alcindor:\n\nThe president has weathered all sorts of scandal and controversy, but impeachment was the biggest challenge yet.\n\nAnd he is very happy now to put that behind him. He is taking a victory lap, saying that he was fully vindicated. He tweeted out this video — hopefully, we can put it up for people — just moments after the acquittal vote.\n\nAnd it shows that President Trump might remain in office well past the constitutional limits. It says Trump 2024, Trump 2100. It also says Trump forever.\n\nThe other thing to note, the president will be speaking at the White House at noon tomorrow. We expect that he is going to say that impeachment was a hoax, that this was a witch-hunt, that Democrats were just after him.\n\nBut, Judy, we have to note that the president can't say this is a partisan vote, because Senator Mitt Romney voted at least with that first impeachment article with Democrats. So he became the first U.S. senator to vote to remove a president of his same party.\n\nThat has President Trump and a lot of his allies very angry. Some are even calling for Mitt Romney to be ousted from the party. President Trump will definitely have a lot to say about that as well.\n\nLisa Desjardins:\n\nThere are certainly some arrows within the Republican Party being aimed at Mitt Romney, but not from his fellow senators.\n\nI have to say, Republican senators speaking to myself, Daniel Bush and Saher Khan, our producer, said they actually respect Mitt Romney, respectfully disagree, is what we heard from them time and again.\n\nWe heard also from Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader that he thinks what Mitt Romney did, and especially his speech, talking about his reasoning, reflects what he believes many Republicans might believe, but actually didn't vote on.\n\nNow, who says whatever everyone believes? But, in the end, given the speeches, Judy, those who voted to convict the president, like Mitt Romney, of any abuse of power, it seemed their argument was, they feel this president thinks he is above the law.\n\nThose who voted not guilty, their argument was that the House's case didn't rise to the level of impeachment.\n\nYamiche Alcindor:\n\nThe president wants to go forward and feels emboldened by this acquittal.\n\nHe now feels that he can do whatever is needed to win the 2020 election. And he and his lawyers have made it clear that he is fine and feels comfortable reaching out to foreign governments, including Turkey or China or Ukraine, to go and pick and look at political opposition research or political dirt on his opponents, possibly Vice President Biden or Bernie Sanders.\n\nSo, what we will see from the president is a continuation of him calling for other foreign countries to give him information on his political opponents.\n\nI also want to read a statement the White House put out tonight. I want to read it to you. It says: \"Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump. One failed Republican presidential candidate\" — talking about Senator Mitt Romney of Utah — \"voted for the manufactured impeachment articles.\"\n\nNow, Democrats, of course, are pushing back on that idea that the president was fully vindicated, because they say, because new witnesses were not called in the Senate trial, and there were no new documents introduced, they say the president actually can't claim that he was fully vindicated.\n\nBut that is not going to stop the president from taking this large victory lap that he has been eager to take ever since word of this whistle-blower was made public. He is now very, very happy to do that, Judy.\n\nLisa Desjardins:\n\nLet's quickly remember what we have all just been through, Judy, since really the late fall, or the early fall.\n\nWe have had 17 witnesses in this impeachment proceedings, 3,000 pages of their testimony alone, nearly 70 hours of public hearings, largely in October of last year. And, of course, we just finished 12 full days, 13 days of Senate trial.\n\nJudy, I think that what we're left with is an exhausted set of lawmakers who may have wrestled with principles. But, in the end, politics seems to reign large at the Capitol.\n\nAnd we saw this in some of the votes. Those swing senators ended up voting with their party. Some of them, that's a risky move. Some of those Democrats who are vulnerable, like Joe Manchin, voted to convict this president, even though that probably is more risky for him.\n\nSo we saw some examples of moral courage, and, of course, Mitt Romney also doing that. But the rest, we saw sort of political winds perhaps helping philosophy and the divide growing deeper."
