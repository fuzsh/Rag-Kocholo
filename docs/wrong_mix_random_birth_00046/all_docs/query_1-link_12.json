        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nAnd to the latest evidence of the role religion may play in the 2012 presidential campaign. It surfaced at a forum for the Republican contenders at the end of last week.\n\nThe spark was struck at the Value Voters Summit in Washington on Friday. Baptist Minister Robert Jeffress of Dallas took the stage to introduce the man he's backing for president, Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nREV. ROBERT JEFFRESS, First Baptist Church of Dallas: Rick Perry is a proven leader. He is a true conservative, and he is a genuine follower of Jesus Christ.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nGov. Perry brushed aside questions on the issue as he campaigned Friday in Iowa. But he issued a statement saying he doesn't believe Mormonism is a cult.\n\nOn the Sunday talk shows, other Republican presidential candidates criticized Rev. Jeffress's statement, but were careful when asked if Romney is a Christian.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH, (R) presidential candidate: None of us should sit in judgment on somebody else's religion. And I thought it was very unwise and very inappropriate.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER, \"Face The Nation\": Well, do you think that Mitt Romney is a Christian?\n\nNEWT GINGRICH:\n\nI think he's a Mormon, and Mormons define themselves as a branch of Christianity.\n\nCANDY CROWLEY, \"State of The Union\": Is Mitt Romney not a Christian?\n\nHERMAN CAIN, (R) presidential candidate: He's a Mormon. That much, I know. I am not going to do an analysis of Mormonism vs. Christianity for the sake of answering that. I'm not getting into that.\n\nMITT ROMNEY:\n\nI do not define my candidacy by my religion. A person shouldn't be elected because of his faith, nor should he be rejected because of his faith. If I'm fortunate to become your president, I will serve no one religion, no one group, no one cause and no one interest. A president must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nNo, there's no indication that the Perry campaign had anything to do with it. As a matter of fact, this is starting to be a problem for the Perry campaign.\n\nI mean, everywhere Rick Perry goes, as we saw a little bit in that piece, he's being confronted with the question: Do you think Mormonism is a cult? I mean, this could be a problem for Perry because there are quite a few evangelicals who think Mormonism is a cult.\n\nAnd so if Perry is going to say, no, Mormonism isn't a cult, well, then indeed that could be problematic because he's going against many of his evangelical base.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nWell, as it relates to the Perry campaign, I think they're going to have to just address it straight on. There was a statement, as you mentioned, put out.\n\nBut I think at some point, Rick Perry — and there is a debate in New Hampshire tomorrow night and one in Las Vegas the next week — at some point, Rick Perry is probably going to have to be pretty strong about it and say, look, I — whether he uses the word distance or whatever word he decides to use, but he's going to have to pretty much make that break if he wants just to put this behind him.\n\nAnd I say him because at this point, with Jeffress tied to Perry, this is something the Perry campaign is going to have to deal with.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nYou know, he really hasn't.\n\nI spoke to him in 2007, when he was governor of Massachusetts. He was just getting ready to run in 2008. And he did talk about it. As a matter of fact, he talked about it at length with me. But in this campaign, in 2012, it hasn't come up at all until this — these comments by the pastor.\n\nAnd, look, I mean, I think Mitt Romney and his campaign would be the first to admit that that's the way it should be, that, in other words, this shouldn't come up and that it's a been-there/done-that story and that this has been vetted, if you will, if that's the correct word, in 2008.\n\nAnd now with the economy taking center stage in 2012, it's time that the train has left the station on this, at least according to the Romney campaign.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nWell, there's a numbers problem for him.\n\nIt's kind of like in kindergarten, where you give everybody else the head-start in the race, and then the person — you know, there's one kindergartner who is far back. This is the situation with Mitt Romney. In other words, the Michele Bachmanns and the Herman Cains and the Rick Perrys are all starting with a lead, if you will, because there's a problem with evangelical voters as it relates to Mitt Romney.\n\nThirty percent, maybe even 40 percent, won't even take a look at him. And so Mitt Romney is at a disadvantage already to begin with. But the good news for Mitt Romney is that, at least what we have seen in 2012, that he's been the most solid candidate of everyone in terms of being able to not make any mistakes and to be able to be pretty adept during those debates.\n\nAnd so he's going to have to be on his game from the beginning for people to take even a second look at him.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nWell, Iowa, it's close to 60 percent. Some will say anywhere from 40 to 60 percent, but really is — if you look at the trend, it's anywhere from 50 to 60 percent for sure.\n\nAnd in South Carolina, it's close to 60 percent. And so if you look at the actual primary states and the calendar that's coming up here, Iowa, South Carolina are two states that Mitt Romney is going to have problems in just to begin with. He needs to do well in New Hampshire — he is — Nevada as well. It all comes down to Florida for Mitt Romney, because the truth of the matter, as it relates to the Mormonism issue, if he can win Florida, it may be a \"train left the station\" scenario and people will get on board.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nWell, I think this is the biggest challenge, Judy, for the Romney campaign if they win the nomination, because we have already heard people like David Axelrod, a few others coming up with the \"weird\" word — and they put that in quotes, that Romney seems a little weird.\n\nWe're already hearing that now. When it comes to the general election, if Mitt Romney is the nominee, you can be sure there are going to be Democratic staffers, liberal staffers somewhere getting ready to release and leak certain memos to reporters about the Mormonism religion. And I think this could be really a potential problem with independent voters come 2012.\n\nDAVID BRODY:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd I think this is the best news of all for Mitt Romney, that it is the economy in 2012. It wasn't the situation in 2008 at all. And the last time I checked, evangelicals, who are social conservatives, are also fiscal conservatives.\n\nAnd the last time I also checked, they want a job just as much as the next person. And so, if Mitt Romney can speak to that, there will be a lot more folks that will not worry about the Mormonism as much."
