        "text": "Former President Trump went after Utah Sen. Mitt Romney (R) and endorsed his possible replacement in a post on Truth Social Saturday.\n\n“Trent Staggs is 100% MAGA, and is running to fill The Mitt Romney, a Total Loser, Seat as the next Senator from the Great State of Utah!” Trump said in his Saturday post.\n\n“A Highly Successful Entrepreneur, who has served brilliantly as Mayor of Riverton for the past six years, Trent knows how to Create Jobs, Stop Inflation, Grow the Economy, and Secure the Border,” Trump’s post continued. “As your next Senator, Trent will help us Unleash American Energy, Support our Military/Vets, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. Trent Staggs has my Complete and Total Endorsement – He will be a GREAT Senator, and never let you down!”\n\nRomney, a frequent critic of Trump, announced that he will retire from the Senate when his term is up in September. He said in a statement that it is time for newer leaders to take the reins.\n\n“I have spent my last 25 years in public service of one kind or another. At the end of another term, I’d be in my mid-eighties,” Romney said in a press release. “Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders. They’re the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in.”\n\nStaggs, the mayor of Riverton, Utah, was the first of multiple Republicans to announce his bid for Romney’s senate seat back in May, and has referred to the current Utah senator as a “Massachusetts millionaire.”\n\nStaggs also welcomed Trump’s endorsement in a post on the social platform X Saturday.\n\n“I’m honored to have the endorsement of Donald Trump!” Staggs wrote."
