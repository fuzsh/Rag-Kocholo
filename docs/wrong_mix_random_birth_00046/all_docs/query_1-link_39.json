        "text": "Mitt Romney swears a strong loyalty and affection for God, is a leader in his church, has raised five sons with his high-school sweetheart wife, doesn’t drink or smoke and is an impeccable capitalist.\n\nHis visit to the Republican Party faithful in Colorado Springs on Wednesday should seem an easy sell filled with symbolic opportunities.\n\nBut Romney has a problem in the conservative Christian capital that is Colorado Springs. He is a Mormon, and many conservative Christians view the Mormon faith as a polytheistic cult – and Mormons as heretics.\n\nMormonism differs from mainstream Christianity in some key ways. Followers believe that all mankind are the siblings of Jesus and that the faithful themselves can become gods. Mormons believe that God and Jesus walk about as physical beings and that Lucifer – or Satan – is Jesus’ younger brother.\n\nSo when Romney addresses the El Paso County Republicans at their annual Lincoln Day Dinner at the sumptuous Broadmoor Hotel, a question will continue to resonate among many of the roughly 600 expected guests: Will they support him in the GOP primary?\n\n“I don’t believe that conservative Christians in large numbers will vote for a Mormon, but that remains to be seen,” James Dobson, founder of the Colorado Springs-based but nationally influential Focus on the Family evangelical ministry, said in a radio interview in October.\n\nThe observation is momentous. Dobson’s first-ever endorsement to the Christian faithful of a presidential candidate is cited by political operatives as crucial to President Bush’s 2004 re-election.\n\nDobson currently is “sequestered,” busy writing his latest book and unavailable for interviews. But a top Focus on the Family official said Dobson’s observation remains valid, despite a recent visit Romney paid to Dobson at his offices this spring.\n\nDuring a round of fundraising in Colorado Springs, Romney spoke with Dobson, Focus on the Family senior vice president Tom Minnery and others for a little more than 30 minutes.\n\n“I believe that Jesus Christ is my savior,” Romney said in a recent interview while on the campaign trail in Helena, Mont. “And while there may be differences in doctrine and are differences in doctrine between my church and other people’s churches, the values that we share are common.”\n\nMinnery said Romney struck them as “very articulate” on political issues.\n\nRomney “asked if he could stop by, and we said, ‘Sure, we’ll see anybody,”‘ Minnery said. “I think it remains to be seen, though, that he’ll be able to overcome the difference with religion. We’re still a long way out.”\n\n“Deep … differences”\n\nBut bottom line, when it comes to Mormon and conservative Christian beliefs, Minnery said: “There are deep theological differences.”\n\nNo less subtle are the origins of the two faiths – which both claim to be God’s “true” religion. Christianity has centuries-old roots. Although Mormons also believe in the Bible, their added sacred texts came from a 19th-century American who translated gold tablets that have since disappeared.\n\nAfter Jesus was resurrected, he came to America, said this original Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith Jr.\n\nJesus, Smith said, came to visit a Jewish tribe that had settled here ages ago.\n\nUltimately, Smith said, God found that Christianity had fallen into a state of confusion, or apostasy, and he spoke through the angel Moroni to Smith in order to recalibrate the faith for the new age.\n\nSuch conflicting beliefs underlie the Focus on the Family officials’ observations – which experts say aren’t at all idle.\n\nResearchers at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life say a survey they conducted in February found that 30 percent of U.S. adults were less likely to support a Mormon for president.\n\nMost of that 30 percent, said Pew senior fellow John Green, are evangelical Christians.\n\n“That’s pretty high,” Green said. “It’s higher than the percentage of voters who said they would be less likely to vote for an African-American and for a woman. … It does suggest that there is some significant challenge to the Romney campaign.”\n\nThe Pew survey found that only 4 percent of adults would be less likely to vote for an African-American, the same percentage of those less likely to vote for a Christian. It also found that 11 percent would be less likely to vote for a woman.\n\nFurther, in the United States, Mormons make up only 1.5 percent of the voting-age adults, Green said, and they tend to be congregated in Utah and surrounding states. Evangelicals make up about 25 percent and are far more widespread.\n\nThe Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of the world’s newest and fastest-growing religions, says it had more than 5.8 million members at the end of last year. The church had 131,241 members in Colorado.\n\nRomney was the top fundraiser in the eight Interior West states in the first quarter of this year. He raised $4.5 million. In Colorado, he is the top Republican fundraiser, totaling $354,225 in the first quarter, trailing only Democrat Barack Obama’s $564,887.\n\n“He’s articulate, he’s got great presence,” said Colorado Republican Party chairman Dick Wadhams. “Any time a Republican can be elected governor of Massachusetts, that’s a heck on an achievement.”\n\nWadhams, who is not endorsing a candidate, hopes that religion will not be a factor in Romney’s candidacy.\n\n“I just find it reprehensible that it would even be discussed,” Wadhams said, adding, “I sense no broad concern about it (in Colorado).”\n\nThe conservative Christian- Mormon dynamic will matter most during the GOP primaries when the conservative base traditionally produces the largest turnout. Most conservative Christians are expected to remain loyal to the party in the general election, making the coming months key for Romney.\n\n“If Mitt is the (Republican) nominee, I think he’ll get a large portion of evangelical votes,” Minnery said. “Now, whether he’ll get as many as he needs to win depends on how he continues to deal with the issue.\n\n“I think he’s doing a pretty good job so far,” Minnery said. “He’s asked people to judge him on how he lives his life and how he leads his family and the decisions he’s made on social issues. From that standpoint, he’s obviously very conservative.”\n\nOld ground for Romney\n\nRomney, 60, remains characteristically upbeat on the Mormon question, and about visiting Dobson’s turf.\n\n“I’ve met with other evangelical Christian leaders as well and have received encouraging results from those meetings,” Romney said. “I fundamentally don’t think that in the final analysis Americans will choose a person based upon what church they go to.”\n\nIn some ways, Romney’s been through this before. When he was only a boy, he watched his father, George Romney, former chief executive of the now-defunct American Motors Corp., make a failed run at the GOP presidential nomination in 1968.\n\n“I read a master’s thesis of someone who worked on my dad’s campaign of 20 reasons why my father lost,” he said. “Among them was not his faith.”\n\nAnd Romney said that direct criticism of his faith at public events has been minimal. The few times it has happened, he said, “I’ll make a comment of the nature that one of the great things about America is we welcome people of all faiths, and generally the audience stands and applauds.”\n\nOutside those campaign stops, however, critics have been more prevalent. In recent months, rival GOP candidates Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani have stepped in to chastise staff for floating attacks against Romney because of his faith.\n\nLDS spokeswoman Kim Farah calls the criticism of Mormonism as a “cult” or of Mormons as “heretics” unfortunate.\n\n“One of our articles of faith is that we reserve the right to worship as we see fit, and we also respect that right in others,” Farah said, adding: “We do acknowledge that we are not traditional Christians.”\n\nOne of Romney’s key strengths is navigating difficult situations. After graduating with an MBA and a law degree from Harvard, Romney made his fortune as a financial consultant first at Boston’s Bain & Co., and then he led the charge at Bain Capital. There he solved problems for major companies.\n\nHis wealth has been estimated to be about $400 million.\n\nAfter making his fortune, Romney famously stepped in and turned around the 2002 scandal-ridden, financially troubled Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Then he went on to win a term as a Republican governor in heavily Democratic Massachusetts. In the Massachusetts election, he battled criticism over his state residency, but not over his religion.\n\nSurveying today’s political landscape, Romney says he hopes to keep the debate framed on values and not on the slippery slope of questioning candidates’ specific religious beliefs.\n\n“I mention frequently that I believe in God,” Romney said. “I believe that we are all children of the same maker. I believe in the Bible.”\n\nRomney said the way he conducts his life should resonate with people of other faiths. He and his wife of 38 years have raised five sons.\n\nMormons are expected to serve a two-year mission assignment proselytizing around the world. Romney interrupted his university studies to comply. He was sent to France to knock on doors for 2 1/2 years.\n\nHe tithes, giving 10 percent of his income to the church each year.\n\nHe has served in several leadership roles in the church in his community. Mormons structure their churches in such a way that church leaders at the local level are unpaid volunteers, according to “A Mormon in the White House?” by Hugh Hewitt. Romney rose through the ranks to his church’s highest position, as president of a “stake” or regional position overseeing several wards with an overall total of about 3,000 members.\n\nRomney believes his faith in God has made and continues to make him a better person.\n\n“People do want to know what my values are, and that’s a totally legitimate inquiry,” Romney said. “And I think that they’ll see with my wife and myself and my children that our values are as American as any you’ll find anywhere in the country.”\n\nBrian Thompson, second counselor in the Columbine Stake Presidency in Littleton, also believes the values are what’s important, not religious affiliation.\n\n“I’d be lying if I didn’t say it certainly caught the attention of most members because he is LDS,” said Thompson, who emphasized he was not speaking for the church. But just because they have religion in common, it doesn’t mean that LDS members will necessarily be backing Romney. “I’m sure even in the Mormon community there’s great debate of whether or not he’d be a great president,” Thompson said.\n\nDifferent views of Jesus\n\nAt a glance, the modern-day LDS church’s focus on the family seems much the same as Dobson’s, but the two faiths operate on separate tracks.\n\nA key difference between the faiths is the interpretation of Christ himself. Conservative Christians believe Jesus is the only son of God, while Mormons believe Jesus to be the first son of a long line of offspring, including Lucifer, who became Satan early on in both faiths. Like Christians, Mormons believe Jesus is mankind’s savior.\n\nMormons believe that spirits are the offspring of gods who create worlds like the Earth.\n\nOn Earth, these spirit-being descendants of God become the offspring of human beings. On Earth, they forget what they knew in the spiritual world, but they are given the free-choice opportunity to follow God, live a faithful and obedient life, and return to heaven at death where they have the chance to become physically perfect beings like God, who, to Mormons, lives as a flesh-and-blood being.\n\nThe polytheistic belief that a perfected Mormon is a god, like God, is heresy to Christians, who hold to the idea God is the one and only god of the universe, and not a partner in creation with other gods.\n\nMormonism got its start in the 19th century, when a young Joseph Smith became its first American prophet. Smith said he received divine revelations and translated golden plates into the Book of Mormon, which became an extension of the Bible.\n\nSmith and his followers were often persecuted, and as their numbers increased, they at times faced murderous hostility. Ultimately, they moved from upstate New York to Missouri, to Illinois and finally to Utah in their efforts to establish a community of the faithful free to worship as they pleased.\n\nSmith taught that as God’s prophet he was able to continue to receive divine revelations, and he recorded several before he was murdered by an angry mob, in part for his practice of polygamy.\n\nAlthough Smith wrote that polygamy was God’s way, and Smith himself is said to have had about 40 wives, the LDS church faced tremendous political and societal pressure over the issue, as well as internal pressure. Eventually, another Mormon prophet reported receiving a divine directive that members practice monogamy.\n\nRomney has ancestors who practiced polygamy, but the candidate said in a GOP presidential debate he considered the practice to be “bizarre.”\n\nThompson believes that Romney’s campaign will expose more people to the LDS church.\n\n“I think (Romney’s campaign) does put the church in the spotlight, and I think it is an opportunity to really share with people what we believe in,” Thompson said. “But I also think that politics at times can be very alienating and this is just a wonderful catalyst, good and bad, for that sort of thing.”\n\nRomney weighs JFK tack\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy faced conservative Christian concerns that the pope would try to direct policy in the White House if Kennedy, a Catholic, were elected.\n\nIn front of the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, Kennedy settled the issue in a historic speech just two months before the general election.\n\n“I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,” Kennedy said, “where no Catholic prelate would tell the president – should he be Catholic – how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him, or the people who might elect him.”\n\nThe speech took a lot of courage, said Thomas Maier, author of “The Kennedys: America’s Emerald Kings.”\n\n“(Kennedy) consulted with a number of different people about it,” Maier said. “He showed it to some theologians to make sure it was theologically well-grounded. He was careful not to distance himself too much from conservative Catholics.”\n\nRomney said he has reviewed that speech and is considering a similar strategy.\n\nMaier said for Romney to replicate a moment like Kennedy’s would share some of the same risks. If he tries to hew a too-stark division between church and state, he’ll lose conservatives who want to see strong values in a candidate. But if he demands too much acceptance of his Mormon faith, he might also alienate them.\n\n“Romney will have to say that the circle of elders will not be consulted on matters of public policy,” said Bruce Ledewitz, a professor at Pittsburgh’s Duquesne University School of Law and author of the book “American Religious Democracy.”\n\nKennedy remains the only non-Protestant to win the presidency. Romney is the fifth Mormon candidate to run for president – and certainly the strongest contender. Joseph Smith declared his candidacy in 1844 but was killed later that year. In addition to Romney’s father, Morris Udall (1976) and Orrin Hatch (2000) also ran.\n\nIf the Mormon question continues to follow Romney, Ledewitz said, “All he has to say is, ‘That’s my religion. I believe in God. I’m a pious and faithful person, and in terms of public policy, I’ll be president of the United States, I will not be a representative of the Mormon Church.’ And that would satisfy most Americans. Absolutely. That’s approximately what most people want.”\n\nLedewitz and many other observers interviewed said, ultimately, Americans don’t really want a critical reading of religion, as sooner or later, the focus would come back to them.\n\nRomney agrees.\n\n“People can ask whatever question they want,” he said. “But I don’t think it would be a good course for any candidate to open the door to detailed discussions of the doctrines of their church or of their spiritual or religious beliefs.\n\n“I think, instead, it’s appropriate to talk in the broadest sense of values, of the common base which is associated with the Judeo- Christian ethic,” Romney said. “And that’s something which I do.”\n\nBarry Osborne of The Denver Post research library and staff writer Sara Crocker contributed to this report.\n\nStaff writer Chuck Plunkett can be reached at 303-954-1333 or cplunkett@denverpost.com.\n\nThis article has been corrected in this online archive. Originally, due to reporting errors, it incorrectly identified one of his father’s positions. George Romney once served as chief executive of the now-defunct American Motors Corp. The story also misspelled the name of Bryan Thomas."
