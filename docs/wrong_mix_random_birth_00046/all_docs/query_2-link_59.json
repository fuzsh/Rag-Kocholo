        "text": "Senator Mitt Romney’s days in the U.S Senate are numbered, but while he is still in office with a bully pulpit, Romney’s using his name to back a candidate in the upcoming 2024 Congressional races.\n\nWhile Romney is not seeking re-election and not endorsing anyone to fill his seat, he is throwing his weight behind a candidate in the Utah Congressional District 3 race.\n\nWednesday, Stewart Peay released a statement from Senator Romney on X formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“I am proud to support Stewart Peay for Congress in Utah’s 3rd District.”\n\n“Stewart is a true American patriot who has served our country and community with distinction. Whether as and Army Officer in Iraq or as a Chairman of the Utah County Republican Party, Stewart has shown the kind of leadership we need in Congress. I am endorsing him because I know and trust him to be a principled and intelligent leader who will bring a valuable national security perspective to Utah’s delegation.”\n\n“He will be an effective member of Congress and is worthy of your support.”\n\nPeay said, “Utah is best served by having principled and pragmatic leaders in our representing us in Washington. Earning Senator Romney’s endorsement in a crowded field will help primary voters know that I share their commitment to traditional values and a strong America. I appreciate he and Ann’s efforts to help my campaign.”\n\nPeay is related to Romney through marriage, his wife is the niece of Mitt and Ann Romney.\n\nThis is Romney’s first endorsement of the election cycle.\n\nRELATED:\n\nRomney announced he would not run for re-election in the fall of 2023. In January 2024 Romney’s staff told 2 News:\n\n“Utah is fortunate to have several candidates who are interested in serving in the Senate, and Senator Romney appreciates their willingness to serve. . . . He is staying out of the race.”\n\nOn NBC’s Meet the Press, Romney said endorsing anyone in 2024 Presidential race would be “the kiss of death.”\n\nJohn Curtis, who currently serves in Utah’s 3rd Congressional District, is now running for Romney’s seat in the Senate.\n\nPeay is in a crowded five-way Republican primary hoping to get his party nod.\n\nJ.R. Bird, Case Lawrence, John “Frugal” Dougall, and Stewart Peay all gathered signatures to get on the primary ballot. Mike Kennedy won the GOP parties official support at the State GOP Convention on April 27th."
