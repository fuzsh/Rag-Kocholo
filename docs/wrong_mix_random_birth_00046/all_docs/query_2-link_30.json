        "text": "On Wednesday, Sen. Mitt Romney announced that he will not seek another term in Congress, likely suggesting that his 30-year career in politics will come to an end.\n\nShortly after Romney announced his retirement, McKay Coppins, a staff writer for the magazine The Atlantic, published the first excerpt of a biography he had begun working on in which the Utah Republican unburdened himself of decades of private thoughts and conversations.\n\nThe section of âRomney: A Reckoning,â slated for release next month, offered a detailed portrait of the senator grappling with his mortality, his legacy and his loss of faith in the party he once served as standard-bearer for.\n\nâA very large portion of my party,â Romney told Coppins, âreally doesnât believe in the Constitution.â\n\nThe revelation about his partyâs loss of loyalty to the Constitution was something Romney said he had only realized after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot â the violent, deadly crescendo of Donald Trumpâs effort to overturn the democratic results of the 2020 election. Trump, his supporters and his allies in Congress were willing to embrace authoritarianism over democracy if it meant they could preserve their power, Romney lamented.\n\nRomney considered for years leaving the Republican Party â all five of his sons had â and âalmost went throughâ with a third-party presidential run, Coppins wrote, but opted not to after concluding he would hurt President Joe Biden, who he was not a fan of, more than Trump in 2024. He had no misconceptions he would win. All he wanted to do was stop a second Trump term and lay out his vision for the country âwithout regard for the political consequences.â\n\nAnd in April of this year, he pitched West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat in a deep red state, on starting a third party to promote centrism and endorse âwhichever partyâs nominee isnât stupid.â He tried to convince Manchin this would be better than running as an independent, something he had discussed with Romney privately, Coppins wote, and has teased publicly.\n\nThe idea may still move into the execution phase, according to Coppins. The last time they spoke, Romney was still âbrainstorming.â\n\nElsewhere in the excerpt, the senator spoke candidly about the colleagues whose allegiance to Trump he found distasteful, cynical and dangerous.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky baffled Romney with his public appeasement of Trump despite calling him an âidiotâ in private. A spokesperson told Coppins that McConnell did not recall the conversation, which Romney said occurred during Trumpâs first impeachment trial, and emphasized the Senate leaderâs loyalty to the former president.\n\nSens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, were among the smartest people in the Senate, âif not the smartest,â but were putting âpolitics above the interests of liberal democracy and the Constitution,\" Romney said. And he recounted that he once asked Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson if there was âany conspiracy you donât believe?â\n\nâI donât know that I can disrespect someone more than J.D. Vance,â Romney said of the freshman Ohio senator, who he viewed as transforming from a thoughtful author who translated the woes of Appalachia to a dogged Trump Republican who degraded himself for political gain\n\nâItâs not like youâre going to be famous and powerful because you became a United States senator. Itâs like, really? You sell yourself so cheap?â Romney told his biographer. âHow do you sit next to him at lunch?â\n\nAnd Mike Pence, Romney said no one was âmore willing to ascribe Godâs will to things that were ungodlyâ than Trumpâs vice president.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, as he questioned his own role in building a party that could so quickly descend into demagoguery and a willingness to dismiss political violence, Romney developed an obsession with a map on the wall of his Senate office that tracked the history of humanityâs empires and great civilizations, Coppins wrote.\n\nTyranny â â a man gets some people around him and begins to oppress and dominate othersâ â was the status quo for thousands of years, Romney concluded. Americaâs democratic experiment âis fighting human nature,â he said.\n\nâThis is a very fragile thing,â he told Coppins.\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2021, Romney was warned by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, that a high-ranking Pentagon official had said the certification on the Electoral College vote, set for Jan. 6, was being viewed as a moment of reckoning by Trumpâs extremist supporters. King told his colleague law enforcement was tracking online discussion of gun smuggling, bombs, arson and punishing the then-presidentâs perceived enemies in Congress â much of which eventually occurred or was attempted during the attack.\n\nAs a critic of Trumpâs, King was concerned for Romneyâs safety. More than two years later, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee is still paying $5,000 a day for private security to protect his family from the supporters of his partyâs presidential nominee in the next two cycles, according to the book excerpt.\n\nAfter his conversation with King, Romney texted McConnell and relayed what King had told him.\n\nâThere are calls to burn down your home,â Romney wrote. âI am concerned that the instigatorâthe Presidentâis the one who commands the reinforcements the DC and Capitol police might require.â\n\nMcConnell did not respond, Coppins wrote."
