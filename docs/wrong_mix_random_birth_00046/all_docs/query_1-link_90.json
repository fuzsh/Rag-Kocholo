After attacking Mr. Romneyâs Republican primary opponents, it has since turned its attention to criticizing President Obama and promoting Mr. Romneyâs campaign.\n\n* The amount raised or spent by this committee as a percentage of the total from the candidate, his national party and primary super PAC. The amount includes contributions and transfers from affiliated committees and excludes non-contributions such as loans, interest and offsets to expenditures.\n\nSource: Federal Election Commission\n\nBy JEREMY ASHKENAS, MATTHEW ERICSON, ALICIA PARLAPIANO and DEREK WILLIS"
