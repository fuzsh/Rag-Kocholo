Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney began a two-day trip to Texas with a stop at a Fort Worth business on Tuesday.

Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, visited Southwest Office Systems, a Hispanic-led, family-run office supply business. A few hundred people cheered Romney on when he arrived.

He talked about the role energy can play in the country's economic recovery.

Romney promised to open up the path for more drilling, new coal plants and stop government from getting involved in fracking technology.

Romney also talked about the role of entrepreneurs, saying they built America's middle class. Romney said he wants to reinspire entrepreneurs to return to the ideals of the nation's founding fathers.

"I think it goes back to the people who crafted this country and said in the Declaration [of Independence] that the Creator had endowed us with our rights -- not the government -- and we are free people because of that," he said.

Two protesters chanting "education, not deportation" briefly interrupted the event. They were immediately removed from the rally.

Romeny will be at a fundraiser in Dallas on Tuesday night. He heads to San Antonio and Houston on Wednesday.

Experts say he could rake in $14 million in campaign contributions.
