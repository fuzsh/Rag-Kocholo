        "text": "Candidates must be faculty members who are eligible to serve as principal investigators engaged in research in the natural and physical sciences or engineering and must be within the first three years of their faculty careers.\n\nDisciplines that will be considered include physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, astronomy, computer science, earth science, ocean science, and all branches of engineering. Candidates engaged in research in the social sciences will not be considered.\n\nThe Fellowship Program provides support for highly creative researchers early in their careers; faculty members who are well established and well-funded are less likely to receive the award. Packard Fellows are inquisitive, passionate scientists and engineers who take a creative approach to their research, dare to think big, and follow new ideas wherever they lead.\n\n$875,000 distributed over five years. Of the $175,000 paid each year, $17,500 is available to the university as compensation for administrative costs.\n\nThe Foundation’s goals and how we carry out our work reflects our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. In 2021, the Foundation piloted a program to offer additional funding support to Fellows for activities that will help increase diversity and representation in science and engineering – whether in their research group, department, university, or scientific fields. An invitation and details regarding this diversity funding support will be shared with the 2022 Fellows at the beginning of their grant period.\n\nOwing to the sponsor's restriction on the number of applications that may be submitted from Duke, anyone wishing to pursue nomination should submit the following materials as one PDF.\n\n1. CV which includes:\n\nComplete contact information\n\nDepartmental and institutional affiliation(s) Please include date of faculty appointment(s)\n\nDisciplinary field(s)\n\nEducational background\n\nProfessional positions held\n\nHonors and awards\n\nCurrent external research support\n\nPublications\n\n2. Research statement: The research statement should describe why the research is important and outline the general goals for the next five years. The statement should also indicate, in general, how funds will be used. This does not need to be a detailed budget and will not be binding on the actual use of funds. The research statement is limited to 1,400 words (maximum two pages of text, prepared in 12- point font with 1-inch margins). If there are relevant figures, images or references, please include these separately on a third page.\n\n3. List of potential support letter writers: Letters of support are heavily weighted in this grant competition. In your internal application, please list up to four potential letter writers who are from outside Duke and personally familiar with your work and creative ability. At least one should be a person who has had no supervisory or collaborative contact with you. Please list their name, title, institution, and a brief description about why you would potentially request their letter. This list is not binding and may be changed should you move forward as a Duke nominee.\n\n4. Publications: List 3-5 of the most important publications on your CV, with a brief description of your role as author/co-author (provides context for Duke’s review committee as author sequence varies by field) and 1-2 sentences describing the publication’s significance.\n\nPlease submit internal materials through My Research Proposal. (Code: ILN) https://www.grantinterface.com/sl/b9xPKz\n\nInstructions for creating an account (if needed) and submitting your materials: https://ctsi.duke.edu/about-myresearchproposal"
