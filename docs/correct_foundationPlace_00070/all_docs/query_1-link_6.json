        "text": "After receiving a record-breaking 700 applications from 80+ countries and regions around the world, the top 30 teams have been chosen to take part in #BeChangeMaker 2024 organized by WorldSkills International, the HP Foundation and UNESCO-UNEVOC. #BeChangeMaker is a virtual social entrepreneurship training program that offers people across the globe the chance to bring their idea for a social business to life. It’s one of the ways the HP Foundation supports HP's goal to accelerate digital equity for 150 million people by 2030. This year’s participating teams have developed innovative business ideas spanning sustainable agriculture, ocean monitoring, inclusive education, and increasing access to medicines for marginalized communities. Over the next three months, they will benefit from tools and technology to support their growth, personalized coaching to help them navigate the challenges of building and scaling a social enterprise, and learning content provided by the HP Foundation’s free business skills training program, HP LIFE. Their journey will culminate in a live final pitch at WorldSkills Conference 2024 in Lyon, France, where the top five teams will showcase their solutions on a global stage. Thanks to all the teams who shared their BIG ideas to change the world and congratulations to the 30 participating teams as they work to build their sustainable businesses! Find out more about the teams: https://lnkd.in/eVvZ9PCU\n\nHP released its 2023 Sustainable Impact Report showing the progress it has made to pave the way for a more sustainable and just future. HP and the HP Foundation believe all individuals should have the opportunity to thrive in our increasingly digital world. Since 2021, HP has accelerated #digitalequity for more than 45 million people, nearly a third of the way to its goal of reaching 150 million people by 2030. The HP Foundation’s HP LIFE program, which enables users to learn in-demand skills free of charge, is one of the ways we contribute to this goal. #SustainableImpact #Skillsforthefuture"
