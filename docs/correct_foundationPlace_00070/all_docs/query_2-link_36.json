Injustices rooted in history still manifest today and make it so that all people don’t have the same opportunities to realize the dreams they have for themselves and their families.\n\nWe have a focused commitment to advancing racial equity in the U.S. and gender equity globally. And through each of our grantmaking initiatives, from reproductive health to ocean and global climate to supporting children and families, we seek to unroot injustices and inequities and reimagine the future.\n\nWe celebrate our diversity among our partners, staff, and peers. Across the range of backgrounds, cultures, and individual people who make up the Packard Foundation, we are united in our mission, vision, and values."
