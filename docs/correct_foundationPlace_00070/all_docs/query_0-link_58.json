        "text": "The David and Lucile Packard Foundation announced Oct. 22 that it intends to commit up to $100 million for the expansion of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. This will be the lead gift in the hospital’s campaign to add 104 new beds to its Palo Alto campus and expand access to state-of-the-art treatments for local children.\n\n“This is a major milestone in our history, and it reflects the enormous faith the Packard Foundation and the community has in our mission and your work,” Christopher Dawes, president and CEO of Packard Children’s, wrote in an e-mail to hospital staff. “As we all humbly celebrate this gift, we also express tremendous gratitude to the philanthropic community: Their continued support is an inspiration to us all.”\n\nWith the existing facility already operating beyond its originally intended capacity, growth will allow Packard Children’s to sustain its mission—to provide the community’s children access to the most advanced cures, treatments, and technologies, performed by the best minds in pediatric medicine, within a family-centered environment.\n\n“This gift is an investment in our children’s health, today and in the years to come,” said Carol Larson, president of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. “As a foundation born out of Silicon Valley, we are committed to making the Bay Area a healthy place for kids to grow up, as well as an innovator in pediatric medicine. That vision is at the heart of the hospital’s expansion, and we are proud to help make it possible.”\n\nHalf of the $100 million total will be designated as a challenge to the philanthropic community to invest in the expansion of Packard Children’s Hospital. The Packard Match will be a “1:2 challenge grant,” with every $2 given by a donor earning $1 of the match.\n\n“My mother would be incredibly proud of the growth we’ve seen at the Children’s Hospital,” said Susan Packard Orr, chair of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. “We are pleased to carry on her legacy by supporting the next phase of the hospital’s development, but we also see this gift as a call to action for our peers. We need the community to join us if we are going to make a real difference in children’s health care.”\n\nThe Packard gift will be yet another achievement in the hospital’s five-year Breaking New Ground Campaign, launched in May 2007. With more families than ever before coming to Packard Children’s for care, the hospital has planned an expansion that will eventually double its size, adding new family-friendly surgical, diagnostic and treatment rooms. Campaign funds also will be applied to training the next generation of pediatric leaders and discovering new cures for childhood diseases.\n\n“We’re inspired by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation’s extraordinary commitment to children’s health,” said Dawes. “This sensational gift, and the gifts that it will engender, will help us redefine pediatric care for the 21st century. With our new facility on the horizon, we look forward to providing even more children and families with access to the best in clinical care, education and research. This would not be possible without the ongoing support of our philanthropic community.”\n\nThe David and Lucile Packard Foundation is a private family foundation created in 1964 by David Packard (1912-96), cofounder of the Hewlett-Packard Company, and Lucile Salter Packard (1914-87). The foundation makes national and international grants and also has a special focus on the northern California counties of San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Monterey. Foundation grantmaking includes support for a wide variety of activities including direct services, research and policy development, and public information and education. Foundation assets were approximately $4.65 billion as of Dec. 31, 2008, and grant awards totaled approximately $342 million in 2008. The foundation expects grantmaking awards of up to $276 million in 2009."
