Employee gift matching programs are the perfect opportunity for your organization to secure more funding from companies with little additional work.\n\nVolunteer Grants\n\nVolunteer grant programs are also known as “Dollars for Doers” programs, and through these programs, employers offer monetary grants to the organizations that their employees regularly volunteer for. It’s the ideal way to combine fundraising, volunteerism, and corporate giving.\n\nMatch More Gifts With Double the Donation\n\nGet a sneak peek of the industry-leading matching gift automation solution, 360MatchPro.\n\nHow to Cultivate Relationships with Companies\n\nThank Them Regularly\n\nYour corporate partners are some of the most valuable relationships you have. Express your appreciation by regularly thanking them. Otherwise, they may feel as if their support is going unnoticed.\n\nGo above and beyond a generic email or a quick phone call by creating personalized thank-you eCards and letters. Backed by eCard recognition tools, you can create visually engaging digital thank-you cards that eliminate the need to mail paper cards and spend extra money on postage.\n\nYou’ll simply design your charity eCards using built-in tools, helping to communicate your appreciation. Depending on your provider, you can add the cards directly to your site on a private page for your leadership to access. Then, when a team member wants to thank a company, they can select the card they want, enter the company point-of-contact’s detail, and add a personalized message.\n\nWhether a company contributes a good bit through matching gifts or regularly sponsors your events, cranking your appreciation up a notch might inspire them to stick around.\n\nInvite Them To Events\n\nIn many cases, your company partners provide in-kind donations and financial support to fund your events, helping cover essential logistical costs. Invite these companies to attend and mingle with attendees and your staff. Even if they’re not sponsoring the event, company leadership might enjoy attending and interacting with your team.\n\nBest of all, eCards lend themselves well to this approach, too. Use your eCard software to create invitations to invite companies to your next event.\n\nReach Out During The Holidays\n\nThe year-end season is a time to express gratitude and reflect on the year behind us. Reach out to your corporate sponsors by giving them a quick call, sending an email, or sharing a festive card. For your particularly generous partners, you might send a gift basket.\n\nIf you take the digital card approach, create a few designs for different holidays, like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Kwanza, and New Year’s. Also, design a general holiday card to cover all your bases. Then, you can select the one that the recipient will appreciate the most.\n\nLetting them know you’re thinking about them during the holiday season is a fantastic way to cultivate your relationship and kick the new year off on the right foot. It may even encourage them to submit any last-minute donations for the year. After all, the holiday season is the most generous time of year. December alone accounts for 30% of all charitable fundraising.\n\nTechnology Companies That Donate\n\nGoogle’s Donation Program\n\nGoogle’s Matching Gift Program\n\nGoogle matches donations (up to $10,000) per employee each year and provides disaster relief/international relief donations for the same amount.\n\nGoogle also matches funds employees personally raise for charitable events, like walks, marathons, bike rides, and any other events where employees are actively participating.\n\nGoogle’s Volunteer Grant Program\n\nTo submit a volunteer grant, employees just need to volunteer at a qualifying nonprofit for at least an hour.

Craft ads focused around your most important pages, such as the donation page for an ongoing campaign, your volunteer opportunities page, information about how to access your services, or articles spreading awareness about important issues related to your cause.\n\nThen, when supporters search a keyword related to your cause, they’ll be shown one of your ads right at the top of their search results.\n\nThe Google Ad Grant is open to nearly all nonprofits, exempting government organizations and educational institutions. Learn how to apply, create ads that’ll get clicked on, and maintain compliance with Google’s regulations by getting help from a Google Ad Grant consulting firm like Getting Attention.
