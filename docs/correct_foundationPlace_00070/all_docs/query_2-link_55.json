        "text": "The Flora Family Foundation makes grants in two categories -- individually sponsored grants and program-related grants. Individually sponsored grants of $25,000 or more must be approved by the Board. These are called Board Grants. Individually sponsored grants under $25,000 are reviewed and approved by the Foundation president, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board. These are called Council Grants. All other grants of the Foundation are approved by the Board through the Foundation’s four program areas: the Gap Program, the Climate Protection Program, the Marine Conservation Initiative and the Black Maternal Health Initiative.\n\nThe Gap Program addresses the gulf in wealth between the world’s rich and poor. The Gap Program supports community-based groups and nongovernmental organizations that seek to improve the lives of the poor in selected developing settings.\n\nThe Climate Protection Program focuses on ways to slow emissions of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere and to speed the transition to a clean energy economy.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Initiative supports research and projects with global implications for ocean health.\n\nThe Black Maternal Health Initiative focuses on addressing the disparity in health outcomes for Black women in California.\n\nThe Foundation has no geographic or subject area constraints on grantmaking as long as the grant opportunities fit the philanthropic interests of the Family Council and meet IRS requirements. By necessity, this open-ended approach requires that all of the Foundation's grantmaking must be done on a strictly invitational basis. We regret that we are unable to consider unsolicited requests for support.\n\nIn its grantmaking decisions as well as in its interests and activities, the Flora Family Foundation is wholly independent of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Hewlett-Packard Company, and the Hewlett-Packard Company Foundation.\n\n2023 Year in Review\n\nAt the beginning of every year, about 60% of the foundation’s grants budget is assigned to individual allocations for grantmaking. Each member of the 33-person Family Council and Board receives the same allocation. The remaining 40% of the grants budget is designated for the foundation’s four program initiative areas ­- the Gap Program, the Climate Protection Program, the Marine Conservation Initiative, and the Black Maternal Health Initiative. Over the course of a year, it is common for Family Council and Board members to commit some portion of their allocations to programs or initiatives. By the end of the year, this typically yields a roughly equal split between individually and collectively sponsored grants.\n\nIn 2023, 135 grants were awarded: 35% of the grants budget took the form of awards sponsored by members of the Family Council, often in co-sponsorship with others, and 65% of the budget was awarded collectively through programs, initiatives, and pooled funds to address urgent issues. Since collective grantmaking has a larger average award size, this data can be viewed through a different lens: 85 grants were individually sponsored (63%) while 50 were collectively sponsored (37%).\n\nThe balance between individual initiative and collective action continues to be a distinctive feature of the Flora Family Foundation.\n\nIndividually-sponsored awards of $25,000 or more must be approved by the Board. These are called Board Grants. Grants under $25,000 are reviewed and approved by the foundation’s president, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board. These are called Council Grants.\n\nGrant Domains\n\nIn 2023, grants related to the environment constituted the largest share of the budget, with 35% of the grant dollars directed to work on environmental issues. This included grants from the Climate Protection Program and the Marine Conservation Initiative. Another 8% of the budget went to organizations involved in food and agriculture, which also relates to the environment. These results continue a trend over the past decade toward increased interest in environmental causes. By contrast, according to Giving USA, only 3% of all philanthropy nationwide is related to environmental issues.\n\nFifteen percent of the budget was awarded in grants related to health in 2023. Health funding includes grants under the foundation’s Black Maternal Health Initiative, which was formally established in November 2021 and had its inaugural round of grants in 2022.\n\nEleven percent of the budget was awarded in grants related to Community Development. These grants largely fall under the Gap Program, which in 2023 supported community-based organizations throughout the Navajo and Hopi Nations.\n\nSeven percent of the budget was awarded in Relief/Emergency Assistance grants in 2023 in response to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, including the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria, wildfires in Maui, wars between Ukraine and Russia and Israel and Palestine, and refugee crises in Sub-Saharan Africa."
