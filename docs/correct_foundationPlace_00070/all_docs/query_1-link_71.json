Listen4Good provides organizations the tools, resources, and coaching they need to implement high-quality, client focused feedback loops that lead to positive changes in decision-making and service-delivery. Core funders, sidecar funds, and other interested funders are invited to participate in Listen4Good by sponsoring organizations’ participation in Listen4Good Online+ ($1,000) or Listen4Good Premium ($6,000), and by sharing learnings with grantees around connecting more meaningfully with each other and the people and communities most impacted by their work. We also encourage funders to provide capacity-building grants, as needed.\n\nThe following are funders that have supported nonprofits’ participation in Listen4Good through past co-funded grant rounds or as sponsors underwriting the cost of L4G Online+ or L4G Premium."
