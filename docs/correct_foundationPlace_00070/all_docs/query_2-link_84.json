        "text": "Based in Menlo Park, CA, the Hewlett Foundation is currently the sixth largest grant-giving foundation in the United States, with assets of approximately $10 billion. William (Bill) Hewlett was a founding partner of the Hewlett-Packard Company which was started in 1939. Longtime supporters of environmental and social-issue non-profit groups as well as the performing arts, he and his wife Flora formed the Hewlett Foundation on November 27, 1966. RAC staff has now processed the first set of records of the foundation (29 cu. ft.), documenting its early history and programs. This collection includes records of the office of the president, board of directors dockets, annual reports, oral histories, and some early grant actions. A finding aid for the collection is available in DIMES, the RACâ€™s online collection database system: https://dimes.rockarch.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/FA1501/FA1501.xml;chunk.id=headerlink;brand=default;query=hewlett&doc.view=collection.
