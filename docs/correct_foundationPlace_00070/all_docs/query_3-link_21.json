At the core of HP’s business model lies its hardware sales strategy.\n\nThe company thrives by offering an extensive range of hardware products, including personal computers, laptops, tablets, printers, and imaging devices. This allows HP to cater to the diverse needs of both individual consumers and businesses, establishing a solid foundation for revenue generation. In addition to its core hardware sales, HP has strategically integrated services and subscription models to deliver comprehensive solutions to its customers.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\nA brief history of HP\n\nHP (Hewlett-Packard) has a rich and transformative history that spans over eight decades, marked by innovative breakthroughs, strategic acquisitions, and successful transitions. The company’s journey began in 1939 when Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in a one-car garage in Palo Alto, California.\n\nInitially, the company focused on producing precision audio oscillators. Their commitment to engineering excellence and entrepreneurial spirit laid the foundation for HP’s future growth and success.\n\nIn the 1940s, HP expanded its product line to include electronic testing equipment, and by the 1950s, the company had established itself as a leading provider of electronic measurement instruments. HP’s instruments were known for their reliability, accuracy, and ease of use, making them popular among engineers and scientists.\n\nThe 1950s marked a significant milestone in HP’s history with its initial public offering (IPO) in 1957. This provided the necessary capital for the company’s expansion and diversification. HP continued to innovate and introduced several groundbreaking products, including its first desktop computer, the HP-85, in 1980.\n\nThe HP-85 was a self-contained personal computer that featured a built-in screen, keyboard, tape drive, and printer. It was primarily used for data processing and scientific applications. The introduction of the HP-85 marked HP’s entry into the desktop computer market and was an important milestone in the company’s history. Prior to the launch of the HP-85, HP entered the computer market with the launch of the HP 3000 minicomputer in 1972 to cater to business customers.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, HP experienced significant growth and underwent various strategic transitions. A Notable acquisition during this period included Apollo Computer in 1989, strengthening HP’s workstation capabilities.\n\nIn May 2002, HP made history with its merger with Compaq Computer Corporation, creating one of the world’s largest technology companies at the time. This transformative move allowed HP to expand its product portfolio and global reach, positioning itself as a comprehensive technology solutions provider.\n\nHP adapted to the changing market dynamics as the technology landscape evolved in the 2000s. The company emphasized services, solutions, and software offerings to complement its hardware business. This strategic shift aimed to provide end-to-end solutions, encompassing consulting, IT infrastructure services, software applications, and managed services.\n\nIn 2015, HP split into two separate entities — HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). HP Inc. retained the personal systems and printing businesses, while HPE focused on enterprise technology solutions and services.\n\nWho Owns HP\n\nAs a publicly owned company, HP Inc. is owned by a diverse group of individual and institutional shareholders who hold its common stock. These shareholders include individuals, mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, and other investment entities.\n\nHP Mission Statement\n\nThe HP’s mission statement is “to engineer experiences that amaze each and every one of our customers.”\n\nHow HP works\n\nHP works through a combination of research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales to deliver its products and services.
