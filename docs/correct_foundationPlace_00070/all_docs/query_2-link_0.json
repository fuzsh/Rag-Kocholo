Institutions at every level are struggling to provide solutions that work for all people.\n\nThe Hewlett Foundation addresses these challenges by harnessing society’s collective capacity to solve our toughest problems — from the existential threat of climate change, to persistent and pervasive inequities, to attacks on democracy itself.\n\nAs one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the United States, we promote constructive dialogue across difference, and we provide reliable, responsive, and strategic support to our partners. Together, we are working to build an inclusive society where people, communities, and the planet flourish."
