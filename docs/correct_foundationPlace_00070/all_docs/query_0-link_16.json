        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEven on the surface, it’s easy to understand why the Midpeninsula is such a sought-after place to live. The region is well-known for its tree-lined streets and variety of historic architecture, and certainly, it’s an understatement to say that word has gotten out about its many high-performing schools and overall great quality of life. But the area is so much more than its (admittedly well-deserved) reputation as an enclave of desirable real estate.\n\nThat’s why Embarcadero Media has launched its new “A Day In” series that explores the history, architecture, points of interest and other unique offerings that set our local neighborhoods apart from one another.\n\nEach month, we will feature highlights from a different neighborhood in either Atherton, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Portola Valley or Woodside for readers to explore using our interactive map."
