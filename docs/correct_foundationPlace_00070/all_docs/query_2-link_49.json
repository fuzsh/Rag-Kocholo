There are many free and affordable resources available online. However, unless your organization is all-volunteer (meaning no staff is paid for their time) nonprofits will require funding to pay for people power in addition to any paid resources needed to train staff and develop a plan.\n\nGeneral support funds can be used for such an objective as can capacity building grants. Both of these types of grants can be used to strengthen an organization’s ability to serve its community more equitably and effectively.\n\nSearching for grants\n\nGoogle can be your friend, however, it is well worth the financial investment to join a grant database or platform. One of the most affordable is GrantStation when purchased through a nonprofit association or through Techsoup (there is an annual sale with even deeper discounts). The Foundation Directory Online (FDO) is a free grant database when accessed through a participating public location like a library or community center. If you are working from home, lack transportation, or are geographically far from a FDO location, paying for a service may be essential to your organization.\n\nGrantStation also offers a free weekly newsletter “filled with the latest information on grantmakers, upcoming grant deadlines, and news that will assist the serious grantseeker”. Sign up here.\n\nLastly, be sure to check the grant databases of local and national banks. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, Chase Bank, Capital One, and more have a philanthropic database of grantmaking clients. Start with the banks where you live and go out from there.\n\nGrants for DEI\n\nWhen searching for grants to support your organization’s DEI initiative, look for foundations that provide General Operating Support, Capital Building, Professional Development, and Diversity.\n\nThe following grant opportunities are a select list of grantmakers that support the development of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Initiatives in nonprofit organizations. Before applying, please ensure the mission of your organization is in alignment with the grant maker’s area(s) of focus and geographic guidelines."
