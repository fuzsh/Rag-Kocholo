        "text": "Director of Development, Mothers & Babies Campaign\n\nLucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health - Palo Alto, CA\n\nThe Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health seeks a Director of Development, Mothers & Babies Campaign to spearhead a best-in-class fundraising program in support of mothers & babies research and treatment, one of the top funding priorities of Stanford Medicine Children’s Health. The Director of Development will partner with colleagues to lead a cohesive and comprehensive strategy to promote philanthropic support for programmatic priorities such as prematurity research, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology, and infertility. The Mothers and Babies Campaign also includes a major capital project to transform the hospital’s original building into a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to labor and delivery. The Director of Development will maintain an active portfolio of donors and scale impact by supporting and activating Foundation colleagues, faculty, volunteers, and institutional leadership to raise funds for these preeminent programs.\n\nThe Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health, in partnership with Stanford Medicine and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, unlocks philanthropy to transform health for children and families in Northern California—and around the world. The Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health is the sole fundraising entity for Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford and the child and maternal health programs at Stanford University School of Medicine. The Foundation is named for Lucile Salter Packard, who committed her life to the well-being of children. Lucile, along with her husband David (co-founder of Hewlett-Packard), were leaders in the development of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, which opened in 1991. In 1996 the Hospital merged with Stanford University Medical Center, and the Foundation was established as an independent public charity to ensure a source of dedicated funding and support for child and maternal health. Governed by a Board of Directors, all philanthropic dollars raised by the Foundation are directed to Packard Children’s Hospital and the Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"At Stanford, we’re all in for mothers and babies. We’re tackling the toughest health problems head on—including infertility, preeclampsia, birth defects, premature birth, and more. We seek a compassionate and mission-driven fundraiser who will embrace and uphold our cultural touchstones and feel inspired by our dynamic, strategic, and results-driven environment. This is a chance to participate in a workplace culture that values and nurtures the positive contributions of all its members and is committed to work/life balance as well as the professional development of each individual to their fullest potential. This is an exciting position to further elevate our founding principles through the power of philanthropy.\" — Jennifer Stameson, Vice President, Major Gifts\n\nFor more information, including core competencies and qualifications, please refer to the full prospectus."
