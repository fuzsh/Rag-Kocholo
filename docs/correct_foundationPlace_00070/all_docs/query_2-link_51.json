        "text": "Bill Hewlett was an active philanthropist as a private citizen in addition to his work through Hewlett-Packard. He and his wife founded their own nonprofit organization, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, in 1966. The organization was dedicated to global environmental, developmental and educational issues, as well as the performing arts (a particular passion of Flora’s). In 1977, the city of Palo Alto gave Bill the Third Annual Distinguished Citizen Award in recognition of his extraordinary efforts. The award came early in Bill’s career as a philanthropist; he would continue to pursue socially responsible projects for another 30 years."
