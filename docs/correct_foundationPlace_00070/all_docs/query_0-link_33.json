        "text": "Executive Director of Development, Major Gifts\n\nLucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health - Palo Alto, CA\n\nThe Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health seeks an experienced Executive Director of Major Gifts to identify, cultivate, and solicit individuals, families, and family foundations with the philanthropic capacity to make gifts of $100,000 to $5M+ to the child and maternal health programs of Stanford Medicine Children’s Health. In this senior role, the Executive Director will serve as the second in charge of the major gifts team, managing three or more experienced campaign fundraisers and partnering with faculty and hospital leaders to identify fundraising opportunities in the areas of cancer, heart, and mothers and babies.\n\nThe Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health, in partnership with Stanford Medicine and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, unlocks philanthropy to transform health for children and families in Northern California—and around the world. The Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health is the sole fundraising entity for Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford and the child health programs at Stanford University School of Medicine. The Foundation is named for Lucile Salter Packard, who committed her life to the well-being of children. Lucile, along with her husband David (co-founder of Hewlett-Packard), were leaders in the development of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, which opened in 1991. In 1996 the Hospital merged with Stanford University Medical Center, and the Foundation was established as an independent public charity to ensure a source of dedicated funding and support for the health of children. Governed by a Board of Directors, all philanthropic dollars raised by the Foundation are directed to Packard Children’s Hospital and the Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"We seek a wise, warm, and tenacious fundraiser player-coach who will embrace and uphold our cultural touchstones and feel inspired by our dynamic, strategic, and results-driven environment. This is a chance to participate in a workplace culture that values and nurtures the positive contributions of all its members and is committed to work/life balance as well as the professional development of each individual to their fullest potential.\" — Jennifer Stameson, Vice President, Major Gifts\n\nFor more information, including core competencies and qualifications, please refer to the full prospectus."
