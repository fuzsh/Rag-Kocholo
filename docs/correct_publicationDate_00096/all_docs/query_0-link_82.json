This file type is not a one-click reading experience such as a PDF or similar. View our ePub Guide to learn more. Once you purchase and then download your file from your confirmation email from us, you will not be able to immediately open and read it without one of these apps or services.\n\nNote: Kindle readers can and should purchase ePub files to read on their Kindle devices or via the Kindle app. As of August 2022, Amazon no longer supports mobi files.\n\nDavid Gerrold is the author of numerous television episodes including the legendary “Trouble With Tribbles” episode of “Star Trek.” He has also written for “Land of the Lost,” “Babylon 5,” “Twilight Zone,” “Sliders” and other series. He has published 45 books, including two on television production. He taught screenwriting at Pepperdine University for two decades. He has won the Hugo, the Nebula and the Locus award. A movie based on his autobiographical novel, The Martian Child, is now in production."
