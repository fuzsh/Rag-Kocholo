        "text": "\"Hella\" by David Gerrold (DAW Books, 364 pages, in stores)\n\nFans of \"Star Trek\" may remember David Gerrold's name as the creator of the award-winning \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" episode, or the book \"The Martian Child\" which became the 2007 movie of the same name starring John Cusack.\n\nThere's a lot more that Gerrold may be known for. \"When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One\" is one of my favorites among his science fiction works.\n\nBut other than his \"The War Against the Chtorr\" series about the invasion of Earth by alien fungi, I have not read much of his more recent work — which I can admit has been my loss.\n\nFor example, I have discovered Gerrold's Dingilliad trilogy of young adult novels continues the story of H.A.R.L.I.E., an artificial intelligence, in a supporting character role. I will have to acquire those books and probably reread the original story again, to renew my acquaintance with H.A.R.L.I.E.\n\nBut first, there is Gerrold's latest novel to hit print, \"Hella,\" which is quite possibly the best thing he's written yet (bear in mind, however, there is a bunch of his oeuvre I have yet to devour).\n\n\"Hella\" is narrated by Kyle, who would be about 13 years old if he were on Earth, but instead he is living on the colony world called \"Hella.\" The planet is larger than Earth but has less mass, so its gravity is less. Its orbit is farther from its sun than Earth's, so when it gets cold there, a carbon dioxide frost sometimes forms when there is no moisture left in the air.\n\nThe planet has its own eco-system, with dinosaur-like creatures, tree-like beings that are neither plant nor animal, and actual trees that grow to a height that would make Earth's giant redwoods look like twigs of grass in comparison.\n\nBecause of its lower gravity, everything is bigger on Hella. Especially the storms.\n\nKyle has what is referred to by others in the story as a syndrome. As a result, a chip was implanted when he was young that let him communicate with the colony's internet system, facilitating his ability to understand and communicate with others. He isn't stupid — far from it! He just doesn't see things the way everyone else does.\n\nBecause of his ability to pick up on details that others just sort of gloss over, Kyle is selected to produce a series of videos that will help newly arriving colonists understand the dangers as well as the beauties of their new home world.\n\nA fair portion of the story is Kyle's description of the world where he and several thousand other refugees from Earth are attempting to make their home. Fans of the movie \"Avatar\" who read \"Hella\" will want to see it spring to life on the big screen as well — on IMAX, of course. Anything else would be too small.\n\nBut life is not all dino-things and movie-making for Kyle ...\n\nHe is the victim of a bully, who is the offspring of one of the colony leaders.\n\nThere is a plot underway to overthrow the leadership and take the colony in a new direction.\n\nThere are people aboard the colony ship who will be familiar to fans of the Dingilliad trilogy.\n\nKyle hears from one particular occupant of the colony ship who goes by the name of Harlie, no last name.\n\nKyle learns what chocolate tastes like for the very first time (you may want to have a candy bar standing by for this one).\n\nAnd Kyle appears to be entering puberty in a society where sex changes are matter of fact and he contemplates whether he wants to remain male or go back to being female, as originally born.\n\nScience fiction fans who have read all of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile works and longed for someone else to have picked up the mantel, have probably already discovered Gerrold. But if you haven't, then reading Gerrold's \"Hella\" is a hella good place to start. (He uses the \"hella\" word play several times in the story — it's how the planet Hella got named in the first place.)\n\nOne more thing about \"Hella\" — I don't believe I've ever taken anyone's characters out of a book I was reading and subconsciously planted them somewhere else, but while taking a break from reading and actually catching a little sleep between chapters, I found my dreams attempting to continue the story. Yes, in my dreams, I was on Hella, with Kyle and Harlie and the bully and a number of other characters. \"Hella\" became a part of my life outside the pages of the book.\n\nIt's that good. It's hella good!"
