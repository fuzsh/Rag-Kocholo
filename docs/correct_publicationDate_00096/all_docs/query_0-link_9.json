        "text": "a bit of HAL 9000 here\n\nI like when the classic scifi shows up and this was good, though it is perhaps a little dated. But not so much by technology as by all the computer intelligence references in pop culture, e.g. HAL 9000, DATA from pepsi generation, Matrix, etc. What surprised me was not that aspect so much because the story is actually about more than just AI, but that Gerrold rewrote the novel to update it due to tech advances and AI advances etc. and yet didn't incorporate an audio-visual input/speech device for the computer, but still had all communication done via keyboard. This is a minor thing but it does come to mind when you're listening. I also found it interesting that originally this was written AFTER 2001 & HAL 9000 and in a sense almost dated itself from day one.\n\nNow, this being said, it is still a good novel and I like much about it, but it is not a whiz bang story and much more of a thinker posing ?s about what it means to be human as he tries to explain to Harlie various things. So that aspect of it I like very much and the idea of individual personalities and threats against them always affects me.\n\nSo while I can't say I loved it like Zanzibar recently, I am glad I got another classic in my head and there is a lot of very good corporate vs. science and humanity stuff that builds up.\n\nSkip author’s preface!!!\n\nI wish I had skipped the author’s preface before the story. It adulterated how I would have organically experienced the story and characters. Listen to it after if you want to hear it.\n\nHaving said that, I loved the story. Rolled my eyes many times at the “love” parts.\n\nDavid Gerrold’s reading got monotone sometimes but the story is still very enjoyable.\n\nComputer, human or God\n\nA beautiful performance by the author himself of one of my favorite books. I can be difficult to follow and I admit that it probably won't appeal to the majority of traditional science fiction fans but if you can get through lengthy discussions on the nature of life, reality and what it means to be sentient you will find a surprisingly touching story of a computer named HARLIE learning how to be alive and a man named Auberson learning to appreciate the unique friendship that computer provides."
