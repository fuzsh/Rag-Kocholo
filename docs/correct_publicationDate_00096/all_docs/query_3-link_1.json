        "text": "October 25, 2007\n\nThis is one of the earliest stories of intelligent computers, anticipating much of the work of Vinge, Gibson, and many others since. It followed The Moon is a Harsh Mistress in which a computer just \"comes alive\" once its complexity passes a certain point, but Harlie was designed from the beginning to be intelligent.\n\nThis alone would make it worth reading -- it is interesting to compare its vision of computing and artificial intelligence with the actual evolution of computing and the Internet, to gain an appreciation of both the similarities and the fairly radical differences. However, it is also a great story in and of itself. There is greed, conflict (non-violent conflict, mind you, nobody is injured or killed) and even depth. A classic of Science Fiction, worth reading and even re-reading many times...\n\nrgb\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nI wonder what the revised edition is like. Better beginning? Bowdlerized beginning? Updates to tech and/or science? Different fonts for Auberson's input and HARLIE's output? Any number of other possibilities?\n\nIn any case, yeah, I did not like the beginning. But I persevered. And am enjoying it immensely as it gets more and more thoughtful.\n\nI particularly like the complementary definitions of love arrived at about 3/4 through. They explain how one can fall out of love, for no good reason, and not have to deny that what they had experienced was love. That is to say, many of us feel that \"Oh I don't love them anymore, so it must not have been real,\" but Gerrold gives us a theory that lets us remember past loves with fondness and respect.\n\nAnd, yes, the book does go into love a lot. It's not a romance, but there is a bit of a love story, and a bit of gentle erotica, and some soul-searching, and a lot of theoretical discussions. So if you don't like to think about mushy stuff, skip this.\n\nIt's also a fairly old book, so if you can't suspend disbelief about alternative developments of technology, skip it.\n\nIf you're looking for adventure, skip it. Corporate machinations provide what 'thrills' there are here.\n\nBut I enjoyed it very much.\n\nI enjoyed exploring all the different themes relating to sapience, what it means to be human, the definitions and values of religion, and friendship, and love. And authenticity, honesty, and sanity, too. There's a lot to think about, to assess against one's own philosophies, in this fun little ol' SF novel.\n\nEthics are not the same as morals: \"Morality is an artifice--an invention.\"\n\nHARLIE seeks \"a religion/morality system that will help a person cope with life, not death. If a person can cope with life, death can take of itself. That would be a true religion.\"\n\nWhen did hackers first infect computers with viruses? They are explained here, in 1972....\n\nH. observes that \"Once you understand the animal that is the root of man, you can go on to understand the man that is the best of the animal.\"\n\nDecember 14, 2019\n\nStoryline: 1/5\n\nCharacters: 1/5\n\nWriting Style: 2/5\n\nWorld: 1/5\n\nWhat makes science fiction so wondrous are the ideas. Good science fiction can take those ideas and do something good with them. Good science fiction leads to new, interesting questions and possibilities. It explains the mechanics of or significance of abstruse topics. It throws the ideas into fun adventures, giving them a role. Gerrold had the big ideas part of science fiction down. But nothing was done with them. There is no adventure here. Difficult topics are not successfully explained. New questions and possibilities never follow from the premise.\n\nThere was some effort at the last of those. Gerrold, however, never seemed to be able to commit to an idea or to a question. At some points in the story we are led to discussions about sentience, while at others it was love. In some portions of the story the idea under investigation was truth, elsewhere it was sanity. The circumstances had not changed. We still had the same characters. Gerrold is simply unsure of what questions or possibilities follow from his initial big idea.\n\nThe author does have some sort of conclusion. A goal, perhaps. One based on optimism of technological progress and a belief in the greatness of science. The problem with taking this seriously as a reader is that – as with his big ideas – Gerrold never convincingly persuades the reader that he is one with good insights or answers. The reason for hopping around to so many new, partially-formed ideas is that Gerrold does not seem to know about the things he’s writing about. The author does not appear to either informed or articulate. That was particularly problematic for a book that had such weak characterization (a psychologist who does not appear to know any psychology, a renaissance man who never showcases his knowledge) and limited drama (here too, Gerrold had difficulty with committing to a decision).\n\nWhat the book does have going for it is that it anticipated some technological developments in the future. I’ve not seen an earlier and more accurate description of the internet. Gerrold published this in 1972! Probably, some of the descriptions of computers and computing possibilities were really cutting-edge. Some might even argue that cyberpunk starts here. It is scarcely recognizable, but so many of the elements of that future genre (which William Gibson would get recognition for founding 12 years later) are present here. So perhaps I do him some disservice, and this was more revealing and thought-provoking than I give it credit for. It did not age well though, and I just cannot find a way to enjoy this from the vantage point of early 1970s readers. Too much of what was probably novel is taken for granted today. I found little else to appreciate.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nExcellent exploration into the nature of individual's humanity, and beyond. Wonderfully engaging - as well as highly entertaining - with its string of compelling debates and speculation.\n\nData, the origin story. I'm convinced. In which case Gerrold is owed much greater recognition in the Trek sphere, than just what is owed for their potentially greatest impact/legacy on TNG being rejected with Blood and Fire.\n\n(My enjoyment of this has been recorded with lengthy quotes in the reading updates below).\n\nJuly 31, 2017\n\nHuh. This is one I've known of for a long time but had never read. It was written in 1972 and a bit earlier and definitely shows it's age and in a number of ways. Starting with type to a computer and it types back - and in all upper-case. And roles of women. And the idea of limited numbers of big computers rather than huge numbers of small computers. But in many ways this book was right on the mark in concept. But mostly this was a philosophical chat on what it means to be human and on love and sex. In fact way too heavy on the chat and not enough on the action. But interesting to see actual sex in a relatively early sf book as well as male homosexuality discussed in a positive manner.\n\nSeptember 4, 2015\n\nEver since I started working at the book store, I check the shelves each week to see if there are any donated David Gerrold books. I have all of his books, but I'm always curious to see if any show up on the shelves. Last week HARLIE showed up. I hadn't read it in many years, so I made that my book to read while working. It was when the psychiatrist David Auberson started explaining this new concept of \"computer VIRUS\" to his co-worker that I checked to see when it was published: 1972, two years before Bill Gates founded Microsoft, when Walt was learning FORTRAN and I was convinced I would never be able to learn to use a computer. So much of this book needs to be viewed from an historical viewpoint.\n\nH.A.R.L.I.E. (Human Analog Replication Life Input Equivalent) is an early form of artificial intelligence. HARLIE is a human brain, the most intelligent in the world with the power to design a G.O.D. machine, which will pretty much take over the world, but benevolently. Only for good. It will solve all of the world's problems. There's a lot of tech in here, but it's more than strictly a lesson in technology. HARLIE is perhaps his creator's (Auberson) best friend. They have very long philosophical discussions about things like the meaning of life and how you know you're in love, a sensation HARLIE can't experience because he has no sense of touch or feeling.\n\nThe plot concerns the owners of the company which owns HARLIE who feel he is a drain on resources and want to shut him down. Can Auberson and HARLIE prove that the computer can have financial worth before they pull the plug. And is HARLIE capable of deception if necessary to save his life?\n\nWhat I love about all of David's books his his eloquent language and his ridiculous jokes and puns. Everything he writes has a bit of tongue in cheek about it. This book was updated in 1988 to \"Release 2.0\" but I have not read that one.\n\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nWhen HARLIE Was One is brilliant, hilarious, and ground-breaking in every respect, especially in the way Gerrold intertwines philosophical insight with computing possibilities.\n\nMy only gripe is the sole female character, Annie. I wish, in 1972, it had been possible for Gerrold to write a gay love story between Auberson and Handley into this book instead of the laughable straight relationship between Auberson and Annie. (Seriously, women don’t find male genitalia velvety and beautiful like Annie does. Not. At. All.) There are wonderful nods at homosexuality and gender non-conformity as HARLIE tries to figure out his own identity, and I wanted so much more of that.\n\nI haven’t yet read Gerrold’s revised version of the novel, HARLIE 2.0, but I assume it maintains the same relationships, just with updated tech. But maybe now it’s time for HARLIE 3.0?\n\nFebruary 16, 2014\n\nNot as good as the original. Interesting alternative ending, but the original I liked better.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nI don't normally put blurbs in my reviews, but just in case this gets lost from the book page, I'd adding it here. It's got so much helpful information.\n\n---\n\nWhen HARLIE Was One is a 1972 science fiction novel by David Gerrold. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1972 & the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1973. The novel is a fix-up of previously published short stories. A revised version, subtitled \"Release 2.0\", was published in 1988.\n\nCentral to the story is an Artificial Intelligence named H.A.R.L.I.E., also referred to by the proper name \"HARLIE\"--an acronym for Human Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).\n\nHARLIE's story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson, the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood into adulthood. It's also the story of HARLIE's fight against being turned off, & the philosophical question whether or not HARLIE is human; for that matter, what it means to be human.\n\nThe HARLIE intelligence engine appears in a number of Gerrold's other works, including the Star Wolf series, where it is routinely installed as the administrating AI of Terran warships.\n\n---\n\nYes, I read 'Release 2.0' and am very glad I did. I read the preface, too, and am glad I've forgotten my read of the original. Yes, it's very much a philosophical read. That is, the main thing it's about is the ideas, and then the characters insofar as what they represent. The plot itself is rather thin.\n\nWhat I felt from it is a reminder of Flowers for Algernon. That book is a brilliant tearjerker, this is funnier and, tbh, weaker. But they both have the theme of examining sapience. And they both have a vibe of melancholy under their stronger vibes. And they both address the issue of the entity's right to its own identity.\n\nOne of the discussions I liked was about the difference between morals and ethics. HARLIE has the latter, not the former.\n\n\"You can't bludgeon people with truth. The best you can do is give them space to discover it for themselves.\" (Unfortunate but true, yes.)\n\nAugust 30, 2022\n\nThis is a dry, dense read. Almost the whole thing is told through conversations and introspections. There's no action and very little scenery change. Almost every scene takes place at either the lead's job or his apartment. Visually, it's dull. There's little to conjure up in your mind.\n\nBut if you're interested in a deep-dive into AI concepts, there's a lot of value here. Heavy ruminations on God, love, and existence as Harlie, a supercomputer that thinks like a human, must prove his worth to the company that built him, or be destroyed. There's a heavy focus on how a completley stationary machine might perceive the world, it's boundaries, and it's own place within. It's very thorough for its time. Much more zoomed-in on the details than anything else I've read about AI personalities and potentialities.\n\nThere are some brief skimmings over ideas about sexuality and gender identity. I would have loved more on these topics. But I get it, it's the 70s. You can't hit people with too much norm-breaking at once.\n\nThere is one female character in this story. She's the love interest. That's here purpose. She's there to create a contrast of (very descriptive) physical contact between a human who loves a human, and who also loves an AI. This allows for some interesting bits on sex and love.\n\nBut she's also a secretary. This is becoming something of a joke to me. Men will envision any kind of future, but cannot see women doing things that aren't being a secretary. You know what my mom was doing in the 70s? She was a police officer. Women did other things, even at the time these books were written. But they are ALWAYS secretaries! The character is otherwise handled okay, and the candid look at sex from a more mutually appreciative point is refreshing.\n\nThe main topic isn't spoon fed to you. Gerrold presents an AI that has the potential to become humanity's master. He stops short of telling you whether that's good or bad. That's for you to think about. He only tells you it's inevitable.\n\nMay 1, 2021\n\nI often read science fiction and came across many authors but I wasn't aware at all of David Gerrold before reading this book as part of a collection. A pity since he stands out among his peers in the way he's approaching writing science fiction. While science fiction usually is about plot and world-building, Gerrold is giving us ideas.\n\nHarlie is one of the early cognizant AI's. 2001's HAL was already around but Harlie can stand on his own. In fact, I would wager that Douglas Adams read this book before creating Deep Thought. Harlie designed the computer that follows him a decade before Adams' Deep Thought. But Harlie isn't about humour. Harlie conducts long winding conversations with his project lead David Auberson, a psychologist. They revolve around love and religion as essential human traits separating man from machine.\n\nBy focusing on philosophical issues, Gerrold avoids the trap of obsolescence which so many SF stories from the past fall into. It shows that he put a lot of thoughts he was turning over in his head into this book. Some of them are out of place like his thoughts on his own homosexuality which are a long stretch in the context of the interaction between man and machine but for the early 70's these thoughts are extraordinary nonetheless. SF certainly gave more freedom than other forms of writing. Delany's Dhalgren comes to mind.\n\nWhere Gerrold fails the same way as is common in SF is in developing his characters. The interactions lack cohesiveness and the crucial relationship between the main human protagonist and his love interest is described weakly. Nonetheless, When Harlie was One is a recommended read for anybody who likes SF because of ideas and not of plot. Speaking of ideas, this novel is probably the first book in history that mentioned computer viruses.\n\nJune 13, 2018\n\nProbably groundbreaking when it was released, it feels a little long in the tooth now and despite the update the sci-fi is clunky in parts and there are long sections spelling out what is obvious now but would have been new back when this was written. An interesting philosophical look at AI and how they could be human, with some stilted humour, corporate intrigue and a love interest to add spice to it all.\n\nRead\n\nMay 2, 2023\n\nDNF. Far too intellectual an enterprise for me.\n\nMarch 30, 2012\n\nI read the \"Release 2.0\" version.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to point out that little emote-phrases were included by Gerrold back in 1988. *grin*\n\nAnyway, this was another very different, but very good book by Gerrold. I'd normally avoid books about AI (a bit too cliche for me). Maybe it's because of far too many cheesy 70s & 80s movies from my formative years...the computer is my best friend, until I get a girlfriend...the robot started killing everyone on the ship after the female lead showed it some kindness...Think I'm kidding? Watch Saturn 3 and you'll cringe on your couch. But I figured \"Hey, it's Gerrold, it's gonna be good\". And honestly, after reading this I can't imagine anyone really adding anything; this covered the subject really well. A great read.\n\nOne of the things I love about Gerrold is his ability to mix philosophy and humor in the same paragraph (like in the quotes above). The humor usually catches me off guard, because I'm busy thinking about the insights. He also approaches things well -- many sci-fi authors, even those I love, have a tendency toward a preachy tone when they get philosophical. But Gerrold presents it more like \"did you ever think about this?\", and it just works.\n\nLike Star Hunt, this was a revision of one of Gerrold's older books (the 1988 date I cited above was for the revision, the original was 1972). The reviews I read liked this version better, even though it was the original version that was a Nebula and Hugo nominee. The revision was marketed as having \"incorporated the latest information on computer technology\", but the reviews I read stated that the interactions with HARLIE were a bit better in this version.\n\nJuly 4, 2017\n\nAn enjoyable mesh of science fiction and philosophy. HARLIE is the first AI computer and HARLIE and the director of the operation that created him, David Auberson, spend part of this novel conversing via teletype machines on the philosophy of life and, more so, love. Along with the big questions of why are we here and why do spend so much time accumulating digital watches. It is also a story of intrigue as Auberson and his colleague Don Handley race to fight a board of directors intent on shutting HARLIE off for being non-profitable. But Gerrold uses this frame work as a jumping off point to explore many other ideas. The character Handley expounds at great lengths on computer viruses, what they are and how they promulgate through a system. Yeah, BFD, right? Except this book was published in 1972 some 14 years before the first computer virus was written, according to most sources. So yeah, interesting ideas here on the tech of computers and even a fairly convincing idea of why they communicatie with HARLIE via teletype as opposed to voice. A very satisfying read and fun as well. If you love science fiction you should consider this time well spent.\n\nJanuary 19, 2012\n\nI read R1.0 a long time ago, and there were lots of interesting philosophical bits in it. In addition, now that I program electronics, the whole notion of more inputs create better results is very relevant to me. And the irony of the ending is priceless.\n\nI just discovered that They'd Rather Be Right has a similar premise. I haven't read it yet, and the reviews are poor. I wonder if DG read this at some point.\n\nJune 17, 2019\n\nI got into this book very excited for it. My dad recommended it to me and the first chapter made it seem like it was a good mix of scifi and philosophy. Unfortunately this book was just so dense that I had trouble wanting to pick it up. For me, there was way too much philosophy and not enough scifi/action. There was not enough character development and not enough of the problems with HARLIE were ever addressed. The romance also seemed very out of place- like the publisher made the author throw it in to attract a wider audience. Definitely not my cup of tea.\n\nAugust 21, 2019\n\nThe title character is an intelligent computer, and the book includes long discussions with that computer about God, morality, love, and other issues which look an awful lot like the author getting on a soapbox. They add little to the plot and, worse, say nothing original. The climax of the book is a four day long corporate board meeting, which tells you something about how exciting the plot gets. And the ending, by suggesting that HARLIE might not really be as he was portrayed throughout the book, undermined any appreciation I had for him.\n\nMarch 26, 2020\n\nDiese philosophischen Unterhaltungen zwischen Harlie und Auberson ziehen sich schon seeehr. Natürlich verstehe ich, dass das zu der damaligen Zeit revolutionär war, sich eine KI zu denken, die sowas kann. (Heute ist sowas in viel nähere Zukunft gerückt, aber längst nicht erreicht!!) Dennoch wäre es für den Fluss der Ereignisse oft nicht so ausgiebig nötig. Die Liebesgeschichte ist auch nicht wirklich ausgearbeitet, sie dient nur dazu, dass mit Harlie auch \"Liebe\" diskutiert werden kann.\n\nLetztlich habe ich das Buch nur wegen seiner historischen Bedeutung fertiggelesen.\n\nSeptember 2, 2017\n\nI love stories about robots and AI psychology scifi but this was a little too dry for my taste. Harlie seemed to be more of a soapbox for the author to project his views on the nature of existence than a character. Also while the conversations between David and Harlie were at least a little engaging, they are broken up by really pointless meetings between David and Dorne or his other skeptical cowokers pleading for answers or a confirmation of a return on investment.\n\nOctober 31, 2020\n\nBesides this book being one of the first to introduce the concept of a computer virus, it is a fine piece of human-computer interaction. The reader, like the main character, tries to understand the computer, but never really manages to do so. As a matter of fact, it seems that any interpretation of the computer's behavior is wrong, and the main character does not have any grip on it, while he has the illusion he is interacting with it on an equal level.\n\nWhile there is little actual character introduction (for example, all character traits and interests are pretty much limited to their role in the story, as is the love element), one element that is charming is the fact this book is a sci-fi clearly written before the digital age. Digitization, data mining or even internet are not present, which allows the story to focus on its essence and not be distracted by many of the issues we have in this day and age.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nA good book, the entirety of my enjoyment stemming from the interactions with HARLIE. He’s a very lovely, endearing AI and an absolute asshole in that cold, logical ways AIs often are. It follows the politicking of scientific pursuits vs profit interests of the company that created HARLIE, and the fight to keep him alive and prove his worth.\n\nAuberson as a protagonist is a bit exhausting at times and when left to his own devices, becomes a disconnected part of the story that spouts revelations this way and that, that feel separate from the story and are more so the philosophical realisations of the author instead of from a character in his own right. Poor Annie deserved far better than to be a device for Auberson to realise what love is. This book, as a whole, does sometimes suffer from ‘head up its own ass’ syndrome.\n\nHowever, it is still an enjoyable book and definitely worth the read if you really like AIs like I do. HARLIE is a wonderful delight.\n\nApril 27, 2021\n\nA decent read. Very groundbreaking at the time it was written but quite dated in this day and age. The writing was reasonable but the characters were fairly wooden and the dialogue rather laughable at times. Some authors suffer from the inability to create realistic characters and I'd say this is the case here (altho I must say that this is the only book by Mr. Gerrold that i've ever read, maybe he gets better, who knows). I must admit that Harlie is quite well done tho and often humorous. I actually found myself caring how things turned out for him. I see that this book was revised and apparently ended differently (?). I can only comment on the original version. It's not a bad read but i doubt that people reading this today will like it anywhere near as much as they might have back in the 70's. If you're an old schooler, maybe give it a whirl. 3.5 stars.\n\nDecember 17, 2022\n\nOne of the seminal works of AI sci-fi, and still one of the absolute best. Originally written in the early 70's and updated in this late 80's version, some of the technology is of course a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite nicely, and a lot better than many more recent offerings.\n\nEvaluated just for its historical value, the book covers everything from computer viruses to Big Data, to modern search engines, and contemplates the implications of the Singularity (although that term doesn't appear). Along the way, we are treated to Deep Discussions about Life and Love and Existence.\n\nAlthough dialogue heavy, the pace is lively and the banter witty, leading to informative, thoughtful, and entertaining conversations. The plot seems a bit unoriginal, but only because it's been copied so many times, and has just enough going on to keep things interesting.\n\nJuly 17, 2019\n\nA thoughtful, philosophical sci-fi classic of (artificial) intelligence . . .\n\nFirst released in 1972, revised in 1988, David Gerrold (probably most famous for \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" on Star Trek, but I think his best work is the \"War Against Chtorr\" series) imagined the implications of the world's first true artificial intelligence, and the nature of consciousness, love, faith, and so much more - still great, decades later!\n\nAugust 25, 2017\n\nVelmi zajímavé myšlenky a leckdy pěkné, svižné dialogy.\n\nAle zápletky málo a její směřování mi nebylo úplně zcela po srsti. Že je knížka po technické stránce trochu zastaralá by mi oproti tomu asi zásadně nevadilo - leda by to souviselo s těmi hlubokými sondami do korporátní politiky, které bych si... no, asi odpustila.\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\n50 year old book about creating an AI called HARLIE. Although heavily capsed (because of a typing interface to the computer), it's a fantastic read about the robopsychologist David Auberson and his philosophical discussions with HARLIE, on everything from the meaning of life, to morals and ethics, love, death and personhood.\n\nJune 26, 2018\n\nFor a book written almost 50 years ago it was prescient in the problems we will face when we can build an artificial intelligence. It is also an interesting read on what makes us human and why we are the way that we are."
