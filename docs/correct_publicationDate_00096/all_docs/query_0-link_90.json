The colonists who have come here need to hibernate twice per year to escape the blistering heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. Kyle is a neuro-atypical young man, emotionally challenged, who has an implant in head head that give him access to the colony’s computer network. He gets notice that an overburdened starship is on their way, and that he’ll need to be the link between the colonists and the refugees. However, the colony is barely self-sufficient and could struggle with all the new arrivals. Kyle finds himself in the middle of it all as he’ll need to guide the colony away from disaster.\n\nUnder the Eye of God is the first book in the Trackers series of books. The story follows a race of genetically engineered killing machines known as the Phaestor and their army of deadly Moktar Dragons. They were once considered to be humanity’s only hope for survival, but that was a long time ago. They vanquished their enemy and have now become the enemy as they have seized control of the galaxy."
