        "text": "About Leaping to the Stars\n\nNo longer able to return to his home on Earth, Charles Dingillian and his two brothers must choose a new planet to call home. But which one?\n\nCharles has come into possession of a prototype HARLIE unit so revolutionary and state-of-the-art that corporations will stop at nothing—including murder—to control it. Earth is in a state of social and economic meltdown. The battle for domination between rival corporations has gone interplanetary.\n\nCharles has been at war before: only, that was a personal civil war waged between him and his parents. In an effort to end the strife once and for all, thirteen-year-old Charles took the drastic step of “divorcing” his parents. He and his brothers are now free to do what they choose.\n\nFreedom for Charles and his brothers means passage on a starship to a colony Outbeyond. There, they will use HARLIE to help build a better world. But freedom also means exile. From his home. From his friends. From everything he has ever known. And even his chance for a new life on a remote planet is put in jeopardy when a critical malfunction with the HARLIE unit seemingly threatens the integrity of the voyage. However, a faction of passengers on board the Brightliner Cascade may pose an even greater risk.\n\nA risk not even an intelligence as powerful as a HARLIE unit can avert."
