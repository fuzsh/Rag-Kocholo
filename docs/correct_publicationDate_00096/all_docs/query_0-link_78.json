        "text": "For over 50 years, David Gerrold has entertained audiences with stories from both this world and others! Beginning with little balls of fur that not only purred, but detected alien spies; to a man that travels through time seeing his life and taking control of it; to a world of man-eating worms where humanity will find its soul; to a little boy looking for a family who thinks he comes from Mars. Throughout 50 years of enjoyment, David Gerrold has been telling tales that could only be explored by him. Now, David has cleaned out the closets and made available copies of some of his greatest literary works. Each copy is personally autographed by David Gerrold himself; new, never read; and in pristine condition. WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!"
