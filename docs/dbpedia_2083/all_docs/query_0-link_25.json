        "text": "7th Infantry Division\n\nThe 7th Infantry Division (7. Infanterie-Division) was a formation of the German Wehrmacht during World War II. It was formed 1 October 1934 in Munich from the Artillerieführer VII staff and renamed 7. Infanterie-Division with the disclosure of German rearmament on 15 October 1935. In preparation of the Invasion of Poland, the division was transferred to Slovak Republik on 1 August 1939. The division surrendered to Soviet forces near Stutthof after the unconditional surrender of 8 May 1945.\n\nOrder of Battle\n\n7th Infantry Division\n\nMobilized on 26 August 1939 with:\n\n1/, 2/, 3/19th Infantry Regiment\n\n1/, 2/5 3/61st Infantry Regiment\n\n1/, 2/5 3/62nd Infantry Regiment\n\n1/, 2/5 3/7th Artillery Regiment\n\n1/43rd Artillery Regiment\n\n7th Divisional Support Units\n\nIn late summer 1939, immediately before the invasion of Poland, the division was organized and equipped as follows:\n\n7th Infantry Division\n\n7th (mot) Mapping Detachment 7th (mot) Motorcycle Messenger Platoon\n\n19th Infantry Regiment\n\n1 Signals Platoon 3 Battalions, each with 3 Rifle Companies (9 LMGs, 2 HMGs and 3 50mm mortars ea)\n\n1 Heavy Company (8 HMGs and 6 80mm mortars)\n\n1 (mot) Panzerabwehr Company (12 37mm PAK 36 and 4 LMGs)\n\n1 Infantry Support Gun Company (2 150mm sIG and 6 75mm leIG)\n\n1 Cavalry Reconnaissance Platoon\n\n1 Light Infantry Supply Column\n\n61st Infantry Regiment\n\nsame as 19th Infantry Regiment\n\n62nd Infantry Regiment\n\nsame as 19th Infantry Regiment\n\n7th (mot) Panzerabwehr Battalion\n\n1 (mot) Signals Platoon\n\n3 (mot) Panzerabwehr Companies (12 37mm PAK 36 and 6 LMGs ea) 4/56th (mot)\n\nHeavy Machine Gun Battalion (12 20mm guns)\n\n7th Reconnaissance Battalion\n\n1 (mot) Signals Platoon\n\n1 Cavalry Squadron (2 HMGs and 9 LMGs)\n\n1 Bicycle Squadron (3 50mm mortars, 2 HMGs and 9 LMGs)\n\n1 (mot) Reconnaissance Squadron\n\n1 Infantry Gun Section (2 75mm leIG)\n\n1 Armored Car Section (2 armored cars)\n\n1 Panzerabwehr Platoon (3 37mm PAK 36 and 1 LMG)\n\n7th Artillery Regiment\n\n1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions, each with\n\n3 Batteries (4 105mm leFH and 2 LMGs ea)\n\n1/43rd Artillery Regiment\n\n3 Batteries (4 150mm sFH and 2 LMGs ea)\n\n7th Artillery Observation Battalion\n\n7th Feldersatz Battalion\n\n3 Companies (9 LMGs, 2 HMGs and 3 50mm mortars ea)\n\n7th Signals Battalion\n\n1 (mot) Radio Company\n\n1 (tmot) Telephone Company\n\n1 (mot) Signals Supply Column\n\n7th Pioneer Battalion\n\n2 Pioneer Companies (9 LMGs ea)\n\n1 (mot) Pioneer Company (9 LMGs)\n\n1 (mot) Bridging Train\n\n1 (mot) Engineer Supply Column\n\n7th Divisional Supply Troops\n\n1-8/7th (mot) Light Supply Columns\n\n9/7th (mot) Light Fuel Column\n\n7th (mot) Maintenance Platoon\n\n7th (mot) Supply Company\n\n7th Divisional Administration\n\n7th (mot) Field Bakery\n\n7th (mot) Butcher Detachment\n\n1/7th Medical Company\n\n2/7th (mot) Medical Company\n\n7th (mot) Field Hospital\n\n1/, 2/7th Ambulance Companies\n\n7th Veterinary Company\n\n7th (mot) Military Police Troop\n\n7th (mot) Field Post Office\n\nIn January 1940 the 7th Feldersatz Battalion became 1 2/339th Infantry Regiment (167th Infantry Division -Wave). In February 1940 the 2/19th was assigned to the 527th Infantry Regiment (298th Infantry Division) of the 8th Wave. It also transferred the 2nd Battery, the 7th Artil­lery Regiment and a few other small detachments.\n\nOn 1 April 1940 some of the supply and support troops of the division had their numbers changed, as follows: the 4/ and 6/7th Light Supply Columns became the II and 2/7th Light Supply Columns; the 6/269th and 1/ and 2/620th Supply Columns became the 4/, 5/ and 6/7th Supply Col­umns; and the 9/7th Fuel Column became the 7/7th Fuel Column.\n\nIn December 1940 a third of the division was detached to the 97th Light Infantry Division (Staff/, 3/19th, 3/61st and 3/62nd Infantry Regiments) and was never replaced.\n\nBy June 1941 the infantry battalions had been reorgan­ized with three rifle companies (twelve LMGs and three 50mm mortars) and a machine gun company (twelve HMGs and six 80mm mortars). The infantry regimental Panzerjager companies had been re-equipped with nine 37mm PAK 36, two 50mm PAK 38 and four LMGs. How­ever, the Panzerjager battalion still had each company with twelve 37mm guns.The 4/56th (mot) Heavy Machine Gun Battalion had been detached. The 7th Reconnaissance Battalion had a (tmot) signals platoon, two bicycle compa­nies (nine LMGs, two HMGs and three 50mm mortars each), a (mot) infantry gun section (two 75mm leIG) and a (mot) Panzerjager platoon (three 37mm PAK 36 and 1 LMG).
