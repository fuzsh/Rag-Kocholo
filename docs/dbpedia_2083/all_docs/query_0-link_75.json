This is very much a 'work in progress' right now and I have included below the first draft of this OOB. I am certain it contains mistakes, and as can been seen I am missing several of the commanding officers of the various sub-units. I am inviting any comments, constructive criticism, and assistance with mistakes, ommissions, names of commanders, etc. Any help is greatly appreciated and I will re-post the product after the incorporation of any edits received here and elsewhere.\n\nThank you in advance for any assistance and/ or comments,\n\nAndrew Godefroy\n\nThe German Army at Vimy Ridge\n\n1st Bavarian Reserve Corps Gruppe Vimy ?
