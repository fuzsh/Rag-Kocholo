        "text": "Hello everybody! I need some help on order to shed light on a recent purchase. Here you find attached pics of a BD blouse badged to a Major J. E. Crowe, 2nd Battalion RF, 56th London Division. The blue flaming grenade is - as long as I know - the emblem of 2nd Battalion RF, the two AoS strips would indicate 168 (London) Infantry Brigade, second Brigade as for seniority in the 56th Division. Now, the 2nd battalion RF was not in the establishment of 56th (London) division during the war, since the two RF battalions serving in the Division were 8th and 9th, both in 167th (London) Infantry Brigade, the Senior brigade of the 56th Division. The BD blouse sport two AoS/seniority strips, therefore Major Crowe was supposedly in 168th (London) Infantry Brigade. 2nd RF as a matter of fact served in 56th Division, but only in 1930-36 AND in 167th (London) Infantry Brigade. During the war 2nd the Royal Fusiliers served rather in 12th Infantry Brigade, 4th Division, and this would be coherent with the two AoS/seniority strips, but the divisional flash is nevertheless that of 56th London Division, and the seller provided evidence that a Captain J. E. Crowe had earned a MC in september 1944 on the Coriano Ridge. He would have been in the 8th RF then, and afterwards transferred to 2nd RF. The question is: what was the establishment of 56th (London) Division just after the war? Was the 2nd RF transferred to 168 (London) Infantry Brigade just after the war? Does anybody knows the composition of 56th (London) Division in, say, 1946 or 1947? When was it disbanded? In 1947 was reformed as the 56th (London) Armoured Division (but with a different divisional flash), does anybody know the composition of 168th Lorried Infantry Brigade? And would the 168th Lorried Infantry Brigade be considered as the 2nd Brigade, since it was the only Infantry Brigade in the Division? Thank you in advance for your knowledge and kind help!\n\nHello\n\nI had a quick look around both my references and the net for this one. I think the confusion here is the blue grenade flash. I don't think it is actually 2nd/R Fus at all, although, for the record, I can't find any reference to confirm which battalion wore this, so I can't be 100% sure.\n\nWhat I can say for sure is that Major John Edmund Crowe was in the 8th Bn, Royal Fusiliers, having transferred from the Royal Artillery to this Bn. 8th and 9th Bn were together in 167th Bde until 23rd September 1944 when 8th was reduced to cadre and it's surplus personnel were absorbed into 9th Bn. This being the case, it is likely he transferred to 9th Bn, so I will have to assume the flash is probably 9/R Fus, pending confirmation.\n\nTo back this theory up, we can look at the AoS strips to see if they make sense. At the end of the War (for example 1 June 1945), 56th (London) Infantry Division was composed of:\n\n24th Infantry Brigade\n\n167th Infantry Brigade\n\n169th Infantry Brigade\n\nwith 9/R Fus being part of 167th Bde. This would make sense, and would tend to confirm both the authenticity of the two strip badging, and the ID of the unit flash being 9th Bn. 56th Div seems to have ceased to exist at the end of August 1945, but i will see if I can confirm that for sure.\n\nThat's all I have so far, but you might want to look at this, as it has a partial history of Mr Crowe's career and a couple of pictures of him. BTW he was made temporary Major in Feb 1945: Officers of the British Army 1939-1945* -- C\n\nIt looks to be a very nice BD, and typical of Italian theatre issue, is an American-made War Aid blouse.\n\nIf I find anything else i will post it for you.\n\nHope this is what you are looking for....\n\nRob"
