        "text": "This unit was formed in October 1934 in Leipzig. It was originally known as Wehrgauleitung Leipzig. Shortly after the unit was established it was given the cover name Kommandant von Leipzig. The organic regimental units of this division were formed by the expansion of the 11.(Sächsisches) Infanterie-Regiment of the 4.Division of the Reichswehr.\n\nWith the formal announcement of the creation of the Wehrmacht (which had covertly been in place for over a year) on October 15th, 1935, the cover name Kommandant von Leipzig was dropped and this unit became offically known as the 14.Infanterie-Division.\n\nOn October 15th, 1940, the 14.Infanterie-Division was reformed as the 14.Infanterie-Division (mot.). The conversion was completed by March 3rd, 1941.\n\nIn 1943 the 14.Infanterie-Division (mot.) was de-motorised after an attempt to reform it into the 14.Panzergrenadier-Divison failed. This process began on May 1st, 1943 and the division was then redesignated the 14.Infanterie-Division on June 30th, 1943\n\nWhen the planned redesignation of the 14.Infanterie-Division (mot.) into the 14.Panzer-Grenadier-Division did not take place, Infanterie-Regiment 101 was reformed. Infanterie-Regiment 101 from the original 14.Infanterie-Division was transfered along with the rest of the division when it became the 14.Infanterie-Division (mot.), but it was soon transfered again to the 18.Panzer-Division. When the 14.Infanterie-Division (mot.) became the 14.Infanterie-Division, Infanterie-Regiment 101 was reformed. The original Infanterie-Regiment 101 became Schutzen-Regiment 101 when it was sent to the 18.Panzer-Division.\n\nOrganization\n\n1940\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 11\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 53\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 101\n\nArtillerie-Regiment 14\n\nI./Artillerie-Regiment 50\n\n14th Divisional Support Units\n\n1943\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 11\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 53\n\nInfanterie-Regiment 101\n\nArtillerie-Regiment 14\n\nFüsilier-Abteilung 14\n\nKradschutzen-Abteilung 54 14th Divisional Support Units\n\nCampaigns\n\n·Poland 1939\n\n· Western Campaign 1940 March trough Holland(Limburg,occupation of Belgium (Duinkerke), occupation of France\n\n· Eastern Front 1943-1945 Barbarossa and retreat from Russia\n\nCommanders:\n\nOberstErich Friderici 4.01.34 - 10.01.35\n\nGen.Lt.
