        "text": "During the period 26th August – 01st September 1939, the 260th Infantry Division was established as a 4th wave unit in Ludwigsburg. The division counted 491 officers, 99 civilians, 2.165 non commissioned officers and 12.264 soldiers. It had a total strength of 15.019 men. Lieutenant General Hans Schmidt, born in Ulm, became the first commander of the division.\n\nHis first formal orders were as follows:\n\nAs of today I will take command of the Division. Our troops and units are re-established. War veterans, that bravely have defended their country with their life stand in line with our youth that will follow this example. We will use our full energy to finish our training and skills so we will be ready to take upon any given task. Following the oath to our colors, we will fulfill our duties to the ultimate end.\n\nSchmidt, Lieutenant General\n\nDuring Germany’s assault on Poland between 1st and 9th of September, the division was deployed to Muensingen training area. On the 8th of September, the commander received the deployment orders for his division at the Army command 7 in Calw.\n\nBetween 9th and 10th September, the 260th Infantry Division was ordered to the western front and deployed there. Until 19th of April, it took positions on the upper Rhine River both sides of the towns Muellheim and Neuenburg am Rhein. The Division Command Post was located in Badenweiler. Throughout the time, the men were busy building combat positions and going on reconnaissance. During one of these venturesome missions, a French flag was captured by men of the Infantry Regiment 470. This was honored with the first Iron Crosses 2nd class.\n\nOn the 8th of January, French troops opened fire on positions of 2nd battalion, Infantry regiment 470. The civilian worker Eberle, member of a construction unit, suffered a head shot and died. He was the division’s first victim.\n\nBeginning April 20th, 1940 the division started to conduct training in the area of operations of the western front near Villingen. Road marches by night to Tuebingen and railroad deployments to Reutlingen, Metzingen and Kirchentellinsfurt were executed. In Reutlingen, part of the Division HQ was posted at Ypernkaserne. On Mai 20th, the structure of the 2nd Army command changed: together with 298th and 162nd Infantry division, the 260th Infantry Division became the XXXXIInd army corps.\n\nAfter railroad transport to the Eifel area (between 21st and 23rd May, near Erdorf and Bitburg) the assault into Luxemburg commenced. The German forces advance throughout the little country via Dasburg, Clerf and Allerborn (23rd – 25th of may). The Division crossed Belgium passing the cities Graide – Our – Louette St.Pierre – Willerzie. The King of Belgium signed the capitulation papers on 28th of May 1940. After the division was brought to halt near the Maas river crossing close to Monthermé, it became the reserve of the XIIIth Army Corps.\n\nOn 30th May 1940, the unit was subordinated under the 12th Army Command. With that change, the direction of assault changed form West to South. The following day, the 31st of may 1940, orders were given to mark of all vehicles in the Division with an own unit symbol. This measure became necessary to divert the different vehicles that used the same assault routes. As unit crest, the “Hoernle” was chosen. It was a modification of the old symbol of the Württemberg kingdom. It showed 4 horns bended to the left. It had a length of 19 cm and was 2,5 cm wide. It had to be put on all vehicles at the front and rear.\n\nOn 01st of June 1940, the deployment north of the Aisne River began. The division crossed the Maas River near Monthermé. Its HQ was located at Arnicourt Castle near the city of Lonny. The crossing of the Aisne River was prepared near the city of Rethel. Artillery regiment 260 (without 2nd detachment) and Engineer Battalion 653 were subordinated to 17th Infantry Division to support the attack and to build the bridgehead near Château-Porcien. The soldiers of 2nd detachment / AR 260 were subordinated under the 21st Infantry division which fought also in the nearby area. The men had to fight not only the French but also the heat. They found little water but lost of vine and Champaign. The battle to break through the French Aisne front took place between the 09th and 13th of June 1940. The division had to mourn about heavy losses when it crossed the Aisne River. The reconnaissance squadron 260 fought near the city of Machault and forced the breakthrough in the Suippe area.\n\nMid-June 1940 the Division took part in chasing French units throughout the Champagne: from Givry to Revigny, over the Rhine-Marne-Canal, on both sides of Côte d’Or over the Langres – Dijon plateau (Nuits St.Georges – Beaune – Chagny). On the 21st of June, a parade was conducted in Dijon with the Division commander. On the 22nd of June, the cease fire was officially announced.\n\nBy the end of June the Division occupied the city of Dijon. Its main task was to secure the line of demarcation from Bourbon-Lancy near the Loire River over Paray-le-Monial at the Canal du Centre – Montchanin – Chalons-sur-Saône – Chaussin. The HQ was at Château de la Verrerie in Le Creusot. On June 30th, the division was subordinated under the XXVth Army Corps.\n\nUntil September 11th 1940, the 260th ID was deployed as occupying force in France. The area of operations was Belfort (HQ at the old fortress) – Montbeliard – Delle (close to the Swiss border) – Morvillars. During this period the soldiers had to keep up their skills by continuous training. On August 24th, the new higher HQ was the XVIIIth Army Corps.\n\nSubordination changed two more times: on 14th September under XXXXVth Army Corps and on 15th October under XXVIIth Army Corps.\n\nBeginning May 4th, a leave ban was ordered, on June 22nd a radio message from 1st Army command arrived: “the 260th Infantry Division will be deployed to the eastern front!” On this fateful day, operation Barbarossa began – the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Between June 30th and 3rd July 1941, the division was removed from the area of Le Creusot. The 215th Infantry Division took over the sector. Via railroad transport, the units were transferred from France throughout Germany to Poland. The unloading happened at Mordy, close to the city of Siedlce. Afterwards a march towards the Russian border north of Brest-Litowsk was carried out.\n\nSubordination under the XXXVth Army Corps followed. The assault towards the Beresina River began. Fast marches of 50 – 70 kilometers daily via Baranowitschi to an area west of Bobruisk were the result. The Division was used south of Bobruisk. The division (IIIrd / Infantry Regiment 470) was partly deployed on trucks to fight guerrillas near Lubany. On July 13th, the Division was subordinated under the XXXIIIrd Army Corps. It was now the connecting unit between the Army Groups South and Center.\n\nThroughout the period July 19th and August 08th 1941 the division was involved in heavy fighting south of Bobruisk. During the tough and bloody battle near the cities of Romanischtsche and Ugly on July 24th 1941, 51 attacking Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Division lost 92 men, 510 were wounded.\n\nBeginning August 9th, 1941 the Division crossed the Beresina River south of Bobruisk on pontoon bridges built by engineers and headed towards Slobin. The left neighbor was the 267th Infantry division; the 134th Infantry division followed the 260th. South of Slobin, a bridgehead over the Dnjepr River was established after fierce fighting. On August 18th 1941, the Division was subordinated under the 13th Army Corps.\n\nUntil the end of August, the 260th followed Soviet Forces passing Gomel. They conducted raids through the cities of Gorodnya – Dubrovnoye – Tschernisch and finally Kisselewka. The city of Gomel – mostly wooden houses – was completely destroyed during the battle. The division entered the town on 22nd of August. On August 28th, the Ukrainian border was passed.\n\nOn 24th August, the attack southwards of the 13th Army Corps with 3 divisions began. Lieutenant General Schmidt ordered on September 01st to cross the Desna River on both sides of Kisselewka (east of Tschernigow). Infantry Regiment 470, later reinforced with units of Infantry Regiment 480 established a bridgehead on both sides of Wibli at 17:00 Hrs. During the intense fighting at this bridgehead, Kiew was encircled. On this day, the battle for Tschernigow began as well. Infantry Regiment 470 formed another first bridgehead over the Desna here.\n\nRegiment 470, later reinforced by Infantry Regiment 480 create a bridgehead on both sides of Wibli around 17:00 hours\n\nThe 5th Company, Infantry Regiment 470 under the leadership of Lieutenant Hans Helmling, was the first unit in the area of thr Army Group that had crossed the Desna River. During the fierce fighting over the bridgehead near Wibli, the encirclement around Kiev was closed. On September 1, 1941 the fight for the city of Chernigov began. On September 2, strongest Russian artillery fire was hitting on Wibli.\n\nThe situation stabilized on 03. September. Soviet troops attacked the bridgehead fifteen times and were thrown back just as often.\n\nOn September 5, the troops of the 5th Soviet Army retreated. On this day the 260th ID was subordinated under the XXXXIII. Army Corps.\n\nOn September 9, 1941, the division reached Janowka, a small village south of Chernigov. This was the southernmost place of the advance. On September 12, the division was again subordinate under the XIII. Army Corps. The battles of the past few days cost the division 515 killed, 600 dead horses and more than 4,000 other casualites.\n\nOn September 14, 1941, the regrouped 260th Infantry Division marched via Chernigov and Starodub (22.09.) to the area southeast of Roslavl. Lieutenant General Schmidt was awarded the Knight’s Cross in Unecha on 23 September.\n\nThe constant fighting ended on 26 September in Kiev with the larges encirclement battle in history. More than 660,000 Soviet soldiers died here or were taken prisoner because Stalin had stubbornly held on to the city and ordered a rigid defense (his adversary was also to commit this mistake 3 years later). On September 26, 1941, the first frost also announced the winter.\n\nBetween September 28, 1941 and October 3, 1941, the division made its breakthrough through the Stalin Line. In the north, the defensive battle took place at Jelnja. The break through the upper Desna position and formation of a bridgehead at Star Chotmirowka followed.\n\nOn October 2, 1941 began the „Operation Typhoon“, the German assault on Moscow. Most German soldiers showed a lack of understanding, the units were awaining the harsh Russian winter.\n\nIn the period from October 03, 1941 to October 11, 1941 they came across Bolwa and Ugra, the airfield Vorotynsk was reached quickly. On October 8, the 260th Infantry Division was subordinated to Army High Command 4 (Generaloberst von Kluge). The division was ordered to storm the Oka Bridges south of Kaluga.\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the city of Kaluga, which has 90,000 inhabitants, was captured. The 17th Infantry Division penetrated after several days of fighting from the west, the infantry regiment 470 entered (after two river crossings within 24 hours) from the south. Soldiers of the 7th Company / Infantry Regiment 21 and men of the 470 Infantry Regiment shook hands at the Oka Bridge on the southern edge of Kaluga.\n\nOn October 13, 1941, then began the assault against Moscow via Anashuja (division command post on 17.10.) – Ssaschkino (nocturnal raid on parts infantry regiment 470) – Petrishcheva. The division had to turn off to the southeast. Russian forces were thrown back across the Oka on either side of the village of Alexin. The division was deployed along the Oka from Alexin to Tarussa. There was a replacement by the 52nd Infantry Division, the 260th ID led a march in the staging area on both sides Gosteschewo (replacement by 17th Infantry Division) to attack on the Protwa through. The right neighbor was the 52nd Infantry Division, left neighbor the 137th Infantry Division. The formation of a bridgehead on both sides of Kremenki was achieved.\n\nOn October 13, „Rasputitsa“ began, the feared mud period that made advancement almost impossible.

There were fierce battles on the Protwa. They started digging trenches in Kremenki bridgehead. The battles for the Browna section were followed by the attack on Browna and his capture on 03.11.1941. A 5-minute fire raid was too short here, so there were own losses in the staging area. Nevertheless, an advance to Pawlowdska succeeded (15 km west of Sserpuchow). The advance ended about 90 kilometers southwest of Moscow. On 06.11.1941 the divisional command post was located in Lgowo, the easternmost point of the advance.\n\nBetween 14 November 1941 and 15 December 1941, the defensive battle took place in front of Moscow, at which the division as part of the XIII.
