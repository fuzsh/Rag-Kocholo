        "text": "In February 1916 a small group of German army pioneers approached the looming bulk of Fort Douaumont near Verdun, at the time considered impregnable. This article describes the remarkable events surrounding its almost single-handed capture by one of these men and the complacency amongst the French army's high command which led to this debacle.\n\nFirst Part of a trilogy about the great battles of 1916 on the western front. This part deals with the Verdun Campaign, parts 2 and 3 deal with the Somme offensive and the aftermath of both battles.\n\nAs the largest battle of the Franco-Prussian War, resulting in over 30,000 casualties between the North German Confederation and Second French Empire, this brief Battle Study addresses the cause of the conflict, a comparison of each army and their tactics, and a succinct recollection of the events of the battle. It concludes with a short question regarding the memory of the conflict and the stereotype of Prussian military dominance.\n\nThe unprecedented scale of trench warfare in the First World War posed a series of challenges to attacking forces. This article tracks the early French steps to develop a coherent doctrine for launching offensives against established trench systems, focusing on a specific battle in May-June 1915: Second Artois. This battle would be the first based on lessons learned and digested by the French army after its initial tentative efforts at trench warfare from December 1914 to March 1915. As such it provides an interesting starting point for an analysis of the French army’s development of trench tactics in the First World War and of the part this played in the general effort made by the two sides to find ways to break the post-1914 stalemate on the Western Front."
