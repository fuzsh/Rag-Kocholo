Some of the men were from Carroll, Chattahoochee, and Dooly counties. The unit served at Cumberland Gap, then moved to Mississippi. Here it was assigned to T.H. Taylor's Brigade, Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, and after fighting at Champion Hill was captured at Vicksburg on July 4, 1863. Exchanged and assigned to General Cummings' Brigade, the 56th was involved in the operations of the Army of Tennessee from Chattanooga to Bentonville. It reported 74 casualties at Chattanooga, totalled 434 men and 277 casualties in December, 1863, and during January, 1865, when it was consolidated with Glenn's 36th Regiment, 232 were present.
