The division served in the trenches of the Western Front during the First World War. Disbanded after the war, the division was reformed in 1920 and saw active service in the Second World War in Tunisia and Italy. The division was again disbanded in 1946 and reformed as an armoured formation before final disbandment in 1961.\n\nThe division's insignia in the First World War was the sword symbolising the martyrdom of Paul the Apostle from the coat of arms of the City of London; in the Second World War the insignia was changed to a black cat.\n\nFormation[]\n\nThe 1st London Division was created upon the formation of the Territorial Force (TF), the part-time reserve force of the British Army, in April 1908. Originally designated as the 1st London Division, the division comprised the 1st, 2nd and 3rd London Brigades, along with supporting units and was one of fourteen divisions which constituted the peacetime TF.[1]\n\nFirst World War[]\n\nOn the outbreak of the conflict the Division's pre-war establishment units were mobilized individually rather than in their divisional formation, and were initially used for garrison duty overseas in Malta, or as reinforcement for regular army divisions on the Western Front.\n\nIn February 1916 the Division was reconstituted as a fighting formation in the Abbeville district in France and numbered the \"56th (1/1st London Division)\".\n\nFor the remainder of the war the Division fought on the Western Front taking part in all of the major campaigns and seeing severe action. It was demobilized in May 1919.[2]\n\nOrder of battle[]\n\nThe 56th Division was constituted as follows during the war:[1]\n\n167th (1st London) Brigade\n\n1/1st Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left May 1915, rejoined February 1916)\n\n1/2nd Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left February 1915)\n\n1/3rd Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left May 1915, rejoined February 1916, left January 1918)\n\n1/4th Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left January 1915)\n\n1/7th Battalion, Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment) (from February 1916)\n\n1/8th Battalion, Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment) (from February 1916)\n\n4th Battalion, Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment) (from October to November 1917)\n\n167th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 22 March 1916, moved to 56th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 March 1918)\n\n167th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 14 June 1916)\n\n168th (2nd London) Brigade\n\n1/5th Battalion, London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade) (left November 1914)\n\n1/6th Battalion, London Regiment (City of London Rifles) (left November 1914)\n\n1/7th Battalion, London Regiment (left November 1914)\n\n1/8th Battalion, London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) (left November 1914)\n\n1/4th Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (previously 1st London Bde;

After the 47th Division, the London Division absorbed many of the units from the former 47th Division.[4]\n\nSecond World War[]\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the division, commanded by Major General Claude Liardet,[5] was mobilised as motorised infantry under the title of the 1st London Division. It was reorganised as an infantry division in June 1940 and renamed the 56th (London) Infantry Division on 18 November 1940. The divisional insignia during the Second World War was changed to an outline of a black cat in a red background. The cat stood for Dick Whittington's cat, a symbol of London.[6]\n\nThe division remained in the United Kingdom during the Battle of France, moving to the Middle East in November 1942, where it served in Iraq and Palestine, until moving to Egypt in March 1943 and thence forward to Libya and the front, in April.[7] This involved the division, commanded by Major General Eric Miles, travelling some 2,300 miles (3,700 km) by road, a notable achievement and testament to the organization of the division and the ability of its mechanics and technicians. The division, minus the 168th Brigade, fought in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign, where it suffered heavy casualties, including its GOC, Major-General Miles, who had been in command since October 1941. He was replaced by Major-General Douglas Graham.[5][6]\n\nThe division sat out the Allied invasion of Sicily and moved to Italy in September 1943, where they fought in the landings at Salerno under the command of the British X Corps.[6] During this time the 201st Guards Brigade joined the division,[5] to replace the 168th Brigade which returned to the division in October, although the 201st remained attached until January 1944. The 56th Division then crossed the Volturno Line in October and took part in the fighting around the Bernhardt Line. In January 1944, the 56th Division, now commanded by Major General Gerald Templer,[5] saw service in the Battle of Monte Cassino, serving there until February 1944 and participated in the Anzio Campaign until relieved in March.[6]\n\nAfter being withdrawn to Egypt at the end of March, the division, under Major-General John Whitfield,[5] returned to Italy in July 1944, where it took part in the Battles along the Gothic Line and remained there until after Victory in Europe Day.[6] During the fighting of 1944 and 1945, some of the infantry battalions that suffered heavy casualties were disbanded, to make up for an acute manpower shortage. The division also took part in Operation Grapeshot, the Allied offensive which ended the war in Italy.[6]\n\nAfter crossing the Volturno in October 1943, the division entered the town of Calvi Vecchia. Their attempts to radio the Fifth Army to cancel a planned bombing on the town failed. As a last resort, the 56th released an American homing pigeon, named G.I. Joe, which carried a message that reached the allies just as the planes were being warmed up. The attack was called off and the town was saved from the planned air assault.[8][9]\n\nOrder of battle[]\n\nThe 56th Infantry Division was constituted as follows during the war:[10]\n\n1st London Infantry Brigade\n\n(became 167th (London) Infantry Brigade 18 November 1940)[11]\n\n8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (disbanded 23 September 1944)\n\n9th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers\n\n1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles (Royal Ulster Rifles) (from 3 September 1939, left 4 November 1940, rejoined from 23 September 1944 onwards)\n\n1st London Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 11 May 1940)\n\n167th (London) Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (disbanded 8 January 1941)\n\n15th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (from 9 November 1940, left 13 February 1941)\n\n7th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (from 14 February 1941, left 23 September 1944)\n\n1st Battalion, London Scottish (Gordon Highlanders) (from 23 September 1944)\n\n2nd London Infantry Brigade\n\n(became 168th (London) Infantry Brigade 18 November 1940, detached from division between 8 April 1943 and 17 October 1943, left 26 September 1944)[12]\n\n1st Battalion, Queen's Westminsters (King's Royal Rifle Corps) (left 4 November 1940)\n\n1st Battalion, London Scottish (Gordon Highlanders) (left 23 September 1944)\n\n1st Battalion, London Rifle Brigade (Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)) (left 30 November 1940)\n\n2nd London Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 7 February 1940)\n\n168th (London) Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (disbanded 7 April 1941)\n\n1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles (Royal Ulster Rifles) (from 4 November 1940, left 23 September 1944)\n\n18th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (from 5 November 1940, left 15 February 1941)\n\n10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment (from 15 February 1941, disbanded 15 May 1944)\n\n1st Battalion, Welch Regiment (from 17 May, left 26 September 1944)\n\n3rd London Infantry Brigade\n\n(left 6 October 1939)\n\n1st Battalion, The Rangers\n\n1st Battalion, Tower Hamlets Rifles\n\n2nd Battalion, The Rangers\n\n2nd Battalion, Tower Hamlets Rifles\n\n35th Infantry Brigade\n\n(from 8 July 1940, became 169th (London) Infantry Brigade 28 November 1940)[13]\n\n2/5th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment\n\n2/6th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment\n\n2/7th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment\n\n35th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Regiment (formed 2 October 1940)\n\n169th (London) Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (disbanded 7 April 1941)\n\n201st Guards Brigade\n\n(from 23 July, left 17 September 1943)[14]\n\n6th Battalion, Grenadier Guards\n\n3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n\n2nd Battalion, Scots Guards\n\n24th Guards Brigade\n\n(from 10 March 1945)[15]\n\n5th Battalion, Grenadier Guards (disbanded 28 March 1945)\n\n2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards\n\n1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n\n1st Battalion, Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)\n\nDivisional Troops\n\n1st Battalion, Queen Victoria's Rifles (Motorcycle Battalion, left 21 May 1940)\n\n1st Battalion, Princess Louise's Kensington Regiment (Machine Gun Battalion, from 11 November 1941, left 20 May 1942)\n\n6th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (Machine Gun Battalion, from 12 January 1943)\n\n56th Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps (formed 1 January 1941, became 56th Regiment 6 June 1942, detached 15 August 1942)\n\n44th Regiment, Reconnaissance Corps (from 8 March 1943, became 44th Reconnaissance Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps 1 January 1944)\n\n64th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery\n\n90th (City of London) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (left 18 March 1943)\n\n113th (Home Counties) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 9 July 1940)\n\n65th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 23 April 1943)\n\n67th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 1 July 1940)\n\n115th Field Regiment (North Midlands), Royal Artillery (from 15/16 July 1940, left 31 December 1940)[16]\n\n100th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (from 3 February 1942, disbanded 9 November 1944)\n\n220th Field Company, Royal Engineers\n\n501st Field Company, Royal Engineers (from 8 September 1939, left 18 March 1943, rejoined 13 October 1943)\n\n221st Field Company, Royal Engineers (from 3 July 1940)\n\n42nd Field Company, Royal Engineers (from 9 July 1943, left 3 January 1944)\n\n223rd Field Park Company, Royal Engineers (left 30 September 1939)\n\n563rd Field Park Company, Royal Engineers (from 15 January 1940)\n\n1st London Divisional Signals Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (56th (London) Division Signals Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals)\n\nPostwar[]\n\nIn 1946, the 56th Division was demobilised then re-constituted as the 56th (London) Armoured Division. The new formation included the 22nd Armoured Brigade and the 168th (Lorried) Infantry Brigade, with the Inns of Court & City Yeomanry acting as the divisional reconnaissance unit. The divisional artillery comprised:[17][18]\n\n1st Regiment, Honourable Artillery Company, Royal Horse Artillery\n\n263rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (6th London)\n\n290th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (City of London)\n\n624th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (Royal Fusiliers)\n\nG Locating Battery, Honourable Artillery Company\n\nOn 20 December 1955, the Secretary of State for War informed the House of Commons that the armoured divisions and the 'mixed' division were to be converted to infantry.[19] The 56th Division was one of the eight divisions placed on a lower establishment for home defence only.[20] The territorial units of the Royal Armoured Corps were reduced to nine armoured regiments and eleven reconnaissance regiments by amalgamating pairs of regiments and the conversion of four RAC units to infantry.\n\nOn 20 July 1960, a further reduction of the T.A. was announced in the House of Commons. The Territorials were to be reduced from 266 fighting units to 195. The reductions were carried out in 1961, mainly by the amalgamation of units. On 1 May 1961, the T.A. divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts and matched with Civil Defence Regions, to aid the mobilisation for war.[21] The division ceased to exist as an independent entity and was linked to London District.\n\nThe 4th Battalion, Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment was formed in 1961, by the amalgamation of the 6th Battalion, East Surrey Regiment and the 23rd London Regiment, with a Battalion HQ and HQ Company at Kingston upon Thames.[22] It formed part of 47th (London) Infantry Brigade (56th London Division/District). An echo of the 56th Division emerged again from 1987–1993, when the public duties battalions in the London District were grouped as the 56th Infantry Brigade.\n\nCommanders[]\n\nMajor-General Alfred E.
