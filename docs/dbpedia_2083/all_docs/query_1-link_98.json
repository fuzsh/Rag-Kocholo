        "text": "Battle of Gettysburg\n\nThe 56th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment was commanded at Gettysburg by Colonel John W. Hoffmann. It was the second regiment in the line of march as the First Corps made its way up the Emmitsburg Road and across the fields to Seminary Ridge. As the battle line formed it was the first to get in position, and immediately opened fire: the first Union infantry to do so in the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nBrigadier General Cutler, who command division, wrote Pennsylvania’s Governor Curtin that November,\n\n“…I am reminded that I have neglected a duty which I owe to one of your regiments, the Fifty-sixth, and its brave commander,Colonel J. William Hofmann. That regiment… was at that time under my command. It was my fortune to be in the advance on the morning of July 1st. When we came upon the ground in front of the enemy, Colonel Hofmann’s regiment (being the second in thecolumn) got into position a moment sooner than the others, the enemy now advancing in line of battle within easy musket range. The atmosphere beinga little thick, I took out my glass to examine the enemy. Being a few paces in the rear of Colonel Hofmann, he turned to me and inquired, ‘Is that the enemy?’ My reply was, ‘Yes.’\n\n“Turning to his men, he commanded, ‘Ready,right oblique, aim, fire!’ and the Battle of Gettysburg was opened. The fire was followed by other regiments instantly; still that battle on the soil of Pennsylvania was opened by her own sons, and it is just that it should become a matter of history. When Colonel Hofmann gave the command’ aim, I doubted whether the enemy was near enough to have the fire effective, and asked him if he was within range; but not hearing my question, he fired, and I receivedmy reply in a, shower of rebel bullets, by which many of the Colonels men were killed and wounded. My own horse, and those of two of my staff, were wounded at the same time… I hope that you will cause proper measures to be taken to give that regiment the credit, which is its due, of having opened that memorable battle.”\n\n-Bates, Samuel P. History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-65, Harrisburg, 1868-1871.\n\nAfter the first exchange of vollies an intense firefight went on for twenty minutes, then the regiment was ordered to withdraw, which it did in good order. After exchanging fire with enemy troops to the north the brigade, out of ammunition, was relieved and moved through the town to the cemetery near Baltimore Pike, where it spent the night. Lieutenant Gordon of Company B and seven enlisted men were killed. Captains Burritt and Flynn, Lieutenant Hubler, and sixty-one enlisted men were wounded, and seventy-eight men were missing.\n\nThe regiment moved into the woods and dug in at the summit of Culp’s Hill on the 2nd. It was soon attacked by Confederates coming up the slope of the hill. Some had approached within twenty yards of the defenses in spite of the regiment’s murderous fire, but they fell back, and continued to fire until late at night from the cover of the trees and rocks. The regiment lost two men killed, and three men wounded on the 2nd.\n\nThe 56th received a respite on the 3rd until early in the evening, when it moved to the cemetery to support batteries on its crest.\n\nFrom the monument to the 56th Pennsylvania at Gettysburg:\n\nThe Regiment here delivered the opening fire of the infantry in the Battle of Gettysburg in the forenoon of July 1st, 1863. July 2nd and 3rd, occupied position on Culp’s Hill as indicated by stone marker.\n\nWent into action with 252 officers and men. Killed and died of wounds 17 Wounded 58 Captured or missing 55 Total 130\n\nThe official casualty figures differ slightly from those on the monument, with 14 killed, 61 wounded, and 55 missing. Second Lieutenant John D. Gordon of Company B and Sergeant Harrison Smith of Company K were killed. Captain Ira N. Burritt of Company K and First Lieutenant John D. Hubler of Company F were wounded. Captain Robert H Day of Company D was captured and would spend the rest of the war in Confederate captivity."
