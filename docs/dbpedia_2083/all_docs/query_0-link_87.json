        "text": "The 21st Infantry Division was a German military unit which fought during World War II.\n\nHistory\n\nThe division was formed in 1934 in Elbing, East Prussia, by expanding the 3rd Prussian Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division of the old Reichswehr. As this was a direct breach of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, its existence was initially concealed; it was formally designated as the 21st Infantry Division in October 1935. Its East Prussian origin informed the adoption of the divisional symbol, a figure holding a shield bearing the black cross of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nMobilised in the 1st wave in 1939, the division took part in the German invasion of Poland and the following year's invasion of France. For the next four years, it fought on the Eastern Front, largely as part of Army Group North, assigned to Eighteenth Army.\n\nAfter being involved in series of defensive battles and retreats to Riga as the Soviet army liberated their territory, late 1944 saw the 21st Infantry Division again in East Prussia, assigned to Third Panzer Army in the area of Tilsit before being reallocated to Fourth Army and deployed in the area of Insterburg, facing the Soviet East Prussian Offensive. Along with the bulk of Fourth Army it was encircled and largely destroyed in the Heiligenbeil pocket in the closing weeks of the war. Remnants of the division's forces were transported over the Frisches Haff to Pillau and Samland, where the unit was eventually dispersed in battle with Soviet troops, while some elements escaped along the Frische Nehrung to Hela and eventually by sea to Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nOrganisation\n\n*Infanterie-Regiment 3\n\n*Infanterie-Regiment 24\n\n*Infanterie-Regiment 45\n\n*Artillerie-Regiment 21\n\n*I./Artillerie-Regiment 57\n\n*Aufklärungs-Abteilung 21\n\n*Panzerjäger-Abteilung 21\n\n*Pionier-Bataillon 21\n\n*Nachrichten-Abteilung 21\n\n*Inf.Div.Nachschubführer 1\n\nSee also\n\n* Division (military), Military unit, List of German divisions in WWII\n\n* Heer, Wehrmacht\n\nReferences"
