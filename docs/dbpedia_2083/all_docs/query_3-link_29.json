Mike Wallace, spoke to more than 250 Texas Army National Guard Soldiers of the 56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and the 1st Battalion of the 143rd Airborne Infantry Regiment, and their families as the mobilizing Guardsmen case their colors in a ceremony in prepare of mobilizing April 27, 2023, in Fort Worth, Texas. “To the families, friends and supportive community members here today -what you see now is an awakening within these men and women out here today. [It’s] the empowerment of belonging to something greater that one’s self and the pride of knowing it’s an organization dedicated to making this great state, this great nation and even the world a better place. To the Soldiers - You are headed overseas to a faraway land. Know that you carry with you… the reputations of all of us and the history of those wearing the T-Patch who have served all over the world.” As part of U.S. military tradition based in history, units mobilizing and deploying in support and defense of the nation hold a colors casing ceremony where the unit’s flags are wrapped in preparation to travel with the unit as they head overseas.
