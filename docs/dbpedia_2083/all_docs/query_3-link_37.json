        "text": "While Tim Walz established himself as a national political figure in Minnesota, the Democratic vice presidential candidate’s life story is deeply rooted in Nebraska.\n\nThe 60-year-old Walz was born in West Point and spent his life through adulthood in Nebraska.\n\nHe graduated from tiny Butte High School.\n\nHe served in the Nebraska Army National Guard for over a decade.\n\nHe earned a degree from Chadron State College.\n\nHe and his wife also taught school in Alliance before they moved to her native state of Minnesota in 1996.\n\n“We got a great base for future success,” Walz once said of his days at Chadron State. “I believe the record shows that we have been able to go on and compete very well.”\n\nNow after Tuesday’s announcement that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had chosen him as her running mate, Walz will compete this fall for a chance to join her in the White House.\n\nWalz, a former U.S. House member and now Minnesota’s governor, touted his small-town roots and the values he said he learned in Nebraska during an introductory video released by the newly minted Harris-Walz campaign Tuesday.\n\n“I learned to be generous toward my neighbors, compromise without compromising my values, and to work for the common good,” he said. “And I tried to teach my students what small town Nebraska taught me: respect, compromise, and service to country.”\n\nNebraskans who knew Walz were abuzz with Harris’ pick after the news broke Tuesday morning.\n\nAubrianna Faustman of Lincoln said she could not be more excited to learn that her high school geography teacher that she twice traveled to China with on school trips was joining the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“He’s just a down-to-earth good guy,” she said. “He was a great teacher who knows how to making learning exciting. I feel like he is really someone who can bring people together.”\n\nAllen Shepherd, a longtime Chadron State professor who taught Walz history, remembered Walz as a talented and curious student with a lot of interests beyond the classroom.\n\n“I suppose if I could use four adjectives to describe him, it would be honest, fair, talented and moderate in politics,” he said.\n\nCon Marshall, the longtime spokesman for Chadron State, recalled that Walz was personable and engaging when he spoke at the school’s commencement a decade ago.\n\n“He didn’t use a single note and walked around the stage talking with a microphone on,” he said. “He is very fluent and very sharp.”\n\nBorn in 1964 in West Point, Nebraska\n\nWalz actually has spent more of his 60 years in Nebraska than he has in Minnesota.\n\nWalz was born on April 6, 1964 in West Point, the son of Jim and Darlene Walz. He spent most of his childhood in Valentine before his family moved to Butte for his sophomore year of high school.\n\nHe graduated from Butte High School in 1982. He likes to say there were 24 people in his graduating class, and he was related to half of them.\n\nWalz’s mother still lives in Butte, a village near the South Dakota border in northeast Nebraska, and he has a sister living in the Panhandle.\n\nEven before completing high school, just two days after turning 17, he got his family’s permission to enlist in the Nebraska Army National Guard. He has said he was encouraged to serve by his father, a Korean War-era veteran.\n\nHe once recalled to Minnesota Public Radio that he and a military recruiter drove 30 miles to a field where a farmer was out tilling. The farmer, a lieutenant in the guard, hopped down from a tractor.\n\n“And we did the oath of enlistment right there on the edge of a field with the recruiter, and that led me on a 24-year journey,” Walz recounted.\n\nHe said he relished being a “citizen soldier, doing it and being part of the people that you defend.”\n\nHe completed his basic training at Georgia’s Fort Benning in the summer before his senior year at Butte. Guard records show he served in the infantry and was promoted to sergeant in 1987.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn 1989, he was honored by the Nebraska Guard as its Citizen-Soldier of the Year, according to his gubernatorial biography.\n\nWalz enrolled at Chadron State in 1982 and used the GI bill to complete his degree in 1989. For a time in 1985, he also took classes in East Asia Studies at the University of Houston.\n\nAfter graduating from Chadron, the sergeant briefly served full time in the guard at the armory in Alliance.\n\nShepherd, the Chadron State professor, recalled a conversation around the time Walz graduated when the young man was pondering what to do with his life. Shepherd said he suggested he “do something that will really shape your life.”\n\nIn 1990, Walz flew off to China to spend a year teaching as part of Harvard University’s WorldTeach program. He taught American history, culture and English to Chinese high school students.\n\nWalz called it a once in a lifetime experience, finding the people in the Communist country kind and generous. Though his students did not celebrate Christmas, they cut down a pine tree, decorated it and brought it to his room on Christmas Eve.\n\n“Going there was one of the best things I’ve ever done,” he later told the Nebraska guard’s newspaper after he returned to his home state and resumed his guard service.\n\nA teacher and coach\n\nFollowing the year teaching in China, Walz became a teacher in Alliance, teaching social studies and geography to middle school and high school students. He also coached football, basketball and track at the middle school.\n\nRoxie Smith, a 32-year veteran teacher in Alliance, recalled that Walz had a passion for teaching and connected with his pupils.\n\n“Tim was just engaging for the students, and I think it was that trip to China,” Smith said. “He was always very kind, especially to the students. You could just tell he loved teaching.”\n\nWalz became known for leading groups of students on summer trips abroad to China. His office walls were covered with news clippings from the trips and a Chinese banner.\n\nDuring his years in Alliance, he also met his wife, Gwen Whipple, a native of Minnesota. She once recalled they were teaching in adjoining portable classrooms, and she became irked by how his loud voice disrupted her classes.\n\n“Oh, the kids, they couldn’t believe the two of them were dating,” Smith recalled. “Miss Whipple and Mr. Walz, that was a big deal. . . . The typical high school drama of a small town.”\n\nThe two married in 1994 and spent their honeymoon leading two high school tour groups to China.\n\nThen in 1996, the couple moved to Mankato, Minnesota, Gwen’s hometown. There, he continued to teach, coach and serve in the guard, ultimately retiring after 24 years of total guard service.\n\nMinnesota was also where Walz launched his political career. In 2006, the Democrat ran for and won a seat in Congress, upsetting a six-term incumbent Republican. After six terms in Washington, he was elected Minnesota governor in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.\n\nAnn Ashford, the wife former Nebraska congressman Brad Ashford, recalled Walz and her late husband became good friends during the Ashford’s lone term in the House from 2015 to 2017, bonding over their shared Nebraska roots.\n\nWith Walz’s military background and connections, he also helped Ashford guide to passage the bill that authorized a new VA medical facility in Omaha.\n\n“(Brad) would be over the moon right now,” Ann Ashford said.\n\nWith Walz’s background as a teacher, coach, guardsman, congressman and governor, she called Walz an outstanding choice for Harris.\n\n“I don’t know how you come up with someone more qualified,” she said. “He understands how to work with labor and everyone from conservative Republicans to the most liberal of Democrats.”\n\nWalz has come to Nebraska at least twice to speak at Democratic Party dinners, once as a congressman in 2010 and last year as Minnesota’s governor.\n\nIn 2014, the then-congressman returned to Chadron State to give the commencement address and to receive a distinguished alumni award.\n\nWalz said he appreciated that his alma mater provided middle class families like his the opportunity to earn a college education.\n\n“The professors at this college wanted us to succeed,” Walz said during his visit. “The door was always open for us to learn and to grow.”\n\nWalz’s former Alliance students were abuzz on Facebook Tuesday over the big news. All partisanship aside, some said, it was a neat thing. One posted a picture of Walz from one of the school trips to China.\n\n“It’s really neat,” said Smith, the former Alliance teacher. “Usually in (elected) office like that, you have no clue where they came from. But it’s just cool to know they were good to kids and they were in the trenches doing the work of an everyday-type citizen. That just kind of kicks all politics aside a little bit.”\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
