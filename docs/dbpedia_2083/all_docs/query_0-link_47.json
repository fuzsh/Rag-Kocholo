        "text": "Hello, hello!\n\nExcited for the final Nemesis #2 option? We sure are! Let’s jump straight into action with today’s Nemesis #2.3 - Second Wave.\n\nWe welcome to the stage the NATO’s British Support Command reinforcing the lines much like the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet 34-ya Tankovaya Diviziya or 34th Tank Division.\n\nGo, go, go!\n\nNemesis #2.3 - Second Wave\n\nIn this offering, we focus on two divisions that - unlike the preceding options - weren’t meant to face each other directly but did fulfill a similar function as rear-area battlefield reinforcements. Hence, the name Second Wave.\n\nNATO’s British Support Command and the Soviet 34-ya Tankovaya Diviziya were both reserve divisions designed to be worked up and mobilized in the lead-up to war. In the British case, it is a battlegroup amalgamating a host of rear-area and second-line forces in the British Army of the Rhine’s area of command; for the Soviets, the division is a typical lower readiness formation set to be trained and equipped deep in the USSR’s hinterland before deploying to the front.\n\nWe saw it fit to add some very interesting and unique units to both these divisions. Keep reading to find out more!\n\nThe British Support Command\n\nThe British Support Command encompassed all British units not under the I (BR) Corps in NORTHAG (so not the main combat formations). HQ British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was situated in Rheindahlen, West Germany. In case of war, the BAOR would come under direct NATO command and turn into NORTHAG. The remaining elements of the HQ BAOR would form the British Support Command.\n\nThe formation’s mission was to secure the Corps’ rear area against communist infiltrators, saboteurs, special forces, or airborne drops. It was also to take command of any reinforcement from the United Kingdom, which didn’t have any direct combat assignment.\n\nAs such, the BRSC could count on seven infantry battalions, one regular and the rest being Territorial Army (TA), as well as many independent AA, artillery, and security units, all the way down to lone companies. While the TA troops were very lightly armed, the British Army stored lots of older equipment on the continent. This materiel, despite being obsolete, would have been a great help to bolster the forces’ firepower.\n\nThe British Support Command in WARNO\n\nHow will the British Support Command look like in-game?\n\nLOG\n\nA very good category for the BRSC. The formation was in charge of keeping the supply flowing to I (BR) Corps, meaning a well-stocked and capable logistical train.\n\nYou’ll deploy the light ROVER 101FC SUPPLY, medium (new) AEC MILITANT Mk.3 and the massive FODEN 16t truck (with 3000 Supply). The latter will be bound to the road, hardly able to move off-road. And, of course, a FOB.\n\nCHINOOK supply helicopter.\n\nCommand vehicles will be ROVER CP, FV510 SARACEN CP and the FV105 SULTAN.\n\nINF\n\nA good combination of slots, costs, plus some interesting units.\n\nOf course, all existing TERRIERS squads deployable in jeeps, trucks or SARACEN.\n\nRIFLES LDR. and MOT. RIFLES in trucks and SAXON, but with a handful of cards only.\n\nNumerous squads with the Security trait. Much like its strong logistical category, the battlegroup’s primary mission was rear area security against enemy threats (and maintaining order and discipline). This means HSF squads, a new RAF RIFLES (the real one, not the existing reservist Berlin-based ones, which we will rename), plus PIONEERS. The latter squad was specifically in charge of HQ’s security.\n\nTwo companies of the famous and dreaded GURKHAS were kept in reserve as demolition groups. These were to blow up bridges or other infrastructure if things should go haywire, and a Soviet breakthrough was all but assured. Teased in WARNO’s Army General Campaign, the “Left Hook”, these special soldiers are featured as a half-platoon of airmobile troops. They feature 12 men (so super-sized squad) with L85A1, 3x L86A1 LSW, and LAW-80. The Gurkhas having extra LAW-80, we also created a 6-man GURKHAS AT GROUP featuring two of these anti-tank weapons, plus GURKHAS RIFLES LDR.. All Gurkhas will come with the Shock and Resolute traits, plus veterancy, but only with a few cards.\n\nART\n\nA rather average category as the BRSC didn’t have artillery of its own. It did command over several training units and field depots filled with stored weapons. As you can imagine, the artillery forces available will be a hodgepodge of many guns.\n\nThese include the standard L16 81mm mortar and L118 105mm howitzer.\n\nIn light of us introducing the British MLRS to the other divisions (seeing service only a few months before our World War III kicked off), the M110A2 it replaced wouldn’t be far removed from the action, operated by unvetted crews.\n\nThere were also plenty of old World War 2-era BL 5,5-INCH (140mm) in storage.\n\nFinally, the three TA Observation Post Batteries assigned to the BAOR reportedly retained their World War 2 QF 25-POUNDER (87mm) field guns in perfect order until 1990.\n\nTANK\n\nAlso pretty average in terms of options, costs, and slot availability.\n\nGathering all serviceable CHIEFTAIN tanks in the area of command, including those in training units and under repair in workshops, warrants a card of older Mk.6/2 or even older variants (to be determined).\n\nThe British Army had hundreds of even older CENTURION tanks in storage, some of them pre-positioned in West Germany. As is common practice in war, obsolete tanks still make perfect mobile pillboxes to protect airfields or other key infrastructure. This warrants the inclusion of a single card of CENTURION Mk.13.\n\nAirfield security was the domain of the RAF Regiment. As we already feature RAF RIFLES (the current variant to be renamed as mentioned previously), we will continue with this practice and add some armor elements: one card each of RAF SCORPION and RAF SCIMITAR, both in a tank role and with the Security trait.\n\nAnd to round it off: lots of ROVER MILAN.\n\nRECO\n\nRather abysmal, with the battlegroup unable to count on any dedicated recon battalion.\n\nThis means a classic selection of SCOUTS, TERRIERS SCOUTS, FERRET, and FOX.\n\nSome helicopter recon will appear in the form of the unarmed (and new) WESTLAND SCOUT.\n\nAA\n\nA pretty good category as the division would take over all AA assets not assigned to the I (BR) Corps, including various flavors of the king of all non-self-propelled SAM and MANPADs: you’ll get to play with the RAPIER FSA, RAPIER FSB1, and the new RAPIER FSB2 DARFIRE (with +2 missiles per launcher). Plus the standard BLOWPIPE, JAVELIN and JAVELIN LML.\n\nWe are also throwing in some RAF storage TIGERCAT SAMs.\n\nHELO\n\nNow we are at another extreme with an almost non-existent HELO category.\n\nThere wasn't any combat helicopter detachment in the area to provide support to the BRSC. If this Nemesis option is picked, we will see if the division needs some foreign rotorcraft or can do without it.\n\nAIR\n\nThe BRSC’s air support will be plentiful. The exact composition of this category has not been determined yet, but unlike the helicopters, the battlegroup’s mission was airfield defense. This means quite a few options will be available in both air superiority and CAS sorties.\n\nAs with other rear-area divisions, it will include trainers-turned-light attack aircraft. One of the examples is the British (new) HAWK T.1A.\n\nSome older F.6 LIGHTNING fighters will also be added. These were kept in storage in the United Kingdom, almost two squadrons worth.\n\nThe BRSC would play not too dissimilar to the West German TerrKdo Süd or the East German K.d.A. The British division will be a reserve battlegroup relying on quantity and cheap units over high-quality equipment, with plenty of infantry, artillery, and strong AA and air forces.\n\nThe Soviet 34th Tank Division\n\nThe 34th Tank Division was a Category C type, meaning the lowest level of combat readiness within the Soviet army. Originally formed under this name at the start of World War II, the division, as it was during the Cold War, began its second life in 1957. The armored formation was based in the Byelorussian Military District, where a skeleton crew kept it dusted-off and functional during peacetime. As far as we can tell, the 34th Tank Division was the last remaining Soviet armored divisions to be equipped fully with T-62 tanks.\n\nThe division was not maintained at full strength and would incorporate a large number of reservists to get up to war footing. Being the lowest tier of combat readiness, the formation was also very low on the priority list for new or updated equipment or even having its aging ones replaced!\n\nThe 34th Tank Division never transitioned to the T-64 or T-80; it was even short of the venerable BMP-1. Other forces were also lacking, such as not being able to count on any organic artillery at all, save for a few BM-21 Grad. Garrisoned near an artillery training division and artillery schools, the industrious 34th Tank Division’s command staff would likely have “dragooned” some long-range indirect fire pieces to bolster the division’s artillery arm.\n\nThe Soviet 34th Tank Division in WARNO\n\nHow will the Soviet 34th Tank Division look like in-game?\n\nLOG\n\nA good amount of slots and ditto costs, but no helicopter units.\n\nMedium URAL-4320 SNAB, heavy KRAZ-225B SNAB and armored MT-LB SNAB. supply vehicles.\n\nCommand vehicles are the BELOZOR jeep, CHAIKA and BMP-1K3 units.\n\nA new unit is the MV-650 KOMENDATURA - a command motorcycle with a side-car - which we hope will bring our Steel Division 2 fans some happy, carefree memories.\n\nINF\n\nA pretty strong category for a tank division.\n\nOne single card of a MOTOSTRELKI (BMP) squad with the (new) BMP-1 SP-2 as a transport option. This latter unit is armed with the older-generation Malyutka ATGM, the same as the DDR version.\n\nThe rest of the MOTOSTRELKI squads are all centered around BTR transports. This includes the new REZERVISTI unit, which is a 10-man squad fielding AKM, RPK and RPG-7VM (14 AP). Finally a Soviet unit with the Reservist trait! The ratio between regular soldiers and reservists in these divisions should be one to two.\n\nThe SAPERI KOM. and SAPERI squads will be the same as other Soviet divisions. The new REZ. SAPERI is armed with older AKMS and LPO flamethrowers and also carries the Reservist trait into battle.\n\nAs mentioned, transport options will be between jeeps, trucks, BTR-60PB, and the older, turretless (new) BTR-60PA.\n\nKOMENDATURA and ZAGRADOTRYAD military police units will help keep the weary green recruits and reservists in line.\n\nInfantry support weapons include the usual array of SPG-9, FAGOT, KONKURS, PKM/, PLAMYA and the new REZ. NSV.\n\nART\n\nAverage but with some new, interesting units.\n\nThese include regimental artillery pieces such as the old (but new for the Soviets) M-43 82mm and PM-43 120mm mortars (only seen with our East German forces so far), and the ubiquitous D-30 122mm howitzers.\n\nAs mentioned, the 34th Tank Division could only count on BM-21, but no organic “tube” artillery battalions. As the Grad turns out to be the main indirect artillery system for this battlegroup, it will come both in BM-21 [HE] and the new BM-21 [NPLM] variants.\n\nTo beef up its artillery forces, the battlegroup will receive a smattering of other weapons, likely occurring in transit from the rear to the front. These units include 2S3 AKATSIYA, old WW2-era (but new) ML-20 152mm howitzers and even the sole Soviet-fielding DANA wheeled self-propelled artillery gun. These were Czech-made units available to the Central Group of Forces (Soviet Army stationed in Czechoslovakia), with the school located near the division.\n\nTANK\n\nAs can be expected, a pretty strong category with lots of cheap slots.\n\nThe 34th Tank Division has access to numerous T-62MK, T-62M1, T-62M and T-62MV.\n\nAdditionally, older (and new) REZ. T-62 Obr. 72 and REZ. T-62 Obr. 74 with the Reservist trait will also be made available.\n\nAnd dedicated tank destroying units will be restricted to a few older (and new) BRDM-2 MALYUTKA-P and BRDM-2 FALANGA-P.\n\nRECO\n\nRecon forces in this battlegroup are pretty decent. They include classic RAZVEKDA SAPERI and MOT. RAZVEDKA., the latter squad deployable with RAZV. BTR-60PB transport.\n\nNew REZ. RAZVEDKA with 4xAKM and RPG-18, sporting the Reservist trait.\n\nOne card each of the BRDM-2 and BRM-1.\n\nA new unit will be the REZ. MV-650 DNJEPR motorcycle with sidecar, armed with an AGS-17. Think of it as a faster but more fragile UAZ with an automatic grenade launcher.\n\nAA\n\nAnti-air category is average, with the division’s regimental AA weapons limited to a few BRDM-2 STRELA-1 and (older, as fielded by the East Germans) ZSU-23-4 SHILKA.\n\nMANPAD teams will vary between the usual IGLA and REZ. STRELA-2.\n\nHeavier AA systems amounted to older OSA with only 4 unboxed missiles and less range.\n\nIn the march to the front, and to make up for the lack of AA systems, the division would commandeer REZ. AZP S-60 towed 57mm guns.\n\nHELO\n\nIt's not very promising, with the sole helicopter regiment located nearby to the 34th Tank Division having gained some notoriety (even in WARNO’s timeline). These were the pilots that flew the dangerous rescue and water-dosing missions about Chernobyl’s exposed reactor at dramatic personal risk. As a result, one of the regiment’s four squadrons was disbanded.\n\nThis means that (no—they won’t be radioactive) helicopter support will come in the form of a handful of older Mi-24D (currently only featured as East German) in the anti-tank role and Mi-8 in a fire support one.\n\nAIR\n\nAir forces assigned to the division are very good, however. While moving west to join the fight against NATO, the 34th Tank Division relied on the powerful Byelorussian Military District’s air force with several Su-25 regiments deployable. These will form a sizable core of the divisional air support.\n\nOther aircraft to be added will be picked from other Belarusian air regiments: MiG-29, Su-24 or MiG-25, as well as the older Yak-28PP in the EW role.\n\nThe second-echelon 34th Tank Division’s strength would be its large number of cheap tanks—chiefly the T-62—further backed by reservist infantry and a strong air force.\n\nNemesis #2 So Far\n\nNemesis #2 is in full swing. Each paid Nemesis mini-expansion contains two themed divisions featuring new units, vehicles, and weapons. And you get to vote on which of three Nemesis options should be developed.\n\nThe Nemesis pairings are all “what if” battles, operations, or decisive campaigns in WARNO’s alternative World War III. The Nemesis chosen by you through a majority vote will “write” WARNO’s lore. Note that the Nemesis options coming in second and third go back on the Eugen’s workshop shelves for potential later use.\n\nAnd so it came to pass:\n\nThe Nemesis #2.1 - Hof Corridor centers on a key valley in southern East Germany turning into the counter-attack vector for the Bundeswehr’s 12 Panzerdivision, with plentiful American support, going up against the ad-hoc defensive-minded Soviet battlegroup Protivotankovyy Rezerv with East German reservists.\n\nNemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion features a war scenario straight out of a 1980s technothriller with a life-or-death struggle to take control of the French silo-based nuclear weapons on Plateau d'Albion. The Soviet 76th Guards Airborne Division air assault deep behind enemy lines and face off against the local French defenders of the 152e Division d’Infanterie.\n\nNemesis: Air Assault\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2978640/WARNO__Nemesis_1__Air_Assault/\n\nNemesis: Air Assault, featuring the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet 56-ya O.G. DShB or the 56th Separate Guards Air Assault and NATO’s US U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) is WARNO’s very first Nemesis DLC. The choice for this particular offering was already made ahead of time to speed up development.\n\nUntil Next Time\n\nThat’s all. Start your propaganda engines and get ready to make a choice. We’ll be back next week with the kick-off of the Nemesis #2 vote!\n\nJoin the WARNO community. Check the latest news on the Steam News page or visit the Steam Forums. Get together with other players on either the excellent Discord server[discord.gg], Reddit page, YouTube or our Instagram[www.instagram.com].\n\nSee you on the battlefield, commander.\n\nHello commanders,\n\nWe return with another WARNO Nemesis offering! In today’s DevBlog, we’ll continue our Nemesis #2 series with option deux.\n\nNemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion is a very “what if” scenario within WARNO’s fictional World War III: a Soviet airborne strike deep, deep inside French territory to neutralize the nation’s nuclear capacity and missile silos before they could be used.\n\nIn today’s preview, we look at NATO’s French 152e Division d’Infanterie versus the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet 76-ya Gvardiyska Vozdushno-Desantnaya Diviziya or the 76th Guards Airborne Division.\n\nThe Nemesis Concept\n\nBefore continuing, here's a short disclaimer about WARNO’s Nemesis concept. Each paid Nemesis mini-expansion contains two themed divisions featuring new units, vehicles, and weapons. The cool part is that you can vote on which of three Nemesis options gets developed.\n\nThe Nemesis pairings are all “what if” battles, operations, or decisive campaigns in WARNO’s alternative World War III. The Nemesis chosen to be developed will “write” WARNO’s lore. Note that the Nemesis options coming in second and third go back on the Eugen’s workshop shelves. They might be used in a run-off, or perhaps we’ll see fit to reuse these battlegroups in one form or another.\n\nWith Nemesis #2, get ready for some rather persuasive and imaginative propaganda battles. However, we kindly ask you to keep the ballot clean, with no cheating, flame wars, or other unwanted or toxic behavior. Be respectful to the vote, the fellow players, the devs, and the WARNO community.\n\nNemesis #2 So Far\n\nNemesis #2 is in full swing. This is what came to pass:\n\nThe Nemesis #2.1 - Hof Corridor centers on a key valley in southern East Germany the counter-attack vector for the Bundeswehr’s 12 Panzerdivision, with plentiful American support, going up against the ad-hoc defensive-minded Soviet battlegroup Protivotankovyy Rezerv with East German reservists.\n\nNemesis: Air Assault\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2978640/WARNO__Nemesis_1__Air_Assault/\n\nNemesis: Air Assault, featuring the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet 56-ya O.G. DShB or the 56th Separate Guards Air Assault and NATO’s US U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) is WARNO’s very first Nemesis DLC. The choice for this particular offering was already made ahead of time to speed up development.\n\nNemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion\n\nNow to the meat and potatoes of Nemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion. This option will be, so far, one of the more outlandish war scenarios we propose within WARNO’s lore. What are we talking about? A Soviet airborne strike deep inside French territory to neutralize the country’s nuclear missile silos.\n\nFrance left NATO’s integrated military command structure in 1966 (but not NATO itself). This meant that the French retained the possibility of using their nuclear arsenal of their own accord—without NATO’s approval. The West Germans would have very likely opposed the use of nuclear weapons on their soil, though France was a wild card.\n\nNow, we already established that in WARNO’s conventional World War III, nuclear weapons are not used. However, nuclear warfare was a real possibility, and though no tactical or strategic exchange occurred within our timeline, the threat was considered very acute.\n\nA Spectacular Strike\n\nIn real life, the most likely war scenarios by both sides were the sumptuous use of nuclear weapons, either as an opening shot, decapitating strikes, to annihilate a Soviet armored breakthrough, or to obliterate NATO’s political will to continue the fight. Indeed, it was generally considered the French’s last resort to turn the eastern bank of the Rhine (meaning allied West Germany) into a radioactive wasteland to prevent Soviet tanks from breaking through the French border. How delightful.\n\nIn the 1980s, France had three different means of delivering its strategic nuclear weapons: submarine (SNLE), aircraft (Mirage IV), and land-based silos (S2). The former two could be countered by Warsaw Pact navies, air forces, and air defenses, but the latter strike option remained well-protected on French soil. Specifically, these missiles were housed in the Base Aérienne 200 (BA 200) on the Plateau d’Albion in southeastern France.\n\nNemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion highlights a spectacular airborne coup de main conducted by the Warsaw Pact to neutralize the missile silos fielded far behind enemy lines. It would be one of the first - perhaps initial strike in the war, together with the covert Kassel-Calden airport takeover in West Germany. The Soviet airborne forces would likely be routed over neutral Austria and Switzerland in the chaotic first minutes and hours of the conflict before entering French airspace and dropping in hot.\n\nIn any case, the battle would be short and extremely violent; no quarter given nor asked. Massive armored doors protected BA 200’s silos, designed to resist a nuclear blast, but so heavy it took 20 minutes to close (or open). This means the operation would be decided in the first 20 minutes, with Warsaw Pact airborne troops landing right on top of the defenders. Both Soviet and French troops would have to accomplish their tasks within this time frame.\n\nThe hypothetical scenario sketched is more in line with James Bond's movies or the techno-thrillers of the 1980s and 90s, but is still faintly plausible.\n\nThe French 152e Division d’Infanterie\n\nUnlike so many other French divisions, the 152e Division d’Infanterie doesn’t trace its origins to the Napoleonic wars, but “just” World War I. It was raised in 1915 and, though missing the first year, took part in the conflict’s most grueling battles: Artois, Verdun, Somme, Chemin des Dames, all the way up to the final Hundred Days Offensive. Disbanded afterward, the division was reconstituted for World War II, being listed in official records but apparently never forming or taking part in any action.\n\nFast-forward to 1979. The 152e Division d’Infanterie saw the light again as a training formation in the later stages of the Cold War. During peacetime, its units were reduced to a cadre of professional troops operating out of various military schools in the administrative 5e Division Militaire (in the southeast of France).\n\nIn WARNO, as mounting tensions lead up to a World War III in the summer of 1989, the formation hurriedly formed the 4e and 24e Régiment d’Infanterie de Marine (naval infantry regiments), the 86e Régiment d’Infanterie (regular infantry) and 19e Régiment de Chasseurs à Cheval (armored cavalry). A further HQ staff and two independent engineer companies resulted in the 152e Division d’Infanterie, mimicking real-life plans.\n\nWhile the two naval infantry regiments were regular, though under-strength, the infantry and armored cavalry regiments were created out of the school’s cadre and filled with reservists. With the featured forces, the 152e Division d’Infanterie was just shy of being a full-fledged infantry division, lacking one engineer company - and, more importantly - one artillery regiment.\n\nThe 152e Division d’Infanterie’s wartime mission was simple: protect the Base Aérienne 200 on the Plateau d’Albion. As such, when under attack, it would receive some additional detachments. These include the Base Aérienne 200’s own defenses, with lots of AA, a helicopter squadron, the Commandos de l’Air (security commandos), plus reserve artillery units.\n\nThe French 152e Division d’Infanterie in WARNO\n\nAs always, units that are both bolded and italic are new! Note that we have not listed “reserve” variants of existing units as new.\n\nLOG\n\nA good category. Though the 152e Division d’Infanterie had a limited logistical train, it would be operating from a well-established and supplied military base.\n\nSupply units include the TRM-2000 LOG and its bigger brother, the much heavier (and new) TRM-10000 LOG. During the deployment phase, a FOB can also be used.\n\nCommand units featured are the new M201 PC (which is the P4‘s ancestor, basically a locally produced World War II Willy’s jeep), VAB PC, and the new ALOUETTE II PC.\n\nINF\n\nThis will clearly be the division’s strongest category.\n\nThe most numerous infantry unit on the table will be (reworked) RESERVISTES featuring the old LRAC 73 as a 4th Weapon, led by the new CMDT RESERVISTES squad. Both units feature the Reservist trait and will ride to battle in either a (new) M201 jeep, truck, or VAB APC.\n\nNaval infantry will be present with a few cards of regular and new CMDT MARSOUINS, MARSOUINS and MARSOUINS (APILAS). These are organized and equipped exactly like their GRENADIER-VOLTIGEURS counterparts, with the only notable difference being the specific headgear the soldiers wore (the French Army being rather fashionista). To follow our approach of granting the Shock trait to airborne troops as a whole (to emphasize their close-quarter combat training), we intend for naval infantry of all nations to come featured with the Resolute trait, emphasizing their usually stronger esprit de corps. Therefore, these new squads will be organized along the lines of the already existing GRENADIER-VOLTIGEURS but with the Resolute trait. They will also deploy in either a M201 jeep, truck, or VAB.\n\nEngineers deploy from regular companies and are identical to existing SAPEURS (in all variants), although less numerous than in a regular division.\n\nPREVOTE military police will be complemented by some heavy-duty airfield security GENDARMES DE L’AIR combat squads.\n\nThe French Air Force, the Armée de l’Air, could count on its own COMMANDOS DE L’AIR, assigned to secure the perimeter of the Base Aérienne 200. These are special forces armed with FAMAS, Minimi Para, and FR-F2 and are the sole known French users of the WASP 58 disposable AT launcher. These units will be granted the Security and Special Forces traits, with transports being either trucks, PUMA, or the new VIB. This latter unit is a Véhicule d’Intervention Blindé (Armored Intervention Vehicle), being an air force VAB T20/13 designed for airfield protection. Although visually slightly different, it will be roughly similar in stats to the latter with only two main differences: it is non-amphibious and will be a transport featuring the Security trait.\n\nInfantry crew-served weapon teams will be the RES. M40A1 recoilless rifle, MILAN ATGM team and the AANF1 machine guns.\n\nART\n\nA pretty mediocre tab. As explained, the division could not count on any organic artillery, only some reservist detachments.\n\nThis means regimental MO-81-61C 81mm and MO-120-RT61 120mm mortars, as well as the self-propelled VAB PM-81.\n\nHeavier guns take the form of reserve RES. HM2A1 105mm and RES. Mle. 50/63 155mm howitzers.\n\nTANK\n\nAn average category. The 152e Division d’Infanterie could count on a full regiment of light AML-90 used in a tank role. These will be divided into AML-90 PC command variant, a non-reservists variant, perhaps even vetted with experience as instructors, as well as the RES. AML-90 with Reservist trait.\n\nDedicated tank-destroying units are composed of the M201 MILAN.\n\nRECON\n\nA pretty strong category with the usual complement of AML-60 and AML-90.\n\nNew units include 4-man RES. ECLAIREURS with FAMAS, AANF1 and LRAC 73, transportable in either M201 or armed M201 MG (which mounts the AA52 which is an older AANF1 chambered in 7,5mm rounds).\n\nAlthough removed from frontline units, being either replaced with the ERC-90 or AMX-10RC, in 1989 France still had several hundred Panhard EBR armored cars in storage. There would be no better opportunity to include some of these golden oldies than in this battlegroup, thanks to its resident armored cavalry school unit. This vehicle will be modeled as a single card of the RES. EBR 90.\n\nIn the flying department, the Armée de l’Air replaced their Gazelle helicopters with the ECUREUIL before the French Army’s aviation arm, meaning the unarmed twin-engine helicopter will be deployable here first.\n\nAA\n\nA very good category. The French division only had a few regimental guns, but the Base Aérienne 200’s was very well-defended against air attacks, which is reflected in the units available.\n\nThese range from divisional 53T2 20mm guns, either towed or in the TRM-2000 TARASQUE variant.\n\nThe base and Plateau d’Albion as a whole fielded the (new) CERBERE twin 20mm guns (crewed by commandos, hence Special Forces trait) plus BOFORS 40mm guns, as well as self-propelled CROTALE SAMs and MISTRAL MANPAD teams.\n\nHELO\n\nNot very good with only a few armed helicopters available. From the base’s own squadron, a few ECUREUIL 20mm can be deployed with an autocannon.\n\nThe nearest outside helicopter force, which could deploy in support, would come from Lyon’s 5e Groupe d’Hélicoptères Légers’ in the form of (new) older ATGM-equipped ALOUETTE SS-11.\n\nAIR\n\nAs can be expected, the 152e Division d’Infanterie was close to several major air bases and could call on rapid French air support.\n\nThe closest one was rather unusual, though: the Patrouille de France (PaF)’s base at Salon de Provence, 50km away. The PaF is the Armée de l’Air’s aerobatic aerial team, with veteran pilots amongst its ranks. At the end of the 1980s, they had recently traded their older (but new in-game) FOUGA MAGISTER for (new) ALPHA JET E (without a gun). Both will be available as light but experienced bombers.\n\nMore existing aircraft will be added depending on the divisional needs once in playtesting.\n\nThe 152e Division d’Infanterie will be a reserve division with versatile infantry and many light armored cars sporting heavy armaments. This battlegroup will also have powerful anti-air defenses, with aircraft making up for the lack of artillery and helicopter forces.\n\nThe 76th Guards Airborne Division highlighted\n\nThe 76th Guards Airborne Division would have had the unenviable task of destroying the French nuclear weapons and likely die trying in the process. As can be guessed, the Soviet VDV formation traces its lineage back to World War II, where its parent division - the 157th Rifle Division - fought with distinction in various epic battles, including the Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Kursk, Operation Bagration, and the Berlin Offensive. After the war, it was reformed as a Soviet airborne division, part of the VDV.\n\nWhile it never served in the Afghanistan War, it was used to quell inter-ethnic tensions in the Soviet Union's near abroad in the late 1980s. In our WARNO scenario, with the “March to War,” it was pulled out and given plenty of time to prepare for their - potentially heroic but very much sacrificial - war mission.\n\nSince you should be pretty familiar with Soviet air assault units, let’s see how the 76th Guards Airborne Division compares to the currently featured 35th Guards Air Assault Brigade and Nemesis: Air Assault’s 56th Separate Air Assault Brigade. This Nemesis division leans more towards the base game’s 35th Guards being a mechanized airborne infantry division with widespread Forward Deployment trait. The only specific feature from the 56th Separate battlegroup will be the LuAZ amphibious jeep featuring the Forward Deployment trait replacing the UAZ.\n\nAlso, being a full division and not a brigade, it can count on a higher proportion of its infantry going to battle with BMD in support. It also receives an entire airborne artillery regiment. In Nemesis #2.2 - Plateau d'Albion’s deep raid scenario, no non-droppable heavy equipment will be available. This also means no Shilka SPAAGs and only a few helicopters.\n\nThe 76th Guards Airborne Division in WARNO\n\nHow will the 76th Guards Airborne Division look like in-game?\n\nLOG\n\nAs can be expected from an airborne division dropped far behind enemy lines, it will have to make do with only a few slots and no FOB.\n\nThe new supply units are the DESANT. LuAZ SNAB. and DESANT. GAZ-66B SNAB.\n\nCommand vehicles include the LuAZ jeep and BTR/BMD units.\n\nINF\n\nThe infantry available to the 76th is very strong. It will have all the DESANT. (except the AFGANTSY) units from the 35th Guards, but none of the DSh. and SPETSNAZ squads.\n\nBMD-borne DESANTNIKI will be featured in greater numbers than truck-borne ones (GAZ-66B). The division is also lavishly equipped with BMD-2, with transport option choices being BTR-D or BMD 2, but not the BMD-1.\n\nDESANT. SAPERY squads will get access to GAZ-66B and BTR-D.\n\nSpecialized ATGM teams will get access to the BTR-D and BTR-RD.\n\nNone of the infantry will be heliborne.\n\nThe DESANT. UAZ SPG-9 will be replaced by its DESANT. LuAZ SPG-9 counterpart.\n\nART\n\nActually pretty good, being very similar to the 35th Guards, but without the MT-LB VASILEK or NONA-K.\n\nOn the other hand, the division had many more 2S9 NONA-S but also included some DESANT. 2B14 82mm (introduced with 56th Separate).\n\nTANK\n\nAn average category with some limited choices (though better than the 35th Guards).\n\nTechnically, the 76th Guards featured no airborne-deployable tank. Yet, the division was (in 1991, so fitting within our “March to War” timeline) the first one to be equipped with a battalion (and a bit more, see the RECO category) of the new BMD-3. This, to be completely honest, was the main reason we picked the division for this Nemesis DLC.\n\nAs an IFV, the BMD-3 would have been too close to BMD-2 and would have been restricted to a single card of 4-strong infantry squads. Instead, we considered them to be regrouped as an “armored” battalion.\n\nThe division, therefore, will receive some BMD-3 “light airborne tanks” with +1 Front Armor (compared to the BMD-2) and armed with 30mm autocannon, Konkurs-M ATGM, PKT, and AGS-17 (thanks to the new 4th Weapon Slot).\n\nDESANT. UAZ KONKURS will be replaced with a DESANT. LuAZ KONKURS counterpart.\n\nNo D-44 nor BRDM-2 KONKURS.\n\nRECON\n\nThis category can be considered slightly better than the 35th Guards in terms of slots and costs while featuring a different set of units.\n\nIt can count on the DESANT. RAZVEDKA, SPETSNAZ GRU and 1V119 REOSTAT.\n\nThe UAZ KPV will be replaced with the new DESANT. LuAZ AGS-17.\n\nA new ”heavy DESANT. SCOUT\" (name to be translated) will be created, transportable with recon RAZV. BMD-2., or in the few armed and unarmed transport Mi-8 available.\n\nOne card of RAZV. BMP-3 as a “recon tank” will be added as well.\n\nLastly, another new unit will be the new recon SCHMEL-1 unarmed aerial vehicle with a specific UAV trait. Working as a plane, but from the RECO tab, these slow and fragile units will be very hard to spot and target and impervious to Suppression.\n\nAA\n\nPretty mediocre category. Though the 76th Guards had an entire AA battalion at its disposal, meaning slots, the choices are limited to light units only.\n\nThe division’s entire AA defense hinges on two weapon systems: Igla and the good ‘ol ZU-23-2.\n\nThe latter unit will come as a towed DESANT. ZU-23-2 and the self-propelled (and new) DESANT. GAZ-66B ZU-23-2 (based on the modified GAZ-66B, with Forward Deployment[[/i] trait).\n\nThe DESANT. IGLA MANPAD team, coming in LuAZ, BTR-D or BTR-ZD (mounting a ZU-23-2) flavors.\n\nHELO\n\nA pretty dismal category. In real-life, it only had under a dozen Mi-8 helicopters, mostly for support. Some of these will be given as transport options for recon troops.\n\nThis means none will be left as gunships.\n\nWe are still debating whether a single Mi-8MT card with rockets should be included.\n\nAIR\n\nThis is a pretty strong category. Considering that the 76 Guards would be on a one-way trip deep inside enemy territory, whatever close air support was given was to be long-range.\n\nThis means plentiful support of the Su-24, including a new AT variant fielding the Kh-29.\n\nSome long-range fighters will provide some critically needed air cover.\n\nThe 76th Guards Airborne Division uniquely features the BMD-3 in both a tank and recon tank role. This results in this VDV air assault formation being closer in style to the American 82nd Airborne Division (with its Sheridans) than comparable existing Soviet airborne battlegroups.\n\nGrand Final of SDL WARNO League Season 1\n\nBefore we leave, a message for your competitive WARNO players. The Grand Final of the SDL WARNO League Season 1 will be played this coming Saturday, the 3rd of August, at 3 pm CEST (4 pm BST).\n\nYukiPaw and Berthags, who both vanquished quite a few of the top players, will duel it out for the title to be crowned WARNO League Champion and a prize pool of over $300 dollars.\n\nAs always, the Grand Final will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch[www.twitch.tv].\n\nMake sure to read all the juicy details in on the SDL WARNO League’s website[playsdl.com].\n\nUntil Next Time\n\nThat’s all for this DevBlog. Next week, we’ll be back with Nemesis #2.3!\n\nJoin the WARNO community. Check the latest news on the Steam News page or visit the Steam Forums. Get together with other players on either the excellent Discord server[discord.gg], Reddit page, YouTube or our Instagram[www.instagram.com].\n\nSee you on the battlefield, commander.\n\nIt’s good to be back!\n\nIn today’s DevBlog, we’ll kick off WARNO’s very first (actually second, but more on that below) Nemesis vote. That’s right; for the next three installments, all the talk will be about Nemesis #2.\n\nThe kicker is that you can vote which of the three options you want developed. This upcoming Nemesis DLC will be hitting the WARNO shores at an unspecified date in the near future.\n\nWhile we are currently focused on polishing the new EA Pack Plus divisions (more on that below) and the upcoming NORTHAG expansion, in order to plan ahead, we want to launch Nemesis #2’s vote as soon as possible!\n\nGet ready for some in-depth “what if” WARNO Nemesis offerings. We’ll go first with today’s Nemesis #2.1 - The Hof Corridor, pitting the NATO’s West German 12. Panzerdivision versus the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet Protivotankovyy Rezerv or\n\nPTRez.\n\nLet’s dig in, commanders!\n\nThe Nemesis Concept\n\nBefore we continue, we’d like to give a big shout-out to our knowledgeable and passionate community members 22M3 and MustelidusMartens. They have helped us provide shape and historical context to this particular Nemesis #2.1! We couldn’t make a better WARNO with our (meaning you) community’s help.\n\nSo what is this Nemesis DLC? These are paid mini-expansions containing at least two paired or themed divisions - one from NATO and one from the Warsaw Pact - frequently bringing new units, vehicles, and weapons. Each Nemesis run features three different offerings. Once we have laid down all the juicy details in highly detailed previews, you get one week to choose your favorite option. After the vote concludes, one Nemesis is crowned the winner and enters Eugen’s development and production pipeline.\n\nNote that each of the Nemesis pairings are all “what if” battles, operations, or part of decisive campaigns in WARNO’s alternative World War III. They all take place in the fictional timeline as described within the base game, but are always grounded in reality and historical research. In essence, each Nemesis successfully chosen by you will “write” WARNO’s lore to a certain extent (but with caveats to not exclude other divisions, armies, nations, or weapons, further down the line).\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2978640/WARNO__Nemesis_1__Air_Assault/\n\nNemesis: Air Assault, featuring the Warsaw Pact’s Soviet 56-ya O.G. DShB or the 56th Separate Guards Air Assault and NATO’s US U.S. 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) is WARNO’s very first Nemesis DLC. The choice for this particular offering was already made ahead of time to speed up development.\n\nWith Nemesis #2, get ready for some very persuasive and imaginative propaganda battles. However, we kindly ask you to keep the ballot clean, with no cheating, flame wars, or other unwanted or toxic behavior. Be respectful to the vote and the fellow players, the devs, and the WARNO community as a whole! You know the drill, commanders.\n\nNemesis #2.1 - The Hof Corridor\n\nThe first Nemesis #2.1 - The Hof Corridor option refers to the… you guessed it… the Hof Corridor, a southern-facing valley leading from communist East Germany, near the Czechoslovakian border, into West Germany. It was considered one of the main invasion routes into enemy territory, one way or another.\n\nNemesis #2.1 takes its cues from WARNO’s Operation Götterdammerung, which features the East German Nationale Volksarmee guarding the southern flank of the Warsaw Pact’s offensive on Frankfurt. If you’ve played this scenario, you know the NVA 11. Motorisierte Schutzendivision is being driven back to Bamberg by the Bundeswehr’s 12. Panzerdivision, supported by American forces, and is forced to make a stand against overwhelming odds.\n\nNemesis #2.1 - The Hof Corridor considers what could have happened if the West German division broke through Götterdammerung’s East German blocking force. This would have resulted in the Warsaw Pact’s flank being opened, which pressured the Soviets to deploy the second-echelon Protivotankovyy Rezerv or PTRez. In a turn of events, in the narrow Hof Corridor, the Warsaw Pact’s reservist formation would have tried to stop NATO’s counter-offensive into East Germany proper.\n\nThe Bundeswehr’s 12. Panzerdivision highlighted\n\nThe Bundeswehr’s 12 Panzerdivision came into being in 1961, originally as a mechanized infantry formation. In the years that followed, it was designated a Panzer division and became part of the West German III Corps. Based in Veitshöchheim, Bavaria, it faced the southern border of East Germany.\n\nIn 1983, in a profound round of restructuring, the division parted with one of its panzer brigades to act as a III. Korp’s reserve. In turn, it received a forward-deployed American brigade. On top of that, the 12. Panzer gained the fire support of VII Corps and the 72nd Field Artillery Brigade. This meant that it changed from a pure tank division to a multinational mechanized infantry formation.\n\nIn war, operational command of 12. Panzerdivision would pass to the US VII Corps. On the southeastern flank of CENTAG, the West German formation had the explicit task of defending the Inner German Border between the US V Corps and VII Corps.\n\nHow would NATO’s 12. Panzerdivision look like in WARNO?\n\nOn to the meaty stuff. As highlighted, the 12. Panzerdivision is a bit of a mixed bag, not doing what it says on the tin. It was not a panzer division, was not under West German command, and, as the cherry on the cake, was not even completely German.\n\nIn terms of tank versus infantry distribution, it acts as the Bundeswehr’s “missing link” between the 2. Panzergrenadier and 5. Panzerdivision. The 12. Panzerdivision would be closer to a mechanized infantry, featuring a healthy mix of German and American forces.\n\nAs always, units that are both bolded and italic are new!\n\nLOG\n\nA blend of American and West German logistic and command units. Nothing too crazy or special.\n\nINF\n\nThe category will roughly follow a split between two-thirds West German and one-third American units.\n\nThis means an interesting mix between Bundeswehr PANZERGRANDIER in MARDER, plus JÄGER, PIONIER, with a smaller contingent of American MECH. RIFLES and ENGINEERS squads in M113 APCs.\n\nWeapon teams include MILAN and TOW, rounded out by MG-3, M60 and M2HB machine guns.\n\nOne of 12. Panzerdivision’s infantry battalion was the Panzergrenadierlehrbataillon 353. In peacetime, this formation was subordinated to Hammelsburg’s Kampftruppenschule 1 (Combat Troops School 1) as a training unit. It had access to more advanced weapons, in part to train other formations in new tactics and equipment. For example, in 1989, one of the battalion’s platoons fielded for testing all of the ~27 experimental G-11 rifles in existence. In WARNO’s alternative “march to war,” it comes to reason that the whole battalion would have been equipped in the same fashion. This leads us to a new unit, the vetted PZ.GRENADIER-LEHR with G-11 rifles, a machine gun, and Panzerfaust 3.\n\nAnother unit from the infantry’s school would be the PZ.VERNICHTUNGS. squads, similar to the East German PANZERJÄGER counterpart, with G3 and two PzF 3.\n\nART\n\nThe division’s artillery would be under American command. Given the vital mission of maintaining the link between NATO’s V and VII Corps, the 12. Panzerdivision was to receive lavish support from free-firing American artillerymen. This means that as a tank division, it will feature many more artillery pieces compared to similar Panzer or Panzergrenadierdivisions.\n\nThis includes access to the heavy self-propelled M110 and M270 MRLS on top of its own divisional artillery and US brigade units.\n\nTANK\n\nThere will be fewer slots than the 5. Panzerdivision, as our battlegroup has switched one full Panzerbrigade with a US Mechanized Infantry brigade.\n\nGerman tanks are of the (new) Leopard 2A1 variety, which stat-wise are identical to the 2A3, and the (new) Leopard 1A1A2 (with a slightly better accuracy compared to the 1A1A1 variant).\n\nThere is more: the 12. Panzer started replacing its Leopard 1A1A2 in 1989 with the more modern (and likewise new in-game) Leopard 1A4. This new unit will be deployable with one card, featuring a range and accuracy that is an intermediary between the Leopard 1A1A1 and 1A5.\n\nFurthermore, the German tanks are supported by American M1A1 Abrams.\n\nDedicated tank destroying units feature in a one-third proportion each of JAGUAR 1, JAGUAR 2 and M901 ITW.\n\nRECON\n\nThis category will be quite similar to the one found with the 5. Panzerdivision.\n\nA few Bundeswehr infantry scout cards will be replaced by US Army ones.\n\nAnd no FERNSPÄHER.\n\nInstead, a single card of an armed KIOWA helicopter will be added.\n\nAA\n\nNot all is nice and shiny. This category is rather mediocre, being closer to the 2. Panzergrenadier, which means no ROLAND.\n\nAnd even worse still… no I-HAWK either.\n\nIt will receive one card each of US PIVADS and STINGER MANPAD teams.\n\nHELO\n\nAnd another surprising category, but mostly in terms of what it lacks. Neither the 12. Panzerdivision nor the American brigade featured any combat helicopters. They could only bring to bear a handful of liaison and observation rotorcraft.\n\nThis means no helicopters… at all.\n\nYes, and this is a pretty big DISCLAIMER: we intend to design this Nemesis division without any helicopter force, buffing other categories to make up for this disadvantage. However, we need to test this new endeavor first. If it is not viable, we will attach a few helicopters from the nearby real-life 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (which likely wouldn’t have parted with any of its choppers to hold down its overextended front).\n\nAIR\n\nOn the other hand, the AIR category will be a generous one. Most aircraft will be American, with a handful of West German planes.\n\nThis will include a good selection of fighters to compensate for the below-average AA tab.\n\nThey also feature some dedicated tank busters to - again - make up for the lack of attack helicopters.\n\nOne new unit would be the addition of the Luftwaffe’s HFB-320/ECM electronic warfare plane. This is the West German counterpart to the US Air Force’s EF-111 RAVEN.\n\nThe Soviet PTRez highlighted\n\nOpposing NATO would be the ad-hoc Soviet-led Protivotankovyy Rezerv or, in short, PTRez. This “anti-tank reserve” formation was a crucial part of the Soviet’s defensive planning for the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. The origins of the strategy can be found in World War II, with improvised battlegroups quickly forming and deploying to meet any kind of enemy armored force, especially those that had broken through friendly lines. The anti-tank reserve continued to play a core role during the Cold War, taking into account more modern weapons and guided missile systems.\n\nThe PTRez would likely be reinforced with engineering units, which would form a Mobile Obstacle Detachment, delaying the enemy advance. The anti-tank fire was planned so that the enemy formation would have been subjected to a continuous barrage of fire. As can be imagined, the PTRez would squarely focus on defensive operations, not being very mobile in the field.\n\nWith NATO spearhead going through the Hof Corridor (as laid out previously), the PTRez would be formed around the 122nd Anti-Tank Artillery Brigade, based in Koningsbruck, and elements of the 34th Artillery Division. Additional reinforcements would come from local sapper and engineering units, with East German allies providing reservist manpower coming from one of the NVA’s Mobilization Divisions. These would be drawn from either the 6. Mot-Schützen Division in Konigswartha or the 10. Mot-Schützen-Division in Ronneburg.\n\nHow would the Warsaw Pact’s PTRez look like in WARNO?\n\nThe Protivotankovyy Rezerv would be an ad-hoc battlegroup formed from several independent anti-tank, engineer, and heavy artillery units, rounded by East German reservists. Static by nature, it aimed to let enemy armored spearheads break themselves on its heavy anti-tank shield.\n\nThe closest counterpart in WARNO in terms of structure would be the 119-y Odtelniy Tankoviy Polk, or 119th Independent Tank Regiment. But while this specialized formation was to be used for nothing else than assaulting and breaking through heavy defenses, the PTRez’s role was to be the exact opposite.\n\nLOG\n\nAs an improvised battlegroup with no dedicated logistical train, this category won’t be too generous (much like the 119th OTP). Due to the nature of some of the weapon systems available, heavy-duty KRAZ supply trucks will likely be deployable.\n\nCommand vehicles won’t include any IFV or helicopters, being confined to soft-skin vehicles or unarmed APCs.\n\nINF\n\nThe category itself is rather average but more forgiving compared to the 119th OTP thanks to East German reservist attachments.\n\nOnce again, much like the attack-focused 119th OTP, most of its infantry will be of the SAPERI kind (or similar). We would also add the new Mobile Obstacle Detachment (name to be determined) combat engineers. These will take advantage of the 4th weapons lot, with a mix of regular SAPERI (with explosives) and anti-tank dedicated squads (with two anti-tank launchers). These units will be supplemented by ZAGRADOTRYAD “blocking detachments.”\n\nDon’t expect any IFV as transport options, just standard APCs or trucks.\n\nThe Nationale Volksarmee would provide RESERVISTEN FÜH., RESERVISTEN and RESERVISTEN (s.MG) in SPW-152 and trucks.\n\nAnti-tank teams include the NVA’s SPG-9 and FAGOT ATGM, plus Soviet OTDELENIE PODDERZHKI, KONKURS ATGM teams and the rarer KONKURS-M.\n\nART\n\nAlthough not having artillery of its own, the battlegroup is reinforced by elements from the Soviet 34th Artillery Division, providing a heavy amount of support. There will be an average number of slots with reasonable prices.\n\nThis includes 2A65 MSTA-B 152mm and the BM-27 URAGAN in new incendiary ammo load-out. The BM-27 is not new, but its napalm payload will be.\n\nThe NVA provide D-30 122mm howitzers and Gr.Wfr M43 120mm mortar.\n\nTANK\n\nA divisional strong point. This category will feature lots of cheap slots. While the number of tank choices might be limited, there will be a wide array of anti-tank units on offer.\n\nThe only tank available will be the NVA reserve T-54B.\n\nThe rest of the forces featured are a mix of towed anti-tank guns and ATGM carriers.\n\nThe MT-12 RAPIRA and the new MT-12R RUTA, which is more accurate radar-guided upgrade.\n\nThe SHTURM-S ATGM carrier and the improved (and new) SHTURM-SM variant firing the new Ataka missile (which comes with 25 AP and the Tandem warhead trait).\n\nThe BRDM-2 KONKURS, with the NVA contributing some older BRDM-2 MALYUTKA.\n\nRECON\n\nThere was no organic recon battalion available to the battlegroup, only a few scattered patrol and security units. This category will be rather average but does feature some new units.\n\nThe Soviets bring RAZV. SAPERY, BRDM-2 and BRM-1.\n\nAUFK.PZ. PT-76B and the new RES.-AUFKLÄRER, which are 3-man scout teams riding in an East German (and new) SPW-40P, which is a BRDM-1.\n\nAA\n\nOnce again, no organic AA units were available to the battlegroup except a few guns for self-defense. Army assets would have complemented this. This means you’ll either deploy very light or very heavy anti-air units, with nothing in between. Furthermore, category slots are limited.\n\nEast German STRELA (with the new BTR-152 ZPU-2 as a light SPAAG and transport combo) plus the towed ZU-23-2.\n\nBacked by Soviet IGLA teams and heavy BUK.\n\nHELO\n\nOnly a few helicopters are available, mostly heavily armed MI-24 variants, including a new one, the MI-24V with Ataka anti-tank missiles (see the SHTURM-SM ATGM carrier above).\n\nAIR\n\nThis category will be very strong, with a complete flying arsenal, including the new MiG-27K loadout in two variants:\n\nKh-31P in a heavy SEAD role.\n\nKAB-500L laser-guided bombs.\n\nEA Pack Plus\n\nThat’s all for our first option, Nemesis #2.1 - The Hof Corridor. Before we leave, don’t forget that we recently announced two new divisions coming to the E Pack (making it, in effect, the EA Pack Plus). This was done to make amends for some of the snafus encountered during the official launch of WARNO out of Early Access. The EA Pack, featuring five divisions, was made available for free to all EA owners of WARNO and soon will be boosted to seven battlegroups!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2978610/WARNO__Early_Access_Pack/\n\nMake sure to read all about the two divisions: NATO’s US 35th Infantry Division and Warsaw Pact’s Rügener Gruppierung by clicking on the respective DevBlog links. These two divisions will be added for free to the already available EA Pack in the not-too-distant future.\n\nUntil Next Time\n\nThat’s all. Next week, we’ll return with Nemesis #2.2!\n\nJoin the WARNO community. Check the latest news on the Steam News page or visit the Steam Forums. Get together with other players on either the excellent Discord server[discord.gg], Reddit page, YouTube or our Instagram[www.instagram.com].\n\nSee you on the battlefield, commander.\n\nHello commanders,\n\nWe are back! In last week’s DevBlog, we talked about the first of the two new divisions being added for free to WARNO’s EA Pack DLC: NATO’s National Guard-focused US 35th Infantry Division.\n\nToday is the Warsaw Pact’s turn. Let’s shine a spotlight on the communist offering: the East German Rügener Gruppierung.\n\nLet’s go, commanders!\n\nEA Pack plus\n\nA brief note on the EA Pack. With WARNO’s official launch out of Early Access, we encountered some snafus, especially affecting the WARNO’s Early Access owners. To make amends, we promised to add two new divisions for free to the EA Pack.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2978610/WARNO__Early_Access_Pack/\n\nThe EA Pack, featuring five divisions, was made available for free to all EA owners of WARNO. Check out the existing formations by following the above link.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future (release date to be determined), we’ll add the new NATO’s US 35th Infantry Division and Warsaw Pact’s Rügener Gruppierung.\n\nThe Nationale Volksarmee’s Rügener Gruppierung\n\nThe Rügener Gruppierung takes its name from Rügen Island, on the East German Baltic Coast, where the communist Volksmarine had its main naval base. To defend this critically important site, a substantial local Nationale Volksarmee force was in place, to be bolstered by reservists and foreign allied troops at the outbreak of war. These formations, mostly training units and navy personnel, were to guard the base against the threat of NATO amphibious and air assaults.\n\nThe NVA’s Besondere Gruppierung II (Special Grouping II) was the name for this special force. Next to the Rügen Island, the mobilized defensive battlegroup was to secure the key Sassnitz ferry port, through which much of Warsaw Pact’s strategic supply entered East Germany. It was expected that this direct link to the USSR would be one of the first targets in a military exchange, with the East German and Soviet military fully expecting a naval assault by American marines.\n\nThe officers of the military academy Offiziershochschule “Otto Winzler” in Prora, together with the staff of the neighboring military technical school “Erich Habersaath,” would take command of the Rügener Gruppierung. The formation would also be composed of local motorized rifle units, engineers, a military transport regiment, and reservists.\n\nThe Rügener Gruppierung Detailed\n\nHow will the Rügener Gruppierung look in WARNO? Consider it the second “special group” of the East German Nationale Volksarmee (the other being the already in-game and EA Pack featured Berliner Gruppierung).\n\nIn very much the same fashion, the battlegroup contains various independent formations under a single command. In our Berlin case, the 1. Motorisierte Schutzendivision formed its core, while in Rügener Gruppierung, we are talking about a whole array of local East German units, further reinforced by reservists. As mentioned, divisional staff would be provided by the Offiziershochschule “Otto Winzler”. This HQ troop also provides the battlegroup’s coat of arms in WARNO.\n\nSince the island of Rügen was very close to the Polish border, and surrounding naval infrastructure a key asset for the Warsaw Pact, it was intended for the Poles to send additional forces to bolster the East German garrison quickly.\n\nHence, much like the Belgians teased with the base game’s West German 2. Panzergrenadier-Division, the Rügener Gruppierung will play host to the very first Polish units in WARNO!\n\nThe Rügener Gruppierung in WARNO\n\nAll right, let’s look at the mix of East German and Polish units you can expect with the Rügener Gruppierung.\n\nAs always, new units are marked in bold and italic.\n\nLOG - pretty good in terms of slots and costs. Although the battlegroup’s command structure was only semi-permanent, its logistical base was well-established thanks to the naval infrastructure on Rügen Island. This is reflected in the WARNO battlegroup.\n\nCommand vehicles are mainly non-combatant: UAZ-469 FÜH., SPW-60PUM (an East German variant of the Soviet CHAÏKA introduced with Nemesis: Air Assault’s 56-ya OG DShB) and the new helicopter Mi-2D.\n\nSupply units include the MT-LB MUN., URAL-4320 MUN. and the Volksmarine’s amphibious barge, the new SCHWIM. PTS-M MUN.\n\nINF - pretty strong, though not as powerful as a regular infantry division. The battlegroup can count on a varied amount of choices.\n\nThe core of the Rügener Gruppierung was the s.MSR 25, an independent motorized infantry regiment trained to cooperate closely with the East German Volksmarine. This unit provides a sizable chunk of the foot soldiers, though in smaller numbers. This includes:\n\nMOT.-SCHÜTZEN FÜH., MOT.-SCHÜTZEN, MOT.-SCHÜTZEN FÜH. (SVD) and MOT.-SCHÜTZEN (BTR), as well as PANZERJÄGER squads, PKM and GR.-MG. weapon teams, plus FAGOT and KONKURS ATGM teams.\n\nAdditional infantry squads are MILITARSTREIFEN, SICHERUNGS, VOPOS, plus the SPG-9 recoilless rifle available in regular foot team variant and jeep-mounted.\n\nFurthermore, a good chunk of the infantry is made up of RESERVISTEN FÜH., RESERVISTEN, and RESERVISTEN (s.MG), all lacking the Resolute trait.\n\nSpecific to Rügen island was the local Marinepionierbataillon 18, which, in war would have been quickly expanded to regiment-size through a large influx of reservists.\n\nLarge 12-man new MARINEPIONIER (with explosives) and MARINEPIONIER (Flam.) plus the leader variant MARINEPIONIER FÜH. will be featured. They lack the Resolute trait.\n\nAnd finally, a handful of Polish mechanized infantry will make their debut in WARNO.\n\nThese come in the form of the new PIECHOTA ZMECH. which are 7-man squads with AK, PKM and RPG-7VM, PIECHOTA ZMECH. (SVD) with two assault rifles replaced with one SVD and one extra PKM, and lastly, the command PIECHOTA ZMECH. DOW. with 7 men equipped with AK, RPG-76 Komar and smoke grenades.\n\nPolish infantry will ride to battle in either a new STAR-266 truck or TOPAS-2A APC (which is a modified BTR-50).\n\nART - rather average as this battlegroup didn’t have any dedicated artillery reserve. Most of the pieces available were regimental guns or simple mortars, sourced from local artillery or engineering schools. These include:\n\nThe Gr.Wfr. M43 120mm mortar.\n\nThe D-30 122mm and M-46 130mm howitzers.\n\nOne new - and quite rare - unit is the SPW-50PK(MRF) with the “MRF” standing for Minenräumfahrzeug. This is a mine-clearing vehicle, designed to fire two massive coffin-shaped explosive charges to clear enemy minefields. When used as an impoverished MLRS, it can deliver a devastating set of explosives at short ranges. It only contains two shots and no other weaponry. Consider this an East German “Pooratino”!\n\nTANK - mediocre in terms of slots and costs, but with some new options.\n\nEast German armor is quite rare in the area. There are some regimental KPz. T-55A, including the command variant, and the SPW-40P2 MALYUTKA-P courtesy of the s.MSR25.\n\nA single card of KPz. T-72 is also featured. A handful of these more “advanced” main battle tanks were located in a training and conversion academy near Rügen island.\n\nDrawn from the reserves, a new Nationale Volksarmee unit: the PAK K-52 85mm, which was a Czechoslovakian-made towed anti-tank gun with performance quite similar to the D-44. It lacks the Resolute trait.\n\nThe Poles will provide a single card of their trademark T-55AM MERIDA, considered an improved T-55AM2.\n\nRECO - very good and despite being far from the frontline, with plenty of naval helicopters and Grenztruppen to watch over the East German sea frontier.\n\nClassic recon units featured are AUFKLÄRER, AUFKL. PT-76B, and GRENZER. squads.\n\nNew units include the RES.-AUFKLÄRER, which are 3-man scouts with 2x MPi-KMS-72 (AK-47) and 1x LMG-K (RPK light machine guns), lacking the Resolute trait. They can either deploy in armed or unarmed UAZ-469 jeeps or in the new BRDM-1 armored scout car.\n\nThe other new unit is the PIO.AUFK.-TAUCHER, which are scout-engineer divers from the Marinepionierbataillon 18. These squads are reinforced by reservists, making them an 8-man recon squad fielding MPi-AKS-74N, LMG-K, and explosives, lacking the Resolute trait but coming with the Shock trait.\n\nThe cream of the crop will be the elite KSK or Kampfschwimmerkommando 18, the Volksmarine’s combat divers. These are special forces, much like a NVA’s version of the US Navy Seals.\n\nThe Rügener Gruppierung also contains the Volksmarine’s Marinehubschraubergeschwader 18 (Naval Helicopter Squadron 18), the sole user of the new AUKL.Mi-14PL. Although dedicated to anti-submarine hunting, this specialized helicopter carried a ton of sensors and electronic equipment, making it the first domestic East German radar recon helicopter in WARNO.\n\nUsed alongside the Mi-14PL for naval surveillance was the AUFKL. Mi-8TB. This variant is similar to the regular gunship variant but used instead as a recon helicopter decked in a classy blue naval livery. Our existing models have been “tinkered” with for the time being to accommodate the Malyutka rails, but will be redone entirely for the division (this new unit, as well as the existing Mi-8 variants).\n\nAA - another strong category, likely being the battlegroup’s strongest, thanks to its function as an anti-landing battlegroup.\n\nThe usual FLA-RAK. STRELA-2M, FLAK ZU-23-2, and a single card of FLA-SFL 23-4 SHILKA.\n\nNew units include the FLAK S-60 57mm and FLAK KS-19M2 100mm. The first is an ancient World War 2-era gun, a crude Bofors with a larger caliber. The second unit is, once again, an old gun but modernized. World War 2 buffs (and enjoyers of Steel Division 2) should be reminded of the Flak 88mm. This Cold War piece is a similar dual-purpose AA and AT gun, though its anti-air effectiveness lies more in quick-firing barrages and suppression rather than accuracy. However, in a sneaky feat of engineering, it is designed to fire the same ground shells as the T-55A, making good use as a secondary towed anti-tank gun!\n\nThe Volksmarine provides close air defense with several systems used in a shore-based role: the new FASTA-4 which is quad-Strela launcher, reminiscent of the JAVELIN LML; the LO-1800 FASTA-4, using the same missile system but made self-propelled by mounting it on a truck; and the W50 LA/A 25mm, which is a twin 25mm naval gun on a truck.\n\nLastly, a beast of a unit. We attached some old and rear area-defense SAMs to the battlegroup in the form of the 2K11M3 KRUG-M3, which is the KUB’s ancestor. Two massive SAM missiles, capable of pulverizing a small plane by just flying into them, feature a range similar to the BUK, but due to their obsolete targeting and on-board electronics can only engage aircraft (not helicopters). It has low accuracy, long reload, and (pricey) supply.\n\nHELO - average with only a few costly slots (though offset by interesting choices).\n\nThese include the light Mi-2URN gunship with rockets and machine guns.\n\nThe Mi-8TB heavy gunship (with the model to be remade, as mentioned before).\n\nThe new Mi-14PL was tested as an anti-ship killer armed with a single Kh-23M. This missile is the same as used by AGM by anti-tank planes. This means we now have a helicopter with a long-range “sniper” anti-tank missile.\n\nAIR - a pretty decent category with plenty of options, some being new. The battlegroup’s air arm focuses on close air support over air superiority with dedicated rocket- and anti-tank planes, plus bombers.\n\nThe sole fighter is the Mi-23ML [AA].\n\nThe Su-22M4 in various CAS loadouts (RKT, HE, CLU), but also a new Su-22M4K [AT2] version with 4x Kh-25ML anti-tank missiles.\n\nAnother new variant of an existing plane is the MiG-23BN [KMGU], which is the Warsaw Pact’s HE cluster answer to NATO’s anti-personnel TORNADO [MW1].\n\nAnd lastly, the Poles will provide the ancient Lim-6M, which is a locally produced variant of the venerable MiG-17. Deployed with the battlegroup in full rocket loadout, it's more at home close to the border rather than being deployed in the field by a frontline Polish division.\n\nThe Rügener Gruppierung is a reserve defensive battlegroup with strong AA and versatile infantry. This division will be more at ease defending than attacking.\n\nUntil Next Time\n\nThat’s all for the EA Pack Plus divisions. We hope to be able to share when they launch soon. We’ll return with more juicy WARNO news next week…\n\nJoin the WARNO community. Check the latest news on the Steam News page or visit the Steam Forums.
