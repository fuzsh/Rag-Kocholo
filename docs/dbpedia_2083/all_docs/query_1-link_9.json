There are frequent references to the commander of the 56th New York Regiment, Col. (later General) C.H. Van Wyck. The earliest diary (Jan. 1862-Jan. 1863) begins with brief daily entries noting weather conditions, visits with friends and family, drills, recruiting attempts, and other details. From April through August, Crossman's diary describes fighting and marches during the Peninsular Campaign in Virginia and continues chronicling the regiment's encampment at Yorktown, Va., and departure for North Carolina by ship. Included at the end is a supplemental detailed entry (10 May 1862) about the Battle of Williamsburg. The diary for 1863 describes events and conditions during the regiment's encampments at Morehead City, N.C., St. Helena Island, S.C., Seabrook Island, S.C., and Beaufort, S.C.; maneuvers on the Stono Inlet and James Island; fighting on Morris Island, and attacks on Fort Wagner (Charleston, S.C.); and Crossman's duties on a court martial tribunal. The 1864 diary continues with entries concerning Crossman's law officer duties; picket duty at Pigeon Point and other locations at Beaufort, S.C.; an expedition to Johns Island, S.C., and fighting near Legareville in July; visits home to New York State; and Crossman rejoining his regiment in early December, just before a bloody engagement at DeVeaux Neck, near Coosawhatchie, S.C. Crossman's 1865 diary opens at DeVeaux Neck, where his regiment is holdinga position near a stretch of the Charleston & Savannah railroad and being shelled by a Confederate battery. Further entries concern a march from Fort Coosawatchie to Charleston, S.C.; a period of respite in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.; entrenchment guard duty at Rekersville, S.C.; the raising of the Union flag at Fort Sumter on 14 April; a march to Newberry, S.C.; Crossman's dealings with freedmen and their former owners in Greenville, Union, and Spartanburg districts in South Carolina; mustering out at Charleston; and Crossman's return to New York.
