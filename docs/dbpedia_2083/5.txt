The 56th Infantry Division "Casale" (Italian: 56ª Divisione di fanteria "Casale") was an infantry division of the Royal Italian Army during World War II. The Casale was activated on 15 June 1939 in Forlì and named for the city of Casale Monferrato and recruited most its men from the Romagna region. The division was sent to Greece as occupation and force. There the division was disbanded by invading German forces in the Aetolia-Acarnania region of Greece after the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943.[2][3]
