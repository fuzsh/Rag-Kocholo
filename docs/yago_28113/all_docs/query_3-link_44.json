        "text": "Reading Mary of Burgundy\n\nHours of Mary of Burgundy\n\nMary of Burgundy Reads\n\nMary of Burgundy appears immersed in a particular hour in 1477, realizing in the theatre of her mind the presence of Mary. Her intercessor, incarnate in imagination, offers solace.\n\nMarys father, Charles the Bold, has died, leaving her at twenty the Duchess of Burgundy. Louis XI of France threatening her inheritance, offers the reconciliation of marriage, but she will prefer Maximilian of Austria, the future Holy Roman Emperor (1493).\n\nHer reading begins with a flourished O, perhaps the beginning of a poem she would particularly cherish at this pressing moment: Obsecro te (I beseech thee) \n\nCome and hasten to my aid and counsel,\n\nin all my prayers and requests,\n\nin all my difficulties and necessities,\n\nand in all those things that I may do,\n\nmay say, or may think, in every day, hour,\n\nand moment of my life. And obtain for me,\n\nthy servant, from thy beloved Son\n\na full measure filled with all mercy and consolation,\n\nwith all counsel, with all aid\n\nand help, with all blessing and holiness,\n\nwith all salvation, peace and prosperity,\n\nwith all joy and eagerness. Obtain also\n\nan abundance of all good things, spiritual\n\nand bodily, and the grace of the Holy Spirit\n\nso he may set all things in good order for me,\n\nguard my soul, guide my body, uplift my senses,\n\ncontrol my ways, approve my actions,\n\nperfect my wishes and desires,\n\ninstill holy thoughts, forgive my past evils,\n\nemend those of the present and temper\n\nthose in the future, and grant me\n\nan honest and honorable life.\n\nMarys reading, a spiritual exercise, depends for effect on her active participation\n\nin specific settings, in actualizing a real moment.\n\nThomas Becket Approaches Mary\n\nHer prayer follows the inspiration of a predecessor, Thomas Becket, also actualizing a particular moment. Becket, as chancellor of England (115562), had furthered the policies of Henry II of England. But as archbishop of Canterbury (116270) he acted independently, refusing to cede church prerogatives to the monarch. A devote of Mary, he composed the Obsecro te that now inspires Mary.\n\nA flourished capital recalls in black the death Becket will face with Marys support, as well as the death of Marys father, Charles the Bold. Thomas Becket turns from his former king to Mary, the object of his present and enduring veneration. Surely Mary of Burgundy, herself oppressed with suitors, enjoys the power of Mary to supplant Henry as the object of Beckets devotion.\n\nMarys Nature and Revelation\n\nMary may revive spirits through springtime flowers. Variety appears not just in diversity of shapes, colors, sizes, but also in every individual of a common species. The least flower, the tiniest of moths, all of creation, lives with distinction. Mary recognizes also in the shortening days of autumn the character of death, the passage of all mortals. Each skull she notes, carries the distinctive impressions of individual experience.\n\nMary no doubt appreciates in scallop shells the situations of souls seeking\n\nthe guidance of James, patron saint of pilgrims. Each shell, lovingly individuated, reminds her of the animate being now removed to joy or sorrow. Presently,\n\nperhaps, she has in mind the page of nature and of revelation from which flows\n\nher Obsecro te. Within the blue circle of Marys sky, light warms and shapes\n\nflowering sprays. Each violet, clothed in blue, dew-fed, reaches upward\n\nand outward. Among such blues, animate moths and dragon-fly rest\n\nfor future flight. Mary shares perhaps with William Blake the energy and focus\n\nTo see a world in a grain of sand,\n\nand heaven in a wild flower,\n\nhold infinity in the palm of your hand,\n\nand eternity in an hour.\n\nMary Builds Chartres\n\nMary's blue robe, a relic brought to Chartres in France by crusaders returning from Jerusalem, mirrors the celestial blue sky surrounding her in heaven. Sunlight radiates from each. Suppliants before her robe, like suppliants looking up to the blue cloak of heavens, seek her presence, her light. Miracles follow.\n\nWhen fire destroyed her Romanesque church in 1194, stone crumbled, metal melted, but her robe survived intact. Her message: build a suitable home. The present Chartres Cathedral, consecrated in 1260, established the structures and energies which would populate Europe with Notre Dames, unprecedented communal centers,\n\nall arising within a few score years. Pointed, ribbed vaulting buttressed outside enabled vertical heights unimagined previously, with openings for light-radiating rose windows, with lancet windows opening out lancet walls, illuminating Marys virtues.\n\nWide participation in the construction brought together communities,\n\nkings and commoners, men and women, elders and youth. Stories abound.\n\nKings and commoners side-by-side pull stone-carts to rising walls.\n\nBen Shahn invites continuing participation \n\n. . . an itinerant wanderer traveling over country roads in thirteenth-century France who comes across a man exhaustedly pushing a wheelbarrow full of rubble. He asks what the man is doing. God only knows. I push these damn stones around from sunup to sundown, and in return, they pay me barely enough to keep a roof over my head.\n\nFarther down the road, the traveler meets another man, just as exhausted, pushing another filled barrow. In reply to the same question, the second man says, I was out of work for along time. My wife and children were starving. Now I have this. Its killing, but Im grateful for it all the same.\n\nJust before nightfall, the traveler meets a third exploited stone-hauler. When asked what he is doing, the fellow replies, Im building Chartres Cathedral.\n\nWithin one-hundred years Notre Dame spreads through the power of Mary gothic structures and gothic practices throughout Europe.\n\nMary Brings Light\n\nThose seeking Marys intercession at Chartres literally stand in heavenly light. Every hour of every day varies Marys presence: circumstances ─ weather, politics, economics, moods ─ shift and flow. Life generating sunlight, infinitely inflected with Marys intercessions, move each and every suppliant. At vespers (evening), approaching the Western portal, the setting sun animates the judgment day arching the doorway, anticipating two approaching worlds, the illuminations of heaven, the shadings of hell. Within, eastward, altar candles anticipate morning sunrise. At transept, northern exposure offsets temperate South rose, realizing under the protective wall the temperate garden which shelters all creatures.\n\nWhat drives such activity? Not, presumably, the technical discovery of vaulting, flying buttresses, illuminated glass. More, the spirit of Mary, a new influence manifesting new circumstances and desires throughout Europe in the 12th century.\n\nThe Art of Courtly Love\n\nIn 1137, Eleanor succeeded her father William X, as ruler of Aquitane, and married (by prearrangement of her father) Louis VII of France. She joined Louis on the second crusade, and exercised considerable influence in arts as well as politics at Champagne. At Poitiers, she established courtly life and manners praised by troubadours of the time. Her daughter Marie, Countess of Champagne, inspired The Art of Courtly Love (Liber de arte honeste amandi et reprobatione inhonesti amoris), written about 1185 by her chaplain André. Divorced from Louis in 1152, she married Henry Plantagenet, 12 years her junior. Her children by both marriages came to occupy a significant portion of European thrones. Chaucers Troilus and Criseyde assumes the conventions and psychology implicit in the art of courtly love.\n\nThe Art of Courtly Love"
