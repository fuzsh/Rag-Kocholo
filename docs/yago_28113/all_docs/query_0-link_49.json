        "text": "King Louis XI and Charlotte of Savoy, his wife, were buried in the Basilica of Notre-Dame, Cl√©ry in 1483. A tomb with the bronze statue of the King was executed by the goldsmith Conrad of Cologne. In 1562, during the Wars of Religion, the tomb was destroyed by Protestants.\n\nIn 1622, Louis XIII commissioned a new, smaller tomb in marble, which was destroyed during the French Revolution, but the statues of the king and four angels were preserved."
