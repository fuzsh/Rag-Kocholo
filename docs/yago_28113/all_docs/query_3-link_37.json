He believed he who has success has honor, and that was as close to honor as he ever got. Never kept promises. He was too cheap to buy a new hat but spent countless sums on buying back lost border cities. He had control of most French territory at his death. <> 1480 Annexed Anjou into France by Louis XI.\n\n1483 He was followed by Charles VIII his son."
