        "text": "1464 - 1505\n\nBorn of the royal blood of France, herself a queen, Jane of Valois led a life remarkable for its humiliations even in the annals of the Saints. Saint Jane was the hunch-backed, pock-marked, deformed daughter of King Louis XI and Charlotte of Savoy. Her father, who had hoped for a son to succeed him, banished Jane from his palace, and, it is said, even attempted her life. At the age of five the neglected child offered her whole heart to God, and yearned to do some special service in honor of His blessed Mother.\n\nAt the kings wish, at age 9, though against her own inclination, she was married to the Duke of Orleans, the future King Louis XII. The marriage was forced upon Louis and never consummated. Towards an indifferent and unworthy husband her conduct was always most patient and dutiful. Her prayers and tears saved him from a traitors death when her brother, King Charles VIII determined to execute him for rebellion and shortened the captivity which his rebellion had merited.\n\nStill nothing could win a heart which was already given to another. When her husband ascended the throne as Louis XII, and wanted to marry Ann of Brittany, his first act was to repudiate by false representations one who through twenty-two years of cruel neglect had been his true and loyal wife. He had Pope Alexander VI declare his marriage to Jane null. Jane offered no objections and accepted the situation with the patience that marked her entire life. At the final sentence of separation, the saintly queen exclaimed, God be praised Who has allowed this, that I may serve Him better than I have heretofore done.\n\nShe retired to the duchy of Berry given her by Louis and lived a secluded life of prayer and good works in its capital of Bourges. She there realized her long-formed desire of founding the Order of the Annunciation, in honour of the Mother of God. Under the guidance of\n\nSt. Francis of Paula, the director of her childhood, St. Jane was enabled to overcome the serious obstacles which even good people raised against the foundation of her new Order. In 1501, with the help of a Franciscan friar, Blessed Gabriel Mary (Gilbert Nicholas; August 27) Nicolas, Joan founded Les Annonciades of Bourges, a contemplative order of nuns to pray and work for reconciliation of enemies.\n\nThe rule of the Annunciation was approved by Alexander VI. The chief aim of the institute was to imitate the ten virtues practiced by Our Lady in the mystery of the Incarnation, the superioress being called Ancelle, handmaid, in honor of Marys humility.\n\nSt. Jane built and endowed the first convent of the Order in 1502. She herself was professed in 1504. She died in heroic sanctity, A.D. 1505, and was buried in the royal crown and purple, beneath which lay the habit of her Order.\n\nIn art, Joan is a crowned abbess in the habit of the Annunciation sisters with a crucifix and rosary. Sometimes she may be shown (1) holding the Christ-child by the hand with a basket on His arm (not to be confused with Saint Dorothy who is never a nun); (2) with a cup of wine and basket of bread; (3) as the Christ-child places a ring on her finger; or (4) with Blessed Gabriel Mary, OFM, who co-founded the Annunciations (Roeder). She is venerated in Bourges (Roeder).\n\nReflection\n\nDuring the lifetime of St. Jane, the Angelus was established in France. The sound of the Ave thrice each day gave her hope in her sorrow, and fostered in her the desire still further to honour the Incarnation. How often might we derive grace from the same beautiful devotion, so enriched by the Church, yet neglected by so many Christians! Helped by Pope Sixtus IV who was the first to attach an indulgence to the Angelus in 1475, devotion to this prayer continues today, and is enshrined in the great Impressionist painting of Jean-Francois Millet (1814-1875) of the Barbizon school of landscape painting. It is interesting that almost two-hundred years after Pope Sixtus encouraged the praying of the Angelus a painter named Jean-Francois created a work expressing the devotion to Our Lady that St. Jane (Jeanne) of Valois, whose spiritual directors were Franciscans, practiced.\n\nWe cannot escape suffering in this world so we might as well profit from it spiritually as did St. Jane, who though queen, was humiliated repeatedly by the very people who should have loved and cherished her. She is a great example of suffering with joy. Let us pray for the gift of seeing hardships as opportunities to strengthen our faith in Christ, and may we respond to every hardship by giving it an eternal value.\n\nPrayer\n\nLord God, you teach us that the commandments of heaven are summarized in love of you and love of our neighbour. By following the example of St. Jane of Valois in practicing works of charity may we be counted among the blessed in your kingdom. Grand this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen."
