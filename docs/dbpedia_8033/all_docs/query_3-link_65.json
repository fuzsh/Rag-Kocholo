        "text": "The Residence at Village Greens has expanded its leadership team with the addition of three new members with local ties as the senior living community prepares for its grand opening this summer.\n\nBerks County residents Jenn Fick, Tina Boyer and Dan Walter will play pivotal roles in shaping the vibrant and modern community in Sinking Spring. Fick will serve as the Director of Independent Living Operations, Boyer as the Administrative Services Director and Walter as the Safety and Maintenance Engineer.\n\n“The addition of Jenn, Tina and Dan to our leadership team is a testament to our commitment to providing exceptional care and a vibrant community for our future residents,” said Terri Sanelli, Executive Operations Officer of The Residence at Village Greens. “Each brings a wealth of experience and a deep connection to Berks County, which will greatly benefit our residents as we prepare to open our doors this summer. We are thrilled to have such dedicated and passionate professionals join us in this exciting journey.”\n\nFick was born and raised in Berks County, where she attended nursing school and eventually began working in senior living in 1988.\n\n“I have experience as a nursing assistant and as a nurse in memory care and skilled nursing communities,” Fick said. “My husband and I owned and operated a local hearing aid business from 1996 until we sold it in April. I’m excited and honored to begin a new chapter as part of such a wonderful team of professionals who have also helped improve the lives of seniors for such a long time. I look forward to welcoming the first residents to such a beautiful, fun and vibrant community.”\n\nBoyer brings more than 16 years of experience in senior living care while serving as a business office manager at another local senior community.\n\n“My greatest reward is listening to the residents tell their stories and learning about their lives prior to their living in a senior living community,” Boyer said. “I thoroughly enjoy getting to know the residents and their families.”\n\nBoyer has resided in Berks County her entire life and is eager to be a part of the state-of-the-art new senior living community at Village Greens.\n\n“I feel very honored to be a part of the newest senior living community in Berks County and to bring our excellent care and compassion to every resident that enters our community,” Boyer said.\n\nWalter has lived in Berks County since 1978 and moved to Douglassville 10 years ago. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, he retired from teaching. After a brief tenure at UPS, Walter joined IntegraCare-operated Exton Senior Living as Safety and Maintenance Engineer.\n\nAfter spending more than a year at Exton, Walter joined the team at IntegraCare’s new community in Sinking Spring in June.\n\n“Working for IntegraCare has been a great experience, as you are not only welcomed as part of the ‘family,’ but you also become part of a ‘family’ with the residents,” Walter said. “The cooperation of every staff member, the acceptance and respect you develop with both staff and residents is above par in any profession of which I have been a part of.\n\n“I look forward to the Residence at Village Greens opening.This will enable us, as a team, to show off the hard work already put forth and to offer seniors the best option in the area for a senior living community.”\n\nFor more information, contact The Residence at Village Greens Community Relations Directors Heidi Lyons at hlyons@integracare.com or Kim Kostival at kkostival@integracare.com."
