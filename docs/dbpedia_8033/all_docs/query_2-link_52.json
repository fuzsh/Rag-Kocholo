        "text": "The Supreme Court’s historic verdict allowing states to sub-categorise Scheduled Castes (SCs) for reservation will have far-reaching effects on India’s social and political landscape. It is not just a legal victory but a successful culmination of a long-drawn people’s struggle at a time when issue-based political mobilisations are facing unprecedented challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nThe reservation system in India was created to correct historical injustices and to promote fairness among disadvantaged groups. It aims to provide better access to education, jobs and political power for the deprived sections. However, over the years, it has become distorted with dominant sections among the reserved groups ending up cornering most, if not all, reservation benefits. As a result, there are widespread inequalities that have come to the fore amongst reserved categories.>\n\nThe reservation policy has not uniformly benefited all sub-castes, resulting in conflict among Dalits. Communities such as the Madigas in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka; the Arunthathiyars and Chakkiliyans in Tamil Nadu; and the Valmikis and Majabis in Punjab have long expressed concerns over injustice being meted out to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nThe impact of this judgment will be significant. It empowers marginalised communities to stand up for their rights, giving them the legal backing to demand their fair share of opportunities in education, jobs and political representation. This ruling will inspire these communities to actively voice their needs and advocate for their rights.>\n\nPolitically, this decision is expected to lead to important changes. It calls for fair representation, ensuring that all SC communities get their due in proportion to their population. This could create a more inclusive political environment where the voices of the most disadvantaged are heard and considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nSub-categorisation across India>\n\nSome states have implemented sub-categorisation within the SC quota to address specific disparities. In Tamil Nadu, the state government there introduced special reservations for the Arunthathiyars within the SC quota in 2009.>\n\nBihar established the ‘Mahadalit’ category in 2007, initially excluding certain SCs such as Chamars and Paswans, and expanded this category in 2015.>\n\nSimilarly, Haryana created a new group called ‘Deprived Scheduled Castes’ in 2020, excluding communities like Chamars and Ravidasias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nStates’ demand for sub-classification>\n\nStates like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka have called for sub-categorisation within SCs to address specific community needs, such as those of the Madigas. The Madiga community constitutes a significant number in the three states. Yet, the Malas happened to have benefitted the most – in fact, at the cost of Madigas – from reservations in the last 75 years.>\n\nIt was in the Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where a movement for Dalit sub-categorisation emerged from the clear articulation of the need to divide the reservation pool among Dalits across the country.>\n\nAlso read | Hyderabad: With Modi Attending MRPS Meeting, Will Dalit Sub-Categorisation Gain Steam?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Madigas in the then-united Andhra Pradesh began voicing their frustration over the long-standing dominance of the Malas in SC reservations. For generations, the Malas have enjoyed the lion’s share of these benefits, leaving the Madigas and other sub-castes struggling for opportunities in employment and education.>\n\nThis deep-rooted inequality ignited a movement within the Madiga community, which eventually birthed the Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS). Spearheaded by Manda Krishna Madiga, the MRPS has played a crucial role by highlighting the issue, carrying out protest demonstrations and by acting as a pressure group on political parties to concede to the demands of the Madigas.>\n\nKarnataka\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nIn Karnataka, the Holeya caste has emerged as a dominant group, disproportionately garnering resources meant for the Dalits since independence. Their influential position is evident across various socio-economic and political spheres within the state. In contrast, the Madiga community remains to this day one of the most marginalised groups, actively seeking the equal distribution of resources and opportunities.>\n\nThe demand for sub-categorisation has gained momentum in Karnataka, as communities, particularly the Madigas, strive to secure their rightful share of reservations and opportunities in education and employment. This push for sub-categorisation aims to address the inequalities faced by the Madiga community and ensure that benefits are equitably distributed among different sub-castes within the SCs.>\n\nTamil Nadu\n\nAdvertisement\n\n>\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Paraiyar and Pallar communities are the dominant castes among SCs, significantly influencing the socio-economic and political landscape of the state. Their prominence is evident in various sectors, where they play key roles in shaping policies and community dynamics.>\n\nIn contrast, the Chakliars and Arunthathiyars are among the most disadvantaged Dalit castes, facing systemic barriers that limit their opportunities in both economic and political spheres. These groups often struggle with limited access to resources and representation, highlighting the stark disparities within the broader SC category.>\n\nAddressing the challenges faced by the Arunthathiyar community, Aathi Thamizhar Peravai (ATP) was founded by Athiyamaan in 1994 in Coimbatore. The movement aims to uplift the Arunthathiyars, who have historically faced discrimination and marginalisation. The ATP seeks to raise awareness of the issues confronting this community, often viewed as outcastes, and draws inspiration from influential leaders like B.R. Ambedkar and Periyar, promoting social justice and equality.>\n\nSince its inception, the ATP has worked to highlight the community’s history and combat negative stereotypes. With a population exceeding six million, the Arunthathiyars have a strong advocate in the ATP, which pushes for better living conditions and social rights.>\n\nThe movement emphasises the need for recognition and respect for the Arunthathiyar identity, aiming to empower its members and improve their socio-economic status. Through its efforts, the ATP has become a vital voice in the ongoing struggle for Dalit rights in Tamil Nadu, striving to create a more equitable society for all.>\n\nState-level commissions to address disproportionate SC reservations>\n\nDue to the inequitable distribution of reservations within SCs, various states constituted committees to remedy the situation.>\n\nIn 1975, the Punjab government, through the Justice R.N. Prasad Committee, reserved benefits for the Balmiki and Mazhbi Sikh communities, recognising their extreme economic and educational backwardness.>\n\nThe 1997 Justice P. Ramchandra Raju Commission in Andhra Pradesh recommended categorising SCs into Groups A, B, C and D to ensure that benefits reached the most disadvantaged.>\n\nSimilarly, the 1990 Justice Gurnam Singh Commission in Haryana divided the SC list into Block ‘A’ and Block ‘B’, placing 36 castes in Block ‘A’, and the Chamar caste, which had availed the most benefits, in Block ‘B’.>\n\nThe 2003 Lahuji Salve Commission in Maharashtra recommended the sub-classification of the Mangs caste, while the 2005 Justice A.J. Sadashiva Commission in Karnataka proposed dividing 101 castes into four categories, each receiving 15% of the reservation.>\n\nIn 2007, the Mahadalit Commission in Bihar identified 18 extremely weak castes, including the Musahar, Bhuiyan, Dom and Rajwar, for special consideration.>\n\nThe 2008 Justice M.S. Janarthanam Committee in Tamil Nadu recommended differential treatment in reservation for the Arunthathiyar community, highlighting the need for targeted policies to address specific vulnerabilities within SCs.>\n\nHistorical judgment for sub-classification>\n\nOn October 12, 2023, the Supreme Court constituted a seven-judge constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, to deliberate on State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh. This case centres on the issue of sub-classification within the SC and ST categories. Starting on January 17 this year, the court adjudicated the matter by attaching related cases from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.>\n\nThe seven-judge constitution bench was primarily examining two key issues: (1) whether sub-classification among the reserved castes should be permitted and (2) the validity of the decision in E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh, which ruled that the SCs notified under Article 341 constitute a single homogeneous group that cannot be further sub-categorised.>\n\nAfter three days of extensive hearings, the bench reserved its final judgment, which was pronounced on August 1 allowing for sub-classification within the reservation system. The seven-judge bench delivered a 6:1 majority verdict, overturning the 2004 judgment in the E.V. Chinnaiah.>\n\nJustice B.R. Gavai, in his judgment, invoked B.R. Ambedkar’s words: “Unless we have social democracy there is no use of political democracy.”>\n\nWith the apex court ruling in favour of sub-quotas, it now falls upon state governments to enact legislation demonstrating their commitment to the cause. With competing political interests, political parties could push the issue once again into oblivion. It is important to note that earlier when states did sub-classify on their own (without the Supreme Court’s backing), dominant Dalit sub-groups lobbied to get those decisions reversed. State governments should not give in to such lobbying, to go against the top court’s verdict.>\n\nDalit sub-groups should continue to exert pressure on the state and political parties to ensure that legislation is enacted following the due process of collecting empirical evidence to rationally divide the quota amongst Dalit sub-groups. One only hopes it does not take another movement and decades of waiting to see Dalit sub-categorisation become a reality.>\n\nDr Suman Damera is an assistant professor at the Department of Public Administration, Pachhunga University College (PUC), Mizoram University, Aizawl. >"
