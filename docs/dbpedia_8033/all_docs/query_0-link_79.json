        "text": "Shekhar Suman Recalls The Hardest Time of Life When His Elder Son Ayush Died Due To Endomyocardial Fibrosis (EMF).\n\nActor Shekhar Suman who is all set for the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Netflix series Heeramandi, recently opened up about the heartbreaking loss of his son, Aayush, who passed away at the young age of 11 due to a rare disease called Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF). This disease is extremely rare, affecting only a handful of people worldwide. In a candid interview with ABP Live Entertainment, Shekhar Suman recalled the hardest journey of his life when he and his wife, Alka, went through during Aayush’s illness. Suman revealed son Aayush bravely fought for four years against the odds.\n\nShekhar recalled the painful moment when Aayush died, expressing the profound grief and sense of helplessness they experienced. He described spending countless nights beside his son, knowing that one day he would go. “You can imagine the depth of our despair… We spared no expense in seeking the best medical care available worldwide. We sought solace in spirituality, visiting numerous places of worship, embracing Buddhism, and praying day and night. But there are miracles in life, things that are destined to happen, happen. Despite this, by some divine intervention, Ayush defied the odds and lived not just for eight months, but for four years. However, the looming reality of his eventual fate weighed heavily on us. I would spend sleepless nights gazing at his face, knowing that one day we would have to bid him farewell. Our sense of helplessness was overwhelming, our hearts shattered into pieces. We felt as though we were dying alongside him,” Shekhar recounted.\n\nHe further said that his father, Phani Bhushan Prasad, who was a high-profile doctor, had saved countless lives through his medical practice, but “couldn’t save his grandson”.\n\nRecalling the day Ayush passed away, Shekhar said, “The day arrived when we had to admit him to the hospital. After receiving the doctor’s verdict, I cradled him in my arms. He was lifeless, he had left us. I kept lying with him, with his body, all night, all day, and cried a lot. Alka also cried a lot, but she eventually regained her composure. What greater anguish, sorrow, and agony is there for parents than to bid farewell to their child, to offer them to the flames, and to encircle the funeral pyre? We hoped time would ease the pain as it heals wounds, but instead, the pain intensified.”\n\nShekhar concluded by saying he sees Ayush in younger son Adhyayan. “In Adhyayan, we were able to witness Ayush and his happiness, almost as if he blessed his younger brother”, said Shekhar Suman."
