        "text": "My purpose: Help individuals and organisations drive a better future in an exponential world!\n\nCurrent associations: I work with professionals, business-owners and start-ups globally; help bring clarity, explain the overlooked and misunderstood, and align mindset with the new paradigms of a changing world.\n\nI am engaged as a Resident Mentor with India's top-ranked (1st in 2019) Business School, Indian Institute of Management Bangalore for mentoring business owners and start-ups; with OpenExO, the global transformation advisory, as an Ambassador and Coach for coaching professionals and helping enterprises become ExO; with PES University as an Adjunct faculty in School of Design; with Singularity University Bangalore chapter, as a leadership team member, for evangelising tech-driven changes for a better world.\n\nCareer diversity: I have played senior leadership roles for long years with Infosys, India’s poster-child in the IT Services space; set-up and run a company in Europe and worked in the social business space for a year. The variety and scale of exposure have been rare and rewarding, working across multiple functions and geographies (4 continents) have been fascinating, and dealing with thousands of talents around the globe have enriched me as an individual. While I have driven large enterprise level changes, which has given me excellent internal insights and understanding of the human-side of business; I have also worked closely in the marketplace with client leaders and global industry forums like PMI Exec Council to get ringside view of the world of business.\n\nAll these have helped me develop not only a 360 view of business, but importantly gain a world view of things. I have gathered several dots during this journey and today I connect them to help professionals and business, offer them alternate perspectives, challenge their thinking, help them explore better and align mindset. I coach leaders on ExO and help them transform their organisations.\n\nI am also a keynote speaker in several global conferences, leading enterprises of the world, universities and institutions of repute. As I evangelise the theme of exponential, I also run a video series on LinkedIn, titled \"Path to Exponential\", and that is drawing very active viewership and conversations globally.... A few links given below for reference.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6530644204698288129 https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6533162836766625792 https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6536187700960161792\n\nCredentials: A graduate engineer from India’s reputed Jadavpur University and MBA from another premiere institution, XLRI. I have led several award-winning teams in Infosys and elsewhere. The reward for me personally, was a formal acknowledgement as one of the top 8 mentors at Infosys, by the legendary NRN, Infosys founder, Chairman and Chief Mentor."
