        "text": "Babru, the first Kannada film to be shot entirely in the US, is set for release in May-June.\n\nThe unit has completed the shooting and is now busy with post-production. ‘Babru’ is the first project of Yuga Creations and Suman Nagarkar Productions.\n\nDirected by Sujay Ramaiah, it has Suman Nagarkar in the female lead, while Gurudev Nagaraja is its executive producer.\n\nBabru is a comeback film for Suman, popularly known as Beladingala Baale (Moonlight Girl),\n\nin remembrance of her role in the eponymous film.\n\n“Ours is the first Kannada film to be shot entirely in America. A few Kannada short films and documentaries have been shot in America, but not a full-length feature film,” Gurudev says.\n\nGurudev left for the US in 1999 on an assignment in the IT sector and settled there. He has now ventured into filmmaking, he says, to reinvent himself.\n\nThe Lok Sabha elections, the 12th season of IPL, school and college examinations will be done in the next three months, and that is when the film will hit the screens, Gurudev says.\n\n“We launched the project in February 2018 and shot on weekends and holidays. Sometimes, we took 10 days off from work to shoot,” he says.\n\nBabru deals with journey of two strangers from Mexico to Canada. It is a suspense drama lasting two hours.\n\nThe strangers meet accidentally. Towards the end, they realise they are both from Karnataka.\n\nThe total distance travelled in the movie is 1,500 miles, but in reality, the cast and crew travelled 10,000 miles.\n\nOn the title, Gurudev explains: “Babru is actually the name of a car which plays a major role. In America, you can have your name printed on the number plate by paying an additional fee. Babru in Kannada means Vaahana (vehicle). Hence, we chose it for the car.”\n\nThe film shows parts of America never before seen on the Kannada screen, he says. “We want to prove that Kannadigas living abroad can make films abroad. Our project will surely inspire many others,” he says.\n\nA capella music\n\nBabru will be the first Kannada film to use a capella music, according to Gurudev. A capella is music made with voices mimicking musical instruments. Poornachandra Tejaswi has composed the music."
