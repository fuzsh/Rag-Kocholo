        "text": "Since he picked up the cricket bat at the age of 13, Tirumalsetti Suman has known to be an aggressive opening batsman. Hailing from the state of Andhra Pradesh, he captained the Hyderabad Under-16 side and made it to the Ranji probables in 2001. In the same year, he performed well against the England Under-19s. He idolizes Australiaâ€™s Damien Martyn.\n\nSuman made his first-class debut in the year 2003-04 and since then has been on the fringes of the Hyderabad team. He represented Hyderabad in the 2009 season of the Indian T20 league, where he helped the team with consistent batting at the top and his wicket-taking off-spin. In 2011, he was brought in by Mumbai before getting signed by Pune in the 6th season."
