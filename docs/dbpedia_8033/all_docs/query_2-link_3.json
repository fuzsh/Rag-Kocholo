        "text": "St. Vivekanand Millennium School, HMT Township, Pinjore, organized free health check-ups for all teachers and staff under the ‚ÄúWe Care For You!‚Äù program following the mantra of ‚ÄòArogyam Param Bhagayam Swasthyam Sarvarthasadhanam‚Äô. The modern lifestyle has tightly held our daily routines, leaving us with no time to take care of our health. Our health should be our top priority. Our ancient scriptures have also emphasized the importance of a healthy body as the first step towards a healthy life. In this regard, all teachers and staff were given essential guidelines in advance, such as fasting for at least 10-12 hours. This blood check-up included a lipid profile, thyroid profile, and fasting sugar test, conducted by Malhotra Medical Lab Sector-22, Chandigarh. Acharya Rishi Kumar Sharma, TGT, expressed his gratitude and said that the event organized by the school management is a symbol of intimacy and belongingness. It not only introduces everyone to the concept of health but also provides an opportunity to identify physical weaknesses, which are often neglected in our busy lives. He expressed heartfelt appreciation for the school management and the principal. Saurabh Sevala, PGT, commended the health-related activities organized by the school management. He stated that through this initiative, all teachers and other staff members would remain committed to the school's progress while taking care of their health. Principal Dr. Piyush Punj also emphasized that in life, we can regain everything we lose, but once our health deteriorates, it becomes impossible to recover. In today's busy world, we hardly find time for regular exercise or pay proper attention to our diet, leading to various health issues. The only solution to avoid all these problems is regular health check-ups. He concluded that for all members (teaching staff, administrative staff, and other employees), there could be no better gift than this on Teacher's Day. The school has been organizing this activity for the past five years, and everyone expressed their gratitude to the school management for this invaluable gift. #WeCareForYou #wecare #WeCare4U #VivekanandMillenniumSchool #SchoolInPinjore #CBSESchoolInPinjore #LearningEveryDay #EducationForAll #Education #School #SchoolLife #Learning #LearningIsFun #Literacy #Development\n\n#DhampusFoundation #hdsn School oral health programs in rural communities play a crucial role in improving the overall health and well-being of children. Here are some key points highlighting their importance: 1. **Access to Dental Care**: Rural areas often lack adequate dental care facilities and professionals. School programs ensure that children receive essential dental check-ups and treatments they might otherwise miss. 2. **Preventive Care**: These programs focus on preventive measures like fluoride treatments, dental sealants, and education on proper brushing and flossing techniques, which can significantly reduce the incidence of dental caries and gum diseases. 3. **Education and Awareness**: They educate children and their families about the importance of oral hygiene, diet, and regular dental visits. This knowledge helps in forming lifelong healthy habits. 4. **Early Detection and Treatment**: Regular dental check-ups in schools can help in the early detection of dental issues, preventing more severe problems that can arise if left untreated. 5. **Reducing Health Disparities**: Rural communities often experience higher rates of oral health issues due to limited access to care. School programs help bridge this gap, ensuring all children have the opportunity for good oral health. 6. **Impact on Overall Health**: Poor oral health can affect overall health, leading to problems such as infections, pain, and issues with eating and speaking. Improving oral health can enhance children's general health, nutrition, and quality of life. 7. **Academic Performance**: Dental problems can cause pain and discomfort, leading to absenteeism and poor concentration in school. By addressing oral health, children can perform better academically. 8. **Community Benefits**: Healthier children lead to healthier communities. As children grow, they can carry the importance of oral health into adulthood, influencing future generations and reducing the overall burden on healthcare systems. Implementing effective school oral health programs in rural areas is essential for promoting long-term health, reducing disparities, and ensuring that all children have the opportunity to thrive.

This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need for action to ensure that every student has access to the menstrual hygiene products they need to thrive. üí°üí¨ Moreover, a mere 36% of rural schools have adequate and private toilets for girls, which are essential for changing menstrual products safely and hygienically. Without proper facilities, girls may face discomfort, embarrassment, and even health risks during their periods. üöΩüå∏ As educators, policymakers, and advocates, it's our responsibility to prioritize the menstrual health and hygiene needs of students. By investing in accessible sanitary products and improving school infrastructure, we can create an environment where every student feels supported, comfortable, and empowered to focus on their education. üìöüí™ Let's come together to break the silence surrounding menstruation, dismantle barriers to menstrual hygiene access in schools, and ensure that all students have the resources they need to manage their periods with dignity and confidence. Together, we can make a difference! üåüü©∏ #MenstrualHygiene #Education #Empowerment #HealthForAll #SchoolsForAll üí¨üöÄ #shutterstock\n\nAs someone who is passionate about menstrual health and skill development, if I were in a position of power, I would focus on implementing comprehensive menstrual health education programs in schools and communities. This would include: 1. Curriculum Integration Integrate menstrual health education into school curricula, ensuring that students of all genders receive age-appropriate information about menstrual health, hygiene, and management. 2. Community Outreach Implement community-based programs that provide menstrual health education and resources to individuals who may not have access to formal education, such as in rural or underserved areas. 3. Access to Products Ensure that menstrual hygiene products are affordable and accessible to all, including those from low-income backgrounds, by providing subsidies or free distribution programs. 4. Skill Development Integrate skill development programs, such as vocational training or entrepreneurship workshops, into menstrual health education initiatives to empower individuals with the knowledge and resources to manage their menstrual health and create sustainable livelihoods. 5. Policy Advocacy Advocate for policies that prioritize menstrual health education and access to menstrual hygiene products, and work towards destigmatizing menstruation in society. By focusing on these areas, I believe we can create a more inclusive and empowered society where individuals have the knowledge, resources, and skills to manage their menstrual health and contribute to their communities.

Nearly half of 16-24-year-olds have gone without period products, impacting their education and wellbeing. In 2023, the Department for Education collaborated with the menstrual sector, leading to a wider variety of period products in schools and improved advice on tackling period stigma. Our key recommendations: ü©∏ Extend the scheme permanently. ü©∏ Evaluate effectiveness and reach. ü©∏ Provide clear, evidence-based guidelines. ü©∏ Ensure equitable implementation across the UK. Period inequity extends beyond schools. We call on the UK government to: ü©∏ Legislate for free period products in public places. ü©∏ Provide accessible menstrual healthcare. ü©∏ Ensure shame-free, inclusive education about periods.
