        "text": "Karnataka High Court\n\nOm Suman vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2021\n\nAuthor: K.Natarajan\n\n1 IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 29TH DAY OF JULY, 2021 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. NATARAJAN CRIMINAL PETITION NO.5325 OF 2021 BETWEEN OM SUMAN S/O UTTAM JANA AGED ABOUT 24 YEARS R/AT NO.20/3, ANJANADRINAGAR 7TH CROSS, SHETTIHALLI BANGALORE. ... PETITIONER (BY SRI. AKRAM PASHA K., ADVOCATE) AND 1. STATE OF KARNATAKA BY BAGALAGUNTE P S BANGALORE REP BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HIGH COURT COMPLEX BENGALURU - 560 001 2. ANIL KUMAR S/O GOVINDAPPA AGED ABOUT 39 YEARS R/AT NO.73, 4TH MAIN MARUTHI EXTENSION KAMAKSHIPALYA BENGALURU - 560 079 ... RESPONDENTS (BY SRI. B.J. ROHITH, HCGP) 2 THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF CR.P.C. PRAYING TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS IN S.C.NO.39/2019 ON THE FILE OF THE LX ADDITIONAL CITY CIVIL AND SESSIONS JUDGE AT BENGALURU FOR THE ALLEGED OFFENCE P/U/S 353, 307 OF IPC AND FURTHER BE PLEASED TO PASS ANY ORDER COMMENSURATING WITH THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE. THIS PETITION COMING FOR ADMISSION, ON THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING: ORDER\n\nLearned HCGP takes notice for the respondent-State.\n\nThough this matter has come up for admission and hearing on\n\nI.A.No1/2021, with the consent of learned counsel for the\n\nparties, the matter is heard finally.\n\n2. The petitioner has filed this petition under Section\n\n482 of Cr.P.C., challenging the order passed by the LX\n\nAdditional City Civil and Sessions Judge, (CCH-61),\n\nBengaluru (hereinafter referred to as 'the trial Court' for short)\n\nin S.C. No.39/2019 for having dismissed the application filed\n\nby the petitioner under Section 227 of IPC.\n\n3\n\n3. Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner and learned HCGP for the respondent - State and\n\nperused the material on record.\n\n4. The case of the petitioner is that one Anil Kumar,\n\nrespondent No.2 herein residing at Mahalakshmi Layout has\n\nfiled a complaint before the Bagalagunte Police Station on\n\n15.01.2018 alleging that a missing complaint of a girl was\n\nregistered in Crime No.21/2018. Trying to catch the accused,\n\nhe went to Shettihalli and with the help of the parents of the\n\nvictim girl when he was searching the accused, the accused-\n\npetitioner came in a motor bike near Anjanadri Layout\n\nbetween 9.30 am to 10 a.m. Immediately, he tried to stop the\n\nvehicle by showing signal, but the accused did not stop and\n\nobstructed the complainant from discharging his official duty\n\nand caused the injuries. When the complainant fell down on\n\nthe ground, with an intention to commit his murder, the\n\npetitioner-accused rode the motor bike over the complainant\n\nand thereafter, the accused tried to escape. The petitioner is 4 also said to have fallen down from the Bike. Then, the\n\npetitioner-accused was apprehended and was taken to the\n\nHospital.\n\n5. After registering the case by the Police, the\n\ncomplainant stated that the petitioner was attempting to\n\ncommit his murder. Hence, the complainant has prayed for\n\ntaking necessary action against the petitioner-accused. After\n\nregistration of the case, the Police filed FIR for the offence\n\npunishable under Sections 307 and 353 of IPC. The\n\ninvestigation is completed and charge sheet has been filed.\n\nThe case was committed to the trial Court. The petitioner had\n\nfiled an application under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. praying to\n\ndischarge him from the charges. The same was rejected by\n\nthe trial Court by the impugned order dated 02.07.2021.\n\nHence, the petitioner is before this Court.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner has seriously\n\ncontended that looking to the injuries sustained by the 5 complainant which are simple in nature, there was no intention\n\nby the petitioner to commit the murder of the complainant. Of\n\ncourse the petitioner might have obstructed the complainant\n\nfrom discharging his duties, but he had no intention of\n\ncommitting his murder. The ingredients of the complaint will\n\nnot attract Section 307 of IPC from framing the charges. The\n\ntrial Court committed an error in dismissing the discharge\n\napplication and hence, he prayed for allowing the petition to\n\ndischarge the accused-petitioner for the offence punishable\n\nunder Section 307 of IPC.\n\n7. Per contra, learned HCGP has seriously objected\n\nand contended that for the purpose of attracting Section 307\n\nof IPC, injury is immaterial and only the intention has to be\n\nconsidered. Therefore, he prayed for dismissal of the petition.\n\n8. Upon hearing the arguments of learned counsel\n\nfor the parties and on perusal of the materials on record, it is\n\nevident that admittedly, since the girl was missing, the 6 complainant was in search of the accused. When the\n\ncomplainant was proceeding towards Anjanadri layout\n\nbetween 9.30 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. on 15.01.2018, the\n\ncomplainant found the accused coming in a motor bike. In\n\norder to apprehend or arrest the petitioner in the said case, at\n\nthe time of stopping the vehicle, the accused is said to have\n\ntried to escape without stopping the vehicle and dashed\n\nagainst the complainant. Due to which, the complainant has\n\nsustained injuries and fell on the ground. The petitioner has\n\ntried to ride the motor bike over the complainant, thereby\n\ntrying to commit the murder of the complainant.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\nthere was no intention of the petitioner to commit murder and\n\nthe injuries were also simple in nature. The wound certificate\n\nof the complainant was also produced. There are three\n\ninjuries, which were all simple in nature. Learned counsel also\n\nsubmitted that the accused has filed a private complaint\n\nbefore the Police and examined the Doctor. Thereafter, the 7 XXXI Additional CMM Court, Bengaluru took cognizance of\n\nthe offence against the complainant and three others for\n\nhaving causing grievous injuries to the petitioner and also\n\nSections 341, 323, 324, 326 and 506 read with Section 34 of\n\nIPC. The Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence\n\nagainst the complainant and others.\n\n10. Looking into the case and counter case, the\n\ninjuries sustained by the petitioner and the complainant is an\n\nadmitted fact. Now the question that arises for consideration is\n\nas to whether the injury is necessary for consideration in order\n\nto attract Section 307 of IPC or not. In this regard, the trial\n\nCourt has relied upon the judgment of the Bombay High Court\n\nin the case of 'Vasanth Virthu Jadhav Vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra', reported in (1997) 2 Crimes 539 (Bombay),\n\nwherein it has held that in order to attract Section 307 of IPC,\n\nthe intention or knowledge with which all was done is\n\nimportant irrespective of the result. The provision of Section\n\n307 of IPC reads as under:\n\n8\n\n\"307. Attempt to murder.--Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.\"\n\n11. On bare reading of Section 307 of IPC, it is\n\nevident that first part of the definition which shows that\n\nwhoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and\n\nunder such circumstances that if he by that act caused death,\n\nhe would be guilty of murder and punishment would be\n\nimprisonment which may extend upto ten years also shall also\n\nbe liable to pay fine and second part says if hurt is caused to\n\nany person by such act, then the offender shall be either liable\n\nto imprisonment of life or to such punishment as is\n\nhereinbefore mentioned. Second part of definition of Section 9 307 of IPC clearly reveals that if hurt is caused, then the\n\npunishment is imprisonment of life. Only intention or\n\nknowledge is important.\n\n12. In the present facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, the injury may be simple in nature. As stated, accused\n\nhas caused injury by dashing the motor bike against the\n\ncomplainant without stopping the vehicle. After complainant\n\nfalling down, the accused tried to ride the vehicle over the\n\ncomplainant with an intention to commit the murder. Of\n\ncourse, the injury may be simple in nature but the intention or\n\nthe knowledge is very important to attract for the offence\n\npunishable under Section 307 of IPC. The statement of the\n\ncomplainant/injured cannot be disputed at this stage. Accused\n\nmight have sustained grievous injuries as he has also fallen\n\ndown as per the statement given by him, but in view of the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the\n\ncontention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner that 10 Section 307 of IPC would not attract in case of the petitioner is\n\nnot sustainable.\n\n13. On the other hand, in view of the findings, there\n\nare sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused for the\n\noffence punishable under Section 307 of IPC. There is no\n\nerror or illegality in the order of the trial Court dismissing the\n\napplication for the offence punishable under Section 227 of\n\nIPC. The impugned order does not require any interference of\n\nthis Court.\n\nAccordingly, petition stands dismissed.\n\nIn view of dismissal of the main petition, I.A.No.1/2021\n\ndoes not survive for consideration.\n\nSD/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nMds."
