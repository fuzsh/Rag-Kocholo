        "text": "Suman\n\nSuman’s story is one of female resilience, survival and seeking joy in Rajasthan, India. A heartbreaking experience during my travels as I was faced with the reality that I was powerless to help her without endangering her life or my own. Sharing a short but poignant time with Suman taught me the value of freedom which I took for granted up until that point.\n\nSuman experiences physical and emotional violence daily within her home. In spite of this there remains a fire in her eyes. A fire in her soul. Her curiosity and lust for new experiences was strong. For experiences that have been denied to her because she was born in a small conservative city. Raised in a culture that programmed her to be subservient from a young age. I saw within her an intense desire for a freedom I had that was elusive to her.\n\nI hope that her unrealised desire does not send her into the abyss of madness. I hope that somehow she finds the strength and will to escape, survive and thrive despite the worst odds, despite the reality of being ostracised, tormented and isolated as a result of her escape. Despite the psychological trauma that will haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\nLike many unhappy arranged marriages, Suman lives an enslaved life. At home she is controlled by her husband and mother in law. Outside her home her movements are watched closely by her neighbours and reported back to her husband.\n\nIn spite of this Suman has an incredible lust for life. In our secret places within the house she hula hooped, danced, shared her history, smoked a few puffs of a joint. All in her shy way. A shyness typical to humans that have been abused."
