        "text": "I went looking for adventure 🗺️, but instead.. ..found my next calling in the most unexpected place... A few months ago while travelling through the pristine badlands of Madhya Pradesh, I discovered the lightest, most delicious curd-churned ghee I'd ever tasted🤌 I could not be more surprised with its subtle sweetness. I found two secrets behind this extraordinary ghee : · First, it is made from the milk of the A2 Hariana cows 🐄, which graze on the grass nourished by the mineral-rich waters of the Chambal River. This imparts a natural sweetness to the ghee. · Second, cold-processed and handcrafted using the traditional bilona method preserves the ghee's nutritional content.🧑🍳 Imagine starting your child's day with millets from Maharashtra, topped with a dollop of Bilona ghee made from the A2 milk of the Gir cow from the foothills of Mount Girnar in Gujarat⛰️, followed with lunch flavoured by yellow mustard oil from villages in Uttar Pradesh, and end the day with cookies baked in coconut oil from Perumanna village in Kerala.🥥 They say, it takes a village to raise a child. This sparked an idea: What if everyone could access these hand-crafted, natural luxuries from every Indian village, from the comfort of their homes? This is why we started Village Company. 💚 The two pillars which form the base of our company are: First, Unmatched product quality, guaranteed by our 100% Delight Promise. If you're not 100% delighted, receive a 100% refund! Second, customer centricity: I fondly recall spending the first few months personally hand-delivering orders and getting to know each one of my earliest customers.. 🚚 We spent the last few months in new product launches, supply chain and branding. And today, it gives me great pleasure to see how far we have come and what more the future holds. I am delighted to welcome you at villagecompanystore.com and hear anything and everything you feel about us! 💚 #VillageCompany #BilonaGhee #womenentrepreneurs #womeninbusiness #SupportLocal #FMCG #startup #MadeinIndia #village Tushit Bharthuar Anurag Tiwari Pranav Raj"
