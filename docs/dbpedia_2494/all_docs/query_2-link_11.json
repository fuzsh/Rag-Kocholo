        "text": "\"What is a love song?\" seems like a trite way to kick off a list such as this, but it's a valid question with varied answers. When one looks at the annals of popular music, a \"love song\" may seem simple to define, but there are many variations on what it means exactly. Essentially, a love song is a song dedicated to the celebration, loss, discovery, or longing for love and affection.\n\nThroughout years of music, you'll find classic love songs of every ilk: the ode to pining for love from afar; the bitter rumination on love gone wrong, the recognition of love in a lasting connection; the woeful betrayal of the heart. Some of these “I love you” songs picked up Grammys; others became cult classics. Some of these songs are odes to finding your soulmate, some are tributes to unrequited love—but they've all shaped the sound and scope of the Hip-Hop love song.\n\nSo, in honor of 50 Years Of Hip-Hop, here are the ROCK THE BELLS staff picks for the 50 GREATEST HIP-HOP LOVE SONGS.\n\n50. LOTS OF LOVIN'\n\nPete Rock & C.L. Smooth\n\nA standout track, this 1992 smash is a 90s standard. The dynamic duo from Mt. Vernon showcased their soulful approach on their classic debut album Mecca And The Soul Brother. On this hit single, Peter and Cory delivered a romantic track for the ages. C.L. spits rhymes about loving his lady that are both conscious and heartfelt as he rhymes over Pete Rock's lush sample of the Ohio Player's cover of \"What's Going On.\" It's a musical moment that helped cement Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth as one of the most remarkable duos in rap. And show that \"real Hip-Hop\" has no shortage of romance. —Stereo Williams\n\n49. NO GREATER LOVE\n\nBlu & Exile\n\nIs there anything greater than an everyday living life love song? Blu makes a case for just that in “No Greater Love” from the 2007 classic, Below the Heavens. The always lyrically impressive Cali MC makes you yearn for a barefoot-around-the-house, early morning-snuggling kind of love. —Jacinta Howard\n\n48. BEAUTIFUL SKIN\n\nGoodie MOB\n\nThe foursome out of Atlanta had been known for their fiery street politics and thoughtful-beyond-their-years sage wisdom, but T-Mo, Khujo, Big Gipp, and Cee-Lo broadened their topical and musical range on their underrated sophomore album Still Standing. One of the cornerstones of the project is this heartfelt ode to Black womanhood, as the four emcees woo the sisters with words of adoration, respect, and love. —Stereo Williams\n\n47. WHAT'S LUV?\n\nFat Joe feat. Ashanti, Ja Rule\n\nFat Joe's transformation from Bronx street rap \"Flow Joe\" to chart-topping \"Don Cartagena\" was cemented with this smash featuring Ashanti and Ja Rule. Over skittering production from Irv Gotti, Joey Crack's rhymes are more contradictory than complementary to Ja and Ashanti's Tina Turner-referencing hook: while she sings, \"it should be about trust, it should be about us,\" Joe sounds like he just wants to get laid. The infectious single put the D.I.T.C. veteran squarely at the top of the pop charts, and Fat Joe became a crossover superstar. —Stereo Williams\n\n44. GOTTA MAN\n\nEve\n\nThe singsongy hook and lighthearted production from Swizz Beatz made this hit single from Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders' First Lady inescapable in 1999, and it helped make E-V-E a household name even amongst the superstar Ruff Ryders crew. With an assist from Mashonda, the Philly native raps about her boyfriend, showing love for his street bonafides and those sweet nights alone. A song that cemented her status as the ride-or-die chick of late 90s rap. —Stereo Williams\n\n43. LUV U BETTER\n\nLL COOL J\n\nLL COOL J is the king of the Hip-Hop love song, a place he’d secured long before this entry into his long discography. Here though, he proves he still has a lover’s touch over production from The Neptunes during their dominant run in the early aughts. LL’s lovelorn apology to his woman almost doesn’t even matter because the two-step vibes are so heavy on this mid-tempo gem. —Jacinta Howard\n\n42. THE LOVE RAP\n\nSpoonie Gee\n\nFollowing the template that he created on 1979's \"Spoonin' Rap,\" Spoonie Gee dropped one of his most monumental records with 1980's \"Love Rap.\" The Pumpkin-produced, drums-only track sees Spoonie riding down the street and encountering a young lady who he expresses interest in. \"Love Rap\" became a breakbeat within itself: first-generation Hip-Hop DJs used it in their sets and as a soundbed for their MCs. —JayQuan\n\n41. THE LOVER IN YOU\n\nBig Daddy Kane\n\nThe King Asiatic is truly Nobody's Equal when it comes to Hip-Hop love songs. Long considered one of rap's most suave personalities, Kane hit a home-run with this Prince-sampling guide to how to properly love your lady down. Over a stellar flip of The Purple One's 1986 hit \"Pop Life,\" Kane offers everything from movie recommendations to rub downs. —Stereo Williams\n\n40. 21 QUESTIONS\n\n50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg\n\nIt is historically noted that, in the early 2000s, 50 famously took down a certain other Queens-born chart-topper with a penchant for singsongy \"thug love\" anthems. The G-Unit frontman then supplanted his one-time rival with...a singsongy thug love anthem. This smash features one of Nate Dogg's all-time best hooks, as 50 shows that he can get charmingly lovey-dovey with the best of them. —Stereo Williams\n\n39. CAN YOU GET AWAY?\n\n2Pac\n\nPac was no stranger to making songs for the ladies; but he most often fell into two categories: sista-girl anthems like “Keep Ya Head Up,” or horn-dog come-ons like “How Do U Want It?” or “I Get Around.” “Can You Get Away?” falls into neither category, it’s arguably the most unapologetically charming and sweet Pac ever got on a single track, as he attempts to woo a young lady away from her trash boyfriend. —Stereo Williams\n\n38. HONEYDIPS IN GOTHAM\n\nThe Boogiemonsters\n\nThe quartet dropped their stellar debut The Underwater Album at the height of Death Row domination, and as such, the quirky charm of Vex Da Vortex, Mondo and brothers Myntric and Yodared went unheralded by many in the mid-90s. But the video for leadoff track \"Recognized Thresholds Of Negative Stress\" became a Rap City fixture, and this—the album's second single—became a nerd rap classic; an enduring and endearing ode to all the pretty girls in the city. —Stereo Williams\n\n37. SLOW IT DOWN\n\nLittle Brother\n\nA breezy jam that embodies the homie-next-door spirit Phonte and Rapper Big Pooh are so great at delivering, “Slow It Down” is one of the many reasons The Minstrel Show is so appreciated. Pooh keeps it earnest and simple—he’s trying to “see what’s really good” with the woman he’s been eyeing. As for Phonte, there are few artists as capable of delivering super relatable relationship stories as he is. Here, he’s in top form, especially when he closes the song with one of his most quotable verses in a career full of them, stamped by this classic bit of honesty: “I want a girl when I want a girl, and when I don’t want a girl I want a girl who understands that.” —Jacinta Howard\n\n36. CHERRY WINE\n\nNas feat. Amy Winehouse\n\nThere’s something haunting about “Cherry Wine”—as it was recorded posthumously after Amy Winehouse’s untimely death in 2011. And yet, the throwback duet produced by Salaam Remi evokes a spirit of yesteryear when the likes of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terell would trade love-filled odes to one another. —Alec Banks\n\n35. IS IT GOOD TO YOU?\n\nHeavy D & The Boyz\n\nYet another banger from none other than Teddy Riley, this beloved hit from Heavy D & The Boyz perfectly crystallized everything that made the Heavster such a favorite. With Riley reworking the famous vamp from Junior’s “Mama Used To Say,” Heavy’s charisma is on full display, as he spits his charm and offers his lady everything from rub downs to a little nookie in the garage. There’s even a Charles In Charge reference. What’s not to love? —Stereo Williams\n\n24. HEY LOVER\n\nLL COOL J feat. Boyz II Men\n\nOn this hit single, Uncle L perfected the rap ballad lane that he'd helped define for a decade. The sample of Michael Jackson's \"Lady In My Life\" is truly one of the decade's most inspired, as LL rhymes about loving the lady down passionately, with Boyz II Men providing the seductive harmonies and \"this is more than a crush\" hook. A smash from 1995's Mr. Smith, it was further proof that LL COOL J set the standard for Hip-Hop love songs. —Stereo Williams\n\n23. HOW'S IT GOIN' DOWN\n\nDMX\n\nWhen DMX kicked down the door of rap's late 90s \"jiggy\" era, he was heralded as the gritty antidote to all of the shiny suits. But X was always versatile, and he showcased a softer side with this hit from his debut, It's Dark And Hell Is Hot. Whether the original or Faith Evans-assisted video version, it remains one of Dark Man X's purest love songs, as he woos a lady by acknowledging even a thug needs affection. —Stereo Williams\n\n22. WE FIGHT/WE LOVE\n\nQ-Tip feat. Raphael Saadiq\n\nQ-Tip’s 2008 album, Renaissance is full of down-to-earth, groovy love songs, including one of its most notable entries, “We Fight/We Love,” which perfectly captures the push and pull between lovers over Raphael Saadiq’s bubbly bassline. —Jacinta Howard\n\n21. IN THE MORNING\n\nJ. Cole feat. Drake\n\nDrake is very well known for crooning about love and heartache, but in his collaboration with J. Cole, he turns down the saccharine love pleas for a gruff-voiced verse that’s just plain sexy. It makes sense Drake was so intently focused—as the story goes, Cole had already recorded the song during his early mixtape days, Drake ended up hearing it through mutual collaborators and asked to get on it, and lo, we have one of the sexiest rap songs of any decade. —Jacinta Howard\n\n20. 4:44\n\nJay-Z\n\nThere’s no doubt that throughout the entirety of 4:44 Jay-Z is at his most vulnerable, so of course, the title track is no exception. Jay’s honesty is both inspring and coaxing, especially when offers lines like: “Look, I apologize, often womanize/Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes/Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles/Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you…” —Jacinta Howard\n\n19. ONE MORE CHANCE (Remix)\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n\nBiggie's loverman odes are almost easy to take for granted, and \"Big Poppa\" may be more of the late Brooklyn legend's theme song, but it's this classic remix and it's DeBarge-derived melody that cemented Christopher Wallace as Hip-Hop's most unlikely ladies' man. The lyrics make it clear that Biggie's wit and charm were his best qualities when it came to his more R&B-flavored tracks, and the cameo-drenched video remains one of his absolute best. —Stereo Williams\n\n18. RENEE\n\nThe Lost Boyz\n\nThe Lost Boyz have no shortage of hits, and Mr. Cheeks relays a dark tale of lost love in the most tragic sense on this classic single from the Queens crew. Over haunting production, Cheeks recalls how he met his boo Renee, and how much she got him to open up and explore the possibility of true love; only for things to take a horrific turn. One of the 90s' best, and evidence that Cheeks has always been a storyteller of the highest order. —Stereo Williams\n\n14. AROUND THE WAY GIRL\n\nLL COOL J\n\nWith Mama Said Knock You Out, LL COOL J opened the 1990s with a bang, and one of the album's highlights was this hit single about the neighborhood jewels. It’s a song that endures because it speaks to every generation of women from the block. LL’s ode to the girls from around the way features the lush production of Marley Marl (an ingenious flip of the Mary Jane Girls); with the laid-back vibes carrying Mr. Smith's smoothed-out lyrics describing his ideal cutie who grew up on your street. A perfect love song for Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee. —Stereo Williams\n\n13. THE PROTOTYPE\n\nOutKast\n\nBy the time OutKast released Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Andre 3000 and Big Boi had nothing to prove, but they both still had a lot to express and explore musically. 3000 does so throughout The Love Below with its expansive, experimental sound. “The Prototype” isn't just a clear gem on his side of the album. It’s the kind of song that happens when an artist is free to dig deep and discover exactly what they’re capable of. Lyrically poetic yet grounded, sonically earthy yet exploratory; on “The Prototype,” Andre does more than “tiptoe to the sun” on this song—he further secures his legacy as one of the most gifted writers of our time. —Jacinta Howard\n\n12. ELECTRIC RELAXATION\n\nA Tribe Called Quest\n\nATCQ has one of Hip-Hop's most celebrated and influential discographies, but there's no denying that \"...Relaxation\" holds a special place amongst fans. The jazzy feel of the track is the perfect backdrop for Q-Tip and Phife Dawg to perfect their smoothest lines for the ladies: as Q-Tip promises \"if I was working at the club, you would not pay;\" and Phife boasts that, not only does he not discriminate when it comes to girlfriends, he'd be willing to elope if his mother doesn't approve of his woman. —Stereo Williams\n\n11. PASSIN' ME BY\n\nThe Pharcyde\n\nFatlip, Bootie Brown, SlimKidTre and Imani crafted a tune that awkward kids everywhere could relate to with this seminal single from 1992. The Pharcyde's ode to unrequited love sounds like every teenager whoever harbored a crush for someone who was \"out of their league,\" as the quartet from Los Angeles rap about their bad experiences trying to find love in all the wrong places. Timeless Hip-Hop. —Stereo Williams\n\n7. POETIC JUSTICE\n\nKendrick Lamar feat. Drake\n\nIn Kendrick Lamar’s video for “Poetic Justice,” it opens with the disclaimer, ““All characters in this visual are entirely fictional. The events that occur are purely symbolic and should not be taken literal.” What transpires is a tragedy befitting a Shakespeare stage play, illustrating that love and loss are often the same side of the coin. —Alec Banks\n\n6. MAHOGANY\n\nEric B. & Rakim\n\nEric B. & Rakim's third album Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em contained a little something for everyone one. In addition to a DJ cut - \"Eric B. Made My Day\", social commentary on \"In The Ghetto\" and lyrical excellence on \"Untouchables\" Ra hit us with his first \"love rap\". Over an Al Green drum loop Ra describes his escapades with \"Mahogany\" which remains one of his most revered pieces. —JayQuan\n\n5. ALWAYS ON TIME\n\nJa Rule feat. Ashanti\n\nJa Rule and Ashanti dominated the radio in the early 2000s for a reason – they made super catchy music. “Always On Time” is one of the most notable of their long list of collabs, with its easygoing premise and singable lyrics. —Jacinta Howard\n\n4. BONITA APPLEBUM\n\nA Tribe Called Quest\n\nThere are few songs in any genre as enduring and beloved as this quirky love song from A Tribe Called Quest. Frontman Q-Tip is the lone rhymer, as he woos a potential lover with the breeziest of come-ons (\"Glad to meet ya...\") while also somehow making it clear where his head is at (\"If ya need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics!\") Like LL COOL J's \"Around The Way Girl,\" it's a song that pulls off the neat trick of appealing to so many because of its relatability. Q-Tip's charm and that classic Daylight sample make it one of the best rap tracks ever. Bonita, Bonita, Bonita... —Stereo Williams\n\n3. I NEED LOVE\n\nLL COOL J\n\nLL COOL J wasn't the first MC to create a rap ballad, but he was the first to make one commercially successful. Before \"I Need Love\" LL released \"I Want You\" and \"I Can Give You More\" which were more drum heavy in the tradition of Rick Rubin production. \"I Need Love\" was heavy on melody and dominated the radio as the second single from Bigger And Deffer, COOL J's sophomore album. \"I Need Love\" reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart and 14 on the Hot 100. —JayQuan"
