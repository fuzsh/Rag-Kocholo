Platforms like TikTok make success possible for different kinds of creative artists, musical or not.\n\nWant more informative content that won’t make you fall asleep?

These will, of course, change over time. These currently are:\n\n“If We Ever Broke Up” by Mae Stephens\n\n“Makeba” by Jain\n\n“What It Is – Solo Version” by Doechii\n\n“Cupid – Twin Ver. – Sped Up Version” by FIFTY FIFTY\n\n“Super Shy” by NewJeans\n\nDoes TikTok make songs popular?\n\nTechnically, success on TikTok won’t help make music popular again - Billboard doesn’t track TikTok or include it in its calculations. Billboard does consider streaming, but it takes a lot of listens to equate to an album sale. The problem with music on TikTok is that fame can be fickle – today’s trend quickly becomes yesterday’s has-been. Yet, the songs we’ve covered here have become popular again on TikTok – at least for a short time within the TikTok platform.\n\nHow do I get 1-minute songs on TikTok?\n\nMost songs on TikTok are 15 seconds, despite being able to upload videos of 60 seconds on the platform. This is because TikTok has a special license with music providers that only permits them to play a 15-second clip. However, you can get around this if you upload MP3 files from your phone to act as soundtracks to your 60-second videos. Be aware that TikTok sometimes cracks down on the use of non-copyright music in videos and may remove your track.\n\nHow do you find trending songs on TikTok?\n\nIt is surprisingly tricky to find trending songs on TikTok. One way is to go into your Discover section, click on a few videos, and note the music used in these videos. Another method is to click + on your home screen and then tap Sounds. This will bring up a series of song suggestions, including a category for TikTok Viral. Alternatively, you could click on one of the other playlists that TikTok recommends.\n\nHow do you put songs on TikTok?\n\nAlthough most people use the songs already in TikTok’s library, nothing stops you from adding songs yourself. Begin by recording your video and saving it. Ensure you have uploaded the music you want as an MP3. Tap the + button in TikTok. Select Upload and select the video you previously recorded. Tap Mute to silence the original video. Tap Back. Then select the audio option you want and choose your intended soundtrack. Tap the 3-dot menu, then +. Adjust the resulting audio wave appropriately.\n\nHow do songs go viral on TikTok?\n\nAs we have seen in this article, various songs have become incredibly popular as video backdrops on TikTok. And this often happens without any action by or even knowledge of the artist who released the song. Of course, if you actively want your songs to go viral on TikTok, you can help the process. Share short videos yourself, featuring your tracks. Create content that appeals to Generation Z. Use suitable hashtags. Use Spotlight if you’re in an eligible country."
