        "text": "The 1990s was undoubtedly an influential decade. Not only did it provide the world with incredible additions like computers, phones, and unique fashion trends, but it was also a thriving time for pop culture — specifically in the hip-hop and R&B landscape. From the distinctive flow of The Notorious B.I.G to the powerful sounds of Whitney Houston, here are 40 of the best songs released by Black artists in the '90s.\n\n1 of 40\n\n“Say My Name\"\n\nYouTube\n\nDestiny’s Child released a handful of popular singles as a group; however, \"Say My Name\" is undoubtedly one of their most popular songs. The single earned DC their second No. 1 hit, two Grammy Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award.\n\n2 of 40\n\n“The Boy Is Mine”\n\nYouTube\n\nThe lead single, “The Boy Is Mine,” from Brandy’s second studio album, Never Say Never, is nothing short of a smash hit. It was released in 1998 and climbed the chart before claiming the No. 1 spot for 13 weeks. The song garnered praise from fans and critics and scored Brandy and Monica their first Grammy win in 1999.\n\n3 of 40\n\n“No Scrubs”\n\nYouTube\n\nLove it or hate it, TLC’s \"No Scrubs\" is a certified bop. The beat, lyrics, production — everything about it flows together perfectly, so it makes sense why this song is one of the group’s most popular.\n\n4 of 40\n\n\"Emotions\"\n\nYouTube\n\n\"Emotions \" is the lead single from Mariah Carey’s second studio album of the same name. The track, released in 1991, features a funky melody and beat that showcases Mariah’s expansive vocal range.\n\nLike most of Carey’s music, Emotions reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 — her fifth in a row — and became a commercial success, selling over one million records in the US.\n\n5 of 40\n\n“Fantasy”\n\nYouTube\n\nThere’s really no other way to categorize Mariah as anything other than a musical genius. \"Fantasy,\" the lead single from her fifth studio album, is something special. After its release, the song quickly became a global success, earning Carey her ninth No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\n6 of 40\n\n“No Diggity”\n\nYouTube\n\nRanked by several publications as one of the greatest songs of the ‘90s, Blackstreet was on another level with their late ‘90s record, \"No Diggity.\" The song’s popularity is undeniable, as it’s been shuffled through club playlists since topping the chart in ‘96.\n\n7 of 40\n\n“Doo Wop”\n\nYouTube\n\nNo such list can exist without the iconic Lauryn Hill’s 1998 masterpiece, \"Doo Wop.\" The R&B single has been praised worldwide for its impactful lyrics and theme. Of course, the song reached the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100, which made Hill the first female rapper in the chart’s history to achieve this. The song’s acclaim worked in Lauryn’s favor, as she won several Grammys, Billboard Music Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n8 of 40\n\n“You Make Me Wanna”\n\nYouTube\n\nUsher’s second studio album, My Way, houses his megahit single, \"You Make Me Wanna.\" The 1997 soul track showcases the singer’s smooth vocal abilities and helped boost the then-18-year-old into superstardom.\n\n9 of 40\n\n“Understanding”\n\nYouTube\n\nThis 1993 hit was released as the second single from Xscape’s first studio album, Hummin’ Comin’ at ‘Cha. It’s a soulful track sung from the perspective of a pleading partner frustrated with the lack of understanding in their relationship. Since its release, \"Understanding\" has been a staple hit in the group’s lineup, with recent live performances at the Essence Fest, BET Awards, and their 2021 Versuz battle against the legendary group SWV.\n\n10 of 40\n\n“U Can’t Touch This”\n\nYouTube\n\nEveryone knows about MC Hammer’s \"U Can’t Touch This.\" It’s a song that will carry on through the ages because of its spit-fire rhymes, classic beat, and fun vibe. Released in 1990, \"U Can’t Touch This\" was a grand slam holding No. 1 positions in Australia, Canada, and Europe. It reached No. 8 on the Hot 100, won two Grammys, and two Video Music Awards for Best Rap and Dance Video.\n\n11 of 40\n\n“Free Your Mind”\n\nYouTube\n\nEn Vogue changed the game with their anti-prejudice and empowering 1992 song, \"Free Your Mind.\" Not only do the lyrics encourage you to live your best life, but the song’s rock elements and edgy vocals take this track to the next level.
