        "text": "I originally meant to ask Patchisou Yutohru if I could put this thread up. It deals with the school paper I'm writing up right now. Then I realized I was running short of time. So I gambled and hopefully gambled right. Patchisou, if you must, lock this thread. I just really need a survey.\n\nAnyway, we all have that genre of music we love, from jazz to rock, classical to pop. I don't know how many of us actually stop and ask ourselves this, but why exactly DO we like the music we listen to? And, in addition, what do we see in music that doesn't appeal to us? So I'm asking the people of PC these questions:\n\n1)What is your favorite genre of music, and what exactly do you like that type of music?\n\n2)What music do you not like, and why do you not like it?\n\nNOTE: I know some people say they like more then one genre of music, but please, for this, can you really think about which you like most, and then put that one? I'm hopefully gonna use the poll in my paper\n\nI also meant to ask why you love/hate Beiber, but there's sorta a thread on that already/\n\nWell, of all things, Celtic; folk. I like how it harkens back to an older time; peaceful, melancholic, yet subtly lively, apparently a match to my personality? It's not hard on the ears... um... that's really all I have to say, sorry. Will edit if more comes to mind.\n\nNow what I don't like would be current pop music, it's awfully repetitive and almost always about some sort of 'you x me' theme... 'love' if you will, but fickle, pointless songs seemingly made to forward monetary success for as long as the majority enjoy the theme, and given how egocentric the themes sound to me (always gratifying to hear your favourite celebrity saying \"I love you\", eh?) I should imagine people will continue to well past my own lifetime. I don't necessarily hate any listeners of it, only the music itself and its creator.\n\nI like some of the genres you mention in your poll, but if pressed I couldn't say any of them are my favorite. Electronic music is probably the closest single genre that covers the music I like most, or at least I'm more inclined to like any random electronic music I hear for the first time than random music from another genre.\n\nFrom your list I suppose I would be stuck picking pop since it's the closest, but that would be misleading since they're really no more similar than pop and hip hop or pop and country. I do like a lot of rock music, but it's a large genre and as a whole I only like a small percentage of it so I can't pick that. :/\n\nAnyway, I like it because it's varied in the sounds it makes. You can have repetitive, dance-y music or something more akin to classical music or jazz with movements and improvisation and, for lack of a more descriptive word, variety. You can go with lyrics just as easily as without. It's a broad genre and there really aren't many conventions that artists have to stick to.\n\nMost of the bands I enjoy are different forms of rock, the main favourites being: post-punk, post-rock, progressive rock, and \"alternative\" or \"indie\" rock. Also a lot of electronic music, such as trip-hop, electro-industrial and IDM. Although I enjoy music based on the actual sound and lyrical content rather than just having all my favourite bands categorised into one genre, so my favourite bands all actually belong to very different genres.\n\nAs for music I don't like, there's no particular genre that I dislike as I'll usually be able to find at least one artist I enjoy for every genre. Although most of what is in the top 40 (now I've checked the charts, I actually dislike everything in the top 40 apart from Muse) is something I don't enjoy. So I guess most of what's mainstream.\n\nI don't really have a favourite sound of music, but I can tell you that I like music that stirs my imagination. The majority of songs I have on my Ipod come from Soundtracks of the various movies/anime that I have seen and the game's (LoZ-Fire Emblem) I've played.\n\nSometimes, when I have artblock, the music helps me get ideas. And even if I don't have one, it makes it easier to drift off in my own little big universe.\n\nBut since you ask to vote for a specific genre, and Soundtracks aren't limited to just one, I'm gonna vote for Pop anyways... Because, call me a weeaboo if you want, the majority of Vocal Songs on my Ipod are JPop songs, i.e. Anime openings and endings. I pick those carefully though. Lyrics are important to me, but I need to like the sound as well...\n\nIf I really like one song, I'd search for the other songs by the artist. That is how I got to know Suara, who at this point is my favourite artist. I don't like all of her work, but I do like most of it. x)\n\nSongs I don't like... Well, I detest Rap, HipHop... the usual things on the radio.\n\nI want decent text and sound, and I kinda miss that in most songs I hear nowadays. : <"
