        "text": "DJ please, pick up your phone\n\nI’m on the request line\n\nThis is a Missy Elliott one time exclusive\n\nOkay, so the takeaway from this first part is that Missy Elliott is calling in to let the DJ know that she’s going to try to get this all in one take and if the DJ misses it, they won’t have it.\n\nCome on\n\nIs it worth it? Let me work it\n\nI put my thang down, flip it and reverse it\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nIs anything worth it? This is a very existential question that all of us should be asking ourselves every once in a while. Also, she is asking that you let her work it because she put something down and flipped and reversed it, which sounds quite impressive. Then she seems to transition herself either into a different language or some enchantment in that last part, for some reason. Hmm!! Interesting start.\n\nIf you got a big, let me search ya\n\nTo find out how hard I gotta work ya\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nCome on\n\nOkay, so it looks like she’s looking for something big and wondering if the other person has what she’s looking for. And again with this enchantment. Maybe, it’s going to have something to do with things later in the song. I’ll wait to find out…\n\nI’d like to get to know ya, so I could show you\n\nPut the pussy on ya, like I told ya\n\nGimme all your numbers so I can phone ya\n\nYour girl acting stank then call me over\n\nIn this part, she’s met a new friend, it looks like. She has a cat that she’s brought over and she’s put that cat on them. I guess she’s working in reverse, though, as she’s asking for the phone number after she’s already interacted with this person. Also, apparently, she’s looking to help this person out with their girl and she’s going to come over for that.\n\nNot on the bed, lay me on your sofa\n\nCall before you come, I need to shave my chocha\n\nYou do or you don’t or you will or you won’t ya\n\nGo downtown and eat it like a vulture\n\nWhoa, okay!! I guess that I was wrong about her intentions with her new friend. Apparently, she wants to hang out on their sofa for some reason. I’m also guessing that “Chocha” isn't the name of her cat, although that would be a pretty clever name given that that’s the word for a pussy in Spanish. Now it sounds like she’s tempting her friend with some sort of wordplay and game of some sort. Oh, my, going downtown, eating it like a vulture, this isn’t PG rated anymore, is it?\n\nSee my hips and my tips, don’t ya?\n\nSee my ass and my lips, don’t ya?\n\nLost a few pounds in my waist for ya\n\nThis the kinda beat that go ra-ta-ta\n\nRa-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta\n\nSex me so good I say, blah-blah-blah\n\nWork it! I need a glass of water\n\nBoy, oh boy, it’s good to know ya\n\nOh, yeah, this probably wasn’t about a cat, to begin with. Her hips, ass, and waist? it sounds like she’s trying to get some. Yep, the machine gun/vibrator sounds she’s making, and then the word sex appears.\n\nOh, yeah, she’s made it clear at this point what she wants to do in this situation. And now we find out the person in the story is a boy. I don’t know how to feel about that, exactly. Hopefully, she’s talking about legal, consensual sex here.\n\nI also love her plug for hydration in here too. It’s a very important concept to spread. You can face serious consequences if you don’t drink water.\n\nIs it worth it? Let me work it\n\nI put my thing down, flip it and reverse it\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nIf you got a big, let me search ya\n\nTo find out how hard I gotta work ya\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nCome on\n\nOkay, now this part makes a little bit more sense on repeat after what we had discovered in the last stanza of this work of art. I still don’t get the enchantment though. Maybe she needs it to get this boy to cheat on his girl with her because he wouldn’t do it otherwise? Who knows? I guess that part is open to interpretation at this point.\n\nIf you’re a fly gal, get your nails done\n\nGet a pedicure, get your hair did\n\nBoy lift it up, let’s make a toast, ah\n\nLet’s get drunk, it’s gon’ bring us closer\n\nDon’t I look like a Halle Berry poster?\n\nSee the Belvedere playin’ tricks on ya\n\nI think I remember from the 90s-2000s lingo that “fly” means nice looking or cool so she’s describing what a girl should do to look nice and cool here. She wants you to get a pedicure, get your “hair did”, and just so she can get drunk with this boy and get closer to him.\n\nMaybe that’s what that enchantment was for after all. And I’ve seen Halle Berry and Missy Elliott next to each other. I’m not fully convinced that they’re the same person. I have watched Swordfish after all and if those breasts are hiding behind Missy Elliott’s clearly bigger ones, then I’d be shocked.\n\nGirlfriend wanna be like me never\n\nYou won’t find a bitch that’s even better\n\nI make it hot as Las Vegas weather\n\nListen up close while I take you backwards\n\nSdrawkcab ti ekat ot ekil yssiM yaw eht hctaw\n\nIt actually sounds like she’s using sarcasm or irony here saying that the boy’s girlfriend doesn’t want to be like her never because it sounds like she has an inflated sense of self. She even thinks that she can control the weather in Las Vegas, interesting. Then, she goes back to more ominous enchantments. Maybe, that’s part of the way she can control the weather, as well.\n\nI’m not a prostitute but I can give you what you want\n\nI love your braids and your mouth full of fonts\n\nLove the way my ass go ba-bump, ba-bump-bump\n\nKeep your eyes on my ba-bump, ba-bump-bump\n\nYou think you can handle this badonka-donk-donk\n\nTake my thong off and my ass go boom\n\nCut the lights off so you see what I can do (Come on)\n\nI mean, I’d take her word on this. But I have recently written a story about a girl who pretended to be interested and had sex with me but I only found out after the fact that she actually WAS a prostitute, so I’d take that statement with a grain of salt. She loves his braids, that’s cool. And his mouth full of fonts.\n\nDo her enchantments actually make Arial and Times New Roman appear in someone’s mouth when they talk? I’d like to explore that phenomenon more in a later piece. Then she challenges him to handle her honky tonk badonkadonk. Trace Adkins had found his inspiration from this song, I’m sure. She’s doing some X-rated stuff with him in this next part. That’s probably why she’s turning off the lights at this point. But I don’t think he’ll be able to see anything she does at that point, come on.\n\nIs it worth it? Let me work it\n\nI put my thing down, flip it and reverse it\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nIf you got a big, let me search ya\n\nTo find out how hard I gotta work ya\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i (Come on)\n\nI might have to stop writing this analysis soon. It seems that her enchantments have started getting to me a bit. I’m wanting to become a prostitute who can change the weather and attract people with significant others to me while I work it, flip it, and reverse it. I’m scared to even say these words out loud for fear that I’ll consume Mike with them too.\n\nBoys, boys, all type of boys\n\nBlack, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys\n\nWhy-thai, thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai\n\nRock-thai, thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai (C’mon)\n\nGirls, girls, get the cash\n\nIf it’s nine to five or shakin’ you ass\n\nI feel like this section should’ve been longer if she was describing boys, all types of boys. She only named four of them and not even the four best ones. Is she also trying to impersonate an Asian accent here? Huh, suspicious. Although, getting cash is never a bad thing. I think this confirms that she’s a prostitute though because she’s talking about it in the context of a job and shaking your ass for it.\n\nAin’t no shame ladies, do your thing\n\nJust make sure you ahead of the game\n\nJust ’cause I got a lot of fame super\n\nPrince couldn’t get me change my name papa\n\nKunta Kinte, a slave again, no sir\n\nPicture blacks sayin’, oh yes’a massa\n\nOkay, so she’s saying that there’s no shame in it even though she had previously said that that wasn’t her line of work. I know she’s a rapper but I’d respect her just the same if she was also a sex worker as a side gig. Sex work is real work too. She’s famous and cool, and she’s met Prince.\n\nWhy did Prince try to get her to change her name, though? That’s weird. Yeah, I’m not touching those last couple of lyrics there. I’m in no place to comment on the historical strife of the African American community as Missy Elliott is.\n\nPicture Lil’ Kim dating a pastor\n\nMinute Man, Big Red can outlast ya\n\nWho is the best? I don’t have to ask you\n\nWhen I come out, you won’t even matter\n\nWhy you act dumb like ugh, duh\n\nSo you act dumb like ugh, duh\n\nAnd the drummer boy go pa-rum, pa-pom-pom\n\nGive you some-some-some of this Cinnabon (Come on)\n\nLil’ Kim dating a pastor would probably be the opposite imagery of what I’d have when picturing her partner. I don’t know the Minute Man and Big Red people, but I’ll take Missy’s word on this. Missy’s song is supposed to be better than all of these people though.\n\nI guess that makes sense. We’re still talking about it around 20 years later. It’s not politically correct to make fun of dumb people so she shouldn’t be doing that. Now she’s throwing in a random Christmas song reference and something about the delicious and sweet food from Cinnabon. Nice.\n\nIs it worth it? Let me work it\n\nI put my thing down, flip it and reverse it\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nIf you got a big, let me search ya\n\nTo find out how hard I gotta work ya\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i\n\nTi esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i (Come on)\n\nTo my fellas (Ooh, good god)\n\nI like the way you work that\n\nTo my ladies (Woo)\n\nYou sure know how to work that (Good god)\n\nSo now that I think about it as the song lyrics conclude, she’s bragging in some parts of this song about her talent and the way she can put her thang down, which when I looked it up on Urban Dictionary, wasn’t what I was expecting.\n\nThe enchantment wasn’t meant for the guy, apparently, it was meant for us to be tricked into thinking that this was a good, coherent song as I had originally thought going into this analysis. She wants to work a guy’s big “yeah, you know what she’s talking about now.”\n\nShe ends the song by getting us all enchanted in her ritual of sex with partnered men and the usual name-dropping that most rappers are known for these days. She definitely inspired millions of people, women, and rappers with her innovative style and enchantments of nonsense to get people to buy her music.\n\nFor that reason, I think that this song stands the test of time because sex sells and Missy tells and shows us she’s the best female rapper from that era. Also, a little magic never hurt to get what you want.\n\nWhen I look at this song as a whole, I can see how one can get confused by the lyrics at times, but at the end of the day, she just wants us to know that if you believe in yourself enough, you can sleep with who you want, flip and reverse your thang and drop it like it’s hot.\n\nThis has been the Sturg with a thoughtful and in-depth analysis of the Missy Elliott song “Work It” in the publication “Drop a Line.” Thank you."
