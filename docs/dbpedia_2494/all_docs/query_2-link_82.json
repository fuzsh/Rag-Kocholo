        "text": "Aviana And The Pure Root was thrilled to release her latest single, “Through His Eyes,” in July which is now available for streaming on all platforms. This new track, which she’s proclaiming is the “song of the summer,” offers a tantalizing glimpse into her upcoming EP, Love Spells, slated for release this September.\n\nListen to the song HERE.\n\nProduced by St. Louis-based Engineer WhoIsTimothy, written and co-produced by Aviana herself, “Through His Eyes” marks a notable departure from Aviana’s traditional soulful rock sound. The upbeat and sexy track blends Contemporary R&B, reggae, Afrobeats, Afro-pop, and Afro-fusion into a vibrant musical tapestry. “Through His Eyes” showcases Aviana And The Pure Root’s signature blend of soulful melodies and introspective lyrics, encapsulating the essence of her unique ability to foster emotional healing within her listeners. It’s a record that will make you want to dance and fall in love all summer.\n\n“Through His Eyes” is about the joys of romantic union and how spiritual it indeed is. It’s about this long-awaited love finally being here and the notion that the eyes are the gateway to the soul,” Aviana explains. “I’ve truly had that experience where I’ve felt like I’ve seen God, the beginning of time, the oldest of souls, through a particular person’s eyes. It’s almost like I could see into an ancient past- it’s both captivating and heartbreaking at the same time.”\n\nThe track serves as a precursor to the Love Spells EP, a conceptual project that explores the journey of meeting various soul mates throughout one’s life. This EP will be accompanied by a music video for each song, forming a short film when watched together. “Through His Eyes” is the inaugural video in this cinematic endeavor, setting the stage for a deep exploration of relationships and personal growth. The long-awaited project intends to take the audience on a journey of the frequent soul mates that one encounters throughout one’s life, yet learning to decipher between a past life cycle that is meant to end versus your true-life partner that is manifested when one surrenders to their true purpose in life. With “Through His Eyes,” this enticing journey begins.\n\nAbout Aviana And The Pure Root: Aviana And The Pure Root is a singer-songwriter, producer, guitar player, and actress known for her innovative rock/soul sound that continuously delivers rich and transformative music in the realm of love and spirituality. She describes herself as a natural and ‘roots’ healing advocate who is joining the quest to create healing, balance, and spiritual rejuvenation on the planet. Her music explores themes of Ancient African mysticism and history, nature, the cosmos, Afrofuturism, and the soul-gripping experience of romantic love. Her innocence is one of a fairy, yet her commanding presence wins her the title of the ultimate seductress. Though she was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, she spent many years of her young adult life on the East Coast from Washington D.C. to New York. She is currently based in Los Angeles, California. In 2020, she released her first EP, PROPHECY, comprised of five tracks, produced by herself and St. Louis-based Engineer WhoIsTimothy. Later that year, she released the self-directed and self-produced music video for her most popular song to date- “Good Morning, Come Noon,” shot by L.A.-based Merlin Akman. In 2022, she and WhoIsTimothy teamed up again and produced the single “On & On,” which will ultimately appear on the EP Love Spells, to be released later in the fall of 2024. She is also the owner and operator of the health and wellness platform Live While Living by Aviana LLC, which sells organic loose-leaf herbal tea. She is a 2008 Howard University Alum and received her Master’s in Visual Culture: Costume Studies from New York University in 2014. She briefly studied music, voice, and acting at Santa Monica College from 2020-2021. Her forthcoming EP, Love Spells, promises to continue her tradition of blending diverse musical influences with heartfelt storytelling.\n\nCONNECT WITH AVIANA AND THE PURE ROOT\n\nINSTAGRAM | FACEBOOK | WEBSITE"
