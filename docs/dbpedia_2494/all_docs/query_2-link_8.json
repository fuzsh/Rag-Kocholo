        "text": "Before we even start talking about rap love songs, let me inform you all that I’m a woman. I’m a woman and I love rap. A lot. My entire aptly-titled “Bump & Grind” playlist consists of hyper-sexualized tunes with lyrics so vulgar that they would even cause Lil Wayne to blush. But setting vulgarity aside, being a female fan of hip-hop is hard at times due to the sole fact that it’s a genre notorious for its frequent and over-the-top misogyny. I can’t even count how many times I’ve read pieces highlighting how un-feminist the genre is, or how reductive it is for respectable, self-loving women to actively enjoy music with such disregard for our own gender.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that all rap tracks are trash or built on messages that are morally questionable. Calling the genre beautiful and crafted with the intention to offend no one would be a blatant lie, but it definitely does not mean that there’s a lack of rap songs about love, romance, and softer sentiments. In fact, a slew of the best booty jams out there disguise their true intentions: they’re actually full of rappers pouring their hearts out in hip hop love songs for the ages.\n\nThis isn’t going to be the same traditional list of ’90s/early ‘00s gangstuh luv tracks you might be expecting (take a seat “What’s Love” and “21 Questions”). You’re about to be hit with rap lyrics about love and serious emotion disguised with mumbling, swearing, and a heavy dose of “oh shit Mom’s coming turn it down” vibes.\n\nThese are our picks for 15 hip hop and rap love songs that are lowkey romantic.\n\nA.CHAL – \"000000\"\n\nStraight outta Peru, A.CHAL is bound to win your heart through your headphones (or AirPods if you're one of those people now). You just can't resist an artist with a voice sweeter than syrup, and this guy's got it. And I dare you not to tap your toes and/or practice a little belly dancing to that melody.\n\nNotable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nI could never be mad at you Pussy remedy like a Tylenol Remember being broke, I was eyein' you Now I have you\n\nStormzy - \"Own It\" ft. Ed Sheeran & Burna Boy\n\nI am not an avid fan of Ed Sheeran but, as one YouTube commenter eloquently put it, \"Stormzy and Ed go together like chocolate orange.\" This rap love song is a darn vibe, don't @ me because there's no way you can argue otherwise. Stormzy on his own has sufficient panty-dropping power, but the vocals that Sheeran lends take it to the next level. And let us not forget Burna Boy, who turns this into a triple threat of audial goodness.\n\nNotable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nGirl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door Never had a bruddah give you everything and more So I take a little piece and the rest of it is yours Mi amor\n\nThug loving when I put you in your place I can tell you love it just by looking in your face\n\nTy Dolla $ign & Jeremih - \"FYT\" ft. French Montana\n\nThere's a very, very good reason this track off Ty and Jeremih's collaborative album is aptly titled \"Baby Making Music.\" The beat, the vocals, the combination of artistic styles on one track; it's a sweeter than syrup NSFW ode to modern chivalry that gets straight to the point.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nHe don't give you anything, diamond rings I could bring, tuh And I put you on the team, that should mean that I'm fucking you tonight (bring a friend then another one)\n\nMake decisions, I wanna play with your permission Gimme that kitty, girl, wash the dishes Now spread them legs, call it long division That pussy taste like woah, woah\n\nJ Hus - \"Sweet Cheeks\"\n\nIf you haven't yet heard of J Hus, chances are you probably live on the opposite side of the Atlantic from the London MC. The man \"so ugly that he's sexy\" is one of the UK's most invigorating artists right now and is doing his own unique Brit ting with every track he drops. His debut album Common Sense is pure gold (and a fave here at HS Music), and \"Sweet Cheeks\" is a highlight. It's also a great way to hear some distinctly British rap songs about love complete with a crash course in UK slang (bunda = booty, FYI).\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nI'm her main squeeze, that's my sweet cheeks Bunda so big it can't fit in the selfie She loud and boujee, won't shut her mouth until I fuck up the coochie Most of pretty gyaldem are mouthy All up in my business she's nosy\n\nKendrick Lamar - \"LOVE\" ft. Zacari\n\nOk, hear me out on this one. Kung Fu Kenny might probably be the most loyal (no pun intended) rapper on this list. Married to his high school sweetheart Whitney Alford, he is not one to infuse his lyrics with many of the misogynistic lyrics or booty jam beats of others I’ve listed so far. But if any rapper can speak about love, who better than Kendrick ? And what better song than “LOVE” , with its catchy chorus and simple but effective lyrics asking the woman of his life to love him no matter what.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nIf I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)? If I made up my mind at work, would you still (love me)? Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me) Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothin' (oh, oh)\n\nMANILA GREY - \"Lava Walk\"\n\nYet another option from an international artist - thank me later for broadening your horizons – MANILA GREY are from Vancouver but have Filipino roots, and their vibe is one that anyone, anywhere can appreciate. If you love rap songs but need to spice up your regular rotation of rappers, this duo will definitely do it for you.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nYou know I love it rare you flawless Gleaming like diamonds, stare wild'n Burn through drama in your dress like lava God bless every curve, I love all your angles\n\nTyler, The Creator - \"See You Again\" ft. Kali Uchis\n\nIt’s the breakthrough song that introduced all of us to the softer side of Tyler, the Creator. After years spent bragging about his radical collective Odd Future with misogynistic and violent lyrics, with the album Flower Boy it felt as if Tyler was finally able to let his youthful anger off and show his true loverboy colors to the world, and the song that exemplifies this best is “See you again”. While we should thank destiny for Zayn Malik flaking twice on his studio session and getting to have Kali Uchis’ buttery smooth vocals to the now-iconic chorus, I can’t help but feel for Tyler as his love is only in his dreams and fantasies. But hey, it made for one of the best rap love songs out there. Don’t wake up Tayler!\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nYou live in my dream state Relocate my fantasy I stay in reality You live in my dream state Any time I count sheep That's the only time we make up, make up You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids Now, I don't wanna wake up\n\nDave – \"Location\" Burna Boy\n\nI've already got Burna Boy on this list once but you know I had to do it to 'em again - the man adds pure value to any track he graces. Dave was my most played artist of 2019, and this particular track was replayed approximately 2,917,603 times. Sure, they're talking about adoring multiple females simultaneously but I never said this list was an homage to monogamy.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nIf you send me the location Then I'll be right there Let me come, come check you, my baby Send me the location This year 'bout vacations, flight catching, train taking Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti I'm captain, I lead the army Bad ratio, I leave the party Your ex wavy, we tsunami\n\nTravis Scott - \"COFFEE BEAN\"\n\nTravis is usually all about the autotune (IT’S LIT, anyone?) but when he’s not busy falling into Drake’s stages, he’s out there being an undercover romantic. He hid this gem of a track right at the end of Astroworld, but it’s not to be missed - it’s a beautiful but brutally raw insight into his relationship with less-famous-than-egg Kylie. It’s also a huge switch-up from the Travis we know—no autotune and no extras. Just a slow beat and honest bars worthy of entrance into the pantheon of rap love songs.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nHow would you feel if I had you? Trust me, you’d be mad too But shawty, we can be mad cool Just hit me if anything past due\n\nCommon - \"The Light\"\n\nQuick trip down memory lane here. But if we are talking about hip-hop love songs, and the best of them, we need to go back to the year 2000. A young rapper by the name of Common found himself deeply in love with his fellow Soulquarian, Erykah Badu. This profound feeling became the inspiration for what would later become the iconic track, \"The Light.\"\n\nCrafted under the production genius of the late J Dilla, \"The Light\" beautifully samples Bobby Caldwell's 1980 song, \"Open Your Eyes,\" ingeniously manipulating Caldwell's vocals to create an entrancing and somewhat surreal sonic landscape. Through the verses of this song, Common's heartfelt emotions and profound affection for Badu are articulated, almost as if he's composing a heartfelt love letter to her.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nIt's important, we communicate\n\nAnd tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch\n\nI never call you my bitch or even my boo\n\nThere's so much in a name and so much more in you\n\nGunna - \"Banking On Me\"\n\nI still haven't decided what makes “Banking On Me” one of my absolute favourite rap love songs. Metro Boomin’s gentle beat and the smooth melodic lyrics are surely factors, but I can’t help but love the sensually graphic lyrics that makes the song irresistible. It also released as a surprise single for Valentine’s Day. Peak Gunna!\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nSun come out when I move the drapes (Drapes) Know my mood when I grab your waist (Waist) Know you fuckin' a man that's made (Made man, hey) Keep it lowkey, she ain't after fame No she ain't after fame (Amen) You ain't like that old ho' I usеd to be fuckin' You and her nothin' the samе (Nothin' the same) Don't care 'bout no cuffin', you wanna keep bussin\n\nTy Dolla $ign – \"Or Nah\" ft. The Weeknd & Wiz Khalifa\n\nAdmittedly, this one is a little iffy on the romance front considering it's a pure sex track, but sometimes pure sex is the most romantic thing somebody can get. Inviting your partner to utilize your head like a motorcycle is pretty damn affectionate.\n\nNotable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nDo you like the way I flick my tongue or nah? You can ride my face until you dripping cum Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah? Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?\n\nAminé - \"Heebiejeebies\" feat. Kehlani\n\nThe clue for being a rap love song might not be in the title here. But don't be fooled. This track is groovy and the catchy duet with Kehlani makes it so much sweeter and real. Makes me believe Aminè truly found his shorty (can we all agree to please never use this word again? thanks), in the closing song the his debut album Good For You in the best loving way.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nI got the baddest bitch Shorty keep hollerin’ at me Told her I’m a young OG from the west And I’m repping up the 503 I ain’t no average bitch Baby come swing my way Imma put you on this game Get it all gas no breaks\n\nAJ Tracey - \"Butterflies\" ft. Not3s\n\nLet AJ Tracey and his musical genius transport you to a tropical island upon which chivalry is 100% not dead. It may be the dead of winter (in the Northern Hemisphere at least) but this track is bound to get it heated. The British artist has been on the come up for a minute now, and him teaming up with fellow Englishman Not3s is the blessing we didn't know we needed.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nShe don't spread it for them wasteman there Oh no, 'cause she knows that's mine Them other tings, man they don't compare She's the only one that gets my shine I wanna get you home and give your ting a thumping I carve the pussy up like I'm cutting pumpkin Pussy like the English channel every time I jump in (splash)\n\nDrake - \"Hold On, We’re Going Home\" ft. Majid Jordan\n\nI am sure I made you discover a couple of artists with this list, so you’ll forgive me for putting a classic mainstream one now in the list for the best romantic rap songs in the scene. But everything about “Hold On, We’re Going Home” feels like the quintessential Drake love song. Moving away from a typical rap delivery to a more R&B style, this track also shows the versatility of Drake in pulling off a style more in affinity with everything we love about 80s synth music. Some might say this song is its Top 3 song of all time.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nI got my eyes on you You're everything that I see I want your hot love and emotion endlessly I can't get over you You left your mark on me I want your hot love and emotion endlessly\n\nYoung Thug - \"Take Care\"\n\nI can't seem to come to a solid conclusion about how I feel about this Thugger fellow. While he often tries to show off his most manly persona with rough beats and even rougher lyrics (\"Old English\" anyone?), the man also has a far softer side that would fit seamlessly next to Usher and Ne-Yo in a \"Hip Hop Love Songs\" playlist. Despite rapping about sex more often than not, he revealed in an interview with his fiancée Jerrika Karlae that he doesn't actually \"care for sex that much.\" Quite hard to believe, but at least he’s devoted.\n\nNoteable Lovey Dovey Lyrics:\n\nYou got me stopping at the green light I'll set you good, I'm off a bean right And I know you want a savage to give you a ring right Sexin' on drugs, Leave a little money on the counter You remind me of Erykah Badu Thinkin' 'bout masturbating to your nudes"
