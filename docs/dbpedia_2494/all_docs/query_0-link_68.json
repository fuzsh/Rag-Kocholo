        "text": "B2K will bring their Millennium Tour to Glendale in a month that also features Valley concerts by Brad Paisley and the Lemonheads.\n\nThis weekend's shows include Dru Hill on a '90s Memorial Weekend Jam, the Lemonheads with Tommy Stinson, Interarma and Bad Company.\n\nNext week brings shows by Citizen, the Dead Milkmen, Paisley and Rooney.\n\nHere's a look at those and other concert highlights of the month in Phoenix.\n\n5/24: '90s Memorial Weekend Jam\n\nDru Hill topped the R&B charts three times in their '90s prime (\"In My Bed,\" \"Never Make a Promise\" and Redman-assisted \"How Deep Is Your Love\") while serving as a launching pad for Sisqo, the white-haired R&B sensation best remembered for giving the world \"Thong Song.\"\n\nThey're joined my Sunshine Anderson, J. Holiday and Carl Thomas.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 24. Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix. $25-$55. 602-267-1600, celebritytheatre.com.\n\n5/24: Bad Company\n\nIt’s been 45 years since Bad Company dropped their self-titled debut, a recording so loaded with hard-rocking classic-rock-radio staples, they managed to feature no fewer than six of the album’s eight songs in the course of their concert at Ak-Chin Pavilion on a co-headlining tour with Joe Walsh. And Paul Rodgers’ vocals have held up surprisingly well after 40-odd years in the business. He sounded amazing.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 24. The Pool at Talking Stick Resort, Loop 101 and Pima Road, Salt River Reservation. $35 and up. 480-850-7734, talkingstickresort.com.\n\n5/25: The Millennium Tour\n\nR&B sensations B2K (Omarion, Boog, Fizz and Raz-B) will bring the Millennium Tour to Gila River Arena on May 25 with special guests Mario, Pretty Ricky, Lloyd, Ying Yang Twins, Chingy and Bobby V.\n\nIn their original run, from 1998-2004, B2K had a string of hit singles, including the chart-topping \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" as well as “Girlfriend,” \"Gots ta Be\" and \"Uh Huh.\" They won back-to-back BET Viewer's Choice Awards and Soul Train Awards in their prime.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, May 25. Gila River Arena, 9400 W. Maryland Ave., Glendale. $49.50 and up. 623-772-3800, ticketmaster.com.\n\n5/25: Inter Arma\n\nThese extreme-metal veterans arrive in support of a punishing album titled “Sulphur English,” trudging through the sludge of classic doom with hints of prog and even heavy psychedelic folk. In reviewing the album, the 405 noted that they've \"always been a band that merited the use of adjectives like ‘transportative’ and ‘transcendent.’” But those adjectives don’t really get at what PopMatters once summed up so well with \"leaves your earthly remains flayed for the carrion to feast and frees your soul.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, May 25. Yucca Tap Room, 29 W. Southern Ave., Tempe. $15; $12 in advance. 480-967-4777, yuccatap.com.\n\n5/25: One More Time\n\nWith a set inspired by Daft Punk's \"Discovery\" album, this tribute band dons replica chrome LED helmets, wears retro costumes and performs hit singles from all the band's albums. Visuals are from Discovery's sci-fi opera \"Interstella 5555.\"\n\nDetails: 9 p.m. Saturday, May 25. The Van Buren, 401 W. Van Buren St., Phoenix. $15-$20. 18 and over. 480-659-1641, thevanburenphx.com.\n\n5/26: Lemonheads, Tommy Stinson\n\nEvan Dando's Lemonheads broke through in 1992 with \"It's a Shame About Ray,\" fueled largely by the title track, a wistful, acoustic-driven rocker that became a Top 5 modern-rock hit and landed a spot on Pitchfork's Top 200 Tracks of the '90s list. Stinson found fame on the fringes as the teenage derelict on bass for the Replacements. His latest solo work should speak directly to the part of you that fell in love with “Hootenanny” or whatever album proved to be your gateway drug back in the day.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Sunday, May 26. Marquee Theatre, 730 N. Mill Ave., Tempe. $30-$60. 480-829-0607, luckymanonline.com.\n\n5/28: Citizen\n\nThey arrive in support of \"Fear,\" the much-anticipated followup to “As You Please,\" which Kerrang! declared their “most atmospheric music to date.” They haven't abandoned the urgency or their earlier work. They're just taking a different approach.\n\nAs DIY Magazine wrote, “The emotion on ‘As You Please’ is as grand and raw as ever, but they have refined their delivery, and their latest album manages not to shortchange that underlying sentiment while expanding their sonic palette.”\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Tuesday, May 28. Nile Theater, 105 W. Main St., Mesa. $22. niletheater.com.\n\n5/29: Rooney\n\nActor Robert Schwartzman and his bandmates had built up a pretty good buzz going into the long-delayed release of their first album, having toured with Weezer and the Strokes while perfecting their sugar-coated brand of sun-kissed power-pop.\n\nAnd when the album finally arrived in mid-2013, it effortlessly lived up to the promise of that buzz with the pop sensibilities that only come from studying the music of the '60s in ways that go beyond the Beach Boys vibe they channel on the first track, \"Blueside.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, May 29. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $18-$85. 602-296-7013, therebellounge.com.\n\n5/30: Dead Milkmen\n\nThese Philly punks were born to conquer college radio, where their sardonic sense of humor helped them stand out from the crowd as eccentric originals, following through on the promise of \"Bitchin' Camaro\" with \"The Thing That Only Eats Hippies,\" \"Instant Club Hit (You'll Dance to Anything)\" and the career-defining \"Punk Rock Girl.\" That last one helped them land a major-label deal, which only ended in frustration and a 13-year hiatus. They've been back together since 2008, with two solid new albums to show for it.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, May 30. Marquee Theatre, 730 N. Mill Ave., Tempe. $25-$35. 480-829-0607, luckymanonline.com.\n\n5/31: Brad Paisley\n\nOne of country's most consistent hit machines, Paisley scored his first of 18 chart-topping country hits, \"He Didn't Have to Be,\" in 1999 and sent a record-breaking streak of 10 consecutive releases to the top from 2005 (\"When I Get Where I'm Going,\" a duet with Dolly Parton) to 2009 (\"Then\").\n\nHis biggest hits include four double-platinum singles — \"Whiskey Lullaby,\" \"She's Everything,\" \"Then\" and \"Remind Me,\" a duet with Carrie Underwood.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, May 31. Ak-Chin Pavilion, 2121 N. 83rd Ave., Phoenix. $38.50 and up. 602-254-7200, livenation.com.\n\n5/31: West Coast Legends Live\n\nOne of the first Bay Area rappers to sign to a major, the great E-40 tops a bill that also features Tha Dogg Pound, 2nd II None and Bad Azz. Hailed by Pigeons & Planes as a pioneer in offbeat flow, his hits include \"1-Luv,\" \"Rapper's Ball\" and the platinum Top 5 rap hit \"U and Dat.\" He's also featured on the five-times-platinum Big Sean hit \"I Don't (Expletive) With You,\" which topped the rap and R&B charts in 2014.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 31. Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix. $25-$45. 602-267-1600, celebritytheatre.com.\n\nPAST EVENTS\n\n5/2: Slayer\n\nThe thrash-metal legends are kicking off the fifth leg of their farewell tour in Phoenix with support by Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and Cannibal Corpse.\n\nThey took the metal world by force in 1983 with \"Show No Mercy,\" on which they prophetically set the tone with \"Evil Has No Boundaries.\" And by the time they got to \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Hell Awaits,\" the '80s triumphs that would go on to define their brutal legacy, they'd somehow found a way to take it up a notch.\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Thursday, May 2. Ak-Chin Pavilion, 2121 N. 83rd Ave., Phoenix. $29.50 and up. 602-254-7200, livenation.com.\n\n5/2: Gary Allan\n\nHe’s topped the country charts with four singles since hitting his stride in the early 2000s — “Man to Man,” “Tough Little Boys,” “Nothing On But the Radio” and the platinum “Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain),” which hit the top in 2013.\n\nHe hasn’t had much luck with hits since then, despite releasing songs with names that should sound right at home at country radio (“It Ain’t the Whiskey,” \"Hangover Tonight”).\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, May 2. Mesa Amphitheatre, 263 N. Center St. $43. 480-644-2560, mesaamp.com.\n\n5/2: Tech N9ne\n\nThis underground rapper has sold more than two million albums with precious little airplay, relying instead on the grassroots following he's nurtured on the road. And making brilliant records hasn't hurt.\n\nAs he told azcentral.com, \"Really good artistry always shines.\" His most successful songs to date are \"Fragile,\" a 2013 track featuring Kendrick Lamar and Mayday, and 2015's \"Hood Go Crazy\" with B.o.B and 2 Chainz.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, May 2. Marquee Theatre, 730 N. Mill Ave., Tempe. $40-$70. 480-829-0607, luckymanonline.com.\n\n5/2: Jake Shimabukuro\n\nIf that last time you heard a ukulele was your fourth-grader’s music class recital, then you’ve missed a revolution. Hawaiian virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro has gained global fame for his fiendishly difficult compositions. He even has a spot in the Musical Instrument Museum’s Artist Gallery, alongside the likes of Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana and Tito Puente.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, May 2. Mesa Arts Center, 1 E. Main St. $39. 480-644-6500, mesaartscenter.com.\n\n5/2: The Faint\n\nThese cyber-punk revivalists are touring in support of \"Egowerk,\" an album where analog synths that could give listeners of a certain age a flashback to the '80s underscore lyrics that weigh in on modern society, the internet and ego, especially the dark side of social media. As Pitchfork summed it up, \"More than two decades in, the Omaha electro-rock band finds new reasons to stay angry and keep dancing.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, May 2. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $25-$38. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n5/3: NCT 127\n\nNCT is a South Korean boy-band franchise formed by SM Entertainment. Their name is short for Neo Culture Technology, a term coined to describe the concept of having an unlimited number of members divided into multiple sub-units based in various cities.\n\nNCT 127 is the second unit, based in Seoul. The number represents the longitude coordinate of Seoul. How K-pop is that?\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 3. Comerica Theatre, 400 W. Washington St., Phoenix. $72.50 and up. 800-745-3000, livenation.com.\n\n5/3: Beach Fossils\n\nIt's been nearly a decade now since Dustin Payseur took the blogosphere by quiet storm with the sleepy vocals and chiming guitars of an unassuming self-titled debut. On \"Somersault,\" he fleshed things out with a variety of instruments: strings, sax, piano, harpsichord, flute and more. And yet, for all those home improvements, as the Line of Best Fit summed it up, \"the most amazing aspect about 'Somersault' is that it still has that bedroom-composed feel.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 3. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. SOLD OUT. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n5/4: Juice Wrld\n\nThis 20-year-old rapper topped the charts in early March with a second album called \"Death Race For Love.\" It hadn't been a full year since \"Goodbye & Good Riddance,\" an emo-rap debut that Pitchfork called \"an adolescent breakup record\" that's \"accordingly cathartic, petty, and clumsy in its emotional processing.\" And he managed to squeeze in a mixtape with Future between those two releases. He's still best known in the mainstream for his breakthrough single \"Lucid Dreams,\" a quadruple-platinum smash.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, May 4. Mesa Amphitheatre, 263 N. Center St. $49.95. 480-644-2560, mesaamp.com.\n\n5/5: August Alsina\n\nThis New Orleans-based R&B singer is best know for \"I Luv This S---t,\" a breakthrough hit that peaked at No. 4 on Billboard's R&B chart.\n\nThe New York Times responded to the singer's debut, \"Testimony,\" with, \"Most of this album moves with slowness and throbbing deliberation that focuses the ear and adds urgency to Mr. Alsina's confessions. It's also poignant for its intimacy.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, May 5. Marquee Theatre, 730 N. Mill Ave., Tempe. $35-$65. 480-829-0607, luckymanonline.com.\n\n5/5: Chromeo\n\nThese Canadian electro-funk sensations made a name for themselves in 2004 with a debut called “She’s in Control” that had critics invoking the names of Daryl Hall and John Oates. Drowned in Sound responded to their latest invitation to the dance floor with \"Funk-by-numbers has not yet had an update worth of Sly Stone; but in 'Head Over Heels,' Chromeo have cracked it. They never miss a beat in updating it for 2018.\" This is a DJ set at a pool party celebrating the sixth anniversary of Maya Day + Nightclub.\n\nDetails: Noon, Sunday, May 5. Maya Day & Nightclub, 7333 E. Indian Plaza, Scottsdale. $10-$15. 480-625-0528, mayaclubaz.com.\n\n5/5: Hayes Carll\n\nThis Texas-born Americana maverick is touring the States in support of \"What It Is,\" a collection whose more inspired moments effortlessly reaffirm his standing as one of the more distinctive voices on the modern country landscape while offsetting songs about hookups and heartache with insightful takes on our current political climate. On \"Fragile Men,\" for example, he sings, \"The whole world is exploding, and I know it feels so strange/ It must make you so damn angry / They're expecting you to change!\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, May 5. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $20-$30. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n5/6: Animals as Leaders\n\nThey're celebrating their 10th anniversary of defying expectations while blurring the lines between experimental metal, instrumental prog and modern jazz on albums as acclaimed as 2011's \"Weightless\" and their latest, \"The Madness of Many.\"\n\nAlternative Press responded to the cinematic soundscapes of their latest with \"AAL not only continue to cut through genre restrictions but do so while considering song and structure.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, May 6. Marquee Theatre, 730 N. Mill Ave., Tempe. $25-$45. 480-829-0607, luckymanonline.com.\n\n5/7: Violent Femmes and X\n\nFolk-punk standard-bearers Violent Femmes are on a co-headlining tour with X, the pride of old-school L.A. punk. Femmes took college radio by storm with 1983's career-defining self-titled debut, which featured any number of their most neurotic calling cards, from \"Blister in the Sun\" to \"Add It Up.\" And California punk never got any better than X, whose first album, \"Los Angeles,\" found bassist John Doe and Exene Cervenka bleeding passion all over Billy Zoom's best punkabilly licks.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 7. The Van Buren, 401 W. Van Buren St., Phoenix. SOLD OUT. 866-468-3399, thevanburenphx.com.\n\n5/7: Chromatics\n\nThe Double Exposure Tour features Chromatics' first public performances in more than five years. They'll be playing their personal picks from \"Night Drive,\" \"Kill For Love,\" \"Cherry\" and the as-yet-unreleased \"Dear Tommy\" backed by films directed by their multi-faceted producer Johnny Jewel and mixed live by video artist Danny Perez. The goal is to bring a cinematic experience to the concerts, effectively blurring the line between stage and screen.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 7. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $32.50; $30.50 in advance. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n5/8: The Eels\n\nSpeaking on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall, Mark Everett said, “We did a shorter tour than usual this past summer, and they were the most fun, exciting shows ever. We need to bring the love and positive energy to some of the places we didn’t get to last time. We know you’re hurting. Help is on the way.” It helps that their latest release, \"The Deconstruction,\" is another enigmatic journey through the mind of a man whose voice is as expressive as it is distinctive. The man remains an underrated treasure for the ages.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, May 8. The Van Buren, 401 W. Van Buren St., Phoenix. $38-$55. 866-468-3399, thevanburenphx.com.\n\n5/8: The Dodos\n\nMore than a decade down the road from \"Visiter,\" the San Francisco-based indie-folk duo are touring the States in continued support of an album called \"Certainty Waves,\" which plays to their eccentric strengths with hooks to spare.\n\nPopMatters responded to the album with \"The Dodos have made a record of blistering folk-pop poetry that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with 'Visiter.'\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, May 8.

Rebel Lounge, 2303 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $12. 602-296-7013, therebellounge.com.\n\n5/10: Foxing\n\nThe St. Louis emo sensations arrive in continued support of the masterful \"Nearer My God,\" an ambitious re-configuring of the genre's boundaries produced by Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie and driven by the soulful emoting of Conor Murphy. It helps that the heart on his sleeve has been broken by the existential demons of life in the 21st Century, not some failed romance. Sputnik Music hailed the album as \"emo's first definitive document on digital-age despair.\" This is a co-headlining tour with Now Now.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, May 10. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N.

It would sound a bit like \"Strange Trails.\" And last year's \"Vide Noir\" was just as cinematic while also expanding the scope of their sound with the help of producer Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips).\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, May 12. The Van Buren, 401 W. Van Buren St., Phoenix. $35; $32 in advance. 866-468-3399, thevanburenphx.com.\n\n5/14: Ariana Grande\n\nThe Sweetener tour takes its name from the singer's fourth studio album, which topped the Billboard album chart last August, spinning off the platinum single \"No Tears Left to Cry.\" And she already has another album out, returning to the top with \"Thank U, Next,\" whose title track and \"7 Rings\" both topped the Hot 100.\n\nRolling Stone found the opening night of the tour to be is \"full of emotional drama, iconic looks, and undeniable hits.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 14.

It's no wonder she can't get enough of herself. And the rest of the album lived up to the promise of that early taste. Her biggest U.S. hits are 2008's \"L.E.S. Artistes\" and 2012's \"Disparate Youth,\" but her albums are packed with songs that should have put her in a bigger room than this by now.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 14. The Van Buren, 401 W.
