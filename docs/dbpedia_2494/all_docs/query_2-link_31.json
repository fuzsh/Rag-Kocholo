        "text": "I love the app. I love the interface and the way you navigate throughout the app. But a few things that are really irritating and annoying are:\n\n1. When you watch the videos in the app and you try to flip your device sideways the video will stay in the upright position (even with lock rotation on allowing you to freely move your portrait), which is annoying since the picture is already as small as it is.\n\n2. There is a feature in the app where in a song you can take a picture given to you from the artist or your own picture and take lyrics from a particular song and put it over the picture. It makes for a cool background but every time i want to make one right before i save it to my camera roll the app decides to crash. Itâs a bummer because i canât find a way to get around it.\n\n3. When you download the app you can sign into a profile like any other app now but in Genius your profile is almost meaningless. They make it out like you can personalize your profile based on your style of music, which seems cool, but is not really the case. If you sign into google it takes your google account picture and makes it your profile picture without giving you a way to change it later. Overall the profile tab seems worthless now, but could be better in the future.\n\nGreat app overall tho, 4.5 / 5.\n\nI really love this app. It is really good for finding the lyrics to songs you like. and itâs really good to use when you want to know the lyrics to songs but however, I donât really like how when I close the app I have to re-sign in again. and I have to re-type in my password and email. I wish it wouldnât do that. They really need to fix this. I feel like if they would fix this the app would work better. and everyone would be much happier. I also donât like how after 30 seconds of it being in the background of other apps, it just closes and I have to re-open it and re-do everything again when I am trying to search for a song. lyrics I alsothink those things should get fixed at some point and I think that if those things get fixed, it will save me more time and I will have more time to find my favorite lyrics so anyway, if those things would get fixed, I think we would all be much happier about that I donât really like signing in so many times after I close it and how it just closes after 30 seconds when I open another app, it just closes itself. I donât like how it closes itself because it kind of wastes my time while Iâm trying to look for a song lyrics. and when it closes, I have to open it again and then I have to type my password and I have to do that all over again so if those things would get fixed, I think we would all be happier about it. itâs an amazing app but itâs just those two things that need to get fixed.\n\nThe app is great, but even when putting certain song titles I get something else, and it gets annoying where I also have to put an artist name right after the title to find the right song, also there should be an option when going to search a songâs lyrics to be a quick select option instead of having to search for it, which could work out great if you have Apple Music connected to the app just like when you change songs within the app it lets your quickly select the songs lyrics I would like that but quick and easy when I open the app it shows the option to pull up the song lyrics easily, besides a few search problems which can be done better and quicker access to lyrics on a currently playing song the app is great but those two things hold it back from getting a 5 star rating from me"
