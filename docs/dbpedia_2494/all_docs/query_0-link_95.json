        "text": "I’m sure many of you have noticed the kids of the music industry and how strange they remind us of some of the greats. Everyone has already proclaimed Justin Bieber as our Michael Jackson, but there are so many more.\n\nJustin Bieber has that voice that makes all of the girls hearts melt. No surprise many of us think of MJ when we hear Justin’s amazing talent. Right now he’s growing as the teen heartthrob, but that reputation may not last long. Justin’s making it clear that he doesn’t want to be put into one category as that bubble gum pop musician that record labels just love. He’s experimenting with country, pop, rap, and more. His fans just keep growing as he grows. Going crazy over the self-proclaimed “Shawty Mane”. Recently our boy Justin even remixed Drake’s hit song Trust Issues. Just like MJ we are sure Justin will be around for a very long time.\n\nNext is one of my personal favorites Jessica Jarrell. If you read this blog a lot you know from some previous posts that Jessica is very talented. Whenever I think of Jessica the 1st person that comes to mind is the one and only Beyoncé. Jessica not only has a beautiful voice like Beyoncé, and a great personality. These two ladies also have another thing in common, and that’s their gorgeous bodies. Looking at Jessica you wouldn’t know she’s a 16 year old girl. Jessica definitely has the “total package” she just needs learn how to use it.\n\nNext on our list is Mindless Behavior. We’ve been hearing all the craziness surrounding this cute boy group, and it’s well unbelievably…ummm CRAZY! These guys are gaining a crazy following right now, and I can’t help but think of the group B2K. They’re all so cute, but there’s always one or two that shine above the rest. Hopefully these guys will last longer than B2K did.\n\nWe will end our list with one more favorite, Avery. As you know if you read my other post titled “SUCCESS in 3…2…1” Avery sings one of our favorite songs right now which is GO SCREW YOURSELF or GSY! It’s definitely that anthem you sing when someone makes you mad. When we think of Avery we think Avril Lavigne. They both have the same type of…hmmm…swagger I guess. Their styles are very similar. Just go listen to Girlfriend by Avril and GSY by Avery and you’ll see what we’re talking about. The only difference we see is that Avery is a little more versatile. We love Avril, but she can’t sing every genre like Avery. Avery has the type of voice where she can sing lots of different types of music that many artists wouldn’t even attempt. As time goes on we think Avery will surpass Avril’s success.\n\nNow leave a comment and tell us who you think the music industry is trying to remake. You can even leave us a link and maybe we’ll check it out and send it to some people. Remember there are labels everywhere looking for young new artists to bring into the music business. You could be the next one. Even Justin Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun is looking for new talent. Play your cards right, and you could possibly meet JB!\n\n-@TRUTHiSHOUT"
