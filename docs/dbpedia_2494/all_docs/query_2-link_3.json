It was released on January 14, 2002, as the third single from their fourth studio album Celebrity. It was the group's last song to enter the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number five. \"Girlfriend\" additionally reached number one in Canada and charted within the top 10 in six other countries, including Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This was the last single and song the band released in their career before their reunion in 2023.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen originally announced as a single, the intention was for the album version of the track to be released along with a video and released to television. However, just weeks before the release, the group announced that the Neptunes would remix the song for its single release and feature two all-new verses with rapper Nelly. When Nelly was approached to record the song, he was initially met with resistance from his record label, who stated that he was trying to \"ruin [his] career\". Nelly insisted on appearing on the song, which they eventually conceded.[2] It was his first major cross-collaboration.[3]\n\nThe song contained a hip hop influence and was sent to top 40 and hot AC radio in January 2002 before being released commercially on March 12, 2002, as an enhanced CD.[4][5]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Billboard's Jason Lipshutz ranked it tenth on the list \"Top 20 Essential Boy Band Songs,\" writing, \"straddling the lines of pop, R&B and hip-hop, the song could have been the precursor to the boy band's stylistic shift, but instead proved to be the starting point for Justin Timberlake's solo career.\"[6]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo music videos exist for the single, which were both directed by Marc Klasfeld. The first video was released in late December 2001, while the Neptunes Remix debuted on March 12, 2002.[7]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video featured the band dancing on cars, singing to girls and a drag race, which was won by Justin Timberlake. The Neptunes Remix featured scenes of Nelly spliced between shots of the pre-existing video. He is shown rapping next to Timberlake during both of his rap verses, as well as interacting with female models in the backseat of the car throughout this version of the video. Scenes of Timberlake initiating the drag race in the interlude, which is shown in the original video, are heavily omitted in the Neptunes Remix to accommodate for Nelly's rap verse, which his second rap verse replaces.\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits and personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits are lifted from the UK CD single liner notes.[11]\n\nRecording\n\nRecorded at Right Track, NYC; Battery Studios, NYC; and WIRE Studios, Orlando, FL\n\nPersonnel\n\nJustin Timberlake – songwriter\n\nChad Hugo – songwriter, producer, remix producer\n\nPharrell Williams – songwriter, producer, remix producer\n\nThe Neptunes – producer, remix producer\n\nBrian Garten – recording, additional vocal recording\n\nPaul Gregory – assistant recording engineer\n\nRowie Nameri – assistant recording engineer\n\nMatina Scarpino – assistant recording engineer\n\nJean-Marie Horvat – mixing\n\nJosean Possey – assistant mixing engineer\n\nChaz Harper – mastering\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales for \"Girlfriend\"\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease dates and formats for \"Girlfriend\" Region Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
