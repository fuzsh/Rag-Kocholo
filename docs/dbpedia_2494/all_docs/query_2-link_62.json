        "text": "Common has said that he’ll be dropping new music soon — and his new girlfriend, Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson, may join him for a track or two.\n\nThe Hip Hop veteran sat down for an interview with Hot 97 on Wednesday (January 24). After recounting to the host Ebro the story of how he met Hudson, the Like Water for Chocolate rapper teased that they may be cooking up some new heat soon.\n\n“She got that down-to-earthness that I feel a lot of Chicagoans carry,” he said. “We thinkin’ about something right now that will work. Because when I do music, man, I don’t care who you are. It gotta fit.”\n\nHe continued: “But we got something that I definitely think is right for her. We gon’ take it some places.”\n\nCheck out the full interview below. The comments about Jennifer Hudson start at the 9:45 mark.\n\nCommon and Jennifer Hudson made their romance official in a sweet moment on Hudson’s daytime talk show.\n\nIn a clip released ahead of the January 22nd episode, the Chicago rapper arrives as a guest and presents Hudson with flowers.\n\nThe Dreamgirls star begins conducting the interview just like any other, before hitting the rap legend with the question: “Are you dating anybody?”\n\nCommon laughs and then answers: “Yes. I am in a relationship with one of the most beautiful people that I ever met in life. She’s smart, she loves God, she has something real down to earth about her.\n\n“She’s talented but I set my standard kinda high because she had to have an EGOT, she had to win an Oscar on her first movie, she had to get her own talk show.”\n\nHe adds: “So how’s you? How’s your love life?”\n\nHudson answers: “I’m dating as well and I am very happy. Are you happy in your relationship?”\n\nCommon replies: “This relationship is a happy place. For me, it’s one of them things where I found seeing her happy actually makes me really happy. I’m just thankful and I thank God every day.”\n\nHe adds: “We keep it private but I wanna acknowledge how wonderful she is, how great she is.”\n\nThe couple also shared a picture of Common kissing the singer on the cheek.\n\nIt was first rumored that the two were dating last January after shooting a movie together.\n\nHudson had previously played down the rumors of romance, saying: “People create their narratives of it, and it’s like, OK, you know, how you feel. We shot a film together, and he played my husband. We gotta eat in between those moments.”\n\nShe later confirmed she was in a relationship during an interview with Gayle King but did not name her partner, even though she had been seen on vacation with Common."
