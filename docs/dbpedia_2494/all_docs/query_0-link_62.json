        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- What did it mean to have a No. 1 hit in the 2000s?\n\nWhen it comes to music, most decades blend together. But the 21st century did away with most trends from the 1990s about halfway through the year 2000. Alternative rock and huge powerhouse ballads mostly fell by the wayside in favor of hip-hop, dance-pop and anything that could chart on MTV’s “Total Request Live” or make a splash on this emerging video streaming website called YouTube.\n\nIt’s a shift we know well since we already ranked every No. 1 song from the 1990s. (For what it’s worth, we also ranked every No. 1 song from the 1980s, angering pop-rock singer Richard Marx in the process).\n\nFor elder Millennials, the 2000s was where it’s at, serving as the formative decade for major stars like Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Nelly, a solo Justin Timberlake and others.\n\nOur list ranking every No. 1 song of the 2000s is all about quality. It doesn’t matter how long a song spent at No. 1. If that were the case, The Black Eyed Peas’ “Boom Boom Pow” would be in the top five and [SPOILER] it’s not.\n\nAlso, remember this is just one person’s sure-to-be-wrong opinion. So if Owl City’s “Fireflies” or Nickelback’s “How You Remind Me” was your jam, you can angry Tweet me (@troylsmith) whenever you want.\n\n129. D4L – “Laffy Taffy”\n\nDate: Jan. 14, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nMost sub-genres of hip hop have a brief shelf life. To its credit, crunk persevered longer than anyone expected. However, it also inspired snap music, which had its moment in the sun thanks to Dem Franchize Boys, Soulja Boy and Yung Joc before jumping the shark with D4L’s ridiculous “Laffy Taffy,” a song that has no redeemable qualities while also making a mockery of New Edition’s “Candy Girl.”\n\n128. James Blunt – “You’re Beautiful”\n\nDate: March 11, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 11\n\nJames Blunt’s “You’re Beautiful” is annoying. Don’t take my word for it. Blunt himself has summed up the song’s shortcomings better than anyone else could: “I think, at the end of the day, I was marketed by a record company to appeal to women during ‘Desperate Housewives’ commercials and you lose 50 percent of the population in doing so.”\n\n127. Ciara feat. Petey Pablo – “Goodies”\n\nDate: Sept. 11, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nThe seven weeks that “Goodies” spent at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 is testament to how on fire Lil Jon was as a producer in the 2000s. Dig deeper and you’ll realize “Goodies” is part of a two-song saga no one asked for. Ciara’s hit is a response to featured guest Petey Pablo’s own song “Freek-a-Leek.” This time around, the female protagonist wants nothing to do with the man’s sexual advances. But the lyric about “goodies” staying “in the jar” ruins everything.\n\n126. Taylor Hicks – “Do I Make You Proud”\n\nDate: July 1, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“American Idol” coronation song “Do I Make You Proud” could have gone in Billy Joel or Huey Lewis territory. But its overzealous gospel chorus removes that possibility. “Do I Make You Proud” is about as unspectacular as Taylor Hicks was as an “American Idol” winner.\n\n125. Akon feat. Snoop Dogg – “I Wanna Love You”\n\nDate: Dec. 2, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThe unedited version of Akon’s 2006 song is titled “I Wanna F*** You,” which amounts to about the laziest pickup line you can offer. But Snoop Dogg arrives to hijack the song from a nasally Akon by testing how many times a radio edit can cut the p-word from a song. This one’s cringeworthy.\n\n124. Mariah Carey feat. Joe and 98 Degrees – “Thank God I Found You”\n\nDate: Feb. 19, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nProof not every all-star collaboration works. “Thank God I Found You” is rough. Not only does every performer, including the amazing Mariah Carey, deliver some of the most mundane vocals of their career. But the drums on the track sound unfinished. That click sound sets off something in your brain destined to give you a migraine. If you want a MUCH better version, peep the “Make It Last Remix” featured on Joe’s album featuring Nas.\n\n123. Sean Kingston – “Beautiful Girls”\n\nDate: Aug. 11, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nProducer J.R. Rotem was smart to use the bass line of “Stand by Me,” one of the most iconic songs of all time, for Sean Kingston’s signature hit. Sadly, Kington’s weak reggae vocals destroy much of the timeless nature of the original song. Kingston goes for nostalgia. That trick was good for just one summer. But you never wanted to hear it again.\n\n122. Soulja Boy – “Crank That (Soulja Boy)”\n\nDate: Sept. 15, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nSoulja Boy released his viral hit before viral hits were really a thing. But a dance craze and tons of downloads on file-sharing services don’t make “Crank That” a good song. It’s far from it. Still, credit to Soulja Boy for stretching his novelty hit as far as he did.\n\n121. Jason Derulo – “Whatcha Say”\n\nDate: Nov. 14, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFans of Imogen Heap didn’t take kindly to Jason Derulo’s sampling of “Hide and Seek,” her emotional tour de force of a song beloved by indie-pop heads. The track loses its raw sentiment in the hands of Derulo and pop producer J.R. Rotem, who turn Heap’s voice into a corny gimmick. How dear they.\n\n120. Creed – “With Arms Wide Open”\n\nDate: Nov. 11, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt’s easy to make fun of Creed. Frontman Scott Stapp is exactly what you would draw up if you were doing a parody of Eddie Vedder and the grunge era. The band’s signature hit, “With Arms Wide Open,” is a well-structured song that wouldn’t be remotely as annoying if it dropped the “edgy” guitars for strings. If this were a Christian rock song you’d only heard once, you might tolerate it. But on mainstream radio every 30 minutes at the start of the 21st century? Oof. It was a bit much.\n\n119. Crazy Town – “Butterfly”\n\nDate: March 24, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nWhen a genre like rap-rock takes off, a lot of subpar bands join the feeding frenzy. Enter Crazy Town, whose hit “Butterfly” might have set rap back several years if not for its catchy hook taken from a Red Hot Chili Peppers sample.\n\n118. B2K feat. P. Diddy – “Bump, Bump, Bump”\n\nDate: Feb. 1, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSave for Omarion’s vocal performance, everything about “Bump, Bump, Bump” feels underwhelming. It’s ja paint-by-the-numbers early 2000s R&B/hip hop jam that wants to be “Where the Party At” or “I Need a Girl Part 2″ but never comes close.\n\n117. Ludacris feat. Pharrell – “Money Maker”\n\nDate: Oct. 28, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Money Maker” was made to be a summer anthem. Mission accomplished, even if served as one of the more run-of-the-mill songs by both Ludacris and the production team the Neptunes. It’s just another strip club anthem with lame pick-up lines that people couldn’t get enough of.\n\n116. Mary J. Blige – “Family Affair”\n\nDate: Nov. 3, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nI’m not sure there’s a beat from the 2000s that’s more likely to lull you to sleep. Mary J. Blige’s “Family Affair” had the hook and Dr. Dre keys to land on the top of the charts. But it’s hard not to get sick of the monotony of 30 seconds in.\n\n115. Nickelback – “How You Remind Me”\n\nDate: Dec. 22, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nFor as annoying as Nickelback was at its peak, the band knew how to write a hook. And “How You Remind Me” has a monstrous one that consumed the music world. It’s just a task getting to that point, as Chad Kroeger’s voice remains one of the most grating instruments of the 21st century.\n\n114. 50 Cent feat. Olivia – “Candy Shop”\n\nDate: March 5, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 9\n\nFat Joe once fired a diss at 50 Cent by asking, “Don’t ‘Candy Shop’ sound just like ‘Magic Stick?’” Truer words have never been spoken. It’s also a diss that works because “Candy Shop” isn’t nearly as clever as “Magic Stick.”\n\n113. Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule – “Ain’t It Funny”\n\nDate: March 9, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nNo, you weren’t seeing double in the early 2000s. After landing a big hit with the “Murder Remix” of “I’m Real,” Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule hit back again with the “Murder Remix” of “Ain’t It Funny.” Things didn’t seem quite as fresh the second time around. But J. Lo and Ja were on such a hit streak both together and separately, it didn’t matter.\n\n112. Timbaland feat. Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake – “Give It To Me”\n\nDate: April 27, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nTimbaland had already produced some stellar tracks for both Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake. So he doubled down for his 2007 hit “Give It To Me.” It’s a slick club anthem that doesn’t reach the heights of their previous collaborations with Furtado sounding a little disinterested and Timbaland firing shots at other producers.\n\n111. Daniel Powter – “Bad Day”\n\nDate: April 8, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nEven if you hated “Bad Day” (which you probably did), you couldn’t avoid it. Daniel Powter’s obnoxiously optimistic tune was chosen as the elimination song on “American Idol.” As if getting eliminated from the biggest show on television wasn’t enough, you had to watch a video tribute of your demise to this song.\n\n110. Owl City – “Fireflies”\n\nDate: Nov. 7, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nMany artists saturated blogs like Paste and Pitchfork during the early to mid-2000s doing emo-soaked indie-pop (See: Death Cab for Cutie, Dntel or The Postal Servic). But none of them reached the heights of Owl City’s “Fireflies.” Yet, creative mastermind Adam Young made two mistakes that were both out of his control. He arrived too late, making him seem like a copycat. And he was way to overt with his sentimentality. Pessimistic millennial kids don’t want to hear about getting hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs. From a critical standpoint, “Fireflies” has earned the kind of backlash as, say, Daniel Powter’s “Bad Day.” Neither is, in any way, original or nuanced. But history has been kinder to Young’s genius as he’s gone on to do fairly awesome songs for animated films like “Wreck-It Ralph” and “The Croods.” Those same pessimistic Millennials now have kids and are feeling Young’s music.\n\n109. Eminem feat. Dr. Dre and 50 Cent – “Crack a Bottle”\n\nDate: Feb. 21, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nEminem’s “Relapse” album was a mess. But it did give us “Crack a Bottle.” The song doesn’t break any new ground (Eminem’s verse, in particular, feels mailed in). But star power is everything, as it combines three of the biggest hip-hop artists of all time with a club-happy hook that works every time.\n\n108. T.I. feat. Rihanna – “Live Your Life”\n\nDate: Oct. 18, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nThis sort of pop turn was a natural progression for T.I. who had reached the top of the rap world. The message of “Life Your Life” is admirable (T.I. dedicates the song to American troops in Iraq) and Rihanna’s hook soars. But the song is over polished, ripping away the raw, Southern swag that made T.I. so likable in the first place.\n\n107. The Black Eyed Peas – “Boom Boom Pow”\n\nDate: April 18, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 12\n\nWhen The Black Eyed Peas arrived in the late 1990s, no one would have thought they’d become one of the biggest pop acts in the world...or a pop act at all. By the time the group’s “The E.N.D.” album dropped in 2009, the raw hip hop origins were all but gone. It was for the better, at least from a commercial standpoint. “Boom Boom Pow” gets annoying about a minute in. But the song fell in line with the EDM rush of the 21st century, staying on top of the charts for an insane 12 weeks.\n\n106. Beyoncé feat. Slim Thug – “Check on It”\n\nDate: Feb. 4, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nOne of the most repetitive tracks on this list. The beat from Swizz Beatz wears itself out pretty fast. But Beyonce’s swagger is more than enough to carry “Check on It.”\n\n105. Clay Aiken – “This Is the Night”\n\nDate: June 28, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nDespite finishing as the runner-up on the second season of “American Idol,” it was Clay Aiken’s single that went to No. 1 and not winner Rubben Studdard’s “Flying Without Wings.” It helps that “This Is the Night” wasn’t written for the show, but rather penned by Chris Braide and his team as a post-9/11 anthem. It’s not as splashy as other singles on this list, but “This Is the Night” benefits from Aiken going all out with his vocal.\n\n104. Akon – “Don’t Matter”\n\nDate: April 7, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nBetween Sean Kingston’s “Beautiful Girls” and Akon’s “Don’t Matter,” people had a thing for rather forgettable, reggae-infused R&B in 2007. “Don’t Matter” is the lesser of two evils that wisely borrows from Bob Marley’s “Zimbabwe” for its semi-catchy hook.\n\n103. Carrie Underwood – “Inside Your Heaven”\n\nDate: July 2, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nEven Carrie Underwood’s amazing voice can’t over shadow the emptiness of “Inside Your Heaven,” a by-the-numbers “American Idol” coronation song. The title is enough to make you roll your eyes. But thanks to Underwood’s massive success post “Idol,” this one is mostly forgotten.\n\n102. Nelly feat. Paul Wall, Ali and Gipp – “Grillz”\n\nDate: Jan. 21, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Grillz” marked the end of an impressive run on the charts for Nelly during the 2000s. As a novelty song, it had the shortest shelf life of his other songs. But that beat from Jermaine Dupri still knocks.\n\n101. Mims – “This Is Why I’m Hot”\n\nDate: March 10, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nHot beat, check. Memorable catchphrase, check. Claims of copious swagger, check. Mims certainly had the formula down to take “This Is Why I’m Hot” to the top of the charts. Yet, listing the reasons why you’re hot isn’t going to earn you too many points as a lyricist. Mims called it himself on his signature song: “I don’t gotta rap. I could sell a mill sayin’ nothin’ on the track.” It had one-hit-wonder written all over it.\n\n100. Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone – “Ridin’”\n\nDate: June 3, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Ridin’” is a good catchphrase masquerading as a great song. It’s one of those songs where you get everything you have to get done at the party (bathroom break, refill, fist bump, etc.) out of the way during the verses so you don’t miss your chance to drunkenly recite the chorus.\n\n99. Rihanna – “Disturbia”\n\nDate: Aug. 23, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAs a pop song, “Disturbia” isn’t bad. It just leans into its theme a little too much. As if the opening scream wasn’t enough, Rihanna beats the listener over the head with the song’s creepy vibes. “Thriller” this ain’t.\n\n98. Janet – “Doesn’t Really Matter”\n\nDate: Aug. 26, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“Doesn’t Really Matter” feels a little pasted together. The song, based on a Janet Jackson poem and featured on the “Nutty Professor II: The Klumps Soundtrack” is driven by its electropop sound. Yet, the synths tend to overwhelm Jackson’s vocal, which was rather thin to begin with.\n\n97. Lonestar – “Amazed”\n\nDate: March 4, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nStudies have been done that show more than 2,000 wedding couples used Lonestar’s “Amazed” as their first-dance song in 2000. Okay, I’m making that up. But “Amazed” makes excellent use of the same tricks pop ballads had been milking for decades. It’s wrapped in uplifting cliches that are perfect for the wedding dancefloor.\n\n96. Jay Sean feat. Lil Wayne – “Down”\n\nDate: Oct. 17, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nDespite having several huge hits in Europe and Asia, Jay Sean’s sole banger in the States was “Down” featuring Lil Wayne. It’s a catchy pop song, but one that sounds like 90 percent of the other hits that came out in 2007 (Jason Derulo’s similar-sounding and more annoying “Whatcha Say” hit No. 1 just a month later).\n\n95. Flo Rida feat. Kesha – “Right Round”\n\nDate: Feb. 28, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nThe Flo Rida hit-making formula is pretty simple. Take a song everyone knows – in this particular case, Dead or Alive’s “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)” -- and twist it into a pop-rap/EDM hybrid. And “Right Round” may be the finest (or least offensive) example of this. The song’s biggest claim to fame is that it introduced most of the world to Kesha a few months before she exploded with her run of hits.\n\n94. Fantasia – “I Believe”\n\nDate: July 10, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAnother “American Idol” song, which means another tune that pours on the sappiness. Fantasia Barrino elevates “I Believe” with the power of her voice, making it truly inspirational. My only criticism is that the studio version doesn’t quite match the power of her “Idol” finale performance.\n\n93. T.I. – “Whatever You Like”\n\nDate: Sept. 6, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nT.I.’s trap music will always be more digestible than his pop leanings. But “Whatever You Like” is still an impressive feat for any rapper. T.I. managed to conquer the charts for seven weeks with a song void of any actual rapping.\n\n92. Sean Paul – “Temperature”\n\nDate: April 1, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSean Paul had a big 2003 thanks to “Get Busy” and his feature on Beyonce’s “Baby Boy” (both still to come on this list). When he returned three years later, he took back control of the dancehall formula that produced an endless number of imitators. “Temperature” may have only spent one week on top of the charts. But its ability to peak in spring set it up to remain high on the charts during the summer.\n\n91. Chris Brown feat. T-Pain – “Kiss Kiss”\n\nDate: Nov. 10, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nBoy, does T-Pain hijack “Kiss Kiss” from Chris Brown. Nappy Boy was on fire. Brown’s lyrics are rather forgettable but he manages to ride the Auto-Tune train along with T-Pain, even if at a slightly slower pace.\n\n90. Nelly, P. Diddy and Murphy Lee – “Shake Ya Tailfeather”\n\nDate: Sept. 6, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nDiddy wasn’t gonna executive produce the “Bad Boys II” soundtrack without delivering a few bangers. The biggest hit of the bunch was “Shake Ya Tailfeather,” which feels like an amalgam of every breezy summer anthem of the 2000s. Nelly gets the “Step Your Rap Game Up” award for this one: “Is that you’re a** or your mama half reindeer?”\n\n89. Juvenile feat. Soulja Slim – “Slow Motion”\n\nDate: Aug. 7, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nFor as dominant as Cash Money Records was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, the label didn’t earn a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 until Juvenile’s “Slow Motion.” Not only does the song feature one of the catchiest choruses of any hip-hop song of the decade, but it also put the spotlight on Soulja Slim, one of the great New Orleans rappers who was murdered at the age of 26.\n\n88. Destiny’s Child - “Independent Women Pt. 1″\n\nDate: Nov. 18, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 11\n\n“Charlie’s Angels” was a movie about three women who kick but. So, Destiny’s Child, which had been cut down to three women, was perfect for the soundtrack. “Independent Women” comes with a catchy beat that would fit in with 1990s hip hop and dance-pop, while the women of DC sing about being financially independent. It was a pretty empty song in terms of substance. But Destiny’s Child was at its peak powers, reigning at No. 1 for 11 weeks.\n\n87. Mariah Carey – “Touch My Body”\n\nDate: April 12, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nYou could make the case that several of the songs Mariah Carey released post-2005 were simple remakes of “We Belong Together.” That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Carey’s more playful and laid back on “Touch My Body,” a song that blends together with most of her output from this period.\n\n86. Rihanna – “SOS”\n\nDate: May 13, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nProducer J.R. Rotem never met a classic he didn’t want to sample. For Rihanna’s “SOS,” he turned his attention to “Tainted Love.” Rotem does himself a service by giving the rest of the production more of a reggae feel. The lyrics are another story, mostly falling flat. Thankfully, the beat more than makes up for it.\n\n85. Joe feat. Mystikal – “Stutter”\n\nDate: Feb. 24, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nThe original “Stutter” from Joe’s album “My Name Is Joe” is a clever concept. But the remix (released on the soundtrack to the forgotten film “Double Take”) plays up the stuttering aspect and samples The Pharcyde’s hip hop classic “Passin’ Me By.” The beat, Joe’s fantastic hook and an unhinged verse from Mystikal is a winning formula.\n\n84. Avril Lavigne – “Girlfriend”\n\nDate: May 5, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAvril Lavigne’s “Girlfriend” didn’t break new ground either in subject matter or production. It’s a song about crushing on a guy who already has a girlfriend that sonically plays like a remake of Toni Basil’s “Mickey.” That wasn’t the only song “Girlfriend” was indebted to The similarities in the chorus with The Rubinoos’ 1979 single “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend” would lead to a lawsuit. Regardless, “Girlfriend” became one of Avril Lavigne’s catchiest hits and a quintessential pop-punk anthem.\n\n83. Sisqó – “Incomplete”\n\nDate: Aug. 12, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIf you asked people to name Sisqo’s sole No. 1 hit most would guess “The Thong Song.” Not so. Sisqo’s novelty hit was just the beginning of his post-Dru Hill run, followed by a couple of high-profile features and then the blissful “Incomplete.” It’s easily the best solo song of his career and a true representation of what he was capable of as a singer.\n\n82. Shaggy feat. Rayvon – “Angel”\n\nDate: March 31, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nShaggy’s career resurgence is a true underdog story. No one expected to hear from Mr. Boombastic again, at least not on a mainstream level. Then he drops two huge hits during the first quarter of 2001. Angel was riding the wave of “It Wasn’t Me” and is a blatant attempt at a cheesy love song. Still, Shaggy’s collaboration with Rayvon is a primo ballad that truly cemented Shaggy a mainstream commodity even Sting could jam with.\n\n81. Jennifer Lopez feat. Ja Rule – “I’m Real”\n\nDate: Sept. 8, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nThe original version of “I’m Real,” from Jennifer Lopez’s album “J.Lo,” was very different. It’s the “Murder Remix” featuring Ja Rule that drove the song to No. 1 for over a month. The track has a bit of whimsy to it and anyone who ever DJ’d at a college bar at the time will tell you Ja Rule’s opening shout will pack the dancefloor.\n\n80. The Black Eyed Peas – “I Gotta Feeling”\n\nDate: July 11, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 14\n\nThis song was annoyingly EVERYWHERE, even in a Target commercial. Even at four minutes, the radio edit feels a bit too long. But credit to The Black Eyed Peas for collaborating with producer David Guetta on a track that feels rather timeless both in subject matter and sound.\n\n79. Beyoncé feat. Sean Paul – “Baby Boy”\n\nDate: Oct. 4, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 9\n\nThere was no stopping the Beyonce train at this point. Hard to imagine now, but “Baby Boy” was an even bigger hit than “Crazy In Love.” It helped that Sean Paul was also at the peak of his star power, at times making Bey sound like the guest on her own song. Dutty yo!\n\n78. Usher feat. Young Jeezy – “Love in This Club”\n\nDate: March 15, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nUsher has better singles than “Love in This Club.” But the song remains one of his ultimate celebratory anthems. If you don’t believe me, just go back to the scene from Jennifer Lopez’s “Hustlers,” which makes “Love in This Club” legendary.\n\n77. Ashanti – “Foolish”\n\nDate: April 20, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nAfter making a name for herself singing the hook on tracks for Ja Rule, Ashanti released a single that even Ja couldn’t match. “Foolish” spent a whipping 10 weeks on the charts. Ashanti never had the biggest voice. But you can’t go wrong with the DeBarge sample Biggie made famous on “One More Chance (Remix).”\n\n76. Mariah Carey – “Don’t Forget About Us”\n\nDate: Dec. 31, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThere’s something slightly awkward at first about the piano melody on “Don’t Forget About Us.” It’s as if it’s trying too hard to be melancholy. And yet, I’m probably short-changing the song’s ranking. Mariah sings the heck out of the hook.\n\n75. Britney Spears – “Womanizer”\n\nDates: Oct. 25, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nI haven’t looked it up, but there’s no question “Womanizer” holds the record for squeezing the word “womanizer” into a pre-chorus, right? Production team The Outsyders turn up the synths to a 10. At times, making Spears sound like a cyborg, which actually works for the sonic-charged hook.\n\n74. Ludacris feat. Shawnna – “Stand Up”\n\nDate: Dec. 6, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIf Kanye West’s excellent beat wasn’t enough, Ludacris and Shawnna secure “Stand Up” as a go-to club anthem with the chorus: “When I move/you move—Just like that.” Luda had more dynamic songs in the 2000s, but timing can be everything. He managed to push “Stand Up” to the No. 1 spot right as Beyonce’s “Baby Boy” was ending its run and just before Outkast’s “Hey Ya!” took over the world.\n\n73. Fergie – “London Bridge”\n\nDate: Aug. 19, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nFergie shouldn’t have been able to pull this off with her debut single. After all, she is the woman who took The Black Eyed Peas full pop. And yet, “London Bridge” knocks and not just because of Polow da Don’s fantastic beat. Fergie’s swaggering performance is the song’s driving force.\n\n72. Rihanna – “Take a Bow”\n\nDate: May 24, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Take a Bow” is one of Rihanna’s most relatable songs. RiRi makes up for any vocal shortcomings with vulnerability. If she sounds believable as a 20-year-old who was heartbroken, it’s because that’s exactly what she was.\n\n71. Ja Rule feat. Ashanti – “Always on Time”\n\nDate: Feb. 23, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIf all the collaborations between Ja Rule and Ashanti were to blend into one song (which they kind of do anyway), it would be “Always on Time.” It’s easy to see why Ja Rule’s schtick became annoying – his voice and thug persona was always a bit too grating for this sort of thing. Yet, “Always on Time” still works, somehow. Ja Rule’s meh verses aside, the man could write a heck of a hook and Ashanti knew how to deliver it.\n\n70. Kelly Clarkson – “A Moment Like This”\n\nDate: Oct. 5, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“A Moment Like This” will forever be embedded in pop-culture history as the culmination of the first season of “American Idol.” It isn’t the most spectacular 21st-century pop song (it most certainly sounds like something Whitney Houston would sing in the 1980s). But even at the age of 20, Clarkson showed why she was the perfect person to win that first season. Her vocal performance on “A Moment Like This” is damn near perfect.\n\n69. Usher and Alicia Keys – “My Boo”\n\nDate: Oct. 30, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nAt this point, Usher was just playing on a different level. Consider “My Boo,” a song with another massive pop star that would spend six weeks at No. 1, was released as a bonus cut on “Confessions.” The track is less dynamic than some of the other No. 1 songs Usher would release from the blockbuster album. But “My Boo” is about as can’t-miss as you can get for an R&B tune.\n\n68. Justin Timberlake – “What Goes Around... Comes Around”\n\nDate: March 3, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“What Goes Around... Comes Around” finds Justin Timberlake rehashing the theme of “Cry Me a River” on a song that is way too long for a single (over five minutes for the radio edit). Yet, by this point, JT and Timbaland were basking in the glory of their collaboration. Consider it a victory lap.\n\n67. Matchbox Twenty – “Bent”\n\nDate: July 22, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIf you took a poll as to whether Matchbox Twenty’s “Bent” was released in the 1990s or 2000s, you’d probably have the overwhelming majority of people guess the former. “Bent” sounds like a leftover from a different decade, recalling Matchbox Twenty’s other huge songs like “3AM” and “Unwell.” Even if it’s not quite as great as those songs, “Bent” still soft rocks its way into your head.\n\n66. Destiny’s Child – “Bootylicious”\n\nDate: Aug. 4, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nI’m surprised a million pop songs haven’t sampled the iconic riff from Stevie Nicks’ “Edge of Seventeen.” Right from the start, you know you’re in for something special. “Bootylicious” is no “Edge of Seventeen.” But it is a clever pop song that found Destiny’s Child owning its sexuality in a way that took the group to new heights.\n\n65. Usher – “U Got It Bad”\n\nDate: Dec. 15, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nAny doubts if Usher could maintain his mass appeal as an adult were laid to rest with “U Got It Bad,” the breakup anthem of the year in 2001. Usher wisely borrows from a few other songs with the lyrics (Maxwell’s “Fortunate” and Prince’s “Adore”). “U Got It Bad” had women lining up to be Usher’s rebound.\n\n64. Jennifer Lopez feat. LL Cool J – “All I Have”\n\nDate: Feb. 8, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nThe chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and LL Cool J on “All I Have” is undeniable. But let’s not kid ourselves. The magic of the single is the Debra Laws sample. It melts you right from the start of the song.\n\n63. Pink – “So What”\n\nDate: Sept. 27, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“So What” marked a moment of validation for Pink. Not only was it her defiant anthem following a separation with Corey Hart. But the song marked her first solo No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. “So What” plays like a bratty tune with its massive chorus (Max Martin strikes again) creeping up on you.\n\n62. Christina Aguilera – “Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)”\n\nDate: Oct. 14, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nOn her first album, Christina Aguilera was working the same Disney-approved pop formula her counterpart (and maybe rival) Britney Spears was. Just listen to the bridge of “Come On Over Baby” and you can easily imagine Spears singing it. And yet, just seconds after that generic bridge, Aguilera delivers a run reminiscent of Mariah Carey. “Come On Over Baby” is a pretty straightforward dance-pop song. But it was clear, with those pipes, Aguilera was becoming a superstar.\n\n61. Sean Paul – “Get Busy”\n\nDate: May 10, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nAh, the Diwali Riddim – the dancehall handclap you couldn’t get enough of (or escape) in the 2000s. There was the good (Wayne Wonder’s “No Letting Go”), the meh (Lumidee’s “Never Leave You”) and everything in between. But no song made it bigger than “Get Busy.” Of all the club anthems Sean Paul delivered during the decade, nothing packed the dancefloors quite like “Get Busy.”\n\n60. 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg – “21 Questions”\n\nDate: May 31, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nHow did we let 50 Cent get away with this? He essentially won a rap feud with Ja Rule by claiming Ja was a pretend thug singing songs for women. And then 50 Cent did the same exact thing. It helped that “21 Questions” is infinitely better than every Ja Rule song and brings in the greatest hook man in the business – Nate Dogg (RIP) -- on one of Fiddy’s signature songs.\n\n59. Nelly Furtado feat. Timbaland – “Promiscuous”\n\nDate: July 8, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nIs this the woman who sang “I’m Like a Bird?” Nelly Furtado veered into edgier pop territory on her sophomore album “Folklore.” But with Timbaland at the helm for 2006′s “Loose,” things were different and rather mind-blowing, starting with the bouncy “Promiscuous.”\n\n58. Usher – “Confessions Part II”\n\nDate: July 24, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Confessions Part II” is one of the more complex examples of art imitating life. Following a breakup with TLC’s Chili, Usher released a concept album that, in part, focused on infidelity. The “Confessions” saga plays out like a soap opera with the singer admitting he was unfaithful and got another woman pregnant. That put Usher in hot water. Thankfully, it was later revealed that Jermaine Dupri, the song’s writer, was referring to his own life. It was a bit confusing, but listeners didn’t care. The drama only added to the hype around “Confessions.”\n\n57. Shakira feat. Wyclef Jean – “Hips Don’t Lie”\n\nDate: June 17, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nWhen “Hips Don’t Lie” was released in 2006, co-writer Wyclef was there to give Shakira a bit of cred as she tried to break into the American market. Listening back, you kind of just wish he would get out of the way. “Hips Don’t Lie’s” production feels a bit subdued. But Shakira kills it both with her vocal and in the video that took over MTV.\n\n56. Katy Perry – “I Kissed a Girl”\n\nDate: June 28, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nKaty Perry has openly admitted she’d rewrite the lyrics to “I Kissed a Girl.” It’s not exactly an authentic LGBTQ anthem. Still, “I Kissed a Girl” is a great pop song with a beat from Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco that builds the drama to a chorus that explodes like a sonic boom.\n\n55. Terror Squad – “Lean Back”\n\nDate: Aug. 21, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nFat Joe had long been searching for his big No. 1 club anthem. He found it in “Lean Back,” a song built around Scott Storch’s iconic synth keys and a dance move even big guys could do.\n\n54. Lady Gaga feat. Colby O’Donis – “Just Dance”\n\nDate: Jan. 7, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nLady Gaga is one of the most daring and distinct artists of her generation. But her first single was a straight-forward club anthem that could have been a hit in several artists’ hands. As proof, Gaga cedes the spotlight on “Just Dance” to Akon and his protégé Colby O’Donis for a good portion of the song. That doesn’t mean “Just Dance” doesn’t slap. Gaga is the most intriguing part of the song during the bridge, teasing the attitude that would highlight her future songs.\n\n53. Alicia Keys – “No One”\n\nDate: Dec. 1, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nBallads don’t get much simpler than “No One.” They aren’t often this good either. Alicia Keys has delivered better vocals, but none are as raw and emotionally heartfelt. Keys also brilliantly resists any urge to over-sing, allowing the subtle, yet soulful production to shine behind her.\n\n52. Mario – “Let Me Love You”\n\nDate: Jan. 1, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 9\n\n“Let Me Love You” is one of the more underrated love songs of the 2000s. The track, written by Ne-Yo does away with any flashy elements, sticking to a classic R&B formula with Mario’s vocals leading the way. This one could have been a hit in any decade.\n\n51. Coldplay – “Viva la Vida”\n\nDate: June 28, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAnyone who watched “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” knew that Coldplay had become a punchline by the second half of the 2000s. But those jokes wouldn’t have hit so hard had Coldplay not been cranking out universally loved tunes. Driven by a string arrangement, “Viva la Vida” feels like the kind of anthem suited to score the biggest events in the world (which it did). It was also quite an achievement for the band, considering how hard it was for a rock act to top the charts at this point in the decade.\n\n50. Plain White T’s – “Hey There Delilah”\n\nDate: July 28, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nTalk about a slow build. Plain White T’s frontman Tom Higgenson wrote “Hey There Delilah” in 2003. The song was originally released on the band’s 2005 album. Hardcore fans latched onto it. Soon, the rest of the world would too, embracing the track’s simplicity and heartfelt lyrics at a time when pop-punk was at its peak.\n\n49. Shaggy feat. Ricardo ‘Rikrok’ Ducent – “It Wasn’t Me”\n\nDate: Feb. 3, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThe appeal of Shaggy’s “It Wasn’t Me” should have lasted less than a month. And yet, here we are in 2021 and it’s still in pop culture. The song’s chorus is catchy and the catchphrase it’s built around is something you’ve said in your life at least once to get out of trouble. The beauty of Shaggy and his music is that he didn’t take himself too seriously, making it easy to still embrace “It Wasn’t Me” with open arms.\n\n48. Maroon 5 – “Makes Me Wonder”\n\nDate: March 12, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nMaroon 5′s debut album “Songs About Jane” stayed in rotation on the radio seemingly forever. Thus, the band’s second album, “It Won’t Be Soon Before Long,” gets overlooked in the context of Maroon 5′s history. But it’s arguably better than its predecessor, led by “Makes Me Wonder,” a groovy mix of pop-rock and dance music that leans into Maroon 5′s funk influence.\n\n47. Enrique Iglesias – “Be With You”\n\nDate: June 24, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nNo one embraced drama quite like Enrique Iglesias. Even when he had a song that was emotional in theme and lyrics, his voice would give it that extra, tearful punch. “Be With You” fits in that mold but reaches for even greater heights as a heartfelt ballad disguised as a dance track. Yet, no matter how much Enrique wants to push those dancefloor vibes, we can’t help but wait for the brief breakdown where it’s just his voice and a Spanish guitar. Swoon.\n\n46. Janet – “All For You”\n\nDate: April 14, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nIf Janet Jackson’s first single from the 21st century, “Doesn’t Really Matter,” felt a bit underwhelming, “All For You” hit all the right marks. The breezy tune confirmed Janet was still a superstar in yet another decade and that you could ride a disco beat some 20-plus years after the genre faded.\n\n45. Ne-Yo – “So Sick”\n\nDate: March 18, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nNe-Yo had already penned one No. 1 hit with Mario’s “Let Me Love You.” Riding the same formula of a simple melody and incredible vocal, Ne-Yo scored again with his breakthrough song as an artist on “So Sick.” He one-ups himself lyrically with a more unique theme and relatable tone, making “So Sick” a sappy, yet timeless breakup song.\n\n44. T-Pain feat. Yung Joc – “Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin’)”\n\nDate: May 26, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nT-Pain has told the story that “Buy U a Drank” was the first song he wrote intending to write a hit and it shows. He focused on the concept of what do people like? Drinking and flirting topped the list. Plugin some Auto-Tune harmonies, clever ad-libs and mission accomplished.\n\n43. Fergie feat. Ludacris – “Glamorous”\n\nDate: March 24, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Are you ready?” The answer to the opening line of Fergie’s “Glamorous” is no. Count me among those who underestimated Stacy Ferguson. I figured she might be able to score maybe one modest hit out of her solo career. Instead, she went on an epic run. At the center of it was the magnificent “Glamorous,” a blissful song that cascades over some of Polow da Don’s finest production and gets an awesome guest verse Ludacris.\n\n42. Nelly feat. Kelly Rowland – “Dilemma”\n\nDate: Aug. 17, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nNelly had the hottest song of the summer in 2002 with “Hot In Herre.” And the only person who could stop its dominance on the charts was...Nelly. He did it with a track at the opposite end of the spectrum. With help from Destiny’s Child’s Kelly Rowland, “Dilemma” shows the softer side of Nelly, which, to everyone’s surprise, was more appealing than the swaggering, club-going rapper.\n\n41. Usher – “U Remind Me”\n\nDate: July 7, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nWhen Usher returned with his album “8701″ in 2001, he was no longer a teen heartthrob. To show off his grown-man status, Usher delivered a single with as much, if not more replay value than anything he’d ever recorded. “U Remind Me” rides a simple melody throughout, peaking at the stunning bridge, where Usher proves himself one of the best singers of his generation.\n\n40. Chris Brown – “Run It!”\n\nDate: Nov. 26, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nFor as successful as his career has been, it’s rather shocking Chris Brown’s biggest hit remains his debut single. “Run It!” benefits from a solid guest appearance from rapper Juelz Santana. But its real appeal is Brown capitalizing on his star-is-born-moment. A good-looking kid who could dance, sing and had swagger for days? Always a winning formula.\n\n39. Outkast feat. Sleepy Brown – “The Way You Move”\n\nDate: Feb. 14, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nWhile Andre 3000 was out shocking the world with “Hey Ya!,” Big Boi was smoothing things out with a hip hop-soul jam that feels timeless. “The Way You Move” suggests the solid solo career Big Boi would go on to have. But just imagine how big of a hit “The Way You Move” would have been if it didn’t have to wait for “Hey Ya!” to move out the way.\n\n38. Kelly Clarkson – “My Life Would Suck Without You”\n\nDate: Feb. 7, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nKelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone” is probably the greatest single from this decade to not hit No. 1 (It peaked at No. 2). But Clarkson got her moment in the spotlight again five years later with “My Life Would Suck Without You.” The sentiments of the songs are similar. But “My Life Would Suck Without You” explodes with its Max Martina and Dr. Luke fueled chorus. There was no question this time around as the song went straight to the top of the charts.\n\n37. Twista feat. Kanye West and Jamie Foxx – “Slow Jamz”\n\nDate: Feb. 24, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIf you go back to Kanye West’s “College Dropout,” his raps (save for a few songs like “Jesus Walks”) weren’t much to write home about. But he made up for it with uncanny production skills, creativity and lines like “Slow Jamz’s“ “She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson...” The track first appeared in long-form on Ye’s debut album. But he gifted it to Twista, who delivers a tongue-twisting verse, for the single version. The real star of “Slow Jamz,” however, is Jamie Foxx, who pays homage to the R&B legends he’s singing about on with a fantastic vocal on the chorus.\n\n36. Nelly Furtado – “Say It Right”\n\nDate: Feb. 24, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThese days, “Say It Right” might get lost in the shuffle of Timbaland’s amazing run of pop production in the 2000s. A second listen suggests it’s about as good as anything else the super producer put out there. “Say It Right” is a song driven by Timbaland’s earth-shattering drum beats that hark back to the larger-than-life pop era of the 1980s. And Nelly Furtado’s unique voice is just the instrument to drive it home.\n\n35. Christina Aguilera – “What a Girl Wants”\n\nDate: Jan. 15, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThe first No. 1 single of the 2000s (Not counting Santana and Rob Thomas’ “Smooth,” which carried over from 1999). Christina Aguilera had quite a task ahead of herself following up “Genie in a Bottle.” But “What a Girl Wants” (a song originally recorded by French singer Ophélie Winter) truly finds Aguilera coming into her own. Her voice sounds bigger and the runs are more amazing. Aguilera was also willing to take some control, insisting the single version of the be sped up versus the album version. Smart move.\n\n34. Flo Rida feat. T-Pain, “Low”\n\nDate: Jan. 5, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nFlo Rida’s “Low” hit the dancefloor like an atomic bomb in 2008. No one had heard of Flo Rida. And yet, moms and dads everywhere were singing about “Apple Bottom Jeans” and the “boots with the fur...” The song’s MVP is clearly T-Pain, whose hook was one of the hottest things of the 2000s.\n\n33. Fergie – “Big Girls Don’t Cry”\n\nDate: Sept. 8, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nWith the first three singles from “The Dutchess,” Fergie had more than proven she could hold her own as a solo act. The only thing left to prove is she could sing a ballad. Enter “Big Girls Don’t Cry.” Fergie ditched the flashy production of Polow da Don for a simple track produced by her groupmate will.i.am. She nails every aspect of the heartfelt song. “Big Grils Don’t Cry” wasn’t met with the same success as some of the earlier singles from Fergie’s album. But it’s the song that’s endured the most.\n\n32. Vertical Horizon – “Everything You Want”\n\nDate: July 15, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe 1990s is littered with great, radio-ready rock anthems like “Everything You Want.” But even compared to a lot of those songs, Vertical Horizon’s signature tune wins out. It’s well-produced, honest and as catchy as any pop song from its era. They simply don’t make alt-rock like this anymore, which is a shame.\n\n31. Justin Timberlake – “SexyBack”\n\nDate: Sept. 9, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nAny song built around a catchphrase is going to wear thin eventually. But Justin Timberlake’s “SexyBack” marked a shift in pop music. That synth-heavy Timbaland beat accompanied by JT’s distorted vocals brought electro-R&B to the forefront. Imitators lined up around the block, but none of them could match it.\n\n30. Usher – “Burn”\n\nDate: May 22, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 8\n\nUsher knew what he had in “Burn.” In fact, he loved the song from “Confessions” so much he tried (and failed) to have it replace “Yeah!” as the album’s first single. It’s easy to see why he loved the song so much. “Burn” finds him in his comfort zone, using his stunning voice to elevate what is otherwise a pretty straight-forward ballad. Usher’s runs and harmonies on the chorus (switching in and out of his falsetto with ease) are unmatched.\n\n29. Alicia Keys – “Fallin’”\n\nDate: Aug. 18, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\n“Fallin’” is one of those records that presents an artist as being so talented, it’s almost annoying how great they are. “Fallin’” is a very traditional soul song with touches of neo-soul. Right from the start, Alicia Keys didn’t need much to woo you and “Fallin’” is one of the great debuts of the 21st century.\n\n28. Kanye West – “Stronger”\n\nDate: Sept. 27, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIf we’d done a list of the greatest songs of the 2000s regardless of chart status, rest assured Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” would rate high. Thus, it’s not surprising that Kanye West’s brilliant flipping of that French duo’s song shows up relatively high. No other mainstream rapper could pull off an hip-hop song this centered on EDM. But Ye, when he was in his zone, was one of kind.\n\n27. Beyoncé – “Irreplaceable”\n\nDate: Dec. 16, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nThe evolution of “Irreplaceable” is interesting. Writer Ne-Yo originally penned it from a male perspective as a country song driven by an acoustic guitar. Once production team Stargate added their touches, it was clear the track had massive R&B potential. But it was never intended for Beyonce until the singer heard a demo. Beyonce’s album “B’Day” is driven by hard-hitting anthems like “Deja Vu” and “Get Me Bodied.” And yet, “Irreplaceable” became its standout track. Beyonce’s vocal is tremendously heartfelt, tackling relatable subject matter with a brilliant hook (“To the left, to the left”) you can’t get out of your head.\n\n26. Savage Garden – “I Knew I Loved You”\n\nDate: Jan. 29, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nSavage Garden’s “I Knew I Loved You” might be the hardest song to rank on this list. Released in 1999, it’s hard to compare to the showier tracks from the late 2000s. But Savage Garden didn’t need all the fancy bells and whistles to craft a compelling love song. Broken down, “I Knew I Loved You” is poetry put to music with pickup lines that hold up to this day, something you can’t say about a lot of songs on this list.\n\n25. Nelly – “Hot in Herre”\n\nDate: June 29, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\nWith “Hot in Herre” Nelly didn’t so much rewrite the book on crafting a club anthem. He simply upped the ante in terms of quality. “Hot in Herre” makes its case as the dancefloor anthem of the year right from its opening line (“I was like/Good gracious, a** is bodacious”), while The Neptunes grace the St. Louis rapper with a slick beat perfect for his unique tone.\n\n24. Britney Spears – “3″\n\nDate: Oct. 24, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nYou have to wonder how the members of Peter, Paul & Mary feel about the legendary folk group being name-dropped in Britney Spears’ ode to threesomes. If they’re like the rest of us, they found themselves consumed by the pulsating hook and what may be the very best bridge on any pop song during the 2000s.\n\n23. Leona Lewis – “Bleeding Love”\n\nDate: April 5, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nOne of the more under-appreciated hits of the Aughts. If you were to map out the blueprint to a perfect pop song from the decade, “Bleeding Love” would be it. The credit goes to co-writers Jesse McCartney and Ryan Tedder (who also produced the song). Leona Lewis won the third version of the UK’s “The X Factor” in 2006. But “Bleeding Love” is no coronation song. It was Lewis’ impressive breakthrough into the United States with her massive voice on full display.\n\n22. Jay-Z feat. Alicia Keys – “Empire State of Mind”\n\nDate: Nov. 28, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nIf there was going to be an artist to create the next signature anthem for New York City, it was going to be Jay-Z, right? Fittingly, “Empire State of Mind” became Hov’s first No. 1 hit. It sounds huge, from the massive drums to Jay-Z’s pop-culture references to Alicia Keys’ soaring hook. It’s a song that begs you to sing along to it no matter where you’re actually from. And you’re happy to oblige.\n\n21. Christina Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Mýa and Pink – “Lady Marmalade”\n\nDate: June 2, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nAllow me to rank the performances on the 2001 remake of LaBelle’s classic “Lady Marmalade”:\n\n5. Missy Elliott – She produced this awesomeness along with Rockwilder. So, Missy can jump in at the end for some unnecessary ad-libs if she wants.\n\n4. Mya – The unenviable task of the opening verse with some vocal juggernauts to come. Mya holds her own.\n\n3. Pink – You knew Pink was gonna bring the attitude, delivering her rock-savvy runs throughout.\n\n2. Lil Kim – A rap verse wasn’t necessary. But how could we imagine the song without it now?\n\n1. Christina Aguilera – Um...who else was going to be No. 1? If everyone else was at a 7, Christina turns it up to a 10 for the win.\n\n20. Santana feat. The Product G&B – “Maria Maria”\n\nDate: April 8, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nTo this day I have no idea who The Product G&B was or what happened to them. But I do know this: They deliver one of the best vocal performances of the past 25 years on “Maria Maria.” The mesmerizing opening of the song is enough to give you chills and set up a date night fueled by expensive wine. Add in various guitar solos from Carlos Santana and “Maria Maria” doesn’t just remind you of a West Side Story. It will make you long for a particular era of excellent pop music.\n\n19. Gwen Stefani – “Hollaback Girl”\n\nDate: May 7, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“Hollaback Girl” was not the first single from Gwen Stefani’s solo debut “Love. Angel. Music. Baby.” So, when the song dropped in the context of the album, it was an absolute shock to the system. Stefani walks a fine line between wannabe rapper and swaggering pop star. But once The Neptunes’ synths and horns drop in, you don’t care. The easy comparison is Toni Basil’s 1982 song “Mickey” due to the similar marching beat. But, to be clear -- “Hollaback Girl” blows “Mickey” out of the water.\n\n18. Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell – “Drop It Like It’s Hot”\n\nDate: Dec. 11, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThe brilliance of The Neptunes – Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo – was the duo’s ability to shape a beat around any artist it collaborated with. Snoop Dogg had been around more than a decade. But it wasn’t until he teamed up with The Neptunes on “Drop It Like It’s Hot” that the rap legend scored his first No. 1 hit. The song’s massive bass and tongue clicks are infectious, suggesting a club anthem. But you could drop anything into the phrase and make it work: “When I get up to do the laundry...Drop it like it’s hot. Drop it like it’s hot.” “When I walk through the grocery aisle...Drop it like it’s hot. Drop it like it’s hot.” You get the point.\n\n17. Beyoncé – “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)”\n\nDate: Dec. 13, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nBeyonce has better songs than “Single Ladies.” But nothing (NOTHING) proved to be the pop-culture phenomenon that “Single Ladies” became. It wasn’t just the music – an endlessly catchy tune written by Terius “The-Dream” Nash and Christopher “Tricky Stewart.” It was the video, the dance moves and Kanye’s rude but accurate proclamation that Beyonce had created “one of the best videos of all time.” All of it made “Single Ladies” feel larger than life. And even if you got sick of it, you could always take comfort in the fact that the phrase “If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it” is a dead-on true statement.\n\n16. Lil Wayne feat. Static Major – “Lollipop”\n\nDate: May 3, 2008\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nAt this point in Lil Wayne’s career, it was nearly impossible to dispute his self-proclaimed status as the best rapper alive. But his biggest single wasn’t about that. Had it been rapped and sung over any other beat, “Lollipop” would be just another shallow rap song. But its synths (and the space in between them) feel like they’re from another world. There’s a never-ending WTF vibe to “Lollipop” and, boy, does Lil Wayne embrace it. The song never gets old because it never ceases to be weird.\n\n15. Lady Gaga – “Poker Face”\n\nDate: April 11, 2009\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Poker Face” screamed novelty. Sure, Lady Gaga had already charted a No. 1 hit with “Just Dance.” But “Poker Face” felt like the work of a one-hit-wonder who had stumbled upon an overly simplistic metaphor for the game of love. Of course, none of that wound up being true. Metaphors aside, “Poker Face” comes with a thrilling hook. As we’d come to find out over the years, Gaga had plenty more in her bag of tricks. “Poker Face” is an early example of her genius.\n\n14. 50 Cent – “In da Club”\n\nDate: March 8, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 9\n\nEverything about 50 Cent’s run to the top of the charts in the 2000s was perfect. He had the backstory to give him immediate street cred. He was co-signed by the greatest hip-hop producer of all time and the biggest rapper ever. And his first single on Eminem’s Shady Records, “Wanksta,” fulfilled the hype. Of course, “In da Club” was a whole other beast. Not only does the song feature, perhaps, Dr. Dre’s catchiest beat. But it underscores 50 Cent’s wit. He wasn’t the greatest lyricist. But long before Drake was dropping lines at the bottom of memes, Fiddy was the catchphrase king: “I’m into having sex/I ain’t into makin’ love.”\n\n13. Destiny’s Child – “Say My Name”\n\nDate: March 18, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nAs this list suggests, the 2000s was the decade of Beyonce (the 2010s probably was too). Consider it begins with Destiny’s Child conquering the charts before Beyonce would go on to spend a total of 36 weeks on top of the charts (second only to Usher). And it all begins with “Say My Name,” DC’s signature song that has a handful of moments you can’t get out of your head. Oh, and if you needed an indicator that Beyonce was about to be a solo star, consider she sings every verse on the song.\n\n12. Madonna – “Music”\n\nDate: Dec. 16, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nMadonna upended dance music trends a few times in her career. And she often did it near the start of a new decade. “Music” may be her most timeless contribution in pushing a new trend for the simple fact that it’s intentionally generic. The song can be shaped into any form, from a disco tune to a rap anthem, which Madonna has done in various live performances. If you name a song “Music,” it better be versatile. And Madonna’s sole No. 1 from the 2000s is just that.\n\n11. Kanye West feat. Jamie Foxx – “Gold Digger”\n\nDate: Sept. 17, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nIt was hard to imagine Kanye West topping anything on his debut album “The College Dropout.” Then “Gold Digger” hit in the summer of 2005 and consumed the music world. Kanye was truly a wealth of music knowledge, borrowing a hook from Ray Charles (sung perfectly by Jamie Foxx) with drums and synths that scream peak 1970s soul. Kanye also upped his rap game with some of the best bars of his career. Now, let me hear that back!\n\n10. NSYNC – “It’s Gonna Be Me”\n\nDate: July 29, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThanks to the way Justin Timberlake sings the hook on “It’s Gonna Be Me,” the song gets some serious attention every May. But the song’s legendary status was already cemented at the start of the 21st century. It’s NSYNC’s only ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (which is hard to believe). It comes equipped with a ton of production bells and whistles and a full-on five-part harmony on the chorus. “It’s Gonna Be Me” is truly the finest showcase of NSYNC as a pop juggernaut.\n\n9. Aaliyah – “Try Again”\n\nDate: June 17, 2000\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFor as much as “Try Again” feels like an extension of the sound Timbaland established on Aaliyah’s “Are You That Somebody,” the single from the “Romeo Must Die” soundtrack was ahead of its time. Scroll up and down this list and find any hip-hop-influenced song driven by low-fi electronic chords (whether produced by Timbaland or a copycat) and you can trace it back to “Try Again.” Timbaland would ride this success later on in the decade with Justin Timberlake and a host of others. It’s mind-boggling to think “Try Again” came out over 20 years ago.\n\n8. Outkast – “Hey Ya!”\n\nDate: Dec. 13, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 9\n\n“Hey Ya!” accomplished a rare feat. It managed to sound like it fully belonged on mainstream radio while sounding unlike anything that had ever existed there. You can find its origins in funk and power-pop. Yet, there are so many influences in the works that “Hey Ya!” seems to exist in its own genre. The term “instant classic” often gets overused. But “Hey Ya!” deserves it.\n\n7. Mariah Carey – “We Belong Together”\n\nDate: June 4, 2005\n\nWeeks on top: 14\n\nBy 2005, it had been a little while since Mariah Carey released a truly great song (Six years to be exact). Some cynics had written her off entirely. But Mariah screamed “Not so fast!” with “We Belong Together,” a tour de force of a comeback single. As history has shown, when Mariah hits her mark, no one else gets a shot at the top of the charts. “We Belong Together” sat there for 14 week. Carey has several brilliant ballads in her discography., But “We Belong Together” may be the most universally enjoyable.\n\n6. Eminem – “Lose Yourself”\n\nDate: Nov. 9, 2002\n\nWeeks on top: 12\n\n“Lose Yourself” isn’t just about “8 Mile,” its main character or Eminem (who plays the main character who is based on himself). It’s about hip hop. I’m not sure any single song has ever summed up what a genre means more than “Lose Yourself.” It’s right there in the lyrics, as well as Eminem’s urgent flow that makes “Lose Yourself” a modern-day “Eye of the Tiger.” It’s also the only song on this list that has both a Grammy and an Oscar. Not bad, B-Rabbit. Not bad.\n\n5. Usher feat. Lil Jon and Ludacris – “Yeah!”\n\nDate: Feb. 8, 2004\n\nWeeks on top: 12\n\nYou could make the case (rather easily) that no one had a better run in the 2000s than Usher. Not only was “Confessions” one of the top-selling albums of the decade. But no one had more No. 1 hits than Usher, who gave us seven. The biggest of the bunch was the club anthem to end all 2000s club anthems “Yeah!” Was Usher riding the coattails of the crunk explosion? Sure. But “Yeah!” has more than outlived the trend. Usher was just better than everyone else and he only needed one emphatic word to prove it.\n\n4. Outkast – “Ms. Jackson”\n\nDate: Feb. 17, 2001\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nYou have to forgive mainstream music fans for thinking “Ms. Jackson” was Outkast’s debut (Yes, people thought that). The Atlanta duo had dropped three classic albums in the 1990s. But “Ms. Jackson” was, by far, the catchiest thing the group had ever done. Anyone familiar with Big Boi and Andre 3000′s work knew the sky was the limit. But “Ms. Jackson” was next level as an ode to baby mamas with a killer hook (“I am fo reeeeaaaal!”) that you couldn’t walk through the halls of your classroom or office without hearing.\n\n3. Justin Timberlake feat. T.I. - “My Love”\n\nDate: Nov. 11, 2006\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nHad Justin Timberlake and Timbaland stopped at “SexyBack,” their impact on 21st century pop music would already have been secured. But they didn’t stop there. Timbaland’s influential blend of R&B, hip hop and electronic music reaches its peak here on “My Love” thanks to dense layers of production that ooze sex appeal. JT drives the latter home with his smooth falsetto, building to a perfect guest appearance from T.I. who gets away with the line “They call me candle guy/Simply ‘cause I am on fire” because by that point, there was no resisting the magic of “My Love.”\n\n2. Beyoncé feat. Jay-Z – “Crazy in Love”\n\nDate: July 12, 2003\n\nWeeks on top: 8\n\nBeyonce’s post-Destiny’s Child success was all but predetermined. Still, there was the need to blow up her goody-goody image. Enter “Crazy in Love,” a song with just enough attitude to rebrand Beyonce while not alienating Destiny’s Child fans in the least. Of course, it helps that “Crazy in Love” is a fantastic pop song with a mind-blowing sample of The Chi-Lites’s 1970 “Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)” and no less than three unshakable hooks. Oh, and that Jay-Z first...Yep, Jay and Bey were a match made in heaven right from the start.\n\n1. Rihanna feat. Jay-Z – “Umbrella”\n\nDate: June 9, 2007\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\n“Umbrella” was offered to a couple of major stars (Britney Spears and Mary J. Blige) before it landed in Rihanna’s lap. It’s not hard to imagine someone else having a hit with the song. But Rihanna is the one who made it perfect.\n\n“Umbrella” is, by no means, simple. It’s built around a traditional rock structure as a power ballad masquerading as an R&B song. And while its demo had been floated around, the lyrical structure is perfectly suited for Rihanna’s syllable heavy delivery. On top of that, she gives the song just enough attitude to make all the love declarations carry serious weight.\n\nInterestingly enough, the top two tracks on this list both feature Jay-Z. But unlike Beyonce’s “Crazy In Love,” Jay-Z phones it in a bit on “Umbrella.” He’s just the guy setting the table for Rihanna. He’s calm before the storm if you will and Rihanna’s talent is really what’s rains down on us (multiple puns intended)."
