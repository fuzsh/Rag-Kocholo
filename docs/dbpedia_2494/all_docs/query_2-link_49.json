        "text": "Miley's lead single off her eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks. The breakup anthem serves as a reminder that we can woo ourselves, whether we buy ourselves flowers or talk to ourselves for hours.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I can love me better than you can\"\n\nDestiny's Child served us with plenty of female empowerment bops over the years, but this one has to be the best.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I'm the survivor / I'm gonna make it / I will survive / Keep on survivin'\"\n\nIf you just went through a breakup, blast Sabrina's song \"Sue Me\" to remind yourself who you are.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"That's my shape, I made the shadow / That's my name, don't wear it out though / Feelin' myself can't be illegal\"\n\nBritney Spears let it be known that her loneliness wasn't killing her anymore in this powerhouse anthem about getting through tough times.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Stronger than yesterday / Ain't nothing but my way\"\n\nFifth Harmony is another girl group that brought on tons of girl boss bangers. If you're on the fence about a hard decision, \"That's My Girl\" will have you feeling better in no time.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"You've been down before / You've been hurt before / You got up before / You'll be good to go, good to go\"\n\nNo matter what you're going through, remember you'll be alright. Throw on Lizzo's \"About Damn Time\" if you need a reminder.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Oh, I've been so down and under pressure / I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah / Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be / Uh, b*tch, I might be better\"\n\nYou're going to want to blast this one at full volume while you drive around with your besties.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I don't need a man to be holding me too tight\"\n\nFake German lyrics aside, this Gaga deep cut is all about finding the power within yourself to live the life you want without worrying about what other people think of you.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"If you're a strong female, you don't need permission\"\n\nLady Gaga's iconic power ballad is an instant confidence boost.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes / I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way / Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set / I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way (born this way)\"\n\nTrust us, you'll want to play Chaka Khan's debut solo single on repeat, all night long.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I'm every woman / It's all in me / Anything you want done baby / I do it naturally I'm every woman / It's all in me / I can read your thoughts right now / Every one from A to Z\"\n\nFor those days where you need an extra boost of inspiration, or you just want to celebrate being you, this Alicia Keys' anthem is a must.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Everybody stares as she goes by / 'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes / Watch her as she's lighting up the night / Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl / And it's a lonely world / But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby\"\n\nJust ended a relationship â€” or situationship? This song from TLC should be at the top of your break-up playlist.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"No, I don't want no scrub / A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me / Hangin' out the passenger side / Of his best friend's ride / Trying to holla at me\"\n\nNatasha Bedingfield's 2004 single remains a universal favorite for a reason. Listening to this catchy tune puts an instant smile on your face.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"No one else can feel it for you / Only you can let it in / No one else, no one else / Can speak the words on your lips / Drench yourself in words unspoken / Live your life with arms wide open / Today is where your book begins / The rest is still unwritten\"\n\nThe second verse of this song alone will make you embrace your womanhood.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"They wanna pit us against each other when we succeedin' for no reason\"\n\nYou are in control of your life and your destiny, and like Christina Aguilera belts out, you are a fighter.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Makes me that much stronger / Makes me work a little bit harder / It makes me that much wiser / So thanks for making me a fighter / Made me learn a little bit faster / Made my skin a little bit thicker / Makes me that much smarter / So thanks for making me a fighter\"\n\nSelf-love is the best love, just ask Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (hey) / Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else (I love me) / Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else / Anytime, day or night.\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion helped us all embrace and reclaim our bitchiness with this bop.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"I'd rather be a B.I.T.C.H. / 'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway\"\n\nTaylor Swift shines a big light on the double standards between men and women in this song from her album Lover.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Wondering if I'd get there quicker / If I was a man / And I'm so sick of them coming at me again / 'Cause if I was a man / Then I'd be the man\"\n\nBreakups are hard, but they're new beginnings in disguise. Kick start your fresh start with encouragement from Little Mix.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"Guess I should say thank you / For the 'hate yous' and the tattoos / Oh baby, I'm cool by the way / Ain't sure I loved you anyway / Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah\"\n\nAll that matters is that you love you despite what anyone says.\n\nMost empowering lyric: \"But who are you to judge / When you're a diamond in the rough / I'm sure you got some things / You'd like to change about yourself / But when it comes to me / I wouldn't want to be anybody else\""
