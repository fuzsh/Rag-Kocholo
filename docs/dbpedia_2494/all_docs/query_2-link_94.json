So get your chocolate boxes, flowers, balloons, and dinner reservations ready because we're about to talk about the best of the best rap songs about love. By the way, this list is no particular order.\n\nRELATED: Rapper Yung Gravy Partners With Jimmy John to Pick the Sweetest \"MILF\"\n\nTo kick off our list, we've got a song from Rod Wave, who's got the perfect voice for a song about love. \"Girl of My Dreams\" is a banger that means more and more, the deeper you dive into the lyrics.\n\nThis trippy, yet heartfelt A$AP Rocky song is a great vibe to listen to - especially if you've got a special someone to share the experience with.\n\nDrake is the poster child for rap songs about love, and who could possibly forget this particular anthem from the Canadian superstar. \"Best I Ever Had\" is one of the best songs on this list, and was one of Drake's first standout songs.\n\nLL Cool J is a hip-hop legend, and for good reason. He was one of the founding fathers of the genre, and also scored plenty of hits, including his rap love jam \"I Need Love.\"\n\nPop Smoke really made his mark in his time here on Earth, leaving fans with plenty to remember him by. \"What You Know Bout Love\" is yet another example of his dynamic rapping ability, and is well worth a few listens on Valentine's Day.\n\nWhen Future and Drake link up, you already know something special is in the works, but add Tems to the mix, and it's a whole new level of music prowess. \"Wait For U\" is easily one of our favorites from 2022.\n\nFabolous made a memorable song with \"Can't Let You Go,\" and it's still worth streaming to this day. Don't believe us? Take a listen for yourself, and try to tell us different.\n\nErykah Badu and Common are two rap legends respectively, and are even more fire as a unit. \"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip Hop)\" is some of the best from either catalog, which is truly saying a lot.\n\nIn one of two appearances from Kendrick Lamar on this list, he links with Zacari for his song \"LOVE.\" This is a timeless track that surely deserves a spot on anyone's Valentine's Day playlist.\n\nFuture has made yet another appearance on our list with his hit \"Turn On The Lights,\" which is one of many classics from him. He rarely is one to talk about love, but this one in particular is special.\n\nLil Wayne belongs in the rap hall of fame, and his song \"How To Love\" is one of his best ever. It goes without saying that it deserves a spot on this Valentine's Day list, but you knew that already.\n\nIn Kendrick Lamar's second appearance on this list, and Travis Scott's first, we have \"Goosebumps,\" their collaboration from way back in 2016. It really gives you exactly what the title says, without fail.\n\nTupac is another artist on this list with a rightful legacy in the hip-hop world. \"Do for Love\" is one of his best, and is yet another song that's one of the best on this list.\n\nJay-Z and Beyonc√© are arguably the most iconic couple in hip-hop, and \"03 Bonnie & Clyde\" is all the proof you need to know that's true. Talk about love and hip-hop. This song is absolutely timeless.\n\nNicki Minaj just doesn't miss, and \"Your Love\" is yet another shining example of this notion. Talk about the perfect song for the perfect Valentine's Day.\n\nWhile this list is packed with rap bangers about love, \"21 Questions\" might actually be the best - or at least top 3. This 50 Cent and Nate Dogg collaboration is surely hard to top.\n\n\"Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on.\" Well, put you on we shall. This banger from A Tribe Called Quest is one of their best, and also happens to be a love song well worth your attention on February 14th.\n\nWho knew Common had such an elite love song-making ability? \"The Light\" is exactly what we're talking about; he really goes off lyrically in typical Common fashion.\n\nWho can forget this Valentine's Day staple? \"Beautiful\" is some of the very best from Snoop Dogg and Pharrell, and also happens to be one of the best rap songs to play for the one you love the most.\n\nMethod Man and Mary J. Blige scored one of the best rap love songs of all-time with their song, \"I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need to Get By.\" What a classic.\n\nTyler, the Creator and Kali Uchis are both incredible artists in their own right, but together they are something else. \"See You Again\" is exactly what we mean by that."
