The guys are also wearing jean jackets unbuttoned all the way to the bottom showing their bodies. In another scene, the guys put on a show outside wearing matching red and black leather jackets. There are also scenes of Lil' Fizz sitting down singing the chorus with recording artist Jhen√© (who at the time was marketed as his cousin and makes a cameo as his girlfriend), while they are sitting down on the bleachers with rottweilers. TG4, IMx and actress Kat Graham make cameos as well.\n\nWeekly charts[]\n\nChart (2002) Peak\n\nposition US Billboard Hot 100[2] 73 US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)[3] 19\n\nReferences[]\n\nTemplate:B2K"
