Their fast rise to the top of the pop heap is also attested to by the advance single \"Bump, Bump, Bump,\" which was produced, written, and arranged by R. Kelly and which is co-billed to rapper P.

In the hands of their many writers and producers, B2K covers the usual concerns of male hip-hop music: lust (\"Bump, Bump, Bump\"); undying love (\"One Kiss\"); apology (\"Sleepin'\"); and, sung with the greatest feeling, accusations that the woman addressed is only interested in money (\"Would You Be Here\"). The writers are not shy about making use of the group's increased stature, notably on \"Everything,\" in which one of the singers assures a woman that he still loves her even though he is now a big star, and he really wants to spend time with her, or at least talk to her on his cell phone, in between concerts and video shoots.
