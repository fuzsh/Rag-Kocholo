Whether it’s “hey, baby what’s your sign” or “shawty, what ya name is,” guys have proven time and time again that when it comes to picking up women, some could use a little help.\n\nFor those who lack a way with words, looking to musicians might be the move. Flip through for some of the best and worst, corniest and even ridiculous pick-up lines used in hip-hop & R&B songs.\n\n— Shannon Powell\n\n“Say you got a man/Well the hell with him too/\n\nThe seats is seashell, the whip is sea blue, and you can swim through.”\n\n“Wonder Woman” x Trey Songz\n\nI got it, you name it it’s all paid for: big castle on the seashore, with the Willy Wonka décor.

Nicki Minaj, Drake and Mack Maine\n\n“They should arrest you, or whoever dressed you/Ain’t gon’ stress you but I’mma let you know/Girl, you be killin’ ’em.”\n\n“You Be Killin ‘Em” x Fabulous\n\n“I saw you from across the room/And I gotta admit that you got my attention/You’re making me wanna say “Yo.”\n\n“Yo (Excuse Me Miss)” x Chris Brown\n\n“You’re so contagious, I can’t take it, have my baby, let’s just make it/Excuse me. What’s your name?”\n\n“Excuse Me Miss” x Jay Z ft. Pharrell\n\n“So I clap for her/She deserves an applause/Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton/Shawty, where your baton, racing through my mind like…”\n\n“Lotus Flower Bomb” x Wale ft. Miguel\n\n“Stacks on deck/Patrón on ice/We can pop bottles all night/Baby, you can have whatever you like.”\n\n“Whatever You Like” x T.I.\n\n“My eyes have seen nothin’ like you/Wanna bite you/Not tryna be disrespectful, but I just want to get you to just back into it and let it touch.”\n\n“Touch” x Omarion\n\n“The square root of 69 is ate something, right? ‘Cause I’ve been tryna work it out.”\n\n“What’s My Name” x Rihanna ft.

Bruno Mars\n\n“Yo Kwe, she don’t believe me, please pick up the line/She’s gonna think that I’m lying/Just spit a couple of lines/Then maybe I’ll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high.”\n\n“Get ‘Em High” x Kanye West ft. Talib Kweli\n\n“I’ll be your groupie, baby, ‘cause you are my superstar/I’m your number one fan, give me your autograph.
