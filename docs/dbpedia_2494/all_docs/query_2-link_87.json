        "text": "Academia and popular music might not seem the most obvious bedfellows, but as this list proves, some of the most prestigious higher education systems in the world have influenced some very well known (and some not so well known) singers and songwriters.\n\nWe’ve been searching through lyrics, trying to find songs that mention specific universities by name. Can you think of any that do not feature on our list? Please feel free to add them in the comments section below, or tweet Times Higher Education using the hashtag #HElyrics.\n\nYou can also follow Times Higher Education on YouTube and view all of the songs listed here on our #HElyrics playlist.\n\nParis Sorbonne University\n\nThe University of Paris Sorbonne was immortalised in pop history by Peter Sarstedt in his 1969 number one hit, Where Do You Go To (My Lovely).\n\nThe song is a rags to riches story of a girl from Italy who climbs the social ladder, becoming part of Paris jet-set - earning qualifications from the Sorbonne en route.\n\nIt topped the UK charts for six weeks, and has an incredibly catchy melody that is about to get inside your head, yes it is…\n\nThe lyric:\n\nI’ve seen all your qualifications\n\nYou got from the Sorbonne\n\nAnd the painting you stole from Picasso\n\nYour loveliness goes on and on, yes it does\n\nCentral St Martin’s College of Art and Design\n\nIt was the song Common People that catapulted Jarvis Cocker’s Pulp to Brit-Pop stardom in 1995 (yes - this song is 19 years old, and technically old enough to be attending university itself).\n\nThe song tells the story of a girl from Greece who wants to “live like common people”, and its opening lyric relates to Cocker’s alma mater, Central St Martin’s College, the University of the Arts.\n\nIt reached number 2 in the UK charts.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nShe came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge\n\nShe studied sculpture at Saint Martin’s College\n\nThat’s where I caught her eye\n\nThe University of Massachusetts\n\nAmerican alternative rockers Pixies released their fourth album, Trompe Le Monde, in 1991.\n\nIts sixth track, U Mass, is an expletive-ridden 3-minute song thought to be about college apathy, and making reference to the University of Massachusetts.\n\nTwo of the band’s members, Joey Santiago and Black Francis, met while studying at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nOh kiss my ass oh let it rock, of the April birds and the May bee\n\nOh baby University of Massachusetts, please\n\nAnd here’s the last five\n\nIt’s educational, it’s educational\n\nIt’s educational, it’s educational\n\nIt’s educational\n\nHarvard University\n\nSatirical comedy singer-songwriter Tom Lehrer graduated from and lectured at Harvard University in the mid-20th century, and his alma mater makes it into two of his most well-known songs.\n\nEveryone’s favourite chemistry study-aid The Elements, which details the 1959 periodic table to the tune of I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General from the musical The Pirates of Penzance, mentions the prestigious US institution, as does Lehrer’s mock college song Fight Fiercely Harvard.\n\nThe lyrics:\n\nThe Elements\n\nThere’s sulphur, californium and fermium, berkelium\n\nAnd also mendelevium, einsteinium and nobelium\n\nAnd argon, krypton, neon, radon, xenon, zinc and rhodium\n\nAnd chlorine, carbon, cobalt, copper\n\nTungsten, tin and sodium\n\nThese are the only ones of which the news has come to Harvard\n\nAnd there may be many others, but they haven’t been discovered\n\nFight Fiercely Harvard\n\nFight fiercely, Harvard, Fight, fight, fight!\n\nDemonstrate to them our skill\n\nAlbeit they possess the might\n\nNonetheless we have the will\n\nYale University (and Harvard, again)\n\nAmerican punk band Dropkick Murphys’ fourth album, Blackout, closes with the charmingly titled Kiss Me I’m Shitfaced. It is a sweet little number that details some of the fun that one can have as a guitarist in a successful band.\n\n“I play one mean guitar and then score at the bar, there’s a line of chicks waiting for their chance,” the lyrics proclaim - before going on to list a number of unlikely accomplishments, including the acquisition of degrees from two of the most prestigious Ivy League institutions.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nI can bench press a car, I’m an ex-football star\n\nWith degrees from both Harvard and Yale\n\nGirls just can’t keep up, I’m a real love machine\n\nI’ve had far better sex while in jail\n\nSwarthmore College\n\nA highly selective liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, Swarthmore College briefly caught the attention of Cass Elliot, also known as Mama Cass from vocal harmony group the Mamas and the Papas.\n\nHowever, if you believe the band’s 1967 song, Creeque Alley, the bright lights of New York were just too tempting.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nWhen Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore\n\nBut she changed her mind one day\n\nStandin’ on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike\n\n“Take me to New York right away”\n\nUniversity of Birmingham\n\nWhile the opening track of The Fall’s 1992 album Code: Selfish does not mention the university by name, it is called Birmingham School Of Business School, which is pretty close.\n\nThe Birmingham Business School is part of the University of Birmingham, and it is not unreasonable to speculate that this is the institution that Mark E Smith et al had in mind when they penned the track.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nWeave a web so magnificent, disguise in the art of conceit\n\nGive a very firm handshake, and take the bastards for everything that they rate\n\nThe Birmingham Business School of business school\n\nThe College of William and Mary (Virginia) / Bard College (New York)\n\nSteely Dan’s 1973 album, Countdown to Ecstasy, made the Billboard top 40, and featured the single My Old School.\n\nThe lyrics refer to “William and Mary”, a university in Virginia, but it is actually thought to be about Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson in New York - sometimes referred to as “the William and Mary of the North”.\n\nThe song was inspired by a police raid at the university in 1969, in which lead singer Donald Fagen and his then girlfriend were arrested.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nI remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes\n\nWhen you put me on the Wolverine\n\nUp to Annandale\n\nIt was still September when your daddy was quite surprised\n\nTo find you with the working girls\n\nIn the county jail\n\nI was smoking with the boys upstairs\n\nWhen I heard about the whole affair\n\nI said oh no - William and Mary won’t do\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley / Columbia University\n\nThe back catalogue of New York rockers Vampire Weekend is littered with references to university life.\n\nStep, a song on the band’s 2013 album Modern Vampires of the City, mentions a girl “in Berkeley”, while the song California English, from the 2010 Contra album, mentions the “Hapa Club”.\n\nAccording to WikiCU, a user-created online encyclopaedia of all things Colombia, the Hapa Club is “a cultural club for students of partial Asian ethnicity” at the university.\n\nThe lyrics:\n\nStep\n\nYour girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader\n\nMine was entombed within boombox and walkman\n\nI was a hoarder but girl that was back then\n\nCalifornia English\n\nFunny how that little college girl called language corrupt\n\nFunny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n\nOn the afternoon of 1 August 1966, 15 people were shot and killed by former US Marine Charles Whitman on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The previous night, Whitman had also murdered his wife and mother.\n\nThe story was captured in country singer Kinky Friedman’s song The Ballad of Charles Whitman, which makes reference to the “tower” of the main university building, from where most of the victims were shot.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nHe was sitting up there for more than an hour,\n\nWay up there on the Texas tower\n\nShooting from the twenty-seventh floor\n\nThe London School of Economics\n\nAlthough not household names, Swedish indie-pop outfit Acid House Kings are known to many at one London university thanks to their 2005 album Sing Along With The Acid House Kings, which featured the song London School of Economics.\n\nThe track is a two minute twee pop nostalgia trip, seemingly about a relationship that faded after a girl went off to study at the LSE. If you were expecting acid house, this one is not for you.\n\nIn addition, David Bowie mentions an institution with a similar name in his 1967 ditty The Laughing Gnome - the London School of Ecognomeics. Its exact location, however, is unknown.\n\nThe lyrics:\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nDon’t forget that summer dress\n\nYou know, the one you wore\n\nWhen you returned from\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nThe Laughing Gnome\n\nDidn’t they teach you to get your hair cut at school?\n\nYou look like a rolling gnome\n\nNo, not at the London School of Ecognomeics\n\nUniversity of Florida\n\nYou might not think you know much about American R&amp;B producer Terius “The-Dream” Nash, but you may well have heard some of the hit songs that he has co-written, which include Umbrella by Rihanna, Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It) by Beyoncé and the remarkable Baby by Justin Bieber.\n\nIt is his 2009 solo album Love King that takes centre stage here, and in particular its closing track Florida University.\n\nThe North Carolina-born singer appears to have spotted that if you say the initials of the university out loud, it sounds a bit rude.\n\nThe lyric:\n\nI was the realest thing you’ve ever known\n\nI couldn’t wait to say I told you so\n\nSo forget you ever heard of me\n\nthis is short for Florida University\n\nF.U. (x7)\n\nFlorida University\n\nF.U. (x7)"
