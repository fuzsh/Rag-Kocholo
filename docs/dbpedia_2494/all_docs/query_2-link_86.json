Whether you’re parting ways with the love of your life, saying good-bye to a short-lived Tinder fling, or even watching your ex move on to the next one, no one should ever be left to grieve alone. While friends and family can help you get over your sadness, they’re not always readily available as a shoulder to cry on.\n\nWhen people aren’t there physically to support you, you can turn to the one thing that never disappoints: music. Not only does music have healing powers, but there’s nothing more reliable to get through you those dark times. And if you’re trying to get your ex out of your life once and for all, Beyoncé says it best: “To the left, to the left, everything you own in a box to the left.”\n\nWhile rap is notorious for showing off gold chains, fancy cars, and bands of cash, it also has a soft side. We’re talking “Marvin’s Room” soft. While some songs may set the mood, others are there to help you embrace your sorrows dead on. : the best songs are fueled by heartbreak.\n\nThe best part is, there’s a record for each stage of the breakup. From the evenings spent alone wondering what could have been, to the evenings spent wilding at the club as proof that you’re “over it,” there’s a track for each phase of your heartbreak, ready to help you through. We all heard Cardi B’s reaction when rumors of Offset cheating surfaced: “Be Careful” serves as the perfect warning to your future lover.\n\nOnce you move into the anger phase, “IDFWU” by Big Sean and E-40 never disappoints, either. What better way to get over someone than by telling them off? Whether you’re sulking or turning the other cheek, check out our list of best hip-hop breakup songs to help get you through the tough times.\n\nKanye West “Heartless” (2008)\n\nFor the early stages, when you’re playing the blame game, and questioning how all of this could have happened; attempt to find the answers with Kanye.\n\nChildish Gambino “Heartbeat” (2011)\n\nThis one is for realizing you and your partner aren’t good for each other—and wanting them anyway.\n\nJ.
