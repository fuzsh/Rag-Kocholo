        "text": "“N*****, why you babysittin’ only two or three shots? / I’ma show you how to turn it up a notch / First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it.”\n\n—”Swimming Pools (Drank)” by Kendrick Lamar\n\nIn this song, Kendrick Lamar uses the metaphor of a swimming pool full of liquor to explore the culture of drinking and its effects.\n\n“Percocets, molly, percocets.”\n\n—”Mask Off” by Future\n\nThis song serves as a stark reminder of the explicit content and potential influence on impressionable minds.\n\n“Smoke weed every day.”\n\n—”The Next Episode” by Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, and Nate Dogg\n\nUpdated and Fact-Checked May 2024 by: Christine Zambos, LMFT\n\nUpdates list:\n\nUpdated data regarding teen behavior\n\nUpdated Parents’ Strategies\n\nMusic is a powerful influence that shapes culture, political movements and addresses issues within society. Just like the kind of content we read, or movies we watch, music has the power to influence our perspectives about the world and behaviors in everyday life.\n\nHip-hop in particular has roots in a strong cultural movement originating from U.S. urban black culture. It has become one of the most popular genres around the globe, and is particularly popular among teens.\n\nIt draws people in with it´s deep rhythms, emotional intensity and the power of voicing issues within politics, culture and society.\n\nHip-hop serves as a method of self-expression and a way to challenge societal power. However, as much as hip-hop serves as a platform for self-expression and social commentary, it has also raised concerns regarding its role in influencing teen behavioral problems and substance abuse.\n\nInfluence of Music on Teen Culture\n\nOver the past decades there is no denying the influence of music on teen culture. It has influenced lifestyle, fashion and for some acts as a form of identity.\n\nLyrics and the lifestyle of artists are the two main factors that influence young audiences in music. Just as rock and roll did with youth in the 1960´s and 70´s.\n\nThe teenage years are a critical stage of development, making them particularly open to influence from the kind of content consumed. Some studies have shown that exposure to drug glorification in music can influence teens’ perceptions of drug use, making it appear more common, acceptable and without consequence.\n\nThis normalization has posed a large risk, influencing experimentation, addiction, and other behavioral problems found in society. Drug use during teenage years can stunt brain development, leading to lower academic performance, relationship issues and even problems with the legal system.\n\nThe Power of Lyrics\n\nThe relationship between rap lyrics and substance abuse has grown over the past decades. And often been ignored by mainstream narratives as an outdated point of view.\n\nGlamorization of Negative Behaviors\n\nHip-hop draws teens in with it´s unfiltered lyrics that often discuss the raw and harsh reality of life, particularly on the streets—making it appealing to teens growing up in already tough environments.\n\nArtists use their music as a canvas to paint the realities of their lives, including, at times, their experiences with drug use. Sometimes this can turn into a portrayal that glamorizes drug use by presenting drug abuse as a symbol of rebellion, success or wealth.\n\nThis is not the intention of most artists, often just trying to connect with their listeners through shared experiences. But for teens, who are still developing their views and place in the world, it can be misleading.\n\nHow Music is Connected to Teen Behavior\n\nAlthough complex, there is a large connection between the music teens listen to and their perspectives on the world which can influence their behaviors. Research in social and music psychology has shown the correlation between various kinds of music and patterns of behavior among youth.\n\nIf a teen only listens to music with extremely aggressive or violent lyrics, they may internalize these lyrics and lead to similar behaviors. On the flip side, songs with positive messages can empower and inspire them to be better in their daily lives.\n\nLyrics that constantly speak of drug and alcohol use may make it seem as the “norm” in adulthood. This can potentially lead to higher levels of experimentation among teenagers.\n\nWhat Can Parents Do?\n\nParents often find themselves in a difficult situation when putting limits on the content their teenager consumes. They want to understandably protect their teens and promote positive behaviors while still respecting their freedom of art and music choices.\n\nOpen Conversations\n\nDeveloping a healthy relationship with your teen where you can have open, honest and vulnerable conversations is key to discussing their music choices and the potential influence on their lives.\n\nMany parents condemn hip-hop music immediately, making their opinion irrelevant to their teens. Rather than trying to restrict these topics for your teen to listen to, explore them with your teen instead. Initiate conversations with teens surrounding these topics and themes.\n\nParents should actively listen to their teens and understand why their teens are drawn into the preferences of music they have. Parents should also take initiative to learn more about the background of the hip-hop artists their teens are listening to.\n\nThis can provide helpful context when having conversations with your teens. It also may educate them about some of their favorite artists.\n\nModel Positive Behavior\n\nMany teens that embody the behaviors they hear in these kinds of lyrics often come from harsh environments themselves and do not have positive role modeling in their life. Parents providing positive role modeling can help their teens enjoy music with explicit lyrics, while preventing them from embodying them in their daily lives.\n\nReality vs. Art\n\nTeaching your teens from a young age that art, music, movies, content and social media doesn’t always need to reflect their own lives is important. Teaching discernment between what is acceptable in the real world vs what is put out for artistic expression can be helpful.\n\nFor example children and adults may play violent video games, but know that these kinds of behaviors can´t be replicated.\n\nSet Boundaries\n\nAs with any kinds of content your teen consumes, a balance between personal choice and setting boundaries is important. Rather than banning your teen from listening to music with harsh lyrics, consider suggesting they explore other artists and have a more diverse taste in music.\n\nFind out what makes your teens enjoy the kind of music they do. If it is rhythm and beats then encourage them to find other artists or genres that provide those. If it is lyrics, find out what your teen is inspired by or relates to.\n\nThese balanced boundaries allow teens to have freedom over their music choices, while still understanding the impact it could have on their thoughts, perceptions and behaviors.\n\nAs with all forms of media exposure, the first step is by starting an open conversation with them.\n\nIf you have a teen who is suffering from a substance abuse disorder, reach out to our compassionate team at Clearfork Academy.\n\nResources\n\nFor parents seeking resources to help them navigate their teens’ exposure to hip-hop culture, especially regarding themes of substance use, there are several informative websites and programs available:\n\nH.Y.P.E. (Helping Young People Through Hip Hop Empowerment): This is a 12-session group therapy program. Mental health issues affecting Black boys and young men can now be addressed with H.Y.P.E., a Hip Hop Therapy program specifically designed for the young warriors of Hip Hop culture that uses hip-hop music to engage teens in identifying and changing disruptive patterns.\n\nIt aims to encourage youth to think critically and foster a sense of hopefulness. The program has shown promise in helping teens set better life goals and gain control over their lives."
