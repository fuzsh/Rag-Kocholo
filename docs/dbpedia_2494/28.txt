I've got everything I want in my life except a girlfriend Just copped a Bentley and it's parked in my garage A two o'clock appointment made for my massage And everywhere we go they know just who we are There they go it's them ghetto superstars The latest throw backs and the ones on my feet Get off the Benz and them I'm off up in the Jeep Takin flicks with chicks that look like 'Licia Keys All of that I'm still missin' one thing A Girlfriend, Girlfriend (Everything I've wanted) I need a girlfriend, girlfriend (And everything I've) A girlfriend, girlfriend (Would you be my...?) Would you be my girlfriend, Girlfriend We hit the mall buyin' up all the Nike suits I'm being pampered while I'm chilling by the pool From the show to the limo to the club Hands in the air showin' nothin' but some love Got plenty clothes, plenty ice plenty cash A pretty swope plenty abs plenty shhh I got every single thing that I need Except for a main squeeze (I need a) A Girlfriend, Girlfriend (Girlfriend) I need a girlfriend, girlfriend (I need, I need) A girlfriend, girlfriend (Would you be my?)
