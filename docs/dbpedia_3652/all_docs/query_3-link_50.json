        "text": "Bernard Cribbins, OBE was in three 'Carry On's'; 'Carry On Jack' (1963), 'Carry On Spying' (1964), & 'Carry On Columbus' (1992). He is a well loved character actor, voice-over artist & musical comedian with a career spanning over seventy years.\n\nBorn in Derker, Oldham, Lancashire, Cribbins served an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. In 1947, he interrupted his apprenticeship to undertake national service with the Parachute Regiment in Aldershot & in British-administered Mandatory Palestine.\n\nBernard has a firm & loyal fanbase due to his work spanning various hit shows and films such as 'The Wombles', 'Doctor Who', 'The Railway Children' and the 'Carry On' films to name a few.\n\nHe received an OBE in the 2011 Birthday Honours for his services to drama.\n\nIn early 2018 I caught up with Bernie to chat about his memories & time working on the 'Carry On' films & with the 'Carry On' team.\n\nCP: Do you have any special memories of the Carry On team?\n\nBC: Sid was a lovely man. I didn’t work with him on a ‘Carry On’ but we did work together. Lovely man. Kenny Williams was the biggest show off ever! He always had to be the centre of attention. I warned Barbara about him on her first day on ‘Spying’. I said, ‘watch Kenny, he loves to have a dig’. Of course, he did and the now famous story of her standing up to him whilst he had ‘Fenella Fielding’s minge hair’ around his mouth is well known!\n\nCP: What was it like to work on a ‘Carry On’?\n\nBC: It was very intensive work. There was no time to rehearse and it was all a very basic set up. Normally two takes and that was your lot. It was very ‘factory’ orientated. I remember on ‘Jack’ I was doing a scene as ‘Midshipman Poop-Decker’ and it was with Cecil Parker as the Sealord. I said to Gerry (the director), can I just look back and smile at him at that point? Gerry replied ‘No, as soon as your hand is on the door handle I’ve cut and moved onto the next scene of you coming out of the door’. That is what it was like.\n\nCP: It is the 30th anniversary this year (2018) of Kenneth’s death. What was he like?\n\nBC: Kenny was somewhat acidic. He would often have something to say about everyone. For example, Charlie (Hawtrey) would walk on set and he would say ‘Oh Christ, she’s pissed again’. The last time I saw Kenny was actually at Pinewood. It wasn’t during a Carry On. We were on opposite sides of the corridor and as he passed me he quipped ‘Oh God, you don’t change do you’. Very cryptic. It was a very cryptic thing to say.\n\nCP: It is. Particularly as I assume there had been no previous ‘problems’?\n\nBC: No, exactly. I always thought how very cryptic.\n\nCP: So, this year marks the 60th anniversary of Carry On. What do you think the stars of the series who sadly aren’t with us any longer would make of the ongoing popularity of the series?\n\nBC: Well, I think they all might think the same thing, what a great shame I didn’t have a piece of the action! (referring to the well known low pay and lack of any residuals from the films). The money was dreadful.\n\nCP: I know. In fact, you are the second person to tell me that in as many days! I spoke with Bill Maynard this week and he pretty much said the same thing to me!\n\nBC: Ah Bill (laughs). We did a show together called ‘Dangerous Davies’. I was ‘Dangerous’. I always remember one day on a break from filming he was sat in the caravan reading the paper. I went in to get changed between scenes and said, ‘I’m knackered Bill’. He glanced up from his paper and replied ‘well, you said you could do it when you wrote in!’ (laughs). I love that."
