        "text": "Bernard Cribbins was a multi-talented performer.\n\nActor, comedian, singer and raconteur: he had a go at everything from Shakespeare to pantomime, Jackanory to Top of the Pops.\n\nHe was the voice of the Wombles, Catherine Tate's cuddly grandpa in Doctor Who, and the irate-but-soft-hearted station master who tugged at our heartstrings in the 1970 film The Railway Children.\n\nWhen he was nearly 90, he published an autobiography looking back on his years in show business in 2018. Its title was Bernard Who? 75 Years Of Doing Absolutely Everything - and its advice was simple.\n\n\"Do your best and be grateful for every single job\".\n\nHome comforts were few and far between: a cold-water tap, a tin bath and an outside toilet that Bernard nicknamed \"the long drop\".\n\nLife on stage began at Oldham Rep at age of 14, where he found himself appearing in a succession of small parts. They were just \"two lines and a smile,\" he recalled - but it was enough to give him a taste for the bright lights.\n\nLittle could dent his ambition, not even a horrific accident in a production of Macbeth.\n\nThe play ended with the usual sword fight between Macbeth and Macduff. To save money on expensive fake swords, real ones were used instead. The actor playing Macbeth, Harold Norman, was fatally stabbed in front of him.\n\nCribbins' eight-year stint in Oldham was interrupted by National Service, where he served with the Parachute Regiment in Palestine during the 1947-1948 crisis.\n\n\"Six months of getting shot at; I don't recommend it,\" he said, many years later.\n\nLater, when appearing as Wilfred Mott in Doctor Who, Cribbins proudly wore his regimental badge on the front of his woolly hat. His experience of being under fire in Palestine was even written into the script.\n\nThere were further spells in local theatre, where he turned his hand to Shakespeare and Tennessee Williams. In A Streetcar Named Desire, he played Stanley Kowalski - the part made famous on screen by Marlon Brando.\n\nFor Cribbins, the part may have been too far a stretch. \"On the first night I took my T-shirt off and wiped myself down with it,\" he said, \"and a man in the front row was sick.\"\n\nIn 1956, he made his West End debut in a musical production of A Comedy of Errors, moving on to a number of leading roles in plays such as Salad Days.\n\nHis first film role came as a sweaty naval rating in a wartime drama, Yangtse Incident. To his surprise, Cribbins found that he enjoyed the silver screen as much as being on stage.\n\n\"It was quite different from the theatre,\" he told The Stage, \"requiring more thought and stillness. I remember the cameraman telling me not to blink during a tight close-up otherwise my eyelashes would look like a couple of giant condors taking off.\"\n\nHe went on to act alongside Peter Sellers in Two-Way Stretch, a comedy about a group of convicts planning to break out of jail, rob a train and then return to their cells to establish the perfect alibi.\n\nCrime - on screen at least - continued to pay as he followed up with The Wrong Arm of the Law and Crooks in Cloisters.\n\nIn 1962, he released two comedy records: Hole In The Ground and Right Said Fred, both of which reached the UK Top 10 and were produced by George Martin, who would shortly sign the Beatles.\n\nCribbins ultimately decided to quit the novelty record business. \"Novelties tend to wear off after a while,\" he said. But, years later, he was asked to sing Hole In The Ground at George Martin's memorial service at St-Martin-In-The-Field.\n\n\"Everybody enjoyed it,\" said Cribbins proudly. \"It got huge applause and Elton John gave me a hug and said: 'Why didn't you do Right Said Fred as well?'\"\n\nA natural comedian, Cribbins came to the attention of the Carry On team - playing Midshipman Poop-Decker in Carry on Jack. Carry on Spying followed, a production that suddenly seemed less fun when Cribbins was \"shot point blank in the face by an extra with a gun\".\n\n\"If you don't shed a tear when she shouts, 'Daddy, my daddy!' you're made of wood,\" said Cribbins. \"I always well up when I watch it. But Jenny, who remains a close friend, doesn't. Hard as nails, she is!\"\n\nHe also became a regular in pantomime, especially as Widow Twankey - and found enduring fame as a voice actor: narrating road safety films as Tufty the Squirrel and - in 1973 - becoming the voice of The Wombles.\n\nBased on Elizabeth Beresford's books, the stop-motion animation series ran for 60 episodes, with Cribbins voicing all of the environmentally friendly characters.\n\n\"They were lovely to do,\" he reminisced. \"Although there was one who didn't appear that much, MacWomble the Terrible - the Scottish one, second cousin to Great Uncle Bulgaria. He sounded like Bulgaria on something.\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s he continued to work in films, television and radio, including a part in the poorly received Carry on Columbus, which was destined to become the last of the long-running film franchise.\n\nThere was a brief spell as lecherous Wally Bannister in Coronation Street, before gaining a new generation of fans in 2007, starring as Wilfred Mott in the Doctor Who Christmas special, Voyage of the Damned.\n\nCribbins had first appeared alongside a time lord in 1966, with Peter Cushing playing the Doctor in Daleks Invasion: Earth 2150 AD. In 1974, he narrowly lost out on becoming the legendary character himself, when the part went to Tom Baker.\n\nBecoming Catherine Tate's grandfather - after a four-decade break - made him the first actor to travel in the Tardis as two separate characters.\n\nIn 2009, Cribbins was awarded a special Bafta to mark his contribution to children's film and television. An OBE followed two years later.\n\nAway from work, he was a keen fly fisherman who voiced a number of fishing documentaries and shared a house in Surrey with his wife, Gillian, whom he met and married while at Oldham Rep.\n\nStill working in his late 80s, he was asked if he had any future ambitions. The man who had done just about everything had one.\n\n\"I'd still like to do a Western,\" he said. \"I could play Clint Eastwood's dad!\""
