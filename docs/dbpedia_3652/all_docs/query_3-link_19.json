A group of prisoners plan to break out of jail, commit a robbery, and then break back into their jail again, thus giving them the perfect alibi – that they were behind bars when the robbery occurred. However, their plans are disrupted by the arrival of a strict new Chief Prison Officer.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThree prisoners nearing the end of their jail sentences, \"Dodger\" Lane, \"Jelly\" Knight and \"Lennie the Dip\", are visited by a vicar seeking to find employment for them. He is actually conman \"Soapy\" Stevens, who proposes a large-scale diamond robbery. They will also all have alibis, because they will break out of prison, commit the robbery and then break back in. With the assistance of Dodger's girlfriend Ethel and Lennie's mother the trio smuggle themselves out in a fake prison van driven by Soapy. The operation is almost foiled by the new Chief Prison Officer, disciplinarian \"Sour\" Crout.The trio return to the prison by hiding inside a garbage truck they know is scheduled to make an early morning pickup at the prison(a load of garbage is unexpectedly dumped on them) The trio hide the diamonds in the Governor's office until they are released and can take them away. All goes well until the sack of diamonds is lost on a train. Stevens is recognized and arrested, but not before Crout throttles an actual Vicar and starts a near riot. But the others get away, still trying to steal the diamonds again. They are seen in disguise at a ceremony where the Sultan will literally receive his weight in jewels.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Sellers as \"Dodger\" Lane\n\nLionel Jeffries as Chief Prison Officer \"Sour\" Crout\n\nWilfrid Hyde-White as \"Soapy\" Stevens\n\nBernard Cribbins as Lennie (\"The Dip\") Price\n\nDavid Lodge as \"Jelly\" Knight\n\nIrene Handl as Mrs Price\n\nLiz Fraser as Ethel\n\nMaurice Denham as Horatio Bennett, the prison governor\n\nBeryl Reid as Miss Pringle\n\nGeorge Woodbridge as Chief Prison Officer Jenkins\n\nEdwin Brown as warder Charlie\n\nCyril Chamberlain as gate warder (day)\n\nWallas Eaton as gate warder (night)\n\nWilliam Abney as visiting room warder\n\nThorley Walters as Colonel Parkright\n\nJohn Wood as captain\n\nRobert James as police superintendent\n\nWalter Hudd as Reverend Patterson\n\nMario Fabrizi as Jones\n\nWarren Mitchell as tailor\n\nJohn Glyn-Jones as lawyer\n\nArthur Mullard as Fred\n\nIan Wilson as milkman\n\nEdward Dentith as detective\n\nJohn Harvey as governor Rockhampton Prison\n\nTed Carroll as \"Tarzan Model\" in Art Class\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe prison scenes were filmed at the South Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, and the security van robbery at Pirbright Arch in the village of Brookwood in Surrey.[4]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nKine Weekly called the film a \"money maker\" at the British box office in 1960.[5]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Jokes and situations borrowed from many a Service farce and laboured parodies of prisoner-of-war escape films are churned out by a familiar cast in a setting reminiscent of Convict 99. Wilfrid Hyde White easily gives comic point to every unctuous line, but Peter Sellers disappoints after his performance in I'm All Right Jack, as if neither he nor anyone else had worked out what sort of character he should give his convict. All in all, though, the pace and simple, rough humour of the story should guarantee the film a public.\"[6]\n\nIn The New York Times, Bosley Crowther gave it a positive review, writing, \"the script by John Warren and Len Heath follows a straight line and is clever and full of good Cockney wit. Robert Day's direction is lively, in the vein of civilized farce, and the performances are delicious, right down the line,\" concluding, \"Mr. Sellers is still on the rise.\"[7]\n\nLeslie Halliwell wrote: \"Amusing comedy with good performances and situations, unofficially borrowed in part from Convict 99.\"[8]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
