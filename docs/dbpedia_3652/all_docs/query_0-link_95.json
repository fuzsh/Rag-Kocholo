        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nPersonal Note: (And yes, I realize that criticism itself is a personal response to creative work; however, this is personal in an entirely different manner.) Although I no longer use any form of social media, a friend who recently attempted to copy the URL for one of my posts here to his Facebook page was blocked from doing so. It seems I am, or have been, somehow, “abusive”… whatever the fuck that means.\n\nI don’t know why Zuckerberg’s bots believe my writing is “abusive.” I can only assume some piece of mine which my friend previously re-posted to his page was reported by one of those little pissants who cry for Mommy every time they go online. (Is that “abusive” enough for you?) In our current, reactionary cancel-culture and mass delusional psychosis it’s your own guess how, or whom, you have offended.\n\nWhoever it was, I hope I live to offend him or her as often as possible.\n\nHamlet: I am but mad north-northwest; when the wind is\n\nSoutherly I know a hawk from a hand-saw.\n\n— Hamlet. Act II, scene ii\n\nNorth by Northwest was the second Alfred Hitchcock picture I ever saw,* via a Sunday afternoon movie broadcast on a local television station in, I think, the summer of 1976, and at a vulnerable age for a budding movie aficionado it gave me a false impression of the director’s work. That the picture was considered “quintessential Hitchcock” by people then writing about classic movies further clouded the issue; it took me years, and many additional Hitchcocks, to recognize that North by Northwest is unique among the filmmaker’s American pictures. If it is in any way quintessential, it’s the quintessence of his British movies.\n\nA variation on the “wrong man” theme the director had been exploring since The Lodger in 1924, it is also in some ways nearly a remake of The 39 Steps, particularly in Hitchcock’s lifting of the aeroplane sequence from John Buchan’s novel, not included in his earlier adaptation. While the filmmaker alternated between light thriller entertainments and darker, more dramatic pictures, it was for playful mystery/suspense entries such as the original The Man Who Knew Too Much, 39 Steps, Secret Agent and The Lady Vanishes that Hitchcock was best known, at least before he emigrated to America. These sparkling comedic melodramas were what most moviegoers, both in Britain and America, thought of when they heard the name Alfred Hitchcock, and it was those older pictures toward which he seemed to be nodding when he and his scenarist, Ernest Lehman, came up with the idea for North by Northwest.\n\nHitchcock’s American movies by contrast tended with obvious exceptions to be heavier, and more concerned with ostentatious feats of technical and photographic wizardry, both directly before North by Northwest and after it. This lush, VistaVision truffle about a Madison Avenue advertising man mistakenly drawn into the world of espionage is more akin to Rear Window, To Catch a Thief and The Trouble with Harry in the lightness of its touch than it is to heavier items like Rebecca, Suspicion, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, Notorious, Strangers on a Train, The Wrong Man and Vertigo. It isn’t that the more comic Hitchcock features are unconcerned with style or technique; they simply draw less attention to themselves, and to the man behind the camera. As Eliot M. Camarena succinctly notes, “While I enjoy most of his work overall, I cannot reconcile those flashier moments of his with the man who told François Truffaut that a good film director ‘must never let the brushstrokes show.’ When people say, ‘That’s a great shot,’ they are saying the director yanked them out of the movie and into ‘look-a-me!’ territory.” Sometimes, at his self-indulgent worst, all Hitchcock seems capable of is showing off his brushstrokes.\n\nHitchcock is at his most interesting, and entertaining, when his movies concentrate their narratives on human beings in conflict with themselves and each other, even in a comic context — not when he is executing elaborate camera dollies or attempting to achieve with bravura technique what he was best at capturing through more subtle effects. Rear Window, for example, was as carefully planned, and as technically proficient, as Psycho or Vertigo or The Birds, yet its effects don’t overwhelm you. (Well, other than that helicopter at the beginning, an obvious process job that detracts from the opening montage in which Hitchcock introduces us to James Stewart’s neighbors.) The audience’s emotions are controlled with great craft and wit and incision, and by writing (John Michael Hayes) and performance (Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr) as much as by directorial technique. You never resent what Hitchcock is doing in a movie like this or feel — to use an almost Gelbartian mixed metaphor — you’re having dazzlement shoved down your throat. It’s all of a piece, smoothly stage-managed and drolly observed, the tension slowly ratcheted up nearly to the breaking point, without recourse to showiness. That, not cameras dollying in from great heights to focus on a key in an actress’s hand, or a performer unconvincingly falling backwards down a back-projected staircase, is the true essence of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThe insistence by this director on flagrant technique often suggests to me less a sense of filmmaking panache than an essential uncertainty about how to approach his material, particularly when, as is well known, he found the pleasure of moviemaking only in the preparation: Once the actual shooting began, the picture was dead to him. His fussiness with storyboards was the opposite of liberating. No wonder Orson Welles, at least in private, was so dismissive of Hitchcock’s ham-handedness; for a man like Welles, the fun of a movie was in its making, and its editing, not its planning. Alas, it is Hitch the Show-off the cineastes swoon over when the content of his pictures is what should (and, in his best movies, does) most engage, and compel, us. After that television showing of North by Northwest in my mid-teens, I spent nearly a decade fruitlessly trying to discover its like among Hitchcock’s American movies. Only after museum and art-house screenings of Foreign Correspondent, The Lady Vanishes and The Man Who Knew Too Much were supplemented by the reissue to theaters of Rear Window did I at last understand what the phrase “quintessential Hitchcock” really meant.\n\nRear Window was also, like North by Northwest, essentially a comedy, even if it does concern a possible domestic murder (and the disposal of the body through dismemberment)… as well, later, as the killing of a small dog and two attempted homicides. There’s a killing in North by Northwest as well, which gets neatly pinned on Cary Grant’s ad executive and precipitates his cross-country escape run. The U.N. delegate’s knifing death isn’t funny, of course. Indeed, he’s the movie’s tragic figure in that he is the ultimate victim of the mistaken identity “MacGuffin” that sets the plot in motion and puts Grant on the run. His only crime is talking to the wrong man at the wrong time.‡\n\nAlthough the position Roger Thornhill, the Grant character, finds himself is essentially comic, and all the more so for the mysterious occurrences happening to the premier light comedian of the 20th century, his imminent death hovers over the action from beginning to end. What makes it more insidiously disturbing is the way the intelligence agency behind the nonexistent agent for whom Grant is mistaken is so cavalier about an innocent man’s fate. Responding to my earlier comments on the blatant distrust of the American government Hitchcock and Ben Hecht expressed in Notorious and which I felt was “obvious, astounding for the period, and wiser than either knew,” Eliot Camarena commented: “We see the same thing in North By Northwest, when Leo G. Carroll’s murderously callous and indifferent spy-master has no adequate reply to Thornhill’s telling him how vile the government’s tactics are. And Thornhill is merely upset about the treatment of Eve Kendall [Eva Marie Saint] — he doesn’t know that the ‘committee’ accepts, because it serves their purpose, that Thornhill himself will likely get killed. Thanks, government…” Indeed, they sit around a corporate-style conference table, speculating, with complete indifference, on what will probably happen to Thornhill; they might as well be discussing the number of fleas on a lab rat’s backside. As with Notorious, which looks so askance at the early CIA, I wonder whether Hitchcock knew, was just guessing, or correctly assumed that all governments look upon their citizens as eminently expendable cogs in the big, dehumanizing machine?\n\nWhatever its undercurrents, North by Northwest is really about entertaining an audience: Setting its expectations spinning, honoring its collective intelligence (a less risible concept in 1959 than it is in 2022) and allowing it to enjoy one of its favorite movie stars cavorting across half the continent with a yielding but unreadable feminine ally and a suave, formidable antagonist dogging his heels — the sort of thing which was once a staple of American moviegoing but for which today’s creators have neither the knack nor the inclination. Indeed, one uneasily anticipates the day Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese “remakes” North by Northwest as a brooding thriller with nasty shock effects liberally sprinkled throughout the running-time.\n\nSomeone did remake North by Northwest once, in the late ’70s. His name was Colin Higgins, and in palmier days he wrote Harold and Maude as his master’s thesis. One of those facile creatures who after a striking debut maintain a steady paycheck producing hit nonentities (Foul Play, 9 to 5, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas) that please a lot of people and are then almost entirely forgotten, Higgins re-imagined North by Northwest as a comedy with violent kinks, with Gene Wilder the innocent man, Jill Clayburgh in the Saint role and the redoubtable Patrick McGoohan substituting for James Mason, but with bristling nastiness and gratuitous racism in place of wit and soft menace. What was memorable about Silver Streak were Henry Mancini’s engine-like main theme, the running gag of Wilder being thrown from the train and his hilariously incredulous response to it (“Son of a bitch!“), Richard Pryor as Wilder’s acquired sidekick, and the shoe-polish disguise he improvises for his new compatriot, which despite making the white man the butt of the joke will undoubtedly be condemned in an academic journal by some humorless (Caucasian) Gen-Z grad student the minute he finds out about it.\n\nNone of which have anything to do with North by Northwest, except that the “passing” gag almost seems to have been Higgins’ comic rebuke to Cary Grant pretending to be a Redcap on the 20th Century to get safely off a train surrounded by FBI men searching for him. There is even a follow-up to this, in which the Federal agents accost the movie’s actual Pullman Porters, thinking each might be Grant. All these men are revealed, in contradiction to the reality of the time, to be white. Surely Hitchcock and Lehman were aware that the Pullman Porters were black, and that they were an elite group in American labor of the time, employment for a lucky few seen as membership in an exclusive, and remunerative, ethnic fellowship?§ Now, of course, the very word “porter,” whose provenance stretches back centuries, is considered “somewhat derogatory,” and the proud Pullman Porters themselves have been recast as victims, figures of pity only slightly above the status of plantation slaves. Thus do ignoramuses rewrite history.\n\nOne suspects the director and his scenarist couldn’t think of any way out of the problem they’d set up for themselves other than having Grant black up, which they were not about to do. Still, when one considers the Pullman history, the scene in Chicago is unfortunate. The train going into a tunnel as Grant and Saint consummate their marriage isn’t an error, of course, but it is a mistake — an example of the way Hitchcock so often thought he was being au courant about sex, all Freudian and naughty, when the jokes were merely adolescent and passé. Did he seriously believe no one had ever thought of that one before? Why not a hot dog going through a donut hole while he was at it? Far wittier is his (and we must assume the jest was Hitchcock’s, not Lehman’s) giving Grant’s Roger Thornhill the monogram “R.O.T.” on his custom matchbooks. When Eve Kendall asks him what the “O” stands for he replies, “Nothing.” This isn’t merely clever; it’s a sly in-joke, the barb aimed at Hitchcock’s former employer, David Selznick, who added the “O” to his name for “for flourish.” Roger is fully aware of what a rotter he is; that matchbook is simultaneously a boast, a jest and a shamefaced admission.\n\nI may seem by dwelling on the flaws of this movie to be pillorying Hitchcock instead of praising him for the American picture of his I most enjoy. But since there are very few such mistakes or miscalculations in North by Northwest, those that do exist stand out all the more. Aside from the demonstrably phony forest in which Grant and Saint share their formal goodbyes prior to the climax, the only other obvious flaw in the second half of the picture is the young boy putting his fingers in his ears just before Saint fires her gun at Grant in the Mt. Rushmore café. You really can’t blame the kid; he’d doubtless been through at least one rehearsal with sound, and children’s hearing is far more acute than that of adults. In an enclosed space, those blanks going off were probably louder than fireworks. Still, it’s one of those unaccountable flubs you can’t quite fathom no one spotted during the filming. Isn’t that the sort of thing they pay script supervisors for?\n\nOne of Hitchcock’s canniest moves on North by Northwest was insisting that MGM, which produced it, allow his cinematographer Robert Burks to shoot the picture in VistaVision, the Paramount widescreen process. I’ve been a Panavision maven since my adolescence, but when you see a good print of a VistaVision movie projected in a theater you understand why so many filmmakers of the period preferred it to wider screen processes like CinemaScope. VistaVision’s aspect ratio is not as wide as 70mm but it’s taller, giving enormous depth and a unique sharpness to its visual field. (Once fine-grain film was perfected, VistaVision was no longer deemed necessary and largely disappeared, a development I lament.) Hitchcock had already employed it to beautiful effect on To Catch a Thief, The Trouble with Harry, his color remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo, and his decision to use it again here was felicitous, especially in his location work. The crop-duster sequence†, for example, might have been effective in standard Academy ratio, and certainly would have been in widescreen CinemaScope; VistaVision, however, fully concentrates the images, making the rural Illinois road neither too small to be effective nor overwhelming the viewer with sheer size. It also seems to have softened the often ineffective and obvious rear-screen process of the time, especially in Grant’s drunken drive and the Mt. Rushmore finale, which is full of matte work, models and miniatures but which looks so good it retains its extreme acrophobic effect even on home-screens.\n\nMy adult reservations about Alfred Hitchcock’s excesses to one side, he expressed his exceptional acumen at casting by not only repeatedly employing the two finest movie actors of their time but using them for what was most strikingly unappealing in their personas. To term this “the dark sides of Cary Grant and James Stewart” is trite but not altogether inaccurate; the problem lies in seeing actors limning the less pleasant aspects of their movie roles as a kind of psychotherapeutic role-playing game avant la lettre, or a projection onto the men themselves of the characters they portrayed. For all that both Grant and Stewart were supremely gifted technicians as adept at comedy as at drama (especially Grant) each also excelled at depicting men with unsavory contours. Stewart’s astonishing run of darkness extends from It’s a Wonderful Life in 1946 through his collaborations with Anthony Mann (Winchester ’73, The Naked Spur), Anatomy of a Murder (Otto Preminger) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford) as well as his great work with Hitchcock (Rear Window, Vertigo). I consider the latter title overrated, but not Stewart’s psychotic performance in the leading role, one of the most haunting depictions of obsessive madness in the movies.\n\nGrant by contrast had fewer opportunities than Stewart — the trace of the unknowable in Grant’s performance as Geoff Carter in Only Angels Have Wings is a good example of an early stab, as is C.K. Dexter Haven’s dark glance and eloquent silence in The Philadelphia Story — but his work with Hitchcock alone makes up for the smaller number. Although Suspicion was fatally compromised, Grant was playing the homicidal husband of Joan Fontaine’s fears, and as Devlin in Notorious he takes caddishness to disturbing extremes as the character’s bitterness at the woman he loves for doing what she has been told is her patriotic duty nearly gets her killed. A similar sexual jealousy rears its head in North by Northwest, although it’s far more reasonably motivated: An attempt has been made on the man’s life, seemingly orchestrated by the woman who hid him on the train, and with whom he enjoyed a night of intense kissing (how dare you infer they slept together in that berth!) but who now appears to be the mistress of the man who wants him dead. Wouldn’t you be a trifle miffed? Thornhill doesn’t know, of course, because the men who might have warned him expect him to die, that Eve, like Bergman vis a vis Claude Raines in Notorious, is working for those same intelligence agents, who, as Eliot suggested, are no more concerned for her life than for his. Sometime in the 1970s I began to see North by Northwest cited as a progenitor of the James Bond series. But why? Grant doesn’t work for CIA, and those who do are on the periphery, and are hardly heroic. The chief reasons seems to be that the central figure is witty, and that international espionage is involved. Do people honestly imagine North by Northwest was the first movie to trade on such elements?\n\nGrant’s co-stars work on a level of professionalism as high and as bright as his own: Saint is coolly sophisticated as the woman who at first shields and then betrays Thornhill, only later revealing the depth of her vulnerability; James Mason is silkily menacing as his nemesis, Van Damme; Jessie Royce Landis, although in fact only eight years older than Grant, lends rich comic support as Thornhill’s wry, disbelieving mother; Leo G. Carroll is reassuringly avuncular in a role that might have been inspired by the Satanic Dulles brothers, his grandfatherly mien a patina plastered over a cold-blooded heart; and Martin Landau is intriguingly deviant as Leonard, Mason’s aide de camp, who trusts what he calls his “feminine intuition” and seems to be not merely suspicious of Eve but in love with Van Damme and jealous of his attention to Eve.\n\nHitchcock’s most important collaborator on North by Northwest was not Burks, or his editor George Tomasini or even Cary Grant but Bernard Herrmann. Although when unbridled Herrmann could be as overbearing and hysterical as Dmitri Tiomkin at his emphatic worst, at his considerable best he was better than almost anyone else. Herrmann’s score, like James Stewart’s performance, makes Vertigo seem greater than it is, and Psycho would be nearly unthinkable without his astonishing “black-and-white” chamber music. For North by Northwest he composed a driving, incandescent fandango which he supplements with ingenious variations throughout the picture; I don’t think action scoring gets any better than Herrmann’s music for the Mt. Rushmore finale of this movie, or the start of Grant’s drunken escape from his would-be killers, where the agitated string work anticipates Psycho. The composer was also wise enough to know that the brilliant crop-duster sequence, its suspense masterfully teased out by Hitchcock’s extending the puzzlingly mundane contours of its prelude — without which the action to follow would have infinitely less impact — could only be diminished with scoring: Herrmann waits until the climax of the scene to re-introduce his theme. That is more than valuable collaboration. It’s virtually co-authorship.\n\nHitchcock, Herrmann and the title designer Saul Bass set the machine in motion before the credits even begin, with the rolling drums introducing that fandango beginning over Leo the Lion’s roar, a green background superimposed over his image. Animated lines appear, moving both upwards and down, to the left, across the screen. Forward motion is what North by Northwest is about; Hitchcock and Lehman barely introduce Grant as Thornhill before whisking him off at gunpoint, and except for Grant’s scenes with Eva Marie Saint, particularly on the train, the picture seldom stops for breath after that opening. (It isn’t by accident that Hitchcock’s cameo involves a bus pulling rapidly away from the curb.) And while at 2 hours and 16 minutes the picture is a bit long for a thriller, the energy never dips; I’ve seen films 30 minutes shorter that felt twice as long. The writer and the director accomplish this by, first, keeping us as well as Thornhill in the dark, put further off-balance by each confusing new incident; then, having revealed all the tangled threads, by raising the ante through subterfuge (Eve shooting Thornhill) and revelation (Leonard figuring out that Eve is a government agent) so that the tension during the final ten minutes is nearly unbearable — especially with those shots, terrifying for an acrophobe, of the pair climbing around on Mt. Rushmore. Seldom, I think, has a thriller had better pace and acceleration. If you aren’t completely won over before the crop-duster sequence, I don’t know what can reach you aside from a bullet in your brainpan.\n\nAnd now to that classic central episode I’ve danced around so many times in this essay. Other Hitchcock suspense sequences have received greater acclaim but almost without exception they involve excessive, fussy camera tricks (Vertigo), rapid editing (Psycho) or shock effects (The Birds). He is far better served, and better serves his material, when he teases it out with humor (Grant’s drunken Long Island drive, the runaway car in Family Plot) or slowly tightens the screws (Norman watching as the car stops sinking in Psycho) or when he makes an inoffensive, everyday object the source of mounting terror (the carousel in Strangers on a Train). In the crop-duster sequence, he and Lehman turn a lonely stretch of barren highway into an alien landscape in which anything might happen, although nothing (literally nothing) at first seems to be happening at all, as a man alone waits for a bus that never arrives. The entire sequence reportedly contains 133 editorial cuts, but because it runs nearly ten minutes those edits don’t assault you, the way they do in Psycho and The Birds. The filmmaker has the supreme confidence to hold for long moments on scenes of stasis, and it’s the accumulation of mundane detail, over several minutes, that gives the thing its unique build toward a suspenseful ending, as the crop-duster that is, as a bystander notes, “dusting where there aren’t any crops” goes after Thornhill.\n\nThere are so many such great moments in North by Northwest the picture is almost a compendium of the things Hitchcock did well: Thornhill’s comic/scary drunk drive, pursued by murderous thugs; the confrontation with the killers in the crowded hotel elevator; the U.N. knifing; the meeting between Thornhill and Eve in the dining car; the long romantic scene in her stateroom, where the two kissing vertical bodies move with the curves the train makes on its tracks and Grant uses his wrist to steady Saint, allowing her head to roll languidly and sensually along the back of his hand; Saint and Landau seen talking to each other at opposite ends of a row of telephone booths (remember them?); the comic scene at the auction in which Thornhill deftly escapes death by making a public nuisance of himself. And then there’s Grant’s performance, as a man of cavalier attitudes who must finally face his essential self, and who discovers there is more to him than even he thinks. Grant’s Thornhill knows he’s more than a bit of a cad. I suspect it’s what so wounds his pride when Eve seems to have betrayed him; he’s never allowed himself to care much about the women he seduces, and when one goes out of her way to assist him (and accommodate him enthusiastically in other ways) and then sets up his murder, it hits him harder than he may have imaged it could.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest that Grant’s performance is all darkness and rue. At 55 he looks spectacular and moves with the same grace and athleticism he had 20 years earlier; the comic is never far from Grant’s side, or from Hitchcock’s. Lehman’s script is the wittiest the director ever got (in his American pictures, anyway) and Grant is abler than any actor of his generation with a comedic line, or scene. When Thornhill is arrested for drunk driving, for example, Grant keeps curling up on benches and tables, exasperating his arresting officer. But he also never forgets that he has been victimized and wants the cops to do something about it. To the police it’s just another inebriate babbling. To us, who know better, it’s nothing but, as they say in Courtland, the truth. Or take the auction scene where, to attract attention and (he hopes) slip the trap his would-be killers have sprung by getting himself arrested. Grant’s timing, his demeanor and his deliberate obnoxiousness perfectly illustrate how adaptable Roger Thornhill, the placid man in the gray flannel suit, has become. As he’s taken away a well-heeled matron sniffs that Thornhill, who has been ostentatiously insulting about the provenance of the antiquities to be auctioned, is “a genuine idiot.” But we know, as Hamlet did, that to be but mad north-northwest is sometimes the sanest act of all.\n\n*For many years I thought North by Northwest was the first but recently remembered that was a library screening of the 1935 The 39 Steps when I was 12 or 13. Bless those sainted librarians of my pubescent and early adolescent years, who in addition to The 39 Steps introduced me, through weekday evening and Sunday afternoon screenings at various venues, to the Olivier Hamlet, to such glories as The Maltese Falcon and even to amiable trash like High Society and the Charlie Chan programmer Meeting at Midnight. These events mattered to me, at a time when movie-love was beginning to grip me like a fever. What are their equivalents today? Would any self-respecting librarian now dare to screen a black-and-white movie for any audience under the collective age of 60?\n\n†My father’s “kid brother” (as Dad always called him) and his family happened to be visiting us on my first exposure to North by Northwest and I well remember Uncle John sticking his head into the living room, asking what I was watching, looking for a moment at the screen of our black-and-white Zenith television console and asking me if the crop-dusting scene had happened yet. It was one of the most enticing remarks I ever heard about a movie I hadn’t seen before.\n\n‡We’ll leave aside for the moment what the true purpose of the U.N. is. I don’t pretend to offer definitive proof one way or the other of sinister intent, although I suspect we’re living through a manifestation of it. I will simply note that in 1959, when North by Northwest was new, the institution was largely considered benign except by the easily dismissed wingnuts of the time… some of whom seem a lot less wacky today.\n\n§Thanks, again, to Eliot M. Camarena for educating me on Pullman history.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: This went out initially as “January 2020.” Thanks to Eliot M. Camarena for catching the new-year typo; it always takes me a month or two after the 1st to recalibrate.\n\nAnastasia (1956) Arthur Laurents, who adapted the Marcelle Maurette play — itself translated for the English-speaking stage by the playwright and lyricist Guy Bolton — considered Anastasia a fairy-tale, and although it’s ostensibly based in fact there’s little sense in the picture that anyone involved in making it thought they were recreating history. (Even the main setting is off; the actual events took place largely in Berlin, but the director, Anatole Litvak, wanted to shoot in Paris, and did.) In the late 1920s a young woman was presented by exiled White Russians as the Grand Duchess Anastasia, who had somehow miraculously survived the massacre of the Czar’s family in 1918. DNA tests since the woman’s death have proven she wasn’t who she claimed to be, and she was likely mad, but it’s an irresistible set-up for a romantic pastiche, and the movie, taken as a fable, is grand entertainment anchored to three superb central performances, by Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner and Helen Hayes. (Four, if you count Martita Hunt’s marvelous turn as the Dowager Empress’ lady-in-waiting.) Although much of the picture takes place on Andrew Low’s excellent sets (look especially for the elevated trains running outside Bergman’s windows) it’s beautifully lit and shot by Jack Hildyard, who also photographed Summertime and The Bridge on the River Kwai for David Lean. The sumptuous score with its infectious, Russian-inspired main theme, was by Alfred Newman. For a more historically accurate but far less entertaining look at the Czar’s family, see the 1971 Nicholas and Alexandra.\n\nDark Passage (1947) An effective thriller somewhat undone by the plot’s emphasis on coincidence and melodrama but a must for admirers of Bogart, of which fraternity your correspondent has long been an enthusiastic member. Lauren Bacall is rather better here than she would be a year later in the John Huston and Richard Brooks adaptation of Key Largo, perhaps because her character is less wholesome. Written and directed by Delmer Daves from a novel (and first-draft screenplay) by David Goodis, the picture concerns a convict (Bogart), previously found guilty of a murder he did not commit, who escapes prison, falls under the wing of a sympathetic woman artist (Bacall), changes his face and attempts to clear himself in San Francisco. What the movie has, aside from Bogart, are: A good Franz Waxman score; excellent cinematography by Sidney Hickox; effective editing by David Weisbart; and imaginative direction from Daves, who, because of the plastic surgery the Bogart character will later receive, shoots much of the first third from the actor’s point of view, often with a then-novel hand-held camera. Amidst the good supporting cast the always splendid Agnes Moorehead gives good account of a woman for whom the happiness of others is a misery and who is herself only content when she’s making everyone else unhappy, Tom D’Andrea contributes a lovely performance as a sympathetic cabbie, and Clifton Young is very fine as a pathetic opportunist with a grudge. Bogart has the unenviable job of making a marked impression when, first, we don’t see his face and, later, we can’t. Of course, only Bogart sounded like Bogart. Nevertheless, he comes through like a champion.\n\nHis Girl Friday (1940) Despite the terrible title — in the argot of the period, a girl Friday was an office assistant, certainly not an ace reporter as Rosalind Russell’s feminized Hildy Johnson is here — this is the best, and funniest, of the three major movie versions of the venerable Hecht and McArthur play The Front Page. The fast Howard Hawks pace is a factor, certainly, as is the casting of Russell, and Cary Grant as Walter Burns; their breakneck, often overlapping banter (some from the play but much of it added by Hawks, Charles Lederer and the uncredited Hecht, Morrie Ryskind and Chet La Roche to reflect the characters’ status as newly divorced husband and wife) is, to employ an overused term, dazzling and their comic aplomb at lobbing it close to sublime. It’s hard to believe, watching her in this, that until her work as the rich bitch Sylvia in The Women in 1939, Russell was known primarily for drama. That performance, like Grant’s in The Awful Truth, seems to have liberated her, and I suspect she realized that she could go where she may have thought was too far and that a good director could modify her characterization downward, or let it fly as necessary without doing damage either to the piece or to her acting in it. Her Hildy Johnson is scaled exactly right, sometimes midway between calculation and rasping hysteria and always with the right mix of brains, femininity, reporting instincts and an ambition nearly as ruthless as Walter Burns’ own.\n\nThe only thing that defeats her are those awful clothes.\n\nDances With Wolves (1990) Extended Version A movie I’ve long admired, and always enjoy seeing, but which despite the many great things in it somehow skirts greatness. Possibly because the picture also needed a great actor at its core and didn’t get one?\n\nTime After Time (1979) Nicholas Meyer’s debut as writer-director, adapted from Karl Alexander’s clever novel, itself inspired by Meyer’s ingenious Sherlock Holmes pastiche The Seven-Per-Cent Solution. Alexander’s conceit (and that of Steve Hayes, with whom he created the original story, as a screenplay) concerns Jack the Ripper stealing a time machine constructed by H.G. Wells, prompting Wells to follow his quarry into 20th century San Francisco. The picture was slightly hampered by its low budget, particularly in the time-travel sequence, although the second half of that looks quite good. Paul Lohmann’s beautiful, deep-focus widescreen cinematography is a decided asset, as is the wonderful score by Miklós Rózsa. Malcolm McDowell, who’d become associated before this with a number of unpleasant characters and pictures (Caligula, Stanley Kubrick’s repulsive A Clockwork Orange), makes a charming Wells, David Warner an effective (and, at the end, oddly pitiable) Jack and the adorable Mary Steenburgen a perfect mate for McDowell, although Meyer saddles her character with some unfortunate crudity in the dialogue. It’s not as delicious as the Holmes picture, or as satisfying, but for a maiden effort it’s an enjoyable, intelligent entertainment. Remember those?\n\nSong of the South (1946) The self-censorship by the Walt Disney Company of this often charming movie (and anything that springs from it) is far more dispiriting than the picture’s rather idealized depiction of black sharecropping life in the postbellum South.\n\nThe Horn Blows at Midnight (1945) A mildly amusing comedy-fantasy that, while no classic, is also nowhere near the turkey its star, Jack Benny, used to pretend. Benny, as an angel perennially frustrated in his attempts to blow his horn and end the earth, is occasionally hilarious; the director Raoul Walsh keeps the action moving at a dizzy clip; the light-hearted score by Franz Waxman is so good the composer later adapted it into a comic overture called “Athanael the Trumpeter”; the photography by Sidney Hickox (who also shot Dark Passage) is splendid; and there are two funny sequences of characters clinging for dear life from the side of a skyscraper that are also rather terrifying, especially if, like me, you suffer from acrophobia. Alexis Smith a quarter century before Follies illustrates why she was a pin-up dish in the Forties and the good supporting cast (almost everyone has two roles) includes Dolores Moran, Allyn Joslyn, Reginald Gardiner, John Alexander, Guy Kibbee, Margaret Dumont, Mike Mazurki, the young Robert Blake (as a bratty schoolboy) and, as a hotel detective, the peerless Franklin Pangborn, whose repeated slow-burn “take,” with one eyebrow raised and one eye narrowed to a slit, never fails to slay me.\n\nStreet Scene (1931) A good, if stagy, early talkie of the 1929 Pulitzer winner for drama by Elmer Rice, with effective cinematography by George Barnes and Gregg Toland and fine acting by a cast that includes a number of the actors who played it on Broadway: Matt McHugh, Eleanor Wesselhoeft, T.H. Manning, Ann Kostant, George Humbert, Conway Washburne, John Qualen and the inimitable Beulah Bondi as the neighborhood’s all-purpose Gentile yenta. Sylvia Sidney is the nominal star, William Collier, Jr. plays the Jewish boy who loves her, and the cast is largely excellent apart from Estelle Taylor and David Landau as Sidney’s parents. Landau growls all of his (admittedly one-noted) lines like a stevedore who’s just discovered a lefty on his work-crew, and Taylor never stops posing. (See photo above for a representative sampling.) The multi-ethnic “slice-of-life” quality of Rice’s play has dated badly, but there is still genuine emotion within it, well-mined by King Vidor, who is, alas, only allowed a wider, more cinematic, canvas in the last quarter. Alfred Newman’s Gershwinesque main theme is still impressive. (Kurt Weill and Langston Hughes later musicalized the Rice play for their opera-like musical drama of, as they used to say, the same name, out of which came the exquisite, haunting ballad “Lonely House.”)\n\nInterestingly, while Conway Washburne plays the building’s young expectant father, something about him reads, in a largely indefinable fashion (or in any case to me) as gay. I was reminded by Washburne of another young actor in an early ’30s talkie, Harold Waldridge from Five-Star Final. And, as with Waldridge, I can find almost nothing about him save that he had very few Broadway credits and died single, and rather young.\n\nDog Day Afternoon (1975) Arguably Al Pacino’s finest performance, at least in his youth, in one of the director Sidney Lumet’s most representative “New York movies.” Virtually no one today would know how to do it, or would care to.\n\nThat’s always assuming there is a New York left to film in, a proposition increasingly less secure thanks to the city’s mayor and the state’s governor, both of whom seem determined to destroy one of the world’s hitherto great capitals, more and more a dystopic ghost-town from which everyone with the means to do so is now fleeing.\n\nMonkey Business (1931) The Marx Bros.’ third feature, and their first original (i.e., not based on one of their stage triumphs) is a wild, anarchic collection of largely unrelated gags and sequences set first on an ocean liner in which the boys have stowed away, later at the swanky home of an American gangster. It was written largely by S.J. Perlman and Will B. Johnstone with, as they used to say, additional dialogue by Arthur Sheekman, who became one of Groucho’s favorites. Among the highlights: Harpo’s routine with the Punch and Judy show; the four brothers trying to get through Customs, each pretending he is Maurice Chevalier; and Groucho vamping Thelma Todd. Todd, who is also in Horse Feathers (1932), was the closest thing the Marx pictures ever got to a real match for Groucho. She’s nearly as daffy as he is, and completely game. Whether she’d ever follow through is academic; I suspect Groucho would run from any woman who actually gave in without a fight.\n\nThe movie doesn’t make the slightest bit of sense, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe Godfather (1972), The Godfather, Part II (1974), The Godfather, Part III (1990) and The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990/2020)\n\nThe recent Godfather Coda clarifies some things that were muddy before, such as Donal Donnelly’s previously unexplained remark in the earlier opening sequence about the Church having an agreement with the Corleones, and is a bit tighter generally, but loses an occasional nice moment — such as Eli Wallach’s Don Altobello pouring Sicilian olive oil on his bread — that, while not essential, is like an unexpected grace-note. The ending, which Coppola claims is also clearer, is every bit as opaque now as it was in 1990. Is this a leap forward from 1980 to 1990, or is it instead a dying Michael’s dream of how he’d like his life to end, the way his father’s did? I’ve never known, and I still don’t.\n\nI also don’t know what, if anything, is left to say about the first two masterworks that hasn’t been said, better than I could, and by the possessors of finer minds than mine. The 2008 “Coppola Restoration” makes Gordon Willis’ rich cinematography (not even nominated for an Oscar™ that year) in the first look more lustrous than it has in decades, although in the second the faces are sometimes, inexplicably, orange. I will, however, venture one, negative, observation: In every Godfather picture, Coppola and Mario Puzo saddled Diane Keaton with the only bad lines. I don’t think either was really interested in writing about women.\n\nThe Carey Treatment (1972) I can’t quite imagine why, after the MGM chief James Aubrey “cut the heart out” of Blake Edwards‘ beautiful 1970 Western Wild Rovers, Edwards believed that Aubrey would leave him alone on this interesting medical mystery thriller. The filmmaker later claimed, not without reason, that Aubrey deliberately set him up to destroy him, and Edwards tried without success to take his name off the completed movie. (The screenwriters, John D.F. Black, Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, were luckier; the movie is credited to one “James P. Bonne,” a pseudonym.) Based on A Case of Need, a good but somewhat meandering early Michael Crichton thriller published under the nom de plume Jeffery Hudson, the movie retains the basic narrative arc — pathologist investigates the botched abortion murder of an underage girl — but alters much of the surrounding detail and even some of the plot, making the central character much more of a maverick than he is in the novel, as well as a Chandleresque smart-ass even when it’s foolish, and dangerous, to mouth off. And while Edwards received no screenplay credit, the writer-director’s touch is everywhere: In the widescreen images, the use of deception, the general look of the picture, its interest in the process of investigation, and in much of the dialogue; the Ravetches were fine scenarists, but an abundance of sparkling wit was not among their hallmarks as screen writers.\n\nAlthough Edwards maintained that the studio head butchered his movie, it’s difficult to tell exactly where Aubrey interfered; the man John Houseman famously dubbed “The Smiling Cobra” pulled the plug with ten days’ filming left to go, so obviously it’s an incomplete picture, but just what is missing I can’t say. I do suspect that the moment in which Michael Blodgett’s homicidal masseur attempts to murder Coburn by driving his car through a telephone booth is less effective than it might be due to the foreshortened schedule (we never see the car hit the booth) but another complicated sequence, in which Coburn’s Carey terrifies the murder victim’s boarding school roommate (Jennifer Edwards, the director’s daughter, and excellent) by driving erratically along the coast near Boston, does not suffer from similar limitations. I wish Roy Budd’s score was more interesting (Edwards was feuding with Henry Mancini at the time) but Frank Stanley’s cinematography is rich and varied, and the performances by an equally charming and abrasive Coburn and a large supporting cast cannot be faulted. The latter includes Jennifer O’Neill, lovely as Carey’s girlfriend; Pat Hingle as a phlegmatic police captain (he was more of a dangerous, possibly corrupt, martinet in the novel); Skye Aubrey as a suspect junkie nurse Carey terrorizes into submission; Dan O’Herlihy as the victim’s patrician father; Alex Dreier as her gourmand uncle; and Blodgett, creepily effective as a remorseless killer. James Hong contributes a fulsome portrait as the falsely accused physician, Elizabeth Allen gets a good scene as the girl’s rich lush of a stepmother, and Robert Mandan, Regis Toomey and John Hillerman also give effective brief performances.\n\nTwo additional points of interest in this early ’70s movie: First, Edwards’ use of glass as a recurring motif gives a good but not exceptional thriller some visual fascination, suggesting transparent Bostonian and institutional repression without beating you over the head with the idea. Second, the picture, like the novel, hinges on illegal abortions performed by a conscientious doctor who believes alleviating his patients’ distress is more important than obeying what he sees as a bad law. In America at least, the entire business would become legally moot in less than a year. (Although, of course, the emotional drama goes on.)\n\nChild’s Play (1972) In his marvelous little book Making Movies, Sidney Lumet admitted that he knew this adaptation by Leon Prochnik of Robert Marasco’s play wasn’t going to work after two days of rehearsal. What made the melodrama, one of the few non-musical hits of its year, so frightening on stage, Lumet felt, had been lost, and all he could do was shepherd it to the screen as best he could. The picture isn’t bad, and its tale of creepy, seeming mass-hysteria in a Catholic boy’s school is largely well-acted, especially by Robert Preston and James Mason as warring teachers, Beau Bridges as a former student now engaged as a physical education instructor and David Rounds as a bibulous young priest. (Marlon Brando was originally slated for Preston’s role, which probably helped lure Lumet to the project.) The dialogue, as John Simon noted in his contemporaneous review of the play, is refreshingly intelligent but (as Simon also pointed out) the plot and the action are sheer nonsense. I don’t know what the limitations of Lumet’s filming on the Marymount Secondary School in Tarrytown were, but he seldom shoots out of doors, and the student body of what late in the action we see is clearly a very large campus is, as far as the movie is concerned, puny. Gerald Hirschfeld’s cinematography is impressive, and adds immeasurably to the increasingly unpleasant atmosphere, but Michael Small’s electronic score is aggressively annoying. Still, Preston cannily brings his engaging persona to a role in which expansive bonhomie cloaks a murderous fascistic spirit while Mason, conversely, plays a humorless, demanding taskmaster who genuinely cares about educating the boys.\n\nPerhaps the best (or at least, the funniest) fallout of the movie is Lumet’s anecdote concerning the picture’s producer, the “Abominable Showman” David Merrick. Lumet shot and had screened for key personnel two endings, because he couldn’t decide which to use. When the lights came up Merrick, seated in the back row, derisively asked, “Is that it?” Lumet shot back, “Ask me in that tone of voice again and I’ll smack you, you shitheel.”\n\nMerrick, Lumet said, “like all bullies,” beat a hasty retreat from the screening room.\n\nLionheart (1987) This Franklin J. Schaffner-directed epic about a young noble leading a group of children in a quest for Richard Lionheart, and suggested by the ill-fated “Children’s Crusade,” has the quality of a fable or a chapter-book for pubescent readers, with glorious photography by Alec Mills and a score by Jerry Goldsmith so good it got no fewer than three soundtrack LPs (the score in two volumes and a third record containing selected music from the previous releases). The screenplay by Menno Meyjes and Richard Outten is good, and the cast is even better. The latter includes the young and very appealing Eric Stoltz in the lead, Gabriel Byrne at his most despicable as the Black Prince and, as the young people, Nicola Cowper, Dexter Fletcher, Deborah Moore, Chris Pitt and Sammi Davis. Paul Rhys is also on hand, and excellent, as the young Mayor of the Underground City in Paris. And like a good fable, the picture goes down with pleasant ease.\n\nA Star is Born (1954) The 1983 restoration by Ronald Haver of the first musical version of that now-familiar saga of a young woman on her way up aided by an older man plummeting downward. Although I’m grateful to Haver for his preservation work, it’s always hard when I see the picture not to wish that the overlong (15 minutes!) “Born in a Trunk” number, not shot by the director George Cukor, had never been added to the already long original. It goes on and on, and adds nothing, just as the restoration of the later “Lose That Long Face” production number is superfluous to the action, rubbing in the irony of Garland performing it while her heart is breaking. She’s terrific, of course, but James Mason as the doomed Norman Maine is staggering; he anatomizes anguish without even facing the camera, acting with his shoulders.\n\nCukor, working in CinemaScope from an excellent Moss Hart screenplay (and with a lovely song score by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin) ignored everything he was told he could not do with the new format, and while his camera occasionally goes out of focus on a tracking shot, his grasp of imagery and his assured use of that huge letterbox-shaped screen, are superb.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nOklahoma! (1955) [Todd-AO version / CinemaScope version] The first film adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein show, and the finest.\n\nHe’s never seen anything like it: A delightfully exuberant Richard Attenborough as Blossom, with Rex Harrison’s Dolittle and the Pushmi-Pullyu.\n\nDoctor Dolittle (1967) That this was the picture 20th Century-Fox pinned most of its hopes on in 1967 is as difficult to fathom now as that same studio’s earlier devotion to the money-pit known as Cleopatra was in 1962. That one nearly bankrupted them. Dolittle didn’t do as much damage but it didn’t bring much honor (let alone profits) either. I well remember the picture’s release; I was in precisely the age-group Fox was aiming it at. It was the first non-Disney movie I recall seeing so many commercial product tie-ins for — the sort of thing that we would, a decade later with George Lucas’ Star Wars merchandising, become blasé about was a big deal in ’67. There were children’s cereal tie-ins, toys, games, storybooks, paperback reprints of the Hugh Lofting originals bearing Rex Harrison’s likeness… and records. O, how they had records! The score existed as a soundtrack album, of course, but also in LPs by everyone from Anthony Newley and Sammy Davis, Jr. to Alvin and the Chipmunks. The only thing Doctor Dolittle didn’t get, surprisingly, was a Gold Key comic book. How did Arthur P. Jacobs miss that one?\n\nI don’t think Richard Fleischer’s direction is more than merely competent, and the movie as a whole has more size than real charm. (The original Lofting books, whatever their racial… “limitations,” shall we say?… are almost entirely charming.) Perhaps if it had been conceived, not as a big, sprawling musical but as a smaller and more inventive non-musical fantasy Doctor Dolittle might have been a minor classic of its kind. The presence of Harrison also makes Dolittle rather too Henry Higgins-like for comfort. (Reportedly re-written that way at the star’s insistence… after he first insisted the character be as far from Higgins as possible. That’s what you get when you hire an insecure megalomaniacal drunk as your star.) If it hadn’t been a musical, however, Doctor Dolittle would have lost the one aspect that lifts it above the norm of original musical movies: The Leslie Bricusse score.\n\nIf his screenplay is less sparkling — you can sense the prints of too many fingers on it, and the pushing of a one-sided romance that never takes flight feels weirdly like an exercise in masochism — Bricusse’s songs have a nearly unerring grasp of character, time and place that, combined with their melodiousness, their feeling for mood and their gentle humor, make them almost ideal musical-comedy numbers. Sadly, three of his prettiest ballads (“Beautiful Things,” “Where Are the Words?” and “Something in Your Smile”) were either cut after the premiere or, in the case of the first, cut in half. The footage apparently no longer exists, making the otherwise lovely Twilight Time Blu-ray a bit of a disappointment. I know there are those who hate these songs (when “Talk to the Animals” won the Oscar for Best Song cries of “Oh, no!” were heard in the auditorium) but as I have often said of the Sherman Brothers’ work, if you think it’s easy to compose a clutch of engaging and melodic songs with witty lyrics that can amuse an adult and that a child can also comprehend and appreciate, you write one.\n\nThis was the era of the big “road show” musical, and the second such movie my mother took my sister and me to (the first was The Sound of Music a year or so before) that had an Intermission; a big deal for a seven-year old in 1968. Is the movie any good? It seems to me better than its reputation would suggest, but I lack perspective on it: When a picture enchanted you as a child and holds up generally on adult re-viewing, who knows? It’s entirely possible that I feel about Doctor Dolittle the way younger people do about what I regard as the meretricious garbage they grew up with; Willow comes to mind, and The Goonies, and the movies of John Hughes. Before we trash the taste and pleasures of others’ youths, we would do well to examine our own.\n\nThe Lion in Winter (1968) The movie adaptation by James Goldman of his 1966 play, one of those rare pictures whose wit, and spectacular performances, make it a pleasure no matter how many times you’ve seen it.\n\nJulius Caesar (1953) This moderately engaging Shakespeare adaptation benefits almost entirely from its actors, and from its typically expert Miklós Rózsa score. Certainly Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s direction is merely workmanlike, when it isn’t altogether poor, and its special effects would be inadequate in a high school production. (The storm sequence is almost hilariously bad; I pictured Tom Courtenay off-stage, frantically pounding on kettle-drums and sheet-metal.) James Mason makes a splendid Brutus, acting entirely on principal and haunted by his own deeds, and although she has one scene only, Deborah Kerr as Portia matches him, her warm voice and understated anguish the perfect compliment to his brooding. John Gielgud, long absent from the screen, made a superb return as Cassius, that mellifluous bassoon of a voice first seducing Brutus, then hectoring him and, finally, locating the character’s latent sense of honor. Best of all is Marlon Brando’s Anthony. Although the play is really Brutus’, to Anthony was given the great funeral oration, with which the character subtly alters the mood of the all-too-pliable mob through irony and rhetoric. (Brando creates a nice moment when, his back to the Roman crowd, he smiles briefly, knowing he has them. Mussolini would surely have approved.) Brando went to Gielgud for advice on diction and phrasing, but the approach is unmistakably his own. He makes each phrase sound natural, as if it just occurred to him. He’s not imitating Gielgud; he’s not imitating anyone.\n\nOn the far side of these splendid players are the gaseous Grande Dame posturings of the appalling Greer Garson. Her acting epitomizes what used to be meant by publicists and newspaper writers when they trotted out the word “distinguished.”\n\nDemon Seed (1977) An effective, although not exceptional, adaptation of Dean Koontz’s creepy, truly disturbing cyber-horror novel, arguably more relevant now than it was in 1977, what with transhumanist maniacs like Yuval Harari urging on the mating of humans with machines. Fritz Weaver is an A.I. expert who has created a living computer, and Julie Christie is his estranged wife, who becomes its first victim. The picture suffers from its modest budget and the limitations of the 1970s special effects (about to be rendered altogether redundant by George Lucas) and from a lack of interior logic in its Robert Jaffe/Roger O. Hirson screenplay: When Gerrit Graham as one of Weaver’s employees goes to check on Christie and is murdered by “Proteus IV,” his disappearance is ignored by everyone for the crucial month the computer requires for Christie to carry and give birth to its progeny. Donald Cammell directed competently, although with very little style; but for Bill Butler’s rich cinematography, Demon Seed could almost have been a made-for-TV movie. Jerry Fielding’s musique concrète score is effective in context, although I can’t imagine wanting to listen to it in isolation. Butler, who two years earlier shot Jaws, brings warmth to a cold story with his supple lighting and color. Almost unreservedly grim, the picture has one good in-joke: The chilly, unemotional voice of Proteus IV was provided by the equally frigid Robert Vaughn.\n\nThe Mouse on the Moon (1962) A mildly amusing adaptation of Leonard Wibberly’s satirical novel, itself a sequel to his enormously popular The Mouse That Roared and its inevitable movie. As with the film adaptation of that book, The Mouse on the Moon is more twee than funny, although it manages a few laughs. Margaret Rutherford is charming as the Grand Duchess, but her role is shorter than one would like and she is, curiously, less sweetly moving than Peter Sellers was earlier, in the same part! A lot of good farceurs are in this one, including Ron Moody as the corrupt Prime Minister, Bernard Cribbins as his earnest son, Terry-Thomas as a less than efficacious English spy, the Broadway actor Tom Aldredge (husband of the costume designer Theoni V.) as a hapless Pentagon assistant and David Kossoff as the preternaturally cheerful and unhurried scientist whose discovery that the tiny Duchy’s combustible wine can be used as fuel for a space capsule sets the plot in motion. Michael Pertwee (brother of Jon) wrote the script, and Richard Lester directed in a style that is rather sedate for him — but A Hard Day’s Night was just around the corner.\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest (1952) Only a true auteurist (or anyway an auteurist home video company) could seriously attach a possessive credit to The Importance of Being Earnest other than Oscar Wilde’s. Yes, Anthony Asquith wrote the adaptation and directed it, but I suspect he would be appalled at being named, as Criterion does, the “creator” of this movie. Thus does the viral insanity of Andrew Sarris infect everything.\n\nWilde’s “Serious Comedy for Trivial People” is one of the great pleasures the English-speaking theatre affords, its torrent of polished witticisms and dizzying aperçus piling up in a manner so intoxicating that in addition to laughing, often, we sit in the theatre smiling in perfect bliss for the play’s three delirious acts. The 1952 movie is briefer than the play — it runs a fast 95 minutes — yet somehow we miss nothing. And if both Michael Redgrave (as Jack) and Michael Denison (Algernon) are a good decade older than their roles, Asquith’s framing device of a theatrical performance is superfluous and Denison’s perennial mode of expression is something between a smirk and a sneer, rendering him less impish than unpleasant, everything else is absolutely right. Asquith’s pitch and pacing are exactly correct, and his cast is nearly perfect. Redgrave, with his dashing mien and rich, plummy voice, is an ideal Jack Worthing, perfectly matched by the serene imbecility of Joan Greenwood’s Gwendolen and Dorothy Tutin’s Cecily. Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson are, as always with these two sublime comedians, oases of hilariously unflappable British reserve. And if it does nothing else, the movie preserves Edith Evans’ peerless Lady Bracknell. Her performance is so perfectly calibrated, her characterization so utterly certain of the rightness of its extreme rectitude and absurd traditions, her memory must present a formidable hurdle to any actor assaying the role. How do you make it your own when she got every line so magnificently right before you? And yes, everything you may have heard about her reading of the outraged line “A handbag?” is correct; no matter how many times I hear it, Evans’ exquisite comic phrasing always elicits from me a gale of explosive hilarity. As an added fillip, Desmond Dickinson’s rich photography, like the delicious British light music score by Benjamin Frankel, makes the thing like a colorful bonbon, as charming to look at as to ingest.\n\nJohn Simon always maintained that intelligent laughter was the very best sort. There are fewer pure fonts of it than this.\n\nSatchmo (1988) The superb jazz (and, lately, movie) critic Gary Giddins’ heartfelt 1988 tribute to one of his idols, and mine. Written by Giddins and co-directed by him and Kendrick Simmons, Satchmo charts the astonishing youthful rise of one of the few undisputed musical geniuses of the 20th century, illustrating just why he, more than anyone of his time, defined the parameters of the form and the place of the great solo artist within it; his sometimes troubled middle-age; and his transcendent emeritus years, when the taint of Uncle Tomism, never fair, began to fall away and Armstrong’s importance could be more broadly understood. When his great Hot Fives and Hot Sevens recordings from the late 1920s were reissued on LP around the time Giddins’ documentary was airing on PBS, they were a revelation: While Armstrong was hardly the first jazz performer — the genre predated his arrival in it by decades — those records made it feel as if he was inventing jazz right on the spot. Next to an astonishment like “West End Blues,” almost everything that came before was literally marking time.\n\nDespite Hattie Winston’s passionless and undistinguished narration, Satchmo does for Armstrong, in 90 minutes, what it takes Ken Burns, in Jazz, 10 episodes to do. The live footage of Armstrong in Copenhagen in 1933 alone justifies the entire event.\n\nDivorce American Style (1967) Few things date faster than topical humor. Divorce American Style was old-hat two years after its release, when no-fault divorce became the law of the land in California, where the movie is set, and its then-scathing satire instantly devolved from amusingly au courant to hopelessly passé. So if you like the picture as I do and have since seeing it on television in the mid-‘70s, you have to approach it as a period-piece — even though its Norman Lear/Robert Kaufman screenplay has infinitely more bite to it than William Rose’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, the script that bested it at the 1967 Oscars. This was one of Dick Van Dyke’s few non-family friendly projects of the ‘60s, and one of his best. He’s the husband impoverished by his state’s punitive divorce laws, although I would think being married to Debbie Reynolds was punishment enough.\n\nWhile there is some sharp dialogue and several cleverly conceived and executed sequences, usually set to Dave Grusin’s inspired faux-Baroque music (the opening titles, in which the evening’s suburban arguments are orchestrated by a conductor; the scene in which each warring spouse attempts to thwart the other’s abilities to strip their joint bank holdings; the Sunday-fathers’ gathering of the clans; and a prolonged silent fight between Reynolds and Van Dyke, punctuated entirely by slamming doors and sliding cabinets) much of the humor of the picture lies in its canny casting: Jason Robards, Jr. as the tragi-comic divorcée hoping to pair his ex (Jean Simmons) with Van Dyke, to get him off the financial hook that is literally destroying his heath; Shelley Berman and Richard Gautier as overly pally divorce lawyers; Joe Flynn as an ethical philandering husband; Martin Gabel as a humorless couples’ therapist; Lee Grant as an insulted call-girl; Tom Bosley as a divorced man explaining the intricacies of weekend fatherhood to a bewildered Van Dyke; Van Johnson as a square, mother-ridden car dealer; and in smaller roles, Emmaline Henry, the “hip hypnotist” Pat Collins (as herself), Shelley Morrison, Eileen Brennan as Robards’ girlfriend (this was her first movie) and, as Van Dyke and Reynolds’ knowing sons, Gary Goetzman and Tim Matheson, the once and future Jonny Quest.\n\nConrad L. Hall’s muted color photography and Ferris Webster’s often effective editing make this one of the rare ‘60s comedies that has more in common with the kineticism of The Graduate than with the glorified Universal television look of a Doris Day vehicle. After a second bracing Van Dyke black comedy (Cold Turkey in 1971) and the 1973 Ryan O’Neal caper The Thief Who Came to Dinner the director Bud Yorkin and his writer and co-producer Norman Lear would develop All in the Family for television and pretty much turn their backs on the movies for good. Interesting too that the fruits of their TV empire, the rather pointedly-named Tandem Productions, which encompassed All in the Family, Maude, Good Times and Sanford and Son, should now be referred to solely as Norman Lear’s. There’s nothing like having good P.R.\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955) The first Disney animated feature in widescreen and among the most pleasing of all full-length cartoons.\n\nHearts of the West (1975) is one of those puzzlers that occasionally crop up: A bright, funny little movie about a hapless Candide in the early days of cheap talkie Westerns with a charming script and a wonderful cast that went by the wayside when it was released and, for reasons that absolutely defy logic, bombed at the box office. What were its “must-see” competitors in the marketplace in October, 1975? Tom Laughlin in The Master Gunfighter? Diana Ross in Mahogany? The “Blaxploitation” Western Take a Hard Ride? That last is not a slur, by the way; I like Take a Hard Ride enormously. I’m simply saying that Hearts of the West had very little real competition for moviegoers’ bucks, and none remotely as good.*\n\nSharply and wittily written by Rob Thompson and efficiently directed by Howard Zieff, it’s a breezy, quirky fable of a Western-obsessed youth (Jeff Bridges), determined to become a novelist, who after inadvertently foiling a pair of con artists (Richard B. Shull and Anthony James) and accidentally absconding with their loot, takes refuge with the cowboys at a Poverty Row studio. Thompson, who later wrote for Northern Exposure and Monk, has a gift for the unexpected; his characters don’t always act the way we think they will, and his narratives veer off into avenues that, while perhaps puzzling at first, eventually resolve themselves, within the gentle madness of the conception, in ways that are eminently reasonable. And, unlike with Richard Rush’s far more highly lauded The Stunt Man, Thompson respects the physical realities of filmmaking. Everything about the picture works, from the soft, lovely cinematography by Mario Tosi and the sometimes hilariously accurate art direction by Robert Luthardt and set decoration by Charles B. Pierce to the cunning period costumes by Patrick Cummings and Ron Talsky. Zieff’s direction is clean and uncluttered, and he gets the most from Thompson’s script and from his actors, who aside from a typically wonderful Bridges include Alan Arkin as an excitable director, the sublime Blythe Danner as his practical assistant, and Andy Griffith as a Western gunfighter with a secret. It was the best screen role Griffith had lucked onto since the 1957 A Face in the Crowd, and you can well understand why he was still bitter about the movie’s financial failure a decade later.\n\n*It appears the Bill Cosby-Sidney Poitier comedy Let’s Do it Again was the big winner in October of 1975 — presumably on the strength of Jimmy “J.J.” Walker, then the inexplicably popular star of Good Times, in a co-starring role — along with the Walter Hill period bare-knuckle boxing picture Hard Times and the belated True Grit sequel (and African Queen rip-off) Rooster Cogburn starring the unlikely duo of John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nAfter the apocalypse: Helen Mirren and River Phoenix look to Harrison Ford for a sane reaction to their latest disaster. They won’t get it.\n\nThe Mosquito Coast (1986) Harrison Ford gives what may be his finest performance, in a very good movie almost no one has seen.\n\nThe Weavers: Wasn’t That a Time! (1982) Jim Brown’s absolutely wonderful documentary, ostensibly on the final Carnegie Hall reunion concert by The Weavers but really about American values in adversity and defiance in the face of repression is especially relevant now, as hundreds of millions behave like sheep over a winter influenza virus and gratefully permit their various versions of Big Brother to squeeze yet more liberty from their already diminished lives.\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd (1967) John Schlesinger and Frederic Raphael’s gorgeous but frustratingly flawed adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s wonderful novel.\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: For fuller reviews of some of the movies below, click on the highlighted titles.\n\n“The Sign of Four / The Hound of the Baskervilles” (1983) A pair of Sherlock Holmes adaptations by Charles Edward Pogue for British television starring the irreplaceable Ian Richardson which, while not precisely faithful to Conan Doyle, are rich in atmosphere and, in Richardson, boast perhaps the finest Holmes before Jeremy Brett sealed the franchise.\n\nUnderworld U.S.A. (1961) Mediocre Samuel Fuller is still worth watching, although we might have expected better of a former ace crime reporter than this half-baked yarn concerning revenge served at freezing temperature. But then, the picture dates from an uncertain period for Fuller, the years wherein he meandered between the sting of House of Bamboo (1955) and Forty Guns (1957) and the astonishment of Shock Corridor (1963) and The Naked Kiss (1964). Most of the Fuller pictures from that time are curios, quasi-successful but tamer affairs than those that came before. This one, suggested by some Saturday Evening Post pieces by Joseph F. Dinneen, has its moments but the plot isn’t feasible in the slightest, the romance seems shoe-horned in, and I don’t buy Cliff Robertson as a hardened criminal for a moment. (But then, I don’t buy Robertson as pretty much anything.) Much better are Beatrice Kay as his surrogate mother, David Kent as his adolescent self, Dolores Dorn as his would-be paramour, Larry Gates as the cop-turned-D.A. who’d like to nail the mobsters and set Robertson straight, and Richard Rust as a smiling, sweet-faced sadist who seems to literally seduce Robertson into the mob; their initial meetings feel like an extended courtship dance.\n\nDespite some beautiful set-ups (the cinematographer was Hal Mohr) and a few effective scenes, Underworld USA ultimately has too many sequences like Rust’s running-down of a little girl on her bicycle: Fuller doesn’t show the killing, only the child’s mother calling to her from an upstairs window and the girl (Joni Beth Morris) looking back just before impact. Instead of enhancing the horror, these rather studied choices diminish it; they’re like the worst of Hitchcock — which is bad enough only a fool would emulate it. Like Verboten!, Run of the Arrow, The Crimson Kimono, Hell and High Water and Merrill’s Marauders, Underworld USA is less a good movie than a collection of some good scenes in search of a better place to go.\n\nScorpio (1973) An avis of increasing rarity, the intelligent thriller, anchored by the performances of Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon and the magnificent Paul Scofield.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s extraordinary debut as a writer/director, a masterpiece of detective fiction featuring Humphrey Bogart’s breakthrough performance as Sam Spade.\n\nThe Man Who Would Be King (1975) Another of John Huston’s group quests toward ultimate failure, a tangy adaptation of Kipling with a superb trio of leading players in Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Christopher Plummer.\n\nA Study in Terror (1965) A clever, if implausible, mating of Sherlock Holmes with the Jack the Ripper mythos, which isn’t a patch on the later Murder by Decree (1978) but which boasts an excellent Holmes in the person of the classical actor John Neville, later immortalized as Baron Munchausen by Terry Gilliam. Donald Houston is a good Watson, the splendid Anthony Quayle an excellent Doctor Murray, Frank Finlay in a part he reprised in Murder by Decree is an intelligent(!) Lestrade, and it’s fascinating to see a very young Judi Dench in a pivotal role. The boxer Terry Downes has a sexy, and surprisingly well acted, cameo role, and John Scott composed an effective score which, even when it brings in bongo drums(!!) does so in a way that feels wholly appropriate.\n\nThe cinematography by Desmond Dickinson is a bit on the bland side, period television color where chiaroscuro was called for, and James Hill’s direction, while brisk and effective, lacks the sick-making horror the subject demands. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the movie is Georgia Brown, the original Nancy of the musical Oliver!, whose warm whiskey-contralto has long been a favored sound in my home. She shows up twice, as a pub singer in Whitechapel (presumably on the basis of her performance of the Lionel Bart song “Oom-Pah-Pah” in Oliver!) and if you only listen, she’s perfect. Her face, alas, explains why others got to play her stage roles in movies. She grew into her looks eventually and became a handsome older woman, but in 1966 hers was not the type of physiognomy guaranteed to queue up the paying customers.\n\nThe Life of Émile Zola (1937) I first encountered this all-too-typical Warner Bros. biopic on television in my early adolescence, and all I really remembered was the material dealing with Captain Dreyfus. Seeing it again, now, I understand why: It’s one of the few inherently dramatic portions of the narrative. While the picture’s Dreyfuss (Joseph Schildkraut) was whitewashed — it was his arrogance of personality as much as the fact of his Jewishness that precipitated his false arrest and cynical imprisonment — and the anti-Semitism downplayed, at least the subsequent trial of Zola for J’Accuse has spark, courtesy in part of Donald Crisp as the outraged attorney Labori. Those who have complained that the scapegoating of Dreyfus in the picture is depicted as entirely devoid of religious bigotry have apparently never noticed (and I admit it is fast) the juxtaposition of the insert-shot of the Captain’s file reading, “Religion: Jewish” with Harry Davenport’s line damning him as, of two suspects, the man to charge with treason. The implication is entirely obvious. But what can be expected of people who for decades have sung hosannas to Paul Muni’s unconscionably hammy performance as Zola? His constant shameless mugging for the camera indicates a self-regard so thorough an audience has little need to bother; he clearly thinks he’s adorable enough, why should we make it redundant?\n\nL’affaire Dreyfus eats up so much screen time — and at that omits the role of Alfred’s older brother, promoting the idea that it was his wife who most successfully pressed the case for his innocence — that it would have made more sense to focus on it entirely rather than to attempt squeezing in the rest of Zola’s biography, and with such brevity; his early decades here are a whirl-wind of narrative cliché and the people (his wife, Alexandrine, played by Gloria Holden; Morris Carnovsky’s Anatole France; Grant Mitchell’s Clemenceau; and Vladimir Sokoloff’s Cézanne) are little more than names and attitudes. That it took no fewer than three scenarists (Heinz Herald, Geza Herczeg and Norman Reilly Raine) to bake the thin crust upon which the insufficient filling of this movie rests says something… although just what, I couldn’t say. Gale Sondergaard struggles valiantly with the underwritten role of Lucie Dreyfus and at least retains her dignity, but Schildkraut (who, rather unbelievably, won an Oscar for this) is reduced to little more than periodically screaming, “I’m innocent! I’m innocent!” He does get one nice scene, however, when, freed at last after a decade on Devil’s Island he repeatedly hits the open doorway inviting him back to the outside world, turns, and retreats to his hated cell; in that moment you know everything you need to about the learned behavior of prisoners. The picture’s director, William Dieterle, does what he can with the material, and it is at least a very brisk movie, with very few longueurs despite its 116-minute running-time. Tony Gaudio’s black-and-white cinematography is rich, and beautifully lit; on the big screen in 1937 it must have seemed luminous.\n\nUnforgiven (1992) Clint Eastwood’s award-winning Western, a beautiful, even poetic, rumination on the cost of killing.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) The damn near perfect adaptation of Larry McMurtry’s suberb coming-of-age novel by McMurtry and the director Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nBig Jake (1971) Enjoyable late-period John Wayne, with an intelligent script and a savory performance by Richard Boone as the story’s mercenary central miscreant.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes (1983) A badly muddled misfire purportedly adapted from Ray Bradbury’s magical literary fantasy.\n\nCalifornia Split (1974) Robert Altman’s first feature utilizing the 8-track recording system that made Nashville possible, a genial character study of two degenerate gamblers played charmingly by George Segal and Elliott Gould.\n\nThe Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (1963) An atmospheric and intelligent rendition, from Walt Disney, of Russell Thorndyke’s 18th century rogue Dr. Syn starring a splendid Patrick McGoohan.\n\nTargets (1967/1968) Peter Bogdanovich’s extraordinary, disturbing first feature as a writer-director anatomizing both the sick state of Hollywood and the weird anomie of a serial killer is all too relevant to 21st century America.\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954) Walt Disney’s first movie to be filmed in CinemaScope — it was also in 4-track stereo — 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was at the time one of the most expensive Hollywood productions ever attempted (between $5 and $9 million, imagine) and had it flopped would have been disastrous to the studio. The picture turned out so well it was one of the two top-grossers of its year, earning $28 million in 1954. And if it is less than absolutely ideal, especially in its confusingly British-Christian characterization of Jules Verne’s Sikh Captain Nemo, the movie is technically almost without a flaw, beautifully designed and shot, lengthy but involving, with literally marvelous art and set decoration (Peter Ellenshaw contributed some typically beautiful matte paintings)* and a splendid quartet of above-the-title actors. It’s the perfect Boy’s Adventure movie: Rich color photography by Franz Planer (his underwater and day-for-night effects are especially pleasing), an exciting score by Paul J. Smith, assured direction by Richard Fleischer, and an intelligent, often witty, adapted screenplay by Earl Felton that combine to form an exceptionally enjoyable night’s entertainment and in which human conflict, interior as well as exterior, are not elided.\n\nAside from the presence of the seal Sophie (that she needed water we never see her enter or exit from is evident from her shiny and obviously moistened skin) and the now-questionable “humor” of black cannibals getting zapped by Nemo’s protective electricity (why was it considered funny then?) the humor is refreshingly adult and mostly supplied by Kirk Douglas as the harpoonist Ned Land and Peter Lorre as Paul Henried’s assistant. Douglas also gets to sing a nifty ditty by Al Hoffman and Norman Gimbel called “A Whale of a Tale” which becomes one of the movie’s leitmotifs and makes a nice, belated compensation for his having left, in 1944, the original cast of On the Town, where he had the lead. James Mason is so good as Nemo you forgive Disney for messing with the original. That superb light baritone of Mason’s, combined with his elliptical speech patterns and highly idiosyncratic line readings, make him commanding, tragic and ironic at once.\n\nThe special effects, all of course in those days done by hand, are deeply impressive even now, with only one or two indifferent rear-screen bits muffing the whole. Walt produced this one himself, and his acumen shows: When the fight with the giant squid, originally shot against a red sunset on a static sea, both proved lifeless and revealed too many of the technicians’ wires, Disney suggested they re-shoot it at night, and during a storm at sea. It made all the difference; overnight, as it were, a poor sequence became a classic.\n\n* The picture won Oscars for Best Art Direction – Color (John Meehan, Emile Kuri) and Best Special Effects (John Hench, Joshua Meador), although according to Wikipedia, “the movie’s primary art designer, Harper Goff, who designed the Nautilus, was not a member of the Art Directors Union in 1954 and therefore, under a bylaw within the Academy of Motion Pictures… was unable to receive his Academy Award for Art Direction.”\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939) 20th Century Fox’s immediate follow-up to its The Hound of the Baskervilles, released earlier in 1939, proves what a fluke the studio’s first Holmes picture was. Allegedly based on the William Gillette play, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes bears no resemblance to it, nor to the 1916 movie in which Gillette himself starred. Although the picture has a fine, foggy atmosphere — Leon Shamroy was the cinematographer — the narrative is asinine, and even insulting; two of Holmes’ typical lines are, “Whatever Watson has found out, you’ll know inevitably. I have unbounded confidence in his lack of discretion” and (to Nigel Bruce as the Doctor) “I’m afraid you’re an incorrigible bungler.” It concerns the machinations of a bearded(!) Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) to humiliate Holmes, by whom he is eventually thrown off the Tower of London(!!) and Zucco has a high old time of it, all but baring his fangs and gnashing his teeth. In the supporting cast, Terry Kilburn is a good Billy, Mary Forbes charming as a matron, Anthony Kemble-Cooper has a nice turn as a gentle upper-class twit avant la lettre, and Basil Rathbone has an enjoyable bit in disguise as a music hall entertainer. But Ida Lupino is wasted as the damsel in distress and the movie is both lumpy and formless. The director of this flavorless mélange was someone named Alfred L. Werker; this was probably his only well-remembered movie. Nowhere in the credits of the picture will you see the name of Arthur Conan Doyle… for which omission I presume his heirs were duly grateful.\n\nHealtH (1979/1982) An often very amusing political satire directed by Robert Altman involving the race for president of a health convention. It’s an allegory about Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson, with Lauren Bacall as a narcoleptic 83-year old virgin (Ike) and Glenda Jackson as a prating intellectual (Stevenson) who talks, dryly and utterly without emotion, through everything and everyone. Paul Dooley is an obnoxious hypocrite of a third-party candidate who is a mass of prejudices and whose shtick is holding his breath under water, Carol Burnett is very funny as a representative of the President — since the picture was filmed in 1979, presumably Jimmy Carter — and James Garner is only slightly less so as her estranged husband, working for Bacall. Donald Moffat shows up in a sinister performance as Bacall’s frightening brother; Henry Gibson is a political operative whose first sequence in drag as an old woman is so convincing you almost wonder who that interesting actress is; Diane Stilwell is Jackson’s secretary who can’t type and who has supplied Jackson with a portable tape recorder, with which she is pretty obviously in love; MacIntyre Dixon is marvelous as the convention manager; Alfre Woodard is the hotel’s determinedly sunny convention representative vexed by this unmanageable collection of loons; Ann Ryerson is Bacall’s physician who lacks the ability to enjoy sex; the singing group The Steinettes appear throughout the movie, singing brightly and inanely at every conceivable opportunity; and Dick Cavett plays himself, vainly attempting to interview Bacall and Jackson and perennially frustrated by Bacall’s unexpected sleeping fits (if that isn’t an oxymoron.) Altman and Dooley wrote the sharp screenplay with Frank Barhydt, and it’s a relaxed, cheery, sometimes hilarious ensemble comedy. Why any of the people involved thought that a satire on Eisenhower and Stevenson was relevant to anything, or anyone, in 1979 remains a mystery, but everyone in the picture is terrific with the notable exception of Bacall. We watch her thinking we know she was famous for something once, but from her performance we can’t recall just what; after 1966 she always seemed to be playing the paralyzed rich-bitch from Harper — she’d become all surface, the grande dame in her element. What the hell happened to that woman? She was better at 19, when she knew almost nothing about acting.\n\nMatewan (1988) John Sayles’ achingly beautiful evocation of a violent, largely forgotten incident of the 1920s involving West Virginia miners arrayed against vicious coal industry gun-thugs, one of the key movies of its decade.\n\nCasualties of War (1989) A deeply unsettling examination of an American atrocity in Vietnam directed by Brian De Palma which is best when it sticks to the facts but is never less than compelling even when it’s embracing war movie clichés that would have embarrassed John Wayne.\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl (1984) This surprisingly good attempt by the screenwriter Loring Mandel and the stylish journeyman director George Roy Hill at condensing one of John Le Carré’s large, complex thrillers is compromised but, curiously, not undone, by its central miscasting. With her signature red hair and championing of Palestinian rights, the actress Charlie in the novel was obviously meant to remind readers of Vanessa Redgrave. Unlike Redgrave (or Diane Keaton, the Charlie of the movie) it was central to the Le Carré novel that Charlie was young, in her early 20s, passionate but unformed, and not nearly as worldly, or as informed, as she thinks she is. Likewise, casting Yorgo Voyagis, Keaton’s junior by a year, as the Israeli agent who seduces Charlie into falling in love with him while seeming to put her off (and who becomes her guide and instructor in the elaborate “theatre of the real” the actress is enticed into against a Palestinian bomb-maker) rather than a distinguished, reticent, aging actor of the time — Paul Scofield might have been ideal, or even Dirk Bogarde or Alan Bates — eliminates Charlie’s obvious father-fixation. These rather essential cavils aside, Keaton is excellent as Charlie, locating both her anger and her pain, although I don’t believe for a minute an American would be headlining a small British theatre troupe. Unlike Keaton, Klaus Kinski is an almost perfect casting choice for Kurtz, whose complicated scheme keeps Charlie, and the audience, in the dark until the climax; Kinski absolutely gets the Israeli agent’s bonhomie, his middle-aged charm and his deadly seriousness. Like the book, the movie is highly ambivalent about Zionism even as it largely accepts the more than dubious notion that violence is the proper response to terror. The strong supporting cast includes Sami Frey, Michael Cristofer, Eli Danker, Philipp Moog, Anna Massey, Thorley Walters and David Suchet. My only complaint about the production design is the truly terrible coat Keaton is forced to wear through much of the picture. She can’t carry it off, but I can’t imagine the woman who could. Such is Le Carré’s brilliance that Charlie’s last line, slightly altered from the novel, has stayed with me since I saw this one 35 years ago.\n\nThieves Like Us (1974) As Pauline Kael once suggested of him, Robert Altman made two bad movies for every good one, and in-between another that was essentially lousy but with enough good, or even great, moments in it to sustain your interest. Examples of this last include The Long Goodbye, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Short Cuts, Gosford Park… and Thieves Like Us; it has some splendid things in it, and is beautifully cast, and shot. But it’s both elliptical and repetitive in weird and off-putting ways, and you sit there wondering what you’ve missed when you haven’t missed a thing. In the sequence in which the movie’s young central characters Bowie (Keith Carradine) and Keechie (Shelley Duvall) make love for the first time while listening to a radio broadcast of Romeo and Juliet, for example, and we hear the same between-act announcement from the narrator at three separate intervals, we don’t know what it means. Is the sequence a fantasy of Keechie’s or Bowie’s? Is one scene real and the other two fantastic? But because they don’t seem to be anything other than what they appear to be — sequential moments broken up in the cutting — nothing about these scenes really supports that hypothesis. So why did Altman choose to disorient us at this important juncture? Why, for that matter, is there a discussion between Carradine, Bert Remsen and Ann Latham in which it seems Bowie and Keechie have become notorious Bonnie and Clyde figures, their doings reported in the newspapers, when we have seen no such thing? It feels as though there’s a reel missing, or at least a few scenes. Speaking of which, why is Remsen’s violent death only spoken about, in a radio news story, and not seen? The omission feels like narrative cheapness. Kael said of Thieves Like Us that it was, “the closest to flawless of Altman’s films — a masterpiece.” What movie did she see?\n\nThe picture was shot on location in Mississippi, which Altman was told was “the asshole of America” but which he and his French cinematographer Jean Boffety found beautiful, and their fondness for the place and the people shows; the look of the movie is almost like a living Impressionist painting. The excellent cast includes John Shuck, Louise Fletcher, Al Scott, Tom Skerritt and Joan Tewkesbury, who also collaborated with Altman on the script and would write Nashville for him. (She’s the woman at the train station Duvall talks to at the end). Calder Willingham also worked on the screenplay, based on the 1937 Edward Anderson novel which originally provided the basis for the 1950 They Live by Night, directed by Nicholas Ray.\n\nThree Days of the Condor (1975) Although Three Days of the Condor rather needlessly complicates the novelist James Grady’s original plot, there are some real compensations, not least of which is intelligence.\n\nThe Thief and the Cobbler (1993/2013) Richard Williams’ astonishing animated Arabian Nights feature, still incomplete but reconstructed by Garrett Gilchrist in his Recobbled Cut Mark 4.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery (1978) Michael Crichton’s The Great Train Robbery (known in Britain as The First Great Train Robbery, to distinguish its action in the minds of potential ticket-buyers from the much more contemporaneous, and well-remembered, “Great Train Robbery” of 1963) is one of those richly appointed, beautifully shot and wonderfully cast entertainments that make for a wry, exciting evening’s amusement as long as you know that, while depicting on an actual incident, the picture is largely fictional and should be taken as such. Based on the 1855 theft of gold from a moving train, and on the writer/director’s own novel, the picture is a cheery, funny escapade with some sharp digs at the British upper class, and glorious production design that puts you absolutely in Victorian era London (although it was shot largely in Ireland.) Sean Connery is the ersatz nobleman of dubious means, suave but dangerous, who plans and executes the theft; Lesley-Anne Down is his actress lover who proves useful in a number of necessary diversions; Donald Sutherland, often hilarious, is the safe-cracker; and Wayne Sleep is the ill-fated criminal acrobat who runs afoul of Connery.\n\nCrichton’s direction is elegant and wonderfully paced; he seems always to know exactly where to place the camera. Jerry Goldsmith composed one of his most distinctive scores for the picture, anchored to a charming waltz he then transforms into variants: Slowed down it evokes the atmosphere of London’s mean streets, simplified it becomes a romantic lyre accompaniment for Connery and Down’s bedroom scenes and sped up it’s rousing background music for the robbery. One of the movie’s great pleasures is the lush widescreen color cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, to whom Crichton dedicated it. A painter with light, Unsworth shot some of the most sumptuous looking movies of the 1960s and ‘70s: Becket (1964), the Olivier Othello (1965), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Olivier’s Three Sisters (1970), Cabaret (1972), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Royal Flash (1975), The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Superman (1978) and Tess (1979). The fine supporting cast includes Alan Webb, Pamela Salem, Gabrielle Lloyd and Malcolm Terris as a smug, hypocritical bank official. The final joke has no basis in historical reality, but takes the movie out on a high, and very funny, note.\n\nHeat (1995) Michael Mann’s complex, character-driven heist movie has the texture of a sun-lit nightmare: L.A. as a warm place to die a chilly death.\n\nThe Thrill of it All (1963) A shrill, occasionally funny farce, meant to satirize television advertising but so dishonest about that it merely gums the subject rather aggressively. Doris Day is an obstetrician’s wife who gets corralled into performing impromptu cleanser commercials for a cheesy live drama omnibus show (in 1963?) and finds her marriage on rocky (or, if you prefer, soapy) ground. It’s too ephemeral to take seriously for a moment — The Glass Bottom Boat had more gravitas — but it’s a pretty thin gruel to have come from the combined talents of Carl Reiner (screenplay) and Larry Gelbart (story, with Reiner). Some of the scenes have that terrible look so representative of the era’s color television episodes, but the cinematographer, Russell Metty, occasionally gets in some pleasant lighting. It would have been almost impossible at that time to imagine the director, Norman Jewison, ever making movies as rich as In the Heat of the Night and Fiddler on the Roof, but at least his pacing is brisk.\n\nJames Garner brings his usual charm and comic outrage to the husband, and the supporting cast includes Reiner (in several bits), Arlene Francis, Edward Andrews, Reginald Owen (playing Andrews’ father, the sort of role Andrews himself would corner in the coming years), Zasu Pitts as a rape-obsessed housekeeper, Elliott Reid as an advertising man, Alice Pearce, Herbie Faye, Hayden Rorke, Burt Mustin, Robert Strauss, Lennie Weinrib, Lillian Culver, King Donovan, Bernie Kopell and, in a voice-over, Paul Frees. I could also swear I heard Madge Blake’s voice, but can find no proof of her participation. Brian Nash and Kym Karath play Day and Garner’s small children; Karath is best remembered as Gretl, the tiniest of the Trapp Family Singers of The Sound of Music two years later. The picture is inoffensive, even with its dated attitudes toward women in the workplace; the one absolutely unforgivable element is the appalling, mickeymouse musical score by (Frank) De Vol.\n\nAlias Nick Beal (1949) A dark political fantasy that, on balance, seemed designed to satisfy everyone who ever thought a politician had sold his soul, which is pretty much all of us. (Today people like Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don’t even bother to hide their corruption; they display it openly, and their worshipers call us names if we say anything about it.) Beautifully directed by John Farrow and with a brisk, intelligent screenplay by Jonathan Latimer from a story by Mindret Lord, the movie is so sharply observed it puts to shame all the cringe-making, faux-populist projects of Frank Capra, a man with a deep distrust of “the people” even as he desperately kept trying to woo them. Thomas Mitchell plays the crusading District Attorney who in his frustration at being unable to nail a mobster makes a casual wish he never expected to have granted, and Ray Milland is “Nick Beal,” the Satanic figure with the means to deliver. Mitchell gives his usual fine performance, and Audrey Totter is excellent as a good/bad girl, but Milland really delivers. There was always something a little unpleasant about him as an actor that lingered below his surface charm. Billy Wilder tapped it in The Lost Weekend, and Farrow really mines it here. Lionel Lindon’s cinematography, even in a bad print, is rich and atmospheric, and about the only miscalculation in this 82-minute gem is the uncharacteristic, almost shockingly emphatic, score by the otherwise subtle Franz Waxman. With Fred Clark as a machine boss, Geraldine Wall as Mitchell’s saintly wife, a very young Darryl Hickman as a reform-school candidate and George Macready as, of all things, a minister. (Thanks for this one, Eliot M. Camarena!)\n\nCitizen Kane (1941) I ended one year, and began another, with the same film. It isn’t among my very favorite pictures, nor even my favorite among those of its co-author, director and star. But Orson Welles‘ debut is still among the most enjoyable movies ever made, and it yields new pleasures and unexpected contours with every viewing. This time I noticed, for the first time, the way Welles keeps the lighted window at Xanadu in the same spot throughout the prologue, even when it’s a reflection in water. That may not be strictly logical, but it certainly is impressive.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nHome-viewing from The Armchair Theatre over the last three months; because there isn’t a single bloody thing in the cinemas worth the time, petrol, cash or personal energy it would take to go out. Although I will admit I was convinced by a friend to attend a special screening of Daughters of the Dust… thereby proving the point.\n\nTootsie (1982) Take one vanity project for a notoriously self-involved actor (Murray Schisgal writing a screenplay about acting for Dustin Hoffman); mix with a separate script by Don McGuire concerning an out-of-work performer donning drag for a soap-opera role that borrows a bit too liberally from Some Like it Hot, even unto its blond object of affection and unwanted middle-aged suitors; add in re-writes by a small army of scenarists headed by the great Larry Gelbart and including, un-credited, Barry Levinson, Robert Garland and Elaine May; bake by a director widely known as one of Hollywood’s most notorious writer fuckers (Gelbart claimed the movie was stitched together from any number of scenarists’ drafts), and the result should have been a disaster. Instead, through some weird alchemy it not only wasn’t but somehow those ingredients contrived to blend so well the picture became a small classic of its kind. Revisiting Tootsie from a 35-year remove, it seems almost miraculous: A popular comedy that tickles the mind as often as it does the ribs. And the direction, by Sydney Pollack, never a favorite filmmaker of this writer, looks as good now as it did in 1982; whatever its internal flaws (including a series of consecutive events supposedly encompassing a single evening that Gelbart later wrote was “a night that would have to last a hundred hours”) the picture is strikingly lovely, with Owen Roizman’s sumptuous lighting and the crisp, witty editing by Fredric Steinkamp and William Steinkamp giving it a patina of warmth and sophistication, a rare combination for any movie comedy.\n\nHoffman’s “Dorothy Michaels” ranks as one of the great comic creations in American movies, yet the actor also locates the loneliness of the character — or, rather characters, since everything Dorothy says and does is filtered through Michael Dorsey’s brain and emotions — and an essential sweetness and decency Michael himself lacks when he’s wearing pants.* As t"
