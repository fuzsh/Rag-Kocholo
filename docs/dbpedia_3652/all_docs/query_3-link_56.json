        "text": "Bernard Cribbins, a British actor who had roles on “Doctor Who” and “Fawlty Towers” and whose contributions to children’s programs delighted young audiences over a career that spanned seven decades, has died. He was 93.\n\nIn a statement, the management and talent agency, Gavin Barker Associates, confirmed the death but did not say when or where he died.\n\nMr. Cribbins worked well into his 90s in a career that influenced some of the best-known comedy, drama and children’s programs in Britain. He first acted at the age of 14 in his hometown, Oldham, England, just outside Manchester, in a repertory company there, beginning a period of stage work that led to roles in television and film, for which he became widely known.\n\nHe was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 2011 for his contributions to the arts. In addition to dozens of roles in film and television, he recorded the 1960s novelty song “Right Said Fred.”\n\nFor three decades Mr. Cribbins was regularly featured on “Jackanory,” a BBC children’s program in which an actor read books to young audiences. The program, which ran between 1965 and 1996, sought to arouse an interest in reading in children.\n\nIn one of his more than 100 readings, of “The Wizard of Oz,” in 1970, Mr. Cribbins infused the voices of Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard and other characters with a full dramatic repertoire of whispers, tremors and shrieks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
