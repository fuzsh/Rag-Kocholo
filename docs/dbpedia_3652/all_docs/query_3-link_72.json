And I've only heard his second). Because it's all off-the-cuff it showed a different side to him. He was incredibly quick-witted and sharp, with the puns (and the mints) flying about left, right and centre. A line he fired about washing poppadoms still makes me grin, even though I now forget the exact context. He also had a wonderful chemistry with the cast, including Kenneth Williams, Derek Nimmo and Sheila Hancock.\n\nHe worked with Hitch of course, in Frenzy.\n\nMel O'Drama\n\nAdmin\n\nLV\n\n12\n\nMessages\n\n13,683\n\nSolutions\n\n1\n\nReaction score\n\n27,829\n\nAwards\n\n29\n\nMember Since\n\n28th September 2008\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#3\n\nOh - how did I forget about his legendary Fawlty Towers appearance:\n\nJulia's Gun\n\nTelly Talk Fan\n\nLV\n\n1\n\nMessages\n\n488\n\nReaction score\n\n2,053\n\nAwards\n\n7\n\nLocation\n\nEngland\n\nMember Since\n\nOct 2011\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#4\n\nHe narrated and appeared in so many children's TV shows when I was a child in the 70s and 80s. But The Railway Children and that Fawlty Towers episode are probably his most famous appearances. Apparently he nearly choked in that scene with Basil in the restaurant, You can see him turning red!\n\nThought i'd post this little known episode of Tales of the Unexpected he was in as well.

They'd never met, but when she heard his voice at the script read-through, she became strangely emotional and couldn't understand why. Then she realised it was because of The Wombles which she'd watched as a little kid and hearing his voice took her right back there. The Wombles, Jackanory, 'Right Said Fred' and 'Hole in the Ground', which seemed to get played every weekend on Junior Choice (the children's request show on Radio 1), all those Sunday afternoon films like the Carry Ons, Dalek Invasion of Earth, She with Ursula Andress ... he was just always there. And later on, he was really good in a short stint on Coronation Street as a dirty old man who might have potentially fathered Tracey Barlow's baby, and then completely stole the show in the season of Doctor Who where he became a regular.\n\nIn one of the DVD commentaries on the Carry On box set, he talks about actors who have died and how he'll see them again \"in the bar after the show.\"\n\nJulia's Gun\n\nTelly Talk Fan\n\nLV\n\n1\n\nMessages\n\n488\n\nReaction score\n\n2,053\n\nAwards\n\n7\n\nLocation\n\nEngland\n\nMember Since\n\nOct 2011\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#6\n\nThat's a lovely Kylie story. I didn't know that.\n\nIt's a shame he never had a lead role in a sitcom. He usually appeared as a guest or in a supporting role, often stealing the show. He really deserved to have his own vehicle like Leonard Rossiter in RIsing Damp, or David Jason, and maybe would have become even more famous.\n\nLast edited: Jul 28, 2022\n\nAngela Channing\n\nWorld Cup of Soaps Moderator\n\nLV\n\n16\n\nMessages\n\n13,974\n\nReaction score\n\n25,817\n\nAwards\n\n42\n\nMember Since\n\n1999\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#7\n\nThis is very sad news. He had a long and distinguished career but I will always remember him as a stalwart of children's television when I was young. Apart from all the shows mentioned already by forum members, he also presented a long forgotten children's show called Star Turn which I used to loved. It was a kind of quiz show for children with 2 teams of 3 well known celebrities competing against each other. What I particularly liked about the show was the high quality of guests they had on it like the Goodies, the cast of Are You Being Served? or the Carry On actors. It was an era when he was almost always on TV and was a bigger star than many people remember.\n\nBarbara Fan\n\nAdmin\n\nLV\n\n12\n\nMessages\n\n10,562\n\nReaction score\n\n24,010\n\nAwards\n\n28\n\nLocation\n\nScotland\n\nMember Since\n\n2000\n\nFavourite Movie\n\nWitness, Vertigo, Spellbound\n\nJul 28, 2022\n\n#8\n\nSo sorry to hear the news\n\nBernard Cribbins was part of my childhood as narrator of the Wombles, Mr perks in The Railway Children and as the annoying spoon salesmen in one of the best episodes of Fawlty Towers The Hotel Inspector\n\nRIP, thanks for the laughs\n\ndarkshadows38\n\nTelly Talk Star\n\nLV\n\n1\n\nMessages\n\n2,504\n\nReaction score\n\n1,701\n\nAwards\n\n6\n\nLocation\n\nAlong The Path Of The Beam\n\nMember Since\n\nJuly 25 (2005)\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#9\n\nyeah i saw he died to i don't really know how much of his work i've seen i'd have to look it up online but i loved him on Doctor Who and i wish he was used more. since Donna is i think coming back next season i think it's her daughter that's gonna be a companion i think? if he's not in it and had not filmed anything it's gonna really suck him not being there even though they will just write in he passed away no doubt.\n\nSeaviewer\n\nTelly Talk Warrior\n\nLV\n\n7\n\nMessages\n\n5,125\n\nReaction score\n\n8,933\n\nAwards\n\n16\n\nLocation\n\nAustralia\n\nMember Since\n\n14 September 2001\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\n#10\n\nI'll always remember him for this.\n\nLuke_Krebbs_Ewing\n\nTelly Talk Champion\n\nLV\n\n7\n\nMessages\n\n4,738\n\nReaction score\n\n9,862\n\nAwards\n\n15\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nFavourite Movie\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nJul 31, 2022\n\n#11\n\nDoctor Who and The Wombles actor Bernard Cribbins has died aged 93, his agent has confirmed.\n\nDuring a career that spanned seven decades, Cribbins narrated the 1970s children's programme The Wombles.\n\nHe also played the Doctor's companion Tom Campbell in the second big screen Dr Who movie filmed in 1966 Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD returning 41 years later in the revived TV series.\n\nCribbins returned to the show as Wilfred Mott, the grandad of Catherine Tate's character Donna.\n\nObituary: Bernard Cribbins\n\nBernard Cribbins: A life in pictures\n\nHe played Wilfred in Doctor Who from 2007 to 2010.\n\nThe actor was known by generations of children - he also played the station porter Albert Perks in the 1970 film The Railway Children.
