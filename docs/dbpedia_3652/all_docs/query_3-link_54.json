        "text": "The late Bernard Cribbins will appear on screen for the final time this year when the BBC releases its upcoming Doctor Who specials, starring David Tennant as the 14th Doctor. The actor sadly passed away aged 93 in July last year.\n\nHis death was announced by his agent in a statement, which acknowledged his long career and service to children's television, in particular. Gavin Barker Associates said: \"Beloved actor Bernard Cribbins OBE has passed away at the age of 93.\"\n\nThey added: \"Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question. He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nDancing on Ice 'crisis' over Holly Willoughby's future\n\nThe Chase's Bradley Walsh stunned by movie star contestant\n\nThe first of the Doctor Who 60th anniversary specials is set to air on November 25. Although Brenard passed away mid-production he will still feature in at least one episode.\n\nDiscussing Bernard's involvement in the new stories, David Tennant said: \"I am thrilled to say that – although very sadly he wasn't in those episodes as much as we hoped – he was on set with us and Wilfred lives on.\n\n\"Bernard is much missed and much grieved for, but I am so excited that his final screen performance will be [one] I had the great honour of being part of and you'll see it all on your screens.\"\n\nBernard had originally starred in Doctor Who from 2007 to 2010 as Donna Noble's grandfather. He then went on to gain a more prominent role in the show for the Tenth Doctor's final storyline.\n\nBut it would be unfair to simply discuss the great actor's time on Doctor Who. For more than seven decades, Bernard was a feature in TV and film.\n\nHe is possibly best known for his portrayal of Albert Perks in The Railway Children (1970). Many will also remember him from the Carry On franchise, starring in Carry On Spying and Carry On Columbus.\n\nBut for many, he encapsulated their childhood after he voiced and narrated all 60 episodes of The Wombles between 1973 and 1975. He was also a regular on Jackanory, telling stories to children from 1966 until 1995.\n\nOther notable appearances include:"
