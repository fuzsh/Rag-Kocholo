        "text": "BY CHRISTOPHER BORRELLI CHICAGO TRIBUNE O ne strategy for summer reading — and yes, there are strategies — is to begin a project. Dabble in short punchy books, but devote the season to an epic. You get three months. I read “The Lord of the Rings” this way, one installment a summer, for years. Now I’m picking through Robert Caro’s (still unfinished) Lyndon Johnson biography this way. Another strategy: Give yourself a quasi-degree in something very specific. Read the complete short stories of the late Alice Munro. The crime novels of Stephen King. Or underrated Penguin Classics: This summer offers a couple of fresh contenders — Harry Crews’ “The Knockout Artist” (about a boxer with a talent for knocking himself out), and “A Last Supper of Queer Apostles,” unclassifiable writing about being gay under a dictatorship, by Chilean legend Pedro Lemebel. You’ll clip right along. Same goes for an excellent new edition of a monster: The Folio Society’s wonderful “Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,” Susanna Clarke’s contemporary classic about magicians in 19th century England. As a single adventure, it was an 800-plus page cinderblock in 2004. Folio divides all of that into a much brisker trilogy, as it should have been, ideal for devouring in adult-size chunks that you can pass along to a precocious child or spouse, while continuing yourself. As for the rest of you who just want a new mystery or history for the backyard, this summer is overstocked, even more so than the coming fall season. Yes, I read all of these; now get started. NO-GUILT BEACH READS One of the great American mystery series continues with “Farewell, Amethystine,” Walter Mosley’s 16th novel about Los Angeles detective Easy Rawlins. This one finds him in 1970, tracking an ex-husband, navigating gender upheaval. “The Sicilian Inheritance,” by airport favorite Jo Piazza, nails a clever twist on a contemporary cliche: Newly single American woman moves to Italy, discovers herself. The twist — she’s SUMMER BOOKS “Hip-Hop is History” by Questlove, “You Like It Darker” by Stephen King, “Same as it Ever Was” by Claire Lombardo, “House of Bone and Rain” by Gambino Iglesias, “The Swans of Harlem” by Karen Valby and “Charlie Hustle” by Keith O’Brien. STACEY WESCOTT/CHICAGO TRIBUNE PHOTOS Christopher Borrelli “The Age of Grievance” by Frank Bruni, “Fire Exit” by Morgan Talty, “Footnotes from the Most Fascinating Museums” by Bob Eckstein, “Horror Movie” by Paul Tremblay and “Parade” by Rachel Cusk. “Rebel Girl” by Kathleen Hanna and “The Wide Wide Sea: Imperial Ambition, First Contact and the the Fateful Final Voyage of Captain James Cook” by Hampton Sides. If you’re married or otherwise committed to someone, and you decide to make movies together, well, “I don’t know,” says screenwriter, actor and director Kelly O’Sullivan. “It sounds like a real relationship killer.” O’Sullivan told me this the other morning in the living room of the fourth-floor Rogers Park walk-up she shares with director and screenwriter Alex Thompson. They’re partners, with a 6-monthold son, Milo. And they just co-directed a movie together. Sounds like trouble, Thompson concurs with a smile. “Which is why we waited a year or two into our relationship to make a film together.” That 2019 Chicago-made film, “Saint Frances,” starred O’Sullivan, wellknown and respected for her work on many stages around town, as a 34-yearold nanny navigating a series of relational crossroads with her newfound employers, their little girl and her own ambitions. Five years later, they’re back in strong form, this time as co-directors of O’Sullivan’s “Ghostlight.” It’s a tender comedy-drama starring Keith Kupferer, a veteran Chicago stage actor as well as a regular TV and sometime film presence, in a rare leading role as construction worker Dan, a tightly clenched man clouded by the family tragedy O’Sullivan’s screenplay gradually reveals. Katherine Mallen Kupferer, Keith Kupferer’s real-life daughter, ignites the role of Dan’s daughter, whip-smart, touchy, grieving in disharmony with both her parents. Her mother, Tara, is played movingly by another Chicago stage veteran, Tara Mallen, married to Keith and mother to Katherine. The family feeling is everywhere in “Ghostlight,” its title referring to the singlebulb lamp traditionally left illuminated on a theater stage when all else goes dark. Avoiding his daughter’s therapy session one day, Dan meets a cast member of a no-budget storefront theater production of “Romeo and Juliet” by accident. This woman, Rita, smoking and bitter but sneakily big-hearted, is portrayed by Filipino actor Dolly de Leon, a 2022 Golden Globe nominee for the black comedy “Triangle of Sadness.” In a blink, Dan is thrown into rehearsals (they’re short one actor and he’s the first available human to wander by). In another blink, Dan moves into the role of teenaged ‘We figured out it’s a lot like parenting together’ Partners and co-directors Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson in their home in Rogers Park.

Or epic. Choose your own adventure 2024 A+E Turn to Borrelli, Page 8 Chicago Tribune | Section 4 | Sunday, June 9, 2024 1\n\nActor, comedian and writer John Cleese, now 84 and long famed for his seminal comedic work on “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” “Fawlty Towers,” “Life of Brian,” “A Fish Called Wanda” and many other titles, is appearing soon at Chicago’s Vic Theatre as part of his tour, titled “Last Chance to See Me Before I Die.” He recently spoke with the Tribune in a phone interview. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Q: The last time we spoke was on election night, 2000. I remember you calling me back very late that night and asking me who the Tribune’s journalists thought was going to win. I said, everyone was saying Al Gore was the clear winner. Which they were. A: I was shooting the movie “Rat Race” in 2000 and you told me Gore had won easily. I have a bad effect on American elections. Q: I felt guilty for years about telling you that. Your daughter Camilla (Cleese) is working with you now. I once did a WGN radio show with her. A: She lived in Chicago for a while. She’s very funny. When you listen to the audience, her laughs are higher pitched than mine. I think that’s because her humor is much darker than mine. Q: What are you planning to do on stage here? A: I am not sure what I will do. I suppose we will do a couple of hours, for which I have been furiously writing and rehearsing, and there likely will also be a bit of an interval. Q: I assume people get to ask you questions at the end. What do they typically ask? A: I get a lot of very vulgar, pointless questions like, did you (have sex with) Jamie Lee Curtis? What is the velocity of an unladen swallow? Extraordinary things like that. It’s fun to ad-lib. One night in Florida, a very well-dressed, middle-aged lady stood up in the theater and said, “Can I ask you a serious question? Do you think the queen killed Princess Diana?” I was the only one laughing. It was too funny. Why did she think I would know? Did she just think all British people just know? I do think my show goes better in more sophisticated cities. When you play the sticks, it’s hard work and they don’t laugh as much. They give you a very nice reception but it’s no fun playing to them. My best reception was in Munich and Stuttgart. In Stuttgart, I was in my car halfway back to the hotel and they called me up and said, “can you go back to the theater and take another bow? They’re still applauding.” Q: I assume you went back? A: I absolutely did not. I always think it’s a matter of pride not to milk the audience applause too much. Q: There’s now a stage version of “Fawlty Towers” in London. That must be weird. What did you learn at the opening? A: That there is a genuine nostalgia not just for those characters but for a time when we all used to laugh together a whole lot more. Now they’re all Jobsworths at the BBC (a Britishism meaning “more than my job’s worth”). Today, the first thought of every BBC employee when they enter the building every morning is, ‘how I do not get fired today?” That’s the enemy of creativity. As you know, I am the co-director. I said little things in rehearsal like “don’t look at him when you say that.” And other kinds of strange little things, too. It’s not that weird for me; I was a writer as well as an actor and when you are a writer, there’s always the thought that someone else might play the role. Q: You wrote for yourself more than most in your career. A: I remember thinking when I was writing “A Fish Called Wanda,” now I am actually going to have to do that. Q: The “Fawlty Towers” show is a mash up of muchloved episodes of the show, right? Which? A: Three. The hearing aid that stops working, which originally starred Bernard Cribbins. Hotel inspector. And, of course, “The Germans.” Q: All very funny. All very tricky material now. A: The reception was wonderful. And at the interval, my guest was the German ambassador. “Last Chance To See Me Before I Die” is 7:30 p.m. June 12-13 at the Vic Theatre, 3145 N.

E. JASON WAMBSGANS/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Chris Jones By Elise Ryan Associated Press Maggie Rogers wrote and recorded her new album, “Don’t Forget Me,” over five days last winter. The songs came quickly and chronologically, as if she was writing “different scenes in a movie.” “I’ve been writing songs now for 15 years, and so I think I’ve just come into this place where I really trust my process and my craft. I think because of that, I was in a place where I was willing to just play,” Rogers said in a recent interview. The result is a record that Rogers calls “relaxed,” one that finds her “unguarded and present.” The mood is lighter than Rogers’ electric 2022 album “Surrender,” which was in many ways a release of pent-up pandemic energy. And it leans more heavily on acoustic sounds than 2019’s “Heard it in a Past Life,” the first album Rogers released after a video of Pharrell Williams reacting to her song, “Alaska,” in a New York University class went viral. As Rogers explains it: If “Heard it in a Past Life” is air and “Surrender” is fire, “Don’t Forget Me” is earth. Like her past projects — and her studies at Harvard’s Divinity School — community is a through line of “Don’t Forget Me.” Rogers name-drops friends and tells their stories alongside hers. She has welcomed the way the new songs have united crowds and was looking forward to continuing to foster that joyous, present, environment on tour, which kicked off in May. That community-first quality of her music is something that fans also embrace: New York’s Gaia Music Collective, for example, organized a “one-day choir” of Rogers’ song “Light On.” Four hundred people gathered to learn and perform an arrangement of the song, a cappella. “She also is thinking about music as a connective force, as a thing that can bring us and our stories together,” said Matt Goldstein, the group’s founder. “It’s no accident that her music feels good to sing together.” This interview with Rogers has been edited for clarity and length. Q: “Surrender” felt like an album that had to be moved through and experienced with a crowd. How do you see this album being embodied? A: This record was always made for the car. I really wanted to make a record that felt like a Sunday driving record, because to me, those are some of the most intimate moments that I’ve had with music or with an album — when I’m singing along to a song in the car and it feels like that artist or that song is like a friend in my passenger seat. Those are some of my favorite records, and they’re the records I turn to for comfort over and over again. And you know, in this big, crazy, completely insane, existential world, if that’s something that I could offer to the world through my music, I think that that is really special. Q: Could you say more about how you see your three studio albums in relation to each other? I liked how you described each of them as elements — air, fire, earth. A: I think categorizing them in that way is just a way to help give context to them. To me, they’re all really important reflections on different periods in my life. And my songwriting is pretty consistent at the center of all these things. It’s mostly the way that like my producer brain has chosen to dress up the songs at their core and that has more to do with creative expression or curiosity more than anything. In each record, I’m just trying to be as present and authentic as I can. “Don’t Forget Me,” what I love about it, is that it’s this really, like kind of woven tapestry. Like in so many ways I created a character that sort of led me through this album, rather than trying to make a snapshot of my life in the exact moment. But there are real truths woven into that character and into those stories. And you know, it (came) out two weeks before I (turned) 30, and in a way, it feels like this big ode to my 20s and everything I’ve experienced. Even if the narrative plot line isn’t exactly 1:1 with my life, the essence of all of the feelings within all of the songs feels really, really truthful. Q: What do you think you learned after putting what you had studied at Harvard into practice while touring last year? A: It’s funny because I spend all this time thinking about live music and the way people come together around it, and I had this thought that when I got onstage that it would be like, you know, that meme of the woman with the math problem above her head? I was like, that’s going to be me. And then I got onstage. And what I love about being onstage is that I’m not thinking, I’m just moving. I’m just feeling. It’s like deeply instinctual. When I think about the tour that I’ll be on for the next year, I think I’m mostly just really excited to have fun. Like, I’ve worked for so many years and been in so many bands, whether it was like at some underground club in New York City or being 18 and playing in bars or being on the road in a van at the beginning of my career, that now I feel really comfortable on stage and I love playing live. I’m so happy that live music is back in this way. Q: You posted a video around the holidays about a journal entry you found from your time at NYU. A: So trippy. Q: How does that kind of reflective writing fit into your daily practice and songwriting now? A: It’s such a massive part of my life. I mean, I write every day. I kind of can’t sleep without it. It’s usually the last thing I do at the end of the day. And it, like, really is a meditation. I wrote a ton through grad school and have continued working on essays, and I’m turning my master’s thesis into a book. My long-form writing practice feels as much a part of my life as my short-form songwriting practice, and it helps me to stay really present in my life because I’m paying attention to detail all the time. Rogers writes an album for a Sunday drive With ‘Don’t Forget Me,’ singer sought to make a record that could offer comfort Maggie Rogers calls “Don’t Forget Me” a “relaxed” record that finds her “unguarded and present.” AMY HARRIS/INVISION 2023 2 Chicago Tribune | Section 4 | Sunday, June 9, 2024\n\nBy Jake Coyle Associated Press Mohammad Rasoulof was facing eight years in prison — and likely more, considering the uncompromising nature of his latest film, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” — when he decided to flee Iran. His films and statements criticizing government-sanctioned violence against protesters had already earned him a long string of prison sentences, filmmaking bans, travel restrictions and the confiscation of his passport in 2017. Leaving his native country meant embarking on a life of exile, not to mention a risky escape on foot across the mountainous borderland. Two weeks after the harrowing escape, Rasoulof arrived at the recent Cannes Film Festival in France with a completed film. At a Cannes edition where several filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola and Kevin Costner have been praised for investing their own money into their films, Rasoulof has put far more on the line: To debut “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” Rasoulof has risked his life. “I have many more stories to tell, many more narratives to create and films to make,” Rasoulof said, speaking recently through an interpreter at Cannes’ Palais des Festivals. “That’s what persuaded me to leave Iran. I had to go on with this mission. I feel that my mission is to connect the audiences of the world to these stories, to this Iranian narrative. This is my plan for the coming years.” Rasoulof’s dramatic arrival and the explosiveness of his film brought the Cannes Film Festival to a riveting close when the crowd met an emotional Rasoulof with a lengthy standing ovation. The day after the premiere of “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” the festival awarded its top prize, the Palme d’Or. While he didn’t take home top honors, the jury awarded a special prize for his drama. “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” is set during the 2022 protests in Iran and includes real cellphone footage — some it violent and ghastly, censored by Iran’s government — from the demonstrations. The film follows a fictional family of four — a father, mother and two daughters — who acutely internalize the political turmoil. The father, who works in the justice system, is forced to rubber-stamp sentences of protesters. He grows increasingly suspicious of his wife and daughters, as the film turns into a darkly penetrating examination of contemporary Iran. Investing an expansive social drama within the intimacy of a family, Rasoulof says, was a way of reflecting the contrast between the public face and private lives of the Islamic Republic. “There’s a very strong contradiction between what they say and the ideas they think they embrace and the reality of their lives,” he says. “I’ll give you a very absurd example.” Rasoulof recalls an encounter when he was in prison two years ago. He had fallen ill and was taken to a hospital where revolving soldiers stood guard beside his bed. His captors, though, were eager to watch Rasoulof’s prize-winning 2020 drama “There Is No Evil,” about capital punishment in Iran. It’s banned in Iran. “I had to watch ‘There Is No Evil’ every evening,” he says, laughing. “They were so excited to be there with a filmmaker. And they knew that I had made a film about prison guards, so they wanted to watch it. They had found a flash drive and, every night, I had no choice in the film I wanted to watch.” “What’s going on now in Iran and the change that’s about to happen will come from these families, from the inside,” Rasoulof adds. Already wrestling with social unrest and international sanctions, Iran has been mourning the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. Although Iranian authorities have not publicly acknowledged Rasoulof’s sentence, the filmmaker’s attorney said he was recently sentenced to prison and flogging for films and public statements called “examples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the country’s security.” “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” was shot clandestinely in Iran, with a small cast and crew. Before the movie was edited, some actors also fled Iran. But others who helped make the film have been interrogated and their families summoned for questioning, the director said earlier. The cinematographer’s office was raided. One of Rasoulof’s greatest frustrations in fleeing Iran was that he had to leave his unfinished film with his collaborators abroad. “I called them and told them that they would have to take care of the film,” the filmmaker says, “whatever happened.” About two weeks ago, Rasoulof arrived in Germany and rushed to finish work on the final print before sending it to the festival. “Filmmaking and artistic creature are vital to me,” Rasoulof explains. “This is my way of staying alive and carrying on with my life. There is no other way I can imagine living.” For him, there has been no change in his interests. He’s driven to tell stories about freedom and human rights, “or the lack of them in my surrounding, in the society I live in,” he says. “What’s maybe different in this last film is maybe I’ve gotten closer to my subject, in a way. More explicit. “Lately, my interest is not that much the system or the government. It’s not the structure that I’m observing anymore, it’s more the people that maintain this system and allow it to function — the mindset of these people, their motivations.” Ahead of the premiere of the film in Cannes, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” was acquired for North American distribution by Neon, the acclaimed specialty label that has backed five straight Palme d’Or winners, including this year’s “Anora,” last year’s “Anatomy of a Fall” and 2019’s “Parasite.” The Directors Guild of America has also voiced support for Rasoulof “in his flight from unjust sentencing,” Lesli Linka Glatter, its president, said in a statement. “We stand in solidarity with him as he seeks safe harbor.” Asked where he goes from here, Rasoulof says he has already begun work on his next project, an animated work about a modern Iranian writer. “My stories have to do with Iran but not Iran in a geographic sense,” Rasoulof says. “So I can do it anywhere. I don’t have to go back to Iran to tell Iranian stories.” Filmmaker has ‘many more stories to tell’ Director Mohammad Rasoulof, seen May 23, premiered his latest film, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” at the Cannes Film Festival in France. The drama won a special prize from the festival’s jury.

Boeing, the nation’s onceproud aircraft manufacturer, has faced a cascading quality crisis since 2018, which escalated this year after a door panel blew off one of the company’s planes mid-flight, prompting multiple FAA investigations and a criminal inquiry from the Justice Department. And it’s not just Boeing — a New York Times investigation last summer found that understaffing and overscheduling led to an alarming number of unreported near misses on American runways. Despite this, air travel statistically remains the safest form of mass transit in the United States, and it’s worth keeping the risks in perspective. Some of these podcasts do just that by exploring the true stories of air disasters (and why they are so rare), while others are love letters to life in the skies, hosted by proud aviation geeks who have travel tips, airport reviews and nostalgic industry history to share. ‘Black Box Down’: Billed as “a true-crime podcast in the air,” this series ended production last summer but has a back catalog of 150 episodes, each focusing on a different air disaster in meticulous detail. Many of these calamities are well-known, such as the still-mysterious crash of EgyptAir 990 and the miraculous story of US Airways 1549, which was landed safely on the Hudson River by Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger after a bird strike knocked out both of its engines. But hosts Gustavo Sorola and Chris Demarais also cover plenty of less well-trod ground, and have stories you’ll be astonished that you’ve never heard of, including midair collisions, hijackings and a detached propeller slicing through an airplane’s hull mid-flight. While it would seem wise for anxious travelers to skip this show, “Black Box Down” is curiously reassuring because it highlights just how rare these kinds of accidents are and how many things have to go wrong for disaster to strike. Starter episode: “Crash of the Boeing 737 Max 8” ‘The Next Trip’: There’s a satisfying subgenre of podcasts that makes you feel as if you’re eavesdropping on a conversation between friends at a bar, who also happen to be experts in their fields. “The Next Trip” is a prime example, hosted by self-professed aviation geeks (or “AvGeeks”) Doug and Drew (they don’t share their last names), who have worked for major carriers as a pilot and an operations manager, respectively. Their amiable weekly conversations cover the latest aviation news — recent subjects have included the aborted JetBlue and Spirit merger, the wave of multimillion dollar refurbishments across U.S. airports and of course Boeing’s snowballing woes. Both hosts are also regular air travelers, and they share packing tips, review specific aircrafts and airlines, and reflect on how travel has changed throughout these recent, turbulent years. Starter episode: “Aviation Bill” ‘Deep Dive: MH370’: This year marks the 10th anniversary of a haunting aviation mystery. On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and disappeared from air control radar 35 minutes later, vanishing somewhere over the Indian Ocean. Exhaustive searches turned up only scattered pieces of debris, which offered no answers about what happened to the flight. In this meticulous investigative podcast, Jeff Wise, a journalist and aviation expert, breaks down every detail of the story alongside his co-host, Andy Tarnoff. Over more than 25 episodes, the pair leaves no stone unturned as they explore different theories, digging into satellite data, clues from the search effort and the backstory of the flight’s pilot to piece together answers. Starter episode: “The First Vanishing” ‘Layovers’: Spun off in 2015 from a blog of the same name, “Layovers” is one of the longest running aviation podcasts out there. Hosts Paul Papadimitriou and Alex Hunter both spend a lot of time in the air (and in airport lounges), and share a fascination with the commercial aviation industry. In each episode, they talk about their latest travels, offer insights about different airline and aircraft experiences and review airports across the world. Whether you’re a fellow frequent flyer, or just want to live vicariously through their travels and rapport, it’s a reliably fun listen. Starter episode: “The 747 is forever, a London NY bridge at JFK T8, Air France lounge joie de vivre, 777 guillotine, the airport game” ‘Business Wars: Boeing vs Airbus’: Every season of this Wondery podcast consists of several mini-seasons, each exploring the dynamics between two competing brands. Over the course of seven episodes, “Boeing vs. Airbus” charts how Boeing became leader of the pack, beginning in the 1950s after a series of disasters involving its biggest competitor, British manufacturer de Havilland. As Boeing continued to rise, European rivals banded together to create a worthy adversary in the form of Airbus, laying the groundwork for the duopoly that has existed ever since. Now that Boeing’s recent string of incidents has laid bare a culture of corner-cutting and lax safety protocols, the dynamics of that rivalry have shifted significantly in Airbus’ favor, making this exhaustive history feel all the more vital. Starter episode: “Get Your Wings” ‘The Flight Deck’: Produced by the Museum of Flight in Tukwila, Washington, and based in part around its collection, “The Flight Deck” is an invaluable resource for anyone feeling nostalgic or curious about air travel’s past. There are episodes exploring the gradual decimation of legroom on passenger flights, the chaotic origins of air traffic control and the story of the still-unidentified flight hijacker D.B. Cooper, plus wide-ranging interviews with pilots, astronauts, flight surgeons and more. The podcast recently began producing shorter seasons with specific themes — its third season, which aired last year, spotlighted LGBTQ+ stories in aviation history.

IFC Films picked it up for theatrical distribution (100-plus U.S. screens) straight out of Sundance. Filmed in Waukegan and Chicago neighborhoods, the film opens commercially here and in New York on June 14, other U.S. markets June 21. As for the relationship-killing part of co-directing: So far, so good. “We figured out it’s a lot like parenting together,” O’Sullivan says. “Co-directing, parenting — very similar.” She and Thompson shot “Ghostlight” last September. At one point, O’Sullivan, eight months pregnant and dealing with COVID, co-directed in temporary isolation via monitor and walkie-talkie, communicating with Thompson on set. That sounds stressful, yet nine months hence the key actors still talk about how not-stressful the filming days were. Ever. They talk about how Thompson’s visual and technical skills and comforting vibe complemented the actor-whisperer acumen of O’Sullivan, already well known to the Kupferers from their overlapping work on many Chicago stages. “She knows how to talk to actors the way actors want to be talked to,” Kupferer says. “Kelly doesn’t prescribe notes to people; she draws stuff out of you.” Kupferer’s previous screen work, he says, meant the basics: “hit your mark and say your line and don’t screw up the shot. You’re only there for a day, maybe two.” This project was different, besides being Kupferer’s first lead in a movie. In one tricky scene, when Dan enters a rehearsal as the new, deeply reluctant Romeo, utterly at sea, the actor couldn’t quite locate the angle he wanted after a couple of takes. “And then Alex came over and said, ‘Look. You can take as much time as you want. We can take all day.’ That was something new for me. It was liberating. I’m tell you, together, he and Kelly are just terrific.” Mallen notes “the mutual respect they bring to a room. Any room, any situation. There was Kelly, eight months pregnant with COVID, and Alex would say ‘Hey! Kelly has a note!'” They worked smoothly through walkie-talkies. “No panic, no rushing. Just so much grace and kindness and mutual respect.” And clarity, says Katherine Mallen Kupferer, who, like her parents, responded strongly to the filmmakers’ earlier “Saint Frances.” The direction she got, she says, was “just so simple, and so clear. That was really helpful for me.” Her performance confirms it. Coming off the Sundance premiere, both Keith and Katherine Mallen Kupferer signed with Fusion Entertainment’s Adam Kersh, already managing O’Sullivan and Thompson. It has been a fine few months for all concerned. Also a little strange, having your two feature film collaborations coincide with a pandemic and an uncertain future for theatrical exhibition, streaming acquisition and movies approximate size, for example, of “Ghostlight.” “Saint Frances,” distributed by Oscilloscope, enjoyed an auspicious film festival run in 2019. Then its March 2020 theatrical debut hit the pandemic wall. Many discovered director Thompson’s film later, via virtual screenings and then broader online streaming. Then came a logical but worrying development, O’Sullivan says. “I think what’s happening to cinema is also what’s happening to live theater. People have gotten out of the habit of going. I saw way more plays (pre-COVID) than I see now, and not just because of our baby, but because I’m out of the habit.” “Saint Frances” was filmed for $75,000. Post production, including sound recorded at Skywalker Sound, brought it to $130,000. “We cut so many corners in production,” Thompson told me. “We shot so fast. And it was a cicada summer. A lot of complaints from our sound design team that summer.” The financing came from the back room of a Panera. At the time, Thompson ran a movie club for seniors in Bannockburn, near Highland Park, with monthly meetups at a Panera Bakery and Cafe. Each month he assigned his class two new movies on a similar theme, one new, one older, for discussion purposes. He asked his students if they knew anybody interested in making movies. The answer was yes; some turned out to be in the class, and others were contacted. And then a few others. That was the seed money, “which I learned is very useful, just so you can say ‘We have seed money.’ It might be $5,000. Or $100,000. Or just a thousand. But you need it to prove that somebody believes in you, other than you.” After “Saint Frances,” Thompson co-directed a feature he also co-wrote, “Rounding,” a low-budget mystery yet to be released. That cost just under $500,000. “Ghostlight” came in at just under $500,000 as well. Thompson and O’Sullivan’s next project, “Mouse,” a high school story scripted by O’Sullivan and co-directed by O’Sullivan and Thompson, begins filming this September near where Arkansas native O’Sullivan grew up. Budget: just under $3 million, roughly 23 times that of “Saint Frances.” More money, more pressure, says O’Sullivan. Some sample dialogue from their Rogers Park living room the other day includes O’Sullivan’s use of the word “Sisyphean” to describe how she’s feeling about her newest script, only recently begun. “Sisyphean?” asks Thompson, skeptical but easygoing. “Is it?” “Maybe not to you, but …” “Doesn’t feel that way to me.” “Maybe it’s about me having just had a baby. And trying to write in a way so that people will want to make the movie.“ Thompson, smiling; they’re both smiling, thereby proving the importance of love, respect and tone modulation in any important relationship: “But you don’t have to convince anyone to make it.” “Yeah, I do!” “Well, I mean, it’s gotta be good …” O’Sullivan: “Yeah! I’m trying to make it good! But the first draft is always garbage. Well, not garbage, but it needs a lot of work. I was talking to some aspiring writers the other day and I said (low, defeatist murmur): ‘I hate writing.’ And they were like, ‘You do?’ And I said, ‘Yeah! I hate being confronted by by my own mediocrity, again and again and again. (pause) I wonder if that ever goes away.” Thompson has had his own doubts. “You come into directing,” he says, “thinking that being a director means calling the shots and having the answer to everything. In other words, an absence of curiosity. Everyone else gets to be curious, but you’re the one ‘on mission.’ But when we made ‘Saint Frances,’ because it dealt with abortion and Kelly wrote a personal story, I had a really intense sensitivity, I guess, about how it felt for me to direct that story. I found out I just had to defer to Kelly’s script. I remember (cinematographer Nate Hurtsellers) saying: ‘We just have to get out of the way. Get out of the way of what’s working.’ And I started to see that directing is about collaboration, and curiosity.” Their best-known actor in “Ghostlight,” de Leon, is currently in Munich filming Season 2 of “Nine Perfect Strangers.” O’Sullivan and Thompson mailed her manager the script and, de Leon tells me, along with “a really sweet note, saying they’d watched ‘Triangle of Sadness’ and this and that. A lot of really nice things. I’m a sucker for people like that.” “Have you met them?” she asks me. Yes, just yesterday. “They’re just wonderful people, with such good hearts,” she says. “I don’t know if I should say this, but initially they offered me the role of Tara (Dan’s wife, played in the film by Tara Mallen Kupferer). But I just resonated more with Rita. I loved her. I’m a theater person like she is. So Adam (Kersh) asked them if they were open to me playing Rita, and they were, so I did it. And it’s a beautiful script.” On a first read, de Leon found some of the “Ghostlight” plotting to be “a little convenient, a little too coincidental,” with Dan’s private anguish directly mirroring the events of “Romeo and Juliet.” She talked with O’Sullivan, who said, “‘I think if we show this in the most realistic way possible, it’s going to work.” De Leon adds, “And sure enough, it does.” “With Kelly and Alex,” she says, “everything comes from the heart. The film wears its heart on its sleeve, but it’s not sappy. Watching it, it feels authentic and true. That’s what’s special about them, and the atmosphere they create on set. I’ll be honest with you, it was the best working experience of my entire life.” She’s quiet for a second. “Do you know the expression ‘as above, so below’? It means if the people leading you are leading you in a certain way, the followers adopt that behavior. That’s Kelly and Alex. Leading by example.” Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.

MESLAR/CHICAGO TRIBUNE By Michael Phillips Chicago Tribune We’ll have more on the ins and outs of this pop-up demi-festival soon, but for now here’s a primer on Sundance Institute x Chicago, coming June 28-30. Four films from the January 2024 edition of the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, will be screened at the University of Chicago’s Logan Center for the Arts in Hyde Park and at the Davis Theater in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. Two are documentaries: “Luther: Never Too Much,” director Dawn Porter’s documentary on the late R&B powerhouse Luther Vandross; and “Sugarcane,” directed by Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, an account of cyclical abuse perpetuated in the Canadian Indian residential school system. The other two are feature films: Aaron Schimberg’s dark comedy “A Different Man,” addressing themes of ableism, disability, identity and body horror; and director Caroline Lindy’s “Your Monster,” described by Sundance programmer Ana Souza as “a welcome re-steering of the rom-com into darker realms” starring Melissa Barrera. The Sundance x Chicago weekend’s five panel discussions range from the screenwriter and filmmaker-centric “Playing for Keeps: How development labs could be the investment that leads to local artistic sustainability,” i.e., how the Sundance Institute’s projects might be adapted to other cities such as Chicago, to “Stronger Together: How festivals, art houses, and independent exhibitors are working together to revive and reinvent the theatrical experience in the postpandemic era.” Sundance Film Festival director and Indiewire co-founder and former editor Eugene Hernandez and Facets executive director Karen Cardarelli lead the “Stronger Together” panel. Tickets for the films go for $20; the panels are free but require reservations and seating is limited. The late June project also features community events and master classes, with details to come. Much of the activity will take place in the downtown Chicago Cultural Center. Sundance Institute x Chicago runs June 28-30 at Logan Center for the Arts, 915 E. 60th St.; Davis Theater, 614 N.

EMILY CASSIE/SUGARCANE LLC Chicago Tribune | Section 4 | Sunday, June 9, 2024 5\n\nBy John Warner For the Chicago Tribune “Material” is the stuff out of which something else is made. Material also refers to a comedian’s bits, the stuff they deliver to audiences to make people laugh. Camille Bordas’ new novel, “The Material,” mines both of those meanings to deliver an entertaining and perceptive story that somehow manages to bring us close to half a dozen (or more) characters in a novel where the action spans half of a single day. Bordas brings this ensemble together under the umbrella of the first fine arts masters program for stand-up comedy at an unidentified downtown Chicago university. We are introduced to the faculty: Kruger, a successful comic who has recently made a turn as a dramatic actor in a Meryl Streep movie, and Donna, the only woman on the faculty, with a long and successful career as a touring comic who has never managed to take the next step to stardom. The students include Olivia, who is suffused with ambition, and whose self-loathing translates to a sardonic misanthropy, and also Artie, a sweet-natured young man without an apparent edge who worries he is too good-looking for comedy, a fear his classmates and professors are only too eager to reinforce. Artie has a crush on Olivia. Olivia has no time for crushes. There is also Murray Reinhardt, a super successful older comedian who is scheduled to join the faculty as a visitor, but is also going through a period of scandal that may make him toxic. The stand-up MFA is clearly modeled on graduate creative writing programs — a milieu I know well — where the intersection of ambition, unrealized talent, jealousy and insecurity can lead to significant angst and self-doubt. Making the students stand-ups rather than writers turns the volume on these emotions to eleven, as the students see part of their work rise above their peers. There’s a reason why a comedian who has done well is said to have “killed.” There is very little plot — the primary locus of action moves from a student workshop in the afternoon to a performance at the Empty Bottle in the evening — but Bordas still manages to create story tension simultaneously around everyone’s fate as a performer (their comedic material), and what is revealed about the characters (the material of one’s life) through incredibly fluid use of close third person narration that manages to move seamlessly from character to character even inside the same scene. Every character has something weighing on their minds. Kruger’s father, who is living in a retirement home in the suburbs, has recently fired a gun in a bar, an incident Kruger has paid to cover up. Olivia’s twin, Sally, is on her way to Chicago that evening, and Olivia fears her sister will throw an emotional wrench in her plans to impress Murray Reinhardt. Reinhardt is dealing with the fallout of his scandals and lamenting the separation from his ex-wife and son Augie, who is a law student in Chicago, and the reason he has accepted the teaching position. Artie’s brother is a heroin addict who has gone missing … again. “The Material” is primarily a novel of questions: What is the line between comedy and not comedy? How do we figure out what lives we’re supposed to live? What is the right way to love another person? Is improv comedy an abomination as compared to the art form of stand-up? What I ultimately appreciated about the book is that Bordas does not seek answers to these questions. Instead, they are probed, held up for scrutiny through different angles and different characters. Because how could there be answers to these questions? In truth, our lives will always serve us more material, at least until our inevitable ends.

Crichton’s widow Sherri, who is CEO of CrichtonSun, tapped another millions-selling author — James Patterson— to complete the story. “Eruption” is out now. Patterson is very familiar with co-authoring. In recent years, he has published novels with Bill Clinton and Dolly Parton, and often shares writing responsibilities on his other novels. For “Eruption,” Crichton says she gave Patterson all of her husband’s research, and he came back with an outline. Some of the story needed to be brought forward to present day. “We talked probably every few weeks,” Sherri Crichton says. “It was so much fun to read. It would be hard to tell what was Crichton and what’s Patterson’s.” Besides “Eruption,” four novels have been published under Michael Crichton’s name since his death, some with the help of other writers. Sherri Crichton says to expect “other Michael Crichton adventures” in the future. This interview with Sherri Crichton has been edited for clarity and length. Q: You’ve worked hard to preserve Michael’s archive. Why is that important to you? A: When Michael died I was pregnant with our son. I was like, “How am I going to raise our son with him not knowing his father?” So I had to go searching for Michael, and I found him through his papers, which is so remarkable. It gives me so much joy to bring things like “Eruption” to life, because it really does allow John Michael the opportunity to really know his father. That’s why I do what I do. It’s for the love of him and Michael’s daughter, Taylor. Q: What did you discover from those papers? A: Michael had structure and discipline. He was constantly moving all of his projects around. When he wrote “Jurassic Park,” he was also writing four or five other books at the exact same time. He charted everything. How many words he wrote in a day, how many pages, how did that compare to other days, how long it took. Then he would have different charts that would compare what one book was doing compared to, say, for instance, “Fear” or “Disclosure.” Then he would have another chart that would track the amount of time it would take to publication, the amount of time it took to sell the movie rights, then for the movie to be released. Q: Sometimes when people are so cerebral, they struggle socially. Did Michael? A: The person I knew was this incredibly kind, loving, humble, wonderful man that was a great father and incredible husband and fun to be around. I will say he was famous for his pregnant pauses. When writing a book, the pauses would be longer. You didn’t know if he was really at the table. He was working something out, and he would isolate to land that plane. At first, it was very shocking when he was in the zone, but I learned to very much respect that. Like, “I’m not going anywhere. He’s not going anywhere. And I can’t wait to read the book.” Q: When do you feel closest to Michael? A: I still live in our home. I still have the office, which is at home. I honestly feel that he’s always in the other room writing. I really don’t ever feel disconnected to him. And our son is such the spitting image of him. John Michael has never known his father, and he has some of the exact characteristics of Michael. He’s very cerebral. He’s very articulate. He’s a sucker for a great book and research. And he’s a really good writer. Widow turned to Patterson to keep Crichton’s words flowing Sherri Crichton, seen May 21, holds “Eruption,” a book by her late husband, Michael Crichton, and co-authored by James Patterson. WILLY SANJUAN/INVISION By Lindsey Bahr Associated Press Lola’s red hair might have been a mistake. Not the color, mind you. Franka Potente’s electric locks in “Run Lola Run” are as intrinsic to the adrenaline rush of her sprint through Berlin as the film’s heartracing electronic score. Given the choice now, however, Potente would say no to bleaching her hair three times in one day. Still, regrets are few about the film and the whirlwind frenzy of its life-changing success. And when you’re 22 and making an experimental indie with like-minded, convention-defying peers, hair damage is not top of mind. It was just part of the reckless fun of making this wild film about a woman who has 20 minutes to try to collect 100,000 Deutschmarks to save her boyfriend’s life. For its 25th anniversary, Sony Pictures Classics has sent a beautiful 4K restoration of “Run Lola Run” to theaters nationwide. Filmmaker Tom Tykwer even got to fix some of the tiny problems that have bothered him over the years. “It’s now the pristine and super nice ‘perfect’ version of a still beautifully imperfect movie,” he said. This interview with Potente and Tykwer has been edited for clarity and length. Q: This is embarrassing, but I kind of became aware of the movie because I saw a photo of Natalie Portman dressed as Lola at a Halloween Party. Potente: She told me that she did that! I was like, oh my god. Tom has stories like that too. Even today these cool little things surface. Didn’t Gregory Peck’s widow say that Gregory Peck saw and loved “Run Lola Run” before he passed? Those were moments ... Tykwer: I remember we were already shooting “The Princess and the Warrior,” and we were in a hotel in Wuppertal, Germany, and sleeping and the reception calls and says, “I have Dustin Hoffman on the phone.” I’m like, “Ha ha ha, I’m sleeping.” It was the middle of the night, and he had just seen the movie and was completely flipping out, like “I want to be in your next movie.” I said, “We’re already shooting.” And he’s like “Where are you? I’m coming.” “But it’s German language.” “I don’t care.” P: Six months later, he was in Berlin, and I drove him around in my car that had tons of cigarette butts and trash, and he loved it. He was like oh my god this is an adventure, like with these little punks. I was driving a Saab 900, so many cigarette butts and Red Bull cans. T: I made a movie with him seven years later (“Perfume: The Story of a Murderer”). Q: Lola has been so referenced in pop culture, a Bon Jovi music video, an episode of the children’s show “Phineas and Ferb.” Have you seen many? Do you have a favorite? T: “The Simpsons” one is great. It was funny because no one ever asked, and I suddenly saw it watching television. I was like, you even took our music. It was probably better than any awards we could have ever got. Now forever we are in “The Simpsons.” I’ve actually even been in talks about a TV series. If the concept is interesting, why not do it? Either it reminds people of how good our film is or people will be like, “That’s a good variation.” Quoting and remaking and rethinking and reinventing is also what I do as a filmmaker. So, I like it. Even if it fails, I like it. Q: What’s it like watching it on the big screen again? T: I never watch my movies again. Once they’re done, I’m done. The most incredible thing about it is that for any film that you make, there comes a time when you suddenly are really able to watch it as the audience and not as the person that was there all the time. It’s emancipated from you. I’m just older. I’m not the guy anymore who made this film. And I watched it as if I was the audience. It’s so nice. I so enjoyed Franka, who’s so energetically enigmatic and, in this new transfer, glowing in a way. Q: Where do you think “Run Lola Run” fits in cinematic history? T: In the end of the ’90s, there were some quite important films, and I’m happy to say maybe we were one of them. There was stuff like “The Matrix” and a movie like “Man on the Moon,” this really great, strange film that Miloš Forman did with Jim Carrey. At the time, at the turn of the millennium, filmmaking strategy went through a renewal, and I think we were a tiny part of this. The reinvention of television, I think it was ignited by cinema and by the new ways of storytelling. We’re just one — not irrelevant — spark in there. Q: What was the frenzy like around the time of its release? P: It’s comparable to, in my mind, what a musician’s life might be like — like a rock star or a stereotyped idea of what that would be like. And that’s what it was like for probably a year or two. By the time we got an MTV Award, I was like, I’m done. I’m not even going. I didn’t even go and pick it up. I couldn’t. It was just I was like, I’m going to be on the couch. It’s crazy. Why didn’t I go? I should have gone. Q: Were you surprised that it caught on like it did? T: You have to remember it was a small, super independently financed film. It got lots of headscratching from those people who brought money in, like, “It starts three times, that doesn’t make a movie.” One of the things I loved was that it seemed like an action movie, but with a strong emotional center and quite a lot of structural and philosophical substance underneath. I thought you can bring all this together in a movie. It’s why I was mentioning “The Matrix,” which was like the big scale sibling to us. That’s how we all got to know each other, we both reached out and were like, “Who are you and what are you trying?” That’s what the energy was. We never imagined the voyage the movie would take. It was a nerdy, quirky movie that we only made because we loved making it. We were really innocent kids. Maybe that’s part of the beauty and the energy of the film, and why it’s so delightful. I could never do it now. I’m not that person anymore unfortunately. Tykwer never imagined ‘voyage’ film would take Director, star recall whirlwind frenzy of ‘Run Lola Run’ Franka Potente stars in “Run Lola Run.” The film is returning to theaters to mark its 25th anniversary.

YOU GOT THE TOP PULLED DOWN AND RADIO ON, BABY “Traveling: On the Path of Joni Mitchell” (June 11) is the best kind of summer bio. It’s too critical and wandering to read like hero worship. NPR’s Ann Powers, among the smartest of music critics, captures the restlessness of a Mitchell album, walking through her catalog with eyes and ears open for both unease and transcendence. “Hip-Hop is History” (June 11) nails a similar feeling: It’s less like a timeline than a long hang with the Roots’ Questlove, who digs through the classics, offering reminiscence and discernment. FAMILY TIME ‘Tis the season for other people’s problems. “Same as It Ever Was” (June 18), by Oak Park native Claire Lombardo (“The Most Fun We Ever Had”), and “Long Island Compromise” (July 9) by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (“Fleishman Is in Trouble”), check a lot of boxes — relatable but never dull, reliably bonkers family, funny. But they’re also breezy satires of privilege without sacrificing gravitas. Lombardo hems with modesty to the way minor breaks in routine spiral into epic crisis. Brodesser-Akner, who twists her knife with more relish, begins with actual crisis (a mysterious kidnapping and release), then leaps to the surprising ways it stamps fear into each member of the wealthy family. For austerity: “This Strange Eventful History,” Claire Messud’s somewhat autobiographical saga about several generations of a French family, severed from each other during World War II, and the way time and distance become inevitable. TALES OF FUTURE PAST “What the Wild Sea Can Be: The Future of the World’s Ocean” (July 16), by Helen Scales, a marine biologist who doesn’t write like one. Here is a clear-eyed survey of what ails ocean life, shaped by Scales’s own experience and a bracing look at what’s being done. For something completely different: “The Book of Elsewhere” (July 23) is not quite science fiction, or fantasy, but as hard to pin down as you might expect a book authored by British surrealist China Miéville and Keanu Reeves. It’s also fun, a novel-length continuation of Reeves’s hot comic book, “BRZRKR,” a kind of Conan the Barbarian tale with black helicopters. REBEL YELLS “Nat Turner, Black Prophet: A Visionary History” (Aug. 13) begins with what you (might) know: In 1831, an enslaved preacher named Nat Turner led an uprising that was inevitably quashed, yet promised more to come. The late historian Anthony E. Kaye, with Gregory P. Downs, retells this in a fascinating new way, centering Turner’s conviction that he was a vessel of God. “Night Flyer: Harriet Tubman and the Faith Dreams of a Free People” (June 18), by National Book Award-winner Tiya Miles, takes a similar approach to a more familiar American hero: It focuses on Tubman as a spiritual leader and selftaught ecologist. It’s the lyrical biography we’ll need before Tubman — already more myth than person — begins gracing the $20 bill, starting in 2030. CRUEL SUMMER Personally, it’s not summer unless I stretch out with a new Stephen King, and if that sounds familiar: “You Like It Darker,” his latest collection of stories, is among his smartest, yet tipping toward crime tales and the slightly paranormal. The centerpiece, “Danny Coughlin’s Bad Dream,” is a stealth, 140-page mystery novel tucked beside a “Cujo” postscript and the gorgeous “Answer Man,” a late-career classic. For best results: Follow with Harlan Ellison’s “Greatest Hits,” a new compilation of vintage tales that shaped sci-fi and horror, inspiring King and Neil Gaiman (who writes the forward). Sentient AI, dystopias, alien copulation, evil twins … TWO ABSORBING SPORTS BOOKS THAT AREN’T ACTUALLY ABOUT SPORTS Joseph O’Neill’s “Godwin” — like his celebrated 2008 novel “Netherland” — defies quick description. It reads like a fable, opening with the corporate chill of a Pittsburgh office then travels to suburbs of London and soccer fields of Africa. It follows the story of a soccer agent who talks his estranged brother into finding a soccer phenom. “Charlie Hustle: The Rise and Fall of Pete Rose, and the Last Glory Days of Baseball,” by former Chicago journalist Keith O’Brien, would make a nice double-header: It’s not biography but taxonomy, a pungent epic about hubris and, in the figure of the disgraced Cincinnati Red, moral vacancy. IT’S NOT THE HEAT; IT’S THE BRIMSTONE “Craft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil” (June 18), by Chicago-based Ananda Lima has an eye-catching premise — you’re reading a collection of stories by the author following a one-night stand with Satan — so clever, it’s a relief to report that’s merely the hook for a substantive first book of major confidence, and belly laughs. Speak of the devil: Randall Sullivan’s “The Devil’s Best Trick: How the Face of Evil Disappeared” and Ed Simon’s “Devil’s Contract: The History of the Faustian Bargain” (July 9) are ideal histories for the warmest weeks, cultural spelunkings into our centuries-old need to portray unencumbered immorality, from Nathaniel Hawthorne to the ’80s Satanic Panic. ONE LIT LIFE “Norman Maclean: A Life of Letters and Rivers” is part author bio, part literary memoir, told by Rebecca McCarthy, a former student of Maclean who kept a lifelong friendship with the Hyde Park legend, a beloved professor at University of Chicago who — famously, very late in life — wrote “A River Runs Through It.” JUST A DREAM AND THE WIND TO CARRY ME It’s hard to relay how exhilarating, and unsettling, being a speck on the ocean is, with no other specks in sight, horizon to horizon. “Sailing Alone: A Surprising History of Isolation and Survival at Sea,” by maritime historian Richard J. King, gathers dizzying case studies of what drives people to do this, improvising steering systems for sleeping, talking to dolphins out of lonliness. Consider the complicated hero at the heart of Hampton Sides’ excellent best-seller, “The Wide Wide Sea: Imperial Ambition, First Contact and the Fateful Final Voyage of Captain James Cook.” Cook represented the best of global exploration. Until he represented the worst. As forward-thinking as he was with native cultures, he died on a beach in Hawaii, stoned by its people. Sides’s compulsively readable 16th-century history is about the gulf between decency and a boss’s orders. SUMMER ENNUI If you have read Rachel Cusk — and if you haven’t, there’s your summer reading list — you’re safe to assume her latest novel about creative life, “Parade” (June 18), starts with a darkly funny come-on (an artist paints a portrait of his wife, makes it ugly and it sells), only to end up very far afield. “Fire Exit,” the lacerating debut novel by Morgan Talty, whose story set “Night of the Living Rez” was a 2022 critical smash, delves again into the families in a Native American community, for a tale of a man haunted by descendants present and just out of reach. Speaking of haunting: “We Burn Daylight” (July 30), by the underrated novelist Bret Anthony Johnston (“Remember Me Like This”) delivers another thriller less visceral than traumatic: The story of a cult in Waco, Texas, about to be taken by law enforcement, and the drama that unfolds inside and out. (Any similarities to Branch Davidians are purely intentional.) RETHINKING SUMMER PROGRAMMING “Something authentic, buried beneath something fake.” That’s how New Yorker TV writer Emily Nussbaum perfectly explains the allure of both “The Bachelor” and “Candid Camera” in “Cue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV” (June 25). She works magic, walking on that wavering line between fandom and disgust but never scolding. “The Future Was Now: Madmen, Mavericks, and the Epic Sci-Fi Summer of 1982” (July 30), by “Caddyshack” historian Chris Nashawaty, begins with the maxim “Film critics get it wrong all the time,” then proves it. This is Gen-X catnip, a backstage rewind through a momentous movie summer that delivered us “Blade Runner,” “The Thing,” “E.T.,” “The Road Warrior” and far more. SUMMERTIME SADNESS “Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space,” by Adam Higginbotham — whose remarkable “Midnight in Chernobyl” established him as the go-to narrator of tragedies — reads like a backward mystery, starting with the Space Shuttle explosion in 1986, then unwinding through institutional arrogance and the queasy assumption of “acceptable risk” that dooms even the best intentions. Eliza Griswold’s equally immersive “Circle of Hope: A Reckoning with Love, Power and Justice in an American Church” (Aug. 6) documents the conflicts and frayed idealism that pulled a Philadelphia church apart over 30 years, but Griswold — whose “Amity and Prosperity” won the nonfiction Pulitzer in 2019 — grounds much of the story in old-fashioned fly-on-thewall reporting, tagging along until she’s invisible. SUMMER ART FARE At some point this summer, you may duck into the cool marble halls of a museum. “Footnotes from the Most Fascinating Museums,” by New Yorker cartoonist Bob Eckstein, is a lovely wish list of American options, dreamily illustrated, full of histories of the classics (the Art Institute of Chicago), but also battleship museums, Kentucky’s Noah’s Ark, the Rothko Chapel in Texas … “The Work of Art: How Something Comes From Nothing,” by former New York magazine editor Adam Moss, should get you through the rest of summer. Here is a brick of insight into that creative purgatory called the process, featuring notebook scribbles, sketches and chats with Sofia Coppola, Gay Talese, Suzan-Lori Parks and many more artists in far-flung fields. “Dinosaurs at the Dinner Party” (Aug. 6) could be an engrossing anecdote from those books, the story of why history museums are now occupied by creatures none of us have seen. It follows the accidental discoveries that led to piecing together the first dinosaur skeletons, and what that meant for naturalists and clergy alike. ELECTION-YEAR READING THAT ISN’T A CHORE What ails us, Frank Bruni writes in “The Age of Grievance,” isn’t grievance — this is a nation, of course, founded on the stuff. But rather, “a manner of individualism often indistinguishable from narcissism,” fostering “a violent rupture of our national psyche.” It’s an illuminating rant about humility, and one that echoes throughout “The Playbook: A Story of Theater, Democracy and the Making of a Culture War,” by James Shapiro. Here, the history is the birth and death of the New Deal’s Federal Theatre Project, and the question of whether a country so fractious can sustain a national theater. Each chapter, often centered on loathsome political hearings, is part rousing, part enraging. DIPPING INTO THE DEEP END One of the year’s best books is “I Just Keep Talking: A Life in Essays” by Nell Irvin Painter, a digressive, accessible summer course on visual aesthetics (Black Power art), Southern history, Black figures both well-known (Sojourner Truth) and obscure (Alma Thomas), but primarily, the art of writing a pointed essay. “The Art of Dying: Writings 2019-2022” collects the final 46 stories by late New Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl, from his 2019 essay about learning he had advanced lung cancer to his final piece on German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. It’s another art course in a book (with a bonus introduction by Schjeldahl pal Steve Martin). For a decidedly more fun essay: “Any Person Is the Only Self” (June 11), by Elisa Gabbert, which collects her thoughts on Sylvia Plath, Motley Crue, “Point Break,” Proust … I KNOW WHAT YOU READ THIS SUMMER Gabino Iglesias, whose “The Devil Takes You Home” was one of the best books of 2022, summons similar darkness for “House of Bone and Rain” (Aug. 6), returning the author to his native Puerto Rico for more gangs, bad weather and traditions that slowly draw in creepy crawlies. Iglesias is where Paul Tremblay (“Cabin at the End of the World”) was a few years ago. “Horror Movie” (June 11), Tremblay’s latest, is a new jewel, the story of a cursed film, alternating between the screenplay and “the unreality of the entertainment ecosystem” that worships it. (Read before the inevitable horror movie of “Horror Movie.”) SUMMER SLEEPERS “The Swans of Harlem” tells a vibrant, lovingly researched group biography of the 152nd Street Black Ballet Legacy Council, the five Black ballerinas who, at the peak of the civil rights movement, brought new urgency to a segregated art form. “When Women Ran Fifth Avenue” is another unheralded history, a fascinating excavation of the midcentury women — including two Chicagoans, Dorothy Shaver and Geraldine Stutz — whose designs and ideas reinvented American department stores and consumer fashion. In each of these books, a set of women is assembling a world they want. Bringing that history into today: In “Rebel Girl: My Life as a Feminist Punk,” Kathleen Hanna of Le Tigre and Bikini Kil writes about the grassroots Riot Grrrl movement and her fidelity to a low-fi, DIY independent music scene with bluntness, stumbling through the ’90s, loaded with exclusionary politics and hope. cborrelli@chicagotribune. com Borrelli from Page 1 Summer book recommendations include “Night Flyer” by Tiya Miles, “Hip-Hop is History” by Questlove, “Charlie Hustle” by Keith O’Brien, “You Like It Darker” by Stephen King, “Same as it Ever Was” by Claire Lombardo and “A Last Supper of Queer Apostles” by Pedro Lemebel.

Harris The New York Times Chanel Miller has wanted to be a children’s book author and illustrator since the second grade, when she started writing stories that her teacher would laminate. But her first published book, despite being a bestseller and a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, was not at all what she’d wished for. It was a memoir about surviving sexual assault and its aftermath called “Know My Name.” Brock Turner, who had been a Stanford University swimmer, was found guilty of sexually assaulting Miller while she was unconscious after a party on campus in 2015. His sentence, six months in jail, was widely criticized as lenient, and a letter she read to the court at the sentencing hearing was published online and read in Congress. Now, after years trying to raise awareness about sexual assault and trauma, Miller has returned to her original dream with a second book, “Magnolia Wu Unfolds It All.” It’s a work of middle-grade fiction about a girl who plays detective in her family’s laundromat, reuniting misplaced socks with their owners. The “gentle chaos” of her book tour has been a balm, she said, as has been the creation of something that came from herself and not as a reaction to something that happened to her. “April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, so I talked to the American Bar Association; I did fundraising events in Iowa, San Diego, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire,” Miller said. And then, she said, she went right into a book tour for “Magnolia Wu,” speaking at events where some audience members were dressed as characters from Dr. Seuss books. “There was a kid standing up at a microphone to ask a question wearing a Thing One shirt with a blue wig on, little blue hairs blowing in the wind,” she said. She looked at her new friend and wondered: “How did I get here?’ ” For all her somber public appearances, Miller is easy to laugh and quick to crack a joke, and she sees the world in vivid visual metaphors. As a guest on the “CBS Mornings” show in April, perched at a round glass table with the CBS eye logo in the middle, she said she was “honored to be sitting at this giant contact lens of a table.” These playful images appear in her writing as well. Magnolia Wu, the protagonist in her new book, is an almost-10-yearold girl who lives in New York City with her parents. (“She was eager to turn 10,” Miller wrote, “because the number 9 looked like a sprout coming out of the ground, small and easily stomped.”) Magnolia’s parents, originally from China, work at Bing Qi Ling Bubbles Laundromat, where Magnolia expects to spend her summer hanging out with Mister Pants, the family dog, while her mom folds piles of laundry, and her dad makes deliveries. Miller’s mother, who was a writer in China, moved to the United States in her 20s with very limited English proficiency and worked at a dry cleaner and a flower shop, as well as a real estate agent and as an aerobics instructor at a YMCA. Miller’s father is a retired therapist who grew up in Kentucky. They raised Miller and her sister, to whom the book is dedicated, in California. One day, Magnolia’s mother introduces her to a new kid in town named Iris who has just moved from Santa Cruz, California. When Magnolia asks Iris how she likes New York, Iris frowns and says that she saw a dead rat floating in a puddle. In response, Magnolia thinks: “She’s a grass person.” But the girls become friends, spending their time trying to reunite lost socks with their owners, each sock a small mystery: Who would have a sock covered in neon-pink flamingos? Whose socks would be dotted with ice cream cones? Miller had the idea for “Magnolia” in 2020, shortly after she moved to New York City, where her local laundromat had a bulletin board dotted with abandoned socks. Every January, the board was cleared, and the process would start again. “New Yorkers are like little squirrels; you have to seek out so much,” she said. “I’d go get my mail or go get my laundry, all these errands on an endless loop.” Her mood, she said, would be punctuated by the small interactions she’d have along the way, and she’d always come home feeling better than when she left. “Magnolia Wu” is also about getting out into the world, Miller said, even though life is unpredictable. “That’s what my dad would say when I was super depressed,” Miller said. “ ‘Stay in circulation.’ ” While the book is mostly filled with lighthearted humor and delight, it also tackles serious subjects, including anti-Asian racism. The words “go home” are scrawled on the front window of the exercise studio where Iris’ mother teaches. Miller said that at a recent event for “Magnolia Wu,” an Asian American woman approached with tears in her eyes, and Miller assumed that she wanted to talk about “Know My Name,” Miller’s memoir. But the woman had been moved by “Magnolia Wu” and the words “go home.” “In her memoir, which is of course a serious topic, she also manages to inject moments of levity,” said Jill Santopolo, Miller’s editor and publisher of the imprint Philomel. “In this book that is really funny and fun, she manages to beautifully inject moments of depth and really profound thoughts and ideas. In that sense, I think it’s clear to me that it’s the same person who wrote both of these books. It’s someone who is able to write about the darkness and the light in life.” Her two books are indeed different, and that, Miller said, is her perhaps greatest achievement: showing that her painful memoir and this delightful story for children emerged from the same person. “I keep hearing the word ‘departure,’ ” Miller said. “But the word ‘departure’ indicates leaving, and I cannot leave something that’s still inside me,” she continued. “I actually think I’m most proud of embodying both stories, whereas before, I thought the goal was to eagerly leave all that behind.” Miller writes about darkness, light in life Chanel Miller, author of the bestseller “Know My Name,” is seen April 23 in New York. She has wanted to write children’s books since she was a child. LANNA APISUKH/THE NEW YORK TIMES ‘MAGNOLIA WU UNFOLDS IT ALL’ By Chanel Miller; Philomel Books, 160 Pages, $17.99. Painful memoir, delightful kid’s story emerge from same author The subtitle of “Long Haul” is “Hunting the Highway Serial Killers,” but that’s not what it’s really about. Or, at least, not all of the time. Frank Figliuzzi’s book is best when it listens to its subtitle. The former Federal Bureau of Investigation assistant director introduces us to a special FBI unit that, since 2004, has linked more than 850 killings to long-haul truckers. It’s shocking to find out there are so many homicides believed to have been committed by truckers and to realize the problem is grave enough for the FBI to have created the Highway Serial Killings Initiative. Figliuzzi is quick to point out that the vast majority of truckers are law-abiding folks, whose difficult work keeps this country running. But “Long Haul” also gets at the unique aspects of the job that can make its practitioners turn violent: loneliness, sometimes-shadowy regulation, unhealthy hours and more. “Long Haul” contains fascinating information on how some killers have been tracked down, using methods that range from the latest in high-tech criminology to clues left carelessly behind. There would seem to be plenty of information here for a true-crime stunner. But Figliuzzi muddies “Long Haul” by including chapters in which he drives along with a (law-abiding) truck driver, detailing their not-scintillating efforts to load and unload flatbeds. He also delves into the psychology of sex workers who hang out at truck stops, a little-explored subculture that merits its own book. Readers may also be vexed by Figliuzzi’s methodology. The three people quoted most in the book, two truckers and a sex-workerturned-counselor, use pseudonyms. Other sources aren’t named at all. In other words, I spent too much of “Long Haul” wondering about the story behind the story. Figliuzzi has spotlighted a fascinating world that I knew nothing about, and I’m grateful for that. I just wish all of his sources had been with him for the long haul. — Chris Hewitt, Minneapolis Star Tribune Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy’s “Our Kindred Creatures” is a revelatory, beautifully crafted account of the rise of animal-rights activism in the U.S. Born in the aftermath of the Civil War, the movement evolved rapidly, reflecting a tenuously reunited country weary of agony and distress. Wasik, an editor at the New York Times magazine, and Murphy, a veterinarian, paint a vibrant portrait of the movement’s thinkers and doers. At the center were three remarkable figures: Henry Bergh, a patrician repulsed by Spanish bullfights who leveraged his affluence to shape laws; Caroline White of Philadelphia, a brilliant organizer who elevated women to the front ranks; and Boston’s George Angell, “a gifted rhetorician who channeled both the slashing moralism of a newspaperman and the celestial fire of a preacher.” Together, they cobbled the ASPCA, and within six years, chapters thrived in eight of America’s 10 largest cities. Wasik and Murphy rightly connect the ASPCA to reformist currents, from the struggle over racial segregation to women’s suffrage to improved housing and sanitation standards. Angell emerges as the book’s colossus, straddling continents and decades to gather the world’s species into his care. “Our Kindred Creatures” pivots from his death in 1909 to his legacy: the vectors of ASPCA principles into the culture and the persistence of coarse rationalizations for beef consumption. The authors remind us that for all the strides we’ve made to alleviate pain, we must do better: “What would it take to inaugurate a new type of goodness, one that convinced Americans to take seriously their responsibility to the nation’s food animals?” Elegant, meticulous and urgent, “Our Kindred Creatures” is social history at its finest. — Hamilton Cain, Minneapolis Star Tribune NONFICTION REVIEWS Hunt for killers takes some detours ‘LONG HAUL’ By Frank Figliuzzi; Mariner Books, 272 pages, $25.99. ‘OUR KINDRED CREATURES’ By Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy; Knopf, 464 pages, $35. In the beginning was … a lie. One day a rabbi knocked on the door of a woman with a Jewish-sounding last name in a small town in Georgia to recruit new members for his synagogue. When he asks if she knows of any Jews in the area, Ida Mae Belkin admits to being one herself. This comes as a shock to her 12-year-old twins Marty and David, who grew up believing in not much more than the national pastime of TV and fast food. Fast forward some 20 years and Marty, who has become a religious scholar at a Brooklyn yeshiva and goes by the more Jewishsounding name of Mayer, finds out via Ida Mae’s suicide note that she lied, and he and David are not in fact Jewish. That means his marriage to devoutly Orthodox Sarah is effectively null and void since she never would have consented to marry someone outside the faith. What to do? Clearly, the only solution is to convert to Judaism “on the downlow,” as Mayer’s pot-smoking rascal of a brother puts it, and in the meantime, take a road trip through the Deep South to, well, relax. So begins Reuven Fenton’s quirky debut novel, “Goyhood,” which takes the classic literary theme of the journey — think Homer’s “Odyssey” or Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” — and gives it a decidedly unorthodox twist. Over the course of their journey, the brothers will adopt a one-eyed dog, almost get blown up in a fireworks store and eventually scatter Ida Mae’s ashes in the Great Smoky Mountains. David’s good friend Charlayne, an Instagram influencer, wonders if their trip isn’t a kind of rumspringa, the Amish rite of passage when young people are encouraged to break the rules before joining the church. At the beginning of their travels, Mayer defines his “goyhood” — that is, the condition of not being Jewish — as “the state of rebounding from one travesty to the next.” By the end, he has gained a glimmer of understanding about why the wife he adored was always so standoffish about sex. Fenton has written a big-hearted novel about the enduring importance of faith and family. While some of the plot twists are a little meshuga — the Yiddish word for crazy — overall, the book is a lot of fun. — Ann Levin, Associated Press Dymitr is on a personal mission, and it starts with facing the mythical leszy who’s guarding the fern flower as it blooms for the summer solstice. “When Among Crows,” a novella by Veronica Roth — bestselling author of the “Divergent” series — dives into the world of Slavic mythology. A Chicago native tapping into Polish roots, Roth places nightmarish and intriguing creatures alike in the modern-day city. Whether it’s the woodland leszy, the tragic wraith or the vampire-like strzyga, they’ve each found their place among the mortal humans in the bustle of daily life. It’s a world where debts create magic, and Dymitr is about to send a lot of scales tipping. Before long, he has a motley crew of allies. There’s a Polish saying that opens the book: When among crows, you must caw as one. As Dymitr faces various trials, moving closer to his ultimate, secret goal, the curtains are parted, and we see just how many non-crows are hiding among us in plain sight. Their roles in the world are almost as intriguing as Dymitr’s plotline, and could easily make for their own stories, but the novella keeps its focus. When we finally do find out what he’s after, it means so much more for the bonds he has forged to get there. Gruesome yet cavalier, “When Among Crows” has action, romance, family drama, fantasy and a healthy helping of mythology. The story is tight, the lore inviting and the characters fun. Roth knows how to cleanly fit an arc in under 200 pages without feeling rushed. It’s the perfect length for the story, precisely because it leaves you wanting more. — Donna Edwards, Associated Press FICTION REVIEWS Road trip story has unorthodox twist ‘GOYHOOD’ By Reuven Fenton; Central Avenue, 288 pages, $28. ‘WHEN AMONG CROWS’ By Veronica Roth; Tor Books, 176 pages, $19.99.

Although she has a daughter, two stepsons, a nephew and the biological father of the granddaughter she is raising, I’m the only one willing to help. Others are quite able but unwilling due to choosing not to work, refusing to pay child support or falling out over the years. I have agreed to directly deposit a certain amount of money into her account every month, but she consistently asks for more. I’ve suggested she reach out to the others instead of solely relying on me, but she appears to make little effort. I am giving her what I can without wrecking my own financial plans. Do you have any suggestions about how to say “no” to further requests without seeming heartless? — Nurturing Niece Dear Niece: I assume that your concern about the child your aunt is raising is an important part of your motivation to extend ongoing generosity. I agree with your instinct to continue to protect yourself; this is vital. You don’t mention details about your aunt’s work status or spending habits, but you should determine whether she is sending some of your funds out the door to deadbeat relatives. One way to respond when she asks for more funds would be: “Tell me — what else are you doing to raise this money?” Be completely straightforward: “This is the limit to what I can give.” Help her to explore and apply for jobs and social services. Dear Readers: As I announced previously, my final “Ask Amy” column in this space will run June 30. (Readers will be able to find me through my newsletter and at amydickinson. com.) Until then, I’ll occasionally open my files and rerun some previously published Q&As. The following is from 2021. Dear Amy: Is the male “midlife crisis” a real thing? After 20 years of marriage, my “pillar of the community” husband started acting strangely. He started dressing young, going to bars, then quit sleeping at night. When I found out he had an affair, I blew up, and he took off with the young barfly. Our grown daughters and I are hurt and sad that our family life seems over. I thought we had a great marriage and family. Do these men ever come home? I can easily forgive him and go to counseling to get back on track. We had made all kinds of retirement plans before this happened. In addition to being a husband and father, he is my best friend too. — Don’t Know What to Do Dear Don’t Know: Midlife crises are not confined to men. And while these changes can seem very sudden, this is a panicked response to the existential crisis brought on by the realization that one’s life is more than half over. When the “crisis” moment arrives (sometimes prompted by a death in the family, a landmark birthday, children about to leave the nest or job frustration), a person at midlife looks around, sings the old Peggy Lee song, “Is That All There Is?,” and decides that a pumped-up body, a younger partner or a new toy in the garage will fix everything. To quote a moment from one of my favorite movies, “Moonstruck,” the wise wife looks at her philandering husband and declares: “Cosmo, I just want you to know that — no matter what you do, you’re going to die, just like everybody else.” Rather than concentrate your energy on your husband’s behavior and choices, I hope you will take a long look at your own life. Yes, cope with your anger and give yourself the release of forgiving him if you can. Understand that his behavior does not negate the happiness of the 20-year family-building phase of your own life. Quoting Peggy Lee again: “If that’s all there is, my friend, then let’s keep dancing…” I hope you will choose to “dance” again. Dear Amy: “Friendless” lives in a rural area, has a young child and is looking to make friends.
