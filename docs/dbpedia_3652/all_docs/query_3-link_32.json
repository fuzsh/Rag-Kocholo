        "text": "Much-loved actor Bernard Cribbins - the voice and face of childhood TV and film for generations of Britons - has died at the age of 93, it was revealed today - just months after his beloved wife of almost 70 years passed away.\n\nThe death of the British star, who was in many Carry On films, Fawlty Towers, Doctor Who, narrated The Wombles, Jackanory and was in the classic 1970 film adaptation of The Railway Children, has devastated friends and fans.\n\nReturning Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies led the tributes today and declared 'a legend has left the world'. Last October the star was heartbroken when his wife Gillian, who he married in 1955, died. Mr Davies said: 'He loved Gill with all his heart; he mentioned her in every conversation we ever had', calling it a 'love story for the ages'.\n\nThe couple walked down the aisle a year before his breakthrough in a TV adaptation of David Copperfield. They lived in Surrey but had no children having suffered the heartbreak of a series of miscarriages.\n\nBernard said his work on children's TV and films, especially The Railway Children and Jackanory, gave him 'a very warm feeling to think of all those who watched it as a child', and helped him cope with the sadness of not being able to have their own. He said of The Railway Children as he marked his 75th year in showbusiness in 2018: 'If you don't shed a tear when she shouts, 'Daddy, my daddy' you're made of wood. I always well up when I watch it'.\n\nIn an Instagram post Russell T Davies said his friend was as comfortable doing comedy as he was doing sci fi and Shakespeare, revealing Bernard would often turn up on set with a suitcase of props to make the crew laugh including his favourite rubber chicken and regale them with stories about friends from The Beatles to Kylie Minogue and Ashley Banjo.\n\nOldham-born Mr Cribbins, whose mother was a cotton weaver and father was a 'champion clog fighter', became one of the most versatile and popular entertainers of his generation, managing to be a favourite on children's TV while also starring in the bawdy Carry On films. He worked on CBeebies until recently and was due to appear in the new series of Doctor Who next year after filming for a 60th anniversary show with former Time Lord David Tennant, who was seen pushing him in a wheelchair through north London with Catherine Tate on May 16.\n\nA statement from Gavin Barker Associates, his agents, said: 'Beloved actor Bernard Cribbins OBE has passed away at the age of 93.\n\n'His career spanned seven decades with such diverse work ranging from films like The Railway Children and the Carry On series, hit 60s song Right Said Fred, a notorious guest on Fawlty Towers and narrating The Wombles.\n\n'He worked well into his 90s, recently appearing in Doctor Who and the CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat. He lost his wife of 66 years, Gill, last year. Bernard's contribution to British entertainment is without question. He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.'\n\nMr Cribbins, a friend of The Beatles and numerous megastars including David Niven and Peter Sellers, recently put his long life and career down 'good luck and genes'. He was still playing five-a-side football well into his late 80s. And when he turned 90 he said: 'It's just a number' and insisted he would never retire. He joined the Old Rep in Birmingham aged just 14 and enjoyed a 79-year career in showbusiness aside from a spell in the Parachute Regiment after the Second World War.\n\nIn later life, he beat prostate cancer and survived triple heart bypass surgery in 1997. He also suffered a spinal injury that left him unable to walk long distances. This is why his much-loved CBeebies series Old Jack's Boat was filmed with him sat down telling stories of the sea that enthralled young viewers.\n\nDoctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies remembered him as his 'old soldier' who he 'loved', a sentiment shared by the people who worked with him.\n\nAlongside a picture of the veteran actor with his face poking through the hole of a fake brick wall, he wrote: 'Bernard Cribbins (1928-2022) I love this man. I love him. That's him as Snout in A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\n'D'you fancy doing some Shakespeare, Bernard? 'Let me see the script.' He knew everyone! He'd talk about the Beatles and David Niven, and how he once sat on the stairs at a party impersonating bird calls with TH White. Then he'd add 'I said to Ashley Banjo last week...' He loved being in Doctor Who. He said 'Children are calling me grandad in the street!' His first day was on location with Kylie Minogue, but all eyes, even Kylie's, were on Bernard.\n\n'He'd turned up with a suitcase full of props, just in case, including a rubber chicken. And what an actor. Oh, really though, what a wonderful actor. We once took him to the TV Choice Awards and sent him up on his own to collect the award, and the entire room stood up and cheered him. That's a lovely memory. He'd phone up and say 'I've got an idea! What if I attack a Dalek with a paintball gun?!' Okay, Bernard, in it went!\n\n'He loved Gill with all his heart; he mentioned her in every conversation we ever had. A love story for the ages.\n\n'I'm so lucky to have known him. Thanks for everything, my old soldier. A legend has left the world.'\n\nActor Mark Gatiss has said 'there was no one quite like' Bernard Cribbins. Gatiss, a writer for Doctor Who in which Cribbins starred, tweeted: 'There was no one quite like Cribbins.'\n\n'A gifted comic actor with an incredible seam of pathos and real heart.\n\n'From Sellers to Star Turn, Wombles to Wilf. I once gushed to him about his lovely performance in Hammer's She. That afternoon he was off to play 5 aside - aged almost 90'.\n\nBorn in Oldham, Cribbins was revered for his versatility and became a favourite with young audiences all over the country as the narrator of The Wombles, as well as for more than 100 appearances on the children's favourite, Jackanory.\n\nAfter appearing on stage for many years, Cribbins made his film debut in 1957's Davy, before going on to work alongside some of British cinema's biggest names in films such as Two-Way Stretch, She, Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD, the 1967 version of Casino Royale and Frenzy.\n\nHe also starred in several Carry On movies and had roles in TV favourites Coronation Street and the revamped Doctor Who.\n\nOff-screen Cribbins enjoyed a successful musical career and had a number of hit records including 1962 comedy songs, Hole In The Ground and Right Said Fred, both of which reached the UK singles chart top 10.\n\nArguably one of the roles he is most famous for was as station porter Albert Perks in The Railway Children, released in 1970.\n\nThe film adaptation of E Nesbit's book chronicles the adventures of three children forced to move from London to Yorkshire after their father is imprisoned for being falsely accused of selling state secrets.\n\nThe film also starred a young Jenny Agutter and famously featured the tear-jerking moment at the film's climax when Agutter's character cries 'daddy, my daddy' as they are reunited on a train platform. Cribbins played the station porter Albert Perks.\n\nIn 2011 he received an OBE for services to drama for his long career. Speaking at the investiture ceremony, he said providing the voices of characters such as Uncle Bulgaria, Tobermory and Orinoco was simple because of how The Wombles was written.\n\nDoctor Who actress Georgia Tennant, who is also the daughter of fifth Doctor Peter Davison and wife of 10th Doctor David Tennant, posted a short tribute on Instagram.\n\nShe said: 'There aren't many people in this world who inspire you to name multiple kids after them. That's how magic Bernard was.'\n\nA message posted on the official Doctor Who Twitter page added: 'We are extremely saddened to learn of the passing of Bernard Cribbins.\n\n'Known best to Doctor Who fans as the Doctor's friend and Donna's grandad Wilfred Mott, Bernard leaves behind a long legacy in film and TV.'\n\nFigures from Cribbins' time as a children's TV presenter also shared their memories of him.\n\nDame Floella Benjamin tweeted: 'I adored working with £BernardCribbins back in the 80's.\n\n'He was a creative genius, great storyteller and knew just how to communicate with an audience. He has left a lasting legacy.'\n\nOne of his most memorable stage roles was playing Moonface Martin in Anything Goes alongside Elaine Paige at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1989.\n\nMusical theatre star Paige said: 'I'm so very sad. My dear pal Bernard Cribbins has died. We met on Anything Goes & kept our 'Friendship' for over 33 yrs.\n\n'A very special man of many talents. Funny, kind, genuine, always had a smile on his face & a quip. One of the good guys. I will miss him so very much.'\n\nSir Tim Rice, the lyricist best known for his work on shows such as Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat with Andrew Lloyd Webber, also remembered Cribbins for his turn in Anything Goes.\n\nHe tweeted: 'RIP Bernard Cribbins. Brilliant film/theatre actor. Lovely chap.\n\n'Got to know him co-producing Anything Goes w/@elaine-paige (rare example of my co-production that didn't lose a packet).\n\n'BC a brill Moonface Martin. And his great hit records...Hole in The Ground, Right Said Fred.'\n\nThere were also tributes from the world of music, with artists such as Boy George and the 1990s band Right Said Fred, who named themselves after his hit novelty song, sharing their memories online.\n\n'The structure of the writing was such that you knew exactly where everybody was socially in that household,' he said.\n\nHe went on to regularly appear in the Doctor Who TV series as Wilfred Mott, the grandfather of the Doctor's companion Donna Noble, played by Catherine Tate.\n\nVoyage Of The Damned, which was broadcast on Christmas Day in 2007, saw 13.31 million people tune in to watch the then-Doctor, David Tennant, battle to save the crew of a luxury space liner called the Titanic.\n\nCribbins featured in the episode alongside special guests including Kylie Minogue, Geoffrey Palmer, Clive Swift and Russell Tovey.\n\nHe also had the lead role in CBeebies show Old Jack's Boat and in the 1960s narrated the Tufty Fluffytale series of public information films about road safety.\n\nMore recently, reports said Cribbins had been spotted filming alongside Tate and Tennant for Doctor Who's 60th anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe extraordinary career of national treasure who 'did a bit of everything': Bernard Cribbins starred in classics from Doctor Who to The Wombles and said his work on The Railway Children helped him cope with sadness of not having children with love of his life\n\nBernard Cribbins was one of the most versatile and popular entertainers of his generation, managing to be a favourite on children's TV while also starring in the bawdy Carry On films - but his great love was always his wife Gill.\n\nHe could turn his hand to virtually any aspect of showbusiness, from Shakespeare to pantomime, from soap operas to pop music.\n\nHis diverse talents ensured he was always in demand, regardless of whether the role called for a straight or comedic performer, and during the 1970s and '80s he was never far from TV screens.\n\nCribbins, who has died at the age of 93, was particularly known for his work on The Railway Children and Jackanory.\n\nDame Floella Benjamin, a doyen of children's TV, described him as a 'treasure for our nation's children'.\n\nBernard Cribbins was born in Oldham in December 1928, to First World War veteran father John Edward and mother Ethel.\n\nAfter leaving school at the age of 13, he entered the world of showbiz and joined the Oldham Repertory Theatre, where he would stay for eight years, during which he fitted in his National Service with the Parachute Regiment.\n\nAfter more repertory work in London, Liverpool and Manchester, he made his West End debut in 1956, playing tghe two Dromios in A Comedy Of Errors.\n\nThis paved the way for more comedy stage roles, while Cribbins was also flexing his creative muscles in other areas.\n\nHis film work around this time include 1963's The Wrong Arm Of The Law, which also starred Peter Sellers, as well as two Carry On films - Jack and Spying, the latter marking Dame Barbara Windsor's first entry in the franchise.\n\nCribbins also appeared in 1992's Carry On Columbus, the final film in the series.\n\nAnd he was proving that acting was not his only talent.\n\nHis comedy singles Hole In The Ground and Right, Said Fred both made the top 10, while Gossip Calypso was another top 30 hit.\n\nHe remained enduringly proud of his musical output and in 2009 told the PA news agency: 'Hole In The Ground... here's a little story for you - Noel Coward chose it as one of his Desert Island Discs.\n\n'He chose it as the only record if he could only have one.'\n\nCribbins had a small role in 1967 Bond parody film Casino Royale before landing the role for which he is perhaps most famous.\n\nIn 1970 he starred in the film adaptation of The Railway Children, playing station porter Albert Perks.\n\nOn TV, he was the narrator of all 60 episodes of The Wombles, and made no fewer than 111 appearances on the children's storytelling show Jackanory.\n\nWhile becoming a well-known face to younger viewers, Cribbins continued to appear regularly in more adult-orientated shows.\n\nHis later roles included Dalziel And Pascoe, Last Of The Summer Wine and Coronation Street.\n\nAnd in 2006 came a return to the Doctor Who universe, after he had played a companion to the Time Lord in 1966 film Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD.\n\nHe played Wilfred Mott in the show's 2007 Christmas special alongside David Tennant as the Doctor and Kylie Minogue as his companion.\n\nAnother appearance came in the two-part Doctor Who specials of 2009-10.\n\nThere was talk that he had been overlooked as a possible Doctor in his younger years but when asked he deflected the question with his typical wit.\n\nHe said: 'I think I wasn't tall enough. That was it. I'd have been tripping over that scarf all the time.'\n\nCribbins, who played a spoon salesman opposite John Cleese in Fawlty Towers as well as working with Alfred Hitchcock on 1972 thriller Frenzy, was made an OBE in 2011 for services to drama.\n\nThree years later he was honoured with the JM Barrie Award for his work on children's TV.\n\nThe then-director of BBC children's programmes, Joe Godwin, said: 'Bernard has been a big part of so many of our childhoods.'\n\nCribbins returned to the storytelling format with pre-school series Old Jack's Boat in 2013, giving a new generation the gift of his skills as raconteur.\n\nThe actor was cast in a remake Dad's Army, to play the part of Private Godfrey, but was replaced by Timothy West when Cribbins stepped down from the role due to personal reasons.\n\nWorking well into his 80s, Cribbins said: 'I love it. I can't stop. Why should I?'\n\nCribbins married wife Gill in 1955 but, for a man loved by generations of children, it was a painful twist of fate that the couple could not have any of their own.\n\n'We lost one quite early on and that was the only time we got near it,' he told the Mirror in 2018.\n\n'That was a long time ago now. It's just one of those things and I consider myself very fortunate to have been given a job like Jackanory, which has been wonderfully popular and gives you a very warm feeling to think of all those who watched it as a child.'\n\nIn May reports said the actor had been seen on set filming alongside David Tennant and Catherine Tate for Doctor Who's 60th anniversary celebrations next year.\n\nCribbins' wife of 66 years, Gill, died in 2021."
