        "text": "Hello everyone.\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ blog and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley.\n\nNot only has David Warner passed away recently, but so has Bernard Cribbins. ðŸ˜¦ Iâ€™m saddened Bernard Cribbins is no longer with us. I saw him recently on the big screen when checking out the two â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ films with Peter Cushing as well as 1970â€™s â€˜The Railway Childrenâ€™ on Prime Video.\n\nIn â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ circles, Bernard Cribbins played Tom Campbell in â€˜Daleksâ€™ Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.â€™ back in 1966. Most notably, heâ€™s well-known for playing Wilfred Mott in the new â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ series with David Tennantâ€™s Doctor. Iâ€™ve enjoyed watching Bernard Cribbins as an actor over the years. ðŸ™‚\n\nI was lucky to meet Bernard Cribbins at two conventions, including the â€˜Cardiff Film & Comic Conâ€™ in March 2014 and the â€˜London Comic Con Springâ€™ in March 2019. I was in awe of Bernard at those conventions and Iâ€™m lucky to have had photos with him, including one with him and Jacqueline King.\n\nIâ€™m also lucky to have had my CD cover of the â€˜Beautiful Chaosâ€™ audiobook signed by him. ðŸ™‚ As well as â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ and 1970â€™s â€˜The Railway Childrenâ€™, Iâ€™ve also enjoyed Bernard in the â€˜Fawlty Towersâ€™ episode â€˜The Hotel Inspectorsâ€™. It was also nice to see him on the big screen in the 2018 film â€˜Patrickâ€™.\n\nBernard Cribbins has reprised his role of Wilfred Mott in the Big Finish audio â€˜No Placeâ€™. Heâ€™s also been in the Big Finish audio â€˜Horror of Glam Rockâ€™ with Paul McGann. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing Bernard again as Wilfred with David Tennant and Catherine Tate for â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™s 60th anniversary.\n\nIt should be a nice and fitting tribute for a legendary actor whoâ€™s been loved by many people. Like David Warner, Bernard Cribbins always came across as very enthusiastic in any role that he played. I cherish fond memories of him as an actor both in â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ as well as other film/TV productions.\n\nMy prayers and thoughts go out to all of those who are the friends and family of Bernard Cribbins.\n\nCheck out the BBC News tribute to Bernard Cribbins â€“ https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62330478\n\nThanks for reading, everyone.\n\nBye for now.\n\nTim"
