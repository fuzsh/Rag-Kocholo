        "text": "The British actor and singer Bernard Cribbins, who has died from prostate cancer aged 93, was a much-loved celebrity in the world of British entertainment. Known for his appearances in many comedy films and TV programmes, he was also a fine dramatic actor as well as the voice of several animated television series. Who doesn't remember him as the porter Albert Perks in The Railway Children, or as Lennie in Two-Way Stretch, or Mr Hutchinson in Fawlty Towers? He narrated The Wombles adventures, told stories on Jackanory and, to cap it all, he was even in Doctor Who both on television and on film. He recorded several story albums and had success with records of the comic songs 'Hole in the Ground', 'Right Said Fred' and the 'Gossip Calypso'.\n\nBernard Joseph Cribbins was born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of World War I veteran John Cribbins and his wife, cotton weaver Ethel. Inspired by his father's interest in acting, Bernard became assistant stage manager at a local theatre club and also acted in small roles, eventually joining Oldham Rep before doing his National Service. In 1956 he made his West End debut in Julian Slade’s musical version of A Comedy of Errors and worked for Ray Cooney in Not Now Darling, There Goes the Bride and Run for Your Wife.\n\nHis first film was Yangtse Incident in 1957 with Richard Todd, followed by Davy with Harry Secombe and Leslie Norman's Dunkirk (1958). He went on to make comedies with Arthur Askey and Tommy Steele and appeared with Peter Sellers in Two-Way Stretch. He did make some dramatic films but mainly specialised in comedies such as The Fast Lady, The Wrong Arm of the Law, The Mouse on the Moon and a trio of Carry On films. He was in Hammer's She and, as well as Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 AD, he appeared in the first version of Casino Royale in 1967.\n\nBernard Cribbins will always be known for playing Albert Perks, the porter in The Railway Children, which was followed by an appearance in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy. He was the voice of Eel in The Water Babies and was Gertrude Stein in the Swedish comedy The Adventures of Picasso. He made the first TV version of Leslie Thomas's Dangerous Davies and for television was the narrating voice of The Wombles, Dennis and Gnasher and The Canterbury Tales, as well as appearing in The Plank, Worzel Gummidge, Last of the Summer Wine, Coronation Street and Doctor Who.\n\nBernard Cribbins met his future wife Gillian McBarnet at Oldham Rep and they were married from 1955 until her death in 2021. They had no children, a great sadness to the actor. Cribbins was honoured with a special Bafta award in 2009 for his work for children's television, and received an OBE in 2011. Constable published his autobiography Bernard Who?: 75 Years of Doing Just About Anything which he also recorded as an audiobook.\n\nMICHAEL DARVELL"
