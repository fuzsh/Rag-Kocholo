        "text": "Bernard Cribbins was pictured filming what would become his final ever scenes for Doctor Who weeks before his death.\n\nThe veteran actor, who narrated The Wombles and starred in the film adaptation of The Railway Children and Doctor Who, passed away at the age of 93, his agent has confirmed on Thursday.\n\nBernard starred as Catherine Tate's on-screen grandfather Wilfred Mott and reunited with her and David Tennant for the 60th anniversary.\n\nHe was pictured in Camden, London, on May 16 this year filming scenes for the long-running show.\n\nIn the pictures, Bernard was seen sitting in a wheelchair while David wheeled him through the area towards the TARDIS.\n\nBernard wore a flat cap and donned a brown jacket as the cast filmed scenes for the BBC show.\n\nCatherine was also on set for those scenes, and at one point, there was a dramatic moment in filming where the coffee stand bursts out in flames while people ran.\n\nFollowing Bernard's death, his agent released a statement which said: “Beloved actor Bernard Cribbins OBE has passed away at the age of 93.\n\n“His career spanned seven decades with such diverse work ranging from films like The Railway Children and the Carry On series, hit 60s song Right Said Fred, a notorious guest on Fawlty Towers and narrating The Wombles.\n\n“He worked well into his 90s, recently appearing in Doctor Who and the CBeebies series Old Jack’s Boat.\n\nGet all the biggest showbiz news straight to your inbox.

He was unique, typifying the best of his generation, and will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him.”\n\nHis colleagues, friends and fans paid tribute to the actor, with Russel T Davies taking to his Instagram to share 'how lucky' he is to have known him.\n\nAfter sharing some memories he had with Bernard, the Doctor Who showrunner wrote: \"I’m so lucky to have known him. Thanks for everything, my old soldier. A legend has left the world.\"\n\nActress Kathy Burke took to Twitter to mourn his passing, captioning a collection of pictures of Bernard: \"Simply wonderful Bernard Cribbins RIP.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
