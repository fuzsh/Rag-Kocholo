        "text": "You may not be happy with Paramount's lack of supplementary content on their discs (although we do get a trailer on The Tenant), but it's hard to fault their efforts on their film transfers. The subdued (some might say drab) colours of the film are well rendered and shadow detail is very good for the most part. There is perhaps a touch more edge effects apparent than other recent Paramount discs, but it's not obtrusive. The Dolby Digital mono tracks (English and French) are quite adequate for the job. English sub-titles are provided.\n\nNew Classic Release Announcements\n\nAs we head into summer, the stream of new classic release announcements has diminished only a bit and we are getting some confirmations of previously rumoured titles, particularly from Warner Brothers. Let's start with them this time (and note that the Classic Release Database has been updated accordingly).\n\nWarner Brothers will release two-disc special editions of The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), and Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) on September 30th.\n\nAs previously posted here on The Digital Bits, The Adventures of Robin Hood: Special Edition will include the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, along with Dolby Digital mono audio. Extras on Disc One will include audio commentary by author and film historian Rudy Behlmer, a music-only audio track showcasing the Oscar-winning score, Warner Night at the Movies 1938 (introduced by Leonard Maltin, which includes the theatrical trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces, a vintage newsreel, the original musical short subject Freddie Rich and His Orchestra and the vintage animated short Katnip Kollege) and an Errol Flynn trailer gallery with trailers for twelve of his most beloved films including Captain Blood, The Prince and the Pauper, Dodge City, The Sea Hawk, Dive Bomber and The Adventures of Robin Hood (both the 1938 version and 1942 reissue). Disc Two includes the hour-long Glorious Technicolor documentary (narrated by Angela Lansbury), the all-new 65th Anniversary documentary, Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of The Adventures of Robin Hood, the classic Looney Tunes shorts Rabbit Hood and Robin Hood Daffy, the vintage Warner Bros. short subjects Cavalcade of Archery (1945) and The Cruise of the Zaca (1952) with Errol Flynn, the Robin Hood Through the Ages featurette (on the various screen adaptations), the A Journey to Sherwood Forest featurette (with home movies and behind-the-scenes footage), outtakes, the Breakdowns of 1938 Warner Bros. Pictures blooper reel, audio of the May 11, 1938 National Radio Broadcast The Robin Hood Radio Show, audio of Erich Wolfgang Korngold piano sessions and still galleries of historical art, costume designs, scene concept drawings, cast & crew photos and publicity & poster materials.\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre: Special Edition will also include the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, along with Dolby Digital mono audio. Extras on Disc One will include audio commentary by author/Bogart biographer Eric Lax, Warner Night at the Movies 1948 (introduced by Leonard Maltin, which includes the theatrical trailer for Key Largo, a vintage newsreel, the original short subject So You Want to Be a Detective, and the Looney Tunes animated short Hot Cross Bunny) along with a Humphrey Bogart trailer gallery with trailers for twelve of his most beloved films including High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep and The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Disc Two adds the feature-length 1989 documentary John Huston: The Man, the Movies, the Maverick, the all-new Discovering Treasure: The Story of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre documentary, the Looney Tunes animated short 8 Ball Bunny, audio of the scoring stage sessions for the film, audio of the April 18, 1949 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast and still galleries of storyboards, dressed set stills, cast & crew photos and publicity & poster materials.\n\nAnd finally, the Yankee Doodle Dandy: Special Edition will also include the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, along with Dolby Digital mono audio. Extras on Disc One will include audio commentary by author and film historian Rudy Behlmer, Warner Night at the Movies 1942 (introduced by Leonard Maltin, which includes the theatrical trailer for Casablanca, a vintage newsreel, the original short subject Beyond the Line of Duty, the Looney Tunes animated short Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid) as well as a James Cagney trailer gallery with trailers for seven of his most beloved films including A Midsummer Night's Dream, Footlight Parade and Yankee Doodle Dandy. Disc Two adds the James Cagney: Top of the World biographical tribute documentary (hosted by Michael J. Fox), the all-new Let Freedom Sing!: The Story of Yankee Doodle Dandy production documentary, the Looney Tunes shorts Yankee Doodle Daffy and Yankee Doodle Bugs, the vintage wartime short You, John Jones starring James Cagney & Greer Garson, audio of outtakes and rehearsals, audio of the October 19, 1942 Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater Radio Show with film cast members and still galleries of sheet music, dressed set stills, scene concept drawings and publicity & poster materials.\n\nLooney Tunes fans can rejoice on October 28th when WB releases The Looney Tunes Golden Collection.

Devil May Hare\n\nConfirming earlier news, due on October 21st from WB are The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953, fullscreen), The Valley of Gwangi (1969, anamorphic), and The Black Scorpion (1957, fullscreen) all with featurettes and trailers added. Then on November 4th, great news for Bogart fans. We'll get Dark Passage (1947), High Sierra (1941), They Drive by Night (1940), and To Have and Have Not (1944), each with new transfers, making-of featurettes, outtakes, vintage cartoons, and so on.\n\nThe results of the online poll that WB conducted indicate that on January 6th, 2004, the following films will be released on DVD: Days of Wine and Roses (1962), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Where the Boys Are (1960), and The Wind and the Lion (1975). The films will be newly remastered and restored. Extras have not yet been announced, but Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will include both the 1932 Paramount and 1941 MGM versions.\n\nColumbia has announced an August 19th release date for Cover Girl (1944) with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. It will sport the company's usual high definition remaster, but will have minimal supplements. On September 9th, we'll get a superbit edition of Lawrence of Arabia and a David Lean 3-pack consisting of a repackaging of Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and A Passage to India. For September 23rd release, In Cold Blood (1967) and The Bedford Incident (1965) will get new anamorphic widescreen transfers. Trailers will be the only extras.\n\nDisney has confirmed the December 2nd release of the third wave of its Walt Disney Treasures line. Titles are: The Chronological Donald, Walt Disney on the Front Lines, Walt Disney's Tomorrowland, and Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume 2. The Chronological Donald presents all of the 36 shorts starring Donald from Donald and Pluto in 1936 to Chef Donald in 1941. Mickey Mouse In Living Color, Volume 2 covers 21 Mickey shorts from 1939 to 1995. Walt Disney on the Front Lines documents the 32 training, propaganda and educational films Walt created over the years, as well as his contributions to the war effort. Finally, Walt Disney's Tomorrowland is a compilation of the six Disneyland TV episodes that focused on outer space and space travel.\n\nFox's previously announced September 2nd release of Titanic (1953) as part of its Studio Classics line will feature a remastered transfer along with an audio commentary, new documentary, movietone newsreels, restoration comparison, still gallery, and the theatrical trailer. Fox will apparently release a box set called Studio Classics: The Best Picture Collection on October 14th. This will include All About Eve, Gentleman's Agreement, How Green Was My Valley, and Sunrise. For 2004, Fox is in the very early planning stages for a 35th anniversary edition of Planet of the Apes (1969). Titles rumoured to be in Fox's plans for the future (2004) include The Black Swan, Call Me Madam, Cheaper by the Dozen and its sequel Belles on their Toes, The Diary of Anne Frank, I Was a Male War Bride, and Peyton Place.\n\nMGM will issue a new two-disc special edition of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) on November 25th. This new 35th Anniversary Edition includes a remastered anamorphic widescreen version, a new documentary hosted by star Dick Van Dyke, archival cast interviews and a number of other features including a 32-page collectible booklet.\n\nParamount has announced the Albert Finney version of Scrooge (1970) for a September 23rd release with a new anamorphic widescreen transfer and Dolby Digital 5.1 remix. The film's original stereo mix will also be included. On October 28th, The Italian Job (1969) is scheduled. The rumoured Once Upon a Time in the West: Special Collector's Edition (1968) is apparently set for November. Disc One will include the 165-minute version of the film, in anamorphic widescreen video with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, a cleaned-up mono mix, and an audio commentary track. Disc Two will include three documentaries on the film, along with a shorter piece on the impact of the railroad in the Old West. The three main documentaries cover such subjects as director Sergio Leone's career, background on the film, the writing and casting process, the location shoot, the style of the film (both cinematographically and other), the film's impact on the Western genre and more. Also featured in the documentary are new interviews with John Carpenter, John Milius, Alex Cox, Claudia Cardinale, Bernardo Bertolucci, Gabriele Ferzetti, cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli, Leone biographer, film historian Sir. Christopher Frayling (author of the excellent book Sergio Leone: Something to Do with Death) and more. Also apparently in the works are The Out-of-Towners (1970), The Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1972), Plaza Suite (1971), and Star Spangled Girl (1971) for November. For December, The Great Gatsby (1974), Hud (1963), and This Property is Condemned (1966) are likely.\n\nUniversal has taken the hint and will release the original version of Scarface (1932) along with a new special edition of the vastly inferior Al Pacino Scarface remake (1983) on September 30th. But, in a move of monumental stupidity and a definite slap in the face to classic film fans, the original version will apparently only be available in a deluxe gift set that includes both films and retails at a ridiculous price.\n\nAs for the independents...\n\nCriterion will offer Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water (1962) on September 23rd. It will include a new high-definition fullscreen transfer, Polish DD 1.0 mono audio, new English subtitle translation by Roman Polanski, a video interview with Polanski and co-screenwriter Jerzy Skolimowski, and collection of rare publicity and production stills. On the same date, Criterion will also release The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941). The disc will offer a new high-definition fullscreen transfer, DD mono audio, an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder and author Steven C. Smith, a video comparison between The Devil and Daniel Webster and William Dieterle's preview version of the film titled Here Is a Man, the Columbia Workshop's radio dramatizations of Stephen Vincent Benét's stories The Devil and Daniel Webster and Daniel Webster and the Sea Serpent both with music by Bernard Herrmann, a gallery of behind-the-scenes photos and promotional materials, and a new essay by author Tom Piazza (Blues and Trouble: Twelve Stories).\n\nElite will add a third release to its \"Drive-in\" discs line on August 5th with the double bill of I Bury the Living (1958, with Richard Boone) and The Hand (1960, with Derek Farr). There will also be film shorts and other drive-in extras included.\n\nImage Entertainment will offer a triple bill of The Atomic Brain (1963), Love After Death (1968), and The Incredible Petrified World (1960) on September 16th. Four Frank Capra-directed science documentaries combining live and animated footage will be released on two discs on September 30th. The titles are Frank Capra's Wonders of Life: Hemo the Magnificent/Unchained Goddess (1956) and Frank Capra's Wonders of Life: Our Mr. Sun/Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays (1957). Two previously-announced titles in the Gene Autry Collection are confirmed for September 30th: Gaucho Serenade (1940) and Robin Hood of Texas (1947).\n\nKoch International released two box sets on July 22nd. The Laurel and Hardy Collection will consist of 5 discs, but exact content is not known to me. It will presumably consist of the usual public domain titles. The Bob Hope 100th Anniversary Set will include Road to Bali, My Favourite Brunette, Bob Hope on TV, Bob Hope at the Movies, Young Bob Hope, and Bob Hope and Friends. The latter four are presumably all compilations, and likely originally developed for TV.\n\nMilestone (via Image) will release a new two-disc set of 1925 classic The Phantom of the Opera on September 9th. This newly-remastered edition is from a new 35mm print, complete with the restored Technicolor masked ball sequence. The set will include both the original 1925 110-minute version with score by Jon Mirsalis and the 1929 98 minute reedit with a stereo soundtrack by Carl Davis and the original mono theatrical track. Other extras include an audio commentary by film historian Scott MacQueen, the Carla Laemmle Remembers featurette, nine additional dialogue sequences from the 1929 version, interviews with cinematographer Charles Van Enger and historian David Skal, the Faust Opera Extract from the 1929 Tiffany Sound Feature presentation, and still galleries detailing deleted and missing scenes and trailers for both he 1925 and 1930 releases.\n\nAlpha Video has its usual storm of releases, this time for August 19th and September 16th. Rather than go through a lengthy list of the titles (some of which duplicate titles available from other public domain specialists), I suggest that you check them out for yourselves in the date base or at www.oldies.com. There are some seldom-seen films that may be of interest such as the 1934 version of The Scarlet Letter (with Colleen Moore), Hell's House (1932, with Bette Davis), and Shriek in the Night (1933, with Ginger Rogers). Once again, though, with Alpha it's buyer beware as to transfer quality.\n\nWith regard to older television series, A&E Home Video has announced The Saint Megaset for release on July 29th. This is a 14-DVD set featuring all 47 colour episodes (1966-1968) of the Roger Moore series. Bonus features include original trailers, the history of The Saint, a Moore biography/filmography, and still galleries. Paramount releases I Love Lucy: Season One, Volume 9 on September 23rd and The Honeymooners: The Original TV Series on October 28th. Among Alpha Video's August and September offerings there are a couple of discs of episodes from the original Dragnet series, one disc of episodes from the One Step Beyond series, and some Jack Benny Show and Racket Squad material.\n\nIn R2 news, a new label from BBC Worldwide, \"Partner Entertainment\", launched on June 30th with the release of 6 classic movies: The Day of the Triffids (1962, with Howard Keel), Fiend without a Face (1958, with Marshall Thompson), Magic Town (1947, with James Stewart), The Stars Look Down (1939, with Michael Redgrave), Thunder Rock (1942, with Michael Redgrave), and The Young Stranger (1957, with James MacArthur). A Fistful of Dynamite will appear from MGM on July 12th. Warners will release an On the Buses DVD triple feature on August 4th. On the Buses (1971), Mutiny on the Buses (1972), and Holiday on the Buses (1973) are included. On the same date, Warners will also have two other double feature discs. The first combines Steptoe and Son (1971) and Steptoe and Son Ride Again (1972) while the second combines two Frankie Howerd films Up Pompeii (1971) and Up the Chastity Belt (1971). On August 25th, Anchor Bay U.K. will release the Roman Polanski Box Set, which will include Cul de Sac, Knife in the Water, Repulsion, and a collection of Polanski short films. The latter will probably be available exclusively in the box set while the others will also be available individually. Eureka Video will release the 1920 version of Der Golem on September 22nd, fully restored and remastered. Artificial Eye is apparently planning to release several Robert Bresson films in the future, but there are no content or timing details as yet. Included will be A Man Escaped (1957) and possibly Pickpocket (1959), as well as a few post-1970 titles.\n\nWell that's it for now. I'll be back with another column soon, but in the meantime, enjoy the summer.\n\nBarrie Maxwell\n\nbarriemaxwell@thedigitalbits.com"
