Just remember blu ray.com is an american site & they don't like 50Hz stuff :rolleyes: It's not perfect but even blown up to 2560 x 1080 (top & bottom cropped) the picture is pretty incredible with the right equipment... Sound is as good as you'll get :eyebrows: \n \nNot enough time for other stuff as i need to be up early :doh: Just watching the first part on disc",
