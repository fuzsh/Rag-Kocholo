        "text": "Christmas Special: The End of Time, Pt. 1\n\nIt's the Tenth Doctor's final journey - but his psychotic nemesis the Master has been reborn, on Christmas Eve. With both determined to cheat death, the battle ranges from the wastelands of London to the mysterious Immortality Gate. Meanwhile, the alien race Ood warn of an even greater danger approaching, as a terrible shadow falls across the entire Universe.\n\nThe Stolen Earth\n\nEarth's greatest heroes assemble in a time of dire need. But can the Doctor's secret army defeat the might of the new Dalek Empire? With battles on the streets and in the skies, the Doctor and Donna must brave the Shadow Proclamation to find out the truth. However, a fearsome old enemy waits in the shadows.\n\nChristmas Special: The End of Time, Pt. 2\n\nThe Doctor faces the end of his life as the Master's plans hurtle out of control. With the sound of drums growing louder, and an ancient trap closing around the Earth, the Doctor and Wilf must fight alone. But sacrifices must be made, and the deadly prophecy warns: \"He will knock four times.\"\n\nIn Which Gavin Hinchcliffe Loses the Gulf Stream\n\nMildly intrigued by the sight of a man skiing on a van roof, the men's interest is heightened when they realise it is an old school pal who was renowned for his eccentricity.\n\nTurn Left\n\nDonna's entire world collapses, but there's no sign of the Doctor. Instead, she finds help from a mysterious blonde woman - a traveller from a parallel universe. But as Donna and Rose Tyler combine forces, are they too late to save the whole of creation from the approaching darkness?"
