I then pondered on where you begin and what to choose in my tribute to this actor. who worked with many big names on and off the screen. Just a few of these can be listed as Doctor Who (1963-) – in both an Amicus movie, Daleks’ Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966) and the TV series from 2007 to 2010 -, the Carry on team and with the director, Alfred Hitchcock in his penultimate film, Frenzy (1972).\n\nThis choice was surprisingly easy to answer and here are just some of my childhood memories of this actor from 1970s children’s TV and movies.\n\nThe Railway Children (1970)…\n\nTHE RAILWAY CHILDREN – Beloved family classic returns to cinemas, Studio Canal\n\nThe Railway Children (1970) is one of those rainy day, Bank Holiday British favourites for kids of all ages. The film is about the three Waterbury kids, Bobbie ((Roberta) aka Jenny Agutter), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) who live in splendour in a lovely house near London. They have a doting mother (Dinah Sheridan) and a father (Iain Cuthbertson) who works for the foreign office.\n\nOne night, the children hear raised voices, and their father is taken away. Their mother doesn’t tell them the truth behind this happening. Then they become poor and have to downsize and move to a house in the country. This house is next to a railway station in Yorkshire. Cue adventures of all sorts in this coming-of-age story based on the E. Nesbit children’s book.\n\nThis includes the kids warning a train driver of an upcoming calamity with the girls using their petticoats to wave the flag down, a beguiling story about a boy who is found injured on the track and the kids making friends with an elderly man who uses the train to go to work. This man changes their lives, and there is so much more to this enchanting, timeless story…\n\nBernard Cribbins starred in this film in one of his early film roles as Mr Albert Perks, the station porter. Cribbins dons a fantastically convincing Yorkshire accent to fit in with the story. He befriends the kids. Perks is a proud working man who has many heartwarming scenes with the kids.\n\nAfter the kids discover his birthday, they collect gifts for him from the townspeople. However, Perks states emphatically that he doesn’t accept charity. He is appalled by their behaviour, but after the kids’ more kindly motives are explained to him by his wife, he apologises to the children and then feels more loved than pitied.\n\nThis character also has a lovely role in setting the film’s final emotionally driven scenes… Cribbins said of these scenes HERE;\n\n“If you don’t shed a tear when she shouts, ‘Daddy, my daddy!’ you’re made of wood,” said Cribbins. “I always well up when I watch it. But Jenny, who remains a close friend, doesn’t. Hard as nails, she is!”\n\nJackanory (1965-96)…\n\nBernard Cribbins’ tribute to Jackanory on its 50th anniversary, The Children’s Media Foundation\n\nBernard Cribbins was always one of the most loved storytellers in this children’s long running series. In the days before audiobooks, Jackanory was a daily British children’s series where stars sat in a comfy armchair and read a book to the audience via the fourth wall. This story was told by the celebrity a few chapters at a time and was like an early bedtime story on a daily slot after school making some classic books available to everyone.\n\nBy coincidence, another name that we 1970s and 1980s kids remember just hearing about this show, was Cribbins’ Carry on co-star Kenneth Williams. Cribbins starred with Williams in Carry On Jack (1964) and Carry On Spying (1964). Jackanory was like Blue Peter (1958-), in that this series was also tributed in a homage by Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes (2008-10).\n\nThe British stars reading these books were as prolific as those American The Love Boat (1977-87) guest stars. This list of British film and TV greats included actors such as James Bolam, Rik Mayall and Alan Bennett and actresses, Judi Dench, Jan Francis and Hayley Mills.\n\nCribbins was one of the most prolific of the storytellers as he appeared on this show 111 times. He read The Hobbit, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and many more books in his own unique and affable style. Cribbins had warm feelings about this original series yet his BBC obituary quotes him as saying HERE about the remake where I concur wholeheartedly with this presenter;\n\n“I do wish that it could be brought back in the form that it used to be, with someone sitting one-to-one with a camera. It’s like you are talking to your children at bedtime, they look at you and don’t see anything else – they don’t see flashing lights and CGI and all the rest of it.”\n\nVoice work…\n\nTufty Squirell family – childrens tv, kinyoman\n\nChildhood memories include Cribbins’ voice work behind the camera. He lent his voice to all of The Wombles (1973-75) – including a Scottish and a Bulgarian one – cartoon adverts and to Public Information films.\n\nFor those who don’t know The Wombles, they looked like a more friendly yeti with child friendly, hedgehog facial features. These creatures were possibly part of the Keep Britain Tidy campaign as they roamed Wimbledon Common collecting and recycling rubbish of all sorts in these five minute stop motion animation shorts.\n\nCribbins also gave a voice to adverts including Buzby – the cartoon bird which looked a bit like Sesame Street’s (1969-) Big Bird. Tufty, a stop motion red squirrel that taught us road safety with his animal friends. And yes, I was in the Tufty Club and had the badge to prove it…\n\nMore recently, Cribbins was another actor that I nearly met at that same Comic Con, where I’d met the late David Warner and where Peter Mayhew had also attended. Now I’m calling on Doctor Who to take me back to that day when I relive those warm memories of being in the same room as this trio of childhood (and beyond) favourites."
