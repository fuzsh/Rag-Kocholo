        "text": "Bernard Cribbins is an English voiceover artist, character actor, and comedian. He is most recognizable to sci-fi aficionados for his appearances in the \"Doctor Who\" franchise. Born in 1928, Cribbins served as a young man in the Parachute Regiment, the British Army's airborne assault force, and worked an apprenticeship at the Oldham Repertory Theatre. In the mid-to-late 1950s, he acted in several West End plays, including \"A Comedy of Errors.\" Segueing into film in the 1960s, he played Tom Campbell in \"Daleks' Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.,\" a film based on the British sci-fi TV show \"Doctor Who.\" He is often remembered as the station porter in 1970 film drama \"The Railway Children.\" From 1965 to 2001, \"Jackanory\" was a BBC children's show in which an actor would read excerpts from novels or folk tales. Cribbins appeared as a reader over 100 times -- more than any other guest. A recurring fixture in bit parts in film and TV over the years, he remained loyal to the \"Doctor Who\" series in various reinventions. In 2007, he guest-starred as glam rock promoter Arnold Korns in \"Horror of Glam Rock,\" a \"Doctor Who\" radio play for BBC Radio. The following year, he joined the cast of the 2008 series update of \"Doctor Who,\" this time portraying Wilfred Mott, a traveling companion of the Doctor. Bernard Cribbins died on July 28, 2022 at the age of 93."
