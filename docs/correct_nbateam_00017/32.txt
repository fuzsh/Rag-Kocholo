NOTES: Gov. Bobby Jindal and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu attended the game together, speaking to reporters at halftime in an effort to drum up more local support for the Hornets. The league recently took over the club intends to sell it, preferably to a buyer who would continue to operate the club in New Orleans. Jindal said the Hornets need to average a little more than 15,000 for the next nine games to void an early escape clause in the club’s lease at the state-owned arena. The announced attendance was 15,423. … Hornets G Willie Green missed his second straight game as he attends to family matters in Detroit stemming from the recent death of his sister and cousin, who were killed in a car wreck.
