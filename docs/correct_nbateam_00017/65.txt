NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Hornets have traded forward Trevor Ariza and center Emeka Okafor to the Washington Wizards for forward Rashard Lewis and a second-round draft pick.

The Wizards said Wednesday they are sending New Orleans the 46th pick in this year's draft, which originally belonged to Dallas.

Lewis is entering the last season of a six-year, $118 million contract and could be a candidate for the amnesty clause.

Okafor has never lived up to being the second pick in the 2004 draft. He averaged a career-low 9.9 points and 7.9 rebounds last season, missing time with a sore left knee. Ariza averaged 10.8 points and 5.2 rebounds.

The Hornets didn't have a second-round pick. They also have the first and 10th selections in the first round.

Washington also has the second pick of the second round.
