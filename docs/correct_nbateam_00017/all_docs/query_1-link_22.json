        "text": "Emeka Okafor has been waived by the 76ers\n\nEmeka Okafor fails to make the 76ers 15 man roster as the roster cuts conclude on Saturday.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nOkafor will look for another shot with an NBA team or this could be the end of the line for the veteran C who showed he can still be a solid role player in New Orleans last season.\n\nEmeka Okafor joins the 76ers\n\nEmeka Okafor will join the 76ers after being waived by the Pelicans. Okafor played for the 76ers G-League affiliate before being signed by the Pelicans.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nOkafor is merely depth behind Joel Embiid and Amir Johnson. Okafor showed he can still log minutes for a contender last season.\n\nEmeka Okafor scores eight points in the Pelicans win\n\nEmeka Okafor had eight points, on 4-for-4 from the field, and added seven rebounds as the Pelicans defeated the Celtics 108-89.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nAfter going scoreless in 11 minutes on Saturday, Okafor had a solid performance in 17 minutes on Sunday. Okafor may not be a viable fantasy option, but his production has picked up in the month of March with four games of eight or more points, as opposed to just two in the entire month of February.\n\nEmeka Okafor scores nine points in the Pelicans win\n\nEmeka Okafor returned to the lineup and started on Tuesday for New Orleans. In 21 minutes on the floor, he had nine points, seven rebounds, and three blocks as the Pelicans beat the Clippers 121-116.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nAfter missing one game, Okafor was effective and shot the ball well, going 4-for-6 from the field. However, at this point, he is not a viable fantasy option.\n\nEmeka Okafor (ankle) questionable for Tuesday\n\nEmeka Okafor is listed as questionable for the Pelicans matchup against the Clippers on Tuesday.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nIf Okafor is forced to sit out, Nikola Mirotic would see a boost in his fantasy value and might be worth starting for the surging Pelicans."
