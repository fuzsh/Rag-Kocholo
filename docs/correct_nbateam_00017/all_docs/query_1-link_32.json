        "text": "The New Orleans Pelicans will sign center Emeka Okafor for the remainder of the season, according to multiple reports Monday.\n\nOkafor, a former No. 2 overall pick in 2004, joined the Pelicans on Feb. 3 after signing a 10-day contract. He followed up by signing a second 10-day deal that expired after Sunday's 123-121 overtime win against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThe 35-year-old Okafor spent nine seasons in the NBA but before joining the Pelicans, he had not played in the league since 2013 when he was sidelined after suffering a herniated disc in his neck. He was medically cleared in May 2017 after going through multiple years of rehabilitation.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 255-pound Okafor is averaging 3.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.0 blocks and 16.2 minutes in six games with the Pelicans.\n\nCoach Alvin Gentry moved Okafor into the starting lineup for the past four games, giving the Pelicans another big man after the loss of center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending Achilles injury.\n\nOkafor signed with the Philadelphia 76ers in training camp and played for their G League affiliate in Delaware this season in an attempt to make his comeback to the NBA. In 26 games with the Delaware 87ers, Okafor averaged 6.8 points and 8.0 rebounds in 19.9 minutes per game.\n\nOkafor, the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2005, played for Charlotte, New Orleans and Washington after a standout career at UConn. He owns career averages of 12.2 points and 9.9 rebounds in 596 NBA games.\n\nOkafor said he has not been surprised to be able to contribute despite being out of the league for nearly five years.\n\n\"No, it's sports,\" Okafor said, per the New Orleans Advocate. \"My mentality has just been to be ready. I know what I'm good at. I know what my core basketball values are. This year, being in the G-League and trying to get back in the NBA, my mantra has been to be extremely proficient and be ready.\""
