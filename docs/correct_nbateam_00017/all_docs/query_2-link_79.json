        "text": "The Washington Wizards traded Rashard Lewis and a second-round pick that ended up being Darius Miller to the New Orleans Hornets for Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza last June 20. At the time, the Wizards were still working on a complete makeover of their once young and promising roster. In the process of that trade, they were giving up potentially precious cap space in the next two years to add two veteran players that were owed a combined $42 million through the 2013-14 season.\n\nFans and pundits skewered the Wizards for throwing away cap space and putting fading veterans around John Wall and Nene. Was it worth the trade just to have a strong veteran presence in the locker room of an often-dysfunctional roster? Michael Lee's piece for the Washington Post shows it just might be.\n\nAccording to Lee, Wall and Okafor got into a heated argument after a late-February loss to the Detroit Pistons. Since that argument, Wall has been terrorizing the league with his play and showing a lot of promise for not just his future, but also the future of the Wizards.\n\nWhen Okafor attempted to explain afterward why Coach Randy Wittman had to make the decision to give A.J. Price more playing time, Wall snapped back, leading to a heated argument that was audible from the walls on the other side of the training room.\n\n“It was just me being young and very frustrated. I wasn’t making anything, turning the ball over, and we lost a lot of games that we should’ve won and I put the toll on me,” Wall explained, as he recalled his emotions before the encounter. “A lot of frustration was coming out. As a veteran and being a leader on the team, [Okafor] stepped up and said something. At the time, it was in the heat of moment. I was upset.”\n\nWall was unaccustomed to having a teammate challenge him, but in hindsight, he couldn’t disagree with anything that Okafor told him: Wittman had to go with someone else if he was ineffective and Wall has to trust that the coach is doing what was in the best interest of the team, which should always come first\n\n“It wasn’t nothing bad. I felt like, what he said was right,” Wall said of Okafor “It was all the right things at the right time. 'You’ve got to learn how to control your anger more.' Ever since that day forward, I became more focused. Came to practice the next day, talked to him, put it behind us and I just went out there and tried to play basketball. Didn’t hold no grudges.”\n\nAnd this is why you bring strong veteran voices into the locker room when you have a young player who is still trying to find his way in the NBA.\n\nHas Okafor been a great player this season? In his 75 games, his averages and percentages have been down, pretty much across the board from his career averages. Although he's helped anchor the Wizards' defense, which is the sixth best in the NBA, he hasn't given them much help on the offensive end of the ball.\n\nHowever, that contribution to get Wall to refocus his efforts and buy back into the team concept could be worth the roughly $28 million Washington will pay Okafor over this season and next season. Prior to the argument between Wall and Okafor, the Wizards were an improved team but Wall was going through a tremendously frustrating slump. In the previous six games, Wall was averaging 11.2 points on 10.8 shots and 5.0 free throw attempts, 7.8 assists, and 4.3 turnovers. He was also shooting 30.8 percent from the field in those games.\n\nSince the argument, Wall has been destroying the competition. He's averaging 22.7 points on 16.9 shots and 7.3 free throw attempts, 7.9 assists and 2.9 turnovers. He's shooting 48 percent from the field and 38.5 percent from 3-point range. He's shown flashes of great leadership and overwhelming play in wins over the Memphis Grizzlies and Indiana Pacers, the two best defensive teams in the NBA.\n\n“I think I really had to grow. Get my teammates back behind me. Because that’s not the way you’re supposed to come out as a leader and as a franchise guy,” Wall said of his attitude the night of the argument with Okafor. “I had to compete and compete, not really saying too much, just letting my play do the talking and those guys will believe in me and follow my lead.”\n\nThe improvement of the team since Wall returned to the lineup has been impressive, but more impressive has been the maturation of Wall's mental game and his play on the court. He's taking smarter shots, attacking in the right ways, and looking more like the number one pick the Wizards used on him in the 2010 draft.\n\n“I give a lot of credit to John, because he is handling his position relatively well,” Okafor, 30, said. “He’s very mature about his responsibilities and what he has to do. I’m impressed with how he’s gone about some things and his attitude. My role, again, is just to give guidance where guidance is needed. Rein in when they need to be reined in and put things in perspective.”\n\nSure, the Wizards will have to wait one more summer before they can have cap space to put around Wall, but that chastised trade from last summer might have paid off tenfold with the kick in the pants Okafor gave him in late February."
