        "text": "Just about 24 hours before the start of the most anticipated training camp in years, the Sixers have brought two veterans into the fold.\n\nThe Sixers on Monday morning announced the signings of forward Kris Humphries and center Emeka Okafor.\n\nHumphries, the 14th overall pick by Utah in 2004, is entering his 14th season in the league and the Sixers will be the ninth team he's played for after the Jazz, Raptors, Mavericks, Nets, Celtics, Wizards, Suns and Hawks. The University of Minnesota product and former Mr. Kim Kardashian's best season came in 2011-2012 in New Jersey, when he averaged 13.8 points and 11.0 boards a night.\n\nOkafor was the second overall pick by the then-expansion Charlotte Bobcats in the same 2004 NBA draft following a studded career at the University of Connecticut that included the 2004 national championship.\n\nWhile he's averaged 12.3 points in his NBA career, he hasn't quite lived up to the billing that comes with being the No. 2 pick. In fact, after spending 2012-13 with the Wizards, Okafor hasn't played an NBA game since. That's because Okafor suffered a severe herniated disc in his neck that has required time and patience in recovery. Now feeling comfortable enough to play again, the 6-foot-10 Okafor, who's played for the Bobcats, New Orleans Hornets and Wizards in his career, is getting his next chance with the Sixers.\n\nOkafor's best season was his rookie year in Charlotte when he averaged 15.1 points and 10.9 rebounds.\n\nSixers training camp opens Tuesday while the annual media day takes place Monday.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nSixers' complete training camp roster:\n\nGuards\n\nNo. 00 Jacob Pullen\n\nNo. 0 Jerryd Bayless\n\nNo. 1 Justin Anderson\n\nNo. 7 Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot\n\nNo. 11 Nik Stauskas\n\nNo. 12 T.J. McConnell\n\nNo. 17 JJ Reddick\n\nNo. 20 Markelle Fultz\n\nNo. 23 James Blackmon, Jr.\n\nNo. 30 Furkan Korkmaz\n\nForwards\n\nNo. 5 Amir Johnson\n\nNo. 9 Dario Saric\n\nNo. 14 James Michael McAdoo\n\nNo. 22 Richaun Holmes\n\nNo. 25 Ben Simmons\n\nNo. 33 Robert Covington\n\nNo. 43 Kris Humphries"
