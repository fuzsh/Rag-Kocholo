        "text": "The Washington Wizards have traded forward Rashard Lewis and the No. 46 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft to the New Orleans Hornets for center Emeka Okafor and forward Trevor Ariza, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe deal was first reported by\n\n.\n\nThe Hornets were set to pay Okafor and Ariza a combined $40 million dollars over the next two seasons,\n\n. Lewis has one season and $23.8 million remaining on his contract and, according to DraftExpress, can be bought out for $13.7 million before July 1. If the Hornets go that route, they'll have saved around $27 million dollars.\n\nFailing that, they'll have added a player coming off the worst season of his career. Lewis, 32, played in just 28 games, averaged a career-low 7.8 points and shot a career-low .239 from the 3-point line.\n\nIn Okafor and Ariza, the Wizards take on two solid players with significant contracts. Ariza, 27 on June 30, is versatile defensively and averaged 10.8 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.7 steals last season. Okafor, 29, averaged 9.9 points, 7.9 rebounds and a block per game, all career lows. They'll join Nene, acquired via trade last season from the Denver Nuggets, as Washington's rebuilt frontcourt.\n\nThe trade also potentially clears space for the team's presumed draft picks. The Hornets will take shot-blocking power forward Anthony Davis first overall, while the Wizards, at No. 3, would likely focus on Florida guard Bradley Beal, according to Givony and Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix."
