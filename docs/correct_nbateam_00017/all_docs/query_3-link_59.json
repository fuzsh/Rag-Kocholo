We have so many young guys, so many very, very good basketball players on this team. It’s just that we haven’t put it together.”\n\nLove joined John Stockton and former Wolves star Kevin Garnett as the only NBA players to record 37 consecutive double-doubles in the past 25 years.\n\nThe injury-riddled Hornets — missing starting center Emeka Okafor (left oblique) and starting small forward Trevor Ariza (right ankle) — are suddenly in a tailspin, having lost five of six since a 10-game winning streak. The latest loss came against a Minnesota squad that won its third road game of the season and for only the third time in 17 games overall.\n\nIn the only other meeting between these teams, the Wolves shot 53 percent and won 113-98 at Target Center on Dec. 27. This time, even though starting center Darko Milicic left the game with a left hip flexor strain in the first quarter and Michael Beasley left in the fourth with a left ankle sprain, the Wolves shot 50 percent, made 11 three-pointers and were 25 of 25 from the free-throw line.\n\nIn matching the team’s consecutive double-doubles record set by Garnett from late in the 2004-05 season to early in 2005-06, Love was 14 of 14 on free throws and had three of the Wolves’ 11 offensive rebounds, helping Minnesota score 22 second-chance points.\n\nBeasley, who walked on his own to the team bus and is day-to-day, scored 14 points before he had to be helped off the floor. Jonny Flynn had 13 points, Nikola Pekovic scored 12 and Wayne Ellington added 11 in his return from a two-game absence for personal reasons.\n\n“It was unfortunate we lost Darko and Michael, but I thought Kevin played a heck of a game,” Wolves coach Kurt Rambis said. “John played well, and I think we got contributions from everybody.”\n\nChris Paul had 17 points and 13 assists for the Hornets, who lost their third straight despite being reminded constantly of how poorly they played the last time they met Minnesota (12-39), which is last in the Western Conference.\n\n“We didn’t respect that team that had already embarrassed us on their floor, and they came out on our floor and did the same thing,” said Hornets coach Monty Williams, who was fuming over the 37 points his team gave up in the second quarter to fall behind 60-46 at halftime. “A 37-point quarter is embarrassing.”\n\nOriginally Published: February 7, 2011 at 11:01 p.m."
