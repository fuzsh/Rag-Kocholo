        "text": "Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets sent Emeka Okafor packing on Wednesday as they prepare for the 2012 NBA draft.\n\nAnthony Davis is coming to town, and the team had no choice but to make some room to rebuild around their future big man.\n\nEmeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza were dealt to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Rashard Lewis and the No. 46 pick of the 2012 draft.\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets now own the No. 10 and No. 46 picks of the draft, in addition to their first overall selection.\n\nThe team has some options now in regards to what to do with Rashard Lewis.\n\nIf they keep him, they’ll owe him $24 million next season but add a long-range threat to accompany Anthony Davis’ presence down-low.\n\nBut according to ESPN, there is a strong likelihood that the Hornets will waive Rashard Lewis before July 1 in order to cut $10 million off of the $24 million he is owed in 2012-13.\n\nAll signs indicate that the main purpose of this trade was to help clear up some cap room for the hopeful re-signing of Eric Gordon.\n\nThe Hornets acquired Gordon in the deal for Chris Paul last year. He played in all of nine games last season due to a knee injury he sustained after just his second game in a Hornets uniform.\n\nIn 2010-11, he averaged 22.3 PPG and over four assists for the Los Angeles Clippers, numbers that the Hornets expect him to replicate if he returns to the team healthy next season.\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nNew Orleans' major focus over the next week, however, will be who to select with the No. 10 pick of the 2012 draft.\n\nIdeally, they would re-sign Eric Gordon and draft Damian Lillard to run the point with the No. 10 overall pick.\n\nHowever, there is a chance that Lillard may fall of the board before then, and there is also a chance that Gordon’s asking price may be a bit high for the Hornets' liking.\n\nIf that ends up being the case, then Duke’s Austin Rivers would be an excellent selection with the No. 10 overall pick.\n\nHe would provide Eric Gordon-like qualities as an all-around solid shooter who should transition nicely to the NBA.\n\nDion Waiters would be another excellent selection if he’s still on the board at No. 10; he was a consistent long-range threat and electric scorer for Syracuse all of last year.\n\nShould they decide to go a different route, which is very likely, they could also look toward the acquisition of a bigger player to assist Davis under the basket.\n\nJared Sullinger was a top choice initially, but recent reports about injury potential have caused some teams to worry.\n\nDepending on their desire to re-sign Chris Kaman, which I suspect isn’t strong, they could also look toward taking a risk on a big center like Illinois’ 7’1” Meyers Leonard.\n\nAccording to scouts, Leonard has a lot of upside, but is still unpolished and comes with some risk this early in the draft.\n\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nNot to mention that the Hornets are likely to go for the best available player at No. 10.\n\nAccording to recent reports from John Reid at the Times Picayune, Tyler Zeller, the 7’0” center from North Carolina, may fit that description.\n\nClearly, they will have a lot of talented options available at No. 10.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the No. 46 spot won't be equally as important to their rebuilding process.\n\nAt this point in the draft, they'll likely look for a small forward.\n\nKentucky’s Darius Miller could fit the bill, as could Syracuse’s Kris Joseph.\n\nBoth players come from top-tier programs and proved themselves to be effective scorers last season.\n\nOne player that they could potentially take a chance on is the 6'6\" Jae Crowder from Marquette.\n\nThe Big East Player of the Year last season is a very hard worker and excellent team player. He attacks the hoop with authority and can shoot the long-range shot, but some scouts worry about his size and ability to play defense at the NBA level.\n\nOne thing is for certain though, this 2012 NBA draft will determine the future of the New Orleans Hornets organization.\n\nAnthony Davis is a sure thing at No. 1, but they’ll need to play their cards right with their next two picks to assert themselves as a contender in the near future.\n\nBut the ball is still in their court and the time will be ticking away come draft day."
