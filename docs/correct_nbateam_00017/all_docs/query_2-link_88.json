        "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Hornets have traded forward Trevor Ariza and center Emeka Okafor to the Washington Wizards for forward Rashard Lewis and a second-round draft pick.\n\nThe Wizards said Wednesday they are sending New Orleans the 46th pick in this year's draft, which originally belonged to Dallas.\n\nLewis is entering the last season of a six-year, $118 million contract and could be a candidate for the amnesty clause.\n\nOkafor has never lived up to being the second pick in the 2004 draft. He averaged a career-low 9.9 points and 7.9 rebounds last season, missing time with a sore left knee. Ariza averaged 10.8 points and 5.2 rebounds.\n\nThe Hornets didn't have a second-round pick. They also have the first and 10th selections in the first round.\n\nWashington also has the second pick of the second round."
