        "text": "The demolition of mass housing estates in Western countries initiated several questions regarding the heritage of Modern architecture, and how a global phenomenon failed in some countries. Regardless of their architectural values or even the fact that they are protected as cultural monuments, housing settlements in Great Britain, France etc. are under constant threat of being demolished, and a great many of them meet their fate as stigmatized places of poverty and crime. At the same time, similar architectural and urban achievements of the 1960s and 1970s in other countries have been recognized for their value and are treated as historic sites. New Belgrade was chosen as a case study for this article as an example of a more successfully realized concept. In this article we will try to determine whether New Belgrade was truly a successful concept, and if so, which factors influenced its positive development.\n\nThe development of residential architecture in Yugoslavia during the period of socialism had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to “pack” as many residential units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living. Innovative theoretical ideas were developed at leading housing research centers and then spread at conferences, consultations, expositions and architectural contests. Top quality design concepts were mostly obtained through architectural contests, which, among other things, also served the purpose of testing theoretical principles and new concepts of residential patterns on actual examples. Although the term “socialist apartment” seems to be accepted in practice, in the scientific sense, it has not been sufficiently explored or examined. The aim of this paper is to explore whether there was a certain architectural pattern as a form of response to the specific socio-economic conditions in Yugoslavia, in terms of a functional scheme that architects followed and which could be defined by the term “socialist apartment”.\n\nThe history of prefabricated building in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as in most of Europe, started with the intention of making good the consequences of the destruction caused in World War II. Still, Yugoslav prefabrication has a very specific developmental route in the wider European and global context. Yugoslav firms put prefabrication ambitiously into practice with some considerable delay as compared with their models in France, Scandinavia and the Soviet Union, only when suitable conditions had been attained. A kind of turning point can be found in 1960, when the 1st International Construction Fair was held in Belgrade, and within it, the Industrialisation of Housing Construction Seminar, organised at the federal level, for about 600 participants country-wide. At the time when the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement was a certainty, and the economy and political system of the country had been liberalised, the previously rigid regulations were also modified. Finally it was possible through pooling of resources, cooperation and the import-export business to cope with the serious problems that Yugoslav building operations had to face every day. The country stood behind its architectural and building operations, which were expanding in both quality and volume, and which, it was hoped, would bring in revenue from foreign markets. Prefabrication was addressed within the wider context of industrialisation, above all of housing construction and contents complementary to housing, industrial infrastructure and public buildings. In their endeavors to create an authentic architectural expression that would adequately represent the operational side as well as be competitive and compatible on all markets at the global level, it was architecture that was presented as the trump card: it was to be modern, functional, flexible, with the incontestable qualities of a heterogeneous scene that offered everything in a range from the technicist to building influenced by vernacular traditions. In the process in which the integrity of the competition architectural approach was an imperative, it would happen that one project would operate with a tremendous number of prefabricated elements and hand-made details, which nullified the basic premise of the industrialization of building – the multiplication of just a few basic modular prefabricated elements. Domestic and foreign systems – about sixty of them registered on the Yugoslav market – were “opened”, “compromised” and “closed”, changed in order to meet the conditions of the “competition solutions”, were adjusted to meet JUS standards and “social contracts”; they were subject to tradesmen’s interventions and adjustments; they were tested through their application to a number of available “experimental regions” around the world. System thus turned into technology. However, Yugoslav prefabrication, in all of the forms and subcategories in which it appeared – through the policy of adjustment to the requirements / needs / capacities of the society managed to achieve what many producers could not – Architecture.

Unfinished Modernisations is a collaborative, long-term research platform on architecture and urban planning. It brought together partners from both institutional and non-institutional sectors from South-Eastern Europe: Museum of Architecture and Design, Ljubljana (Slovenia), Maribor Art Gallery (Slovenia), the Croatian Architects’ Association (project coordinator) and Oris House of Architecture, Zagreb (Croatia), the Belgrade Architects Society, Belgrade (Serbia) and the Coalition for Sustainable Development, Skopje (Macedonia). The project was aimed at fostering interdisciplinary research on the production of built environment in its social, political and cultural contexts. It encompassed the countries that succeeded former Yugoslavia, spanning the period from the inception of the socialist state until today. The topic of the researches was the way in which divergent concepts of modernization conditioned architecture, territorial transformations, and urban phenomena in socialist Yugoslavia and its successor states. Special attention is paid to critical re-reading of modernization processes and contextualization of local architectural and urban planning concepts within the framework of international evolution of architectural discourse. Unfinished Modernisations were carried out through a variety of activities: researches, 5 conferences (Zagreb, Skopje, Beograd, Split, Ljubljana), exhibitions, publications, and web-site/blog www.unfinishedmodernisations.net. The keynote speakers at the conferences included David Harvey, Vedran Mimica, Hilde Heynen, Ljiljana Blagojević, Tom Avermaete, Dietmar Steiner, Hans Ibelings, and many others. All these efforts culminated in the final exhibition in Maribor (Slovenia), the 2012 Cultural Capital of Europe. The exhibition was also shown in Belgrade (Serbia), Zadar (Croatia), and Ljubljana (Slovenia), and will travel to various international destinations.\"\n\nIn light of the development of contemporary Serbian architecture in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the work of the team of architects Milenija and Darko Marušić is indicative of trends in Serbia’s Belgrade architectural scene. Their substantial and affirmed architectural activities encompass a series of issues and themes related both to the changes in Serbian architecture permeated with dialogues between modernism and postmodernism in the last decades of the twentieth century and to the specificity of the author’s contribution based on the personal foothold around which their architectural poetics weaves. The context of postmodernism, particularly the Neo-Rationalist European current, has been a suitable ambience in the genesis and upgrade of their creativity. It can be considered through several typical themes on the Modernism versus Postmodernism - relation, starting from the issue of contextuality as determination, through duality, mutual dialogue as an impetus, attitude about the comprehensiveness of architectural considerations based on the unbreakable link between the urbanism and architecture, and on the issues of urban morphology the theme oriented towards both the professional community and the wider public, but also towards architecture itself – its ethics and aesthetics, which are equally important themes for them. Key words: modernism versus postmodernism, duality, Serbia, Belgrade school of housing, contextuality.\n\nThis thesis looks at the construction of New Belgrade as an urban history narrative for the history of Yugoslavia. This is a study of the history of place and space, in conjunction with the history of Tito's Yugoslavia. Beginning with the foundation for the new city, during the interwar period, the first chapter establishes an understanding of the purpose of the place during the Kingdom era. It then looks at the effect of the Second World War, and the establishment of the communist/socialist era under Josip Broz Tito. The following chapter looks at the Tito era from the split from the Cominform. It is an analysis of the creation of New Belgrade under Tito, and how it is representative of Yugoslavia’s differentiation from the Soviet Bloc. The final chapter examines New Belgrade following the Tito era, the impact of the collapse of Yugoslavia, NATO intervention and the rebuilding of New Belgrade in the 21st century.\n\nThe construction of New Belgrade as the new capital of socialist Yugoslavia was the most symbolic modernizing act initiated by the country's communist government. Yet, its precise meanings were suspended between the complicated and permanently transitory concepts of socialist Yugoslavia's federalism and its international aspirations. Focusing on three characteristic “snapshots” of the city's physical development, this paper analyzes how New Belgrade and its most important buildings represented the shifting concepts of socialist Yugoslavia as a multiethnic community and its even more changeable place in the world. The first snapshot deals with the years immediately following World War II, during which New Belgrade was conceived as the seat of a centralized Stalinist state in close alliance with the USSR. The second deals with the effects of Yugoslavia's break from the Soviet bloc in 1948, especially its rapprochement with the West and the start of the decentralization of the federal state. Finally, the third explores the late socialist period: the dwindling of New Belgrade's role as the political heart of the federation, and at the same time its emergence as a locus of Yugoslavia's ambition to play a leading role in international relations, especially through its activity in the Non-Aligned Movement.

This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of and offer further directions for research into the implementation of spatial plans by presenting the results of a study on models of implementation. The paper describes the basic theoretical postulates of a model for implementing spatial plans. A comparative analysis of the application of elements and models of implementation of plans in practice was conducted based on the spatial plans for the local municipalities of Arilje, Lazarevac and Sremska Mitrovica. The analysis includes four models of implementation: the strategy and policy of spatial development; spatial protection; the implementation of planning solutions of a technical nature; and the implementation of rules of use, arrangement and construction of spaces. The main results of the analysis are presented and used to give recommendations for improving the elements and models of implementation. Final deliberations show that models of implementation are generally used in practice and combined in spatial plans. Based on the analysis of how models of implementation are applied in practice, a general conclusion concerning the complex character of the local level of planning is presented and elaborated."
