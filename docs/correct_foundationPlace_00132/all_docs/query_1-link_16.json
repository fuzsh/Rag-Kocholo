        "text": "Our new tests have provided additional support to the theory that polygyny, unilineal descent organization and large extended families could be regarded as universal negative predictors of the communal democracy. Our tests have confirmed that that the Christianization correlates positively with the communal democracy. Our tests have also confirmed that the Christianization correlates negatively with polygyny (though no one hardly doubted this). However, our tests (contrary to our expectations) have failed to confirm the presence of negative correlation between Christianization and the presence of large extended families. Hence, the main channels through which the Christianization of Europe might have contributed to the development of the communal democracy in this part of the world are the destruction of the unilineal descent organization and polygyny (but not the large extended families). In general, our overall explanatory model looks as follows. We suggest that the kinship and family structures (determined in its turn by a large number of independent factors, both material [e.g. economic] and ideal [e.g. religious]) could affect significantly the overall political evolution of the respective societies. We believe, that the family structures affects primarily the political organization of the community (and we think we have provided enough substantial support for this point above). However, we also believe that the communal political structure could influence significantly the political organization of the supracommunal levels as is suggested by the test which we performed. As one could see the correlation between the democracy of the communal organization and the democracy of the supracommunal political organization turns out to be really strong and significant beyond any doubt. I think that though the democratization of communal organization under the influence of the previously democratized state is perfectly possible (for example, this could be observed in the post-Communist Eastern Europe), the communal democracy in its turn could contribute to the democratization of the supracommunal political organization. Note that in Europe the development of democratic communal organization preceded the formation of modern supracommunal democracy. There are certain grounds to believe that the democratic organization of European communities facilitated the formation of democratic structures on the supracommunal level. On the other hand, the non-democratic communal organization appears to inhibit the development of democratic state organization as seems to be evidenced by Near Eastern data. \n\nAs has been stated in many papers about postcommunist countries, the ”post-communist” label underlines historical similarities of many countries of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe but is quite unproductive in explaining current social processes and, moreover, developmental possibilities. This is true in particular for the role of religion in light of not only very different religious situations in different countries (measured by the usual sociological indicators of religiosity) but also different confessional traditions (Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy but also Islam and Protestantism to a certain extent), and differences in their church–state relations. Thus, the notion of diversity(-ies) more accurately describes the role of religion in post-communist countries than does the notion of similarity. Diversity, on the other hand, poses another problem, as it lacks an adequate theoretical frame for understanding trends in socio-religious development. Is there any theoretical ex...\n\nThe relationship between religion/religiosity and democratic values is one of the discipline’s hot topics. On the one hand, the ‘secularist’ school sees religion as inherently in tension with democratic attitudes (due to its dogmatism and closure) and argues that intense religiosity might pose obstacles to the diffusion of democratic values. On the other hand, many scholars have challenged these beliefs and have empirically shown that religion does not imply lower support for democracy. This paper tests different hypotheses drawn from the literature by comparing the influence of religiosity on political attitudes in Georgia and Azerbaijan. The comparison allows the sketching of a more composite picture and suggests that religion might play diverse roles in different contexts. This leaves the scenario open for further research as well as for original interpretations."
