        "text": "Changes in the contemporary society have brought a new way of working at schools. The traditional method of teaching was focused on the teacher and required the expertise of the teachers primarily as a lecturer. Active learning refers to the student who is directly involved in the learning process, whereas the teacher should give the students an intellectual incentive, encourage their curiosity and support them in their work. T he objective of this paper was to examine the students’ and the teachers’ opinions on the teaching process, on the methods and the ways of students’ learning and the teachers’ way of working in order to improve the quality of the teaching and the learning process itself. The research was carried out both among the students from the 5th to the 8th grade and the selected subject teaching teachers at school “Jovan Dučić”. It was noted by descriptive analysis that there is a certain degree of disagreement in the way the students and the teachers see the teaching process. The research showed that the teachers should relate more material of their subjects to other school subjects, include more integrative and project teaching in their work as well as link school materials with everyday life. According to the students’ answers, we can conclude that they would find the learning process more interesting if the experts in certain areas attended their lessons or if the elder students taught the younger ones. In addition, it is necessary to encourage students to strengthen their interdisciplinary competence 343raziskovanje v vzgoji in izobraževanju: mednarodni vidki vzgoje in izobraževanja and to link the acquired knowledge with the real requirements of the working context of the 21st century. One of the important conclusions of our research shows that it is necessary to pay more attention to the individual characteristics of each student. By adopting these changes in the working process, the teachers would approach the principles of active learning, whereas the students would be more prepared for the future. Key words: teaching, learning, student differentiation in teaching, multiple linking of teaching materials, career guidance for students.\n\nEfficiency, effectiveness and quality of educational institutions in Serbia are assessed through evaluation and self-evaluation based on the key areas set out in the Standards for the evaluation of the higher education institutions. Starting from the statement of Albert Einstein that “teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty”, authors have developed a range of instruments and, among other things, examine the area of quality of teaching through the process of self-evaluation in Preschool Teacher Training College in Kikinda, Serbia. In this study is presented the research on the quality of educational process in Preschool Teacher Training College in Kikinda in Serbia, conducted in 2013 in which participated 177 students and 20 teachers. The main research focus: quality of educational process has been observed trough two additional aspects that are inseparable from the quality of teaching: grading system and learning effects. The research instrument is conceptualized on the basis of questionnaire that measure students’ and teachers’ perspectives on the quality of teaching, as two main groups in teaching process, with 11 items and five point Likert scale of answers. Questionnaires are distributed in two separate forms: for students and for teachers, with the aim of making the same content on the quality of teaching adaptable and comprehensible to two groups of examinees. The aim of this study is to explore do, and if so, how the students’ and teachers’ perspectives on the quality of teaching differ. The results show that there are differences in perspectives among students and teachers. Teachers evaluate the quality of teaching slightly higher than students. On the basis of these results, authors examine how the attitudes of academics and students about quality of teaching might offer a way of analyzing the relations between disciplinary knowledge practices and teaching learning interactions. For the purpose of analyzing the research results, authors adjusted Guskey’s model of five critical levels of professional development evaluation. The reason why we decide to use those methods is understanding of quality of teaching from systemic model of learning which emphasizes that what students learn and how teachers teach is part of a system, which is itself constrained by the subject discipline, the institution and ultimately by the government agenda. Keywords: quality of teaching, learning effects, grading system, research, higher education, students, teachers, self-evaluation.\n\nAim of the research is to evaluate the importance to profession of teaching and modern teaching qualities given by the graduates getting undergraduate education in Faculty of Science and Arts and pedagogic training education in terms of different variants. The research was applied to 197 volunteer graduates getting pedagogic training education in University of Sakarya. Data of the research was gathered by the attitude scales of ÖMİT and ÇÖN. The research was conducted with descriptive scanning and relational scanning. The results of data indicate that attitudes about profession of teaching are extensively positive. There is no meaningful difference between attitudes and some variants. As two sidevariance analysis points out, collective effect of parents’ education level is not meaningful about the attitudes. Regression analysis has drawn attention to the fact that the reason about persistence to certificate major program is a significant exposition about attitudes. The importance to...\n\nThe provision of high-quality teaching is one of the primary aims of the university. The character of the teaching is determined by its connection with the level of qualification and experience: students pursue their chosen programmes under the guidance of academic staff who are active scholars, teachers with teaching experience in the areas which they teach, and who can present the intellectual challenge of studying a subject in depth. This article does not attempt to cover all aspects of teaching. It does not seek to prescribe for the essential element of intellectual inspiration and challenge in the best university teaching, which depends on the talents of the academic staff. What it provides is the establishment of a framework, based on good practice, within which the vital activity of teachers stimulates, and attracts learners to go through the study programmes successfully. The other issue is to discuss teaching assessment criteria to help teachers to be guided in teaching qua..."
