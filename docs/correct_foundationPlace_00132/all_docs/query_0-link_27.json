        "text": "The demolition of mass housing estates in Western countries initiated several questions regarding the heritage of Modern architecture, and how a global phenomenon failed in some countries. Regardless of their architectural values or even the fact that they are protected as cultural monuments, housing settlements in Great Britain, France etc. are under constant threat of being demolished, and a great many of them meet their fate as stigmatized places of poverty and crime. At the same time, similar architectural and urban achievements of the 1960s and 1970s in other countries have been recognized for their value and are treated as historic sites. New Belgrade was chosen as a case study for this article as an example of a more successfully realized concept. In this article we will try to determine whether New Belgrade was truly a successful concept, and if so, which factors influenced its positive development.\n\nWhen talking about Belgrade, and its expansion in the second half of twentieth century, one always falls into the trap of thinking about New Belgrade. Although a completely valid point of view, since it did house 250,000 of new inhabitants of Belgrade and it was planned by some of the most talented planners and architects of the country, I would argue that it is far too exceptional to be a good case study in this matter. As architect-planner Milica Jakšić recalled, only the most talented architects-planners were invited into the team for New Belgrade and they did not interact so much with the other teams, while architect-planner Vera Paunović commented on the imperative of multidisciplinary work for this urban laboratory. There were other notions to exceptionality of New Belgrade as well: it was envisioned as the federal capital, as the seat of the administration, was funded from various federal bodies and planned as a review of Yugoslav architecture. I would argue that it is precisely those developments that are not heavily featured in architectural journals that are being shyly mentioned as a footnote or being analysed from one point of view (i.e. just technology, or just design); those are the ones that ought to be analysed. In this case, I will stick more closely to the various aspects of the profession, without analysing the historical and systemic problems of the women’s employment in the field of architecture and urban planning in Serbia/Yugoslavia. Here, I would like to analyse the plans, projects and developments that were known for authorship of women planners, but somehow ended marginalized, although once featured as potential future successes of Belgrade housing economy. In this case, we will stay on the right bank of Sava River and examine the other housing estates of Belgrade, the famous ‘not-so-famous’ and ‘not-so-successful’ estates of Šumice and Konjarnik, Braće Jerković and Medaković. It is an interesting coincidence that all of them are in Voždovac municipality, on the so-called South-Eastern route of expansion of the city of Belgrade.\n\nWhen contemplating the future of cities, are we not, at the same time, critically considering its present as well as its past? And, to the extent that the focus of our vision is a modern city, how do we see the future of the city such as New Belgrade, which itself is a modern, functional city, planned and constructed in the socialist Yugoslavia in the second half of the twentieth century? Furthermore, having in view the recent change of paradigms, i.e. the break-up of the former Federation, the change of socio-political conditions and the consequent change of the concept of modernity, the fascination with the future may well benefit from closer inspection of the vacillating narrative of modernity and strategies of modernism, as they have been unfolding in the planning and construction of New Belgrade. It could be argued that the principal failure of New Belgrade is its functional incapacity, more precisely, its failure to develop as a complex spatio-urban structure of multiple functions, which has consequently put strain on the social life and movement of the community. The issue of re-functionalisation, thus, predictably becomes central in the contemporary discussion on the future of New Belgrade. Yet, could we propose that, paradoxically, the main resource of New Belgrade is that it is dysfunctional, and that its main potential for the contemporary re- functionalisation is that it is an \"unfinished\" modernist project? The most obvious questions which could be posed with regard to this are: How will re-functionalisation deal with the concept of the modern city?; What new/contemporary strategies of conquering the modernist open/empty space can be invented?; What impact will the new development exert on the open plan of the modern city? And, perhaps, most importantly, what new concepts are investigated and set for what is actually being designed and constructed? But, instead of generating critical concepts, New Belgrade is facing the crisis of non-concept. This being the case, would we not come to a better understanding of the contemporary situation if we were to propose that the issue of re-functionalisation calls for an invention of new and alternative strategies of modernisation, albeit those critical of the original modernist concept.\n\nThis paper points to current transformations of the New Belgrade architectural and urban space identifying the process of filling the empty undeveloped areas within the New Belgrade blocks under the pressure of new commercial facilities. Given that these changes are not regulated by plans in an appropriate way, they are manifested in the space as problem situations leading to the production of space which is appropriate for the narrow interests of capital holders, while interests of direct users, as well as interest of a wider public, are most often neglected. The paper presents a critical analysis of the existing conditions and identifies problems emerging in the development and planning of the New Belgrade urban tissue. The space transformations have been explored at the level of urban and physical structure, urban landscape and user&apos;s life. Identified problem situations are indicative for further consideration of strategies for urban-architectural planning and design of New Belgrade.\n\nMirjana Roter Blagojević, PhD Marta Vukotić Lazar, PhD East and West – Influences on Belgrade Urban and Architectural Development from the early 20th Century to the 1970s If we want to understand modern urban development of Belgrade in the 20th century, it is necessary to understand the importance of its specific geo-strategic and geo-political position between East and West – on the confluence of the Sava and the Danube rivers – having a crucial impact on its urban and architectural development throughout history. Political and cultural influences of the East and West, which were alternating after the Serbian state had been restored, constitute the basic elements of its modern identity, which is also largely expressed in a constant struggle between the traditionalism and modernism, the conservative and the progressive. After the WWI, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and later on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formed (1929), which apart from the erstwhile Kingdom of Serbia, consisted of the regions that used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman empires. The new Kingdom was a political and cultural symbiosis of the East and the West parts of the Balkans. The Capital, Belgrade, lost its centuries-long border position. In the large scale reconstruction of the, in the war devastated town, the state authorities tried to reconcile the existing historic and cultural differences in the new Kingdom, and in its urbanism and architecture, to reflect a new national, political and cultural identity. After the WWII, Belgrade was the capital of the Democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, led by the Communist Party and Tito. By 1948, the country claimed allegiance to Soviet Union. After 1948, the Yugoslav political elite chose the “third way” between the communist East and capitalist West. In the first post-war years, the old idea of extending the city to the plains, between the Sava and the Danube, was revived. The new area, called New Belgrade, was planned, and two competitions were announced in 1946. In the area of future New Belgrade, stretching from the Old Sava Bridge, as a link with the old town, a broad boulevard was built with the Yugoslav Presidency building (1947-1954) and the Communist Party Central Committee building (1964). These buildings symbolically mark the creation of a new political state centre and the new capital city, outside the old town. The very architecture of the buildings was supposed to reflect the new progressive social and aesthetic trends - the so-called Socialist Realism. The 1960s Belgrade architecture was more liberate and rich. Different Yugoslav versions of the Western International Style and poetical interpretations of the Western mainstream Modernism were expressed on major public buildings. These buildings symbolised the final cultural and artistic turn to the West, and from that time progressive architectural ideas from the developed European countries starting to bee adopted.
