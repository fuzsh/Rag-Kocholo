        "text": "Scyri,according to another.\n\nSARMATIAN SCIRI\n\nIn fact, Pliny suggested the ethnic character of theSciri several centuries earlie\n\n(Pomerania isinhabited as far as theV i stulaRiver by theSarmatian Venedi,Sciri,\n\nHirri). While Pliny's text does not identify the Sciri as Serbs, evidence in support ofthat I\n\nnotion is found in the fact that in the general area inhabited by the SarmatianSciri, inI prehistoric Pomerania and Poland west of the Vistula, one finds overwhelming onomas- tic evidence of Serb settlement.\n\nSCYTHIAN AND GERMAN NATIONS\n\nWith regard to this period, to the role of Slavs in Gothic armies, it is important to keep in mind that history and archaeology indicate that the Goths generally, and the Ostrogoths or East Goths, east of the Dniester River, particularly, had significant Slavic components. Referring to an early Gothic ruler, Cassidorius' Origo Gothica states that Ermanaric ruled over all Scythian and German nations. In this regard it is important to keep in mind that by the mid-4th century, the Ostrogoths, who dominated the Pontic area, were ethnically and culturally transformed by local elements. In fact, recent excava- tions indicate that Germanic elements were never preponderant, that 'Scythian' Slavs formed an important part of the Ostrogothic kingdom. The 'Scythization' of the Ostrogoths is discussed at length in a recent work by the German historian H. Wolfram\n\n(HistoryoftheGoths,1988). Linguistic evidenceof earlyand close Slav-German associationin\n\nmilitary affairs is found in the Old Slav/>/«£, troops in battle formation, in Slavic deriva-\n\ntivesp lu k , p u lk , p u k connoting regiment, people en masse, and Gothic-German equiva-\n\nlents,nam ely f olk, f olc , f olk; in such Slavic combination personal names/titles asS vetopolk,\n\ncommander of a strong troop.\n\nMODERN SCHOLARSHIP\n\nIn different ways and degrees authoritative modern scholarship offers support for Gottlob's general thesis in terms of earlySarn ut t i an -Slav -Serb settlement in Danubia- Pannonia.The broad, deep, exhaustive,and thorough researchof L. Niederle( S lovanske\n\nStarozitnosti, 1902-1919), one of thep illars of modern Slavistics, suspectsth a t theSlavsw ere\n\nalready in Central Europe at the end of the second millennium, alongside the Germans in the north, alongside the Thracians in the Carpathians, with the Iranians and Caucasians in the Black Sea area, with the Baits along the Baltic Sea, where they lived together in a Baltic-Slavic union. All available evidence, Niederle writes, places the Slavs in southern Hungary, Transylvania, and the Danube in the first centuries of our era, an area settled by the SarmatianJaz g y es in the first century A.D.\n\nSIRMIUM, SERDICA, VRBAS\n\nCiting cities along the Danube basin, likeS irum ium (Srem) andS erdic a( Sred i st e) , apparent Latinizations for descriptive Slavonic place names, Toynbee suspects a strong Slavonic presence in the area during the Roman period. F. Dvornik, following Safarik, finds hard, conspicuous evidence of early Slavic settlement in the existence of such proto- typical Slavic place names as Vuka, Vrbas andVuci ca in Danubian Pannonia, modern Slavoniaand Banat, areasofS arm at i an settlment,f r o m the 2nd century onward( E arly\n\nSlavic Civilization, 1956; The Making of Central and Eastern Europe, 1974). LIMIG-ANTES, ARDAGAR-ANTES\n\nIn the early 300s the Sarmatians are recorded asL im igantes andA rdagarantes. It appears obvious to the noted historian G. Vernadsky, that the/öz^-SarrnatianL im igantes areL im ig- A ntes are Antes are Slavs, that theA rdagantes areA rdagar- A ntes are Antes are Slavs (The Originsof Russia, 1959).W hen civilw ar brokeout about A.D. 332,the defeated\n\nAcarag-Antes took refuge in Roman territory and were given land in Pannonia or present-\n\nday Serb Voivodina. In the war with Rome that followed, theL im ig- A ntes fought well and bravely (with invincible stubborness, not a single man asked for pardon, records Ammianus). Defeated in 358, forced to retreat beyond theTisza River, theL im ig- A ntes remained a force to be reckoned with until the arrival of the Huns circa A.D. 430.\n\nLINGUISTIC RECORD\n\nThe linguistic record also points in the direction of early Slavic settlement in Danubia. InVanished Civilizations (1963), T. Sulimirski, a noted authority on the Sarmatians (The Sarmatians, 1970), makesthe following supporting points:1) The studyof the toponomy of Romania shows that the Slavs adopted unromanized Dacian place names in the Roman province of Dacia or Latin names and transmitted them to the Romanians; 2) In the sphere of social and political life, the oldest Romanian terminology shows that Latin terms were translated or replaced by Slavic words; 3) The Slavic element came into Romanian during the common Romanian period and before the division of the language into its four main dialects; 4) The phonetic structure of Romanian words of Slavic origin often reveals their great antiquity; 5) The study of the Slavic names of the Tisa and other rivers of the Hungarian Plain also confirm the theory that the Slavs were on the southern side of the Carpathians well before the sixth century A.D.\n\nSRBUL\n\nInteresting contemporary evidence that the early Slavs in Danubia were called Serbs is found in that fact that centuries after the Serbs disappeared and the Bulgars appeared, the natives of Wallachia and Moldavia still refer to their southern neighbors along the Danube asS erbsor S rbul . According to Budimir, in addition to other factors, clear evidence of an ancient Serb/Slav element n Danubia and Dacia is also found in the Roma- nian system of counting from ten upward as well as other linguistic substratums.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nAmmianus' work is written in extreme detail and its general accuracy has never been challenged. Originally in thirty-\n\none books covering the years 96-378, the extant narrative begins with the events of 353, the year he joined the army\n\nand served on Rome's eastern frontier.\n\nIn 'Juzne kulture i narodi prema luzickoj kulturi, Praslovenima i Slovenima', a paper presented at the International Congress of Slavic Archaeolog, Warsaw, 1965 (Miedzynanrodowy kongres archeologii slowianskiej, 1968), V. Trbuhovic presents evidence in support of his thesis that in the first century B.C. the Slavs resisted the Romans in Danubia, that\n\nsome remained, others migrated north and east.\n\nFor a Polish interpretation of Dagome iudex: P. Bogdanowicz, Geneza aktu dyplomatycznego zwanego Dagime\n\niudex,RoH25,1959\n\n7. ET ALIO NOMINA SORABI DICTI:\n\nWENDS, VANDALS\n\nA\n\ns the following selections indicate, one often finds the statement in\n\nearly and modern scholarship that Wend in one form or another (e.g.\n\nGutnielasin Sarmatoru idest Guinedorum)is a German name for Slavs called\n\nSerbs: 1) Wend (Wenden) is a German name for the Sorben; 2)The Serbs are\n\nWends and the Wends are Serbs; 3) The land between the Saale and Elbe were\n\nsettled by Slavs, Wends who are also called Serbs; 4) Winden sind also Serben,\n\nund das land Winden ist Srbien; 5) The so-called Sarmatians or Wends of Ger-\n\nmany and Poland are Serbs.\n\nVENEDIS SLAVIS, SORABI\n\nOne of the earliest German sources refers to theVenedi Slavs also calledS erb s: A\n\nVenedis Slavisq uiet ali o nomina Sorabid i cti( Chronic le ofFredgarms, 642).A ccording to the\n\nChronicon Cario nis compiled by J. Carion (1499-1537): 1)Most Sarmats were Wends\n\n(Sarmaturum gentem maximum Henetosesse) ;2)Sarmat andHenet are one and\n\nthe same name and another name for the Serbs.L i n g ua H en eta orWi n d i sche spräche\n\nis said to be the common language of the Slavs. According toChronicon Saxoniae, a German chronicle compiled in 1625, the Slavs on Saxony's borders are Heneti Sorabi who in different times and places are also known as Heneti, Wendi, Slavi andVan d ali :\n\nThe lands east of the Elbe were settled by the Heneti, who the Germans call Wendi,\n\nthe Italians, Slavi, and even Vandali by some writers.\n\nVENEDORUM NATIONE\n\nAs the title of a 17th century study of the Serbs of Germania and Bohemia indi-\n\ncates the Serbs areVenedorum Nationeare Populi Venedicti are Wends are Serbs:\n\nDisputatio Historicade Serbis, Venedorum NationeVul g oDi ctiDi e Wenden.\n\nVANDALS, VANDALIA\n\nAs the following series indicates, medieval sources sometimes refer to Germania's\n\nSlavs and neighboring Slavs asV andals/Wandals, their lands,Van d ali a/Wan d ali a:1)\n\nAb Oriente Wandalorum gens ferocissima habitat; 2) Contra Wandelicos auxiliantibus; 3) De Sclavia. Sclavia estpars Mesia, multas continens regiones. Nam Sclavi sunt Bohemi, Poloni, Metani, Vandali, Rutheni;4) In Wandalos; 5) In regionem Wandalorum; 6) Inter Saxoniam et Vandaliam estAlbus. Estautem Vandalia terra, cujus gentes Slavi dicuntur;7 ) L ingua Rutenorum et Polonorum et Boemorum et Sclavanorum eadem est cum lingua Wandalorum; 8) Sclavorum in regionem Wandalorum; 9) Wandalos, quos nunc appellant Guenedos. The notion that at one\n\ntime Germania's Slavs orWi n uli were calledVan d al s has deep roots in early German\n\nsources. In the late 11th century Adam of Bremen writes: Sclavania igitur, amplissima\n\nGermaniaeprovintia, a Winulis incolitur, qui olim diet sunt Wandali.One century\n\nlater, Adam's successor, Helmold, writes: Where Poland ends one comes into a most\n\nextensive Slavic province, that of the people who of old were called Vandali, but\n\nnowWinithi or Winuli.Regarding the identity and location of the Winuthior: Winuli,\n\nHelmold writes: The other river, the Oder, tending toward the north, passes through\n\nthe territory of the Winuli peoples, dividing the Pomeranians from the Wilzi. At its mouth, where its watersswel l those of the Baltic Sea, there one stood Jumen\n\n[Wolin]... Then, beyond the sluggish current of the Oder and the territory peopled\n\nby several Pomeranian tribes, there lies toward the west the country of the Winuli,\n\nof those namely, who are called Tholenzi and Redarii.\n\nWANDALO PATRE POLONORUM\n\nIn medieval Polish sources one finds the notion thatWan d al s take their name fromWan d al us, the father, progenitor of the Polish nation, of the Polish or Lechtic nation: Necno autem quatuor filios genuit, cuius primogenitus Wandalus, a quo\n\nWandalitae, qui Poloni nunc dicuntur,orti sunt. Hie ex nomine suo fluvium, qui nunc Wysla vulgariter nuncupatur, Wandalum censuit appellari, nam et mons, de quo oritur dictusfluvius Wanda ab eiusdem nomine vocitatur; Ipsa denique Wanda a. Wandalo, WandalorumidestPolonorumsiveL echitarumprogenitoe, de quo supra diximus nomen accepit; velpotest did Wanda a Wandalo scilicetflumine Wisla eo, quodeius regni centrum extiterit. The same sources trace the origin of all Slavic nations\n\nto the sons ofWan d al us: H abui t [Wan d al us] quo que m ul t o sfi l i o s, qui g en erat i o n i bus\n\nsuis ultra quartampartem Europaeper regiones et regna semen suum multiplicando possederunt, videlicet: totalRussiam adorientem, Poloniam maximam terrarum et matrem, Pomeraniam, Seleuciam, Cassubiam, Sarbiam quae nunc Saxonia dicitur, Bohemiam, Moraviam, Stiriam, Carinthiam et Sclavoniam: quae nunc Dalmacia dicitur; Chrowatiam, Pannoniam, quae nunc Ungaria dicitur, Bulgariam et alias quamplures, quarum multitudepropterprolixitatem subticetur.\n\nALBERT KRANZ\n\nAn early authority on Saxony, A. Kranz (1450-1517), author of two important\n\nhistorical treatises,V andalia (1519) andS ax onia (1520), is certain thatVan d al sare Wen d s\n\nareSlav s who are divided into many nations, Poles, Bohemians and many others. A\n\ndecade later one finds the same notion in D. Chytraei'sV andalia (1591). Kranz, Chytraei and other scholars know that the originalVan d al s were a Germanic nation, who first appear in 406 when they crossed the Rhine, invaded Gaul and Spain, established a kingom in North Africa, and sacked Rome in 455. They believe that at some early point in time Slavic peoples settled alongside the GermanicVan d al s, and that later, after the latter had departed, the Slavs occupied their lands and came to be known asVan d al s.\n\nGERMAN-SLAVVANDALS\n\nCarrying thelongtim e G erm an- S lav neighb ors and f riends notion several steps for- ward, some German writers believe that the Slavic Vandals or: Wends represent the union of\\f o n d a lo \\d n m ers left behind and Slavic newcomers in former Vandal lands. On this point, M.B. Latimi writes: Als haben sich die Witzer Wuder and andere Slaven aus\n\nSarmatien Wandalen so heuffig in diese Lender und Stette gemachlich\n\neingedrungen, und mit dem Wandalen vereinbaret und befreudent, dass darüber\n\ndie alte Teutsche Sprache corrumpiret, und die Wendische Zunge mit eingwurzeit,\n\nvermischetundgemein'worden i s(Wiasmariensis megapolitani genealochronicon,16 10 ).\n\nEINWENDE\n\nIn a less speculative spirit a German historian writes in 1508 that Sarmatians,\n\nVandals and Slavs are Wends:Sarmatha et Vandalus et Sclavus =ein W ende. Accord\n\ning to another historian of the same period, Slav is a popular name for Vandal: Vandali,\n\nquos vulgus Sclavos appelant. One finds the same notion in the title of an article by a\n\nGerman authority on the subject in the early 20th century:Wandalen = Wenden( L\n\nSteinberger, Wandalen = Wenden, AnP 37, 1915).\n\nWEND/VANDAL AUS SCYTIA\n\nIn the mid-16th century, N. Volrab, a native of Budusin, informs his readers that\n\ntheWen d s, who originated inS c y thia(di e Wen d aus Scy t i a) are also known asVan d al s\n\nandSlavs(Chronica von denA n tiq u ite te ndes KeiserlichenStrifiesd e r Romische Burgu n dS tadt Marseburg, 1556). In\n\nthe same period one of Basel's leading scholars, S. Munster (1448-1552), says the same\n\nthingind i ffe r e n t words:Vandalen wo manjetztW endennennt(Cosmographia Universaüs).\n\nVANDALS, VENEDS, SARMATS, SCYTHS\n\nRegarding the conquest and settlement of Germania, C.S. Schurzfleisch writes:\n\nVandalis Venedi, Venedis Sarmatae, Germanis Schythae successerunt... Invadunt\n\nVandalontmdi ti o n esVen ed i( O riginesPom eranic ae,16 7 3 ).\n\nVANDALOS SORABORUM NOMEN\n\nAccording to an early 17th century history of Meissen, theVan d al s who founded\n\nMeissen wereS erbs, actuallyS o rabs, a name derived fromS erb as in Ptolemy'sSarm at i an\n\nSerbs: Vandalos peculiare Soraborum nomen habuisse... cuius derivatio a Serbis...\n\nquorum Ptolemaeusm em i n i tsub sarmaticis populisi nA si a( R .R einerius,DeM isenom m\n\norigine, rebus, gestis, mutationibus, variis dominatibus, etadventuin Germanium).\n\nNUMEROUS, POWERFUL\n\nThe Vandals are prominent in M. Orbini's 1602 account of the origin of the Slavs. TheVan d al s, Orbini writes, were one of the more numerous and powerful Slav nations, who occupied a great area from the Baltic in the north to the Mediterranean in the south. According to Orbini, the Moscovites, Russians, Poles, Bohemians, Dalma- tians, Istrians, Croats and Rasians are some of the modern nations descended from the\n\nVandals.\n\nLEXICON VANDALICUM\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries it is not uncommon for German Serb scholars to\n\nrefer to the Serbs as Vandals in the title and text of studies, lexicons, and grammars:\n\nDidascalia seu Orthographia Vandalica; Enchiridion Vandalicum; Lexicon\n\nVandalicum; L inguae Vandalicae addialectum districtus Cotbusiani; Orthographia Vandalica; Principia linguae wendicae quant aliqui wandalicum vacant; Rudimenta Grammaticae Sorabo-Vandalicae Idiomatis Budissinatis; Versio VandalicaPraestandi homagiißdelitatio. Thus the full nameotS oc ietatisJ ab lanoviaae, a Leipzig based asso-\n\nciation promoting scholarly research and publication of Slavic studies, originating in the\n\n18th century, included the following ethnonymic elements: Acta Societatisjablanoviaae\n\ndeSlavis Venedis, Antis, Vilzis, Sorabis aliquid de Vandalis et Henetis. 8. QUOD TANTUM EST REGNUM\n\nT\n\nhroughout history, from the medieval to the modern, historians origi- nating in diverse geographical-national circumstances, in diverse intel- lectual-cultural traditions and perspectives, acting on the basis of similar and dif-\n\nferent sources, some known, some unknown, have reached the same or similar conclu-\n\nsions, namely that the Serbs are an ancient people, the ancestors of all or most Slavic\n\npeoples.\n\nQUOD TANTUM EST REGNUM\n\nAccording to an important 9th century source, the Bavarian Geographer'sD e sc rip -\n\ntio Civitatum ad Septentrionalem( h e r e a f t e r Descriptio Civitatum), all Slavs originate in\n\nthe immense lands of a great Serb dominion:Zeriuani, quod tantum est regnum, ut\n\nex eo cunctae gentes Sclavorum exortae sint et originem, sicut affirmant, ducant.\n\n(A realm so great that from it, as their tradition relates, all the nations of the Slavs are\n\nsprung and trace their origin).\n\nTOTIUS ORBIA ANTIQUISSIMAM EX MAXIMAM\n\nSome six centuries later one finds the same notion in another important and\n\nauthoritative source, namely Laonicus Chalcondyles' mid-15th century magnum opus,\n\nHistoriarum Demonstrations. A cautious, solid and reliable historian, Chalcondyles is\n\ncertain that the Serbs are the one of the greatest nations in the whole world in terms of\n\nage and number:Serblos autemgentem esse totius orbis antiquissimam et maximam,\n\ncompertum habeo.\n\nSERBICA\n\nCertain Serb facts on the ground in the length and breadth of Greece itself were perhaps a factor in a Byzantine Greek historian's estimation of the age and size of the Serb nation. According to Byzantine sources, a Serb principality was established in Thessaly, centered atS erbi en , not far from Mount Olympus, in the 7th century. Diverse sources\n\ndocument aS erbi aor S erbi en , a settlement and stronghold of immense strategic import\n\nnear the gorge that interrupts the mountain wall of Vermion and Olympus, through which the Bistrica River fights its way to the Aegean Coast. Later medieval Greek sources describeS erbi a as a well-fortified polis divided into three sections, the akra, where the archon lived, and the uppera n d lower sections inhabited by the politia( N.Z upanic ,T heS erb\n\nSettlement in the Macedonian Town ofSrbiste in the Vllth century and the Ethnological and Sociological Moment in the Report ofConstantinus Porphyrogenitus concerning the Advent of Serbs and Croats, Etnolog 1,1926-27; P Skok, Konstantinova. Serbia u Grckoj, Glas SkA CLX X X I, 1938; B. Ferjancic, Vizantijski isrpski Ser u X IVstolecu, 1994).\n\nSIRBANOS\n\nA 1454-55 Ottoman document records a number of Christian timar holders\n\nwith Serb-sounding names in Thessaly: Dobros, Miroslavis, Bogdanos, Bogranos,\n\nSirbanos, Rados (N.Belcideanu, Timariotes chretiens inT hessalie, SuD 42,198 3 ).A n o t h e rOt t o m a n\n\ndocument of the same period reveals a royal Serb presence in the person of Mara Brankovic,\n\ndaughter of Serbian Despot Djurach Brankovic, widow of Sultan Murad II, and step-\n\nmother of Sultan Mehmed II. This source indicates that she was granted extensive own-\n\nership of lands in the area of Serres, including two villages with Serb sounding names,\n\nJezovoandMravi nci /Muravni ca,situated southof Lake Takhinos( B .F erjandc ,T esalija uX IIl\n\niX IVveku,19 7 4).LaterOt t o m a n documents indicate that Mara granted both villages to the\n\nmonasteries of Hilandar and St. Paul on Mount Athos in 1466. Excavationsin Jezovo,\n\nnow Daphni, have uncovered architectural remains associated with Mara, including a\n\nStructurek n o w n as theT ow er ofM a ra( M .U rsinius.A nO ttom anCensusR egister for theA reaof S em s,S uD\n\n45, 1986).\n\nTHRACE, EPIRUS\n\nTheS erb ethnikon is also found near Kirk Kilise in Turkish Thrace; near Trikalla\n\nin the Trikalla-Karditsa district of Greek Thrace, where the distinguished German histo- rian,M. Vasmer, found122 Slav placenam es(Die Slavenin Griechenland,19 4l). Also near Yanina in the district of Epirus where Vasmer found no less than 334 Slav place names. Also on the rugged Chalcidic Peninsula, on the middle prongof L ongos (derived from a Slav word forw o o d la n d ), near the isthmus ofP ro v la k o s (a slightly Graecized word for\n\nisthmus).In fact, a 10th century document from this area, a testimonial signed by several\n\nSlav witnesses,is considered to be the oldest datedg la g o lith ic monument( G.S oulis, O nthe\n\nSlavic Settlement in Hierissos in the Tenth Century, Byzantion 23, 1953).\n\nSERBISTA, ZERVOKHORIA\n\nIn W.M. Leake's late 18th century account of his travels in northern Greece, one finds a number ofS erb - Z erv place names:Z ervo kh ia , one of two rivers ofMt. Pelium; the villageso f S ervu la , near Vostitza;S erp , alsoS erb ista , near Serres;Zerv o kho ri , near Negrita. On the territory of the Khimara ('the whole of the ancient Acroceraunian ridge ... the towns of Nivitza, Lukovo, Pikernes'),S erb appears in the name and ancestry of\n\none one of the leading clans, theZerv at i , who take their name from Zerva, a village\n\nof the district of Arta. There were three brothers of that village, one of whom\n\nturned Turk; another settled at Lefka at Corfu, where there is now a family of\n\nZervates;the third migratedto Suli( W.M .L eake, T ravelsinNorthern Greec e,19 6 7 ).\n\nPELOPONNESUS\n\nTheS erb ethnikon is found in greatest numbers in the Peloponnesus. In the\n\ndistrict of Argolis, near the isthmus of Corinth, a neck of land connecting the Peloponnesus to the rest of Greece; in the district of Ellis on the west coast of the Peloponnesus. Near Herata, in central Arcadia, an area rich in Slav place names; near Tryphylia in the south- western district of Messenia. At several places in the rugged southeastern district of Laconia (Sparta), an area that includes the Mani and the high and rugged Taygetos range (D.J.\n\nGeorgacas, The Medieval Names Melingi and Ezeritae of Slavic Groups in the Peloponnesus, Bz T 43, 1950). In his\n\nstudy of Slavic names in Messenian Mani, P. Malingoudis identifies a numbero f S erb -\n\nsounding toponyms common to both Germaniana n d Illyrian Serb lands, including,\n\namong others: Bolesin, Cernov, Devica, Dubrava, Godine, Golina, Gora, Gostim,\n\nKamenik, Laz, Les, Ljuta, Luka, Malotin, Mokrina, Nizina, Okci, Ostrovo, Plavina,\n\nPolica,P rosek,Radesin,Raztok,Rov,Senovica,Slavota, Vrba,Zadel( P.M alingoudis,\n\nStudien zu den slavischen Ortsnamen Griechenlands, 1981).\n\nSTRATEGIC LOCATIONS\n\nIt is interesting and perhaps significant that a number of better-known Serb settle-\n\nments in Graecia were established at highly strategic points: near Mt. Olympus; thChalcidic Peninsula; the isthmus of Corinth; near Mt. Taygetus in Laconia-Sparta. Ac- cording to Zupanic, this was certainly true of the Serb settlement near Mt. Olympus. Impressed with the obvious military character of Serb settlement, he writes:It seems to\n\nme that the first Srbisce must have a warrior camp. The Serbs came south as an\n\norganized army ... The settlement of Srbsice suggests that it served as a military\n\nbase and as an organizing point for newcomers.\n\nANCIENT GRAECIA\n\nThere is some evidence that Slav settlement can be traced as far back as the begin-\n\nnings of ancient Greece. No less an authority than Toynbee notes that some geographical\n\nnames of that period have a distinctly Slavonic filter. Indeed, he suspects thatthe\n\nancient Paiones may actually have been a Slavonic speaking people.Regarding the\n\ntime of Slavic settlement, Toynbee writes:Slavs were probably part of the Thracian\n\nand Illyrian Volkerwanderung into southeastern Europe from 1,700 to 1,800 years\n\nbefore the massive Volkerwanderung of the Slavs in the 6th and 7th centuries of the\n\nChristian era. In the year 581, John of Ephesis gives the following account of the\n\nmassive Slav Volkerwanderung in the late 6th century: An accursed people called\n\nSlavonians overran the whole of Greece ... captured the cities and overran nu-\n\nmerous strongholds . . . reduced the people to slavery, made themselves the mas-\n\nters of the whole and settled in it by means of force and dwelt in it as though it\n\nhad been their own . . . The Slavonians live at ease in the lands and dwell in it as far\n\nand wide as God permits them.Four years later, he writes: they [Slavonians] live in\n\npeace in the Roman territories, free from anxiety and fear . . . And they have grown\n\nrich in gold and silver and herds of horses and arms, and have learned to fight\n\nbetter than the Romans.'\n\nENDNOTES\n\nM. Vasmer, Die Slaven in Grieschenland, 1941. P.

WHITE SERBS\n\nI\n\nn terms of conventional sources, there is no record of proto-Polish civilization, of Poland's social and political foundations, in the centuries prior to the formation of the medieval Polish state in the 10th century. Poland enters the historical record in\n\nthe mid-10th century with several very brief references to King Mieszko (963-992).\n\nOne toKing Misaca, under whose rule the Slavs were living, a second to Mieszko,\n\nking of the north.\n\nONOMASTIC EVIDENCE\n\nNonetheless there is overwhelming onomastic evidence that the Serbs occupied\n\nmuch of the territory of prehistoric Poland and played a seminal role in the early stages\n\nof Corona Regnum Poloniae.\n\nBIALI SERBOWIE\n\nIn a mid-20th century study, the distinguished Polish historian, T. Lewicki iden-\n\ntifies numerous place names with the Serb ethnikon in core and perimeter Polish lands\n\n(T.L ewic ki,K onstantegoP of irogenety iB iali Serbowe wpolnocnjeP olsc e,R oH 22,1956).W hatism o sts i g n i f i -\n\ncant is the fact that the greatest concentrations of the more than thirty-six ethnonymic Serb place names cited are found in the geographic center of the proto-Polish nation.1 More precisely, place names at and near Gniezno, the center ofVi el ko po l ska or Great Poland, and Poznan, the first capitals of the Polish state and the seats of the first Polish metropolis and bishopric. An Old Slavic word,gniez no connotes nest, cradle, heart, core, nucleus. Recent evidence of Gniezno's primacy in Poland's historical-national con- sciousness is found in the words of Pope John Paul at Gniezno in 1979: Here I greet\n\nwith veneration the nest of the Piast, the origin of the history of the motherland.\n\nORIGIN OF THE MOTHERLAND\n\nIn this historic area, bound by the Warta river in the west, the Notec river in the north, and Lake Goplo in the east, with large fortifications at Kurswica, Gniezno, and Poznan, and smaller fortifications at Klecko, Ostros, Lednicki, Giez, Lad, and Trzemesno, in thisnest of the Piast, this origin of the history of the motherland, one finds a great number of ethnonymic Serbs. In fact, in this area Serb place names are found in greater number than anywhere at anytime in Europe.\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbin\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbina\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbino\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbice\n\nSarbino\n\nSarbicko\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbka\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbka\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbskie Huby\n\nSarbinovka\n\nMALOPOLSKA\n\nThe Serbs also appear to be the dominant Slavic element in a secondary center of Polish nationhood. Professor Lewicki finds a concentration of politically strategic Serb place names inM alopolska or Little Poland. In the lands of the ancientV islanie, from the river Vis, Visla, Vistula, centered at Vislica, one of the oldest Polish cities, the seat of legendary Prince Vislav, one finds Szarbia, Szarbia, andSzarbkov. North of Vislica, between the ancient towns of Malogoszcz and Sandomierz, one findsSarbin\n\nand Szarbsko.\n\nMAZOVIA\n\nEast ofVi el ko po l ska, the Serb ethnikon is well represented in the former Duchy of Mazovia (united with Poland in 1526) where one finds the Serb ethnikon in both place names and surnames. North ofSzarb, for example,Sarbievo is the birthplace of the great poet and classicist Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595-1649).\n\nPOMERANIA\n\nIn language, culture, and geography Pomerania was an integral part of Baltic Slavic civilization west of the Oder River. In government and politics it had strong ties with the powerfulV eletian/L utic ian federation. The same factors that tied the western Pomeranians to the Baltic Slavs separated them from the Polish Slavs. Centered on maritime city-states, the seafaring Pomeranians were far more advanced in industry, trade, commerce, and culture. Some German historians are certain that Pomerania is an original and integral Serb land.2 One historian refers toPomerania as a primary\n\nSorbenland or Surpe-Sorbenland. Another German historian writes that the entire\n\nBaltic coast to the Vistula, with the interior, was settled by Serb-Wends. Here too,\n\nof course, evidence of Serb occupation and settlement is found in such place names as\n\nSarbia, Sarbinovo, and Sarbsko.Some measure of the importance and intensity of\n\nseafaring trade in Pomerania is found in the fact that in the early 12th century Bishop Otto's missionary activities were sometimes thwarted by the fact that in one town after another, the natives were more at sea than at home:Thence we came to Colobrega,\n\nwhich is situated, on the border of the sea. As nearly all its citizens were sailors\n\nafter the manner of traders to the outer islands to do business, those who were\n\nfound at home said that they could not adopt no new course in the absence of their\n\nfellow-citizens, and on this ground they withstood the preaching of the gospel for\n\nsome time( C.H .R ob inson,T heL if e ofO ttoA postle ofPom erania 10 6 0 - 113 9 ,19 2 0 ).\n\nCONVERSION\n\nIn fact, fear of their rivals in the northwest, theV eletian- Pom eranian alliance,\n\nmay have changed thecourse of Polish history( Z .Wojtiehowsk,Poczatki ChrzesäjanstwawPolsc e na\n\ntie Stosunkov Niemiecko-Wieeckich, Zyde aM y sli3 /4,19 5 0 ).It appears that severed e fe a ts at the\n\nhands of Veletian-Pomeranian forces in 963forced Mieszko to look for help against\n\nthe warlike pagans,convert to Christianity, and seek the assistance of Christian Bohemia\n\nand other members ofChristiana respub lic a. Later, thec rusading im pulse that followed conversion will change the course of Polish history in another important way. Christian sources record and celebrate Duke Boleslav's III attacks on Pomerania in 1121 whenhe\n\nravaged the country west of the River Oder with fire and sword and announced his\n\nintention of converting all the inhabitants to the Christian faith, or of destroying\n\nthem, in the event of their refusing to be converted.Polish knights will also take an\n\nactive role in serial crusades against pagans in Prussia and Lithuania. To their credit, however, Polish authorities were the first or among the first (e.g. the indictment of the Teutonic Order by Paul Vladimir, a Polish ambassador at the church council in 1415) to rebel against the plunder and slaughter of innocent and peaceful unbelievers who refused to bow to the Holy Roman Empire, to accept Papal servitude.\n\nZIEMIA KASZUBSKA\n\nIn Eastern Pomerania, theKaszubs(gens Slavonica, Caussbitae dicuntur) of\n\nZiemia Kaszubska, a distinct historic, linguistic, and cultural Pomeranian entity, one\n\nfindstraces of a Serb past in thePolishp resen t(H .K unstm ann,Woherdie Kaschube ihrenNam en\n\nhaben,DwS 2 9 ,19 8 4).In a region calledK aszubowSlowi nski ch, one finds a modern town\n\nand lake with the Serb ethnonym, namelySarbske and Sarbske jezero, immediately\n\nwestof the better-known townand lakeof Lebaand Lebsko( ET etz ner, DieS low inz en und\n\nLebaskashcuben, 1899. L. Zablocki, O Slotvincach i Kaszubach nadlebskich, Jantar 3, 1947).\n\nSILESIAIn early German sources one finds reference to Serbs in Silesia:Sirvi, welch in\n\nSchlesien wohneten.Early and later German sources often identify Silesia as an im-\n\nportant junction in the Serb settlementof Serbska Luzi ca or Lusatia. There is evidence\n\nof Serb settlement in several place- names (e.g. Sarbino, Serby) and a Serb province or\n\nSurbiensispro v i n ci acited in themid-1 0thc e n tu ry Silesian Annals(Annales Silesiae). It is\n\ninteresting that in this area theSilesian Annals also record a stubborn resistance to the\n\nLatin rite and the defiant use of theS lav- H eneti language in church services:Slav i cae\n\nsen henetae linguae usum ...in sacris eccleaisasticis... inibuitac latin lingua concipi\n\nliturgiamprecesaquejussit.Several mountains in Silesia, Mts. Sobotka and Radunia,\n\nwere longn o to rio u s centers of pagan rituals. Referring to Mt. Sobotka, Bishop Thietmar\n\nwrites in the early 11th century:It was the object of great veneration on the part of all\n\nthe people because of its size and purpose, for iniquitous mysteries were celebrated\n\nthere. The following century finds Sileisia's Bishop of Wroclaw engaged in search-and-\n\ndestroy missions against pagan cult centers where wooden images of old gods were kept.\n\nIn the 19th century the pagan past was alive and well in such folk sayings as the one cited\n\nby J.K ollar:Kto nanasuSobot kuneprigdze; roroka hoglavabolecbudze(H .Cehak-\n\nHolubowicza, Olimp Slaska in Szkice z dziejow Slaska, 1955; Kamienne konstrukcje kultowe pod szczytem napolnocnym\n\nsotku gory Slez, Swiatowit 23, 1960).\n\nENDNOTES\n\nS.

It is a matter of record that the Serb ethnonym was as common east of the Oder as it was in theWhite Serb heartland west of the\n\nOder. East of the Oder,1 oppositeSerbska Biota (Serb Marsh) and Serbska Hola (Serb\n\nHeath) inSerbska Luzica (Serb Lusatia), one finds the place namesZorbenov,\n\nSarbinovo, Serbovand Sarby.\n\nBORDERS\n\nIn his 10th century magnum opus, al-Masvudi writes: the Bobr, Elbe and Saale rivers mark the borders ofWhite Serbia (Muruj ahd-dhahab wa ma'adin aljawahir). One of the more authoritative modern studies, J. Marquart's outlinesWhite Serbia's borders in similar terms: from the Bobr in the east, across the Elbe, to the Saale in the west( O steuropaisc heS treiß uege,19 0 3 ). At its height, most historianste n dto placeWhi t e Serbi a's eastern borders deeper into later Polish territory. Gebhardt, for example, places Silesia and western Poland up to the Vistula withinWhite Serbia's 8th century borders(L. A.\n\nGebhardt, Geschichte aller Wendische-SlawischenS taaten,17 9 0 ).InH erkunf tderB altisc henWenden( 18 7 2 )\n\nQuandt extendsWhite Serbia's borders in the east to includeWhite Serb concentra- tions at Opole, Poznan, Kaliscz and Gniezno.2 Noting the location of theSurpe Serbs recorded by Alfred the Great (871-899), Quandt is certain that the Serbs of Germania,\n\nVielkopolska and Opole/Silesia are one people:The Surpe are one and the same as\n\nthe Opolini and the people who live in Poznan, Kaliscz and Gniezno. It is interest-\n\ning and should be noted that in recent time, viewing the facts of the matter from an entirely different perspective, H. Kunstmann traces Opolin and Polin to Balkan Slav roots (Wer waren die Opolini des Geographus Bavarus Bavarus, und woher kommt das\n\nEthnonym Polonia? ).\n\nTO THE BUG\n\nSafarik and other noted Slavists are certain that at one timeWhite Serbia's borders reached the Bug and beyond. Some scholars are certain that the ancientBuz han i were originally Serbs. For example, the noted historian G. Krek writes:In ancient\n\ntimes on the Bug were the Buzhani, a Slavic tribe, who were once called Serbs. A\n\nlarge and powerful tribe comprising some 231c ities in the mid-9th century( B usani\n\nhabentc ivitatesCCX X X I),occupyingth e borderlands separating Poland fromW h ite\n\nRus, Red Rus and Kiev Rus, theBuz han i ('buzhane, zane sedosha po Bugu'), later, the\n\nVolyni or Volynians ('poslezhe zhe velynane') occupied a large stretch of the river Bug.\n\nOnBuz hi an territory, on the west bank of the Bug, was a region known asCz erv i a. Authoritative German and Polish historians, J. Marquart and J. Otrebski among oth- ers, suspect that theCz erv s ofCz erv i a wereS erbs. The well-known cities ofCz erv i a\n\n('ziemia Grodov Czervienskich'), centered at Czervien, included Czervien, near Czermno\n\non the Huczwa, and the historic cities of Chelm and Volyn. It is perhaps interesting and coincidental that one of the lesser-known cities had the highly uncommon name of Sutieska or Sutjeska as in Sutjeska on the border of Bosnia and Montenegro.\n\nBOIKI\n\nEvidence in favor of this general area as an ancient Serb homeland and point of departure for Serbs moving westwards is found in a primary Byzantine source, namely Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus sDe A dm inistrando Im perio. Regarding the ori- gin of the Balkan Serbs, where the Serbs originally dwelt, Constantine writes:The Serbs\n\nare descended from the unbaptized Serbs, also calledWhi t e, who lived beyond\n\nTurkey [Hungary] in a place called by them Boiki, where the neighbor is Francia\n\n(N. Zupanic, Bela Srbija, Narodna starina 1, 1922).\n\nG ALICIA\n\nNoting that Byzantine sources are often in error in matters beyond their imme- diate scope in time and space, some of the early Slav specialists, Safarik, Surowiecki, and other outstanding scholars, including the great Czech scholar Dobrovsky and the Croat F. Racki, are certain that Constantine's statement is in error regarding the loca- tion ofBo i ki . They believe that Constantine confused thederivative Serbs of Bohe- mianBo i ki with theoriginal Serbs of GalicianBo i ki ,the Bo i ki district of eastern Galicia, a territory believed to be an ancient and direct link between the Eastern and Southern Slavs.\n\nBOIKI HIGHLANDERS\n\nIn modern timesBo i ki refers to a distinct Slavic community, Ukrainian high- landers who differ from their Slavic neighbors (e.g. Lemkos/Rusnaks, Hutsuls) in lan- guage, dress, architecture, and customs, and who have preserved many ancient customs and rituals that disappeared in other parts of Galicia and Ukraine.

FROM THE UNBAPTIZED SERBS\n\nWHO DWELL ON THE RIVER VISLA\n\nI\n\nmpressive evidence that some of the Balkan Serbs originated in Poland is found inDe Administrando Imperio. In his treatise, Emperor Constantine Pophyrogenitus informs us that inZahumlja, a principality in coastal Serbia:The\n\nfamily of the patrician Mihailo Visevich, son of Viseta, prince of the Zahumlyans,\n\ncame from the unbaptized Serbs who dwell on the river Visla and are called Litziki.\n\nLITZIKIMost historians tend to agree with 319th century Polish historiography that the\n\nnameL itz iki is derived fromlug, an Old Slav word for moor, marshland, pasture, woodland, and wasteland. Thus Lugizi, Ligizi, Litziki and other variations are parallel archaic names for theP olanie, a name derived from an Old Slav word with similar connotations. According to L. Niederle, however, it is more likely thatL itz iki is a ge- neric name for Poles, derived from one of the better known and westernmost Polish tribes/nations, theL ic ic aviki as in:Sclav i qui di cun tur L i ci cav i kiand lo n g i us deg en tes\n\nbarbari...L i ci cav i ki , bordering with Serb lands westof theOd e r( J . Widajewicz, Licicaviki\n\nWidukina, SIO 6, 1927. G. Labuda, Licicaviki, SsS 3, 1967).\n\nVIS, VISLA, VISEVIC, VISEVO\n\nThe patronymicVisevich certainly suggests aV is/V isla/V islani origin for the house of Visevich. In several place names in medievalZahumlja one finds toponymic evidence in favor of a Vislanian origin of other Serb lineages: e.g.V isevaz upa or county;\n\nViseva, a local name for the upper Neretva( T . Wasilewski, Administraja bizantynska naz iem iac h\n\nskwianskich i jej polityka wobec Slowian w XI-XII w, KwA 70, 1973; Wislanska dynastia ijej zachlumskie panstwo w\n\nIX-Xw,PaM 15, 1965).\n\nCIVITATES OMNES ROMANOOS\n\nAnti-Byzantine and pro-Bulgarian in orientation, a close ally of the very learned and powerul ruler of Bulgaria and champion of Slavdom, Tsar Simeon (893-927), seated at Preslav,Mi hai lo Visevich was a force in affairs beyond the borders of Zahumlja: In\n\nthe year 925 Pope John X invites Mihailo (Michaele exellentissimo duce\n\nChulmorum), along with Tomislav of Croatia, to take part in the resolution of\n\nchurch affairs in Croatia-Dalmatia.\n\nAn inscription found at Ston suggests thatMi hai lo considered himself the su-\n\npreme authority in the affairs of Byzantine towns along the Dalmatian coast:\n\nMIHAELVS FORTITER SVPER REGO PACIFICO\n\nCIVITATES OMNES ROMANOOS.\n\nREX SCLAVORUM CIVITATEM SIPONTUM\n\nMihailo was also a force to be reckoned with on the opposite shore of the Adriatic,\n\non the Apulian spur of the Italian boot. Crossing the Adriatic, in 926Mihailo con- quered Byzantine Siponto, opening the way for greater Serb settlement in the Gargano peninsula.Comprendit Michael rex Sclavorum civitatem Sipontum.\n\nSERBS CONTRA SERBS\n\nDecade's later Serb settlements in southern Italy will lead toS erbs originating\n\nin Illyria by way of Poland(?), fighting against invadingS erbs originating in Germania's\n\nWhite Serbia. In the year 981, Serb forces recruited in southeastern Italy, reinforced\n\nby some 40,000S erb mercenaries under the commandof Vukasin(4 0 ,0 0 0 pag an i\n\ncondotti dalloro reBuUicassinus), take an active role in the defense of Calabria against\n\nthe forces of Emperor Otto of Germany, includingS erb forces from Germania'sWhi t e\n\nSerbiaand Serb knights serving in Otto's personal bodyguard.\n\nZUPAN GLUBISA\n\nIt appears that in some instances the Serbs survived as an independent national-\n\npolitical community as late as the mid-11th century: When Serb zupans (e.g. zupan\n\nAndreas, zupan Glubisa) are found at the head of a number of communities in the\n\nGargano area (e.g. Devia, Varano) where natives with Serb personal names are re-\n\ncorded (e.g. Drago, Radovit).In this general area one finds numerous references to\n\nSlavic settlements in family names (e.g. Scavone, Schiavone, Cito, Pribo, Pissichio,\n\nStano), in village names (e.g. Castellucium de Slavis, L esin, Peschici, Schiavt),a n d\n\ntoponyms (e.g.rione degli Schiavonia, Monte Schiavoni, Ponte degli Schiavoni,\n\nSchiauni, Ponte Schiavo, Piano Schiavt).^\n\nSRBLYI, POLES\n\nOne moment in the second half of the 14th century makes it very clear that the Bosnian Serbs believed that the Serbs and Poles were one people, who, sharing a com- mon ancestry, had an obligation to assist one another in times of trouble, in this in- stance, the Turkish threat.\n\nKRAL SERBLEM\n\nIn 1440, Stevan Tvrtko II (1440-43), King of Bosnia and all the Serbs\n\n(MILOSTYU BOZHNOM MI GOSPODIN KRAL SERBLEM) asserting a common\n\nancestry, language and interest, sought assistance from the newly elected Slavic king of\n\nHungary, the Pole Vladislav Varnecik (1440-1444).\n\nISTI PRADJEDOVI\n\nThe letter and spirit of this earlyP an- S lav moment are a matter of historical record. Contemporaneous Hungarian sources offer a clear statement of the thesis ad- vanced by Stevan Tvrkto's emissaries to Vladislav's court at Budim, namely the com- mon ancestry of the Poles and Serbs(Srbly i ). A Croat translation of the Latin original reads as follows odje i od kralja bosanskoga sjajne poslanstvo odlicnih muzeva.\n\nOvi su izpricavsi porietlo svoga plemena izticali, da su Bosnjakom isti pradjedovi bili, koji i Poljakom, te da im je zajednicki jezik, koji govore; i da se radi te rek bi srodnosti jezika i porietla njihov kralj zivo raduje, sto je Vladislav—kako se pronio\n\nglas—sretan u svojih podhvatih. Mongo su nadalje izticali priliku, kako bi se radi\n\nsrodnosti i susjedstva mogli, dapace i morali ujedinjenom snagom i savjetom medju\n\nsobom pomagati proti uzasnomu zulumu turskomu, koji im prieti. Osim toga\n\nzatrazise, da se ugovor i prijateljstvo, koje su svi dotadanji kraljevi najvecom svetoscu\n\npostivali i cuvali, medju Bosnom i Ugarskom ili sklopi ili obnovi. Poslanikom bi\n\nmilostivo odgovoreno: da je pravo, sto se uspjeh i i napredak Vladislavov njihovu kralju svidja, toll radi onoga srodstva jezika i porietla, koje spominju, koli radi\n\ntoga, sto je jednim i drugim malo ne jednako do toga, da se sto prije sva Ugarska umiri te krjepkimi silatni proti zajednickomu dusmaninu vojna povede. Zatitn im zahvalise, sto je njihov kralj sam obrekao, da ce u zgodan cas pomagati Ugarskoj proti Turkom i zborom i tvorom, pa ih obodrise, neka bi kralj do kraja uztrajao u\n\ntojnamisli.Napokon bjeugovormedjukraljevi ikraljevinamiutvrdjen( VK laic ,\n\nPovijest Bosna: Do Propoasti Kraljevstva, 1882).\n\nMORE TURKISH THAN THE TURKS\n\nIn fact, of course, then and later, the Polish moment in Bosnia's affairs are far from fraternal. Polish knights take part in serial crusades against the good Christians of Bosnia. Centuries later, Poles serving in Ottoman and Austrian occupation armies and administrations are notorious for their hostility to the native population. An 1877 incident recorded in Pristina perhaps captures the letter and spirit of the Polish mo-\n\nment:The books at Prishtina were from Belgrade, but as they seemed only to have\n\nchitankas adapted for the youngest children, we asked if they had not some histo-\n\nries of Serbia. The master looked furtively around, and then said that he had some,\n\nbutdared not to usethemopenly.\"Why not?\"\" B ec ause theo ffi cers of theT urki sh\n\nregimentsf req uen t l y comean d lollabo ut in ourscho o l, and the cavalryo ffi cersare\n\noften Hungarians,C o ssackso r Poles,an d ean readt he Slavic books.\"\"Butthesedr y\n\nhistories contain nothing revolutionary, and surely the officers who are your fel-\n\nlow Christians would not wish to caluminate you.\"\"The rest would not, but the\n\nPoles are more Turkish than the Turks themselves. One day a Polish officer looked over the shoulder of one of the children, and called out: 'Holla, master! What do I see here? These books come from the principality [Serbia], and here is something about the history of Serbia. If I catch you at this again, I shall report you to the authorities'. I trembled from head to foot and knew not what I would say or do; but luckily there was also present a Cossack, a deserter from the Russian service, a good man who always befriended us; he got the Pole out of the room, and said to him in displeasure that they were not sent to Prishtina to meddle with the Serb school( G .\n\nMuir Mackenzie, A. P. Irby, The Slavonic Provinces of Turkey in Europe, 1877).\n\nTHE BLACK POPE\n\nIn World War II, it should be noted, Moslem leaders placed the blame for the crusading war and genocide against the Serbs and the chaos in Bosnia squarely on the shoulders of the Austro-Polish 'Black Pope,' Wladimir Ledochowski, Superior General of the Jesuits, who, perhaps inspired byd eran g ed visions of adi v i n e Polish mission, appears to have supported a Roman Catholic crusade againstsc hi sm at i c s in eastern and southeastern Europe.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nM.

Some scholars suspect that some of\n\nthe nations so-named are Slavs, perhaps Serbs, namely theAl-mizuri, Milcani Serbs; the\n\nTono-sursi, Surs-Serbs; the Iti-mari, Moravi Serbs; the Boiski, Boiski Serbs, Emperor\n\nConstantine VII's Boiki Serbs.\n\nSTRAVA\n\nPriscus' account of his visit to Attila's camp in Pannonia also reveals strongs Slavic\n\ntraces in the personal names, food, drink, and customs of the Huns and their Scythian\n\nallies: millet//>rar0; honey/medos; funeral feast/strava). Especially striking is the Slavic funeral\n\nceremony or Strava following Attila's death in 454: After he had been mourned\n\nwith such lamentations they celebrated a 'Strava' as they call it, over his tomb with\n\ngreat revelry, coupling opposite extremes of feeling in turn among themselves.\n\nA SLAVIC TRIBE\n\nC.D. Gordon's authoritative translation and commentary on 5th century Greek\n\nhistorians gives important information on the Sciri or Scyri, a Slavic tribe, once part\n\nof die Hunnish empire (The Age ofAttila, i960). We learn that: 1) The Sciri, who had\n\nsettled in Lower Moesia on the Danube, were a power in Pannonia where they were\n\nin more or less constant conflict with the Goths; 2) the Sciri played an important role\n\nin the Western armies commanded by Ricimer [appointed commander of imperial\n\narmies by emperor Avitus] and his successors; 3) the Sciri formed an important\n\npart of Odovacar's army in his final conquest of Italy; 4) Odovacar, the first barbarian\n\nking of Italy, either sprang from the race of Thuringi on his father's side and the\n\nSciri on his mother's side, according to one account, or he was of the nation of the\n\nScyri, according to another.\n\n[Sea of Azov], stretch northward a distance of fifteen days journey.Polybius locates\n\nSarmafia in thePonto-C aspiansteppe( H istona). Ptolemy'sS arm atia is animmensearea\n\nbounded by the Vistulaand Volga rivers and the Balticand Black seas( GeographikeH y phegesis). Pomponius Mela givesS arm atia a European orientation, namely the lands east of the Elbeand northof the Danube( DeS ituO rb is).\n\nSARMATS\n\nSimilarly,S arm at orS arm atae (also Sarabatiae, Sauromatae, Syrmatae, and\n\nSermende among others) succeeds Scythor Scythae more often than not as a learned\n\narchaism for the Slavs (e.g.Sarmatae Sclavi). Pliny, Tacitus and Ptolemy refer to the Slavs on the Vendic/Baltic Sea and the Vistula River as Sarmats. Ptolemy, for example, writes:H abi t an t Sarm at i am g en t es m ax i m ae Ven ed aepro pt ert o t um Ven ed i cum si n um ;\n\nMinores autem gentes Sarmatiam incolunt iuxta Visutalam infra Venedas Gythanes.\n\nMela locatesS arm atia east of Germania:G erm an i ad Sarm at as po rri g un t ur. Precisely\n\nwhereGerm ania ends andS arm atia begins, however, was a matter of some confusion. In\n\nDe Origine et Situ Germanorum (A.D. 98), a somewhat garbled description of the vari-\n\nous tribes west of the Rhine and north of the Danube, believed to be based largely on\n\nout-of-date material, Tacitus is not sure whether some nations wereGerm ans orS arm ats.\n\nHere Suebia ends. I am not sure whether the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti should\n\nbe assigned to the Teutons or to the Sarmatians ... The Venedi have adopted many\n\nSarmatian habits; for their plundering takes them over all the wooded and moun-\n\ntainous highlands that lie between the Peucini and the Fenni. Nevertheless, they\n\nare one the whole to be classed as Germans; for they have settled homes, carry\n\nshields, and are fond of traveling—and travelling as—on foot, differing in all\n\nthese respects from the Sarmatians.\n\nSUEBI\n\nIt is important to note that theS uebi , who occupy Germania's heartland, are also\n\na problem of sorts for Tacitus. TheS uebi , Tacitus writes,do not constitute a single\n\nnation. They occupy more than half Germany, and are divided into a number of\n\nseparate tribes under different names, though all are called by the generic name\n\nSuebi.In the early 1820s, D. Popp was one of the first German historians to identify\n\nTacitus'S uebi with the Slavs.\n\nNOT ALL SARMATIANS\n\nAt the same time it was clear to ancient and modern historians thatS arm at and\n\nSarmatia4 referred to an immense area inhabited by numerous and different nations,\n\nSlavs and others. In the succinct words of one scholar: All Slavs are Sarmatians, but all\n\nSarmatians are not Slavs.\n\n2. ILLYRIA, DALMATIA\n\nI\n\nn opposition to a northeast-southwest Slav invasion/settlement thesis, a contrary position has evolved in German historical scholarship—that the Slavs of Germany, Poland, and bordering lands originated in Serb lands between the Danube and the\n\nAdriatic, namely the former Roman provinces of Illyria and Dalmatia.1\n\nTHE ILLYRIA / DALMATIA THESIS\n\nIn terms of the Serb-Wend settlement of Germania, the Illyria/Dalmatia thesis has deep roots in German historical scholarship, dating from C. Schottgen and G. Keysig in the early 18th century to H. Kunstmann in the late 20th century.\n\nORIGINATED IN SARMATIA\n\nSchottgen and Kreysig find no fault with the notion that Germania's Serb-Wends originated in Sarmatia, in an area between the Volga, the Caucasus, and the Sea of Azov. However, they find fault with the favored notion that the Serb-Wends entered Germania from the north and east. They absolutely reject the views of such writers as T.\n\nSegerus: What, I ask, is more obvious and certain than that the Serbs from Misin/\n\nMeissenestabli shedtheki ngdoms ofSlavoni a andSerbi a i nIllyri a?(T .S egerus,DeS lavis\n\netLecho, 1725).\n\nFROM THE SOUTH\n\nIn fact, they write, the evidence is clear that the exact opposite is true: (1) the Serb-Wends did not enter Germania from the northby way of Prussia and Pomerania; (2) the Serb-Wends entered Germania from the south, from Illyria,by way of Moravia\n\nand Czechia^ (3) the Serb-Wends of Germania did not establish Serb kingdoms in\n\nIllyria; (4) the Illyrian Serbs migrated to, settled in, and established the Serb-Wend\n\nkingdomsofme di e va lG ermani a( C.S c hongen, G.K rey sig,Diplom atisc heun dC uri euse Nac hlehre der\n\nHistoricvon Ober-Sachsenund antgrentzendenlanden,17 3 0 ).ThemanyOnomasti c,li n gui st i c , a n d\n\ncultural parallels between the original Illyrian Serb lands and the derivative Germania\n\nSerb-Wend lands, they write, are simply too great to have it any other way.\n\nH. KUNSTMANN\n\nOne of the foremost exponents of this thesis in modern times is the renowned German Slavist, H. Kunstmann. His broad, deep, and exhaustive research has led him to suspect that (1) the Slavs of Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Russia and neighbor- ing lands originated in the Balkans, mainly Illyria/Dalmatia; that (2) the ethnonyms, ruling dynasties, place names, hydronyms and toponyms in West Slav and East Slav lands often can be traced to Slavic and slavicized roots in Illyria and bordering lands.\n\nOver several decades, in a series of always interesting and often provacative ar- ticles, Kunstmann has tirelessly advanced the onomastic, linguistic, textual, and other evidence in support of his thesis. While his views, in the order of suggestive and explor- ative inquiries, have not gained general acceptance, Kunstmann is not a minority of one. In fact, his views have varying degrees of general and specific support at the high- est levels of historical and linguistic scholarship. ANCIENT CENTER OF CIVILIZATION IN EUROPE\n\nEven the most learned, authoritative, and compelling advocates of a Near East\n\norigin of Indo-Europeans, V.V. Ivanov and T.V. Gamkrelidze, make certain concessions\n\nto the Danubia thesis(The MigrationofT rib es Speakingthe Indo-European Dialectsf rom their Original\n\nHomeland in the Middle Eastto their Historical Habitationsin Eurasia, InD 13, 1985).Theya d m i t(1) th a t\n\nthe Balkan area was the most ancient center of civilization in Europe; and (2) that the picture of the original Proto-Indo-European landscape derived from the linguistic re- construction of the proto-language rules out Central and Eastern Europe, excepting southeastern Europe.\n\nONE OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS\n\nIn response to Diakonov s critique, they go so far as to write: Actually, Diakonov's\n\nalternative, the Balkano-Carpathian hypothesis, is merely one of several possible\n\nsolutions within our hypothesis on the original homeland. We reconstruct a wider\n\narea—from the Balkans to Iran and southern Turkmenia—as the expanse within\n\nwhich the Indo-European original homeland might have been located in a definite\n\nterritory (TV. Gamkrelidze, V.V. Ivanov,T he Problem of the Original Homeland of theS peakers of Indo-European\n\nLanguages in Response to I.M. Diakonov's Article, InD 13, 1985).\n\nORIGINATED IN DANUBIA-PANNONIA\n\nThe following are some of the supportive points found in the works of distin- guished linguists, historians and Slavists: (1) The Slavs originated in Danubia-Pannonia; (2) Not all Slavs migrated northward from the Danube, some remained (thus the dense Slavic population and Slavic toponymy, the antiquity of Slavic waternames in pre-Hun- garian Pannonia-Danubia), others migrated south; (3) The Balkan South Slavs origi- nated in Pannonia-Danubia; (4) The Eastern Slavs originated in the south; (5) Place names and ethnonyms with apparent Balkan roots are found throughout Slavdom (e.g.\n\nDaksa, an island in the Adriatic, Doksy, in Czechoslovakia; Dukla, a mountain pass in\n\nthe Carpathians,D u k lja , in Montenegro;L ic ic a v ik i, a Slavic tribe in western Poland,\n\n*Liccavici in Illyria).\n\nWith regard to Germania, it should be noted that one of the greatest names in modern German Slavistics, J. Herrmann, concedes a possible connection between the great numbers of Serbs recorded in middle Danubia and along the Byzantine frontier in the 6th century and Serb settlements in Germania:Es ist... warscheinlich, dass aus\n\ndem Stamm der Serben/Sorben, der am Ende des 6 Jh. im mitteleren Donaugebiet\n\nan den Grenzen von Byzanz stand und der sich mit dan Awaren auseinanderzusetzen\n\nhatte,ei nTeilausschi ed undnordwärtswanderte(J .H errm ann,DieSlawen inDeutsc hland:\n\nGeschichte und Kultur der slawischen Stamme westlich von Oder und Niesse vom 6. bis 12. Jahrhundert, 1985).\n\nENDNOTES\n\n' All attempts to traceA lban i a andA l ban i an roots to ancientI lly ri a andlUy ri an s run contary to the first and last\n\nwords of authoritative scholarship. On this subject, V. I. Georgiev, for example, perhaps the single greatest author-\n\nity on ancient Balkan linguistics and onomastics, writes:But many linguists and historians ... have put forward\n\nvery important considerations indicating that the Albanians cannot be autochthonic in present-day Alba- nia; that their original home was the eastern part of Mysia Superior, or approximately Dardania and Dacia Mediterranea, i.e., the northern central region of the Balkan peninsula, and part of Dacia. However, since it has become clear that Daco-Mysian and Thracian represent two different IE languages, the problem of the origin of the Albanian language and the Albanians themselves appears in a new light. The most important facts and considerations for determining the original habitat of the Albanians are the following: (a) The Illyrian toponyms known from antiquity, e.g. Skhoder from the ancient Scodra (Livius), Tomor from Tomaros (Strabo, Pliny, etc.), have not been directly inherited in Albanian: the contemporary form of these names do not correspond to the phonological laws of Albanian. The same also applies to the ancient toponyms of Latin origin in this region, (b) The most ancient loanwords from Latin in Albanian have the phonetic form of Eastern Balkan Latin, i.e., of proto-Rumanian, and not of Western Balkan Latin, i.e., of Old Dalmatian Latin. Albanian therefore, did not take its borrowings from Vulgar Latin as spoken in Illyria. (c) The Adriatic coast was not part of the original homeland of the Albanians because the maritime terminology of Albanian is not their own but borrowed from different languages, (d) Another indication against local Albanian ori- gin is the insignificant number of ancient Greek loanwords in Albanian. If the earliest habitat of the Alba- nians had been Albania itself, the Albanian language would have to have many more ancient Greek loanwords. (e) Another indication against local Albanian origin is the insignificant number of ancient Greek loanwords in Albanian. If the earliest habitat of the Albanians had been Albania itself, the Albanian language would have to have many more ancient Greek loanwords, (f) TheU rheim at of the Albanians must have been near that of the proto-Rumanians. The oldest Latin elements in Albanian come from proto-Rumanian, i.e., Eastern Balkan Latin, and not from Dalmatian, i.e., Western Balkan Latin that was spoken in Illyria ... The agreement in the treatment of Latin words in Rumanian and in Albanian shows that Albanian developed from the 4th to the 6th century where proto-Rumanian was taking shape, (g) Rumanian possesses about a hundred words which have their correspondence only in Albanian. The form of these Rumanian words is so peculiar that they cannot be explained as borrowings from Albanian. This reflects the Dacian substratum in Rumanian, whereas the Albanian correspondences are inherited from Daco-Mysian (V. I. Georgiev, The\n\nEarliest Ethnological Situation of the Balkan Peninsula as Evidenced by Linguistic and Onomastic Data, Aspects of\n\nthe Balkans: Continuity and Change, 1972).Illyria, D\n\n3. REGNUM SLAVORUM\n\nB\n\nefore we briefly review Kunstmann's articles on the subject, in order to\n\nbetter understand Kunstmann's references to Serb lands south of the\n\nDanube, to historic Serb lands in Illyria/Dalmatia, a brief review of the histori-\n\ncal record is necessary.\n\n1. DE ADMI NI STRANDO IMPERIO\n\nCompiled by Emperor Constantine Pophyrogenitus VII (905-959),D e\n\nAdministrando Imperio is an authoritative source of political, geographic, and demo-\n\ngraphic information about Serb states in maritime and interior Dalmatia.\n\nMARITIME SERBIA\n\nFour Serb states are located in maritime Serbia/Dalmatia: Pagania, Zachlumia,\n\nTerbounia-Kanali, and Dioclea/Duklja.\n\nMARITIME STATES\n\nRegarding the Serb antecedents and borders of the maritime states, Constantine\n\ngives the following information.\n\nPAGAN!\n\nThese same Pagani are descended from the unbaptized Serbs . . . The Pagani are so called because they did not accept baptism when all the Serbs were baptized ... From the river Orontius (Neretva) begins Pagania and stretches as far as the river Zentina (Cetina) ... Also they possess these islands: the large island of Kourka or Kilter (Korcula); another large island, Meleta or Malozeatai (Mljet); another large island, Phara (Hvar); another large island, Bratzis (Brae).1\n\nZACHLUMI\n\nThe Zachlumi are Serbs... They were called Zachlumi from a so-called mount Chlumo, and indeed in the tongue of the Slavs 'Zachlumi' means 'behind the moun- tain' ... From Ragusa begins the domain of the Zachlumi amd stretches along as far as the river Orontius; and on the side of the coast it is neighbor to the Pagani, but on the side of the mountain country it is neighbor to the Croats on the north and to Serbia at the front.\n\nTERBOUNITES, KANALITES\n\nThe country of the Terbounites and the Kanalites is one. The country of Kanali is subordinate to Terbounia. The inhabitants are descended from the un- baptized Serbs ... The princes of Terbounia have always been at the command of the prince of Serbia ... From the city of Decatera (Kotor) begins the domain of Terbounia and stretches along as far as Ragusa and on the side of the mountain country it is neighbor to Serbia.\n\nDIOCLEA\n\nDioclea gets its name from the city in the country that the emperor Diocletian\n\nfounded, but now it is a deserted city, though still called Dioclea. Dioclea is neigh bor to the forts of Dyrrachium (Serb Drac) ... and comes up as far as Decatera, and\n\non the side of the mountain country it is neighbor to Serbia. In the country of\n\nDioclea are the large and inhabited cities of Gradetai, Nougrade, Lontodokla.\n\nSERBIA-BOSNIA\n\nOne Serb state is located in interior Serbia/Dalmatia: Serbia-Bosnia:B aptized\n\nSerbia with its inhabited cities of Destinikon, Tzernabouskei, Medyretous, Dresneik, Lenik, Salines (Soli/Tuzla); and in the territory of Bosnia, Katera and Desnik ... For the country of Serbia is at the front of all the rest of the countries, but on the north is neighbor to Croatia, and on the south Bulgaria.2\n\n2. PRESBYTERIA DIOCLEATIS REGNUM SLAVORUM\n\nPresbyteria Diocleatis Regnum Slavorum, better known as Ljetopis Popa Dukljanina\n\n(The Chronicle of Reverend Dukljanin), a late 12th century chronicle is the earliest native\n\nsource of early medieval history.\n\nEX SCLAVONICA LITTERA\n\nAccording toR everend Dukljanin, actually an anonymous Roman Catholic priest from Bar, the Chronicle is a compilation of historic facts that were a matter of common knowledge, translated from the original Slavic into the Latin(ex sclavonica littera\n\nverteram in L atinam). In spite of the fact that some parts are obviously more legend\n\nthan fact (e.g. the arrival of the father of the nation), that some parts are colored by certain cycles common to medieval chronicles (e.g. the conversion of the nation to Christianity; the role of the Church in the organization of the kingdom, in the corona- tion of kings), it remains an invaluable source of information. More than once, modern critics have been forced to take a step or two back. In the past, for example, editors routinely dismissed a reference toT em plana, said to be an area settled by Oistrolo, the father of the nation, as a matter of legend or imagination. Recent scholarship, however, has revealed that the area around Skadar, a capital city, was at one time known as\n\nTeplanaor Templana, and known as such as late as the mid- 18th century. In an August\n\n25, 1736, report to Rome, for example, Bishop Antonio Vladagni writes: I popoli de\n\nScuttari come Teplana, ehe consiste in case Cattoliche.\n\nALL OF DALMATIA\n\nThe ancient Slavs, pagan and barbarian, led byOi strolo, Dukljanin writes,con-\n\nquered all of Dalmatia, including the coast and the highlands.Settling in Duklja,\n\nOistrolo establishes the house of Oistrolovic, a line that will rule without interruption\n\ninto the mid-12th century.\n\nKINGDOM OF DUKLJA-DALMATIA\n\nOn the coast, the kingdom runs fromVi nodol in the north toDrac in the south, inland, from the Sava and Danube rivers in the north to theAdriatic in the south.\n\nDUKLJA\n\nDuklja is the absolute center of the kingdom. From Duklja, the house of\n\nOistrolovic will send brothers, sons, and kin to govern the constituent provinces LAKE SKADAR\n\nDuklja itself is centered in the territory surrounding Lake Skadar, anchored at Duklja, Skadar, and Bar, with strong fortification on its flanks at Koplik and Oblik, with favored residences, monasteries and churches on thin strips of land running along both sides of Mt. Rumija.\n\nHEARTLAND\n\nIn this heartland national assemblies are held, kings are crowned, royal resi- dences are established, and royal families are buried (e.g. Church of St. Andrew, Papratna; Church of St. George, Bar; Church of St. Mary, Duklja; Church of St. Mary, Krajina; Church of St. Sergius, Bojana).\n\nCHRISTIANITY\n\nWith the advice of St. Cyril, King Svetopelek( rexst an ct i ssi m us) brings Chris- tianity to the Slavs of Dalmatia. At a great national assembly held on the plain of Dalma, Svetopelek establishes two archbishoprics in Dalmatia: one in Solin, the other in Duklja.\n\nARCHBISHOPRIC OF SOLIN\n\nThe archbishopric of Solin includes the bishoprics of Split, Trogir, Skradin,\n\nZadar, Nin, Rab, Osor, Krk and Epidaur.\n\nARCHBISHOPRIC OF DUKLJA\n\nThe archbishopric of Duklja includes the bishoprics of Bar, Budva, Kotor, Ulcinj,\n\nSvac, Skadar, Drivast, Pulat, Serbia, Bosnia, Travunia, and Zahumlja.\n\nPRIMORJE, ZAGORJE\n\nIn a manner consistent with ancient boundaries and notions, Svetopelek also\n\nreorganizes his kingdom. In the first instance, he divides the kingdom into two basic\n\nparts rimorje or Maritime Dalmatia and Serbia or Zagorje/Interior Dalmatia.\n\nPrimorje includes lands crossed by rivers flowing into the Adriatic, Zagorje, lands\n\ncrossed by rivers flowing into the Danube.\n\nPRIMORJE\n\nPrimorje is made up of two parts:Lower Dalmatia(Dalmatia inferior), from\n\nVinodol to Omis, and Upper Dalmatia(Dalmatia superior), from Omis to Drac.\n\nZAGORJE\n\nZagorje is also made up of two parts:Bosnia, from the Drina -west to the\n\nPinna mountains, and Raska, from the Drina east to the Lab and Sitnica rivers.\n\nDUBROVNIK\n\nDubrovnik is a new city inP rimorje. It was founded by Pavlimir, grandson of exiled king Radoslav of Duklja. Returning to Dalmatia, Pavlimir lands near Gruz and Ombla, where, his ranks swelled by loyalists from Travunia and Hum, he establishes a fortified settlement. The mainland was settled by Serbs and called Dubrovnik, from the Serb wordsdub (oak) anddub rava (oak grove).\n\nANNALES RAGUSINI ANONYMI\n\nThree hundred years later, the first Dubrovnik chronicle, Annales Ragusini\n\nAnonymi, restates Dukljanin's account of the origin of Dubrovnik. The same is true of\n\nthe first serious history of Dubrovnik,Com m entaries by L. Crijevic (1459-1521). In-\n\ndeed, Crijevic acknowledges Dukljanin as his primary source( seq uent inprim is Dioc leatem\n\nauctorem). In fact, Crijevic's words on the founding of Dubrovnik are a restatement of\n\nDukljanin's account: The city's founding by Pavlimir, called Belo, a nephew of King Ratislav, who Crijevic tells us, establishes the city's civil and ecclesiastic foundations, organizes a senate to govern, with equal representation for its Slav founders and Roman refugees from Epidaurus, and, with Rome's approval, creates the See of Dubrovnik and appoints its first archbishop.\n\nRAGUSA\n\nRoman refugees from Epidaurus were given a rocky, seaward ridge to settle, actually an island divided from the mainland by a marshy channel. This part was called Lausion, fromlau, the Greek word for precipice, then Rausion, Rausa, Ragusium and, finally, Ragusa. In the second half of the 12th century the channel was filled in to form the physically unified city of Ragusa-Dubrovnik. In this context, the termR om an refers to the Latin- and Greek-speaking population originating in the Byzantine admin- istration of the coastal cities and towns of Dalmatia. In its first centuries the city's territory was limited to a narrow belt along its mainland walls, a thin coastal strip in Gruz, and several offshore islands. From this microscopic space, the city expands by way of grants from and sales by neighboring Serb rulers (e.g. Rijeka, Zaton, Poljica, Zrnovica, Sumeta, Rijeka Dubrovacka, the islands of Mjljet, Lastovo, Sipan, the Peljesac peninsula (including Ston), Slansko Primorje, Konavli).Radoslavus ofDuklja is one of the earliest donors to the Benedictine monastery on the offshore island of Lokum.\n\nBranislav, a contender for the crown of Duklja, and his brothersG rad i slavand\n\nPredislav are buried there. In the 11th century, Branislav'snem esis, King Bodin of Duklja, builds a fortress at Prijeki, the city's oldest district, where, later, his vassal, Stephanus dux Bossiane, builds the Church of St. Nicholas.\n\n3. ILLYRIA SACRUM\n\nIllyria Sacrum is a massive eight-volume history of the Church in Illyria pre-\n\npared in the 18th and 19th centuries by three Italian Jesuits, Filipo Riceputi, Daniele Farlati and Jacobo Coleti. Following service as Venetian army chaplain in Dalmatia, Riceputi saw the need for a history of the Church in the lands of ancient Illyria. Re- turning to Rome in 1720, he submitted an outline draft to the Church rospec tus\n\nIllyrici sacri suisu historiam describendian typisque mandamum suscipit P. Fi. Receputi.\n\nWith the encouragement and support of Pope Clement XI and his successors, Riceputi's project was soon a work in progress. Illyria Sacrum is based on some 300 volumes of raw source materials collected over a twenty-year period. The first seven volumes were published under the name of one of the Jesuit scholars, Farlati, who edited the first five volumes. The first volume was published in 1751 and the eighth in 1819. The first two volumes cover the early history of the Church in Dalmatia. Volumes three and four are a history of the bishopric of Split and its suffragan; volume five, the bishopric of Zadar and its suffragan; volume six, the bishopric of Dubrovnik and its suffragans; volume seven, the bishoprics ofDuklja, Bar and Drac; volume eight, a history of the Church in Serbia and Bulgaria.\n\nTWO SERBIAS\n\nHistorically speaking,Farlati writes, there are two Serbias.\n\nPRIMORJE\n\nOne Serbia is Primorje or Maritime Serbia.\n\nSERBLIAE MARITMAE\n\nMaritime Serbia is also called Upper Dalmatia: Superioris Dalmatiae, idest\n\nSerbliae maritmae.\n\nSERBLIA MEDITERANEA\n\nOn occasion Farlati uses the term Mediterranean Serbia(Serblia mediteranea)\n\nfor Maritime Serbia (Serblia mediteranea; turn mediterraneos... turn maritimo, qui\n\nDalmatiam superioris incolebant).\n\nNERETVA, ZAHUMLJA, TRAVUNIA, DUKLJA\n\nBeginning at the Cetina River(Serblia pars Dalmatiae cisalpinae orientalis\n\nadZentinafere initum duciti),Maritime Serbia is made up of Neretvania, Zahumlja,\n\nTravunia-Konavlja, and Duklja.\n\nPRIMORDIJA\n\nIn royal titles, Farlati notes,Maritime Serbia is sometimes calledPri m o rdi ja,\n\nthe national and political heartland of the Serbs.\n\nIn the 15th century one finds Primordija in the title of King Stefan Tomash\n\n(1443-61): Nos Stephanus Thomas Dei gratia Rasciae, Serviae, Bosnensium sive\n\nIllyriocorum, Primordiae, Dalmatiae. Also in the title of his son and successor, King\n\nStefan Tomashevich (1461-63):In nominae et individua Trinitatis Stepphanus\n\nThomassevich Dei Gratia Russia, Srviae, Bosnensium, sue Illyriocorum, Primordiae,\n\nseu Maritmae, partiumque Dalmatiae.\n\nHI OMNES SERBLI ERANT\n\nNeretvans, Zahumljans, Travunians-Konavlians, Dukljans, all are Serbs:Hi o m n es\n\nSerbli erant.\n\nNERETVANS: GENS SERBICA\n\nThe fierce Serbs of Neretva(gens Serbicaferox immitis), Farlati writes, were at\n\nthe head of the Serb march to statehood(Haec erat una e quatorzupaniis, e quibus\n\nregnum Serbliae maritimae constabat).\n\nPATERNUM SERBLIAE REGNUM\n\nFrom Neretva power passes to Zahumlja(g en s Serblo rum ) to Travunia-Trebinje\n\n(suamque et regni Serbliani sedem in eadem urbe constituit), where Pavlmir begins\n\nhis recovery of the kingdom (ut avitum regnum recuperaret) to Duklja, the historic center of the Serb kingdom(paternum Serbliae regnum), where a Serb Church is established with jurisdiction over Bar, Budva, Kotor, Ulcinj, Svac, Skadar, Drivast, Pulat, Serbia, Bosnia, Travunia and Zahumlja/Neretvania.\n\nKRAJINA\n\nFollowing Zahumlja's annexation of Neretva, the coastal land between the Centina\n\nand Neretva rivers is called Krajina,quae olim ad regnum Serbliae pertinebat.\n\nDUKEDOMOFST.SAVA, HERCEGOVINA\n\nLater, Farlati writes,that part of Maritime Serbia, which from the Cetina\n\nruns eastward, including Uppper Dalmatia, is called the Dukedom of St. Sava or\n\nHercegovina.\n\nZAGORJE\n\nThe other Serbia is Zagorje or Interior Serbia.Zagorje is made up of two parts,\n\nBosnia and Rascia/Raska(partes Serbliae).\n\nBOSNIABosnia(pars Serbliae), Farlati writes, like Raska, is a Serb land, an original\n\nand integral part of Zagorja or Interior Serbia.\n\nSERBIA, RASCIA\n\nSome, Farlati writes,consider the names Serbia and Rascia (Raska) to be one\n\nand the same. This is not true. Rascia cannot be equated with Serbia, nor Serbia\n\nwith Rascia. Rascia is only one part of Serbia(pars Serbliae). This confusion, Farlati\n\nexplains, is probably due to the fact that the Rascian liturgy is used in both Serbia and\n\nRascia.\n\n4. SERBIA-BOSNIA\n\nThroughout history there has never been any doubt or question about Bosnia's\n\nnational-political status. The historical record is clear and consistent from beginning to\n\nend:Bosnia is an original and integral part of Serbia.\n\nJOHN KINNAMOS\n\nA mid- 12th century Byzantine historian, John Kinnamos, served as secretary to the long reigning Emperor Manuel I Comnenus (1143-1180). A brilliant and gifted writer, with a special interest in military matters, Kinnamos is most admired for his objectivity, scrupulousness and straightforward account of political-military affairs. In his account of Emperor Manuel's campaign against Rascia in 1150, Kinnamos writes:\n\nThe Drina river separates Bosnia from the rest of Serbia. Bosnia is not subordinate\n\nto the archzupan of the Serbs and the people there have their own ways and admin-\n\nistration( Chnnikai).Somef o u r or five years later, in his accountof a Byzantine-Hungar-\n\nian battle near Branicevo, Kinnamos writes:On learning that Boric, exarch of the\n\nSerb land of Bosnia, was an ally of the Hungarians ... the Emperor gathered his\n\nbravest troops and sent them against Boric.\n\nBATTAGLIA BOSNESI E GRAN TURCO\n\nThat Bosnia and Serbia were one and the same, that Bosnians were Serbs and\n\nSerbs were Bosnians, is perhaps confirmed in the most absolute and delightful terms by a Dubrovnik source, an important source of record for Serb affairs, for the battle of\n\nKosovo:1389. Adi 15giurgno, ingiorno di Santo Vito, efo martedi,fu battaglia tra\n\nBosnesi e Gran Turco, li quali Bosnesi furono Despot L azar Re di Bosna, et Vuch Brankovich, et Vlatcho Vuchovich Voivoda; etßigran ocisione tanto de Turchi, quanta de Bosnesi, etpochi tornono in suopaese.

Et\n\nfur le lebat t ag lt O inK OSOVOpo lje( A nnalesragusiniA nony m i).\n\nGIOVANI LUCIO (IVAN LUCIC)\n\nGiovani Lucio/Ivan Lucic (1604-79), a native of Trogir, born to an old and noble Italo-Dalmatian family, after extensive studies at home and abroad (e.g. humani- ties at Rome, law at Padua), returned to Trogir in 1625 where he dedicated himself to document and record for posterity the history of Trogir, Dalmatia, and Croatia. Lucio's magnum opus, De Regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae Libri Rex (1655), the first modern history of Dalmatia and Croatia, was based on an exhaustive, thorough, and critical examination of Dalmatian, Croatian, Italian, and Vatican sources, of public, private, civil and ecclesiastic archives and papers no longer available. Since he found no basis for equivocation in fact, commentary or opinion in his research, Lucio has no difficulty of any sort in placing Bosnia in its proper national-political context. In Chapter III,\n\nDei Rei de Bosnia e di do ch'essi tentarono in Dalmazia e in Croazia, Lucio's first words\n\nare:Serbia is divided into two parts by the Drina River. Bosnia is that part that\n\noccupies one side of the Drina River:Serbia divisa in dueporzione dalfiume Drino.\n\nBosnia e laporzione al di qua del Drino o delta Drina.\n\nTHAT PART OF SERBIA\n\nOne finds precisely the same information in Hungarian sources. J. Thuroczy, a 15th century Hungarian chronicler, clearly identifies Bosnia as part of Serbia and sheds light on the origin of Hungary's claims to Bosnia:In 1133» Bela the Blind married\n\nJelena, the daughter of Uros I. From his father-in-law, Uros, Bela received as dowry\n\nthat part of Serbia which the Greeks (Byzantines) call Bosnia and the Ugri (Hun-\n\ngarians) call Rama. Thereafter the kings of Hungary have always laid claim to Bosnia\n\nand for this reason have fought many wars with the Serbs.In fact of course,R am a is\n\nnot Bosnia, but only az upa in Bosnia that takes its name from the Rama River, a right- bank Neretva River tributary, centered at grad Prozor. After 1137,King of Rama is often found in the titles of Hungarian kings and seldom in the titles of Bosnian rulers.\n\nPALATIN OF HUNGARY, BAN OF CROATIA\n\nOwing to Bela the Blind's disability, royal power was actually in the hands of Queen Jelena, sister of Uros I's son and successor, Uros II, and, what is more important, her brother, Belosh, the very able and energetic Palatin of Hungary and Ban of Croatia. Belosh's influence in Hungary's affairs continued under Bela's minor son and Uros Us nephew, Geza II (1141-1162).\n\nTERRITORIAL DOWRIES\n\nThe Hungarians, too, it should be noted, were also generous in the matter of territorial dowries. In one instance, for example, the marriage of Katarina, daughter of King Stefan V of Hungary, to Stefan Dragutin, son of King Stefan Uros I of Serbia (1243-75), the new bride's teritorial dowry included Macva, Srem and a good part of\n\nSlavonia. Soon after this union, Stefan Dragutin was crownedvelikog i strasnog King of\n\nSerbia (1276-82). In another instance, two years after his resignation in favor of his\n\nbrother Milutin, Stefan Dragutin's father-in-law granted him an appanage that included\n\nnorthern Bosnia and the border districts of Usora and Soli.\n\nSLAVI SERVI, BOSNI\n\nInJ.T. Szaszky'sCospectus introductionis, in notitam RegniHungariae, geographicam,\n\nHistoricam, politicam et chronographicam (1759),Serbia is Bosnia and Rascia, Serbs are\n\nBosnians and Rascians:SlaviServi, Bosnii, et Slavi Servi, Rasciani.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nIn another work, De Ceremonis, Constantine refers to Pagania as 'Moravia.' In other sources of that period Pagania is sometimes referred to as Maronia or Moravia, the natives, Mariyani or Moryani, the commander of the Maronia fleet asiudex Marianorum.\n\nIn his study of the Slavs (De Originibus Slavicis, 1745), Joan Christofori de Jordan, one of the founders of\n\nSlavistics in Germania, believes that early German sources, namely Einhard ((e.g.Sorabos, quae natio magnam\n\nDalmatiaepartem obtinere dicitur), offer important information as to Serbia-Bosnia's western borders. Accord-\n\ning to Christofori, all the historical evidence strongly suggests that Serbi-Bosnia's western border ran along the Una\n\nand Sava rivers, centered at Srb, an ancient stronhold on the Una River. For the latest authoritative word on\n\nSerbia-Bosnia's 'original' borders and the location of the 'inhabited cities' cited by Constantine: S.M. Cirkovic,\n\n\"Naseljeni gradovi\" Konstantina Porfirogenita i najstarija teritorijalna organizacija, Zbornik Radova Bizantoloski\n\nInstitut 37, 1998\n\n4. KAMEN DIE WESTSLAVISCHEN\n\nDALEMINCI AUS DALMATIEN?\n\nT\n\nhe following review of Kunstmann's articles is intended only to iden-\n\ntify the subject and suggest the general nature and thrust of his explor-\n\native inquiries. It goes without saying that in many instances, a serious discus-\n\nsion of the issues and questions raised (e.g. Kunstmann's reference to and undertanding\n\nofPri m o rd i a) requires and deserves nothing less than a monograph of considerable\n\nweight and length.'\n\nDALEMINCI\n\nIn Kamen die westslavischen Daleminci aus Dalmatien? , Kunstmann traces\n\nGermania's Serbs called Dalminci/Glomaci (Sclavi, qui vocantur Dalmatii) to Illyria's\n\nSerbs, to Duklya/Dalmatia, to Dlamoc and Glamoc (1983).\n\nDass ebenfalls altsorbisches Glomac aus dem LandschaftsnamenDalm at i a enstanden sein kann, hat eigentlich schon £. Schwarz überzeugend gezeigt. Mit vollem Recht hat Schwarz aber auch altsorbisches Glomac, das noch heute in dem Namen der StadtL o m m atz sch enthalten ist, mit dem dalmatinischen ON Glamoc in Verbindung gebracht, was besagt, dass beide Toponyme Vertretungen für Dalmatia sind, ohne dass dabei einem unbekanten alteuropaischen Volk die Rolle des tertium comparationis zugewiesen werden muss.\n\nDie im Titel dieses Beitrages aufgeworfene Frage ist damit wohl überzeugend beantwortet. Der Stammesname der Daleminci ist nun, nachdem die griechische Herkunft des Abodriten-Ethnonyms erkannt wurde, der zweite Hinweis darauf, dass die slavische Besiedlung Nord-west- und Mitteldeutschlands—jedenfalls zum Teil—vom Balkan her, aus dem Süden, nicht aus dem Osten erfolgte.\n\nZIRZIPANI\n\nIn Mecklenburgs Zirzipanen und der Name der Peene Germania's Serbs/Sers on\n\nthe Peene River or Scircipene are traced to Balkan Serb lands (1984).\n\nDie StadtSi ri s oderS i rra, auch Seres, Serra oderS errhai heisst heute Serra und liegt an der Sudwestecke der Piringebirges, etwa zehn Kilometer nordöstlich der unteren Struma ... Viel spater lieteten die Serben ihren Stammesnamen volksetymologisch vom ONSi ri s bzw.S eres ab: zu 1503 heisst es otL Sera ze srbblje. Im Slavischen wurde der name der Stadt zuS erez b undS eresb, in gekurtzer Form auch zuS erb oderS erb. Dabei setzt das Slavische nicht die antike Form Sir-, sondern die jüngere, auf vulgarlateinischem Lautwandel voni > e beruhende Version Ser- fort ... Man hat den Namen der mecklenburgischenZi rz i pan en wohl alsSi ri -Pai o n es aufzulösen und darunter soviel wie Paonen aus Siris zu verstehen. Es wird somit nicht eigentlich das alte KompositumSi rt o -pai o n es verwenden!, sondern der ON\n\nSiris dem Ethnonym Paion(es) vorangestellt ... Die dem mecklenburgischen\n\nStammesnamenZi rz i pan en zugrundeliegende Bedeutung Siris-Paiones = Paonen\n\naus Siris ist insofern erstaunlich präzise und unmissverstandlich, sie lasst keine\n\ngeographische Verwechslung aufkommen."
