In the case of the\n\nMrkojevic,f o r example, t h e V e n e t i a n s soon learn t h a t every a d u l t male appears to have a\n\ntitle and function meriting recognition and payment. Ultimately, nearly one-third of the\n\nMrkojevicdem and and receive certain privileges a n d ex em p tio n s f r o m V enetian a u t h o r i -\n\nties.\n\nISLAM\n\nWhen Christianity vanished, after theMrko jev i c adopted Islam, Sv. Ilia remained\n\nthepleme'sv ita l center, t h e i n d o m i t a b l e g u a r d i a n of a n c i e n t t r a d i t i o n s a n d values.4 Like-\n\nwise, Ilindan assemblies remained real and symbolic guarantors of communal unity and solidarity. In a true and authentic expression of ancient values and loyalties, soon after the Cathedral's severe damage by an earthquake in 1979, the MoslemMrko jev i c at home and abroad began raising funds for its restoration.\n\nNEWORDER\n\nTheMrko jev i c are proud of the fact that during World War II, though the New Order's occupying forces, following standard imperial policies, did everything in their power and more to incite a confessional war in the region, to place Orthodox, Moslem, and Catholic Serbs at each other's throats, there was not a single instance of religous conflict. Ramo Dapcevic captures thisMrko jev i c moment in the following words:Ovdje\n\nse nije desilo da je brat brata ubio, musliman pravoslavnoga, ill pravloslavni\n\nmusliman, izmedju vjera da je nesto bilo. Nikako. Nego, kao jedna dusa. Ne mozes\n\nrazlikovati nista.

Ovi\n\nnarod,ko go je ima,da' je.Neko je proda.Aliodavdeni konijei zasagladan( S usreti,\n\nJanuary-Feburary, 1990).\n\nILINOBRDO, ILINDAN\n\nSeveral miles north of Bar, in the rugged heights along the coast, one finds Mount Ilia or Ilino Brdo. On its summit, there is a small chapel dedicated to Sv. Ilia. It is here, on this vigilant height, from times immemorial, on Ilindan, Serbs from the core lands of medieval Duklja, from Crmnica, Papratna, and Krajina, Serbs of all confessions and faiths, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Moslem, gathered to honor and celebrateSv .\n\nIlia the Thunderer.'\n\n6. DAZHBOG, KHORS,\n\nSTRIBOG, SIMAR'GL AND MOKOS\n\nA\n\nccording to Procopius, the pagan Slavs worshiped many spirits and made offerings to all, and they made vows and predictions at their sacrifices. A number of recorded primary spirits appear to have Indo-Iranian roots.\n\nNamely, Dazhbog, Khors, Stribog, Sintarg'l and Mokos.\n\nPRIMARY CHRONICLE\n\nIn addition toPerun , the highest god, andVo lo s, god of animals, theR us P rim ary\n\nChronicle( h e r e a ft e r Primary Chronicle)f o r 980 re fe rs to t h e godsDaz hbo g , K ho rs, S t ri bo g ,\n\nSimar'gl, zndMokosh.The g r e a t 1 2th c e n t u r y R u s s ia n e p i c ,S lo vo O P o lku Ig o revy e, Ig o ry a ,\n\nSinaS vy atoslavy a,V nukaO legova( T heT ale of the H ost ofIgor,Igor, the Sonof S vy atoslav, Grandsonof O leg)\n\nin addition toVo lo slVeles (veshei Bojane, Velesove vnuche), also mentions Dazhbog\n\n(pogibaset zhizn Dazhd-Bozha vnuka), Stribog (Se vjetri, Stribozi vnuci, vyut sa\n\nmoryastrelaminahrabriyapulklgorevi), Great [K]Hhors (velikornu Hrsovi vlkom\n\nput prerikase)and Troyan (risca ve troup Troyaniu cres polya na gori; na zemlyiu\n\nTroyaniu).1 A 12th century apocrypha detailing the activities and miracles of the blessed\n\nvirginalsom e n t i o n sPerun ,Vel es, K ho rs,and T ro y an( H oz hednie B ogoroditsiP o M ukam ).\n\nDAZHBOG\n\nAn early Slavic translation of the first universal Byzantine chronicle, an eighteen-\n\nbook world history( Chnnographia)b yJ o h n Malalas(4 9 0-5 78 ), identifiesD az hbo gusth e\n\nson ofSv aro g : Below Svarog, his son, the Sun, called Dazhbog ruled.\n\nDATBHAGA\n\nIn all ways, in name and role, the SlavicDaz hbo g , the giving god (the Sanskrit equivalent is Datbhaga) is consistent with the Indo-Iranian tradition, withS va ra s Dhata or Dhatabhaga, the creator of all things, with Svarog us Dazhbog, the solar source and\n\ndistributoro f wealth, health, a n d good fortune( V .J agic ,Z um Daz db og,A rC8 ,18 9 5 ; E .D ic kenm ann,\n\nSerbokroatische Dabog, ZsP 20, 1950).\n\nSUNWORSHIPERS\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that numerous authoritative sources identify the an- cient Slavs as Sun worshipers. The great 10th century Muslim historian, geographer, and cartographer, al-Mas'udi (896-956), theH erodotus o f the A rab s, for example, records that the Slavs had temples with special architectural arrangements, with an opening in the\n\ndomeforo b s e r v i n g t he sunrise( M urujadh- dhab abwa m a' adinal- jawahir).1 Certain that t hec o u rse\n\nof the Sun determined human affairs, the high priests prophesied future events by coor- dinating its course with precious stones and magic signs carved in stone inside the temple. It is a matter of record that solar reverence did not end with death. Wanting the dead to\n\nface thes u n r i s e , the pagan Slavs buried their dead with theh e a d in thew e s t,fe e t in the\n\neast.\n\nSORABOS, CULTUM SOUS\n\nA number of German historians are certain that the place name Juterbog is de-\n\nrivedf r o mt h e Serb wordsj u t r o o rm o r n i n g a n db ogotg o d ,f r o m p a g a nr i t u a l s c e l e b r a t -\n\ning the morning sun:Sorabos advenas ei tam cultum Soi ls . . . quern sua li ngua Jutre\n\nvocant, addito nomine Bog seu Boch, quod apud omnes Slavos Deum significant.\n\nSOLOTABAB\n\nIn some instances onomastic links with a pagan past have been obscured by\n\ntime and change. Who would suspect, for example, that the nameA usc hw itz is derived\n\nfromWosz wiec z ic h, a name denoting a place of solar celebrations:derivator Auscheweitus\n\na Sorabica voca Woszwieczicz = illuminate, de quyo sibie persuadebant vitam ab\n\neo servari.Some speculate that Bamberg( B am b erga—primum vocatafiiitBambergh.e.\n\nmons Babae), mons Babae, as well as many other Germania place names with the prefix\n\nbab- (e.g. Babin/1585, near Finsterwalde; Babizna/1378, near Dresden; Babic/1392, near Grimma; Babo/1458, near Cottbus;m ons B ab el12 2 3 , later Papenberge, near Spandau), were sites of pagan rituals relating toS olotaB ab .\n\nJUTROBOGIAPPELLATUR\n\nIn an early and outstanding study of the Serbs, A. Frencel writes: Slavi Sorabique\n\nfulgidam auroram sic interpretati sunt, quai esset numen praestantissimum, quod mortalibus in dies bene vellet, cupererque, quodque tenebras discuteret et diem largiertur, aptum tempus operibus agendis conficiendisque. Visa itaque Dea, a qua temperies et su dum coelum discussis fulminibus, tonitruis, fulguribus, ventorumque turbidinibus: ilium idolum, quod Soraborum persuasione primam diei facem accendret Jutrebobusseu Jutrobogi appellatur(A .F renc el,Com m entarius\n\nPhilologico-Historicus de Diis Soraborum Aliorumque Slavorum, 1719).\n\nSOLAR IMPULSE\n\nThat the solar impulse continued well into the Christian era is confirmed by\n\nmany sources. The Grand Duke of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh (1052-1125), in his\n\ntestament, instructs his sons to praise the Lord first, and then the rising sun in the morn-\n\ning. Another sign of past times is found inThe Book of Deep Wisdom orGlub innaia\n\nKniga,a work popular in the late medieval period. In it Prince Vladimir has two basic\n\nquestions to King David:How did the White Light originate? How did the Sun\n\noriginate?King David answers: The White Light springs from God's heart; the\n\nSun, from God's face.\n\nSUNS ARE THE CREATORS\n\nParenthetically, L.M. Graham writes: Suns are the creators of the worlds, not gods. This the Ancients knew and it became the basis of their sun worship. Today we think of this as pagan ignorance of \"the one true God,\" but alas, the ignorance is ours, not theirs. The story is told of a Christian bishop who said to a Parsee: \"So you are one of those peculiar fellows who worship the sun.\" \"Yes,\" said the Parsee, \"and so would you if you had ever seen it.\" No, the bishop had never seen it mentally and so he worshiped a mythical Creator instead of the real one. And I'm sure he thought his form of worship vastly superior to the peculiar fellow's( Dec eptionsa n d M y ths of the Bible, 1975).\n\nAND THE BRIGHT SUN\n\nWhen the daughter of a Balkan Serb was getting married, writes F. Kmietowicz,\n\nit was customary for her father to instruct her in the same way as the Grand Duke of Kiev\n\ndid his son:To Pray to the righteous God and the bright sun in the east every\n\nmorning(F .K m ietowic z , S lavic M y thic al B eließ ,19 8 2 ).The same author writes that it waslo n g the\n\ncustom in Slavic lands:That when travellers and people in the field saw the rising\n\nsun, they stopped traveling or working, and standing upright they tooko ff their\n\nhats, bowing to the sun, they made crosses.Solar reverence was especially strong and\n\nenduring among the Christian Serbs of Germania, where it was the custom, upon\n\nentering a church, to turn around and greet the rising sun; it was forbidden to\n\npoint out the sun with the finger because, it was said, it could prick God's eye.\n\nHORS\n\nThe pagan Slav Sun godH o rs is a cognate of Vedics v a r , Old Persian,h va r as in\n\nhvar khsaeta( g l o r i o u s s u n god w i t h c h a r i o t a n d s w i ft s te e d s ), l a t e r Persian horsid( u n d y -\n\ning, shining sun). It it interesting and perhaps coincidental that in ancient Egyptian reli- gion, the sky godH or or H ar, in the form of a falcon, whose outstretched wings filled the heavens, whose eyes were the sun and the moon, was the god of gods. The First Dynasty, the unifiers of Egypt, wereH or worshipers. From that time, with occasional interrup- tions, every pharaoh was believed to be a human manifestation of Hor, and every pharaoh's first name wasH or. Coincidentally,o ra o is the Serbo-Croat word for eagle. Some schol- ars believe that the Croat ethnikon,Horvator Hrvat, like that of the kindred Serbs, is\n\nalso derived froms v a r fromh v a r fromh o r.\n\nHORS, HRSOJEVIC\n\nOne finds the given name ofH ors orH rs recorded in registers of late medieval Balkan Serb communities (e.g. the Hrs-Hrsojevic lineage of Zalaza-Njeguse, Katun county, in mid-16th century Old Montenegro).\n\nSIMURGH.ZAL\n\nThe Primary Chronicle'sSt m arg 'li s Si m urg h, the radiant bird-god of good omen, a creature of the Indo-Iranic pantheon where he is found with the very same name. While theS hah- Nam eh depictsSi m urg h as a noble vulture, the 'radiant bird' is generally de- picted as a composite creature made up of elements borrowed from the peacock, the lion, the griffin, and the dog. Under the influence of Indo-Iranian dynasts, the Hurrians gave the nameS im igi to a sun god who appears in various mythological compositions( V .\n\nPisani, Smarigla, Chorsa-Dazboga, For Roman Jakobson, 1956. B^A. Rybakov, Rusali andthe godSimargl-Pereplut, AnT\n\n6, 1968).\n\nSHAH-NAMEH\n\nZal is the sad, touching subject of a Persian epic poem Shah-Nameh (Book of the\n\nKings). Zal was born with pure white hair, and his frightened father, the noble Sam,\n\ngovernor of Hindustan, left the infant to his fate on a distant mountain. Hearing the infant's cries, the noble vultureSi m urg h takes Zal to his nest and raises him. Remorseful and heartbroken, Sam searches for Zal, finds him in early manhood, confesses his crime, and is forgiven by Zal, who begets the glorious and invincible Rustem.\n\nZAL, ZALITI, ZALOST\n\nIn Serb,z alas in zaliti, zalost, andz a ljen je is the root of words connoting regret,\n\nsorrow, grief, and mourning. In Germania east and west of the Elbe one finds many place names derived from the prefix zal (e.g. Zal, Zalany, Zale, Zalica, Zalici, Zalikov, Zalim, Zalkov, Zaloslavici, Zalogosc, Zalosici, Zalosov, Zalotin, Zalov). Also Zalbogy Grad, a name that radiates the most robust pagan images.\n\nSTRIYA, STRIBOG\n\nThe SlavicStri bo g , a god of wind, storm, and gales, appears to be related to Iranic\n\nTi-Striya,also Stribaga( S.P ierc hegger, Z umaltrussic hen Gotternam en S trib og,Z sP 2 4,19 47 ; M . Vei, Ketimologii\n\ndrevnerusskogo Stribog, VoP 7, 1985; L. Crepajac, Zum Slav. Stribog, DwS 12, 1967; R. Schmidt, Zur angeblich\n\niranischen Herkunft des altrussischen Gotternamens Stribog, DwS 16, 1971).\n\nSTRIBAGA\n\nStribaga is an aide to the great warrior/wind god, Vat, from which the Serb word\n\nfor wind,vet orvetar is derived.V at was the first god to receive sacrifices, and Ahura Mazda himself leads the list of offerants. In his struggle against demonic forces,T i- S triy a often appears in the form of a white horse. In the Christian eraSt ri bo g became the basis forS triga, a demonic force. In Serb, stri- as instrije la andstrije lja ti is the root of words connoting arrow, shaft, thunderclap, thunderbolt, shoot, and fire. In Germania one finds several place names apparently derived from the root stri (e.g. Stryje and Stryje Grad on the island of Rügen; the Strigus river as in super fluxio Strigucz sita). Also, perhaps such place names as Langer-Striegis, formerly Striguz, near Freiberg; Nieder- Striegis, formerly Striguz, near Dobeln; Striegnitz, formerly Striganuitz, near Lommatzsch.\n\nMALKOS, MOKOS\n\nMokos isM alkos, an Iranian deity associated with torrential rains and floods. The\n\npagan SlavM okosh, a cognate of Serbm okro (the root word for wet, damp, moisture),\n\ndispensesthe water that giveslife,the moist earth that sustainsl i fe.( T . Witkowski, Perunund\n\nMokos in altpolabischen Ortsnamen, OnO 16,1971;M. Filipovic, Zur GottheitMokos bei den Sudslaven, DwS6,1961)?\n\nSome evidence ofMo ko s' exalted status in the Russian pantheon of pagan gods is found in the anonymous Life of Vladimir. According to this source,Mo ko s alone survived Vladimir's first assault on the pagan gods of Kiev: Vladimir ... having come to Kiev,\n\ndestroyed all of his gods, Perun, Xors; again his god was Mokos, and then he\n\ndestroyed all the gods and drowned them in the Dnieiper.\n\nMOKOSIC, MOKOSICA\n\nIn Germania,Mo ko s is believed to be the root of a number of place names, in-\n\ncluding Mokos, Mokosic, now Mobschatz, near Dresden; Mokosin, now Moxa, near\n\nSaalfeld. Also such modern place names as Megsch, Moggast, Motzo and Mockau( E .\n\nEichler, Probleme namenkundlicher Etymologie in slawischen Ortsnamen zum Gotternamen Mokos im Altsorbischen, OsG\n\n17, 1988).\n\nIn early medieval times Franconia was an important center of aMo ko s cult( H .\n\nJakob,M oggast vulgo Mokos—Kultortd e rslavisc hen Göttin Mokosauf dem Frankischen Jura,A gO6 1,19 8 1).Regard-\n\ning theMo ko s cult in this area, E. Eichler writes:Sichere Belegungen fur die Verehrung\n\nheidnischer Gotter bein den Main- und Rednitzwenden besitzen wir nicht; der\n\nGottername Mokos kann mit einiger Sicherheit aus due Toponymie erchlossen\n\nwerden(E.E ic hler, ZumG otternam enM okos imA ltsorb isc hen, SIG 12,19 8 6 )\n\n7.VED\n\nV\n\ned, the Sanskrit word for knowledge/wisdom, is perfectly preserved in Old and Modern Slavic words relating to consciousness, know- ledge, understanding, science. Ved, for example, is the root of the following\n\nCzech words:ved a (science);ved ec (scientist, scholar);ved ed (know);vedom ost (con-\n\nsciousness);vedom ost (knowledge).\n\nVESCHT\n\nVed is also the root of Slavic words connoting sage, seer, wizard, sorcerer, oracle\n\n(e.g. Russian,v e sc h t, Polishv ie z d a , Serb, vedar, vest, vestac), whileV edm a is a Slavic word\n\nfor witch. It is thus fitting that The Tale of the Host of Igor's prophetic minstrel is called\n\nveschi (Tomu veschi Bojanei prvoye pripevku).\n\nDEVAS, DIV\n\nTheT ale' s omen-screeching bird calleddiv(Divkli cet vrhu dreva,veli tposlusati\n\nzetnlineznaem)alsohas Indo-Iranian roots (I.J. Hanus, Deva, zlatovlasab ohy nepogansky c h Slovanuv,\n\n1860).Ino p p o s i t i o n to theV edicdevas, who were divine spirits of thegood, theI r a n i a n\n\ndiv stands in opposition to the gods, an evil and demonic force. In Serb, div(e . g . divlji,\n\ndivljina,a n d divovski)has sim ila r c o n n o t a t i o n s , nam ely a w ild, savage, a n d colossal f o r c e\n\nor condition. In the pagan Slavic tradition thed iv takes several forms. One isd iv: in ominous moments, as in theT ale, thed iv often appears as an omen-screeching bird or bird-like creature. Another isdivoz ena: a forest-dwelling demonic, superhuman wild woman. In Germania some Slavic place names with the prefix div- and dev- probably have cultic origins (e.g. Devcin, later Dautzschen, near Prettin; Devin, later Dewin, near Halle; Devica, later Dewitz, near Taucha; Divici, later Diwiche on the Saale).\n\nSIVA\n\nIn the Hindu tradition,S iva is the dark god of cosmic destruction and recreation. There is a single and certain reference to aSi v a cult in Germania. Helmold recordsSi v a as the god of the Elbe Slavs or Polabians:Si wa d ea Po labo rum . That the PolabianSi v a is derived from the HinduS iva is suggested by siva's dark connotations in Slavic lan- guages. In Serb, for example,s iv connotes grey, greyish, overcast, to turn grey, ashen( siv,\n\nsivo sivkast, posivjett). The same is true of several other words for dark colors. The San-\n\nskrittam os or dark is the Serb tarn, tamno; the Sanskritk r s n a or black is the Serbc rna.\n\nYAM\n\nMore important circumstantial evidence of the religious connection between the HinduS iva and the PolabianSi v a is found in other linguistic connections relating to destruction and creation. For example, the Sanskrit notion ofYam , the underground world where the luminous soul of the dead continued to exist, andNiv r ti, escape from the rotating wheel of rebirth, are manifestly the sources of theS erb y am a, connoting pit, cavity, underground, andv r tit, connoting rotation, twirl. More than a few place names with the root yam- are recorded in Germania. Among others, he place names are Jama, Jamnica, Jamno (e.g. Jama, modern Jahmo, near Zahna; Jamnica, now Jamlitz, near Lieberose; Jamlica, modern Jamlitz, near Spremberg; Jamno, modern Jahmen, near\n\nWeisswasser).\n\nPAC,PAK\n\nSimilarly, the Sanskrit rootpac , connoting heat, fire, boiling, is the Serb root\n\npakas mpakao (hell, inferno),paklen( h e l l i s h ) ,pakost (malice, wickedness),/w (oven),\n\npeci(b ak e), andpecen (burned). It is more likely than not that such Slavic place names as\n\nPak, Pakov, and Paklov recorded in Germania had religious connotations.\n\nDUH.BHUH\n\nIn Hindu mythologyB huh is one of three original breaths by which Earth was created, andb hutani is the Sanskrit word for spirits. In Serb,dhu is the root of words connoting spirits, soul, blowing, breathing (dhu, dhuhovi, dhuvatf). Saxo's account of pagan Slav ceremonies at Arkona records a ritual reference to the notion of original and sacred breath in the following terms. In a temple dedicated toS var asS vantevit, Saxo\n\nwrites:He [the priest] took care not to breathe out inside the temple and each\n\ntime he had to take a breath or breathe out he ran outside so as not to defile the\n\nidol with mortal breath. Numerous place names in Germania appear to be derived\n\nfrom Slavic words for breath, spirit, soul (e.g. Duchov, Duchorov, Dusici, Dusin, Dusino, Duskov, Dusnica). Also Dusny, near Barby; Dusnica, nearjessen; Dusov, near Wittenberg; Dusov, near Schwerin.\n\nBUD.BHUD\n\nThe same parallels are found in derivative words. For example, the Sanskrit root\n\nbhud'asin bhudyati(aw ake, conscious, a l e r t ) , bhudyate(awakes, recogniz es, u n d e r s t a n d s ) ,\n\nthus Buddha, the Enlightened, is the Serb rootb ud as in budan, budit, buditi, budnost. As in all lands of Slavic settlement, many place names in Germania are derived from the root bud: Bud, Budic, Budici, Budisko Grad, Budisovo Grad, Budlikov, Budoradz, Budzin and numerous Budims. Also Buda, near Grossenhain; Budchov, near Guben; Budigost, near Leipzig; Budisin, near Dresden; Budsin, near Lubben; Budsko, near\n\nBernburg.\n\nJIV,ZIVLinguistic parallels are also found in words relating to mortality and life. Sanskrit\n\nJiv (one who lives in the body; a mortal being) is the pagan SlavZiv, which is the modern\n\nSerbZ iv connoting living, alive, lively; SanskritJ ivati ('to live') is the SerbZ iviti ('to live');S anskrit J ivana( ' l i fe ' ) is the SerbZ ivot( ' l i fe ' )( I.J .H anus, O b ohy niZ ive,Casopis 6,1865).In one of the Iranian-based mystical Gnostic systems, Abathur, otherwise calledB ' hagZ iva,\n\nis anUthra, or a divine being of the rank of angel. Born and living within the\n\nWorld of Light, the Uthras ... are of varying ranks and of varying goodness and\n\nbadness.In this system,B ' hagZ iva is an Uthra of the first and highest rank. By contem-\n\nplation of his own image, B'hag Ziva brought forth the divine being called Ptah-il-\n\nUthra. The image he contemplated was that of himself reflected off black water.\n\nB'hag Ziva ordered his son to create a world in imitation of the heavenly world( R .\n\nCarlyton, A Guide to the Gods, 1982).\n\nMRITA, MRTVO\n\nLikewise, at the other end of the spectrum, the SanskritM rita (dead) andM rity u\n\n(death) is the SerbM rtvo (dead) andS m ert (death)\n\n8. DENEN DER INDEN\n\nF\n\nrom the earliest times, the warrior, orrataestar (Sanskrit, he who stands\n\nin a chariot) played an important role in Indo-Iranian society.The cultic\n\ncelebrations of the warrior class( rat hest a) were the most solemn and impressive and at the same time the most secular and political. There is evidence of similar cultic celebrations in Slavic Germania. To begin with, the Indo-Iranian rootra t is the Slavic word for war (e.g. the Serbra t, war;ra tn ik , warrior;ratob oran, militant;ra to v a ti, to wage war. Also, the militant personal namesR atib or, R atim ir, andR atio: the place names\n\nRatibor, Ratiborici, Ratimirici,a n d Ratenovic,\n\nROYAL CITY OF RATA\n\nIt is perhaps more than coincidence thatrat is the root of one of Germania's\n\nleading Slavic nations-provinces,terra Ratari, and that the royal cityo fH ata (Rethra) was long the political-religious center of Slavic Germania, the site of the Slavic Delphi, the great temple dedicated toSv ar, of cultic celebrations featuring the war banners of Germania's Slavic nations. In the royal cityo fRat a great war councils were held. It was here that monks in disguise, spying on a concilium Paganorum, were caught and ex- ecuted in theyear 105 0( T .Witkowski, DerNam eder R edarier undi h r e sz entralen H eiligtum s, Z tS 13 ,19 6 8 .

Rethra, dier Redarier und Arkona, DwS26, 1981).\n\nASVAMEDHA\n\nThe rathesthaasvam edha, or horse sacrifice, was the king of rites and rite of kings. A symbol of the sun and the universe ('From the substance of the Sun, O Gods, you fashioned this steed'), the immolation and cremation of the sacred horse marked the investiture of a sovereign and endowed him with divine authority and power. Representing the sun, the heart of the universe, the all-seeing and far-seeing eye of the gods, the divine horse had a similar role in pagan Slav rituals and ceremonies.1\n\nWHITE HORSE\n\nThe oracular horses kept in Slavic sanctuaries in Germania and Pomerania served\n\nfor divination by stepping over spears. At Arkona on Rügen, the oracular horse was white\n\n(J.H errm ann, DiePf erde vonA rkona,B eitrage zur Ur- undF rü hgesc hic hte,1982).Wek n o wf r o m Saxo\n\nGrammaticus certain basic facts about the horse and ceremony at Rügen.They f oretold\n\nthe future with the aid of this horse in the following way. When they had decided\n\nto wage war on some land, the priests laid three rows of spears in front of the temple. In each row there were two spears in the shape of a cross, with the spear- heads buried in the ground, and the rows were equidistant from one another. In the course of preparations for the expedition, the priest offered up a solemn prayer,\n\nthen brought the horse from the antichamber of the temple, holding it by the halter, and if entering one of these rows, the horse put the right foot first, instead of his left, that was regarded as a good omen for war; if, on the other hand, al- though it might only happen once, he put his left foot first instead of the right,\n\nthey abandoned their plan to invade the foreign land.\n\nSVANTEVIT\n\nThe divine horse also played an active and heroic role. At times, Saxo writes,\n\nhorse and god were one in defense of the faith: According to the beliefs of the Rani,\n\nSvantevit went to war riding this horse against enemies of his faith, and this was\n\nproved by the fact that although the horse was shut up all night in the stable, in\n\ndie morning it often appeared out of breath and spattered with mud, as if it had\n\na long way to travel on returning from some expedtion.\n\nBLACK HORSE\n\nAt Stetin the oracular horse was black. The following details are from Ebbo's\n\nbiography of Otto, Apostle of Pomerania: Now the people possessed a horse of great\n\nsize which was plump and dark coloured and very spirited. It did no work\n\nthroughout the year and was regarded as being so holy that no one was worthy to\n\nride it. It had also as its attentive guardian one of the four priests who were at-\n\ntached to the temples. Whenever the people contemplated setting out on any\n\nexpedition by land to attack their enemies, or in order to secure booty, they were\n\naccustomed to forecast the result in this way. Nine spears were placed on the\n\nground and separated from one another by the space of a cubit. When the horse\n\nhad been made ready and was bridled, the priest, who was in charge of it, led the\n\nhorse three times backwards and forwards across the spears that were lying on\n\nthe ground. If the horse crossed without knocking its feet or disturbing the spears,\n\nthey regarded this as an omen of success and proceeded on their expedition with-\n\nout anxiety, but if the result were otherwise they remained inactive.\n\nVESCHII KON\n\nThe prophetic role of the horse in divination ceremonies of the Slavs is confirmed by a wide variety of sources, including Slavic mythology. In Russian mythology, for example, the prophetic horse is well-preserved as the veschii kon or prophetic horse( Z .\n\nRajewski, Kon w wierzwniach u Slowian dzcesnosredniowiecznych, WiA 29, 1975).\n\nDER INDEM\n\nAccording to the historical record, the funeral ceremonies of Germania Serb war- riors, orratnic i (the Serb/Slav word for war isr a t, for warrior, sing,ra tn ik , pi.ratnic i), attending the death of a king or prince, resonated with images from the Rig Veda and\n\nAvesta. In Germania Serb ceremonies, lord and horses (sacrificed horses), were cremated\n\nand buried together and, in the words of a Rig Veda prayer, dispatched to the abode supreme, to the place of their Father and Mother, to a warm welcome among the Gods. Observing the funeral customs of the pagan Serbs of Germania, intrepid horsemen, fierce warriors, feared by one and all, al-Mas'udi found them similar to the customs of the Hindus(T.Lewicki, d-Mas'udi, SsS3,1967).J. Marquart's German translation readserbereiets\n\ngennanten Serben verbrennen sich selbst, wenn ihnen der Konig oder Häuptling\n\nstirbt, sowie dessen Pferde. Sie befolgen dabei Gebrauch, ahnlich denen der Inden\n\n(J. Marquart, Osteuropaische und Ostastische Streifzuge. Ethnographische und Historiographische- Topographische Studien\n\nzur Geschichte des 9. und 10. Jh, 1903).\n\nHORSE, HORSEMANSHIP\n\nThere is strong evidence that similar burial ceremonies were common through out Germania and neighboring Sarmatia. A late 9th century Scandinavian source, for ex-\n\nample, depicts the pagan Baltic Slavs as fierce horsemen who favored mare's milk and\n\nprized swift horses, whose burial ceremonies featured both horse and horsemanship:The\n\ndead man's treasures were divided into shares, according to their number and value. The richest portion was laid down on the ground about a mile from the dead man's home, and all the other portions at points between the first one and the home, each one nearer the house. All the men who owned the swiftest horses rode from a five or six miles distant in a race to pick up these treasures, and the prizes fell to those who reached them first. Finally the cremation of the dead man, clothed in his best and girded with weapons, was solemnly fulfilled.\n\nWITH THEIR HORSES\n\nDocumentary evidence that in some remote areasasvam edha- \\f ae ceremonies con-\n\ntinued into the 13th century is found in a 1218 treaty with the Teutonic Knights:W hereby\n\nseveral Slavic tribes agreed to abandon the pagan custom of cremating and bury-\n\ning the dead with their horses.\n\nSVARGORIC\n\nThe role of fire in pagan Slav religious ceremonies also has strong Indo-Iranian\n\novertones.A n ancient workof uncertain originand date( U nknow n A dm irerofChrist) states that\n\nthe pagan Slavs also address prayers to Fire, calling him Svargoric( b u r n i n gS v a r ) ,\n\nAccording to an important source of information on affairs in medieval Russia, the\n\nHypatianC hronic le( Ipat' evskaiaL etopis),thesame w aslo n gt r u e forC h r i s t i a nSlavs. A sla te as\n\nthe 14th century, for example, we are told churchmen censured the common people for\n\npraying to fire, calling itS varoz ic . InH udud al- alam , a work meant to contain all data\n\nknown until then on the countries and kingdoms ofthe world,all that could be learned\n\nfrom books or from the words of learned men, except all the particulars of the\n\nworld may be known to none, save God,a Persian geographer writes that all Slavs\n\nprayed to fire. In Chapter 43, 'Discourse on the Slav Country', one reads: All Slavs are\n\nfireworshi pers (V.M inorsky ,H ududal- alam . TheR egions of theWorld. A Persian Geography 372A .D.T ranslated\n\nand explained by V. Minorsky, 1980).\n\nCREMATION\n\nDiverse sources agree that the Slavs cremated their dead. The Primary Chronicle\n\noffers a brief account of the funeral ceremony circa 850: Whenever a death occurred, a\n\nfeast was held over the corpse, and then a great pyre was constructed, on which the deceased was laid and burned. After the bones were collected, they were placed in a small urn and set upon a post by the roadside, even as the Vyatichians do to this day.H u d u d a l- A la madds several i m p o r t a n t f a c t s to th e m a t t e r : They [Slavs] burn the dead. When a man dies, his wife, if she loves him, kills herself.\n\nSUTTEEA more informative and interesting step-by-step account, with the strongest Indie-\n\nHindu overtones, including suttee, was recorded in 922 by a well informed Arab traveler,\n\nAhmed Ibn Fadlan: When a Slav nobleman died, for ten days his body was laid\n\nprovisionally in a grave, where he was left until his shroud was prepared for him.\n\nHis property was divided into three parts: one third was given to the family,\n\ndie intoxicating drinks that were served at the funeral banquet. On the day ap-\n\npointed for the final obsequies, a boat was taken out of the water, and round it\n\nwere placed pieces of wood shaped to the form of human beings. Then the corpse\n\nwas removed from the provisional grave and, being clad with a costly garment, was seated in a boat on a richly ornamented armchair, around which were ar- ranged weapons of the deceased, together with intoxicating beverages; not only\n\nbread and fruit, but also flesh of killed animals ... were put into the boat. One of\n\nhis wives who had voluntarily agreed to be burned together with her dead hus-\n\nband was led to the boat by an old woman calledthe Angel of Death, and was\n\nstabbed at the side of the corpse; whereupon the wood piled upon it had been\n\nconsumed, the ashes were collected and scattered over the cairn; and a banquet,\n\nlasting four days and nights without interruption, closed the ceremony.\n\nARAB-ISLAMIC WRITERS\n\nOne finds the same notion in the diverse works of other Arab-Islamic writers. A native of Marw, an ancient city that dominated the rich oasis region along the Murghab river on the northeastern fringes of Persia, al-Marwazi, a late 10th early 11th century geog- rapher and man of letters, writes:The Slavs burn their dead for they worship fire\n\n(Taba'ial-hayawan).The Spanish-Arabic historian andgeographer Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi(1213-\n\n74) writes about the immense Slav lands where it is said that they still adhere to the\n\nMadjusreligionandworshi pf ix e( K itab lal- M ughnb f ihula' 1- m aghnb ).Orig in a llyan a n c ie n t\n\nIranian priestly caste, in Islamic sources the termm adjus is primarily for Zoroastrians, and secondarily for all fire worshippers. In his scientific and geographic encyclopaedia, al- Watwat (1234-1318) states that the Slavs believe in the Madjus religion and burn\n\ntheirdead in fire( M ab ahidjal- ß karwa- m anahidjal- ib ar).\n\nROYALTOMBS\n\nIt is a matter of record that the tombs of Slav notables compare well with those of other ancient civilizations. Past and recent excavations of royal tombs confirm the pres- ence of horses. Accordingly, in a mid-10th century tomb uncovered by recent excavations, one finds members of a royal family, horses and weapons, placed in a timber mortuary house, equipped with everything believed to be necessary for the afterlife. With regards to the relative material-aesthetic merit, the foremost authority on ancient and prehistoric Europe, M. Gimbutas, writes:Slavic royal tombs are as eloquent as other Indo-\n\nEuropean royal tombs, be they Hittite, Phrygian, Thracian, Greek, or Germanic\n\n(M. Gimbutas, The Slavs, 1971).\n\nENDNOTES\n\nComparative Indo-European mythological research indicates the unquestionably prime role of the horse\n\n(particularly the white horse) as a sacred and sacrificial animal, the incarnation of divine power of the God of\n\nthe Shining Sky... Excavations of graves dating from 4400 - 4300 also uncover the custom of suttee or sacrifice\n\nof thef emaleconsort orwi f e (M.G im b utas, TheL anguage of theGoddess,19 9 1}9. INDO-IRANIAN LINGUISTIC ROOTS\n\nA\n\nnumber of eminent archaeologists and linguists suspect that the steppe above,\n\nalong, and between the northern shores of the Black and Caspian seas, centered in\n\nthe area between the Volga, Don, and Ural Rivers, is thevagina gentium of the\n\nProto-Indo-Europeans.\n\nPROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN\n\nProto-Indo-European probably evolved out of the languages spoken by\n\nhunter-fishing communities in the Pontic-Caspian region, writes J.P. Mallory, in\n\nterms that represent a general consensus of archaeological and linguistic consensus on the\n\nsubject.It is impossible to select which languages and what areas, though a lin-\n\nguistic continuum from the Dnieper east to the Volga would be possible. Settle- ment would have been confined primarily to the major river valleys and their tributaries, and this may have resulted in considerable linguistic ramification. But the introduction of the stockbreeding, and the domestication of the horse, permitted the exploration of the open steppe ... During this period to 'which we notionally assign Proto-Indo-European (4500-2500), most of the Pontic-Caspian\n\nserved as a vastinteractionSphere( J .P.M allory ,InSearc hof theIndo- E uropeam ,198 9).\n\nEXPANSION\n\nAccording to Mallory, the archaeological evidence suggests a Proto-Indo-Euro-\n\npean expansion eastward across the steppe and forest-steppe of western Siberia beginning\n\nin the late fourth millennium. The archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests that in\n\nthe third millennium B.C. Indo-Iranian languages evolved in an area between the Volga\n\nand Kazakhstan. Mallory writes:Out of this staging area there was a gradual shift\n\nsouthwards ... By the second millennium, Indo-Aryan was spoken by tribes south of the Caspian, and probably also in Afghanistan-north Pakistan from whence it ultimately pressed southwards into the Indus Valley. Concurrent with these de- velopments, Iranian was evolving on the steppe and was then subsequently car- ried south into present-day Iran and Afghanistan, while the steppe itself was largely left to Eastern Iranian-speaking tribes.\n\nGENETIC EVIDENCE\n\nThe above theory appears to be consistent with the small body of genetic evi-\n\ndence on the subject. But, in my view, writes an eminent geneticist, there is strong support given by the archaeological similarities and, presumably, ties between the western and eastern cultures north of the Caucasus which gave rise to the expansions of pastoral nomads, and the well-known ties between Indo-Iranian, and at least some European languages, could be most easily explained if they all descended from a single group of languages spoken around 5500-6000 years ago, in the Volga-Don area, and if such people spread their genes and languages both westwardto central Europeand to the southeast as far as Iranand India(L .L uca\n\nCavalli-Sforza, Genetic Evidence Supporting Marija Gimbutas Work on the Origin of the Indo-European People, From the\n\nJfeaJm of Ancestors: An Anthology in ffonor ofAfarijtt Gimbutas, 1994)\n\nPROTO-SLAVS.PROTO-INDO-IRANIANS/ARYANS\n\nAccording to Mallory, the 5th to the 10th centuries A.D. are regarded as both the\n\nprimary time of Slavic expansion and also the terminal period of Proto- or Common\n\nSlavic—the collapse of Common Slavic and its fission into the different modern Slavic\n\nlanguages. Linguistic evidence, Mallory believes, indicates that before the collapse of\n\nCommon Slavic, the Slavs had been subjected to strong linguistic influences from Ira-\n\nnian-Sarmatian speaking peoples.\n\nTRUBACEV\n\nOne of the foremost modern authorities on the ethnogenesis of the Proto-Slavs,\n\nthe eminent Russian linguist O.N. Trubacev, has different and interesting views on the\n\nend of Common Slavic and the beginning of Slav-Iranian ties. Slavic-Iranian relations, he\n\nwrites,took place on the eastern periphery of Slavdom, where a symbiosis of Slavs\n\nand Iranians began by the first centuries A.D. They also entailed a deep penetra- tion of Iranian tribes into the Slavic areas, which has ... demonstrated the exist- ence of Early Slavic dialects a long time before the period at which the Slavic philology of the 1950s and 1960s believed they existed ... Scythian raids into the area of the Lusatian culture have been known to archaeologists for a long time ... Slavic-Iranian relations probably began mainly about the middle of the first mil- lennium B.C. They have considerably affected Slavic anthroponymy which was in the developing stage at this time, separating itself from the appellative vocabu- lary; in any case, if there were inherited proto-Indo-European bi-component anthroponymic compounds in Slavic, their lexical (and grammatical) develop- mentwa s influencedby Iranianat that time( L inguistic sand E thnogenesisofthe S lavs:T heA nc ient\n\nSlavs as Evidenced by Etymology and Onomastics, InD 13, 1985).\n\nABAEVPerhaps the most recent theory on the subject deserves the greatest consideration.\n\nV. I. Abaev's pioneering reconstructions of ancient Scythian vocabulary give an entirely\n\ndifferent orientation and direction to the question of the origin and character of Slavic-\n\nIraniantie s(Osetinska iazyk ifalklor, 1949).A c c o rd in gtoA baev,S cy th ian had m a n yold com -\n\nmon isoglosses with Balto-Slavic, Germanic, and Italo-Celtic not shared by other Iranian\n\nlanguages, isoglosses that suggest that the Scythian branch of the Iranian languages was\n\nautochthonous in Eastern Europe. Abaev writes:Everything falls into place once -we\n\nadmit that the Iranian element was present in southern Russia at least from the\n\nbeginning of the second millennium B.C. Then the process that brought about\n\nthe formation of Scythian-European isoglosses can be sketched in the following way. After the Iranian ethno-linguistic community in Southeastern Europe dis- solved, one part of the tribes that had formed it moved south and east, to Media, Parthia, Persia, and Central Asia. Another part, the ancestors of the future Scythian tribes, remained in Europe and in the course of many centuries developed in contact with the peoples of the Central and Eastern European area... It was in this period that the identity of Scythian within the Iranian language group was deter- mined and numerous Scythian-European isoglosses originated ...The special Scythian-Slavic isoglosses far exceed in number and weight the special ties of Scythian withany other European languageor language group(V.J. Abaev,S kif o- evropejskie\n\nizoglossy Na styke vostoka i zapada, 1965). VIVID PARALLELS\n\nThe linguistic evidence is impressive. A casual comparison of the language of the ancient/modern Slavs with that of the ancient Indo-Iranians immediately reveals vivid parallels in letter, sound, and meaning. Such parallels are all the more extraordinary when one considers several important facts. The Indo-Iranian basis for comparison, the San- skrit of the Rig Veda and the Iranianof theA vesta, are less than ideal base lines. TheR ig\n\nVeda, the oldest known Veda, and the Avesta, fragments of ancient sacred writings pre-\n\nserved by theZ artoshti or Zoroastrians, were transmitted orally for centuries before they\n\nwere written down, filtered, and modified by a thousand years or more of history. Though\n\ntheR igV eda' so r i g i n s aretraced to the15th century B.C. ande a rlie r, it was written down\n\nin one of many Indie dialects no earlier than the 3rd century B.C., when two alphabets\n\nappear in Asokan inscriptions. The oldest Iranian language, Avestan, the language of the\n\nAvesta, was committed to writing at a much later date, the 4th century A.D., with a\n\nspelling that tended to obscure the original form of the language.\n\nLOST LANGUAGES, DIALECTS\n\nMany ancient Indo-Iranian and related Indo-European languages are lost or un- known except for isolated fragments. This is the case with the bordering Indo-European languages of Anatolia, the northern Caucasus, and Near East. Some surviving words are intriguing (e.g. Hittite godP eru a s, Kassite sun godS urias, Hittite lord,Ish a n ). Surviving Indo-Iranian languages and dialects remain insufficiently investigated for links with old and modern Slav languages. There is reason to believe that there is linguistic gold in the more remote hills. In the high mountains and remote valleys of the Hindu Kush, for example,P arun is the Kafiri God of War; in Afghanistan, his Pushtu name isP erun.\n\n9A. INDO-IRANIAN / SERB-SLAV GLOSSARY\n\nOur primary Slav basis for comparison, modern Serb, is separated from the Indo- Iranian model, by several thousand years of history and development, by a great loss of vocabulary, especially in terms of basic social-religious institutions and values. With re- gard to the pace of linguistic change, it is important to note that by 200 B.C. or earlier, the common language of the migrating Aryans had evolved into two separate and differ- ent languages, Indo-Iranian and Indo-Aryan. In some important instances, the words have not only different but opposite meanings. For example, the Indie-Sanskrit word for god,deva, is now the Iranian-Avestan word for demon,daeva. Nonetheless, in letter, sound and meaning many Indo-Iranian words appear to share roots with old and modern Slav words. Nowhere are the parallels more numerous and profound, the sounds and rhythms more obvious, than in modern Serb. Even the most cursory reading of theR ig\n\nVeda, Avesta,and later texts and commentaries suggest the following parallels, some\n\nperhaps more apparent than real. In the following comparative series, unless otherwise indicated, the first word is a modern Serb equivalent of the Sanskrit word that follows, mainly Rig Veda Sanskrit.

ETHNONYM SERB:\n\nALTERNATI V E LI NGUI STI C THEORI ES\n\nI\n\nn a recent study, H. Popowska-Taborska (hereafter HPT) presents a singu-\n\nlarly informed, insightful, lucid, and comprehensive review of a number of\n\nalternative theories relating to the origin and meaning of the Serb ethnonym pro-\n\nposed by authoritative and leading Slavists on a strictly linguistic/etymological basis\n\n(Wczesne Dzieje Slowian w swietle ich Jezyka—The Early History of the Slavs in Light of Their Language,\n\n1993).\n\nTWO SCHOOLS\n\nHPT begins her review by identifying the two main schools of thought: On the\n\nwhole, scholars are divided into advocates of a native Slavic origin of the name,\n\nand those who view its genesis on a wider, Indo-European language plane.\n\nNATIVE SLAVIC ORIGIN\n\nThe Polishp a s i e r b is often a key name and starting point in native Slav origin\n\nadvocacies. HPT writes: The former most often point to the Polish name pasierb\n\n(also widespread in Ukrainian, Belorussian, and Russian dialects). The root -sierb-\n\nderived from this appellation denotes, according to some who associate the name\n\nwith the Ukrainian pryserbytyja, 'to join with, to side with someone—he who has\n\njoined with the clan, the tribe, i.e. ally'; according to others, it is connected with\n\nthe root *srb-, *srb- contained in the Slavic verb *srbati, denoting the sucking or\n\ndrawing of fluids through the mouth—he who has sucked the same mother's milk,\n\ni.e. a person of the same family or tribal community.\n\nSOCI AL TERM\n\nOne finds the same idea well stated in slightly different terms by a noted Russian\n\nlinguist not included in HPT's review, namely G. Ilinskij, who explains that the ethnonym\n\nSerb waso r i g i n a l l y aso cialr a t h e rt h a n ane t h n i cte r m : But the South Slavic people,\n\nwhich is the primary bearer of this name, has preserved in its way of life the insti- tution of the zadruga which, as is well known, represents only one of the many types of family union in general. And if this is so, then it is natural to suggest that StrbL originally meant 'member of the zadruga,' 'zadrugar', collectively StrbLJa (compare Upper Lusatian, Serbja 'Serbs') -'the sum of people living in a zadruga way of life', and Pa-strbbja -'a person not fully legally entered into membership in thez ad ru g a.' Inth is way weco m e to the less than surprising conclusionthatS t r b f c was initially not so much a 'national' notion as a 'social' one. The ethnic meaning of this name came about afterward when, in the consciousness of its carriers, and also in the eyes of fellow tribe members, the zadruga way of life preserved by the first members became a distinctive characteristic of their nationality. In other words, this means that Serb is 'zadrugar, ' a 'zadruga member' (za drugar) 'par\n\nexcellence'( G.Ilinskij,K ety m ologiiim eniserb ,J uZ X II,19 3 3 ).\n\nP ROTO- I ND O- EUROP EAN*k e r H\n\nNext, HPT introduces a new etymology proposed by Z. Golab, an always inter-\n\nesting and important contributor to the discussion.A new etymology -was proposed\n\nby Z. Golab, who derived the Proto-Slavic appellative preserved in the Polish pasierb and in the Ukrainian pryserbytysja from the Proto-Indo-European *kerH 'to grow' with the suffix -bho and ascribes to it the primary meaning 'affiliate, member of\n\nthe clan.'\n\n*SIRBU, *KER(H)-\n\nIn a1982a rtic le ,Golabstates hiscase ingreaterd etail(Aboutthe Connection Between\n\nKinship Termsand Some Ethnicain Slavic:T he Case of*Srbiand Slovene).Proto-Slavic sirbu 'member\n\nof a kinship group (extended family or kin)' can be retrieved from *pa-sirbu 'step- son' attested by Polish pasierb, East Slavic paserb and by the Ukrainian denominal verb pryserbytysja 'to join somebody's company' (the primary meaning undoubt- edly was 'to be adopted'). The ethnikon Srbi 'Serbians' and Serbja 'Lusatian Serbs' is obviously identical with this social term ... These phonetic facts, somehow ne- glected in the previous etymologies of the ethnikon Srbi and of the noun -sirbu, are crucial for the reconstruction of the Indo-European source of our word: they clearly point out that we must start from an Indo-European root with laryngeal, something like *CerH-. A root which formally and semantically qualifies as the source of Proto-Slavic *sirbu is Indo-European *ker(h)- 'grow'... Thus, nothing seems to prohibit the derivation of PSL *siru from PIE *krH-bho- with the basic meaning 'adolescent, stripling ... In view of the above *sirbu (IE *krhbhos) would mean primarily 'one who has grown (in the kin), kinsman—'a natural, regular member of the kin' i.e. 'born wih the same parent as others', whereas *pa-sirbu, with its prefix of depreciation, would mean 'adopted, irregular member of a kin'— 'stepson' (c.f. the same formal and semantic relationship in Russ. Syn: pasynok).\n\nParenthetically,p a s to r a k is the Serbo-Croat word for stepson,p a s to r k a , stepdaughter,\n\npastorce,s t e p c h i l d , pastorcad,s t e p c h i l d r e n , pasanac,b ro th e r-in -la w .\n\nW I DER I NDO- EUROPEAN PLANE\n\nTurning to advocates of a wider Indo-European language plane, HPT writes:\n\nO.N. Trubacev perceives the genesis of the name on a wider Indo-European plane, deriving the Slavic ethnonym from the Indo-European *servo- 'the whole, every.' Trubacev suggests a semantic analogue in the Germanic ethnonym Aleman 'all men.' K. Moszynski attributes the Slavic root *Srb- to the Indo-European *servo- 'to carefully protect'. S. Respond derives the name from the Proto-Indo-European base *serv- 'to flow' (*ser-bh-), noting that in the Indo-European, especially cen- tral Satem languages fluvial and tribal names were formed from this base.\n\nF ORTUI TOUS CONCORDANCE\n\nHPT continues her review with an important and key point: advocates of a\n\nSlavic genesis believe that the name Serb in Asia and elsewhere is more often a matter of\n\ncoincidence than confirmation. HPT writes: Advocates of the Slavic genesis of the\n\nname in the element Serb- and in similar elements appearing in the onomastics of different countries of the world of antiquity (i.e. the Serbs mentioned by Ptolemy among the tribes between the Caucasus and the Volga in Asiatic Sarmatia) see a fortuitous concordance.\n\nSEMANTIC PROBLEMS\n\nHPT continues by noting certain semantic problems relating to a Slavic genesis.\n\nHPT writes: The lack of accepted solutions on Slavic grounds is rooted primarily in the semantic sphere of the word. Assignment of the primary meaning 'ally' arises from the direct connection with the Ukrainian pryserbytsja, 'to join with, to side with someone'. However, there is evidence to suggest that the Ukrainian form is a secondary one on Slavic terrain, and that its present form arises from sound and semantic confusion of the root *srb- (*srb-) and *sebr-. For the meaning of the Ukrainian pryserbytsyja is the meaning of the earlier Slavic root *sebr-, widespread in the names of comrades and kinsmen. Confusion of the continuants *srb- (*srb) with this root does not seem impossible (especially the distinction in the clusters - rb and -br- could easily be missed).\n\n*SEBRU\n\nAt this point mention should also be made of Golab's ideas on Proto-Slavic\n\n*sebru. In the article cited above, Golab writes: There is, however, another Proto-\n\nSlavic term which should be discussed in this connection: *sebru; it is attested by Old Russian sjabru 'neighbor, a member of the same community', Russian dialect sjaber, Gen. sjabra 'neighbor, companion; partner etc; Old Serbian sebri 'partici- pant, companion, partner'; Serbo-Croatian sebar, Gen. sebra 'farmer' (in Dubrovnik); Slovenian srebar, Gen. srebra 'peasant'; borrowed from the Slavic: Alb. (Tosk) sember 'partner, co-owner of cattle'; Modern Greek ... partner; Hun- garian cimbora 'companion, friend'; Romanian simbra f. 'society, community'. According to Trubacev, who derives this word from *sem-ro, i.e. from the basis of fsem-lja 'family', the primary meaning of*sebru was 'member of a \"co-habitation\" group'; thus this meaning would carry the oldest, primary Indo-European seman- tics of *koimo- = *semo- as 'lair, camp', earlier than the meaning 'extended family' attested for semlja. I do not think that such a distinction is necessary. If the etymology of *sebru as derived from *sem-ro (or rather from an earlier *soim-ro- or *sim-ro-) is correct, then we are dealing here with a really very old Indo-Euro- pean term, namely: \"koim-ro\" or *kim-ro-, representing two apophonic grades of\n\ntheroot(On thesub jec t ofS lavicseb ar andL ith u a n ia nseb ras: J .K alim a,S lav.*seb r' Nac hb ar, K a m era d ' u n db ait,\n\n\"sebras, ZsP 17, 1941).\n\nYUGOSLAV SCHOLARSHIP\n\nTwo distinguished Yugoslav scholars, Petar Skok (1881-1956) and Milan Budimir (1891-1976), who individually and collaboratively added greatly to our knowledge of the early history and Slavic settlement of the Yugoslav lands, give the following infor- mation on serb/sebar/srebar.

BRUCKNER\n\nNext, HPT calls our attention to an interesting and related hypothesis proposed\n\nby the eminent Polish scholar, H. Bruckner: Worthy of a second look in this context is the hypothesis of Bruckner, who links the Polish pasierba and the Slavic ethnonyms with the root contained in the Slavic verbs designating the sucking or drawing of fluids through the mouth. The fact of the existence of the Slavic appellative *srbfc is confirmed by the Czech place name Mlekosrby, etymologically entirely transparent, in which the second member in Czech is homonymous with the ethnonym of interest to us. The name of the Slavic ethnonym Serbs is also connected almost certainly with its original meaning 'to suck, to lap'. Undoubt- edly this ethnonym originally referred to those who sucked the milk of the same mother, and thus became the term for family kinship, which was secondarily ex- panded to the tribal community. In accordance with this etymology the appellative preserved as a relic, *pa-srbt, would signify 'the one who did not suck the milk of the same mother, i.e. the child of another mother'. At what moment *srbb (*srbb) from the appellative denoting 'relative' or 'countryman' transformed itself into a personal name is of course difficult to ascertain. However, if we establish that it was, at the outset, an everyday Slavic name, far-reaching conclusions on the wan- derings and migrations of the representatives of this same tribal community can- not be drawn from the fact of its recurrence in different parts of Slavdom. This statement does not negate the possibility of the existence of a genetic connection between, for example, the Southern and Northern Serbs, yet from the mere conver-\n\ngence of ethnic names one should not draw conclusions about this connection.\n\nFor, if names with the element *srb- (*srb-) could once belong to the stock of Slavic\n\nappellatives, the possibility arose of the independent emergence of these names in\n\ndifferent parts of Slavdom.\n\nMLEKOSRBY\n\nMlekosrby's recorded history is profiled in Profous' register of Czech place\n\nnames: Mlekosrby, near Chlumce; Jan de Mlekosirb/1343; Sdenco Luawecz de Mlekosirb/1373; Siestak de Mlekosrb/1375; w Mlekosrbiech/1429; Vanek Rezek z Mlekosrb/1454; zamek Chlumecz ...

Machek, EtymologickySlovnik\n\nJazyka Ceskkeho a Slovenskeho, 1957).\n\nH. SCHUSTER-SEWC\n\nOne of Germany's foremost linguists and authorities on Serb/Slavic languages\n\nand dialects, H. Schuster-Sewc, finds substantial merit in Bruckner's theory.3 He writes:\n\nThe root *srb- which is found in the words Srb(in) and Serb we can agree is easy to\n\nrecognize in such onomatopoetic words such as the Slovenian srbati, Old Church\n\nSlavic srbrati, Bulgarian srbam, Russian serbat, Ukrainian serbaty, White Russian serbac, Polish sarbac, serbac amd sierbac, siorbac 'srkati'. In other Slavic languages we also have the form with the apophonic root -er- (*serbati), compare with Slovenian srebati, Upper Luzica srebac, Lower Luzica srjebas, Old Russian serbati- Czech strebati and Slovak strebati. In opposition, Russian serbat: Polish sarbac at the same time tell us that the root *sib)r- can appear in two variants, one withs the\n\nfrontal palatal *rbr, the other, with the hack nonpalatal *rbr. Moreover, Schuster-\n\nSewc writes, Buckner's hypothesis is consistent with the historical-social record. The\n\nnotion that in the first instance Srb(in)/Serb connotes 'brother by mother's milk, brothers nursed by the same breasts' makes good sense in terms of the matriarchal order believed to prevail in early Indo-European society, on kinship and commu- nity based on maternal lineage.\n\nSEREV, SEVERb\n\nNext, HPT deals with a contending interpretation relating to the East Slavic\n\nSever. HPT writes: The attempts presented above to explain the names of the Slavs and Serbs directly upon Slavic linguistic grounds collide, however, with the inter- pretation accepted by some scholars of the East Slavic name Severb, having to do with the peoples situated at the basin of the Desna, Sejm and Sula rivers, and also with the interpretation of the terms Severi, Severci, appearing in the Balkans. In- deed, K. Moszynski sees in the East Slavic Severb, Severa, Severjane and earlier form *Serev - (< —*Serv), which was contaminated under the influence of the term severB 'north' and linked with the Slavic ethnonym Serb, yet is is difficult not to perceive the unmistakable connection between the East Slavic and South Slavic names, and thus a convincing interpretation must be based on premises that em- brace both these Slavic groups. Z. Golab proposes such an interpretation, viewing the etymology of the Slavic ethnonyms Slovene, Sbrbi // Sbrbi and Severb on Indo- European grounds. Deriving the Slavic Sev(-er) from the Proto-Indo-European koi«o-,*kei«o, the SlavicS v o b-en - (secondarilyS lo v en -) from the Proto-Indo-Eu- ropeansuo ho - and the Slavic Sbrb-, Skrb- from the Proto-Indo-European *ker-\n\nbho, Golab ascribes the same original meaning 'kinsman, member of the clan' to\n\nall of these Proto-Indo-European roots, a meaning further supported by numer- ous examples drawn from other Indo-European languages. In his opinion, this meaning lay at the foundation of the Proto-Indo-European system of ethnic names at a time when the mobility of individual ethnic units didn't allow for self-identifi- cation by reference to concrete territories.\n\nContinuing the course of reasoning of Z. Golab, HPT writes: We ought to\n\nconsider that all these names serving as appellatives with the meaning 'relative, member of the clan' on Proto-Indo-European grounds were already functioning on Slavic grounds as ethnonyms without perception of this original meaning by its speakers. In this formulation, the fact of the recurrence of the Slavic names formed from the roots *Sever- *Sloven, *Sbrb-, Sbrb- in North- and South- Slavdom must have for the scholar another significance: Since they were already concrete names, and not appellatives, from their recurrence in different spheres of Slavdom one can draw conclusions about the wanderings and migrations of the Slavic tribes—and these very suggestions are contained in the further deliberations of Z. Golab. So, once again it has been shown how strongly the methods adopted by scholars for determining the etymology of particular ethnonyms bear upon extra-linguistic conclusions.\n\nKIMRO, KIMBRO, SEBRB, SBRBI\n\nIn a recent article on the subject, Golab states his case in the following terms:\n\nBut in connection with the proposed etymology of Seven», etc., one cannot avoid quoting a striking parallel with a similar derivative in -ro- from a stem mentioned already as a close cognate of the underlying PIE *keiuo-: I mean here Slav. *sebr 'companion' (primarily 'a member of the same community') ... Trubacev ... has already derived *sebrB correctly from the same basic stem as semBJa (PIE *koim- ija); he hesistated, however, about whether one should reconstruct as underlying PIE *koim-ro or *kimro-. I think that the latter possibility is better justified... But the parallelism with Sever (i.e. PIE *koiuero-) does not stop here. My contention is that the Germanic ethnikon Kimroi (Ptolemy), Cimbri (Pliny), continued as Old Danish Himber-, New Danish Himmer-land, and die ancient North Pontic ethnikon Kimeroi, Kimeriot belong here too. They represent PIE *kimBro- (=PSL *sebrb) besides kimero-, and the primary meaning was members (mates) of *koimo- i.e. of extended-family dwelling (camp)... The above etymology of Sever- reconstructing as the primary meaning of this ethnikon the concept of 'kinsmen' finds its well substantiated position within PSL ethnonymy together with two other ethnica namely: Sbrbi, meaning also 'kinsmen' (more specifically 'natural descendants of a clan', cf. North.Slav. *pa-strbb 'stepson'), and Slovene through \"folketymology\" from *Slovene//*Svobene, meaning 'affines' ... It seems not accidental that these diree ethnica belong to the oldest layer of Slav, ethnonymy and can be traced in the Slavic North as well as in the Slavic South. And it is also quite interesting that we observe them first of all on the outskirts of the Slavic world: the Danubian Slovene of the 6th century, the Novgorod Slovene of the 9th century, the historical Slovenci, Slovaci and the Pomeranian Slowincy; then the Lusatian Serbja (plur.) and die Balkan Srbi, and ultimately the Danubian Severi//*Sever and the Old Kievan\n\nSever,etc(Z.Golab , Old Bulgarian Severb and Old Russian Severjane,WsJ 30,19 8 4).\n\nI ND O- I RANI AN\n\nIn the next and final step, HPT deals with theories that relate the ethnonyms\n\nSerb andC ro a t to onea n o t h e r and toI n d o - I r a n i a nla n g u a g eroots.Theories also exist\n\ndiat genetically identify the ethnonyms of the Serbs and Croats with one another. So, for example, J. Nalepa sees a Celticized form of the name Sorb (Serb) in the name of the Croats, while K. Moszynski considers the form *xarv- a Scythian ana- logue of *serv (<*serb-). Likewise, Trubacev perceives a convergence of the roots in both these names, linking the Iranian form *xarv- with its non-Iranian form *servo- and attributing the latter to the Old Indo-European sarva 'the whole, every' (i.e. die semantic analogy with die Germanic edinonym Alemanen—literally: 'all people.'\n\nK. MOSZYNSKI\n\nIn Pierwotny zasiag jezyka praslowianskiego (1957), Moszynski affirms the Ira-\n\nnian origin ofS varog. There is one more connection joining the religious-ritual vocabulary of the Aryans and the Slavs. In diis case, however, we are already deal- ing with a clear borrowing by the Slavs from the Aryans. I mean here the only theonym (except for die name of Perun), which can with great probability be con- sidered Proto-Slavic, namely *Svarog. If one trusts theH y patian chronicle com- pletely, then one can assume that die Slavs (at least the Northern Slavs) worshiped under the name of Svarog a fire deity or a solar deity, who in the course of time\n\nembodied in himself both the deified great \"celestial fire\" (i.e., the sun) and the usual terrestial fire. The word *Svarog was formed by means of the suffix -ogo-, which as we will soon see is of foreign, Scythian origin. But the root svar- also has correspondences in Aryan: Sogdian sparoy- 'shine, gleam,' Avestan hvara 'sun, light, sky,' Old Indian suvar, svar idem, Svarita. As the etymology of these Aryan words indicates, the phoneme r continues here the Indo-European 1, which is regularly preserved by the Slavs in their original •words; hence the correct conclusion is that the name *Svarog is rather of Iranian, specifically Scythian origin...The root vocal- ism of the the word...can easily be explained, for example, by the influence of the words *svariti (se), *svarb, *svara, which is very common among the Slavs (espe- cially in the area of beliefs; I myself recorded from a Polesie fisherman on Lake Kniaz: 'Boh svarycsa,' pronounced about thunder; similarly the Polish peasants used to say 'Bog sie swarzy*).\n\nZ. GOLAB\n\nGolab believes Moszynski's etymology is in error. He writes: From a primary\n\nIndo-European *su- we must regularly have hv- in Iranian (xv- in Sogdian). So there is insufficient ground to derived Proto-Slavic Svarog from Iranian. If we accept a hypothetical Aryan *svar-arka- 'sunny, shining' (?), i.e., Iranian *hvaraka- or Middle Iranian *hvaraga-, then we would expect Proto-Slavic *xvorog-, but the form we actually have, Svarog, cannot be in any way connected with the posited Iranian model. The whole Iranian etymology of this theonym is void of any lin- guistic (historical-comparative) background and should be rejected.\n\nSVARBThe old Slavic etymology deriving Svarog from svarb( e.g . Old C hurch S lav i c\n\nsvar'fi g ht'),G olabwri tes,whose basic meaningin most Slavic languages seemsto\n\nbe 'quarrel,' does not satisfy us either from the semantic standpoint: Svarog is not\n\na war-god.\n\nSVARAInstead, G olab proposes another etymology: I would derive this theonym by\n\nmeans of the Slavic suffix rog from the Iranian *svara- 'strong-, powerful — hero, lord.' The Iranian word is posited on the basis of copious Indo-European mate- rial: Old Indian savira 'stark, machtig,' sura- kraftig, usually 'Held,' svatra- gedeihlich, kraftig'; Avestan sura- stark, gewaltig.\n\nAT PRESENT\n\nIn her summary, HPT writes: At present were are not in position to deter- mine unequivocally the location of early Slav homelands either in the light of hydronyms, or through the analysis of Slavic ethnonyms or botanical and zoologi- cal terminology, or on the basis of contemporary lexical divisions. We do know that the real Slavs . . . appear on the historical stage in the 6th century A.D., where the reconstruction of the early Slavic phonetic and morphological system points to the extreme uniformity of the Proto-Slavic language. On the basis of various data, one can thus maintain that the phonetic differentiation of the Slavic language oc- curred in the second half of the first millenium A.D., when the Slavs suddenly began to expand . . . Pre-and post-war researches have proposed whole range of\n\nsolutions to the difficult problem of Slavic ethnogenesis. The author of this work\n\nrefrains from providing more detailed conclusions because she claims, on one hand,\n\nnone of the existing theories is convincing, and, on the other, she is of the opinion\n\nthat on the basis of the linguistic facts it is impossible to carry out a full recon-\n\nstruction on the prehistory of the Slavs.\n\n*M. BUDIMIR\n\nFasmer je protiv veze izmedju grupe serb paserb i grupe seber sebru: die Versuch pas-sirbu weiter mit sebru \"freier Bauer\" zu verbinden, überzeugen nicht.\" Ali ukrstavanje ovih leksickih grupa, koje svakako nisu istog porelda, sasvim je razumljiv s prostog razloga sto se radi o bliskim drustvenim terminima sä gotovo istovetnim znacenjem.\n\nVaznija je okolnost sto se lit. sebras \"sused\" ne moze naprosto smatrati pozajmljenim slov. sjabr seber, koje je svakako sekundarnog postanja ...

Ostaje prema tome da za sve ove slov. sinonime sirbu pasirbu priserbiti sja sjarbru, prisjabriti sja, pored prisebriti sja i seber, all odvojeno öd lit. sebras, treba traziti zajednicko poreklo.\n\nTaj zajednicki arhetip ovog vaznog drustveno-politickog termina morao je glasiti u protoslovenskoj epose simbra sä kojim se ne moze preko proste metateze likvidskog formativa upostaviti veza s ne manje starim terminom sirba \"saveznik, saplemenik, rodjak\"...

Taj podatak potvrdjuje i geomorfoloski termin präg za dnjeparskse katarakte.

Kako je znacenje tog imena siroko \"saveznik, srodnik\", sasvim je prirodno da se ono javlja i van najstarijeg teritorija karpatsko-podunavskih Kimbera i Kimerijaca.\n\nKod starijih oblika imena Simbra i Sirba, da se posluzimo protoslovenskim rekonstrukcijama, situacija je nesto kompikovanija ...

The two deviations, he believes, suggest an early and independent Slav connection with Anatolian metallurgy, a contact hinted at by other linguistic terms: e.g. the Slav( tulm ac u) and Mitanni( talam i) words for interpreter.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nR Skok, Nasapomorskairibarskaterminologijanajadaranu, 1935; DolazakSlovenanaMediteran, 1935; Slavenstvo\n\n1 romanstvo na jadranskim otocima, 1950.

BETWEEN THE VOLGA, THE CAUCASUS,\n\nAND THESEAOFAZOV\n\nO\n\nne finds interesting and substantial support in ancient sources and\n\nmodern scholarship for an Indo-Iranian origin of the Serbs. More\n\nspecifically, for a general theory that traces the Proto-Serbs to the 'Scythian-\n\nSarmatian' lands bordering on the Caucasus mountains, the Sea of Azov, and the Caspian\n\nSea.\n\nURHEIMAT\n\nIn the mid-19th century, L. Quandt, one of Germany's foremost authorities on Germania's Slavs, especially the Baltic Slavs, was also interested in the time and place of their origin, in the primeval, original homeland of Germania's Slavs. His views on the matter can be best summed up in the following words: The northern Caucasus is the\n\nUrheimat of the ancient Slavs, that is, the Serbs who are Sarmatians who are Slavs\n\nwho areSerbs whowereknown bymanydifferentnames(L .Quandt,DieL iutiz en und\n\nObodriten, BaL 22, 1868).\n\nPLINY'S SERBI\n\nThe first encylopaedia, Pliny the Elder's Historia Naturalis, compiled in the first\n\ncentury A.D., locates the Serbs orS erbi near the Cimmerio: A Cimmerio accolunt\n\nMaeotici, Volt, Serbi, Serrei, Gnissi.\n\nCIMMERIO\n\nCimmerio takes its name from the Cimmerians, an ancient people living north of the Caucasus and the Sea of Azov, who were driven by the Scythians out of southern Russia into Asia Minor, the Balkans, and the CaucasusScythia still retains traces of\n\nthe Cimmerians,Herodotus writes, there are Cimmerian castles, and a tract called\n\nCimmeria and a Cimmerian Bosphorus. It appears likewise that the Cimmerians,\n\nwhen they fled into Asia to escape the Scyths, made a settlement in the peninsula\n\nwherethe GreekcityofSi nope was afterwardsbui lt(V.V.

The exact location ofS erbo n i s L act t s or Serbonian Lake is uncertain. The best opinion places it\n\nsoutheast of TrojanSirbis and due south of Cimmerion Serberion andCrimean Sarbacon somewhere between the Isthmus of Suez, the Mediterranean, and the Nile\n\nDelta.\n\nQUAESTIO DE NEURIS CIMMERISQUE\n\nAs was noted in Chapter 10, the linguistic-etymological, archaeological, and tex- tual evidence relating to the origin and character of Serb/Balkan ethnic, ethnonymic, and linguistic ties with Cimmeria and Cimmerians, is the specific subject of two pioneering\n\nand groundbreaking articles by thee m i n e n tY ugoslav lin g u ist M.B u d i m i r( Protoslovenii\n\nStaroanadolski Indoevropljani, 1952; Quaestio De Neuris Cimmerisque, 1952).\n\nMARYA, MARIANI\n\nOne of the more interesting and significant connections relates to a Proto-Indo- European term with Anatolian-Caucasian roots—man, mariani, maryani, an Indo-Eu- ropean military aristocracy that dominated the Mittani, an essentially non-Indo-Euro- pean people centered in an area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. In fact, of course, the term can be traced to the Vedicm ary a or warrior. Budimir and others note that 9th century Byzantine sources refer to the ruler of the Serb principality of Neretvania/Pagania asDux Marianorum. Furthermore, they note, that in the same area, in the Neretva River hinterland, one finds a singular number of places( trz na) where knightly skills were once practiced and tournaments were held. Budimir writesa su i kod iiajstarijih\n\nSlovena postojali ratnici kao posebna klasa, vidi se po terminu -trzan—trzni, trzna\n\n— trzne i trzno — trzna \"odredjeni prostor za ratnicke igre i sastanke\" ... V.\n\nSkaric kaze izricno da je trzan \"seosko igriste, sredselo\". On pri torn istice da se\n\nupravo u srednjoj Bosni, gde je narocito dokumentovano i postojanje i znacenje ovog termina, najvise muslimansko stanovnistvo interesovalo za sportske i viteske utamice. Stoga nije nikakvo cudo sto se neretljanski Sloveni, tako reel odmah po\n\nsvomdolasku,posveti li ratovanjui osvajanjuna Jadranu(M .B udim ir,M ariani,O n]5 ,\n\n1975).\n\nURHEIMAT, MIGRATIONS\n\nFurther evidence of Cimmerio/Cimmerian links to a Serb/SlavU rheim at and\n\nmigrations is found in one of the more interesting and pioneering works in recent years\n\n(G. Holzer, Entlehungen aus einer bischer unbekannten indeogermanischen Sprache im Urslavischen und Urbahischen,\n\n1989).Accordingto Holzer, thoughthe surviving linguistic evidenceis scarce, it is none-\n\ntheless sufficient to suggest that the largely unknown language of the Cimmerians is a link in the Indo-European chain generally and a vital link in the proto-Slavic and proto- Baltic language chain specifically. In an informed, insightful and interesting review of Holzer, A. Loma writes:Sve u svemu, moj sud je da ni jedna Holcerova etimologija\n\nsama za sebe, niti pak odredjen broj njih u svom zbiru ne pruzaju dokaz o\n\npostojanju tematskog sloja pozajmljenica u praslovenskom i prabaltskom. No i\n\nnedokazana tematska hipoteza moze se pokazati korisnom ako naucnim\n\npregaocima, uklucujuci i svoga tvorca, da podsticaj za dalja istrazivanja neresenih\n\nproblema iz proslosti Praslovena i drugih indoevropskih naroda na istoku Evrope.\n\nOd Georga Holcera slavistika i indoevropska komparativna lingvistika mogu i u\n\nbuducnostioceki vatiznacajnedopri nosei ideje(A .L om a,Poz ajm ljem c eizNepoz natogjez ika u\n\nPraslovenskom, JuZ XLVI, 1990)\n\nCAUCASUS, SEA OF AZOV\n\nN. Zupanic's analysis of Pliny's text in the light of other classical sources leads him to to place theS erbi between the northwestern edge of the Caucasus range and the Sea ofA zov( M aeotislac us).Kao rezultat naseg proucavanjaP linijevih Srba inji hovi h\n\nsuseda mozemo postaviti konstataciju, da su u I stolecu posle Hr. ill mozda i pre\n\nSerbi i Serrei ziveli izmedju severozapadnog grebena Kavkaza(C orax) i Azovskog\n\nmora,u susedstvu Ziga (Zinha) Konapsena, Tatai Vala( N. Zupanic, SrbiPU nijai Ptolem eja.\n\nPitanje prve pojave Srba na svetskoj pozornici sä historijskoggeograßkog i etnologsko stanovista, Zbornik Radova Posvecen\n\nJovanu Cvijicu, 1924; Izvor Srbov, Ljubjanski zvon X LX , 1925; Prvi nosioci etnickih imen Serb, Hrvat, Ceh i Ant,\n\nEtnologH, 1928; Srbi, porijekla i ime, Narodna Enciklopedia SHSIV, 1929).\n\nVOLGA, DON, KUBAN\n\nMore specifically, Zupanic's places the Serbs not along the Cimmerium coast\n\n(Ora ipsa Bospori utrimque ex Asia atque Europae curvatur in Maeotim, oppida in aditu Hermonasa, dein Cepoe Milesiorum, max Stratoclia et Phanagoria ac paene desertum Apaturos ultumoque in ostio Cimmerium, quod antea Chimerion vocabatur), but in the\n\ninterior, occupying a large area between the Volga, Don, and Kuban rivers, the Sea of\n\nAzov, and the northwest edge of the Caucasus:2 Pre mozemo kazati, da su Meocani\n\nsedli na celoj spomenutoj obali, do su se ostala plemena u njihovoj pozadini vrstala\n\nprema unutrasnjosti uz liniju Kubana, do njegove gornjeg toka, gde stno\n\nkonstatovali Zige (Zinhe, Zihe). Posto na Vale dolazi donji tok Kubana, treba\n\nSrbe i Sereje traziti na srednjem Kubanu.\n\nSERS, CERS, SYRS, SERRS\n\nIt should also be noted that Pliny's text places theSeraci/Sers immediately after theCercetae Sers, that Mela's text places theSyraces/Sers near and after theSerri/Sers. In this general area Strabo (63 B.C.-A.D. 21) places theSibins, to be readSrbin, accord-\n\ning to W.K etryz insk i( DieL y gier,1868) ando th ers.\n\nSERRI-SERS, SERBI\n\nZupanic's analysis of Pliny( A c haei, M ardi, Cerc etae, post eos S erac i, Cephalotom i,\n\nin intimo eo tractu Pityus oppidum opulentissimum ab Heniochi direptum esi)a n d o t h e r\n\nclassical texts, mainly Pomponius Mela, leads him to place theS erri/S ers ( M alanc hlaeni,\n\nSerri, Syraces, Colici, Coraxi, Phthirophagi, Heniochi, Achaei Cercetici, et iam in confinio\n\nMaeotidis Sindones) next to theS erbi along the middle course of the Kuban River.\n\nSIRACHI, SERACI, SIRACENI\n\nAccording to Zupanic, the key to identifying nations in the Caucasus is the root\n\nand not the various prefixes and suffixes, especially plural suffixes. We see, writes Zupanic,\n\nthat nominal plural suffixes (especialy bi- and ni- have been used by the Cauca-\n\nsian peoples ... and therefore various name forms have been used for each people.\n\nThis rule applied to the Serbs gives us the forms Ser + bi = Serbi and Ser + ni =\n\nSerni. Without exception the root is Ser. The form Ser + i = Seri might have been\n\ngiven them by their Indo-European neighbors and even earlier by certain Cauca-\n\nsiantribeswhi chalso formedtheplural byadding the suffix-i(R .Novakovic ,O nthe\n\nhithertounused information on the originoft h e Serbs,B aPIV ,198 9).Zu p a n ic ,th e r e fo r e , has nod o u b tt h a t\n\nthe Serri and others, namely the Sirachi, Seraci,and Siraceni, are also Serbs.3 PTOLEMY'S SERBOI\n\nA century later, Ptolemy'sGeogm phia also locates the Serbs orSerbo i m Sarmatia. Ptolemy identifies theS erbo t as one of thirteen tribes between the Ceraunian Mountains (the northeastern foothills of the Caucasus) and the river Ra (Volga):Inter Ceraunios\n\nautem mantes et Rha Fluvium Orinei et Vali et Serboi. According to Zupanic and\n\nothers, Ptolemy's text places the Orinei, Vali andSerboi in Asian Sarmatia, in a broad area between the Don and Volga rivers, between the Black and Caspian seas south of the northern edge of the Caucasus range:Srbi bi dakle prema Ptolemejevoj podeli Eurazije,\n\nmoral! sa svojim susedima Orinejima i Valitna sedeti u Azijskoj Sartnatiji, koja se\n\nu glavnotn prostirala iztnedju Dona i Volga, izmedju Crnog i Kaspijskog tnora sve\n\ndo grebena Kavkaskih planina na jugu ... Orinejce na jugu, u blizini istocnog\n\nKavkaza, Srbe na Volgi, i to na njenom donjem toku a Vale u sredini.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nOn a more tenuous note, Zupanic speculates there is evidence in Ptolemy and other texts that in the post-Pliny period some Kuban Serbs migrated south to a strategic area in the central Caucasus, one that placed them in control of vital military and com- mercial roadways:Verovatno su Srbi dosli iz oblasti Kubana na jug starim vojnickim\n\ni trgovackim drumom koji vodi od Kimerijskos Bospora preko Surube, Koruzje,\n\nEbriape, Serake i dalje preko prelaza Darjal (istocno od Kasbeka) i Kavkaskih vrata(portae Caucasicae) u Iberiju (Gruziju). Tu se se kod juznog izlaza kavkaskog bedema zaustavili, imajuci u ruci najvazni strategijski kljuc. This area, namely north-\n\nern Iberia/Georgia, Zupanic believes, is a source of later Serb migrations and settlments\n\nin Europe:TrebaSrbe traziti severno odVala, otprilike u oblasti centralnog Kavkaza,\n\ntako da su oni uglavnom imali svoju postojbinu u severnoj Iberij ...
