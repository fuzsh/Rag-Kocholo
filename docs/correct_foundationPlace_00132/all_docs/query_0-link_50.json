        "text": "1. 1/17 Post author By Charlie September 8, 2022 The Government System of Montenegro theweeklyrambler.com/the-government-system-of-montenegro/ Montenegro is a small country located in the Balkans in Europe, it is bordered between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and a small sliver of Croatia. It also has a coast along the Adriatic Sea facing Southern Italy. Its capital city Podgorica sits not far from Shkodra Lake and the Albanian border. Understanding Montenegro’s origins goes all the way back to when three Slavic principalities existed within the area. They were Duklja, roughly taking up the southeastern area of modern-day Montenegro, Travunia taking up the western area of modern-day Montenegro, and Raska (Medieval Serbia) also existed in the north. Duklja had gained its independence from the Byzantine Empire in 1042 and begun expanding its territory in the decades that followed, expanding into neighboring Raska and Bosnia, and it even became recognised as a kingdom. The Kingdom would eventually begin its decline in the 12th Century due to civil war over the throne. In its weakened state the territory was eventually taken over by the Nemanjic Dynasty of the Grand Principality of Serbia and would remain this way for the next two centuries.\n\n2. 2/17 The realm that was Duklja eventually became known as Zeta by the 13th Century and following the collapse of the Serbian Empire, the noble Balsic family became sovereigns of the Principality of Zeta. The area in the 15th Century would start being known as Crna Gora which is where the name Montenegro would derive from. The Principality of Zeta was later annexed by the Serbian Despotate, then following this a noble family called the Crnojevics ruled. It is also to be noted that the Republic of Venice controlled some territories of modern-day Montenegro under Venetian Albania, such territories were controlled until the Republic of Venice collapsed in 1797. The Principality of Zeta itself existed until it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire in 1496 who also took other portions of what would be modern-day Montenegro, they allowed clans in the area to be free from some restrictions, but people in the area still rebelled several times against the Ottomans in the 17th Century. Bishops of the Eparchy of Cetinje, which would later become the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, defied the Ottomans by turning the parish of Cetinje into a de-facto theocracy ruled by a Prince-Bishop in 1516. The Serbian Petrovic-Njegos family eventually inherited the Prince-Bishopric. Montenegro would eventually get de-facto independence from the Ottomans following the Great Turkish War which ended in 1699, although recognised independence was not obtained until after the Montenegrin-Ottoman Wars had concluded. This recognition came after Montenegrin victory in the Battle of Grahovac in 1858. The Principality of Montenegro itself had been founded in 1852 preceding that battle. The victory saw the Montenegrins beat a numerically superior Ottoman force, leading to the Great Powers of the time to officially demarcate borders between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire. But even then, the Ottoman Empire refused to recognise its independence and wars between them continued. The Montenegrins won another great victory against the Ottomans in the Battle of Vucij in 1876 and a year later following the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, led to the Ottomans finally recognising Montenegro’s independence via the Treaty of Berlin. The beginning of the 1900s saw rifts emerge between the dominant People’s Party, who wanted increased democracy and union with Serbia, and the True People’s Party who supported Montenegro’s monarchy. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom by Nicholas I in 1910 who would be its only ever king. World War I saw Montenegro initially enjoy successes in its defense but was eventually occupied by Austro-Hungary in 1916, with King Nicholas I and his government fleeing into exile to Bordeaux in France. The end result of World War I saw the rise of South Slavic nationalism and the support of creating a united South Slavic nation.\n\n3. 3/17 Serbian royal troops occupied Montenegro and a question arose over how to unify the country with Serbia, either fully annexed or a federalised system. Supporters for full annexation were in the majority and this led to the Christmas Uprising that would be suppressed. Soon after this the area would then become part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1922 as by then it had been absorbed by Serbia who had joined the new state after negotiations with the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the Serbian monarch Peter I becoming King of the new state. Montenegro’s territory was the Oblast of Cetinge within this state. After restructuring in 1929 the state became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Serbian Prince Regent Alexander I where Montenegro’s territory was incorporated into a larger Zeta Banate within the kingdom called Zeta Banovina which also included parts of modern-day Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. During World War II the Axis Powers attacked and occupied Yugoslavia in April 1941, with Italian forces of Fascist Italy occupying the area that made up Montenegro with plans to turn it into a quasi-independent Montenegrin kingdom. These plans would not come to fruition as an uprising would begin in July 1941 within the occupied Montenegrin territory which was organised by the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The uprising was initially successful, managing to kill, wound and capture as many as 5,000 Italian soldiers, and liberate most of Montenegro apart from the coasts. The uprising would eventually be suppressed by an overwhelming Italian counter- offensive of 62,000 troops brought in from occupied Albania by mid-August. Due to the sheer numbers many fighters laid down their arms and surrendered, although guerrilla warfare would continue on into December. Those who continued fighting would end up splitting into two groups, many joining the Yugoslav Partisans which consisted of Communists and those who wanted to continue active resistance. The other group, the Chetniks, were loyal to the Serbian Karadordevic Dynasty, the group would end up collaborating with Italian forces against the Partisans. War would break out between both groups in the first half of 1942, leading to many Partisans of Montenegro to go to Serbia and Bosnia to join up with other Yugoslav Partisans. There would be continued fighting between both groups throughout the war. The Chetniks controlled most of the country with the backing of Italy. Many Chetniks were moved to Mostar to fight the Partisans in the Battle of Neretva but took heavy defeat. Nazi Germany’s operation against the Partisans in May and June 1943 would also see them disarming the Chetniks due to a fear they could turn against them in the possible event of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. The fall of Fascist Italy in September 1943 led\n\n4. 4/17 to the Partisans briefly taking hold of most of Montenegro before it was then occupied by Nazi forces, leading to the continuation of fierce fighting for the rest of 1943 and 1944 until the Partisans liberated Montenegro in December 1944. Montenegro went on to become one of the six constituent republics of the new communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegro’s capital Podgorica was renamed Titograd for a time after President Josip Broz Tito. Infrastructure was rebuilt, industralization begun, and the University of Montenegro was established. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would dissolve in 1992 during the Yugoslav Wars, but Montenegro remained a part of the now smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. A referendum was held on remaining a part of this state in Montenegro in 1992 with 66% turnout and 96% in favour, with many Muslims, Albanians, Catholics and pro-independence Montenegrins having boycott the vote. Opponents claimed the vote was organised and held under anti-democratic conditions and included widespread pro-federal propaganda from state-controlled media. From 1991 to 1995 during the Bosnian War and Croatian War, the police and military forces of Montenegro joined Serbian forces in attacks on the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, such operations aimed to gain more territory, but were also condemned for patterns of large-scale human rights violations. A Montenegrin General, Pavle Strugar would later be convicted for war crimes. Montenegrin police also arrested Bosnian refugees and transported them to Serbian camps in Foca where they faced systematic torture and execution. 1996 would see relations break down between the two constituent republics of Yugoslavia, with Montenegro’s government severing ties with Serbia’s government. Montenegro also formed its own economic policy and adopted Germany’s Deutsche Mark and then later adopted the Euro. Governments of Montenegro would also further pursue pro-independence policies causing tensions between the two republics. 1999 would see NATO forces bomb targets in Montenegro under Operation Allied Force during the Kosovo War. Tensions between Montenegro and Serbia would calm in 2002 with agreement on renewed cooperation and entry into negotiations on Yugoslavia’s future. This would lead to the Belgrade Agreement which transformed Yugoslavia into a more decentralised state called Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. The agreement also delayed any Montenegrin independence referendum for at least 3-years. A referendum on Montenegro’s independence would later be held in 2006 with 86% turnout and 55.5% voting in favour of independence. This met a threshold set by the European Union that required a vote in favour of over 55%, narrowly. As such Montenegro’s independence was recognised including by Serbia.\n\n5. 5/17 The Republic of Montenegro officially declared its independence on 3rd June 2006 and then joined the United Nations on 28th June. The Royal House of Montenegro (Petrovic- Njegos) was rehabilitated in 2011 and limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic were recognised, although Montenegro remains a semi- presidential republic. An attempted coup in October 2016 that involved leaders of Montenegro’s opposition, Serbian nationals and Russian agents, failed. This led to the indictment of fourteen people in 2017 including two Montenegrin opposition leaders and two Russian nationals. Despite deep division remaining within Montenegro over joining NATO, the country formally joined the alliance in June 2017, with Russia’s government promising retaliatory actions. Montenegro has also actively been in talks to eventually join the European Union. Montenegrin is the official language with the Cyrillic and Latin script being equal. Other officially used languages are Serbian, Albanian, Bosnian and Croatian. The largest ethnic group is Montenegrin, followed by Serbians, Bosniaks, and Albanians, there are also a significant number of other ethnic groups. The largest religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, there are also a significant number who practice Islam. The official currency is the Euro and the country’s population is over 628,210. Government Type\n\n6. 6/17 Montenegro’s Coat of Arms. Montenegro is a semi-presidential parliamentary representative democratic republic. There is a President who is Head of State although their power is largely reserved and ceremonial, and there is a Prime Minister who is the Head of Government. The legislative body includes the Parliament of Montenegro which is a unicameral body, meaning it is just a single chamber. Multiple political parties are allowed. There are various different parties within the Parliament and coalitions are common to form a majority due to the proportionally representative electoral system. The current ruling majority currently includes socially democratic and socially conservative parties, liberals, greens, pro-Europeans, Bosniak and Albanian minority representation, and civic nationalists. The ruling parties are supported by the former long-\n\n7. 7/17 time ruling party the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, a populist big tent party that includes nationalists, neoliberals, and pro-Europeans. The current opposition includes right-wing (from centre-right to far-right) and centre-left populists, social conservatives, moderates, pro-Europeans, conservatives, anti- immigration supporters, Eurosceptics, social democratic parties, social liberals, and nationalists.

They represent the country internally and abroad. The President has a number of powers and duties. Presidential Vacancy/Absence If the President is permanently unable to perform their duties such as due to illness or injury then their mandate shall end early, the Speaker will become interim President until elections choose a new President. If the President is temporarily unable to perform duties, then the Speaker of the Parliament will temporarily act as President until their return. Presidential Powers and Duties The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the country’s armed forces. He/she commands the Army on the basis of decisions made by the Defense and Security Council.\n\n8. 8/17 The President proclaims laws by ordinance that have passed by the country’s Parliament. These passed laws can be sent back by the President for a second consideration but this veto can be overridden if passed again by Parliament. The President must call Parliamentary Elections at the times they are meant to take place as guided by the Constitution and law. Following Parliamentary Elections the President designates a Prime Minister (based on who he thinks has the best confidence amongst the new Parliament – usually largest party/grouping after discussions with representatives of political parties represented in Parliament) and then proposes this to the Parliament who votes on the Prime Minister designate. The President proposes two candidates for Judges of the Constitutional Court (when such spots are open) and the candidate for Protector of Human Rights and Liberties to the Parliament to confirm or reject. The President appoints and revokes ambassadors and heads of other diplomatic missions of Montenegro abroad, following Government proposal and after obtaining the opinion of the Parliamentary Committee that is responsible for international relations. The President accepts letters of accreditation and revocation of foreign diplomats. The President can grant amnesty. Further powers may be stipulated by law as long as they do not contravene the Constitution or other laws. Presidential Removal The President may be held responsible and removed from office for violation of the Constitution. Such a procedure to determine as such is initiated by at least 25 members of the Parliament. Such is notified to the President and a decision shall be made by the Constitutional Court on whether or not the President has violated the Constitution. When the Constitutional Court has made a decision, the report shall be given to the Parliament and President without delay. If the report has found the President did violate the Constitution, then the Parliament can vote to impeach the President which shall also remove him/her from office. If they are removed from office the Speaker of the Parliament becomes interim President until elections elect a new President. Prime Minister and Government\n\n9. 9/17 The Prime Minister is the Head of Government. They are designated by the President following Parliamentary Elections. After they are designated, they are put before Parliament for approval or rejection. But before then the designated Prime Minister will put their programme and proposed composition of their Government (including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers and other Ministers) before Parliament – all of which is voted on simultaneously. The Prime Minister and other members of Government cannot discharge duties of a member of Parliament, any other public duties or professionally perform another activity. The Prime Minister and Government must obtain and continue to hold the confidence of the Parliament of Montenegro to remain in power. The Prime Minister has the power to put forth one of his/her own members of Government for impeachment before Parliament. The Government can also raise the issue of confidence itself to the Parliament. For the Parliament themselves to bring forth a vote of confidence in the Government requires at least 27 members to support such a motion and if the Government succeeds in maintaining confidence of the Parliament another motion of the same nature cannot be introduced until after 90-days have passed. Parliament may also interpolate the Government on certain issues regarding Government work and which is supported by at least 27 members of Parliament and of which is justified. The Government submits an answer within 30-days. The Government of Montenegro has various duties. This includes managing internal affairs and Montenegro’s foreign policy. They must enforce laws, other regulations and general acts. They shall adopt decrees, decisions and other acts to enforce laws. The Government signs international agreements that have been concluded. They propose the Development Plan and Spatial Plan for the country to Parliament, as well as the Budget and its final statement. Failure to present the State Budget by 31 March of the budgetary year would see the Government automatically lose its mandate and fresh They also propose the National Security Strategy and Defense Strategy for the country. Government makes decisions on recognition of States and the establishment of diplomatic and consular relations with foreign states. The Government nominates ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions abroad who are then appointed by the President. If the Parliament is unable to meet during a State of War or State of Emergency then the Government will have the power to adopt decrees with legal power. These decrees will eventually need to be confirmed by the Parliament when they are able to meet next. st\n\n10. 10/17 The Government has the power to dismiss a Municipal Assembly – by discharging its President from duty – only if the Municipal Assembly – by extension the President of that Municipality – fails to perform their duties for longer than 6-months. The Government may also hold other powers stipulated by laws as long as they do not contravene the Constitution or other laws. Other Bodies Supreme Court The Supreme Court is the highest court in Montenegro. It ensures uniform application of laws by courts and performs other activities prescribed by law. The President of the Supreme Court is chosen by two-third majority vote of the Judicial Council after being recommended by the Supreme Court General Bench – they hold office for 5-years and cannot be a member of the Judicial Council themselves and they may be re-elected only one further time. Judges of the Supreme Court are also elected by the Judicial Council. Judicial Council The Judicial Council is an autonomous and independent authority that ensures the autonomy and independence of the courts and judges. They have powers that involve appointing and dismissing officials and judges of courts through relevant procedures. It has a President and nine members – the President is elected from among the members of the council who do not perform judicial functions by two-third majority vote. Four judges are elected and released from duty on the council by the Conference of Judges which takes into account equal representation of courts and judges. Four reputable lawyers are elected and released from duty of the council by Parliamentary proposal of its competent working body. The Minister in charge of Judicial Affairs is an ex-officio member, they may not be elected as the council’s President. The President of the Judicial Council has a casting vote in the event of a tie. All members serve 4-year terms. The Minister in charge of Judicial Affairs does not get a vote on disciplinary proceedings related to accountability of judges. Duties of the Judicial Council involve submitting a report on performance of the council and overral judicial situation to Parliament; electing and releasing from duty judges, Presidents of courts, and lay judges; deliberating on report of the court activities, applications and complaints regarding work of courts and taking a standpoint on them; establishing cessation of judicial duty; establishing number of judges and lay judges; and proposing to the Government the amount of funds required for work of courts. Defense and Security Council\n\n11. 11/17 There is a Defense and Security Council which has duties that include making decisions on commanding over the country’s armed forces; analyzing and assessing the security situation in Montenegro and decide on adequate measures; appoint, promote and discharge from duty the Army officers; propose to the Parliament a proclamation of State of War or State of Emergency; propose use of army in international forces; and any other duties stipulated by Constitution or law. Its members include the President of Montenegro who chairs the council as its president, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. Criteria to declare a State of War must involve direct danger of war for Montenegro, or when the country is attacked or war is declared against Montenegro. The council can proclaim a State of War initially without permission if the Parliament is unable to meet but it must eventually be confirmed by the next possible meeting of the Parliament. A State of Emergency may be declared in part/s or all of Montenegro in cases of big natural disasters; technical-technological and environmental disasters and epidemics; greater disruption of public peace and order; and cases of violation or attempt to abolish the constitutional order. A State of Emergency may be proclaimed by the council initially without permission if the Parliament is unable to meet but it must eventually be confirmed by the next possible meeting of the Parliament. State of Emergency will last until circumstances that caused it cease to exist. Such states above enable greater powers for the Government and other authorities that may involve temporary curtailing of certain human rights and guarantees while such States remain in effect. Supreme State Prosecutor This person is pretty much Montenegro’s Attorney General. He works alongside and oversees the Heads of the State Prosecution Offices and State Prosecutors. State Prosecution as a whole is a unique and independent state authority of prosecution of the perpetrators of criminal offenses and other punishable acts prosecuted ex officio. The Supreme State Prosecutor is elected and released from duty by the Parliament of Montenegro after hearing of its competent working body and recommendation by the Prosecutorial Council, upon announced public invitation. They serve a 5-year term (or 4- years if the person is taking the office for the first time) the same as all Heads of Prosecution Offices. Prosecutorial Council This council ensures the autonomy of state prosecution. It is chaired by the Supreme State Prosecutor unless there is a disciplinary proceeding. The composition, election, mandate and organisation and manner of work of this council is regulated by law.\n\n12. 12/17 Its main duties laid out in the Constitution include establishing the proposal for the election of the Supreme State Prosecutor; elect and release from duty the Heads of State Prosecution Officers and State Prosecutors; propose to the Government the funds needed for work of the state prosecution; and submit reports on performance of the State Prosecution to the Parliament of Montenegro. Constitutional Court of Montenegro The duties of this court includes deciding on the conformity of laws with the Constitution and confirmed and published international agreements; conformity of other regulations and general acts with the Constitution and law; Constitutional appeal (last resort) due to violation of human rights and liberties granted by the Constitution; whether the country’s President has violated the Constitution; conflict of responsibilities between courts and other state authorities, between state authorities and local self-government authorities; and between the authorities of the local self-government units; prohibition of work of a political party or a non-governmental organisation; electoral disputes and disputes related to referendums in cases where they are not responsible to other courts; and conformity with Constitution of measures and actions taken by state authorities during a State of War or State of Emergency. The Constitutional Court has 7 judges elected each for a period of 12-years. Judges are elected and released by Parliament – 2 Judges on proposal of the President of Montenegro; and five judges on proposal of the competent working body of Parliament upon announced public invitation carried out by the proposing parties. Judges must be at least 40-years-old and have 15-years of experience in the legal profession. Judges of the Constitutional Court elect from among themselves the President of the Constitutional Court who serves for 3-years. The same person cannot be re-elected again. Judges also cannot be re-elected to the Constitutional Court following their 12-year term. The Legislative Government\n\n13. 13/17 Meeting place of the Parliament of Montenegro. Photo by Rasho992 from Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 3.0. Source. The Parliament of Montenegro is the unicameral body that makes up the country’s legislature and represents the nation. The Parliament currently has 81 seats which is fixed by the Constitution. It is the job of the Parliament to adopt the country’s constitution, the laws and other regulations and general acts such as decisions, conclusions, resolutions, declarations and recommendations. The Parliament also adopts the state budget. The right to propose laws and other acts is granted to the Government and members of the Parliament. At least six thousand voters may also propose laws through a member of Parliament authorized by the group. Proposals to call a national referendum can be submitted by either at least 25 members of the Parliament; the President; the Government; or at least 10% of citizens with the right to vote. Laws passed by Parliament go to the President to be proclaimed into law. This must be done by the President within 7-days or if the law is under speedy procedure – within 3- days. The President can send a passed law back to Parliament for a second consideration if he/she disagrees with any parts or all of the law. If Parliament re-adopts the law, then the President must proclaim the law. The Parliament of Montenegro must give consent to and monitor any State of War or State of Emergency that is declared due to such extreme circumstances that require them. The Parliament also adopts the national security strategy and the defense strategy.\n\n14. 14/17 It also adopts the development plan and spatial plan for the country. Parliament plays a role on deciding on the use of units of the country’s armed forces in international forces. Parliament regulates the state administration system, supervises the army and security services, and can call for national referendums. The Parliament has the ability to elect and dismiss the Prime Minister and members of Government. They also elect and release judges of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme State Prosecutor, and four members of the Judicial Council from duty. Other positions appointed and released by the Parliament are the Protector of Human Rights and Liberties; the Governor of the Central Bank and the members of the bank’s council; and the president and the members of the Senate of the State Audit Institution, as well as any other officials defined by law. The Parliament also decides on immunity rights; grants amnesty; confirms international agreements that have been drawn up; and calls for public loans and decides on credits of Montenegro. An extraordinary session of the Parliament can be called on an important subject of concern either by the President; the Government; or at least one-third of the members of Parliament. Over one-half of the Parliament’s members must be present for a quorum to conduct business. Certain things passed by decision of Parliament require a special majority, in this case an absolute majority of all members. This includes on: adopting laws that regulate manner of exercising liberties and rights of citizens; Montenegrin citizenship; referendums; material responsibilities of citizens; state symbols including their use and application; defence and security; the army; the founding, merger and abolition of municipalities; to proclaim State of War and State of Emergency; adoption of spatial plans; passing Parliament’s Rules of Procedure; making decisions on calling of State Referendums; decisions on reducing terms of office; and when appointing and releasing the Protector of Human Rights. An absolute majority is also needed on decisions of removing the President from office; electing and removing the Prime Minister and/or members of Government; and decisions on confidence in Government. When the Parliament elects and releases Constitutional Court judges, the Supreme State Prosecutor, and four members of the Judicial Council a two-third majority vote is required in a first round of voting, and then a two-fifths majority in the second. When it comes to the Supreme State Prosecutor it is on proposal of the Prosecution Council. But if they are not supported by a majority vote in the first round, then in the second vote in Parliament the Supreme State Prosecutor is elected from among all candidates meeting the legal requirements.\n\n15. 15/17 Parliament has the power – with proposal of at least 27 of its members – to establish a Fact-finding Commission to collect information and facts about events related to the work of state authorities. There is a Speaker and at least one or more Deputy Speakers who are elected by and from among members of the Parliament following Parliamentary elections. The Speaker represents the Parliament (in an impartial manner), calls for sessions of the Parliament and chairs them; takes care of the enforcement of the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure; calls for elections of the President of Montenegro; and performs other duties laid down by the Constitution, laws, and Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. The or a Deputy Speaker substitutes for the Speaker when needed. A member of Parliament’s mandate may only end earlier either due to resignation; conviction by enforceable decision of the court to an imprisonment sentence six months or longer; if they have been deprived of the ability to work by an enforceable decision; or if they no longer hold Montenegrin citizenship. The Parliament can be dissolved before the end of its mandate only for certain reasons. It can be dissolved if Parliament fails to elect the Government within 90-days from the date when the President proposed for the first time the candidate to fill the spot of Prime Minister. If, for a longer period of time, the Parliament fails to perform its duties established by law, then the Government has the power to dissolve the Parliament upon hearing the opinion of the Speaker and presidents of the caucuses in Parliament. Under no circumstance can Parliament be dissolved during a State of War or State of Emergency, or if the ballot procedure of no confidence in the Government has been initiated. Parliament can also not be dissolved during its first three months after constitution or three months prior to the end of its mandate. If Parliament has been dissolved then the President must call for fresh elections the first day after the dissolution took place. The Electoral System\n\n16. 16/17 Image by AT44 on Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 3.0. Source. Presidential Elections take place every 5-years. The system used is a two-round absolute majority system. In this a candidate must get an absolute majority to win outright in the first round. If not a second round is held between the top two candidates which is won via simple majority. Those serving as President may only be re-elected one further time. Candidates for President must be Montenegrin citizens who have resided in Montenegro for at least 10 consecutive years over the past 15 years. The President of Montenegro cannot perform any other public duty while in office."
