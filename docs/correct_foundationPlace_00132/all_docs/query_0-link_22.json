        "text": "in a year each of the Neuroi becomes a wolf for some days and again becomes what he was)\n\nwith the Serb/Balkan belief invukodlaks (werewolves) with the fact that the vlk, 'wolf',\n\ncompletely absent from the anthroponymy of most of the Slavic languages, is\n\noften found in the personal names of South Slavs: Vukobrat, Vukoman, Vukomil,\n\nVukomir, Vukosav, Vukovoj,B jelovuk,D obrovuk,M i lovuk( O .N.T rub ac ev, L inguistic sand\n\nEthnogenesis of the Slavs: The Ancient Slavs as Evidenced by Etymology and Onomastics, InD 13, 1985).\n\nVUKSA, VUCIC, VUKOTA, VUKIC\n\nIn fact, of course, in the some Serb lands, in Montenegro, for example,V uk often seems to be an element of every other personal or family name. A late 15th century register of adult males in several clans settled in the heBan jan i andPi v a counties of northwestern Montenegro, for example, reveals a high percentage of names derived from the rootvuk- . In the following series, the son's name is followed by the father's name: Vuksa, Radic; Vucic, Radosal; Radic, Vukota; Vukic, Grubac; Vukca, Baldun; Radic, Vukic; Knez Vukcic, Bratum; Vukosav, Vrbic; Vukic, Vladko; Vuksa, Vitoja; Vukman, Vulin; Ratko, Vukasin; Vukosav, Milan; Vukosav, Obrad; Radosav, Vukrnan; Vukasin, Vuk; Vukac, Obrad; Vukac, Milosh; Vukota, Stanimil; Vukac, Pribislav; Vukota, Dabiziv; Radosav, Vukan; Kovac, Vukota; Vukosav, Vukic; Radivoj, Vuksa; Ivan, Vuksa; Radica, Vukic; Vukas, Bratul; Vukosav, Radac; Vucin, Stoje; Vukas, Radasin.\n\nABODE OF THE SLAVENI\n\nIn the next century, Procopius locates theSklav en o i on the lower Danube. Ac-\n\ncording to Jordanes,the abode of the Sclaveni extends from the city of Noviodunum\n\nand the lake called Mursianus to the Danster, and northward as far as the Vistula.\n\nNever one to flatter enemies of the Goths, Jordanes claims that they have swamps and\n\nforests for their cities.\n\nSCLAVINI OR ANTES\n\nThough divided into many tribes with different names( Quo rum n o m i n a li ecet\n\nnunce per varias familias et loco, mutentur), Jordanes writes, theV eneti mainly call\n\nthemselvesSclavinior Antes: principaliter Sclavini et Antes nominator.\n\nONE IN BLOOD AND LANGUAGE\n\nDifferences in name and place notwithstanding, Jordanes writes:All, Veneti, Antes\n\nand Sclavi, are one in blood and language.\n\nDO NOT DIFFER IN APPEARANCE\n\nFamiliar with bothAn tesand Sklav i n i who served as mercenaries in Byzantine armies, Procopius, an adviser to the great Byzantine commander Belisarius, is unable to distinguish one from the other:The Sklavini and Antes do not differ in appearance.\n\nAll of them are tall and strong, their skin and hair neither very light or dark, but\n\nall are ruddy of face. 4. SCYTHS, SARMATS\n\nS\n\ncythia is one of the more fluid and elusive terms in the works of ancient geogra-\n\nphers. At different times it refers to lesser and greater regions stretching from south-\n\neastern Europe in the west to Central Asia in the east. In Europe the geographical term Scythia is associated with two regions, namely the Black Sea Steppe, where the principal Scythic kingdom developed, and, later,S c y thia M inor, a Roman province com- prising the lands immediately south of the mouths of the Danube.\n\nTHE SCYTHIAN LOOK\n\nContemporaneous Greek artisans depict the Scythians as a nation of usually bearded men, who wear their hair long, flowing, swept back from the forehead, with perhaps rather Slavic faces, characterized by heavy browbridges, deep-set eyes, and pronounced noses. Recent excavations of Scythian grave sites offers interesting physical anthropologi- cal information. It indicates that, Renate Rollet writes:in European Scythia, includ-\n\ning the Caucasus regions, the Scythians were Europids without any Mongol char-\n\nacteristics( DieW e ltder Sky then,19 8 0 ).The excavations also indicate that instatu re thean cien t\n\nScythians resemble the highland Serbs, centered in Montenegro. Rolle writes:The\n\nScythians were relatively tall. The tallness is particularly noticeable in warrior burials and those of men of the upper social stratum ... They are often over 6 ft (1.80m) in height, sometimes over 6 ft 3 in (1.90m), and have occasionally been been known to exceed 6 ft 6 in. (2 m.)... This phenomenon can be observed all the way to the eastern extremity of the Scythian world.\n\nTALLEST PEOPLE IN EUROPE\n\nIt is perhaps significant that the same is true and truer of the Montenegrin Serbs.\n\nThe dean of American physical anthropologists, Harvard' s Carleton S. Coon, writes:\n\nThe Montenegrins who are the tallest people in Europe, live on a barren lime-\n\nstone mountain upland ... They are probably the heaviest as well as the tallest\n\npeople in Europe ... Although their legs are long, their trunks are correspond- ingly high ... The Montenegrins' mean shoulder breath is 39cm., and their chests are correspondingly large. The relative span of 101 is extremely low, indicating\n\nthat their arms are short in proportion to either leg or trunk length. The hands\n\nand feet are, as is to be expected, usually of great size. These huge mountaineers\n\nare not as a rule slender, leptosome people; they are often thickset, and are large\n\nall over.\n\nAN ALMOST PERFECT EMBODIMENT\n\nOne finds the same observations in the accounts of English and other European\n\nobservers. In one typical instance, a seasoned English traveler writes:I have never, in all\n\nmy wanderings throughout the world, met a better fellow than the Montenegrin ... The men of the Tsernagora are justly famous for their good looks and splendid physiques. They are a race of giants, and a man of average height in England\n\nwould be regarded here as something akin to a dwarf. But notwithsthanding his\n\nformidable frame and stature the Montenegrin is graceful in all his movements\n\n(H.DeWindt,T hrough S avage E urope,1913 ).Another English observer,ano ffi c e r of the Consular\n\nService, states the case in more succinct terms:The Montenegrin race presents an\n\nalmost perfect embodimentof all thatis admirablein physique(A.G. Hulme-Beaman,\n\nTwenty Years in the Near East, 1898).\n\nSCYTHARUM, PATRIASCLAVINORUM\n\nThe belief that the Slavs originated in Scythia finds clear expression in a number\n\nof early medieval works, including a 7th century cosmography known as theR avennatis\n\nAnonymil Cosmographia:Scythia(Scy t harum ) is the ancestral land (Scytharum est\n\npatria)of the Slavs (Sclavinooum exorta estprosapia).\n\nSCYTHSSimilarly, medieval and post-medieval annals, chronicles, and histories will some-\n\ntimes refer to Slavs not as Slavs, but as Scythsor Scythians. One of the more interesting\n\nand specific variations on the Scythian theme is found in a 17th century inquiry into the\n\noriginsofH u n g a r yw h e re in thea u t h o rcites theS c y thianB ud i n s (Origines Hungaricae Seu,\n\nLiber,QuiV era Nationis HungaricaeO rigoet Amiquistas, 1692).Tracingtheorigin ofH u n g a ry 'sSlavs, E\n\nOtrokosci writes that:Some are f r om Old Scythia, some are Veneds f r om the B alti c,\n\nbut most are Budins, from the Budins who originated in the Don region of Scythia.\n\nOLD SCYTHIA\n\nHerodotus gives the borders of Scythia and Old Scythia in the following terms:\n\nBefore you come to Scythia, on the seacoast lies Thrace. The land here makes a sweep, and then Scythia begins, the Ister falling into the sea at this point with its mouth facing the east. Starting from the Ister I shall now describe the measure- ments of the seashore of Scythia. Immediately after the Ister is crossed, Old Scythia begins, and continues as far as the city called Carcinitis.\n\nBUDINIHerodotus locates theB ud i n i , a large and powerful nation; they all have blue\n\neyes and red hair, north of the Sauromatae. TheBudi n i , he writes: are the original\n\npeople of the country, and are nomads. Their country is thickly planted with trees of all manners and kinds. In the very woodiest part is a broad deep lake, surrounded by marshy ground with reeds growing on it.\n\nPROTO-SLAVS\n\nA number of eminent scholars have little doubt that theBudi n s are a Proto-Slav\n\npeople (e.g. Safarik, Niederle, Lehr-Splawinski, Moszynski, Golab).1 In most instances,\n\nthen a m eB udin istraced to theSlavicro o tb ud- andthelarge andpow erf ulnation is\n\ncentered in the Middle Desna and Sejm basins, which belong to the forest zone. L.\n\nNiederle writes:I do not hesitate to locate the seats of the Herodotian Budini in\n\nthe west, in the vicinity of the Neuroi, and to put them in central Kievan Russia between the Dnieper and Don, approximately on Desna and Sejm ... and on the basis of the explicit statement by Herodotus that the Budini are a people differ- ent from the Scythians ... and on the basis of their physical type and ultimately because of the meaning and form of their ethnic name I do not hesitate to pro- nounce them to be a big Slavic tribe belonging to the eastern branch, thus a part of the later Great Russian (velkorusky) stock which obviously already in a very old period occupied the Desna basin having given the river its Slavic name, and which naturally at the Herodotian time could penetrate along the Sejm as far as\n\nUpperD on( L .Niederle,S lovanskestaroz itnosti, I,19 0 2 ).\n\nNEURI\n\nThey also believe that theBud i n 's neighbors, theNe u r i, are a related Proto-Slav\n\npeople. Regarding their location, Herodotus writes: As for the inland boundaries of\n\nScythia, if we start from the Ister, we find it enclosed by the following tribes, first\n\nthe Agathyrsi, next the Neuri.\n\nVOLYNIA\n\nGolab's interpretation of Herodotus places theNe u r i in historical Volynia, ex- tending east to the Middle Dnieper and west to the Upper Dniester. According to Herodotus, serpents forced theNeuri , whose customs are like the Scythians, to leave their original home and take refuge with theBudi n i . Evidence in favor of a Proto-Slavic identification is found in several areas, including the name's Slavic root (from the Proto- Slavic rootn e r - connoting live, force) and related hydronyms and toponyms (Nur, Nurec, Nuzec and ziemia Nuska on the border of Poland and the Ukraine). Indeed, Golab's examination of the textual, linguistic, and onomastic evidence allows him to make the following statement:So we would consider Neuroi (late PSL *Nervi)to be the old-\n\nest attested endogenous Slavic ethnicon used by a large Proto-Slavic tribe con-\n\ncentrated in the 6th-7th centuries B.C. along the northwestern frontier of Scythia,\n\nwhichcorrepondsroughly to thehi stori cal EastSlavi cprovi nceofVolyni a(Z .Golab ,\n\nThe Oldest Ethnica Referring to the Slavs: Neuroi and Budini in Herodotus's Description of Scythia, OnO 19, 1974).\n\nGREAT SERB NATION\n\nA 10th century Byzantine source locates one part of the Serb nation, theB lac k\n\nSerbs,inS c y t h i a :ThegreatSerbnati on,whi ch i sdi vi dedi nto t woparts, t heW hi te\n\nSerbs or independent Serbs, and the Black Serbs or dependent Serbs.\n\nSERBS: SCYTHARUS GENTES\n\nMedieval German sources sometimes refer to Germania's Serbs as: Scythae or\n\nScytharusgentes.T heWends andT h eir M ig ra tio n f romS c y thia toGerman Lands is the\n\ntitle of a chapter in a mid-16th century German chronicle compiled by E. Brotuff. The\n\nchronicle records the settlement of the salt mines near Halle by Wends called Serbs\n\nwhomigrated toG ermaniaf romScythi a( Chronic a von den S alz - B ornenundE rb auung derS tadt\n\nHull an der Sala in Sachsen gelegen, 1554).\n\nSARMATIA\n\nAs theS arm ats overwhelmed their fraternal rivals (Porro Scytharum,\n\nSarmatarumque gens una eteadensab origine) around the middle of the 2nd century\n\nB.C.,S arm atia succeededS c y thia as a more popular name for the 'barbarian' lands be-\n\nyond Roman-Byzantine Europe's eastern frontier.\n\nWHEN ONE CROSSES THE TANAIS\n\nRegarding the original homeland of theS arm atians, Herodotus writes,when\n\none crosses the Tanais, one is no longer in Scythia; the first region on crossing is\n\nthat of the Sauromatae, who, beginning at the upper end of the Palus Maeotis\n\n[Sea of Azov], stretch northward a distance of fifteen days journey.Polybius locates\n\nSarmafia in thePonto-C aspiansteppe( H istona). Ptolemy'sS arm atia is animmensearea\n\nbounded by the Vistulaand Volga rivers and the Balticand Black seas( GeographikeH y phegesis). Pomponius Mela givesS arm atia a European orientation, namely the lands east of the Elbeand northof the Danube( DeS ituO rb is).\n\nSARMATS\n\nSimilarly,S arm at orS arm atae (also Sarabatiae, Sauromatae, Syrmatae, and\n\nSermende among others) succeeds Scythor Scythae more often than not as a learned\n\narchaism for the Slavs (e.g.Sarmatae Sclavi). Pliny, Tacitus and Ptolemy refer to the Slavs on the Vendic/Baltic Sea and the Vistula River as Sarmats. Ptolemy, for example, writes:H abi t an t Sarm at i am g en t es m ax i m ae Ven ed aepro pt ert o t um Ven ed i cum si n um ;\n\nMinores autem gentes Sarmatiam incolunt iuxta Visutalam infra Venedas Gythanes.\n\nMela locatesS arm atia east of Germania:G erm an i ad Sarm at as po rri g un t ur. Precisely\n\nwhereGerm ania ends andS arm atia begins, however, was a matter of some confusion. In\n\nDe Origine et Situ Germanorum (A.D. 98), a somewhat garbled description of the vari-\n\nous tribes west of the Rhine and north of the Danube, believed to be based largely on\n\nout-of-date material, Tacitus is not sure whether some nations wereGerm ans orS arm ats.\n\nHere Suebia ends. I am not sure whether the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti should\n\nbe assigned to the Teutons or to the Sarmatians ... The Venedi have adopted many\n\nSarmatian habits; for their plundering takes them over all the wooded and moun-\n\ntainous highlands that lie between the Peucini and the Fenni. Nevertheless, they\n\nare one the whole to be classed as Germans; for they have settled homes, carry\n\nshields, and are fond of traveling—and travelling as—on foot, differing in all\n\nthese respects from the Sarmatians.\n\nSUEBI\n\nIt is important to note that theS uebi , who occupy Germania's heartland, are also\n\na problem of sorts for Tacitus. TheS uebi , Tacitus writes,do not constitute a single\n\nnation. They occupy more than half Germany, and are divided into a number of\n\nseparate tribes under different names, though all are called by the generic name\n\nSuebi.In the early 1820s, D. Popp was one of the first German historians to identify\n\nTacitus'S uebi with the Slavs.\n\nNOT ALL SARMATIANS\n\nAt the same time it was clear to ancient and modern historians thatS arm at and\n\nSarmatia4 referred to an immense area inhabited by numerous and different nations,\n\nSlavs and others. In the succinct words of one scholar: All Slavs are Sarmatians, but all\n\nSarmatians are not Slavs.\n\nSCLAVI SARMATI\n\nAccordingly, medieval German sources often refer to Slavic Germania as\n\nSarmatarum and the native Slavs as Sa.rma.tesor Sclavi Sarmati. In the 16th century one\n\noften findsS arm atia in the titles of Polish Kings: Invictissimum dominum\n\nSigismundeum, regent Polonie, magnum ducem L ituanie, Russie, Prussie, Sarmatieque Europee dominum et et heredum; Regnum Sarmatiae; Rex Sarmatiae Europee invictissimus; Sarmacie Totius Rex; Sarmatiae Poloniaeque Rex; Sarmatiae Regis; Sarmaticaresp ubl i c a, Sarmatae populus( KPotkowski,Sarm atissm us ahpolitisc heideologic der\n\njagelionischen Dynasties, Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropae Forschung 44, 1995).\n\nSLOVO APUD SARMATAS\n\nThatS arm ats wereS lavs wereS arm ats was the premise of numerous medieval and later commentaries on the history and language of the Slavs. In a mid-16th century history of Bohemia, the learned Bishop of Olomouc, John Skala of Dubravka( J ohannes\n\nDubravius), derives the nameSlo v en (Slav) from the Sarmat wordSlo v o which, he ex-\n\nplains, has the same meaning asV erb u m in Latin:I d en i m S t o wo ap ud S arm at as, q uo d\n\nverbum apudL ationospersonat. Quoniam igitur otnnes Sarmatarum nationes late jam tune, longeque per Regna et Provincia sparsae unum nomen eumdemque sermonem, atque eadem propemodum verba sonarant, se uno etiam cognomine\n\nSlovanos appellabant. Ab ipsapraeterea gloria, quae apud ilos Slava dicitur, Slavitni\n\ndicti( H istoriaeR egniB oiem iae,15 5 2 ).\n\nSLAWISCHEN VOLKSTAMM\n\nOn the basis of historical documents and textual analysis, in the 19th century\n\nmost historians and Slavists of note readS arm at asS lav. Quandt, for example, writes\n\nthatS a rm a t is another name forS la v : Der Name bezeichnet den Slawischen\n\nVolkstamm.\n\nOLDEST RETRIEVABLE HABITAT\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century linguistic analysis tends to generally confirm\n\nthe prehistoric 'Sarmat' roots of Slavdom. The following words, for example, follow Z.\n\nGolab's examination of a number of Slavic words with the initial x-: First of all, the\n\nproblem of the prehistorical ethno-linguistic contacts between the Slavs (Proto- Slavs) and the Pontic Iranians (Scythians and Sarmatians) reappears as an impor- tant problem. Such a number of loanwords concerning such different semantic spheres cannot be accidental: it must be interpreted as a result of a prolonged period of very close inter-ethnic relations, especially because among the words discussed there are such for which we should a phonemic 'Iranization' rather than simple borrowing. Briefly, we should 'rehabilitate' the idea of close relations between the Proto-Slav and the Scythians or Scytho-Sarmatians ... Another con- clusion which can be drawn from the above lexical facts concerns the location of the oldest 'retrievable' habitat of the Slavs in the period of their close contacts\n\nwitht hePonticIranians( Z .Golab ,T helnitialX - inCom m onS lavic : AContrib ution toP rehistoric alS lavic -\n\nIranian Contacts, American Contributions to the VIIInternational Congress of Slavists, 1973).\n\nSarmaticaresp ubl i c a, Sarmatae populus( KPotkowski,Sarm atissm us ahpolitisc heideologic der\n\njagelionischen Dynasties, Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropae Forschung 44, 1995).\n\nSLOVO APUD SARMATAS\n\nThatS arm ats wereS lavs wereS arm ats was the premise of numerous medieval and later commentaries on the history and language of the Slavs. In a mid-16th century history of Bohemia, the learned Bishop of Olomouc, John Skala of Dubravka( J ohannes\n\nDubravius), derives the nameSlo v en (Slav) from the Sarmat wordSlo v o which, he ex-\n\nplains, has the same meaning asV erb u m in Latin:I d en i m S t o wo ap ud S arm at as, q uo d\n\nverbum apudL ationospersonat.

The following words, for example, follow Z.\n\nGolab's examination of a number of Slavic words with the initial x-: First of all, the\n\nproblem of the prehistorical ethno-linguistic contacts between the Slavs (Proto- Slavs) and the Pontic Iranians (Scythians and Sarmatians) reappears as an impor- tant problem. Such a number of loanwords concerning such different semantic spheres cannot be accidental: it must be interpreted as a result of a prolonged period of very close inter-ethnic relations, especially because among the words discussed there are such for which we should a phonemic 'Iranization' rather than simple borrowing. Briefly, we should 'rehabilitate' the idea of close relations between the Proto-Slav and the Scythians or Scytho-Sarmatians ... Another con- clusion which can be drawn from the above lexical facts concerns the location of the oldest 'retrievable' habitat of the Slavs in the period of their close contacts\n\nwitht hePonticIranians( Z .Golab ,T helnitialX - inCom m onS lavic : AContrib ution toP rehistoric alS lavic -\n\nIranian Contacts, American Contributions to the VIIInternational Congress of Slavists, 1973).\n\nENDNOTES\n\nIn Sebrany Spisy, I (1862), sub-section Slovanske narody u Herdota, Safarik discusses the linguistic, onomastic and\n\ntextual evidence in favor of a Proto-Slav interpretation of the Budini and the 'Neuri cili Nuri.\" M.I.

SLAVS ARE SARMATS ARE SERBS?\n\nT\n\nhe notion that theS arm at s wereS lavs was originally based in large\n\npart on the premise that theSarm at s wereS erbs, that the names\n\nSarmat and Serb share a common root. Thus medieval texts sometimes identify\n\nSarmatiaas Sarabatije, as land of the Serbs/Sorabsi'Sarahs: Sarabatiepropiecurrentes\n\nvelsibi viventes Zirbi.\n\nSARMATAESIRBI\n\nBishop Salomon's early 10th century dictionary-encyclopedia,M ater V erb orum in-\n\nforms readers that theSarmats were once called Serbs: Sarmatae... Sirbitum dictia\n\nserendo id estquasi sirbintiu. Vecerad, an early 12th century commentator on the Czech\n\nedition of Mater Verborum equates theS arm at sand S erbs in the following terms:\n\nSarmatae populi Zirbi,110 2\n\nANTIQUISSIMUM NOMEN SARMATIS\n\nAn early 16th century chronicle, Chronicon Carionis, originally compiled by J. Carion (1499-1537), a noted German mathematician, astronomer, and historian, first printed in 1532, relates theS arm at i an s to theS erbs in the following ways:The name\n\nSerb is derived from the names Sorab and Sarmat(a Sorabos et Sarmatis trahere);\n\nSorab is the oldest form of SarmatEx nomine exitimo factum esse nomen Sorabi,\n\npaucis literis mutatis; Soraborum antiquissimum nomen a Sarmatis retinuerunt).\n\nThe same source asserts thatS arm at i s the original name of allS erbs, of northern and\n\nsouthernS erbs: S art n at arum ap p el at i o n em , c um q uae eo d em est S o rabo rum B o real i bus,\n\nqui supra Pontum etMaeotidem habitarunt.\n\nSRBLI ILLYRIORUM\n\nIn his mid- 16th century study Chalcondyles notes the historical and linguistic\n\nfactors that demonstrate beyond doubt that theS erbs/S rbl i ofIlly r ia / Illy r io r u m originate\n\ninSarm at i a: From the Danubian lands on the the edge of Europe, from Sarmatia.\n\nSARMATARUM, SORABI, SERBLI\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries some scholars remained certain that the nameS erb\n\nis derived fromS arm at , that over time the nameS arm at evolved and survived asS o rab\n\nand Serb: Obscurantum tamepaulatim et Sartnatarum nomen invenimus ita quidem\n\nut soli Sorabi et Serbli id conservasse existimentur. In his discussion of the original\n\nname of the Slavs ('Prvotnajmenu Slovanu) inS eb ra n y S p isy II (1863), P. Safarik makes\n\nit clear that: (1)Wendend Sarmat• ax e.other and later names forS erb (Vindove aSarmati\n\n= Srbove);(2) thatS arm at i s another name forS erb (O Sarmatech = Srbech).\n\nSERBISCHER ABKUNFT\n\nOther scholars, noting that early geographers and commentators routinely abused\n\nand misused the nameS arm at , are certain that it was often used as a name for theS erbs:\n\nDen alten und vielfach missgebrauchten Namen der Sarmaten ... für alle Zweige\n\nserbischer Abkunft. JAZYGES\n\nIn the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries some scholars were certain that the\n\nSarmats-are-Serbs thesis was especially strong in the case of theSarmattan Jazyges.\n\nAccording to Karl Anton von Gottlob, an 18th century German historian, philologist, and author of an encyclopedic history of the Serbs, the early history of the Serbs is obscured by a generic name for the nations of European and AsianSarm at i a, the so- calledS arm atians, a fictitious name for many very different nations including the Serbs, the so-calledSarm at i an s, who, according to Herodotus, spoke a corruptScy t hi an lan- guage( E rsteL inienE ines V ersuc hesü b erderA lten SlawenU rsprung,17 8 3 - 8 9 ).Ins u p p o rt of theJ ftZ g y e thesis, Gottlob and others make the following basic points: 1. In ancient timesS erb was the original, native and common name of all the Slavs; 2. Later, theS erb s were known by two names:Serband Jaz y g e, recorded asSarmattan Jazyge (e.g. Strabon'sJaz i g es\n\nSarmatae); 3. In the pre-Christian period elements ofthe J az y ges left the Serb-Jazyge\n\nhomeland in the Volga basin, migrated westward, occupied parts of Russia, Podolia, Moldavia, and Dacia and challenged the Romans in Danubia-Pannonia; 4. In the 1st century A.D., perhaps earlier, perhaps under pressure from the Huns, theS erbs left\n\nSarmatia and began settling in Europe; 5. InGerm ania the Serbs are called Wends,in\n\nDanubiat h eS erbs are called Jazyges; 6.B e g i n n i n g w ith the 6th c e n t u r yt he Jaz y g e Serbs\n\nofDanub ia are calledSlo v en s by the Greeks and others; 7. Both names,Jaz y g eand\n\nSloven; Jazygehom jaz y k, Slovenf r o m Slovo, are derived from Old Slavic words con-\n\nnoting letter, word, speech, language; 8. All Slavs can be traced to theSerb or Jazyge\n\nbranches of the greatS erb trunk. According to Gottlob, vital evidence in favor of the\n\nJazyge Serb thesis is found in the historical record, in the numerous recorded Slavic\n\nhydronyms, toponyms, and towns (e.g. Ptolemy'sSerbi t i um inP annonia Inf erior) sug- gesting an earlyS erb presence in Danubia 'coincidental' in time and place with that of the so-calledSarm a ti an Jaz y g e.\n\nBABA, BUKA\n\nMid-5th century sources identifytwo J az y ge rulers with Slavic sounding names, namelyB aba andB uka at the head of theSarmatian Jazyges on the Danube near modern Belgrade:Quorum exitio Suavorum... freti auxilio Sarmatarum, qui cum\n\nBeuca etBabai regibussuis auxiliari ei advenissent( 46 9 ); Theodoricus ex sattelitibus etexpopulopatris elegitsibipene sex milia viroum, cum quibuspatre inscio, permenso Danubio, Sarmatarum regem incurrit, equmque interemit,familiamqueac censum depredans, adgenitorem suum cum victoria redit.

Severini, an early authority on the history of Hungary and\n\nDanubia, writes thatS lavs from the Oder, first calledSarm at s, thenWends, thenS lavs, andS lavs c alled J az y ges, with whom they shared a common language and institutions, settled the lands along and between the Tisa and Danube rivers. Zupanic does not iden-\n\ntifyt heJaz y g esasSlav s. However, Zupanic suspectsth a t insomeinstances thenam e\n\nJazygesincludes Slavs calledS erbs. In the case of thejazgyeswho settled in the plains\n\nbetween the Danube and Tisa shortly after Christ's birth, for example, Zupanic believes\n\nthatS erbs are included.\n\nSERBS, BULGARS, JASYGES\n\nIt is interesting that a 16th century source recordst hejasy g es as one of the nations\n\nthat made up Hungary's peasantry: Saxons, Germans, Bohemians, Slavs, Wallachs,\n\nRuthenes, Serbs, Bulgars, Jasyges, Cumans\n\n6. SERS, SCIRS, SRBUL\n\nG\n\niven Toynbee's and other theories of Slav settlement in southeastern Europe, one thousand years before the birth of Christ, it is not sur- prising that diverse historical sources present evidence of possible Serb settlement\n\nin Danubia and Pannonia in the first centuries of the Christian era.\n\nSERETE, SERBINUM\n\nAccording to Zupanic, evidence thatS erb s f rom Sarmatia orDacia settled along the Drava and Sava rivers in Panonnia in the first century of the Christian era or earlier is found in both Pliny and Ptolemy. Namely, Pliny'sS eret e, a nation located on the Drava River, and Ptolemy'sS erbi t i um , a town on the Sava River inP a n n o n ia In f e rio r.\n\nMONIES SERRORUM\n\nIn his multi-volume Rerum gestarum libri, Ammianus Marcellanus (A.D. 330-\n\n395), Rome's last major historian, refers to a section of the Transylvanian Alps asm an tes\n\nSerrorumo r th eS e rr/S e rb M o u n ta in s. ' Zu p a n i c believes t h a t t h e mantes Serrorum can be\n\ntraced to early Serb settlements in Dacia:Since we have shown that Serri is the same\n\nas Serb, the monies Serrorum mentioned by Marcellinus confirms the presence of\n\nSerbs in the southern Carpathians, one of their stations on their move to the heart\n\nof Europe ... Of course, It is quite possible that the Serbs were in the southern\n\nCarpathians before Marcellinus's time. It is possible that Serb elements, together\n\nwith Jazyges, moved in as early as the first century B.C.2\n\nEMPEROR LICINIUS\n\nA later mid-12th century work, Joannes Zonaras'H istoric al E pitom e, believed to based on earlier sources, notably the complete text of Dio Cassius'R om aika and several lost Byzantine historians, relates themantes Serrorum to Emperor Valerius Licinianus Licinius (308-324), Roman co-ruler from 308-324, and brother-in-law—married to half- sister Constantia in 313—of Emperor Constantine the Great (307-337). After 313 Licinius was as supreme in the East as Constantine in the West. A deterioration in relations be- tween the two emperors led to open warfare in the Balkans in 614, where Licinius sought the support of pagans. Following defeat by Constantine's forces in 324, Licinius sought support in theS err M ountains. In the same year he was captured and exiled to Thessalonica, where he was executed the following year.\n\nLIKINIJ SRBINY BITI RODOM\n\nAn intriguing and as yet unaccountable early 4th century Serb connection is found\n\nin medieval Serb church manuscripts that, on the basis of 'authentic sources'( istinih\n\nspisatelja)r e fe rtoL icinius'sS erb ancestry:Glagoljutistini spisatelji jako Likinij Srbiny\n\nbiti rodom ... Sija videv sin jego Bela Uros uze ot sestri carevi Konstatije;\n\nTsarstvujusci Likinijy... severnim i zapadnim stranama Srbin jest.

Rodi od Konstantije sina ot negoze\n\npokolenommimnozii zi dose, daze i doB eloga Urosa(R . Novakovic, Karpatskii Likijski Srbi,\n\n1997).\n\nDAGON, DAGONIA\n\nAn even more intriguing early Serb connection with early Danubia/Dacia is found\n\nin one of them a n u sc rip ts, theK arlovac kiR odoslov( K arlwacG enealogy ).A ccording tothis\n\nsource, at the time of Emperor Licinius: All Serbs worshiped Dagon. From Dagon the Dagonians and Dacians received their names; from Ser, all the Serbs. It goes on to say that: Among many others, he [Licinius] persecuted the saints and martyrs Jermil and Stratonik, who were in Dagonia, near the Istar [Danube].\n\nASIA MINOR, MIDDLE EAST\n\nSome scholars believe that the reference toDag o n , a great Semitic god, suggests an\n\nearly and substantial Balkan-Danubian connection with Asia Minor and the Middle East\n\n(RNovakovic ,J os oporeklu S erb a— Isva S rb ska idolu sluz ase Dagonu,19 9 2 ).Thee m i n e n tG e r m a nSlavist\n\nH. Kunstmann believes that the Dagon cult in Danubia can be traced to Roman Emperor\n\nTrajan (98-117 A.D.), to the forced resettlement of subject peoples originating in Asia\n\nMinor in Dacia. Later, he believes, in the Christian era,Dag o n was a generic term for\n\npagans, for pagan Slavs in Dacia, for pagan Serbs who later settled in Poland, where\n\nKunstmann finds traces of Dagon (Dagome-iudex-Regeste) in late 10th century Polish\n\nsources, including the name and titles of the house of Piast's Mieszko I, Poland's first ruler\n\n(H.K unstm ann,Ü berde Herkunftder Polenvon Balkan, DwS,29, 1984)*W ithregard to theSerb-Polish\n\nDagon Connection, Kunstmann writes:Freilich, im Laufe der Jahrhunderte hat sich\n\ndie Bedeutung Dagons ganz erheblich geändert, nämlich ins diametrale Gegenteil, was besagt, dass der Name Dagon zum nomen dei falsi, zur Bezeichnung heidnischer Kulte, der Heiden schlechthin wurde. Dass die Verwendung des Namens Dagon zur Bezeichnung von Heiden sogar nch 1503 unter Balkanslaven üblich gewesen zu sein scheint, lasst sich belegen und beweisen. Eine Urhunde aus Karlovac, in der kurz über die Geschichte der serbischen \"Zaren\" berichtet wird, sagt folgendes: I vsa Srbska idolu sluzase Dagonu, otsud i Dagoni i Daky imenujut se. Damit wird nun nicht nur erstmals der Landername Srpska belegt, sondern auch, was im gegebenen Zusammenhang wichtiger ist, dass es zum Namen Dagon offenbar ebenfalls den Plural Dagoni gegeben hat, und zwar im Sinne von\n\nHeiden.\n\nDoch werden in der betreffenden Urkunde unter diesen heidnischen Dagoni ganz konkret die Daci oder Dacier verstanden. Gegen Ende heisst es in der Urkunde ausserdem este si v Dagaoni bliz Istra, was sogar erkennen lasst, dass die ehemalige romische Provinz Dacia, das Land Dacien, im Slavischen einmal Dagon geheissen und wohl die Bedeutung von Heidenland gehabt zu haben scheint. Wenn die Urkunde von 1503 unter diesen heidnischen Dagoni \"dacische\" Serben versteht, dann spiegelt sich darin auch ein Stuck Siedlungsgeschichte von den Daciern zu den Slaven wider. Die nich zu verkennende lautliche Übereinstimmung der ersten Silben Dag -oni//Dac -i had die volksetymologische Synonymic fraglos gefordert. Die in den drei Hanschriften der Dagome-iudex-Regest benutzte Form Dagone, also mit -e im Auslaut, ist eindeutig ein Reflex des Slavischen, das nämlich Dagon mit Halbvokal verwendet. Parenthetically, the fish, L. M. Graham writes, is a universal savior symbol...\n\nThe Hindus represented the first Avatar of Vishnu as half fish, half man—Pisces-\n\nAquarius; and our Christ is called by the the Piscean Avatar. In the Talmud the\n\nMessiah is called Dag, the fish. The Phoenician and Philistian Dagon, the\n\nChaldean Cannes, and the Greek Phoibos were all fish men. The Greek word for\n\nfish ichthus is made up of the initials of the five Greek words lesous (Ch)ristos,\n\n(Th)eou Uios Soter—Jesus Christ the son of God, Savior.\n\nDANUBIA. PANNONIA\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in theD ia lo g u e s of P s e u d o - C a e s a r , an early 5th century compi- lation based partly on 4th century sources, the Danubian Slavs are recorded asS k la v e n o i. A better known and often cited source on mid-5th century Danubia is Priscus of Priam, a Byzantine official and historian. A member of an embassy sent to Attila's camp in Pannonia by the Eastern emperor Theodosius II, Priscus is a perceptive, reliable and rare source of information on this tumultous period. In his account, Priscus mentions several nations that appear to have Slavic sounding names. In 434, Priscus writes: They [Huns] has-\n\ntened to Scythia ... Soon they crossed they huge [Maeotic] swamp and ... over- whelmed the Alipurzi, the Alcidzuri, the Itimari, the Tuncassi, and the Boisci who bordered on the shore of Scythia.\n\nBOISKI SERBS?\n\nIn 432 or 433, Priscus writes:a Hunnish ruler ... intending to go to war with\n\ndie Amilzouri, Itimari, Tonosours, Boiski and other races dwelling on the Danube\n\nand who had taken refuge in a Roman alliance.Some scholars suspect that some of\n\nthe nations so-named are Slavs, perhaps Serbs, namelytheA l- m iz uri,Milcani Serbs; the Tono-sursi, Surs-Serbs; the Iti-mari,M oravi Serbs; the Boiski,B oi ski Serbs, Emperor Constantine VII'sB oi ki Serbs.\n\nSTRAVAPriscus' account of his visit to Attila's camp in Pannonia also reveals strongs Slavic\n\ntraces in the personal names, food, drink, and customs of the Huns and their Scythian\n\nallies: millet//>rar0; honey/medos; funeralf east/strava). Especially striking is the Slavic fu-\n\nneral ceremony orS tra v a following Attila's death in 454: After he had been mourned\n\nwith such lamentations they celebrated a 'Strava' as they call it, over his tomb with\n\ngreat revelry, coupling opposite extremes of feeling in turn among themselves.\n\nA SLAVIC TRIBE\n\nC.D. Gordon's authoritative translation and commentary on 5th century Greek\n\nhistorians gives important information on the Sciri or Scyri, a Slavic tribe, once part\n\nof dieHunnishempi re( T heA geof A ttila,i960).We learn that: 1) TheSciri, who had\n\nsettled in Lower Moesia on the Danube, were a power in Pannonia where they were\n\nin more or less constant conflict with the Goths; 2) the Sciri played an important role\n\nin the Western armies commanded by Ricimer [appointed commander of imperial\n\narmies by emperor Avitus] and his successors; 3) the Sciri formed an important\n\npart of Odovacar's army in his final conquest of Italy; 4) Odovacar, the first barbar-\n\nian king of Italy, either sprang from the race of Thuringi on his father's side and the\n\nSciri on his mother's side,according to one account, or he was of the nation of the\n\nScyri,according to another.\n\nSARMATIAN SCIRI\n\nIn fact, Pliny suggested the ethnic character of theSciri several centuries earlie\n\n(Pomerania isinhabited as far as theV i stulaRiver by theSarmatian Venedi,Sciri,\n\nHirri). While Pliny's text does not identify the Sciri as Serbs, evidence in support ofthat I\n\nnotion is found in the fact that in the general area inhabited by the SarmatianSciri, inI prehistoric Pomerania and Poland west of the Vistula, one finds overwhelming onomas- tic evidence of Serb settlement.\n\nSCYTHIAN AND GERMAN NATIONS\n\nWith regard to this period, to the role of Slavs in Gothic armies, it is important to keep in mind that history and archaeology indicate that the Goths generally, and the Ostrogoths or East Goths, east of the Dniester River, particularly, had significant Slavic components. Referring to an early Gothic ruler, Cassidorius' Origo Gothica states that Ermanaric ruled over all Scythian and German nations. In this regard it is important to keep in mind that by the mid-4th century, the Ostrogoths, who dominated the Pontic area, were ethnically and culturally transformed by local elements. In fact, recent excava- tions indicate that Germanic elements were never preponderant, that 'Scythian' Slavs formed an important part of the Ostrogothic kingdom. The 'Scythization' of the Ostrogoths is discussed at length in a recent work by the German historian H. Wolfram\n\n(HistoryoftheGoths,1988). Linguistic evidenceof earlyand close Slav-German associationin\n\nmilitary affairs is found in the Old Slav/>/«£, troops in battle formation, in Slavic deriva-\n\ntivesp lu k , p u lk , p u k connoting regiment, people en masse, and Gothic-German equiva-\n\nlents,nam ely f olk, f olc , f olk; in such Slavic combination personal names/titles asS vetopolk,\n\ncommander of a strong troop.\n\nMODERN SCHOLARSHIP\n\nIn different ways and degrees authoritative modern scholarship offers support for Gottlob's general thesis in terms of earlySarn ut t i an -Slav -Serb settlement in Danubia- Pannonia.The broad, deep, exhaustive,and thorough researchof L. Niederle( S lovanske\n\nStarozitnosti, 1902-1919), one of thep illars of modern Slavistics, suspectsth a t theSlavsw ere\n\nalready in Central Europe at the end of the second millennium, alongside the Germans in the north, alongside the Thracians in the Carpathians, with the Iranians and Caucasians in the Black Sea area, with the Baits along the Baltic Sea, where they lived together in a Baltic-Slavic union. All available evidence, Niederle writes, places the Slavs in southern Hungary, Transylvania, and the Danube in the first centuries of our era, an area settled by the SarmatianJaz g y es in the first century A.D.\n\nSIRMIUM, SERDICA, VRBAS\n\nCiting cities along the Danube basin, likeS irum ium (Srem) andS erdic a( Sred i st e) , apparent Latinizations for descriptive Slavonic place names, Toynbee suspects a strong Slavonic presence in the area during the Roman period. F. Dvornik, following Safarik, finds hard, conspicuous evidence of early Slavic settlement in the existence of such proto- typical Slavic place names as Vuka, Vrbas andVuci ca in Danubian Pannonia, modern Slavoniaand Banat, areasofS arm at i an settlment,f r o m the 2nd century onward( E arly\n\nSlavic Civilization, 1956; The Making of Central and Eastern Europe, 1974). LIMIG-ANTES, ARDAGAR-ANTES\n\nIn the early 300s the Sarmatians are recorded asL im igantes andA rdagarantes. It appears obvious to the noted historian G. Vernadsky, that the/öz^-SarrnatianL im igantes areL im ig- A ntes are Antes are Slavs, that theA rdagantes areA rdagar- A ntes are Antes are Slavs (The Originsof Russia, 1959).W hen civilw ar brokeout about A.D. 332,the defeated\n\nAcarag-Antes took refuge in Roman territory and were given land in Pannonia or present-\n\nday Serb Voivodina. In the war with Rome that followed, theL im ig- A ntes fought well and bravely (with invincible stubborness, not a single man asked for pardon, records Ammianus). Defeated in 358, forced to retreat beyond theTisza River, theL im ig- A ntes remained a force to be reckoned with until the arrival of the Huns circa A.D. 430.\n\nLINGUISTIC RECORD\n\nThe linguistic record also points in the direction of early Slavic settlement in Danubia. InVanished Civilizations (1963), T. Sulimirski, a noted authority on the Sarmatians (The Sarmatians, 1970), makesthe following supporting points:1) The studyof the toponomy of Romania shows that the Slavs adopted unromanized Dacian place names in the Roman province of Dacia or Latin names and transmitted them to the Romanians; 2) In the sphere of social and political life, the oldest Romanian terminology shows that Latin terms were translated or replaced by Slavic words; 3) The Slavic element came into Romanian during the common Romanian period and before the division of the language into its four main dialects; 4) The phonetic structure of Romanian words of Slavic origin often reveals their great antiquity; 5) The study of the Slavic names of the Tisa and other rivers of the Hungarian Plain also confirm the theory that the Slavs were on the southern side of the Carpathians well before the sixth century A.D.\n\nSRBUL\n\nInteresting contemporary evidence that the early Slavs in Danubia were called Serbs is found in that fact that centuries after the Serbs disappeared and the Bulgars appeared, the natives of Wallachia and Moldavia still refer to their southern neighbors along the Danube asS erbsor S rbul . According to Budimir, in addition to other factors, clear evidence of an ancient Serb/Slav element n Danubia and Dacia is also found in the Roma- nian system of counting from ten upward as well as other linguistic substratums.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nAmmianus' work is written in extreme detail and its general accuracy has never been challenged. Originally in thirty-\n\none books covering the years 96-378, the extant narrative begins with the events of 353, the year he joined the army\n\nand served on Rome's eastern frontier.\n\nIn 'Juzne kulture i narodi prema luzickoj kulturi, Praslovenima i Slovenima', a paper presented at the International Congress of Slavic Archaeolog, Warsaw, 1965 (Miedzynanrodowy kongres archeologii slowianskiej, 1968), V. Trbuhovic presents evidence in support of his thesis that in the first century B.C. the Slavs resisted the Romans in Danubia, that\n\nsome remained, others migrated north and east.\n\nFor a Polish interpretation of Dagome iudex: P.

Carion (1499-1537): 1)Most Sarmats were Wends\n\n(Sarmaturum gentem maximum Henetosesse) ;2)Sarmat andHenet are one and\n\nthe same name and another name for the Serbs.L i n g ua H en eta orWi n d i sche spräche\n\nis said to be the common language of the Slavs. According toChronicon Saxoniae, a German chronicle compiled in 1625, the Slavs on Saxony's borders are Heneti Sorabi who in different times and places are also known as Heneti, Wendi, Slavi andVan d ali :\n\nThe lands east of the Elbe were settled by the Heneti, who the Germans call Wendi,\n\nthe Italians, Slavi, and even Vandali by some writers.\n\nVENEDORUM NATIONE\n\nAs the title of a 17th century study of the Serbs of Germania and Bohemia indi-\n\ncates the Serbs areVenedorum Nationeare Populi Venedicti are Wends are Serbs:\n\nDisputatio Historicade Serbis, Venedorum NationeVul g oDi ctiDi e Wenden.\n\nVANDALS, VANDALIA\n\nAs the following series indicates, medieval sources sometimes refer to Germania's\n\nSlavs and neighboring Slavs asV andals/Wandals, their lands,Van d ali a/Wan d ali a:1)\n\nAb Oriente Wandalorum gens ferocissima habitat; 2) Contra Wandelicos auxiliantibus; 3) De Sclavia. Sclavia estpars Mesia, multas continens regiones. Nam Sclavi sunt Bohemi, Poloni, Metani, Vandali, Rutheni;4) In Wandalos; 5) In regionem Wandalorum; 6) Inter Saxoniam et Vandaliam estAlbus. Estautem Vandalia terra, cujus gentes Slavi dicuntur;7 ) L ingua Rutenorum et Polonorum et Boemorum et Sclavanorum eadem est cum lingua Wandalorum; 8) Sclavorum in regionem Wandalorum; 9) Wandalos, quos nunc appellant Guenedos. The notion that at one\n\ntime Germania's Slavs orWi n uli were calledVan d al s has deep roots in early German\n\nsources. In the late 11th century Adam of Bremen writes: Sclavania igitur, amplissima\n\nGermaniaeprovintia, a Winulis incolitur, qui olim diet sunt Wandali.One century\n\nlater, Adam's successor, Helmold, writes: Where Poland ends one comes into a most\n\nextensive Slavic province, that of the people who of old were called Vandali, but\n\nnowWinithi or Winuli.Regarding the identity and location of the Winuthior: Winuli,\n\nHelmold writes: The other river, the Oder, tending toward the north, passes through\n\nthe territory of the Winuli peoples, dividing the Pomeranians from the Wilzi. At its mouth, where its watersswel l those of the Baltic Sea, there one stood Jumen\n\n[Wolin]... Then, beyond the sluggish current of the Oder and the territory peopled\n\nby several Pomeranian tribes, there lies toward the west the country of the Winuli,\n\nof those namely, who are called Tholenzi and Redarii.\n\nWANDALO PATRE POLONORUM\n\nIn medieval Polish sources one finds the notion thatWan d al s take their name fromWan d al us, the father, progenitor of the Polish nation, of the Polish or Lechtic nation: Necno autem quatuor filios genuit, cuius primogenitus Wandalus, a quo\n\nWandalitae, qui Poloni nunc dicuntur,orti sunt. Hie ex nomine suo fluvium, qui nunc Wysla vulgariter nuncupatur, Wandalum censuit appellari, nam et mons, de quo oritur dictusfluvius Wanda ab eiusdem nomine vocitatur; Ipsa denique Wanda a. Wandalo, WandalorumidestPolonorumsiveL echitarumprogenitoe, de quo supra diximus nomen accepit; velpotest did Wanda a Wandalo scilicetflumine Wisla eo, quodeius regni centrum extiterit. The same sources trace the origin of all Slavic nations\n\nto the sons ofWan d al us: H abui t [Wan d al us] quo que m ul t o sfi l i o s, qui g en erat i o n i bus\n\nsuis ultra quartampartem Europaeper regiones et regna semen suum multiplicando possederunt, videlicet: totalRussiam adorientem, Poloniam maximam terrarum et matrem, Pomeraniam, Seleuciam, Cassubiam, Sarbiam quae nunc Saxonia dicitur, Bohemiam, Moraviam, Stiriam, Carinthiam et Sclavoniam: quae nunc Dalmacia dicitur; Chrowatiam, Pannoniam, quae nunc Ungaria dicitur, Bulgariam et alias quamplures, quarum multitudepropterprolixitatem subticetur.\n\nALBERT KRANZ\n\nAn early authority on Saxony, A. Kranz (1450-1517), author of two important\n\nhistorical treatises,V andalia (1519) andS ax onia (1520), is certain thatVan d al sare Wen d s\n\nareSlav s who are divided into many nations, Poles, Bohemians and many others. A\n\ndecade later one finds the same notion in D. Chytraei'sV andalia (1591). Kranz, Chytraei and other scholars know that the originalVan d al s were a Germanic nation, who first appear in 406 when they crossed the Rhine, invaded Gaul and Spain, established a kingom in North Africa, and sacked Rome in 455. They believe that at some early point in time Slavic peoples settled alongside the GermanicVan d al s, and that later, after the latter had departed, the Slavs occupied their lands and came to be known asVan d al s.\n\nGERMAN-SLAVVANDALS\n\nCarrying thelongtim e G erm an- S lav neighb ors and f riends notion several steps for- ward, some German writers believe that the Slavic Vandals or: Wends represent the union of\\f o n d a lo \\d n m ers left behind and Slavic newcomers in former Vandal lands. On this point, M.B. Latimi writes: Als haben sich die Witzer Wuder and andere Slaven aus\n\nSarmatien Wandalen so heuffig in diese Lender und Stette gemachlich\n\neingedrungen, und mit dem Wandalen vereinbaret und befreudent, dass darüber\n\ndie alte Teutsche Sprache corrumpiret, und die Wendische Zunge mit eingwurzeit,\n\nvermischetundgemein'worden i s(Wiasmariensis megapolitani genealochronicon,16 10 ).\n\nEINWENDE\n\nIn a less speculative spirit a German historian writes in 1508 that Sarmatians,\n\nVandals and Slavs are Wends:Sarmatha et Vandalus et Sclavus =ein W ende. Accord\n\ning to another historian of the same period, Slav is a popular name for Vandal: Vandali,\n\nquos vulgus Sclavos appelant. One finds the same notion in the title of an article by a\n\nGerman authority on the subject in the early 20th century:Wandalen = Wenden( L\n\nSteinberger, Wandalen = Wenden, AnP 37, 1915).\n\nWEND/VANDAL AUS SCYTIA\n\nIn the mid-16th century, N. Volrab, a native of Budusin, informs his readers that\n\ntheWen d s, who originated inS c y thia(di e Wen d aus Scy t i a) are also known asVan d al s\n\nandSlavs(Chronica von denA n tiq u ite te ndes KeiserlichenStrifiesd e r Romische Burgu n dS tadt Marseburg, 1556). In\n\nthe same period one of Basel's leading scholars, S. Munster (1448-1552), says the same\n\nthingind i ffe r e n t words:Vandalen wo manjetztW endennennt(Cosmographia Universaüs).\n\nVANDALS, VENEDS, SARMATS, SCYTHS\n\nRegarding the conquest and settlement of Germania, C.S. Schurzfleisch writes:\n\nVandalis Venedi, Venedis Sarmatae, Germanis Schythae successerunt... Invadunt\n\nVandalontmdi ti o n esVen ed i( O riginesPom eranic ae,16 7 3 ).\n\nVANDALOS SORABORUM NOMEN\n\nAccording to an early 17th century history of Meissen, theVan d al s who founded\n\nMeissen wereS erbs, actuallyS o rabs, a name derived fromS erb as in Ptolemy'sSarm at i an\n\nSerbs: Vandalos peculiare Soraborum nomen habuisse... cuius derivatio a Serbis...\n\nquorum Ptolemaeusm em i n i tsub sarmaticis populisi nA si a( R .R einerius,DeM isenom m\n\norigine, rebus, gestis, mutationibus, variis dominatibus, etadventuin Germanium).\n\nNUMEROUS, POWERFUL\n\nThe Vandals are prominent in M. Orbini's 1602 account of the origin of the Slavs. TheVan d al s, Orbini writes, were one of the more numerous and powerful Slav nations, who occupied a great area from the Baltic in the north to the Mediterranean in the south. According to Orbini, the Moscovites, Russians, Poles, Bohemians, Dalma- tians, Istrians, Croats and Rasians are some of the modern nations descended from the\n\nVandals.\n\nLEXICON VANDALICUM\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries it is not uncommon for German Serb scholars to\n\nrefer to the Serbs as Vandals in the title and text of studies, lexicons, and grammars:\n\nDidascalia seu Orthographia Vandalica; Enchiridion Vandalicum; Lexicon\n\nVandalicum; L inguae Vandalicae addialectum districtus Cotbusiani; Orthographia Vandalica; Principia linguae wendicae quant aliqui wandalicum vacant; Rudimenta Grammaticae Sorabo-Vandalicae Idiomatis Budissinatis; Versio VandalicaPraestandi homagiißdelitatio. Thus the full nameotS oc ietatisJ ab lanoviaae, a Leipzig based asso-\n\nciation promoting scholarly research and publication of Slavic studies, originating in the\n\n18th century, included the following ethnonymic elements: Acta Societatisjablanoviaae\n\ndeSlavis Venedis, Antis, Vilzis, Sorabis aliquid de Vandalis et Henetis. 8. QUOD TANTUM EST REGNUM\n\nT\n\nhroughout history, from the medieval to the modern, historians origi- nating in diverse geographical-national circumstances, in diverse intel- lectual-cultural traditions and perspectives, acting on the basis of similar and dif-\n\nferent sources, some known, some unknown, have reached the same or similar conclu-\n\nsions, namely that the Serbs are an ancient people, the ancestors of all or most Slavic\n\npeoples.\n\nQUOD TANTUM EST REGNUM\n\nAccording to an important 9th century source, the Bavarian Geographer'sD e sc rip -\n\ntio Civitatum ad Septentrionalem( h e r e a f t e r Descriptio Civitatum), all Slavs originate in\n\nthe immense lands of a great Serb dominion:Zeriuani, quod tantum est regnum, ut\n\nex eo cunctae gentes Sclavorum exortae sint et originem, sicut affirmant, ducant.\n\n(A realm so great that from it, as their tradition relates, all the nations of the Slavs are\n\nsprung and trace their origin).\n\nTOTIUS ORBIA ANTIQUISSIMAM EX MAXIMAM\n\nSome six centuries later one finds the same notion in another important and\n\nauthoritative source, namely Laonicus Chalcondyles' mid-15th century magnum opus,\n\nHistoriarum Demonstrations. A cautious, solid and reliable historian, Chalcondyles is\n\ncertain that the Serbs are the one of the greatest nations in the whole world in terms of\n\nage and number:Serblos autemgentem esse totius orbis antiquissimam et maximam,\n\ncompertum habeo.\n\nSERBICA\n\nCertain Serb facts on the ground in the length and breadth of Greece itself were perhaps a factor in a Byzantine Greek historian's estimation of the age and size of the Serb nation. According to Byzantine sources, a Serb principality was established in Thessaly, centered atS erbi en , not far from Mount Olympus, in the 7th century. Diverse sources\n\ndocument aS erbi aor S erbi en , a settlement and stronghold of immense strategic import\n\nnear the gorge that interrupts the mountain wall of Vermion and Olympus, through which the Bistrica River fights its way to the Aegean Coast. Later medieval Greek sources describeS erbi a as a well-fortified polis divided into three sections, the akra, where the archon lived, and the uppera n d lower sections inhabited by the politia( N.Z upanic ,T heS erb\n\nSettlement in the Macedonian Town ofSrbiste in the Vllth century and the Ethnological and Sociological Moment in the Report ofConstantinus Porphyrogenitus concerning the Advent of Serbs and Croats, Etnolog 1,1926-27; P Skok, Konstantinova. Serbia u Grckoj, Glas SkA CLX X X I, 1938; B. Ferjancic, Vizantijski isrpski Ser u X IVstolecu, 1994).\n\nSIRBANOS\n\nA 1454-55 Ottoman document records a number of Christian timar holders\n\nwith Serb-sounding names in Thessaly: Dobros, Miroslavis, Bogdanos, Bogranos,\n\nSirbanos, Rados (N.Belcideanu, Timariotes chretiens inT hessalie, SuD 42,198 3 ).A n o t h e rOt t o m a n\n\ndocument of the same period reveals a royal Serb presence in the person of Mara Brankovic,\n\ndaughter of Serbian Despot Djurach Brankovic, widow of Sultan Murad II, and step-\n\nmother of Sultan Mehmed II. This source indicates that she was granted extensive own-\n\nership of lands in the area of Serres, including two villages with Serb sounding names,\n\nJezovoandMravi nci /Muravni ca,situated southof Lake Takhinos( B .F erjandc ,T esalija uX IIl\n\niX IVveku,19 7 4).LaterOt t o m a n documents indicate that Mara granted both villages to the\n\nmonasteries of Hilandar and St. Paul on Mount Athos in 1466. Excavationsin Jezovo,\n\nnow Daphni, have uncovered architectural remains associated with Mara, including a\n\nStructurek n o w n as theT ow er ofM a ra( M .U rsinius.A nO ttom anCensusR egister for theA reaof S em s,S uD\n\n45, 1986).\n\nTHRACE, EPIRUS\n\nTheS erb ethnikon is also found near Kirk Kilise in Turkish Thrace; near Trikalla\n\nin the Trikalla-Karditsa district of Greek Thrace, where the distinguished German histo- rian,M. Vasmer, found122 Slav placenam es(Die Slavenin Griechenland,19 4l). Also near Yanina in the district of Epirus where Vasmer found no less than 334 Slav place names. Also on the rugged Chalcidic Peninsula, on the middle prongof L ongos (derived from a Slav word forw o o d la n d ), near the isthmus ofP ro v la k o s (a slightly Graecized word for\n\nisthmus).In fact, a 10th century document from this area, a testimonial signed by several\n\nSlav witnesses,is considered to be the oldest datedg la g o lith ic monument( G.S oulis, O nthe\n\nSlavic Settlement in Hierissos in the Tenth Century, Byzantion 23, 1953).\n\nSERBISTA, ZERVOKHORIA\n\nIn W.M. Leake's late 18th century account of his travels in northern Greece, one finds a number ofS erb - Z erv place names:Z ervo kh ia , one of two rivers ofMt. Pelium; the villageso f S ervu la , near Vostitza;S erp , alsoS erb ista , near Serres;Zerv o kho ri , near Negrita. On the territory of the Khimara ('the whole of the ancient Acroceraunian ridge ... the towns of Nivitza, Lukovo, Pikernes'),S erb appears in the name and ancestry of\n\none one of the leading clans, theZerv at i , who take their name from Zerva, a village\n\nof the district of Arta. There were three brothers of that village, one of whom\n\nturned Turk; another settled at Lefka at Corfu, where there is now a family of\n\nZervates;the third migratedto Suli( W.M .L eake, T ravelsinNorthern Greec e,19 6 7 ).\n\nPELOPONNESUS\n\nTheS erb ethnikon is found in greatest numbers in the Peloponnesus. In the\n\ndistrict of Argolis, near the isthmus of Corinth, a neck of land connecting the Peloponnesus to the rest of Greece; in the district of Ellis on the west coast of the Peloponnesus. Near Herata, in central Arcadia, an area rich in Slav place names; near Tryphylia in the south- western district of Messenia. At several places in the rugged southeastern district of Laconia (Sparta), an area that includes the Mani and the high and rugged Taygetos range (D.J.\n\nGeorgacas, The Medieval Names Melingi and Ezeritae of Slavic Groups in the Peloponnesus, Bz T 43, 1950). In his\n\nstudy of Slavic names in Messenian Mani, P. Malingoudis identifies a numbero f S erb -\n\nsounding toponyms common to both Germaniana n d Illyrian Serb lands, including,\n\namong others: Bolesin, Cernov, Devica, Dubrava, Godine, Golina, Gora, Gostim,\n\nKamenik, Laz, Les, Ljuta, Luka, Malotin, Mokrina, Nizina, Okci, Ostrovo, Plavina,\n\nPolica,P rosek,Radesin,Raztok,Rov,Senovica,Slavota, Vrba,Zadel( P.M alingoudis,\n\nStudien zu den slavischen Ortsnamen Griechenlands, 1981).\n\nSTRATEGIC LOCATIONS\n\nIt is interesting and perhaps significant that a number of better-known Serb settle-\n\nments in Graecia were established at highly strategic points: near Mt. Olympus; thChalcidic Peninsula; the isthmus of Corinth; near Mt. Taygetus in Laconia-Sparta. Ac- cording to Zupanic, this was certainly true of the Serb settlement near Mt. Olympus. Impressed with the obvious military character of Serb settlement, he writes:It seems to\n\nme that the first Srbisce must have a warrior camp. The Serbs came south as an\n\norganized army ... The settlement of Srbsice suggests that it served as a military\n\nbase and as an organizing point for newcomers.\n\nANCIENT GRAECIA\n\nThere is some evidence that Slav settlement can be traced as far back as the begin-\n\nnings of ancient Greece. No less an authority than Toynbee notes that some geographical\n\nnames of that period have a distinctly Slavonic filter. Indeed, he suspects thatthe\n\nancient Paiones may actually have been a Slavonic speaking people.Regarding the\n\ntime of Slavic settlement, Toynbee writes:Slavs were probably part of the Thracian\n\nand Illyrian Volkerwanderung into southeastern Europe from 1,700 to 1,800 years\n\nbefore the massive Volkerwanderung of the Slavs in the 6th and 7th centuries of the\n\nChristian era. In the year 581, John of Ephesis gives the following account of the\n\nmassive Slav Volkerwanderung in the late 6th century: An accursed people called\n\nSlavonians overran the whole of Greece ... captured the cities and overran nu-\n\nmerous strongholds . . . reduced the people to slavery, made themselves the mas-\n\nters of the whole and settled in it by means of force and dwelt in it as though it\n\nhad been their own . . . The Slavonians live at ease in the lands and dwell in it as far\n\nand wide as God permits them.Four years later, he writes: they [Slavonians] live in\n\npeace in the Roman territories, free from anxiety and fear . . . And they have grown\n\nrich in gold and silver and herds of horses and arms, and have learned to fight\n\nbetter than the Romans.'\n\nENDNOTES\n\nM. Vasmer, Die Slaven in Grieschenland, 1941. P.

WHITE SERBS\n\nI\n\nn terms of conventional sources, there is no record of proto-Polish civilization, of Poland's social and political foundations, in the centuries prior to the formation of the medieval Polish state in the 10th century. Poland enters the historical record in\n\nthe mid-10th century with several very brief references to King Mieszko (963-992).\n\nOne toKing Misaca, under whose rule the Slavs were living, a second to Mieszko,\n\nking of the north.\n\nONOMASTIC EVIDENCE\n\nNonetheless there is overwhelming onomastic evidence that the Serbs occupied\n\nmuch of the territory of prehistoric Poland and played a seminal role in the early stages\n\nof Corona Regnum Poloniae.\n\nBIALI SERBOWIE\n\nIn a mid-20th century study, the distinguished Polish historian, T. Lewicki iden-\n\ntifies numerous place names with the Serb ethnikon in core and perimeter Polish lands\n\n(T.L ewic ki,K onstantegoP of irogenety iB iali Serbowe wpolnocnjeP olsc e,R oH 22,1956).W hatism o sts i g n i f i -\n\ncant is the fact that the greatest concentrations of the more than thirty-six ethnonymic Serb place names cited are found in the geographic center of the proto-Polish nation.1 More precisely, place names at and near Gniezno, the center ofVi el ko po l ska or Great Poland, and Poznan, the first capitals of the Polish state and the seats of the first Polish metropolis and bishopric. An Old Slavic word,gniez no connotes nest, cradle, heart, core, nucleus. Recent evidence of Gniezno's primacy in Poland's historical-national con- sciousness is found in the words of Pope John Paul at Gniezno in 1979: Here I greet\n\nwith veneration the nest of the Piast, the origin of the history of the motherland.\n\nORIGIN OF THE MOTHERLAND\n\nIn this historic area, bound by the Warta river in the west, the Notec river in the north, and Lake Goplo in the east, with large fortifications at Kurswica, Gniezno, and Poznan, and smaller fortifications at Klecko, Ostros, Lednicki, Giez, Lad, and Trzemesno, in thisnest of the Piast, this origin of the history of the motherland, one finds a great number of ethnonymic Serbs. In fact, in this area Serb place names are found in greater number than anywhere at anytime in Europe.\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbin\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbina\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbino\n\nSarbia\n\nSarbice\n\nSarbino\n\nSarbicko\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbka\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbka\n\nSarbinovo\n\nSarbskie Huby\n\nSarbinovka\n\nMALOPOLSKA\n\nThe Serbs also appear to be the dominant Slavic element in a secondary center of Polish nationhood. Professor Lewicki finds a concentration of politically strategic Serb place names inM alopolska or Little Poland. In the lands of the ancientV islanie, from the river Vis, Visla, Vistula, centered at Vislica, one of the oldest Polish cities, the seat of legendary Prince Vislav, one finds Szarbia, Szarbia, andSzarbkov. North of Vislica, between the ancient towns of Malogoszcz and Sandomierz, one findsSarbin\n\nand Szarbsko.\n\nMAZOVIA\n\nEast ofVi el ko po l ska, the Serb ethnikon is well represented in the former Duchy of Mazovia (united with Poland in 1526) where one finds the Serb ethnikon in both place names and surnames. North ofSzarb, for example,Sarbievo is the birthplace of the great poet and classicist Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595-1649).\n\nPOMERANIA\n\nIn language, culture, and geography Pomerania was an integral part of Baltic Slavic civilization west of the Oder River. In government and politics it had strong ties with the powerfulV eletian/L utic ian federation. The same factors that tied the western Pomeranians to the Baltic Slavs separated them from the Polish Slavs. Centered on maritime city-states, the seafaring Pomeranians were far more advanced in industry, trade, commerce, and culture. Some German historians are certain that Pomerania is an original and integral Serb land.2 One historian refers toPomerania as a primary\n\nSorbenland or Surpe-Sorbenland. Another German historian writes that the entire\n\nBaltic coast to the Vistula, with the interior, was settled by Serb-Wends. Here too,\n\nof course, evidence of Serb occupation and settlement is found in such place names as\n\nSarbia, Sarbinovo, and Sarbsko.Some measure of the importance and intensity of\n\nseafaring trade in Pomerania is found in the fact that in the early 12th century Bishop Otto's missionary activities were sometimes thwarted by the fact that in one town after another, the natives were more at sea than at home:Thence we came to Colobrega,\n\nwhich is situated, on the border of the sea. As nearly all its citizens were sailors\n\nafter the manner of traders to the outer islands to do business, those who were\n\nfound at home said that they could not adopt no new course in the absence of their\n\nfellow-citizens, and on this ground they withstood the preaching of the gospel for\n\nsome time( C.H .R ob inson,T heL if e ofO ttoA postle ofPom erania 10 6 0 - 113 9 ,19 2 0 ).\n\nCONVERSION\n\nIn fact, fear of their rivals in the northwest, theV eletian- Pom eranian alliance,\n\nmay have changed thecourse of Polish history( Z .Wojtiehowsk,Poczatki ChrzesäjanstwawPolsc e na\n\ntie Stosunkov Niemiecko-Wieeckich, Zyde aM y sli3 /4,19 5 0 ).It appears that severed e fe a ts at the\n\nhands of Veletian-Pomeranian forces in 963forced Mieszko to look for help against\n\nthe warlike pagans,convert to Christianity, and seek the assistance of Christian Bohemia\n\nand other members ofChristiana respub lic a. Later, thec rusading im pulse that followed conversion will change the course of Polish history in another important way. Christian sources record and celebrate Duke Boleslav's III attacks on Pomerania in 1121 whenhe\n\nravaged the country west of the River Oder with fire and sword and announced his\n\nintention of converting all the inhabitants to the Christian faith, or of destroying\n\nthem, in the event of their refusing to be converted.Polish knights will also take an\n\nactive role in serial crusades against pagans in Prussia and Lithuania. To their credit, however, Polish authorities were the first or among the first (e.g. the indictment of the Teutonic Order by Paul Vladimir, a Polish ambassador at the church council in 1415) to rebel against the plunder and slaughter of innocent and peaceful unbelievers who refused to bow to the Holy Roman Empire, to accept Papal servitude.\n\nZIEMIA KASZUBSKA\n\nIn Eastern Pomerania, theKaszubs(gens Slavonica, Caussbitae dicuntur) of\n\nZiemia Kaszubska, a distinct historic, linguistic, and cultural Pomeranian entity, one\n\nfindstraces of a Serb past in thePolishp resen t(H .K unstm ann,Woherdie Kaschube ihrenNam en\n\nhaben,DwS 2 9 ,19 8 4).In a region calledK aszubowSlowi nski ch, one finds a modern town\n\nand lake with the Serb ethnonym, namelySarbske and Sarbske jezero, immediately\n\nwestof the better-known townand lakeof Lebaand Lebsko( ET etz ner, DieS low inz en und\n\nLebaskashcuben, 1899. L. Zablocki, O Slotvincach i Kaszubach nadlebskich, Jantar 3, 1947).\n\nSILESIAIn early German sources one finds reference to Serbs in Silesia:Sirvi, welch in\n\nSchlesien wohneten.Early and later German sources often identify Silesia as an im-\n\nportant junction in the Serb settlementof Serbska Luzi ca or Lusatia. There is evidence\n\nof Serb settlement in several place- names (e.g. Sarbino, Serby) and a Serb province or\n\nSurbiensispro v i n ci acited in themid-1 0thc e n tu ry Silesian Annals(Annales Silesiae). It is\n\ninteresting that in this area theSilesian Annals also record a stubborn resistance to the\n\nLatin rite and the defiant use of theS lav- H eneti language in church services:Slav i cae\n\nsen henetae linguae usum ...in sacris eccleaisasticis... inibuitac latin lingua concipi\n\nliturgiamprecesaquejussit.Several mountains in Silesia, Mts. Sobotka and Radunia,\n\nwere longn o to rio u s centers of pagan rituals. Referring to Mt. Sobotka, Bishop Thietmar\n\nwrites in the early 11th century:It was the object of great veneration on the part of all\n\nthe people because of its size and purpose, for iniquitous mysteries were celebrated\n\nthere. The following century finds Sileisia's Bishop of Wroclaw engaged in search-and-\n\ndestroy missions against pagan cult centers where wooden images of old gods were kept.\n\nIn the 19th century the pagan past was alive and well in such folk sayings as the one cited\n\nby J.K ollar:Kto nanasuSobot kuneprigdze; roroka hoglavabolecbudze(H .Cehak-\n\nHolubowicza, Olimp Slaska in Szkice z dziejow Slaska, 1955; Kamienne konstrukcje kultowe pod szczytem napolnocnym\n\nsotku gory Slez, Swiatowit 23, 1960).\n\nENDNOTES\n\nS.

It is a matter of record that the Serb ethnonym was as common east of the Oder as it was in theWhite Serb heartland west of the\n\nOder. East of the Oder,1 oppositeSerbska Biota (Serb Marsh) and Serbska Hola (Serb\n\nHeath) inSerbska Luzica (Serb Lusatia), one finds the place namesZorbenov,\n\nSarbinovo, Serbovand Sarby.\n\nBORDERS\n\nIn his 10th century magnum opus, al-Masvudi writes: the Bobr, Elbe and Saale rivers mark the borders ofWhite Serbia (Muruj ahd-dhahab wa ma'adin aljawahir). One of the more authoritative modern studies, J. Marquart's outlinesWhite Serbia's borders in similar terms: from the Bobr in the east, across the Elbe, to the Saale in the west( O steuropaisc heS treiß uege,19 0 3 ). At its height, most historianste n dto placeWhi t e Serbi a's eastern borders deeper into later Polish territory. Gebhardt, for example, places Silesia and western Poland up to the Vistula withinWhite Serbia's 8th century borders(L. A.\n\nGebhardt, Geschichte aller Wendische-SlawischenS taaten,17 9 0 ).InH erkunf tderB altisc henWenden( 18 7 2 )\n\nQuandt extendsWhite Serbia's borders in the east to includeWhite Serb concentra- tions at Opole, Poznan, Kaliscz and Gniezno.2 Noting the location of theSurpe Serbs recorded by Alfred the Great (871-899), Quandt is certain that the Serbs of Germania,\n\nVielkopolska and Opole/Silesia are one people:The Surpe are one and the same as\n\nthe Opolini and the people who live in Poznan, Kaliscz and Gniezno. It is interest-\n\ning and should be noted that in recent time, viewing the facts of the matter from an entirely different perspective, H. Kunstmann traces Opolin and Polin to Balkan Slav roots (Wer waren die Opolini des Geographus Bavarus Bavarus, und woher kommt das\n\nEthnonym Polonia? ).\n\nTO THE BUG\n\nSafarik and other noted Slavists are certain that at one timeWhite Serbia's borders reached the Bug and beyond. Some scholars are certain that the ancientBuz han i were originally Serbs. For example, the noted historian G. Krek writes:In ancient\n\ntimes on the Bug were the Buzhani, a Slavic tribe, who were once called Serbs. A\n\nlarge and powerful tribe comprising some 231c ities in the mid-9th century( B usani\n\nhabentc ivitatesCCX X X I),occupyingth e borderlands separating Poland fromW h ite\n\nRus, Red Rus and Kiev Rus, theBuz han i ('buzhane, zane sedosha po Bugu'), later, the\n\nVolyni or Volynians ('poslezhe zhe velynane') occupied a large stretch of the river Bug.\n\nOnBuz hi an territory, on the west bank of the Bug, was a region known asCz erv i a. Authoritative German and Polish historians, J. Marquart and J. Otrebski among oth- ers, suspect that theCz erv s ofCz erv i a wereS erbs. The well-known cities ofCz erv i a\n\n('ziemia Grodov Czervienskich'), centered at Czervien, included Czervien, near Czermno\n\non the Huczwa, and the historic cities of Chelm and Volyn. It is perhaps interesting and coincidental that one of the lesser-known cities had the highly uncommon name of Sutieska or Sutjeska as in Sutjeska on the border of Bosnia and Montenegro.\n\nBOIKI\n\nEvidence in favor of this general area as an ancient Serb homeland and point of departure for Serbs moving westwards is found in a primary Byzantine source, namely Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus sDe A dm inistrando Im perio. Regarding the ori- gin of the Balkan Serbs, where the Serbs originally dwelt, Constantine writes:The Serbs\n\nare descended from the unbaptized Serbs, also calledWhi t e, who lived beyond\n\nTurkey [Hungary] in a place called by them Boiki, where the neighbor is Francia\n\n(N. Zupanic, Bela Srbija, Narodna starina 1, 1922).\n\nG ALICIA\n\nNoting that Byzantine sources are often in error in matters beyond their imme- diate scope in time and space, some of the early Slav specialists, Safarik, Surowiecki, and other outstanding scholars, including the great Czech scholar Dobrovsky and the Croat F. Racki, are certain that Constantine's statement is in error regarding the loca- tion ofBo i ki . They believe that Constantine confused thederivative Serbs of Bohe- mianBo i ki with theoriginal Serbs of GalicianBo i ki ,the Bo i ki district of eastern Galicia, a territory believed to be an ancient and direct link between the Eastern and Southern Slavs.\n\nBOIKI HIGHLANDERS\n\nIn modern timesBo i ki refers to a distinct Slavic community, Ukrainian high- landers who differ from their Slavic neighbors (e.g. Lemkos/Rusnaks, Hutsuls) in lan- guage, dress, architecture, and customs, and who have preserved many ancient customs and rituals that disappeared in other parts of Galicia and Ukraine. TheBo i ki region includes the High Beskid, the eastern part of the Middle Beskid, the Middle Carpathians, and the Carpathian Depression. In this area one finds the small towns of Borinia, Borislav, Dolina, Drogobich, Medenica, Nizhni Vorota, Stari Sambor, Stri, and Volove.\n\nDUKLAIt is interesting and perhaps coincidental that in the Eastern Beskids, in the\n\nLemko region, theBo i ki border an area with the uncommon nameo fDukl a, centered\n\nnear the towno fDukl a, just north of the strategic Dukla Pass on the Polish-Czecho-\n\nslovak border.Dukl aor Dukl j a, of course, is also the highly uncommon name of a\n\nSerb nation that gave its name to the first Serb state, theD ukl j an i of medievalD ukl j a\n\n(J. Udolph, Zu Deutung und Verbreitung des Namens Dukla, BnF 23, 1988; H. Kunstmann, Der Dukla-Name und\n\nsein Weg von Montenegro über die Karpaten nach Nordwestrussland, DwS 33, 1988).\n\nENDNOTES\n\nIn addition to the several Serb dialects spoken east of the Oder, there are other interesting linguistic continuities (e.g. M. Gruchmanova, Luzycko-Wielkopolska Izomorfa Norn.- Acc.-Voc. PI. Dny, Z Polskich Studiow Slawistycznych 5, 1978.\n\nOpole refers to the early medieval Duchy of Opole in Silesia, centered at Opole on the Oder River, said to have twenty cities in the mid-9'1' century(Opolini, civitates X X ). The name Opol is is Slavic word for a territorial community. Today Opol is the name of a city and county in southwestern Poland. W. Holubowicz, Opolu w wiekach X-XII, 1956. H. Borek, Opolszyzna w swietle nazw miejscowych, 1972.\n\n3. FROM THE UNBAPTIZED SERBS\n\nWHO DWELL ON THE RIVER VISLA\n\nI\n\nmpressive evidence that some of the Balkan Serbs originated in Poland is found inDe Administrando Imperio. In his treatise, Emperor Constantine Pophyrogenitus informs us that inZahumlja, a principality in coastal Serbia:The\n\nfamily of the patrician Mihailo Visevich, son of Viseta, prince of the Zahumlyans,\n\ncame from the unbaptized Serbs who dwell on the river Visla and are called Litziki.\n\nLITZIKIMost historians tend to agree with 319th century Polish historiography that the\n\nnameL itz iki is derived fromlug, an Old Slav word for moor, marshland, pasture, woodland, and wasteland. Thus Lugizi, Ligizi, Litziki and other variations are parallel archaic names for theP olanie, a name derived from an Old Slav word with similar connotations. According to L. Niederle, however, it is more likely thatL itz iki is a ge- neric name for Poles, derived from one of the better known and westernmost Polish tribes/nations, theL ic ic aviki as in:Sclav i qui di cun tur L i ci cav i kiand lo n g i us deg en tes\n\nbarbari...L i ci cav i ki , bordering with Serb lands westof theOd e r( J . Widajewicz, Licicaviki\n\nWidukina, SIO 6, 1927. G. Labuda, Licicaviki, SsS 3, 1967).\n\nVIS, VISLA, VISEVIC, VISEVO\n\nThe patronymicVisevich certainly suggests aV is/V isla/V islani origin for the house of Visevich. In several place names in medievalZahumlja one finds toponymic evidence in favor of a Vislanian origin of other Serb lineages: e.g.V isevaz upa or county;\n\nViseva, a local name for the upper Neretva( T . Wasilewski, Administraja bizantynska naz iem iac h\n\nskwianskich i jej polityka wobec Slowian w XI-XII w, KwA 70, 1973; Wislanska dynastia ijej zachlumskie panstwo w\n\nIX-Xw,PaM 15, 1965).\n\nCIVITATES OMNES ROMANOOS\n\nAnti-Byzantine and pro-Bulgarian in orientation, a close ally of the very learned and powerul ruler of Bulgaria and champion of Slavdom, Tsar Simeon (893-927), seated at Preslav,Mi hai lo Visevich was a force in affairs beyond the borders of Zahumlja: In\n\nthe year 925 Pope John X invites Mihailo (Michaele exellentissimo duce\n\nChulmorum), along with Tomislav of Croatia, to take part in the resolution of\n\nchurch affairs in Croatia-Dalmatia.\n\nAn inscription found at Ston suggests thatMi hai lo considered himself the su-\n\npreme authority in the affairs of Byzantine towns along the Dalmatian coast:\n\nMIHAELVS FORTITER SVPER REGO PACIFICO\n\nCIVITATES OMNES ROMANOOS.\n\nREX SCLAVORUM CIVITATEM SIPONTUM\n\nMihailo was also a force to be reckoned with on the opposite shore of the Adriatic,\n\non the Apulian spur of the Italian boot. Crossing the Adriatic, in 926Mihailo con- quered Byzantine Siponto, opening the way for greater Serb settlement in the Gargano peninsula.Comprendit Michael rex Sclavorum civitatem Sipontum.\n\nSERBS CONTRA SERBS\n\nDecade's later Serb settlements in southern Italy will lead toS erbs originating\n\nin Illyria by way of Poland(?), fighting against invadingS erbs originating in Germania's\n\nWhite Serbia. In the year 981, Serb forces recruited in southeastern Italy, reinforced\n\nby some 40,000S erb mercenaries under the commandof Vukasin(4 0 ,0 0 0 pag an i\n\ncondotti dalloro reBuUicassinus), take an active role in the defense of Calabria against\n\nthe forces of Emperor Otto of Germany, includingS erb forces from Germania'sWhi t e\n\nSerbiaand Serb knights serving in Otto's personal bodyguard.\n\nZUPAN GLUBISA\n\nIt appears that in some instances the Serbs survived as an independent national-\n\npolitical community as late as the mid-11th century: When Serb zupans (e.g. zupan\n\nAndreas, zupan Glubisa) are found at the head of a number of communities in the\n\nGargano area (e.g. Devia, Varano) where natives with Serb personal names are re-\n\ncorded (e.g. Drago, Radovit).In this general area one finds numerous references to\n\nSlavic settlements in family names (e.g. Scavone, Schiavone, Cito, Pribo, Pissichio,\n\nStano), in village names (e.g. Castellucium de Slavis, L esin, Peschici, Schiavt),a n d\n\ntoponyms (e.g.rione degli Schiavonia, Monte Schiavoni, Ponte degli Schiavoni,\n\nSchiauni, Ponte Schiavo, Piano Schiavt).^\n\nSRBLYI, POLES\n\nOne moment in the second half of the 14th century makes it very clear that the Bosnian Serbs believed that the Serbs and Poles were one people, who, sharing a com- mon ancestry, had an obligation to assist one another in times of trouble, in this in- stance, the Turkish threat.\n\nKRAL SERBLEM\n\nIn 1440, Stevan Tvrtko II (1440-43), King of Bosnia and all the Serbs\n\n(MILOSTYU BOZHNOM MI GOSPODIN KRAL SERBLEM) asserting a common\n\nancestry, language and interest, sought assistance from the newly elected Slavic king of\n\nHungary, the Pole Vladislav Varnecik (1440-1444).\n\nISTI PRADJEDOVI\n\nThe letter and spirit of this earlyP an- S lav moment are a matter of historical record. Contemporaneous Hungarian sources offer a clear statement of the thesis ad- vanced by Stevan Tvrkto's emissaries to Vladislav's court at Budim, namely the com- mon ancestry of the Poles and Serbs(Srbly i ). A Croat translation of the Latin original reads as followsodje i od kralja bosanskoga sjajne poslanstvo odlicnih muzeva.\n\nOvi su izpricavsi porietlo svoga plemena izticali, da su Bosnjakom isti pradjedovi bili, koji i Poljakom, te da im je zajednicki jezik, koji govore; i da se radi te rek bi srodnosti jezika i porietla njihov kralj zivo raduje, sto je Vladislav—kako se pronio\n\nglas—sretan u svojih podhvatih. Mongo su nadalje izticali priliku, kako bi se radi\n\nsrodnosti i susjedstva mogli, dapace i morali ujedinjenom snagom i savjetom medju\n\nsobom pomagati proti uzasnomu zulumu turskomu, koji im prieti. Osim toga\n\nzatrazise, da se ugovor i prijateljstvo, koje su svi dotadanji kraljevi najvecom svetoscu\n\npostivali i cuvali, medju Bosnom i Ugarskom ili sklopi ili obnovi. Poslanikom bi\n\nmilostivo odgovoreno: da je pravo, sto se uspjeh i i napredak Vladislavov njihovu kralju svidja, toll radi onoga srodstva jezika i porietla, koje spominju, koli radi\n\ntoga, sto je jednim i drugim malo ne jednako do toga, da se sto prije sva Ugarska umiri te krjepkimi silatni proti zajednickomu dusmaninu vojna povede. Zatitn im zahvalise, sto je njihov kralj sam obrekao, da ce u zgodan cas pomagati Ugarskoj proti Turkom i zborom i tvorom, pa ih obodrise, neka bi kralj do kraja uztrajao u\n\ntojnamisli.Napokon bjeugovormedjukraljevi ikraljevinamiutvrdjen( VK laic ,\n\nPovijest Bosna: Do Propoasti Kraljevstva, 1882).\n\nMORE TURKISH THAN THE TURKS\n\nIn fact, of course, then and later, the Polish moment in Bosnia's affairs are far from fraternal. Polish knights take part in serial crusades against the good Christians of Bosnia. Centuries later, Poles serving in Ottoman and Austrian occupation armies and administrations are notorious for their hostility to the native population. An 1877 incident recorded in Pristina perhaps captures the letter and spirit of the Polish mo-\n\nment:The books at Prishtina were from Belgrade, but as they seemed only to have\n\nchitankas adapted for the youngest children, we asked if they had not some histo-\n\nries of Serbia. The master looked furtively around, and then said that he had some,\n\nbutdared not to usethemopenly.\"Why not?\"\" B ec ause theo ffi cers of theT urki sh\n\nregimentsf req uen t l y comean d lollabo ut in ourscho o l, and the cavalryo ffi cersare\n\noften Hungarians,C o ssackso r Poles,an d ean readt he Slavic books.\"\"Butthesedr y\n\nhistories contain nothing revolutionary, and surely the officers who are your fel-\n\nlow Christians would not wish to caluminate you.\"\"The rest would not, but the\n\nPoles are more Turkish than the Turks themselves. One day a Polish officer looked over the shoulder of one of the children, and called out: 'Holla, master! What do I see here? These books come from the principality [Serbia], and here is something about the history of Serbia. If I catch you at this again, I shall report you to the authorities'. I trembled from head to foot and knew not what I would say or do; but luckily there was also present a Cossack, a deserter from the Russian service, a good man who always befriended us; he got the Pole out of the room, and said to him in displeasure that they were not sent to Prishtina to meddle with the Serb school( G .\n\nMuir Mackenzie, A. P. Irby, The Slavonic Provinces of Turkey in Europe, 1877).\n\nTHE BLACK POPE\n\nIn World War II, it should be noted, Moslem leaders placed the blame for the crusading war and genocide against the Serbs and the chaos in Bosnia squarely on the shoulders of the Austro-Polish 'Black Pope,' Wladimir Ledochowski, Superior General of the Jesuits, who, perhaps inspired byd eran g ed visions of adi v i n e Polish mission, appears to have supported a Roman Catholic crusade againstsc hi sm at i c s in eastern and southeastern Europe.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nM.

Some scholars suspect that some of\n\nthe nations so-named are Slavs, perhaps Serbs, namely theAl-mizuri, Milcani Serbs; the\n\nTono-sursi, Surs-Serbs; the Iti-mari, Moravi Serbs; the Boiski, Boiski Serbs, Emperor\n\nConstantine VII's Boiki Serbs.\n\nSTRAVA\n\nPriscus' account of his visit to Attila's camp in Pannonia also reveals strongs Slavic\n\ntraces in the personal names, food, drink, and customs of the Huns and their Scythian\n\nallies: millet//>rar0; honey/medos; funeral feast/strava). Especially striking is the Slavic funeral\n\nceremony or Strava following Attila's death in 454: After he had been mourned\n\nwith such lamentations they celebrated a 'Strava' as they call it, over his tomb with\n\ngreat revelry, coupling opposite extremes of feeling in turn among themselves.\n\nA SLAVIC TRIBE\n\nC.D. Gordon's authoritative translation and commentary on 5th century Greek\n\nhistorians gives important information on the Sciri or Scyri, a Slavic tribe, once part\n\nof die Hunnish empire (The Age ofAttila, i960). We learn that: 1) The Sciri, who had\n\nsettled in Lower Moesia on the Danube, were a power in Pannonia where they were\n\nin more or less constant conflict with the Goths; 2) the Sciri played an important role\n\nin the Western armies commanded by Ricimer [appointed commander of imperial\n\narmies by emperor Avitus] and his successors; 3) the Sciri formed an important\n\npart of Odovacar's army in his final conquest of Italy; 4) Odovacar, the first barbarian\n\nking of Italy, either sprang from the race of Thuringi on his father's side and the\n\nSciri on his mother's side, according to one account, or he was of the nation of the\n\nScyri, according to another.\n\n[Sea of Azov], stretch northward a distance of fifteen days journey.Polybius locates\n\nSarmafia in thePonto-C aspiansteppe( H istona). Ptolemy'sS arm atia is animmensearea\n\nbounded by the Vistulaand Volga rivers and the Balticand Black seas( GeographikeH y phegesis). Pomponius Mela givesS arm atia a European orientation, namely the lands east of the Elbeand northof the Danube( DeS ituO rb is).\n\nSARMATS\n\nSimilarly,S arm at orS arm atae (also Sarabatiae, Sauromatae, Syrmatae, and\n\nSermende among others) succeeds Scythor Scythae more often than not as a learned\n\narchaism for the Slavs (e.g.Sarmatae Sclavi). Pliny, Tacitus and Ptolemy refer to the Slavs on the Vendic/Baltic Sea and the Vistula River as Sarmats. Ptolemy, for example, writes:H abi t an t Sarm at i am g en t es m ax i m ae Ven ed aepro pt ert o t um Ven ed i cum si n um ;\n\nMinores autem gentes Sarmatiam incolunt iuxta Visutalam infra Venedas Gythanes.\n\nMela locatesS arm atia east of Germania:G erm an i ad Sarm at as po rri g un t ur. Precisely\n\nwhereGerm ania ends andS arm atia begins, however, was a matter of some confusion. In\n\nDe Origine et Situ Germanorum (A.D. 98), a somewhat garbled description of the vari-\n\nous tribes west of the Rhine and north of the Danube, believed to be based largely on\n\nout-of-date material, Tacitus is not sure whether some nations wereGerm ans orS arm ats.\n\nHere Suebia ends. I am not sure whether the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti should\n\nbe assigned to the Teutons or to the Sarmatians ... The Venedi have adopted many\n\nSarmatian habits; for their plundering takes them over all the wooded and moun-\n\ntainous highlands that lie between the Peucini and the Fenni. Nevertheless, they\n\nare one the whole to be classed as Germans; for they have settled homes, carry\n\nshields, and are fond of traveling—and travelling as—on foot, differing in all\n\nthese respects from the Sarmatians.\n\nSUEBI\n\nIt is important to note that theS uebi , who occupy Germania's heartland, are also\n\na problem of sorts for Tacitus. TheS uebi , Tacitus writes,do not constitute a single\n\nnation. They occupy more than half Germany, and are divided into a number of\n\nseparate tribes under different names, though all are called by the generic name\n\nSuebi.In the early 1820s, D. Popp was one of the first German historians to identify\n\nTacitus'S uebi with the Slavs.\n\nNOT ALL SARMATIANS\n\nAt the same time it was clear to ancient and modern historians thatS arm at and\n\nSarmatia4 referred to an immense area inhabited by numerous and different nations,\n\nSlavs and others. In the succinct words of one scholar: All Slavs are Sarmatians, but all\n\nSarmatians are not Slavs.\n\n2. ILLYRIA, DALMATIA\n\nI\n\nn opposition to a northeast-southwest Slav invasion/settlement thesis, a contrary position has evolved in German historical scholarship—that the Slavs of Germany, Poland, and bordering lands originated in Serb lands between the Danube and the\n\nAdriatic, namely the former Roman provinces of Illyria and Dalmatia.1\n\nTHE ILLYRIA / DALMATIA THESIS\n\nIn terms of the Serb-Wend settlement of Germania, the Illyria/Dalmatia thesis has deep roots in German historical scholarship, dating from C. Schottgen and G. Keysig in the early 18th century to H. Kunstmann in the late 20th century.\n\nORIGINATED IN SARMATIA\n\nSchottgen and Kreysig find no fault with the notion that Germania's Serb-Wends originated in Sarmatia, in an area between the Volga, the Caucasus, and the Sea of Azov. However, they find fault with the favored notion that the Serb-Wends entered Germania from the north and east. They absolutely reject the views of such writers as T.\n\nSegerus: What, I ask, is more obvious and certain than that the Serbs from Misin/\n\nMeissenestabli shedtheki ngdoms ofSlavoni a andSerbi a i nIllyri a?(T .S egerus,DeS lavis\n\netLecho, 1725).\n\nFROM THE SOUTH\n\nIn fact, they write, the evidence is clear that the exact opposite is true: (1) the Serb-Wends did not enter Germania from the northby way of Prussia and Pomerania; (2) the Serb-Wends entered Germania from the south, from Illyria,by way of Moravia\n\nand Czechia^ (3) the Serb-Wends of Germania did not establish Serb kingdoms in\n\nIllyria; (4) the Illyrian Serbs migrated to, settled in, and established the Serb-Wend\n\nkingdomsofme di e va lG ermani a( C.S c hongen, G.K rey sig,Diplom atisc heun dC uri euse Nac hlehre der\n\nHistoricvon Ober-Sachsenund antgrentzendenlanden,17 3 0 ).ThemanyOnomasti c,li n gui st i c , a n d\n\ncultural parallels between the original Illyrian Serb lands and the derivative Germania\n\nSerb-Wend lands, they write, are simply too great to have it any other way.\n\nH. KUNSTMANN\n\nOne of the foremost exponents of this thesis in modern times is the renowned German Slavist, H. Kunstmann. His broad, deep, and exhaustive research has led him to suspect that (1) the Slavs of Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Russia and neighbor- ing lands originated in the Balkans, mainly Illyria/Dalmatia; that (2) the ethnonyms, ruling dynasties, place names, hydronyms and toponyms in West Slav and East Slav lands often can be traced to Slavic and slavicized roots in Illyria and bordering lands.\n\nOver several decades, in a series of always interesting and often provacative ar- ticles, Kunstmann has tirelessly advanced the onomastic, linguistic, textual, and other evidence in support of his thesis. While his views, in the order of suggestive and explor- ative inquiries, have not gained general acceptance, Kunstmann is not a minority of one. In fact, his views have varying degrees of general and specific support at the high- est levels of historical and linguistic scholarship. ANCIENT CENTER OF CIVILIZATION IN EUROPE\n\nEven the most learned, authoritative, and compelling advocates of a Near East\n\norigin of Indo-Europeans, V.V. Ivanov and T.V. Gamkrelidze, make certain concessions\n\nto the Danubia thesis(The MigrationofT rib es Speakingthe Indo-European Dialectsf rom their Original\n\nHomeland in the Middle Eastto their Historical Habitationsin Eurasia, InD 13, 1985).Theya d m i t(1) th a t\n\nthe Balkan area was the most ancient center of civilization in Europe; and (2) that the picture of the original Proto-Indo-European landscape derived from the linguistic re- construction of the proto-language rules out Central and Eastern Europe, excepting southeastern Europe.\n\nONE OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS\n\nIn response to Diakonov s critique, they go so far as to write: Actually, Diakonov's\n\nalternative, the Balkano-Carpathian hypothesis, is merely one of several possible\n\nsolutions within our hypothesis on the original homeland. We reconstruct a wider\n\narea—from the Balkans to Iran and southern Turkmenia—as the expanse within\n\nwhich the Indo-European original homeland might have been located in a definite\n\nterritory (TV. Gamkrelidze, V.V. Ivanov,T he Problem of the Original Homeland of theS peakers of Indo-European\n\nLanguages in Response to I.M. Diakonov's Article, InD 13, 1985).\n\nORIGINATED IN DANUBIA-PANNONIA\n\nThe following are some of the supportive points found in the works of distin- guished linguists, historians and Slavists: (1) The Slavs originated in Danubia-Pannonia; (2) Not all Slavs migrated northward from the Danube, some remained (thus the dense Slavic population and Slavic toponymy, the antiquity of Slavic waternames in pre-Hun- garian Pannonia-Danubia), others migrated south; (3) The Balkan South Slavs origi- nated in Pannonia-Danubia; (4) The Eastern Slavs originated in the south; (5) Place names and ethnonyms with apparent Balkan roots are found throughout Slavdom (e.g.\n\nDaksa, an island in the Adriatic, Doksy, in Czechoslovakia; Dukla, a mountain pass in\n\nthe Carpathians,D u k lja , in Montenegro;L ic ic a v ik i, a Slavic tribe in western Poland,\n\n*Liccavici in Illyria).\n\nWith regard to Germania, it should be noted that one of the greatest names in modern German Slavistics, J. Herrmann, concedes a possible connection between the great numbers of Serbs recorded in middle Danubia and along the Byzantine frontier in the 6th century and Serb settlements in Germania:Es ist... warscheinlich, dass aus\n\ndem Stamm der Serben/Sorben, der am Ende des 6 Jh. im mitteleren Donaugebiet\n\nan den Grenzen von Byzanz stand und der sich mit dan Awaren auseinanderzusetzen\n\nhatte,ei nTeilausschi ed undnordwärtswanderte(J .H errm ann,DieSlawen inDeutsc hland:\n\nGeschichte und Kultur der slawischen Stamme westlich von Oder und Niesse vom 6. bis 12. Jahrhundert, 1985).\n\nENDNOTES\n\n' All attempts to traceA lban i a andA l ban i an roots to ancientI lly ri a andlUy ri an s run contary to the first and last\n\nwords of authoritative scholarship. On this subject, V. I. Georgiev, for example, perhaps the single greatest author-\n\nity on ancient Balkan linguistics and onomastics, writes:But many linguists and historians ... have put forward\n\nvery important considerations indicating that the Albanians cannot be autochthonic in present-day Alba- nia; that their original home was the eastern part of Mysia Superior, or approximately Dardania and Dacia Mediterranea, i.e., the northern central region of the Balkan peninsula, and part of Dacia. However, since it has become clear that Daco-Mysian and Thracian represent two different IE languages, the problem of the origin of the Albanian language and the Albanians themselves appears in a new light. The most important facts and considerations for determining the original habitat of the Albanians are the following: (a) The Illyrian toponyms known from antiquity, e.g. Skhoder from the ancient Scodra (Livius), Tomor from Tomaros (Strabo, Pliny, etc.), have not been directly inherited in Albanian: th"
