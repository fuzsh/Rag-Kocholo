        "text": "New media enable new cultures to transform society. Now that the process has accelerated to the point where it is visible on a daily basis, most people understand that new communication media mean new ways of life. Indeed, it is now possible to see how new ways of creating and distributing symbols have made it possible throughout history for people to change existing cultural practices, and through these changes in the way people socialize, to transform societies.\n\nResearchers have examined the impact of the internet in regions experiencing economic change and struggle. However, broad assumptions about opportunity and access to the internet in these regions still exist. An unproblematised 'global village', where equal opportunity to engage in an open dialogue, is yet to be achieved. This article examines these issues in East Central Europe and the electronic discourses emergent in and about this region. The article questions the empowering capabilities of the internet in East Central Europe. The article will present the voices from this region who assert that only with widespread access, can the internet fulfil its democratic promise. Women's access to the internet will also be discussed. Finally, the article highlights women's organisations in Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic which are creating spaces for collaboration and connectivity, and providing a forum for new voices which have previously been silent.\n\nMedia may direct individual or society towards some ideas and actions. Technologic convergence moved broadcasting and publishing into digital media. This study analyzes design characteristics and contents of news web sites in Southern East Europe. Thus, contributions to positive and negative efforts in the context of social cohesion and separation efforts investigated. Some of analyzed features of news sites are medium profile, user profile, membership, news topics, multimedia usage, usage of social media, multi‚Äêlingual publishing/broadcasting."
