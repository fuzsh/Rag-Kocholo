        "text": "German Reich (1943-1944)\n\nArmored Personnel/Supply Carrier – One Prototype Built (1,376 Ordered)\n\nDuring the Second World War, the German Army relied on armored half-tracks to transport the troops of the Panzer divisions. A fully-tracked chassis was seen as a somewhat better solution, and a few projects were initiated to create such a vehicle, such as the Munition und Mannschaftrager auf Fahrgestell 38(t) Ausf.M. While some prototypes were eventually made, the deteriorating economic situation and demand for more fighting vehicles doomed this attempt almost from the start.\n\nHistory\n\nToday, the Second World War is recognized for the massive use of tanks. These were used as a spearhead that was intended to break the enemy defense lines followed by the quick exploitation of the created breach. However, one major factor that is often overlooked is the supporting role of the infantry. Tanks alone could not easily overcome enemy defenses despite their armor and firepower. Often, the enemy was simply too well entrenched, presenting a huge obstacle that the tanks alone could do little against. It was the job of the supporting infantry, to clear up the way for the tanks. The problem here was that they would need a vehicle that was well-protected and possessed good mobility to be able to follow advancing tank formations. The Germans were the first to develop such a vehicle in the form of the armored Sd.Kfz.251 half-tracks.\n\nIn late 1941, In 6 (the Inspectorate that was responsible for mechanization) initiated the development of a fully tracked armored personnel carrier. The reasons why such a decision was made were based on actual combat experiences. While the half-track vehicles did the job well, several issues needed to be resolved. The Sd.Kfz.250 had good mobility but not sufficient compared to a fully-tracked vehicle. It was prone to axle malfunctioning when crossing trenches or steep slopes, for example. To have the maximum driving speed possible, adding additional armor plates in their current form was not possible. This meant that the Sd.Kfz.250’s light armor protection could be easily pierced by any proper anti-tank weapon. Due to changes to the original half-track chassis with the addition of armor and weaponry, the towing and load-carrying capacities were limited.\n\nBased on these combat experiences, In 6 requested that a fully-tracked carrier be developed with the following parameters:\n\nmaximum speed of up to 80 km/h with an off-road speed of 50 km/h\n\nfrontal protection consisting of 30 mm thick face-hardening armor plates\n\ntransport capacity of 10 soldiers (besides the driver and co-driver)\n\ntrack length of 40 cm\n\noperational range up to 500 km\n\nWhile such a vehicle was greatly needed, actual development went at a rather slow pace and with low priority. It would take years to produce a small experimental series of vehicles designated as Mannschaftransportwagen Kätzchen (Eng. Personnel Carrier Kitten). Auto Union AG developed its first prototype that utilized a torsion bar suspension with overlapping wheels.\n\nBMM’s work on an Armored Personnel Carrier\n\nIn 1943, as the Auto Union AG project went on, there were debates among some German Army officials if such a vehicle could be instead produced using an already existing chassis. By this late period into the war, German industrial capacity was already overburdened with various different projects. Introducing yet another completely new design would take too much time and resources to put into production. In May 1943, for this reason, Wa Prüf 6 (the German automotive design office which was part of the ordnance department) proposed that a better solution may be utilizing BMM’s newly developed Marder 38T that was just entering production.\n\nBMM (Böhmisch-Mährische Maschinenfabrik) was the former Czechoslovak ČKD company (Českomoravská Kolben Daněk) prior to the German occupation. Their new Marder 38T was built using the proven Panzer 38(t) chassis. The TNH – LT vz.38 tanks, as they were originally known, were developed and built in the second half of the 1930s. While the Panzer 38(t) was a good tank design for its time, it eventually became obsolete. Its chassis was very reliable and used by the Germans as a basis for various different projects.\n\nIn 1941, the Germans began to encounter well-protected and armed enemy tanks. In order to deal with these, as a temporary solution, a series of self-propelled anti-tank vehicles, generally known by their nickname Marder (Eng. Marten), were introduced. These share the same obsolete tank chassis, on which a mostly open superstructure with strong armament was placed. The most common variants were those that were built using the Panzer 38(t) chassis.\n\nIn early 1943, BMM initiated a new project that involved creating an improved superstructure for the next version of this anti-tank vehicle series. The primary goal of the redesign was to increase the stability of the vehicle during the firing of the gun. The new rear-mounted superstructure provided better protection for the crew and allowed for more stable operation of the anti-tank gun. Moving the engine compartment to the middle of the vehicle created more space for the crew and the gun mount. Last, but probably most importantly, were the efforts that were made to standardize the chassis so that it could be utilized for various roles. This approach aimed to optimize production efficiency and logistics by using a common platform for multiple purposes. The prototype was completed and presented to the German Army officials in February 1943. The production of the first vehicles began in May 1943. This modified chassis of the Panzer 38(t) used for the Marder 38T Ausf.M was later also used for the 15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) Grille self-propelled gun and the Flakpanzer 38(t).\n\nThe BMM presented a wooden mock-up. In essence, it was a standard Marder 38T Ausf.M that had its main armament removed. The opening where the gun protruded at the front was covered. The rear crew compartment was slightly enlarged. Besides that, no major modification was done. Besides transporting troops, a secondary role that this vehicle was to perform was to transport ammunition. In theory, this would offer a cheaper alternative to Auto Union AG’s design that could be put into production much sooner, as the tooling equipment for its construction was already available. When precisely the first prototype was completed is unclear, but possibly somewhere in late 1943 or early 1944.\n\nIt should be noted that this vehicle was connected to the latter ammunition supply vehicle based on the 15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) Grille self-propelled gun. While somewhat similar, the latter was simply a Grille self-propelled vehicle that had its gun removed to be used as a transport carrier of the larger 15 cm ammunition. The Grille based version did not have the enlarged rear compartment.\n\nName\n\nAccording to T. L.Jentz and H. L. Doyle (Vollketten M.S.P. Kätzchen and Final Developments of the Sd.Kfz.251 Panzer Tracts No.15-4), the Germans designated this vehicle as Munition und Mannschaftrager auf Fahrgestell 38(t) Ausf.M. This could be translated as Ammunition and Personnel Carrier on Chassis 38(t) Ausf.M.\n\nAuthors V. Francev and C. K. Kliment (Marder III and Grille) mention a quite different designation for this vehicle. According to them, it was designated as Mannschaftstransportwagen und Munition Transportwagen auf Fahrgestell 38(t) Motor Mitte. This could be translated as Personnel Transport Vehicle and Ammunition Transport Vehicle on Chassis 38(t) Engine Middle. The last part referred to the Ausf.M version.\n\nDesign\n\nGiven that it did not go beyond the prototype stage, nothing of its characteristics is mentioned in the sources. Luckily, the few surviving photographs give us some clue about its overall design.\n\nHull\n\nThe new vehicle was built using a Marder 38T’s chassis. This particular hull design consisted of a forward-mounted transmission, a central engine compartment, and the rear positioned crew compartment. To the right front side, the fully enclosed driver compartment was located, and in front of it was the transmission unit.\n\nThe glacis armor that protected the front-positioned transmission was placed at a high angle. It retained the large hatch, which provided the crew with easy access to the brake and transmission assemblies (in case of emergency and repair). The hull and the remaining parts of this vehicle were constructed using armored plates that were riveted or, to a smaller extent, welded together.\n\nSuspension and Running Gear\n\nThe suspension consisted of four road wheels with split rubber tires. These wheels were connected in pairs and were suspended using semi-elliptical leaf spring units. In addition, there was a front drive sprocket, rear idler, and one return roller per side.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nDuring its production history, the Marder 38T was powered by three different engine types.\n\nEngine type Time of production 150 hp ​​at 2,600 rpm Praga EPA AC/2600 6-cylinder water-cooled May to July 1943 180 hp at 2,800 rpm Praga Ausf. IV July to November 1943 160 hp at 2,600 rpm Praga Typ NS November 1943 to May 1944\n\nWhich precise version was used for this modification is unknown. On early models, the pipe connecting the engine to the muffler passed through the inside of the fighting chamber while, on late production models, it exited through the ventilation grille on the right side of the vehicle and ran alongside the superstructure externally. This indicates that this particular vehicle belongs to later-produced vehicles. It is most likely that it was powered by the Praga Typ NS engine.\n\nEven if this assumption is correct, nothing is known about its overall drive performance. While the gun and the ammunition were removed, the weight of the vehicle when fully loaded would remain possibly unchanged from the original Marder 38Ts. It can be assumed that the drive performance would remain mostly unchanged\n\nPassenger Compartment\n\nTo the rear of the vehicle superstructure was an open-top passenger compartment. In essence, this was just an enlarged version of the one used on the Marder 38T Ausf.M. It was extended to the rear, with the sided armor plates being slightly heightened. On the front, a plate covered the former opening for the main gun. Lastly, to the rear, a two-part door allowed the passengers to enter their positions. Inside this compartment, two wooden benches were positioned. To help the passengers during entry, a metal step was installed just below the entrance door.\n\nPassenger Capacity\n\nThe passenger capacity of this vehicle slightly differs between sources. Authors V. Francev and C. K. Kliment mention a number of 8 passengers plus the driver. L.Jentz and H. L. Doyle give a slightly larger number of 11 not including the driver. In either case, the passenger compartment was rather cramped.\n\nArmor Protection\n\nThis vehicle never went beyond the prototype stage. Because of this, the added extension of the passenger compartment was actually made of wood. The intended armor thickness of this part of the vehicle is unmentioned in the sources. Given the whole idea behind developing this vehicle was to find the simplest and cheapest solution possible, it would likely have been unchanged from the Marder 38T Ausf.M. In this case, it would only have been 10 mm thick. Most parts of the hull and superstructure were slightly better protected, with 15 mm of armor.\n\nFate\n\nEventually, for unspecified reasons, this vehicle was not adopted for production. Due to the lack of any information, only speculation can be made about why this was the case. The simplest reason was that its overall design was not appealing to the Germans. Instead, in 1944, BMM was instructed to develop a new armored personnel carrier, this time based on the newly developed Panzerjager 38(t). Its overall shape was similar to that used by the Auto Union AG. While BMM was working to complete two such prototype vehicles, the project was eventually canceled near the end of the war. The last attempt was made to combine both Auto Union AG and BMM designs, but this project was canceled due to its much weaker performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Munition und Mannschaftrager auf Fahrgestell 38(t) Ausf.M was surely an interesting attempt to develop a rather cheap troop and ammunition carrier. However, the whole design had some flaws and these likely led to it being not adopted for service. The armor protection was simply too weak and could be easily penetrated by any anti-tank weapon. The passengers were all cramped into the rear compartment. This, along with the low armor protection, meant that, when it was hit, there was a huge chance that nearly all of its occupants being wounded or killed. The half-track that was in service also suffered from low armor protection, but at least the Sdk.Kfz.251 was spacious for the occupants. While a cheaper variant, the Germans instead decided to proceed with the Kätzchen 38(t) based on the later Panzerjager 38(t) project, which was ironically also canceled.\n\nMunition und Mannschaftrager auf Fahrgestell 38(t) Ausf.M Technical specifications\n\nCrew 1 (Driver, plus 7 to 10 passengers) Weight 10.1 tonnes Dimensions Length 5.02 m, Width 2.15 m, Height 2.35 m Engine 150 hp @ 2,800 rpm Armor 6 to 15 mm\n\nSources\n\nT.

Early attempts would see the introduction of the Cruiser Mk.I and II, which were far from perfect for this role. Ironically, the inspiration for a new better cruiser would come in the form of the Soviet BT fast tanks. These, in turn, were based on the American Christie tanks. One such vehicle was brought to the UK for evaluation and testing. After numerous modifications, a new vehicle was adopted for service as the Cruiser Mk.III (A.13 Mark I).\n\nA Brief History of the UK Cruiser Tank Concept\n\nThe United Kingdom is the birthplace of tanks. They employed the first tanks on mass during the First World War. After the war, the exhausted nation felt it had no need for large armies. This led to a reduction in financing, which in turn led to the stagnation of tank development. By the 1930s, the rising tensions in Europe forced the British to start investing once again into army expansion, including military vehicles, such as tanks. The British Army was experimenting with three different tank concepts. One was the so-called infantry tank, which was characterized by having thick armor, rather weak armament, and low speed. The second concept was specially developed for cavalry-like use. These formations emphasized the importance of speed and firepower. Thick armor was given up in favor of mobility. The last type were the light tanks, meant for reconnaissance.\n\nOrders for the development of the first such vehicles were issued in 1934. The Vickers-Amstrong company responded with their Cruiser Mk.I and IIs. While having poor armor protection, they were in turn armed with an effective 2-pounder gun as the main armament. While generally fitting the Cruiser tank concept, their suspension was neither very effective nor suited for tanks that were expected to have good mobility. A better suspension capable of greater speed was desirable. The inspiration for the new design would come from an uninspected side.\n\nSoviet Inspiration\n\nThe vehicle that would serve as a basis for the new British Cruiser tank came from a well-known inventor named John Walter Christie. After the end of the First World War, Christie had been involved in experimenting with a new concept for a convertible armored vehicle. He devised a plan of using a tracked suspension system that could, if needed, be easily modified and used as a sort of wheeled vehicle by simply removing the tracks. His first tank prototype to use this kind of suspension was presented to the US Army in early 1921, named M1919. While the vehicle was trialed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a number of problems were noted. For this reason, Christie spent some time modifying and improving his design, which he again presented to the US Army in 1923.\n\nOnce again, this tank was rejected due to many flaws in the design. Once more, Christie completely redesigned his suspension system. This time, he incorporated four larger road wheels, with the idler in the front and the drive sprocket at the rear. The last road wheel was connected with a chain belt to the drive sprocket and was used to provide drive power when the track links were removed. The front road wheels were used for steering. During 1928 (thus the name M1928), Christie himself made great efforts to advertise his new vehicle, especially to the US Army, but also to customers abroad.\n\nLuckily for Christie, armies around the world were slowly expanding their forces, including their armored vehicle fleets. Poland and the Soviet Union were highly interested in the Christie design. Based on his vehicle, the Polish would develop their own tank, which did not go beyond the prototype stage due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The negotiation with the Soviets proved more promising.\n\nIn 1930, a Soviet delegation led by I. Khalepskiy, who was in charge of the Red Army Mechanization and Motorization Directorate (UMM), and D.F. Budniak, the Defence Industry representative, visited a number of American weapons and arms manufacturers, including Christie’s own plant. The Soviets were highly impressed with what they saw and ordered two vehicles. These arrived in early 1931 and would serve as the foundation for the later BT-series (Rus. Bystrokhodny tank – fast tank) which was produced in great numbers.\n\nYears later, the British delegation would see these vehicles at military maneuvers held by the Red Army near Kyiv during August and September 1936. This delegation included Deputy Director of Mechanisation Troops at the Ministry of War, Lieutenant-Colonel Giffard LeQuesne Martel. He was a staunch advocate of mechanizing forces and was highly impressed with the Soviet BT-series performance. Martel saw the BT’s potential for a solution to the UK’s search for a fast tank. He even expressed willingness to potentially acquire one such vehicle for testing and evaluation. His wish would not be fulfilled, as the Ministry of War, due to political reasons, did not want to consider such a purchase from a Communist state. This was not the end of the story. If such a vehicle could not be obtained from the Soviet Union, maybe the original designer in the US would be more open to cooperation. Relations between the US and the UK were generally good, so there was a good chance that this program would be realized.\n\nMartel sought to initiate discussions with Christie regarding a potential purchase of one of his tanks. However, lacking the full authority to represent the Ministry of War, Martel harbored concerns about potential rejection. To navigate this, he initially approached a prominent businessman, Lord Nuffield, owner of the Nuffield Company of Morris Commercial Cars. In a dialogue with Nuffield, Martel successfully persuaded him to reach out to Christie and explore the possibility of striking a deal. Upon Nuffield’s agreement, a transatlantic telephone call was arranged, resulting in an agreement for the sale of one Christie tank to the UK, albeit without a turret, in order to keep costs down. Martel’s primary interest lay not in the turret but in the chassis and suspension design. Thus, omitting the turret was of little consequence to him.\n\nDespite the initial agreement, delivery issues arose. The recently implemented Neutrality Act of 1935 implemented by the US Government technically prohibited Christie from selling his vehicle to the UK. To circumvent this ban, Christie classified the vehicle as an agricultural tractor. However, the exact number of vehicles delivered to the UK remains somewhat ambiguous in the sources. According to P. Chamberlain and C. Ellis in British And American Tanks of World War Two, two prototypes were acquired. Conversely, author J. Solarz in A.13 Mk I/MK II mentions only one vehicle being bought. Adding to the confusion, Solarz also noted the inclusion of a turret. It is possible that the authors confused the vehicles delivered to the UK with those sent to the Soviet Union, disguised as tractors. Nonetheless, the tank ultimately arrived at the Mechanisation Experimental Establishment (MEE) in Farnborough (Hampshire) in November 1936, designated as A13E1, and used for field testing.\n\nUpon arrival, it was immediately noted that the tank lacked an air filter. After installing suitable filters, initial drive testing commenced. The tank displayed promising all-around drive performance, thanks to its 350 hp Liberty petrol engine, which proved more than adequate for the job. The gearbox unit operated smoothly, without any major issues. However, a notable downside was the relatively weak armor protection, measuring only 13 mm thick. Additionally, the turret ring was deemed too small to accommodate even the smallest UK’s tank’s turrets. Nevertheless, this deficiency did not pose a significant problem, as UK officials were more concerned with the suspension rather than the overall hull’s design.\n\nThe tank was then transferred to Morris Commercials Cars Ltd., where it underwent disassembly and meticulous examination. At this juncture, Nuffield’s enthusiasm for the project surged, prompting him to insist that his firm take charge of its future development. Consequently, in September 1937, he established a new company, Nuffield Mechanization and Aero Ltd, situated in Birmingham.\n\nAs preparations for constructing the initial prototype progressed, Christie arrived in the UK early in 1937 to lend his expertise to the endeavor. Assuming an advisory role, he offered suggestions for potential enhancements to his design. One such suggestion aimed to enhance the vehicle’s overall performance by utilizing a wider track pitch of 254 mm. However, Nuffield opposed this proposal, opting instead for a much narrower 127 mm pitch. A significant challenge in the project was the scarcity of suitable engines. To expedite development and simultaneously reduce costs in the years preceding the Second World War, it was common practice to repurpose aircraft engines for this purpose. These engines offered adequate power and were available in relatively significant numbers. Martel dedicated considerable effort to locating an engine of sufficient strength for the task at hand. Fortunately, he stumbled upon stockpiles containing over 600 stored and unused 500 hp Napier engines. While expressing interest in procuring one for testing, financial constraints, and the engines’ growing obsolescence posed major hurdles. By the time funds were secured several months later, all the engines had been depleted, leaving Martel empty-handed. This setback was eventually overcome through the acquisition of six older Liberty-type aircraft engines, complete with documentation. With these engines in hand, Nuffield engineers commenced production of new engines designated as the Nuffield Liberty.\n\nWith financial and production issues resolved, the time had finally arrived to commence work on the first prototypes. The initial vehicle, designated as A13E2, was completed in October 1937. Despite bearing many similarities to Christie’s design, this new prototype introduced a series of alterations tailored to meet the requirements of the British tank concept. Notably, the turret ring was enlarged to accommodate a more spacious turret, necessitating an enlargement of the A13E2’s hull. While Christie’s vehicles could be driven without tracks, this feature was not well-received by the British and was consequently abandoned. Instead, a rear-driven sprocket without teeth was employed.\n\nFollowing its completion, the prototype underwent field testing at the MEE, where several defects were identified. The gearbox unit, in particular, proved to be somewhat problematic and required reworking. This adjustment resulted in a reduction of the maximum speed to 48 km/h, which was still commendable for pre-war designs. In February 1938, another prototype, named A13E3, was constructed. This iteration incorporated newly developed domestic tracks with a smaller two-comb pitch, and the rear driver sprocket was equipped with teeth.\n\nProduction\n\nAfter the approval of the new tank design, a production order for 65 vehicles was issued in January 1938, and entrusted to Nuffield. Actual production commenced either at the end of 1938 or in early 1939, varying according to different sources. By September 1939, around 43 vehicles had been completed. The remainder of the production order was fulfilled by the end of 1939, with serial numbers assigned from ‘T4385’ to ‘T4449’. No further vehicles were ordered, as the type was superseded by slightly improved models.\n\nName\n\nOnce in production, these were designated as Cruiser Mk.III (A.13 Mark I). For the sake of simplicity, this article will refer to the tank as the A.13 Mark I.\n\nTechnical Specification\n\nHull\n\nThe A.13 Mark I hull maintained a similar layout to earlier British Cruiser tanks. Essentially, it could be divided into three major compartments: the front hull, which housed the driver and his controls; the crew compartment; and finally, the engine and transmission compartment. The fully protected frontal hull featured four small inspection hatches and one larger hatch for the driver. Additionally, a small headlight, protected by a box-shaped housing, was mounted on top of the glacis plate. The hull, as well as the entire vehicle, was predominantly constructed using bolted armor plates.\n\nSuspension\n\nThe A.13 Mark I marked a significant milestone for British tanks, as it introduced the Christie suspension. This suspension system comprised four large rubber-tired road wheels, a front-mounted idler, and a rear drive sprocket. There were no return rollers. Each road wheel was equipped with helical springs, cleverly positioned inside the combat compartment. This innovative design provided exceptional vertical deflection, ensuring a smoother ride, especially at higher speeds. However, it demanded considerable internal hull space for the proper installation of the helical springs. Despite this drawback, the Christie suspension proved to be far more suitable for fast-moving tanks compared to earlier suspension types utilized by the British forces.\n\nEngine\n\nThe A.13 Mark I was powered by a 340 hp Nuffield Liberty V12 engine. With an overall weight of some 14.2 tonnes, this engine enabled the vehicle to achieve a maximum speed of 48 km/h, which slightly decreased to 38 km/h when traversing cross-country terrain. Equipped with a fuel capacity of 510 liters, it could operate for up to 149 km before requiring refueling. The fuel was stored inside the rear engine compartment.\n\nSuperstructure\n\nThe A.13 Mark I’s superstructure primarily functioned as an extension of the lower hull, mainly aimed at safeguarding both the crew and the engine. At its forefront, a small box-shaped protrusion housed the protected driver’s compartment. This compartment featured three vision ports: one facing forward and two covering each side, enabling the driver to navigate effectively. Moreover, the front plate of this compartment doubled as an escape hatch. Moving towards the rear, the superstructure provided full enclosure for the engine. Positioned atop it were several access hatches alongside four ventilation grilles.\n\nTurret\n\nThe A.13 Mark I’s turret bore striking resemblances to those utilized on the A.9 and A.10 Cruiser tanks, which was to be expected, given the benefits of leveraging existing components. This approach not only minimized costs but also expedited the development and production process significantly. Consistent with the vehicle’s construction, the turret was assembled using bolted armor plates, featuring a straightforward box-shaped design with a slight extension towards the rear. This rear extension served as a storage compartment for the WS No. 11 type radio equipment. Aside from the primary opening at the front for the main armament, the turret sides lacked additional apertures or vision slits. Positioned atop the turret was a two-part hatch accompanied by a command cupola located on the left side. Initially, an octagonal cupola was implemented but was subsequently replaced with a round design. In either case, the commander was equipped with four observation ports and a two-part hatch for enhanced visibility and operational control.\n\nArmament\n\nThe primary armament of the A.13 Mark I was a 2-pounder (40 mm) Mk.IX/XA main gun, centrally positioned within the turret and shielded by a rounded gun mantlet. Capable of an elevation range from -15° to +20°, this gun stood out as one of the best weapons utilized during the pre-war era. With the ability to penetrate approximately 42 mm of armor at a range of nearly 1 km, it boasted impressive firepower. Contrary to a persistent myth, British tanks armed with such caliber guns were indeed equipped with high-explosive rounds. These rounds were developed by the British and underwent a brief production phase, which concluded by mid-1940. Although available, such rounds were rare, leaving crews of tanks like the A.13 Mark I to rely on the co-axial 7.7 mm Vickers machine gun when engaging enemy infantry or anti-tank emplacements. While initial plans included the installation of a secondary machine gun within the hull, this feature was never implemented on the A.13 Mark I. The main gun’s ammunition load consisted of 87 rounds, with an additional 3,750 rounds for the machine gun. Another weapon option considered but ultimately never installed was the short-barrel 94 mm gun.\n\nArmor\n\nTo uphold its high maximum speed, the A.13 Mark I sported lighter protection. Its turret and hull featured armor thickness of merely 14 mm, with the rear slightly weaker at 12 mm, and the bottom at 6 mm. A few units were equipped with an added 14 mm spaced turret armor for enhanced defense. Additionally, some vehicles were fitted with smoke discharges on the turret sides to offer an extra layer of protection.\n\nCrew\n\nThe vehicle was crewed by a team of four, comprising the commander, gunner, loader, and driver. Interestingly, despite its modest crew size, three members were housed within the turret, leaving the driver as the sole occupant of the hull. The gunner occupied a seat to the left of the gun, with the commander positioned behind, while the loader took their place on the opposite side.\n\nIn Combat\n\nFrance 1940\n\nWith the German attack on Poland, the Western Allies declared war on the 3rd September, 1939. In anticipation of a potential German attack on France, the British decided to dispatch the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France in May 1940. This force included elements of armored units, notably the 1st Armoured Division, organized into two armored brigades: the 2nd and 3rd brigades, each further divided into three regiments. Initially, the 2nd Brigade was to be equipped with light tanks, while the 3rd Brigade was designated to receive Cruiser tanks. However, this plan was altered before May 1940, resulting in a mixture of Cruiser and light tanks across both brigades.\n\nRather than immediately deploying to France, the 1st Armoured Division was initially stationed in the UK to defend against potential German sea or air invasion. This period was utilized for crew training and familiarization with the newly introduced vehicles, such as the A.13 Mark I Cruiser tanks, which were fresh off the production lines. However, the training process was hindered by a general lack of essential equipment, including radios, gunnery optics, and main armaments for many vehicles.\n\nAccording to British Army plans, the 1st Armoured Division was scheduled to relocate to Normandy for its final training exercise in May 1940. The Division began arriving in France on May 17th, 1940, albeit with limited equipment, including 284 tanks, of which 150 were various Cruiser types. The distribution of tanks slightly favored Cruisers over light tanks. For instance, the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen’s Bays) Regiment possessed 4 A.9, 3 A.10, and 22 A.13 Mark I Cruisers, along with 21 Mark VIC light tanks. Despite the arrival of promised equipment, shortages persisted, particularly for spare parts, gun sights, and critical ammunition for the 40 mm guns.\n\nThe chronic shortage of equipment in 1940 was exemplified by an incident where a squadron leader from the 9th Lancers had to clandestinely transport ammunition, sights, and machine guns in a private car, unbeknownst to other units of the 1st Armoured Division. Complicating matters further, the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment was transported separately to reinforce the defense of Calais. Additionally, the 1st Armoured Division lacked artillery or anti-tank support, further adding to its challenges.\n\nAs the 1st Armoured Division began to arrive, the Allied forces found themselves systematically pushed back towards the Channel coast. Desperately, Allied command sought to assemble a force capable of mounting a counter-attack against the exposed German flanks near the Somme River, hoping to stem the tide before all was lost. On the 27th May, 1930, the 2nd Armoured Brigade led the charge, supported by the French 2e Division de Cavalerie Légère (Eng. 2nd Light Cavalry Division). They were further reinforced by the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 5e Division de Cavalerie Légèr (Eng. 5th Light Cavalry Division). Despite an initial advance, the Allied forces soon found themselves entangled in fierce combat against heavy German anti-tank fire. The 3.7 cm rounds from German anti-tank guns effortlessly pierced the armor of British Cruiser tanks. Ultimately, the attack was repelled, resulting in significant losses; the British alone lost 65 tanks, including 15 A.13 Mark Is. In the aftermath, the surviving British tank units attempted a retreat. The remnants of the 2nd Armored Brigade sought to escape towards Brest, while the 3rd Brigade retreated towards Cherbourg, hotly pursued by the 7th Panzer Division. Upon arrival at Cherbourg, only 14 operational A.13 Mark I tanks remained. Immediately, efforts were made to evacuate as many tanks as possible, but the rapid advance of the German forces allowed for the successful evacuation of only 7 Cruisers and 6 Mk.VIC tanks, leaving the majority of the vehicles behind.\n\nThe 3rd Tank Regiment, having been separated, finally arrived at Calais on the 22nd May, 1940. Allied defenders pinned their hopes on establishing a mobile tank force with the support of these newly arrived vehicles. Their primary objective was to bolster defenses near Boulogne. However, logistical hurdles arose due to the port’s inadequacy in promptly offloading the tanks. Consequently, on May 23rd, a majority of the available tanks were dispatched towards St. Omer. There, they encountered formidable German resistance, compelling a strategic retreat. Faced with this adversity, the unit commander made the decision to evacuate towards Gravelines, albeit at the cost of losing a considerable number of tanks in the process.\n\nExpecting the Invasion\n\nThe Cruiser tanks that were not deployed to France were allocated to various units within the UK, including the 5th Royal Tank Regiment. With the UK bracing for the anticipated German invasion, tank formations were kept in reserve, poised to counter any potential threat. However, with no German invasion materializing after the fall of France, the British armored formations found themselves predominantly utilized for training purposes.\n\nNorth Africa\n\nIn North Africa, from 1940 to 1941, the initial versions of the Cruiser tanks saw extensive combat use. Among these, it is probable that some were A.13 Mark I models. However, sources often lack detailed descriptions of specific variants used by the British Cruiser units during this period in North Africa. By 1941, the A.13 Mark I was predominantly replaced by the more plentiful Mk.IV (A.13 Mark II), which, in turn, gave way to the newer Crusader tank. By the end of 1941, the early Cruiser tanks, including the A.13 Mark I, were phased out of service.\n\nIn German hands\n\nFollowing their success in the West, the Germans came into possession of a large stock of enemy armor, predominantly of French origin. Smaller quantities of British vehicles were also captured, including some A.13 Mark I Cruisers. Their fate after this campaign is not clear, but at least one saw service in occupied Yugoslavia in late 1943 and early 1944 near Sisak. Besides this, unfortunately, nothing is known.\n\nA.13 Mark I Versions\n\nA16E1\n\nTo achieve optimal speed and drive performance, the armor thickness of earlier Cruiser tanks needed to remain minimal. However, confronting heavier enemy resistance demanded a solution with enhanced armor and firepower. This necessity spurred the development of the A16E1 prototype, which was based on the A.13 Mark I vehicle but featured numerous design modifications, including a more robust engine, improved armor protection, and an extended chassis. Despite the construction of one unarmed prototype, the entire project was short-lived. It became apparent that existing Cruiser tank designs could be readily upgraded with stronger armor, rendering the specific purpose of this vehicle redundant.\n\nCruiser Mk.IV (A.13 Mark II)\n\nGiven the A.13 Mark I’s lack of armor protection, the British introduced a slightly improved version in 1939, the Cruiser Mk.IV (A.13 Mark II). This was essentially the same vehicle with changes to its frontal armor protection, which was increased to 30 mm. In addition, the turret was slightly redesigned by adding additional spaced armor. This tank saw an expansion in production, with over 200 vehicles being manufactured. Its enhanced armor made it better suited for combat operations. It saw action in France and later in North Africa. However, it was eventually phased out in favor of the more abundant Covenanter and Crusader tanks.\n\nSurviving Vehicle\n\nDespite the small production run, one A.13 Mrk I tank survived the war. It is currently exhibited at the Bovington Tank Museum in the UK.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe A.13 Mark I, with its lightweight armor, demonstrated limited combat effectiveness. Nevertheless, it played a crucial role as a foundational milestone in British tank development. Notably, it was the inaugural British tank to be outfitted with the Christie-type suspension, a feature that paved the way for the creation and deployment of subsequent Cruiser tanks, like the renowned Crusader and Cromwell. These advancements proved indispensable to the British armored forces throughout the tumultuous years of the Second World War.\n\nCruiser Mk.III A.13 Mark I Technical specifications\n\nCrew 4 (commander, gunner, loader, driver) Weight 14.2 tonnes Dimensions Length 6.02 m, Width 2.54 m, Height 2.59 m Engine 340 hp Nuffield liberty Speed 48 km/h, 38 km/h (cross-country) Range 149 km Primary Armament 40 mm Mk.IX/XA gun Secondary Armament one 7.7 mm Vickers machine gun Armor 6 to 14 mm\n\nSources\n\nS.

The whole design was simple, just placing the anti-tank gun on any available tank chassis and adding some minimal armored protection. Despite their simplicity and somewhat crude design, if properly employed, these expedient vehicles showed themselves to be effective tank-killers. While nearly all were issued for German use, smaller numbers were issued to the Slovakian Army in late 1944. Ironically, while intended to fight off the Soviets, they were instead employed in the failed uprising against the Germans, during which all would be lost.\n\nA Brief History of Marder Anti-Tank Vehicles\n\nFollowing the invasion of the Soviet Union of 1941, the Germans quickly learned the hard way that their tank and anti-tank guns were of limited use against the T-34 and KV series. The experience gained during the first year of the invasion raised a red alert in the highest German military circles. To combat these new threats, the Germans rushed to introduce the new 7.5 cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun into service. After 1942, it became the standard German anti-tank gun used until the end of the war, with some 20,000 guns being built.\n\nThe PaK 40 was an excellent anti-tank gun, but its main problem was its heavy weight, making it somewhat difficult to deploy and hard to manhandle. The Germans went for the simplest solution and tried to improve its mobility by placing it on a series of obsolete tank chassis. These new Panzerjäger (Eng. Anti-tank) vehicles followed the same pattern. Most were open-topped, with limited gun traverse, and thin armor. They were armed with an effective anti-tank gun, and usually with one machine gun. Their somewhat crude construction meant that they were cheap and rather easy to build. To the Germans, these were only temporary solutions until better and more dedicated tank-hunters were developed, although this never became a full reality.\n\nProduction of such vehicles began to gain traction with the Marder II series. These were built using the Panzer II’s chassis. There were two versions, one armed with the German 7.5 cm and the other with a captured Soviet 7.62 cm gun. The production of the Marder II was halted in mid-1943 due to the shifting of resources towards other projects, such as the Wespe self-propelled artillery based on the same chassis.\n\nTo fill the gap, the reliable and well-proven Panzer 38(t)’s chassis was chosen as its successor. Based on this chassis, the Germans introduced three self-propelled anti-tank vehicles. These included the initial variant, known as the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.62 cm, armed with the 7.62 cm PaK 36(r) anti-tank gun, similar to the Marder II variant. The Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.62 cm had a relatively crude design, with a tall profile and inadequate armor protection for the crew manning the gun. The crew was particularly exposed to enemy fire due to the open superstructure.\n\nThe next in line was the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Ausf.H. This variant represented an improvement over the initial design. It was armed with the German 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 anti-tank gun. The superstructure of this variant was better protected compared to its predecessor, but it still remained lightly armored. Despite the enhancements, the crew remained somewhat exposed, albeit to a lesser extent than the earlier version. While it introduced many changes over its predecessors, there was still room for improvement. Further development led to the creation of the final Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 ‘Marder 38T’ Ausf.M variant.\n\nIn Foreign Service\n\nWhile the Germans exported their other anti-tank vehicles, such as the Jagdpanzer 38(t) and the StuG III (more precisely an assault gun, but often performing the same role) to their allies, they rarely did so with the much simpler and cheaper Marder series. The reason for this decision is unknown, but was probably related to the German’s own needs, and the relatively modest number of Marders built.\n\nThe first ally to receive 5 such vehicles, specifically the Marder II, was Hungary in early 1943. It would be more correctly said that the Germans actually lent them to Hungarians. These were temporarily given by the Germans to rebuild the shattered Hungarian 1st Armored Division. These achieved some success against Soviet armor, with the loss of three Marder IIs. The Hungarians were impressed with it and tried to make a copy based on their own Toldi light tank, but the project did not go beyond the prototype stage. In August 1944, the Germans reinforced the Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division with a battery of Marder vehicles. In addition, Allied forces employed captured Marders against the Germans on rare occasions.\n\nThe Slovak Republic and its Armed Forces\n\nIn late 1938, the political relations between Czechoslovakia and Germany worsened to the point that there was a real possibility that war would break out between these two countries. In September 1938, the Munich Agreement was signed between the Western Allies and Germany. It allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly German population. As a result of the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia lost a significant portion of its territory, including key defensive positions and industrial areas. In March 1939, Czechoslovakia was completely taken over by the Germans, which created the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Slovakia, under German pressure, declared independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939, the day before the German occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia.\n\nUnder German control, Slovakia was permitted to form an army that would include a small contingent of armored vehicles. In late 1939, thanks to German help, the Slovakian Army was able to form a tank battalion, which later changed to a regiment that was part of the Fast Armored Division. It was equipped mainly with equipment leftover from the former Czechoslovakian Army inventory. The Slovakian Army joined the Germans in their attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. After two years of heavy combat, nearly all of its armored forces were lost.\n\nIn 1944, the Slovakian Army attempted to rebuild its armored units. The main supplier of armored vehicles for the Slovakian Army was BMM (Böhmisch-Mährische Maschinenfabrik), the former ČKD (Českomoravská Kolben Daněk) company. Given their role as a minor German ally, Panzer 38(t) tanks and other obsolete equipment were obtained in limited numbers. In spring 1944, Slovak Army officials approached BMM with a request to acquire some of the Marder anti-tank vehicles. BMM agreed to deliver a group of 26 vehicles. With these, the Slovak officials had plans to increase the anti-tank capabilities of their meager tank force.\n\nProbably due to some German intervention or lack of resources, only 18 vehicles were ever allocated to the Slovak Army in July 1944. Unfortunately, the sources are not specific on the precise type of supplied vehicles. Given the time of the war, it can be assumed that most would have been Ausf.M and possibly some Ausf.H variants. This contingent included some new but also some rebuilt vehicles. In Slovak service, these received ‘V-300’ to ‘V-318’ serial numbers.\n\nCombat\n\nWith the arrival of Soviet forces from the east, Slovakia undertook preparations to set up defense positions at the Carpathian Mountains. Particularly strong defensive positions were to be established at the vital Dukla and Lupka passes. Thanks to the hilly and inaccessible terrain, strong defensive positions could be established there. For this operation, two infantry divisions supported by the Marders were allocated. After some time spent in crew training, the Marders were split into two companies (2nd and 3rd) and reached their designated positions in August 1944.\n\nEach of the two companies were divided into two three-vehicle strong platoons and one vehicle for the command platoon. In total, each had seven vehicles in their inventory. Of the remaining four, two were sent to reinforce the headquarters (HQ) of the first armored battalion. The last two remained in reserve at Turčiansky.\n\nIronically, these appear to have never seen action against the Soviets. On 29th August 1944, the Slovak Army rebelled against the Germans in the hope of liberating their country. Unfortunately for them, the Germans were prepared and crushed the insurgency relatively quickly. On 31st August, the Slovakian 2nd Company was captured in Ladomirov. The 3rd tried to escape but had to abandon their vehicles during the retreat.\n\nThe two Marders at the Turčiansky training base saw action against German tanks on 26th August 1944. At the end of the month, one vehicle was positioned at Strečnan Gorge. Thanks to the narrow pass, its crew managed to use the terrain to its advantage and destroy at least two German Panzer IVs. That vehicle was eventually lost, being hit by German anti-tank fire on 8th September 1944. The following day, the second vehicle was lost in the same manner.\n\nThe HQ of the First Armored Battalion, with its two vehicles, escaped and entrenched itself with Slovak partisans at the villages of Zlata, Bana, and Hermanovce. Besides the two Marders, they also had some light tanks in their inventory. After several days of fighting, the Germans finally managed to destroy this group, capturing the two Marders in the process. By May 1945, the victorious Allies reached Czechoslovakia, where the remnants of the German Army surrendered.\n\nAfter the War\n\nFollowing the end of the war in Europe, Czechoslovakia was re-established as a state, only this time under the political influence of the Soviet Union. On its territory, large stockpiles of abandoned German vehicles were still lying around. These would be gathered and, after evaluation, it would be decided whether some could be used again or sent to be scrapped. This included over 3,000 vehicles of various types, of which some 700 were scrapped or cannibalized for spare parts. In total, the new Czechoslovak Army managed to gather some 32 Marder 38T (Sd.Kfz.138) Ausf.M and H and 16 Marder 38T (Sd.Kfz.139). This number did not include vehicles that were damaged beyond repair. The total number of chassis may have been much higher.\n\nDespite availability in some numbers, the Marders had a very brief service life within the Czechoslovak Army. Some three Marder 38T Ausf.H and six Ausf.M vehicles were allocated for the defense of Prague as part of the 1st Tank Battalion in August 1945. The following year, the Czechoslovak Army made the decision to introduce to service some more of the captured German vehicles, such as the Jagdpanzer 38(t), which was designated ST-I. The ST-II designation was to be allocated to the surviving Marders. This was not to be. After analyzing their combat potential, they were deemed obsolete. These would be stored and later sent to be scrapped.\n\nUpgrade Project\n\nIn 1947, two Marder 38T Ausf.H and M were given to the Czechoslovak Military Technical Institute. These two would serve as a base for a potential new upgrade program that aimed to improve their combat performance. Both Škoda and ČKD were included in the realization of this project in 1948. While these two were completed, it appears that no photograph of them is known to have survived to this day. They remained in use as training vehicles at the Military Academy at Hranice up until 1950. After that, they were given to the civilian company Energostav to be used as improvised engineer vehicles for towing electrical towers to their installation sites. None of the Czechoslovak Marders are known to have survived the war.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Marder was the best-armored vehicle employed by the Slovak Army during the war. Despite being intended to fight off the Soviets, it instead fought the Germans. While most were abandoned or captured, at least two managed to inflict some damage on the Germans before being overrun. Despite being available in some numbers after the war, their use in Czechoslovakia was minimal, given their obvious obsolescence.\n\nPanzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Ausf.M Technical specifications\n\nCrew 4 (Commander, Gunner, Driver, Loader) Weight 10.150 tonnes Dimensions Length 5.02 m, Width 2.15 m, Height 2.35 m Engine Praga AC, 150 hp @ 2,800 rpm Speed 47 km/h | (off-road): 20 km/h Range 185 km | (off-road): 140 km Armament 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Armor 6 to 15 mm\n\nSources\n\nV.

It also represents the point when the general development and production of these and other armored combat vehicles took off on a massive scale. However, there are also many examples where, for various reasons, improvised vehicles were built. Germany was well known for implementing a large variety of unique vehicles in this manner, but they were not the only ones. The Yugoslavian communist Partisans, in the hope of salvaging any damaged tank, built some unusual hybrids that consisted of British-supplied US M3 light tanks armed with captured German weapons. While two variants are known to have been built, a third one is often mentioned in various sources, although there is no evidence to prove that it was ever built. This was an M3 light tank, allegedly armed with a mortar.\n\nThe M3 Light Tanks in the Balkans\n\nFollowing the quick conquest of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the April War (6th to 18th April 1941), its territories were divided between the victorious Axis forces. Due to the harsh and brutal occupation by the Axis troops stationed in Yugoslavia, by the second half of 1941, two resistance groups started a rebellion against the occupiers. These were the Royalist Chetniks and the Communist Partisans. In the beginning, these two groups worked together in the fight against the occupying Axis forces. The Chetniks were mostly Serbians (former soldiers) who wanted the King to return to power after the war. The Partisans, on the other hand, had members from nearly all nations of the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, etc.). They wanted to form a new communist government after the war. While these two shared a common enemy early on, due to the great political differences and different points of view on how to fight the enemy, a conflict between these two forces in late 1941 would break out into open civil war. This lasted until the end of the war and the victory of the Partisans.\n\nBy the end of 1943 and the start of 1944, the Communist Partisans were heavily involved in organizing several attacks on the German and their allies’ vital communication and supply lines, military bases and airfields, and other targets, inflicting increasing losses in men and materiel. While, initially, the Western Allies mainly supported the Chetnik movement, due to various reasons (including a lack of major military action against the Germans or even open collaboration with them), this attitude changed drastically from 1943 onwards. The Allies instead focused on supporting the ever-increasing Partisan movement by supplying them with ammunition, equipment, and specialized personnel to help train the Partisan ground forces.\n\nBesides these, Allied High Command agreed with the leader of the Partisans, Josip Broz Tito, to form a tank brigade that was to be equipped with Allied tanks and armored cars. The unit, named the First Tank Brigade, would be formed on 16th July 1944. The British supplied some 56 M3A1/A3 tanks, 24 AEC Mk.II armored cars and two M3A1 scout cars. The Partisan crews were previously sent to Italy to be trained in operating these vehicles. They also managed to salvage a few more damaged tanks from Allied repair facilities.\n\nThe first vehicles of this unit arrived in Yugoslavia in September 1944. Both Allied and improvised Partisan-operated transport ships were used to ferry these vehicles across the Adriatic from Italy to the Yugoslavian coastline. The First Tank Brigade would see extensive action against the Germans and their allies until the end of the war in May 1945.\n\nThe M3 Light Tank\n\nThe M3 Light Tank was designed in 1940 to replace the older and outdated M2 Light Tanks that were in service with the American armored forces. The M3 had many improvements over the M2, including thicker armor, stronger (due to the increase in weight) vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) with a bigger rear idler wheel, increased speed, and improved firepower consisting of four 7.62 mm machine guns and a 37 mm cannon. The first series was powered by the gasoline-fueled (petrol) Continental seven-cylinder four-cycle radial aircraft engine. After 1942, a new four-stroke diesel radial Guiberson A-1020 engine was used. It had a crew of four (driver, driver assistant, gunner, and commander). From March 1941 to August 1942, some 5,811 Stuarts with petrol engines and 1,285 with diesel engines were built. The much improved M3A1 version was produced from April 1942 onwards. The first batches of M3A1 tanks were built using riveted armor, but later models had welded armor. The changes included an improved turret design (the small commander cupola was removed) with two hatches, reducing the number of machine guns to three on later-built vehicles, and the addition of a turret basket.\n\nSoon after the M3A1, a new model, the M3A3, was made to address the poorly designed frontal armor and small fuel capacity of the first versions. The front and side armor of the Stuart M3A3 were angled and the front hatches for the driver and his assistant were replaced by new overhead ones. Due to the extra space that the Stuart M3A3 now had, it was possible to increase the fuel capacity. This version was produced until August 1943, with a total of 3,427 vehicles being built.\n\nRepair Facilities at Šibenik\n\nFollowing an engagement with the Germans, elements of the First Tank Brigade captured the city of Šibenik (located on the Adriatic coast of modern Croatia) on 3rd November 1944. Before the war, Šibenik had been a large naval shipyard and possessed many repair workshops. The Germans evacuated many machinery and tooling equipment and sabotaged those that could not be removed. Still, there was sufficient working equipment and materials left to meet the needs of the Partisan mechanics, who were in great need of such tools. Months spent fighting the Germans had greatly depleted the unit, which needed major overhauls on its vehicles. The fighting with the Germans had led to heavy tank losses. As there was no way to replenish lost tanks, the Partisans were forced to salvage and repair damaged vehicles whenever possible. Those that were damaged beyond repair were cannibalized for spare parts. The same was done with any captured vehicle or other equipment. Šibenik would remain one of the major Partisan bases for repairs and maintenance until the end of the war. In addition, it also served as a vital training ground for new Partisan tank crews from November 1944 onwards.\n\nDue to a high attrition rate, a great number of M3A1/A3 tanks were either lost or heavily damaged. Given the general lack of replacements, these had to be repaired to keep the whole unit operational. Some damaged vehicles saw their turrets removed completely and replaced with captured weapons. At least one (possibly up to three) vehicle was rearmed with a 7.5 cm PaK 40. It was installed (without the wheels and the trailing legs) on top of the M3 with some improvised armored sides, creating a bizarre vehicle somewhat similar to the German Marder tank hunter series. Two vehicles were armed with a 2 cm Flakvierling anti-aircraft gun. General information about these two vehicles are scarce and difficult to find, mainly as the Partisans kept a poor record of them. It is believed that their construction began either by the end of 1944 or in early 1945. Surprisingly, these three (or more is unclear) survived the war and remained in use for a few more years. Unfortunately, their final fates are unknown.\n\nThe M3 Mortar Armed Variant\n\nWhile there is enough evidence to prove the existence of these two variants, some unconfirmed sources mentioned the existence of at least two more modified vehicles. One of them was a mortar-armed variant. The existence of such a vehicle is often mentioned on various internet websites and even in books. In both cases, besides the basic information that it consisted of an M3 light tank with its turret removed and replaced with a mortar, nothing else is mentioned.\n\nIt is often impossible to verify the authenticity or claims of various internet sites with absolute certainty or credibility. Books, on the other hand, are generally more reliable and often give more detailed information and sometimes even a photograph that helps to remove these doubts. Of course, even books may sometimes be confusing, contradictory, or simply wrong.\n\nIn any case, the oldest (at least that was available to the author during the writing of this article) possible reference to this potential modification is the book called Od Tenka Do Brigade 1941 – 1945 (Eng. From Tank to Brigade) published in 1955. This book contains various anecdotes, stories, and descriptions of military operations and battles written after the war by witnesses and military personnel. On page 94 is an article entitled Tehnička služba Prve Tenkovske Brigade (Eng. Technical service of the First Tank Brigade). In it, author Major Anton Kurt praised the ingenuity and dedication of the Šibenik maintenance personnel. According to him, they managed to modify two vehicles, with one being armed with a 7.5 cm anti-tank and the second with 2 cm anti-aircraft guns. In addition, in the same book, there is a photograph that the citation claimed to be the modified M3 light tank.\n\nThe same vehicle is also mentioned by authors P. Zakonović and U. Janjetović (Tehnička Služba u Narodno Oslobodilačkom Ratu 1941-1945). In this book, published in 1987, it is described that one vehicle was built and equipped with an 82 mm mortar.\n\nWas it Real?\n\nAre these written books enough evidence to support the idea that at least one M3 was armed with a mortar? The first thing that needs to be analyzed is the context of the provided information of these two sources, starting with the first book, which was written to mark the tenth anniversary of the end of the war in Yugoslavia. While it gives several interesting pieces of information about the M3 modifications, they are somewhat too general and lack more specific construction details or production numbers.\n\nThe first problem with this book is that the previously mentioned photograph is not what it is described. It is not a tank, but instead, another mysterious vehicle of unclear origin that consisted of a modified German Sd.Kfz.251 half-track armed with two 120 mm mortars. While this vehicle was operated by the Partisans, it was likely built by the Germans at some point in the war. Placing one large 120 mm caliber mortar inside an M3 tank was an impossible task due to the limited space, let alone two of them. It is unknown if the publisher who prepared this book misidentified the vehicle or was wrongly informed. In either case, this is a good indication that this vehicle was not real.\n\nThe second point worth considering is that two facts mentioned by Major Anton Kurt in his writings cast doubt on his knowledge in this field. Firstly, he praises the Partisans mechanics who managed to install the larger 7.5 cm gun on top of the M3 without proper expertise and with limited available resources. Interestingly, he particularly praised the fact that, during firing, the vehicle did not move backward due to the powerful recoil. However, author D. Predoević (Oklopna vozila i oklopne postrojbe u drugom svjetskom ratu u Hrvatsko) claims the opposite.\n\nAccording to him, the whole installation was rather clumsy as, during firing, the whole vehicle would be pushed back several meters due to the extensive recoil of the 7.5 cm gun. He also mentioned that the vehicle was raised slightly up in the air during the firing of the main armament. German Marder anti-tank vehicles, when firing the same gun, did have some recoil issues, but could remain stationary. Of course, these were properly built vehicles (albeit still somewhat of an improvisation) built with better tools and equipment. Either one of these two authors is wrong or some vital information or context is missing.\n\nIn addition, Major Anton Kurt also described that the same partisans took a 22-tonne tank that had its 37 mm gun replaced with a much larger 57 mm taken from the AEC II armored car. This was, in fact, not a Stuart but a Somua S35 which weighed a few tonnes less than the Major stated. However, this can be considered only a slight oversight. While these are some curious contradictions, all this does not mean that Major Anton Kurt was completely wrong in his writing. It is important to consider that he wrote in the spirit of the post-war period, where the Partisan struggle had significant political influence, was extensively used as propaganda, and achieved a somewhat mythological status. So while helpful and containing many interesting bits of information, this book should also be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe second book that mentions the existence of this mortar-armed vehicle only does so briefly. Besides the modification, only the alleged caliber of the mortar is mentioned. This does not help much, as it gives no more context or information about its overall design. In addition, it mentions that, in total, 7 M3s were modified with various weapons. It is known from photographic evidence that at least three vehicles were built. One and up to three were armed with the 7.5 cm gun and two with 2 cm anti-aircraft guns. The number of the former conversions is often confusing in the sources, as they sometimes wrongly include the Howitzer Motor Carriage M8s armed with the 75 mm howitzer developed and built by the Americans in total. Between 7 and 9 such vehicles were supplied to the Partisans during April 1945.\n\nAnother vital aspect of this vehicle that needs to be considered is the main armament itself. According to the photograph in the first book, the two mortars shown were obviously larger caliber than the 82 mm suggested in the second book. The Partisans had used many versions of mortars of different calibers. If such a conversion using an 82 mm mortar was really built, then which precise type it was would be almost impossible to know. Yugoslavia was a battlefield where weapons from all warring parties were used.\n\nIt is known that these two mortars were actually of 120 mm caliber. These are easily identified, as the use of such larger caliber mortars was limited to the Soviet Union and Germany. In this case, it was the 12 cm Granatwerfer 378(r), which was basically a direct copy of the Soviet PM-38. Using the larger caliber mortar makes more sense due to their stronger firepower, larger ammunition and greater range.\n\nMore modern authors, for example, B. B. Dimitrijević and D. Savić (Oklopne jedinice na Jugoslovenskom ratištu 1941-1945) and D. Predoević (Oklopna vozila i oklopne postrojbe u drugom svjetskom ratu u Hrvatsko) do not mention that the M3 were ever modified in this manner. Furthermore, B. B. Dimitrijević explains that the alleged M3 mortar vehicle never existed and that it was simply mistaken with the half-track contraption armed with the two mortars.\n\nWhat Would It Have Looked Like?\n\nGiven that there is no reference or mention of its alleged design, it is only possible to speculate at this point. In general, during the Second World War, none of the warring nations even bothered producing self-propelled vehicles based on a tank chassis that were armed with mortars for indirect fire support. Germany and the US Army employed half-tracks for this role, as they were cheaper and more easily available than proper tanks.\n\nHowever, the Germans did make some field modifications on at least one tank for this role. The occupying forces stationed in France had plenty of captured tanks that were lying around. While pressed into service for various auxiliary tasks, by 1944, these were obsolete as frontline combat tanks. At least one AMR 35 light tank was modified by removing its turret and placing an 82 mm mortar on top of it. For crew protection, an extended superstructure was added. How many were rebuilt is unknown, but at least one vehicle survived and it could serve as a reference point for the M3 mortar conversion. However, it is important to note that these two conversions are completely unrelated and serve only as speculative comparisons.\n\nThe 8 cm Schwerer Granatwerfer 34 auf Panzerspähwagen AMR 35(f), as it is now known, had its mortar base bolted down to the AMR superstructure. This was done to provide a stable firing platform. The Partisans would have likely done the same, either using welding or more probably bolts. Other modifications such as changing the shape of the mortar stabilizing legs may also have been done. It is unlikely that they would have tried to squeeze the mortar inside the M3’s cramped interior due to the limited size of the turret ring. Instead, it would have been partially placed on top of the tank superstructure. Some armor would have been added to provide some rudimentary protection for the crew. Lastly, an ammunition storage bin had to be added, either stored inside or on top of the vehicle.\n\nThe other overall characteristics, such as ammunition load and number of crew members could only be speculated. The 82 mm mortar ammunition was rather small in size and it should not have been a problem to store a lot of it inside or on top of the tank. The crew would have hypothetically consisted of a commander, gunner, loader, and driver.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the presented information, the whole M3 armed with a mortar variant appears to be nothing more than a wrongly identified photograph that led to confusion during the early years after the war. As there is no reliable information or a photograph that would confirm the existence of this vehicle, it is probable it never existed.\n\nThe Partisans in the Šibenik workshop certainly had the technical knowledge and equipment to make this modification. The question is if they would actually have done that and whether it would have been worth the effort and time spent. Given the M3’s weak firepower, it would have benefited them greatly to construct another vehicle armed with an anti-tank or other kind of direct-fire gun. Placing an 82 mm mortar on the M3 tanks would simply have been a waste of limited resources.\n\nLight Tank M3A3 with Mortar Technical Specifications\n\nEngine Continental 7-cylinder petrol 250 hp air-cooled Armament One 82 mm or larger mortar Armor 13 to 51 mm\n\nSources\n\nB.

In response to this, the Germans introduced the new 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun in 1942. While effective, problems were its weight and lack of towing vehicles, which often led to losses that could have been avoided. In response, the Germans mounted these guns on any available chassis, creating a series of vehicles best known today by their nickname Marder (Eng. Marten). One of these was the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3, of which nearly 1,000 vehicles were built.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Second World War, Germany spent time and resources on developing a large tank force. However, due to rather limited industrial production capabilities, many shortcuts and temporary solutions had to be implemented. This can be best seen in the armor and armament of these early Panzers. The campaigns in Poland and later in the West were won not by firepower but by better tactics and organization. This gave the Germans a sense of false superiority which, to some extent, slowed down the rearmament projects. During Operation Barbarossa, the Panzer Divisions were once again spearheading the German advance. Initially, the lightly protected Soviet tanks such as the BT series and the T-26 proved to be easy prey for the advancing German Panzers. However, the Panzer crews were shocked to discover that their guns were mostly ineffective against the armor of the newer T-34 and the KV series.\n\nGerman infantry units also discovered that their 3.7 cm PaK 36 towed anti-tank guns were of limited use against these. The stronger 5 cm PaK 38 towed anti-tank gun was only effective at shorter distances and it had not been produced in great numbers by that time. Luckily for the Germans, the new Soviet tanks were plagued by not-yet-matured designs, inexperienced crews, a lack of spare parts and ammunition, and poor operational use. Nevertheless, they played a significant role in slowing down and eventually stopping the German assault in late 1941. In North Africa, the Germans also faced increasing numbers of Matilda tanks which also proved to be hard to knock out.\n\nThe experience gained during the first year of the invasion of the Soviet Union raised a red alert in the highest German military circles. To combat these new threats, the Germans rushed to introduce the new 7.5 cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun into service. After 1942, it became the standard German anti-tank gun used until the end of the war, with some 20,000 guns being built.\n\nThe PaK 40 was an excellent anti-tank gun, but its main problem was its heavy weight, making it somewhat difficult to deploy and hard to manhandle. The Germans went for the most simple solution and tried to improve its mobility by placing it on a series of obsolete tank chassis. These new Panzerjäger (Eng. Anti-tank) vehicles followed the same pattern: most were open-topped, with limited gun traverse, and thin armor. They were armed with an effective anti-tank gun, and usually with one machine gun. Their somewhat primitive construction meant that they were cheap and rather easy to build. To the Germans, these were only temporary solutions until better and more dedicated tank-hunters were developed.\n\nMarder 38T’s Development\n\nProduction of these anti-tank vehicles began to gain traction with the Marder II series. These were built using the Panzer II‘s chassis. There were two versions, one armed with the German 7.5 cm and the other with a captured Soviet 7.62 cm gun. Both variants were used to bolster the anti-tank capabilities of the German army, especially in situations where heavier tanks were not readily available. However, the production of the Marder II was halted in mid-1943 due to the shifting of resources towards other projects, such as the Wespe self-propelled artillery based on the same chassis.\n\nTo fill the gap, the reliable and well-proven Panzer 38(t) chassis was chosen as its successor. The TNH – LT vz.38 tanks, as they were originally known, were developed and built by the Czechoslovak ČKD company (Českomoravská Kolben Daněk) in the second half of the 1930s. Production of the vz.38 began in late 1938 but, by the time of the German annexation of Czech territory, not a single tank had been handed over to the Czech Army. Germany captured many brand new vz.38 tanks and, in May 1939, a delegation was sent to the ČKD factory to examine their operational potential. The Germans were so impressed with this tank that it was quickly introduced into Wehrmacht service under the name Panzer 38(t) (the ‘t’ stands for Tschechoslowakei, Czechoslovakia in German). The ČKD factory was completely taken over for the needs of the German Army under the new name BMM (Böhmisch-Mährische Maschinenfabrik).\n\nThe Panzer 38(t) was built in relatively large numbers, seeing combat from the invasion of Poland to the end of the war, and was considered an effective tank for its class. But, from late 1941 onwards, it was obvious that it was becoming obsolete in the role of a first-line combat tank. The Panzer 38(t) chassis, on the other hand, was mechanically reliable and highly suitable for other purposes, a fact which the Germans exploited to the maximum by developing a series of auxiliary vehicles, like tank destroyers or self-propelled artillery.\n\nBased on this chassis, the Germans introduced three self-propelled anti-tank vehicles. These included the initial variant, known as the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.62 cm. It was armed with the 7.62 cm PaK 36(r) anti-tank gun, similar to the aforementioned Marder II variant. It had a relatively crude design, with a tall profile and inadequate armor protection for the crew manning the gun. The crew was particularly exposed to enemy fire due to the open superstructure The next in line was the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Ausf.H. This variant represented an improvement over the initial design. It was armed with the German 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 anti-tank gun. The superstructure of this variant was better protected compared to its predecessor, but it still remained lightly armored. Despite the enhancements, the crew remained somewhat exposed, albeit to a lesser extent than the earlier version.\n\nWhile the Panzerjäger 38(t) für 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Ausf.H introduced many changes over its predecessors, there was still room for improvements. In early 1943, BMM began working on creating an improved superstructure for the next version of this anti-tank vehicle series. The primary goal of the redesign was to increase the stability of the vehicle during firing of the gun. The new rear-mounted superstructure provided better protection for the crew and allowed for more stable operation of the anti-tank gun. Moving the engine compartment to the middle of the vehicle created more space for the crew and the gun mount. This arrangement allowed the crew to operate the gun while standing, improving their comfort and effectiveness during combat. Additionally, it reduced the gun overhang and improved the overall balance of the vehicle, both during movement and firing. Placing the driver in a separate compartment at the front of the vehicle provided increased protection and ensured better concentration on driving duties without distraction from the crew operating the anti-tank gun. Last but probably most important were the efforts that were made to standardize the chassis so that it could be utilized for various roles, including anti-aircraft and self-propelled artillery. This approach aimed to optimize production efficiency and logistics by using a common platform for multiple purposes. The prototype was completed and presented to the German Army officials in February 1943.\n\nDesignation\n\nDuring its service life, this self-propelled anti-tank gun was known under several different names. Starting from May 1943, it was referred to as 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 auf. Sfl.38 (Ausf.M) Motorn vorn (Eng. Front engine). Normally, an alphabetical designation was used by the Germans to designate changes implemented on that particular armored vehicle series (for example Panzer IV Ausf.A, B, etc.). For the Marder vehicles, this alphabetical designation had a slightly different meaning. The previous version was designated Ausf.H and the capital letter referred to the position of the engine, in this case, Heckmotor (Eng. Rear-Mounted). In some sources, the Ausf.M designation referred to the German word Mitte (Eng. Middle).\n\nIn July 1943, this was replaced by the much simpler Panzerjäger 38 designation. The designation Marder III was suggested by Hitler himself in November 1943. The following month, the Sd.Kfz.139 numerical designation was allocated to this vehicle.\n\nHowever, in September 1944, the last known change to its designation was implemented, when it was known as 7.5 cm PaK 40/3 Sf. Marder 38T. This particular designation was authorized by Heinz Guderian Himself. Authors T. L. Jentz and H. L. Doyle (No.7-2 Panzerjäger) point out that the Marder III name, while a suggested designation for this series (based on the Panzer 38(t)), was never used commonly by the frontline troops. Thus for the sake of simplicity, a more correct designation would be Marder 38T, which this article will be using.\n\nProduction\n\nAs the final design was accepted, the production of the first Marder 38T began in May 1943. The production was carried out by B.M.M. The following production numbers are according to T. L. Jentz and H. L. Doyle.\n\nMarder 38T production 1943 1944 January / 67 February / 72 March / 64 April / 59 May 20 46 June 45 July 90 August 62 September 101 October 141 November 100 December 75 Total 942\n\nVariations in monthly production numbers are attributed to a lack of materials. In addition, some of the production facilities and chassis were allocated to the Flakpanzer 38(t) project. Vehicles built from May to October 1943 were constructed using the Panzer 38(t) Ausf.K chassis, while the remaining used the Ausf.M chassis.\n\nNot surprisingly, like many other German vehicles, production numbers differ slightly between the sources. For example, D. Nešić (Naoružanje Drugog Svetsko Rata-Nemačka) gives a slightly higher number, at 974. These were built between April 1943 to May 1944. Older sources, such as U. Feist and M. Dario (Panzerjäger in Action) give a much lower number, with over 800 vehicles being built. H.L. Doyle and C.K. Kliment (Czechoslovak armored fighting vehicles 1918-1945) mention 975 built.\n\nGiven their expertise and the detailed research they have undertaken, we can say with some certainty that the numbers presented by T. L. Jentz and H. L. Doyle were the correct ones. The previously mentioned sources are somewhat older and in recent years more research was done to give us more accurate numbers. In any case, the production of the Marder 38T stopped in May 1944, as the Germans shifted the focus to procuring and manufacturing the better-protected Jagdpanzer 38(t).\n\nDesign\n\nHull\n\nThe new Marder 38T was built using the Panzer 38(t) chassis with a redesigned superstructure. The originally rear-positioned engine compartment was moved to the center of the vehicle, creating a rear-positioned fighting compartment. To the right front side, the fully enclosed driver compartment was located, and in front of it was the transmission unit.\n\nThe glacis armor that protected the front-positioned transmission was placed at a high angle. It retained the large hatch, which provided the crew with easier access to the brake and transmission assemblies (in case of emergency and repair). It was protected by an extended ‘U’ shaped splash ring. The hull and the remaining parts of this vehicle body were constructed using armored plates riveted or, to a smaller extent, welded together.\n\nThe modified chassis of the Panzer 38(t) used for the Marder 38T was later used also for the 15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) Grille self-propelled gun and the Flakpanzer 38(t).\n\nSuspension and Running Gear\n\nThe suspension of the Marder 38T was mostly unchanged in comparison to that of a normal Panzer 38(t). It consisted of four road wheels with split rubber tires with a diameter of 775 mm. The use of large-diameter wheels was meant to reduce wear on the rubber tires. These wheels were connected in pairs and were suspended using semi-elliptical leaf springs units. In addition, there was a front drive sprocket, rear idler, and two return rollers per side. The only visible difference was the reduction of the number of return rollers from four in total to only two (with one on each side).\n\nDuring the production, the sprocket wheels and idler wheels were modified to speed up production. The sprocket lost its characteristic holes while the idler wheels received different ones. The dry pin track links were 293 mm wide and counted 93 per side. The ground pressure was 0.70 kg/cm3.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nDuring its production history, the Marder 38T was powered by three different engine types. From May to July 1943, the first Marders were equipped with the older Praga EPA AC/2600 6-cylinder water-cooled engine, delivering 150 hp ​​at 2,600 rpm. This was a licensed production of the Swedish Scania-Vabis Typ 1664 and had a volume of 7,754 cm³.\n\nFrom July to November 1943, a more powerful version, known as Praga Ausf.IV was installed. This version had a maximum power output of 180 hp at 2,800 rpm, but because of the aluminum head block, under stress or due to a lack of proper maintenance, the pistons would blow the head gaskets. From November 1943 to May 1944, a newer 6-cylinder Praga Typ NS with double Solex 46 FNUP carburetors was installed on the Marders. The last engine gave out 160 hp at 2,600 rpm. The fuel capacity was 218 liters placed in two tanks on the sides of the engine, protected by a bulkhead. A large ventilation grill was placed on the right side of the engine compartment.\n\nThe on-road consumption was 120 liters for 100 km with the Praga EPA AC engine. This means that, with this early engine version, the vehicle had a maximum range on-road of 180 km. Off-road, the fuel consumption was 160 liters per 100 km, meaning that the maximum range was reduced to 135 km.\n\nThe gearbox was a Praga-Wilson TN-100 TNHP with 5 gears + rear gear. The gearbox was placed frontally and connected to the engine with a cardan shaft.\n\nThe muffler was located at the rear of the superstructure, protected by a perforated metal sheet. The pipe connecting the engine to the muffler passed, in early models, through the inside of the fighting chamber while, on late production models, it exited through the ventilation grille on the right side of the vehicle and ran alongside the superstructure externally.\n\nThe radiator was placed behind the engine and had 64 liters of water at its disposal. To start the engine, the crew could rely on a Bosch BPD 3/12 starter with a power of 2.5 kW or a crank connected to a Bosch controller.\n\nTo start the engine at low temperatures, on early production models, there were two pegs placed on the rear to hold a 2-cylinder petrol engine to heat the engine. On later models, a port for an engine coolant heater was added on the right side of the rear.\n\nSuperstructure\n\nWhile the previous Marders used a slightly changed Panzer 38 superstructure, the Marder 38T incorporated a completely new one. The thick armor plates that characterized the previous Marder Ausf.H model were substituted with thinner ones. Also, the vehicle’s shapes were changed. The machine gunner’s position on the left side was removed, along with his machine gun, leaving only the driver at the front of the hull.\n\nThe driver had at his disposal a driving port with bulletproof glass with dimensions of 170 x 40 mm and a thickness of 50 mm. Over his head, he had a two-part hatch to enter and exit from his position. On the front vertical transmission cover, there were two towing hooks and a spare track links rack. On the left-angled plate was the Notek night driving device, an inspection hatch for the transmission, and another spare track link rack.\n\nThe left side of the front was angled, increasing the theoretical thickness of armored plates. The engine compartment was placed in the middle of the chassis, dividing the driver’s position from the rest of the crew. On top of this compartment, two large inspection hatches were placed for maintenance. The gun travel lock was fixed on the engine deck.\n\nLastly, the fighting compartment was located at the rear of the vehicle. Thanks to the position of the engine in the middle, the engine compartment floor was lowered compared to previous Marders.\n\nThe main gun was placed in the middle, with a rounded gun shield that permitted limited traverse. It was protected by an armored superstructure without a roof and with a partially protected rear.\n\nOn the gun shield and superstructure’s sides were a total of four supports for periscopes for the crew members. On the interior’s right side were the radio apparatus and a 12-round rack, while on the left side there were, starting from the front: a 3-round rack, the anti-aircraft machine gun support, and a 12-round rack.\n\nThe equipment fixed inside the superstructure was completed by a gas mask, a submachine gun for self-defense, a fire extinguisher, spare periscopes, machine gun ammunition boxes, and maintenance kits. Attached ton the fenders were sapper and repair tools such as crowbars, axes, shovels, a jack, a small toolbox, and the rods for the waterproof tarpaulin. The barrel cleaning kit was on the engine deck.\n\nFor the medium machine gun, there was a crossbar over the fighting compartment, fixed on both sides of the superstructure. The machine gun was mounted on a special sliding support to increase its traverse range against low-flying air targets or approaching infantry.\n\nOn the rear of the side walls of the superstructure, two rods could be misidentified with radio antennas. These rods were for the waterproof tarpaulin. They maintained the tarpaulin horizontally, increasing the internal volume and permitting the loader to operate standing up, even with the tarpaulin.\n\nArmor Protection\n\nIn contrast to the previous two Panzer 38(t) based Marders, the armor of the Marder 38T was sensibly decreased, putting more emphasis on the mobility and speed of the vehicle at the expense of protection.\n\nWhile the previous tank destroyers on the same chassis maintained the armor of the Panzer 38(t) Ausf.F, with a maximum thickness of 50 mm on the front glacis and transmission cover, the Marder 38T reduced the thickness to 15 mm. The chassis armored plates were all 15 mm thick except the rear one, which was 10 mm thick.\n\nThe driver’s compartment was 15 mm thick too, with the roof and engine deck protected by 8 mm thick armored plates. The angled plate placed on the driver’s left was angled at 67° and 10 mm thick in early production models. For late production ones, its thickness was increased to 15 mm. The whole gun shield and fighting compartment superstructure were made of 10 mm thick armored plates that protected the crew from small arms fire and artillery splinters.\n\nThe overall protection was adequate to defend the crew in case of enemy infantry attack at short ranges. Unfortunately, it was not adequate to protect the vehicle from anything more powerful than a light infantry weapon. In fact, the Marder 38Ts were vulnerable to fire from ground attack aircraft, such as US P-47 Thunderbolts or Soviet Il-2 Sturmoviks, which could easily destroy them even with just their wing-mounted automatic weapons.\n\nThe total weight of the vehicle was 10.15 tonnes compared to the 10.80 tonnes of the Marder III Ausf.H, increasing the overall mobility of the vehicle.\n\nPrimary Armament\n\nThe main armament chosen for the Marder 38T was the standard 7.5 cm PanzerabwehrKanone 40/3 (Eng. Anti-Tank Gun) L/46, specifically developed for the Marder IIIs chassis. The maximum firing range was 7,700 m with High Explosive. The operational life of the barrel was 6,000 rounds and the gun could reach a rate of fire of 10 to 15 rounds per minute with a well-trained loader thanks to the semi-automatic sliding block. The total weight of the gun with gun shield is unknown, but it was probably not far from the 750 kg of the 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48 of the later variants of Panzer IVs.\n\nThe gun was placed in the center of the vehicle, above the engine’s radiator. The elevation of the main gun was -8° to +6° and the traverse 25° to the left and 25° to the right. In order to relieve the stress on the elevation and traverse mechanisms during long drives, two travel locks were added, one on the engine deck, while the second, called Rohrstuetze (Eng. Barrel Support) was fixed to the cradle inside the fighting compartment.\n\nThe gunner had at his disposal a PanzerabwehrKanone Zielfernrohr 38 8×3 (Eng.: Anti-Tank Gun Telescopic Sight 8×3) produced by Zeiss, with a magnification up to 3x and a visibility arc of 8°. The reticle was graded at intervals of 100 m up to 2,000 m for armor piercing rounds, and up to 1,000 m for HEAT rounds.\n\nSecondary Armament\n\nFor short-range air defense and self-defense against approaching enemy infantry, the Marder 38T was equipped with a medium machine gun produced by Mauser, being either an MG 34 or an MG 42.\n\nBoth machine guns were chambered with 7.92 x 57 mm Mauser rounds and were fed by 250-round belts. The firing rate was 1,000 rounds per minute for the first and 1,200 rounds per minute for the latter.\n\nThe machine gun could be placed on the crossbar over the superstructure to fire against enemy aircraft or on the front of the superstructure to engage enemy infantry. In case of necessity, the machine gun could also be used on the ground thanks to a carried bipod.\n\nAlso for self-defense or in case the vehicle had been destroyed, there was a Maschinenpistole (Eng. Submachine Gun) Model 1938 or 1940 placed under the gun trunnion. However, it was not so uncommon for the crew to carry other personal weapons on board, such as rifles or submachine guns for close defense.\n\nAmmunition\n\nThe total ammunition load consisted of 38 rounds placed in four racks: a three-round rack was placed on the superstructure’s left, followed by a second one with 12 rounds. On the right was another 12-round rack, while the 11-round rack was placed under the gun breech. On Befehlsjäger 38T, the ammunition reserve was reduced to 26 rounds, removing the right side rack.\n\nAmmunition for the PaK 40/3 Name Panzergranate 1939 (PzGr. 39) Panzergranate 1940 (PzGr. 40) Sprenggranate 1934 (SprGr. 34) Hohlladung pattern C grenades. (Gr.38 HL/C) Type APCBC-HE-T APCR HE HEAT Muzzle velocity (m/s) 790 990 550 450 Weight (kg) 6.80 4.05 5.74 4.57 Penetration (RHA angled 0° from vertical) 150 mm at 100 m; 110 mm at 1000 m 175 mm at 100 m; 140 mm at 1000 m // 80 mm\n\nBeing derived directly from the PaK 40, the main gun of the Marder 38T fired the standard round for the field version of the anti-tank gun, with a cartridge length of 75×714 mm R instead of the shorter version for the KwK40, which was 75×495 mm R.\n\nIn addition, the vehicle had six ammunition boxes for the machine gun on board, with a total of 1,500 rounds, and six magazines for Maschinenpistole, for a total of 192 9×19 mm rounds.\n\nCrew\n\nThe Marder 38T had a crew of four soldiers. In the hull was only the driver, placed on the right side and separated from the rest of the crew. The other three crew members were placed in the fighting compartment, at the rear of the vehicle.\n\nThe gunner was on the left side of the gun breech, the commander on the right side and the loader operated standing up behind the gun breech. Communication between the driver and commander was made via an intercom system connected to the radio apparatus.\n\nRadio Equipment and Electrical System\n\nThe Marder 38T was equipped with a Funksprech Gerät Ausführung D (Eng. Radio Speaker Device Model D), also abbreviated to FuG. D or Fu.Spr. D or Fu.Spr. Ausf.D. This model was specially developed for tank destroyers.\n\nThe radio had 10 channels and an operating frequency between 23.11 to 24.01 MHz, with a range of 5 km when stationary and 2 km when moving. The radio apparatus was placed on the right side of the superstructure, under the intercom system. The batteries and speaker were placed under the gun trunnion.\n\nThe Stabantenne (Eng. Rod Antenna) was placed on the side of the superstructure and was 1.4 meters long. There were a total of two headphones coupled with throat microphones, one for the driver and one in the fighting compartment, for the commander.\n\nOn the Befehlsjäger 38T (Eng.: Command Tank Destroyer 38T), the radio apparatus also included a Funk Gerät 8 or FuG. 8 medium-wave transceiver. The FuG. 8 was composed of a receiver and transmitter coupled together. The transmitter was a Transmitter Typ A with an operating frequency between 1,130 to 3,000 kHz.\n\nThe Receiver could be either a Receiver Typ C or Typ D. The first one had an operating frequency between 580 to 3,000 kHz and the latter had a frequency between 835 to 3,000 kHz.\n\nThe maximum range of the radio station was 50 km in telegraphic mode and 15 km in voice mode when stationary. During moving, the maximum telegraphic range was 40 km and the maximum voice range was 10 km.\n\nThe FuG. 8 was equipped with a Sternantenne Typ D (Eng. Star Antenna Type D) with a length of 1.8 meters, mounted on a support of porcelain on the right of the superstructure.\n\nTo accommodate the FuG. 8 radio apparatus, the total number of rounds transported by the vehicle was decreased. The Fu.Spr. D was used to connect the various vehicles of a Panzerjäger Abteilungen (Eng. Anti-tank battalions), while the FuG. 8 was deployed by the unit’s commander to contact the divisional headquarter.\n\nIn case of malfunction of the radio apparatus, the crew was also equipped with a set of flags and with a Walther Leuchtpistole 34 flare gun with 12 rounds.\n\nThe electrical system was supplied by a Bosch Typ 12B110P lead battery with a tension of 12 V and a power of 110 Ah. The battery was connected to a Bosch GQLN 300 12-19 generator with a power of 300 Watt. This battery also powered the Notek night driving device, the horn, the dashboard, and the radio apparatus.\n\nOrganization and Unit Distribution\n\nInitially, the Marders were used to form small 9-vehicle strong Panzerjäger Kompanie (Eng. anti-tank company). These were divided into 3-vehicle strong platoons. By the end of 1942, the number of vehicles per company had increased by one more vehicle. The single-added vehicle was used as a command unit which was, on s"
