        "text": "Founding Executive Vice President and CFO Robert Lowry is retiring from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust on June 30 after a 24-year tenure. In May 1998, Bob became the Trust’s fourth employee and immediately set to work creating the organization’s financial and operational framework. He led efforts to set up offices in Indianapolis and Phoenix, develop organizational policies and procedures, recruit staff and begin preparing the Trust’s investment policy statement.\n\n“The biggest surprise and gift I received upon arriving at the Trust in October of 1998 was to meet Bob and to learn of all of the initial financial and organizational work he had done since joining the Trust five months earlier,” said Harriet Ivey, founding president and CEO of the Trust. “It was a gift that kept giving for the 15 years we collaborated together.”\n\nBob began his career in public accounting in 1980 at Price Waterhouse, where he eventually rose to senior manager. From there, he joined Central Newspapers Inc., serving as director of accounting and corporate controller. Nina Mason Pulliam and her husband, Eugene C. Pulliam, owned and operated CNI and through it built the fortune that would endow her future trust. Upon Mrs. Pulliam’s death, the Trust was established in her name with an approximate $350 million bequest.\n\nBob advised the founding board of trustees in developing the Trust’s first investment policies and hiring investment consultants. Throughout the years, and bolstered by earning the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 2008, Bob helped guide trustees to diversify and strengthen the organization’s investment portfolio and refine investment policies. He counts this as his proudest work during his career at the Trust. Under his financial stewardship and that of the board of trustees, the Trust’s endowment grew to more than $500 million by December 2021.\n\n“I think Bob’s most valuable contribution was that as the Trust’s investment portfolio grew in size and diversity, so did he,” said Trustee Chair Carol Peden Schilling. “His wisdom and oversight guided us, along with our professional investment advisory firm, to develop a sizable and extremely well-managed portfolio that has weathered at least two serious market downturns and has rebounded to health and prosperity. As trustees, we are very pleased because our goal is to help the nonprofits in our communities as much as humanly possible. Bob has made that a reality.”\n\nSince its inception, the Trust has awarded over $353 million in grants and scholarships to over 1,000 nonprofit organizations in Arizona and Indiana.\n\n“Bob has carefully and successfully managed our investments while also expertly managing our internal finances,” said Trustee Kent E. Agness. “He has been a valuable advisor and friend to us all.”\n\nBob is particularly proud of his role in helping develop the Nina Mason Pulliam Legacy Scholars program. Established in 2001, the scholarship program provides financial support, guided mentorship and coordinated services for nontraditional students, including adults with dependents, students who were in the foster care system and individuals with physical disabilities. Nina Scholars graduate at rates equal to or greater than their traditional student peers who do not face similar challenges.\n\n“Bob’s impact can be found across the Trust’s signature Nina Scholars Legacy Scholarship program. He was integral in creating and sustaining our nationally recognized program that serves student populations previously overlooked by traditional scholarship outreach,” said Trustee Lisa Shover Kackley. “Bob worked diligently with our four partner schools in Arizona and Indiana, ensuring Trust funds are maximized to reach as many Nina Scholars as possible. He has been instrumental in bringing the dream of a college degree to nearly 400 Nina Scholars and we are all grateful for his contributions.”\n\n“I love the Nina Scholars program. It has to be one of the best programs the Trust has ever created. It’s been a joy to watch over the years as the lives of hundreds of scholars were changed forever because they were able to pursue their education,” said Bob.\n\nIn addition to his portfolio management role, Bob also directed the Trust’s financial, accounting, tax, budget, risk management and human resources departments. In January, Bob transitioned to Chief Investment Officer, and the Trust appointed Controller Ryan Hammons as CFO.\n\n“It’s amazing to reflect on the last nearly 25 years and see how much the Trust has grown and evolved. Bob’s leadership and guidance was instrumental in positioning the Trust where it is today. Bob helped establish a strong foundation that we will build upon for the remaining 25 years of the Trust,” said CFO Ryan Hammons.\n\nUpon retirement, Bob and his wife, Kathy, plan to travel and enjoy more time with their children and grandchildren. Bob also hopes to spend more time on the golf course and is contemplating trying his hand at vintage car restoration.\n\n“It is impossible to overstate Bob’s impact on the Trust,” said Trust President and CEO Gene D’Adamo. “It goes far beyond investments, finances and operations. Bob’s passion for the people and causes we serve, dedication to preserving Nina’s legacy and total commitment to making the Trust an outstanding place to work are his legacy. Our communities and our organization are better due, in large part, to Bob. It has been an honor working with him these past nine years.”\n\nReflecting on his long career at the Trust, Bob concludes, “When we were setting up this foundation, we wanted to live up to what we thought Nina would expect of her Trust – hire high-performing people with high standards and make a big impact. I think we did that, and I think Nina would be proud of what we built and how we performed. I’m extremely pleased with where the Trust is today.”\n\nThank you, Bob, for your long dedication to the Trust. We wish you well in your retirement."
