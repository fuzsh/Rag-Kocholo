        "text": "Just as the rural camp meetings in the early decades of the 19th century produced the popular \"camp songs\", the urban revivals in the latter decades brought forth the popular church song - the gospel hymn. This genre emerged in the 1870's especially in collections designed for America's rapidly growing Sunday Schools. Lowell Mason, William Bradbury, and Robert Lowry were leading composers of Sunday School music. Lowry (1826-1899), a Baptist Pastor, served as editor of Sunday School songbooks for the New York firm of Biglow and Main. Among his many lasting hymnsongs are \"Shall We Gather at the River\", \"I Need Three Every Hour\", and the subject of his composition, \"Nothing But The Blood of Jesus.\""
