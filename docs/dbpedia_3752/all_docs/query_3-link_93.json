        "text": "It has been an age since I posted to this site and I have noticed a number of inquiries about Robert Lowry's ancestry with some trying to trace back to his line. I am the great grandson of Robert Lowry(1826-1899) with a line going back thru my mother, Margaret Jean Lowry West b. 1913 and still kicking. Her father was Rev Harry Moore Lowry. Harry Moore Lowry was one of three sons of Robert Lowry and Anna Rhees Loxley, the other two being Robert Hanson Lowry and Wheaton Smith Lowry. Robert and Anna also had two other sons who died in infancy; Benjamin Loxley Lowry and George Ide Lowry. Anna Rhees Loxley died in 1890 and Robert remarried to Mary Jane Runyon in 1892, a marriage vigourously opposed by the sons.Mary Jane Runyon died in 1941.\n\nEstablishing a line to my Lowry line is likely to be difficult because it was not a prolific line. Robert's father was Crozier Lowry who emigrated from County Down in Northern Ireland in the early 1800's. Crozier's brother, James(1776-1850), emigrated before Crozier, with both landing in Philadelphia. Their father was James Lowry who married Margaret McComb.\n\nCrozier's brother James arrived in America married to Isabella Perry and produced Elizabeth, Margaret and James Lowry. James(1817-1870), married Margaret?(b. 1818) and produced William Lowry(1846-?) William married an Emma?(1850-?)and produced William(1871-?) and Maggie(1873-?) I have no other information on that line.\n\nRev Robert Lowry's father Crozier also had a son named Crozier.(b1830-?) Little is known of Crozier, brother to Robert, other than he served in the civil war and apparently deserted in 1863.\n\nRobert's father Crozier, died in 1857 in the Blockely Almshouse in Philadelphia\n\nRobert Lowry, Anna Rhees Loxley Lowry and his family are buried in Hillside Cemetery in Plainfield, NJ.\n\nRobert' sisters, Elizabeth and Mary Jane are buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery outside Philadelphia.\n\nIf any of this info helps, I can provide more detail on emigration, as well as cemetery photos at Mount Moriah and Hillside."
