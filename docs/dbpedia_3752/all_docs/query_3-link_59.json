Fisher Middle School in the Los Gatos Union Elementary School District, is an advocate of both middle school reform and community involvement. He has spearhearded a number of after school programs for his students, with whom he remains in close contact through a lunchtime open-door policy. Mr. Lowry has also coordinated fundraising campaigns for the school. Extremely supportive of his staff, he regularly observes the classroom and provides teachers with written suggestions for growth and commendations.
