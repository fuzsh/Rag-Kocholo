        "text": "Life of Robert Lowry\n\nReverend Robert Lowry, a distinguished figure in the realm of gospel preaching and gospel hymn composition, hails from Philadelphia and was born on March 12, 1826.\n\nHis roots trace back to his parents, Crozier Lowry and Elizabeth Bannatyne Lowry.\n\nCrozier, an early 19th-century immigrant from Northern Ireland, was a devoted member of the Presbyterian Church in America.\n\nFrom a young age, Robert’s affinity for music shone brightly.\n\nIt was evident in his penchant for immersing himself joyfully in the exploration of any musical instrument that crossed his path.\n\nHis spirit seemed to resonate with the harmonious notes, creating an intimate bond between him and the world of melodies.\n\nThis early connection with music would later pave the way for his remarkable contributions to the world of gospel hymns.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nWhen Robert turned 17, he decided to leave the Presbyterian Church and join the First Baptist Church of Philadelphia.\n\nIt was there that he became actively involved in church activities, taking on roles in the Sunday school and church choir as a teacher and chorister.\n\nHis pastor, Reverend George Barton Ide, saw great potential in him and encouraged him to pursue Christian ministry.\n\nFollowing this advice, Robert embarked on his educational journey at the University of Lewisburg, now known as Bucknell University, located in Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the university, Robert’s musical prowess shone through as he established a choir for the college.\n\nHe also had a fondness for teaching music to his fellow students.\n\nOver time, Robert gained a reputation as both a hymn writer and a preacher.\n\nIn 1854, at the age of 28, Robert graduated with the highest honors in his class.\n\nIt was a remarkable achievement, marking the culmination of his dedication and hard work.\n\nShortly after, he was ordained as a priest in the Baptist Mission, setting the stage for his future endeavors in the ministry.\n\nThis pivotal moment marked the beginning of a new chapter in Robert’s journey of faith and music.\n\nMinistry Work\n\nAfter Robert Lowry graduated, he began his ministry journey and also tied the knot with Anna Rhees Loxley in the same year.\n\nHis first assignment was at the First Baptist Church in West Chester, Pennsylvania, where he served from 1854 to 1858.\n\nFollowing this, he moved on to the Bloomingdale Baptist Church in New York, dedicating two years of service from 1859 to 1861.\n\nRobert then continued his pastoral duties at the Hanson Place Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York, where he remained until 1869.\n\nAfter an enriching eight-year tenure at Hanson Place, he returned to take up the role of pastor at the newly established First Baptist Church in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a post he held from 1869 to 1875.\n\nRemarkably, during this period, he also served as a professor of rhetoric at the University in Lewisburg and received an honorary Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) degree in 1875.\n\nReverend Dr. Robert Lowry was a man of rare qualities, possessing outstanding administrative skills, eloquence in preaching, and a profound understanding of the Bible.\n\nHis dedication and leadership were evident in the successful completion and dedication of the new First Baptist Church in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, in June 1870.\n\nThrough his persuasive speaking, he rallied the congregation, who were not financially well-off, to contribute $10,000 towards clearing the church’s debt.\n\nIn 1875, he graciously stepped down from his professorship at Lewisburg to continue his ministry at the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Plainfield, New Jersey.\n\nAt each stop along his journey, Reverend Dr. Robert Lowry’s stories of faith and devotion proved to be a resounding success.\n\nReverend Robert Lowry as a Hymnist\n\nReverend Robert Lowry’s dedication to spreading the gospel went hand in hand with his passion for creating music and writing hymns.\n\nEven amidst his busy ministry schedule, he never ceased composing heartfelt melodies and crafting inspiring hymns.\n\nA notable example is the beloved hymn “Shall We Gather at the River,” which he penned during his time at Hanson Place in 1864.\n\nAdditionally, he lent his musical talent to setting the tune for the hymn “Marching to Zion,” originally penned by Isaac Watts in 1867.\n\nThen, in 1874, he gifted the world with the Easter hymn “Christ Arose!” where he both wrote the lyrics and composed the music for the uplifting piece known as “Low In The Grave He Lay.”\n\nIn 1868, Reverend Lowry stepped into the role left by William Bradbury as the editor of Sunday School song collections at Biglow & Main publishers in New York City.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration that spanned nearly three decades, working alongside esteemed hymn writers like William H. Doane and Ira D. Sankey.\n\nDuring his tenure at the company, Reverend Dr. Robert Lowry oversaw the publication of over 20 hymnals, leaving an indelible mark on the world of Christian music.\n\nWhat set Lowry apart was his unique ability to compose both the lyrics and the music for his hymns—a rare talent indeed.\n\nAt times, he would even add a chorus or refrain, seamlessly weaving the words into the melodies with a touch of musical genius.\n\nHis contributions continue to resonate, inspiring hearts and souls through the power of music and faith.\n\nDr. Robert Lowry Contribution to Hymnody\n\nRobert Lowry, a prolific hymn writer, has left an indelible mark on the world of Christian music with a vast collection of cherished hymns.\n\nHe is estimated to have composed around 500 hymns during his lifetime. His hymns have had a significant impact on Christian worship.\n\nFurthermore, Lowry’s hymns have deeply touched the hearts of many with their powerful messages of faith and devotion.\n\nThese hymns continue to be treasured by congregations around the world.\n\nPublished Hymn Collections\n\nHere is a compilation of hymn collections attributed to Lowry, either individually or in collaboration with others.\n\nNotably, the widespread popularity of these collections is exemplified by the remarkable success of “Pure Gold,” which, in 1871 alone, saw sales exceeding a million copies.\n\nSome of his published hymn collections are listed below:\n\n1865 Happy Voices\n\n1868 Gospel Melodies\n\n1868 Chapel Melodies (with Silas Vail) Biglow & Main\n\n1869 Bright Jewels Biglow & Main\n\n1871 Pure Gold (with W.

Price, the music of Lowry, Doane, and Sankey beautifully illustrates the evolution of American prayer meeting tunes.\n\nIt progresses from the more solemn rhythm of traditional church music to the catchy, lively melodies reminiscent of popular ballads.\n\nLowry believed that a hymn should be clear and easily understood, resonate with the writer’s own powerful experiences, and be filled with words that inspire.\n\nHonor\n\nDuring his lifetime, Robert Lowry received high honors from Bucknell University and the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.\n\nHe was also among the inaugural inductees into Bucknell’s Academy of Artistic Achievement Awards.\n\nRemarkably, twelve years after Lowry’s passing, a memorial stone was unveiled at the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Plainfield, a fitting tribute to a man whose contributions to music and faith continue to be cherished.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nIn 1880, because of his health, Robert took a much-needed break and ventured to Europe for some rejuvenation.\n\nThen, in 1885, feeling the need for a more extended period of rest, he made the decision to step away from his ministerial duties.\n\nAfter this much-needed hiatus, he returned to his ministry work with renewed vigor and improved health.\n\nHowever, life dealt him a difficult blow in 1890 when he lost his beloved wife, Anna.\n\nYet, two years later, he found love again and married Mary Jane Runyon.\n\nThroughout this time, Robert continued to serve as a pastor at the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Plainfield.\n\nIt was a role he held with great devotion and dedication until his passing on November 25, 1899.\n\nHe found his final resting place at Hillside Cemetery in Plainfield.\n\nAlthough he is no longer with us, Robert’s legacy endures through the timeless sermons embedded within his gospel songs.\n\nThey continue to resonate and inspire, ensuring that his spirit lives on in the hearts of those who hear his music.\n\nFinal Note\n\nRobert Lowry’s life was a testament to his deep faith and musical talent.\n\nThrough his prolific hymn writing, he left an enduring legacy in the world of Christian music.\n\nEstimated to have composed around 500 hymns, Lowry’s contributions have had a profound impact on Christian worship, resonating with congregations worldwide.\n\nHis hymns are cherished for their powerful messages of faith and devotion, and they continue to inspire and uplift people to this day.\n\nWhether in grand cathedrals or humble chapels, the melodies and lyrics of Robert Lowry’s hymns serve as a bridge between the earthly and the divine, connecting generations in shared worship and reverence.\n\nLowry’s enduring influence is a testament to the enduring power of music to touch the human soul and draw hearts closer to God.\n\nAt Phamox Music, we go all out for exactness and honesty.
