        "text": "The blood of Christ is one of the most common themes of hymn writers throughout history. Watts, Wesley, Cowper, Bliss, and Crosby were some who used their poetic gifts to express the foundation of the Christian faith. Robert Lowry is another name to add to this list.\n\nRobert Lowry wrote both the words and music for “Nothing but the Blood of Jesus” in 1876. Born in Philadelphia in 1826, he was a popular Baptist preacher who loved to preach as well as write music and verse. In 1875 he became pastor of Park Avenue Baptist Church in Plainfield, New Jersey, until his death in 1899. Many of his hymns are still being sung and have been translated into other languages, reaching hearts around the world. He also collaborated with William Doane in publishing a number of hymn collections.\n\nThis hymn immediately asks the question, “What can wash away my sin?” The answer is boldly stated, “Nothing but the blood of Jesus.\" This is followed by a second question, “What can make me whole again?” Again, the answer is \"Nothing but the blood of Jesus.\" The theme is the redemptive work of Christ on the cross, expressing the need for trusting only in the precious blood of Jesus for eternal life. Each stanza builds on this theme and repeats the title twice and again in the refrain.\n\nThere were originally six stanzas, but the last two are omitted from many hymnals. The melody has only a five-note range, making it easy to sing for all ages, and the words are simple. The call-and-response pattern with the repeated phrase provides opportunities for various ways to engage the congregation. All these elements have contributed to making “Nothing but the Blood of Jesus” one of the most popular evangelistic songs to be used. It was first introduced at a camp meeting in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, and continues to be sung in evangelical churches.\n\nAnd almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission (Hebrews 9:22).\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain:\n\nOh, precious is the flow,\n\nThat makes me white as snow,\n\nNo other fount I know,\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nFor my cleansing this I see-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nFor my pardon this my plea-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nNothing can for sin atone-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nNaught of good that I have done-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nThis is all my hope and peace-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nThis is all my righteousness-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nNow by this I’ve overcome-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nNow by this I’ll reach my home-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nGlory! glory! thus I sing-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nAll my praise for this I bring-\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nAll rights reserved.
