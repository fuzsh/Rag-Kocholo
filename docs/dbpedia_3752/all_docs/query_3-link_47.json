        "text": "A young woman with a fear of going outside religiously follows the Cincinnati baseball team, tuning in every day on the radio. When the team makes it to the World Series, the woman's brother gets tickets to a game, leaving her to weigh her fear of the outdoors against her love of baseball.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a painter trying to live a quiet life in New York is deeply unsettled by the teenage boys loitering on the street. As events unfold, she is forced to admit that she may have misjudged them."
