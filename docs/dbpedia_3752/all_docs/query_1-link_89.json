        "text": "I‘m a Seattle-area writer giving marketers in the healthcare industry what they need most: engaging, effective content, on time and within budget.\n\nMy communications-related experience spans more than two decades. Prior to my work as a writer I was a public relations professional, for both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. I’ve also held sales and customer service management roles at Amazon.com in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nI’m a graduate of the College of William and Mary in Virginia, with a Certificate in Public Relations from the University of Washington. In addition, I’ve completed copywriting and branding coursework at the School of Visual Concepts in Seattle.\n\nIt’s not all work: When I’m away from my keyboard I’m likely enjoying time with my family, playing the cello, taking a walk in the woods, or reading.\n\nWhatever your healthcare content marketing needs, my enthusiasm, energy, creativity and passion for great communications come standard with every project. Contact me and we’ll get started!"
