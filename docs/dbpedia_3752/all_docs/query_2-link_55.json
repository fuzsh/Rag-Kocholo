He disposed of his property in the following manner :\n\nExtracts from Will of Robert Lowry, dated 1729\n\nThe manor of Sixmilecross having been settled at the marriage of his eldest son Robert with Katherine Dopping, he leaves him only a legacy of £20. He bequeathed in trust to his son-in-law Daniel Eccles, and to Alexander M'Clintock as executors, the town and lands of (Aghenis) Ballyboy, and about eight acres in the townland of Loughmacnab, Killygivan, Tullyancolgan, Lissaaggan, Kiladery, Legacorry, Beagh, Letterfearne, Arvallee, Edenderry, the tuck mill and corn mill, Garvaghlees, Aghagallon, Mullagh, Cranny, Drumgrane, Taltymulmoney, Benefarga, Hallaghan, Hillinana, Cormackellagher, Lisneadin, Backarrenbeg, Tullyenagh, and Oorne- brecken, to his second surviving son Galbraith Lowry for his life, with remainder to his heirs male.

To Galbraith, when seized of the aforesaid lands, he gave power to charge them with a jointure not exceeding £200 per annum ; and a further power to Galbraith to charge them with a sum not exceeding £2,000 for daughters and younger sons, or daughters if no son. James also was to have power to charge his lands with £1,000. To his daughter Isabella he bequeathed £100, to be paid at the age of eighteen or day of marriage, and if she married with consent of his executors £1,500. In case of her demise before eighteen and unmarried, or if she married without consent, Galbraith was to take the £1,500. Isabella was to get £50 per annum from testator's death until marriage in lieu of interest. To M'Clintock he left £100, and further to Galbraith the sum of £2,000 due by D. Eccles. To his sisters Jane and Anne M'Clintock, and brothers-in-law Perry and Moore, the sum of £80 to be divided equally. If any part of the personalty was remaining after legacies were paid, James was to have £100, and Galbraith to be sole executor and residuary legatee. In a codicil he revoked the bequest of £1,600 to Isabella, and gave her £1,000 ; to his sister, Jane M'Clintock, £40 ; his sister, Catherine Perry, of Mullaghmore, £40 ; to his sister Anne M'Clintock, £40 ; to the children of his sister Rebekah Moore, £40 ; to his daughter Mary Eccles, £40. The sum of £600 taken from Isabella was to discharge these latter legacies.[5]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThe Bob Lowery List (do not delete)\n\nAn excerpt from an Old list compiled by Bob Lowery. Bob was in search of Lazarus Lowry's parents. He shared this list with all Lowry families and asked that it not be sold. He is since deceased. This information extracted from that list correlates to this particular family.\n\nNote: first entry here is Anne Sinclair b 1676 Relation only to John Lowry second entry a Robert b. 1670 also a relation only to John Lowry. The only Robert Lowry on the list who's father is John Lowry was born in 1660. It is the 3rd entry. It seems to be the proper date of birth for the man married to Anna Sinclair because it states mother is Mary Buchanan as does the biography on Robert and that the other Robert born 1670 was perhaps a cousin. However if the marriage date is correct for Anna and Robert, then John is not the father, but probably the Cousin.\n\nROBERT LOWRY(M) BORN 1660 FATHER: JOHN LOWRY MOTHER: MARY BUCHANAN AHENIS, TYRONE, IRELAND LDSB:PRE 1970F#: 471029 @...E: PRE 1970...SP:8 JUN 1966 SLAKE Robert Lowry\n\nROBERT LOWRY(M) BORN 1670 REL:JOHN LOWRY , (NO PARENTS LISTED) TYRONE, IRELAND LDSB:2 MAY 1911 MANTIF#: 170398 @...E: PRE 1970P#: 256...SP: PRE 1970\n\nROBERT LOWRY(M) MARR 1698 REL:JOHN LOWRY (NO PARENTS LISTED) AGHENIS, TYRONE, IRELAND LDSB:2 MAY 1911 MANTIF#: 170398 @^ ...E: PRE 1970P#: 255...SP: PRE 1970\n\nANNA LOWRY(F) BORN 1676 REL:JOHN LOWRY , (NO PARENTS LISTED) TYRONE, IRELAND LDSB:2 MAY 1911 MANTIF#: 170398 @...E: PRE 1970P#: 257...SP: PRE 1970 Anna Lowry\n\nSources\n\n↑ Townlands : Aghenis\n\n↑ The History of the Two Ulster Manors of Finagh, in the County of Tyrone, and Coole, Otherwise Manor Atkinson, in the County of Fermanagh, and of Their Owners – Somerset Richard Lowry-Corry Earl of Belmore\n\n↑ A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry (https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vhpVAAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PA140&hl=en)\n\n↑ Lord Belmont in Northern Ireland : 1st Earl of Belmore\n\n↑ The History of the Two Ulster Manors of Finagh, in the County of Tyrone, and Coole, Otherwise Manor Atkinson, in the County of Fermanagh, and of Their Owners – Somerset Richard Lowry-Corry Earl of Belmore"
