        "text": "SmarTone is one of the leading communication service providers in Hong Kong, and it has just agreed to a five-year contract with Ericsson to deploy 5G in Hong Kong.\n\nEricsson is already the sole supplier of SmarTone’s 4G network, and will continue to be the company’s only 5G supplier. This marks 28-years of partnership between both companies.\n\nWorld-class and robust 5G\n\nSmarTone will become the first operator in Hong Kong to deploy Ericsson Spectrum Sharing. This is a technology that allows dynamic sharing of spectrum between 4G and 5G which leads to a more efficient use of existing spectrum. The advanced technology will allow SmarTone to enjoy an enhanced overall network experience with 5G.\n\n“SmarTone has been preparing for the 5G era with Ericsson in Hong Kong since January 2017, when we conducted the first 5G technology demo in this market,” said Stephen Chau, Chief Technology Officer of SmarTone. “Together, Ericsson and SmarTone have led global technology developments in mobility and delivered multiple ‘firsts’ through early joint trials, shared research and collaborative product development. We will continue to leverage our long-term partnership to build a world-class and robust 5G network in Hong Kong and deliver best-of-breed 5G network experience to customers.”\n\nFive-year agreement\n\nThe five-year agreement between the companies includes Ericsson’s Dual-Mode 5G Core, enabling SmarTone to quickly launch advanced services and run efficient operations via a cloud-native solution.\n\nOn top of this, Ericsson’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) powered radio access capabilities will give the SmarTone network machine learning and real-time processing. This allows the network to instantly direct the 5G end-user to the best 5G cells, providing better coverage and a superior 5G experience.\n\nThe smart network will be able to predict traffic patterns and so direct antennas when to sleep to be more energy efficient.\n\n“With Ericsson Spectrum Sharing, SmarTone will be able to more efficiently allocate its spectrum assets according to traffic demands, using its existing infrastructure,” said Magnus Ewerbring, Chief Technology Officer, Asia Pacific at Ericsson. “This ensures, not only a smoother transition to 5G but also a faster one.”"
