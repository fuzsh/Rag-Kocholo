        "text": "Our Story\n\nSmartOne Golf started when founder Peter Kole, an avid golfer, and single handicap, wanted to create a training aid suitable for more than just putting and one that would go directly onto the golf ball. He engineered three unevenly spaced dots, that he printed onto a piece of paper, taped onto the golf ball, and tried out at a local putting green. “I made 3 or 4 6-foot putts and realized the gimme has gone from 2ft to 4ft” with this technology.\n\nWith our patented three-dot technology, SmartOne Golf produces golf balls with professionally printed dots on the ball for precise placement to assist with accuracy and consistency from ball to ball. This technology is also USGA approved, so it can be used during your next round or tournament and is on driving ranges.\n\nSmartOne Golf was founded in eastern Long Island, New York, and is based in New York.\n\nWhy three unevenly spaced dots? Simple. Working with dots allows you to create a wide variety of visual effects, different from the current, commonly used aids. There are uneven spaces between the dots so that each spacing can create a different shot, providing more options and preferences. The longer spacing is for longer strokes, shorter spacing for shorter strokes. This spacing is also for hard or soft draws or fades, using the short or long spacing, respectively.\n\nThis technology allows you to shape different shots, hone your accuracy, and rework your pre-shot routine. It places you in the same position every time, squares your stance to the ball, and puts you in the proper position at address. This way, when you hit the ball, you can emulate that same stance or adjust your position as needed.\n\nSmartOne has made the game easier to play and learn for players on every level, just by putting it down."
