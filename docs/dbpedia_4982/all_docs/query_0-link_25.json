        "text": "SmarTone Fully Supports China Telecom Global in the Launch of\n\nDirect-to-phone Satellite Connectivity in Hong Kong\n\nBringing SmarTone Customers Satellite Mobile Communication Services\n\n(Hong Kong, 8 May 2024) - As the leading mobile operator in Hong Kong, SmarTone fully supports China Telecom Global in the launch of direct-to-phone satellite connectivity in Hong Kong, bringing SmarTone customers satellite mobile communication services. With a smartphone that supports the satellite connectivity feature, SmarTone customers can connect to the \"Tiantong Satellite\", operated by China Telecom Global, without changing SIM cards or numbers.\n\nSmarTone leverages innovative technology to provide customers with a caring and seamless mobile communication experience. With a simple setup process, SmarTone customers can connect to the \"Tiantong Satellite\" to make or receive calls, as well as send and receive text messages using supported mobile phones*. Even in remote areas where traditional mobile network coverage is limited, such as mountains, forests, cruise ships in international waters during activities like mountain climbing, extreme sports or travelling, SmarTone customers are still able to stay connected to the outside world. In the event of emergencies or natural disasters such as wildfires or floods, where mobile networks are temporarily unavailable in some regions, they can still rely on the satellite service to send distress messages. Details of the service will be announced later.\n\n###\n\n1 / 2"
