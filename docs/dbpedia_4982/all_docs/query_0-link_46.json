        "text": "One of five major providers in the saturated Hong Kong telecom market, SmarTone knows that to survive and grow its time-to-market and level of customer service must be second to none. For the 150-strong sales and account management team, that calls for immediate response to customer queries.\n\nAccording to SmarTone Head of Business Markets, Daniel Leung, preparing a full customer profile including spending and usage patterns would easily take two people up to two days to complete using previous systems. âThese profiles are important when customers contact us for information on individual employee or corporateâs mobile spend and usage,â he explains. âThey are also how we create personalised offers to meet our customersâ specific needs, and put together offers for contract renewals.â\n\nThe extensive time needed for developing customer profiles was down to the companyâs disparate systems. Without consolidation, SmarTone employees might need to access anywhere up to seven data sources before compiling a meaningful view. Now itâs instant.â\n\nSalesforce dashboards open up a view to a raft of reports for Sales, Account Management and Marketing. These range from a customerâs single line usage to a complete view of the service consumption behaviour and spend across the customerâs entire subscribed services.\n\nâWe currently have tens of thousands of corporate customers that rely on us for their mobile communications,â Leung explains. âFor our account managers to service them better, and for our marketing team to be able to create the best possible offers, immediacy and accuracy of customer data is critical â and thatâs what we are getting now from the Salesforce Sales Cloud.â\n\nFor account managers, who spend face-to-face time with customers on average three times every day, mobile access to Salesforce is a customer relationship boon. âRight on their iPad, each account manager has immediate access to the holistic view of all their customersâ records,â Leung says. âItâs up-to-date, easy to interrogate and complete. They need to be connected to customer data wherever they go in order to satisfy their customers, and thatâs exactly what the Salesforce Customer Platform gives us.â\n\nIn the SmarTone marketing team, Cartina Choi, SmarTone Marketing Manager, Business Markets, and her team now rely on Salesforce to monitor trends in customer usage and develop special offers. âWe have a complete view of our customers, so we can see the areas of greatest spend and determine where those customers can use more of SmarTone services,â she explains.\n\nâOnce we have identified those customers, we use Salesforce to dispatch the opportunities, along with customised marketing offers, to the account manager,â Choi explains. âWe then monitor and track the status of those opportunities against pre-defined metrics, for example 50 per cent or greater probability of winning the business. It drives our performance and gives us a better and more responsive way to serve customers. Ultimately, itâs driving greater customer loyalty.â\n\nSmarTone is extending its range of service offerings right off the back of the success of the adoption of Salesforce. Leung comments: âSalesforce gives us real business intelligence; and with that we can identify emerging customer needs and develop new strategies and products to address them.â"
