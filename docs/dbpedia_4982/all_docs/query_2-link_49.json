Determined to upend the Equilibrium Hivemind's imposed 10 Gaianic Systems so that it can attempt to break through Rank 5, the Scientocratic HIvemind must begin eroding these 10, beginning with the Law of Yin and Yang.\n\nAll Hiveminds must have balanced Mankind and Womankind as dictated by the Law of Yin and Yang. To shake the Law, it refines a Hivemind comprised entirely of Womankind. With the lofty name of the Propagation Hivemind, she will reproduce through a perfected form of technology the Scientocratic Hivemind invented that converts stem cells to sperm cell. The derived sperm is suitable to produce viable human babies. Because of the sperm itself, every child produced is female.\n\nQuestion\n\nWhy would sperm cells converted from the women's stem cells always produce female children? What would the science-based mechanism be?"
