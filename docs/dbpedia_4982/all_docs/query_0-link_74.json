        "text": "The effectiveness of the programmes has already been recognised with the 'best team performance' prize at the 2004 Service and Courtesy Awards, an annual event organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, which rates contestants' abilities through sessions of role playing, quizzes, discussions and debates.\n\nSmarTone, Hong Kong's leading mobile network operator, has won every year in this category since 2001. In addition, one member of the team also picked up the supervisory level award in the electronic and electrical appliances/ telecommunications category.\n\nStill excited about his double win in October, Boris Yip, who beat 115 nominees from 36 retailers, attributed the success to his industry experience, combined with company training in supervisory skills. This gave him an advantage in knowing about coaching methods, planning and team building.\n\nMr Yip has worked in the telecommunications field for 10 years, most of that time with SmarTone, and believes that, as a supervisor, he should act as a role model for his subordinates and share his experience with them. 'When an employee has done well, I will praise them openly, and when I myself do not do well, I admit this to my staff and try to analyse the reasons,' he said.\n\nA frontline sales person needs detailed product knowledge, but must also have a customer's best interests at heart. 'The aim is to introduce and sell what meets the needs of the customer, not to promote something more expensive but less suitable,' he said.\n\nThe other members of the award-winning team, Kenneth Chang, Herman Ng and Kenneth Leung, said that one thing they particularly liked about their jobs was the training, which boosted their knowledge about the latest telecommunications technologies and put them ahead of the competition.\n\nSmarTone has followed this pioneering approach since it was established in 1992. It was the first operator to launch GSM mobile services in Asia. It also introduced automatic international roaming, implemented enhanced full-rate technology and did a pilot launch for GPRS. Innovative 3G services have just been introduced.\n\nAssistant manager of retail business development Matilda Chan said: 'At least five new mobile phones come on the market every month. We must ensure that sales staff are familiar with all the features, know how these can benefit customers and can explain each point effectively.'\n\nThe training includes written tests and role playing, which allow supervisors to gauge whether staff are equipped with sufficient product knowledge and have the ability to handle customers well.\n\nA sales assistant joining the company has a two-week orientation programme and then receives on-the-job training from senior staff.\n\nIf all goes well, they can take on supervisory duties within eight months, but are first required to complete written reports setting out how certain methods can be applied to improve the entire sales team.\n\nIn one such initiative, the 'mystery shopper' programme, employees are approached by a company representative posing as a shopper to find out whether day-to-day customer contacts are being handled correctly.\n\nAny feedback forms part of the staff appraisals, which take into account the opinions of supervisors, subordinates, peers and customers.\n\nProviding consistent customer service\n\nTraining in customer service skills with practical guidance from senior staff\n\nTechnical training for staff before new product launches\n\nSupervisors taught about coaching methods, planning and team building\n\nPassing on best practices to other branches\n\nAn all-round appraisal of staff based on transparency"
