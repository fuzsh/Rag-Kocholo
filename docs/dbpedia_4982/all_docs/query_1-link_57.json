        "text": "Josephine Lam: SmarTone leads the industry in 5G development, and collaborates closely with the Group to drive digital transformation and contribute to Hong Kongâs transition to a smart city Competition in the local telecommunications industry has always been fierce, and SmarTone has long enjoyed the trust of its customers by providing quality network and customer services. Josephine Lam, Head of Marketing & Sales of SmarTone, said the company has experienced different eras of mobile communication since its beginnings in 1992. âWe are now in the 5G era, and its ultra-high-speed, low-latency, and mass connectivity features provide users with a faster network experience, making everyday life more convenient and businesses more digital and this presents many new opportunities for SmarTone.\" SmarToneâs 5G network leads the market Provides caring customer services Hong Kongâs 5G service was launched in mid- 2020, attaining the third highest network coverage in the world after only a short period of time, trailing only the Mainland and South Korea. The SmarTone 5G network provides nearly full coverage of Hong Kong, leveraging the industry- leading Dynamic Sharing Spectrum technology. It is Hong Kong's only mobile operator that provides 5G coverage in the Tai Lam Tunnel. With its high quality 5G network, SmarTone was selected as the âConsumers' Best Preferred Mobile Service Operator for 5Gâ in an independent market survey. Josephine said SmarTone has integrated AI and big data analytics when building its 5G network, enabling it to deliver a superior network experience. \"Through big data analytics, we know which time periods and which areas have the highest demand for 5G. Through our AI systems, we automatically allocate spectrum resources to relevant areas according to traffic demand, giving users a good network experience anytime, anywhere, even in remote hiking hotspots. In just one year, we accumulated over 100,000 5G users. Nearly 70% of our new customers have opted for our 5G service. This growth is encouraging, and we believe it will help the company increase its monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) in the long run.\" In addition, SmarTone has launched the innovative SmarTone Home 5G Broadband service, ushering in an exceptional new era in home broadband where landlines are no longer necessary and service can be added whenever needed. Due to geographical constraints, 20% of households in Hong Kong lie outside of the fibre-optic network coverage, suffer from slow speed and unstable connection, or do not have access to an affordable home broadband service. SmarTone uses 5G technology to address the pain points of these fixed network broadband users, providing a stable, smooth and more flexible home 5G broadband service. The coronavirus pandemic has given rise to work from home and eLearning arrangements, and SmarToneâs Home 5G Broadband is a more convenient âprivate broadbandâ option that helps fulfil their growing need of bandwidth. Growing 5G enterprise solutions to create Group-wide synergy T he mos t p romising t hing abou t t he development of 5G is its potential to change lives and business models. To fully explore the new opportunities at hand, SmarTone's professional Enterprise Solutions Team is committed to helping enterprise clients and partners improve their operational efficiency and customer experience SmarTone å¸ååé·å®é¨ä¸»ç®¡ Head of Marketing & Sales of SmarTone Josephine Lam æå¯¶å½¤ 22 äººç© Vol 100 â¢ Q2 2021 â¢ SHKP Quarterly\n\nRkJQdWJsaXNoZXIy NTk2NTE="
