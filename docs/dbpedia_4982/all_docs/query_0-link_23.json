        "text": "Basics[]\n\nOperators[]\n\nMobile networks in Hong Kong are independent from those in mainland China. Unlike there, in Hong Kong only GSM-operators are on the air if you buy a prepaid card there. The number has gone down to 4 in 2014 when CSL merged under the roof of Hong Kong Telecom:\n\ncsl. (formerly CSL and PCCW Mobile, by Hong Kong Telecom)\n\nChina Mobile Hong Kong (CMHK)\n\nThree (3, by Hutchison Whampoa)\n\nSmarTone\n\nThere are some MVNOs like China Unicom from the Mainland China as MVNOs in the market, reselling the networks.\n\nFrequencies and Coverage[]\n\nCoverage is excellent all over the city on all networks. Except for patchy areas in the Sai Kung & Clear Water Bay Area.\n\nMain bands are marked in bold numbers.\n\n2G: As many operators are refarming the 2G frequencies to 4G or 3G, only few resources remain for 2G.\n\n3G: The major 3G frequency for all operators is on 2100 MHz and have very good coverage in the city.\n\n4G/LTE: the additional 2100 MHz band has been added firstly in MTR (metro) tunnels from 2016.\n\nRegistration and Availability[]\n\nSIM cards in Hong Kong now require real-name registration for use in the territory. It’s easy to just walk into an electronics store catering to mobile phones, a 7-Eleven, currency exchange bureau, etc and buy a SIM card.\n\nHowever, not all stores will assist you in real-name registration and you may need to complete it yourself if you do not purchase the SIM card directly from a mobile operator's store. No need to speak Chinese; just say \"SIM card, data\" (slowly) and they show you the packages and you can choose. To activate, pop the SIM into the phone, call the number indicated on the back of the package (usually something like *102*22#), and complete the real-name registration procedure.\n\nThis applies to eSIMs as well, though if you purchase the eSIM from outside Hong Kong and first use it for roaming, then registration may not yet be necessary.\n\nRecharging is harder than just buying another SIM card. However, recharge vouchers can also be found all over the city in places like 7-Eleven or Circle K convenience stores.\n\n3 and its SoSIM brand are the best bets for those who want to have a SIM ready before they land in Hong Kong as they offer eSIMs that are payable with overseas credit cards. If you want a prepaid SIM immediately upon arrival at the airport, there is a 7-Eleven just to the left after you walk through customs. There are also other shops like 1O1O (csl's premium brand, but they also sell csl prepaid SIMs) and CMHK on the public areas of the arrival floors after you leave baggage claim. Both 1010 and CMHK will assist you with real-name registration.\n\nIf you can wait, SIM cards for most carriers and reload vouchers can be purchased at a discount off-face value at Ap Liu Street (close to Sham Shui Po MTR station), up to half price for SIM cards and up to $35 discount on large-value recharge vouchers. These discounted prices are clearly written on the SIM packets themselves, so no haggling skills are required, and even those who don't speak Cantonese can walk around this area and will still get the best deals in town.\n\nNOTE: When buying a 3 SIM at the street market, look closely at the packaging. Some vendors primarily stock SIMs for 3 Macau for travelers going there. A first-time visitor will probably not be able to tell the difference (the primary clue on the packaging is a reference to \"three.com.mo\" instead of \"three.com.hk\" seen on starter packs for local use). While some 3 Macau SIMs (like the $50 or $100 roaming SIMs) do function in Hong Kong at local-like rates, others are Macau-only, so make sure you are purchasing the correct SIM.\n\nIf you would like to pre-order a SIM card with a Hong Kong number so that you know your number in advance, or you would like to get a Hong Kong SIM abroad, many of them are available online to ship worldwide from sites like eBay, Amazon, or dedicated online stores like prepaid.com.hk. Likewise, CMHK (through CMLink Global) and Three have eSIM available directly via their websites so you will get a QR code containing the eSIM profile via email shortly after payment and set it up before arrival in Hong Kong.\n\nPrice comparison with the rest of the world[]\n\nIn general, UK internet comparison site cable.co.uk has ranked Hong Kong as 82nd of 237 countries/territories in terms of mobile data affordability with data costing on average HK$6.39 (approximately US$0.82) per GB (July 2023). This makes Hong Kong more expensive compared to Indonesia, Mainland China, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Italy, France, Spain, the UK, and Taiwan; but cheaper than Macau, Germany, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, the US, and Switzerland.[Cable 1]\n\nRestrictions[]\n\nThere are no special restrictions or any censorship with local prepaid SIM cards in Hong Kong in contrast to mainland China. Tethering (share your network as \"personal hotspot\") and VoIP calls are allowed for most of the cards.\n\nHowever, if you want to buy phones in Hong Kong given their affordable prices relative to many other countries, please take note that some features found in selected models sold elsewhere are not included in the versions of those models sold in Hong Kong. For instance, the iPhone’s eSIM feature is not available for many recent iPhone models sold in Hong Kong, despite several Hong Kong telcos already offering eSIM.\n\nAdministration Charges[]\n\nMost of the SIM cards in Hong Kong charge an “administration fee” from HK$ 2 to HK$ 3 (depending on operator and plan) by the mobile operators to subsidize their license fee and other administrative costs. That will be deducted after 30 days of use with CSL and 3, while SmarTone and CMHK charge the fee at the time you activate the SIM.\n\nRoaming SIM cards for mainland China and Macau[]\n\nIn Hong Kong some prepaid SIM cards offer data and minutes for both Hong Kong and mainland China by default. They are locally referred to as \"one-card-two-numbers\" even though they no longer come with a mainland number. The \"Great Firewall of China” censorship is not applied to data routed through these SIM cards. So they can be a good option to be used in China too (see China Unicom section in article of China). However, these cards may also have higher selling prices, higher administration fees, ranging from HK$ 6 (on both CMHK and China Unicom) to HK$ 18 (seen only on China Unicom so far) and lower inclusive data than Hong Kong-only SIM cards.\n\nLikewise, some prepaid SIM cards with roaming data in Macau are offered, and newer, improved (read: packages that charge data usage on one side same as the other) offers means it's finally possible to clearly recommend a couple of one-SIM solutions for lighter users. From the Hong Kong side, the Smartone HK$ 98 starter pack is the more reasonable value, and from the Macau side, the 3 Macau SIMs are the most reasonably priced offer. For their offers and prices check our chapter about Macau (note that some vendors in Hong Kong, mostly in the Ap Liu market, carry 3 Macau SIMs, but will usually only have the $50 or $100 4G roaming SIMs for this reason).\n\nGenerally, the data allocation for mainland China and Macau is separate from and lower than local data allowance.\n\ncsl. (formerly PCCW-HKT, one2free)[]\n\nHong Kong Telecom merged the two smaller networks PCCW-HKT and one2free to the new provider called csl. after Telstra from Australia sold their shares in 2014. It has become the new market leader in Hong Kong on its combined network.\n\nTop-ups can be made online HK$ 50-300 or using vouchers sold in csl. shops, 7-Eleven, 1O1O, Van Go or Circle K kiosks. To top-up by voucher dial 179179, choose 1 and enter the voucher code. To check balance, type *109#.\n\nAn online prepaid management webpage \"My Account\" allows users to recharge (by credit cards, recharge vouchers), check allowances and balance, select data passes and value added services.\n\nA monthly administration fee from HK$ 2.50 - 3.00 (depends on card type) will be charged after 30 days. In 2015 a general FUP limit of 6 GB per month on a SIM card was introduced, after which speed will be throttled to 128 kbps.\n\nThis page will mainly focus on the new csl. branded SIM cards. For those discontinued SIM cards, including old one2free, PCCW-HKT, New World Mobility (NWM) and old CSL branded SIM card, you may check details on their website.\n\nAlthough those SIM cards are no longer produced, they may be still available in the market and work as usual.\n\ncsl. Local Prepaid SIM card and csl. All-in-one Prepaid SIM card[]\n\nThe Local Prepaid SIM is sold for HK$ 48 or 78 with the same face value while the All-in-one Prepaid is sold for HK$ 100 or 180 also with the face value accordance. Both types of SIM cards are available in all three sizes at 1O1O, csl, HKT stores, 7-Eleven, Vango, Circle K kiosks and other authorized dealers. They are valid for 180 days from activation or the last top-up. A monthly administration fee from HK$ 3 will be charged after 30 days for both types of SIM.\n\nThe difference between these two SIMs is that Local Prepaid SIM offers lower Hong Kong voice call rates, while All-in-one Prepaid SIM offers lower IDD rates to 30 foreign countries including Canada, China, most European countries and the US and the 1 GB package for a month.\n\nSee csl webpage for more details: Local Prepaid SIM. All-in-one Prepaid SIM\n\nFor data you need to add one of these passes (available for both types except #):\n\nVolume Validity Price Activation 500 MB 1 hour HK$ 8 *101*532*4# 1.2 GB 1 day HK$ 18 *101*532*1# 2 GB 3 days HK$ 38 *101*532*2# 3 GB 7 days HK$ 68 *101*532*3# 300 MB 30 days HK$ 38 *101*835*1# 1 GB 30 days HK$ 48 *101*835*3# 1 GB 365 days HK$ 68 *101*835*4# 5 GB 365 days HK$ 168 *101*825*5#\n\nMultiple passes can be purchased at the same time, but the validity and use of passes can be complicated. For details check their website.\n\nThese SIMs also support roaming in mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan in two add-ons:\n\n500 MB for 3 days: HK$ 48, *101*601*3#\n\n1 GB for 7 days: HK$ 98, *101*601*9#\n\nTo all packages unlimited csl. WiFi is added (for Local Mobile Prepaid SIM only, All-in-one Prepaid SIM has WiFi included already once you activate your SIM card). To get password, dial *111#. The monthly pass is auto-renewing. To stop, type *122#835*1#.\n\nLocal Octopus Prepaid SIM card[]\n\nThis SIM is sold exclusively at 7-Eleven stores in HK for HK$ 98 with HK$ 58 credit valid for 180 days, 300 MB of data for every 30 days (until 180 days after activation) and unlimited free WiFi access. The card can also be used as the Octopus Card with NFC-compatible phones (need to top-up the Octopus purse before use). This card is available as trio-sim (for all three SIM sizes). A monthly administration fee from HK$ 2.50 will be charged after 30 days. These data passes can be added:\n\nVolume Validity Price Activation Code 1.2 GB 1 day HK$ 18 *122*532*1# 2 GB 3 days HK$ 38 *122*532*2# 3 GB 7 days HK$ 68 *122*532*3# 2 GB unlimited HK$ 218 *122*532*4# 800 MB + 100 mins 30 days HK$ 90 *122*532*5#\n\nAll packages come with unlimited free WiFi.\n\nThese SIMs can be difficult to find; some 7-Elevens don't stock SIM cards and others don't know that they carry the 7-Eleven Octopus SIM. Your best bet is to ask to see all the SIMs they have available, and be prepared to check in several stores. If you can't find the Octopus SIM in 7-Eleven, you may be able to buy a different 7-Eleven Connect SIM card and exchange it for an Octopus SIM at a csl. store (it also comes with a HK$ 20 recharge voucher). You can also exchange standard/micro Octopus SIMs for a nano Octopus SIM at a csl. store.\n\nDiscover Hong Kong Tourist SIM Card[]\n\nThis tourist SIM is released by the local Tourism Board and used to be on the PCCW-HKT network which has been merged to csl. now.\n\nYou can get the Discover Hong Kong Tourist SIM Card at any 1O1O Centre in town, including the new outlet at 5/F of the HKG Arrival Hall, more than 2,000 7-Eleven, Circle K or VanGO convenience stores, csl or HKT shops, the Hong Kong Tourism Board’s Kowloon Visitor Centre at the Star Ferry Concourse in Tsim Sha Tsui, GaryLine Travel, Nobeltime AV & Telecom and all Apple Stores in the city. It comes in all three sizes and gives speeds up to 4G/LTE:\n\nHK$ 88: 3 GB, unlimited local calls and WiFi for 5 days plus HK$ 30 credit\n\nHK$ 118: 8 GB, unlimited local calls and WiFi for 8 days plus HK$ 48 credit\n\nFor more data you can add 1.5 GB plus free WiFI for 5 days at HK$ 48 and for roaming data in China and Macau a HK$ 48 pass for max. 500 MB per 3 days by *101*601*3# or HK$ 98 for 1 GB per week by *101*601*9#. Note, that once your initial pack has expired, there is no pay per use for local call or sending text to a local number. You must purchase the HK$ 48 add-on instead.\n\nAlthough your initial pack or add-on is valid for 5 or 8 days, your account remains open for 180 days from activation or last recharge. Unlike other prepaid cards, these types of SIM card don't have a monthly administration fee.\n\nChina-HK-Macau - Travel SIM card[]\n\nTheir new roaming SIM is sold only at 1O1O Centre of Arrivals Meeters & Greeters Hall, Level 5, Hong Kong Internatl. Airport for HK$ 218 in all three sizes. It includes an 8-days pass with unlimited HK calls, 5 GB HK data, unlimted csl. WiFi in HK and 1 GB roaming data in China and Macau.\n\nFor more data in HK you can add a 5-days pass of 1.5 GB, unlimited HK calls and WiFi for HK$ 48 or a roaming pass of 100 MB per day for mainland China and Macau at HK$ 40 by typing *131#. Like with the Discover Hong Kong Tourist SIM card, once your initial pack has expired, there is no pay per use for local call or sending text to a local number. You must purchase the HK$ 48 add-on instead.\n\nYour account remains open for 180 days from activation or last recharge even your initial package expired. This type of SIM card doesn't have a monthly administration fee.\n\nOther roaming SIM cards[]\n\nFor travellers in the region these further roaming SIM cards are sold:\n\nfor Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Japan and mainland China: 8 days and 3 GB (5 GB in promotion until 30/Nov/2019) and 1 GB local HK data at HK$ 238. As roaming add-ons: 100 MB per day at HK$ 40 by *101*601*2#\n\nfor USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: 15 days and 3 GB and 1 GB local HK data at HK$ 268.\n\nKumusta Ka, Hemat and Ceria []\n\nCSL's prepaid SIM for domestic helpers may also be of interest for tourists who want more data and willing to accept slower speeds. Kumusta Ka is geared to Filipinos, Hemat and Ceria to Indonesians. These SIMs are usually found not in CSL stores, but in certain street stands selling them or in stores that cater to these populations. For a list of stores that carry them, see the bottom of this page.\n\nThe starter pack of Kumusta Ka is HK$ 38 and comes with 2 GB of data. There are three volume-based data add-ons available, with maximum speeds of 21 Mbps:\n\nHK$ 38: 1 GB, activation: *101*414#\n\nHK$ 88: 4 GB activation: *101*418#\n\nHK$ 99: 10 GB activation: *101*400#\n\n(Bonus 3 GB and 1000 local voice minutes on first activation until 30-Nov-19)\n\nThere are also time-based add-ons, with maximum speeds of 7.2Mbps:\n\nHK$ 8: 1 hour, Activation: *101*832*2#\n\nHK$ 28: 1 day, Activation: *101*832*3#\n\nHK$78: 1 week, Activation: *101*832*4#\n\nThere is also a HK$ 88 30-day package, but at a lower speed of 3.6 Mbps, activate by dialing *101*420#. These plans all have a FUP of 15 GB after which usage will be throttled to 128kbps for the remainder of the period of the add-on.\n\nThis SIM also has discounted roaming add-ons:\n\nHK$ 28: 500 MB for one day in Mainland China, Macau, Taiwan, Philippines and Indonesia\n\nHK$ 70: 1 GB for 30 days in Philippines and Indonesia\n\nHK Mobile Global Pass (Roaming SIM)[]\n\nCSL also sells another prepaid roaming SIM at a lower cost through the same distributors that carry the domestic helper SIMs above. This SIM is usually sold at HK$ 80 in Hong Kong, found not in CSL stores but at various street stands around HK, and at higher prices on eBay or Amazon, and the initial package includes 2000 minutes and 1 GB of data in HK, and 5 GB of data good in Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Japan and mainland China for 8 days. Its main advantage over CSL's own-brand SIM is cost; it costs less than half CSL's own Asia roaming SIM, and the same package can be renewed, unlike the CSL-branded SIM:\n\nHK$ 108: 5 GB of data for Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Japan and mainland China for 8 days, activate online or with code *601*101*7#\n\nThere are also additional roaming add-ons for the same countries that can be activated online (see next section for details):\n\nHK$ 48: 1 GB of data for 1 day for same countries as above\n\nHK$ 78: 2.5 GB of data for 4 days for same countries as above\n\nAs well as some packages only for mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan:\n\nHK$ 48: 500 MB of data for 3 days\n\nHK$ 98: 1 GB of data for 7 days\n\nAnd a package for US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand at HK$ 268 for 5 GB for 8 days.\n\nIn addition to these there are local data packages available:\n\nHK$ 9: 500 MB data for 1 day\n\nHK$ 18: 1.2 GB data for 1 day\n\nHK$ 38: 2 GB data for 3 days\n\nHK$ 68: 3 GB data for 7 days\n\nHK$ 48: 1 GB data and 50 voice minutes for 30 days*\n\nHK$ 68: 1 GB data and 150 voice minutes good for 365 days\n\nHK$ 168: 5 GB data and 150 voice minutes good for 365 days\n\nAll packages above have maximum speeds of 42Mbps. This SIM has no \"default\" or \"overage\" rate for data; if you do not have a data package active, data will not function on this SIM. In addition, this SIM has one of the most generous expiration policies in Hong Kong- it is valid for 365 days after initial activation, and each top-up of HK$ 50 or greater increases the period to 365 days from that top-up.\n\nCheck balance and account management[]\n\nFor csl. branded prepaid SIMs (except Discover Hong Kong Tourist SIM), old one2free and old CSL branded SIM cards,\n\nto check your mobile number, account balance, expiry date and subscribed packs: type *109#\n\nfor data and allowance enquiry: type *101#\n\nAll text messages are displayed in dual languages (Cantonese and English) as default.\n\nFor old PCCW-HKT prepaid SIMs and Discover Hong Kong Tourist SIM cards, use the following codes as they share different prepaid billing system with csl. even some of their products rebranded under csl.\n\nfor account balance: type ##122#\n\nText messages displayed in dual languages (Cantonese and English).\n\nFor all prepaid cards, no matter new csl, old one2free or old PCCW-HKT branded prepaid SIM, csl allows you to log-on to their prepaid online services \"My Account\".

You may select data passes and value added services (including some that may only be available here and not available for activation by USSD code), and set preferences (roaming, language, promotional messages, reset passcode or change passcode) and recharge (by credit cards, recharge vouchers).\n\nUse your WiFi log-on passcode to log-on to your account. Otherwise, press *111# to get your PIN or click here. For PCCW branded SIMs or Discover Hong Kong Tourist Prepaid SIM, your passcode is already printed on the back of your credit card sized SIM holder, next to your phone number.\n\nRecharge[]\n\nCommon recharge methods for tourists are recharge vouchers, payment kiosk in csl. shops and online by credit cards. Validity will be extended for 180 days from the recharge date for all cards mentioned under this heading. csl. provides additional bonus up to 33% on top of your recharge amount for selected types of prepaid cards.

Check whether vouchers are the new ones as only the new csl vouchers can be used on new csl, old one2free, old PCCW-HKT, old NWM (not mentioned in this article) and old CSL branded prepaid SIM. Old PCCW recharge vouchers can only be used on PCCW branded prepaid SIM and Discover Hong Kong Tourist Prepaid SIM cards.\n\nNote that the domestic helper and HK Mobile Global Pass SIMs require special Kumusta Ka vouchers instead of the standard csl or PCCW vouchers. These can be found at stores catering to Filipinos, and also street stands that sell these SIMs. These vouchers are available in HK$ 20, HK$ 50, and HK$ 100, with a HK$ 10 bonus on the HK$ 100 voucher.
