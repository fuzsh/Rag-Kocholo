        "text": "5G Coverage Information Available from Service Providers\n\nThe MNOs have published on their websites information about coverage of their 5G networks. Consumers may access information on their 5G coverage via the following links â\n\nChina Mobile Hong Kong Company Limited\n\nHong Kong Telecommunications (HKT) Limited\n\nServices provided under â1O1Oâ brand\n\nServices provided under âcslâ brand\n\nHutchison Telephone Company Limited\n\nSmarTone Mobile Communications Limited\n\nConsumers should note that MNOs may adopt different interpretations for the meaning of 5G coverage, or different methodologies in compiling the coverage information (for example, based on on-site measurements or results of computer simulation conducted at specific times). Consumers should therefore pay attention to the explanatory notes that accompany the presentation of 5G coverage information on the MNOsâ websites, for better understanding of the meaning of 5G coverage, as well as the limitations (if any) of the coverage information presented by individual MNOs. In case of enquiries or doubt, please contact the MNOs direct.\n\nApart from the MNOs, other service providers may provide 5G services making use of the mobile networks of MNOs (âmobile service providersâ). Consumers may contact the mobile service providers direct for information about the coverage of their 5G services and/or the 5G coverage of their hosting MNOs."
