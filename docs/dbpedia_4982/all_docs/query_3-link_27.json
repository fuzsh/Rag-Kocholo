        "text": "Every investor in SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited (HKG:315) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it’s not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.\n\nSmarTone Telecommunications Holdings isn’t enormous, but it’s not particularly small either. It has a market capitalization of HK$10b, which means it would generally expect to see some institutions on the share registry. Taking a look at the our data on the ownership groups (below), it’s seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about 315.\n\nView our latest analysis for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nWant to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and receive a $60 prize!\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors own 12% of SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It’s therefore worth looking at SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings’s earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Limited in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around HK$50m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 16% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over 315. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nIt appears to us that public companies own 71% of 315. We can’t be certain, but this is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt’s always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.
