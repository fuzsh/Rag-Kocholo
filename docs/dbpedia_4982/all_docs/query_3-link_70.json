        "text": "Satellite Asset Tracker Anti-Theft Device\n\nSmartOne C is a satellite-managed asset-ready tracker designed for the intelligent management of fixed and mobile assets.\n\nThe SmartOne C is a practical solution for a multitude of options, including:\n\nUp to 12 different reporting times\n\nInterval or 24-hour operation mode\n\nAlternate reporting schedules\n\nLow battery message\n\nUse the SmartOne C to track intermediate bulk containers, vehicles, boats, and trailers, improving your assets' operating efficiency and security.\n\nThe device can be line-powered, or the SmartOne C will automatically switch to battery backup in the absence or interruption of external power. When using line power, the user has maximum flexibility in messaging frequency, allowing for regular monitoring of asset location.\n\nThe SmartOne C utilises motion sensors, comparative GPS positions, and custom-configured sensors to gather and transmit asset status information. Each SmartOne C is adjusted to track your assets' needs and provide intermediate and emergency alerts by email or text.\n\nMessaging\n\nStaff Tip: Your tracking device can only operate with a messaging plan. Keep Track offers different plans to suit your needs.\n\nSTANDARD MESSAGING MODE\n\nIn Standard Messaging Mode, the SmartOne C reports its GPS position at regular intervals programmed during the initial configuration process. Reporting intervals can be programmed in 1-minute intervals from 35 minutes up to 45 days, and messages will be transmitted regardless of whether the asset is moving or stationary.\n\nAlternatively, the device can be configured to send messages only when the asset is in motion, with messages transmitted as little as every 5 minutes.\n\nREDUCED MESSAGING MODE\n\nReduced Messaging Mode reduces the cost of transmitting messages over the Globalstar satellite network by sending messages at a minimal message interval when the asset is stationary or in a defined area and transmitting at a higher message interval when the asset moves or changes locations.\n\nTHEFT RECOVERY/GEOFENCING MODE\n\nThe theft recovery mode allows you to configure the device to differentiate between authorised and unauthorised movements of an asset. While the asset remains in an authorised state, the SmartOne C will send out infrequent messages. Suppose the SmartOne C detects an unauthorised state, such as movement out of a predefined area. In that case, it can be programmed to send out high-frequency messages to enable the unauthorised movement to be monitored.\n\nGEOFENCING\n\nThe SmartOne satellite asset tracker offers a geo-fencing feature. This feature enables you to predefine a set of geographic boundaries and receive email notifications when the device enters or exits the geo-fenced area.\n\nFeatures\n\nUp to 12 different reporting times\n\nInterval or 24-hour operation mode\n\nAlternate reporting schedules\n\nLow battery message\n\nQuick installation: Use industrial adhesives, brackets, or screw mounts for installation\n\nOperates on 5V external line power, 8-22V regulator cable, or (4) AAA Lithium Batteries\n\nAutomatic alerts: Change of location sensing sends alerts if an asset moves outside of the pre-determined range\n\nMessaging reduction mode: Reduces satellite messaging if the asset remains in the exact location for a pre-determined period\n\nHardware on/off feature: Allows the unit to initiate GPS re-centering functionality\n\nSatellite technology: Global LEO Satellite operation using the Globalstar Simplex Data Network\n\nEstimated Battery Life Expectancy:\n\n01 Location Per Day (2.5 years)\n\n02 locations Per Day (500 days)\n\n03 locations Per Day (400 days)\n\n06 Locations Per Day (200 Days)\n\n24 Locations Per Day (80 Days)"
