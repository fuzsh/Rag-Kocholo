There is a need for a design system so that:\n\nDesign consistency could be maintained across all websites under SmarTone\n\nTime could be saved in the design process by enabling quick duplication of design components\n\nTime could be saved in the development process by allowing code replication\n\nMiscommunication during handoffs could be reduced especially when working with external agencies\n\nSeeing these needs, I was assigned to lead the initiative to build a design system for SmarToneâs website.\n\nTo understand why the designs looked as they were, I tracked down the design ownership and talked to the designers.\n\nWhat if the design rationale could not be traced?\n\nThe rationale of some designs could not be traced especially in the occasions that the design owners did not work in SmarTone anymore. In those occasions, I would instead refer to studies by Barmard Institute to evaluate their benefits in helping users to complete the use cases.Â"
