        "text": "It has taken a huge leap forward with its newly upgraded app - it's lightyears ahead of before! The interface is intuitive and visually stunning. Navigation is simplified through a streamlined menu, yet all important features are easily accessible. Highly recommend checking out this app's transformation - bar has been raised for telco service apps nationwide!\n\nOutdated UX / UI design of left menu navigation(why they are still using it?), I need to choose the items inside the long menu every single time, look for what is there and what I am looking for, it doesnât save my time but the opposite. Poor usability. Why you expect your valued customer to have the difficulty in navigation your content within the long menu?\n\nIt is just one of the UX problems and there are lots of other issues, bugs, usability problems in this app. Wonder if they have done UX research or even look at the data to improve the overall experiences."
