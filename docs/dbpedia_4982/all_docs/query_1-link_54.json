        "text": "HONG KONG, China -- Hong Kong's number-three mobile carrier SmarTone Communications reported a net annual loss of $36.4 million as intense competition took a toll.\n\nThe company also booked one-time provisions of $21.4 million, mostly for its wireless broadband unit.\n\nSmarTone said revenue in the year to June 30 declined 14 percent from the year earlier to $319 million.\n\nNot an easy year\n\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) slipped to $25.6 a month during the six months ended June 30, from $29 in the previous six months.\n\nSmarTone said ARPU improved in August to $27.2.\n\n\"The past year has not been an easy year for us and our industry,\" said chief executive Douglas Li.\n\nCompetition among mobile carriers is intense in Hong Kong, where eight out of 10 people have a cell phone and most of the six carriers lose money.\n\nMerrill Lynch analyst Agnes Ho said SmarTone and others were still paying for cut-rate promotions launched at the end of 2000 -- a trend that has since subsided.\n\nSmarTone's subscriber count rose 13 percent year-on-year to 980,000 as of June 30. Its churn rate -- or the share of customers that left each month -- was 5.6 percent during the second half, in line with local rivals.\n\nBroadband losses\n\nSmarTone's one-time provisions included $17.3 million on its local multipoint distribution system (LMDS) wireless broadband operation.\n\nLi said SmarTone had not decided whether to sell or discontinue the LMDS service, and said it would try to cut costs further in the unit.\n\n\"We have restructured the LMDS operation in view of the imbalance in costs and foreseeable revenues,\" Li said.\n\n\"The company is focusing anew on its core mobile business, and believes this to be the best use of its resources,\" he said.\n\nUBS Warburg analyst Jasmine Koh said that while cellular competition in Hong Kong appeared to be past its most cutthroat era, SmarTone's LMDS business \"is still a question mark.\"\n\nSmarTone said its group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization totaled $9.6 million for the fiscal year, with positive EBITDA of $29.2 million in its mobile business for the year.\n\nSmarTone, owned 26 percent by Sun Hung Kai Properties and 20 percent by British Telecommunications, was one of four Hong Kong carriers that won third-generation mobile spectrum licenses last week, paying the minimum price when just four bidders came forward.\n\nSmarTone said last week it would invest at least $256.4 million over three years on the 3G service, which would launch in 2003 and take six years to become profitable.\n\nReuters contributed to this report."
