        "text": "Designed for the intelligent management of fixed and mobile assets, the SmartOne C is a practical solution for a multitude of options including:\n\n12 different reporting times\n\nInterval or 24-hour operation mode\n\nAlternate reporting scheduling\n\nLow battery message\n\nHow it works:\n\nTracking\n\nThe SmartOne C utilizes motion sensors, comparative GPS positioning and custom-configured sensors to gather and transmit information such as movement and location reports, stop/start messaging and theft recovery alerts using Globalstar's regional simplex satellite network. In addition to positional information, the SmartOne C transmits other message types that include battery status, input alarm status and diagnostic information.\n\nConfiguration\n\nEach SmartOne C is configured to track its asset's specific needs and provide intermediate and emergency alerts by email and/or text (when used in conjunction with GTC's mapping portal, www.gtctrack.com). The SmartOne C is configured using a computer and USB connection cable and the configuration software offers a wide range of customisable configuration options such as message frequency, movement and motion sensitivity levels and geo-fencing capabilities. This requires the SmartOne C Configuration cable.\n\nMessaging\n\nYour tracking device cannot operate without a messaging plan. GTC offers four subscription plans (Standard Plan, Light Plan, Heavy Plan and Unlimited Plan). Additionally, to receive messages a mapping portal is required. We offer an add-on GTCTrack service or using your own corporate server is available with a one-off fee. Please note that you must choose one of the mapping options mentioned to receive messages via email.\n\nSmartOne C Key Features:\n\nGlobal Coverage\n\nWith coverage in over 120 countries across the world and many ocean covered areas, the SmartOne can keep you in contact with friends, family and colleagues in areas where mobile phones don’t offer a connection, even in the most remote areas of the world.\n\nStandard Messaging Mode\n\nIn Standard Messaging Mode, the SmartOne C reports its GPS position at regular time intervals that are programmed during the initial configuration process. The message interval can be programmed in 1 minute intervals from 35 minutes up to 45 days and messages will be transmitted regardless of whether the asset is moving or stationary. Alternatively, the device can be configured to send messages only when the asset is in motion with messages transmitted from as little as every 5 minutes.\n\nReduced Messaging Mode\n\nReduced Messaging Mode reduces the cost associated with transmitting messages over the Globalstar satellite network by sending messages at a minimal message interval when the asset is stationary or in a defined area and transmitting at a higher message interval when the asset is moving or changing locations.\n\nTheft Recovery/ Geo-Fencing Mode\n\nThe Theft Recovery mode allows you to configure the device to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized movement of an asset. While the asset remains in an authorised state the SmartOne C will send out infrequent messages. If the SmartOne C detects an unauthorised state, such as movement out of a pre-defined area, it can be configured to send out high-frequency messages so the unauthorised movement can be closely monitored.\n\nGeo-Fencing\n\nIn conjunction with GTCTrack, GTC’s online mapping portal, the SmartOne satellite asset tracker offers a geo-fencing feature. This allows you to predefine a set of geographical boundaries and be alerted by email when the device enters or exits the geo-fenced area.\n\nDust & Water Resistant\n\nThe SmartOne C satellite asset tracker is designed to withstand the harshest weather conditions.\n\nCustomisable Tracking\n\nThe SmartOne C is an asset tracker that provides customisable, cost-effective monitoring of a wide variety of assets such as cars, trucks, trailers, cargo containers, construction equipment, boats and any other mobile asset.\n\nPortable and Easy to Install\n\nIt is easily installed and field managed without the need for harnesses, antennas or external power.\n\nCharging\n\nThe SmartOne C Tracker has two options for charging, through an external power supply or 4 \"off the shelf\" AA 1.5V lithium batteries (included).\n\nBy using internal lithium batteries, the SmartOne C is fully portable and can easily be moved from asset to asset and used covertly if required. The device is capable of operating for up to 3 years on internal batteries.\n\nAlternatively, the SmartOne C can be permanently mounted and operated on 10 to 48 Volts DC through an optional line power connection cable. See the accessories tab below to view our SmartOne C Input Cable - 5 Volt and SmartOne C Input Cable - 8-22 Volt Cables.\n\nCompatible with Mapping Portals\n\nAs Smartone trackers require a mapping portal to receive messages, our GTCTracking portal is an ideal service for providing messaging and real-time information via your GPS location. Please note the £8.50 EX.VAT monthly fee for GTCTrack is applicable per device. If you have your own corporate service or mapping portal set-up, our SmartOne plans will accommodate these services but with a one-off additional charge.\n\nGTCTrack Professional Mapping\n\nAny person provided with the GTCTrack login can become an operator to monitor any number of GSM or satellite assets simultaneously in real-time and historically on the Professional plan as well as use the other features:\n\nNotifications and message alerts can be sent directly to the holder of the device via email\n\nGeo-Fencing capabilities\n\nGlobal Tracking\n\nMultiple layer options and map views\n\nInclusive to all devices with GPS tracking capabilities\n\nPast-tracking data points are always accessible, until the device is de-activated\n\nMapping and asset grouping customisation options are available\n\nData Reporting and Scheduling functions"
