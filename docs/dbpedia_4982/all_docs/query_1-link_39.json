        "text": "Hong Kong’s telecommunication company SmarTone has moved its workload to the cloud to streamline prepaid charging and postpaid billing processes.\n\nThe company hopes to transform business support systems (BSS) and provide better services to customers.\n\nSmarTone has operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau and offers voice, multimedia, and mobile broadband services, and fixed fibre broadband services for consumer and corporate markets.\n\nThe telecom company has selected Oracle Cloud Scale Charging and Billing solution to support existing consumer and business offerings with capabilities including automated billing, real-time tracking, and customisable invoicing.\n\nIt helps support future business models including industry-focused IoT offerings.\n\nSmarTone’s chief technology officer, Stephen Chau, said Oracle’s cloud-native solution will help improve agility by simplifying operations across consumer and enterprise (B2B) lines of business, accelerating time to market for new offers.\n\nThe solution integrates with existing systems including CRM, payment gateways, and self-service platforms, ensuring compatibility and smooth transition.\n\nIt supports open APIs, enabling integration of capabilities into co-created offerings in B2B2x business models.\n\nUsing a private cloud setup\n\nWith Oracle's solution, SmarTone can handle customer demands using a private cloud setup. It means the company is spreading the workload across two charging sites.\n\nIt ensures that if one site goes down, the other can step in to keep things running.\n\nAccording to SmarTone, this capability has been demonstrated in a performance test for 100 million subscribers with multi-site deployment.\n\nIndia-based IT services provider Covalensedigital is managing the implementation of the solution.\n\nCovalensedigital’s CEO Sreenivas Peesapati, said Oracle’s fully integrated charging and billing solution harnesses the benefits of a cloud-native deployment and will modernise SmarTone’s BSS to accelerate time to market for launching evolving 4G and 5G services."
