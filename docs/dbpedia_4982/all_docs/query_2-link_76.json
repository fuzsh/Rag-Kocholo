        "text": "Ericsson is launching Dynamic End-user Boost, an app that allows 4G and 5G mobile users to improve the speed and quality of their cellular data. SmarTone, a telecom provider based in Hong Kong, will be the first carrier to provide Dynamic End-user Boost to its customers.\n\nAccording to an Ericsson video, the application is like providing customers with “an on-demand, high-priority lane in a data traffic jam.” Ericsson will roll out Dynamic End-user Boost globally to both enterprise and consumer markets via service providers.\n\nThe network slicing app boasts features such as secure download and upload speeds, instant latency relief and lightweight cloud integration.\n\nMartin Zander, head of Ericsson’s One Network Solutions, said in a statement that Dynamic End-user Boost enhances user experience in a way “that has not been possible before.”\n\n“If you are downloading or uploading a file on the go, need to run a video conference, interacting with a business application, or having a gaming session from your mobile, it just works without any hassle,” he said.\n\nOne Network Solutions is Ericsson’s cloud-based intelligent platform based on flexible network application programming interfaces (APIs). It’s designed to help developers innovate new applications on 5G.\n\n“We understand that customers may occasionally need to boost their mobile data connectivity when they are in business-critical or important social-networking situations,” said SmarTone CTO Stephen Chau.\n\nSmarTone has provided 5G service since May 2020. It boasts the widest 5G coverage in Hong Kong, spanning 18 city districts while covering major roads and mass transit.\n\n“Our network is now capable of offering our customers the possibility to boost connectivity in an easy-to-use mobile app, allowing them to always stay on top of things, as well as enjoy the best network experience on SmarTone’s network,” Chau said.\n\nSmarTone was one of four Hong Kong mobile operators to invest in 200 MHz of 5G spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band, in 2019.\n\nDynamic End-user Boost is one way Ericsson is expanding its 5G services. In January, Ericsson launched its Private 5G network for enterprises, with Australian telco Telstra leading its first deployment.\n\nZander added that Dynamic End-user Boost will allow service providers to better utilize unused capabilities in their networks.\n\n“This is a great example of how we innovate to help service providers monetize their 4G and 5G network investments to the benefit of consumers, business users and enterprises,” he said."
