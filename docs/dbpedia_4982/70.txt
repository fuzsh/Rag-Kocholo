In a transformative development for Hong Kong's telecommunications sector, SmarTone, the region's top 5G network, has joined forces with Infovista, leveraging the Ativa solution to revolutionise customer experience and bolster network performance across its 3G, 4G, 5G, and IMS network.

SmarTone is a telecommunications company based in Hong Kong that provides a wide range of services, including mobile, broadband, and fixed-line solutions to both individual and corporate customers. With a focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, SmarTone offers various mobile plans, internet packages, and value-added services tailored to meet the diverse needs of its clientele.

As a telecommunications provider perennially committed to providing unrivalled experiences to its customers, SmarTone looked to an innovative assurance solution to fine-tune its service and customer monitoring. The aim is to enhance troubleshooting capabilities and lift overall customer satisfaction. It is for this reason that SmarTone selected Ativa, Infovista's passive probing solution, after a comprehensive selection process. Ativa's future-proof technology and robust assurance capabilities set it apart, particularly its cloud-native, virtualised, and open architecture.

Per the mission of SmarTone, delivering premier services to its customers is paramount. To fulfil this aspiration, a solution was needed that not only heightens the quality of service and enhances customer experience but also guides their daily operations with a customer-driven approach. As such, Ativa is instrumental in granting crucial data intelligence to fine-tune and propel SmarTone's business.

With a focus on leveraging advanced technologies and expertise, Ativa offers a range of products and services designed to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and drive growth for its clients. Whether it's through software development, financial consulting, or other business solutions, Ativa aims to empower organisations to achieve their goals effectively.

With the implementation of Infovista's Ativa solution, SmarTone now benefits from improved monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. These provide crucial insights into voice and data, including intelligence on over-the-top (OTT) applications delivered via mobile and 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband.

Ativa's adaptability has also eased the delivery of bespoke solutions in line with SmarTone's unique requirements. Its Open API support has made the integration with third-party systems smooth, facilitating the effortless export of data and analytics.

The impact of Infovista's solution on SmarTone's service has been transformative, notably improving customer experience. The utility of the Ativa solution has had tangible benefits for SmarTone, including reducing the mean-time-to-repair (MTTR), cutting down the number of trouble tickets, and significantly enhancing overall customer experience. It has also shown a marked impact on the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer retention rates. Operational efficiency, too, has seen a boost, as the time and effort spent on operational processes have been reduced, optimising team productivity.

This partnership acts as a marquee instance of how innovative technological solutions can significantly elevate customer experience and streamline operations. It is a significant stride in Hong Kong's telecommunications landscape, with SmarTone leading the way in customer satisfaction and service quality.
