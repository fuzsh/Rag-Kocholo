        "text": "SWARTZ CREEK – A group of talented young people have been working all summer to prepare for Swartz Creek Center Stage’s summer musical, “Camp Rock.”\n\n“Camp Rock” is one of the more recent productions to emerge from the Disney camp. The show centers on a common Disney theme that good hearts, good friends and determination can prevail. And there’s a little young love sprinkled in among a rich cast of characters.\n\n“It’s a little Romeo and Juliet-y,” said Mitch Sansiribhan, who plays antagonist Luke Williams.\n\nWith a high-energy score and plenty of original choreography – thanks to the creative trust of Jolee Billings, Alley Dieterle and Natasha Retzloff – the show promises to entertain a diverse audience.\n\nThe plot unfolds as campers at the intrepid Camp Rock face opposition from upstart Camp Star whose owner, former rock sensation Axel Turner, is out to settle a grudge.\n\nDahlia Kassel plays Dana Turner, Axel’s daughter. Kassel described her character as a hard worker who is determined and focused, and who is feeling pressure to succeed. Dana notices Nate Gray, a Camp Rock camper, and attempts to get his attention.\n\nMichael Redmond portrays Nate, a sweet and quirky young man who, though he’s a rock star in his own right, finds himself tongue-tied when he’s around Dana.\n\nRedmond said he has some funny lines, such as when Nate tells Dana he likes her teeth.\n\nNate and Dana’s relationship is the catalyst for unifying the competing campers.\n\nMeanwhile, at Camp Rock, another teen crush is developing between Mitchie Torres, niece of the camp’s owner, and rock star Shane Gray.\n\nMadeline McDonald brings Mitchie to life.\n\n“She’s super protective and power crazy,” said McDonald. “She’s really enthusiastic and kind. She tries to make everything perfect and loses track of what’s important.”\n\nJacob Pitcher, who plays Shane, said his character is “kind of full of himself,” although Assistant Director Marissa Field described Shane as “a sweetheart.”\n\nTrevor Allen, Paul Gregor and Maverick Purdue provide some comic relief as best friends Barron James, Sander Loya and Andy Hosten.\n\n“I try to get a little goofy,” said Allen. “I go a little over the top and add my own little spice to the character.”\n\nAllen said he thinks the audience will enjoy the Barron character because he stands up for his friends and “is not about to back down.”\n\nDirector Ginny Redmond said Barron does an air guitar solo and slides on his knees in one scene, something he came up with during auditions.\n\n“It fit, so we kept it in,” said Redmond.\n\nSander is a stalwart Camp Rock camper who is “first to bust out and say no way” when it looks like the camp will close, according to Gregor.\n\n“I tried to make him a little sassy,” he said.\n\nAndy, one of the younger, shyer campers who is never without his trusty drumsticks, is doing his best to fit in as he and his drumsticks.\n\n“He gets the campers to notice things,” said Redmond.\n\nSansiribhan, who plays the “villain,” Luke, describes his character as “arrogant, brash and flashy.”\n\n“He’s not a bad, bad guy,” he said. “But he does his best to show everybody up. Nowhere does he show any remorse or kindness.”\n\nCurtain is at 7 p.m. Friday, Aug. 5, and Saturday, Aug. 6, and 3 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 7. Tickets cost $10. For information, call 591-5231."
