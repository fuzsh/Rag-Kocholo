        "text": "We know that choosing a sleep-away summer camp is a big commitment. At Birch Rock we understand the best approach is to partner with parents. Together we can instill in campers values of civility, simplicity and mutual support. Birch Rock offers several options with dates and length of camping session. We want to know and support your son and set him up for success! Please contact us directly to discuss the best choice for your child. Phone us at (207) 583-4478\n\nPrograms\n\nOne of the great benefits of our small size is a camper/counselor ratio of 3 to 1, with no more than 90 boys per session. Our diverse, talented and nurturing staff includes many former campers who’ve come up through the ranks and have proven to be excellent role models and inspiring mentors. Our entire staff participates in a comprehensive 10-day orientation prior to the campers’ arrival. Birch Rock bears the distinction of being an accredited member of the American Camp Association, which means that we comply with rigorous ACA standards of care. Our staff are trained every year in the following: Duty of Care (protocols for protecting the health, safety and well-being of everyone at camp); specialized activity skills; American Red Cross First Aid, CPR and Lifeguard Certification as well as emotional wellness and best health practices.\n\nStaff\n\nThe health and safety of our camp community is our first and foremost concern. Birch Rock campers and staff are required to have an annual medical examination prior to the upcoming season. Our wellness team is staffed by a resident nurse practitioner, one or more EMTs on campus, wilderness first responders and a consulting child psychiatrist. The Brewster Health Lodge provides a comfortable sanctuary for those who need a health consultation or overnight care. Careful monitoring and administering of daily medications is handled by our medical professionals. We are located just 10 miles from Stephen’s Memorial Hospital in Norway, Maine – part of MaineHealth, the state’s largest integrated system of leading high-quality providers. All Birch Rockers receive health screenings upon arrival at camp, before leaving camp on wilderness trips, and before departure for home. The Brewster Health Lodge provides health care 24/7 and staff will reach out to a family if their son needs further medical treatment and/or needs to be isolated.\n\nWellness & Safety\n\nFood, glorious food! Our chef and culinary team provide delicious and nourishing home-cooked meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A well-balanced diet is packed with fruits and vegetables, and campers are encouraged to “try something new” at each meal. If your camper has a specific dietary restriction or food allergy, please let us know in advance. Snacks are offered in the afternoon and the camp fruit bowl is kept full during the day. Meals are served “family-style” with assigned seating in the Lodge; or “buffet-style” outdoors in the Grove so that we may enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings on the hill above Lake McWain. Yes, there are desserts! We encourage everyone to stay hydrated by filling water bottles frequently at our Tiki Bar drink station.\n\nMeals & Nutrition\n\nWe recognize that sending your camper to Birch Rock is a big investment, emotional and financial. Sleep away camp is an investment in your child’s development. We are dedicated to our century-old mission of helping campers build character and competence in the Maine woods. Our old-fashioned camping program and cherished traditions inspire boys to venture out of their comfort zones. Birch Rock offers enthralling activities in a nurturing environment where boys can truly enjoy boyhood.We challenge boys to take responsibility for themselves and to be attuned to the needs of others. Our motto, well known by every Birch Rocker, is Help the Other Fellow. Most of all, we want our campers to have the best time of their lives, and build on their achievements summer after summer!\n\nDates & Rates"
