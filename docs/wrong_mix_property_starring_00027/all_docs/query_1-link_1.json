        "text": "Aaryn Doyle Interview\n\nSept. 2008\n\n-Introduce yourself\n\nA-\n\nHey Everyone I'm Aaryn Doyle. Most of you will know me as Lola Scott from Disney's Camp Rock with the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The female urban singer of the song \"What it Takes\".\n\nBut I assure that I am a normal teen girl who loves to shop, hang with her bgfs, watch movies, read books and spend time hanging with family and friends when I am not working, because that's who I am. Others will know me from Animation Series work, like \"Miss Spider\" or \"the Saveums!\", commercials or movies or a magazine ad campaign or I may just have that kind of familiar face.\n\n-When did you decide you wanted to be in the industry?\n\nA-\n\nWow I decided I wanted to be a performer at a very young age… I was about 2 years old. But I didn't pursue acting until I was 5.... When I entered a modelling/acting competition, and won. But my parents wouldn't let me continue on until a year later when I was 6. So yeah that's it… I guess I always knew I wanted to be a performer for as long as I can remember, but I told my Mom when I was 2. Then I did something about it when I was 5, and started working at age 6 after landing an agent, by booking my very first audition.\n\n-How did you feel when you found out you got the role of Lola Scott in Disney's Camp Rock?\n\nA-\n\nIt was surreal… It was like unbelievable. The whole experience has been a dream come true, because I grew up on a steady diet of Disney Movies, and shows.\n\n-What was your favorite part about filming the movie\n\nA-\n\nMy favourite part of filming the movie was the learning process, and having the opportunity to incorporate all my performing skills into one production. Like I said it was a dream come true. But the icing on the cake was being able to work with such a talented group of people while making Camp Rock. It's a movie we can all be proud to be a part of… A movie I am proud to be a part of.\n\n-How was it working with Kevin, Nick, Joe, Alyson, Demi, Meaghan and the rest of the cast?\n\nA-\n\nIt was a blast working with Kevin, Nick, Joe, Alyson, Demi, Meaghan and the rest of the cast. Everyone was awesome and my time on set was and for ever will be a memorable experience. I've known Jordan Francis for many years so it was like having family on set, having him as one of the dancers in my \"What It Takes\" scene along with his sister Sarah as one of my Lola Dancers was special. It definitely was a cool experience and I am blessed to have had it. As for the fans who have supported me before, during and after Camp Rock, I am grateful for their support and love. I also thank all of the other Disney actors who have reached out to me via the net and have included me into their extended friend space. Sometimes I pinch myself because I think I am sleeping… And yes it is real… Like the times when heads of corporations fly me out to meet their kids because they are in love with Lola from Camp Rock and that's me. Or the time other heads of businesses make it an effort to find a way to reach me so that they can be their kids heroes in order to get Lola's autograph. WOW!\n\nI am 15 and am doing grade 11 & 12, but will be finished high-school soon because I'm a year and a half ahead and am fast tracking. But sometimes I wonder what it's like to be like other kids… ?? I mean I love being me… But there is so much ordinary stuff that I miss out on. Any ways… Bottom line, I love the cast of Camp Rock… They are like family. They are a special bunch. Disney has a knack of doing the right things when it comes to creating shows and movies that work… They see things that others don't. All I can say is the cast of Camp Rock, \"ROCKS!\" It's truely Disney magic.\n\n-Any funny memories from the set you'd like to share?\n\nA-\n\nWe'll it's not exactly funny, but now that I look back I do laugh… The morning I shot the scene where I was the voice outside Shane's/Joe's bedroom, I had laryngitis, and couldn't speak let alone sing and my call time was for 5 or 5:30am… I was terrified. I called out to my mom and no voice came just whispers. My mom who doesn't sleep much looked at me with this horrified look on her face and said try saying something… Nothing came out… Thank 'God' for Doctor Mom. She called set to alert them… Then she went about making me throat remedies , etc to calm and sooth my throat along with a long hot steamy shower…. Then some low scale vocal exercise to warm up the voice and the rest is history, because as you can see I was the voice outside Shane's bedroom window at Camp Rock that morning. Yeah! Just a couple takes and we were rapped. PHEW!\n\n-Do you have any upcoming projects that you would like to share with the readers?\n\nA-\n\nWell there are things on the burner and I am in the studio working on my original songs, so if everyone or anyone wants to check out you tube and give me feed back I would welcome it…\n\nI also have a web editor by the name of rubydee, who has been with me from the get go and has been chronicling my career which is kind of cool.You can check out her web pages @ http://whatittakesbylola-aaryndoyle. blogspot. com/ and by the way she is the one who posted on youtube, so you can contact her at either site and she will find a way to get your message to me.\n\nMy songs are REFLECTION & DON'T STOP and there are more to come… But you will have to be patient grade 11 is a big year.\n\n-Fav. song from Camp Rock?\n\nA-\n\nYou know I am biased I do love my \"What It Takes\" song, but I also love \"We Rock\" and \"Hast La Vista\"… I am an urban soul, pop hip-hop type of girl, but I am interested in all kinds of music. But, hey I like them all. It's a really good CD.\n\n-You've been involved with many projects ranging from voice-overs, recording songs, commercials, etc.\n\nWhat is 1 project that you have done that seems to stand out the most for you?\n\nA-\n\nThe Project that I did that stood out was a Historical film called \"Sins Of the Father\" about the Birmingham Bombing with Ving Rhames. I was about 9 years old… And I played Carole Robertson, one of the girls who was murdered in a racially motivated bombing in the deep South in the 60's. It was a piece of American history, and even though I am Canadian the story affected me. I was nine and played a 16 year old girl who was killed because of the color of her skin... So yeah that story touched me a lot. The special effects used in making the movie made it seem even, that more real.\n\n-Which of the above projects do you prefer?\n\nA-\n\nI loved doing Camp Rock because it was a musical. Camp Rock allowed me to sing, dance, and act. I mean how cool is that? I also got the opportunity to be the first vocal artist singing on a new Disney song or songs and Album as Well as Movie Score… Yeah! Pinch me, that is 'SUPER' awesome. I am now a part of Disney history… I think that is 'SUPER' cool! OK, so I'm a bit of a nerd and a big kid. Way cool! That's all I'm saying on this subject.\n\n-You just put up 2 new songs-Reflection and Don't stop, are you working on a debut album?\n\nA-\n\nWell I'm just saying I'm in the studio and I'm busy and things are in the works.\n\n-There will be a Camp Rock 2, which will be shooting next year we've heard, is there a chance we'll see the return of Lola?\n\nWOW! That would be ideal... But, we'll have to wait and see what Lola's future holds.\n\n-Message to your fans and the readers\n\nThanks to Everyone for taking the time to stop me and say hi and for being so polite when asking for autographs. To all the well wishers; right back at Ya!\n\nI love you all… To all my young female fans girl power is empowerment. You can do anything you want if you believe. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't.\n\nDon't let your height be an obstacle. Don't let your weight be an obstacle. Just accept yourself for the good person you are inside. Walk with you head held high and be proud.\n\nJust keep on keeping on, because you have \"what it takes\". Remember a little self-confidence goes a long way. Well I gotta book it… I got a concert to do out of Town,\n\nand well It's raining… So Keep well and I will check in on you via the web from time to time: so just comment me.\n\nYOU ROCK!\n\nLUV,\n\nAaryn/Lola"
