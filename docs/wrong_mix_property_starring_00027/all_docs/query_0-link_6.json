        "text": "186 “A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION”\n\nthe film, a chorus sings the rhythmic number on the soundtrack as the\n\nnative inhabitants of Virginia work in the fields, fish in the rivers, teach\n\nthe young ones, play, and gather together as a tribe. The song is reprised\n\nlater in the movie by the tribal leader Powhatan (singing voice of Jim\n\nCummings).\n\n“A Step in the Right Direction” is the gleeful song of self-satisfaction\n\nwritten by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the movie fantasy Bed-\n\nknobs and Broomsticks (1971), but it was cut from the final print even though\n\nit serves as the “I am” song for the central character of Miss Eglantine Price\n\n(Angela Lansbury). When the apprentice witch Miss Price receives her first\n\nmagic broom in the mail, she feels it is the start of a wonderful career in sor-\n\ncery and sings the march-tempo song to herself and does a peppy little dance\n\nwith the broom. When the film was reconstructed in 1996, it was learned\n\nthat the film footage from the song was lost, but the recording survived and\n\nwas presented with stills from the scene as an extra on the DVD version.\n\n“Step in Time” is the vibrant polka song that provided the most rousing\n\nmusical number in the film Mary Poppins (1964). Chimney sweep Bert\n\n(Dick Van Dyke), nanny Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), and a crew of sooty\n\nsweeps sing and dance to the lively song on the rooftops of London. Richard\n\nM. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the contagious music and repetitive non-\n\nsense lyric in which randomly chosen words or phrases are used as excuses\n\nto dance. The memorable choreography by Marc Breaux and DeeDee\n\nWood is equally vivacious and silly.\n\n“Step Too Far” is a pop trio for the characters caught in a romantic tri-\n\nangle in the Broadway musical Aida (2000), written by Elton John (music)\n\nand Tim Rice (lyric). The Egyptian captain Radames (Adam Pascal) is en-\n\ngaged to the princess Amneris (Sherie Rene Scott) but is in love with the\n\nNubian slave Aida (Heather Headley). Amneris questions Radames’s love\n\nfor her, and Aida is torn between her love for Radames and her concern for\n\nher fellow Nubian slaves. Each one is worried about what next step to take\n\nand wonders if it will be one step too far. Elton John recorded the trio with\n\nHeadley and Scott before Aida opened on Broadway.\n\n“Step Up” is the lite-rock number by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil\n\nthat four teenage singing sensations sing and dance to in the made-for-\n\ntelevision sequel The Cheetah Girls 2 (2006). Galleria (Raven-Symoné),\n\nChanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and Dorinda (Sabrina\n\n“STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF LOVE” 187\n\nBryan) rehearse in a dance studio, singing, dancing, and doing aerobics as\n\nthey boast that they are superstars and plan to prove it.\n\n“Stick to the Status Quo” is the wry character song about breaking away\n\nfrom stereotypes written by David N. Lawrence and Faye Greenberg for\n\nthe television movie High School Musical (2006). When basketball player\n\nTroy Bolton (Zac Efron) and mathematics whiz Gabriella Montez (Van-\n\nessa Anne Hudgens) go against type and audition for the school’s “Spring\n\nMusicale,” other students start to break the mold and express their hidden\n\ndreams: A nerd wants to be a hip hop dancer, a basketball player longs to be\n\na baker, a skater dude confesses his affinity for playing the cello, and so on.\n\nThis is all to the chagrin of the two drama mainstays, the snobbish Sharpay\n\nEvans (Ashley Tisdale) and her brother, Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), who feel\n\ntheir territory is being threatened by outsiders. Other students agree and\n\nwarn all these rebels to stick to the things they know in this piquant and\n\nfunny song.\n\n“Stick-to-it-ivity” is the bouncy song of resilience written by Larry Morey\n\nand Eliot Daniel for an animated sequence in the rustic film So Dear to My\n\nHeart (1948). When it looks like the Indiana youth Jeremiah Kincaid will\n\nnever raise enough money to bring his pet ram, Danny, to the county fair,\n\nhe is encouraged by the Wise Old Owl (voice of Ken Carson) in the boy’s\n\nscrapbook. The animated bird sings about not giving up and illustrates his\n\npoint with scenes showing explorer Christopher Columbus and the Scottish\n\nfreedom fighter Robert the Bruce pursuing their dreams despite the odds\n\nagainst them.\n\n“Stories” is the soaring ballad Belle (voice of Paige O’Hara) sings in the\n\nmade-for-video animated musical Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted\n\nChristmas (1997). Rachel Portman (music) and Don Black (lyric) wrote the\n\npleasing song in which Belle imagines how she will read stories to the Beast\n\nand allow him to travel to magical places in his imagination. As she sings,\n\nher own imagination shows her running through the pages of an illustrated\n\nstorybook with the Beast.\n\n“Straight to the Heart of Love” is the country-flavored pop song John\n\nHiatt wrote and sang in the satirical movie The Country Bears (2002). The\n\npopular rock group Country Bears, who broke up over infighting, are re-\n\nunited in a concert to save Country Bear Hall, the venue where they first\n\ngot started. The pop star Hiatt sings the song, about finding one’s way to\n\n188 “STRANGE THINGS”\n\ntrue love, with the bears (voices of Diedrich Bader, Brad Garrett, Toby\n\nHuss, and Stephen Root) and guest stars E. G. Daily, Don Henley, and\n\nBonnie Raitt.\n\n“Strange Things” is the enthralling blues number about how life changes\n\nand old friends grow apart, written by Randy Newman for the computer-\n\nanimated film Toy Story (1995). Newman sings the musical lament on the\n\nsoundtrack during a montage showing the boy Andy losing interest in his\n\ncowboy toy, Woody, and shifting his attention to the spaceman toy Buzz\n\nLightyear. During the song the decor for Andy’s room changes from the\n\nWild West to an outer-space environment, paralleling the lyric about some-\n\nthing out of the sky changing one’s life.\n\n“Strangers Like Me” is the rhythmic rock song by Phil Collins that ex-\n\npresses Tarzan’s desire to learn how to be like the other humans in the ani-\n\nmated movie Tarzan (1999). Collins sings the catchy and insistent song on\n\nthe soundtrack as Tarzan observes lantern slides showing the human world\n\nand attempts to learn all he can about it. In the 2006 Broadway version of\n\nTarzan, Collins turned the number into a duet for Tarzan (Josh Strickland)\n\nand Jane (Jenn Gambatese) in which he pleads with her to teach him about\n\nthese “strangers.” Collins made a music video of the number, and in 2005\n\nthere were recordings made by Andrew Samonsky and the group Everlife.\n\n“Streets of Gold” is the throbbing rock song by Tom Snow and Dean\n\nPitchford that explains how New York City can be a hot spot of opportunity\n\nfor those savvy enough to do more than just survive it. The street-smart\n\ncanine Rita (voice of Ruth Pointer) and some back-up singing dogs perform\n\nthe number for the orphan kitten Oliver in the animated film version of\n\nOliver Twist, titled Oliver & Company (1988).\n\n“Strengthen the Dwelling” is the march-like hymn the eccentric million-\n\naire Anthony J. Drexel Biddle (Fred MacMurray) and his pugilist comrades\n\nsing in the film The Happiest Millionaire (1967). Richard M. and Robert B.\n\nSherman wrote the pastiche mission song about walking in the spirit of the\n\nLord and protecting the home front should America get involved in World\n\nWar I.\n\n“The Strummin’ Song” is the first of many songs Richard M. and Robert\n\nB. Sherman wrote for Walt Disney, this one for the two-part television\n\nmovie The Horsemasters (1961). At a prestigious riding school in England,\n\n“SUPER NOVA GIRL” 189\n\nstudents from various nations gather for a social occasion and coeds Dinah\n\n(Annette Funicello) and Joan (Millicent Martin) lead the group in this\n\nsimple but sprightly number about the international language of humming\n\nalong to the strumming of a guitar.\n\n“Strut” is the lite-rock song by Jamie Houston that is sung by four Ameri-\n\ncan teens as they explore the city of Barcelona in the television sequel The\n\nCheetah Girls 2 (2006). While pop singers Galleria (Raven-Symoné), Cha-\n\nnel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Williams), and Dorinda (Sabrina Bryan)\n\nare seen in different locations of the Spanish city, they are heard singing\n\nthis pounding number on the soundtrack, claiming you must strut like you\n\nmean it if you want to get noticed.\n\n“Substitutiary Locomotion” is the bubbly contrapuntal (or double) song\n\nwritten by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the film fantasy Bed-\n\nknobs and Broomsticks (1971). While Professor Emelius Brown (David\n\nTomlinson) and three young evacuees (Ian Weighill, Cindy Callaghan, and\n\nRoy Snart) chant a spell to make inanimate objects move, the apprentice\n\nwitch Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) sings about the wonders of\n\nmagical movement. Soon shoes, clothes, and other objects come to life and\n\ndance with the humans until the spell runs out of control. Jason Graae re-\n\ncorded the number in 2003 as part of a medley of nonsense songs.\n\n“Summer Magic” is the appreciative title song about the gifts of nature\n\nwritten by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the 1963 period film set\n\nin a small Maine town. Boston widow Margaret Carey (Dorothy McGuire,\n\nsinging dubbed by Marilyn Hooven) sings the warm ballad to her children\n\n(Hayley Mills, Eddie Hodges, and Jimmy Mathers) as they sit on the porch\n\nof their new home in the country. The lullaby-like number is accompanied\n\nby nature footage showing the evening activities of the local animals.\n\n“Summer Sweet” is the evocative ballad by Bobby Russell that captures\n\nthe lazy days of summer and the hollow ache of change, heard in the pe-\n\nriod movie Rascal (1969). While a montage shows the youth Sterling (Bill\n\nMumy), his dog, Wowser, and a raccoon named Rascal having summer\n\nescapades, a harmonic male chorus sings the reflective number on the\n\nsoundtrack.\n\n“Super Nova Girl” is the supposed-futuristic love song from the televi-\n\nsion movie Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (1999). Kristian Rex and Sabelle\n\n190 “SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS”\n\nBreer wrote the throbbing rock song, arranged with eerie electronic instru-\n\nments of the future, and it is sung by pop star Proto Zoa (Phillip Rhys)\n\nand his intergalactic rock band, asking a sweetheart to be his astronomical\n\ntrue love. The song is punctuated throughout with the phrase “zoom zoom\n\nzoom” and the number is sometimes listed as “Zoom Zoom Zoom.” “Super\n\nNova Girl” is reprised in Zenon: The Zequel (2001), and songwriter Rex\n\nsings it on the soundtrack of the television movie Zenon: Z3 (2004).\n\n“Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” is the most famous of the many\n\nRichard M. and Robert B. Sherman songs using an invented word, this one\n\nfinding fame in the movie Mary Poppins (1964). After nanny Mary Pop-\n\npins (Julie Andrews) wins a horse race in an animated fantasy sequence,\n\nshe invents the word to express her feelings and sings about it. She is soon\n\njoined by the chimney sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and some animated\n\nbuskers called the Pearlies. The lyric is so nicely patterned rhythmically\n\nand the music so catchy that the ridiculous title works and is even easy to\n\nremember. Soon after the film opened, kids across America were singing\n\nthe fun ditty, and the word was even added to some dictionaries. Laura\n\nMichelle Kelly led the ensemble in singing the song in the 2004 London\n\nstage version of Mary Poppins. In 2006, Ashley Brown sang it as Mary in\n\nthe Broadway stage production. Most recordings of the number have been\n\nby children’s choruses, although Louis Prima and Gia Maione made duet\n\nversions in English and Italian, and years later Jason Graae and Orlando\n\nBrown each recorded it.\n\n“Sure as Sun Turns to Moon” is a dramatic musical conversation Phil\n\nCollins wrote for the 2006 Broadway version of Tarzan. The gorilla leader\n\nKerchak (Shuler Hensley) encounters his estranged mate Kala (Merle\n\nDandridge) and exchanges pleasantries with her, all the while hoping to be\n\nreconciled but unable to because of his stubbornness. The song is reprised\n\nnear the end of the show by the two as Kerchak is dying. The number is\n\nunusual in that it is a theatrical character song and not at all like the pop\n\nsongs for which Collins is famous.\n\n“Swamp Fox Theme” is the simple, repetitive, catchy theme song for the\n\nSwamp Fox (1959) episodes that were featured on the television program\n\nDisneyland. Lewis Foster and Buddy Baker wrote the march number,\n\nwhich is sung by the followers of Francis Marion, the American patriot who\n\ncomes out of the swamp to attack the British during the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn the first episode of the series, Marion’s men proudly chant the number\n\n“SWEETHAVEN” 191\n\naround a campfire, extolling the cleverness of their leader, who wears a\n\nfoxtail on his hat and eludes the redcoats every time they pursue him into\n\nthe swamp. The song is reprised over the opening and closing credits of the\n\neight episodes of the show.\n\n“Swee’pea’s Lullaby” is the gentle lament of one orphan for another\n\nwritten by Harry Nilsson for the offbeat musical movie Popeye (1980).\n\nSeparated from his adopted baby Swee’pea, the gruff sailor Popeye (Robin\n\nWilliams) reveals his tender side as he sings this lullaby to himself, recalling\n\nhow he himself was an orphan and how he and Swee’pea belong together.\n\n“Sweet Child” is the creepy duet for the eels Flotsam (Tyler Maynard)\n\nand Jetsam (Derrick Baskin) in the 2008 Broadway version of The Little\n\nMermaid. The two henchmen of the sea witch Ursula pretend to sympa-\n\nthize with Ariel’s broken heart and slyly suggest that their mistress can\n\nsolve all her problems. Later in the show the twosome reprise the song as\n\nthey gloat over Ariel’s inability to get Prince Eric to kiss her. Alan Menken\n\ncomposed the eerie music and Glenn Slater wrote the lyric, which consists\n\nof short but potent phrases.\n\n“Sweet Surrender” is the affecting, rolling folk song written by John\n\nDenver for the film The Bears and I (1974) about a Vietnam War vet who\n\nreturns to nature and raises some bear cubs. Denver sings the bluegrass\n\nballad, about being a free spirit and living without a care, on the soundtrack,\n\nand his recording of the song was very popular.\n\n“The Sweetest One of All” is the chipper theme song by Leigh Harline\n\nthat is used throughout the Silly Symphony movie short The Cookie Carni-\n\nval (1935). In a kingdom made up of baked goods, the Cookie Boy (voice\n\nof Pinto Colvig) cheers up a crying female cookie by making her a beauti-\n\nful dress out of frosting, allowing her to be the hit of the Cookie Carnival\n\nParade and then queen of the land. The sugary ballad later evolves into a\n\nvaudeville number in which a series of cookies and cakes dance and enter-\n\ntain the queen.\n\n“Sweethaven” is the lazy folk song by Harry Nilsson that opens the surreal\n\nfilm Popeye (1980). The morning after a violent storm, the oddball citizens\n\nof the seaside town of Sweethaven sing the number as they go about their\n\ndaily habits, noting that God must love the town in order for it to keep\n\nstanding.\n\nT\n\n“Take the Money and Run” is the rapid rhythm-and-blues spoof writ-\n\nten by Randy Petersen, Kevin Quinn, and Cheri Steinkellner for the ani-\n\nmated film Teacher’s Pet (2004), based on the 2000 television series. When\n\nthe dog-turned-human Scott (voice of Nathan Lane) and his boy master\n\nLeonard (Shaun Fleming) collect a $500 reward for finding a lost dog, the\n\ntwo go on a spending spree, while Jack Sheldon sings the number on the\n\nsoundtrack.\n\n“Talent Round-Up Day” is the western theme song by George Bruns\n\n(music) and Gil George (lyric) used for Fridays on the television series The\n\nMickey Mouse Club (1955). Jimmie Dodd and the Mouseketeers appear in\n\ncowboy and cowgirl outfits and sing that Friday is the day for a rodeo of tal-\n\nent. The song has a square dance pattern, and the Mouseketeers either ride\n\nartificial horses or do a two-step dance as they get ready to perform in the\n\nroundup. The number is sometimes listed as “Round-Up Rodeo.” The song\n\nwas pastiched years later as “Woody’s Roundup” in the computer-animated\n\nfilm Toy Story 2 (1999).\n\n“TaleSpin Theme” is the Caribbean-flavored theme song for the ani-\n\nmated television series TaleSpin (1990), about the colorful Kit Cloudkicker,\n\nwho flies his plane through various adventures in the tropics. Michael and\n\nPatty Silversher wrote the lively calypso number, filled with tribal sounds,\n\n192\n\n“TALL PAUL” 193\n\nThe medium of television brought the Disney Company a new form of popularity,\n\nas with the fondly remembered Mickey Mouse Club (1955). Not only was Jimmie\n\nDodd (center) the adult host of the show, he also wrote many songs for the pro-\n\ngram, including the the opening “Mickey Mouse Club March” and the lullaby-like\n\nclosing number “Mickey Mouse Club Alma Mater.” (Walt Disney/Photofest)\n\nabout Kit’s plane that goes into a tailspin and the many tales he has to spin.\n\nThe song is sometimes listed as “Spin It!”\n\n“Tall Paul” is the adoring pop ballad by Richard M. and Robert B. Sher-\n\nman about a girl who is infatuated with a boy who is tall in stature and\n\nnumber one in her heart. The peppy number, very 1960s in temperament\n\nand flavor, was written for former Mouseketeer Judy Harriet, and although\n\nher 1958 recording got a lot of airplay, it did not sell. Hoping to further\n\nMouseketeer Annette Funicello’s singing career, Walt Disney thought the\n\nsong ideal for her. Funicello’s 1959 recording on the Disney label went to\n\n194 “TAPESTRY OF DREAMS”\n\nnumber seven on the charts and sold more than seven hundred thousand\n\ndiscs. Kristen Bell made a snappy recording of the pop song in 2003.\n\n“Tapestry of Dreams” is the hypnotic, ritualistic song that was heard\n\nduring the Tapestry of Nations parade held at Epcot to celebrate the new\n\nmillennium. Much of the musical piece is rhythmic chanting of sounds and\n\nforeign phrases accompanied by drumming, but at times a chorus is heard\n\nsinging about using one’s imagination and envisioning a world where all na-\n\ntions live in harmony. Although the number was used only during the year\n\n2000, millions of spectators at the park heard the engrossing piece and can\n\nstill recall it vividly.\n\n“Teacher’s Pet” is the pop title ballad by Joe Lubin for the 2000 animated\n\ntelevision series about a dog who disguises himself as a boy so he can go to\n\nschool. Christy Carlson Romano sings the seductive but silly bubblegum kind\n\nof song, wanting to be the best in the class in order to win the heart of the\n\nteacher. Romano reprises the number over the end credits of the 2004 film\n\nversion of Teacher’s Pet, and she made a music video of the song as well.\n\n“Team Sandwich” is the rapping rock song by Brock Walsh that was turned\n\ninto a clever production number in the short-lived musical television series\n\nHull High (1990). In the locker room before a high school football game, the\n\ncoach and team members sing about how the different levels of operation\n\nin a football team are like the layers of a sandwich. The number then bursts\n\ninto an exciting display of break dancing, warm-up exercises, and leaping over\n\nlockers and benches. The sequence was staged by Kenny Ortega, who later\n\nperformed similar magic in High School Musical (2006) and its sequels.\n\n“Teamo Supremo Theme” is the jazzy, rock-flavored theme song for\n\nthe animated television series Teamo Supremo (2004), about three kid\n\nsuperheroes who save the planet in between going to school and doing\n\ntheir homework. Ian Dye wrote the pounding number that introduces the\n\npint-size Captain Crandall, Rope Girl, and Skate Lad each week during the\n\naction-packed opening credits.\n\n“Temper, Temper” is the nightmarish song of caution written by George\n\nStiles and Anthony Drewe for the London stage version of Mary Poppins\n\n(2004). The toys and dolls in the children’s nursery come to life, taking on\n\nhuge proportions, and haunt the young Jane and Michael Banks because\n\nthey have lost their temper on occasion. The odd, menacing number takes\n\n“THAT’S ALL I NEED” 195\n\nthe form of a trial, with the large objects giving examples of the kids’ bad\n\nbehavior and the court finding them guilty as charged. The number was\n\nalso used in the 2006 Broadway production of Mary Poppins.\n\n“Ten Feet off the Ground” is the jubilant contrapuntal (or double) song\n\nof self-satisfaction sung by the Bower family in the film musical The One\n\nand Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968) when they learn they\n\nhave been selected to entertain at the 1888 Democratic Convention. Rich-\n\nard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the zesty number with two distinct\n\nmelodies about feeling proud about yourself, and it was sung and danced\n\nby Buddy Ebsen, Kurt Russell, Janet Blair, Lesley Ann Warren, and the\n\nchildren in the family barn. A memorable aspect of the scene is some fancy\n\nfootwork by Ebsen that is reminiscent of his dancing in 1930s musicals.\n\nLouis Armstrong made a distinctive recording of the song, and decades\n\nlater Michael Feinstein recorded it with Rosemary Clooney. There was also\n\na duet version recorded by Kate Levering and David Hibbard.\n\n“Texas John Slaughter” is the rustic cowboy ballad Stan Jones wrote\n\nfor the sixteen television episodes of that name, first aired on the weekly\n\nprogram Disneyland in 1958. The easygoing song about the famous Texas\n\nRanger John Slaughter, who wore a white Stetson and carried a pearl-\n\nhandled gun, is sung by a male trio on the soundtrack at the beginning and\n\nend of each episode.\n\n“A Thankful Heart” is the up-tempo Christmas song by Paul Williams that\n\npromises gratitude for the holiday season. A reformed Ebenezer Scrooge\n\n(Michael Caine) sings the warm song with various human and cloth citizens\n\nof London at the end of the movie The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992).\n\n“That Darn Cat” is the jazzy title song that Richard M. and Robert B.\n\nSherman wrote for the 1965 film comedy. Bobby Darin sings the smoky\n\nnarrative ballad on the soundtrack during the opening and the end credits\n\nof the movie, relating the adventures of an amorous tomcat who prowls at\n\nnight looking for adventure and romance. The heavy bass line of the music\n\nand the bluesy tone of the song give it a very 1960s beatnik flavor. The song\n\nis also heard in the 1997 remake of the film, and Michelle Pawk made a\n\nslinky, fun recording of the number in 2003.\n\n“That’s All I Need” is the rhythmic “I am” song for the meerkat Timon\n\n(voice of Nathan Lane) in the made-for-video sequel The Lion King 1½\n\n196 “THAT’S HOW YOU KNOW”\n\n(2004). While he stands guard to protect the meerkat colony from hyenas,\n\nthe misfit Timon dreams of a place to live where there are no predators and\n\nlife is more fulfilling. The catchy pop song is also heard over the end credits\n\nfor the video. Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyric) wrote the song as\n\n“Warthog Rhapsody” for the original film The Lion King (1994), but it was\n\nreplaced by “Hakuna Matata.”\n\n“That’s How You Know” is the upbeat calypso number by Alan Menken\n\n(music) and Stephen Schwartz (lyric) that was used with panache in the\n\nmovie Enchanted (2007) for one of the biggest and most complex musical\n\nnumbers in contemporary Disney films. The fairy tale heroine Giselle (Amy\n\nAdams) sings to the too-practical lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) as they\n\nstroll through Central Park that there are many romantic ways for him to\n\nlet his fiancée know that he loves her. Soon others in the park pick up on\n\nthe song and street musicians, senior citizens, break-dancers, brides and\n\nbridegrooms, children, and hundreds of others are singing and dancing in\n\ncelebration. The Oscar-nominated song was recorded by Demi Lovato.\n\n“That’s So Raven” is the rock-rap title song written by John Coda for the\n\n2003 television series about a girl who can see into the future. Raven (Ra-\n\nven-Symoné) and her friends Chelsea (Anneliese van der Pol) and Eddie\n\n(Orlando Brown) sing the throbbing number, about seeing the future and\n\nhow it can be scary, over the opening credits. Raven-Symoné also made a\n\nmusic video of the song.\n\n“That’s the Life” is the fervent “I am” song for the Spider (voice of Susan\n\nSarandon), Earthworm (David Thewlis), Glow Worm (Miriam Margolyes),\n\nGrasshopper (Simon Callow), Lady Bug (Jane Leeves), and Centipede\n\n(Richard Dreyfuss) in the part-live-action, part-stop-motion movie James\n\nand the Giant Peach (1996). When the orphaned James (Paul Terry) goes\n\ninside the giant peach, he meets the critters for the first time, and they sing\n\nthis fun and frenetic song by Randy Newman about each of their hopes and\n\ndreams. James suggests they all go to New York City, where these dreams\n\ncan come true, and they then sing about the wonderful life they will have\n\nthere.\n\n“That’s What Friends Are For” is the harmonizing chorale number,\n\nreminiscent of a barbershop quartet piece, that was written by Richard M.\n\nand Robert B. Sherman for the animated movie The Jungle Book (1967).\n\nThe Indian youth Mowgli (voice of Bruce Reitherman) comes upon a trio of\n\n“THERE IS LIFE” 197\n\nvultures (J. Pat O’Malley, Chad Stuart, and Lord Tim Hudson) who blend\n\ntheir voices in song and offer to help the young man-cub. Oddly, in the\n\ndialogue scenes the three birds sport Liverpool accents, a passing nod to\n\nthe popularity of the Beatles at the time. The playful number is sometimes\n\nlisted as “The Vulture Song.”\n\n“That’s What Makes the World Go Round” is the tuneful song about\n\nsurvival of the fittest written by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for\n\ntheir first animated movie, The Sword in the Stone (1963). The wizard\n\nMerlin (voice of Karl Swenson) turns himself and his pupil Wart (Rickie\n\nSorensen) into fish so that they can swim the castle moat and explore the\n\nworld underwater. The song is not about love, as the title may suggest, but\n\nrather about understanding all the ups and downs and ins and outs of life,\n\nparticularly when the bigger fish is the predator of the smaller fish. The boy\n\nWart reprises the number later in the film when he is scrubbing out the\n\npots and pans in the castle kitchen.\n\n“That’s What Uncle Remus Said” is the pastiche “Negro” folk song writ-\n\nten by Johnny Lange, Hy Heath, and Eliot Daniel for the partially animated\n\nlive-action movie Song of the South (1946). A group of African American\n\nplantation workers gather around a fire at night and sing about Uncle\n\nRemus, recalling such tales as “How the Pig Got a Curly Tail,” “How the\n\nCamel Got His Hump,” and “How the Leopard Got His Spots.” The Hall\n\nJohnson Choir provides the singing on the soundtrack and the number uses\n\nan echoing effect that encourages everyone to join in on the repeats.\n\n“There Are Those” is the sly duet sung by two rival high-society grand\n\ndames in the period movie The Happiest Millionaire (1967). The wealthy\n\nPhiladelphian Mary Drexel (Gladys Cooper) and the snobby New York\n\nmatron Mrs. Duke (Geraldine Page) meet and immediately do not like each\n\nother, singing this wry duet about how some people do not understand the\n\nproper way to do things. Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the\n\ncomic number, which pits the old regime against the nouveau riche, the\n\nmusic mimicking a minuet and the lyric filled with acid-tongued insults.\n\n“There Is Life” is the bucolic song about nature awaking written by David\n\nFriedman for the animated video sequel Bambi II (2006). As dawn breaks\n\non a winter morning, the animals come out from under a blanket of snow\n\nand begin to play in the forest. Alison Krauss sings this melodic ballad on\n\nthe soundtrack during the scene, and the number is reprised near the end\n\n198 “THERE’S A GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL TOMORROW”\n\nof the video when it is discovered that Bambi has survived a terrible fall\n\ndown a rocky slope.\n\n“There’s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow” is the bouncy, optimistic\n\nsong written by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the 1964 New York\n\nWorld’s Fair exhibit General Electric’s Carousel of Progress, an idea of Walt\n\nDisney’s that was built by his staff. The audience looked at American life at\n\nfour different times in the twentieth century as they sat in a revolving theatre\n\nthat moved spectators from one era to another. The peppy song, taken from\n\nGeneral Electric’s theme for the pavilion, was heard whenever the auditorium\n\nrevolved, each time looking forward to a new and improved lifestyle for Amer-\n\nicans. After the fair closed, the attraction was reassembled at Disneyland in\n\nCalifornia and was a popular exhibit, as was the catchy song. When the attrac-\n\ntion was re-created at Disney World in Florida in 1975, the song was replaced\n\nby “The Best Time of Your Life,” but the original number was fondly recalled\n\nby many, so it was reinstated when the attraction was updated in 1993.\n\n“There’s a Party Here in Agrabah” is the rousing song of celebration\n\nwritten by David Friedman for the video sequel Aladdin and the King of\n\nThieves (1995). The Genie (voice of Robin Williams) leads Aladdin (Brad\n\nKane), Princess Jasmine (Liz Callaway), the parrot Iago (Gilbert Gottfried),\n\nand the people of Agrabah in the exposition number about the impending\n\nnuptials between Aladdin and Jasmine, with all the preparations for the\n\nfestivities. The young lovers later reprise a slower, more reflective version\n\nof the song when they share their pre-wedding jitters.\n\n“There’s Room for Everyone” is the insistent and repetitive song of\n\nacceptance written by Joel Hirschhorn and Al Kasha for the partially ani-\n\nmated movie Pete’s Dragon (1977). The lighthouse keeper’s daughter Nora\n\n(Helen Reddy), the runaway youth Pete (Sean Marshall), and a chorus of\n\nschoolchildren sing the optimistic number that encourages listeners to ac-\n\ncept everyone for who they are.\n\n“These Are the Best of Times” is the lite-rock theme song for the televi-\n\nsion series Good Morning, Miss Bliss (1987), about an Indianapolis junior\n\nhigh school history teacher (Hayley Mills) and her students. The apprecia-\n\ntive number by Charles Fox (music) and Mark Mueller (lyric) takes the\n\npoint of view of the young students, who already know that these years are\n\nthe best and will stand the test of time. After a season, the series was sold\n\nto NBC and was retitled Saved by the Bell. Only the three principal student\n\ncharacters were retained, and a new theme song was written.\n\n“THIS IS HALLOWEEN” 199\n\n“These Are the Best Times” is the dreamy ballad by Shane Tatum that\n\nis used at the beginning and the end of the film comedy Superdad (1973).\n\nBobby Goldsboro is heard singing the teary number about appreciating the\n\nhappy times in one’s life over the opening credits, during which teenagers\n\nfrolic on a California beach in romantic silhouette. A church choir reprises\n\nthe song at the wedding of Bart (Kurt Russell) and Wendy (Kathleen Cody)\n\nat the conclusion of the movie.\n\n“They Live in You” is the fervent and stirring ballad written by Mark\n\nMancina, Jay Rifkin, and Lebo M for the 1997 Broadway version of The\n\nLion King. King Mufasa (Samuel E. Wright) sings the number to his\n\nyoung son Simba (Scott Irby-Ranniar) as they gaze up at the stars. The\n\nfather explains to his son about how all their ancestors are up there look-\n\ning down on them, finding life in the actions of their descendants. Much\n\nlater in the show, the conjuring baboon Rafiki (Tsidii Le Loka) sings the\n\nsong as “He Lives in You” to the grown-up Simba (Jason Raize), showing\n\nhow the deceased Mufasa can live again through his son. In both versions\n\nthe song is accompanied by gentle African chanting, which adds to the\n\nmystery and effectiveness of the number. Lebo M sings “He Lives in You”\n\non the soundtrack during the opening of the video sequel The Lion King\n\n2: Simba’s Pride (1998) and Michael Crawford made a notable record-\n\ning of it as part of a medley of songs from The Lion King. The song was\n\nincluded in the chorale recordings Rhythm of the Pridelands and Return\n\nto Pride Rock, and there were also recordings made by Tina Turner and\n\nElijah Kelley.\n\n“Things Are Not What They Appear” is the jolly song of sinister\n\nintrigue written by Marty Panzer and Larry Grossman for the made-for-\n\nvideo animated sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998).\n\nThe vengeful Ratcliffe (voice of David Ogden Stiers) and his henchmen\n\n(Craig Copeland, Phil Proctor, and Roger Freeland) plan to expose the\n\nrefined lady Pocahontas as a savage when she is presented in court to\n\nKing James, and they sing this dandy song about the dire consequences\n\nthat will follow.\n\n“This Is Halloween” is the pulsating holiday song written by Danny Elf-\n\nman for the stop-motion animation film The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\n(1993). In the opening number of the movie musical, the ghoulish resi-\n\ndents of Halloween Town celebrate another successfully ghastly October\n\n31 with this insistent minor-key song that rarely departs from a series of\n\nrepeated notes. In the video movie Mickey’s House of Villains (2001),\n\n200 “THIS IS ME”\n\nvarious Disney villains sing the number as they attack a movie theatre on\n\nHalloween.\n\n“This Is Me” is the gentle ballad about believing in oneself written by\n\nAdam Watts and Andy Dodd for the television movie Camp Rock (2008).\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato), who has confidence issues, is attending\n\na summer camp for teens who want to become rock stars, and this song\n\nreflects her reticence to let go and allow her talent to shine. The insight-\n\nful character song is later reprised in an upbeat pop version at the camp’s\n\n“Final Jam” night, where Mitchie is joined by instructor Shane Gray (Joe\n\nJonas).\n\n“This New Jerusalem” is the anthem of hope sung by the new king in the\n\nBroadway concert-pageant King David (1997), written by Alan Menken\n\n(music) and Tim Rice (lyric). As the young David (Marcus Lovett) ascends\n\nthe throne vacated by his mentor, Saul (Martin Vidnovic), he sings this\n\nnumber about making Jerusalem the city of God.\n\n“This Only Happens in the Movies” is the entrancing love song Alan\n\nMenken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyric) wrote in 1990 for the film pre-\n\nquel Who Discovered Roger Rabbit? but the movie was never made. The\n\nheartfelt number compares love in the movies with that in real life and finds\n\ntrue life love the deeper experience. Kerry Butler recorded the lovely song\n\nin 2008.\n\n“Thomas O’Malley Cat” is the jazzy “I am” song for the freewheeling\n\nalley cat O’Malley (voice of Phil Harris) in the animated movie The Aristo-\n\ncats (1970). Terry Gilkyson wrote the breezy number, in which O’Malley\n\nintroduces himself to the Parisian cat Duchess by singing about his free and\n\nhappy ways and how the whole world is his backyard.\n\n“Thomasina” is the folk ballad by Terry Gilkyson about the feline heroine\n\nof the live-action movie The Three Lives of Thomasina (1964). A studio\n\nchorus sings the calliope-like song, with a Scottish flavor in the words and\n\nmusic, about the self-reliant and wise cat during the opening credits while\n\nThomasina is seen stalking mice and birds.\n\n“The Three Caballeros” is the hyperactive title song for the 1944 movie\n\nmusical travelogue that uses animation and live action to explore the exotic\n\nside of Latin America. Manuel Esperón wrote the rapid Latin music and\n\n“THE TIKI TIKI TIKI ROOM” 201\n\nRay Gilbert adapted Ernesto Cortazar’s Spanish lyric, in which Donald\n\nDuck (voice of Clarence Nash) and his feathered friends Joe Carioca (José\n\nOliveira) and Panchito (Joaquin Garay) introduce themselves and profess\n\ntheir friendship. The animated sequence is filled with visual slapstick and\n\nfurious comic bits that hilariously illustrate the lyric. The song is also sung\n\nby a male chorus over the opening credits of the film and is reprised during\n\nthe climactic bullfight sequence at the end of the film. Bing Crosby re-\n\ncorded the song with the Andrews Sisters, and the number was performed\n\nby Jack Weston, F. Murray Abraham, and Paul B. Price in a gay bathhouse\n\nin the film The Ritz (1976). In 2007 the song and the characters from the\n\nfilm The Three Caballeros were added to the El Rio Del Tempo ride at the\n\nMexico pavilion at Disney World’s Epcot.\n\n“Through Your Eyes” is the reflective ballad by Richard Marx and Dean\n\nPitchford about one’s inability to understand another person without seeing\n\nthe world through the other’s eyes. The touching song is sung by Martina\n\nMcBride over the closing credits of the animated video sequel Bambi II\n\n(2006), which is about the difficult relationship between Bambi and his\n\nfather.\n\n“Tico-Tico (No Fubá)” is the contagious Latin number that arrived in the\n\nStates from Brazil in the early 1940s and found recognition when it was in-\n\nterpolated into the animated film Saludos Amigos (1942). Zequinha Abreu\n\ncomposed the festive music, Ervin Drake adapted Aloysio de Oliveira’s\n\nPortuguese lyric, and José Oliveira sings it on the soundtrack while Donald\n\nDuck and Joe Carioca visit the nightlife in Rio de Janeiro. The song is heard\n\nin a number of films from the 1940s, including Thousands Cheer (1943),\n\nwhere Maxine Barrett and Don Loper dance to it; Bathing Beauty (1944),\n\nwhere organist Ethel Smith plays it with Xavier Cugat’s Orchestra (the song\n\nwas long associated with him); as background in Kansas City Kitty (1944);\n\nand in Copacabana (1947), where Carmen Miranda sings it. Popular re-\n\ncordings were made by Smith, Miranda, Charles Wolcott and His Orches-\n\ntra, and the Andrews Sisters.\n\n“The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room” is the first original song written for Anima-\n\ntronic characters in a Disney theme park attraction. Richard M. and Robert\n\nB. Sherman wrote the pseudo-exotic number for the Enchanted Tiki Room\n\nattraction at Disneyland in 1963. Four mechanical parrots named Fritz,\n\nMichael, Pierre, and José sing the island ditty and are eventually joined\n\nby more than two hundred other birds, flowers, and tiki totem poles. The\n\n202 “THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE”\n\nattraction was reproduced at other Disney parks over the years. In 1998\n\nthe show was renamed “The Enchanted Tiki Room—Under New Manage-\n\nment” and, with Iago from Aladdin and Zazu from The Lion King as hosts,\n\nthe attraction used a revised version of the song “A Friend Like Me” from\n\nthe former movie. A fun quartet version of “The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room” was\n\nrecorded by Meredith Inglesby, Andy Karl, Tyler Maynard, and Keewa\n\nNurullah; Hilary Duff recorded it in 2002.\n\n“The Time of Your Life” is the bluesy number about living your life well\n\nand taking it easy, written by Randy Newman for the computer-animated\n\nmovie A Bug’s Life (1998). Newman sings the lazy and carefree number on\n\nthe soundtrack over the closing credits of the film.\n\n“Tip and Dash” is the merry sea chantey the comic duo Tip the Penguin\n\n(voice of Max Casella) and Dash the Walrus (Stephen Furst) sing in the\n\nmade-for-video animated sequel The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea\n\n(2000). Michael and Patty Silversher wrote the farcical number, and the\n\ntwo sidekicks sing it to Ariel’s daughter, Melody (Tara Charendoff), promis-\n\ning to battle the forces of evil under the sea and save the day.\n\n“’Tis Evening” is one of the satirical musical poems Charles Wolcott (mu-\n\nsic), T. Hee, and Erdman Penner (lyric) wrote for the animated film The\n\nReluctant Dragon (1941). When the doddering knight Sir Giles (voice of\n\nClaude Allister) and the peace-loving Dragon (Barnett Parker) face off for\n\nbattle, they instead recite their own poetry to each other. The frustrated\n\nBoy (Billy Lee) tries to get the fight going by talk-singing his own poem, an\n\node to the twilight, but soon it turns into a demand for bloodshed.\n\n“To an Upside Down Cake” is the unintentionally comic ode to dessert\n\nthat the poetry-writing Dragon (voice of Barnett Parker) sings about one\n\nof his favorite foods in the animated movie The Reluctant Dragon (1941).\n\nCharles Wolcott (music), T. Hee, and Erdman Penner (lyric) wrote the\n\nshort but catchy ditty that satirizes the classical ode form.\n\n“To Infinity and Beyond” is the musical mantra of the popular toy space-\n\nman Buzz Lightyear, as heard during the closing credits of the made-for-\n\nvideo prequel Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins\n\n(2000). After a spoken lead-in that is an homage to the opening credits of\n\nthe original Star Trek television series, William Shatner and the Star Com-\n\nmand Chorus sing the patriotic, Sousa-like march about one’s willingness\n\n“TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY” 203\n\nto go to infinity, if not further, in the cause of justice and goodness. Fred\n\nLaBour wrote the whimsical song, which echoes the satiric nature of the\n\ncharacter of Buzz.\n\n“To the Fairies They Draw Near” is the opening number for the\n\nanimated video Tinker Bell (2008), a prequel of sorts to Peter Pan (1953).\n\nLoreena McKennitt wrote the folk-like song, filled with the flavor of an old\n\nIrish ballad, and sings it on the soundtrack when the new fairy Tinker Bell is\n\nborn. The lyric explains how the fairies bring about spring, and the number\n\nis reprised at the end of the film when Tinker Bell and all the other fairies\n\ntravel to the mainland to deliver the seeds of spring.\n\n“Today Is Gonna Be a Great Day” is the rapid rock song written and\n\nperformed by the group Bowling for Soup in the opening sequence of the\n\nanimated television series Phineas and Ferb (2007). The vigorous, satiric\n\nnumber counts the days of summer vacation and lists the cockeyed ways the\n\nstepbrothers Phineas and Ferb plan to use them, from fighting a mummy to\n\nclimbing the Eiffel Tower to locating Frankenstein’s brain.\n\n“Together Time” is the merry waltz number that celebrates the mating\n\nseason in nature, as heard in the movie Perri (1957), about a squirrel and\n\na year of life in the forest. With the coming of spring, all the animals in\n\nthe wooded landscape seem to be pairing off, and a studio chorus sings\n\nthe cheerful number celebrating the end of winter and the time for two of\n\neverything. Paul J. Smith, Gil George, Ralph Wright, and Winston Hibler\n\ncollaborated on the song, which is reprised at the end of the movie when\n\nthe squirrel Perri is finally reunited with her mate.\n\n“Together We Can” is the lite-rock song about girl bonding that teenag-\n\ners Galleria (Raven-Symoné), Chanel (Adrienne Bailon), Aqua (Kiely Wil-\n\nliams), and Dorinda (Sabrina Bryan) sing in the television film The Cheetah\n\nGirls (2003). John Van Tongeren wrote the pop number, in which the four\n\ngirls boast that they can do anything, including saving the human race, if\n\nthey do it together. The song was made into a music video featuring the\n\nfour singers.\n\n“Tomorrow Is Another Day” is the expansive song of optimism Carol\n\nConnors and Ayn Robbins wrote for the animated movie The Rescuers\n\n(1977). As the mice Bernard and Bianca fly on Albatross Airlines from\n\nNew York City to the Devil’s Bayou in Louisiana, Shelby Flint sings the\n\n204 “TONKA”\n\npoetic ballad about sharing the joy of a rainbow with someone who means\n\nsomething special to you. Just like the image of two mice soaring into the\n\nsunset on the back of the albatross Orville, the song is also very uplifting\n\nand lyrical.\n\n“Tonka” is the western-flavored title song for the 1958 movie about a Sioux\n\nyouth (Sal Mineo) who tames a wild colt he names Tonka Wakan, meaning\n\n“The Great One.” A studio chorus sings the narrative ballad over the open-\n\ning credits, praising the proud and courageous horse who took part in the\n\nBattle of the Little Big Horn. The number, which has a Native American\n\ntribal flavor to it, was written by George Bruns (music) with a lyric by Gil\n\nGeorge (pseudonym for Hazel George, who was a studio nurse and a long-\n\ntime confidante of Walt Disney).\n\n“Too Cool” is the venomous character song sung by camp diva Tess Tyler\n\n(Meaghan Martin) in the made-for-television musical Camp Rock (2008).\n\nTess performs the pop music number, written by Toby Gad and Pam\n\nSheyne, at a camp bonfire, where she asserts her power and popularity\n\nwhile reminding her competition that she is too cool to be associating with\n\nthem.\n\n“Too Good to Be True” is the dreamy love song Buddy Kaye and Eliot\n\nDaniel wrote for the “Bongo” sequence in the animated anthology movie\n\nFun and Fancy Free (1947). The circus bear Bongo meets and falls in love\n\nwith the coquettish bear Lulu Belle in the forest, and in their imagination\n\nthey float and frolic together through the clouds. On the soundtrack, Dinah\n\nShore and a studio chorus sing the ballad about finding someone who is\n\nmore like a dream than reality. The number is reprised at the end of the\n\nstory when Bongo defeats the bully bear Lumpjaw and wins Lulu Belle’s\n\nlove.\n\n“A Toot and a Whistle and a Plunk and a Boom” is the swinging theme\n\nsong for the animated film short Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (1953),\n\nwhich explains the origins of the major ingredients to create music. Sonny\n\nBurke and Jack Elliott wrote the jazzy number, which is sung by a studio\n\nchorus on the soundtrack at the beginning and the end of the movie, cel-\n\nebrating the four ways to make noises that can be turned into music.\n\n“Topsy Turvy” is the festive song from the animated movie The Hunch-\n\nback of Notre Dame (1996) that turns ugly for the unfortunate Quasimodo.\n\n“TRANSFORMATION” 205\n\nAs the jester Clopin (voice of Paul Kandel) sings about Topsy Turvy Day, in\n\nwhich everything is backward and upside down, the Paris crowd sings and\n\ncelebrates the riotous holiday. When they hold a contest to see who has the\n\nugliest mask, the hunchback Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) is pushed onto the\n\nplatform and wins. But when the people realize it is not a mask and that\n\nQuasimodo is a deformed creature, they turn on him. Alan Menken com-\n\nposed the vigorous music and Stephen Schwartz wrote the ribald lyric.\n\n“The Torkelsons Theme Song” is the pleasing gospel number Ray Col-\n\ncord wrote for the 1991 television series about a single mother with five\n\nchildren. The flowing title song, sung by a choir over the opening credits,\n\nfinds comfort in the sun coming out and each day having the possibility of\n\nthings being all right. After the first season, the series was re-titled Almost\n\nHome, but it retained the same theme song.\n\n“Town Meeting” is the sinister and ironic patter song written by Danny\n\nElfman for the stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).\n\nThe Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (singing voice of Elfman) gathers the\n\ncitizens of Halloween Town and tries to explain to them the concept of\n\nChristmas. They do not comprehend the spirit of the holiday, thinking, for\n\ninstance, that a stocking ought to have a severed foot in it. The more Jack\n\ntries to illustrate the Christmas traditions, the more the villagers inflict their\n\nghoulish Halloween sensibilities on the holiday.\n\n“Toys” is the exuberant and insightful song that illustrates how children and\n\ntheir parents are often uncomfortably alike, written by Stephen Schwartz\n\nfor the live-action television musical Geppetto (2000). In the village toy\n\nshop of Geppetto (Drew Carey), obnoxious children and their equally\n\nobnoxious parents make demands and fight over purchases, while lonely,\n\nchildless Geppetto wonders why the wrong people have children. Later in\n\nthe musical, after Pinocchio has run away, Geppetto and the bungling Ma-\n\ngician (Wayne Brady) sing a quieter duet version of the song, reflecting on\n\nthe delicate nature of the relationship between parents and children.\n\n“Transformation” is the mystical, hymn-like song by Phil Collins that is\n\nused effectively in a pivotal moment in the animated movie Brother Bear\n\n(2003). After the Native American Kenai kills the bear who clawed his\n\nbrother to death, the Great Spirits turn Kenai into a bear so that he will\n\nsee nature with a new point of view. While images of different animals are\n\nconjured up before Kenai, the Bulgarian Women’s Choir sings the ritualistic\n\n206 “TRASHIN’ THE CAMP”\n\nsong on the soundtrack, the lyric promising to take one into a new world\n\nwhere all will be made clear. Songwriter Collins also recorded the enthrall-\n\ning number.\n\n“Trashin’ the Camp” is the scat-singing delight Phil Collins wrote for the\n\nanimated movie Tarzan (1999), and one of the musical and visual treats of\n\nthe film. Terk (voice of Rosie O’Donnell) and the other apes discover the\n\ncamp of the humans deep in the African jungle and joyfully destroy it as\n\nthey frolic and play with the strange objects they encounter. The rhythmic\n\nnumber cleverly begins with Terk hitting the keys on a typewriter, which\n\nsets the beat, and Collins is heard singing the nonsense scat song on the\n\nsoundtrack as the number builds and the camp is thoroughly trashed. In\n\nthe 2006 Broadway version of Tarzan, the number was performed by Terk\n\n(Chester Gregory II) and the apes. A recording of the number and a music\n\nvideo was made by the group ’N Sync.\n\n“Trick or Treating with Our Friends” is the happy-go-lucky Halloween\n\nsong written by Michael and Patty Silversher for the made-for-video film\n\nPooh’s Heffalump Halloween Movie (2005). As they anticipate Halloween,\n\nWinnie the Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings), Piglet (John Fiedler), Tigger\n\n(also Cummings), and Eeyore (Peter Cullen) sing this merry number about\n\ngetting candy and searching out Spookables. At the end of the movie, the\n\nkangaroos Kanga (Kath Soucie) and Roo (Jimmy Bennett) and the elephant\n\nLumpy (Kyle Stanger) join Pooh and his friends in reprising the song.\n\n“True Love Is an Apricot” is the farcical pastiche of an improvised beat-\n\nnik song, written by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the space film\n\nThe Moon Pilot (1962). When the American astronaut Captain Richmond\n\nTalbot (Tom Tryon) is asked to pick out the foreign spy who tried to con-\n\nspire with him, he must observe a lineup of women taken off the streets of\n\nSan Francisco to see if he recognizes the culprit. One of the suspects is a\n\nguitar-playing beatnik who strums and sings this risible number about the\n\nessence of love, made up on the spot and hilariously pretentious.\n\n“True Love’s Kiss” is the satiric love duet written by Alan Menken (mu-\n\nsic) and Stephen Schwartz (lyric) for the modern fairy tale film Enchanted\n\n(2007). In the animated section of the movie, the eager Giselle (voice of\n\nAmy Adams) sings the soaring song, about a special kiss that promises\n\nhappy endings, to her animal friends as they decorate a dummy to look like\n\na handsome prince. Later in the animated sequence, after Prince Edward\n\n“’TWAS BRILLIG” 207\n\n(James Marsden) rescues Giselle from a troll, the two sing the number to-\n\ngether as an ultra-romantic duet. After the two characters find themselves\n\nin realistic Manhattan, they each sing brief sections of the song, but it seems\n\nphony and funny in the real world.\n\n“True to Your Heart” is the pop-rock ballad Matthew Wilder (music) and\n\nDavid Zippel (lyric) wrote for the animated movie Mulan (1998). Stevie\n\nWonder and the group 98 Degrees sing the number over the end credits\n\nof the film, urging listeners to follow their feelings when they are confused,\n\nand they will come out all right. The singer Raven made a recording of\n\nthe rhythmic song at the time the movie was released, and in 2007 it was\n\nrecorded by Keke Palmer.\n\n“Trust in Me” is the alliterative lullaby Richard M. and Robert B. Sher-\n\nman wrote for the animated movie The Jungle Book (1967). Kaa the Python\n\n(voice of Sterling Holloway) sings the slithering song filled with “sssss”\n\nsounds as he tries to hypnotize the man-cub Mowgli.\n\n“Try Again” is the jazzy song of encouragement written by Dean Pitchford\n\nand Richard Gibb for the animated video sequel 101 Dalmatians II: Patch’s\n\nLondon Adventure (2003). While the dalmatian puppy Patch tries to prove\n\nhimself brave and strong to the canine movie star Thunderbolt, Will Young\n\nsings this jumping and jiving number on the soundtrack, urging one to not\n\ngive up. The song is reprised over the closing credits of the video.\n\n“The Turkey Song” is a short and incongruous song Michael and Patty\n\nSilversher wrote for the holiday video Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving\n\n(1999). When the bear Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings) and the fearful Piglet\n\n(John Fiedler) are sent into the woods to capture a turkey for Thanksgiving\n\ndinner, Pooh explains to Piglet how dangerous and unpredictable turkeys\n\ncan be in this amusing song, which has a sinister tone and a sense of fore-\n\nboding that frightens Piglet all the more.\n\n“’Twas Brillig” is a charming nonsense song based on a Lewis Carroll\n\npoem and used cleverly throughout the animated film Alice in Wonderland\n\n(1951). Gene de Paul (music) and Don Raye (lyric) adapted the opening\n\nlines of Carroll’s “Jabberwocky” into a short signature tune for the Cheshire\n\nCat (voice of Sterling Holloway) to sing every time he appears and disap-\n\npears in the film. While the melody is jaunty, the nonsensical lyric has an\n\neerie and mystifying air to it.\n\n208 “TWO SILHOUETTES”\n\n“Two Silhouettes” is the romantic love song by Charles Wolcott, Ray\n\nGilbert, and Al Sack that was set to a ballet in the animated anthology film\n\nMake Mine Music (1946). While Dinah Shore sings about two lovers, the\n\nsilhouettes of live-action dancers Tatiana Riabouchinska and David Lichine\n\nare seen in a pastoral setting, the two ballet performers seemingly defying\n\ngravity and dancing in the clouds.\n\n“2 Stars” is the musical cry of pain the camp diva Tess Tyler (Meaghan\n\nMartin) performs at the “Final Jam” in the made-for-television musical\n\nCamp Rock (2008). The daughter of a multi-Grammy-winning singer, Tyler\n\nhopes to get her mom’s attention when she sings this number, pouring out\n\nher hope that her mother will see them both as stars, rather than just be-\n\ning caught up in her professional career. Adam Anders and Nikki Hassman\n\nwrote the passionate melody and the cathartic lyric.\n\n“Two Worlds” is the pulsating song by Phil Collins that is used in the ani-\n\nmated film Tarzan (1999) to accentuate the conflicting worlds of humans\n\nand animals, insisting that each group has strong family bonds. Collins is\n\nheard singing the number at the beginning of the film while the baby Tar-\n\nzan is shipwrecked off the coast of Africa, his parents are killed by a leopard,\n\nand he is taken up by the gorilla Kala, who just lost her infant to the same\n\nbeast. The number is reprised at the end of the film when Tarzan, Jane,\n\nand her father, Professor Porter, bid farewell to the rescue ship and elect\n\nto remain in the jungle. Mandy Moore sings the song on the soundtrack for\n\nthe video sequel Tarzan and Jane (2002), and in the 2006 Broadway version\n\nof Tarzan, Josh Strickland sang the number offstage as the opening events\n\noccurred on stage. Collins’s recording of the rhythmic song enjoyed some\n\npopularity, and it was also recorded by Corbin Bleu.\n\nU\n\n“The Ugly Bug Ball” is the playful narrative ballad the town postmas-\n\nter Osh Popham (Burl Ives) sings to the young boy Peter Carey (Jimmy\n\nMathers) in the period film Summer Magic (1963). Richard M. and Robert\n\nB. Sherman wrote the gentle ragtime song about an ugly caterpillar who\n\nfinds romance at an annual ball for unsightly crawling and flying creatures.\n\nThe song is accompanied by nature footage of insects and other bugs that\n\nseem to keep time to the music. Michael Feinstein made a pleasing record-\n\ning of the song in 1992.\n\n“The Unbirthday Song” is the silly but contagious song Mack David, Al\n\nHoffman, and Jerry Livingston wrote for the animated movie Alice in Won-\n\nderland (1951). Alice (voice of Kathryn Beaumont) stumbles upon a bizarre\n\nand endless tea party where the Mad Hatter (Ed Wynn) and the March\n\nHare (Jerry Colonna) are celebrating their unbirthday. As the song merrily\n\nexplains, everyone has only one birthday, but there are 364 unbirthdays to\n\nenjoy. Rosemary Clooney recorded the number with the title song from the\n\nfilm, as did Michael Feinstein years later.\n\n“Undeniably Yours” is the smooth ballad pastiching a 1940s Frank Sinatra–\n\ntype number, written by Brock Walsh for the musical television series Hull\n\nHigh (1990). High school student Louis Plumb (Marty Belafsky), sporting a\n\n209\n\n210 “UNDER THE SEA”\n\ntux and fedora, sings the swinging love song with a big band, crooning about\n\na love that cannot be denied.\n\n“Under the Sea” is the Oscar-winning calypso number by Alan Menken\n\n(music) and Howard Ashman (lyric) that is the musical centerpiece of the\n\nanimated movie The Little Mermaid (1989). The crab Sebastian (voice of\n\nSamuel E. Wright) tries to explain to the mermaid princess Ariel (Jodi\n\nBenson) that life on land is terrible and that she will be much happier stay-\n\ning below the surface where she belongs. The number starts out as a clever\n\nlist song all about the advantages of life underwater, but soon it erupts into\n\na Ziegfeld Follies–like production number, with various forms of sea life\n\njoining in the singing and dancing. Ashman’s lyric is particularly artful in its\n\nuse of the many marine animal names in the rhyming. In the 2008 Broad-\n\nway version of The Little Mermaid, the number was led by Tituss Burgess\n\nas Sebastian. There have been several recordings of the song for children:\n\nJazz Networks made a notable disc in 1996, Earl Rose made a jazz version\n\nin 2000, the A Teens recorded it in 2002, Raven recorded it in 2005, and\n\nthere was also a playful recording by Andrew Samonsky with backup vocals\n\nby Meredith Inglesby, Andy Karl, Tyler Maynard, and Keewa Nurullah.\n\n“Up, Down, Touch the Ground” is the brief but fondly remembered\n\nexercise song Winnie the Pooh (voice of Sterling Holloway) optimistically\n\nsings as he does his morning calisthenics. Richard M. and Robert B. Sher-\n\nman wrote the rhythmic little ditty for Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\n\n(1966), the first Disney film short based on the A. A. Milne stories.\n\n“Upendi” is the infectious song about a topsy-turvy world written by\n\nRandy Petersen and Kevin Quinn for the video sequel The Lion King 2:\n\nSimba’s Pride (1998). The medicine man/baboon Rafiki (voice of Robert\n\nGuillaume) sings to the unlikely lion lovers Kiara and Kovu about a place\n\nwhere everything is upside down and the opposite of normal, but a perfect\n\nplace to fall in love. As Rafiki describes the place, a montage shows the land\n\nof Upendi, where hippos swing from trees and rhinos dance a conga line.\n\nV\n\n“Valentine Candy” is the reflective “I am” song tomboy Cordelia Drexel\n\nBiddle (Lesley Ann Warren, in her screen debut) sings in the period movie\n\nmusical The Happiest Millionaire (1967). The Philadelphia heiress Corde-\n\nlia, who likes to box for a hobby, looks at herself in her bedroom mirror and\n\ntries to find the woman between the society lady and the little girl with a\n\nsweet tooth. Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the touching and\n\ntruthful song.\n\n“Very Good Advice” is the somber, revealing song by Mack David, Al\n\nHoffman, and Jerry Livingston for the title character in the animated movie\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951). After all her adventures in Wonderland, Alice\n\n(voice of Kathryn Beaumont) thinks back on the lessons she has learned and\n\ncomes to the conclusion that she is better at giving herself advice than she\n\nis at following it. Doris Day and the Four Hits made a smooth recording of\n\nthe ballad, and years later it was recorded by Barbara Hendricks and the\n\nAbbey Road Ensemble.\n\n“The Virginia Company” is the rousing song of adventure by Alan Men-\n\nken (music) and Stephen Schwartz (lyric) that is sung by a male chorus on\n\nthe soundtrack of the animated film Pocahontas (1995). While the crew\n\nreadies their ship in London, Governor Ratcliffe (voice of David Ogden\n\nStiers) and Captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) come aboard, all preparing to\n\n211\n\n212 “THE VOID”\n\nsail to the New World and bring back chests of gold. The spirited number\n\nis a cross between an English drinking song and a sailors’ sea chantey.\n\n“The Void” is the incongruous number by Richard M. and Robert B.\n\nSherman that spoofs the “deep” songs of the beat generation, written for\n\nthe movie The Moon Pilot (1962). When the San Francisco police bring in\n\na bevy of women who hang out on the wharf at night, one of them is drunk\n\nand breaks into this pseudo-meaningful song about the emptiness of life.\n\nThe music sounds improvised, as does the lyric, creating a wicked pastiche\n\nof the beatnik songs of the era.\n\nW\n\n“Wait Till He Sees You” is the waltz-tempo song of anticipation writ-\n\nten by Larry Grossman and Marty Panzer for the animated video sequel\n\nPocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). The Englishwoman Mrs.\n\nJenkins (voice of Jean Stapleton) prepares Pocahontas to be presented to\n\nKing James by dressing her in European clothes and doing up her hair in\n\nan English style, singing this cheerful number about how Pocahontas will\n\ndazzle the court. The Englishman John Rolfe (Billy Zane) joins in on the\n\nnumber, teaching Pocahontas the dance steps she will need to know at the\n\nball.\n\n“Waiting for This Moment” is the stirring song of wonderment sung by\n\nJane Porter (Jenn Gambatese) in the 2006 Broadway version of Tarzan.\n\nPhil Collins wrote the number, in which Jane wanders through the jungle,\n\njotting down the Latin names for all the exotic plants she encounters and\n\nreveling in the beautiful, primitive world that already feels like home to her.\n\nShe is so taken with her joy that she does not notice she is being ensnared\n\nin the web of a giant spider, and Tarzan has to rescue her.\n\n“Walk Away” is the heartfelt song by Jamie Houston about making a dif-\n\nficult decision that separates one from a loved one, as sung by high school\n\nsenior Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) in the film sequel High\n\nSchool Musical 3: Senior Year (2008). Afraid that her boyfriend, Troy (Zac\n\n213\n\n214 “THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER”\n\nEfron), is not going to make the best decision about his future because of\n\nhis devotion to her, Gabriella realizes she must break off their relationship\n\nso that he will feel free to do what is best for him.\n\n“The Walrus and the Carpenter” is the clever musical rendition of the\n\nLewis Carroll poem that is one of the highlights of the animated film Alice\n\nin Wonderland (1951). The rotund twins Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee\n\ntell Alice the story of two con men—a puffed-up, blustering walrus and\n\nan off-kilter carpenter—who trick a group of oysters into becoming their\n\nmeal. Sammy Fain (music) and Bob Hilliard (lyric) adapted the poem into a\n\nmusical scene that is a tour de force for actor J. Pat O’Malley, who provides\n\nthe voices for not only the walrus and the carpenter, but for Tweedle-Dum\n\nand Tweedle-Dee as well. An amusing quartet recording of the number\n\nwas made by Meredith Inglesby, Andy Karl, Tyler Maynard, and Keewa\n\nNurullah.\n\n“Warm Spring Night” is the passionate song of love from the biblical\n\nconcert-pageant King David, which was presented on Broadway in 1997.\n\nDavid (Marcus Lovett) falls for the beautiful Bathsheba (Alice Ripley) and\n\nsings this song of lust, full of pastoral imagery, describing how his body\n\nresponds to his carnal feelings and his heated surroundings. Alan Menken\n\ncomposed the potent music and Tim Rice wrote the hot-blooded lyric.\n\n“Watch Your Footwork” is the peppy song about boxing techniques\n\nwritten by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman for the period musical The\n\nHappiest Millionaire (1967), the sparkling duet using a Dixieland jazz fla-\n\nvor in its music. The Biddle brothers, Tony (Paul Peterson) and Livingston\n\n(Eddie Hodges), warn their sister’s suitor, Charlie Taylor (Larry Merrill),\n\nabout her boxing prowess, singing that she has dynamite up her sleeve. In\n\nthe course of demonstrating some of her moves, the two brothers knock\n\nthe fellow out cold.\n\n“The Way It Must Be Done” is the rapid march song Randy Rogel\n\n(music and lyric) and Grant Geissman (lyric) wrote for the animated video\n\nWinnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo (2004). The over-organized Rabbit\n\n(voice of Ken Sansom) instructs his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood on\n\nthe correct procedure for coloring, drying, and hiding eggs for Easter with\n\nthis droll number, turning Easter preparations into an efficient and charm-\n\nless affair. Winnie the Pooh and the others ignore Rabbit’s rules and have\n\n“THE WEEKENDERS THEME” 215\n\nfun as they sloppily color the eggs and sing about the way they like to do\n\nthings, which upsets Rabbit very much.\n\n“We Are Here to Change the World” is the rhythmic rock number writ-\n\nten and performed by Michael Jackson in the 3-D film Captain EO (1986)\n\nat the Journey into Imagination attraction at Epcot. Captain EO (Jackson)\n\nand his ragtag crew of misfit creatures and robots perform the song about\n\nfinding a better world to the evil Supreme Leader (Anjelica Huston) in\n\nthe hopes of softening her cold, cruel heart. The number turns into an\n\nenergetic dance showcase for Jackson, who later recorded the song for a\n\ncompilation album. Denise Williams also recorded the song in 1988.\n\n“We Are One” is the song of parental encouragement written by Tom\n\nSnow (music), Marty Panzer, and Jack Feldman (lyric) for the video sequel\n\nThe Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride (1998). The lion king Simba (singing voice\n\nof Cam Clark) sings to his teenage daughter, Kiara, that no matter what\n\ndifferences arise between father and daughter, they will always love and\n\nsupport each other. During the song, a montage is shown of various animal\n\nparents spending time with their offspring.\n\n“We Go Together” is the happy hillbilly song by Marcus Hummon that is\n\nused effectively during the opening credits of the made-for-video animated\n\nsequel The Fox and the Hound 2 (2006). A pack of singing dogs (voiced by\n\nthe group Big Little Town) are singing at the Grand Ole Opry about how\n\nfriends will go anywhere as long as they are together. The singing is broad-\n\ncast over the radio and is heard in the house of the Widow Tweed, where\n\nthe young canine Copper and the fox Tod are playing together.\n\n“We Rock” is the jubilant character number performed by the cast of\n\nteenagers in the finale of the television musical Camp Rock (2008). Kara\n\nDioGuardi and Greg Wells wrote the vibrant jam session number, with\n\nfrenzied music and a poetic lyric about finding one’s voice and searching\n\nfor one’s dreams.\n\n“The Weekenders Theme” is the rhythm-and-blues number from the\n\nanimated television series The Weekenders (2000) about four teens who\n\nsearch out new adventures each weekend. Roger Neill wrote the carefree\n\nnumber, which is sung by a male soloist over the opening credits, showing\n\nthe four adolescents at amusement parks and other fun places.\n\n216 “WELCOME (TO OUR FAMILY)”\n\n“Welcome (to Our Family)” is the lively gospel-flavored song written by\n\nPhil Collins for the animated film Brother Bear (2003). When the Native\n\nAmerican Kenai is turned into a bear, he is welcomed to the bear colony\n\nwith this joyous song. Collins, the Blind Boys of Alabama, and Oren Waters\n\nsing it on the soundtrack as Kenai learns the ways of the bears, from hunt-\n\ning to playing. In 2004 the song was recorded by the group Jump 5.\n\n“Welcome Home” is the bright and bouncy opening number written by\n\nMelissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel for the animated video sequel\n\nLady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure (2001). In a small New Eng-\n\nland town, the citizens prepare for the Independence Day parade and pic-\n\nnic, commenting on all the fun things to do, while the canines Lady (voice\n\nof Jodi Benson) and Tramp (Jeff Bennett) join in on the song and list their\n\nown favorite pastimes.\n\n“Welcome to My Hole” is the sinister song of welcome written by Wil-\n\nliam Finn for the animated made-for-video The Adventures of Tom Thumb\n\nand Thumbelina (2002). The tiny princess Thumbelina (voice of Jennifer\n\nLove Hewitt) has fallen in love with the equally small Tom Thumb, but she\n\nis captured by the evil Mole King (Peter Gallagher), who plans to marry her\n\nand make Thumbelina his queen. He sings this creepy character song as he\n\nbrings her into his dark lair and offers her treasure, unwittingly revealing\n\nthat this underground monarch is crazy.\n\n“Welcome to the Day” is the magical and invigorating song written by\n\nMelissa Etheridge for the opening sequence in the animated video sequel\n\nBrother Bear 2 (2006). Etheridge sings the number on the soundtrack, de-\n\nscribing the bond between two brothers and asking the spirits to bless the\n\nday, while two bears, Kenai and his little brother, Koda, play together in a\n\nriver during early morning. The song is reprised in the final moments of the\n\nmovie when Kenai marries his beloved Nita, an old friend from his human\n\ndays who has made the transformation to become a bear so that they may\n\nbe together.\n\n“Welcome to the Forty Thieves” is the vigorous song that the band of\n\nthieves sing to Aladdin (voice of Brad Kane) after he has passed a test of\n\nbravery and strength in the video sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves\n\n(1995). David Friedman wrote the boisterous number in which the thieves\n\n(featuring the voices of Scott Barnes, Don Bradford, Merwin Foard, Guy\n\n“WE’RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER” 217\n\nStroman, Gordon Stanley, Paul Kandel, Peter Samuel, and songwriter\n\nFriedman) list the duties and perks of being part of their elite group of\n\noutlaws.\n\n“Welcome to the Kingdom” is the spectacular opening number written\n\nby Jay Blackton (music) and Joe Cook (lyric) for the 1979 Radio City Mu-\n\nsic Hall stage version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The citizens\n\nof the kingdom sing this introductory song, which tells the audience they\n\nare about to enter a magical world of fairy tales. The stage production was\n\ntaped and broadcast on pay TV in 1980 and on the Disney Channel in 1987\n\nas Snow White Live.\n\n“Welcome to Toontown” is the jumping rock song written for the open-\n\ning of Mickey’s Toontown attraction at Disney World in 1993. The happy\n\nnumber, about the joy of being in such a special place, has been used in pa-\n\nrades and shows in the colorful re-creation of a cartoon town where Mickey\n\nand his friends live. The Fab 5 recorded the number, and their version is\n\nused in the parks as well.\n\n“We’ll Smoke the Blighter Out” is a silly list song by Oliver Wallace (mu-\n\nsic), Ted Sears, and Winston Hibler (lyric) for the animated movie fantasy\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951). After Alice (voice of Kathryn Beaumont) has\n\neaten a piece of cake inside the house of the White Rabbit (Bill Thomp-\n\nson), she grows so large that everyone thinks she’s a monster. The Dodo\n\n(also voiced by Thompson) sings this merry number listing all the ways they\n\nmight try to get the monster out of the house.\n\n“We’re All in This Together” is the repetitive and catchy song of opti-\n\nmism that Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil wrote for the finale of the\n\ntelevision movie High School Musical (2006). Although the school’s jocks,\n\nnerds, skaters, drama geeks, and brainiacs have been at odds with each\n\nother over the past weeks, they all unite in singing this plucky, sentimental\n\nsong about celebrating the differences that make them strong. The num-\n\nber is led by basketball jock Troy Bolton (Zac Efron, with singing assist by\n\nAndrew Seeley), math whiz Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens),\n\ndrama queen Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), and her performing brother\n\nRyan (Lucas Grabeel), but soon all the Wildcats are singing and dancing to\n\nthe hopeful song. The number is reprised by the same characters during the\n\ngraduation scene in the film sequel High School Musical 3 (2008).\n\n218 “WE’RE AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD”\n\n“We’re at the Top of the World” is the Beach Boys–like lite-rock song writ-\n\nten by Juliana Theory for the made-for-television movie Motocrossed (2001).\n\nDuring film footage in which teen motorcycle riders Andrea Carson (Alana\n\nAustin) and Dean Talon (Riley Smith) speed over hills and dales, songwriter\n\nTheory sings this 1960s-sounding pop song on the soundtrack, complete with\n\n“sha-la-la-la” and a lyric about being the very best in your field.\n\n“We’re Huntin’ Eggs Today” is the zesty march song John Kavanaugh\n\nwrote for the made-for-video movie Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with\n\nRoo (2004). Tigger (voice of Jim Cummings) leads his friends through the\n\nHundred Acre Wood on Easter as they sing about the big hunt, listing the\n\ndifferent kinds of eggs they hope to find.\n\n“We’re in Harmony” is the melodic country-western number by Will\n\nRobinson that is used throughout the animated video sequel The Fox and\n\nthe Hound 2 (2006). A group of singing hounds list the many things that go\n\ntogether in harmony as they perform on the stage of a talent show. Later\n\nin the film, the harmonizing song is reprised by the canines Cash (singing\n\nvoice of Joshua Gracin), Dixie (Reba McEntire), Granny Rose (Vicki Law-\n\nrence), Copper (Harrison Fahn), and Floyd (Jim Cummings) as they howl\n\ntogether outside a diner. Chip Davis reprises the number during the end\n\ncredits of the video.\n\n“Weren’t So Bad What Used to Be” is the strumming blues number\n\nMason Daring wrote for the film Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken (1991).\n\nEula Lawrence sings the rhythmic blues song about feeling bad about the\n\npresent and wishing to go back to the past, heard over a montage showing\n\nscenes from the Great Depression. The number not only comments on the\n\nout-of-work characters in the movie but is also an accurate and evocative\n\npastiche of the music of the period.\n\n“West o’ the Wide Missouri” is a pulsating dance number in the movie\n\nmusical The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968) that is\n\nperformed on election night of 1888 in a Dakota town anticipating state-\n\nhood. Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the square dance song\n\nabout the land of opportunity west of the Missouri River, and it is sung\n\nand danced to by both Democrats and Republicans awaiting the election\n\nresults. Featured in the production number are John Davidson, Lesley Ann\n\nWarren, Buddy Ebsen, Janet Blair, Goldie Hawn, and Steve Harmon.\n\n“WHAT CAN YOU LOSE?” 219\n\n“Westward Ho the Wagons!” is the vigorous title song for the 1956\n\nmovie about pioneers traveling the Oregon Trail. George Bruns (music)\n\nand Tom W. Blackburn (lyric) wrote the western number about going west,\n\nwhere new land is always best. A male chorus sings the spirited song on the\n\nsoundtrack at the beginning of the film during a montage of a wagon train\n\nslowly moving across the prairie.\n\n“A Whale of a Tale” is the silly sea chantey that whaler Ned Land (Kirk\n\nDouglas) sings in the adventure film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).\n\nAl Hoffman (music) and Norman Gimbel (lyrics) wrote the ribald number\n\nin which Ned plays the guitar and sings tall tales about all the women he\n\nhas enjoyed while living the life of a seaman, swearing on his tattoo that\n\nthey are all true.\n\n“What a Blustery Day” is the innocent list song Winnie the Pooh (voice\n\nof Sterling Holloway) sings as he observes the effects of the wind on the\n\nHundred Acre Wood in the Oscar-winning movie short Winnie the Pooh\n\nand the Blustery Day (1968). Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote\n\nthe lighthearted song about the natural elements, which Pooh sings as he\n\nbraves the storm to wish his friends a “Happy Winds-day.”\n\n“What a Day in London” is the complex musical number that introduces\n\nEngland to the newly arrived Pocahontas in the made-for-video animated\n\nsequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). As the citizens of\n\nLondon awake and begin a new day, they sing about their everyday tasks\n\nand expectations. People from all different levels of society, from beggars\n\nto nobles, are presented in the musical number. Pocahontas (singing voice\n\nof Judy Kuhn) takes part in the song, wondering at the marvels of the big\n\ncity and its strange buildings, various kinds of foods, and diverse types of\n\npeople. Marty Panzer and Larry Grossman wrote the multilevel number,\n\nwhich has an English Renaissance flavor in its music.\n\n“What Can You Lose?” is the beguiling torch song of sorts written by\n\nStephen Sondheim for the cartoonish live-action movie Dick Tracy (1990).\n\nNightclub pianist Eighty-Eight Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and saloon singer\n\nBreathless Mahoney (Madonna) briefly sing the ambivalent love song at\n\na rehearsal in the club. The lyric argues that one can never tell the truth\n\nabout love, but with so much you can win, it’s worth the risk. The intriguing\n\nnumber was edited down to just snippets in the movie, but Guy Haines (aka\n\n220 “WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF”\n\nBruce Kimmel) and Madonna each recorded the full song, and years later\n\nJudy Kuhn made a memorable recording.\n\n“What Dreams Are Made Of” is the rhythmic pop love song that was\n\nheard twice in The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003), in which the television\n\ncharacter Lizzie (Hilary Duff) has romantic adventures in Italy. Matthew\n\nWilder (music) and Dean Pitchford (lyric) wrote the romantic number\n\nabout finding that special person and the feeling that creates a million\n\ndreams. When Lizzie is mistaken for the pop star Isabella, she meets and\n\nfalls in love with Isabella’s boyfriend, Paolo (Yani Gellman), and the two\n\nsing the number on a bare concert stage. The song is reprised later in the\n\nfilm by Lizzie and Isabella (also Duff) as a duet before a packed house of\n\nfans.\n\n“What Is a Baby?” is the brief but potent song from the animated movie\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955) that takes the canine point of view about a new\n\narrival in the house. Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee wrote the number, which\n\nis a series of questions going through Lady’s mind as she watches people\n\nfuss over something in the bedroom and she hears the cries of something\n\nnew and unusual. Lee provided the singing voice for Lady’s thoughts, won-\n\ndering what could be so special that everyone behaves so oddly.\n\n“What It Takes” is the lively hip-hop number performed by teenage\n\ncamper Lola (Aaryn Doyle) at the open-mike night in the made-for-\n\ntelevision musical Camp Rock (2008). Tim James and Antonina Armato\n\nwrote the frenetic melody and the sassy lyric about respect being the key\n\nthing a girl is looking for from a man.\n\n“What I’ve Been Looking For” is the pop love song by Andy Dodd and\n\nAdam Watts that is given two very different renditions in the television\n\nmovie High School Musical (2006). Drama queen Sharpay Evans (Ashley\n\nTisdale) and her brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), who always get the lead-\n\ning roles in the school’s “Spring Musicale,” perform the heartfelt ballad at\n\nauditions with a slick showbiz approach, singing and dancing at a fast tempo\n\nand showing off their artificial talents. After auditions, the number is given\n\na softer, slower, and more meaningful rendition by teens Troy Bolton (Zac\n\nEfron, with singing assist by Andrew Seeley) and Gabriella Montez (Van-\n\nessa Anne Hudgens), who are falling in love with each other.\n\n“WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT?” 221\n\n“What Makes the Red Man Red?” is the politically incorrect song that\n\nSammy Fain (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyric) wrote for the animated\n\nfantasy film Peter Pan (1953). When the Indians in Never Land celebrate\n\nPeter’s rescue of Tiger Lily, they sing this pounding number, answering\n\nquestions such as why they say “ugh” and “how” and why they are so red.\n\nThe answers are silly (the redness comes from blushing over pretty Indian\n\nmaidens) and the tribal dance that follows is stylized nonsense. Although\n\nthe intention is escapist fun, the number proves offensive to some audi-\n\nences today. A recording of the rhythmic number was made by David An-\n\nderson, Anne Lloyd, Mitch Miller, Dan Ocko, and the Sandpipers.\n\n“What Time Is It?” is the hip-hop opening number written by Matthew\n\nGerrard and Robbie Nevil for the television movie sequel High School Mu-\n\nsical 2 (2007). On the last day of high school classes, the students anxiously\n\nwatch the clock, waiting for the bell to ring as they sing about their anticipa-\n\ntion of summer. Once the bell does ring, the teenagers dash into the halls\n\nand break into a vivacious celebratory production number that includes\n\nvarious kinds of contemporary dance.\n\n“What’s This?” is the fast and excited song of discovery Danny Elfman\n\nwrote for the stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).\n\nThe discontented Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (singing voice of Elfman)\n\nlands in Christmas Town and eagerly asks himself the meaning of all the\n\nsnow, colored lights, making of toys, and warmth of human spirit. The song\n\nis reprised toward the end of the film when Santa Claus brings Christmas\n\nto Halloween Town and the citizens rejoice in their first experience with\n\nfalling snow.\n\n“What’s Wrong with That?” is the conversational number by Richard\n\nM. and Robert B. Sherman that is used throughout the movie The Hap-\n\npiest Millionaire (1967) whenever the eccentric millionaire Anthony J.\n\nDrexel Biddle (Fred MacMurray) questions the circumstances around\n\nhim. He first sings it after his finger has been bitten by his pet alligator\n\nand he complains that there is no one at home to give him sympathy. His\n\ndaughter Cordelia (Lesley Ann Warren) reprises it with him, taking pity on\n\nhim. Later Biddle sings it at a party when he questions whether America\n\nis prepared to fight if the nation gets involved in World War I. A group of\n\nMarines joins him in the song. Finally, Biddle sings a quieter version of the\n\n222 “WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY”\n\nnumber to the engaged Cordelia as they ride in a taxi and he questions why\n\na father must lose his daughter to marriage. The song has a vigorous talk-\n\nsing quality to it, a style the Shermans thought would suit Rex Harrison,\n\nwhom they wanted to play the role.\n\n“When I See an Elephant Fly” is the jaunty comic song by Oliver Wal-\n\nlace (music) and Ned Washington (lyric) that Jim Crow (voice of Cliff\n\nEdwards) and the other crows (Hall Johnson Choir) sing in the animated\n\nmovie Dumbo (1941) about the impossibility of the baby elephant Dumbo\n\nflying up into the tree where he has been found. The song is reprised by\n\nthe chorus on the soundtrack at the end of the film when Dumbo becomes\n\nthe star of the circus and rides off into the sunset with his mother. The jazzy\n\nnumber is filled with puns in the lyric and is musically very ambitious. The\n\nwhole sequence was deemed offensive to African Americans in the 1960s\n\n(the crow’s name is the only overtly derogatory aspect of the scene), so the\n\nmovie was not shown very often. Later, more enlightened audiences found\n\nit to be the most musically vibrant part of Dumbo. Jane Froman made a\n\npopular recording of the clever number in the 1940s, and decades later\n\nBarbara Cook made a memorable version harmonizing with herself on\n\nthree tracks. There was also a recording by the group Plain White T’s in\n\n2008. The original recording of the song from the film soundtrack is heard\n\nin the movie Operation Dumbo Drop (1995).\n\n“When I’m Near You” is the slow-dance number heard in the film com-\n\nedy Superdad (1973). Shane Tatum wrote the quiet, romantic love song,\n\nand teen couples dance to it at a birthday party, the number heard on the\n\nstereo in the home of the McCready family in Los Angeles.\n\n“When I’m with You” is the old-time vaudeville number written by Mi-\n\nchael Giacchino, Jeannie Lurie, Steve L. Hayes, and Adam Cohen for the\n\ntelevision movie The Muppets’ Wizard of Oz (2005). Dorothy (Ashanti)\n\nsings the soft-shoe number about the importance of friends with the Scare-\n\ncrow, played by Kermit the Frog (voice of Steve Whitmire); Tin Man,\n\nplayed by Gonzo (Dave Goelz); Lion, played by Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacob-\n\nson); and Toto, played by Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta).\n\n“When in Love” is the contemplative song of love that Alan Menken\n\n(music) and Tim Rice (lyric) wrote for the Broadway concert-pageant King\n\nDavid (1997). When the beauteous Bathsheba (Alice Ripley) sets eyes on\n\n“WHEN THE LOVE BUG BITES” 223\n\nDavid (Marcus Lovett) and is smitten, she reflects upon her willingness to\n\ndo anything for him because of her deep love.\n\n“When Love Is Gone” is the heartfelt torch song Paul Williams wrote for\n\nthe film The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). The pretty Englishwoman\n\nBelle (Meredith Braun) sings to the young man Ebenezer Scrooge (Ray-\n\nmond Coulthard) about how his love of money has replaced his love for her\n\nand she bids him farewell. At the end of the movie, the old and reformed\n\nScrooge (Michael Caine) sings the number as “When Love Is Found” as he\n\ncelebrates Christmas with the Cratchit family. Martina McBride sings the\n\nsong over the closing credits of the film, and her recording received some\n\nairplay.\n\n“When She Loved Me” is the heart-tugging torch song not about lovers\n\nparting, but about the loss of a friend, used so effectively in the computer-\n\nanimated movie sequel Toy Story 2 (1999). In a flashback, the cowgirl doll\n\nJessie (voice of Joan Cusack) recalls when she was the favorite toy of the\n\nlittle girl Emily. But as Emily grew up and her interests changed, she ne-\n\nglected Jessie and eventually left her as a donation to charity. Randy New-\n\nman wrote the simple but moving ballad, which is sung on the soundtrack\n\nby Sarah McLachlan during the potent sequence. Out of context, the song\n\ncould be performed as a love song, as with heartfelt recordings by Brian\n\nSutherland, Steve Tyrell, Michael Crawford, Kerry Butler, and Jordan\n\nPruitt.\n\n“When the Buzzards Return to Hinckley Ridge” is the mock opera\n\naria Mel Leven wrote for the sly animated documentary short It’s Tough\n\nto Be a Bird (1969) about the history of birds before and after the arrival\n\nof man. During live-action film footage of the annual buzzard festival in\n\nHinckley, Ohio, Ruth Buzzi’s earsplitting soprano voice is heard on the\n\nsoundtrack singing this tribute to all the buzzards that descend on the town\n\neach spring.\n\n“When the Love Bug Bites” is the menacing yet comic song about the\n\neffects of love written by Michael and Patty Silversher for the animated\n\ntelevision special Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You (1999). Winnie the\n\nPooh (voice of Jim Cummings) learns that his friend Christopher Robin is\n\n“smitten” by love, and his friends Rabbit (Ken Sansom) and Tigger (Paul\n\nWinchell) sing about the medical symptoms of love, none of them pleasant.\n\n224 “WHEN THERE WAS ME AND YOU”\n\nThe clever song is both ominous and playful as their imaginations run away\n\nwith them.\n\n“When There Was Me and You” is the teenage torch song Jamie Hous-\n\nton wrote for the television movie High School Musical (2006). When “brai-\n\nniac” Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) overhears her boyfriend,\n\nTroy Bolton (Zac Efron), tell his basketball teammates that auditioning\n\nfor the school musical is not important to him, she questions if she herself\n\nmeans anything to Troy. She longs for the time when it was just the two of\n\nthem, before their friends got involved and influenced their relationship.\n\n“When You Wish Upon a Star” is one of the most beloved of all movie\n\nsongs, a dreamy and optimistic number by Leigh Harline (music) and Ned\n\nWashington (lyric) that has become the theme song for Walt Disney’s en-\n\ntertainment empire. The plaintive ballad, about wishes coming true if you\n\nfirmly believe in yourself, is first heard (minus the heartfelt verse and re-\n\nlease) at the beginning of the movie Pinocchio (1940), where Jiminy Cricket\n\n(voice of Cliff Edwards) sings it as the camera moves into Geppetto’s house\n\nand the story begins. Although the music does not have a wide range, it has\n\nan expansive feeling as the notes at times seem to reach up to the stars. The\n\nballad immediately became a favorite, won the Oscar for Best Song, and\n\nwas forever after associated with Disney, being used for everything from\n\nthe theme song for his weekly television show to ads plugging the various\n\ntheme parks. Over the years the song has often been recorded by various\n\nand diverse artists, including popular discs by Glenn Miller, Kate Smith,\n\nRingo Starr, Johnny Mathis, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Barbara Hen-\n\ndricks and the Abbey Road Ensemble, Jack Teagarden, Dick Haymes with\n\nthe Harry James Orchestra, Louis Armstrong, Linda Ronstadt, Billy Joel,\n\nthe Drummonds, Mary Martin, the Ken Peplowski Quartet, Jazz Networks,\n\nBarbara Streisand, Michael Crawford, ’N Sync, Jimmy Scott, Michael Fein-\n\nstein, Susan Egan, Steve Tyrell, and Barbara Cook. A violin rendition of the\n\nballad was used in the live-action television musical Geppetto (2000), and\n\nthe Cliff Edwards recording was used in a dream spoof at the beginning of\n\nthe animated film Teacher’s Pet (2004).\n\n“Where Do I Go from Here?” is the musical query sung by Pocahontas\n\n(singing voice of Judy Kuhn) in the animated video sequel Pocahontas II:\n\nJourney to a New World (1998). As winter arrives in her homeland and the\n\nanimals prepare for the change in season, Pocahontas wonders what she\n\n“WHISTLE-STOP” 225\n\nshould do with her life, being discontented and ready for change herself.\n\nThe pop ballad was written by Marty Panzer and Larry Grossman.\n\n“Where Is Your Heart At?” is the slightly swinging pastiche song by Ru-\n\nfus Wainwright that echoes the sound of the Rat Pack singers, in particular\n\nFrank Sinatra. In the animated movie Meet the Robinsons (2007), the or-\n\nphan Lewis looks into the future and sees his future wife, Franny (voice of\n\nNicole Sullivan), conducting a big band ensemble of frogs. The lead singer\n\nis Frankie (Jamie Cullum), who croons the old-style ballad about finding\n\nhappiness by doing what you feel deep in your heart.\n\n“Where the Dream Takes You” is the pop ballad Diane Warren and\n\nJames Newton Howard wrote for the animated adventure film Atlantis: The\n\nLost Empire (2001). The lite-rock number about following your heart to find\n\nyour true self is sung by pop singer Mya over the final credits of the movie.\n\n“Wherever the Trail May Lead” is the pleasing country-western song\n\nabout friendship written by Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyric)\n\nfor the animated movie Home on the Range (2004). During the end credits\n\nfor the film, Tim McGraw sings the warm and optimistic ballad, promising\n\nto stick with a friend no matter what.\n\n“Wherever You Are” is the entrancing lullaby-like song by Michael Ab-\n\nbott and Sarah Weeks that Winnie the Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings) sings\n\nabout his lost friend Christopher Robin in the made-for-video film Pooh’s\n\nGrand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin (1997). Believing that\n\nChristopher Robin has been imprisoned inside a skull (when he has really\n\njust gone to school), Pooh and his friends set off on an expedition to res-\n\ncue him, but meet with a series of failures. One night Winnie sings to the\n\nstars, wishing to be reunited with Christopher Robin and wondering if he\n\nis wishing the same thing. As the weary Pooh finishes the tender song, he\n\nfalls asleep and Rabbit covers him with a blanket. Barry Coffing and Vondra\n\nShepard reprise the lovely number during the end credits of the video.\n\n“Whistle-Stop” is the contagious calliope-like number written by Roger\n\nMiller for the animated movie Robin Hood (1973). The bouncy music,\n\nplayed during the opening credits of the film, has no lyric but is accom-\n\npanied by whistling and Miller’s vocal imitation of medieval instruments,\n\ncreating a period and yet contemporary sound.\n\n226 “WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK”\n\n“Whistle While You Work” is the catchy and memorable ditty by Frank\n\nChurchill (music) and Larry Morey (lyric) that Snow White (voice of Adri-\n\nana Caselotti) sings and whistles as she and her animal friends clean up\n\nthe cottage of the dwarfs in the animated film Snow White and the Seven\n\nDwarfs (1937). The simple tune is one of the most recognizable in Ameri-\n\ncan pop culture, mainly heard on children’s records. Artie Shaw (vocal by\n\nLeo Watson) and Louis Armstrong each made a notable recording of the\n\nsong, and it was later recorded by Mary Martin and Barbara Hendricks with\n\nthe Abbey Road Ensemble. The number is spoofed in the modern fairy tale\n\nmovie Enchanted (2007) with the “Happy Working Song.”\n\n“Who Am I?” is the upbeat, questioning pop ballad for the young boy\n\nTarzan in the animated made-for-video sequel Tarzan II (2005). Phil Col-\n\nlins wrote and sings the number on the soundtrack as Tarzan tries to fit in\n\nwith different animal groups, meeting with comically disastrous results each\n\ntime. Tiffany Evans sings the number over the end credits of the movie, and\n\nshe also made a music video of it.\n\n“Who Better Than Me” is the rocking song of friendship written by Phil\n\nCollins for the 2006 Broadway version of Tarzan. The livewire teenage ape\n\nTerk (Chester Gregory II) sings the bouncy number to the younger Tar-\n\nzan (Daniel Manche or Alex Rutherford) as Terk swings and frolics in the\n\ntrees, proudly explaining that there is no one more qualified to teach the\n\nlittle human how to survive in the jungle. Terk and the adult Tarzan (Josh\n\nStrickland) reprise the number later in the show when they agree to help\n\neach other thwart the evil hunter Clayton.\n\n“Who Killed Cock Robin?” is the mock-operatic title song from the 1935\n\nSilly Symphony film short. Frank Churchill wrote the soaring music and\n\nadapted a new lyric from an old English folk song about a robin cruelly\n\nmurdered. The creepy yet silly ballad is sung by a studio chorus over the\n\nopening credits of the movie and is reprised at the trial where the burning\n\nquestion is sung by the judge (voice of Billy Bletcher).\n\n“Who Wants to Live Like That?” is the lighthearted song of philosophy\n\nwritten by Foster Carling and Ken Darby for the partially animated live-\n\naction movie Song of the South (1946). Uncle Remus (James Baskett) sings the\n\nsunny number about how worrying does one no good and that it is best to be\n\nlike Old Brer Possom and play dead when trouble comes. The song takes the\n\nform of an Uncle Remus tale, complete with rustic humor and a sly moral.\n\n“WHO’S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD WOLF?” 227\n\n“Who Will I Be” is the sunny character song performed by teenager Mitchie\n\nTorres (Demi Lovato) over the opening credits of the made-for-television\n\nmusical Camp Rock (2008). As she gets ready for school, Mitchie tries on\n\nseveral outfits and hairdos she thinks might fit her personality for the day. The\n\nbubblegum pop number was written by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil.\n\n“Whoever You Are” is the tuneful saloon song Arabella Flagg (Suzanne\n\nPleshette) sings as she welcomes patrons to the Lucky Nugget Saloon dur-\n\ning the Gold Rush days in the film The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin\n\n(1967). Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the rousing number,\n\nwhich invites people of all walks of life from all over the globe to come in\n\nand enjoy the entertainment.\n\n“A Whole Bunch of World” is the satirical song about the fifty states\n\nwritten by Cheri Steinkellner, Kevin Quinn, and Randy Petersen for the\n\nanimated movie Teacher’s Pet (2004). While the boy Leonard, his mother,\n\nand his dog, Spot, drive to Florida in an RV, a soundtrack chorus sings this\n\nrapid, country-flavored number about the many wonders of America. As\n\nevery state is mentioned in the song, a series of silly clichés about America\n\nis illustrated with fast and furious panache.\n\n“A Whole New World” is the expansive Oscar-winning song by Alan Men-\n\nken (music) and Tim Rice (lyric) that celebrates the exhilarating feeling of\n\nfreedom and blossoming love. In the animated film Aladdin (1992), Princess\n\nJasmine (singing voice of Lea Salonga) escapes the confines of the palace\n\nand sees the world with Aladdin (Brad Kane), the two of them singing the\n\nmelodic ballad as they travel across the globe on a flying carpet. Peabo Bryson\n\nand Regina Belle recorded a duet version of the song that was sung over\n\nthe film’s final credits and was very popular. Andrew Samonsky and Kaitlin\n\nHopkins also recorded the ballad as a duet, Earl Rose made a distinctive jazz\n\nrecording of the song in 2000, and Jessica Simpson recorded it in 2005.\n\n“The Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce” is the funny and frantic song about\n\nTigger’s most complex and spectacular bounce in the animated film The\n\nTigger Movie (2000). Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman wrote the vigor-\n\nous number, which Tigger (voice of Jim Cummings) sings to the young Roo,\n\ndemonstrating how the wild bounce is achieved.\n\n“Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?”—perhaps the most famous song to\n\ncome from a Disney film short—is the seemingly innocent children’s song\n\n228 “WHY NOT?”\n\nthat became internationally known and took on deeper significance during\n\nhard times in the Great Depression. Frank Churchill and Ann Ronell col-\n\nlaborated on the simple but tuneful song, sung by the three pigs as they\n\ncelebrate their victory over the wolf. It was written for the film short The\n\nThree Little Pigs (1933), and soon everyone was singing it or whistling it\n\non the street. Americans in the 1930s saw the Depression as the “big bad\n\nwolf” and the song was a form of defiance against the difficulties of the day.\n\nThe number was used in at least three subsequent Little Pigs cartoons,\n\nincluding the Silly Symphony shorts The Big Bad Wolf (1934), Three Little\n\nWolves (1936) and The Practical Pig (1939). The song was translated into\n\nseveral foreign languages, becoming popular around the world for the same\n\nreasons it caught on in the United States. In Russia it was so successful\n\nthat it was turned into a popular children’s book that claimed the tune was\n\nbased on an old Russian folk song. Early successful recordings of the ditty\n\nwere made by Ethel Shutta, Ben Bernie, and Harry Reser, with later discs\n\nby such varied artists as Wendy and the Wombats, Barbra Streisand, Jean\n\nSablon (in French), Burl Ives, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the group\n\nB5, Massimo Farao, and LL Cool J. It can also be heard in the movies\n\nBabes in Toyland (1934), Bottoms Up (1934), and Ship Cafe (1935). The\n\nsong inspired the punning title for Edward Albee’s play Who’s Afraid of\n\nVirginia Woolf? (1962).\n\n“Why Not?” is the up-tempo pop song about taking chances written by\n\nCharlie Midnight and Matthew Gerrard for The Lizzie McGuire Movie\n\n(2003), based on the popular television series. Lizzie (Hilary Duff) sings\n\nthe fervent number about opening your eyes and looking for new aspects\n\nof life. Duff’s recording of the song was popular and she also made a music\n\nvideo of it.\n\n“Why Should I Worry?” is the driving “I am” song by Dan Hartman and\n\nCharlie Midnight for the streetwise canine Dodger (voice of Billy Joel)\n\nin the animated movie version of Oliver Twist, titled Oliver & Company\n\n(1988). The confident dog sings the pulsating rock song to the young fe-\n\nline Oliver as he shows him how to survive in New York City using street\n\nsavvy.\n\n“W-I-L-D” is the jumping doo-wop number written by Lorraine Feather\n\nand Paul Grabowsky for the animated video sequel The Jungle Book 2\n\n(2003). Baloo the Bear (voice of John Goodman) entertains the man-cub\n\nMowgli and a gathering of jungle creatures with this jiving number about\n\n“WINNIE THE POOH” 229\n\nthe animal-like beat inside of all of us that gives us music. Soon all the\n\nanimals join in the song and dance, spelling out the world “wild” in the\n\nlyric and also spelling out the letters with their bodies like cheerleaders at\n\na football game.\n\n“Will I Ever See Her Again?” is the questioning ballad Jay Blackton\n\n(music) and Joe Cook (lyric) wrote for the 1979 Radio City Music Hall\n\nstage version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order to develop the\n\ncharacter of Prince Charming (Richard Bowne). Failing to find the myste-\n\nrious girl he met at the wishing well and fell in love with, the prince sings\n\nthis flowing song of wonder and regret. The stage production was taped and\n\nbroadcast on pay TV in 1980 and on the Disney Channel in 1987 as Snow\n\nWhite Live.\n\n“Will the Sun Ever Shine Again?” is the woeful lament about hard times\n\nwritten by Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyric) for the animated\n\nmovie Home on the Range (2004). Faced with bankruptcy and worried that\n\nshe will lose her farm, the steadfast Pearl puts her animals to bed in the\n\nbarn, perhaps for the last time, while Bonnie Raitt sings the gentle folk song\n\non the soundtrack. The number manages to be melodic and pleasing even\n\nas it is filled with sorrow and worry. Kaitlin Hopkins made a recording of\n\nthe song in 2005.\n\n“Windsong” is the enthralling African song written"
