Like join a rock band?\n\nRock Camp is an opportunity for students in middle and high school to learn how to play and sing their favorite songs and then play those songs live on stage! While at camp, students will be put into bands with peers of the same musical proficiency and will receive instruction and guidance from their band leader and from instrumental and vocal instructors. There will be breakout sessions for sectional rehearsals and private instruction. At the end of the week, the bands will hold a concert for their parents and friends.\n\nCLICK HERE TO REGISTER\n\nWhen making payment, please add \"Rock Camp\" and add your child's name in the memo line. You can also pay by check in the Church Office.\n\nAt the end of the Registration please ensure you click the link to upload a short video of you performing. This video is not an audition; it simply helps us decide with which group/instructors to place you. After you complete registration, you will receive a confirmation email. It also contains a link to upload your video.\n\nA note from Director of Music Clint Whitlow\n\nROCK CAMP 2024 is on the horizon!\n\nROCK CAMP at Westminster is such an exciting event, and we are so fortunate to be able to provide this opportunity through our Excellence in Music Endowment Fund. Many of you have seen firsthand the incredible talent in our own youth band and the parents can attest to how being a part of this small group bonds these young people together in ways that would otherwise be impossible. Being part of a band creates a sense of community; a small group that is empowered by the same collective goal to accomplish something phenomenal together. At our previous Rock Camps, it was so inspiring to see the sense of pride and accomplishment each performer displayed during the final concert at the end of the week.\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering to help with ROCK CAMP, please contact me at clint.whitlow@westpreschurch.org . Please feel free to call me with any questions you may have.\n\nThanks,\n\nClint Whitlow\n\nDirector of Music\n\nWestminster Presbyterian Church"
