Production

This was Crazylegs Crane's first series dedicated solely to him. Previously, he had made regular appearances in the three DePatie-Freleng animated comedies, Tijuana Toads, The Blue Racer and The Dogfather. Larry D. Mann voiced him in all but two of his appearances, with Bob Holt voicing him in the Tijuana Toads short "Flight to the Finish," and Daws Butler voicing him in the Dogfather short "The Goose That Laid a Golden Egg." His personality is similar to the Disney character Goofy. In the German series, this character was known as "Dummvogel", literally "silly bird".

Plot

In the cartoons that star Crazylegs Crane (voiced by Larry D. Mann), he always goes through various misadventures often accompanied by his son Crazylegs Crane Jr. (voiced by Frank Welker) and often deals with his frenemy a fire-breathing dragonfly (voiced by Frank Welker impersonating Andy Kaufman).
