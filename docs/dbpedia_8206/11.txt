Robert Holt (28 December, 1928 â€” 2 August, 1985) was an American actor best known for his voice work. His first film role came in 1950, acting as Octavius Caesar in "Julius Caesar". His career as a voice artist started with the 1968 short film "Johnny Learns His Manners", for which he provided all of the voices. He since has appeared in such works as "Bedknobs and Broomsticks", the animated television special based on Dr. Seuss' "The Lorax", and the film version of "Charlotte's Web".

Holt appeared in a variety of different works, including animated films for both adults (the 1974 sequel "The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat") and for children, as well as voice and acting work in live-action films (for the blaxploitation film "Abby", Holt provided the voice of the Demon). In 1977, he was the voice of The Great Grape Ape on "The New Tom & Jerry Show". The same year, Holt provided the voice of Avatar in Ralph Bakshi's film "Wizards". Avatar's voice was an imitation of actor Peter Falk. In 1982, Bob Holt played the title role in Marvel Productions' "The Incredible Hulk", also in the process creating a library of stock roars that would be used for many years afterwards. In 1984, Holt provided the voices of Mogwai and the Gremlins for the dark comedy "Gremlins".

Bob Holt died of a heart attack at age 56 on August 2, 1985.
