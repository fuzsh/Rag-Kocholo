        "text": "In 2007 the Air Vomero introduced Cushlon foam—softer and more responsive than anything available at the time. The running staple also plays a prominent role in Nike’s history of ride due its combination of full length Zoom Air, Cushlon and Duralon technology. Although the Vomero was designed for everyday athletes, the silhouette has transformed into a lifestyle, everyday essential.\n\nSKU: CI1694-100"
