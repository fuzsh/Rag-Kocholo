        "text": "Antioch High School\n\nAntioch High School opened here in the fall of 1933, after community members from Antioch, Cane Ridge and Mims (Bakertown) signed petitions to the Board of Education urging them to choose Antioch, not Una, as the school location. Previously the school had been on Antioch Pike near Mill Creek. A wing for the elementary school was added in 1951, with another wing added in 1958. This building became Antioch Middle in 1997, when the high school moved to a new location on Hobson Pike.\n\nLocation: 5050 Blue Hole Rd.\n\nNumber 208\n\nErected 2020\n\nAntioch Pike\n\nThe Mill Creek Valley Turnpike Company was incorporated by the TN Gen. Assembly on January 21, 1846. Starting near the four-mile mark of Nolensville Pike, the road went through Mill Creek valley, “crossing main Mill creek at or near Rains’ mills, passing Antioch meeting house” and continuing south. Tollbooths could be established every five miles to pay for the completion of the road. The name was changed to Antioch Pike in October 1928.\n\nLocation: 2360 Antioch Pike\n\nNumber 164\n\nErected 2018\n\nBass Park\n\n{double-sided}\n\nThis .2-acre lot was purchased by East Nashville citizens and presented to the city on December 12, 1921 as a public park and playground. The undeveloped lot provided views of the adjacent fire hall and was intended to keep firefighters from being disturbed. Nashville’s smallest park, Bass Park was named in honor of Fire Captain Herman Bass, the first captain of the fire hall.\n\nLocation: 1602 Holly St.\n\nNumber 149\n\nErected 2013\n\nBelle Meade Golf Links Historic District\n\nPlatted in 1915 by developer Johnson Bransford, Belle Meade Golf Links is one of the early subdivisions that arose from the dissolution of the world-famous Belle Meade Plantation. This small residential district represents early 20th century subdivision design and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nLocation: Belle Meade Golf Links, Intersection of Windsor Dr. and Blackburn Ave.\n\nNumber 121\n\nErected 2005\n\nBelle Vue\n\nThe original log part of this house was built about 1818 by Abram DeMoss and named for the house his father Lewis DeMoss, built in 1797 overlooking the Harpeth River a mile southwest. In time the name was given to the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad depot and to the U.S. Post Office. Thus the Bellevue community owes its name to this historic site.\n\nLocation: 7306 Old Harding Road\n\nNumber 45\n\nErected 1971\n\nBellevue High School\n\nBellevue High School opened in 1931, serving almost 100 students. The first senior class graduated in 1933. A new high school opened across the street in 1970, and the former high school became a junior high. Amid community protests, Bellevue High School closed in 1980. The building was demolished in 1981. For the 50 years it stood, the school was the cornerstone of the Bellevue community, and students recorded numerous academic and athletic achievements.\n\nLocation: 659 Colice Jeanne Road\n\nNumber 262\n\nErected 2023\n\nBells Bend\n\n{double-sided}\n\nBells Bend, first known as White’s Bend, is an 18-square-mile area encompassed by a U-shaped bend in the Cumberland River. Numerous archaeological sites indicate that the area has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years. Bells Bend has thrived as an agricultural community since the early 19th century with landowners that included Montgomery Bell and David Lipscomb. The Clees family operated a mill and ferry service beginning in the 1870’s. Clees Ferry ceased operation in 1990.\n\nLocation: Old Hickory Blvd at Ashland City Highway\n\nNumber 136\n\nErected 2009\n\nBelmont-Hillsboro Neighborhood\n\nWhen Adelicia Acklen’s estate was sold in 1890, the Belmont Mansion and its grounds became Belmont College. Other portions, and parts of the neighboring Sunnyside Mansion property, were subdivided into residential lots by the Belmont Land Co. In 1900-1910, streetcar lines were built running to Cedar Lane on Belmont Boulevard and to Blair Boulevard on 21st Ave. The neighborhood became a National Register Historic District in 1980.\n\nLocation: 2500 Belmont Blvd.\n\nNumber 142\n\nErected 2011\n\nBelmont Mansion\n\nThis mansion was built in 1853 as a summer home for Joseph and Adelicia Acklen. An 1860 addition by architect Adolphus Heiman expanded the mansion’s size to 36 rooms. The entrance to the 177-acre estate, which featured gardens decorated with marble statues and cast iron gazebos, was on Hillsboro Pike. Also on the grounds were greenhouses, a water tower, bowling alley, zoo, art gallery and deer park.\n\nLocation: Belmont Campus in front of the mansion\n\nNumber 16\n\nErected 1969\n\nBerger Building\n\n{double-sided}\n\nIn 1926, Samuel W. Berger hired local architect Ozrow J. Billis to design this stylish building outfitted with colorful glazed terra cotta tiles. Berger was a Hungarian immigrant and one of the city’s leading retail merchants. The Roy Warden Piano and Organ Co., a popular music store, operated here for over forty years. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, the building is one of Nashville’s finest examples of early 20th century commercial design.\n\nLocation: 164 Rosa L. Parks Boulevard\n\nNumber 225\n\nErected 2020\n\nBlackwood Field\n\nIn 1921 the State rented land west of Shute Lane and erected two hangars here for the 105th Observation Squadron, Tennessee National Guard. The airfield of about 100 acres was named for H. O. Blackwood, who gave $1,000 to aid the project. The first airmail flight from Nashville was from here to Chicago July 29, 1924. Airplanes used the field until 1928.\n\nLocation: Shute Lane 0.3 miles north of Lebanon Rd.\n\nNumber 32\n\nErected 1970\n\nBlue Triangle YWCA\n\nThe Nashville Blue Triangle, the Negro branch of the Young Women’s Christian Association, was established in 1919. Located downtown in the thriving African American business district, it developed programs that supported the African American community. The largest Blue Triangle in the South, it had more than 700 members. On October 25, 1953, the branch moved to this site. It remained here until 1967, when Nashville’s YWCAs desegregated and merged.\n\nLocation: 500 17th Avenue N\n\nNumber 243\n\nErected 2022\n\nBMI Broadcast Music, Inc.\n\nBMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.), an organization that collects performance royalties for songwriters and music publishers in all genres of music, opened its doors in New York in 1940. BMI was the first performance rights organization to represent what was then commonly referred to as rural and race music in the forms of country, gospel, blues, and jazz. In 1958, BMI established a permanent Nashville office and hired Frances Williams Preston as manager. BMI constructed the first wing of this building in 1964 and expanded it in 1995. This office represents songwriters and music publishers in Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans, Muscle Shoals and Austin, and played a key role in developing Nashville as Music City, U.S.A.\n\nLocation: 10 Music Square East\n\nNumber 144\n\nErected 2012\n\nBradley Studios\n\nIn 1955, brothers Owen and Harold Bradley built a recording studio in the basement of a house on this site. They added another studio here in an army Quonset Hut, producing hits by Patsy Cline, Red Foley, Brenda Lee, Marty Robbins, Sonny James, and others. Columbia Records purchased the studios in 1962. The studio established its reputation in the music industry with hits by stars including Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Roger Miller, George Jones, and Tammy Wynette.\n\nDonated by the Mike Curb Foundation\n\nLocation: Bradley Park, 34 Music Square East\n\nNumber 140\n\nErected 2011\n\nBrewery at Mill Creek\n\nArthur Redmond, a European brewer who immigrated to Nashville in 1815, established a brewery and bakery on Chicken Pike, now Elm Hill Pike. Situated along the east side of Mill Creek near Foster’s and Buchanan’s mills, he brewed porter and ale and baked “ship bread” with barley purchased from local farmers. In 1819, Redmond was awarded a U.S. patent for “brewing improvements.” After his death in 1823, Paul Bianchi took over operations until closing in 1825.\n\nDonated by the Mertie Family\n\nLocation: 1675 Elm Hill Pike\n\nNumber 216\n\nErected 2020\n\nBuchanan Log House\n\nJames Buchanan (1763-1841) built this two-story single pen log house with hall and parlor plan c1807. The single pen log addition was added c1820 to accommodate the Buchanan family’s sixteen children. The house displays a high level of craftsmanship and is one of the best examples of two-story log construction in Middle Tennessee. The house was restored and placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nLocation: 2910 Elm Hill Pike\n\nNumber 130\n\nErected 2008\n\nBuena Vista Elementary School\n\nThe first Buena Vista School opened in 1888 and was demolished in 1936. Architects Marr & Holman designed this Jacobean-style school, opened in 1931. Three African American first grade students desegregated the school on September 9, 1957. About 100 protesters surrounded the school, but all students and parents made it safely inside. Members of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) visited parents in the area, supporting those already enrolled and encouraging others to join them.\n\nIn Brown v. Topeka (1954) and Brown II (1955) the U.S. Supreme Court ordered public schools nationwide to end racial segregation “with all deliberate speed.” Nashville failed to comply, resulting in the Kelley v. Board of Education case (1955) and the 1957 enactment of a grade-per-year plan starting at the first grade. In 1963, the Maxwell v. Davidson County (1960) case was merged with the Kelley case. In 1998, the court deemed the Metro school system to be desegregated.\n\nLocation: 1531 9th Avenue N\n\nNumber 221\n\nErected 2020\n\nCampaign to Win the Vote\n\nThe Nashville Equal Suffrage League was formed nearby in 1911 at the former Tulane Hotel. In coordination with the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association the energetic efforts of women leaders influenced public opinion in the decade ahead. Nashville’s suffragists hosted the 1914 convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), a milestone event. The Hermitage Hotel was headquarters and became the site of many future suffrage activities.\n\nLocation: 600 Church Street\n\nNumber 226\n\nErected 2020\n\nCaptain Ryman's Home\n\nOn this site stood the residence of Captain Thomas Green Ryman, owner of the Ryman steamboat line and builder of the Union Gospel Tabernacle, renamed Ryman Auditorium after his death in 1904. The Queen Anne frame house with a slate roof, seven gables and two turrets, served as the home of Captain and Mrs. Ryman and their seven children from 1885-1926. The house was razed in 1940.\n\nLocation: 500 2nd Avenue South\n\nNumber 92\n\nErected 1994\n\nCentennial Park Swimming Pool\n\nOpened in 1932, the pool served Nashville’s white community as a premier swimming facility for nearly 30 years. City officials abruptly closed the pool in 1961 after two African American student civil rights activists, Kwame (Leo) Lillard and Matthew Walker Jr., led an effort to desegregate the facility. The city responded by closing all Nashville public pools, blaming the sweeping closures on budgetary concerns.\n\nWhile many neighborhood pools eventually reopened in 1963 under the newly consolidated metropolitan government, this facility sat vacant for 10 years—to some, a daily reminder of the city’s racial divide. The pool’s bathhouse was renovated and reopened as Centennial Art Center on April 23, 1972. The former deep end of the swimming pool is preserved as a sunken lawn in the rear portion of the building’s courtyard.\n\nLocation: 301 25th Avenue N\n\nNumber 240\n\nErected 2022\n\nCentral High School\n\nFounded in 1915 as the first public high school in the county system, Central High School stood here from 1921-1971.

This tribe became firm friends of James Robertson and his people, but the settlement suffered many more raids by Cherokees and Creeks.\n\nLocation: Corner of Morrow Rd and Terry Dr.\n\nNumber 17\n\nErected 1969\n\nCity of Edgefield\n\nThe portion of East Nashville known as Edgefield, the name suggested by Gov. Neill S. Brown, was incorporated as a city January 2, 1869. Its approximate bounds were Shelby Ave., Sevier St., So. 10th St., Berry St., Cowan Ave. and the River. It’s first mayor was W.A.

As Fisk University, Tennessee A and I (Tennessee State University) and Meharry Medical College grew, more restaurants, shops and music venues opened to cater to nearby residents. Built in 1955 during the golden age of Jefferson Street’s music scene (1935-65), Club Baron is the only extant nightclub from that time. Owned by local pharmacist Jackson H. Brown, the building also served as a secondary location for Brown’s Pharmacy, as well as the only skating rink in town for African Americans. The club is best known as the site of a 1963 guitar duel where Nashville bluesman Johnny Jones bested the up-and-coming Jimi Hendrix. Other well-known performers included Fats Domino, Etta James, Little Richard, Otis Redding, Muddy Waters, Jackie Wilson and Ruth McFadden. Now owned by the Elks Lodge, the building was preserved as a local Historic Landmark in 2016.\n\nLocation: 2614 Jefferson St.\n\nNumber 193\n\nErected 2019\n\nCockrill School\n\nThrough the efforts of Mark Sterling Cockrill and Lemuel Davis, a school serving West Nashville children in grades 1-8 opened near here in 1888.

Mrs. Howe was wholly dedicated to the unique garden estate, and opened it to the community for nearly 40 years. After her death in 1968, the gardens were transplanted to Cheekwood.\n\nLocation: 1921 Greenwood Ave.\n\nNumber 170\n\nErected 2018\n\nCornelia Fort Airport\n\nCornelia Fort (1919-43), Nashville’s first woman flying instructor volunteer, Army’s WAFS, WWII, was the first woman pilot to die on war duty in American history. “I am grateful that my one talent, flying, was useful to my country.” she wrote shortly before her death.

Around midnight on December 14, 1924, a mob of at least six armed, white, masked men entered Nashville General Hospital and abducted Samuel Smith, age 15. The men quickly identified Smith, who was in police custody and chained to his bed. Nurse Amy Weagle attempted to hide the chain in an effort to thwart the abduction. In the early hours of December 15, the mob drove Smith to Frank Hill Road, now Old Burkett Road, near the site of the alleged robbery and shooting that led to his arrest. The mob stripped Smith of his pajamas, hung him from a tree with a thin rope, and shot him multiple times. Despite a grand jury investigation, public outcry and a reward offer in local newspapers, no one was ever arrested, charged or held accountable for the murder of Samuel Smith. This act of racial terror was meant not only to punish Smith for his alleged crimes, but to intimidate the local African American community and reinforce the racial hierarchy through violence. Though passed down for generations in the community, this story has now been spoken of openly in an effort toward reconciliation.\n\nLocation: 7200 Old Burkitt Road\n\nNumber 238\n\nErected 2021\n\nMadison College\n\nMadison College was founded in 1904 as Nashville Agricultural Normal Institute by Seventh-Day Adventists on a farm of 412 acres.

Lynchings became the most public and notorious form of racial terrorism, intended to intimidate African Americans and enforce racial segregation. These lynchings took place across the country and were perpetrated by people with no connection to one another, yet these rituals often included many of the same elements including abductions by a large mob (often from police custody), returning the victim to the scene of the alleged crime, stripping the victim to further inflict humiliation, and torture or mutilation.
