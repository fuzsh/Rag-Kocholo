        "text": "Film series\n\nTijuana Toads is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced by DePatieâ€“Freleng and released through United Artists.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series concerns two toads, El Toro and Pancho, who live in the Mexican city of Tijuana. Throughout the cartoon they try to eat their prey, but always get outsmarted.[2] They would sometimes themselves be targeted by a bird, Crazylegs Crane, and would in turn always outsmart him.\n\nThe series introduced two characters who later got their own series. The Blue Racer first appeared in \"Snake in the Gracias\" (1971) before getting his own series in 1972. Crazylegs Crane first appeared in \"Go for Croack\" (1969), and also spun off to his own series for television in 1978 on ABC. Both characters were voiced by Larry D. Mann, except in \"Flight to the Finish\" where Bob Holt voiced Crazylegs Crane.[3][4]\n\nEl Toro was voiced by actor Don Diamond and Pancho voiced by Tom Holland. Crazylegs Crane was voiced by Larry D. Mann. Directorial duties were split between Hawley Pratt, Art Davis, Grant Simmons, and Gerry Chiniquy.[3]\n\nWhen the series began airing in 1976 as part of The Pink Panther Laugh and a Half Hour and a Half Show, it was re-dubbed and renamed Texas Toads to make the series less offensive.[3] A laugh track was added to the new soundtrack, and the toads were given the new names of Fatso and Banjo.[3] Producer David H. DePatie later commented on the process:\n\n\"When they (Tijuana Toads) went on television, we had to completely change them around and the series became known as the Texas Toads, and we had to redo all of the tracks that had any type of ethnic content and it really watered down the series. We all thought it was a hell of a lot more funny when it was the Tijuana Toads, but at the time we had to do it in order to bring the thing on television\".[5]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air date1Tijuana Toads (TV title: \"Tall in the Grass\")Hawley PrattJohn W.
