        "text": "Like most of us, I’ve been sheltering in place for a few months now. I’ve caught up on most everything on my DVR and playlists on various streaming platforms, and the algorithms keep suggesting the same things over and over. I turned to the internet for lists of films to watch, but nearly all of them suggest the same mainstream stuff over and over – like, I’ve seen Blade Runner, most of us have seen Blade Runner, or at least are very aware of Blade Runner and can find Blade Runner should we want to see Blade Runner. Blade Runner.\n\nI thought a useful tool could be a list of films a little more off the beaten path – from overlooked studio pictures, to little indie gems, to movies that somehow failed to find a large audience but have small factions that swear by them. And, more importantly, where they can be found. I adore or at least enjoyed all of these. So, in alphabetical order, I present to you my picks for hopefully new entertainment to help pass the days stuck inside, along with the various services where they can be found to rent or stream. (A handy guide can be found at justwatch.com). Also, there’s some bonus entries at the end that I just can’t find as streamable online, but I wanted to notate them there.\n\n11. Children of Men (2006)\n\nOne of the best films of the 2000s, this one is pretty beloved and yet there are those who haven’t watched it yet, so I’m including it here. Bleak, harrowing, engrossing, damn near perfect. Alfonso Cuaron’s chronicle of a future where people haven’t been able to reproduce in nearly 20 years stars Clive Owen as a bureaucrat who has to protect the key to the human race. Featuring bravura single shot takes and one of the most thrilling car chasing that moves at less than 20 mph, Children of Men is truly unforgettable. Still not sold? Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam and Michael Caine are also in it. Just see it already. STARZ / DirecTV / Apple TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Vudu / Microsoft / Redbox / DirecTV / AMC Theatres On Demand\n\n18. Draft Day (2014)\n\nI like a feel-good sports drama, so a few will be making appearances on this list. Kevin Costner plays the GM of the Cleveland Browns (hey remember football? Er…sports in general?) who has the first pick in the NFL Draft. Pressure is on to draft a franchise quarterback, but Costner has other plans. It builds up significant suspense in the actual draft portion of the film, and, like Moneyball (which would be on here except it’s pretty known), has you rooting for the guys in the front office doing the math. Chadwick Boseman, Jennifer Garner, Frank Langella, Terry Crews, Ellen Burstyn, Denis Leary, Tom Welling and Sam Elliott co-star. Prime Video / Tubi / Apple TV / Amazon / Redbox / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango / Vudu / Micosoft / AMC Theatres On Demand\n\n24. Gattaca (1997)\n\nThe pacing and feel of this smart sci-fi film are magnificent – too bad it went kinda quietly at the box office when it opened. In the future, genetic engineering is used to create the “perfect” baby – while those born naturally are assigned menial jobs. Ethan Hawke plays Vincent, whose genes crush his dreams of being an astronaut, until he uses a DNA broker to borrow the identity of Jerome (Jude Law), who has the right makeup but is paralyzed. Throw in a murder and a detective (Alan Arkin) poking around, and Vincent’s true identity is threatened constantly. There’s a ton of great ideas being explored here, a wonderful score by Michael Nyman, and a killer cast including Uma Thurman, Tony Shalhoub, Gore Vidal, Loren Dean and Xander Berkeley. Fubo / IMDB TV / DirecTV / Sling / Pluto TV / Amazon / Fandango Now / Vudu / Redbox / Apple TV / Google Play / YouTube / Microsoft / AMC Theatres On Demand\n\n38. The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019)\n\nBoth a love-letter and a letter-to-the-editor to San Francisco, Joe Talbot’s first feature is an incredibly beautiful poetic drama. From the opening bravura sequence, you’ll be hooked by the atmosphere and absolutely breathtaking cinematography. Jimmie Fails plays a version of himself, a third generation San Franciscan, who, like many others, was pushed out and now crashes with his friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) and his blind grandfather (Danny Glover) in Hunter’s Point. Jimmie is obsessed with reclaiming his childhood home, built by his grandfather, as he regularly fixes it up much to the chagrin of the current residents. A stunning look at gentrification and a city in flux, if you’ve ever spent time in the Bay Area this will definitely resonate with you (as it did me, since I spent over a decade there). Prime Video / Kanopy / Apple TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Redbox / DirecTV / Vudu / Microsoft\n\n48. Modern Romance (1981)\n\nHad to include something by my comedy hero Albert Brooks on here, and “Modern Romance” felt like one most might not be familiar with (ditto “Real Life” which is also excellent, and of course “Defending Your Life” and “Lost in America” if you haven’t already). Brooks plays a neurotic film editor who can’t seem to figure things out with his patient girlfriend (Kathyrn Harold). Chock full of great dialogue (“You’ve heard of a no-win situation, right? No? Vietnam? This?”) and a ridiculous sequence involving sound EFX post work of the Hulk running down a corridor. Oh, and Albert’s late great brother Super Dave Osborne makes an appearance as a sporting goods salesman. With Bruno Kirby, James L. Brooks and George Kennedy. Amazon / Fandango Now / Vudu / Apple TV / Google Play / YouTube / Microsoft / DirecTV\n\n65. Queen of Katwe (2016)\n\nSpiritual cousin to my favorite film of all time (more on that later), Mira Nair (“Monsoon Wedding”) helms this inspirational true story from the Mouse House that tells the tale of Phiona Mutesi (played by newcomer Madina Nalwanga), a teenage girl living in the slums of Uganda who finds she has a master-level understanding of chess. David Oyelowo plays her teacher who sees a way out of the slums and into university for her, while Lupita Nyong’o (excellent as always) plays her mother who worries she’ll forget where she came from. Incredibly well executed and engaging from frame one, it’ll have you cheering. Disney+ / Apple TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Vudu / Microsoft / DirecTV / AMC Theatres on Demand\n\n66. Quick Change (1990)\n\nTotally underrated comedy from Bill Murray (who also co-directed), it’s chock full of laughs and fun situations and great chemistry from its trio of stars. Murray plays Grimm, fed up with NYC who plots to rob a bank dressed as a clown. Aided by Phyllis (Geena Davis) and Loomis (Randy Quaid), the three need to get out of town and to the airport before a police chief (Jason Robards) catches up to them. Easier said than done. A ton of great comedic actors have fun character bits including Tony Shalhoub as a cab driver who doesn’t understand English, Stanley Tucci as a mobster, Phil Hartman (man I miss him) as an apartment owner and Philip Bosco as an uptight bus driver. Vudu / Apple TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Microsoft / Redbox / DirecTV\n\n71. The Rover (2014)\n\nThe movie that made me go, “Oh, Robert Pattinson is a really good actor.” A decade after a global collapse, a man (Guy Pearce) travels through the Australian Outback (boy, there seem to be a lot of outback movies on this list) trying to find the gang that stole his car. He finds himself taking one of them in tow for the journey – Rey (Pattinson), a young man with intellectual disability. A slow build that simmers with intensity, director David Michod (“Animal Kingdom,” also excellent) has crafted a simple yet effective action drama, elevated by the two leads and a cast that includes Scoot McNairy (I should tally how often he pops up in movies on this list), Tawanda Manyimo and David Field. NETFLIX / Kanopy / Amazon / Vudu / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Microsoft / DirecTV / FLIX Fling\n\n76. Seems Like Old Times (1980)\n\nOne of my favorite comedies of all-time, this Neil Simon-penned story stars Chevy Chase as Nick, reclusive writer forced to rob a bank by criminals. On the run, he turns to his ex-wife Gloria (Goldie Hawn) for help. She’s a public defender, but is now married to a prosecutor named Ira (Charles Grodin) who has it out for Nick. The three leads play so well off each other – this is my favorite Grodin performance. The dialogue is vintage Simon, the situations are hilariously farcical, and the supporting cast also includes T.K. Carter and Robert Guillaume, who utters one of my most quoted lines – “Love that Chicken Pepperoni!” Pluto TV / Amazon / Fandango Now / Vudu / Redbox / Apple TV / Google Play / YouTube / Microsoft / DirecTV\n\n85. Son of Rambow (2007)\n\nMan do I love Will Poulter (we’ll see him again towards the end of the list). Set in the 80s during an English summer, it follows two boys (Bill Milner and Poulter) who, armed with a VHS camera, make a war film inspired by “First Blood.” Anyone who made little movies with their friends growing up will certainly identify as I sure did, as the charming film is full of creativity and imagination. It’s sparked a quest in me to dig up my old VHS endeavors I made with my trusty Panasonic. Directed by Garth Jennings. Prime Video / Roku / Tubi / Kanopy / Pluto TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Vudu / Microsoft / Apple TV / Fandango Now\n\n86. Stardust (2007)\n\nI’m a big fan of Neil Gaiman, whose work can be complicated to bring to the screen, but this adaption truly soars thanks to Gaiman’s screenplay and Matthew Vaughn’s deft direction. A fairy tale following a boy (Daredevil’s Charlie Cox) and a falling star (Claire Danes) has everything you’d want in this kind of film – action, romance, comedy, you name it. If you’re a fan of “The Princess Bride,” this is right up your alley. And the cast is full of heavy-hitters, including Michelle Pfeiffer as a witch tracking the star down, Robert DeNiro as a feared Pirate captain putting on a façade, Ricky Gervais as a shifty merchant, Peter O’Toole as a dying king and memorable turns from Sienna Miller, Rupert Everett, Mark Strong, Ben Barnes, David Kelly, Henry Cavill and Ian McKellen as the Narrator. FLIX Fling / NETFLIX / DirecTV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Vudu / Microsoft / Redbox / Apple TV\n\n91. Tell No One (2006)\n\nIntriguing French thriller based on the book by Harlan Coben (if you want fun cliffhangers, watch his various series on NETFLIX), it stars Francois Cluzet as Dr. Alexandre Beck, whose wife Margot (Marie-Josee Croze) was murdered eight years ago. When two bodies are found where she was murdered, the case is reopened, and Alexandre is a suspect – and things get really complicated when he receives an email from Margot, who evidently is still alive. What follows is a twisty, Fugitive-like mystery that’ll keep you on the edge of your seat. With Kristin Scott Thomas, directed by Guillaume Canet. Hoopla / Kanopy / Mubi / Fandor / Google Play / YouTube / Vudu / Microsoft / Apple TV\n\n100. Zero Effect (1998)\n\nBill Pullman shines as eccentric detective Daryl Zero in Jake Kasdan’s fun neo noir crime comedy. Ben Stiller plays his long suffering assistant, who does his best to aid him in as he tries to deduce who is blackmailing a wealthy executive (Ryan O’Neal). Quirky, genuinely surprising and well-constructed, it’s a shame it didn’t inspire a series of Daryl Zero mystery films. Apple TV / Amazon / Google Play / YouTube / Fandango Now / Vudu / Microsoft / Redbox / DirecTV\n\nAnd here’s the list of titles that would have been included but weren’t on streaming devices:\n\nAmerican Movie, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, The Hot Rock, King of the Hill, Mirage, Series 7: The Contenders, State of Grace, Terri, The Sure Thing, A Thousand Clowns, Trekkies and The Wrong Guy.\n\nThat’s it – hope you find some new favorites! Please pass this on, and don’t be a jerk – picks are subjective and I did this just for fun. Thanks!"
