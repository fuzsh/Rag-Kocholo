DePatie and Friz Freleng between 1969 and 1978, starring the animated Pink Panther character from the opening credits of the live-action films. The series was produced by Mirisch Films and DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, and was broadcast on two American television networks: from September 6, 1969, to September 2, 1978, on NBC; and from September 9, 1978, to August 30, 1980, on ABC.\n\nSyndication\n\nUnited Artists Television syndicated The Pink Panther Show in 1980, complete with bumpers and laugh-tracked versions of the shorts. By 1982, MGM Television began syndicating some individual cartoons to local stations to air them as they saw fit. This format did not contain the series' bumpers nor the laugh track.\n\nThe following series were included in MGM Television's syndication package:\n\nThe Pink Panther\n\nThe Inspector\n\nThe Ant and the Aardvark\n\nTijuana Toads/Texas Toads\n\nMisterjaw (made-for-television series)\n\nThe following series were not included in the MGM Television distribution package:\n\nRoland and Rattfink\n\nThe Blue Racer\n\nHoot Kloot\n\nThe Dogfather\n\nCrazylegs Crane (made-for-television series)\n\nMost television stations aired the later package released in 1982, featuring the cartoon shorts by themselves, isolated from the show's original bumpers sequences. The laugh track was also silenced on all entries except for Misterjaw. Chicago-based WGN-TV was one of the few stations to air the 1980 The Pink Panther Show syndication package. Conversely, New York City-based WPIX featured a stripped-down version of the shorts, airing the entries without the laugh track, bumpers, or theatrical opening/closing credits.\n\nReruns\n\nThe Pink Panther Show (1969–1971) and The New Pink Panther Show (1971–1974) has been remastered in its original format. It was previously shown on BBC Two, UK Gold, BBC One, Boomerang (2000–2009) and Cartoon Network (1993–2002). In the late 2000s, it aired in Canada on Teletoon Retro weekday mornings at 8:00 am. Teletoon Retro showed all 32 episodes of The Pink Panther Show with the panther and the Inspector, all 17 episodes of The New Pink Panther Show with the panther and the Ant and the Aardvark, and select episodes of the first syndicated Pink Panther Show series (only those episodes with the middle cartoon being an Ant and Aardvark). Teletoon Retro then showed all 16 episodes of The All New Pink Panther Show, with the panther and Crazylegs Crane. The laugh track is muted for most entries.\n\nThe episodes shown on Teletoon Retro also featured remastered versions, while the wrap-around content was in rougher condition. The Inspector cartoon, Tour de Farce, had the wrong title card, that for Reaux, Reaux, Reaux Your Boat.\n\nCartoon Network reran The Pink Panther Show from 1997 to 1999, and intermittently in 2006, 2009, and 2012. A \"no-frills\" version aired on Boomerang five days a week at 5:30 am, 10 am and 2:30 pm;; the Boomerang version included four shorts and no bumpers, in the style of its other theatrical-short compilation shows. Until August 2009, Boomerang only featured shorts from The Pink Panther, The Ant and the Aardvark and The Inspector. The laugh track was present on several entries. Currently, the show remains intact on the Spanish Language Boomerang TV channel with most entries containing their original laugh track. The Pink Panther show aired on Boomerang from 2005 to 2012. In the Arab world, it was shown on Spacetoon from 2014 to 2017, due to Spacetoon airing The Pink Panther and low reception from Spacetoon viewers.\n\nThe show also previously aired in its original format on This TV on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:30 am Eastern Time (as part of its Cookie Jar Toons programming block) until September 22, 2011. The digital broadcast network Light TV ran the series when the network launched Christmas weekend 2016 until September 29, 2019. Currently, the show aired on Galavisión as this show dubbed in Spanish, it aired on Monday thru Fridays at 7:30 am ET/6:30 am CT, 1:00 pm ET/noon CT, 1:30 pm ET/ 12:30 pm CT, and 11:00 pm ET/10:00 pm CT.\n\nOverall cast\n\nRich Little – Pink Panther\n\nDaws Butler – Pug, Louie\n\nJohn Byner – Charlie Ant, Blue Aardvark\n\nLarry D.

The show was \"hosted\" by The Pink Panther and The Inspector, seen during the opening sequence, which showed a boy driving the Panthermobile from the countryside to Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. During the journey, images of animals mentioned in the song (rhinoceros, tiger, cats, American mink) are seen alongside clips of the panther from Reel Pink, Come On In! The Water's Pink and Put Put Pink. Upon arrival, the Pink Panther and the Inspector then disembark from the Panthermobile and enter the famous theatre. In the ending credits, the Inspector climbs back into the Panthermobile, but leaves the Pink Panther behind, who is seen chasing after the car.\n\nThe entries utilized for the second season featured complete original theatrical titles. With only two exceptions, the first and third cartoons of each episode were Pink Panthers, and second was an Inspector. In the two exceptions, the first and third cartoons were Inspectors, and the middle one was a Pink Panther. Unlike Season 1, a full laugh track was not used but rather an abridged version using isolated laughs from Season 1 edited onto the soundtrack by DFE (these inferior versions currently in circulation are marked with †). Seasons 1 and 2 were repackaged as a single Season 1 in the 2000s.\n\nSeason 1 (1969–1970)\n\nEpisode No. 1st cartoon 2nd cartoon 3rd cartoon Original Air Date #01 The Pink Blueprint Bomb Voyage The Pink Tail Fly September 6, 1969 #02 Pinto Pink Le Pig-Al Patrol In the Pink September 13, 1969 #03 Jet Pink The Pique Poquette of Paris Tickled Pink September 20, 1969 #04 The Pink Pill Plastered in Paris Pink Pistons (mistitled Pink Piston) September 27, 1969 #05 Rock A Bye Pinky Toulouse La Trick Sink Pink October 4, 1969 #06 Prehistoric Pink Reaux, Reaux, Reaux Your Boat Come On In!

The show's new title song, \"Pantherly Pride\", was written by Doug Goodwin and played over the opening sequence.\n\nThis incarnation aired The Ant and the Aardvark during the 1971–1972 season. Later seasons swapped The Ant and the Aardvark with theatrical series' Roland and Rattfink, Hoot Kloot or The Blue Racer, as well as reruns of The Inspector. Only eight new Pink Panther cartoons were produced over this three-year period (in Bold).\n\nEpisode No. The Pink Panther\n\nEntry 1\n\nThe Ant and the Aardvark The Pink Panther\n\nEntry 2\n\nOriginal Air Date #01 In the Pink of the Night Technology, Phooey Super Pink September 11, 1971 #02 Think Before You Pink Ants in the Pantry Pink-a-Rella September 18, 1971 #03 Twinkle Twinkle Little Pink Isle of Caprice Pink Punch September 25, 1971 #04 Pink on the Cob Rough Brunch Congratulations It's Pink October 2, 1971 #05 Pink Outs Scratch a Tiger Pink, Plunk, Plink October 9, 1971 #06 Extinct Pink Science Friction Pink Paradise October 16, 1971 #07 A Fly in the Pink The Ant From Uncle Pinkfinger October 23, 1971 #08 Pink Blue Plate The Froze Nose Knows Little Beaux Pink October 30, 1971 #09 Pink Tuba-Dore Dune Bug Sink Pink November 6, 1971 #10 Pink-In Don't Hustle an Ant with Muscle † The Pink Tail Fly November 13, 1971 #11 Psst Pink Never Bug an Ant The Pink Blueprint November 20, 1971 #12 Psychedelic Pink The Ant and the Aardvark Gong with the Pink November 27, 1971 #13 Pink Pranks Hasty But Tasty In the Pink December 4, 1971 #14 The Pink Flea I've Got Ants in My Plans Pinto Pink December 11, 1971 #15 Slink Pink Odd Ant Out Tickled Pink December 18, 1971 #16 Pinkadilly Circus From Bed to Worse Pinkcome Tax December 25, 1971 #17 We Give Pink Stamps Mumbo Jumbo Lucky Pink January 1, 1972\n\nThe Pink Panther and Friends (1974–1976)\n\nThe Pink Panther and Friends (1974–1976) followed the same format as The New Pink Panther Show. The first Pink Panther entry was a new episode, while the second was a repeat of an old entry. Bumpers featuring The Inspector and The Ant and the Aardvark connected the three entries. New series The Dogfather (originally produced for theatrical release) was also added to broadcasts, in addition to The Blue Racer or Hoot Kloot.\n\nEpisode No. The Pink Panther\n\nnew entry The Ant and the Aardvark\n\nrepeat The Pink Panther\n\nrepeat #01 Salmon Pink The Ant and the Aardvark The Pink Phink #02 Pink Streaker Never Bug an Ant Reel Pink #03 Pink Plasma The Ant from Uncle The Pink Tail Fly #04 Pink Campaign Technology Phooey Smile Pretty Say Pink #05 Pink Piper Hasty But Tasty The Pink Blueprint #06 Bobolink Pink Isle of Caprice Pink-a-Boo #07 Trail of the Lonesome Pink Dune Bug Pink, Plunk, Plink #08 Pink Aye Ants in the Pantry Genie With the Light Pink Fur #09 Keep Our Forests Pink Science Friction Super Pink #10 Pink DaVinci Odd Ant Out Prefabricated Pink #11 Forty Pink Winks Rough Brunch Pink Outs #12 Sherlock Pink I've Got Ants in My Plans Pinkadilly Circus #13 Therapeutic Pink Don't Hustle an Ant with Muscle Come On In, The Water's Pink! #14 Pink Elephant Scratch a Tiger Twinkle Twinkle Little Pink #15 It's Pink But Is It Mink?

The show was expanded to 90 minutes, and included a live-action segment featuring comedian Lenny Schultz reading letters and jokes from viewers. The show also featured two new made-for-television series, a first for the franchise: the Texas Toads (a redubbed version of the theatrical Tijuana Toads series), and Misterjaw. New bumper sequences featuring both the Texas Toads and Misterjaw were created for the series. These new entries were aired in combination with repeats of The Pink Panther, The Inspector and The Ant and the Aardvark.\n\nIt's the All New Pink Panther Laugh-and-a-Half Hour-and-a-Half Show Introducing Misterjaw did not do well in the ratings, and lasted only one season.\n\nThink Pink Panther (1977–1978)\n\nThe final series broadcast on NBC, Think Pink Panther reverted to the traditional 30-minute format and consisted of repeats. No new cartoons were created for this show.\n\nThe All New Pink Panther Show (1978–1979)\n\nThe All New Pink Panther Show (1978–1979) was a new version of the series commenced after NBC's broadcast of the series ended its nine-year run. For its tenth season, ABC picked up the series and requested 32 new made-for-television Pink Panther shorts, along with 16 entries for the new Crazylegs Crane segment. A disco-flavored rendition of Henry Mancini's \"Pink Panther Theme\" was used for the opening and closing credits, with the closing credits featuring a disco-dancing panther. \"Stay Tuned\" bumpers were produced for seven episodes as well.\n\nEpisode No. The Pink Panther\n\nEntry 1\n\nCrazylegs Crane The Pink Panther\n\nEntry 2\n\nOriginal Air Date #01 Pink Bananas Crane Brained Pinktails for Two September 9, 1978 #02 Pink Arcade Life With Feather Pink S.W.A.T.

No new cartoons were created for this show.\n\nThe Pink Panther Show (1980, syndicated)\n\nMGM/UA Television syndicated a weekday 30-minute Pink Panther show in 1980, complete with bumpers and laugh-tracked versions of the shorts. A new opening sequence preceding the show featured Henry Mancini's \"Pink Panther Theme\" played under a segment from Pink Outs featuring the Pink Panther folding the backdrop into a square to be eaten. The closer featured the last few seconds of the theme played under a scene from Reel Pink featuring the panther water skiing.\n\nMGM/UA created two versions of the syndication package. The first consisted of The Pink Panther, Inspector, The Ant and the Aardvark and Texas Toads entries sourced from film elements utilized during the program's original network run.\n\nThe second version consisted of The Pink Panther, The Ant and the Aardvark and Misterjaw entries sourced from new prints of the original film negatives and transferred to videotape, resulting in sharper images. As The Pink Panther and The Ant and the Aardvark entries were sourced using theatrical prints (sans laugh track), a new, less invasive laugh track being employed on sitcoms at the time was added to the soundtrack for consistency to match the made-for-television Misterjaw entries and bumper sequences that retained their respective laugh-tracked soundtracks.\n\nThe second version also incorporated several of the made-for-television Pink Panther entries from The All New Pink Panther Show. Pre-1978 Pink Panther and Ant and the Aardvark entries featured shorter opening titles with introduction music from either The New Pink Panther Show (1971–1974) or The All New Pink Panther Show (1978–1979). Closing credits featuring the Pink Panther disco dancing from The All New Pink Panther Show closed out the episodes.\n\nVersion 1\n\nThe Pink Panther\n\nEntry 1\n\nThe Inspector,\n\nThe Ant and the Aardvark, or\n\nTexas Toads The Pink Panther\n\nEntry 2\n\nPink Plasma Sicque!
