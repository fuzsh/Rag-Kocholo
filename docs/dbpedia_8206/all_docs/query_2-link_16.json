It's a lengthy examination of bad taste comedy that would make Mickey Rooney wince, but the DePatie-Freleng production team isn't necessarily mean-spirited about it, following comedy targets of the day to help provide clarity of character. It's ugly, no doubt, and perhaps the whole series is best left tucked inside the folds of animation history, but for those willing to look beyond a bad idea, \"The Blue Racer\" provides manic chases and disasters, sold with customary cartoon fury and, mercifully, some brevity.\n\nThe Blue Racer is a character always on the move, and usually making plans for a feast, with eggs and insects his preferred meals. Throughout 17 episodes, the snake is perpetually challenged during his quest to cure his hunger pains, often meeting with the Japanese Beetle, a flower- munching tourist of sorts who's always in the line of fire, forced to use skills of evasion and martial arts to keep the Blue Racer at bay. The concept behind \"The Blue Racer\" is basic cartoon rivalry, with their eternal combat challenging the animators to dream up new ways to smack around the snake, twisting, bending, and smashing his body while the Japanese Beetle zooms through the sky, just out of reach. Adding to the hunt are appearances from an elephant, a bear, and even another DePatie-Freleng creation, Crazylegs Crane, doing their part to break up the action, which quickly falls into snake-twisting routine.\n\nEpisodes\n\n\"Support Your Local Serpent\" (6:42)\n\nOn the prowl for something to eat, the Blue Racer comes across the Japanese Beetle, commencing a war of survival that beats and flattens the speedy snake.\n\n\"Hiss & Hers\" (6:22)\n\nFacing punishment from his domineering wife, the Blue Racer sets out to find a meal for his three children, coming across the Japanese Beetle, who won't be consumed without a fight.\n\n\"Nippon Tuck\" (6:25)\n\nLost in the southwest, Japanese Beetle is excited to find refuge in a small town. Unfortunately, the area is home to the Blue Racer, who takes to the air and attempts hypnotism to lure a potential meal into his stomach.\n\n\"Blue Racer Blues\" (6:29)\n\nLonely, the Blue Racer makes a trip into the city to find friends, following guidance from the Japanese Beetle, who leads the snake into disastrous situations with the dismissive locals.\n\n\"Wham and Eggs\" (6:27)\n\nVisiting an egg hunt to acquire a meal, the Blue Racer discovers a newborn dragon who can't control his fire-breathing powers, reluctantly becoming a parent to the needy creature.\n\n\"Punch and Judo\" (6:17)\n\nSneaking around for an egg-based meal, the Blue Racer runs into the Japanese Beetle, who shows off his martial art skills while avoiding capture.\n\n\"Camera Bug\" (6:20)\n\nOn a photography tour, the Japanese Beetle comes across the Blue Racer, avoiding the snake's pursuit while snapping pictures of nature.\n\n\"Fowl Play\" (6:25)\n\nA Baby Chick takes a bite out of the Blue Racer, complaining to his eye patch-wearing father when the snake doesn't submit. Defending his kid, the Rooster forces the snake to play with the Baby Chick, sending the Blue Racer into harm's way.\n\n\"Snake Preview\" (6:19)\n\nSpotting an egg in a tree, the Blue Racer makes a play to steal dinner, only to find the father, Crazylegs Crane ready, to defend his unborn child.\n\n\"Freeze a Jolly Good Fellow\" (6:22)\n\nLost in Alaska, the Blue Racer finds an abandoned house to help escape the bitter cold. Competing for the dwelling is a bear who works hard to keep the snake from claiming the property.\n\n\"The Boa Friend\" (6:22)\n\nDumped by his fiancée, the Blue Racer declares war on her new lover, Homer, a boa constrictor. Seeking advice, the snake finds help from a singing bee.\n\n\"Killarney Blarney\" (6:24)\n\nStuck at sea, the Blue Racer finds his way to a remote island, discovering a pot of gold. Confronted by leprechauns, the snake fights to survive the wrath of \"The Great Shillelagh.\"\n\n\"Blue Aces Wild\" (6:24)\n\nEnvious of birds, the Blue Racer wishes he had wings, finding help from a wizard in need of snake sweat to complete his magic potion.\n\n\"Yokahama Mama\" (6:21)\n\nIn Japan, the Blue Racer infiltrates a chicken farm to gobble down eggs, only to be rejected by the inhabitants, who thwart his schemes to acquire dinner.\n\n\"Love & Hisses\" (6:21)\n\nOn vacation in Japan, the Blue Racer searches for food, encountering trouble with ants, an elephant, and the Japanese Beetle.\n\n\"Aches & Snakes\" (6:25)\n\nAwaiting the birth of his first child, Crazylegs Crane is sent out by his wife to acquire a bee for a treat, competing with the Blue Racer for the buzzing prey.\n\n\"Little Boa Peep\" (6:48)\n\nFeeling depressed, the Blue Racer pays a visit to his analyst, Dr. Owlsley-Hoot, for help. Looking to reshape his identity, the snake pretends to be a sheep dog, quickly rejected by the animal kingdom.\n\nThe Blue Racer Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nThe AVC encoded image (1.33:1 aspect ratio) presentation secures a satisfying look at the limited animation realm of \"The Blue Racer.\" Detail reaches as far as it can go (outsourced episodes are noticeably softer), picking up on animation techniques and character design, and backgrounds are encouragingly clear, welcoming a full scan of artistic achievements. Primaries are bold and secure, also preserving shifting hues as the titular snake changes color from short to short, reflecting a lack of production leadership. Blues and yellows dominate, and they look strong. Delineation is secure. Source has its speckling and mild scratches, but remains without pronounced damage.\n\nThe Blue Racer Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThe 2.0 DTS-HD MA mix isn't defined to satisfaction, with a more muffled sound that doesn't entirely support cartoon antics. Intelligibility doesn't take over, but sharpness is lacking, while extremes in action provide crackly highs. Scoring is also unremarkable, but supports as intended. Sound effects are agreeable, with all the whips, bams, and bonks communicated adequately. Hiss is present throughout all the episodes.\n\nThe Blue Racer Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nCommentaries features historian Jerry Beck on \"Support Your Local Serpent\" and \"Little Boa Peep,\" cartoon writer William Hohauser on \"Wham & Eggs,\" author Mark Arnold on \"Punch & Judo\" and \"Blue Aces Wild,\" filmmaker Greg Ford on \"Fowl Play,\" and Bob Balser on \"Little Boa Peep.\"\n\n\"Range Rovers\" (20:52, HD) discusses the making of \"The Blue Racer\" and \"Hoot Kloot,\" with historians Beck and Arnold joining animator Art Leonardi, character layout artist Martin Strudler, ink-and-paint artist Barbara Donatelli, and animation reviewer Will Friedwald for an inspection of creative inspirations. While the featurette is a bit heavy on cartoon clips, information is valuable, including a reveal that some of the shorts were outsourced to other countries, identifying differences in artistry. Memories of Friz Freleng are also shared, pointing out how the animation legend often became part of his creations, with characters inheriting his short stature and odd temper.\n\n\"Art for Art's Sake\" (19:47, HD) focuses on Art Leonardi, a critical member of the DePatie-Freleng organization, covering his professional history and select achievements in the industry, including providing animation the title sequences for \"Revenge of the Pink Panther\" and \"Trail of the Pink Panther,\" which are presented without its original soundtrack.\n\nThe Blue Racer Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\n\"The Blue Racer\" isn't especially funny, and the production's reliance on stereotype humor is tiresome and unimaginative. Newcomers to the shorts might be appalled, but comedic mischief remains in brief blasts of cartoon violence, and for animation purists, background work has moments of beauty, especially for a low-budget effort. \"The Blue Racer\" is not a lost classic, but an artifact from a different, less sensitive time, and it's best left for purists who understand the era in which the shorts were produced.\n\nForum Discussions\n\nNo related forum discussions for The Blue Racer yet.\n\nThe Blue Racer Blu-ray Screenshots\n\nBack to The Blue Racer Blu-ray »"
