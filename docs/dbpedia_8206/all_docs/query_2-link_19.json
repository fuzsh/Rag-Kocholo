        "text": "Production\n\nThe cartoons are directed by Art Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Sid Marcus, Bob McKimson, David Deneen, Bob Balser, Cullen Houghtaling and produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. The majority of the cartoons were animated at the DePatie-Freleng studio, except for two done overseas: Aches and Snakes at Australia's Filmgraphics studio, and Little Boa Peep at Spain's Pegbar Productions.\n\nPlot\n\nA fast blue snake named Blue Racer (voiced by Larry D. Mann) tries unsuccessfully to catch a stereotypically-Japanese beetle (voiced by Tom Holland), who is a black belt in karate. Both characters spun off from Tijuana Toads in \"Hop and Chop\" (the Japanese beetle) and \"Snake in the Gracias\" (the Blue Racer). The goofy bird from the Tijuana Toads (Crazylegs Crane, who also repeatedly failed to collar the Racer and Toads himself) also later appeared in the series as well. 17 cartoons were produced.\n\nProduction\n\nBob Holt voiced both the Blue Racer and the Japanese Beetle in the 1972 short Support Your Local Serpent.\n\nThe Japanese Beetle's last appearance was in the 1972 short Blue Racer Blues.\n\nFilmography\n\nAll cartoons written by John W. Dunn.\n\nOther appearances\n\nThe Blue Racer (or a snake looking just like him) appeared in the 1978 Pink Panther cartoon \"Pinktails for Two\" where he mistook the Panther's pink tail for a lady Snake. In this film, The Blue Racer did not speak or move with super speed.\n\nHome Video Release\n\nAll 17 shorts will be available on DVD and Blu-ray on May 16th, 2017 from Kino Lorber (through their deal with MGM). Extras will include audio commentaries and 2 featurettes."
