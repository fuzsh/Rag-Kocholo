This is a long and slender snake with large and prominent eyes. Adults are black or bluish/black with white or whitish markings on the chin and throat. Juveniles are gray with distinct reddish-brown blotches running down the back of the head and body.\n\nRange in Florida\n\nNorth American racers are found throughout mainland Florida in every county. They also occur on the Florida Keys.\n\nAssessment of risk to people and pets\n\nNon-Venomous. North American racers are not dangerous to people or pets, but they will readily bite to defend themselves. Racers are not aggressive and avoid direct contact with people and pets. Virtually all bites occur when the snakes are intentionally molested.\n\nComparison with other species\n\nEastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi) Non-venomous\n\nEastern Coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum) Non-venomous\n\nEastern Ratsnake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis) Non-venomous\n\nPygmy Rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius) Venomous\n\nShare your observations\n\nYou can help scientists better understand the biology and distribution of this species by sharing your observations.
