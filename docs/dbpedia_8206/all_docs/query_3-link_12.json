        "text": "In this blog post, we answer the most common questions about the Blue Racer snake (Coluber constrictor foxii)— an endangered snake species in Ontario’s Carolinian zone.\n\nAlso, we go deeper into the challenges faced by the Blue Racer against the backdrop of the global biodiversity crisis. To do this, we explore recent research conducted by Ryan Wolfe. Explaining the conservation status of the Blue Racer population on Pelee Island, Canada.\n\nWhat is a Blue Racer snake?\n\nThe non-venomous Blue Racer (Coluber constrictor foxii) is a subspecies of the North American Racer (Coluber constrictor) considered the rarest snake in Canada. Researcher Ryan Wolfe estimated the current population size to be only around 152 individuals.\n\nImpressively enough, the Blue Racer reaches a snout-to-vent length (SVL) spanning from 90 cm to 152 cm. Making it among the larger snake species found in Ontario. It has impressive speed and vibrant blue-green coloration.\n\nWhere do Blue Racer snakes live?\n\nGeographic range\n\nBlue Racers primarily inhabit Pelee Island in Lake Erie, situated at the extreme southwestern tip of Ontario, Canada. They once inhabited the Ontario mainland but faced habitat loss, limiting their range.\n\nThey inhabit grasslands, fields, savannahs, and open woodlands. Furthermore, distribution information shows that their range extends south of the Great Lakes in the United States, covering states like Ohio, Indiana, and west to Iowa.\n\nWhat does the Blue Racer snake look like?\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nDescribed by the Canadian Herpetological Society, Blue Racers are tan, pale blue, or bluish-green with a white or bluish belly and a distinctive “mask” around the eyes. Moreover, Young racers may have a blotched pattern, resembling other snake species in the region.\n\nAlso, they are long, slender, and may reach lengths close to two meters. They can grow over 130 centimeters in length.\n\nWhat does the Blue Racer snake eat?\n\nDiet\n\nBlue Racers are carnivorous diurnal hunters. They feed on a variety of species from rodents and frogs to other snakes and small birds.\n\nAccording to a study led by Corissa Pauline Lenon, the Blue Racer snake appears to follow a dietary pattern typical of an opportunistic predator.\n\nIs the Blue Racer snake venomous?\n\nBehavior\n\nNo, the Blue Racer is non-venomous. It relies on speed and agility to escape predators and catch prey.\n\nBlue Racers are generally not aggressive towards humans. However, It is not recommended to keep Blue Racers as pets, as replicating their specific habitat and dietary requirements in captivity can be challenging. They are known for their avoidant nature and tendency to flee when approached.\n\nIs the Blue Racer snake endangered?\n\nConservation status\n\nAlthough the Blue Racer snake hasn’t been assessed by the IUCN Red List, it is currently listed as Endangered under both the Ontario Endangered Species Act, 2007, and the federal Species at Risk Act. Researchers like Ryan Wolfe, MSc in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto (2022) have studied the vulnerable status of this species. According to the results of his study, only about 152 Blue Racer snakes are left on Pelee island.\n\nApplying the robust design (RD) model in capture-mark-recapture analyses, Wolfe estimated the current population size to be approximately 152 individuals.\n\nBefore zooming in on the Blue Racer, it’s crucial to understand the broader context of the biodiversity crisis affecting reptiles and amphibians. With habitat loss, environmental pollution, invasive species, and climate change driving declines, urgent conservation measures are imperative. These declines, particularly in reptiles, have been underrepresented until recent times, bringing the Blue Racer into focus.\n\nThe Blue Racer is a keystone species with a vital role in ecosystem functioning. Habitat loss due to agricultural development on Pelee Island has been a significant threat to the Canadian Blue Racer population. Its range has dramatically reduced in Ontario, with the species now confined to the eastern two-thirds of Pelee Island.\n\nThe human-impacted landscape of Ontario’s Carolinian zone exacerbates the challenges faced by the Blue Racer. Sixty percent of at-risk snakes in this area are listed as endangered, with declining and isolated populations.\n\nBlue Snake’s Conservation Challenges\n\nAdditionally, previous estimates for the Blue Racer population on Pelee Island, though produced in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, are outdated and potentially unreliable. These estimates, coupled with challenges in survey methodologies, underscore the need for a current and accurate population assessment.\n\nTo address the gaps in knowledge and provide a contemporary perspective on the Blue Racer population, Ryan Wolfe conducted a comprehensive two-year study on Pelee Island. Applying the robust design (RD) model in capture-mark-recapture analyses, Wolfe estimated the current population size to be approximately 152 individuals. This study offers valuable insights into the declining trend observed since the early 2000s.\n\nWolfe’s findings signal an immediate need for conservation intervention. Especially at specific sites showing a significant decrease in Blue Racer abundance. Annual surveys and habitat restoration initiatives are recommended to monitor population trends and mitigate further habitat loss.\n\nBlue Snake’s Conservation Efforts\n\nEfforts to protect the blue racer include the establishment of provincial nature reserves and land trusts to safeguard prime habitats on Pelee Island. Population estimate surveys and restoration techniques led by researchers, such as Ryan Wolfe at the University of Toronto, aim to understand and manage land effectively for the blue racer population.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlue Racers play a crucial role in the ecosystem as both predators and prey, maintaining a balance in their habitat. The endangered status of the Blue Racer Snake reflects broader challenges faced by reptiles and amphibians globally. Furthermore, it highlights the current biodiversity crisis especially affecting reptiles and amphibians; species that are not as popular as mammals like whales and Rhinos.\n\nRyan Wolfe’s study not only contributes to our understanding of the Blue Racer population but also emphasizes the urgent need for conservation measures to ensure the survival of this keystone species.\n\nLastly, less-known species must gain popularity within conservation efforts, the Blue Racer Snake isn’t even assessed by the IUCN Red List, showcasing how behind this species is. Increased public awareness, habitat protection, and research initiatives play crucial roles in ensuring the blue racer’s continued existence. By actively engaging in reptile and amphibian conservation, reporting sightings, and supporting relevant organizations, individuals can contribute to the preservation of this unique and important species."
