        "text": "Man, I a bit disappointed that painted versions of Tough Trailer and Pro Truck Racer are not being shown yet. We have seen the unpainted versions for a couple shows now.\n\nI am hoping/estimating that Blue Jet, Shuttle Robo, and Supercar Robo should be out by the end of the 1st quarter of 2017 (March). Considering we got 6 figures in the last half of 2016, a count of one figure a month seems reasonable.\n\nI can't wait for these to come out.\n\nGotta say, every figure I have seen looks great, but the size is a bummer. I have Tank and Leader-1 and love them both. May even grab Turbo and Loco, but I think I am only really going to be in on the larger characters... Tough trailer, maybe the duobot...\n\nJettranser?\n\nI was just reading up on the bizarre French dub of Revenge of Cronos, where they basically tried to sell the series as a sequel to Challenge of the GoBots. I know that Rom and Reina were renamed and voiced by the French voices for Nick and AJ. Then I learned that Triple Jim was renamed and voiced to be Turbo (called Proto), but what I only recently learned was the Blue Jet was Leader-1 (called Leader), and voice by the voice actor of Leader-1 in France, and Rod Drill was called Vrille, but voiced by the actor who played SCOOTER in France. Was the implication that Vrille was an adult version of Scooter? In France, is this picture is a picture of Scooter, Turbo and Leader-1?! Mind blown!\n\nâ€‹\n\nSee, if there was ever proof Action Toys should make a Triple Jim, the fact that it costs about $1000 for a good condition one on ebay would be it.\n\nLook at this on eBay MACHINE ROBO TRIPLE JIM BANDAI JAPAN RARE COMPLETE NEAR MINT 1986 | eBay\n\nThe item has already been re-listed once and no one bought Triple Jim for $1000. Even though there have not been any sold on e-bay recently, it is hard to gauge how much someone would pay for Triple Jim in near mint condition. If the seller really wants to sell the item, it should have been listed at $500 starting price. I have yet to see any hard to find MR items sell for over $400/$500 on e-bay.\n\nOnce you see one sell for a price, you let me know what is was. Thanks!\n\nIn the meantime, the point is, HE IS EXPENSIVE."
