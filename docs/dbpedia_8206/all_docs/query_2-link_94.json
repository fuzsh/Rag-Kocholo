On 19 May 1931 Ford Motor Company, 3674 Schaefer Road, Dearborn, Michigan registered this car with the State of Michigan Motor Vehicle Bureau. The reason for this is unknown. It was believed that Henry Ford intended to keep the car for his museum, but the car disappeared and its history remains unknown until it was discovered in suburban Detroit in 1992."
