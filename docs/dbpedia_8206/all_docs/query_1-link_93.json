        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nGENERAL COMMENTARY\n\nTITLE COMMENTARY\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nAmerican novelist, editor, and author of young adult novels, juvenile novels, and picture books.\n\nThe following entry presents an overview of Voigt's career through 2006. For further information on her life and career, see CLR, Volumes 13 and 48.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA versatile author who targets readers from pre-schoolers to adults, Voigt is a multiple award-winner whose novels recognize strong female protagonists and dysfunctional family relationships. Voigt is perhaps best known for her \"Tillerman\" novels, a seven-book series that explores the difficult adolescence of the four Tillerman children after their abandonment by their mother and adoption by their grandmother in rural Maryland. The second book in the series, Dicey's Song (1982), won the Newbery Medal, American children's literature highest honor, with A Solitary Blue (1983) earning a further Newbery Honor citation. Able to cross between varieties of genre and audience with equal grace and sophistication, Voigt and her diverse canon of fantasy, realism, and picture books display a similarly unconventional narrative perspective that defines the author's style and voice.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nVoigt was born on February 25, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Frederick and Elise Irving. The second of five children, she was raised in rural Connecticut, where, like many future authors, she developed an early interest in reading. After graduating from Dana High School in Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1959 with distinction, Voigt began attending the prestigious Smith College, one of the seven so-called \"Seven Sisters\" of women's colleges in the Northeast. It was at Smith that she began to consider writing as a potential career. Following her graduation in 1963, Voigt took a job with the J. Walter Thompson Advertising Agency in New York. She was married in 1964 and moved to New Mexico with her new spouse, where she earned a teacher's certificate from St. Michael's College in Santa Fe. The couple eventually moved back to the East Coast, and Voigt spent the next few years working as an English teacher in various Maryland schools before her eventual divorce from her first husband in 1972. During this period, her experience with children began to re-inspire her earlier aspirations for a writing career, albeit with this new audience in mind. While teaching at the Key School in Annapolis, with her divorce finalized, she began a relationship with Walter Voigt, a Latin and Greek teacher at Key, whom she married in 1974. Voigt's pregnancy with her first child, Peter, provided her with additional time away from work to dedicate to writing, efforts which resulted in drafts of several of her early novels, including Tell Me If the Lovers Are Losers (1982) and The Callender Papers (1983). Selected for printing as an unsolicited manuscript, Voigt's first young adult novel, Homecoming (1981), earned strong critical reviews and an American Book Award nomination. The Newbery Medal for Dicey's Song and Newbery Honors for A Solitary Blue quickly followed, allowing her a rapid ascent within children's literature. Despite this impressive early success, she continued to work part-time as a department chair and English teacher at the Key School until 1988, when she left to dedicate herself full time to writing. Now living in Maine with her husband, she continues to write, releasing on average a book a year.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nWhile Voigt has successfully written for a variety of audiences, including picture books for new readers like The Rosie Stories (2003), middle school novels like her \"Bad Girls\" series, and mature works for college readers and adults—such as Tell Me If the Lovers Are Losers and Glass Mountain (1991), respectively—Voigt's reputation is primarily based upon her young adult novels in the \"Tillerman Family\" and \"The Kingdom\" series. Voigt's approach to these works is unconventional in its utilization of an unsentimental narrative stream that defies normative conventions of young adult literature. Shying away from such standard themes of adolescent maturation as sexual development, body imagery, and religious faith, she focuses instead upon character development, particularly in the \"Tillerman Family\" series which dedicates itself to the establishment and evolution of not just Dicey Tillerman and her three siblings, but also upon the creation of both a distinct three-generation family and their surrounding community throughout the seven books. While each book offers an individual flashpoint in emotional growth, the series itself is meant to be a continually evolving canvas, one that Victor Watson has asserted presents maturation as \"a serial process; it is never a straightforward transformation into a new and better state, and it rarely occurs as a single moment of breakthrough … but [the characters'] real maturation is a slow unending achievement of small reality truths, one of which is that the only constant is change, that maturation is forever happening.\" Homecoming, Dicey's Song, Sons from Afar (1987), and Seventeen against the Dealer (1989) deal directly with the Tillerman children, with the other three novels establishing a community structure for them. The Runner (1985) offers insight into the familial history of the Tillermans through the lens of their deceased uncle Samuel \"Bullet\" Tillerman, while A Solitary Blue and Come a Stranger (1986) each create back stories and sharply defined characterizations of Dicey's best friends, Jeff and Mina, respectively. In Homecoming, Voigt introduces the four Tillerman children: thirteen-year-old Dicey and her three younger siblings, James, Maybeth, and Sammy. Living in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the family is in a desperate state that is only worsened when their mother loses her job at the supermarket. Deciding to take the children to live with their Aunt Cilla in Connecticut, their mother disappears along the way, leaving the children to fend for themselves and find their own home. Essentially a road novel, the book traces the children's difficult journey, much of which traces Voigt's own path through Massachusetts, Connecticut, and rural Maryland. While the story has a happy ending—with the Tillerman kids breaking through the emotional wall their grandmother Abigail had put up, thus enabling them to live permanently with her—it proves to be just a smaller step along the way towards exploring larger emotional pathways. The other books similarly chart such breakthroughs: Dicey's Song details Dicey's farewell to her dying mother in a state hospital whereas Sons from Afar deals with the younger boys' reconciliation with the absence of their father from their lives. Even Seventeen against the Dealer, which proffers to present a resolution of sorts, is incomplete, suggesting that emotional resolution is an ongoing process, taken in steps throughout life.\n\nVoigt's other novels are similarly questioning of the roles of family, place, and love in a child's emotional maturation. Despite utilizing a broad variety of genres, including mystery in The Vandemark Mummy (1991) and The Callender Papers, historical fiction in Tree by Leaf (1988) and David and Jonathan (1992), and historical romance in \"The Kingdom\" series, Voigt is nonetheless able to connect larger themes of absentee parents, personal loyalty, and independence within each genre's particular frameworks without undermining story cohesiveness. Indeed, Voigt often borrows from classic archetypes, using mythological antecedents to outline storylines and recall the great works of literature. Critics have suggested Odyssean overtones in the journey of Dicey and her siblings in Homecoming, with Gloria Jameson recalling Promethean and Oedipal patterns in other works of the \"Tillerman\" series. Voigt also regularly infuses her works with the words of the great poets—lines from Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Requiem,\" A. E. Housman's \"To An Athlete Dying Young,\" and the verses of Sappho inspire the protagonists of Homecoming, The Runner, and The Vandemark Mummy, respectively. This interest in explorations of divergent pathways is further examined in her historical romance series, \"The Kingdom.\" Set within an alternate medieval universe, the series blends fantasy and romance genres with feminist perspectives. Each book traces the footsteps of a juvenile protagonist as she frees herself from the established conventions of a fixed society to trail-blaze new mindsets that ultimately enable her personal happiness. With a complex genealogical map interconnecting the characters, the books are set over the space of decades and feature characters with names evolved from that of the first story's original swashbuckling heroine, Burl. Three of the novels—Jackaroo (1985), On Fortune's Wheel (1990), and Elske (1999)—utilize the adolescent female narratives of Burl, Birle, and Elske to demonstrate their evolution from naïve, unquestioning girls to that of independent women with markedly feminist views of society. While The Wings of a Falcon (1993) is principally the story of an adolescent boy, it nonetheless maintains the series' expression of transient roles in an oppressive social structure. Distinct from Voigt's other works, \"The Kingdom\" books highlight the potential power of women within even a traditional medieval society, where, by story's end, the female protagonists are able to greet men on their own terms and where value is found in work, intelligence, and fortitude rather than in the shadow of a man. While the books are atypical for Voigt in their depictions of violence, death, and sexual undertones, nonetheless, their questioning spirit recalls aspects of the \"Tillerman Family\" series as well as much of Voigt's larger canon for children.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nIn her twenty-five year career, Voigt has been the recipient of an impressive list of accolades, including her presentation with both the Newbery Medal and Newbery Honor citations. In addition to those honors, The Callender Papers won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best juvenile mystery, Homecoming was a finalist for an American Book Award, and, in 1989, she was presented with the ALAN Award for her contributions to adolescent literature. The \"Tillerman Family\" series has remained her best known and most critically lauded series of books; Victor Watson has asserted that much of the series' success lies in Voigt's unique narrative patterns which avoid the formulaic pitfalls of adolescent literature. As such, he has argued, the series \"undoubtedly represents characters who mature as their lives proceed, but the usual authorial ways of doing this are stubbornly avoided and the clichés of fictional maturations challenged at every point.\" Further discussing the \"Tillerman\" series, Jaime Hylton has suggested that Voigt's textual strength descends from, in part, a \"richness to her work that transcends topical stories with teen-oriented, identity-focused themes.\" Similarly, Rosanne Donahue has hailed the \"wide variety of images and symbols [Voigt] uses can turn a realistic, everyday happening into something new and wonderful.\" Susan Patron has complimented Voigt's emotional expressions of life in Tree by Leaf, contending that, \"[t]his powerful novel, which sometimes gives the illusion that time is unfolding in the story almost at the rate of real time, reaffirms the redeeming power of love in the face of brutality and hardship.\" Additionally, Suzanne Elizabeth Reid has contended that Voigt's \"The Kingdom\" novels \"are modern in their sensitivity toward questions of equity, while they realistically reflect the physical hardships and the emotional and intellectual constraints of pre-industrial life.\"\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\n\"Tillerman Family\" Series\n\nHomecoming (young adult novel) 1981\n\nDicey's Song (young adult novel) 1982\n\nA Solitary Blue (young adult novel) 1983\n\nThe Runner (young adult novel) 1985\n\nCome a Stranger (young adult novel) 1986\n\nSons from Afar (young adult novel) 1987\n\nSeventeen against the Dealer (young adult novel) 1989\n\n\"The Kingdom\" Series\n\nJackaroo (young adult novel) 1985\n\nOn Fortune's Wheel (young adult novel) 1990\n\nThe Wings of a Falcon (young adult novel) 1993\n\nElske (young adult novel) 1999\n\n\"Bad Girls\" Series\n\nThe Bad Girls (juvenile novel) 1996\n\nBad, Badder, Baddest (juvenile novel) 1997\n\nIt's Not Easy Being Bad (juvenile novel) 2000\n\nBad Girls in Love (juvenile novel) 2002\n\nBad Girls, Bad Girls: Whatcha Gonna Do?

Gwyn plays the \"swashbuckling female,\"1 in a fast-paced tale of a well-meaning young girl who rides as Jackaroo to help the poor. Birle mixes her fortune with that of her romantic ideal, the handsome prince Orien, until she too attains royal status and power. Griff and Oriel escape from absolute tyranny and brutal conditions and finally become contenders for the title of Earl. In all three, the protagonists stride out to shape their destinies, seeking power in a world where most are disempowered and encountering life-threatening dangers with courage and intelligence. In their quest for heroic power, each is supported by a loyal friend who shares their adventures and helps further their quest for power. It is the faithful devotion of these companions that mitigates the accidents of fortune's wheel and provides a source of wisdom, advice, and comfort. Voigt's protagonists mature as they recognize the limitations of seeking power alone and learn the value of sharing their lives with others.\n\nThese three interrelated novels are set in a medieval feudal era before photography, painting, and even writing could record the daily events and scenery that shaped the development of our modern culture. Voigt writes from within the minds of her central characters, chronicling their reactions to the events and people they meet and examining the formation of their motivations; the reader vicariously feels their fear, knows their discomforts, and realizes the extent of their courage and commitment to their friends. The history Voigt has imagined occurs in a northern European land bounded by snowy mountains and deep forests with rocky harbors toward the south. The language sounds Scandinavian, more like Old English than modern German, and the people value obedience, justice, and hard work. Most are peasants who eat the turnips, onions, and potatoes they grow in summer, the meat and milk of goats, and the fish they catch in the rivers flowing from the mountains into their valleys. They dress in hooded clothes of woven wool and leather, unless they are gentlefolk, who sometimes dress in silk. Voigt vividly depicts the \"limited diet, the limited worldview, the chasm between lords and common folk [as well as] the joyful release of a feast day.\"2 Voigt's heroes in this medieval world, having discovered an escape from the routines dictated by their social environment, practice extraordinary courage and intelligence to win the right to make their own choices. In each case, the protagonist hero finds that his or her destiny is linked to the generosity of a deeply loyal friend who shares the risks as well as the excitement of the hero's path toward a life of greater freedom.\n\nThe people in the Kingdom, where this trilogy begins, are governed by a monarch who names two earls. Hildebrand rules the foothills at the northern border of the kingdom under the sign of the Bear, and the Earl of Sutherland the southern forests under the sign of the Falcon. Each earl is served by three lords whose bailiffs collect tithes and taxes to support the soldiers who keep the forests free of thieves and marauders.\n\nJackaroo (1985)\n\nThis novel [Jackaroo ] begins at a time when food is scarce and the forests are unsafe. Several sons vie for the title of the Earl of Sutherland, and his lords and their bailiffs have become unruly and greedy because of the confusion that surrounds their leader. Every fortnight the peasants wait like cattle in the Doling Room to receive a basket of food to keep them alive during the winter. Ashamed and angered by the cloak of fear in which the other women huddle, Gwyn, the Innkeeper's daughter, tries to alleviate that fear by helping those less fortunate. \"Evil would be done, that was the nature of the world; that was bearable if good could also be done.\"3 Though her first efforts seem discouragingly ineffectual, fate soon gives her the means to practice a more dramatic heroism.\n\nWhen she and Burl, her father's servant, are asked to lead a lordly map-maker and his young son away from the village to survey the outlying lands, they are separated by a winter storm. Snowbound in a remote cottage, she cares for the young Lordling Gaderian, and he, bored into breaking the conventions that keep a lord from talking to his people except to announce and to order, reveals his identity: his father is Earl of Sutherland and he is heir to the title. Gaderian and Gwyn trade stories about their families and customs, teaching each other about the differences between the lords and the common people. He also teaches her to read and write, illicit skills for a commoner. While cleaning out a closet of the cottage, Gwyn finds the blue silk costume, the high leather boots, and the plumed hat and mask of the mythical Jackaroo, a secret she keeps to herself. This legendary outlaw, who like Robin Hood challenged the rich and the powerful and promoted the cause of the poor, avoided capture by using the mask, the costume, and the loyalty of the people, honoring the hero who gave them hope and self-respect. \"Jackaroo could fight as a trained soldier…. He could ride a horse like a Lord: and he had the knowledge of letters which only the Lords held\" (26). The rumors had some seed of truth, and this knowledge gives Gwyn courage.\n\nWhen Gwyn and the Lordling return to the inn, she runs ahead to greet her family. She has cared for Gaderian well, keeping him warm and fed and soothing his terrifying nightmares, but now he is not with her, still playing the game of hide-and-seek the two had started on the long walk back. Assuming that his heir has come to harm, the Earl of Sutherland draws his sword and holds it to Gwyn's throat. Fear silences her and also her parents, who do nothing to save her from certain death. Only Burl speaks up on her behalf, just as Gaderian runs from his hiding place, turning his father's threat into apology. But Gwyn has learned how alone and vulnerable she is; her family has failed to come to her rescue, and she discounts the intervention of Burl, who is only a servant. The lord rewards both her and Burl for their services with purses of twenty gold coins and a promise of his loyalty, but this boon does not assuage her bitterness. Even more than before, she feels estranged from the social conventions that allow the rich lords to oppress the commoners. She decides that she will wear a mask of obedience and compliance, but will not submit in spirit. Soon after, when her father refuses to help the Fiddler, who is too poor to pay the newly established tax, Gwyn returns secretly to the cabin and, donning the costume of Jackaroo, walks out to the Fiddler's cabin and gives him one of her coins. The deed gives her the pleasure of seeing his relief and of hearing him tell the story of Jackaroo's generosity at the inn.\n\nAt the annual spring fair, Gwyn feels that she alone notices the misery underlying the celebration and questions the injustices of her feudal society. Seeing the body of a man hanged for his quick temper, she decides that \"if there was one of these young men who also saw the hanged man, then that one she might take\" (181). But she does not hear any man speak of it. She tells her father to announce at the fair that she will not marry, preferring the difficult life of a single woman to the subordination of her work to a husband.\n\nAgain she rides as Jackaroo, donating another of her coins to the poverty-stricken Am and then rescuing and delivering an orphaned infant to her sister who grieves the death of her first son. Dressed up as Jackaroo, she feels powerful: \"in the disguise, she was free to do what she really wanted to do, much freer than was Gwyn, the Innkeeper's daughter\" (196). When her father offers her a chance to reconsider marriage, she refuses: \"She had made her choice and would abide by it. She had put on Jackaroo's mask and worn his clothes. She had become him and he had become her…. Others might try to impose their ways on her, but now they could not move her any more than the winds\" (216). Encouraged by the steel in her voice, her father offers to make her heir to the Inn, but she refuses this as well. She realizes, with a start, that in defying convention to name a daughter as heir, her father is indicating great respect for her abilities and character.\n\nBut even in the guise of Jackaroo, her strength is limited. When she gives Am gold to pay his taxes, his boasting at the tavern about his newfound wealth, enormously exaggerated, instigates a violent robbery. Gwyn still does not have the power to overturn injustice, \"because ride as she might, all the days and nights of her life, she could never do all that might be done. The Kingdom was too large\" (213).\n\nMoreover, as she assumes the traditionally heroic qualities of the mask she wears, Gwyn is losing her own identity. What started as deeds of empathy and caring now turn to a desire for vengeance toward the three thieves who have robbed and killed defenseless villagers. She uses the power of Jackaroo's persona to force the earl's proud steward to find and punish these men, taking his ring as a pledge, promising to return it when the thieves have been brought to justice. When her Uncle Win, who had also ridden as Jackaroo and who was about to be hanged as an outlaw, warns her, \"what changes putting on the mask had begun, I had myself finished\" (233), she recognizes the truth for herself. Her life is no longer her own: \"Jackaroo rode outside of the law and that was why the Lords wanted to take him. The law could not hold Jackaroo. He would do what he wanted and that made him an outlaw. She hadn't chosen that, she had only chosen to do what good she could, for the people…. She had not known what she was choosing\" (234). It is too late to escape. The steward appears in public with the three thieves he has caught, hoping to catch the man who rides as Jackaroo as he fulfills his pledge. Gwyn, invisible to him in her usual female garb, returns the ring by tossing it to his feet from the crowd. Embarrassed and confused, the steward accuses Cam, who is standing near Gwyn and whose foolish, scornful smirk makes him appear guilty.\n\nShocked at her own growing boldness and at the consequences of her actions, which increasingly endanger the people around her, Gwyn nevertheless rides again as Jackaroo to rescue Cam, whom she had once admired but now sees as weak. Attacked by soldiers waiting to capture the rebellious Jackaroo, her leg is badly slashed and she barely manages to crawl to a hiding place. Again Burl, whose gentle demeanor and lowly status have made him invisible to her, rescues her as in several previous incidents in the novel. By taking on the romantic and proud role of Jackaroo, Gwyn has lost the chance to inherit the Inn and even her privileged role as Innkeeper's daughter.\n\nCrippled by her injury and with no public identity nor viable social role, Gwyn tries to imagine ways to survive independently. Burl encourages her to use her mind: \"You're not a foolish girl, Gwyn; you've got a good head, better than most. Use it\" (268). Finally she is rescued by the timely appearance of the young lord, who, reading her written message, convinces his father to let her travel with Burl under royal protection. In gratitude for Burl's care during the snowstorm and the quiet loyalty he has demonstrated since, the earl presents him with a farm and his freedom. Burl offers to marry Gwyn and she, finally recognizing his kind concern for others and gentle strength, gratefully agrees. They will use their knowledge and skills to establish an inn Gwyn has already named The Falcon's Wing. \"But,\" warns Burl, \"there will be no more Jackarooing about for you, lass\" (287), and she, realizing how close she had come to death and defeat, agrees.\n\nIn this novel, Voigt creates a character who does not like the choices her society offers her: \"Her life did not belong to her…. Were she to wed, her life would belong to the man she married. Were she to say no, her labor would belong to Tad [her younger brother] at the Inn, and she would become the Inn-keeper's unmarried daughter, until she was too cumbersome or too old to work there\" (96). Gwyn takes on the costume of the male Jackaroo so she can have the power to make her own choice, a power usually available only to a man. Is she \"too blatantly symbolic of feminism in an era when women were really downtrodden,\"4 or is she merely using what fate provides to try to improve the world? She finds that men, lords, and even the legendary Jackaroo serve others \"within the turning of [fortune's] wheel\" (249), which limits them in their choices. What suits Gwyn is not taking on another identity, nor flaunting her power from outside the law, nor living autonomously unfettered by family; what suits her is to fulfill her own identity in partnership with a man who is equally strong and independent, and equally caring too. What has made her heroic is her courageous attempt to care for others and her recognition, finally, of the quiet heroism of Burl, the servant who has continually supported her.\n\nFew readers are likely \"to be astonished at this late blooming love affair,\"5 for Burl has kept her secrets, guarded her steps, and shared her sympathies. He is, in fact, the man whom she imagined she could marry at the Spring Fair, for he too had noted the injustices underlying the superficial gaiety. It is the discretion and kindness of Burl and Gwyn to the Earl of Sutherland and his son, rather than Jackaroo's impetuous forays, that have earned them an Inn at the southern edge of the Kingdom, where both can live and work free from the rivalries of the lords and their bailiffs. Critics generally have reacted well to this novel, appreciating the spirited courage of Gwyn and the steady gentleness of Burl.\n\nOn Fortune's Wheel (1990)\n\nA generation later, Birle, \"feisty and free-spirited like her grandmother,\"6 Gwyn, serves at the Inn [in On Fortune's Wheel ]. But while Gwyn wanted power to ameliorate injustices toward the poor and scorned to give the power of her work to a husband, Birle has attempted to use marriage to escape work and the poverty of her own family. She has promised to marry Muir, a rough-mannered huntsman who called her pretty and proposed to her. While Gwyn seeks romantic adventures to empower her, Birle pursues the Cinderella fantasy of escaping through romantic love. Like Gwyn, Birle precipitously grabs the first opportunity fate offers; she follows an intruder who is stealing her father's boat. When she faces the thief for the first time in daylight and sees \"his smile [light] up the morning as the rising sun does …, Birle thought she understood everything about her self that she had never understood before.\"7 She is in love, and happy to follow this lordly stranger to wherever he will lead.\n\nBut Orien has no idea where he is going. The eldest son and heir of the present Earl of Sutherland, he is the grandson of Gaderian, who ruled conscientiously for the good of the people, a sensitivity garnered from his long talks with Gwyn during their snowbound time in the cottage. Since Gaderian has grown old and Orien's father has just been murdered, Orien is fleeing the kingdom because he fears the political unrest that will follow and because he knows that the land will be better served by his younger brother, Gladaegal, a stronger man than he and more suitable to protect the people.\n\nWith Birle, Orien travels down the river beyond the safety of the Kingdom to the seaport, where law is merely the whim of the strongest army. Birle's knowledge of the river and the woods guides the first part of their journey, and her experience with butchering enables her to kill a dog that attacks them. When a storm drives them past the port and rough waves hurl them onto a rocky beach surrounded by unsurmountable cliffs, they are trapped without food or water for eight days. Like Gwyn and Gaderian, who learned about each other when they were snowbound, Orien and Birle trade information about their respective lives, Birle explaining how the peasants survive and Orien the expectations of court life. Their exchange engenders a mutual respect for the complexity of living that underlies the customs of both peasant and lord. On the face of a rock cliff, Orien carves their names, misspelling Birle as Beryl and neglecting to finish the \"n\" on his own name, inadvertently providing a name for Voigt's next medieval hero in The Wings of a Falcon and thus linking himself to a future Earl of Sutherland.\n\nAfter eight days the two are rescued by slave traders. Now Orien looks nothing like a lord, the shipwreck having reduced him to a shaggy skeleton without any evidence of his birthright. As a young woman, Birle has more value to the pirates. Orien tries to argue them out of danger, but it is Birle's kindness to the giant Yul that saves them from further harm.\n\nBirle and Yul have the good fortune to be sold to Joaquim, a scholar who cares more about recording his knowledge of herbs than about immediate power and authority, and who allows them to roam the city with relative freedom. Birle's ability to read and write, learned secretly and illicitly from her grandparents and originally feared by her as burdensome knowledge, now gives her access to useful information and thus the ability to survive. As Joaquim's amanuensis, she copies formulas and alchemy books to fulfill the orders of his brother, the all-powerful Corbel, and she catalogs herbs to preserve her master's knowledge. Though separated from her beloved Orien and enslaved, Birle finds the neverending toil a relief rather than a burden: \"Work had the power to distract, and distraction eased her heart\" (166); \"Work was a way of forgetting\" (170). As she becomes more adept at identifying the herbs and writing down her newfound knowledge, the girl who had run away from the endless cycle of work-filled days at the Inn now begins to enjoy \"the pleasure of a task her hands had done, and done well\" (173). She begins to take pride in her accomplishments, even if they are done at the behest of a master who owns her: \"As she sat at the table, carefully forming the letters and the lines of words, she could feel her spirit grow quiet. Aye, and why shouldn't she be proud of the pages she had written so flawlessly\" (184).\n\nWhile she learns the worth of work, she loses the clarity of her romantic attachment to Orien, whose enslavement has not been easy on him. She sees him in the market, cowed and disheveled.\n\nThe joy of seeing Orien was a pain as sharp and bright as a knife. How could he have allowed himself to become what she had seen? It was all luck, she knew, and she knew also that her own luck had been good. But that didn't ease her. She wished she could forget the slave she had seen, and remember only the young Lord she had followed…. Hadn't he, she asked herself angrily, run away rather than be what he must be? He ought to have stayed where he was, to be Earl.\n\n(173)\n\nNot until she is in danger herself does she fully understand \"how many such moments had bowed him down … [and that] it was a wonderful thing that he could still lift his head to smile at her, helpless across a crowd of people\" (178). To survive and be able to make choices, not only are work and skill necessary, but also the courage that comes from having a loyal friend. Orien can survive his unlucky turn of \"fortune's wheel\" because he sustains the hope that Birle will be able to help him.\n\nAgainst almost impossible odds, Orien escapes from the mines where he has been branded and starved, and appears in Joaquim's backyard. Meanwhile, Joaquim prepares to flee the city, which is being invaded by the father of Celinde, a ten-year-old princess whom Corbel, the city's ruler, has stolen to be his bride and to legitimize his reign. In the ensuing confusion, Birle and Yul escape to the forest with the nearly dead Orien, heading north, back toward the Kingdom on the other side of the mountains. But first they are captured by Damall, a showman who will figure prominently in Voigt's next tale of adventure. Damall agrees to allow Birle and Orien to continue their journey if the giant Yul will work for him until one of them returns with a ransom.\n\nBirle settles with Orien in a secluded glade, where she nurses him back to health. During this idyllic time the gentle summer sustains them, and their isolation gives them the peace to know each other again. When Orien asks Birle to lie with him as wife, she reminds him of their social inequality. But he reverses the meaning of her words to imply that she has been the \"superior\" despite his noble status: \"Aye, there is, and ever has been. You gave me your heart and I gave you nothing in return, so now I give you mine—and we are equal.\" Birle sees in him \"the hunger she had learned to fear\" from other men, \"but it was also longing … and she was not surprised to find in herself a hunger that matched his\" (240-41). They lie together as man and woman in a love that is mature because they are equally committed to each other and equally experienced in knowledge of the ways that life can be hard. Now Orien knows what it is to have one's work be owned by someone else, and Birle knows the pleasure of working with her mind.\n\nWhen they finally reach the Kingdom, where Orien is recognized as the next Earl, Birle lives in luxury far beyond what she had ever dreamed about as a child. She enjoys material wealth and the love of her handsome lord, and awaits the birth of their child, but she is not content. She has no work. Birle explains her disquietude to the old earl and his lady: \"Among the people, a man and his wife are both necessary to the well-being of the house. I can't change myself into a Lady … who live[s] apart, even wife from husband\" (264-65). Reluctantly understanding her desire to choose how she and her child will spend their days, they grant her permission to leave the castle and provide her with a farm.\n\nBirle leaves without telling Orien and establishes herself on the land with the help of only her stepmother, Nan, who still cannot understand Birle's desire for independence. Birle knows that she can work without a man's help and that she can think for herself. Yet, when her child is born, she wants to give her \"from Orien, his way of doubting, to ask questions when everyone said something must be so\" (278), a habit of questioning that is now her way too.\n\nOn Fortune's Wheel is a feminist romance, a feminist wish-fulfillment. At the outset Birle is rescued by a handsome prince from a stepmother who treats her like a servant and a father too distant and weak to care. She soon finds that even the handsome Orien cannot protect her from the harsher evils of the wider world. She must learn to rescue herself, not with physical beauty but with strength and skill and courage. In the end she has it all on her own terms. Birle, even more than Gwyn or Dicey, embodies the feminist who wants to do her own work as well as to love. Having outgrown her adolescent dreams of a life without labor, Birle has her own farm and the freedom to choose her own work. But this is also a romance where hero and heroine are reunited. Orien has followed her and wants to live with her, earning his living as a puppeteer, telling stories to the village-folk.\n\nOrien stood before her with their life in his hands to give her, and Birle—as contrary as Nan said—could only think of herself. What of her own life? What of her own work? … Must she give that up? Birle could have laughed at herself. She had gone beyond a place where the world could tell her must. Aye, and they both had. Whatever Orien's work, she would grow the herbs and prepare the medicines, she would be herself and his wife too, and the mother to Lyss and whatever other children they had. She would be each of these, in the same way that Orien would be each of his puppets…. Her life was in her own hands.\n\n(287)\n\nOrien, a traditional hero figure, could not have survived without the knowledge and skill of Birle. Now, committed to a life that will allow both him and Birle to choose their own work, he gives up the power that is legally his because he knows his brother Gladaegal will rule with more skill. And loyal to the promise they have made to Yul, he has traveled back to the city below the Kingdom and bought him back from Damall.\n\nSeveral critics praise this adventure for its drama and its realistic depiction of slavery's degradation.8 But the critic Victor Watson believes that Dicey, for one, would not have the patience to drag though this lengthy saga, which hints at political unrest and war but never explains its causes.9 Another critic, Roger Sutton, sees no virtue in Orien but his bellflower eyes: \"Dicey would have drowned him.\"10 But Voigt raises significant questions about the complexity of power, both personal and political, that she wants the reader to ponder rather than answer herself, and Orien is a real human being who is thoughtful enough to know that the privilege of political power is bought with terrible responsibilities; he knows that he himself does not have the personal strength to handle power well. Indeed, the third historical fantasy of this series focuses on the differences between power attained through fear and power maintained by mutual respect and cooperation. Heroes engender their reputation and power by practicing courage, but they earn lasting respect by demonstrating wisdom and respect for others as well.\n\nThe Wings of a Falcon (1993)\n\nOrien has ransomed Yul from Damall for three beryl signets, each emblazoned with the falcon that signi- fies the house of Sutherland. Voigt's third novel of this loosely connected series implies that Damall bought a small island with two of the beryls and began a dynasty of his own, where he raises boys from childhood and, at maturity, sells them back to the slave market. By the time of The Wings of a Falcon, the sixth Damall is a sadistic tyrant who amuses himself by whipping the boys and hearing them scream. The protagonist of this novel arrives at the Damall's Island without even his name, knowing only \"that this man would know how to hurt him.\" His only power is to keep his fear secret. The boy squares his shoulders and decides to be as \"strong as stone.\"11 But he is afraid of the water and of the day when, like all the other boys, he would be dropped from a boat to swim back to shore if he could, or to drown if he could not. Attracted by the determination of this young boy, Griff, another of the Damall's boys, secretly teaches him to swim. The boy becomes a favorite of the others because he laughs and does everything the best: he runs the fastest, swims the farthest, and is handiest with the boats. He becomes the Damall's favorite. Nikol, jealous, tries to cross him whenever he can; he steals the dagger that the Damall has given him. On the other hand, Griff becomes his friend, bathing his wounds and teaching him what he knows of the island's history. The boy, sensing the danger of Nikol's jealousy, tries to protect Griff by keeping their friendship a secret. When the Damall names this nameless boy to be the seventh Damall, making his heart swell with pride and hope, he does not tell even Griff; when the Damall changes his mind and promises to name Nikol, the boy hardens again: \"His heart was a stone fist\" (33).\n\nWhen Nikol accuses Griff of poisoning the stew that has made them all sick, the sixth Damall asks the boy to decide if Nikol is right in his accusation. This is a test, and the prize is the power that has made his heart swell, beyond its usual stone center: \"He didn't like his choices…. If he denied his own belief in Griff, then he would have purchased his right to rule the island by the betrayal of the one person in the world he trusted. If he acted as he believed, then he would lose his inheritance\" (40). He chooses to support Griff; Nikol attacks him, and the two fight to be named the seventh Damall. Nikol loses, yet the seventh Damall declines to kill him. He knows it is a mistake, but, just as he hates the whipping boxes, he does not want to kill. He is not afraid, \"but what kind of a life was it when you had to kill somebody to keep the place that had been awarded to you? What kind of a world was it where in order to be on top you had to push others under?\" (80). In order to survive, he would have to see things as they really are, clearly and coldly without the soft edges of misplaced trust or hope. But, despite the harshness and distrust he has learned to associate with power, he chooses not to kill.\n\nChoosing to give up his title rather than exercise the cruelty necessary to hold it, the seventh Damall sails from the island, taking only his friend Griff. He finds a cliff with the name Oriel on it and takes it for his own; the name Beryl, chiseled beside it, seems to portend some connection to the name, for he wears the Damall's last beryl in a band wound around his waist. Oriel and Griff sail to the mainland, where they find work together on a farm kept prosperous by the production of salt. There they are content, working together for two years and flirting with Tamara, the Saltweller's daughter. This peaceful life suddenly ends when the savage Wolfers swoop down on the farm. Oriel and Griff try to stave off the attackers, giving Tamara time to escape. Had the two, faster than the young girl, run without concern for her, they might have escaped capture. But when Orien expresses bitterness at his decision, Griff assures him that it was a better choice to save the girl and perhaps the people she warned, even at the expense of their own freedom. Oriel discovers \"that he desired Griff's good opinion, and hoped to keep it…. Griff was like his own hand—and when Griff disagreed with him, Oriel felt as if his own hand, even while it obeyed his wishes, had desires of its own, or ideas of its own. It was like watching his own hand walk away free, on its five fingers, and knowing that he had kept it bound to his wrist to serve his own convenience…. He had used Griff ill. But he had saved Griff too\" (219-20). Oriel is beginning to appreciate Griff, not just for his loyalty but for his moral wisdom.\n\nThe Wolfers are ruthless raiders, killing without hesitation for convenience and loot, showing scorn for any sign of cowardice. Remembering his earlier training, Oriel turns himself to ice, eventually winning the grudging respect of Rulgh, the Wolfer's captain. Oriel can keep himself ice \"against the heat of fires, the heat of blood, the heat of fear and fighting\" (226), but he worries about Griff. Rulgh must never know \"how closely Oriel's strength was bound to Griff's needs\" (227), for that would make them both vulnerable to the man who would cruelly probe that weak spot, just to exercise his power. Without Griff, Oriel might become a Wolfer; Oriel realizes that he could enjoy the \"Wolfer way of blade and fist and fire\" (243) if Griff did not remind him of a gentler way of life. Oriel admires the fearlessness of the Wolfers, their single-minded pursuit of their goal, and even their carelessness of comfort and of life. But the bond to Griff is stronger.\n\nAn avalanche on the mountain to the North toward the Kingdom provides their escape from the Wolfers. Suddenly, after a year, they are free again. They make their way to a small farm at the edge of the Kingdom, the home of a hospitable young woman named Beryl. She is the granddaughter of Orien, who has taught her to work the puppets he has made, and she recognizes the special strength of this young man who bears with him a beryl with the sign of the Falcon on it. After giving her heart to Oriel and taking him to her bed, she tells him the significance of the signet. Now that the Kingdom is searching for a new earl, this beryl seems a sign, just as did the name carved next to Oriel and just as does the name of the young woman. \"It seemed to him that his destiny had always been waiting for him…. He need only to go boldly forward\" (297) and seize the power. Oriel seems to be called forth into another heroic adventure, one that takes him away from Beryl, who has given him her heart.\n\nThe three of them devise a plan to present him before the king and have him sponsored as contestant for the hand of Merlis, daughter of the Earl of Sutherland, and for the title. The plan is successful until Oriel discovers that the tourney must result in the death of one contender. Griff suggests that without death, former contenders can become friends. \"I cannot enter such a contest,\" decides Oriel. \"You fear dying?\" asks one of the lords. \"No,\" Oriel answers, \"I fear killing\" (333). The young boy who turned his heart to stone to become the seventh Damall has learned to value companionship and life more than power. Griff's friendship, Tamara's devotion, and Beryl's love have given him real strength, tempering the fear that made him seem hard and cruel to those he dared not protect. Impressed by Oriel's courage, the king and lords reconsider the rule and change their minds. There will be no killing and the king will sponsor Oriel.\n\nOriel desires the heart of Merlis as well as her hand, but she scorns this stranger who might win power over them all. She has given her heart to Tintage, whose suffering under the heavy hand of his father, Yaegar, has made his heart tender. Caught up in the quest for the power of the earlship, Oriel seems to have forgotten how much he cared for Beryl, who turns out to be the real jewel of the kingdom. Saddened at Merlis's coldness, Oriel knows that \"her perfect lover would win the prize, and then lay it at the lady's feet. He would give to her the governance of her lands, and of her own heart … even though he was the most worthy.\" And he realizes that he is not that perfect lover. \"He would win her, he would take her, willing or no\" (382). Although he will not kill, the competitiveness that has been fostered so long by fear is too strong. He must win, must gain the coveted title. And so he is named Earl of Sutherland by the king.\n\nBut as Merlis puts her hand into his, as she must do by law, Oriel sees the fear and anger in her face, \"like a woman who looks upon her fate with Wolfers\" (390). He has won the title, but he cannot bear to cause the same despair that he himself has finally escaped; he opens his mouth to \"give her life into her own holding\" (390). But in that instant, he is mortally stabbed in the back by Tintage. It is the desperate act of a man whose love is stronger than his courage. Oriel has time only to name Griff as his successor.\n\nDevastated at the loss of his friend, Griff is unwilling to rule, afraid of the dangers Oriel seemed to face without fear, uncertain of the decisions Oriel seemed to make without hesitation. However, for the sake of Oriel and his memory, he forges ahead, seeking the other lords' advice and winning their respect for his own courage as well as for his loyalty to Oriel. Griff's belief in cooperative rule inspires him to set a new precedent in government: an advisory council who will rule by consensus. He wins the heart of Beryl, too, by caring for the child she carries, Oriel's child, for whom Griff will preserve the title. \"And Griff was what Oriel had shown him how to be, and needed him to be, and saved his life to be. Like Beryl, who was his lady, Griff carried on his breast the medallion that marked the house of the Earls Sutherland\" (467). With the inordinate strength that mutual loyalty provides, this partnership of Oriel and Griff has won them freedom from tyranny and the power to begin a new kind of government.\n\nThe power of fear and courage is strong, but the power of partnership is often more effective. Gwyn tries to right the wrongs of her society alone in secret, but she discovers that her deeds increasingly implicate others in a web that grows more complicated with each deed; she can not succeed without the help of Burl and the earl. Orien sets off on a journey alone; if Birle had not insisted on accompanying him, he could never have survived. Oriel and Griff succeed because, understanding the motivations of the people they must serve, they are able to earn their respect and change the rules of power games to their own advantage. Voigt's heroes learn that success depends as much on mutual cooperation as on individual strength, and as much on loyalty as on courage.\n\nIn addition to their common geography and political history, these three novels are linked by patterns of imagery. Voigt alludes to the strength of trees in the three books to characterize her male heroes. In Jackaroo, to Gwyn, Burl feels \"as sturdy and deeply rooted as a tree\" (248). From these roots grows Birle, the hero of On Fortune's Wheel, who thinks that Orien moves \"with the grace of a young tree in a high wind …, straight and strong as a tree\" (35). In Voigt's third book of the series, while Oriel makes himself like stone to fight his fear, \"Griff had the bending strength of a sapling\" (7) and hair \"the color of dry leaves in fall\" (17).\n\nThe more dominant image is that of the beryl which signifies the rule of the Earl of Sutherland. In medieval lapidaries, the beryl protects against peril and defeat, quickening a man's intelligence; it also can be made into a potion that cures diseases of the eyes. The Kyranides, a compendium of medieval medical lore, advises that the beryl be engraved with a crow, a crab, and a cypress.12 Voigt ennobles the crow by changing it into a falcon, and names the hero of her third book Griff, a name loosely related to the German word for \"claw.\" In Jackaroo, the name \"Burl,\" the servant who protects Gwyn and sees the truth behind her masks, refers to the strong and knotted part of wood as well as serving as a rough homonym for the jewel. His name is echoed in his granddaughter Birle, who protects Orien, the nominal Earl of Sutherland in On Fortune's Wheel. In The Wings of a Falcon the jewel itself is worn as an amulet by Oriel, and its name has been given to Beryl, the mother of Oriel's child, the future Earl of Sutherland. In all three books, Voigt gives the name to a character who acts both as a protector as well as a guide, providing clear vision along the path to independence.\n\nWhen Oriel enters the tourney to win the title of earl, he gives the beryl signet to the king to present to the next Earl of Sutherland and promises the mother of his child to Griff. In all three novels, the tree signifies the endurance of the family line, even in the face of peril, and the image of the beryl belongs to the character who protects his or her partner from harm and insures that the house of Sutherland will continue. Voigt's subtle use of this imagery contrasts with the straightforward movement of the plot and the blunt language of her characters.\n\nThe language of Voigt's novels reflects the directness of medieval communication, when words were few and poetic politeness was reserved for the noble, but the moral conscientiousness of the characters is modern. Voigt's heroes judge the rightness of their decisions by standards of justice and fairness. Daring to challenge the status quo, they question the rightness of tradition and custom, striving for the freedom to make their own decisions. They believe in the inherent value of all individuals, regardless of gender, class, or economic level, and they show equal respect for the ideas and possibilities of all persons. Voigt's historical romances are modern in their sensitivity toward these questions of equity, while they realistically reflect the physical hardships and the emotional and intellectual constraints of pre-industrial life. In these fantasies of long ago, Voigt imagines heroes who have courage to question, intelligence to survive, and commitment to maintain loyalty to their friends in an age where most people, peasants and nobility alike, sustain themselves with passive obedience to a customary rut, safe and same. Voigt's heroes cannot change the inevitable turns of fortune's wheels, but they do succeed in modifying their direction.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Mary Burns, Horn Book, March 1986, 210.\n\n2.

London, England: Continuum, 2002.\n\n[In the following essay, Watson asserts that Voigt's seven-novel Tillerman series represents the maturation of its recurring adolescent characters in nontraditional ways.]\n\nSeries Fiction and the Growth of Character\n\nA series of novels provides a writer with space, amplitude and extended opportunities for representing the development of character. If the protagonists are young people emerging from childhood into adulthood, one might expect maturation to be a predominant theme, providing a narrative structure and a fictional process, determined largely by key rites of passage and appropriate moments of inner revelation.\n\nHowever, nothing is quite what it seems in these seven novels. The Tillerman series undoubtedly represents characters who mature as their lives proceed, but the usual authorial ways of doing this are stubbornly avoided and the clichés of fictional maturation challenged at every point.\n\nIt is salutary to consider what the novels do not deal with: there is no sex (love is there, especially between Jeff and Dicey, but characteristically undemonstrative); there is no overt interest in religious faith (except, in passing, with Mina); and there is no psychological analysis. Although the consequences of parenting are everywhere present, the narratives are pre-Freudian. This is surprising, since six of the seven novels are everywhere concerned with the consequences of absent or inadequate parents; and also because it could be argued that (certainly for many other writers) the sharpest indicators of maturation in fiction are sex, religious faith and psychological awareness, providing narrative programmes enabling an author to chart maturation into adult life. Even the more outward signs of Dicey's physical maturation are dealt with only briefly, almost perfunctorily. In fact, the narrative seems almost to be irritated by having to pay any attention at all to such self-evident facts of life: Dicey feels ‘tricked’ into having to wear a bra and ‘go around feeling like a dog with a collar on’.1 Mina Smiths' maturing body is, on the other hand, of central significance in Come a Stranger —but it is not primarily an issue of sexuality but of race. Mina can joke about her physical precociousness but, despite her laughter, her strong and highly co-ordinated body has been a problem throughout her adolescence—but only because white people see it as one.\n\nWolfgang Iser has pointed out that ‘the most effective literary work is one which forces the reader into a new critical awareness of his or her customary codes and expectations’.2 It is not clear what Iser means by ‘effective’ and I do not believe a reader can be ‘forced’ into anything. But his comment does provide a way of understanding Cynthia Voigt's highly complex achievement in the Tillerman novels. This series works by resisting or undermining fictional norms and challenging readers' expectations. For example, another traditional way of representing maturation is to take protagonists through their changing perceptions of their parents, often involving a sense of loss as well as a wisdom (or bitterness) gained. This theme—under the powerful influence of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye—has been especially potent in American fiction. It is rarely far from the surface in the novels of Betsy Byars and, in the work of Paul Zindel, becomes a raw adolescent angst, sometimes comic but often bitter and angry, saved only by the self-mockery of the main sufferer. But in the Tillerman series there can be no confrontation between the generations because the parents are not there. Indeed, Voigt has transformed this rather threadbare theme by making both parents into an absence—everywhere felt but nowhere known.\n\nThe series comprises seven novels, the first published in the USA in 1981 and the rest issued at roughly yearly intervals until 1989. They are not a straightforward family chronicle: the first two follow the adventures of the four Tillerman children as they seek a new home and eventually settle in it with their grandmother. The third, A Solitary Blue, introduces a new character, quite unrelated to the Tillermans until he meets Dicey about two-thirds of the way through. The Runner returns to the Tillerman family, but a generation earlier; it is an historical novel set in the 1960s. The fifth in the series moves to yet another central protagonist, Mina Smiths, though the link with the Tillermans is again eventually established when Mina befriends Dicey at school, picking up on an episode from Dicey's Song. 3Sons from Afar returns to the Tillerman family, focusing upon Dicey's younger brothers, and the last novel, Seventeen against the Dealer, completes the series by locating itself almost totally in Dicey's mind.\n\nThe sequence outwits the serial nature of series fiction. Despite the linearity of narrative, the Tillerman series is circular, expansive and inclusive. Its authorial attention circles around a particular group of people, back in time, and out into other families and communities. But Dicey remains the centre; the series begins with her and returns to her at the end.\n\nIn Homecoming (1981) the reader is placed alongside Dicey, viewing and understanding the USA through Dicey's developing perceptions. This is a road novel, in which the growth of the traveller is inseparable from the road travelled. Here, movement does not always mean progress but it does always involve meetings with strange people—eccentric, kind, wicked or violent. Dicey's maturation is not simply a matter of observing these people and learning lessons about the USA; she is forced to become the USA—capitalist, opportunistic, courageous, worried and sharp witted, a pragmatist defining her family group against the difficulties of survival. Already the attentive reader is being invited to refine popular notions of maturation: the growth of the character is inseparable from the way the community is perceived and lived in; it does not only take place within the community but on its terms. The entire Tillerman series can be seen as a sustained analysis of the effects of the ‘American Dream’ as it exerts its shaping power over the tenderest and most private parts of the human psyche.\n\nJourneying has a special significance in the American novel and fictional groups of pioneering travellers seeking to find somewhere to settle have an honoured place in its history. The road novel becomes a novel not only of American life but also of the pioneering psyche—the willingness to travel to uncertain destinations, to tolerate arrival as an ambiguous and insecure achievement, and to expect further demands if survival is to be achieved. Homecoming is also a sailing novel—but obliquely. Dicey's understanding of herself accepts that she needs to be by the sea and that she takes great pleasure in the idea of sailing. At one point she rhapsodizes about its pleasures and speculates that ‘maybe life was like a sea, and all the people were like boats’.4 And, at the end of the novel, the fact of having a home becomes, for her, associated with repairing the boat she has found there and perhaps sailing it. But there is something odd here: sailing is for Dicey a frequent metaphor for life, providing an alternative conceptual mode to both the linear journeys by road and the fixity of having a home. And yet (apart from some dutiful in-shore fishing trips) there is no true sailing anywhere in the series. Boats and boat restoration are for her—and for Jeff in A Solitary Blue —a matter of refuge and recovery; building them, as we later learn in Seventeen against the Dealer, is problematical and dangerous. But sailing them does not happen—perhaps because it would unconsciously seem like an endorsement of the irresponsibility of the world-travelling absentee father.\n\nThe differences between road travel and sea travel frequently occupy Dicey's thoughts, but she remains puzzled and the issue remains unresolved. Readers are not allowed to believe that maturation involves a simple progression from one point along the road to a different one further on; nor are there given any straightforward answers. In the Tillerman series maturity is never an achieved state and never a straightforward binary shift. It can be manifest only in unending movement, a meaning defined in an often meaningless flux, with unpredictable outcomes and incomprehensible origins. There is no point at which a character can sit back and say: ‘I have achieved maturity.’ The grandmother is an illustration of this, and she admits it. An exception, though, is the doomed Bullet in The Runner, whose fate befalls him partly because of the time he lived in and partly because he is convinced that he has already done his maturing and the rest of the world has still to catch up.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe experience of reading the series is decisively a matter of how the reader reacts to the author's distinctive language. The style of the first novel, Homecoming, is compact and uncompromising, for the most part representing Dicey's perceptions as indistinguishable from the narrator's.\n\nDicey knew her sister could read and do sums, but Maybeth always sat quiet around strangers. For Maybeth, everyone in the world was a stranger, except Momma and Dicey and James and Sammy.5\n\nWhose observation is represented in that second sentence? It is characteristic of Cynthia Voigt's unpretentious prose that this comment is both Dicey's perception (because Dicey was the subject of the preceding sentence) and the narrator's as well. It also manages (through the childlike repetition of ‘and’) to be the young Maybeth's perception too.\n\nThe distinction usually made between a closed text and an open one seems not to be applicable here. The writing is highly controlled, but the effect is to provide a relentlessly faithful account of the realities of the lives of the four children, without sentiment or mitigation. Voigt's authorial voice seems to be saying to the reader: this is realism, this is reality, we must agree to be realistic about it. And, since Dicey is the oldest and has a growing understanding of the three younger children and their predicament as a group, this perception is predominantly associated with her. Throughout the first novel there are two key pronouns, she and they, indicating two narrative polarities: the inner monologue of Dicey and the narrator's/Dicey's account of what the children do together as a group.\n\nHomecoming is characterized by writing like this:\n\nMaybeth and Dicey crossed the dirt road from the playground and found the path to the small campground. Another path led to a bluff overlooking the marshes. They walked without speaking through the warm morning. The only sounds were the rustling of the leaves above them and the rustling of their feet on the leafy ground. They emerged from the woods on top of a low bluff that marked the border of the marshlands. Below, the heavy grasses swayed. Narrow canals of water moved gently. The scene could have been painted in watercolours, so pale was the green of the grass, so subdued was the green of the water.6 (emphasis added)\n\nMost of this is effective information-giving; compact, precise and vivid. The perceptions could be the objective narrator's or they could be subjectively Dicey's or—less likely—Maybeth's. But the sentence which I have italicized introduces a new and self-consciously authorial manner: both the aesthetic painterly observation and the stylized repetition (‘so pale … so subdued … ’) are clearly not part of the consciousness of either of the children. There are other examples: ‘The air was clear, clean, lucid, lying lightly upon the world that morning’7 and ‘ … wispy trees looked like weeds grown up’.8 They invariably occur in the midst of routine reportage, twitching the reader's awareness a little from the faithfully prosaic to a slightly more distanced poetic perspective.\n\nAt times, these writerly observations are there to indicate for the reader that a child's own language is never quite going to be adequate to the narrator's requirements. These are not first-person narratives. So, when we are told, for example, of Cousin Eunice's ‘silly helpless smile’9 at their first meeting, we cannot be sure whether the narrator is sharing this observation with the reader, or whether Dicey has already summed up her relative. It is more likely that observations like these work conspiratorially—the character, the narrator and the reader sharing a growing understanding as events take place and words are found for them.\n\nEven in the first novel of the series, Voigt's language often seems to recoil from its own prosaic nature by turning unexpectedly—and with simple directness—into revelatory symbol:\n\nMaybeth looked up from a pile of stones she was making into a long circle around herself.10\n\nor, in this case with less simplicity, as Dicey is working in the circus tent:\n\nMore goodbyes, Dicey thought to herself, coiling up the last rope into a dark brown hoop, piling loop upon loop. ‘I am unfond of goodbyes,’ she said to herself. All of their goodbyes lay like the coiled ropes on the ground, connected and unconnected, curling silently, finished things.11\n\nHow Things Work\n\nTo read these novels is to become absorbed in processes. The Tillerman narratives are fascinated by the way things work and how things change—how a meal is prepared, how timber can be smoothed and shaped, how four children approach a house and knock on the door, how to order fresh supplies for a butcher's shop, how to fish for crabs, how people operate in groups, how groups inter-relate in cultural communities and ideologies. Nothing, however mundane or trivial, is beneath this detailed authorial attention. Always, the prose works solidly at it, capturing the actuality, the sequence of tiny interrelating events, the inter-dependence of homely phenomena or the significance of unconsidered actions, and the way past patterns impinge upon current needs.\n\nIn Sons from Afar there is so much of this kind of description that Cynthia Voigt seems almost to be deliberately risk-taking, pressing her readers into a state almost of boredom. We are given even more here than in previous novels of the multiplicity of details surrounding the protagonists. Sometimes pages of it. In the following example, Sammy is shocked to discover that James has no money:\n\n‘Why not?’ Sammy asked. He had twenty-one dollars left of the hundred dollars he'd started off what James called their fiscal year with. They had a summer crabbing business, he and James, and Jeff helped out when he wanted to which was pretty regularly. They kept the first money they made for themselves, for a year's allowances, a hundred dollars apiece. Jeff didn't keep any, but James and Sammy did. At first, Jeff had agreed to split the earnings three ways, for the days he worked along with them, but then he'd stopped, refusing to take his share. He'd told them to put his share in a college fund, or get something they needed. Usually, Jeff did what he thought you wanted him to do, but about the money he wouldn't budge. So James and Sammy started out the summer with a hundred dollars and the rest of the profits they gave to Gram. It wasn't a fortune, but it helped. ‘You had twenty dollars after Christmas,’ Sammy reminded his brother.\n\n‘I had to buy a glove.’12\n\nWhy does Cynthia Voigt do this? This detailed retrospective infilling of information is certainly dispensable. One reason, I believe, is her fascination with the way needs and immanent phenomena are linked, often unsatisfactorily. Another is that, in this book, the narration, with its insistently detailed minutiae, enacts the psychological condition of these two fatherless sons. In the above extract, the pragmatic and down-to-earth Sammy, trying to understand his reticent and preoccupied older brother, constructs an accurate and sensible equation with the logical outcome that James should still have twenty dollars—only to discover that he had not factored in James' obstinate need to buy a baseball glove for a game which he hates. So this detailed account is not a narrative digression, but a demonstration of how Sammy thinks. Style is both character and understanding.\n\nBut not always. The faithful accounts of mundane moments can unexpectedly shift into poetry.\n\nMaybeth sat straight-backed at the piano, wearing an old brown sweater Gram had knitted for James years ago. Her head, curls the colour of yellow corn ripened in the sunlight, bent forward a little, and her hands moved over the piano keys. The music tumbled out, filling the room, generous. Her hands were what made the music, her hands and Mozart and the piano. James sometimes wondered how it was that Maybeth, who was so slow at everything else, even the cooking and sewing she had a natural ability for, could be so quick and sure with music.13\n\nThe history of the ‘old brown sweater’ is precisely the kind of humble detail which gives families a sense of themselves and their continuity. But what follows (italicized) are perceptions of a different order, rhapsodic and lyrical. But whose thoughts are they? They might be the appreciative James', as what follows certainly belongs to his way of working things out—the careful self-correcting is typical of him, as he acknowledges that Mozart and the musical instrument had something to do with the music played. And then the reader is told directly what ‘James wondered’ about his mysterious sister.\n\nCynthia Voigt has shaped for herself an authorial voice which retains the advantages of a first-person narrator without relinquishing the third-person narrator's objectivity. As I have already suggested, this works to create the sense of a three-way conspiracy, with the character, the narrator and the reader edging their way together towards understanding. Maturation takes place in this novel on these terms.\n\nIn Sons from Afar, as Sammy and James search for their father, both boys undoubtedly mature as they discover that they can survive violence and emerge from it with greater self-understanding. But the way that Voigt manages such transitions suggests a discriminating authorial caution, as if she is suspicious of the ways in which narrative grammar can seduce a writer into slickness. James at one point, for example, comes to feel that he is at last free of the obsessive need to find out about his father; he no longer believes he must go on playing baseball to prove he is not a ‘dork’; and he intends to sing in the chorus because that is what he wants to do, and because ‘it wasn't as if he was going to live for a hundred years’. In fact, he adds, nobody is guaranteed any time at all.\n\nFiguring that—it was as if a dark shadow that had been riding round on his back all of his life had floated away. There was a dark clinging thing and he had unwrapped its fingers from his throat and tossed it back into the darkness it had come from. That wasn't exactly true, he knew, but it was the way he felt.14\n\nThe ‘dark figure’ that had been riding around on his back all his life might have appeared in any number of psychological novels of maturation or therapy—but it is characteristic of Cynthia Voigt that she (through James) draws back in the sentence I have italicized from its melodramatic evocations. She invites her reader to share with her the understanding (‘That wasn't exactly true’) that serious writers may at times need to use words which are not strictly accurate but which may, provisionally, help to clarify. The reader is being asked to contribute, to bring some understanding of the task of writing.\n\nJames becomes clearer about many muddled matters in his life. But clarification, though psychologically crucial, is syntactically peripheral. It slips into the characters' consciousnesses at unguarded moments. Understanding and revelation invariably occur at the edges of sentences or paragraphs, almost as accidental afterthoughts; or, sometimes, in a dialogue in which the speakers stumble apparently by chance upon some important perception. In this way, Sammy too becomes clearer about something which had puzzled him, and his perceptions come to him when he is crabbing with his new young assistant, Robin, engaged in ‘safe’ chat about rowing, traps and outboard motors. But Robin has family uncertainties of his own to deal with and Sammy finds himself unexpectedly discussing fathers—and then mothers too.\n\nSammy never talked about Momma; he almost never really thought about her; he just remembered. But floating along in the boat, he wanted to say something. ‘She played with me, she was fun. Her hair was long, and soft—it kind of shone,’ he remembered that. Remembering that hurt, but it was a good kind of pain. ‘I was pretty little when she died, but I think now,’ he thought aloud, ‘she was the kind of person who might be too gentle. You know?’ The kind of person who needed taking care of—he couldn't stop himself from thinking; and his father was the kind of man who didn't take care of things.15\n\nThe practical Sammy does rather well in this episode. He is unusually articulate—though more gets worked out in his inner speech than is expressed in actual utterances. More significantly, though, he handles the smaller boy's anxieties and inexperience with enormous tact and kindness, unconsciously demonstrating how unlike his father he has already become.\n\nIt is easier for James than for Sammy; at least, that is what Sammy thinks. ‘ … James always knew what to think because he was practically a genius, or something.’16 Voigt seems with the character of Sammy to be fascinated by the kind of mind that does not speculate, and by states of un-awareness. Shortly after the above episode, Sammy is mortified to discover that everyone is blaming him for not having noticed that Maybeth is unhappy and that his neglect has contributed to this.\n\nSammy had said something wrong, something awfully wrong, and Gram and James knew what, but he didn't. If they didn't tell him, how was he supposed to know? How was he supposed to guess, without being told? And then, the way they were looking at him—like he should know, like they couldn't believe he didn't know. They were blaming him now for not knowing. It made him angry, even though he maybe ought to know whatever it was he didn't.17\n\nThe graceless syntax, the unanswerable questions, and the awkward way in which sentences recoil against themselves all indicate Sammy's frustration and bafflement. When he eventually understands what it is he has failed to do, he is irritated by the cussedness of time, by the irredeemability of the past. He and Robin had been forced to throw the anchor overboard earlier, and this loss provides Sammy with a homely analogy to help him understand:\n\n… The anchor was gone, lost. You couldn't find things you'd lost overboard. The bottom shifted, mud and sand moved constantly, covering up anything that fell in; and then, it was almost impossible to pinpoint any particular spot on the water, because there were no stable landmarks. You couldn't mark anything by a wave. A wave just moved on away; it was just part of a moving pattern.\n\nThere wasn't anything he could do about Maybeth, either.18\n\nThe physical practicalities of Sammy's daily life provide him with the language with which to understand metaphysical issues. The father he had never had, and whom he and James had failed to trace, the severe beating-up they had suffered in their search, also belong to this incomprehensible and irretrievable past. ‘Without a father,’ Sammy thinks, ‘it was like being lost without a map.’ And that cheers him, because ‘the picture was exciting, not frightening; it was an adventure. Sammy didn't mind adventures’.19\n\nMaturation creeps up on James and Sammy unobtrusively, in afterthoughts, humble metaphors, and chance insights. But, most importantly, it takes place reciprocally. The beating-up which they endure—which comes close to a killing—amounts to a decisive rite de passage, with Sammy showing extraordinary physical courage and James employing his intelligence and way with words. But for all its dramatic intensity, Voigt makes it clear that the real maturation occurs afterwards as the two brothers think and talk about what happened. In the closing pages, the two of them acknowledge their understanding of each other—and their responsibility towards Maybeth. In their talk, it becomes clear that the problems of fatherhood have been put behind them; this is a maturing of brotherhood.\n\nJeff\n\nA Solitary Blue more closely fits the notion of a maturation novel than the preceding two: it is exclu- sively about character. It is also structurally very straightforward in its representation of personal growth: it is a there-and-back novel, taking the boy, Jeff, further and further into himself until he is at the very edge of breakdown, and then—almost exactly halfway through—bringing him out again, safely back to sanity and stability, with the help of his father.\n\nFrom the start, Jeff is a lonely little boy, trained in acquiescence and submission, and over-aware of other people's reactions so that he can please them. His wariness is conveyed in extended deadpan descriptions, as if the narrator's voice is located behind the little boy's eyes as he carefully appraises everything that happens to him and every place he finds himself in. This example occurs when Jeff has flown for the first time to visit his mother's family:\n\nAt the luggage claim Jeff picked out his father's battered leather suitcase and went to the waiting area. This was a big room, with two long walls of window and two short walls of ticket counters. He sat on a plastic chair, his suitcase at his feet.\n\nOutside the window to the runway, the sun went down and the sky turned dark.20\n\nJeff is always conscious of two things; the details of place and the changes that occur in those details as time passes.\n\n… Jeff kept an eye on his suitcase and on the clock. He wasn't hungry, he wasn't tired. He waited.\n\nAnd he waited. The room was less crowded now, and the twin headlights drove up less frequently. The air grew quiet …21\n\nMelody, his mother, arrives eventually to take him to her grandmother's house, and when Jeff is left alone in his room, the careful and deliberate description resumes. The reader is given every detail about the bed, the walls, the furniture, ‘a little writing table, with a chair pulled up to it’, the wardrobe where he hangs all his clothes, how he arranges his brush and comb and where he lays his toothpaste and toothbrush.22 This description is an inventory of prolonged discomfort, because all the time Jeff really needs to go to the toilet; but, like visitors everywhere, he doesn't know where it is. With Jeff, though, this systematic watchfulness has developed into a chronic and necessary part of his coping, a strategy of discipline and disguise to conceal his inner vulnerability.\n\nIn the days that follow, Jeff explores the house and the people, the town and the country nearby, the hierarchy and ethos of a family which is totally strange to him. The orderly prose enacts the orderly way he assembles the details of this new environment he finds himself in. Most of the children in the Tillerman series have to make or re-make a sense of family and stability within a place and this is Jeff's first experience of a family with a sense of its own continuity and distinctiveness, a quality which is (much later) revealed as weird, unloving and even cruel. The way of life represented by the old grandmother is ‘contented’ to be the way it is; he later thinks of the ‘spacious indifference’ of her house.23 It is inert, and Jeff literally falls asleep when he resolves to try to think it out.24\n\nBut he falls in love with his mother, Melody.\n\nJeff sensed that she wanted him to talk about school, but he was bemused by sensations and couldn't chatter. He felt as if he had been cold, frozen down to his bones and into the marrow, and suddenly now he lay under the warmth of the sun. He could feel himself growing easy, relaxed, under the warmth; he couldn't distract himself from the enjoyment of that. It had something to do with the way his mother held his hand, held to his arm when they walked, touched him with his glance. His sensations were half remembered, memory growing stronger with every minute he was with her.25 (emphasis added)\n\nThere is more going on here than that rather commonplace cold-and-warmth figure of speech might suggest. Jeff is a thinker, very aware of himself and already able to anticipate what he thinks Melody would like him to do. He is also, secretly, a rather adult boy (‘bemused’), and at the same time stirred by fragmentary memories of having been loved by Melody in his infancy. And tormented, too: why can't he ‘chatter’, and why would he want to ‘distract himself’ from this pleasure? Already, Jeff is being divided into two selves.\n\nThe journey home confirms this division.\n\nIt was not simply going from a warm to a colder climate, or from his mother to his father. It was also going from one self to another. In Charleston, he was Jeffie, Jefferson, Melody's son, the last in a long line of Boudrault men. In Baltimore, he was Jeff Greene, self-sufficient and reticent, no trouble at all, occupying his corner of the world. But he knew now how it felt to be loved, to be happy.26\n\nIs Jeff thinking these thoughts? Or is the narrator interpreting for the reader? In the gap between those two possibilities, the reader's own understanding takes possession. Later, back home, Jeff's duality becomes real in a different—more visual—way when he looks into the bathroom mirror and ‘catches his own grey eyes’.\n\nHe stared at them, his glance going from one to the other mirrored eye, surprised.\n\nThese were his mother's eyes. His eyebrows did not arch over them, as his mother's did, but were straight. His hair lay flat on his head; his mouth was broader, thinner than Melody's. But the shape of the face—he almost traced it in the mirror with his finger—the straight, narrow nose, the chin, was very like hers. He looked back into his own eyes, a grey so deep that it did not ever change colours. They were like hers, they were hers. He felt almost as if he could convince himself that he was looking at Melody, that she was with him now. He hugged the idea to himself and went downstairs.27\n\nHe has made Melody into a secret, dangerously tied in with his sense of his own identity. She is, of course, totally unworthy of his love. Everything she says wrong-foots him and she lets him down at every turn. Cynthia Voigt's creation of this character never falters. The writing seems to be in love with Melody—it has to be because Jeff is—while simultaneously exposing what kind of woman she is. The account of her final betrayal when she abandons him for a month, needs to be quoted in full:\n\n… ‘Where have you been?’ she asked him.\n\nJeff just let the happiness grow inside him.\n\n‘Nobody knew where you were,’ Melody said. ‘You shouldn't just go wandering off like that.’\n\nShe was angry. ‘I'm sorry,’ Jeff said. ‘I told Gambo this morning.’\n\nMelody stood up and took him out into the front hallway to say, ‘You know she can't remember anything. Honestly, Jeffie, I thought I could trust you.’\n\nJeff felt ashamed of himself, although he couldn't be quite sure why, and he hadn't noticed Gambo forgetting, just not being interested. ‘I'm sorry,’ he said, and then said it again. ‘I'm sorry.’\n\nShe wasn't satisfied. ‘And I told Max I'd go with him out to Sante Fe, and now I don't know if I can,’ she told Jeff. ‘All you can say is, \"I'm sorry\". Just like your father.’\n\nJeff just stared at her. He couldn't have spoken. He was confused, between guilt at failing her, dismay that she was going away again, and the desire that she not be angry with him.\n\n‘Well?’ she asked.\n\nHe swallowed. ‘When?’\n\n‘We have to leave tonight and drive straight through, to get there in time. I had to wash and iron everything, and Miss Opal is so slow—it takes her ages to do anything these days.’\n\n‘But Melody … ’ Jeff heard his own voice complaining and saw anger rise in her eyes again. He didn't protest any more. ‘For how long?’ he asked.\n\n‘A month, maybe five weeks. It's a really important chance for Max. And you're here to keep an eye on Gambo for me so it's all right. If you weren't here I don't know how I'd get away.’\n\nJeff made himself accept it, right then. He knew that if he waited even for a second, he would start complaining, and then she really wouldn't like him. ‘OK,’ he said.\n\n‘Oh Jeffie, I knew I could count on you,’ and she smiled into his eyes…. ‘Come and watch me pack? We can catch up with each other. Oh, I missed you, Jeffie,’ she said. She looked like she meant it. He felt like she was telling the truth, even though he knew she must be lying.28\n\nJeff's disillusionment is twofold: he can see through Melody's manipulative love for him; and he has been shocked to discover his own weakness.\n\n… He felt … as if he had been broken into thousands of little pieces. Broken and then dropped into some dark place. Some dark place where he was always going to stay.\n\n… He had never suspected how easy he was to break.\n\nHe couldn't think of anything he wanted to do. Ever.29\n\nThis is despair, not maturation. He seeks solitude on a remote beach, where he can feel ‘washed clean, healed’.30 Eventually, when he returns to his father's house and his old way of life, he takes the idea and imagery of this beach with him, locked into a private place in his mind where he can feel safe. He has become solitary and blue. These pages31 faithfully chart the disintegration of the self, as Jeff locks himself away from all contact. He is now a seriously disturbed boy, on the edge of complete breakdown. His outer life is a matter of mechanically going through the motions—to ensure that he is left alone with his private inner life left uninterrupted. Jeff has set up a psychological lock-out, an isolation to guarantee that he won't unravel like a ‘melody’ turning into its meaningless separate components.32\n\nBut Jeff is rescued. And it is characteristic of Cynthia Voigt that there is no total mental collapse, no therapy, no psychological fireworks. Jeff's father had all along understood more than the reader had given him credit for. He steps in now, prompted by school reports of truanting and flunked courses, and the two of them begin to talk—two males hurt by the same woman, beginning to discover (to their own muted astonishment) that they are both affectionately interested in each other. This delicately written account of the intimacy between father and son, both habitually reticent and undemonstrative, is a supreme authorial achievement.\n\nMaturation for Jeff is recovery from disillusionment—but also from his growing sense that he had no self at all, no identity. He is appalled to discover that, when he tries to recall his earlier years in school, he remembers some of the teachers and some of the children but never himself. ‘It was almost as if he'd been a ghost in all those rooms, all those days, a ghost in his own life.’33 This idea is later picked up and worked out more fully.\n\nMost of the time, he thought, he practised not being anybody. If you weren't anybody then nobody could—what? Hurt you or leave you behind? Make you unhappy? But then they couldn't make you happy either, could they? If you played it safe, then you kept safe.34\n\nThis ‘not being anybody’ accounts for all those long paragraphs of apparently endless description which filled so much of the first half of the novel. Cynthia Voigt's task was to represent life as observed by a consciousness habitually seeking to hide itself. This was style as symptom. The recovery in the second part of the novel is possible only because Jeff is capable of intelligent self-analysis; he does work things out for himself, privately at first, until later this inner speech becomes external and collaborative in conversations with his father. Talk becomes understanding and healing.\n\nDicey appears on the scene at about this point but his growing friendship with her is difficult because of his experience with Melody. In the concluding section, Melody makes one last appeal35 to Jeff and almost succeeds in demolishing his recovering sense of self. But Jeff comes through this with the help of his uncommunicative father; and Dicey plays her part too, telling Jeff that her grandmother thinks he is a ‘rare bird’ with ‘staying power and a gentle spirit’.36 Voigt never uses the words ‘maturity’ or ‘maturation’; Jeff's quietly joyous sense that he has a valued place in the world is both more muted and more dramatic: he feels as if he had just got a letter from ‘somebody wise enough to know the truth, from everybody, or at least everybody that mattered’.\n\n‘Hello,’ the letter said. ‘Hello, Jeff Greene, I've been watching you and I like you and I want to know you better. This is just to say I'm glad you're alive in the world.’ The list of signatures, he thought, would include his own.37\n\nDicey's reference to a ‘rare bird’ ties in with the symbolism of the solitary blue heron of the title. It first appears viewed by Jeff from a bus as he is travelling from his mother's home to his father's: it is described as ‘unnoble and unbeautiful’, occupying ‘its own insignificant corner of the landscape in a timeless, long-legged solitude’.38 The heron reappears later, described in some ornithological detail, but with nothing but its isolation to suggest a connection with Jeff: it is part of this fully and relentlessly described landscape.39 Later, however, when Jeff and his father are considering a new home, Jeff's mind seems to be made up when a blue heron appears and stares at him. ‘Jeff stared back, not moving, except for the smile on his mouth.’40 When it appears for the last time, its solitariness is again emphasized before it turns its back ‘in a stately gesture of dismissal’.41 The symbolism of boats and sailing in the first two novels of the series has already demonstrated the tendency of symbols in this series not to be clear, their resistance to analysis or definition. That is the role of symbols—but Voigt's symbols are so modest and undramatic that they are almost indistinguishable from everything around them. She seems almost to be renouncing them, or exposing their untrustworthiness, the slippery way in which they are both potent and at the same time commonplace. If it were not for the title of the book, the solitary blue heron would be just one of the thousands of observed details of this fictionally realized world.\n\nThe closing chapters of A Solitary Blue are remarkable because Jeff, his father and Dicey—all individualists given to considerable reticence—formulate within their heads, and occasionally in conversation with one another, a collective understanding of themselves, and of life, love and relationships, which constitute what amounts to a philosophy in which Jeff can find a comfortable place. If this constitutes his maturity, it is made clear to the reader partly in the form of ‘wisdom statements’. These are possible because, in the Tillerman series, maturity equals understanding. Jeff articulates them, sometimes privately for himself, and sometimes with other people. When, for example, he asks his father if he thinks there is such a thing as a one-woman man (meaning, really, is he—Jeff—such a person?), the Professor replies: ‘I wouldn't be surprised if you were; it seems to be in your character. And what's in your character is what you've got to deal with.’42 And, later, when the two of them are considering whether Melody ever loved Jeff, his father says:\n\n‘It strikes me that love is just the beginning. If you think about it, Jeff. I think we can't help loving, but what matters is what we do about it. What we do with love. Do for it. What love does with us.’\n\nJeff does not simply take this statement and apply it to himself; its meaning to him depends on his appreciation of his father.\n\n… Jeff could see what his father was looking at: the Professor was looking at his own love for Melody and for Jeff; the Professor was sitting up and away from them, studying them and trying to understand how they worked. The Professor was doing what he always did, using his knowledge and experience to try to understand things as they really were.\n\nJeff could do that too …43\n\nIn spite of the symbolism of the solitary blue heron, it is in these carefully timed and staged formulations that a stronger sense of mature understanding emerges. Trying ‘to understand things as they really were’ is, in fact, a constant theme in the Tillerman series. Such perceptions are arrived at most frequently as points of dramatic understanding, achieved after considerable suffering and confusion, but sometimes as personal epiphanies. At the end of A Solitary Blue, when Melody has said to Jeff that she can never be ‘happy’ knowing about poverty in Colombia and doing nothing about it, he speculates inwardly:\n\nHappy, unhappy—Jeff was beginning to think that wasn't the question at all. The Tillermans never worried about that, they worried about … living right for each one of them, together. He guessed you might call that happy, but he didn't think that was it, he didn't think that was the half of it.44\n\nPerhaps ‘epiphany’ is not the best word to describe such insights. The language—and the ellipse—suggest something much more cautious, more provisional, more exploratory. There is no such thing as a fully-achieved wisdom.\n\nBullet\n\nThe Runner, however, shows that maturity can go wrong, and understanding can readily turn into cynicism and rejection. It is an historical novel, a flashback to the generation before Dicey, to the time when the US was beset by two momentous issues—civil rights and the Vietnam War. Anyone reading the novels in the order of publication already knows that the main protagonist, Bullet, is killed in Vietnam. So a different kind of reading is required, with a renunciation of the right to a happy resolution, an acceptance that the narrative leads not towards adulthood and an imagined possible future, but to an early death. Everything in this novel is obstructed and the reader, from the start, is caught up in this. It is a narrative driven by destructive and frustrated energies. Bullet's name is his fate.\n\nBullet, full of adolescent physical energy, is an unlikable hero—aggressive, uncommunicative, rebellious, cruel to his dog, unresponsive to all appeals to his better nature, indifferent to the two big issues of his day. The emphasis throughout is on his separateness. He is realistic about life and people, and proud of his contemptuous understanding of everyone else's foolishness. He can see through everyone and everything.45 Maturation is impossible for him because he thinks he is already ‘grown up’ and everyone around him has been left behind.\n\n… Bullet knew what had happened—he'd grown up. His classmates talked about being grown up and realistic, but they didn't have the first idea about what was really involved in it …46\n\nWhat is involved in being ‘grown up’, for Bullet, is a proud and contemptuous acceptance that what happened to most people was ‘nothing, at best, and getting wiped out, at worst’.47 This perception is the basis of his untroubled and calculating confidence, which expresses itself both in his conversations and in his physical fights.48 He opts out of everything: he loves running but doesn't care about winning; he loves sports meetings but despises the camaraderie and is dismissive of the sportsmanship ethos. ‘He didn't run to win races, or to beat anybody. He ran because his body was built for it. He ran for himself. Simple as that.’49 He is described as ‘absolutely unconnected’50 and later this word is taken up against him as a reproach.\n\nBut Bullet does show some ‘connection’ in private—his unexpected feelings of grief and self-reproach when he kills the Old Dog; the short intimate time he spends with his mother afterwards; when he admits that he wishes Liza hadn't gone away;51 when he accepts that his friend Patrice is ‘coloured’,52 and—perhaps most significantly—when he notices and appreciates the beautiful black girl athlete and privately acknowledges her.53\n\nBut, contrary to all the expectations of the maturation novel, these apparently transforming perceptions transform nothing. The most significant example of this is the issue of racism in the school. Bullet is not deceived by the principal's time-serving hypocrisy as he addresses the assembled students. He simply stands up and leaves, very publicly. It looks for a moment as if he has—at last—made a stand, and certainly his friend Tamer believes he has the kind of charisma which might have swayed the opinions of the assembled students. But Bullet's outspokenness is not ideological or in any way principled; it is an expression of his personal indifference. He just walks out.\n\nHe waited, to see if [the principal] h"
