        "text": "This is a listing of known films about mountaineers compiled by Jerry Wayne Williamson. The W. L. Eury Appalachian Collection owns only a few of the following. Research notes regarding these films are found within the Jerry Wayne Williamson Papers.\n\nFilms from 1904â€“1995\n\n1904\n\nTHE MOONSHINER / BIOGRAPH Directed by WALLACE MCCUTCHEON\n\nComments: The earliest known treatment of mtn people by the movies, filmed in New Jersey. The last scene, \"The Law Vindicated,\" features--ironically--the shooting of the law in the back by the moonshiner's wife. A big hit in the early nickelodeon trade.\n\n1905\n\nA KENTUCKY FEUD / BIOGRAPH Directed by WALLACE MCCUTCHEON\n\nComments: The first known treatment on film of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, though this story is made of whole cloth, featuring a \"Jim\" Hatfield and a \"Sally\" McCoy. Violence is set in motion when little Buddy McCoy shoots the Hatfield matriarch in revenge for a thrashing he has received for stealing Hatfield apples.\n\n1907\n\nDANIEL BOONE: OR, PIONEER DAYS IN AMERICA / EDISON\n\nComments: The earliest known coonskin-capper. The plot featured many Indian fights. The native-Americans (\"savages\") abduct Boone's daughters and at one point have Boone tied to a stake, torturing him. He is rescued by his faithful horse and kills the Indian chief.\n\n1908\n\nTHE MOONSHINER'S DAUGHTER / KALEM\n\nComments: The 1st movie to introduce a love interest between the revenue agent and the moonshiner's daughter. Set in north Ga., the destruction of distillery equipment at the courthouse in Atlanta supposedly based on eye-witness account. The revenue agent is killed at the end and the moonshiners are not brought to justice, a fairly unique plot innovation.\n\nTHE MOUNTAINEERS / LUBIN\n\nComments: A movie photographer happens to capture evidence of a crime--a mountaineer robbing, murdering, and tossing a victim off a precipice. Includes moonshiners and a revenue agent and unconvincing special effects: \"The dummy used in the fall is the worst stuffed affair even shown on a screen.\"\n\nA MOUNTAIN FEUD / SELIG\n\nComments: Plot not found, but apparently a \"typical feud story\" set in \"natural surroundings.\"\n\nTHE JAMES BOYS IN MISSOURI / ESSANAY Produced by O T CRAWFORD\n\nComments: The 1st known movie about Jesse James, the highlands bandit. Featured \"some excellent work by genuine cowboys who know how to ride.\" When O T Crawford died in1917, this film was remembered as having had considerable success. Based on a popular stage play.\n\nIN THE NICK OF TIME / SELIG\n\nComments: The first known two-men-and-a-woman plot type (in which at least one of the three is \"mountain\" in some decisive sense). Bessie Barton, a young girl of the Ky mtns, is loved and courted by Robert Clayton, a wealthy young man from the Bluegrass. Jack Martin, a mtneer, is also in love with Bessie and resents Clayton. Martin attempts to kill Clayton, and Bessie is rejected by Bluegrass society. Features a set with a chasm and a drawbridge and a thrilling conclusion.\n\nTHE ORPHAN, OR, A MOUNTAIN ROMANCE / VITAGRAPH\n\nComments: Another romantic triangle movie, this one featuring two women and a man. The orphan of the title is a girl \"reared in the mtns, [who] is wild and ungovernable, and rebels against her protector,\" yet wins his hand in the end.\n\nTHE MINER'S DAUGHTER / VITAGRAPH\n\nComments: A coal miner's daughter first marries a humble miner, then is wooed and taken away by a wealthy New Yorker. The humble miner reclaims his wife with decisive physicality and takes her back home to the hills, \"and the recent desolate home is once more filled with happiness.\"\n\nTHE FEUD AND THE TURKEY: A ROMANCE OF THE KENTUCKY MOUNTAINS / BIOGRAPH Directed by D W GRIFFITH\n\nComments: An ancient struggle between the rather aristocratic Wilkinsons and the Caulfields. A Romeo/Juliet love develops between a son and a daughter of the warring clans, and the young lovers are disowned. Reconciliation effected at Christmas time over a stolen turkey and two kindly though comic black servants.\n\nTHE MOUNTAINEER'S REVENGE / LUBIN\n\nComments: A young mtn wife proves unfaithful to her husband by running off with a city man in his auto.

The mtn man gets his wife back, and the city man is better for his comeuppance.\n\nTHE MOLLY MAGUIRES, OR, LABOR WARS IN THE COAL MINES / KALEM\n\nComments: A decidedly anti-union treatment of the coal- mining unionization struggles of the 1870s in Pennsylvania. In this version, the secret \"Molly Maguires\" \"used their power over the simple miner folks for their own selfish ends.\"\n\n1909\n\nA DREAM OF WEALTH / VITAGRAPH\n\nComments: In 1849, a Ky mtneer strikes out for the Calif gold rush with his family, encountering great adversity on the way. The only survivor of the trek is the mtneer's little daughter, who is discovered by Indians and rescued. Fifteen years later, as the girl is about to be married, she recognizes an aged Indian--who is being roughed up by whites--as the Indian who rescued her on the desert, and she becomes the means of his rescue in return.\n\nMAID OF THE MOUNTAINS / ESSANAY\n\nComments: Revenue officers search for an illicit still, which is located in a cave.

He is shot from ambush for thus violating the unwritten law of the mtns.\n\nDAVY CROCKETT--IN HEARTS UNITED / NEW YORK MOTION PICTURE CO\n\nComments: The earliest known Davy Crockett movie, wherein the Alamo does not appear.

Mac, a devoted husband and father, is sent by the federal government into \"the wilds of Kentucky\" to work undercover against the moonshine menace. He ends up \"shutting his eyes\" to let one young moonshiner off. Why? Because the young man is himself a devoted husband and father.\n\nTHE MOONSHINER'S DAUGHTER / NESTOR\n\nComments: A hybrid story, combining two-men-a-woman elements and a case of mistaken identity.
