        "text": "In the early spring of 2022, I had the chance to talk to some of those human beings, and saw first hand a small fraction of the work that goes into acquiring wildlife data in the field.\n\nBlue racers are one of Canada’s rarest snakes, with only a few hundred individuals left in the entire country, found only on Pelee Island. For the last three years, WPC, Scales Nature Park, Ontario Nature, NRSI Inc., and the University of Toronto have been working to count, tag, and determine the habitat needs of these endangered reptiles. To do this, researchers not only catch the snakes by hand during the day, but also hunt for them at dusk after they’ve bedded down to sleep.\n\nAn observer is only in the way during a daytime snake chase, but I did get the opportunity to accompany three Ontario Nature researchers and WPC’s own Hannah McCurdy-Adams as they conducted one of dozens of artificial cover board surveys aimed at discovering the prefered sleeping quarters of blue racers. For two hours, the survey party and I squelched through mud and dodged poison ivy in two of Pelee Island’s nature preserves while we searched for 84 pieces of wooden board that the blue racer team had left as potential shelters for the snakes. With night approaching and the odd pheasant screaming in the twilight, we carefully lifted each board to count the number of drowsy reptiles underneath it. It wasn’t an unpleasant job, but it did leave me wanting to know more about the people who had chosen to make it a part of their careers.\n\nSo, I set out to find out more by asking them."
