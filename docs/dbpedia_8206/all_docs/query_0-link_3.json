Mann\n\nBob HoltInformationSpecies snakeGender Male\n\nThe Blue Racer is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced from 1972 to 1974.\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe cartoons are directed by Art Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Sid Marcus, Bob McKimson, David Deneen, Bob Balser, Cullen Houghtaling and produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. The majority of the cartoons were animated at the DePatie-Freleng studio, except for two done overseas: Aches and Snakes at Australia's Filmgraphics studio, and Little Boa Peep at Spain's Pegbar Productions.\n\nPlot[]\n\nA fast blue snake named Blue Racer (voiced by Larry D. Mann) tries unsuccessfully to catch a stereotypically-Japanese beetle (voiced by Tom Holland), who is a black belt in karate. Both characters spun off from Tijuana Toads in \"Hop and Chop\" (the Japanese beetle) and \"Snake in the Gracias\" (the Blue Racer). The goofy bird from the Tijuana Toads (Crazylegs Crane, who also repeatedly failed to collar the Racer and Toads himself) also later appeared in the series as well. 17 cartoons were produced.[1]\n\nProduction[]\n\nBob Holt voiced both the Blue Racer and the Japanese Beetle in the 1972 short Support Your Local Serpent.\n\nThe Japanese Beetle's last appearance was in the 1972 short Blue Racer Blues.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nAll cartoons written by John W. Dunn.\n\nâ„– Title Directed by: Released: Synopsis: 1 \"Hiss and Hers\" Gerry Chiniquy 1972-Jul-03 2 \"Support Your Local Serpent\" Art Davis 1972-Jul-09 3 \"Nippon Tuck\" Gerry Chiniquy 1972-Jul-16 4 \"Punch and Judo\" Art Davis 1972-Jul-23 5 \"Love and Hisses\" Gerry Chiniquy 1972-Aug-03 6 \"Camera Bug\" Art Davis 1972-Aug-06 7 \"Yokahama Mama\" Gerry Chiniquy 1972-Dec-24 8 \"Blue Racer Blues\" Art Davis 1972-Dec-31 9 \"The Boa Friend\" Gerry Chiniquy 1973-Feb-11 10 \"Wham and Eggs\" Art Davis 1973-Feb-18 11 \"Killarney Blarney\" Gerry Chiniquy 1973-May-16 12 \"Blue Aces Wild\" Gerry Chiniquy 1973-May-16 13 \"Fowl Play\" Bob McKimson 1973-Jun-01 14 \"Freeze a Jolly Good Fellow\" Sid Marcus 1973-Jun-01 15 \"Snake Preview\" Cullen Houghtaling 1973-Aug-10 16 \"Aces and Snakes\" David Deneen 1973-Aug-10 17 \"Little Boa Peep\" Bob Balsar 1974-Jan-16\n\nOther Appearances[]\n\nThe Blue Racer (or a snake looking just like him) appeared in the 1978 Pink Panther cartoon \"Pink Tails For Two\" where he mistook the Panther's pink tail for a lady Snake. In this film, The Blue Racer did not speak or move with super speed.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
