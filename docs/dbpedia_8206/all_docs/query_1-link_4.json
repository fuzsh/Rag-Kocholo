        "text": "The Tijuana Toads is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced by DePatie-Freleng and released through United Artists.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe series was about two toads, Toro and Pancho, who live in the Mexican city of Tijuana. Throughout the cartoon they try to eat their prey, but always get outsmarted. They would sometimes themselves be targeted by a bird, Crazylegs Crane, and would in turn always outsmart him.\n\nThe series introduced two characters who later got their own series. The Blue Racer first appeared in \"Snake in the Gracias\" before getting his own series in 1972. Crazylegs Crane also spun off to his own series for television in 1978 on ABC. Both characters were voiced by Larry D. Mann, except in \"Flight to the Finish\" where Bob Holt voiced Crazylegs Crane.\n\nToro was voiced by actor Don Diamond and Pancho voiced by Tom Holland. Crazylegs Crane was voiced by Larry D. Mann. Directorial duties were split between Hawley Pratt, Art Davis, Grant Simmons, and Gerry Chiniquy.\n\nThe animators include Don Williams, Manny Perez, Manny Gould, Bob Richardson, Warren Batchelder, Robert Taylor, Ken Muse, Art Leonardi, Irven Spence, Robert Bentley, George Nicholas, Phil Roman, John Gibbs, and Bob Matz.\n\nWhen series began airing in 1976 as part of The Pink Panther Laugh-and-a-Half-Hour-and-a-Half Show, NBC redubbed Tijuana Toads and renamed it Texas Toads to make the series less offensive. A laugh track was added to the new soundtrack, and the toads were given the new names of Fatso and Banjo. Producer David H. DePatie later commented on the process:\n\n\"When they (Tijuana Toads) went on television, we had to completely change them around and the series became known as the Texas Toads, and we had to redo all of the tracks that had any type of ethnic content and it really watered down the series down. We all thought it was a hell of a lot more funny when it was the Tijuana Toads, but at the time we had to do it in order to bring the thing on television.\"\n\nList of Cartoons[]\n\n# Title Date Director Story 01 Tijuana Toads August 6, 1969 Hawley Pratt John W.

As the case when the original shorts were shown on TV, they were rebranded as the Texas Toads. The toads were redesigned as western sheriffs with oversized cowboy hats replacing their sombreros.\n\nAvailability[]\n\nThe entire series was released on DVD and Blu Ray in 2016 by Kino Lorber"
