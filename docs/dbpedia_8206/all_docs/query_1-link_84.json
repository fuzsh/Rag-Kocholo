She's too old to beat boys up in the playground or skip maths. But she wishes she wasn't. Until, by chance, she unearths a family secret. One that's been buried since 1930s Cairo. One that her grandfather would rather stay hidden. But for Birdy this might be her chance to right the wrongs of the past, and prove maybe she isn't so useless after all? From award-winning playwright Amy Lever, Lost Girl is an exploration into Jewish-Arab heritage, the expectations of womanhood and family. Amy Lever is an award-winning actor and writer from Manchester. Her debut play “Life Before the Line” won the Cambridge University Edinburgh Fringe Award 2022 where it went on to receive critical acclaim at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, a transfer to the Cockpit theatre and is currently in development for a tour.\n\nThe Alphabet of Awesome Science\n\nJoin Professors Lexi Con and Noel Edge (the Word Nerd and the Science Freak) for thrilling voyage through the alphabet – where fascinating words inspire spectacular science! It's a tongue-twisting race from A to Z that's equal parts explosive, messy, hilarious, fascinating and gross. Brace yourself for an hour of carefully crafted alphabetical, scientifical (multi award-winning!) chaos. 'If I could give it six stars I would' ★★★★★ (The Advertiser) 'Left the kids and I looking at each other in disbelief and clapping with joy' ★★★★★ (See-Do-Eat-Review) 'Wonderful, wonder-inspiring wonderment' (The Adelaide Show)\n\nWhy I Stuck A Flare Up My Arse For England\n\nIt’s the EURO 2020 Final at Wembley and Billy’s gone viral for sticking a flare up his arse! Why I Stuck A Flare Up My Arse For England is a blisteringly funny new play that returns to the fringe after a sell-out, five-star run last year. Written and performed by Alex Hill, it asks what it means to belong to a club that you live for. Billy and his best pal Adam are die-hard football fans. It’s how they spend every weekend, without fail. It’s their escape, their religion and their life. But when they encounter a new group of mates, they start to take their support one step further. 'Boozy, ballsy, brilliantly executed' ★★★★★ (Entertainment Now) 'A gem of a play' ★★★★★ (Broadway Baby) 'As beautiful as it is thought-provoking' ★★★★★ (Corr Blimey) ★★★★ (The Scotsman) 'Priceless comic charm' (The Reviews Hub)\n\nDon't Call Me China Doll\n\nAs she prepares for the audition of a lifetime—playing Anna May Wong, Hollywood’s first East Asian starlet—China Doll must confront and untangle the ingénue’s legacy as she discovers astonishing parallels between them. Disdainful of Anna for perpetuating the stereotypes she still fights to overcome, China Doll wakes up to find herself magically transported to the 1930s in the body of the revered and reviled starlet. Over the course of several nights, she discovers profound similarities in the ways they navigate love, life, and identity as East Asian actors in the west. ‘Don’t Call Me China Doll’ is a one-woman show that explores the intricacies of internalised racism and self-worth. A compelling exploration of identity, discrimination, and progress, it prompts audiences to reflect on how and why East Asian artists still face the same barriers as they did a century ago. Raw, honest, and fearless, Diana Feng deftly manages heavy themes with surprising levity and a large dose of self-deprecating humour. Soon to receive a PhD in Culturally Specific Performance Practice and British East and Southeast Asian Representation, Feng is at the forefront of challenging the cultural narratives that shape our understanding of representation.\n\nThe Ghost of White Hart Lane\n\nSpurs and Scotland star John White was one of the best footballers of the 1960s, however, in July 1964 he was struck by lightning and killed at 27 years old. From humble beginnings growing up just outside Edinburgh, through to football fame and his tragic death, the play shares John's cheeky humour. It also follows the story of his son Rob White, who was just five months old when his dad died. Having premiered at Spurs Stadium, this follows on from the Sunday Times bestseller by Rob White and Julie Welch. 'The Ghost of WHL' is supported by Tottenham Hotspur FC, premiering at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in July before a run at the fringe. The play was commissioned by John White’s son Rob and follows on from his and Julie Welch’s Sunday Times best seller The Ghost of White Hart Lane - 'In Search of My Father the Football Legend'. The play tells the story of John White, from humble beginnings growing up just outside Edinburgh through to football fame & his tragic death, it also tells the story of his son Rob who was just 5 months old when his dad died. The play shines a light on the mental health challenges both father and son face and the way we deal with grief and loss, while dealing with serious issues the play has a very heavy sprinkling of humour throughout.\n\nCompagnia Baccalà: OH OH\n\nHilarious, tender, and ingenious, inspired by Chaplin, Keaton and the stars of silent films, Baccalà’s timeless performance of enthralling physicality and exquisite expression has been delighting audiences the world-over since 2010. Inventive, exciting and ridiculous, this breathtaking array of mishaps and acrobatics will have you laughing long after you leave the theatre. OH OH's wordless performance displays a joyful combination of acrobatics, humour, and slapstick. A slice in the life of a double act, an absurd pas-de-deux and an encounter between clowning circus and physical theatre at its best. 2024 Reviews 'An hour of beautiful, uplifting, delightful playfulness' ★★★★★ (Broadway Baby) 'Timeless pleasure of classic clowning with a new, innovative twist... a must-see' ★★★★★ (ONE 4 Review) 'Deft visual comedy with impressive acrobatics' ★★★★★ (Threeweeks)\n\nCharacter Flaw\n\nColourful explosions pop in this hilarious exploration of ADHD and queer identity. A plethora of eye-opening topics and hysterical anecdotes leave the audience educated, moved and highly entertained. Follow Pip as she navigates the challenges and celebrates the joys of neurodiversity. Brighton Fringe Award for Excellence Winner. OffFest New Writing Finalist. ADHD Comedy Award Shortlist. 'A little gem' ★★★★★ (British Theatre). 'A show you could see again and again!' ★★★★★ (TheatreAndTonic.co.uk). 'A tightrope act between us crying with laughter to genuine heartache. A show that gives in every possible conceivable way' ★★★★ (BingeFringe.com). After it's award winning, sell out run at Edinburgh Fringe 2023 directed by the incredibly talented Nat Kennedy, (Sirrah Sisters) Character Flaw is back for a final run!\n\nWill Sebag-Montefiore: Will of the People\n\nWith over 62 millions views across his digital platforms, Will Sebag-Montefiore brings his sharp musical, comedic and satirical prowess to the tangible realm of the stage. Will is an actor, writer and satirist who turns the news into sketches and songs and ‘Will of the People’ is his debut solo show. Watch him struggle to keep up with the ever-changing news cycle as he tries to make the world a better place (for him). You may have heard Will alongside Olivia Colman in the recent remake of Green Wing. He is a regular guest on Rosie Holt’s Noncensored, was murdered in Endeavour (ITV) has performed Shakespeare alongside Mark Rylance in Westminster Abbey with Shakespeare’s Globe and won Most Valued Player at a Primary School Football camp in 2001 (he was bad at football but people quite liked him). His satirical videos have been shared by the likes of Alastair Campbell, Owen Jones, Dermot O’Leary, Dawn Butler, Lorraine Kelly and, unfortunately, Joey Barton. Will is deeply ashamed of that last one but look, a retweet’s a retweet.\n\nMichelle Shaughnessy: Too Late, Baby\n\nThis is an admission of 'holy sh*t. I think I've missed the boat'. Michelle is not close to reaching her goals. Instead of whining about it, she is doing what she does best – turning it into comedy. A show for anyone who thinks it's too late to achieve their dreams, because it probably is. 'Charismatic and relatable... comedy gold' ★★★★ (Entertainment-Now.com). 'Star Quality' (List). 'I can't for the life of me understand why she's not a household name!' (Ed Byrne).\n\nMaria Telnikoff: All the Men Are Going to Hate Me\n\nFor millennia, men have written about sex and their work has been called \"great literature\". But when women do it they're accused of only writing about what they know. All The Men Are Going To Hate Me follows one woman's attempt to write the great novel of the 21st century (about all the men she's slept with). Part stand-up, part erotic poetry, part interpretive dance, this show is an odyssey through time and sex, exploring the line between experience and fiction. Winner of \"Best Stand-Up Show\" at Riverside Studios' Bitesize Festival. As seen at CPT, Leicester Comedy Festival and Riverside Studios.\n\nCan Duggan? Should Duggan? Will Duggan\n\nWill Duggan (as seen on the Russell Howard Hour, Sky One) is never going to be the youngest person to achieve... anything, anymore. Barrelling, as he is, towards 40 with terrifying speed, but looking at all those things he had planned, there's probably the vestige of something that he can grab, polish and present as a life's work. Maybe. Probably. Perhaps. You may have seen Will on Sky, BBC Three, ITV, or heard him popping up on BBC Radio 4. Maybe you've walked past him on the street. 'Effortlessly funny' ★★★★★ (JOE.co.uk).\n\nKiran Saggu: Slacks\n\nKiran Saggu hates hard work. Battling immigrant and capitalist pressure to succeed from her Desi-British-American background, she wonders: must she get her ass up and work? Or can she be loved, adored, rich and fulfilled from the safety of a log position in her flatshare bed? This show will cover topics like: How can I live with the fact I didn't start that YouTube channel at 12 years old to make me a millionaire now? When will men I date stop telling me they want to pursue stand-up comedy? And, can I sue the Daily Mail?\n\nMitch Benn: The World's Cleverest Idiot\n\nThe Songmeister's back, to tell us how artificial intelligence is no match for good ol' organic stupidity, and (from experience) how ACTUAL intelligence can't save you from being unbelievably cretinous... Mitch Benn is acknowledged as one of the best writers/performers of comedy songs in the UK. He is perhaps best known as the resident comic songwriter on BBC Radio 4’s The Now Show from 1999 to 2016. Well crafted, well sung, his songs are just plain funny' (The Guardian) Some reviews for last year's show: 'The man is talent .... I really enjoyed it! The audience all around me seemed to lap up every musical second.' ★★★★ (Edinburgh Reviews) 'As always there is what is for me a highlight, his ‘live looping’ where with the aid of his phone and a few pedals, he builds from scratch a fully orchestrated number in front of ones very eyes' ★★★★ (One4Review) 'Mitch Benn may be wondering what The Point is, but to the audience, it’s very clear, making us all laugh until we’re red in the face. And he does this very well. Bloody funny, go see.' ★★★★ (Starburst)\n\nSallyann Fellowes: SALIEN\n\nSallyann Fellowes brings her funny, weird show about not fitting in, Salien, to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Expect real-life experiences that aren't even remotely like real life, and weirdness. Learn something about her neurodiversity and how this might explain why Sallyann sees the world as an alien, and discover her journey through life as revealed through a bizarre pantomime of stories and anecdotes. Sallyann is neurodiverse and LGBTQ+ and welcomes everyone to her show. Leicester Square Comedian of the Year 2023 Winner, New Forest Comedian of the Year 2023 Winner, and G&B Comedy All Stars 2023 Winner.\n\nStefania Licari: Trust Me, I'm a Comedian\n\nFollowing her hit show Medico, Stefania Licari returns with a brand-new stand-up hour. Drawing on her experience as an NHS doctor, first-generation migrant, comedian and sometime endurance runner, she explores the diverse roles of women in today's world. From the operating theatre to the theatre stage, via an ultra-marathon through the Sahara, Stefania reflects on the big question: what are we running to and from? Multi award-winning Stefania sold out venues and earned rave reviews for Medico. Her follow-up promises to deliver her most personal, thought-provoking and side-splitting material yet.\n\nAlexis Gay: Unprofessional\n\n'Hey... do you have a minute?' Bad from your boyfriend, worse from your boss. From New York-based stand-up, viral video comedian and former tech employee Alexis Gay, Unprofessional is a comedy debut about working (or, uh, not working) in tech, and one very specific 4pm meeting at a company called... Redacted (she may or may not have signed an NDA, sorry!). Directed by Fringe veteran Matt Gehring, this show explores making work your entire personality, going nowhere on the hedonic treadmill and worrying so much about your LinkedIn profile that it lands you at the hair doctor.\n\nMartin Angolo: Idiot Wind\n\nIdiot Wind is the noise that comes out of a comedian's mouth in the form of jokes and observations, and Martin Angolo is full of it. The award-winning Irish comic looks at modern Ireland's positive and negative cultural shifts compared to the rest of the world, in an hour that's silly and politely offensive, in order to challenge the idea that 'comedians can't say anything these days'. As seen on Amazon Prime's LOL: Last One Laughing Ireland. 'Very funny' (Graham Norton) 'Laser-sharp wit' (Independent) 'Martin is hilarious and is an Irish national treasure' (Eric Andre).\n\nThe Last Incel\n\nShortlisted for the 2024 Popcorn Writing Award. Log into the world of the incels: a terminally online community of toxic men that blame women and society for keeping sex from them. That is until one of them sleeps with a woman who invades their group chat. And all hell breaks loose. Strap in as this wild satire turns over one of the darkest stones of the internet to reveal the strange fleshy humans wriggling underneath. ★★★★ (Binge Fringe Magazine) ★★★★ 'A delicious concept that offers a multidimensional perspective' (The Scotsman) ★★★★ 'triumphant piece\" (Boradway Baby)\n\nHarry Stachini: Grenade\n\nMost of us are carrying honesty grenades. Some are small, like farting in a lift and owning up to it. But some are truly massive. Harry’s was medium to large and once he pulled the pin; it destroyed an eight-year relationship, a mortgage and a blue whippet. Relationships, family dynamics and his years spent teaching future serial killers are all brought under the comedy spotlight in this show. Stachini serves up an hour of relatable, honest, and hilarious stand-up, shining a light on the Grenades that we all carry. Harry Stachini’s stand up and crowd work clips have amassed millions of views across his social media. He's established a reputation as an exciting young comedian with an impressive easy-going style. His warm and friendly stage presence comfortably leads us through hilarious and skilful storytelling which is beyond his years. He regularly performs at the UK’s finest comedy clubs and festivals and has also performed overseas in both Asia and Europe. 'A must-see act... compelling, inventive storytelling' (Spotlight Comedy Club) 'Well observed characterisations and anecdotes' (The Skinny) 'Belly-achingly funny' (I Love Manchester) 'Hotly tipped funnyman' (Manchester Wire)\n\nJames Roque: Champorado\n\nWhat actually matters in life?

The audience shout at him to stop. But he's acting like this happens every night. The man's a professional and he's got jokes to tell. It's beautiful in a way, but then the room begins to stink up with smoke and the fire alarm goes off. Everyone is asked to evacuate. Coleman carries on doing the show to an empty room.

I've since been diagnosed with Lyme's disease, long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome. I've got enough different flavours of brain fog to start a vape store.

A clear contender for future fame, Hamilton’s soundtrack is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for weeks. Featured artist on BBC iPlayer and BBC Radio, Amelia's comedy has earned her recognition and acclaim, with her rap being hailed as 'her secret weapon' (Beyond the Joke).\n\nRyan Cullen: Cullen in the Name Of!\n\nRyan delivers with an economy of words, an unapologetic style and surgical precision. An act you'll be talking about long after seeing him. 'Big laughs, his material has the ruthlessness of a young Jimmy Carr and the sexual turpitude of Jim Jefferies at his most priapic. Extraordinary stuff' (Kate Copstick, Scotsman). 'Cullen is one of my favourite comedians. Hilarious and so dark you think 'How the f**k did he end up like this?''

The Musical – The Unauthorised Parody of The Silence of the Lambs\n\nSILENCE! the Musical is the unauthorised musical parody of the Academy Award-winning film The Silence of the Lambs. As rookie FBI agent Clarice matches wits with the brilliant but insane Dr Hannibal Lecter to catch the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill, a chorus of singing lambs breaks out into show tunes about the most horrific of subjects. Complete with singing serial killers, songs with unprintable titles and a chorus of lambs, SILENCE! the Musical comes charging at you with gleefully unstoppable bad taste. In the Academy Award-winning film The Silence of the Lambs, rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling matches wits with the brilliant but insane cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, to catch the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill. Clarice must face her own demons and race the clock to unlock Lecter’s clues before another innocent girl is killed and skinned by Bill. It’s a hair-raising thriller that’s kept countless millions on the edges of their seats and permeated the pop lexicon with delightfully creepy quotes like “I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti” and of course “It places the lotion in the basket.” And now, at last, this delicate symphony of suspense has been turned on its ear and retold in the only way it can be – as a musical. A singing chorus of floppy eared lambs narrates the action; Buffalo Bill gleefully dances a hoedown while kidnapping hapless Catherine Martin; and even Dr. Lecter, scary as ever, sings about the life he’d like to lead someday outside the prison walls."
