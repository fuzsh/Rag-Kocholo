It is named for its speed and distinctive grayish-blue or blue-green body colour. The belly is usually a lighter blue-green or whitish hue.\n\nWhere it lives\n\nThe Blue Racer prefers open habitat with abundant cover such as prairie, savanna, alvar and open woodlands.\n\nIt also lives in pastures and abandoned farm fields where it can find a plentiful bounty of rodents, its primary food source.\n\nFemales lay their eggs in rotting logs or compost piles that serve as incubators until the eggs hatch. In winter, the Blue Racer hibernates below the frost line in rock crevices.\n\nWhere it’s been found in Ontario\n\nIn Ontario, the Blue Racer is currently found only on Pelee Island in western Lake Erie. The population appears to have declined since 1995, when there were about 205 adult Blue Racers on Pelee Island.\n\nOntario’s Blue Racers range over a wide area - the average is 111 hectares for females and 201 hectares for males.\n\nView a larger version of this map (PDF)\n\nWhat threatens it\n\nThe most significant threats to the Blue Racer are habitat loss or degradation, loss of overwintering sites, human persecution, and road mortality.\n\nAlthough Blue Racers can be found in old farm fields, they are relatively intolerant of human disturbance.\n\nAction we are taking\n\nEndangered Species and their general habitat are automatically protected.\n\nRecovery strategy\n\nA recovery strategy advises the ministry on ways to ensure healthy numbers of the species return to Ontario.\n\nRead the executive summary (March 2, 2015)\n\nRead the recovery strategy (March 2, 2015)\n\nGovernment response statement\n\nA government response statement outlines the actions the government intends to take or support to help recover the species.\n\nRead the government response statement (February 28, 2019)\n\nReview of progress\n\nA review of progress made toward protecting and recovering a species is required no later than the time specified in the species’ government response statement, or not later than five years after the government response statement is published if no time is specified.\n\nRead the report on progress towards the protection and recovery of 12 species at risk, including Blue Racer (2022).\n\nHabitat protection\n\nGeneral Habitat Protection - June 30, 2008\n\nWhat you can do\n\nReport a sighting\n\nReport a sighting of an endangered animal or plant to the Natural Heritage Information Centre. Photographs with specific locations or mapping coordinates are always helpful.\n\nVolunteer\n\nVolunteer with your local nature club or provincial park to participate in surveys or stewardship work focused on species at risk.\n\nBe a good steward\n\nPrivate land owners have a very important role to play in species recovery. If you find Blue racer on your land, you may be eligible for stewardship programs that support the protection and recovery of species at risk and their habitats.\n\nTry to develop an appreciation for snakes; they play an important role in our environment. Whether in a field or in your backyard, if you come across a snake, keep in mind that you are much larger than it is and the snake is more afraid of you than you are of it.\n\nIf you come across a snake, please don’t try to capture it, handle it or kill it. Snakes can be delicate and improper handling can cause serious injury. Also, certain species are protected under legislation, which makes it illegal to harass, harm or kill them. Be respectful and observe from a distance.\n\nAlthough species at risk are protected, poachers have been known to capture individuals for the pet or food trade. Never buy snakes that have been caught in the wild and never buy a native species of any kind that’s being sold as a pet.\n\nYou can help improve Blue Racer habitat by planting or leaving long grassy areas on your property (especially adjacent to woodlands or meadows) and planting hedgerows, which provide hiding places.\n\nReport illegal activity\n\nReport any illegal activity related to plants and wildlife to footnote [].\n\nQuick facts"
