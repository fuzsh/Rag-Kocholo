        "text": "I ordered this watch for my partners graduation to be sent to Australia. The original tracking that was sent to me didn’t update for 2 weeks and I was getting rather hesitant. I eventually (after multiple attempts on several platforms) got hold of Elliot Havok and managed to get the correct tracking. I was pestered 4 times to leave a review before I had even received the product which was annoying. It took roughly a month to get to Australia which is a quite a big longer than normal, and the communication from Elliot Havok wasn’t amazing which is why I docked a star. However, the watch itself is stunning (diamond black racer chronograph). The quality is very good and is much better in person than expected from the pictures. The packing was good and even though it came all the way from America to Australia, the box was completely undamaged.\n\nI've had this watch for over a year, I've worn it a lot because I like the style very much, very sporty and elegant at the same time. The description says it has sapphire crystal, I made a test of the drop and it failed, I have a Wenger Avenue that's sapphire coated - mineral crystal and it passed the test, so, I realized it that there's not sapphire crystal in this watch(Havok Racer), I like the watch but I think is not good to tell something that's not true just for selling, it's better to tell the truth and let people make the decision. The lume of the watch is OK, not good enough but it doesn't matter. I asked them what kind of lume is and I never received the answer. Hope my honest review help you. Cheers!\n\nFinally after two months from the detention and related customs control as the documents were \"not enough\" for customs clearance I received the Havok SAPPHIRE BLUE RACER CHRONOGRAPH watch.I have been using it for a few days and I find it very comfortable and well made.It's a nice watch to wear\n\nOne of the best Watches i have owned Currently own 3 Havok Watches, o far this is my favorite one, everyone ask's where did i get the watch from and if i paid a lot for it, I am happy to say this is one watch I enjoy myself wearing everyday either business or casual, and most likely will continue to buy Havok watches because of their style/ function and it does not eat away at your wallet. Cant wait to see any new products they come up with"
