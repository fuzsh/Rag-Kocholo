"The Blue Racer" is a series of theatrical cartoons produced from 1972 to 1974.

Production

The cartoons are directed by Art Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Sid Marcus, Bob McKimson, David Deneen, Bob Balser, Cullen Houghtaling and produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. It is unknown if the cartoon will get a DVD release from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 20th Century Fox.

Plot

A blue snake named Blue Racer (Larry D. Mann impersonating Paul Lynde) tries unsuccessfully to catch a stereotypically-Japanese beetle (voiced by Tom Holland), who is a black belt in karate. Both characters spun-off from "Tijuana Toads" in "Hop and Chop" (the Japanese beetle) and "Snake in the Gracias" (the Blue Racer). The goofy bird from the Tijuana Toads (Crazylegs Crane, who also repeatedly failed to collar the Racer and Toads himself) also later appeared in the series as well. 17 cartoons were produced.

Trivia

* Bob Holt voiced both the Blue Racer and the Japanese Beetle in the 1972 short "Support Your Local Serpent".

* In the 1973 shorts the Japanese Beetle was no longer featured in the series making the 1972 short "Blue Racer Blues" his last appearance.

* Since July 2005, Boomerang has aired every Blue Racer cartoon at least once.
