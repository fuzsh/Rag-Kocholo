The Blue Racer is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced from 1972 to 1974.

Production[]

The cartoons are directed by Art Davis, Gerry Chiniquy, Sid Marcus, Bob McKimson, David Deneen, Bob Balser, Cullen Houghtaling and produced by David H. DePatie and Friz Freleng. The majority of the cartoons were animated at the DePatie-Freleng studio, except for two done overseas: Aches and Snakes at Australia's Filmgraphics studio, and Little Boa Peep at Spain's Pegbar Productions.

Plot[]

A fast blue snake named Blue Racer (voiced by Larry D. Mann) tries unsuccessfully to catch a stereotypically-Japanese beetle (voiced by Tom Holland), who is a black belt in karate. Both characters spun off from Tijuana Toads in "Hop and Chop" (the Japanese beetle) and "Snake in the Gracias" (the Blue Racer). The goofy bird from the Tijuana Toads (Crazylegs Crane, who also repeatedly failed to collar the Racer and Toads himself) also later appeared in the series as well. 17 cartoons were produced.[1]

Production[]

Bob Holt voiced both the Blue Racer and the Japanese Beetle in the 1972 short Support Your Local Serpent.

The Japanese Beetle's last appearance was in the 1972 short Blue Racer Blues.
