        "text": "Conjure One is a Canadian electronic music project, headed by Rhys Fulber, better known as a member of Front Line Assembly and Delerium, as well as other musical groups alongside Bill Leeb.\n\nFulber left Front Line Assembly and thereby all other Leeb-associated projects in early 1997, in pursuit of a solo career. Soon after, a debut album was announced, though Fulber's work as a producer and remixer eventually pushed its release to September 2002.\n\nThe self-titled album was a fusion of the electronic characteristics of Fulber's previous work -- keyboard-based, with rhythmic dance beats -- and the influences of Middle Eastern music, which inspired ambient melodies more reminiscent of Delerium.\n\nA number of songs were more pop-oriented and featured guest vocalists, primarily Poe and Chemda, the latter singing entirely in Arabic. Sin√©ad O'Connor and Jeff Martin of The Tea Party were also featured.\n\nAfter returning to Front Line Assembly and Delerium, in 2005 Fulber released a second album entitled Extraordinary Ways. This album utilized much more contemporary sounds, including much greater prominence given to guitars and trip hop-like beats. Vocalists included Tiff Lacey, Poe (credited as \"Jane\"), Chemda, Joanna Stevens, and even Fulber himself (covering a song by the punk band Buzzcocks).\n\nIn 2007, Germany's biggest selling female pop star of the 80s Sandra Cretu covered \"Sleep\" as a bonus track on her single \"The Way I Am\"."
