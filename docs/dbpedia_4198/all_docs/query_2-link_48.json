        "text": "Best known for his work as part of Front Line Assembly and Delerium, Rhys Fulber has in recent years put out dark, techno-based music under his own name. His most recent album, Brutal Nature, was heavily shaped by the pandemic leaving him with more time to focus but access to less equipment with which to … Read more\n\nWith COVID-19 postponing touring plans last year, Front Line Assembly instead focused its energies on new music, resulting in the recently released “Mechanical Soul.” As usual, the group takes its dark, aggressive electronic music into new directions while remaining true to its own unique sound. “Mechanical Soul” features guest appearances from Front 242’s Jean-Luc DeMeyer … Read more\n\nThroughout their long career, electro-Industrial band Front Line Assembly has consistently re-defined their style and musical approach, and their latest release, “Wake Up The Coma” is no exception. The album makes extensive use of guest vocalists, with Jimmy Urine (Mindless Self Indulgence), Robert Gorl (DAF), Nick Holmes (Paradise Lost) and Chris Connelly (Revolting Cocks, Cocksure) making appearances.\n\nOf the various side projects from members of Front Line Assembly, Delerium has proven to be the one to become a major focus and commercial success. Founding member Bill Leeb discusses their latest album, “Mythologie,” the evolution of Delerium, status of other projects, and more.\n\nOriginally a dark, soundtrack-style side project from Front Line Assembly’s Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber, Delerium has evolved to include a variety of guest vocalists and a more traditional song-based structure. Until recently, it was a completely studio-based outfit, but now they have transformed into a live band as well. After so many years, what … Read more\n\nRhys Fulber has been involved in quite a variety of musical projects over the years, ranging from being a member of Front Line Assembly/Delerium (and the various off-shoots) to producing Fear Factory. Now he’s back with Conjure One, a project that continues in the direction of the past few Delerium albums. The self-titled debut CD, … Read more\n\nWith the addition of vocals and an increased emphasis on dance beats, Delerium’s 1994 “Semantic Spaces” lp represented quite a change for the band. On their next release, “Karma,” the duo moved even further in this direction. Delerium is comprised of Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber, who have also worked together on Front Line Assembly … Read more\n\nFew, if any, current musicians can claim to be as prolific as Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb. As Intermix, Front Line Assembly, Noise Unit, and Delerium, they have released over 25 albums in less than a decade. That’s not counting other collaborations, with Fulber and/or Leeb working with such bands as Cyberactif and Will, and doing remixes for Fear Factory. The duo has recently put out a new Intermix album, Future Primitives. The album makes extensive and very creative use of various ethnic vocal samples, somewhat reminiscent of Deep Forest. In a phone interview, Fulber discussed the album."
