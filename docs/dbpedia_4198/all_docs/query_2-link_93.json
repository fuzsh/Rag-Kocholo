        "text": "Axel Brooks, Tommy Bravos\n\nEthereal pop, meets trip-hop, meets soft alternative rock would be the best description of Axel Brooks’ music. It’s sort of dark, moody and sexy at times but alternatively can be very upbeat bright and vivid. Axel makes music that takes you in a journey – starting somewhere slow and rather melancholic but ending in a place where everyone’s dancing! Tommy Bravos is like no other. His music exists at the intersection of fantasy, nature, philosophy and reality, bringing audiences to deeper emotional experiences. Contemplative music taps into all the sources of energy that speak to him, including his Greek heritage, exploring what can be made through the factors from which humans form identity. His latest EP, Everything is Growing, Am I? which discusses the changing nature of human identity, was released on June 14th, its reflective lyrics woven together through lush chords and the allure of pop melodies.\n\nKacie Brown (video premiere), Bread on Fork, Rani\n\nKacie Brown & The Vision is a neo-soul/pop collaborative band based in chicago.

Bouncing between the fringes of darkwave, punk-tinged EBM, and romantic synth-pop, NYC band, Public Circuit, is a seething exhibition of dark synthesizer magic, and raw-edged delivery. Marrying the late 70’s minimal synth-punk ethos of Nervous Gender and The Sound with the new wave romanticism of New Order and Iron Curtain, Public Circuit is determined to lead an inquisition upon electronic music as they carve their niche in the bedrock foundation that minimal synth was built upon.

Courtesy began back in 2010 in Memphis, TN when Drew Ryan and Kirk Rawlings met and started trading self-indulgent 4-track scrapsand private recordings not meant for others’ ears. Drums and guitars were recorded, chopped, and screwed as the two figured out how to combine their ideas into songs. In 2011, the duo released Idmatic—a collection of collage-based songs constructed via email, crammed with blown out boom-bap drumming and stretched out cassette wonk. By 2012, the duo relocated to Chicago, where they released Slow Bruise in 2015—a darker, colder, and more aggressive effort. They released HEY in 2018, “an unclassifiable electronic blend of off-kilter atmospheric synths, otherworldly vocal harmonies, deep-house grooves, and weirdo-funk bass lines all sewn together via a persistent Oberheim DX drum machine.” (Steve Rosborough, Moon Glyph Records). With the 2021 release of CHECK THE MILK, the band finds itself with a new, more focused direction, ready-made for basement DJs and glossy pop fans. Courtesy is in the studio now working on the new material.\n\nThe Kantors, Honeycrush, Oyeme\n\nThe Kantors are an indie folk-rock group based in Chicago. With comparisons to trailblazers like Angel Olsen and Joni Mitchell, the group doesn’t shy away from their unique genre blending sound.

Local artist Karen Mooney (moongerm) plays bass, Kyle Langer plays drums, and scene veteran Sam Fadness leads the band.

A project that has changed and expanded as Maroney has matured, their current lineup also features Mia Pariseau on bass. With choral & orchestral roots, Maroney and Pariseau find multiple outlets of melody, with moving vocal, guitar, and bass lines. Allergen’s debut EP, “Honesty Hour” was released in May 2020 after being produced with Claire Altendahl (boyish). These early foundations helped Maroney further curate what would become their current musical sound, something only found with age and experience. With vulnerable lyrics contrasting with distorted guitars, local music blog Ear Coffee describes Allergen’s released music “feels like a private conversation being broadcast to the world”. King Sans is a Chicago-based altrock/noisepunk band who only need two members to absolutely pummel you with sound. There’s a huge element of fun in their music as well, creating an addictive combination of energy"
