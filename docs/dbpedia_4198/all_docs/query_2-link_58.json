        "text": "My very first entry in a series where I plan to write about the stand-up comedy I consume!\n\n“Something To Take The Edge Off” was released in 2000 after being recorded at The Laff Stop in Houston, Texas and is the second proper album release of Doug Stanhope’s established stand-up career after 1999’s “Sicko”. Where “Sicko” bore the hallmarks of rare acts who find themselves debuting with a greatest hits compilation, this follow-up feels slightly less regimented, not that any of Stanhope’s work ever comes off as particularly stylised, always seeming conversational and boasting an air of structured rambling. It may also be his masterpiece, among a packed catalogue.\n\nAt this vantage point of 2022, Stanhope’s work as a stand-up artist ranks among the most essential creative material of the young century, in any field, so naming this record as the standard-bearer of his releases is no small feat. Subsequent records cleave to a similar template but subtly push the envelope, already a more deadly weapon in Doug’s hands than with most, in incrementally more extreme directions. He can pack an hour of any CD or video release with fresh and side-splitting social commentary, always bordering on the tangential and typically radiating an assumed spontaneity, which is an expert sleight of hand for a performer who is an undoubted master of the craft and has a deep and enviable understanding of how to construct a comedy set.\n\n“Something To Take The Edge Off” is thus a mercurial resource and stylistic lodestar in Stanhope’s career; if aspects of subsequent work push the dial even further in terms of excitement, outrage and hilarity, no other piece comes together quite as devastatingly overall, and all of the seeds can be heard being planted here. A central ingredient to the excellence of this record is the titular element, the acoustic guitar backing of musician and comedian Henry Phillips. This lends a singular attraction in the Stanhope canon and represents a meeting of the minds; beyond his general accompaniment, Phillips significantly enhances countless moments, with his instrument a key plank of several jokes. Most notable is a bit where Stanhope directly challenges the audience to name him, one of the most memorable laughs here. The timing of both acts is exquisite. Otherwise, Phillips strums away a number of watermark riffs which remain engrained in my head, ranging from the driving and kinetic to the dreamy and hallucinogenic. The pairing is entirely natural, and serves to simultaneously highlight and amplify the sonic possibilities always inherent in the vocal rhythms of stand-up comedy when usually delivered acapella.\n\nThis album firmly establishes Stanhope, early in his recorded output, as an obvious successor to the iconic Bill Hicks in several respects. When this record was released at the turn of the millennium, Hicks had been sadly dead for six years but his reputation as a revolutionary of the form was continuing to spread. Parallels do abound; Hicks’ most astonishing material releases such as “Arizona Bay” and “Rant In E-Minor” were similarly drawn from recordings at The Laff Stop and both took the format in new directions with Hicks’ own musical backing. Of course, most noteworthy are the excoriating political takes and trenchantly vocal advocacy of living outside the box, though the overlaps between the two men and their arguments are not exact. The calibre of the comedic content is undoubtedly comparable.\n\nStanhope’s unique expressions and sociopolitical comments here are certainly as acerbic and ruthless as his fanbase have grown to expect over the decades. The record features at least a couple of bravura employments of sound effects, a Hicks trademark which there is no shame in failing to quite match him at, and samples of the nascent body horror bits, with an inevitable sexual focus, which Stanhope would utilise even more supremely and unforgettably at various later junctures. Whether describing less explored instances of the ‘wonder’ of the human body or executing a scathing cultural takedown, Stanhope draws immense laughs from an utterly bruising poeticism which, at its finest , never leaves your head once heard. This is one of his greatest gifts, along with a flair for descriptive details which might scan as throwaway if not listening attentively but nonetheless can count among my favourite of his bits, sprinkling Easter eggs between the lines and ensuring a high repeat value.\n\nAs mentioned, Stanhope is performatively supercharged by the elusive quality of appearing to be soliloquising casually, erecting a simulacrum of easiness and drunken relaxation which masks a very thoughtfully carved show and coexists uneasily alongside an outwardly exhausted and dismaying persona. This may be the only remotely comfortable part of the experience of listening to him work, which is more widely challenging and mind-expanding in the best ways stand-up can be. He is a comedian with a white-knuckle grasp of momentum and how to effectively build to a crescendo. On this occasion we have clues and indicators to the architecture of the set bookmarked throughout for us in the form of Phillips’ guitar, carefully intertwining the intentions of both performers as they push ahead and cultivate strong audience reactions throughout.\n\nStanhope culminates proceedings with a major callback, albeit an intentionally crass and inherently dumb one, before diving into a closing long-form story as denouement. Stanhope tends to work by topical chapters but he certainly does set-pieces, with explosive examples littered across the span of his entire career. It is a testament to him that once immersed in his performances, it becomes rather easy to forget that he utilises traditional comic devices; a certain performative amnesia which is most surely beneficial to him. For me, the premier comedic highs of “Something To Take The Edge Off” come where Stanhope provides self-aware comment on his own scale and potential legacy (or lack thereof), including his brilliant perspective on the impact the very album he is recording is likely to have in history. Gladly, he isn’t entirely correct, and here I sit over twenty years later enshrining my views on it!\n\nLike any staple Stanhope release, this set can easily be mined for headline quotations which neatly encapsulate the essence of the artist and his infamous worldview. There are no shortage of those, and like all of his work, this album has often been a salvation for me; a darkly cynical oasis to retreat into after a horrible day at the office or when generally feeling like microwaved human shit. It is an early crest in a battery of performances where the standard barely drops an iota lower, acting as a marvellous microcosm of Stanhope’s now extensive index and rendered especial by the ace card that is Henry Phillips’ sole addition to that oeuvre.\n\nI know I was travelling to work on a windswept, soaking wet December morning in 2019 the first time I heard The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” on the radio, the perfect setting for its cleansing, synth-pop backwash. Those were rarefied days; the song still felt new, impossible to reimagine now, and unbeknownst to us all, the world was about to be flipped on its axis. Little did we know what was coming in all senses, as that driving, gleaming titan of 80s time-warp mania would eventually be crowned as the number one entry on Billboard’s Greatest Songs Of All Time Hot 100 Chart in November 2021 as a result of its breathtaking commercial performance and seemingly neverending list of records and accolades, dethroning Chubby Checker’s game-changing 1960s hyper-smash “The Twist”; truly the unimaginable occurring in real time.\n\nFor perspective, this is a 60 year period of American cultural power, its zenith coming some 34 years before “Blinding Lights” with the Chicago Bears’ domination of Super Bowl 20 in 1986, merely a year after Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide victory in that year’s presidential election; the apex of American empire and projection. Among its countless other achievements, “Blinding Lights” also enjoyed the longest ever Billboard chart run by a song to top said ladder, ousting the Obama-era Millennial national anthem of consumerist nihilism and head-blunting escapism, LMFAO’s 2011 barely-named, recession-busting juggernaut “Party Rock Anthem”. All of this achieved by a former Canadian street rat and sofa surfer, now officially ascended to pop ubiquity and mega-stardom.\n\nWhen the song’s parent album “After Hours” was unleashed in March 2020, it was released into a world where every rule had altered. It became the unintended icon of international desolation as eerie images showed towering advertisements for the record bedecking a deserted Times Square, the Crossroads of the World emptied of its usual vitality and reduced to a technicolour ode for nobody. This neatly encapsulated how things would progress for the next three months, as the album and movie pushbacks immediately began to ring in and the cultural sphere was frozen in stasis; here in the UK, the album charts were dominated by big-name compilations and greatest hits collections from across the decades as listeners sought familiar comforts and more calcified forms of nostalgia amongst an otherwise lightly-stocked market (intriguingly enough, this has continued to the present day, to a great extent). “After Hours” was the big exception, a none-more-major album release perfectly coinciding with the widespread imposition of unprecedented lockdowns, an accidental bittersweet-spot. It was The Final Album, and its stranglehold on radio, streaming and charts in such weird times told accordingly.\n\nThis commercial success was also richly deserved. “After Hours” contended for Abel Tesfaye’s strongest album to date, a tightly-sequenced cycle visually influenced by (and named for) Martin Scorsese’s imperial period and dealing very strongly in the strengths of its select producers, from the woozy psychedelic trap of Metro Boomin, which had never been utilised as progressively as here, to the nightmarish Balearic claustrophobia of long-time collaborator Illangelo on the title track. Swedish super-writer Max Martin’s three track run through “Blinding Lights”, “In Your Eyes” and “Save Your Tears” is incredible. The other notable name in the credits is Daniel Lopatin as Oneohtrix Point Never, under his OPN moniker. Here we can trace a cultural spiderweb which would feed heavily into The Weeknd’s eventual follow-up album, the seeds clearly having been planted on “After Hours”.\n\nPrior to the full impact of Covid-19 being felt, Tesfaye was already keenly portraying his vision for the album and his own rapidly-developing role as a performative curator, with striking turns at late night talk shows allowing him to realise the aesthetical and character-driven aspects surrounding the songs within. Undeterred by the new circumstances the record was ultimately born into, he fully embraced the opportunity to utilise space, isolation and emptiness, qualities which resonated thematically with his entire oeuvre of work, and seized the imagination of the song-streaming public with performances such as that at the 2020s AMAs and VMAs, the latter a dizzying “Blinding Lights” atop Manhattan, which it is not an exaggeration to call one of the most significant historical performances ever, an essential time capsule moment.\n\nRealistically, all of this was building to February 2021, as the emergence of numerous variants meant the pandemic continued to burn, the rollout of vaccines only then in its infancy. I mentioned the Super Bowl earlier and the capacity of that event to beam American soft power around the globe, even if through the use of a Canadian artist from within the orbit of its pop-cultural ecosystem, has only heightened in the intervening 35 years. Cue Super Bowl 55 in Tampa Bay, Florida, the lowest-attended Super Bowl in history. A less than half-empty Raymond James Stadium was the setting for the main event spectacular of the “After Hours” era, into which Tesfaye reportedly poured his own money in order to achieve the appropriate sense of scale. The disorienting, technically stunning show will once again be must-see viewing for any studying pandemic pop culture, its lack of guest performers lending it singularity and the hollowed-out stadium setting which comprises its unfortunate backdrop will hopefully remain totally unique. In The Weeknd’s trajectory this is a glorious moment, of course never to be topped in terms of eyeballs, and a logical endpoint for the promotional journey of “After Hours”.\n\nThe Weeknd’s place as the defining star of the Covid-19 pandemic is only cemented further by his newest album, albeit in photo negative terms. Conceptually, “After Hours” did already touch upon the idea of the transitionary. Moments such as the coda of “Faith”, a song which effectively strings together four differing choruses, particularly perfectly marry the musical and lyrical ideas of moving beyond, which the track subsequently does as it dissolves into “Blinding Lights”, that obvious centrepoint, though this wasn’t a clearly signposted jumping-off point. Nonetheless, The Weeknd’s January 2022 follow-up “Dawn FM” undoubtedly doubles down on the purgatorial, and on several of the artistic routes first burrowed on the previous album. Dropped with little warning at the turn of this calendar year, the record is more formally a concept album than anything previously attempted by Tesfaye, ostensibly a radio broadcast in the holding pen between lives, with Jim Carrey as the DJ. Max Martin’s fingerprints are once again all over the album and Swedish House Mafia are incorporated into the process, on the heels of their canyon-sized Weeknd collab “Moth To A Flame”.\n\nHowever, OPN is promoted into an executive producer’s seat alongside Martin, and this quickly shows. Tesfaye met Lopatin when appearing in the Safdie Brothers’ excellent 2019 movie “Uncut Gems”, which was scored by Lopatin. This relationship evidently blossomed through their aforementioned teamwork on “After Hours” and makes a lot of evolutionary sense for both men. On this evidence, “Uncut Gems” is the gift that keeps on giving, with Josh Safdie even appearing here on the interlude “Every Angel Is Terrifying” as fictional director Arthur Fleminger. The track teases the idea of a follow-up album entitled “After Life”, with Tesfaye having confirmed his vision of the albums constituting a thematic trilogy.\n\nOPN is an exquisite choice to soundtrack The Weeknd’s exploration of liminality, spurred by the pandemic experience. “Dawn FM” is a genre tour-de-force, more dance-heavy than “After Hours” with a delicious Daft Punkian sheen, a continuing sharp focus on synthwave, pulling further influences from across the spectrum in the form of funk, drum and bass, RnB, disco, electropop and city pop, among many others. Unsurprisingly given its themes and structure, it is a love letter to FM radio. OPN’s handiwork is thus tellingly evident, based on Lopatin’s own career. The cannibalising of Japanese city pop here evokes vaporwave, within which Lopatin was a kingmaker with his 2010 opus “Chuck Person’s Eccojams Vol. 1” a transcendent document of the movement. His work, while varied, has rarely strayed all that far from such resonances, with the 2015 masterpiece “Garden Of Delete” another white-knuckle ride through the detritus of pop nostalgisms. The trajectory from obscurely seminal wildcard works to ushering through the artistic desires of the world’s biggest pop star is sadly a little-travelled road, but it is an extremely inspiring one to observe in this context. Weeknd completists will also want to hear “No Nightmares” from 2020’s “Magic Oneohtrix Point Never”, another key entry in the OPN canon.\n\nThese stylings strike me throughout “Dawn FM”, which has an incredibly liquid, amorphous sound, its sonics seeming impossibly, mystifyingly malleable. This holds a mirror to the ideas behind vaporwave, specifically in terms of the reliability and meaning of memory. A track like “How Do I Make You Love Me?” seems to run at a different speed every time I listen to it, dependent on mood, time of the day and countless other variables. This is extremely thrilling and lends infinite repeat value. Some of The Weeknd’s strongest material is contained within, as recognised by critics, with the record drawing Tesfaye’s greatest acclaim since the visionary 2011 debut “House Of Balloons”. “Less Than Zero” is arguably the finest song he has ever written, the near-closer before Carrey ends the album with a gorgeous narration. “I Heard You’re Married” is a supremely-crafted pop song with room for guests this time, Lil Wayne slotting in seamlessly here, and Tyler The Creator of all people on “Here We Go…..Again”. “Sacrifice” is a vamping Swedish House-helmed vault which flips Alicia Myers’ 1981 hit “I Want To Thank You”, with the unusual interpolation of that tune’s piano melody into the chorus vocal.\n\nThe first track from “Dawn FM” to have mass exposure was “Take My Breath”, an asphyxiation fantasy indulgence transmitted from Planet Banger in the summer of 2021, lathered with climbing Giorgio Moroder beats and sweltering hooks. It felt of a piece with “After Hours”, but pushing unmistakeably into the beyond. Max Martin had done his thing on it once again. It drew acclaim, as has come to be expected. So then, how do we go about explaining a Billboard peak at number six, or a highest chart bow at 13 in the UK, both countries where “Blinding Lights” especially but indeed all songs untethered from “After Hours” were all-conquering? “Dawn FM” has followed a pattern of countless artists throughout the annals, achieving critical adoration but alongside some commercial regression. This should of course be contextualised in this case; the album capped the UK album charts but in the US, despite a strong start as expected, it could only find number two, held off the mountaintop by Gunna’s “DS4Eever”, which immediately seemed symbolic of its lethargy and lack of commercial stamina when compared to “After Hours”.\n\nPut simply, the world has altered once again. The pandemic is not over, but it looks a lot different in the middle of 2022 to even six months ago, let alone two years previous. In recent times, the popularity of the “Liminal Spaces” bot on Twitter has been no surprise, though it recently endured the inevitable backlash from hair-splitters alleging that numerous of its shared photos did not truly represent liminality, despite its hit rate seeming very stellar to me. Some suggested that academia was at fault for the newfound popularity and supposed misuse of the term, but this seems to ignore a sizeable elephant in the room. People see liminal spaces around them as en masse we have spent around two years teetering on some threshold of transformation, and the explanation doesn’t seem any more complex than that to me, particularly a genuinely universal experience which cannot be faithfully replicated. It is clear that The Weeknd understood this from the conceptual casing of “Dawn FM”.\n\nOne of the most impeccable liminal experiences available previously was engaging in international transit and airport travel. In a classic display of Crap Britishness™, one of the most enraging aspects of lockdown for the British public seemed not to be the restraint of lockdown itself, but the inability to escape the country at least once a year. Again, Tesfaye has attempted to tap a subconscious interest in and even desire for liminality, which has grown more potent due to events since the turn of 2020. Having experienced lockdowns effectively from the outside in the way he did during the “After Hours” promo drive, this is unsurprising. This very deeply submerged impulse harkens to a wish for transformational social change, which mass media and culture continue to bury with stunning efficacy; the revolution many anticipated as a result of the onset of pandemic, a supposed dry run of climate change disaster or a restructuring of social justice a la the post-war settlement on fast-forward, has never materialised, indeed quite the reverse. Everything is liminal in this seemingly endless era after the 2008 financial crash, the day-to-day evocation of the iconic Antonio Gramsci quote; “the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear”.\n\nIn terms of quality, the writing and stylistic routing on “Dawn FM” matches that of “After Hours”. The album is just as brilliantly realised and none of its ideas can be said to be underdeveloped, even if they are sometimes more fragmentary; “Dawn FM” whips through a series of miniaturised tracks shortly past its halfway point, granting constitutional distance from the preceding longplayer. The secret lies in the timing; much like the lifespan of “After Hours” is indelibly informed by the setting into which it accidentally landed, “Dawn FM” pursued conceptual avenues with expert subtlety, but into a world where the Omicron variant would soon be on the verge of at least partially burning out, and people had become tired of even acknowledging that a pandemic was ongoing. In this way it is always important to be careful what you wish for, just as British tourists at the time of writing are discovering what travel chaos truly looks like at the nation’s airports.\n\n“Dawn FM” is an excellent album and one of the year’s best to date; this is only an attempt to dissect its mainstream underperformance relative to “After Hours”. Between them, in these differing manners, they define The Weeknd as the Pandemic Popstar; as a mass culture we experienced this bizarre period of complete upheaval and uneasy boredom through the lens of his finest artistry to date. The long-delayed “After Hours ‘Til Dawn” stadium tour will finally commence in summer 2022, with the clear promise of continuing the showmanship and ambition Tesfaye evidenced throughout 2020 and 2021, culminating at the Super Bowl. I believe this will recalibrate the tracks from “Dawn FM” as part of the wider journey of the purported trilogy as a whole, and promises to jolt audiences into taking a second listen. The rest of the story is still to be written, but it would be hard to swallow if the conclusion is that this still-evolving coterie of music is preferred in isolation rather than communally.\n\nA certain streaming service(!) recently informed me of my most-played song of 2021, which I suspect was a runaway winner. “Unlock It” by Charli XCX lurks at 8th in sequence on the 2017 future-pop blueprint and perfectly-titled “Pop 2”, taking cues from Ornette Coleman and Refused in terms of prophetically named genre statements. A track buried away on an album more than three years old, in our age of relentless infotainment and wafer-thin attention spans, ought to stand little chance of burrowing into any discourses, but in some cases cream does rise to the top.\n\nCharli has herself acknowledged the cult fandom of “Unlock It” and its widespread perception, at least in the eyes of her fanbase, as her finest track, a reputation which has developed organically. This has been heightened and bolstered by the track’s popularity on TikTok, where a fine but inferior alternative cut, the Jeff Prior Mix, ranked among the app’s most-played songs of 2021 in the UK. Irrespective of this disparity in versions, my experience would seem to have been something of a universal one. “Unlock It” was already soaring when it took on a new relevance and eerie synchronicity during the deepest and darkest UK lockdown across winter 2020/21; certainly this was when I was most regularly hammering the track and dreaming naively of a summer that has yet to arrive, of parties as extravagant and free as those Charli has powered both her music and aesthetics on the basis of. Clearly I was not alone in that.\n\n“Pop 2” as an album opens an already acclaimed trilogy of records completed by “Charli” and “How I’m Feeling Now”, the album de jour of the original worldwide lockdown (during which it was recorded in self-isolation across six weeks). Only time will tell whether this output represents the apex of XCX’s oeuvre, though we hope not, but as an already adored trio at the zenith of the hyperpop sub-genre, and one which stands to enhance its iconicity over time, this may be the case. This is not least as Charli has indicated her possible intention to pivot away from hyperpop on the upcoming 2022 album “Crash”, with tracks such as “Good Ones”, the heavyweight feature-blast “New Shapes” and equally star-studded Jax Jones and Joel Corry collab “Out Out” all implying a melding of 80s synth-pop with the recession-era bangers of LMFAO and The Black-Eyed Peas, records Charli has not been quiet in her praise of. While the typically elusive and amorphous forms of hyperpop continue to bubble away, especially in crossover with the burgeoning digicore movement, it is also difficult not to view the tragic death of Scottish producer and seminal hyperpop idol SOPHIE early in 2021 as a curtain call of sorts.\n\n“Unlock It” is nothing less than one of the most thrilling, and therefore by extension best, pop songs of all time. It is anchored around its gleaming, sparkling synth line from Life Sim, a bleeping, sugared-up marble-cake melody which generates butterflies flapping like eagles. It is breathtaking. Overall production comes from major Charli collaborator and hyperpop overlord AG Cook of PC Music, who bends an exquisite track out of the sheer malleability of these components. The lyrics are luminous, a freak-sized funfair which repeatedly evokes white knuckles and deliciousness (“rollercoaster ride”, “cherry maraschino”) to convey the excitement of the pursuit of true love, the sort which brings out goosebumps and makes the stomach do bungee-jumps. This is in tandem with Charli’s other trope, besides partying, which is travelling by car; “passenger seat”, “got the roof down”, “when we pit stop”. Appropriately for a song this transcendent, the metaphor extends ever so slightly further on this occasion, with the song’s most beautiful lines; “I’m feeling like an astronaut watching the world/All alone, just you and I”.\n\nCharli’s candied vocals croon in so syrupy a fashion as to match the song’s subject matter perfectly. They are not shifted up into a hyperpop archetype on this cut, but nonetheless subtly conjure up the genre’s chief promises of possibility and transformation. The chorus consists of little more than the track’s title repeated, spliced, cut up and interlocked in a clickety-click reminiscent of the ASMR stylings of Lorde and Billie Eilish, only to a synthetic tenfold. Charli’s voice throughout is near-indistinguishable from that of Kim Petras, who, alongside rapper Jay Park, gets to appear here in central, if as mentioned somewhat obscured, form on a perfect, timeless track. “Pop 2” is utterly loaded with invitees to Charli’s circus, and “Unlock It” is no exception. The German singer delivers the second verse, though I had to double check this. For me, this can be portrayed as a neat, knowing hyperpop trick, but all the same, both artists can count their blessings for being here.\n\nAfter Park’s rapped verse, which is wisely economical in refusing to distract from the song’s central thesis, we reach the escalating climax of the track, which is a rocket ship aimed squarely into the stratosphere. You would need to venture back to post-metal’s early-century prime to locate tracks with as barrelling a denouement or as wide-eyed a sense of their own epic structure. “Unlock It” in fact contains a false finish, but more on that momentarily. As the hook doubles and trebles up towards a climax, this section commences with percussive synth stabs underlaying that unforgettable main melodic line. As vocals clamber atop each other, the sense of escalation is ratcheted up hugely by, first of all, clapping drums and then hissing noise and sirens; the melodies become increasingly fluttery and stargazey, the overall mix is more and more ecstatic by the second. This constitutes an incredibly powerful, awe-inducing stretch of guaranteed Stendhal Syndrome, the likes of which can only be afforded full justice by being heard.\n\n“Unlock It” seems to be over at a spritely three minutes, a giddy plunge over the horizon which should have you reaching instantly for the repeat button. This does not account for its gorgeous post-Burial coda, which takes proceedings closer to the four minute mark; the revivification of majestic melody, the disembodied pitched-up garage vocals floating free from the track which birthed them in a furious orgy of love and sonics, the pitch-perfect interplay between voice and percussion. This is an unexpected and excellent appendage to what would have stood as unadulterated musical bliss on its own, and worthy of the comparison to British electronic music’s greatest artist, in feeling if not in style, and it is indeed his significance as an indicator and barometer of how things “feel” which brings Burial his seismic relevance as a 21st Century artist.\n\nI mention this especially because it is when thinking about “Unlock It”, as I have done so much over the past 12 months, that this following particular quote from consciousness-bending British documentary artist Adam Curtis about Burial’s music often comes to mind. As this shows, Curtis is an unabashed disciple of Burial, whose music has liberally scored his astounding films, from “Bitter Lake” to “Hypernormalisation”, and the superb 2021 TV series “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”. Curtis opined of the visionary South London producer’s song “Come Down To Us”, arguably his very best work in an extremely competitive field:\n\n“It really sums up our time…that song is saying, it’s really frightening to jump off the edge into the darkness. Both when you fall in love with someone, and when you want to change the world. And it depends whether you can live with the fear or whether you really want the thrill of it. Or whether you retreat into the world you’re happy with….it’s the mood of our time that we’re waiting for”.\n\nThis is one of the best descriptions I’ve ever seen of “Come Down To Us” as a song, of Burial’s music in general, of the 21st Century to date and most probably of music, period. It describes what all of the very best music to be recorded, which is to say a vanishingly rare collection of songs, is able to do, including pop music of course. All pop songs should have no less ambitious an aim than to encapsulate such head-spinning, generational tendencies, and Charli XCX is able to stand as a progressive and forward-thinking act who has achieved this Herculean feat at least once with “Unlock It”. This is to say nothing of the now clear link between the Lana Wachowski speech famously sampled in Burial’s track and the direction and thematic content of much of hyperpop, which I will not explore further here but which resonates forcefully in this connection.\n\n“Unlock It” is explicitly about love, but all songs about love are about changing the world, and all songs about changing the world are about love. Curtis accidentally and miraculously captures that symbiosis with his words, and the way tracks which somehow hurdle such towering credentials feel to listen to; they create an apprehension which is life-affirming and terrifying, even on countless repeat listens. This is the magnetism “Unlock It” boasts and which will continue to pull me back into the song, through another lonely winter into 2022 and for as long as we continue to wonder when life might be the same again, if ever, but certainly for as a long as the hope and energy of adventure continue to blaze, however faintly.\n\nNia DaCosta’s slasher flick “Candyman”, a simultaneous reboot of and sequel to the 1992 movie of the same title, arrives on to cinema screens fully formed and awash with meaning and symbolism. Co-written by DaCosta alongside Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld, the effort is only DaCosta’s second directorial piece before graduating up to 2022’s “The Marvels” for her third, a now familiar fast-track route through Hollywood which will render her the youngest director of an MCU movie ahead of previous navigator of the same journey, Ryan Coogler. This buzz is notable given the stubborn paucity of high-profile female directors, and much deserved on this evidence.\n\nAs immaculate directorially as “Candyman” seems, it nonetheless bears so many of the hallmarks co-writer Jordan Peele has made his own across only two previous films directed in the shape of “Get Out” and “Us”, the former in particular a powerful acclaim magnet, the latter a somewhat underrated gem; most prominently, Peele’s vast subtextual architecture and his brilliance of pop-cultural touch. Like any horror film worth its salt, “Candyman” expertly confects its authenticity from a grab-bag of conceptual sources, made all the more challenging by its having to juggle many of the elements inherited from the narrative of the 1992 original, which was but one year removed from the magnum opus of this feat within the slasher and horror spheres, “The Silence Of The Lambs”. As we shall explore, it aces this feat on its own terms.\n\nThose devices from the original movie, be they based in storytelling or in theory, were already irresistible, and the new film sagely makes no attempt to step away, instead incorporating and sometimes flipping them to immense effect. The chief promotional posters of the two aforementioned 90s films are informative in this regard; “The Silence Of The Lambs” features a moth covering a mouth, the original “Candyman” goes with a bee crawling over an eye. Both are adapted from novelistic work, but utilise the potency of cinema to amplify the composite parts of their stories and surrounding media.\n\nThis is instructive as a general guide to film-makers, and horror-makers especially. DaCosta, Peele and Rosenfeld proceed accordingly. The original setting, Chicago’s infamous Cabrini-Green housing projects, is remixed through the lens of gentrification in the contemporary film, blending in sociopolitical context with ease. While the specific avenue perhaps goes underexplored as the film develops, it acts as an in for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II’s burgeoning but doubtful artist Anthony McCoy, and flows into a generalised soup of racial injustice, sat firmly in the movie’s crosshairs.\n\nAt a lean and utterly fruitful 90 minutes, “Candyman” is exquisitely paced and plotted, with nary a wasted frame. Those plot components really are delicious, from the moment the studio imprimaturs appear reversed on screen in foreshadowing reference to the centrality of mirrors in the Candyman story. The chilling, eerie opening credits are superbly scored, with disorientating, upended graphics paying tribute to the Chicago setting and the psychogeography of the story (and, indirectly, positing an alternate version of Wilco’s cover art for “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot”, the Marina City towers). These smile-inducing lower key moments are classic Peele cornerstones, from the man whose “Us” (and its trailer specifically) irreversibly repositioned Luniz’ 1995 smash “I Got 5 On It” as a horrorcore anthem.\n\nSome outlets, understandably drawn into Peele’s contribution to the film, billed “Candyman” as something akin to ‘this year’s “Get Out”’. While race is pivotal to the story, in structural terms this seems very misleading. “Get Out” was a masterpiece in the subversion of audience expectations; anyone who didn’t leave every item of psychological baggage at the screen door was liable to ride the rollercoaster. The film was grandly metaphorical, allowing for a useful degree of stealth in the promotion and plotting of the movie, but focused heavily on what can be broadly described as liberal complicity in racial oppression, certainly in a US-specific context. The ingeniously-titled “Us”, to take a quick detour, was contrasting; while race remained a part of the package, it was class, nowadays mistakenly much-maligned as a theme, and inequality which the film targeted in a decidedly high-concept but quietly intersectional fashion.\n\nThe thematic and narrative scaffolding of “Candyman” is much different to either film, and “Get Out” in particular. From the outset, there is an overtness of theme in the plotting which was absent from “Get Out”, where screenwriter intentions were deeply submerged. Abdul-Mateen is excellent as McCoy deteriorates into body horror while his artistic fortunes simultaneously threaten to prosper, as is Teyonah Parris as his girlfriend Brianna, an art gallery director, conveniently enough. Some of the most telling moments can be found between script lines, in the various conversational scenes between the pair, Brianna’s brother and various other associates, which reveal the flick’s worldview on race and art, unsurprisingly a key concern in the film’s scenes. Some of these zingers are as cutting as Candyman’s hook.\n\nThe same goes for dialogue between McCoy and the snooty, ridiculous art critic Finley Stephens, whose condescension is potently white, middle class and ultimately opportunistic, but representative of a world into which Anthony and Brianna are, in what seems a materially simplistic but spiritually destructive choice, hoping to advance further. If viewers find themselves pondering why, that is of course intentional; the question of whether black advancement through white structures of society and imagination can ever really represent emancipation is posed.\n\nThe film does therefore match “Get Out” in being largely concerned with the imposition of violence on racial minorities. The reflection of this in McCoy’s disintegration through his art, once he is exposed to the Cabrini-Green legend of the title character, is another delectable line of the plot which stands tailor-made for the hands of a director and writer pairing as glowed up as DaCosta and Peele are currently.\n\nNonetheless, as mentioned, the parallel is far from direct. By interrogating the role art has to play in ending black oppression, if any, “Candyman” toys tantalisingly with black guilt and complicity, potential dynamite for a scriptwriter, but handled sensitively here. The look on Brianna’s face as another gallery director soliloquises that the roots of her enthusiasm for hiring Brianna in fact grow from her partner’s rising stock after his works on the Candyman are connected to the film’s grisly murders is brilliantly shot and perfectly acted in silence, a thousand yard stare which encapsulates the complexity of their own relationship and the film’s thematic fault lines.\n\nThus, like the mirror images throughout “Candyman” which are imperfect rather than bearing the symmetry we would normally anticipate, the reflection some may see between “Get Out” and this flick is not sublimely drawn. The fact that this inversion of mirroring itself mirrors the content of “Candyman” is highly paradoxical, but we do not need to peer beyond the confines of this film to find another, more relevant example. The film is bookended by scenes of police violence and injustice against black people. Every instance of the story’s notorious centrepoint, that uttering Candyman’s name in the mirror five times will summon him, is coloured by his gruesome dispatching of whoever follows the instructions. The lone exception occurs in the climactic scene, whereby the fabric of this arrangement is completely altered. Structurally speaking therefore, via any of the many scenes in the film featuring a mirror, the work as a whole is littered with metonymy.\n\nThe final scene bears a more significant meaning in relation to the direct thematics at hand. The audience cannot be certain that the stated switch in dynamics we have witnessed is permanent, by virtue of the film concluding, although it does so in a manner which seems self-consciously ripe for sequels. We already know via the character of William Burke, the main conduit of information to McCoy and pitched perfectly shiftily by Colman Domingo, that the Candyman legend encompasses multiple iterations of the supposed monster, detailed visually and enticingly via shadow puppetry which seamlessly interweaves critical aspects of the original film. In one of the movie’s most important quotes, Burke states “Candyman ain’t a ‘he’, Candyman’s the whole damn hive”. This is delivered amid myriad explanatory twists as we approach the movie’s denouement, all of which embolden the considerable subtext of the story at a tornado’s pace.\n\nThat is to say, Candyman is representative of racial injustice and suffering at large. The ultimate call-back is to the character’s origin story, that of the 19th century artist brutally tortured and murdered for falling in love with a wealthy white woman. It seems incorrect to claim that the 1992 original was ahead of its time in espousing these themes when the Los Angeles riots occurred in the same year, but even for a tale as old as America itself, the lore of the Candyman universe seems to slot appallingly well into the young decade that is the 2020s, with audiences stuttering to catch up to the aesthetic and topical sequencing of the original in the years following its debut.\n\nAs ubiquitous an icon as Candyman is therefore rendered come the film’s closure, we can read much into the eventualities which unfold. The film is an interrogation of the reform cycle and its relationship with predeterminism. With the conclusion thoroughly subsuming our protagonists into the endemic savagery McCoy’s art looks to reflect and examine, the film asks whether legal mechanisms of reform are superior to violent ones, whether either achieve progress quickly enough and whether artistic endeavours have any role to play in the pursuit of justice, as well as whether any of these options or the outcomes of such choices are inevitable. The plotting of the film is undoubtedly cyclical, if we isolate the progression and fate of McCoy’s character and the way this relates to the underpinning provided by both the themes and the multi-layered narrative, a most sturdy bedrock.\n\nAnother keystone unveiled by the film’s development, in its final stages in particular, is the prevalence of unreliable narrators. “Candyman”, as expected from Peele, packs a certain degree of self-reflexivity, and is undoubtedly aware of the folkloric strands entangled within the various levels of its plotting. The importance of who tells a story and why is underlined very effectively as the story unfurls and blossoms, undoubtedly a pivotal point in a work which leverages the state-sanctioned killing of innocent black people as part of its didactic brew.\n\nMcCoy titles his first exhibition after learning of the Candyman yarn “Say His Name”, offering a mirror by way of invitation for the observer to engage with the art in a more immersive way than can be comfortable, with extremely bloody consequences. While we’re talking promotional posters, the new film’s art prominently utilises the similar “Say It”. The interplay between this element of the film series and the killing of Breonna Taylor by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky in 2020, which would (eventually) prove to be a major part of civil unrest around racism in the US and globally last year, seems inextricable. “Say Her Name” became the hashtag and slogan of protests against the slaying, another chilling, off-kilter mirroring linked to the iconography of “Candyman”. Similarly, having ventured down this street of thought, I was unable to ignore the similarity between the names of Breonna and the character of Brianna here.\n\nWhile some believe that the surge in Hollywood focus on American racism since the early 2010s is sullied by the obvious financial motivation of the studios, it must be contended that films as intelligently and pointedly drawn on the issue as “Candyman”, which in this installment bucks the trend of pointless remakes and toxic franchising, will remain totally essential for as long as racial inequality perseveres. With the wrong people continuing to tell the stories, that will remain a long time.\n\nEach weekly edition of the “New Statesman” is currently closed by “The NS Q&A”, a short interview with a celebrity or public figure, with the same questions posed to each of them. From time to time, as a form of calibration, I like to indulge in answering the questions for myself mentally. One of the questions which has constantly come back to me of late is the simple “when were you happiest?” While “right now” is a common answer, which might be surprising if not for the fact that the interviewed individuals are typically successful and seemingly well-adjusted characters, the answer which keeps creeping back to me personally is at the age of 8 years old. It’s a specific moment in fact; late 1996, sat with my Mam during the school holidays at Teesside Park’s cinema, basked in the technicolour opening credits of the Michael Jordan-Looney Tunes mash-up “Space Jam”, one of the quintessential 90s kids’ movies. To the sound of Miami bass group Quad City DJs’ bombastic title song, the smash-cutting creds spliced with triumphant footage of Jordan at his NBA-dominating peak were a wide-eyed jamboree, the ultimate pop cultural crossover from probably the biggest sporting superstar in human history, at his very zenith. As I shall explain, this is an archetypal example of how ignorance is bliss.\n\nIn hindsight, I appreciate the function of this sequence; to the very young and impressionable as I was at that moment, this was an irresistible transmission of the soft power of sports propaganda to simultaneously obscure and remould inconvenient truths into something more palatable. Irrespective of the complicated relationship Jordan had to race, as touched upon by lockdown’s excellently watchable documentary “The Last Dance”, the entire spectacle could not be a finer packaging of the American Dream as imagined at its most utopian. To 8-year-old me, the United States was the unquestioned powerhouse of Earth and its citizens enjoyed the finest lives imaginable, and we in the UK benefited similarly from being the nation’s best friend. Moments like this were what made me understand international polarity in these terms before any history book could truly help me to dissect the way in which this information is formulated and propagated. These are the seeds which sow Western exceptionalism and also UK exceptionalism specifically, and undoubtedly contribute to explaining phenomena such as the political upheavals of 20 years later; the relationship with the US as the average UK voters interprets it undoubtedly assisting to power the turn to Brexit, built on the idea that continental Europeans are ‘not like us’. The overarching feeling I recall colouring my childhood, against a backdrop of thrilling pop music, Hollywood productions and what might selectively be described as the peak of neoliberal politics all across the English-speaking world, Francis Fukuyama’s infamous “End of History”, was the feeling that whatever darkness might be out there, everyone in the UK and US would be just fine, eternally. It was almost Heaven.\n\nThe moment when this nascent worldview was shattered in my mind remains both with me and possessed of the utmost clarity; five years later, during the 9/11 attacks. I clearly recall coming home from school to the rolling news broadcasts and pitching out on my bike for a while, a feeling of sombre devastation prevailing, and the answers to what had happened seeming far beyond reach. It wasn’t quite an “are we the baddies?” moment in the style of Mitchell and Webb’s famed sketch, but it was that afternoon that I realised that I, and things, would never be the same. I don’t believe that even at that moment, I ever bought into the narrative which was subsequently used to justify the war-mongering which would so irreversibly undermine public trust in Transatlantic institutions. As unbearable as that roll over the cliff edge of history was, it did not feel, even to a 13-year-old me, like an unbridled evil had been unleashed upon the world. Like many, I wanted to know who would want to strike their most venomous blow against Babel, and why they would need to do it. I realised that whatever those reasons were, this surely could not be borne purely out of anarchy. Shade came into my world, as all notions of pure black and white seeped together.\n\nThese are questions of what constitutes society, how societies think and move and how certain people are drowned by them rather than being washed along with the current like the majority. To my mind, a cabal of angry, disaffected, overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly white agitators, both young and old, have recently worked as useful idiots in combination with an age-old ancien régime of press barons, financiers and their respective marionettes in politics and media (many of whom hold certain views for money) to fatally compromise the relative, communitarian stability upon which Western societies had been maintained, even if such underpinnings were in truth already reduced to a mirage by the Thatcher/Reagan axis and the unravelling of the post-war consensus, and even if electoral expressions of and support for this suicidal impulse have been enacted by a much broader range of Boomers at the ballot box. The characteristics of whiteness and maleness have also upheld among the wider support base for this politics of misanthropy, even as one scans the demographic chart for age and other variables. It strikes me that the most steadfast advocates of this model of chaos, which is nonetheless thoroughly calculated in its aims and spread at the head of this complex, socially incestuous serpent, are utterly ignorant as to the vast and powerful forces of capital, culture and ideology arrayed against them, blasting with the ferocity of a hurricane such that it is no longer possible to comprehend how those winds prevail against their own best interests as well as those whose interests they have been so effectively, mercilessly moulded to attack. It is a meticulously and expertly designed politics and public discourse of jealousy, hatred and division, and we’ve seen in recent years that it works.\n\nOn the point of gender equality alone, the sentiment is best embodied by the following quote from Scottish comedian and writer Frankie Boyle. While Boyle’s comedy once pushed at the very furthest limits of decency with jarring, blunt-force observations deployed under the guise of satirising and examining what we allow to pass for entertainment and culture, which were pitched marginally the right side of acceptability for me like so many of the very finest stand-ups have been, his subsequent blossoming into a much more trenchant and analytical political operator in the vein of his hero Bill Hicks has delightfully validated my long and exponentially growing fandom of his work. The following is likely the most beautiful and true statement I have seen him make to date, from his 2018 show “Prometheus Vol. 3”:\n\n“I’m going to tell you honestly what I think about feminism…I genuinely think, if you’re a young guy at the moment, feminism is the only thing that has a plan for you. Capitalism doesn’t give a fuck about you, materialism doesn’t really care if you live or die. Feminism includes you, and when I see guys, particularly young guys, attacking feminism, do you know what it looks like to me? It looks like when the fire brigade go to a really rough housing estate and they get stoned. That’s what you’re doing; you’re stoning the fucking rescue services”.\n\nSo this is where we find ourselves in 2021, as the plague years rumble into their second calendar, exposing every faultline our system, constructed by design to appear teetering to the many while remaining remarkably resistant to reform or change at the expense of the elite situated at its apex, is nevertheless built so precariously atop; at the confluence of a so-called society where hoping for a progressive, meaningful, moral and righteous centring to life, envisioned and enacted in a harm-free manner, is obstructed and discouraged by virtue of its supposed and seeming unattainability, and of a capitalism whose main objective towards the average directionless young person, and males in particular, is to so aggressively sell the fantasy and ultimate objective of being a hip hop star (supplanting the previous fast-expiring rock star dream) or sports icon, despite the practical impossibility of such an eventuality (à la “Fight Club”, an often controversially interpreted movie which first informed my understanding of cinema as art, and which I have always since held close to my heart as a liberal, empathetic, philosophy-shaping, anti-capitalist lodestar, in sharp contrast to the many apparently reactionary ideologies some attribute to the film and its fans).\n\nCompassion is an increasingly elusive quality these days, but I understand how misguided young men in particular end up in such disastrous predicaments, despite the genuinely dangerous poison spouted by the people I am thinking of, when only two potential trajectories seem to loom ahead. The first is a pointless existence slowly fizzling out, which undoubtedly drives people into the warped, conspiratorial communities which are driving contemporary conjecture and political outcomes to an ever-growing extent, especially in the US, where the homegrown “Paranoid Style” of politics described by Richard Hofstadter has barely ever seemed as prominent. The other is perishing more suddenly in some unimaginable, unanticipated, inconceivable historical event where multiple strands of our twisted, seemingly uncontrollable narratives collide so ground-shakingly. To this day I cannot gaze upon a gorgeous, cloudless blue sky without being reminded of the same New York horizon violated so horrendously that morning in September 2001.\n\nMany people, the majority in fact, reconcile the aforementioned reality with their everyday lives and spend their time as happy and contented as they can, which I admire. Having peered through the looking glass and seen what I’ve observed, I can’t imagine ever being able to do this the way I did when I was 8 years old, under the glare of perhaps the greatest sports legend of all time, the Looney Tunes and a mighty empire of agitprop broadcasting its messages so brilliantly. That perception, to me, is the real black-pill, and it rejects all misogyny, racism, homophobia, inequality and hate of any kind, while embracing hope in the face of stupefyingly long odds. Things have flipped significantly in 24 years, and this is what “Space Jam” will always surprisingly evoke to me.\n\n10. Beyoncé\n\nQueen Bey had the universe of commercial singles locked down before morphing into an outstanding album artist with “Beyoncé” (2013) and the epochal pop album “Lemonade” (2016). Despite that, her 2018 Coachella-headline show and the accompanying all-time great concert movie “Homecoming” are merely her most recent volcanic apogee. We just welcomed her back into active public consciousness with the rocket-powered Juneteenth smash “Black Parade”.\n\nMost recent: “Lemonade” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Beyoncé” (2013)\n\n9. Frank Ocean\n\nA one-album superstar after “Channel Orange”, Frank outdid himself with 2016’s spectacular bedroom RnB fantasia “Blonde”. Nobody charts the mountain ranges of Millennial relationships with such devastating, surgical insight, across a gold rush of sublimely crafted pop, soul and rhythm and blues songs with a decisive indie flair. An utterly elusive live act who seems currently settled on an evolving puzzlebox of single releases, Frank continues to be a beautiful phenom.\n\nMost recent: “Blonde” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Channel Orange” (2012)\n\n8. Deftones\n\nThe dream-weaving Sacramento alt-metallers peacock their myriad influences and are poster boys for the tentative critical reassessment of nu-metal currently gathering steam, but ejected from the genre’s orbit way back with their 2000 classic “White Pony”. The 2010s saw them release three albums comprising their finest work to date. No other metal band can quite match the aerodynamics of Stephen Carpenter’s guitar playing or Chino Moreno’s impassioned vocals.\n\nMost recent: “Gore” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “White Pony” (2000)\n\n7. Bon Iver\n\nJustin Vernon has well-established pedigree for melding the sacred with the supposedly tasteless, seamlessly marrying Autotune and yacht rock to the unlikely realms of indie folk and art rock before anyone else dared. It doesn’t hurt that he is a once-in-a-generation songwriter with an inimitable ability to bend the very contours of what constitutes a melody or a song and is on an increasingly expressionistic streak of album writing most recently extended by the jigsaw-esque “i,i”.\n\nMost recent: “i,i” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “22, A Million” (2016)\n\n6. Death Grips\n\nNobody else has sounded like the first truly futuristic band of the 21st Century since they blasted out of Sacramento in the early 2010s as the most profound cultural response to the nightmare of late capitalism. Providing vital reworkings of punk and hip hop simultaneously, with a trenchantly electronic focus, and the source of a veritable production line of music lore memes replicating like grey goo, Death Grips are the leaders of a Transatlantic collective of acts proving that angry men need not be regressive.\n\nMost recent: “Year Of The Snitch” (2018)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “The Money Store” (2012)\n\n5. Lana Del Rey\n\nThe critically deified “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” is the culmination of a decade of work from Del Rey flavoured with literary aspiration and interrogating the exceptionally dark side lurking behind chocolate box Americana. Del Rey’s magnum opus, marking her out as the nation’s finest songwriter, is a fascinating, multi-storey character study which delves into a national psychology and finds a dysfunctional America which is perpetually 33 years old.\n\nMost recent: “Lust For Life” (2017)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” (2019)\n\n4. The Hotelier\n\nAt the vanguard of the 2010s emo revival, these Worcester, Massachusetts upstarts exclusively craft life-affirming, emotionally turbulent rock music. In an era where guitars have been largely eschewed in popular music, “Home, Like Noplace Is There” (2014) and “Goodness” (2016) are rare gemstones of a contemporary folk mythology constellating across white suburbia. The Hotelier are the finest band in the United States of America.\n\nMost recent: “Goodness” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Home, Like Noplace Is There” (2014)\n\n3. The Weeknd\n\nSince emerging with a store-ready mystique on 2011’s “House of Balloons”, Scarborough, Ontario’s Dark Knight has elevated the fusion of musicality and aesthetics to unrivalled heights, remunerated with a dominant chart presence. The ever-woozy, cinema-indebted “After Hours”, the international smash hit album of the Covid-19 pandemic, is his best work yet, finally locating a slippery sweet spot between 80s pop nostalgia and the multi-suite darkwave RnB which minted his name.\n\nMost recent: “After Hours” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “House Of Balloons” (2011)\n\n2. The 1975\n\nMore than any other act, The 1975 have articulated the way digital culture has influenced reality and vice versa; the unspeakable synthesis. As if harnessing a sonic singularity, the band seems kitted out to plug into genres at will without ever losing fidelity. Their supercharged fourth album “Notes On A Conditional Form” deeply explores the crossover between underground electronic music and pop while charting the band’s evolution into the world’s best. All three of their previous records are dyed-in-the-wool future classics.\n\nMost recent: “Notes On A Conditional Form” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships” (2018)\n\n1. Kendrick Lamar\n\nThe world’s foremost musical artist, having released the 2010s’ most acclaimed album in “To Pimp A Butterfly” in 2015, before becoming the first non-jazz or classical artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music with 2017’s follow-up, “DAMN.” Lamar then curated the soundtrack for Marvel’s ground-breaking “Black Panther” movie. To say we eagerly await the next step of a performer so expertly chronicling an era of such dizzying tumult from his lofty pinnacle would be some understatement.\n\nMost recent: “DAMN.” (2017)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “To Pimp A Butterfly” (2015)\n\n20. Travis Scott\n\nAs an artist, Travis has become a creative centre of gravity, filtering the finest contributions out of all collaborators. His ability to synthesise and refract influences and shades of detail have rendered his own albums exponentially superhuman, while his notorious live show, which went digital to wide acclaim during lockdown, further fosters a youthful solidarity and community from the jaws of the lurid debris of capitalism. He is now a fully-fledged crossover star, as evidenced by Rosalía’s current hit “TKN”.\n\nMost recent: “Astroworld” (2018)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight” (2016)\n\n19. Kanye West\n\nWhere to start? For seven albums across 15 years, West lived up to his controversial billing as a musical genius, constantly challenging audiences with the most sublime, trend-setting records in pop and hip hop. Few in history can claim to have influenced so many disparate movements and generations with every release. Recent albums, while still confrontational and surprising, suggest his exceptionally high peak is in the rearview, but he continues to shine sparingly as a producer.\n\nMost recent: “Jesus Is King” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” (2010)\n\n18. Tool\n\nLos Angeles alternative stalwarts Tool have been a towering act in metal and rock with only four more momentous albums since the 1993 debut “Undertow”. After a 13 year hiatus, 2019’s “Fear Inoculum” may feature the best individual work from all members. Over a decade, my doomed quest to locate the motherlode of Tool’s amplified aesthetic, summoned by guitar pyromancer Adam Jones, has sent me down a who’s-who spiral of seminal alt bands from Melvins to Helmet, Failure to Primus, and back again.\n\nMost recent: “Fear Inoculum” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Lateralus” (2001)\n\n17. Radiohead\n\nRadiohead would have contended to top this list for a decade or more following the release of the 1997 landscape-altering warhead “OK Computer” through 2007’s gorgeous “In Rainbows”, as they repeatedly released the finest, most fascinating albums in popular music, gateways to the experimental reaches of countless genres for generations of music fanatics. They continue to be compelling, appointment-listening every five years or so; true guardians of the form.\n\nMost recent: “A Moon Shaped Pool” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Kid A” (2000)\n\n16. Kate Tempest\n\nEngland’s Poet Laureate-in-waiting already boasts a catalogue of rewarding albums of steadily fizzing musicality and playful, rhythmic wordplay, but to call her such assumes anything other than disdain for establishment. Contrarily, Tempest yearningly rues societal decay at every turn. 2019’s “The Book Of Traps & Lessons” is a masterpiece of engaging musical scores and barely-veiled Brexit metaphors, climaxing in the devastating career-best crossover “People’s Faces”.\n\nMost recent: “The Book Of Traps & Lessons” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Let Them Eat Chaos” (2016)\n\n15. Lil Uzi Vert\n\nLil Uzi has risen to the apex of a group of exciting young rap artists blurring the lines between hip hop, pop, rock and emo, partly because most of the others died before reaching 22. That said, his hyperspeed, technicolour “Eternal Atake” and the accompanying “Luv vs. The World 2” tape see him largely abandon some of those previous emotionally fraught leanings for a saucer-eyed freakout of breakneck rapping and accelerationist consumerism. The results are head-spinning.\n\nMost recent: “Eternal Atake” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Luv Is Rage 2” (2017)\n\n14. Sleaford Mods\n\nThe Nottingham duo’s no-holds-barred insights into austerity Britain are the most critical update to punk since it was first scraped off the walls of 70s London. The glorious alchemy of Jason Williamson’s excoriating, oft-hilarious lyricism and Andrew Fearn’s knuckle-dragging bass beats has hit enough chords to entrench the Mods as unlikely repeat occupants of the UK album chart top 10. The pair are indisputably one of music’s most essential, unique contemporary acts.\n\nMost recent: “Eton Alive” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Divide & Exit” (2014)\n\n13. Everything Everything\n\nManchester’s pre-eminent prophets of poptimism are quietly building one of the finest canons in contemporary rock-based music while subsuming influence from everything but. Brandishing a baton yielded by Radiohead, the band are fuelled by Jonathan Higgs’ ear for maximalist melodies and eye for a wicked sociocultural take to ram into his regularly madcap lyricism. These dispatches from the new model island are equal parts academia and dystopian entertainment.\n\nMost recent: “A Fever Dream” (2017)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Get To Heaven” (2015)\n\n12. Meshuggah\n\nHailing from the rich metal heritage of Umeå in the Swedish north, the progressive metal titans may boast the most definitively signature sound in all of music. Nobody but nobody sounds like the palm-muted landslides and polyrhythmic tidal waves of Meshuggah’s monstrous compositional mania. Pioneers of the djent sub-genre, their albums have been untouchable explorations of seriously deep groove and syncopated insanity for decades now.\n\nMost recent: “The Violent Sleep Of Reason” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Koloss” (2012)\n\n11. Björk\n\nThe chameleonic Reykjavik siren songstress is nine albums deep, and her most recent, 2017’s “Utopia”, may be her most blissful yet. Although she never truly missed a step, her recent partnership with electronic trailblazer Arca has, somehow, brought even more illuminating scope, panorama and scale to Björk’s experimentation. Hers is one of the most vibrant, enriching and consistent discographies of any artiste out there.\n\nMost recent: “Utopia” (2017)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Homogenic” (1998)\n\n30. Moonsorrow\n\nSince inheriting the folk-metal throne from Falkenbach, Moonsorrow’s colossal sound has outlasted major challengers such as Primordial and Agalloch and continues to withstand a spirited current attack from Celtic folk metal masters Saor. After so many years, their every album is event-listening for the extreme metal community, and all are unparalleled in scale, energy and vision; the very best band from Finland’s world-leading metal scene.\n\nMost recent: “Jumalten Aika” (2016)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Verisäkeet” (2005)\n\n29. Charli XCX\n\nWith her latest records of titanium-coated space pop, Charli is caressing and coaxing chart music into its inevitable future; party music aching with empathy and longing, its vulnerability candying in the breathless gaps between slamming production and digitally decaying vocals. “Charli” (2019) is her futurist pop manifesto, “How I’m Feeling Now” (2020) will be the lockdown album du jour. Charli has tirelessly written her way to the near-top and is hopefully just getting warm.\n\nMost recent: “How I’m Feeling Now” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Charli” (2019)\n\n28. Perfume Genius\n\nMike Hadreas has flown a flag for outsiders everywhere from the days of his lo-fi emergence a decade ago to 2020’s instant classic “Set My Fire On Fire Immediately”, which may cement him as the headline act of excellent NYC label Matador against stiff competition from his peers. Comfortable orienteering baroque, glammed-up chamber pop and smoky Zeppelin-esque segues in equal measure, this ever-improving indie helmsman is one breakout hit song, which nearly came with 2014’s “Queen”, from a surprising future as an arena act.\n\nMost recent: “Set My Heart On Fire Immediately” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “No Shape” (2017)\n\n27. Julia Holter\n\nLos Angeles-based Julia Holter was already one of America’s most exciting experimental talents prior to 2018’s “Aviary”, the multitudinous meditation on medieval memory which saw Holter carving out a liminal space even further down the evolutionary vein of irresistible avant-garde mined on 2013’s “Loud City Song”, after the more traditionally structured “Have You In My Wilderness” brought her a wider audience in 2015. All limits to her sound have now been shed.\n\nMost recent: “Aviary” (2018)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Loud City Song” (2013)\n\n26. Tyler The Creator\n\nTyler manifested a decade ago as an enigmatic but dastardly provocateur who seemed a bit lost for a couple of albums. Few have settled into a niche as comfortably as he now has. He could maintain a cult following for years releasing albums in the style of “Scum Fuck Flower Boy” (2017) and “Igor” (2019), understatedly beautiful records which repurpose the forms and techniques of hip hop to interrogate feelings and demographics around male loneliness.\n\nMost recent: “Igor” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Scum Fuck Flower Boy” (2017)\n\n25. Solange\n\nAs Beyoncé seemed to complete her conquering of the planet with the universally adored “Lemonade” in 2016, her sister finally harnessed her own talents into an opus of similar stature. “A Seat At The Table” deep-dived into the lived tribulations of black American women and gleamed with a nourishing, inestimably vintage sound which made it sound like we’d known it forever. “When I Get Home” (2019) continued the trend from a musical family we barely deserve right now.\n\nMost recent: “When I Get Home” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “A Seat At The Table” (2016)\n\n24. Converge\n\nThree decades in, the Salem, Massachusetts metalcore overlords boast a span of albums with which few can compete. Almost 20 years after their defining classic “Jane Doe”, they have continued to bolster their highly accomplished musicianship and increasingly thoughtful lyricism behind the twin pistons of guitarist Kurt Ballou, maven of frenzied, razor-wire guitar riffing and now a producer of immense clarity in the worlds of metal and experimental music, and extreme music pin-up and frontman Jacob Bannon’s seismic, throat-shredding vocal work.\n\nMost recent: “The Dusk In Us” (2017)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Jane Doe” (2001)\n\n23. Tame Impala\n\nKevin Parker (“did you know Tame Impala is just one guy?”, as the music nerd meme goes!) may once have been a rock kid but has now been fundamentally turned by his time deep behind pop lines. Tastemakers already couldn’t get enough after “Lonerism” (2012), and giving in to his inability to resist giddy, luminescent melody saw “Currents” (2015) turn him into a go-to collab for pop music’s biggest names. “The Slow Rush” (2020), an incredibly topical treatise on time, is all vamping, intergalactic beats and electronic euphoria.\n\nMost recent: “The Slow Rush” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “Currents” (2015)\n\n22. The National\n\nWhile hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio, big budget indie giants The National came to outstrip the false dawns of The Strokes and Interpol to become the definitive soundtrack of big city living post-9/11. Matt Berninger waxed lyrical about the glamour and boredom of young professionals before the band bottled a dusty, cinematic aura which flowed to some centre on “Boxer” (2007) and “High Violet” (2010). Their most recent albums more playfully stumble across a capacity to surprise.\n\nMost recent: “I Am Easy To Find” (2019)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “High Violet” (2010)\n\n21. Ulcerate\n\nThe New Zealand trio conjure up jaw-dropping power on record. Their sound is a post-metal melee, a big tent pitched at the atmospheric mid-point between death metal and sludge, with listeners liable to lose footing amid the technical and structural chaos modelled on the utterly disorientating innovations of Gorguts, Portal and Deathspell Omega and the powerhouse drumming of creative engine room Jamie Saint Merat. 2020’s “Stare Into Death & Be Still” may be their best yet as they play with increased melody to astonishing effect.\n\nMost recent: “Stare Into Death & Be Still” (2020)\n\nYou’ll also need to hear this: “The Destroyers Of All” (2011)"
