        "text": "Post by Erang on\n\nA sentimental note here...\n\nThis afternoon I was in a Dungeon Synth marathon listening (playlist: Elves&Dwarves, Gentle Fish Mumbling, Iamí, Barak Tor, Dwalin, RaevJäger, Valscharuhn, Verminaard, ElixiR, Wintercry...) and I just needed to express here again my love to this genre & music!\n\nTo me, the paradox of Dungeon Synth is one of the (many) reason of its beauty: as codified as this musical genre might seems at first (\"obligatory\" fantasy setting, same medieval sounds & chords, etc.) it offers in fact so many freedom for a musician that it's a real pleasure to create within it.\n\nWhen a new album or new artist pops out, you never know what to expect and everyone of them express their \"Dungeon Spirit\" with their own DIY sounds & feelings and a unique atmosphere... it's always a new adventure and a virgin territory to explore!\n\nThis is so refreshing and inspiring!... so I was wondering: what do you find in Dungeon Synth that makes it unique to you?\n\nPost by Ananoriel on\n\nThe whole atmosphere, it reminds me often of old RPGs I love to play. And it helps me a bit to escape the reality, to a fantasy world, or a medieval setting.\n\nWhat also is important in Dungeon Synth are the melody lines, they get often stuck in your mind. And it is very calming to the mind. It is not too busy, just more calm. Which can be enlightening when you are listening to metal a lot.\n\nPost by thekeeper on\n\nIt's kind of a difficult thing to pinpoint. Even though there is a lot of dark, dusty, ancient sounds in dungeon synth, a lot of it is very innocent to me. The vast majority of DS being composed by single artists in their bedrooms, letting their imaginations go wild, but still expressing specific emotions through such an abstracted fantasy medium (typically, some DS is less fantastical than others), is something I can really appreciate. Archaic and crude sounding keyboards, medieval melodies from games, books, and other records they admire, tapes dubbed from home. It's a warm sounding genre to me (even though winter-synth is a thing), playing with a melancholic outsider purity. This is why I typically like more lo-fi DS, you get much more of the personal feel.\n\nPost by andrewwerdna on\n\nOne thing I love (which I worry is changing) is that, more than any other genre that I've heard, you can almost always trust it to be made in good faith. What I mean by this is that you don't have to question whether the artist believes in his vision, because quite frankly what other reason is one going to make dungeon synth? It won't get popular, it won't make money, and it certainly won't get you laid. In fact, there's a good chance you'll release an incredible work of art and it will never get a single response. So, that means almost every dungeon synth album you listen to is loved by one person at least: the artist. Because these albums are made primarily for the artist's own journey, there is no pandering corruption to be heard.\n\nSo in short I'd say the purity of the music is what's most unique to me, it's sacred to me.\n\nPost by Verminaard on\n\nTo reply to you, Andrew, I don't think you have to worry about that changing -- I think that everyone out there who makes dungeon synth truly has a passion for it. Otherwise, why would they be creating music for this particular genre? As you said, this is not exactly a lucrative scene we're in here in terms of material profit, but it abounds in friendships and passion which is worth much more to me.\n\nTo answer the question for myself...well, I thought it would be an easy answer, but it turns out that it's actually not. I guess I'll say it like this -- I have always loved stories of fantasy. Stories come in many different types -- books, RPGs, and, in this case, music. Music is the language that I am most fluent with to weave my own fantasy stories, so that's what I use. I find dungeon synth to be a place where I can simply enjoy tales from far off realms and forget about the troubles of the world, just as I would playing an RPG or reading a book.\n\nEDIT: I'm happy to be in your playlist among such great company, Erang!\n\nPost by jondexter on\n\nI think this music holds true power and healing qualities within it for those whom know how to tune in to it so to speak - far more so than any other genre of music. I say this because to me it is literally the bastion of mystics - in fact as a genre i believe it is obsessed with mysticism. This is what makes it unique to me (and why I will always love it).\n\nPost by nahadoth on\n\nI am always interested in music with transportive qualities, or with narrative ones - a lot of styles can do this for me, but dungeon synth and its related genres does this the most consistently. I think this is the sincerity that others on this thread have talked about before - when artists in this style are evoking worlds, landscapes, scenarios, it is because they have a clear picture of those things in their mind that they're trying to convey through the music, and that is admirable and immensely satisfying. Plus, much of this music is relaxing, which is always a bonus.\n\nPost by Tyrannus on\n\n\"single artists in their bedrooms\" this is also an important aspect of this music to me as well.\n\nnon-professional people, alone, who express them through music...\n\nMy favorite genres all possess these qualities. DS, Black Metal, and Noise Music often are just solo artists working at home. I love it. I love this feeling! I find the work of solo artists recording at home is some of the most authentic music out there\n\nPost by Nacht on\n\nI actually stumbled across an article by Toilet Ov Hell from 2015 and I think the author put into words what I think makes this such a draw for so many fans of metal.\n\nTo many, dungeon synth is the embodiment of a critical tenet, once important but now long forgotten by black metal – the obscure; the enigmatic; the “underground”. To many, it is the last precious, unexploited kernel of mystique hidden between the rolls of black metal’s bloated, commercialized corpse.\n\nI love the feeling of just diving into this mysterious genre of music. I think there's a level of very genuine artistic integrity involved which is always essential for me, because no one makes or listens to music like this for commercial gain, or without really understanding the kinds of ideas that motivate it. Scrolling through blogs, browsing rough rips of demo after demo of cassette tapes released by mostly-anonymous musicians in the 90s, often hand-printed etc. That's the kind of genuine DIY spirit I adore.\n\nAnd of course musically, it just transports you away from the modern world, doesn't it? The good dungeon synth, anyway. It has a magical and surprisingly timeless quality to it.\n\nPost by lusitano on\n\nDungeon Synth always sounded to me as music that is deeply personal, there's often a sense of mystery to the songs, regardless of length. An aspect that seems to be almost entirely removed from the whole genre is, something as simple as money. There's no corruption, it's magical music that one person writes from the heart, and it's honest. Thankfully, it's also a genre that allows for virtually infinite freedom of creativity, you can do anything with this genre, a lot like you can do anything with metal and classical music, both extremely versatile genres. But unlike those two genres, Dungeon Synth possesses unparalleled authenticity like no other, you can bet that in 99% of Dungeon Synth releases, the author believes in what he did even if no one else does, and that is something beautiful.\n\nPost by Pilgrim's Shadow on\n\nDungeon Synth always sounded to me as music that is deeply personal, there's often a sense of mystery to the songs, regardless of length.

Since i discovered it, i feel as if i have another home to run, music so true, so pure, a place to escape the darkness of reality.\n\nIt influenced me, i know i want to do this music, it brought me a boost of inspiration, mostly in writing (and D&D of course ).\n\nI never heared such pure expression in music before, and i am happy there is a community where all the people here understand me"
