        "text": "Since 2003, Brazil’s Paradise In Flames has been shattering boundaries and spreading its identity-filled sound infused with blazing notes of pure hatred to audiences far and wide. Their latest concept album “Blindness” is out on June 14th with its full stream premiere being presented now on Decibel Magazine HERE.\n\nCoined as extreme philosophical symphonic protester metal, they have been honing their identity since their 2021 album “Act One” and have matured and improved since then, intertwining Brazilian bossa nova and folk elements with a direct reference to forró (regional Brazilian musical style), death metal and black metal.\n\n“Blindness” tells the story of a philosophical work that portrays religion as a psychological illness, illustrating how men become blind in the pursuit of power. Lyrically, the songs revolve around a single plot inspired by the book by Jose Saramago. The musical structure creates an operatic scenario, where characters interact within a symphonic plot characterized by rapid pace and melodious themes. It is recommended for fans of Satyricon, Dark Funeral, and Batushka.\n\nThe band adds:\n\n“This album proved to be the most challenging of our career, as it required a strong correlation between the music and lyrics. The concept was to have one set of lyrics for all 11 tracks, ensuring each song had a logical sequence while collectively creating an engaging atmosphere to captivate the listener. We believe that we successfully achieved our objectives with this album. In the physical CD and LP versions, listeners will be able to enjoy following along with the lyrics in hand, allowing them to seamlessly experience the album’s narrative in its entirety.”\n\n“Blindness” will be out on June 14, 2024, and available from Xaninho Discos and Demoncratic Records.\n\nOnline Store – paradiseinflames.loja2.com.br/​\n\nBandcamp – paradiseinflames.bandcamp.com/​\n\nMusic Video – “I Feel the Plague” at youtu.be/gCyyhBABkno​\n\nMusic Video – “Concerto No 6. in C Minor, Cold Spring” – youtu.be/xENaiJEHDSI​\n\nTrack Listing:​\n\n1.
