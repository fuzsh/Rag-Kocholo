        "text": "Los Angeles quartet Death Valley Girls don’t fuck around. They’ve already released a fantastic full-length album this year (probably the best of their career), but apparently that’s not enough. The group have also just announced their debut tour of Australia—the greatest country on earth goddammit!—and dropped another spectacularly hypnotic single, ‘I Am A Wave’. If […]\n\nRead full post\n\nLiberty Hall House Party numero dos is right around the corner. On Friday, August 11th, a catalogue of the country’s best acts will descend upon Liberty Hall for an evening to remember. Catch live sets from Mildlife, Lazywax, First Beige, Morning Mood, and Lux Trevis, as well as DJ sets from Soju Gang, Bria, and […]\n\nRead full post\n\nYou likely already recognised Russell Fitzgibbon as the bassist for Babitha or as the taller half of legendary Sydney dance duo Fishing. Since the 2020 lockdowns, however, you’ve probably recognised him as Skeleten. Now, after a lengthy run of singles, we’ve finally been treated to Skeleten’s debut full-length, ‘Under Utopia’. Upon announcing the record, Fitzgibbon […]\n\nRead full post\n\nSo much music was written and recorded during the pandemic, it seems like a moot point to bring it up. In the case of Flyying Colours’ third full-length record, however, it seems important. This is an album marked by a sense of isolation and introspection; the capturing of a specific moment in time. ‘You Never […]\n\nRead full post\n\nGroup Therapy is officially in session. We’re beyond excited to announce a brand-spankin-new gig series that’ll be rounding up all the best acts from around the country to descend upon the Mary’s Underground stage. Bring your friends, bring your neighbour, your mum and dad, your bus driver, the bloke who ruffles through your bins looking […]\n\nRead full post\n\nLiberty Hall House Party is back, baby. In May, we hosted the first one of these things and it was completely out of control (if you were there, you know). We’ve been champing at the bit ever since to go again. On Friday, August 11th, you can catch live sets from Mildlife, Lazywax, First Beige, […]\n\nRead full post\n\nWhen I was younger, songs played in my dreams every night for almost a whole year. Research told me that the lyrics to these songs may be trying to uncover some buried feeling or subconscious message. I was told that only I would understand the meaning of these lyrics. All these years later, I still […]\n\nRead full post\n\nWe have a lot of great artists come through our venues, but we’ve decided it’s time to shine a light on some of the phenomenal support acts we’ve got coming up.\n\nRead full post\n\nNearly fifteen years ago, Melbourne’s Children Collide released one of the great Aussie rock albums of the 2000’s. Take a trip back in time with us and give this fantastic album its due.\n\nRead full post\n\nWe get some really great bands come through our venues; both headliners and support bands. The purpose of this article, however, is to focus solely on a couple of upcoming support acts we’re particularly excited to see. If you’re also feeling excited about these artists by the conclusion of this article, get down early to […]\n\nRead full post\n\nEach of Noah Dillon’s albums and EPs seem to capture a specific moment in his life. It’s understandable, then, that his debut album ‘Kill The Dove’ is a snapshot of life in lockdown, but perhaps more importantly, life in love. The discourse between these two themes—love and isolation—I’d say is the guiding force of ‘Kill […]\n\nRead full post\n\nI imagine COVID lockdowns really fucked with Crocodylus. For years, the band have toured non-stop around the country, putting on notoriously high-energy live shows, simultaneously releasing great EP after great EP. What does a band like that do after being told they’re not allowed to play shows or travel interstate? What comes of all that […]\n\nRead full post\n\nListening to Shannon & The Clams feels a lot like flipping through a crate of old 45s. The Oakland band mix doo-wop, garage, surf, psych and a whole lot of other things I don’t have the time to list, creating a sound that’s at once nostalgic and completely refreshing. Before they hit Mary’s Underground later […]\n\nRead full post\n\nDominic Breen has long been one of our favourite Australian songwriters. Standing alongside artists like Caitlin Harnett and Maple Glider, he features brightly in the — his words now — “constellation of Australian songwriters”. Before he shares the stage with these artists tomorrow night (July 7th) at Mary’s Underground for the first instalment of our […]\n\nRead full post\n\nIf you were to spend any given night in Sydney searching for the city’s hottest, most heaving dancefloor, chances are you’d stumble across Deepa. The DJ and radio presenter always has something on the go, and no matter what project she’s working on, you can guarantee it’s going to be great. Shortly before International Women’s […]\n\nRead full post\n\nZoe Catterall and Hewett Cook really nailed it when they settled on Green Screen as a band name. With their glitchy electro-pop sound, the group’s music will forever conjure images of cheap green screen graphics (example: the video for their debut single, I Am Boring). And as everyone knows, cheap green screen graphics rule. For […]\n\nRead full post\n\nOver the past number of weeks, we’ve been putting out a weekly ‘Lockdown Playlist’, where a bunch of our favourite Sydney musicians and characters have shared some of the tracks that helped them get through lockdown. But now we’re out of lockdown! In fact, this Friday will mark the long-awaited return of dancefloors. So, to […]\n\nRead full post\n\nIt’s another weekend in lockdown, but fret not! We’ve teamed up with the good people at Route 66 Newtown to bring you a playlist of tunes that’ll make life in isolation a good deal less shit. Over the past couple of weeks, King O.P.P (Straight Arrows) has had our hips moving with a selection of […]\n\nRead full post\n\nThe days are getting hotter, the nights a little balmier. Picnic season is upon us, and Sweetie have finally released their long-awaited debut single, ‘Boundary Queen’. Now, it’s likely coincidental that all these events (the changing of seasons, the relaxing of restrictions, the recorded debut of Sweetie) have so perfectly coincided with one another. But […]\n\nRead full post"
