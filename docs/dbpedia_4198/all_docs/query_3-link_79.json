        "text": "On Nov. 13, the world woke up to the announcement that André 3000 — the seven-time GRAMMY winning and 23-time nominated Outkast star — would release his debut (!) solo album, New Blue Sun, on Nov. 17.\n\nVia an NPR scoop, stunned to learn there are \"no bars, no beats, no sub-bass. André doesn't sing on this joint, either.\" Rather, the instrumental, 87-minute album is the culmination of a years-long preoccupation with various flutes — including contrabass, Mayan, bamboo, and a variety of digital models.\n\nAnd in their reactions, some of those fans spoke for all of us.\n\n\"Andre 3000 has about as much critical goodwill as it's possible to have and he is going to test every fiber of that collective empathy,\" one journalist and editor opined on X. Another music writer and editor chimed in: \"This is the tracklisting. This is going to mess up so many peoples' Spotify algorithms.\"\n\nAnd Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on \"The Daily Show,\" summed it up: That boy trained wit Pai Mei & got a Hattori Hanzo Flute. He ready.\"\n\nWith New Blue Sun on the immediate horizon, here's everything we know about it.\n\nIt's Built On Improvisation\n\nAs NPR points out, New Blue Sun materialized in part due to André's relocation from Atlanta — where Outkast famously hails from — to Los Angeles. There, he ran into the potent percussionist and experimental jazzer, Carlos Niño.\n\nAfter André and his flute began dropping by Niño's house for basement jam sessions, he was introduced to a whole new world of collaborators, including keyboardist (and Alice Coltrane disciple) Surya Botofasina and guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Nate Mercereau.\n\n\"We're listening to each other, we're responding to each other, we're supporting each other at certain times… it's kind of mirroring real life,\" the artist told NPR. \"It's a full living, breathing album because it's fully alive. We didn't sketch it out.\"\n\nThe Titles Are Absolutely Gonzo\n\nCheck them out for yourself:\n\nI swear, I Really Wanted To Make A \"Rap\" Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time\n\nThe Slang Word P(*)ssy Rolls Off The Tongue With Far Better Ease Than The Proper Word Vagina . Do You Agree?\n\nThat Night In Hawaii When I Turned Into A Panther And Started Making These Low Register Purring Tones That I Couldn't Control ... Sh¥t Was Wild\n\nBuyPoloDisorder's Daughter Wears A 3000™ Button Down Embroidered\n\nNinety Three 'Til Infinity And Beyoncé\n\nGhandi, Dalai Lama, Your Lord & Savior J.C. / Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, And John Wayne Gacy\n\nAnts To You, Gods To Who ?\n\nDreams Once Buried Beneath The Dungeon Floor Slowly Sprout Into Undying Gardens\n\nHave Gandhi, Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Dalai Lama ever appeared in the same song title? We think not.\n\nThe Album Title Represents Rebirth\n\nAndré described New Blue Sun's title in heavily sci-fi, yet personal terms.\n\n\"The next world or the next beings will be under a bluer, cooler burning sun. It will burn cooler, but it will be large,\" he explained to NPR. \"So when you look up at the sky in these times, there'll be this larger globe of bluish, still bright but bluish because it's cooler. It's kind of like this whole album and this whole direction is a new world for me.\"\n\nIt Represents A Culmination Of His Interest In Jazz\n\nIn said interview, André 3000 shouts out jazz/pop crossovers, like Dave Brubeck's \"Take Five\" and Chuck Mangione's \"Feels So Good,\" as galvanizing.\n\n\"As a rapper, I associated jazz music with old people and elevator music,\" he admitted. \"I remember that playing on the radio as a kid and humming the melodies. So I'm getting affected by these instrumental cats. And once I started really getting into it, I'm like, hold up: Jazz was the rap of that time.\"\n\nFrom there, he absorbed John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Yusef Lateef… the rest is history.\n\n\"That Night In Hawaii…\" Is About An Ayahuasca Trip\n\nYes, he really did turn into a panther… or felt like it.\n\n\"We did it like a three-night kind of phase. The first night was inviting and beautiful and the most powerful love and connection with all things I've ever felt in my life,\" he said — and the second was a different story.\n\n\"My stomach was hurting, my mouth contorted like a panther and I actually turned into a panther,\" he related. \"And I was doing like GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR — like, that kind of thing.\"\n\nIf you find yourself purring for this strange, lovely offering, check it out this Friday, and read the full NPR interview — and keep checking GRAMMY.com for more info about New Blue Sun!\n\n10 Reasons Why Outkast's 'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below' Is One Of Rap's Most Influential Double Albums\n\nIt's been more than 30 years since OutKast dropped their first-ever single \"Player's Ball\" in 1993 and on that track Wade's voice is the first. He sets the tone for the legendary duo's entire career and Southern hip-hop at the same time with the introduction: \"Man, the scene was so thick/ Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs/ Nothin' but them 'Lacs/ All the players, all the hustlers/ I'm talkin' 'bout a Black man heaven here/ You know what I'm sayin'?\"\n\n\"Rico Wade brought us to his house studio, where I heard the most interesting music production I'd ever heard from Atlanta,\" André 3000 told the Recording Academy in a 2019 interview reflecting on his experience working on OutKast's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. \"It was Rico, Ray, and Sleepy's vision to make sure [OutKast would put] Southern lifestyle first. I was just playing my part the best I could.\"\n\nOutkast's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik would go on to sell 500,000 records and became certified platinum within a year. \"When we were working on the OutKast vibe, even though there were two members in the group, we all considered ourselves OutKast at the time — including all of Organized Noize and the Goodie Mob members who appeared on the album,\" Murray told the Recording Academy in 2019.\n\nRead more: OutKast Examine Their Southern Experience On 'Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik'\n\nOrganized Noize signed a publishing deal with L.A. Reid and Babyface's label LaFace Records in 1993, setting the foundation for their work on OutKast's seminal \"Player's Ball\" single. It was a lasting connection that would serve the rest of Wade's career.\n\nWade would continue to work with Reid during Reid's tenure as chairman and CEO of Epic Records from 2013 to 2017, building a hub for hip-hop artists at the label including Wade's cousin, Atlanta rapper Future. Future would become the first artist ever on the Billboard charts to debut back-to-back albums at No. 1 with his 2017 release HNDRXX. In March, Future and Metro Boomin jointly released another No.1 album, We Don’t Trust You.\n\nWade nurtured Future's talents through his Dungeon connects. The two didn't meet until Future was well into his teens, but once they did Wade quickly put his cousin's clear drive and talent to use, introducing him to the Dungeon Family and bringing him into the studio to work on in-house production projects including Ludacris' \"Blueberry Yum Yum\" (Red Light District), which earned Future a songwriting credit in 2004.\n\nWhile significant attention was devoted to the celebration of hip-hop in 2023 — an acknowledgement of what is widely acknowledged as its 50th anniversary — another important anniversary in hip-hop is happening this year as well. Specifically, it’s been 30 years since 1994, when a new generation entered the music industry and set the genre on a course that in many ways continues until today.\n\nThere are many ways to look at 1994: lists of great albums (here’s a top 50 to get you started); a look back at what fans and tastemakers were actually listening to at the time; the best overlooked obscurities. But the best way to really understand why a single 365 three decades ago had such an impact is to narrow our focus to look at the important debut albums released that year.\n\nAn artist’s or group’s debut is their entry into the wider musical conversation, their first full statement about who they are and where in the landscape they see themselves. The debuts released in 1994 — which include the Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die, Nas' Illmatic and Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik from Outkast — were notable not only in their own right, but because of the insight they give us into wider trends in rap.\n\nRead on for some of the ways that 1994's debut records demonstrated what was happening in rap at the time, and showed us the way forward.\n\nHip-Hop Became More Than Just An East & West Coast Thing\n\nThe debut albums that moved rap music in 1994 were geographically varied, which was important for a music scene that was still, from a national perspective, largely tied to the media centers at the coasts. Yes, there were New York artists (Biggie and Nas most notably, as well as O.C., Jeru the Damaja, the Beatnuts, and Keith Murray). The West Coast G-funk domination, which began in late 1992 with Dr. Dre’s The Chronic, continued with Dre’s step brother Warren G.\n\nBut the huge number of important debuts from other places around the country in 1994 showed that rap music had developed mature scenes in multiple cities — scenes that fans from around the country were starting to pay significant attention to.\n\nTo begin with, there was Houston. The Geto Boys were arguably the first artists from the city to gain national attention (and controversy) several years prior. By 1994, the city’s scene had expanded enough to allow a variety of notable debuts, of wildly different styles, to make their way into the marketplace.\n\nRead more: A Guide To Texas Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Events\n\nThe Rap-A-Lot label that first brought the Geto Boys to the world’s attention branched out with Big Mike’s Somethin’ Serious and the Odd Squad’s Fadanuf Fa Erybody!! Both had bluesy, soulful sounds that were quickly becoming the label’s trademark — in no small part due to their main producers, N.O. Joe and Mike Dean. In addition, an entirely separate style centered around the slowed-down mixes of DJ Screw began to expand outside of the South Side with the debut release by Screwed Up Click member E.S.G.\n\nThere were also notable debut albums by artists and groups from Cleveland (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Creepin on ah Come Up), Oakland (Saafir and Casual), and of course Atlanta — more about that last one later.\n\n1994 Saw The Pinnacle Of Boom-Bap\n\nPopularized by KRS-One’s 1993 album Return of the Boom Bap, the term \"boom bap\" started as an onomatopoeic way of referring to the sound of a standard rap drum pattern — the \"boom\" of a kick drum on the downbeat, followed by the \"bap\" of a snare on the backbeat.\n\nThe style that would grow to be associated with that name (though it was not much-used at the time) was at its apex in 1994. A handful of primarily East Coast producers and groups were beginning a new sonic conversation, using innovations like filtered bass lines while competing to see who could flip the now standard sample sources in ever-more creative ways.\n\nMost of the producers at the height of this style — DJ Premier, Buckwild, RZA, Large Professor, Pete Rock and the Beatnuts, to name a few — worked on notable debuts that year. Premier produced all of Jeru the Damaja’s The Sun Rises in the East. Buckwild helmed nearly the entirety of O.C.’s debut Word…Life. RZA was responsible for Method Man’s Tical. The Beatnuts took care of their own full-length Street Level. Easy Mo Bee and Premier both played a part in Biggie’s Ready to Die. And then there was Illmatic, which featured a veritable who’s who of production elites: Premier, L.E.S., Large Professor, Pete Rock, and Q-Tip.\n\nThe work the producers did on these records was some of the best of their respective careers. Even now, putting on tracks like O.C.’s \"Time’s Up\" (Buckwild), Jeru’s \"Come Clean\" (Premier), Meth’s \"Bring the Pain\" (RZA), Biggie’s \"The What\" (Easy Mo Bee), or Nas’ \"The World Is Yours\" (Pete Rock) will get heads nodding.\n\nMajor Releases Balanced Street Sounds & Commercial Appeal\n\nIf there’s one city that can safely be said to be the center of rap music for the past decade or so, it’s Atlanta. While the ATL has had rappers of note since Shy-D and Raheem the Dream, it was a group that debuted in 1994 that really set the stage for the city’s takeover.\n\nOutkast’s Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was the work of two young, ambitious teenagers, along with the production collective Organized Noize. The group’s first video was directed by none other than Puffy. Biggie fell so in love with the city that he toyed with moving there.\n\nOutkast's debut album won Best New Artist and Best New Rap of the Year at the 1995 Source Awards, though the duo of André 3000 and Big Boi walked on stage to accept their award to a chorus of boos. The disrespect only pushed André to affirm the South's place on the rap map, famously telling the audience, \"The South got something to say.\"\n\nRead more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nOutkast’s success meant that they kept on making innovative albums for several more years, as did other members of their Dungeon Family crew. This brought energy and attention to the city, as did the success of Jermain Dupri’s So So Def label. Then came the \"snap\" movement of the 2000s, and of course trap music, which had its roots in aughts-era Atlanta artists like T.I. and producers like Shawty Redd and DJ Toomp.\n\nBut in the 2010s a new artist would make Atlanta explode, and he traced his lineage straight back to the Dungeon. Future is the first cousin of Organized Noize member Rico Wade, and was part of the so-called \"second generation\" of the Dungeon Family back when he went by \"Meathead.\" His world-beating success over the past decade-plus has been a cornerstone in Atlanta’s rise to the top of the rap world. Young Thug, who has cited Future as an influence, has sparked a veritable ecosystem of sound-alikes and proteges, some of whom have themselves gone on to be major artists.\n\nAtlanta’s reign at the top of the rap world, some theorize, may finally be coming to an end, at least in part because of police pressure. But the city has had a decade-plus run as the de facto capital of rap, and that’s thanks in no small part to Outkast.\n\nWhy 1998 Was Hip-Hop's Most Mature Year: From The Rise Of The Underground To Artist Masterworks"
