This ain't just about music, it's about history, culture, and a revolution that happened on the dance floor. The Berlin Mitte Techno collection delivers the iconic sounds and energy of the district in updated form, fresh for 2024. Back in the day, Mitte was ground zero for the techno explosion that rocked Berlin after the Wall came down. We're talking early 90s, when the city was a wild west of abandoned buildings and unlimited possibilities. The district was right where East met West, and that clash of cultures sparked something incredible. In the early days, it was all about that hard, industrial sound. Think acts like Basic Channel or Maurizio, laying down dub-influenced techno that seemed to go on forever. As time went on, you started getting more experimental stuff. Clubs like WMF were pushing boundaries, bringing in elements of electroclash and minimal. Techno hit Mitte like a bomb. Suddenly, those empty factories and power plants were pumping out beats that could be heard across the reunified city. Places like Tresor, born in the vaults of a demolished department store, became legendary. The sound was raw, industrial, and relentless - just like the city itself. We’ve captured that essence in hundreds of recordings of throbbing basslines, driving rhythms, hypnotic synth lines and, of course, the kick. Technically there are 30 unique kick drums in this pack, each one worthy of being heard non-stop on the dancefloor. The Ghosthack - Berlin Mitte Techno collection weighs in at 1.14GB and features over 750 loops and one-shot samples across 16 categories, 170 MIDI files, and inspiration for miles. With so many changes over the years, from digitization to gentrification, the district itself has transformed from what it once was. But the history is strong and the impact it had upon the music was forever. The sounds in this pack honor the history and continue to push this constantly evolving genre forward. Of course, all sounds in this pack are 100% royalty-free and cleared for use in your projects. Want more legit sounds from the most influential districts around Berlin? Look no further! We are proud to present our truly incredibly, and rightfully popular, Berlin Techno series. Each installment features the sounds of a different district that played an instrumental role in the rich and ongoing history of Techno music.

With a wide variety of keys, genres, styles and tempos ranging from 95BPM - 155BPM it has something for everyone. Each of these catchy melodies has an irresistible quality that is simply intrinsic to the fragile, ornate nature of the music box, a nostalgic life force all its own. The charming allure of the music box has everything to do with its inherent limitations. Like the incredibly small range of notes, due to its small physical size. The slightly elongated delivery of notes is difficult to replicate and lets the sounds hang in the air just a moment longer. The strong ties to childhood make this evocative instrument a bold choice in any arrangement and provides an instant connection for each listener, making it a bit more personal and memorable. With the Producer Essentials - Music Box Loops collection, you will bring a touch of whimsical, playful energy to whatever you produce. Easily at home in Pop, Electronica and other dance music, the music box is also a fun sound to isolate and use in sound design applications, producing unique timbres and tones that can be ideal for various Sci-Fi, Fantasy and even UI (user interface) SFX. However you choose to use the sounds in this pack, you can do so knowing they are 100% royalty-free and cleared for use in your projects - no matter how big or small. And before you depart, be sure to check out more of our popular Producer Essentials series.
