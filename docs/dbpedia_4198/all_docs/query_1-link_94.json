        "text": "Production duo anamē remix “Tears From The Moon,” Conjure One’s seminal 2002 track featuring Sinéad O’Connor.\n\nNo track pulls on the heartstrings quite like Conjure One’s “Tears From The Moon.” Sinéad O’Connor’s lyrics about love, loss and despair create a tsunami of emotion, while Conjure One’s simple drums and rich orchestra sound like heartbreak personified. When Tiestö remixed the track in 2004 he retained the emotion while making it dance floor-ready. Unsurprisingly, it became an instant hit and inspired thousands of producers – anamē included.\n\nanamē is the new project from Marcus Schössow, (previously gardenstate) and Thomas Sagstad. Remixing “Tears From The Moon” was a lifelong ambition for the pair, seeing as Tiestö’s remix was one of their personal anthems.\n\nThe remix is anamē’s third release on Anjunabeats, following “Influencer” with BLR and Robbie Rise and “Gratitude” in collaboration with Above & Beyond. Since launching the project in 2022, anamē has played at Anjunabeats Europe and Group Therapy Weekender at The Gorge, and supported Above & Beyond at their Gashouder shows in Amsterdam in May 2022. anamē are set to release plenty more music throughout the year and will be supporting Above & Beyond at Brooklyn Mirage on August 21 and at Group Therapy Weekender London on September 10.\n\nConjure One is the ambient, down-tempo project from Rhys Fulber, who is also one half of trance duo Delerium. “Tears From The Moon” was a single from his eponymous first album, and has 1.7m streams on Spotify to date. Sinéad O’ Connor is a ‘90s icon, with her 1999 hit “Nothing Compares 2 U” topping charts worldwide and reaching 232m streams on Spotify. She’s released 10 albums, two of which went Gold in the UK, and worked alongside global superstars including Prince, U2 and Massive Attack.\n\n\"Remixing ‘Tears From The Moon’ was one of the easiest choices of our lives,” says anamē. “We both grew up listening to the Tiësto remix, and we wanted to incorporate that into our sets but in our own way. The vocals from Sinéad O'Connor just hit you right in the heart, and that's what it's all about.”\n\nConjure One feat. Sinéad O'Connor ‘Tears From The Moon’ (anamē Remix) is out now on Anjunabeats."
