        "text": "Church Road Records have followed the progress of LA alt-rock quartet, Iress, for some time, and it’s clear that signing them to their label is a highlight for their staff. We know that co-founders, Sammy Urwin and Justine Jones, like three things – extreme metal, metallic hardcore and shoegaze. For every death-doom, black or prog metal artist, you’ll find something more ethereal and sorrowful. After all, this is a label that hosts hardcore death metallers, Burner, and New Zealand post-punk quartet, Landlords.\n\nGiven the resurgence of shoegaze over the last fifteen years, it becomes harder to find anything interesting in this renaissance, especially among those that cite Deafheaven as an influence. Iress are one such band, but you’ll find nothing to dislike in their new album. In fact, it might annoy you how good they are if you’ve already decided to write them off as another doomgaze experiment for NME elitists and subscribers to The Guardian newspaper.\n\nIress tease you into a solipsistic dream as soon as Michelle Malley’s introspective vocals and the electric guitars enter after twenty seconds of light bass strumming in opener, ‘Falling’. Words soothe and sever from their meanings like splitting dew drops. The vocal lines are pleasant but tinged with an undefined sorrow. Music like this can be relaxing despite the distorted guitars and intangible chord shapes. An accompanying video showing the slow metamorphosis of a butterfly would be ideal. Everything seems to be in harmony without a conscious effort. Observe how the longing in the lyrics match the mood of the instrumentation: “Always waiting for you to call my name / Always waiting for you / You say you will, you won’t / You push and you pull.”\n\nOf course, we’ve heard the great paradox of this record in shoegaze and in the alternative rock of the Smashing Pumpkins. Seething guitars contrast with a tone and tempo that venerates the simplistic beauty of, say, snow-covered trees or harmless sneezes in a meadow of buttercups. The verse parts in ‘Ever Under’ quieten the tempo with crystal clear drum snares guiding the direction of the words. “I can touch the pain in your eyes / I know what it’s like to be broken,” cries Malley. Much of this feels like a lullaby from a benevolent but sombre guardian who struggles to hide their burdens from those under their care. An analysis of the two guitar channels reveals some interesting mid-range chord-play and abstract pedal effects in the wet humidity.\n\nThe blurry textures are a permanent feature of this music and can become oppressive if you let them affect your listening experience. So, don’t. Instead, follow the emotions of the louder dynamics and let these be your passages underneath the waterfalls. ‘Mercy’ is not too far away from the dream-pop-meets-doom of the new GUHTS record. A gentle breeze and a misty drizzle are all you crave in your autumn solitude. The peace of being alone is sublime in ‘Leviathan (The Fog)’. You don’t need human company to be content. Here, Glenn Chu’s rim clicks mirror the soft and vibrant beats of your heart. Malley’s words pine with tuneful regret: “Didn’t wanna go / Sick obsession / Didn’t wanna go / I don’t want more.”\n\nMichelle Malley knows how to unleash a brooding chorus at just the right time, but you need to be in a melancholy mood to get the most out of this form of art. ‘Lovely (Forget Me Not)’ is like The Sundays with intrusive electric guitars and the sorrowful fairyland melodies of Cocteau Twins. The debut Curve album feels more important than ever after thirty-two years. Those harmless whirlpools of melody emanating from the amps are easy to follow and appreciate. After all, this is just as much an album for guitarists who value the supremacy of textures over flamboyance and red emotions.\n\nIt’s not always dangerous to be in and out of consciousness – that’s the effect Iress have on you. Something as simple as heavy-gain guitars playing seventh chord shapes can be as soothing as a wet flannel to the forehead. But this record is also the band’s heaviest in their catalogue. Listen how the bass strings hang by the thread in their drooping encasement of the powerful drumbeats in ‘The Remains’. Here, Malley forces her emotions into an aching lament, dwelling on her words for a longer suspense than usual. A surprise growl of metallic guitars fights with a reverb-drenched arpeggio in the outro. Likewise, ‘Knell Mera’ evolves in the manner of a shoegaze interpretation of post-metal with luscious vocal arrangements that sparkle like empurpled petals in the early morning mist.\n\nThe albums you want to dismiss as overrated can be the most enjoyable when they connect with you. This is a prime example of the virtues of an open mind.\n\nLet the doom become your dream, Iress present lucid bliss with Sleep Now, In Reverse.\n\nLA doomgazers Iress have wandered the plains since 2010 becoming a force of nature exquisitely sculpting themselves within the shoegaze realm, with two albums and 2023 EP Solace to look back on with pride this latest effort executes a less is more approach with joyous results.\n\nIress are delicate and authentic in their presentation as vocalist Michelle Malley’s angelic drawl is a core element gliding and swooning with a heavy heart into the melancholy of opener ‘Falling’ in which a perfect tandem is formed with the bands Hum-like atmosphere. The swathes of distortion from guitarist Graham Walker are shackled to each other in complete understanding as we enter the eerie warbles of ‘Mercy’ with the moody and creeping toms of drummer Glenn Chu only to erupt into a menacing and devastating spectacle.\n\nJust as capable of being an effortlessly somber experience Malley’s vocals levitate during its slower passages to create ominous intrigue as the layers and textures weave together to enable the euphoric crescendos anchored by low end of bass player Michael Maldonado. Some remnants of more optimistic days can be found in ‘Lovely (Forget Me Not)’ as the instrumentals cantor with brightness into the albums catchiest melodies. Just as quickly as it arrived the optimism evaporates in an instant to give way to the more metallic elements of the bands repertoire as emphatic breakdowns are used sparingly but are all the more effective as the omnipresent Walker swells in and out of existence.\n\nLyrically left up to interpretation but no less haunting and evoking an eternity in mourning “You talk, mourn in my head” is an imprint left forever on the listener during ‘In Reverse’ as it fills the air with a crushing sorrow. The overwhelming emotional presence within the album runs deep and its difficult not to be hooked and let it carry you and even during ‘Knell Mara’ where Iress are at their heaviest and the doom influence leads the way the emotional intensity from Malley is not lost. Towards the end of this journey there is gravel and torture in the vocals, urgency in the instrumentation as if a body in its final throes before we are left with a ponderous closer, as if staring into a river of calm waters, seeping with reflection and anticipating an unknown future.\n\nAfter more than a decade mastering the swing of the heavy pendulum Iress build upon unwavering unity, group catharsis and an eagerness to make waves. Never more comfortable in their skin and ready to be welcomed and celebrated into the renewed and feverish shoegaze scene. Fans of Chelsea Wolfe and A.A. Williams should flock, because your new favourite band is on a plate. Be sure to catch them this August as they make a jaunt over to the UK supporting the occultist rockers Hexvessel which includes an unmissable performance at ArcTanGent.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nSleep Now, In Reverse is Los Angeles-based Iress’s latest inky, black pool of highly refined doomgaze. Distortion and chorus/reverb guitar effects jockey for position over the spooky contralto of vocalist Michelle Malley. While this hypnotic 50-minute dosage of dark thoughts and musings fills its genre-carved role quite well, it may not stir all of one’s senses.\n\nOn their second release for their label, Dune Altar, no boundaries are broken. There are no feats of intricate or mesmerizing songwriting. Iress doesn’t stray too far from their formula as Sleep Now, In Reverse marks their third LP. The formula? Lull the listener into a sense of eerie self-reflection via droning guitars, slow, no-frills drum parts, and softly uttered vocals – then slowly turn up the heat and distortion (but never the speed) into a full-body crescendo. “Mercy” and “Falling” are prime examples of this.\n\nThis general framework supports the whole album but there are some tracks that spread the talents a little more evenly. “Lovely (Forget Me Not)” offers some very welcome grooviness and serves as the stand-out for the album not in function but in form. The track was not a single before the album’s release but its broadened parameters make it the best on the album.\n\nThe most redeeming quality on the album, and moreover of the band, are the vocals of Michelle Malley. They give a chiaroscuro effect to the vast, foreboding landscape that Alex Estrada’s mixing establishes, where individual musical parts feel spread widely apart. Malley’s voice shines like a beacon through the dark. Sinewy track transitions tie some of the songs together and further service the themes of isolation and loss, particularly the muffled talking at the end of “Mercy.”\n\nLyrically Sleep Now, In Reverse is a series of inwardly baleful reflections. Remorse, regret, and pain line the halls of this haunted mansion. “I can’t separate accident or fate//Ever under gaze,” Malley croons on “Ever Under.” “Until you met me//All to forget me” Malley laments on “Lovely (Forget Me Not).” Under a careful reading between the lines, something that was once good has gone awry.\n\nMoments with truly heavy riffs like the end of “The Remains” or the beginning of “Knell Mera” are the chewiest bits on the record and they add some much-needed iron to what can feel like a rather anemic collection of songs. Glenn Chu’s drums open up a bit on “Sanctuary” for a very welcome texture change. The final track “Deep” does the same in a much more subtle fashion.\n\nSleep Now, In Reverse is Iress at their most distilled yet, but at times strays from some of the creativity and substance of their previous releases in favor of style. The result is still a well-crafted and very well-produced dark delight, but its bursts of energy are outweighed by their longer and less interesting build-ups. As individual songs, there are few flaws, but also nothing particularly memorable or engaging.\n\nIress have been working towards this album for a few years. Waiting for the rise of shoegaze to meet the acceptance of fans of doom filled metal. Now the time seems perfect. The stars are aligning, and the world should finally be ready to move them from underground Los Angeles band to well-known international act. Michelle Malley's vocals form the centre of everything on this album. The clever bit is that she pins it all together without ever feeling like she's dominating the sound or going OTT with her delivery. Please take note other vocalists, you don't need to bark, growl or bite to be the centre of attention.\n\nThat not to say that the rest of the band are just mere passengers. The entire Iress family is knocking out of the park on this album. The sign of a truly great band is knowing exactly what the required amount of presence or space is. On every single track there is a restraint shown that is the domain of the truly tasteful - take a bow Graham Walker (guitars), Michael Maldonado (bass), and Glenn Chu (drums).\n\nThis is not an album of bright moments or big singalong choruses; this is an album for people who enjoy melancholy and want to swim in the deep dark pools it can create. That's not to say it's an album that depresses you, as it's littered with so many moments of staggering beauty.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes Deftones tracks like Minerva and Change (In The house Of Flies) then this album is for you. Equally if you're coming from the more indie side of shoegaze, there is nothing to fear. The album delivers beautiful melodies over walls of guitars. The main difference being that the rhythm sections are punchier and more technical. By the time you reach the outstanding In Reverse, you can't help but feel seduced into submission.\n\nVERDICT: A stunning album with one of the most haunting vocal performances of the year.\n\n4.75 / 5\n\nAs dreamy as Sleep Now, In Reverse may sound, I'd highly recommend not sleeping on this one.\n\nIt's inevitable that, from time to time, some will want to take a break from the extreme end of metal and zone into a more relaxing state; one of the most satisfying sub-genres that helps us do this is shoegaze. However, there's also various metallic offshoots of shoegaze where our minds can wander and reflect (blackgaze for instance). This now brings me to the band in question, a US foursome named Iress that formed in 2014, who merge doom and shoegaze elements together, unsurprisingly resulting in a sound categorized as doomgaze.\n\nAt the forefront of blackgaze and doomgaze, there's an exceptionally talented group of female vocalists, with Katherine Shepherd (Sylvaine), Suvi Savikko (Shedfromthebody), and Kiki GaNun (BleakHeart) to name a few; also within this group is Michelle Malley. You could say that she's the beating heart of Iress, as her hauntingly soothing, angelic vocals really help complement the dreamy tranquil soundscapes we associate with this genre, but let's not forget the fact that this is a band effort, and joining her are Alex Moreno (guitars), Michael Maldonado (bass), and Glenn Chu (drums). This is the band's third full-length offering Sleep Now, In Reverse, which follows a reasonably impressive debut Prey (2015), followed by an arguably more impressive sophomore in 2020's Flaw.\n\nDespite Iress being participants in one of the darkest and gloomiest genres there is, with themes often reflecting on loss of hope and desperation, Sleep Now, In Reverse is instead a rather uplifting and embracing experience. Music-wise, the album builds on the band's previous record Flaw, released amidst the global pandemic 4 years prior, but throughout its 10 tracks there are powerful and memorable moments that outshine anything the band has released before. \"Falling Under\" sets the mood in swing, and straightaway Michelle Malley's voice soars into action; once again, her raw emotional performance remains second-to-none throughout, and it's just as impressive instrumentally. The rhythm section flows through the song, as the bass complements every powerful and decisive drum beat, and even though there's no fancy technicality or breakneck riffs to be heard, the guitar work really draws the emotion in through heavy, slow-to-mid-tempo melancholic riffs.\n\nThe opening track flows into the following one, \"Ever Under\", via an atmospheric bridge, and each song begins with a similar inter-flowing passage, so the course of the album doesn't in any way get disrupted. The rhythm throughout is mostly repetitive, often driving you ever deeper into an emotional hypnotic state, although there are moments in which the tempo slightly increases, as soft melancholic instrumentation occasionally unleashes heavy doom breaks.\n\nSleep Now, In Reverse could prove to be one of the best releases in the doom/shoegaze category this year; the flow throughout and in between each song allows for such a smooth and engaging listen. Instrumentally it takes you to places of self-reflection that can offer be both an uplifting and at times sorrowful experience, but the vocals remain the key element that helps bring the incredible raw emotion to life, making this one of the most captivating releases in both doom and shoegaze this year. So, I once again recommended you don't sleep on Sleep Now, In Reverse.\n\nReview Summary: nxt lvl doomgaze\n\nLet’s be real for a moment: to those familiar with Iress’ music, Sleep Now, In Reverse is highly unsurprising. For the past few years, the Californian outfit has been trading in doomgaze of a quality their peers could only dream of achieving, and this new album is no exception. It’s a deeply gorgeous if intimidating project, solidifying the band’s status as one of the most criminally overlooked ones active right now.\n\nBuilding upon 2020’s Flaw and last year’s all too brief Solace, this new record presents ten more expansive glimpses into Iress’ world. It’s the kind of album where almost every song could work as an opening or closing track, with several jaw-dropping moments sprinkled all throughout. Cuts like “Mercy” follow a traditional formula of carefully working towards a grand, explosive climax, but the way it explores several textures prior to such expected payoffs feels consistently fresh. The understated “Lovely (Forget Me Not)’ adopts a driving rhythm that persists throughout its many meanderings, culminating in a hauntingly layered sonic implosion that feels like a true disintegration. Similarly, “The Remains” embodies classic Iress-isms with its gothic-tinged, sludgy gaze, before erupting into an unexpected and delightfully heavy breakdown - a moment that makes perfect sense in spite of its sudden appearance. The band’s ability to persistently mesmerise and deliver using the exact same ingredients is a true testament to their songwriting: everything is engaging, unique, and altogether captivating. Interestingly enough, album closer “Deep” might feel least like an album closer of all songs present here, but earns its place in the context of overwhelming beauty: it’s a brief, pensive meditation on death that is almost scarily quiet.\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Iress without mentioning Michelle Malley’s vocal performance. As always, her voice is captivating: strained without sounding uneasy, a perfect fit for the gloomy, heavy tones all around. Every ambiguous, haunting word sounds like an assurance of total eclipse, elevating the band’s eruptions straight into the darkness of outer space. Perhaps for the first time, though, the surrounding soundscape is matching Malley’s timbre in effectiveness. All throughout Sleep Now, In Reverse, quiet parts feel tender and eerie, while heavier moments appear truly all-encompassing. “Ever Under” is a brilliant showcase of Iress’ enthralling guitar tones, while “Leviathan (The Fog)” exemplifies their ability to effortlessly conjure an ethereal atmosphere. The latter features some of the most wonderfully restrained instrumentation, and carefully navigates different, unique textures to achieve truly enthralling results.\n\nWhile all the individual elements of Sleep Now, In Reverse are excellent, it is Iress’ ability to bring it all together that makes this such a deeply excellent record. Its ten tracks are so much more than merely ten tracks: they epitomise an entrancing experience. Even though the band operate within some of the gloomiest genres around, this album is shockingly colourful. It explores tales of despair through excellent songwriting, tops everything off with production capable of taking expansive and restrained moments alike to the next level, and leaves before you know it. If Flaw were an ocean, Sleep Now, In Reverse embodies a mountain - beautiful if overwhelming from afar, yet lively and intricate upon closer inspection. Clouds loom, erupt and destroy, and we’re lucky to be mere spectators."
