        "text": "Tim Lefebvre\n\nThroughout his wide-ranging career, Tim Lefebvre has amassed a reputation for being one of the world’s most innovative bassists. The Foxboro-native’s creative playing style is an addictive blend of jazz improvisation, rock undertones, and electronic grooves that can be heard on his appearances on over 150 recordings, ranging from Grammy award-winning albums such as David Bowie’s Blackstar to the soundtracks of classic films such as The Departed. From 2013 to 2018, Lefebvre was the bassist of the dynamic blues rock ensemble Tedeschi Trucks Band, and he can be heard on their three most recent releases, Let Me Get By (2016), Live From The Fox Oakland (2017), and Signs (2019). Before joining the group, he worked with artists such as Wayne Krantz, Chris Botti, and Leni Stern. Now based in Los Angeles, Lefebvre is currently the bassist for numerous groups, most notably with improvisational free-jazz group Whose Hat Is This? and with his Blackstar bandmate Donny McCaslin. He has recently performed with Chris Potter, Jon Batiste and Stay Human on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Empire of the Sun, Carole King, Ben Platt, Knower, and Matisyahu as well. Lefebvre is also the producer for a diverse range of projects, which includes singer-songwriter Rachel Eckroth’s album When It Falls (2018). Through all of these experiences over the past two decades, Lefebvre has constantly expanded his musical artistry, discovering new sounds for the bass guitar and influencing a generation of musicians along the way.\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter\n\nKebbi Williams\n\nGrammy award winning tenor saxophonist Kebbi Williams is one of contemporary music’s whirlwind improvisers. The imaginative multi-instrumentalist/ composer/producer/arranger/teacher resists categorization. His innovative sound dives, blends and jumpstarts all music genres. Kebbi bends it to his will with his robust, distinct blasts. His playing and compositions create a sound that is uniquely and undeniably his own. Avant-garde jazz, hip-hop, Afro-beat, gospel, electronica, classical and fiery rock are all loops that Kebbi interweaves with passion and edge.\n\nThe Atlanta native received both an undergraduate degree and Master's in Jazz Studies from prestigious Howard University. At the age of 22, he won the Jazz Instrumental Soloist Category (college division) award from Downbeat Magazine. Kebbi launched his professional career as a much in demand studio and touring musician. Outkast, the legendary Donald Byrd, Cee-lo Green, Mos Def, drummer Jeff “Tain” Watts, Bilal, Oteil Burbridge, Me’Shell Ndegeocello, Russell Gunn, Julie Dexter and iconic Betty Carter are among the elite musicians and vocalists who jumped off of Kebbi’s unique horn. He is also an original member and presently touring for the sixth year with the Tedeschi Trucks Band (with whom he won the Grammy in 2012 in the Blues Album category).\n\nKebbi Williams continues to do what he has always done: break down barriers and push the boundaries with both his music and vibrant social consciousness for his hometown and beyond.\n\nMusic In The Park Atlanta | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter\n\nJJ Johnson\n\nGrowing up in Austin, TX, JJ was surrounded by a variety of music from the very beginning. He has worked with many notable artist and musicians including Charlie Sexton, Doyle Bramhall, Boz Scaggs and John Mayer -- who he teamed up with in 2003 for a 7 year stint. JJ does a variety of recording work as well in between these ventures.\n\nIn 2010, The Tedeschi Trucks Band began assembling their all-star eleven-piece unit featuring Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks. Laying down the groove for this amazing group remains JJ's current focus today."
