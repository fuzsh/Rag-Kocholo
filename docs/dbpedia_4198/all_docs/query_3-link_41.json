        "text": "slenderbodies makes music that feels familiar yet unique as well as hushed yet impactful. The Line Of Best Fit proclaimed that slenderbodies\n\n“conjure an immersive world” with their “genre-blurring” music, while Complex\n\nhas described their songs as “subtle but infectious,” and Billboard praised their\n\n“intimacy” and “daring.”\n\nThe next year, the pair returned with a second EP, and signed ‘fabulist’ to Majestic Casual records. Their career was truly set in motion as lead single “anemone” currently garners more than 90 million plays across\n\nplatforms.\n\nMax & Benji followed up with two EPs, ‘fabulist extended’ and ‘soraya’ which brought them to their 2019 debut album, ‘komorebi’ released via Avant Garden. Recorded in the woods of Mendocino, CA over 2 weeks in late 2018, the pair delved into concepts of life & death, and what it means to be the truest version of yourself. The album was released to critical acclaim in fall of 2019, with songs like ‘belong’, ‘moods’ and ‘arrival’ earning the album over 60 million streams across platforms.\n\nAs the covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the pair returned to creating music remotely and released ‘are we?’, which included collaborations with Crooked Colours, Tim Atlas and Joey Pecoraro. The album was their final release with Avant Garden as the duo parted ways and began to write their next release, which would become ‘simple shapes’, a 16 song full length record released in mid 2022 through Independent.\n\nThroughout their 7 years of activity, the duo has since shared the stage with the likes of Eden, Louis the Child, Poolside, Gothbabe, Big Gigantic (at Red Rocks), Still Woozy, Half-Alive, Passion Pit, PVRIS, Milky Chance. Max & Benji have also played choice festivals such as Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza, Life is Beautiful, Electric Forest, Okeechobee, Hulaween, Hangout, Lightning in a Bottle, Live Out. They have also embarked on sold out headline tours for ‘komorebi’ and ‘simple shapes’.\n\nNow, slenderbodies returns and invites you to immerse yourself in their fourth album, “the sugar machine” out this september. The indie pop duo, comprised of Max Vehuni and Benji Cormack, have spent the last two years exploring the wistfulness of lost youth, and the fleeting moments we pursue to try to feel innocent euphoria again. Dive into an energetic, euphoric and nostalgic new sound as the pair stretch their roots beyond the breezy, silky grooves of their original catalog.\n\nEnter “the sugar machine” and give yourself to the highs and lows of your own nostalgia, dream up some old dreams, and escape into the music.\n\nBrooklyn based, California native Tim Atlas has built a solid following for his unique blend of R&B, neo-soul, alternative, and D.I.Y. bedroom pop since the launch of his debut album All Talk! in 2018. Growing up surrounded by the hills of Silicon Valley, surrounded by tech companies, a career in music, he’s said, just wasn’t a norm. But, as he told the Line of Best Fit, despite this he was “surrounded by singing, either from his mum and her love for their karaoke machine, or his dad who led the songs at church.” Once out of college, Tim decided to properly pursue a career in music, starting off as a producer and offering friends and local acts his service at low rates before beginning to create and release his own music.\n\nHaving built up comparisons to the likes of Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Phoenix, and Tame Impala, he signed with Nettwerk, and released his acclaimed 2021 QUOTA EP that showed off Tim’s individuality as an artist who knows exactly who he is. After the release of his most recent EP, 2023’s Le Soir, Tim embarked on a ten-stop US headline tour, where he notably sold out the Mercury Lounge in New York, Moroccan Lounge in LA and Brick and Mortar in San Francisco. On tour, Tim has supported artists such as Jungle Giants, Magic City Hippies, and Goldroom, while his avid fan base has helped him garner over 150 million streams to date.\n\nThis new year sees Tim Atlas re-emerge sounding as energised and vital as ever. With promises of more releases and more international dates to come, 2024 looks set to be Tim’s biggest year yet."
