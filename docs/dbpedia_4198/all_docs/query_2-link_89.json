        "text": "2. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Gospel Train (1956)\n\nRosetta Tharpe is one of gospel’s greatest singers and one of the slyest musicians ever to strap on an electric guitar. Both qualities are on display in droves on this classic album.\n\n3. Sanford Clark, The Fool (1956)\n\nSanford Clark is a forgotten great of early rock and roll whose finest recordings merit a place in the pantheon beside those of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison. This compilation of his fifties singles is a fine introduction to his dusky, spooky sound: It’s rockabilly, not as sock-hop party music but as late-night listening for the lonely and lovelorn.\n\n4. Lou Donaldson, Blues Walk (1958)\n\nAlto-sax great Lou Donaldson’s album is the essence of the jazz-blues. It’s also blues antidote.\n\n6. Elizabeth Cotten, Freight Train and Other North Carolina Folk Songs and Tunes (1958)\n\nElizabeth Cotten played guitar so very right by playing it “wrong”: She developed her signature style by turning a right-handed guitar upside down and picking with her left hand. This great Smithsonian Folkways album, a collection of blues rags and folk tunes, earned Cotten many admirers and quite a few foolhardy imitators.\n\n7. Machito, Kenya (1957)\n\nAn Afro-Cuban jazz masterpiece. Perfect music for a Sunday brunch. Or for reanimating a corpse.\n\n9. The Browns, Sweet Sounds by the Browns (1959)\n\nThe records of Arkansas siblings Jim Ed, Maxine, and Bonnie Brown floated amiably between country, folk, and pop, but their sound was grounded in a musical verity: There’s nothing quite like three-part-harmony singing. For proof, check out this album’s opener, the Browns’ biggest hit, “The Three Bells.”\n\n11. Joe Tex, Buying a Book (1969)\n\nJoe Tex sang better than all but a few soul men and was funnier than the lot of ’em. This gutbucket-funky album may be his finest.\n\n12. Brigitte Fontaine, Comme à la Radio (1969)\n\nIf you think Gallic pop is one giant kitsch-a-thon, you’ve never heard musical Dadaist Brigitte Fontaine. On this delectably weird 1969 album, Fontaine combines chanson, spoken word, and avant-jazz, with guest work from the Art Ensemble of Chicago.\n\n13. Lefty Frizzell, Mom and Dad’s Waltz and Other Great Country Hits (1966)\n\nGeorge Jones was the only man capable of outsinging Lefty Frizzell, whose clear, pure tenor lifted dozens of songs up the country charts in the fifties and sixties. Frizzell could also do some things Jones couldn’t, namely write songs like the title track of this LP: a beautifully plainspoken ballad of filial devotion, guaranteed to put teardrops in the beer mug of any parent or child.\n\n16. Connie Smith, I Love Charley Brown (1968)\n\nStiff-upper-lip heartbreak ballads, from one of country’s supreme female singers.\n\n17. Bettye Swann, Don’t You Ever Get Tired of Hurting Me? (1969)\n\nWho hasn’t asked that question? But no one asked it better than the underrated soul balladeer Bettye Swann. Also not to be missed: the tender “Little Things Mean A Lot.”\n\n18. La Lupe, Es La Reina (1969)\n\nThe torchiest album by one of the great torch singers of her day, with elaborate string-swathed orchestra arrangements bolstering the telenovela melodrama.\n\n19. Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Volunteered Slavery (1969)\n\nThe jazz multi-instrumentalist Rahsaan Roland Kirk was famous for his brain-bifurcating (and trifurcating!) feat of playing two or more horns at a time. Volunteered Slavery showcases his staggering technique and his range: There are protest songs, whooping gospel testimonials, a Stevie Wonder hit, a blistering John Coltrane tribute, and, always, jokes—laughing-to-keep-from-crying gallows humor and the laughing-till-you’re-crying shtick of a natural cutup.\n\n20. The Velvet Illusions, Acid Head (1967)\n\nThe title tells the story: This is psychedelic garage rock, recorded during the Summer of Love, when drugs were really starting to kick in. Sample lyric: “In hippie town / Some wear no shoes / They have no blues / No love to lose.”\n\n1970s\n\n21. Cymande, Cymande (1972)\n\nYou may not have heard of Cymande, but you’ve heard them: MCs have been rapping over their funky drums since the dawn of hip-hop. But the British band’s debut offers pleasures behind break-beats. Try “Rickshaw,” a flute-heavy Latin-jazz jam, or the bustling New Orleans funk of “Friends.”\n\n22. Shirley Brown, Woman to Woman (1975)\n\nShirley Brown had a bit of Aretha in her: The woman knew her way around a heart-shredding soul ballad. The title track hit No. 1 on the Billboard\n\nR&B charts, but the nine other songs are just as tasty.\n\n23. Jorge Ben, África Brasil (1976)\n\nThe great Brazilian musical iconoclast delivers one of the funkiest albums of the funkiest decade in human history, with songs about everything from Santeria to sex, and—what else?—dancing. Rod Stewart lifted the tune for “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?” from Ben’s “Taj Mahal”; Ben sued Stewart for plagiarism.\n\n24. Keith Cross & Peter Ross, Bored Civilians (1972)\n\nFolk, prog rock, and jazz drift through nine beautifully melancholy songs by a pair of virtuoso songwriter-guitarists. It’s a high-seventies record that’s both definitively English and ersatz-California: a couple of Brits doing their quirky version of Laurel Canyon rock.\n\n25. Jane Birkin, Di Doo Dah (1973)\n\nSerge Gainsbourg wrote this album for his muse Jane Birkin, and it is unmistakably Gainsbourgian. Here are a dozen exquisitely orchestrated pop songs that are as witty as they are pervy, delivered by Birkin in her patented vocal style: a whisper that made every lyric sound like a salacious secret.\n\n60 Great Albums You Probably Haven’t Heard"
