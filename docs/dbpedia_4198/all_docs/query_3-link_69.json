        "text": "I posted this in a different thread but it was not on topic so I'm laying it out here as a formal challenge with several steps (Yes. I am going to make you work for it.). Ultimately you will either be proving or disproving my hypothesis that Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, and Nirvana are not actually \"grunge\" music bands.\n\nI've never understood classifying PJ and Soundgarden or Nirvana or AIC or Screaming Trees or anyone else in the same category except Rock. And that's just because of each band's choice of instrumentation (guitars, drums, bass, occasional keyboards), lineup, and arrangements (popular, blues based like nearly all rock bands). I'm fully aware of the stylistic difference demonstration in the documentary \"Hype.\" But using that definition, I find it applies to no one mentioned earlier (or other than some early Mudhoney). Certainly not PJ at any point in their catalogue.\n\nThe only reason I can see for grouping all of these bands together is because they share a common geographic origin. Not because they sound remotely alike in things like: production, vocal style, lyrical style or content, lead guitar style, percussion/rhythm style, etc...\n\nIt seems (to me) quite obvious that the term \"grunge\" is primarily used as a marketing term to conjure an image in the minds of consumers in order to sell products, rather than to summarize the musical content of a few bands' catalogues.\n\nHypothesis: Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Screaming Trees, and Nirvana are not actually \"grunge\" music bands. The term \"grunge\" as it applies to them was wholly misapplied.\n\nSuggested steps to proving/ disproving the hypothesis:\n\n1. Define \"Grunge\" as a musical style.\n\n2. Offer up quantitative evidence as to how this style is played by any of the aforementioned bands.\n\n2.a. Provide evidence in the form of a hyperlink to a video on YouTube (or comparable video site), reference to a specific song (s) and the specific moments within the song (s) when the aforementioned bands demonstrably play in the style you are saying can be musically defined as \"grunge,\" or some other quantitative method of providing evidence of your stance.\n\n3. Provide quantitative evidence that any of the aforementioned bands have consistently played this style throughout a majority of their career, thus earning the label \"grunge\" band.\n\n4.Are you a musician? Throw out some music theory! I'm not afraid to talk flatted fifths or pentatonic scale. I might have to ask some follow up questions, but I'll listen.\n\n5.Have some other way to prove or disprove the hypothesis? Lets hear it. I'm not promising I'll accept it, but if I don't I'll give you solid reasons why I wont.\n\nNote: If you're going to quote a book, article, webpage, etc... cite your sources like I have in the paragraph* below.\n\n\"...grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics.\n\nWould someone please define \"grunge\" for me. I mean in musical terms. Writing style/theory.\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge, accessed 5 December, 2009)\n\n* BTW, the content of this Wikipedia paragraph is bs and is unacceptable. By this definition, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Blur, the Gutter Twins, Smashing Pumpkins, and thousands of others would all be categorized as \"grunge.\" I challenge you to come up with something original.\n\nSo go ahead. Quote some Greg Prato, Clark Humphrey, Kim Thayil, Jack Endino, Michael Azerrad... Impress me.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nIn absence of proof that my hypothesis is wrong, I'm going to be unscientific and consider it to be unquestionably correct!\n\n\"A lot more people are capable of being big out there that just don't give themselves a chance.\" -Stone Gossard\n\nPost edited by Unknown User on September 2010"
