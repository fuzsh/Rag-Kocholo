        "text": "History\n\nAfter performing with them at the Roskilde Festival in 1996, Fulber left Front Line Assembly, and in pursuit of a solo career, set up a small studio in Amsterdam. The influence of life in Amsterdam and traveling to the Eastern Mediterranean created the concept of an ethnic ambient project. Soon after, a debut album was announced, though Fulber's work as a producer and remixer eventually pushed its release to September 2002.\n\nThe self-titled album was a fusion of the electronic characteristics of Fulber's previous work—keyboard-based, with rhythmic dance beats—and the influences of Middle Eastern music, which inspired ambient melodies more reminiscent of Delerium.\n\nA number of songs were more pop-oriented and featured guest vocalists, primarily Poe and Chemda, the latter singing entirely in Arabic. Sinéad O'Connor and Jeff Martin of The Tea Party were also featured.\n\nAfter returning to Front Line Assembly and Delerium, in 2005 Fulber released a second album entitled Extraordinary Ways. This album utilized much more contemporary sounds, including much greater prominence given to guitars and trip hop-like beats. Vocalists included Tiff Lacey, Poe (credited as \"Jane\"), Chemda, Joanna Stevens, and even Fulber himself (covering a song by the punk band Buzzcocks).\n\nIn 2007, Germany's biggest selling female pop star of the 80s Sandra Cretu covered \"Sleep\" as a bonus track on her single \"The Way I Am\".\n\nThree bootleg albums of Conjure One have been widely circulated, mainly in Russia. The first bootleg, titled 'Enigma \"Sleep\"', is the music of the first Conjure One album mixed with the first album by Enigma, the song \"Sleep\" is labeled \"Enigma feat. Dido\", etc. Reasons to Disturb is the second. Although it contains a few newer Conjure One songs and remixes, the songs are actually renamed versions of songs by Poe, Balligomingo, and Fauxliage, among others. The third titled \"Serac\" is a mix again of existing releases and other artists music mislabeled.\n\n2012 saw Fulber sign to Dutch dance label, Armada Music, the Amsterdam connections coming full circle, and work began on what became the \"Holoscenic\" album.\n\nAlbums\n\nConjure One (Nettwerk, 2002)\n\nExtraordinary Ways (Nettwerk, 2005)\n\nExilarch (Nettwerk, 2010)\n\nHoloscenic (Armada Music, 2015)\n\nSingles\n\n\"Redemption\" (featuring Chemda) Promo Only (2001)\n\n\"Sleep\" (featuring Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo) (2002) - UK #42\n\n\"Tears from the Moon\" (featuring Sinéad O'Connor) (2003)\n\n\"Center of the Sun\" (featuring Poe) (2003)\n\n\"Extraordinary Way\" (featuring Poe) (2005)\n\n\"Face the Music\" (featuring Tiff Lacey) (2006)\n\n\"I Dream in Colour\" (featuring Leah Randi) (2010)\n\n\"Like Ice\" (featuring Jaren Cerf) (2011)\n\n\"Under the Gun\" (featuring Leigh Nash) (2013)\n\n\"Still Holding On\" (featuring Aruna) (2013)\n\n\"Ghost\" (featuring Kristy Thirsk) (2016)\n\nCollaborations\n\nChristian Burns - \"Then There Were None\" (from the album Simple Modern Answers) (2013)\n\nRemixes\n\nP.O.D. – \"Youth of the Nation\" (Conjure One Remix) (2001)\n\nAlice Cooper – \"I Never Cry\" (Conjure One Remix) (2003)\n\nCollide – \"Tempted\" (Conjure One Mix) (2004)\n\nThe Crüxshadows – \"Dragonfly\" (Conjure One Remix) (2005)\n\nThe Realm – \"Lost in Space\" (Conjure One Remix) (2014)"
