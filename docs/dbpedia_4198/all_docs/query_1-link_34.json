        "text": "Biography:\n\n2022 marks two decades since Rhys Fulber took his studio life beyond the realms of Delerium, with the self-titled LP, ‘Conjure One’. Since, his longplayers under the name have been near clockwork in their timing and consistency. Through LP milestones like ‘Extraordinary Ways’, ‘Exilarch’ & ‘Holoscenic’, every five years or so he’s given discerning electronic music lovers something to listen to… and plenty to immerse in. While ‘Innovation Zero’s title is somewhat ironically self-deprecating, what cannot be denied is that Rhys found his niche in the downtempo arts. With next to no regard for clubfloors and a focus dialled into sumptuous mood & sonic tapestry, the Fulber you knew then is very much the one you have today. Across ten atmospherically-charged numbers, Conjure One places mood, ambiance and character before all else. With joined-up lyric writing from a small but dedicated cohort of vocalists, and technique, style & production system beyond measure, the thinking person’s music maker has done it again."
