        "text": "published on 2024-06-02T17:27:45Z\n\nThe final track on an upcoming album called 'death is just like falling asleep forever.' FL has the ability to separate stems from pre-recorded music tracks now, so I took its Ai to one of my favorite chillout mixes and fucked around with the acapella that it spit out. I went hardcore on the pitch shifting too. Sliced, diced, mixed, and switched the words around until some were unrecognizable. I then added some gritty 2step drums, some dialogue samples, and some plain old flavor at points. Story-wise, there are some gothy, vampy vibes on this one. A tale of a girl who pines for a vampire. I really like dark subject matter, so whether or not she makes it out alive is up for you to decide. I am but a humble storyteller. You can interpret this in whatever way you'd like. I really like how this turned out, but it sounds like shit on my JBL Charge 5. I'd definitely recommend headphones or a good stereo system when you listen to this. As always, thoughts are encouraged. Please leave your honest opinion!\n\nGenre\n\nTrip Hop"
