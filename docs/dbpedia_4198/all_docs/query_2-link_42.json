        "text": "LA Guns have the be the single most inconsistent band in rock n roll. The same outfit that delivered classics like their debut, Cocked & Loaded, Hollywood Vampires, Vicious Circle and Waking The Dead are also responsible for the turkeys American Hardcore, Shrinking Violet and the very average albums The Missing Piece, Hollywood Forever and The Devil You Know.\n\nNow have another absolute turd on their hands.\n\nWhen seeking to defend a particular sound or direction, I often hear words like raw, live, 70s infused, punky… I prefer a more direct approach – like unlistenable, demo quality and shite.\n\nIt’s not like all the songs suck, I’m really taken with the heavy ballad ‘Diamonds’ for example and there are some memorable hooks elsewhere. But it all just sound terrible. There’s some of the old school punky vibe of the debut and Vicious Circle in some tracks and some good ol’ LA Guns sleaze elsewhere, but the album is totally unlistenable. It sounds like an audience bootleg of a 1975 Sex Pistols show.\n\nThe mix is horrid, the drums sound like they were recorded in the same lavatory Tracii Guns recently played a gig from and the vocals are so hollow, its hard to imagine how they could be so badly recorded then mixed into the tracks.\n\nTracii Guns sounds like a guitar god on several tracks, he’s a class player; and Phil Lewis still has the voice, but hearing both at their best without risking permanent damage to your ear drums is just not worth it. This album cannot be played at loud volume. Or any volume really.\n\nAfter the debacle of the House Of Lords’ infamous ‘Power And The Myth’ album, the last record to feature the main names from the band, it must have taken some luring to get Chuck Wright and Ken Mary back on board for this pseudo-HOL project.\n\nAs is the case with just about every project on the Frontiers label, it is another Alessandro Del Vecchio produced and co-written affair. I know there are many avoiding these projects now and some definitely need avoiding. But this is one of the better ones.\n\nYes, the production and large parts of the songwriting remain formulaic and very familiar, but the performances within certainly raise the bar here. Not to mention there’s some decent songs attached to this project.\n\nA good part of what makes this album good is the work of Ken Mary. The added drum fills, the swagger around the songs and the precise percussion, especially with cymbal work is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThe great Jimi Bell is also a major contributor. His rifftastic work doesn’t often get the credit it deserves and he’s the perfect fit here.\n\nI wouldn’t call it a House Of Lords sounding project – despite the players and name – it remains another example of the label’s fondness for Euro-flavoured hard rock.\n\nVocalist James Robledo (Sinner's Blood) wouldn’t be my first choice for the kind of project. He reminds me of the ill-fitting Skills frontman Renan Zonta, except more likable. Again, it’s another Frontiers style quirk - that familiar raspy metal voice that they seem to gravitate towards. Guitarist Francesco Savino (False Memories) rounds out the band – House Of European’s is more accurate musical description. Robledo sounds best when he turns on the melody with his uncanny Jorn Lande impersonation at times.\n\nWorth checking out of the description appeals.\n\nAnd what is it with this ridiculous album credit that keeps popping up on the back covers of Frontiers releases - “A Project By Serafino Perugino”?\n\nTalk about strocking one’s ego. Not even the legendary A&R man John Kalodner: John Kalodner inflicted that upon the artists he worked with.\n\n“A Review By Andrew McNeice”\n\nBy now anyone familiar with Revolution Saints would be aware of the lineup change – Blades and Aldrich out and Pilson and Hoekstra in. Despite that kind of major upheaval, there’s not much difference here. The Deen Castronovo fronted project’s fourth album is more or less exactly the same as the last three. Except the songwriting has grown stale.\n\nThe music is still produced and mainly written by Alessandro Del Vecchio again, so you can simply exact more of the same again here. And that’s exactly where the problem is. The songs. They are just a repeat of the material available on the first three albums – right down to style, lyrics and sound.\n\nThe songs in particular suffer from a lack of personality. I’ve heard all of this before. Not only the other Rev Saints albums, but on Hardline, Sunstorm, Skills and any number of other ADV penned projects for Frontiers.\n\nWhile the performances within cannot be faulted – Deen sings with his usual melodic gusto; Jeff Pilson drives the rhythm and Joel Hoekstra shreds like the super-talented madman he is. There are some great solos here especially.\n\nBut the songs for the most part go nowhere. The first 3 tracks don’t interest me at all.\n\n‘Kids Will Be Kids’ has a bit more bite and a more memorable hook before the album highlight of the ballad ‘I’ll Cry For You Tonight’ and the darker anthem ‘Crime Of The Century’ add some spark.\n\nAfter that its back downhill to the usual fare and with it goes my interest in the album overall.\n\nIts simply a superfluous addition to the Revolution Saints catalogue. No growth or development in their sound whatsoever. And the fact two albums were recorded at the same time and a third is planned…leaves one wondering at what point fans will vote with their feet and walk away from this project.\n\nH.E.A.T ‘II’, perfection is thy name.\n\nArtists, bands, labels, managers, songwriters….listen up, pay attention and understand - this is how it’s done.\n\nH.E.A.T have thrown off the experimentations of Into The Great Unknown (which I still think was great in its own way), ditched long-time producer Tobias Lindell and gone all in-house for their remarkable 6th album.\n\nThe result is H.E.A.T ‘II’, an album that doesn’t just politely knock on your door, rather it sees the band roll up in a 49-ton bulldozer, run over your lawn, crash through the door and bulldoze right through your house and out the other side.\n\nThis is a no holes barred, take no prisoners, earth shattering slice of classic melodic hard rock, where every single element is simply perfect. And every element helps make the other aspects of the album sound even better.\n\nCrash drums like an absolute madman, his playing not only more powerful and bombastic than ever, but it’s also more technical and truly ear shattering.\n\nDave shreds harder and faster than ever before, making this the band’s heaviest album to date. Some of the guitar solos are mind-blowing.\n\nJona brings an equal dose of keyboards, helping balance the aggression with melody and adding several extra layers of ear candy.\n\nJimmy takes on his role with his usual dominant presence, grooving right alongside Crash as Scandinavia’s tightest rhythm section.\n\nAnd what can I say about Erik? We already know he’s an alien from a galaxy far far away, where freakish lung capacity and megaphone vocals are commonplace, but here on earth he stands alone as the finest rock vocalist anywhere. And here he screams, wails, harmonizes and produces angelic tones that every other singer should strive for.\n\nIt’s simply a stunning performance by Erik and the whole band.\n\nAdditional credit must go to the guys for the production and mix. If anything, it is even better than ever, they clearly learned a lot from their time in the studio and this record reflects that. Absolutely flawless.\n\n4 songs have been previewed in full, each one giving a solid indication of the rest of the album. There’s 11 ass-kicking tracks, the only ballad being Nothing To Say – a ballad so good it also kicks your ass. 11 tracks and 11 different vibes. Its very cool. It’s edgy, it’s menacing, it’s anthemic and melodic and it’s fresh.\n\nOf my observations on the album, it is worth noting that the songs all that have influences from the past, but also strike a clear new path forward.\n\nThe guys have used some different chorus styles and structures in places and while some of the choruses may not match the anthemic heights of Living On The Run or Point Of No Return, the songs actually deliver the knockout hooks in the verse or post-chorus bridge. It makes for a really interesting learning curve for the album, as the chorus is normally the most obvious point of familiarity when first getting to know any record.\n\nHighlights are almost impossible to spotlight as not matter what song you play last is the one stuck in your head afterwards.\n\nI do have a particular love for the hard edged fast moving Dangerous Ground; the classic Heat sound of Come Clean; the menacing We Are Gods and its brilliant post-chorus hook; the punchy multi-hook Adrenaline (with a nod to Eclipse’s Runaway in the chorus) and Heaven Must Have Won An Angel, which has a strong Brother Firetribe vibe to it. But that said, I now feel mean for not mentioning other songs. They’re all brilliant.\n\nThis review is way longer than it needed to be. We’ll cut to the bottom line.\n\nIt’s perfect. The easiest 100 I’ve ever given. Take a bow guys.\n\nThe return of Steve Perry is one thing, but the avalanche of publicity for the immediate release of a single and a full album due October 5, has been something else.\n\nSuch is the rarity of new Perry work, I have been writing for 22 years and only covered one new studio album – Journey’s Trial By Fire.\n\nBut here we are – Traces is the new album – a 10 track chronicle of Steve’s recent life experiences and a 15-track deluxe edition available via direct online or USA Target stores. This is a review of the standard/international edition. It will be updated with word on the additional 5 tracks ASAP.\n\nTo many – me included – Steve Perry is the voice of AOR, the definitive authority on just how good vocals can be. You have to get past the pure excitement factor of just getting to hear his voice again before you can objectively critique new material. I have given most of my personal favourite artists a serve at one point or another over the years, however, I’m pleased to say there’s not much to be critical of here – provided fans understand the reality of Steve Perry 2018.\n\nThe voice is rougher, raspier and it isn’t as strong as it once was. But that’s almost stating the bleeding obvious. Who would be at nearly 70 years of age?\n\nWhat I care about is performance and songs and ‘Traces’ gets a tick in each column.\n\nI can’t imagine anyone is surprised to hear this is a ballad filled, slow to mid-tempo record. And while some may struggle with the pace, I doubt any long time Perry fan is going to be disappointed.\n\nSteve Perry at 70 is still Steve Perry. Just like hearing Neil Diamond at any stage in his career, so too is the joy of hearing Steve Perry. It’s that distinctive voice and those trademark inflections, that tone and that unmistakable delivery of mood and emotion that no one does better.\n\nThe characteristics and familiar style of Steve Perry’s past is all over this record. You can hear parts of ‘Street Talk’, ‘Strange Medicine’ and of course ‘Trial By Fire’ and other Journey-isms.\n\nTaking a look at the songs themselves:\n\n‘No Erasin’' is the upbeat easy to like, catchy as hell lead track (and single). I’ve enjoyed it from the start and I’m still enjoying it. Immediately memorable and the layered Motown harmonies are trademark Steve.\n\n‘We're Still Here’ is the second track and a ballad as expected. It’s very smooth, very moody and features a more direct and unfiltered lead vocal. Textured with modern production effects and soulful harmonies, the chorus isn't big, but it's cool. Compared to the rest of the album’s ballads, it almost feels ‘up’, especially with the chorus.\n\n'Most Of All' is a co-write with the great Randy Goodrum. It features a wonderful heartfelt vocal; slower and very sparse and smooth, this time lead primarily by Steve's voice and a grand piano. The chorus lifts tempo slightly as does Steve's voice. I picked it as a favourite from the first listen and that’s stayed true. Not unlike Strange Medicine's slower moments, plus a nice guitar solo and plenty of soul.\n\n'No More Cryin' is yet another ballad, but each track has its own vibe, making the album far more enjoyable overall. This track has a touch of the Memphis blues about it and immediately reminds me of old school Steve. The chorus lifts the tempo and has some cool modern guitar riffing.\n\n'In The Rain' is something very special. This is a very personal, very emotional piano ballad, formed with just a warm, soulful vocal, the piano and some lush orchestration. The vocal is amazing - very raw and haunting and Steve’s most ambitious high notes on the album. I can’t praise that enough and the vocal-melody makes the song.\n\n'Sun Shines Grey' is co-written with John 5 and producer Thom Flowers. We've found the album’s other rocker, and it reminds me of modern day Rick Springfield mixed with Journey's Can't Tame The Lion. I could imagine Neal Schon playing on this, but John 5 is the man behind the riffs and also delivers a cool solo.\n\n'You Belong To Me' is another soft piano ballad with accompanying string orchestration and an ultra-smooth and soulful vocal. There's some rasp in that voice its aged, but it’s still driven by those classic Perry nuances.\n\n‘Easy To Love' is another stand out ballad. This one is characterised by some percussion and organ accompanying a slow, steady Motown style vocal. The chorus jumps in tempo with some classic Perry soul harmonies. This is definitely another ballad with a familiar vibe.\n\n'I Need You' is a cover of the Beatles tune, a mere 2.59 in length, this ballad features the most familiar Perry vocal sound yet! Soft, slow, soulful...it’s the theme of the record.\n\nClosing out the standard edition of this album 'We Fly' is another unique ballad. The first minute features just Steve's vocal. Talk about putting yourself out there! It’s an intense song that builds as it goes with atmospheric keyboards in the background.\n\nAnd there you go. A very quick 40 minutes flies by as you immerse yourself in the music and lyrics of the maestro. It’s a very fine record, there’s no doubt. Immaculately produced and constructed, with equally impressive musical performances by the band assembled and also the orchestral parts. The soulful harmonies are classic Perry and lush in texture.\n\nWhat I do like about this album is each ballad has its own style, its own emotion and its own unique energy. Overall, this is a very contemporary album. The two rockers are both very commercial and the ballads could be lifted from any era. It’s a mood album…but perfect for when you’re in that mood.\n\nIt's Steve ‘MF’ Perry. It’s also very very good.\n\nTarget Special Edition Bonus Tracks:\n\n‘October In New York’ is a slow crooner of a song – a very authentic jazz/40s pop crooner complete with a stripped back jazz-ballad arrangement with orchestration and a simple piano to accompany. Not huge on this one – but the musical style is not my bag generally speaking.\n\n‘Angel Eyes’ lifts the tempo a little – mid-range for this track, which quite honestly could have come straight off Street Talk. Gracious, this one should have been on all editions! A wonderful breezy tune with lots of Motown influences and the same feel as ‘I Believe’ and ‘Go Away’. The vocal is quite marvellous.\n\n‘Call On Me’ takes on the third different style in 3 songs. Almost as if Steve has left the more adventurous tracks for the special edition. This one has another familiar feel to it, using a mid-tempo reggae beat in the same way as Steve has done before, with his soulful vocals just dripping over the instrumentation. Another fine vocal it must be said and another likeable song. I would have used this on the regular edition.\n\n‘Could We Be Somethin’ Again’ is yet another left turn – a slow to mid-tempo pop/soul track with a tidy little beat and another warm vocal. Good song, but definitely a bonus track kinda tune.\n\nThe 3 minute ‘Blue Jays Fly’ is the 5th song with the 5th different style. Not sure how to describe this one. A softly sung vocal over sparse instrumentation – it’s almost in a meditative or lullaby state that doesn’t feature a lot of vocals. It closes out things nicely, but not one I’d choose for the main set of songs.\n\nMore songs are always welcomed – there’s a couple of great tunes here that could easily have been part of the main release. The other 3 make for likable bonus tracks and take Steve’s overdue comeback album to a better length.\n\nMy original review and rating remain intact.\n\nFew artists have crossed as many boundaries and tested as many limits as Rick Springfield. He’s rarely delivered an album that sounded much like the one before it. Yet you always know just who it is. Rick has taken a true hard left on a few occasions.\n\nAnd for the most part, his dedicated fan base has followed every step of the way. I say for the most part, because even though I can’t think of a bigger RS fan than myself, there are a couple of albums that sit on my shelf more to satisfy my completist compulsions. And to be honest, they probably sit more because I’m always playing my favourite RS material. So on a gut feeling that this was something ‘he just had to do’, Rick takes one of the bigger detours of his career, diving into a full service blues album. Well…mostly.\n\nFans will be familiar with Rick’s love of the blues. Several times over the years he has leant in that direction on an individual song or two. There are still very familiar aspects to ‘The Snake King’. One is of course Rick’s warm voice and those lyrics – delving into familiar subjects like spirituality, God, relationships, sex, depression and temptation.\n\nThere is also some familiarity in the music. In fact, there’s a few tunes that could easily have appeared on ‘Rocket Science’ – the fairly breezy country tinged opener Land Of The Blind; plus the cool relaxed Blues For The Disillusioned and the 10 minute long Orpheus In The Underworld, which is quite possibly the most lyrics ever written for any song…ever!\n\nIn-between those are some truly impressive examples of some genuine delta blues riffing, complete with harmonica, brass and some guitar playing that really impresses - both fast rocking and slower traditional blues rhythms. Most impressive here, besides the trio of more recognisable Rick songs are the title track; the heavier rock of Little Demon – which converts to a slow guitar solo of pure class; the lyrically dark, rollicking double time blues of Suicide Manifesto and the quite commercial Voodoo House.\n\nAnd a special mention for the intense title track The Snake King, with its amazing slide guitar. There’s more than enough here for most dedicated fans to appreciate. For others it might be a case of heading to iTunes and picking and choosing personal favourites, one advantage of this digital age.\n\nThe Snake King is a mood album. For me it may not played at the lengths previous albums have been, but I do know that when the mood does arise, I will enjoy this without question. It’s too good not to. Bottom line – The Snake King is all class as usual, as expected."
