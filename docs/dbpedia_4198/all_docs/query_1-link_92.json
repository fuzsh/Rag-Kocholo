Alexandre Kantorow is one of the most distinguished pianists of his generation. Now in demand at the highest level, Kantorow has become known for his profound artistry and virtuosic flare. In 2019, at the age of twenty-two, Kantorow made history as the first French pianist to win the Gold Medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition as well as the Grand Prix, awarded only three times before in the competition's history. With this new album, Kantorow concludes his cycle dedicated to Brahms' piano sonatas, the previous instalments of which garnered the highest praise from music critics and audiences worldwide. By no means Brahms' first composition, the Sonata in C major bears the number 'Op 1' and is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant débuts in musical history. The work is paired with Franz Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, the most virtuosic composition in his output and one that seemingly anticipates the expressive possibilities of Franz Liszt, a composer also featured on the album with his masterly transcriptions of Schubert lieder. Schubert composed over six hundred Lieder during his short life, making him the greatest exponent of this genre - five of these are presented here in Franz Liszt's transcriptions for solo piano. Schubert's skilful musical imagery is transformed into poetry by an arranger who makes full use of the technical innovation of the piano - relished in these performances by Alexandre Kantorow.\n\n25 OCTOBER 2024\n\nAndrea Bocelli: The Duets - 30th Anniversary\n\nDecca Records\n\nRelease: 25 October 2024\n\nBeloved tenor Andrea Bocelli, the most celebrated classical singer in modern history celebrates his thirtieth anniversary as a global icon with a brand new album, Duets. This definitive collection features all the classic duets with Ed Sheeran, Céline Dion, Sarah Brightman, Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez, Giorgia & Edith Piaf alongside new collaborations with Shania Twain, Chris Stapleton, Gwen Stefani, Luciano Pavarotti, Marc Anthony, Matteo Bocelli & Hans Zimmer, Karol G, Sofia Carson & Elisa.\n\nVoices for solo piano: Smyth, Wallen, Alberga, Beamish, Yi\n\nHanni Liang, piano\n\nDelphian Records DCD34326\n\nRelease: 25 October 2024\n\nA pioneer of new concert formats, using music to communicate and bring people together, Hanni Liang was long sceptical about the traditional role of recording in progressing an artist's career. It was her discovery of Ethel Smyth - both as a composer and as a person and a woman, fighting without compromise - that sparked the inspiration that led to Voices. In this album she has created a programme that both champions women's voices that, without the determination of Smyth and others like her, might otherwise have been silent, and allows her to raise her own voice, reflecting both her European birth and upbringing and her Chinese roots.\n\nWilliam Walton: The Complete Songbook\n\nSian Dicker, soprano; Krystal Tunnicliffe, piano; Saki Kato, guitar\n\nDelphian Records DCD34328\n\nRelease: 25 October 2024\n\n'These Walton songs are really terrific', wrote accompanist Gerald Moore; 'everything WW does is impressive - why the devil doesn't he write more songs?' From early experiments, via Edith Sitwell settings that build on the success of Façade, to music for the silver screen and two well-loved cycles heard here in their original intimate versions with piano and guitar, the complete collection fits on a single album. But what an album! Four decades after Walton's death, three imaginative young artists bring fresh voices to the feast, revelling with infectious enjoyment in the composer's endlessly beguiling inventiveness and sparkling wit.\n\nTango, mon Amour!\n\nMaria Martinova, piano\n\nRubicon RCD1121\n\nRelease: 25 October 2024\n\nTango has undergone many transformations, beginning with its roots in Angola, which was later influenced by the Italian canzonetta, the klezmer, the French chanson, Jazz. In the early twentieth century, it seduced Europe after its arrival in Paris. Maria Martinova fell under the spell of Tango whilst a student and has been an advocate of this music for many years. Her new album includes music not just by Piazzolla, but a selection of other composers too.\n\n18 OCTOBER 2024\n\nSongs from the North of Ireland: Dorothy Parke | Joan Trimble\n\nCarolyn Dobbin, mezzo; Amy Ní Fhearraigh, mezzo; Iain Burnside, piano; Ingrid Sawers, piano\n\nDelphian Records DCD34329\n\nRelease: 18 October 2024\n\nFollowing the success of their partnership in Calen-O: Songs from the North of Ireland, Carolyn Dobbin and Iain Burnside return to Ulster's rich but undervalued musical heritage with a programme of songs by two twentieth-century women, all but a few of them first recordings. Dorothy Parke is well known for her songs for children but is revealed here as a much more wide-ranging composer, steeped in the folk melody and poetry of Ireland. Joan Trimble, an accomplished concert pianist, left behind only a handful of published songs but a small trove of manuscripts, including her opera Blind Raftery, written for BBC Television in 1957, two arias from which complete this journey of discovery.\n\nRay Chen: Player 1\n\nRay Chen, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra / Cristian Măcelaru\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 18 October 2024\n\nViolinist, entrepreneur, and pioneer Ray Chen celebrates the diverse and ever-evolving sounds of entertainment music. Blending classical music with the immersive world of gaming, the album also comprises a thrilling array of themes from television, Anime, and film including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Pokémon and Squid Game. Recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Cristian Mǎcelaru, these compositions gravitate around the sonic centerpiece of Erich Korngold's Violin Concerto. The Austrian composer was a pioneering twentieth-century classical composer who became one of the first musicians of international stature to score films for Hollywood. Like Ray, Erich was a child prodigy. Like Ray, he was drawn to the dramatic and the cinematic. And like Ray, he understood the thrill of storytelling. Nostalgia looms in surprising and uplifting ways on this album. Ray performs with the 1714 'Dolphin' Stradivarius, which is on loan from the Nippon Foundation. This violin was once owned by Jascha Heifetz, who has been hailed as the greatest violin virtuoso since Niccolò Paganini and who premiered the Korngold Concerto in 1947. Ray is the web that binds everything together. 'Player 1 aims to create a meaningful connection between the past and the present', he says. Ray Chen's mission now is to challenge traditional perceptions of classical music, making it accessible and inspiring. Nintendo consoles, TV dramas, films, anime, soundtracks, and a near-century-old work by Korngold may at first seem like disparate cultural phenomena. But they have one thing in common. They weave fantasies. Player 1 is a contemporary journey into these fantastical realms. Chen also reveals the links that bond classical music and gaming. Both involve interaction and multiplayer experiences. Both have their parameters set by a 'games-master' or composer: one dictates the rules via code, the other via black squiggles on paper. Both bring delight and joy. And both conjure rich worlds in which players can roam, discover, and grow. He is 'Player 1'. You, the listener, are 'Player 2'. By transforming simple eight-bit game tunes into lush symphonic masterpieces, Ray Chen taps into the nostalgia of Generation X and Millennials who grew up with video games, now sharing that joy with a new generation of gamers. Chen remarks, 'This album is for all the kids who grew up. Some of them are starting to have kids of their own, others are like me, still exploring all the side quests of this chapter before moving onto the next. We're all digital natives - those who grew up with and around technology. And while it's easy to get lost in the 'digital' side, and with all the tech imagery that's associated with it, I'd also like to focus on shared feelings of personal growth, of reflection, and looking back to all the progress we've achieved and allowing ourselves to enjoy it.' Chen is redefining what it means to be a classical musician in the 21st century. His social media presence, with 528K YouTube subscribers and 940K Instagram followers, along with his co-founded app Tonic, showcases his innovative spirit. On the album cover, Ray shows us his different guises: entrepreneur, musician, social media influencer and games enthusiast. Ray Chen's Tonic app aims to democratize music education, offering free practice sessions and a supportive community for violin students worldwide. By incorporating game-like elements and digital rewards, Chen ensures that learning music remains engaging and fun. Last May, Chen did a guest performance at Taiwanese singer Jay Chou's Hong Kong concert, where his 'electrifying' performance of Vittorio Monti's rhapsodical concert piece Csárdás (1904) and Chou's pop songs left audiences in awe, making Chen feel like a 'rock star'.\n\n11 OCTOBER 2024\n\nLiberosis: Re-mind\n\nSelf-released\n\nRelease: 11 October 2024\n\nGifted Korean pianist Iseul Kim presents Re-mind, the second offering of her group Liberosis. An eclectic blend of classical and jazz musicians, the group channels their creative prowess through the lens of Latin music, offering 8 new original compositions that place storytelling at their core while staying true to Kim's habit of composing 'traveling stories'; most of Liberosis' music was composed on the road in Africa and South America, and Re-mind adds New York to that blend of influences. Formed in 2017, Iseul Kim previously presented the first Liberosis release, embracing a culmination of styles and skills among players, hand-picking them for their talents and ability to improvise. The result is a mixture of classical, jazz, and Latin music, blended to perfection in a style rarely performed or heard in the world. Kim works tirelessly towards 'the creation of works used as a vehicle for her improvisational pianism, executed with excellence', Latin pianist Fernando Ottero once said about her.\n\nRita Strohl, a composer of immensity | Vol 3 - Orchestral music\n\nMarie Perbost, soprano; Lucile Richardot, mezzo-soprano; Orchestre national d'Île-de-France / Case Scaglione\n\nLa Boîte à Pépites BAP10\n\nRelease: 11 October 2024\n\nRita Strohl is an atypical figure in the history of music. Attracted to both the Wagnerian universe and symbolism, she composed works of chamber music as well as grand lyrical and symphonic soundscapes. This double CD containing performances by exceptional artists is the first part of a three-part project dedicated to the music of Rita Strohl. It is entirely devoted to her songs, most of which have never been recorded until now. La Boîte à Pépites (The Jewel Box) is a new classical record label launching this September dedicated to releasing music by women composers. Founded by cellist Héloïse Luzzati, the label has ambitious plans to discover and record works by women composers which has rarely, if ever, been heard before 'lost' over the decades. The label launches with a 3CD boxset of the complete works by French composer Charlotte Sohy (released on 30 September) followed by Rita Strohl (released in 2023) with many other women including the British composers Liza Lehmann, Alice Mary Smith and Adela Maddison in the pipeline. A number of world-class musicians have agreed to contribute to future recordings including Bertrand Chamayou, Karine Deshayes, Elsa Dreisig, Marie-Josèphe Jude, Emmanuel Strosser, Delphine Haidan, Xavier Phillips, Stéphanie-Marie Degand, Célia Oneto Bensaid, Fiona MacGown, the Modigliani quartet, the Wanderer trio and many more. The record label forms one part of the 'Elles - Women Composers' project - a project devised by Héloïse Luzzati - which began with the creation of the 'Un Temps pour Elles' music Festival in France and soon followed by the YouTube channel 'La Boîte à Pépites' which today contains more than sixty videos from animated documentaries to a video advent calendar - a goldmine of short videos intended to let everyone have fun discovering the works and the lives of women who remained in the shadows.\n\n4 OCTOBER 2024\n\nEmily Sun: Film Fantasia\n\nKorngold, Kats-Chernin, Williams\n\nABC Classic ABCL0102\n\nRelease: 4 October 2024\n\nFast rising Australian/UK star violinist Emily Sun - now based in London - presents her debut concerto album 'Film Fantasia'.

Emily will give the first UK performance on 24 October with BBC National Orchestra of Wales conducted by Gemma New.

'How long have I got to live? No idea ... but in my situation, I can't waste time thinking about things I can't change ... and I've never been so productive in my life. Seize the day.' Adrian Sutton\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Requiem\n\nYing Fang, soprano; Beth Taylor, alto; Laurence Kilsby, tenor; Alex Rosen, bass; Chadi Lazreq, treble; Pygmalion / Raphaël Pichon\n\nHarmonia Mundi HMM902729\n\nRelease: 4 October 2024\n\nThe sublime reflection of a human being faced with his own finitude and what comes afterwards, Mozart's Requiem reaches beyond the realm of music to attain universal resonance. Raphaël Pichon's interpretation of this testamentary work, nurtured by a seminal experience with stage director Romeo Castellucci and punctuated by earlier sacred pieces of Mozart, is overwhelmingly moving.\n\n27 SEPTEMBER 2024\n\nLight Stories\n\nMatthew Barley, cello\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD701 (digital only)\n\nRelease: 27 September 2024\n\nLight Stories charts Matthew Barley's journey from trauma to recovery through the medium of the cello.

Brahms' early Op 18b was dedicated to Clara Schumann. Clara's Op 20 was dedicated to her future husband, Robert. Robert's early set of Variations WoO 31 takes the Allegretto from Beethoven's Symphony No 7 and goes through an extraordinary journey with this famous tune. Beethoven himself is represented by his Op 34 which, along with the 'Eroica' variations were the first of the many sets that he considered special enough to be assigned opus numbers. They, in the composer's words 'have the worth of a work as it is quite a new invention to write variations such a manner as this, as without a doubt none have appeared like this'.\n\n23 SEPTEMBER 2024\n\nDaniel Parkinson & Friends: An American in Paris\n\nEP - self-published?\n\nRelease: 23 September 2024\n\nFirst-time recording and release of two Gershwin tracks created for chamber ensemble: American in Paris composed by Iain Farrington and a brand new arrangement of Promenade (Walking the Dog) composed by James Batty, a new venture by Daniel Parkinson & Friends.\n\n20 SEPTEMBER 2024\n\nRoberto Alagna 60\n\nRoberto Alagna, Morphing Chamber Orchestra, Giorgio Croci\n\nAparté AP351\n\nRelease: 20 September 2024\n\nFrance's most famous tenor celebrates not only his sixtieth birthday, but also forty years of an exceptionally rich and varied career. For a man who started out singing in Parisian cabarets, went on to perform on the world's greatest stages, and already has an impressive number of recordings to his name, what could be more natural than to mark the occasion with a new recording, reflecting the richness and diversity that have shaped his unique career? A career spent off the beaten track, constantly regenerated, and showing an insatiable curiosity, a temperament, and an extraordinary vocal timbre. Opera, new works, rediscoveries, religious music, sacred songs, operetta, variety, musicals, traditional Sicilian and international songs ... exploring every genre, Roberto Alagna captivates audiences everywhere. Here, accompanied by the Morphing Chamber Orchestra under Giorgio Croci, he presents a programme that is very much in his own image: showing a contagious passion, an insatiable appetite for the exploration of different repertoires and styles, ranging from opera - French (Gounod, Massenet, Thomas, Adam), Italian and Neapolitan (Verdi, Leoncavallo, Pergolesi), German (Wagner, Flotow), Polish (Moniuszko) and Russian (Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov) - to Italian and French songs, English and South American crossover music.\n\nMusic for Strings: Brian Elias\n\nCastalian Quartet, Natalie Clein, Danny Driver, Thomas Kemp, Sophia Rahman, Ann Beilby\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD788\n\nRelease: 20 September 2024\n\nSpanning nearly fifty years, this collection of chamber music by contemporary composer Brian Elias arose from a retrospective staged in 2020 by the Music@Malling festival in Kent.

A tenor himself, it was always Joyce's wish that his poetry be set to music. As well as previously existing settings, this album includes new commissions. As the Choral Scholars of University College Dublin release their fourth album on Signum, their reputation for musical excellence and supporting new music is further cemented. The Scholars regularly broadcast on television and radio and tour across Europe and the USA.\n\n13 SEPTEMBER 2024\n\nBeethoven: The Middle Quartets\n\nCalidore String Quartet\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD872\n\nRelease: 13 September 2024\n\nThis is the second in a three-volume, award-winning recording series of Beethoven's quartets by the Calidore String Quartet.

The orchestra's history has been closely linked to Bruckner since it gave the first Swiss performance of one of his symphonies under Richard Strauss in 1903. Bruckner composed this musical farewell - he wrote the words 'a farewell to life' in the score - in his final years. Legend has it that he was still working on the symphony on the day he died.\n\n'Sarahbanda'\n\nSarah Willis & the Sarahbanda\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA1099\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nFormed as part of the popular Mozart y Mambo project by Sarah Willis of the Berlin Philharmonic, the Sarahbanda explores the captivating Cuban dance rhythms in a way never heard before. How? By featuring an instrument not typically included in traditional Cuban band music — the French horn. The sound of Sarah's horn combined with Cuban grooves played by some of Cuba's most talented musicians creates an exciting and passionate group unlike any other. With their new arrangements of some of Cuba's best known songs such as Chan Chan and Sandunguera, original compositions by members of the band, and some classical-meets-Cuban surprises, the Sarahbanda brings a whole new sound — fresh, innovative, irresistible and one you simply have to get up and dance to!\n\nI Was Glad - Parry Choral Music\n\nThe Choir of Christ's College, Cambridge; Julian Collings, organ / David Rowland\n\nRegent Records REGCD580\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nA collection of Parry's best-loved choral works, including 'Songs of farewell' - together with a rarity, the beautiful partsong 'Music, when soft voices die'. For the last twenty years the 'Songs of farewell' have been a repertoire piece for the Chapel Choir of Christ's College, Cambridge, and singers who were former members of the choir during that period were invited to join the current (2023) choir to take part in the recording of the 'Songs' on Saturday 18 March 2023. The following day all Chapel Choir alumni were invited to join them for the remainder of the recording. This choir of over one hundred singers bestow a richness to the larger-scale anthems: 'I was glad', 'Hear my words, ye people', 'Blest pair of sirens', and 'Jerusalem' - the last recorded in Joseph Wicks's transcription for solo organ of Edward Elgar's lavish orchestration heard annually at 'The Last Night of the Proms'. The logistics of finding a suitable venue for making the recording - easily accessible for alumni from across the country, large enough to accommodate the number of singers, with a suitably rich acoustic, and a large English Romantic organ which could do justice to the accompanied anthems, led us to the Church of St Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London. This recording is released as a celebration of the work of the Chapel Choir of Christ's College, Cambridge, and David Rowland, who marks forty years as Director of Music at Christ's College in 2024.\n\nForgotten Dances\n\nAlessio Bax, piano\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD910\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nFor his ninth solo album on Signum Classics, Italian pianist Alessio Bax presents recordings of dances spanning three centuries. Featured composers include Bach, Manuel de Falla, Liszt and Brahms. A champion of the Leeds and Hamamatsu international piano competitions, Alessio Bax graduated from the Bari Conservatory in Italy at the record age of fourteen. He now performs both in recital and alongside leading orchestras on the world's foremost concert stages.\n\nBaroque Piano Collection - Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Johann Sebastian Bach, Jean-Philippe Rameau, George Frideric Handel, Lodovico Giustini, Domenico Scarlatti, Baldassare Galuppi, Manuel Espona\n\nAndrea Vivanet, Yuan Sheng, Klára Würtz, Alessandro Deljavan, Denys Proshayev, Scipione Sangiovanni, Paolo Zentilin, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, Andrea Molteni Fernanda Damiano, Melani Mestre, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 97483 (12 CDs)\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nMasterpieces of Baroque piano literature, in critically acclaimed recordings by pianists with a fine sensibility for the eighteenth century. Recordings made between 2005 and 2023; new booklet essay; an ideal budget introduction to the world of the Baroque keyboard, full of elegant dances and virtuoso playing. This survey of Baroque composers ranges from the high-point of eighteenth-century keyboard writing, the Goldberg Variations of Bach, to little known gems such as the sonatas by Espona, Galuppi and Giustini. It places the three great masters of the Baroque - Bach, Handel and Rameau - in the context of their influential predecessor, Sweelinck, and then those composers such as Galuppi and Espona who write in a new, galant style which overlaps with the Classicism of Mozart. Some of the artists on these recordings are still in their twenties, having grown up with a culture of historically informed performance practice which they then bring to their handling of a modern piano. Others, such as Yuan Sheng and Wolfram-Schmitt Leonardy, have been playing these pieces for many decades, and bring to them a career's worth of experience in teasing out the meaning and rhetoric of eighteenth-century phrasing and harmony on an instrument which none of the composers ever encountered. Handel is represented not by the familiar Eight 'Great' Suites but by an imaginative collection of earlier suites. Scarlatti's fertile invention is generously celebrated with thirty-five of his sonatas. Bach predominates, naturally, with the Six Partitas and the Italian Concerto as well as the Goldbergs, thus representing the stylistic range of his output. Keyboard styles from all over mainland Europe make an appearance, in the Dutch/Italian nobility of Sweelinck, the Hispanic-Italian flavour of Scarlatti, the French accents of Bach and Handel, and native French of Rameau, and the exuberantly Italian flourishes and proto-operatic gestures of Galuppi and Giustini. There is something here for everyone.\n\nFrank Martin: Complete Music with Flute\n\nDaniele Ruggieri flute; Monica Bacelli, voice; Aldo Orvieto, piano; Pierpaolo Turetta, organ; Ex NOVO Ensemble: Mario Paladin, viola; Carlo Teodoro, cello; Rosanna Calvi, oboe; Nicoletta Sanzin, harp\n\nBrilliant Classics 97061\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nA unique combination on record of chamber music by the Swiss composer, surveying the development of his voice and career through the medium of the flute. One of music's late starters, Martin grew up as the tenth child of a Swiss pastor and his wife, surrounded by the music of Bach and Mozart. Only once Ernest Ansermet had founded the Orchestra de la Suisse Romande in 1918 did the twenty-eight-year-old Martin begin to discover and become captivated by the sensuality of Debussy and Ravel, and this stylistic dichotomy continued to play out in his own music. Among the most polished and individual of his early works is the set of four love-sonnets composed in 1921 to poems by the sixteenth-century balladeer Pierre de Ronsard. Already the influence of modernism is apparent on the angular and even ascetic shape of Martin's melodic invention, and yet a gentle, atmospheric mood pervades the cycle; this, too, would become a hallmark of his sound-world. In 1939, Martin began what would become a series of instrumental ballades with the competition piece which is still his best-known work for flute. In the same year, he followed it up with a Ballade for alto saxophone which he then arranged for flute; both works are fine examples of Martin's ability to reconcile serialism with tonality. A neoclassical (or rather, neo-Baroque) spirit infuses the Sonata da Chiesa of 1940 with solemn, Protestant gravity, yet the flute part still sings with the lyricism of the early Sonnets. From after the war, the Trois Chants de Noel (1947) distil the mystery of Christmas into three brief settings of texts by the Swiss poet Albert Rudhardt (1894-1944). A trio of Minnelieder (1961) masterfully strips Martin's language to the bone in a distinctive 'late style', where flute and guitar support and punctuate the sung line with an archaically flavoured modernity. Almost all these works have attracted no more than one or two recordings, but gathered together by these expert Italian musicians, they paint a new and compelling portrait of Martin as a spiritually engaged modernist.\n\nByrd: Organ Works\n\nPieter-Jan Belder at the Albert Kiespenning organ of the Grote Kerk in Wijk bij Duurstede, Nederland\n\nBrilliant Classics 97125 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nIn 2023 Brilliant Classics released a 9 CD box of the complete keyboard music by William Byrd, marking the tercentenary of the composer's death. The set was welcomed as a monumental achievement, and a worthy sequel to Davitt Moroney's pioneering achievement on Hyperion. He favors less agogic manipulation and more conservative rhythmic continuity compared to Hyperion's Davitt Moroney. Extracted from that critically acclaimed set, the present album presents all the pieces recorded by Pieter-Jan Belder at the Albert Kiespenning organ of the Grote Kerk in Wijk bij Duurstede. The degree to which any of these pieces was written 'for organ' may remain open to question, when they could be performed, with allowance for some imaginative liberties, on any keyboard instrument, and indeed many contemporary pianists have revived Byrd's music for a new generation of listeners. Whether experienced on a Steinway or a spinet, Byrd is the first great composer for the keyboard, even when producing instrumental versions of choral anthems. Belder includes several such pieces here, which find a natural home 'in church' rather than the domestic setting of the harpsichord. Two versions of Salvator Mundi are effectively forerunners of chorale preludes; likewise three versions of Clarifica me. Several voluntaries lie no less idiomatically on the organ despite their highly florid writing, while the assorted preludes or fantasias and their companion fugues also deserve to be regarded alongside notable pre-Bachian models by Frescobaldi and Buxtehude.\n\nA Tribute to María Luisa Anido\n\nCinzia Milani, guitar\n\nBrilliant Classics 95954\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nThe 'grande dame of the guitar' remembered through a new recording of her own music. María Luisa Anido (1907-1996) was born in Argentina and grew up in a household where the guitar was central. Her father brought home many of the great performers, whom she heard and who heard her. Miguel Llobet, himself a student of Tárrega, became one of her early teachers, though the most important was Domingo Prat. She met Andres Segovia after one of his concerts when she was about ten and he was in his early twenties, and her own recordings rival those of Segovia's for both technical finesse and a natural feeling for the colours and rhythms of the Spanish guitar tradition. Cinzia Milani remarks, in an introduction to her new recording of Anido's own compositions, that 'there are moments when the technical essence of Anido's handing of the fretboard, especially in the higher registers, is so particular that one has the impression of knowing exactly what her hands were like.' Milani concludes her album with Anido's first and perhaps best-known piece, the Barcarola which she composed at the age of twenty. Llobet lavished well-earned praise on her in response: 'I have read and played your Barcarola; the voices are carried magnificently with admirable taste of their natural characteristics; the tone colours are perfect. Bravo, very well done.' This is only the second album ever dedicated to Anido's music, making Cinzia Milani's recording a landmark contribution to guitar music on record, and to the extensive guitar library on Brilliant Classics. The most substantial collection here is a sequence of nine Impresiones Argentinas, which effectively form a survey of the folk music of her native land. Individual movements take up Indian, mestizo, pampan and North-western Creole melodies and rhythms. The Impresiones Argentinas are marvellously relaxed and earthy pieces, speaking unaffectedly of everyday experience, and no wonder that Anido charmed Soviet audiences with them during her 1960s tours, before settling for a while in Cuba. The Aire Norteño and Cancion del Yucatan equally draw on south-American roots, while a trio of Preludios Nostalgicos belong to the repertoire of many modern guitarists. Anido was a major figure on the landscape of the twentieth-century guitar, and Cinzia Milani has made a devoted tribute to her art.\n\nCilea: Concertante Suites\n\nEnrico Bronzi, cello; Massimo Quarta, violin; I Virtuosi della Scala / Filippo Arlia\n\nBrilliant Classics 96761\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nFirst recordings of unpublished instrumental works by a master of verismo. Several recent albums on Brilliant Classics have expanded our understanding of Francesco Cilea beyond his status as the composer of: L'Arlesiana and Adriana Lecouvreur. His piano music, chamber music and songs all bear witness to a quintessentially Italian voice and aesthetic philosophy. Cilea abandoned writing for the stage after the failure of his opera Gloria in 1907, despite the presence of Toscanini in the pit, and his lyric gifts cut against the grain of the prevailing trends of modernism. He turned to teaching, but he did not entirely abandon composition. Instead, he turned back to instrumental music, and the works on this album are among the fruits of this revived inspiration. Apart from Cilea's celebrated melodic vein, the Suite for Violin and the Piccola Suite for Orchestra reveal his (perhaps un-Italian) talent for counterpoint, as well as an approach to tonal harmony that reflects his awareness of innovation, especially among French composers of the period. Cilea orchestrated the Suite in 1946 from his Suite for violin and piano of nine years earlier. The four brief movements are cast in a neo-classical vein, enclosing an elegant minuet followed by an Andante sostenuto in the very un-classical key of C sharp minor. The Piccola Suite (1931) more thoroughly absorbs the idioms of French music of the period such as the early works of Messiaen, with its modal harmony, whole-tone scales and sequences of seventh and ninth chords: again, far from what we would expect from the composer of Adriana Lecouvreur. The arrangement, revision and scoring of the Concerto in D major for cello by Leonardo Leo (written in 1737) bears witness to Cilea's deep connection with the Conservatoire in Naples where he had studied and where he became director until his retirement in 1935. Its generous orchestration, and yet respect for the eighteenth-century idiom of the writing, makes an intriguing and almost unknown parallel to the Cello Concerto in D recomposed by: Schoenberg in 1931 after a 1746 work by Georg Matthias Monn. Completing this unique survey of Cilea's output is a modern work, the first recording of the Canto dell'amore by Raffaele Cacciola, born in 1965. The style of this sinfonia concertante in all but name is a homage to the example of Cilea: tonally unpredictable, yet always melodic. These Milanese musicians draw out its intrinsically Italian character in the tradition of Cilea's verismo.\n\nDutch Overtures - Johannes van Bree, Johan Wagenaar, Johannes Verhulst, Jan van Gilse\n\nNetherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra / Jac van Steen\n\nBrilliant Classics 96998\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the first violin section in Dutch orchestras often contained amateur players. In fact, even the 'orchestra associations' in Utrecht, Rotterdam and Amsterdam were not composed entirely of professional musicians, with a significant number of members being amateurs. This mixed line-up of musicians and a strong leaning towards German and French composers had a profound effect on the choice of repertoire, and a marked preference developed for programmes containing a large number of short and contrasting pieces. This explains the success of the overture, a genre that included both the compressed piece of orchestral foreplay to an opera as well as independent pieces. Dutch overtures differ from those of foreign origin in that they tend generally to be mild in tone and lacking in theatricality. The orchestra often has a transparent sound quality, the major sources of inspiration being Weber, Mendelssohn and Boieldieu. Two fine examples are the two overtures on this album by Johannes van Bree (1801-1857). His output features four independent orchestral overtures, including this one in B minor. Van Bree also composed a number of operas, including Le Bandit, whose overture contains obvious influences from Weber's overtures. On the other hand, the overture in B minor is closer to the French opera overtures of Cherubini and Boieldieu. Johannes Verhulst (1816-1891) was a friend of Robert and Clara Schumann and his music was acclaimed by Mendelssohn. Judging by his overture to Vondel's play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel he had listened carefully to Mendelssohn's 'Hebrides' overture. A series of robust brass chords in a punctuated rhythm also recalls a passage from Schumann's First Symphony. When Johan Wagenaar (1862-1941) embarked on his career, the music of his German contemporaries still played an important role in symphonic concerts, and German influence in Wagenaar's music pervades his entire symphonic oeuvre, which includes a number of overtures. Frithjof's Meerfahrt (Op 5) is Wagenaar's first orchestral work, written around 1884. The later Concert Overture Op 11 'Frühlingsgewaltʼ seems to have been highly coloured by the idyllic nature paintings of Mendelssohn and is striking in its enormous contrasts in tempo and instrumentation. Even more than Wagenaar, Jan van Gilse (1881-1944) was a product of the conservative faction in German music in the decade around 1900. Shortly before the turn of the century he studied at the conservatory in Cologne under Franz Wüllner, also Willem Mengelberg's teacher ten years earlier. Van Gilse's Concert Overture in C minor was written at the end of his conservatory studies. The music begins in a minor key and ends in the major, developing, in Beethovian terms, from darkness to the light. Despite episodes of turbulence in his music, it always displays an often suppressed but sometimes overt longing for liberation and fulfilment.\n\nJohann Ernst Bach: 6 Sonatas for Violin & Fortepiano\n\nSusanna Pisana, violin; Maurizio Paciariello, fortepiano\n\nBrilliant Classics 97021\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nJohann Ernst, the third-born son of Johanna Sophia Siefer and Johann Bernhard Bach, was a musician and organist at the Georgenkirche in Eisenach. He was taught first by his father and then, from January 1737 in Leipzig by his uncle and godfather Johann Sebastian Bach, when he moved there to attend the Thomas schule and later to study law. He was forced to abandon his studies there in 1741 upon being called back to Eisenach to help his ill father, and though Ernst missed the musical activity at Leipzig he was persuaded by Johann Sebastian to remain by his father's side. He eventually succeeded him in the organist post at Eisenach in 1749. J E Bach's six Sonatas for fortepiano & violin are among the few works the composer managed to have published during his lifetime: the first three in 1770 and the remainder in 1772. Although critics deemed them to be 'too modern', they were received so well by the public that a new edition was released in 1775. Their title does not bear the designation 'with violin accompaniment' typical of the time but rather 'sonatas for fortepiano and a violin': the two instruments are afforded equal importance. In the final three sonatas, the structures become more complex and reveal inspiration from early proponents of classicism like C P E Bach. Although Johann Ernst was known as an organist and harpsichordist, the writing in the fast movements and the lyricism of the slow sections, as well as his inclusion of dynamic markings, suggest that these works were designed for the newly invented fortepiano. All six sonatas are divided into three movements, alternating fast-slow-fast in line with Italian symphonic style.\n\nGervais-François Couperin: Sonatas, Variations & Rondo\n\nSimone El Oufir Pierini, fortepiano\n\nBrilliant Classics 97190\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nThis first recording of a selection of Gervais-François Couperin's keyboard works aims to give an overview of the youngest member of the Couperin family with works that have survived to the present day. The son of Armand-Louis Couperin (1727-1789), to whom Brilliant Records has also dedicated a release featuring his complete harpsichord works (see BC 95459), G-F Couperin (1759-1826) is the last known musician in the line of the greatest French musical dynasty of its time. The selection of pieces presented here is meant to demonstrate his compositional exploration of the fortepiano. The four most employed forms in Couperin's keyboard oeuvre are the variations, the sonata, the rondo, and the piece in free form. This programme features the most important examples of these four types. The Two Sonatas Op 1, issued in 1788, were most probably intended to officially present the young composer to the French connoisseurs. They were conceived pour le clavecin ou forte-piano, with accompaniment of violin and cello ad libitum. Both sonatas consist of three movements, the first one in a large sonata form. A slower movement follows, the one in the second sonata consisting of a theme with 7 variations. A final movement in rondo form closes both sonatas. Stylistically, they are relatively close to other sonatas of the time, although they feature quasi-symphonic writing in the first movements. The highly virtuosic style exemplified in the two Sonatas Op 1 becomes even more evident in two single pieces, strictly related to one another: Les Incroyables Op 6 and Les Merveilleuses Op 7. The two pieces refer to adherents of a fashion trend highly favoured by the aristocracy in Paris during the French Directory (1795-99). The men were called Incroyables ('incredible') and the women Merveilleuses ('marvelous'), and they greeted the new regime with an outbreak of luxury, decadence, even silliness, perhaps as a reaction to the Terror period. The two pieces are in free form, with a ritornello in the first, shorter part. However, this form actually owes much to the rondo, which Couperin had already proved to master, both in his sonatas and in a short individual Rondo presented here, published in the Journal de Clavecin in 1782. This short and elegant piece, which may possibly be the first piece ever published by Couperin, is the closest one to the classical period, with its almost-Viennese flavour. Two sets of variations both published in 1790, together with the slow movement of the Sonata Op 1 No 2, show Couperin's adeptness with this genre. It is worth noting that while the first set is based on one of the most emblematic of Revolutionary songs, 'Ah! Ça ira', the second is based on a royalist song, the Complainte béarnoise, a troubadour's protestations at King Louis XVI being housed in the Palais de Tuileries at the beginning of the revolution.\n\nBoccherini: Complete Duets for 2 Violins\n\nIgor Ruhadze, Daria Gorban, baroque violins\n\nBrilliant Classics 97260\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nThe name Luigi Boccherini (1743-1805) does not immediately bring to mind such modest works as violin duos, but alongside his large output of trios, quartets and quintets for stringed instruments, Boccherini's oeuvre also features two sets of six pieces for two violins. One set was composed at the beginning of his compositional career, in 1761 - that is, before his twentieth birthday - and published some years later, in 1768, in Paris by Louis-Balthazar de La Chevardière, under the title Six duos pour deux violons, with the opus number 5. Later, the same collection is described by the composer as his Opus 3. And then there is a second, much later collection with arrangements for two violins of other compositions of his originally written for three or five stringed instruments. The latter set was published by Ignace Pleyel in Paris in 1799 - just a few years before his death - under the similar title Six duos pour deux violons, with opus number 46. Unsurprisingly, the two sets are very different in character. Boccherini's Duets Op 3 all consist of three movements. Five of them begin with a fast movement, in a major key. Then follows a slow movement in a different key, sometimes major, sometimes minor. And, finally, there is most often a minuet, in a characteristic 3/4 time, with a tempo between slow and fast. The first duet in the set, however, follows a different model: it starts with a slow movement, a fast movement follows and finally there is a light-hearted 'Presto'. We know the year of composition of the Duets Op 3, and we know for sure that they are works by Boccherini. Regarding the Violin Duets Op 46, however, there are still some question marks. We know that they were published in 1799 by the Parisian publisher Ignace Pleyel, but they are missing from the catalogue compiled by Boccherini himself of his own works. That does not necessarily mean that they are not from his hand. Boccherini regularly arranged his own compositions for other instrumental combinations, and these are systematically missing from his catalogue. And these arrangements are not simply reductions of the original compositions for two violins: in many cases they are thorough re-compositions based on the original material. This last aspect in particular contributes to the assumption that the arranger was Boccherini himself: arrangers who are not the original composer usually leave the structure of the composition intact in their arrangements. In the case of Boccherini's Duets Op 46, as it were, new compositions were created. Boccherini's violin duets are perhaps not among his best-known compositions. For the Duets Op 3 one has to go back quite far into the past to find a recording on LP or CD. The Duets Op 46 have never been recorded on LP or CD. It's high time, then, for a CD featuring these charming and melodious works.\n\nGottfried Grünewald: 7 Partiten\n\nFernando De Luca, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 97290 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nGottfried Grünewald (1675-1739) was a successful opera singer in eighteenth-century Germany, based at the theatre in Hamburg for many years, but a familiar figure in German courts and theatres across Germany. When he died in 1739, the composer Christopher Graupner - his colleague in Darmstadt - destroyed most of Grünewald's music, according to an agreement they had apparently made. Only seven keyboard partitas are known to have survived to modern times, and they receive their first complete recording here in the spirited hands of Fernando de Luca, who has done so much to rescue forgotten names from obscurity with his albums for Brilliant Classics. The loss of Grünewald's output becomes especially regrettable once close attention is paid to these Parititas. They reveal a deep knowledge of the instrument's technique and a refined compositional taste. Stylistically close to German composers of the time such as Kuhnau and Fischer, they also bring to mind the suites composed in Germany by the young Handel - preceding the Eight Great Suites - and the music of the young Graupner. Grünewald shows some skill as a contrapuntalist within the restrictions of the suite genre. The preludes of these partitas are not uniform in form; for example, the Prelude in D minor incorporates broad arpeggiated chords, which begin and end a strict fugue but then dissolves into free motivic play. Another is purely figurative, a third mixes movement with short imitations. Grünewald's allemandes build up like intricate etudes, including one example constructed in an organistically contrapuntal manner. The courantes are interwoven with imitative passages, the sarabandes are melodically appealing, sometimes breathing in the spirit of Handel's nobility of gesture. The doubles and minuets almost give the impression of variations. Some pieces have strongly emphasised French rhythms, others avoid it completely. Potentially incomplete, but certainly striking, is the two-movement Fourth Suite, with its spacious Allemande followed by an imposing Chaconne, presenting a complete contrast to the nine brief dances of the Fifth Suite, which find Grünewald at his most French-accented.\n\nRies: Grande Sonata Fantasia 'L'Infortunée'; Fantasies\n\nGianluca Faragli, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10269\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nNew recordings of large-scale but little-known works by one of Beethoven's most influential students. Born like his teacher-to-be in the German city of Bonn, Ferdinand Ries studied with Beethoven in Vienna for several years during the first decade of the nineteenth century. He also worked for Beethoven as a copyist and secretary, and in 1838, shortly before his own death at the age of fifty-three, published the first authoritative account of his master's life. But Ries was far more than a mere amanuensis, as a series of releases on Brilliant Classics has documented, with valuable modern recordings of solo, chamber and instrumental music. Ries' own instrument was naturally the piano, and his catalogue of works for the instrument spans light-hearted miniatures and ambitiously scaled, dramatic sonatas, much as Beethoven's did. In the latter category falls the Grande Sonata Fantasia which Ries composed in 1811 - the same year as Beethoven's 7th Symphony. It is easy enough to hear the turbulent textures and melodic shapes of his teacher's famous 'Pathétique' Sonata in the background, but Ries could exercise his own imagination, which in any case was shaped by travel far beyond the lands around Vienna, unlike Beethoven. The weight of the sonata's singular form falls on the huge Presto finale, making considerable demands on the artist, which Gianluca Faragli conquers with the aid of a superbly conditioned modern Fazioli piano. The sonata's designation as a 'fantasia' indicates that Ries was anticipating the Romantic era's preoccupation with personal expression as the over-riding concern of creative art, and Faragli has coupled Op 26 with three more fantasies. Two of them are based on themes from Mozart's 'Marriage of Figaro': display pieces, but by no means frivolous, any more than the darker subject of Schiller's poem 'Resignation' which inspired Ries to compose one of his most inwardly affecting works, written in the south London suburb of Clapham in 1821. In a lighter vein, Faragli adds the gypsy-style Introduction and Rondo composed once Ries had returned to Vienna with his English wife and three children. Thus the album surveys the course of Ries' creative life, as the pianist Alessandro Taverna elucidates in a detailed booklet essay.\n\nChopin: Nocturnes complete\n\nVincenzo Maltempo, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10312 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nDeeply felt new recordings of these landmarks in Romantic piano literature on a modern Steinway grand. By an Italian artist with an active interest in the lineage of piano history. On recordings for Piano Classics ranging from Beethoven to Alkan and beyond, the Italian pianist Vincenzo Maltempo has demonstrated a deeply informed understanding of Romantic piano literature, both in the nuts and bolts of its composition and in the field of its reception. In his own booklet introduction to his latest recording, Maltempo explores the nature of a Chopin tradition, as handed down to us from accounts of the composer's own playing, his instructions to his students, and then the early recordings made by renowned interpreters such as Cortot and Pugno. 'What their recordings share is a relatively free or liberal interpretation of elements in the score that are now treated more rigidly. Their application of rubato is more subtle, their pedal technique does not cloud the sound but clarifies melodies and harmonies. They communicate a wide and infinitely varied dynamic range, and a diaphanous warmth of phrasing, without falling into mannerism or 'sentimentality'.' These qualities, therefore, are the guiding lights to his own playing of the Nocturnes. Maltempo has chosen to record them on an 1888 Steinway piano, distinguished by the clarity of articulation which has always been a Steinway hallmark, but bestowing on these quintessential pieces of nocturnal poetry a softer and more rounded palette than we are accustomed to find on modern pianos. These recordings are, in the best possible sense, 'historically informed', without being bound either to the bar-line or to doctrinal notions of a 'correct' Chopin performance. They are, instead, as free and as personal, yet as imbued with the inner spirit of the score, as it seems the composer wished to find in his performers.\n\nSchurmann: Orchestral Works\n\nXiayin Wang, piano; BBC Philharmonic / Ben Gernon\n\nChandos CHAN20341\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nBen Gernon conducts the BBC Philharmonic in this programme marking the centenary of the birth of Gerard Schurmann. The Concert Overture Man in the Sky and Romancing the Strings reflect his extensive career as a composer of film scores, whilst the Piano Concerto (performed by Xiayin Wang) and Gaudiana were both originally conceived as concert works.\n\nVladimir Feltsman\n\nA Tribute to Mozart\n\nNimbus NI 6448\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nIn addition to sonatas, variations, and concertos for piano and orchestra, Mozart wrote numerous works for solo piano: fantasias, rondos, adagios, and other assorted pieces of short and moderate length. We don't know exactly why these works were written, but we know that Mozart had to come up with new material for his many public and private appearances as a composer and performer. In those days composers were usually performers as well. Any composition was also a potential source of income from publication and from patrons and friends to whom the works were dedicated. But no matter why these marvellous works were written, we are lucky to have them.\n\nGeorge Benjamin\n\nPicture A Day Like This\n\nNimbus NI 8116\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nCreated in 2023 at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence on a text by Martin Crimp, this lyric fable is British composer George Benjamin's fourth opera.\n\nNancy Hadden: Chansons musicales, Paris, 1533\n\nNancy Hadden, flute; Jacob Herringman, lute; Zephyrus Flutes\n\nCRD CRD 3548\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nThrough these songs or 'chansons', we are given the chance to be transported back in time to when the word, note, instrument and performer came together to capture the world in which they lived. These songs began as instrumental pieces of music in the Renaissance era and would have been performed in taverns and dwellings in Paris and beyond. Chansons musicales is a world-class researched project and a living and breathing work. This project looked at publications from 1533; selecting and reconstructing tracks that offer a rare insight into the surviving works of composers who took inspiration from contemporary poetry. © Nancy Hadden\n\nIntrigues of the Darkness\n\nAnna Fedorova, piano\n\nChannel Classics CCS47124\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nAnna Fedorova explores the 'Intrigues of the Darkness' in these programmatic and extremely virtuosic works for solo piano. The journey from darkness to light begins with Scriabin's terrifying 'Black Mass' Sonata. The work represents a satanic ritual that is possessed by the spectre of the Mephistophelian Liszt. Ravel described his Gaspard de la nuit as 'romantic and of transcendent virtuosity'. These highly evocative pieces are based on Aloysius Bertrand's prose poems depicting scenes of Ondine's alluring seduction, a hanged man sighing on the gallows and a devilish dwarf. De Falla's Suite from El Amor brujo conjures a mysterious world, full of magic, rituals, and ghost visitations. Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition portrays many scenes of darkness but emerges into light with The Great Gate of Kiev, in which triumphant episodes alternate with moments of religious contemplation.\n\nVaughan Williams: The Grinke Legacy\n\nFrederick Grinke, violin\n\nAlbion Records ALBCD061\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nThis is an 'archive' recording comprising LP and 78 rpm discs newly remastered for this album by Ronald Grames. Frederick Grinke (1911-1987), soloist, chamber musician, and teacher, was a favourite of Vaughan Williams, one of a handful of violinists for whom he composed works. Grinke was a familiar presence on BBC radio and a frequent soloist on orchestral and recital stages throughout the UK as well as in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, the United States, and Canada. This album includes all four of Grinke's recordings of music by Vaughan Williams. Three of the recordings included in this release were made with the Boyd Neel ensemble, with which Grinke was closely associated. Only the 1939 Concerto Accademico has seen prior commercial digital reissue. The 1955 recording of the Vaughan Williams Violin Sonata, the work the composer wrote for him, is included, as is the Violin Sonatina by Arthur Benjamin, which appeared with it on LP. Though highly praised when they were released, neither has been commercially reissued. Despite Grinke's fame and sizable discography, including many new works, he is primarily remembered today as the highly influential and much-admired teacher of more than a generation of violinists leading the UK's orchestras and appearing in recital halls as soloists and chamber musicians. It is time to redress the balance. The pianist Michael Mullinar (1895-1973) was a pupil of both Holst and Vaughan Williams, who became a close friend and colleague of Vaughan Williams, acting as copyist, arranger and playing new works for private audiences. Despite giving a very large number of broadcasts and performances, this recording of the Violin Sonata with Grinke is the only commercial record of his playing. The album is available both as a CD and digitally, for downloads and streaming. One track will be released in August as an 'Instant Grat,' to encourage the latter. As always, the booklet includes detailed notes and biographical information.\n\nFantasia\n\nMagdalena Hoffmann, harp\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 6 September 2024\n\nFor her second DG recording, Fantasia, the harpist has traveled further back in time to focus on the music of the Baroque period. Here she showcases her instrument in a selection of fantasias and preludes originally written for keyboard or lute by Johann Sebastian Bach, his sons Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel, and his contemporaries Handel and Weiss.\n\n30 AUGUST 2024\n\nGrieg - Franck - Shor-Pletnev - Shostakovich\n\nDaniel Lozakovich, violin; Mikhail Pletnev, piano\n\nWarner Classics 5021732285829\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nViolinist Daniel Lozakovich makes his album debut on Warner Classics with a recital recorded with pianist Mikhail Pletnev. Featuring Grieg's Violin Sonata No 3 and Solveig's Song, Franck's Sonata for Violin and Piano in A major, Shostakovich's Romance from The Gadfly, the album also includes a new sonata co-written by Alexey Shor and Pletnev himself.\n\nDvorák: Symphony No 9 'From The New World'; American Suite\n\nAtlanta Symphony Orchestra & Chorus / Nathalie Stutzmann\n\nErato 5021732263797\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nNathalie Stutzmann first made her name as a contralto and recorded some of her earliest albums for Erato. Her first Erato release as a symphonic conductor is a live recording with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble she leads full-time as Music Director. The programme, featuring Dvorák's 'New World' Symphony and American Suite, has special significance for Stutzmann - she describes it as 'a lovely tribute to my amazing commitments across the Atlantic, but also to the new horizons opening up for our exciting collaboration.'\n\nHans Otte: The Book of Sounds (B-sides)\n\nCarlos Cipa, piano\n\nWarner Classics (digital only)\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nHans Otte described his minimalist work, The Book of Sounds, as a musical pendulum movement of one hour in twelve 'pieces' - chords and melodies repeat themselves, following each other in harmonic cadences in a timeless back and forth. This is pianist-composer Carlos Cipa's first recording of music by another composer, a testament to the influence this work has had on him as an artist. To help shape the tonal characteristics of the work, Cipa chose to record these twelve pieces on three different pianos - a Steinway grand, a Yamaha, and a Yamaha CP-70, an early electric piano.\n\nDouce France: Mélodies & Chansons\n\nBenjamin Bernheim, Carrie-Ann Matheson\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nA new album from the artist of the year at the 2024 Victoires de la Musique Classique, French tenor Benjamin Bernheim imaginatively couples famous melodies by three leading lights of nineteenth-century French Romanticism with famous chansons by three leading lights of twentieth-century French popular music. Benjamin is accompanied by his long-standing recital partner Carrie-Ann Matheson.\n\nA Ballet Through Mud\n\nRZA\n\nPlatoon\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nRZA is a true multifaceted artist - rapper, record producer, composer, actor, and filmmaker. He revolutionised American hip-hop with the release of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and went on to compose the scores for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill odysseys. RZA has now turned his hand to the classical genre, composing an exquisite symphonic ballet - the culmination of a lifelong musical evolution, over a career spanning three decades. RZA began working on his first classical project during the pandemic, inspired by the rediscovery of lyrical notebooks he'd filled as a teen. He drew inspiration from composers Sergei Prokofiev and Leonard Bernstein, and cites Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, Thelonious Monk and Isaac Hayes as being influential to his creative process. His first classical work evolved into a refined orchestral composition, featuring characters named after Greek modes, weaving tales of Buddhist monks and a journey 'through mud' into a poignant coming-of-age story that delves into the complexities of love, friendship, and personal growth. A Ballet Through Mud was premiered with the Colorado Symphony last year, brought to life on stage by dancers and a 60 piece orchestra. RZA said of the project - I have been composing my whole life, although I didn't know initially that was what I was doing. The inspiration for Ballet Through Mud comes from my earliest creative output as a teenager, but its themes are universal—love, exploration, and adventure. I hope people use it to score their own lives, to transform a drive to the grocery store or sharing a meal with loved ones into something magical, to be inspired and let their imaginations take them into a different chamber, if only for a moment.\n\nBach: Preludes, Inventions & Sinfonias\n\nMahan Esfahani\n\nHyperion CDA68448\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nA collection of miniatures centred around the sets of Inventions and Sinfonias which Bach wrote principally as teaching aidsof an extremely superior kind, it should be notedto encourage any young keyboard player 'keen to learn'. These joyous, enthralling accounts from Mahan Esfahani prove that there is a great deal more to them than that.\n\nObrecht: Scaramella\n\nThe Binchois Consort / Andrew Kirkman\n\nHyperion CDA68460\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nThe challenges and rewards of performing early music are here vividly illustrated by The Binchois Consort, as creative scholarship comes to the aid oftwo substantialbut fragmentaryworks by Jacob Obrecht, and an audacious recorded sound attempts to recreate the experience of the original performers five hundred years ago. An album set to attract huge interest from critics and Renaissance scholars alike.\n\nAngele Dei\n\nLatvian Radio Choir\n\nSkani LMIC163\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nThis is the third album that the Latvian Radio Choir has released on the SKANI label with new choral music by Latvian composers. This programme was created with the intention to record trends and the state of music in 2023 as a kind of time stamp. Not quite a survey of everything that has been recently composed, it stands instead as a testimony to the creative collaboration between the Latvian Radio Choir and composers, which exists at the same time as a part of the Latvian musical space. These are new contributions to the repertoire that are of interest to professionals and all those interested in contemporary choral music. Almost all of these works are united by their sacred texts and some higher idea, which each of the composers has brought to life by remaining faithful to his or her own style, be it multi-layered microtonality, echoes of spectral music, branching polyphonic textures, detailed explorations of sonic and rhythmic formulas, or the new simplicity and the four-part texture of the chorale. These Latvian composers seem to have a unique quality: however far they go in their experimentations with sound and reinventing the boundaries of the choir as an instrument, their compositions never lose their spiritual aspect or emotional message, approaching the revelation of the text with great sensitivity and creating a natural musical flow.\n\nKeel Road\n\nDanish String Quartet\n\nECM New Series 4875884\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nThe Danish String Quartet's new album is a 'retracing of musical pathways across the North Sea, a journey through the sounds of traditional music from Northern Europe, taking us from Denmark and Norway to the Faroe Islands, and to Ireland and England'. It follows on from Last Leaf, the Danish String Quartet's much-loved 2017 release. Keel Road underlines the group's statement that 'folk tunes are not just a part of our repertoire, but an important element of our identity as musicians.' Subtly integrated into the flow of the recording, alongside the traditional material, are original compositions by Rune Tonsgaard Sorensen and Fredrik Schoyen Sjolin, eloquently expressive in a folk idiom. Other highlights include the DSQ's beguiling arrangements of four compositions by Turlough O'Carolan, legendary harper from Ireland's County Meath. In total, the journey illuminates musical affinities as well as distinctions, for while folk music 'represents local traditions and local stories, it is also the music of everywhere and everyone.' Keel Road was recorded at Copenhagen's Village Recording Studio in November 2022, and mixed at Munich's Bavaria Musikstudios in March 2024.\n\nSeven: Works by Andrea Casarrubios\n\nAndrea Casarrubios\n\nOdradek Records ODRCD457\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nFollowing the success of her Odradek releaseCaminante, award-winning Spanish cellist and composer Andrea Casarrubios returns with Seven, which features seven of her most recent chamber works, all in first recordings. Alongside works for solo cello or cello and piano, the recording features a Chicago Symphony Orchestra commission for the distinctive combination of clarinet, violin, viola and cello, and culminates in Casarrubios's Piano Quintet, a tender tribute to California's Central Coast. Together, the mesmerising pieces on this album encompass a truly significant period in history: the years before and after 2020. At the heart of this collection lies SEVEN for solo cello, a piece that has become central to Casarrubios's life as a composer. The title alludes to the 7pm tribute offered to healthcare workers during lockdown. Through the music, she sought to explore the contradiction between solitude and community; that unique emotional complexity precipitated by the overwhelming challenges of 2020. SEVEN received its Carnegie Hall premiere in 2021 and has been performed in more than thirty-six countries since. Other highlights of the album include Armadura, inspired by artist FridaKahlo; Silbo, reflecting the unique beauty of whistled languages; and Mensajes del agua, which traces the intricate patterns found in unpolluted frozen water.\n\nTre\n\nLise Vandersmissen\n\nEtcetera KTC1826\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nTRE is a bridge between old and new: this album contains both Early Music and brand-new original compositions inspired by Folk and Early Music. Since there isn't a lot of solo repertoire for the triple harp, Lise has transcribed and arranged existing pieces (instrumentation in the Baroque period was flexible) and added her own compositions. TRE means 'three' in Italian. The Italian triple harp was invented at the end of the sixteenth century in Naples, and has three rows of strings that are strung parallel to one another. Today, the instrument is mainly played in an accompanying role as part of the continuo section. Intrigued by its unique timbres and technical possibilities, it has become Lise Vandersmissen's goal to reintroduce the triple harp as a solo instrument. Lise Vandersmissen (born Belgium, 1996) travels with her modern pedal harp and her Italian Triple Harp to perform across Europe and Asia. She has been awarded Prizes in international competitions including the First Prize at the International Harp Competition in Slovenia and the Second Prize at the Szeged International Harp Competition in Hungary, and she won the Belgian Supernova Competition with her Aglica Trio. TRE is Lise's second solo album: her debut album 'TRANSFORMED' with her own transcriptions for the modern pedal harp was released in 2023. Lise lives with her harps on a blue houseboat on the London canals and rivers. When she is not playing the harp, she loves to knit jumpers and run along the canal.\n\nConcerto Grosso\n\nAtaneres Ensemble, Kugoni Trio, Pieter Schuermans\n\nEtcetera KTC1809\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nAtaneres Ensemble and Kugoni Trio here present Concerto Grosso, their first joint album, in which the saxophone, violin and piano of the Kugoni Trio enter into a uniquely adventurous dialogue with the strings of the Ataneres Ensemble. The two ensembles offer a contemporary interpretation of the concerto grosso, an instrumental genre from the Baroque period in which a group of solo instruments interact with an instrumental ensemble. The Kugoni Trio and the Ataneres Ensemble aim not only to promote classical music in innovative ways but also to spotlight new works by Flemish composers. Astor Piazzolla's Concierto del Angel is therefore placed alongside works by Piet Swerts, Jeroen D'hoe and Pieter Schuermans which were initially created as collaborations with or commissions by the Kugoni Trio and which were arranged for this occasion. The work that opens this CD is by the Flemish composer Erik Desimpelaere, who has worked closely with both ensembles on many occasions.\n\nKoppel, Schmidt & Bentzon: Clarinet Concertos\n\nJohn Kruse, Aalborg Symphony Orchestra / Fredrik Burstedt\n\nOrlando Records OR0054\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nThree masterful compositions that highlight Denmark's rich musical heritage. John Kruse, the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra and conductor Fredrik Burstedt present the fascinating world of Danish clarinet concertos. This album features Herman D Koppel's Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra, which showcases his distinctive blend of influences from jazz to classical. Ole Schmidt's Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra from 2007 offers a vibrant mix of jazz and classical styles, highlighting his imaginative orchestration. Finally, Niels Viggo Bentzon's Chamber Concerto for Solo Clarinet and Small Instrumental Ensemble, revised by his son, presents a unique, transparent musical language across four movements.\n\nMichelle Lou: Near Distant\n\nDistractfold, Ensemble Inverspace, gnarwhallaby, line upon line percussion, scapegoat, Trio K/D/M, WasteLand\n\nKairos Records KAI0022301\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nNear Distant by Michelle Lou explores the intricate interplay of stasis, time and perception. Lou's compositions challenge conventional interpretations, presenting music as a constantly evolving landscape. Through 'static' or 'stasis-variation' she reveals the complexity within seemingly unchanging sounds, inviting listeners to explore subtle transformations in pitch, timbre and dynamics. This album embodies Lou's unique approach, emphasizing our active role in perceiving and transforming the infinite essence of music.\n\nYu Kuwabara: Sounded Voice, Voiced Sound\n\nMarco Fusi, Hidejiro Honjoh, Shungo Mise, Awai-Za\n\nKairos Records KAI0022202\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nIn the heart of 21st-century Japan, Yu Kuwabara emerges as a composer of remarkable versatility and resilience. Inspired by Japanese mythology, Buddhist chants, and Edo songs, Kuwabara explores the energy of the Japanese language through her compositions. Her works, such as Bai and Dharani and Toward the Brink of Water Or the Verge of Dusk, blend Western classical influences with traditional Japanese elements. Kuwabara's research in traditional arts fuels her innovative approach, capturing the fluidity of 'awai' - the in-between state of being.\n\nCamilo Mendez: Distant Fragments\n\nRoberto Alonso Trillo, Hong Kong New Music Ensemble\n\nKairos Records KAI0022038\n\nRelease: 30 August 2024\n\nWith 'Distant Fragments', Camilo Mendez presents an album of solos and duos that showcase his most intimate and reflective works, creating a rich sound tapestry. While Mechanical Resonance I: Iridescent Resonance explores cloud luminescence through prepared violin and viola, Five Fragments deals with the themes of variation and polyphony. Cancion de la Distancia, on the other hand, reflects the fleeting nature of memory and time, inspired by Arturo's poetry. Recorded by Roberto Alonso, Linus Fung, William Lane, Angus Lee and Charles Ng, this album offers a subtle and complex musical contemplation.\n\n23 AUGUST 2024\n\nJörg Widmann Piano Music\n\nYubo Zhou, piano\n\nMDG MDG 904 2320-6 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nOne of the most intriguing composers of the 21st century, Jorg Widmann writes music that is both sophisticated and deeply moving. The highly talented and versatile virtuoso, Yubo Zhou, delves deep into Widmann's world of sound with these four stirring piano cycles, revealing a whole cosmos of allusions and associations. 'Zirkustanze' ('Circus Dances') is a fascinating kaleidoscope of emotions and parodies filled with a danger the tightrope-walker may fall. Zhou takes us through unexpected twists and turns with the necessary lyricism and irony whether fanfare, boogiewoogie, waltz or Venetian gondoliers' song. The finale makes a mockery of a parade-ground march whose weird distortions Zhou hurls at the audience with overwhelming virtuosity. 'Elf Humoresken' is a connotation-rich yet aesthetically self-contained transfer of Schumann's language into the musical idiom of the 21st century. Pieces such as 'Fast zu ernst' ('Almost Too Serious'), 'Lied im Traume' ('Song in a dream') or 'Waldszene' ('Forest scene') echo Schumann's 'Kinderszenen' and 'Waldszenen' with an imaginative mix of ingenuity and melancholic irony. 'Intermezzi' is Widmann's tribute to his love of Brahms. By way of a familiar melodic flourish, harmonic sequence or a tiny fragment of a motif, the allusions are yet remote from the nineteenth century and expressed in a tonal language of their own. 'Idyll und Abgrund' is a nod to Schubert, more reminiscence than pastiche, sometimes extremely vague, sometimes quite specific, and always distinguished by compositional and tonal extremes.\n\nGiuliani and Paganini - Great Virtuosos!\n\nRainer Kussmaul, violin; Sonja Prunnbauer, guitar\n\nMDG MDG 603 2329-2 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nTwo world-class virtuosos, Rainer Kussmaul, on a Stradivarius from 1724, together with guitarist Sonja Prunnbauer, perform a sensational selection of great virtuosic duos by Niccolo Paganini and Mauro Giuliani. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Paganini and Giuliani both sought their fortune in Vienna, a city that later consecrated them as great virtuosos and founders of the Italian violin and guitar school. Paganini, AKA the 'devil's violinist', was an uncanny idol and heartthrob to countless fans who also had a masterful command of the guitar. Giuliani was the premiere guitarist of his day and also had a great understanding of the violin. His nickname, 'the Paganini of the guitar' helped intensify the bond between the two and further sealed their friendship and mutual esteem. Paganini's gently flowing 'Sonata concertata' is a dialogue between equals, with each instrument serving up themes for the other. The heart of the work is romantically elegiac with broad melodic lines full of harmonic elaboration. His 'Grand Sonata a chitarra so/a' is brilliant in its technique and full of scintillating musical ideas. It begins with an extremely difficult passage in the highest range, followed by a sentimental romanza with a grand sweeping melody and concludes with a light, bubbling melodic theme with a series of bravura variations. Theme and variations was an extremely popular form in Vienna at the time and Giuliani was also fond of it. He had a remarkable ability to weave a melody into a passage with musical effect while remaining true to the idiom of the instrument. Giuliani pushed the boundaries of what had previously been possible on the guitar and fascinated his contemporaries with a diverse range of compositional techniques.\n\nChopin & Szymanowski\n\nJonathan Fournel, piano\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA1064\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nPianist Jonathan Fournel, winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition at the age of 27 and already an important figure on the international stage, releases this programme of two great Polish masters that he has performed extensively in concert. His debut recording on Alpha Classics of Brahms' Piano Sonata No 3 and the Handel Variations received lavish praise in the international press, and his Mozart Piano Concertos Nos 18 & 21 in the Next Generation Mozart Soloists series were lauded for their natural fit and fluidity.\n\nFauré: Requiem; Gounod: Messe de Clovis\n\nLe Concert Spirituel / Hervé Niquet\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA1014\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nWhile Fauré's Requiem is a monument of French sacred music, Gounod's Messe de Clovis is much less well known. It was composed from 1891 onwards as a tribute to Clovis who, like Joan of Arc, had become an iconic figure after the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The two works share a reflective and intimate character that gives the impression of a return to the purity of Gregorian chant, although this does not detract from the jubilant character of Fauré's Requiem: 'this warm, luxuriant sound leads to an elevation of the spirit', says Hervé Niquet. The work is recorded here in its 1893 version, in an orchestration that uses neither violins nor woodwind; a later version with full orchestra was published in July 1900. O salutaris by Louis Aubert (1877-1968) for soprano, violin, harp, organ and choir and L'Adagio for violin and organ by André Caplet (1878-1925) complete this programme, a co-production with the Palazzetto Bru Zane and performed with fervour by Le Concert Spirituel under Hervé Niquet, with vocal guest stars Emőke Baráth and Philippe Estèphe.\n\nRobert & Clara Schumann: Works for Oboe and Piano\n\nNicholas Daniel and Julius Drake\n\nChandos Records CHAN 20295\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nOboist Nicholas Daniel and pianist Julius Drake present a fascinating programme of chamber works by Robert and Clara Schumann. Most of the repertoire was composed for other instruments: transcribing for another instrument (in this case the oboe) is not only in keeping with performance practise of the time, but also presents these works in a new light.\n\nAmerican Road Trip\n\nAugustin Hadelich, Orion Weiss\n\nWarner Classics 5021732287908\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nViolinist Augustin Hadelich's latest solo album is a homage to the US. Born to German parents, Hadelich moved to study at New York's Juilliard School at the age of nineteen and became an American citizen in 2014. This album, recorded with pianist Orion Weiss, spans two hundred years of American music from the nineteenth century to the present day, encompassing Romanticism, blues, jazz and more. Featured composers include Copland, Bernstein, Ives, Adams, Beach, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson and Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nJohn Williams Reimagined\n\nSarah Andon, Cécilia Tsan, Simone Pedroni\n\nWarner Classics 5054197942426 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nLegendary film composer John Williams welcomed and praised this new set of arrangements of his most famous scores, transcribed for a trio of flute, cello and piano by Simone Pedroni. The two CD compilation includes selections from the Star Wars saga, Schindler's List, E T The Extra-Terrestrial, The Fabelmans, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, A I Artificial Intelligence, The Witches of Eastwick, Jurassic Park, The Accidental Tourist, Dracula, The Sugarland Express, Jane Eyre, War Horse, Hook, The Patriot and more.\n\nPetrichor\n\nDavid Orlowsky, clarinet\n\nWarner Classics 5021732390028\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nAn album of eleven original compositions by clarinettist David Orlowsky, each inspired by a distinctive smell which, in Orlowsky's words, 'release something special inside us'. Orlowsky believes that smell and music are intricately connected - 'It is certainly no coincidence that we talk about the notes of a perfume, the colours of sounds and the tones of colours. Colours, sounds and smells transcend our capacity to describe things in words.'\n\nFluid Dynamics\n\nRachel Lee Priday, violin; David Kaplan, piano\n\nOrchid Classics LC20037\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nPartnering with oceanographer Georgy Manucharyan and six visionary composers, violinist Rachel Lee Priday embarks on a musically rich project that blends classical music with the visual poetry of fluid dynamics experiments, including a new album, Fluid Dynamics, with pianist David Kaplan out Friday, August 23, 2024 on Orchid Classics. The album features world premiere recordings of works commissioned specifically for this project by Gabriella Smith, Paul Wiancko, Cristina Spinei, Timo Andres, Leilehua Lanzilotti and Christopher Cerrone. Liner notes have been contributed by Katy Hamilton. The genesis of this ambitious project traces back to an unexpected encounter in 2019 when Priday, newly appointed to the University of Washington's School of Music, crossed paths with Georgy Manucharyan of the School of Oceanography, who studies what he describes as 'the physics of the ocean - how currents move, and what causes their motion.' Fascinated by Manucharyan's research on ocean currents and fluid dynamics, Priday recognized a unique opportunity to synergize their disciplines. Manucharyan's experiments, captured in visually captivating videos available to the public this fall, became the canvas upon which the composers crafted evocative musical responses. 'In talking to him more,' Priday explains, 'I found it interesting that every time he does the same experiment, it comes out differently: even though the principles are the same, you just never know what's going to happen. And I related that to what a performer does - to performance and interpretation, chance and timing, how every time we play is different.' The live world premiere of these works with their multimedia accompaniment takes place on 8 October 2024 at the Meany Center for the Performing Arts in Seattle, WA, USA. There was, importantly, no fixed brief: just the chance to view some of the videos, decide what might work and consider how the music and film footage might interact. And gradually, as more and more composers eagerly took up the challenge, a larger project - of this album, and of live musical performances with visuals - was born. Each composer approached the project with a distinct perspective, from Smith's dynamic exploration of wind and water in Entangled on a Rotating Planet to Spinei's precise synchronization with fluid movements in Convection Loops and Wiancko's energetic response to swirling vortices in Waterworks. Manucharyan expressed his delight at the unexpected musical interpretations, sharing how the composers' perspectives expanded his own understanding of the experiments, creating a rich tapestry of artistic and scientific exploration, remarking, 'It was completely new! Full of suspense and very sharp transitions'.\n\nTrace of Time\n\nApollo Chamber Players\n\nAzica Records ACD-71352\n\nRelease: 23 August 2024\n\nTango and spiritual-infused reflections on diverse cultures and the passage of time, featuring Apollo commissions from Hector del Curto and Adolphus Hailstork, plus Works by Julia Smith, Jessie Montgomery, Astor Piazzolla and Agustín Bardi. In this project featuring works by Héctor Del Curto, Julia Smith, Jessie Montgomery, Adolphus Hailstork, Astor Piazzolla and Agustín Bardi, Apollo brings together a diverse patchwork of cultural stories seen partly through the lens of how they linger in our memories as time passes. Of the seven pieces featured on the album, three were commissioned by Apollo Chamber Players with the request that each composer craft a piece reflecting their heritage - yielding an album capturing influences ranging from Argentine Tango music to West African drumming patterns and African-American spirituals. Houston-based Apollo Chamber Players, the core string quartet ensemble consisting of Matthew J. Detrick and Anabel Ramirez Detrick, violins; Aria Cheregosha, viola; and Matthew Dudzik, cello - are joined on select tracks by renowned bandoneon performer Hector Del Curto and guest violists Melissa Reardon and Ashleigh Gordon. In Trace of Time, Apollo continues its mission of storytelling through music, celebrating diverse cultural experiences and bringing communities together. Their previous album, Moonstrike (Azica Records, 2022) was praised by Take Effect for 'inestimable, multi-cultured, rhythmic chamber sounds that we could never tire of'. For this new album, the thematic and cultural ideas in the music are accented by vibrant artwork created digitally on an iPad by Houston-based artist Lynn Lane, including portraits of each featured artist and composer along with cover art depicting an Argentinian street lamp, known as a 'farole'. This captivating image evokes the passage of time in one of the album's key settings while hinting at other historical references - including the use of lamps as guideposts signaling freedom on the Underground Railroad. On the new recording, Apollo Founder, Director and violinist Matthew J Detrick said: 'A journey of musical discovery and cultural connections, Trace of Time builds upon what Apollo does best - fostering the creativity of composers and creatives who reflect the dynamic and beautiful world in which we live. We hope our expanding discography will continue to create cultural harmony for generations to come'. The album's title track, Trace of Time, commissioned by Apollo from Argentine bandoneonist Héctor Del Curto, combines key musical styles from Argentina's Rio de la Plata - the Tango, the Milonga and the Waltz - while reflecting influences from his mentors and longtime collaborators Osvaldo Pugliese, Astor Piazzolla and Pablo Ziegler. (As a teenager, Del Curto was a member of Piazzolla's band.) Composed during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many shared the feeling that time had 'stopped,' the work emerged as a musical memento of that surreal period. As Del Curto wrote in his composer's note: 'This piece will, perhaps, serve me as a trace to find myself in the future when recollecting this challenging time for human history.' A second Apollo-commissioned piece by Del Curto, Bien Curiosa ('Very Inquisitive') is also featured on this album. Composed in the Milonga rhythm - a lively, upbeat style that has remained nearly unchanged since the origins of Tango music - the piece charts its own course through dissonance and chromaticism, bringing an adventurous new twist to the traditional rhythm. On the inspiration for the piece, Del Curto writes, 'This piece is dedicated to my son, Santiago Del Curto, whose innocence and curiosity led him to become an exceptional musician.' Composer Adolphus Hailstork was also commissioned by Apollo to compose a work for the ensemble's expanding new music catalog and album projects, yielding his work Deep River: Rhapsody for String Quartet. Like Astor Piazzolla, Hailstork was a student of famed Parisian pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, who encouraged both composers to embrace the music of their heritage. Deep River: Rhapsody for String Quartet is a culmination of Hailstork's love of spirituals and the gift of musical craftsmanship instilled by his teacher. Adapting a favorite spiritual, Deep River, Hailstork draws on an image of hope for enslaved people, who envisioned the crossing of a river (the Ohio, in particular) as a journey to freedom - though too often, a journey they could only imagine. 'This idea carries with it a sense of energy, of freedom, even joy and the humor they imagine upon deliverance,' Hailstork writes in his composer's note. 'A sudden interruption by the whip brings them back down to the cruelty and sadness of the situation. Eventually, sadly, they recover, and quietly embrace again the distant vision they hope to realize someday.' Julia Smith's Quartet for Strings, composed in 1964, was selected for this album for its musical themes reflecting the character and landscapes of Texas, home state to both Smith and Apollo Chamber Players. Composed in three movements - Allegro Ritmico, Lento Espressivo and Allegro Giocoso - this eclectic work captures the majesty of the Lone Star State. Its musical architecture moves from frenetic energy - with a pizzicato accompaniment evoking the sound of banjos - to melancholic dissonance to a buoyant mixed-meter dance. Apollo's performance represents the first contemporary recording of this lost work. Jessie Montgomery's Voodoo Dolls captures West African drumming patterns and lyrical chant motifs in a work commissioned and choreographed by the Jump! Dance Company of Rhode Island. A suite of dances choreographed for the piece depicts traditional dolls from around the world, from the voodoo dolls of the title to Russian Matryoshka dolls, ragdolls, marionettes and Barbie dolls. Associated with the genres of 'Nuevo Tango' and 'Avant-Garde Tango,' Argentina-born Astor Piazzolla was a protégé of both Alberto Ginastera and Nadia Boulanger. His work Tango Ballet was first recorded as a film score in 1956 (for a dance film since lost) before being re-recorded and popularized in 1964. In addition to its original arrangements for string quartet and string orchestra, the piece has been arranged throughout its history for solo piano and other instrumentation. The work unfolds across six continuous movements in a slow-fast-slow progression reminiscent of Gershwin's An American in Paris. As with Smith's Quartet for Strings, Apollo's recording represents the first contemporary rendition of this version of Tan"
