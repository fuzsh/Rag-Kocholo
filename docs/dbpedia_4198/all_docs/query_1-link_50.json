of a violin\n\nAnd she sings they say the most horrible things\n\nBut I hear violins\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nI am at the centre of the sun\n\nAnd I cannot be hurt\n\nBy anything this wicked world has done\n\nYoung boy in the market follows all the men\n\nWhen the men leave he is out of his head\n\nWhen his eyes are closed again\n\nHe sees a dark market of a violin\n\nAnd he says they break the most beautiful things\n\nBut I hear violins\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nI am at the centre of the sun\n\nAnd I cannot be hurt\n\nBy anything this wicked world has done\n\nI look into your eyes and\n\nI am at the centre of the sun\n\nAnd I cannot be hurt\n\nBy anything this wicked world has done\n\nYoung boy in the market sees the girl alone\n\nAnd asks her have you lost your way home\n\nShe sings you say the most beautiful things\n\nJust like my violins\n\nI look into your eyes\n\nI am at the centre of the sun\n\nAnd I cannot be hurt\n\nBy anything this wicked world has done\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nI am at the centre of the sun\n\nAnd I cannot be hurt\n\nBy anything this wicked world has done\n\nI hear violins at the centre of the sun\n\nI hear violins\n\nTears from the Moon\n\nSinead O'Connor :\n\nCouldn't sleep so I went out walking\n\nThinking about you and hearing us talking\n\nAnd all the things I should have said\n\nEcho now, inside my head\n\nIt just ain't fair, this thing called loving\n\nWhen one step there and the other feels nothing\n\nI would have done anything for you\n\nI still love you, baby I adore you\n\nI feel something falling from the sky\n\nI'm so sad I made the angels cry\n\nTears from the moon\n\nFall down like rain\n\nI reach for you\n\nI reach in vain\n\nTears from the moon\n\nFall down like rain\n\nBut tears from the moon\n\nCanÂ´t wash away the pain\n\nTears from the moon, tears from the moon...\n\nIt just ain't fair - this thing called loving\n\nWhen one step there and the other feels nothing\n\nI would have done anything for you\n\nI still love you, baby I adore you\n\nAll day I keep from falling apart\n\nBut at night when the sky gets dark\n\nTears from the moon\n\nFall down like rain\n\nI reach for you\n\nI reach in vain\n\nStop, stop haunting me\n\nIt should be easy\n\nAs easy as when you stopped wanting me\n\nHmm\n\nManic Star\n\nMarie Claire D'Ubaldo :\n\nOne day is one day less to live\n\nI want you to be my sedative\n\nSometimes when I drive my car\n\nI feel trapped like a be inside a jar\n\nGrains of sand is all we are\n\nCrawling on our manic star\n\nOne tiny person in one shiney car\n\nSpinning on our manic star\n\nTime does some stuff for eveyone\n\nIt does not matter what you've done\n\nI want to lose myself in you\n\nAre you afraid of dying too\n\nGrains of sand is all we are\n\nCrawling on our manic star\n\nOne tiny person in one shiney car\n\nCalling from our manic star\n\nLets love like there is no tomorrow\n\nShelter each other from the pain and sorrow\n\nManic star\n\nGrains of sand is all we are\n\nCrawling on our manic star\n\nOne tiny person in one shiney car\n\nSpinning on our manic star\n\nDon't know how I got this car\n\nCrawling on our manic star\n\nI'm alright at least so far\n\nHanging on our manic star\n\nSpinning on our manic star\n\nCalling from our manic star\n\nManic star\n\nRedemption\n\nMake A Wish\n\nPoe :\n\nYou can close your eyes it's over now\n\nIt's over now\n\nYou can close your eyes it's over\n\nBaby, baby, baby\n\nMake a wish\n\nTell me have you ever been afraid like this\n\n(It's over now)\n\nI've seen it watching me\n\nThat misty thing\n\nWithout a face\n\nIt weaves my thoughts\n\nLined them up in black lace\n\nIt buries my shape\n\nAnd leaves no trace\n\nTomorrow I will have no shame\n\nAnd I will start again\n\nMake a wish\n\nTell me have you ever felt alone like this\n\n(Over now)\n\nBetter do it, sure\n\nJust wishing\n\nI could move in some more\n\nTomorrow I will have no shame\n\nAnd I will start again\n\nMake a wish\n\nYou can close your eyes it's over now\n\nBaby I have never been afraid like this\n\nYou can close your eyes it's over now\n\nMake a wish...\n\nI took off my shoes\n\nI took off my face\n\nAnd then I undid the buttons on my dress\n\n(I will start again)\n\nMake a wish\n\nYou can close your eyes it's over now\n\nTell me have you ever been exposed like this\n\nMaybe we could savour that now\n\nBaby, baby, baby\n\nFeels like a kiss\n\nYou can close your eyes and start again\n\nI bet you never thought that I could feel like this\n\nTomorrow I will have no shame\n\nTomorrow I will have no shame\n\nMake a wish\n\nSleep\n\nMarie Claire D'Ubaldo :\n\nI know\n\nIt's late\n\nI shouldn't call at this hour\n\nBut it's\n\nMy fate\n\nI need lips to devour\n\nMy nervous system is shot alright\n\nI won't sleep unless you\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nDeep with me tonight\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nDeep with me tonight\n\n(Sleep)\n\nI know\n\nIt's late\n\nWe've known each other awhile\n\nI\n\nCan't wait\n\nTo see your twisted smile\n\nKindred spirit of candle light\n\nI won't sleep unless you\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nDeep with me tonight\n\nSleep with me tonight\n\nDeep with me tonight\n\nExtraordinary Ways\n\nEndless Dream\n\nPoe :\n\nIt's all coming, it's all coming\n\nIt's all coming, it's all coming, it's all coming, it's all coming\n\nIt's all coming back to me now\n\nThat strange and almost endless dream\n\nWhere I was you and you were me\n\nYou opened up your eyes and I could see\n\nThat you were falling from the world\n\nAs aimless as a shooting star\n\nIn all that around me thinking\n\nI was somebody else\n\nAnd terrified to look at me and\n\nSee yourself, well...\n\nYou and I could dream\n\nAnd I am just a trip you are on\n\nWhen the trip is over\n\nYou will go back to the places that you once belonged\n\nYou will look for comfort there\n\nAnd when you do you'll find that it has gone\n\nThat is when you'll dream a dream\n\nWhere I am you and you are me\n\nAnd then you'll know my love\n\nSo don't be afraid\n\nYour heart is in me and it's racing so fast now\n\n'Cause everything we ever were or ever will be\n\nIs shapeless as a changing cloud\n\nYour letter written on the sky\n\nI need you now to read it through my eyes\n\nWhen you see just what I see\n\nAnd tenderly\n\nWatch it change and just let it be\n\n'Cause I am like a dream\n\nAnd you are just a trip that I am on\n\nWhen the trip is over\n\nI will go back to the places that I once belonged\n\nAnd I will look for comfort there\n\nAnd when I do I know it will be gone\n\nThat is when I'll dream a dream\n\nWhere I am you and you are me\n\nAnd then I'll know your love\n\nSo quiet...\n\nNow...\n\nWe are the ... same\n\nThis is just some trip that we are on\n\nWhen the trip is over we will think of this\n\nAs someplace that we once belonged\n\nWhen I find no comfort here\n\nI'll look again to find it in your arms\n\nThat is where I'll dream a dream\n\nWhere I am you and you are me\n\nAnd that's where I know love\n\nFace the Music\n\nTiff Lacey :\n\nGravity is a factor\n\nFeel it pulling you in\n\nIt gets under your skin\n\nAnd you just sink in\n\nWhen the past is an anchor\n\nIt's just holding you back\n\nWhen you can't walk away\n\nSomething makes you stay, makes you stay\n\nWhat makes you turn around and do it all again (oh oh oh)\n\nYour highs and lows, they are both one and the same (oh oh oh)\n\nThere is no difference in your pleasure and your pain\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nYou can see what you can be\n\nLet go of what you have been\n\nSee the world\n\nThrough a different set of eyes\n\nIf you can face the future\n\nIt sets you free from the past\n\nTurn around, turn around\n\nYou can move on, move on\n\nWhat makes you turn around and do it all again (oh oh oh)\n\nYour highs and lows, they are both one and the same (oh oh oh)\n\nThere is no difference in your pleasure and your pain\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nWhat makes you turn around and do it all again (oh oh oh)\n\nYour highs and lows, they are both one and the same (oh oh oh)\n\nThere is no difference in your pleasure and your pain\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nWhat makes you turn around and do it all again (oh oh oh)\n\nYour highs and lows, they are both one and the same (oh oh oh)\n\nThere is no difference in your pleasure and your pain\n\nIt's time to face the music\n\nIf you can face the future\n\nIt sets you free from the past\n\nTurn around, turn around\n\nYou can move on, move on\n\nOne Word\n\nPoe :\n\nWith only one word\n\nYou took the ice out of the air again\n\nAnd put the heat back in the sun again\n\nWith only one word\n\nWith only one word\n\nYou put the weapons of the world away\n\nIt's funny how one single thing you choose to say\n\nWill change the world and then\n\nIt suddenly means something better\n\nEvery single thing I see, good or bad\n\nYou make it mean something better\n\nEvery pleasure, every pain\n\nEvery nightmare that I dream\n\nMake it mean something better\n\nWith only one word\n\nYou change the ending of a tragedy\n\nAnd summon power from the injuries\n\nWith only one word\n\nIt's funny how one single thing you choose to say\n\nWill change the world and then\n\nIt suddenly means something better\n\nEvery single thing I see, good or bad,\n\nYou make it mean something better\n\nEvery pleasure, every pain\n\nEvery nightmare that I dream\n\nMake it mean something better\n\nEvery time that I can't make a sound\n\nAnd I think that I'm starting to drown\n\nEven when I try to take you down\n\nEvery time that I think I'm alone\n\nAnd I can't find a word of my own\n\nYou take me home\n\nAnd then you change the world again\n\nWith only one word\n\nYou took a war out of my history\n\nIt's funny how one single thing you choose to see\n\nCould change the world\n\nAnd give mine back to me so much better\n\nEvery single thing I see (better)\n\nEvery single thing I dream (better)\n\nSo much better\n\nEvery pleasure, every pain (better)\n\nEvery nightmare that I dream (I dream)\n\nMake it mean something better\n\nI believe\n\nIn these times of contention\n\nIt's not my intention to make things plain\n\nI'm looking through mirrors\n\nTo catch the reflection that can't be mine\n\nI'm losing control now I'll just have to slow down a thought or two\n\nI can't feel the future and I'm not even sure that there is a past\n\nI believe in the shape of things to come\n\nAnd I believe I'm not the only one\n\nYes I believe in\n\nI believe in\n\nWhen I poison my system\n\nI take thoughts and twist them into shapes\n\nI'm reaching my nadir and I haven't an idea of what to do\n\nI'm painting by numbers but can't find the colors that fill you in\n\nI'm not even knowing if I'm coming or going if to end or begin\n\nI believe in immaculate conception\n\nAnd I believe in the resurrection\n\nI believe in, I believe in\n\nI believe in the elixir of youth\n\nAnd I believe in the absolute truth\n\nYes I believe in\n\nI believe in\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nI've fallen from favor while trying to savor experience\n\nI'm seeing things clearly\n\nBut it is quite nearly blown my mind\n\nIt's the aim of existence to offer resistance to the flow of time\n\nEverything is and that is why it is will be the line\n\nI believe in perpetual motion\n\nAnd I believe in perfect devotion\n\nI believe in, I believe in\n\nI believe in original sin\n\nAnd I believe what I believe in\n\nYes I believe in\n\nI believe in\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nThere is no love in this world anymore\n\nExtraordinary Way\n\nPoe :\n\nWhat I have is nothing to my name\n\nNo property to speak of\n\nAnd no trophy for my game\n\nIntangible and worthless\n\nMy assets on the page\n\nMy coffers are empty\n\nAny offer of safety has faded away\n\nBut what I have\n\nWhat I have is\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou take what I can give and you treasure it\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou turn to me and say, I believe in this\n\nThat makes me lucky\n\nGod, I'm lucky, so much luckier than I ever thought I'd be\n\n'Cause what I have (what I have)\n\nMeans so very little to this world\n\nA promise that I kept and a bridge that I saved before it burned\n\nThe sacrifice that I made\n\nBrought me to my knees\n\nA choice that cost me everything and set somebody else free\n\nBut what I have\n\nIs the value that you see in these things\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou take what I can give and you treasure it\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou turn to me and say, I believe in this\n\nThat makes me lucky\n\nGod I'm lucky, so much luckier than I ever thought I'd be\n\n'Cause what I have\n\nIs the value that you see in these things\n\nAnd everytime I forget those things you bring them right back to me\n\nWith your patience\n\nWhen I'm blinding mad\n\nAnd your passion\n\nWhen I'm really, really bad\n\nAnd your eyes\n\nTaking in everything I am\n\nAnd your body and soul and the way that you know\n\nHow I treasure you\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou take what I can give and you treasure it\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou turn to me and say, I believe in this\n\nThat makes me lucky\n\nGod I'm so lucky\n\nSo much luckier than I ever thought I'd be\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou take what I can give and you treasure it\n\nOn an ordinary day\n\nThe extraordinary way\n\nYou turn to me and say, I believe in this\n\nDying Light\n\nNe naaa\n\nOO haa ii\n\nNa prii, kedaa cipulija\n\nNaa

said\n\nTruth is like a fear\n\nFear of heaven\n\nTruth's your only fear\n\nFear of heaven\n\nAnd I wanna know\n\nThe highs and lows\n\nGive me something\n\nForever lost in all I try\n\nGive me something\n\nSo hard we try\n\nSold on your promises\n\nLay it on the line\n\nLay out the trauma there for me\n\nTruth is like a fear\n\nFear of heaven\n\nTruth ain't always clear\n\nClear like

on her, no imperfections\n\nShe changed your direction\n\nWhat could you do\n\nShe was fleet on foot\n\nA little sleight of hand\n\nYour life became\n\nAn hourglass with no sand\n\nWrapped up safe inside\n\nA place where you could hide\n\nShe cradled you\n\nLike your mother's arms\n\nAnd she moved like ice\n\nShe oh oh oh oh\n\nShe was cool and blue like ice\n\nNo flaws on her, no imperfections\n\nShe changed your direction\n\nWhat could you do\n\nAnd she moved like ice\n\nShe oh oh oh oh\n\nShe was cool and blue like ice\n\nHalfway between heaven and her hands\n\nWas a place for you to land\n\nWhat could you do\n\nShe was someone so undefined\n\n(She was so divine)\n\nShe was someone so hard to find\n\n(So hard to find)\n\nYou in those lost and uncertain hours\n\nYou were so safe in those ivory towers\n\nShe oh...\n\nWhat could you do\n\nShe oh oh oh oh\n\nShe was cool and blue like ice\n\nNo flaws on her, no imperfections\n\nShe changed your direction\n\nWhat could you do\n\nAnd she moved like ice\n\nShe oh oh oh oh\n\nShe was cool and blue like ice\n\nHalfway between heaven and her hands\n\nWas a place for you to land\n\nWhat could you do\n\nShe oh...\n\nAnd

vain\n\nCan't feel you anymore\n\nDon't need you anymore\n\nDon't believe you anymore\n\nI don't need you anymore\n\nIt's broken me down now\n\nThis hurts and it's hopeless\n\nCan't look to the future\n\nThe window is stained\n\nCan't feel you anymore\n\nDon't need you anymore\n\nDon't believe you anymore\n\nI don't need you anymore\n\nI don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore\n\nI don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore\n\nSatellite Girl"
