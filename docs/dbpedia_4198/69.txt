Conjure One is a Canadian electronic music project, headed by Rhys Fulber, better known as a member of Front Line Assembly and Delerium.

After performing with Front Line Assembly at the 1996 Roskilde Festival, Fulber left the band to pursue a solo career. He set up a studio in Amsterdam; the influence of life there, and traveling to the Eastern Mediterranean, gave him the idea of an ethnic ambient project. Soon after, a debut album was announced, though Fulber's work as a producer and remixer eventually pushed its release to September 2002.

The self-titled album was a fusion of the electronic characteristics of Fulber's previous work—keyboard-based, with rhythmic dance beats—and the influences of Middle Eastern music, which inspired ambient melodies more reminiscent of Delerium.
