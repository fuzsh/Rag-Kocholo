Menachem Wolfovich Begin (16 August 1913 â€“ 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the first Likud Prime Minister of Israel.

Begin fought for Poland during World War II, before being captured by the Soviets and deported to British Palestine. He then became head of the Zionist underground group Irgun, which dissolved once the State of Israel was founded.

As prime minister, Begin signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Peace together with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.

Menachem Begin in Worldwar

Menachem Begin was a leader of Jews in Palestine. During the last days of war against the Race, Begin helped kidnap Moishe Russie and his family when they arrived in Palestine, believing Russie to be a British puppet.[1] While Begin initially supported the Race over the British,[2] during the time Begin held Russie captive, he soon came to realize that the Race couldn't be completely trusted, especially when it came to turning Palestine over to the Zionists.[3] He released Russie, resolving to deal with the Lizards as best as he could, and then make them miserable.[4]
