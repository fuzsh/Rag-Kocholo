        "text": "About 0 results are shown\n\nThe Menahem Begin Border Terminal is located approximately 10 km south of Eilat, and constitutes the most southern border crossing point within the State of Israel.\n\nThe Terminal offers a view of the countries bordering southern Israel: Jordan and Egypt.\n\nThe Terminal is a passageway between the State of Israel and Egypt. Passengers eligible to cross the border include Israeli citizens and foreign tourists, who are holding a valid passport or laissez-passer with an Egyptian visa, new immigrants and Palestinians holding an Israeli laissez-passer. Pilgrims use the crossing for pilgrimage to the holy sites in Israel: Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem and the St. Catharine's Monastery in Sinai.\n\nThe Terminal was established at the foot of a steep mountain, with the Egyptian Border stretching on one side, and a coastal strip declared as a nature reserve on the other. Due to its special geographic location, the Terminal's area is limited to a narrow strip, 45 metres wide and 200 metres long. Approximately one million passengers and 70,000 vehicles pass through this confined space every year."
