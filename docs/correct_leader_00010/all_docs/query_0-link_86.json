        "text": "Likud under Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership\n\nIn the 2009 general election, Kadima again led with the most Knesset seats (28); this time, however, Likud finished in second place, a single seat behind Kadima. Because of the close and inconclusive nature of the results, it was not immediately clear whether Netanyahu or Tzipi Livni—who had been elected to lead Kadima in September 2008—would be invited to form a coalition government. Netanyahu was able to gather the support of a number of key parties in the days that followed, and, in spite of Likud’s second-place finish, Pres. Shimon Peres invited Netanyahu to form the government.\n\nLikud would remain in power under Netanyahu for more than a decade, at times by fragile coalitions and oscillating between centrist and right-wing coalitions. Though Netanyahu’s coalition initially included Labour as its only left-wing constituent, the party resigned in January 2011. In May 2012, after a dispute within the right-wing coalition over military draft exemptions for Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jews threatened to force early elections, Likud formed a short-lived unity government with Kadima. Early elections were ultimately called for January 2013, and Likud ran in a combined list with the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Both parties kept their own political platforms. The Likud–Yisrael Beiteinu bloc won the largest number of seats, returning Netanyahu to the prime ministership. However, the alliance fell short of expectations, winning fewer seats than the two parties had won separately in 2009. The bloc formed a centrist coalition with Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid and Livni’s newly formed party, Hatnua.\n\nUnsatisfied with his partnership with Yesh Atid and Hatnua, Netanyahu called for early elections, which were held in March 2015. Although analysts predicted a tight race between Likud and the Zionist Union, a centre-left alliance comprising the Labour and Hatnua parties, results showed a surprising victory for Likud, which won 30 seats, more than any other party. Netanyahu formed a narrow coalition that included small far-right parties and Yisrael Beiteinu’s Avigdor Lieberman as defense minister. According to many observers, the government was the most right-wing in Israel’s history up to that point. The coalition nearly survived a full term, but a renewed dispute over draft exemptions for Haredi Jews led to early elections.\n\nThat dispute, combined with an announcement that Netanyahu was to be indicted for criminal corruption charges, proved enough to prevent a new government from taking form in 2019. The Haredi parties and Yisrael Beiteinu were fundamentally at odds over the draft exemptions, and, after two sets of elections (one in April and one in September), Likud was unable to form a coalition without the support of both groups. Attempts to form a unity government with the centre-left Blue and White alliance likewise failed: Netanyahu insisted on serving as prime minister even as he faced indictment, and the leaders of Blue and White refused to accede.\n\nA third set of elections was set for March 2020, while Netanyahu faced a December 2019 challenge for party leadership from former cabinet member Gideon Saʿar. He survived the challenge, and, although Netanyahu faced an imminent trial, Likud made significant gains in the March elections, bolstered both by voter fatigue and by the release of the United States’ long-awaited Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, which was favourable to Israel. Although Likud still did not have enough support to form a coalition, the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country prompted a unity deal signed in late April that would allow Netanyahu to lead an emergency government for 18 months.\n\nThe unity government failed to pass an annual budget by the end of 2020, leading to the dissolution of the Knesset in December and to a new round of elections set for March 2021. Saʿar, again taking aim at Netanyahu’s leadership, formed a new party to contest the elections, taking several members of Likud with him. The new party gained only a handful of seats in the Knesset, however, while Likud achieved a number comparable to that of recent elections.\n\nBeginning in June 2021—for the first time in more than a decade—Likud entered into the opposition after being unseated by a broad spectrum of parties united in their effort to remove Netanyahu from office. But the historic coalition had disparate visions for the country’s direction, including those of right-wing parties dedicated to enforcing a Jewish identity in public institutions and that of a party that represented the interests of Israel’s large Palestinian minority. Likud stoked defections from the government’s rightmost members, and in June 2022 it forced the coalition to confront its fault lines by refusing to back urgent legislation that was nonetheless divisive for the governing coalition. Unable to move forward with that legislation, the Knesset was dissolved later that month.\n\nWhen elections were held in November 2022, Likud indirectly benefited from voters concerned about an erosion of Israel’s Jewish identity. Disaffected after the previous election by the willingness of several right-wing leaders to court the support of Palestinian citizens of Israel, many right-wing voters shifted their support to the far-right Religious Zionism Party, which had staunchly opposed sitting in a government that would rely on Palestinian support. It emerged as the third largest party in the Knesset and helped give the right-wing bloc, led by Likud, a majority of seats."
