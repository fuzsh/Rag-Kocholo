        "text": "Special note on the conflict in Israel\n\nI condemn the violent attack by the terrorist organization Hamas on the Jewish people and the State of Israel in the strongest possible terms. Click here to read my full statement. My office stands ready to assist U.S. citizens and their families during the ongoing conflict in Israel. If you or a loved one need assistance, please review the resources below. For additional support, please contact my office.\n\nEvacuation Flights:\n\nBen Gurion International Airport is still operating international flights. U.S. citizens may book commercial flights, at their own expense, to leave Israel.\n\nStarting Friday, October 13, the U.S. State Department will arrange charter flights to nearby countries to assist U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who have been unable to book commercial transit and seek a safe means of departing Israel. Individuals will be able to make their own onward travel arrangements to the destination of their choice afterwards. By taking a U.S. government coordinated transport, evacuees are obligated to repay the cost of their transportation after the fact.\n\nU.S. citizens who would like to take a charter flight should complete the State Department’s crisis intake form to receive flight information. Those seeking to be in touch with the U.S. Embassy in Israel can fill out this form or call 1-833-890-9595 or 1-606-641-0131.\n\nThe State Department will evaluate the demand from U.S. citizens for assistance in departing Israel on a real-time basis but expect these initial travel options to facilitate the safe departure of thousands of U.S. citizens per week. The overall security situation, availability and reliability of commercial transportation, and U.S. citizen demand will all influence the duration of this departure assistance.\n\nU.S. citizens in Israel should enroll in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for ongoing updates. The latest security alerts can be viewed here.\n\nResources:\n\nMedical Assistance – U.S. Embassy in Israel\n\nLatest Updates – Travel.State.gov\n\nTravel Advisories for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza\n\nLand Border Crossings/Travel Information: While Ben Gurion International Airport remains open, several major airlines have announced that they have suspended flights. Alternative flights traveling to a third country before arriving in the U.S. may be available. U.S. citizens wishing to depart Israel can check the status of Ben Gurion International Airport and flight status availability.\n\nU.S. citizens can check the status of land border crossings as listed below:\n\nAllenby/King Hussein Bridge between Israel and the West Bank at https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/land-border-crossings/alenbi/ or by calling 02-548-2600\n\nJordan River/Sheikh Hussein Crossing between Israel and Jordan near Beit Shaan at https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/land-border-crossings/jordan-river/ or by calling 04-609-3410\n\nYitzhak Rabin/Arava Crossing between Israel and Jordan near Eilat at https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/land-border-crossings/yitzhak-rabin/ or by calling 08-630-0555\n\nMenachem Begin Crossing between Israel and Egypt near Eilat at https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/land-border-crossings/menachem-begin/ by calling 08-636-0999\n\nResidents of the 1st Congressional District of Maine can contact me for assistance in dealing with Federal agencies. In order to better serve you, this form will generate a printable page that you should sign and mail to my office.\n\nInstructions\n\nPlease include all pertinent information and claim numbers in your correspondence, such as:\n\nYour Social Security number for a case involving Social Security;\n\nVA claim number for a case with Department of Veterans Affairs;\n\nTaxpayer identification number (Social Security number, if individual) for an Internal Revenue Service problem, etc.;\n\nYour address, home phone number and daytime phone number (if different than home) so that we can obtain any additional information from you that might be necessary;\n\nCopies of any related documents or correspondence that you may have from the agency involved.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a) requires that Members of Congress or their staff have written authorization before they can obtain information about an individual's case. We must have your signature to proceed with this type of request.\n\nAuthorization Form\n\n* indicates information that you need to provide.\n\nIn accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, I give Congresswoman Chellie Pingree authority to act on my behalf."
