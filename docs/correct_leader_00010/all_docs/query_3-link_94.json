        "text": "What a busy week, with so much happening!\n\nOn Sunday night the Menachem Begin Heritage Center had a long list of impressive speakers.\n\nOver 2,000 people attended the second annual Pulse of Israel Conference, “What’s Next For Israel” in person and via livestream – to learn about key issues in the future for Israel.\n\nActor Michael Rapaport was recognized with the Pulse of Israel Brave Leadership of Zion Award for his outspoken pro-Israel activism on social media. “This is my fourth time in Israel since November 2023 – before that trip, I had never been here. There has been so much suffering since October 7…”\n\nIndeed, we wonder daily what’s next.\n\nThe next night, I was back again for a special memorial tribute event to Senator Joe Lieberman z”l moderated by Paul Gross, Senior Fellow at the Center.\n\nRepresenting the family, Hani Lowenstein spoke eloquently of her father,\n\nUS Ambassador Jack Lew had a long and special relationship. They were two Democratic, Shabbat observant Jews serving together in the US government over many years.\n\nGil Troy knows how to speak to the audience during an interview and to keep them engaged.\n\nI was complimenting him after the event outside, and this family passed by leaving Liberty Bell Park.\n\nThe Knesset was a busy place the day I attended a special event there.\n\nToo often getting by the security to enter is a headache when your name is not on the computer list.\n\nBut once inside the Chagall Hall was impressive as usual.\n\nFinding the Knesset Library was simple enough to arrive on time for the announcement.\n\nIsraeli Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana announced for the first time in the history of US–Israel relations the establishment of the Knesset–House Parliamentary Friendship Group. He said it was planned for July 3rd purposely before the US Independence Day.\n\nIn progress since 2023, before October 7, Ohana was well prepared with a media presentation.\n\nUS Chair of the House–Knesset Parliamentary Friendship Group Congressman David Kustoff was in Jerusalem, Israel for the event.\n\nAmbassador Lew also spoke. I was glad for a chance to compliment his remarks about Joe Liberman z”l before the formal program began. People like to complain. I prefer to compliment when possible.\n\nJuly 4th is also Entebbe Day, the time to remember the hostage rescue and Yoni Netanyahu, its fallen leader.\n\nThe King David Hotel was ready in red, white, and blue for the Newsmax July 4th celebration.\n\nThe food was abundant, it was great to see some people again and speak with people in person and not on a screen. It was hard to leave, but I had a previous commitment.\n\nPhotos of a few friends are on Facebook\n\nA Counterpoint reunion had been planned at the Yeshiva University Israel Campus.\n\nAs with most celebrations in Jerusalem, prayers for hostages and soldiers began the program.\n\nAgain too many friends to mention, a few photos also on Facebook. so many friends, so many years.\n\nBack on the Jerusalem streets, SUMMER in the neighborhoods. It’s the long summer school holiday time.\n\nThe Jerusalem Street Orchestra if you missed them last week at the Montefiore Windmill, is planning a performance for July 22 in the garden of the National Library.\n\nSo what’s next for Israel?\n\nYou never know.\n\nBut slowly the sounds of music and life are returning to the Jerusalem streets.\n\nWhere should I begin to share a week where moods change as quickly as the weather?\n\nIt seemed every time I went outside the sun disappeared behind the clouds.\n\nOften it rained, and rained hard.\n\nBut at least one evening I was in the right place at the right time to capture the colors in the sky, and with no filters, nature’s beauty appeared before the onset of darkness.\n\nAnd look at this cactus, a wonder of nature growing so high and with new fruit.\n\nThe stalls at First Station were empty in the evening without the regular tourists in Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nThe carousel was wrapped in protective plastic and the Ferris wheel was not turning.\n\nOne Muslim man took advantage to say his nighttime prayers with no customers around.\n\nI was on my way to the Menachem Begin Center for a program with Elliot Abrams and Dennis Ross.\n\nBarbara Diamond moderated the live discussion as the two US experts discussed growing antisemitism.\n\nA video with Bill Maher concluded the evening. His method of inserting humor while presenting historical facts that counter fictional narratives was greatly appreciated.\n\nOne of too many reminders of deadly attacks in Jerusalem is this memorial plaque listing the 11 names of martyrs murdered by a suicide bus bomber on January 29, 2004.\n\nA reminder that 20 years ago, there were also calls for an intifada. Do people have such short memories?\n\nCar-rammings became a new method of terrorism. Bigger, higher, and better bollards are now placed at Jerusalem bus stops to protect people waiting to board a bus.\n\nBut the Jerusalem streets, even during this October 7 wartime, are not shut down and dark.\n\nThe annual Shaon Horef, Winter Noise Festival is scheduled for the next four Monday nights on various Jerusalem streets.\n\nThe runners are out training for the Jerusalem Marathon set for the morning of March 8, 2024.\n\nThis week, at the Friends of Zion Museum, the Government Press Office held an evening event. Maayan Hoffman moderated a panel that included international journalists based in Israel.\n\nCBN’s Chris Mitchell listened to Israel spokesperson Eylon Levy, while I was more focused on his socks.\n\nThousands of journalists came from around the world after the October 7 Massacre. I decided not participate in those early trips to see the death and destruction.\n\nThe panel with family members of the hostages was a somber conclusion to the evening. It boggles the mind that so many around the world deny the proof from videos and testimonies of survivors.\n\nSome of the families of hostages have traveled the world to give testimony to get their stories told.\n\nIn the same place where the protest tents for the release of Gilad Shalit were, new are ones calling for the return of today’s hostages.\n\nFrustrated after four months of captivity, protesters have taken to the Jerusalem streets calling for release.\n\nThe lights on Rivlin Street on the way to the Friends of Zion were twinkling on Thursday night.\n\nI started on a positive note with colors in nature and want to end with one particularly colorful event.\n\nBack on Thursday night, I was again at the FoZ for the opening of the Indigenous Embassy in Jerusalem with the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe program began with a moment to remember those murdered in the horrors of October 7.\n\nThen we heard about the love of Israel coming from around the world, from Hawaii to Tonga.\n\nTraveling thousands of miles to stand with and pray for the people of Israel.\n\nIEJ is to become a hub for indigenous peoples visiting Israel and a tangible expression of their support. IEJ will also support and promulgate the academic work being undertaken to respond to false narratives.\n\nHowever, IEJ does not purport to be an official representative of any of the governments that host nations of the respective indigenous peoples. It will engage in educational and cultural initiatives and mutually beneficial collaborative projects.\n\nThe Solomon Brothers added musical highlights to the event. But, when many participants got up to dance to Hava Nagliah, I thought it was my time to go home.\n\nIt’s over ten years since Ryan Bellerose shared his enlightening essay on Indigenous peoples. I thought of him throughout the evening even though he was not there in person.\n\nClosing with a video also from 10 years ago, the prayer for Israeli soldiers.\n\nAt that time IDF tanks were lined up along the Gaza border.\n\nThen, international opinion forced a ceasefire.\n\nHoping for the return of all the hostages and less gloomy days ahead on the Jerusalem streets.\n\nWith political polarization, stormy weather, earthquakes, deaths from car rammings, and threats of terror from the streets of Jerusalem to Israeli rescue teams in Turkey, some weeks are harder than others to find the positive moments.\n\nHowever, Tu BiShvat is a time of renewal, in nature we saw the blossoms of the almond trees and colorful flowers early this year.\n\nThe Knesset’s birthday is celebrated on Tu Bishvat. Remember in January 2016, the Knesset held a major celebration with an open house?\n\nAnd Keren Kayemet/JNF gave away plants and herbs to everyone,\n\nand there was a service in the Knesset Synagogue and much more.\n\nNo big Tu Bishvat open houses at the Knesset this year.\n\nHowever, I did see people actually working in the future Knesset Museum.\n\nThis old photo from the original Knesset Building in 2016 shows little progress after so many years to develop it as a Knesset Museum.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tu Bishvat i24 News got a look into the Knesset’s storeroom, which houses the gifts presented by foreign dignitaries to Israeli leaders.\n\nThe Rivlins hosted a Tu Bishvat seder for agricultural growers at Beit Hanasi in 2017. Then as President, Reuven Rivlin hosted various other events for Tu Bishvat in the following years.\n\nThe Herzogs did not host a Tu Bishvat event.\n\nA favorite celebration was the Malida at the Bible Lands Museum for Tu Bishvat in January 2020. Just before the world shut down we learned of the fascinating customs and beautiful Tu Bishvat customs from India.\n\nBut new this year in time for Tu Bishvat, with dried fruits for the centerpieces, was a major (to be annual) event for OU Israel at the Psagot Winery.\n\nWhenever I got invited to Psagot I make an effort to attend, not only are the wine and food good, but the view I try and update, remembering when those hills were barren and the Winery was alone in the area.\n\nJerusalem’s Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan Nahoum was called to give a Tu Bishvat message at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center before the panel discussion on Judaism and Zionism.\n\nAnd to conclude with one more unique invitation I received this year:\n\nWe pray for a refuah shleima of Rafael Moshe Tzvi Hirsh ben Shayna Chavah and all the sick and injured in Jerusalem, and around the world.\n\nAt this Tu Bishvat Seder along with the dried fruit and wine and juices were hamentashen, the first of the Purim treats I have seen served this year.\n\nSo with earthquakes, protests, terror attacks, and threats, the seasons roll around again, as the sun rises and a new week begins.\n\nIn spite of some of the Tu Bishvat events of previous years not happening, this year was so eventful that I never shared one of my favorite images for this time of year. This is an original mural in the Jerusalem Cinema City that I made as a Shabbat Shalom poster years ago.\n\nMuch more is happening this week ahead on the Jerusalem streets, with the February international conferences returning.\n\nHope to see you soon on the Jerusalem streets."
