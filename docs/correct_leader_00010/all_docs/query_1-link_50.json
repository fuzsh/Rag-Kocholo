        "text": "1913- 1992\n\nIsraeli Politician\n\nBorn in Brest Litovsk, Russia, in 1913, Menachem Begin started his education at Warsaw University Law School. He joined Betar, the Revisionist Jewish youth movement in 1929. After the fall of Poland, Begin was incarcerated by the Russians. In 1942, he was released and went to Palestine in the uniform of a Polish soldier.\n\nIn 1944, Begin became commander of the Irgun. This underground organization fought the British, and was often criticized for its extremist tactics. One of their most publicized actions was blowing up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which was serving as a British military headquarters. After the Declaration of Independence, Begin and his group submitted to the authority of the new state and agreed to disband their organization.\n\nBegin was elected to the first Knesset as the leader of the Herut Party. He remained in the opposition until 1967, when his party joined a unity government. In 1969, Herut resigned from the government over a disagreement on negotiating platforms."
