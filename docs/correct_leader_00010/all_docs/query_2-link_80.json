For the first 25 years of its existence, the State of Israel had not been eager to see Ethiopian Jews enter the country, and the government deemed them non-Jews for the purposes of immigration.

This thesis identifies the Likud Party’s unexpected victory in the 1977 Israeli election as a critical turning point in this historic saga. Prime Minister Menachem Begin, motivated by deeply held beliefs about the historical role of Zionism to uplift and end the persecution of Jews worldwide, aggressively sought the immigration of Ethiopian Jews to Israel at a potentially high diplomatic cost—including risking a rift in relations with the United States by selling arms to Ethiopia’s Marxist regime.",
