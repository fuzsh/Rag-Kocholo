        "text": "Begin earned a law degree from the University of Warsaw in 1935. During this time, he was active in Zionism. This was a movement to set up a Jewish homeland in Palestine, in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Warsaw. Begin escaped. He joined other Polish soldiers and went to Palestine in 1942. From 1943 to 1948, Begin led an extreme Zionist group that attacked both British and Arab residents of Palestine.\n\nThe Jewish country of Israel was created in 1948. Members of Begin’s Zionist group then formed a political party. Begin became the head of the party. He served in the Knesset, or Israeli parliament.\n\nBegin became Israel’s prime minister in 1977. He soon participated in peace talks with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. Israel and Egypt had been enemies since Israel was formed. In 1967 Israel had taken over the Sinai Peninsula, which had belonged to Egypt.\n\nBegin and Sadat won the Nobel prize for peace in 1978. The next year, they signed a peace treaty. Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.\n\nAlthough he had made peace with Egypt, Begin refused to negotiate with Palestinian Arabs. He did not want to grant them control of the regions known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn 1982 Begin ordered an invasion of Lebanon. The main Palestinian group, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was based there. Israeli forces drove the PLO out of Lebanon. However, many civilians (nonmilitary people) died.\n\nBegin resigned as prime minister in 1983. He died on March 9, 1992, in Tel Aviv–Yafo, Israel."
