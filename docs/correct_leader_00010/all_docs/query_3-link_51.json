        "text": "SEPTEMBER 24\n\nIn his recently published “Leadership,” a study of the nature and uses of political power, the biographer and historian James MacGregor Burns distinguishes between “transforming” and “transactional” leaders. The transforming leaders are those who by precept and/or example influence events by changing minds or by stirring people to action and a new sense of purpose. In their different ways, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, on both of whom Burns has written extensively, fall into this category. The transactional leaders effect change, or parlay it, by putting together winning combinations of people and interests. They assemble coalitions and trade in the soft currency of compromise and accommodation. In his career in the Senate and in his first years as President, Lyndon Johnson was an almost perfect model of the type, and the style was also Richard Nixon’s. Until he got to the White House, it seemed to be Jimmy Carter’s, too. But once in office he seemed more a product of luck and fortuitous timing. He certainly wasn’t, and isn’t, a transforming leader; it is doubtful if anyone has ever been heard to say that he found Carter’s reasoning so compelling that it forced him to change his mind, or his appeals so moving that they overcame indifference. And Carter certainly seemed maladroit in political transaction. The coalition he assembled, or that assembled behind him, two years ago, began to collapse in his first months in office.\n\nBut in the aftermath of the tripartite meetings at Camp David it appears that Carter has performed a remarkable feat of transactional leadership. “Such leadership occurs,” Burns says, “when one person takes the initiative in making contact with others for the purpose of an exchange of valued things.” Carter took the initiative and made contact with others, the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of Egypt, for an exchange of valued things—of which the most highly valued were security for Israel and the repossession by Egypt of territories lost in 1967. It is entirely possible—many think it likely—that some of the agreements reached by Menachem Begin and Anwar al-Sadat will before long be dead letters. It is clear that the two men have, or now profess to have, different understandings of some of the language in the documents they agreed to before leaving the wooded hilltop in Maryland and signed in Carter’s presence before television cameras in the White House. Begin says that no matter what political institutions are established on the West Bank of the Jordan there will be Israeli troops there as long as Israel feels they are needed. “The Bible is our mandate,” he said in Washington “I believe with all my heart that the Jewish people have a right to sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip.” (Since the modern concept of sovereignty seems applicable only in the age of nation-states, it is not clear how any “people” could have established a “right” to it millennia ago.) The whole question of the future of the Israeli civilian enclaves in the occupied—or, as the Israelis prefer to say, “administered”—territories was finessed and may not soon be resolved. Begin may not want it resolved. In any event, Carter’s achievement is as large as it was unexpected. Before the conference, he was being advised that he was courting disaster—diplomatic, political, personal—by taking the initiative, by making the contacts, by involving himself in the exchange. There was, he was told, mutual distrust and dislike between Begin and Sadat; each thought the other a racist. They hadn’t been able to communicate even through intermediaries. Sadat couldn’t make a separate peace, because the Saudi Arabians wouldn’t stand for it. Begin would never yield on the West Bank. If nothing came of the meetings, Carter would hit bottom in the opinion polls. His relations with Congress would worsen. He would confirm the widespread view that he was incompetent. What was left of his energy and tax programs would be as dead as any hope for a settlement. In November, the Democrats would pay a fat price for the September fiasco.\n\nMoreover, Carter’s plans for Camp David violated all the rules of modern summitry. The first of these is that heads of state and government do not come together until they have been assured by ambassadors and other negotiators that firm, enforceable agreements have been concluded and wait only their seals and signatures. The meetings are pro forma, ceremonial, celebratory. When Theodore Roosevelt summoned Russian and Japanese spokesmen to a peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1905, he knew that the belligerents were tired of fighting, eager to call it quits, ready for his services as a mediator. Carter knew that Begin and Sadat were battle-weary men, and that, while Sadat might accept American arbitration if it could be suitably camouflaged, Begin was in principle opposed to mediation, holding that peace could be arranged only when Israel could negotiate directly with the confronting states, one at a time. And Carter would set no time limits for his mediating efforts. Even when summit meetings are little more than rituals of ratification, it is imperative that the business at hand be done quickly. Familiarity may not necessarily breed contempt among national leaders, but it is likely to stiffen what animosity and stubbornness already exist, and in a meeting of Israelis and Egyptians there would be plenty of both. When sessions last for more than a few days—and Carter expected these would last for a minimum of a week—the world will assume, and generally with reason, that the summiteers can’t agree on much of anything. And since summit meetings are conceived mostly as media events, there is not much point in staging them when the press and television are to be kept at a distance. Press conferences and briefings are almost institutionalized features of modern diplomacy, and are never more valuable than on those occasions when not everything has been wrapped up in advance. Sometimes concessions that cannot be obtained at the green-baize negotiating tables (there were none of these traditional fixtures at Camp David) may be won by taking the case to the world through the press. At some meetings, there has been spirited competition to draw reporters to one side or another by holding briefings in the most attractive settings—with drink, food, entertainment, etc.—and retaining the most plausible and engaging briefing officers. It was clear almost from the outset that the tripartite meetings planned by Carter were not going to be tripartite in any literal sense. Begin, Sadat, and their attentive, patient host were sequestered in a well-appointed but essentially barracks-like encampment in the Catoctin Mountains (where, nearly twenty years ago, Nikita Khrushchev and Dwight Eisenhower, having quickly reached an agreement that coexistence was the only alternative to nonexistence, announced the end of the Cold War), but after the first two days, when the President and his eminent guests had met for a total of seven hours, Carter found himself engaged in a mini-mini-mini-version of Henry Kissinger’s shuttle diplomacy—one house in the compound being Tel Aviv, another Cairo, and a third, the largest, Washington. Aside from the fact that the traffic was mostly pedestrian, the principal difference was that the power centers were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards, thus reducing the press, billeted several miles away in makeshift headquarters, to studying official photographs to calculate the warmth of embraces and speculating on the significance of smiles, which were suspiciously abundant in the pictures that were released. As the meetings threatened to rival the Congress of Vienna in duration, though hardly in splendor, some correspondents “covering” the portentous gathering, officially described as an effort to construct a “framework for peace,” were called in briefly—not to satisfy their curiosity and the world’s but to observe some martial choreography by a crack drill team from the Marine Corps. This seemed less than a good omen, and, until the very end, those who had all along regarded the whole enterprise as misbegotten had no reason to think otherwise. Carter seemed headed for a failure of his own contrivance, one that in personal and political terms might prove more costly to him than to his guests.\n\nNow, no matter what happens in the coming months, he can be credited with a smashing success in transactional leadership. His accomplishment will only in small part be diminished if the “framework” proves structurally unsound. Through his mediation, Israel and Egypt are no longer stalled at what Sadat, on his arrival in this country, called a “crucial crossroads.” Though the two nations cannot describe it as such, they have concluded a separate peace. It is separate in two senses—in that it is a peace between Israel and only one of the several countries it has warred against over the last thirty years, and in that the agreement is not contingent on progress being made toward settlement with the other belligerents. If implementation should prove impossible—and this seems unlikely as long as Sadat is as secure in Egypt as he seems to be—the responsibility will be that of the former adversaries, not Carter’s. He brought them together; if they can’t stay together, no one can blame him. If implementation proves merely difficult, rather than impossible, Carter or his Secretary of State can again offer American mediation and do so in an atmosphere made more hopeful by his original success at Camp David. Begin may go on arguing from theology and anguished memories of the Holocaust, but he has agreed to self-governance for the Palestinian Arabs. Sadat once said that he felt honor-bound to act only in concert with Israel’s other neighbors; one doubts that he ever really felt that way, but he had a need—economic, political, moral—to maintain a sense of solidarity. Now, under pressure from Carter, he has agreed to deal separately with Israel, while continuing to exert his own pressure on Israel to gain autonomy for those on the West Bank and the withdrawal of Israeli settlements. Perhaps these things might have been accomplished by others, but while there have been many tries—most recently in Britain, in July—it was Carter who promoted the transactions, who twisted arms and knocked heads together until the deals were made. He could not, of course, have done it except against the background of American power. The sale of the latest in combat aircraft to Egypt and Saudi Arabia was a great sweetener. But it was one of the few recent uses of American power that seems altogether honorable.\n\nIt was also dictated by self-interest—his own and the country’s. Before Camp David, there was a good deal of loose talk about whether the President should serve as a “full partner”—the role Sadat obviously preferred—or as an “honest broker,” which is what Begin wanted him to be, since Begin feared, quite rightly, that at this stage more would be asked of him than of Sadat. These Wall Street terms were inappropriate and inapplicable. Carter was, willy-nilly, a partner of both his guests, though he could easily have avoided at least the appearance of assuming a partner’s responsibility. As a mediator, he could be honest, but he could not be disinterested. The American subsidy to Israel comes to about five hundred dollars a year for every man, woman, and child in the country—more than the per-capita income in much of the world. We do not give much direct aid to the other Middle East nations, but we have helped arm some of them, and our oil purchases are used by some of the richer ones to support the poorer ones; part of what Americans pay for gas at the pump is a tax for the support of welfare programs in Egypt and elsewhere. No one in Washington today can formulate Middle East policy without factoring in a number of domestic concerns: the plight of the dollar, our need for oil, the political power of the Israeli lobby, the dangers and costs of helping to maintain armed camps in the region. It may be that these considerations foster a species of objectivity—that our obligations are in some kind of balance and cancel each other out. But ever since Begin came to power, and particularly since Sadat showed up in Jerusalem last November, this country has pressed more heavily on Israel than on the countries around it. However the Israelis conceived their national interest, our interest, it was felt, required an early settlement, and the Administration view was that Sadat had laid the necessary groundwork by agreeing to recognize Israel, by acknowledging its right to security, and by being ready to negotiate such matters as border adjustments and the future of the West Bank. These were the concessions that all Begin’s predecessors had asked and that the United States had supported them in asking. From then on, it was up to Begin, and at Camp David he yielded, with undisguised reluctance, nearly all of what Washington has been urging him to yield.\n\nIf there had been failure at the summit, Washington would have had to come up with a new policy—or a new strategy for advancing established policy. But what we now think of as established policy has undergone a good deal of revision and amendment over the last thirty years. Our national interest as perceived by Carter, and before him by Presidents Nixon and Ford, is different from what it was in the mid-sixties, and in the preceding decade it was still different. Under Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, the Middle East was simply one more theatre of operations in the Cold War. Our aim then was to kindle and quicken anti-Communist sentiment in the Arab and Moslem states and to beef up militarily those that seemed likely targets of Soviet aggression or good potential allies in the global struggle. Along with Britain and France, we were committed to the territorial integrity of the Israel that then existed—to this, Moscow had no objections—but our larger commitment, and the one for which enthusiasm ran highest, was to the containment of Soviet power behind the series of undulating borders that ran, roughly west to east, from Turkey to French Indo-China. (It was assumed that Chinese power was an instrument or an extension of Soviet power.) A decade later, we were less concerned about invasions mounted by the Red Army. It was clear that Moscow didn’t intend to play the game that way. What we thought of as its expansionist designs were to be executed by surrogates like the North Koreans, and our defeat of them encouraged us to believe that we had found a way to deal with that strategy, as, in a way, we had. In the sixties, our fears were of infiltration and subversion and of the possibility that Arab troops, fired with Moslem or Marxist zeal and equipped with Soviet weapons, would overrun Israel. Then, as earlier, little thought was given to the Palestinian Arabs. They were an inconvenient, unwelcome people, feared by the Jews on the west and by the Bedouins and Hashemites on the east. Until 1967, they were wards of Jordan, and those of their grievances that might be legitimate and redressable could be studied and dealt with—perhaps by the United Nations, through which at least some of their physical needs were being met—once the threats posed by the Soviets had been countered. Today, those threats do not seem very large. Sadat sent his Russian advisers and technicians packing six years ago and now relies on superior ordnance from the West. The big oil suppliers, chiefly Iran and Saudi Arabia, are as anti-Communist as Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, and as ruthless as the Bolsheviks in dealing with dissent of any kind. All this, of course, could change, possibly in a matter of weeks or months. The Shah could be overthrown, and so could Sadat, and his successor could invite the Russians back in. But after Camp David this seems unlikely, at least in the year or two that anyone can describe with confidence as the foreseeable future. What the Soviets had to offer was little more than arms for another war or terrorist incursions; what the Egyptians, the Syrians, and all but the most extremist factions in the Palestine Liberation Organization wanted was not so much military hardware (though there will always be a clamor for that) as the kind of pressure on Israel that would lead to the agreements Carter sought and, for the most part, got. The Soviet Union was the last country on earth that could have helped them gain those ends. What Carter found so difficult, no one would have asked Leonid Brezhnev to attempt.\n\nSuccess at Camp David has brought a sharp rise in Carter’s standing in the opinion polls, and this has its dangers. Like producers of commercial entertainment, he and his euphoric advisers may be thinking in terms of sequels and spinoffs. Robert Strauss, his economic trouble-shooter, has proposed a Camp David summit on inflation, with leaders of big labor and big business shooting pool, riding bicycles, and talking wage-price formulas behind the barbed wire. (Someone has suggested that the Begin-Sadat meeting might not have worked if Eisenhower had not changed the camp’s name to David, after his grandson, from Shangri-la, the snowy nirvana in James Hilton’s “Lost Horizon,” a utopian romance published the year Roosevelt took office. If Carter had had to say to Begin and Sadat, “Come with me to Shangri-la and we’ll straighten up this mess,” the enterprise might have struck them as being touched with daftness as well as being bold and risky.) Tangled domestic problems do not often lend themselves to this kind of negotiation. Sadat and Begin arrived in the Catoctins with a clear understanding of the interests they represented. The details for settlements—the “valued things” to be exchanged—could be described in quantitative, almost arithmetical terms: weeks, months, years, kilometres, sites on maps, balances of force, and so on. Inflation involves a congeries of interests beyond the reach of integral and differential calculus, and no handful of people can speak for them as Sadat and Begin spoke for Egypt and Israel. And it may be that Carter and his aides can be of little help in the transactions yet to be made in the Middle East. The Secretary of State has gone there to seek support for the accords from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria. The Saudis, as expected, said little more than that they would not wreck the deal; Sadat must have had that assurance a year ago. Hussein said he would take it under advisement; he has had it there for some time. The Syrians asked Vance to stay away until the end of the summit of hard-liners (Libya, Algeria, Southern Yemen, Syria, and the P.L.O.), who were meeting in Damascus and planning to raise a kitty of a billion dollars for Sadat’s overthrow. It could be that Carter should decline to become any further involved, avoid seeking an American solution in a situation foreign to American experience. In his Jeffersonian, Wilsonian mind, the issue probably has a number of clear answers. It is not with the consent of the governed that Israel is governing the West Bank Palestinians. The occupation should be terminated and the Arabs left free to make their own political arrangements, develop their own institutions, and take their place in the world community. The responsibilities that come with sovereignty and the removal of causes for hatred and violence would probably give rise to moderate leaders, and in any event Israel would be secure—perhaps more so when the defense perimeters are contracted and Israeli troops no longer posted in hostile territories that serve the country only by providing locations for forward and logistically difficult bases. But these are American answers to the problems of others, and almost certainly simplistic ones. Sovereignty may or may not encourage moderation, though apparently even the prospect of it has led Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., to confer with King Hussein, who once expelled him and his followers from Jordan. Among the most belligerent of powers have been many whose sovereignty has never been disputed. It is undoubtedly hard and more costly to defend long borders than short ones. But the Israel of 1967 was more vulnerable to attack than the Israel of today, and weaponry now is far more advanced than it was then. Sadat sees five years as a reasonable period in which to provide for withdrawal from the West Bank, which means that he sees no quick and easy fix arranged in the Maryland woods by an American President. ♦"
