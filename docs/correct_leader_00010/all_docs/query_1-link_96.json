        "text": "Pars Today – March 9 is the anniversary of Menachem Begin, Butcher of Deir Yasin.\n\nThis Israeli terrorist, on a day in April 1948, without any pre-warning, at the command of Irgun terrorist group stepped in the beautiful village of Deir Yasin at the heights looming over Occupied Qods and before sunset, leveled the Palestinian region with centuries of background in civilization.\n\nHere, we are going to touch upon 6 parts of the life of this terrorist.\n\n1. Family\n\nMenachem Begin, former Israeli Prime Minister, as one of the most famous Zionist extremist figures and leader of the rightist Likud Party, was born in 1913 in the Brest-Litovsk on the Polish border with Belarus.\n\nHis father, Ze'ev Dov Begin, was an extremist Zionist and his mother, Hassia Begun, was from a renowned rabbi family.\n\n2. Onset of terrorist activities\n\nIn 1929, when Menachem Begin was just a 16-year old teen, hearing the thoughts and opinions of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, became strongly enthusiastic towards the innovated school of this revisionist Zionist. This strong zeal caused him to become a member of Betar terrorist organization which turned into a ladder for his rapid progress so that, at the age of 17, he became the commander of Betar in Brest Litovsk.\n\nIn 1935, as Betar terrorist organization had grown significantly, Menachem was considered as one of its famous officials and took part as one of the leaders of the terrorist organization at Betar International Congress in Krakow.\n\n3. Going to Palestine\n\nMenachem Begin arrived in Palestine in early 1942.\n\nAfter entering Palestine, he started working as a translator of English language for army commanders in Haifa and then Beit-ul-Moqaddas. In September the same year, all duties of the Betar terrorist organization in Palestine were given over to him.\n\nIn 1943, Begin took over the chairmanship of Irgun organization, a military-terrorist establishment.\n\nDuring the years 1942- 1948, he launched different terrorist operations against Arab Palestinians and British government forces including mass execution of Arabs, demolition of public places and destruction while most of these acts were implicitly approved by Zionist leaders.\n\nAmong terrorist operations of Menachem Begin and his notorious organization was the explosion of \"King David\" hotel, the British government's base and the most heinous and gruesome among them was the massacre of the defenseless people of \"Deir Yasin\".\n\nMenachem Begin has taken so many terrorist measures that the British spying apparatus has dubbed him as the \"Greatest Zionist Terrorist\".\n\nBegin started one of his speeches in New York with this sentence, \"I am a former terrorist!!!\"\n\n4. Political Activities\n\nAfter the fabrication of the \"Israeli state\" and implantation of this cancerous tumour in Palestine in 1948, Menachem Begin embarked on foundation of the fascist Zionist party \"Herut\" (freedom).\n\nAs the head of Herut Party, he had a journey to the United States to request financial assistance. During the trip, \"Hana Arendt\" and some of the Jewish intellectuals, in an open letter to New York Times, described Begin as \"seriously resembling Nazis and Fascists in organization, methods, political philosophy and social demand\". The letter had a made a reference to the massacre in Deir Yasin where 240 inhabitants of the village were murdered in cold blood. This letter was signed by great physician, Albert Einstein, too.\n\nIn September 1973, Menachem Begin set up Likud Party through coalition of all rightist parties and unexpectedly gained victory in the 1977 elections.\n\nAfter Begin's victory in the elections, the Global Zionism tried through vast propagation, to erase the previous monstrous image of Begin in minds and depict him as a politician and a principled, frank and honest figure.\n\n5. Nobel Peace Prize\n\nIt should be said that the Nobel Peace Prize is more a means for adornment of demons of massacre rather than a symbol of \"peace\".\n\nWhile persons like Mahatma Gandhi never won Nobel Prize for Peace, the prize was given to those whose hands are plunged in the blood of innocent people in the world, notorious people like Henry Kissinger and Menachem Begin.\n\nIn 1978, Menachem Begin together with then Egyptian President, Anwar Sadat got Nobel Peace Prize for negotiations with Egypt and concluding of so-called peace.\n\nThe event instigated global fury and protest.\n\n6. End of political activities and Death\n\nMenachem Begin came to power again as the Zionist premier in 1981, but in 1983 gave up politics due to disease. He died on March 9, 1992."
