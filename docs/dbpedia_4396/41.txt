WFLZ. Power 93. THE POWER PIG! The station that brought down Tampa’s heritage CHR Q105 (WRBQ) in just 3 months! Shortly after they went on-the-air in late 1989, I received a poor quality, multi-generation dubbed cassette of The Power Pig. Immediately, I wanted to work there. So did thousands of other young, aspiring CHR jocks. Most of whom were better on-the-air than I was. Which explains why I only got as close as Ocala. Fortunately, Ocala was close enough to at least hear WFLZ. If I couldn’t work for ’em, I could at least listen and aircheck ’em!

In late 1991, nights on Power 93 were handled by Hawk Harrison and Marty McFly. Their brand of irreverent humor was perfect for nights on the Pig. This aircheck runs about 9 minutes, so I have broken it into 2 parts. All the sweepers and imaging are included. The “Fishing License” bit is a variation on “Hunting License”, which I heard the Greaseman do several years earlier on Jacksonville’s WAPE-AM 690. In short, this is the Power Pig at the peak of it’s popularity.

As mentioned, this aircheck was recorded from Ocala. I used a Realistic AM/FM/CD/cassette portable stereo unit with a modified outdoor TV antenna. It was “modified” by climbing up onto my rented mobile home and cutting the long (VHF-LO) elements down to resonance for FM frequencies. Then, pointing it at Tampa instead of Orlando. It worked great, as you will hear.
