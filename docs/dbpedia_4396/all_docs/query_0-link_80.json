        "text": "Correspondent: CarolAnn Popovich www.CarolAnnPopovich.com\n\nPhotographers: Aric Popovich, Red Carpet; Karen Wain, Stage\n\nEditor: Don of Don411.com\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Tampa Bay iHeartRadio 93.3 FLZ’s Jingle Ball 2016 annual holiday concert at AMALIE® Arena, presented by Capital One, was a star-studded, two-thumbs-up success. Saturday, December 17, this year’s tourism ambassador and headliner Pitbull was joined by a few of the biggest and somewhat newer names in the pop-music and EDM industry including The Chainsmokers, Fifth Harmony, DNCE, Lukas Graham, Martin Garrix and Daya.\n\nKane & Scotty Davis, 93.3 FLZ’s on-air personalities, announced the first group for the evening: The Chainsmokers. The country’s hottest pop duo, Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, were first to take center stage promptly at 7:00 PM. The crowded arena jumped to their feet as they opened with ‘Roses’ and never sat down as the went into their newer music to include their three Top 10 singles of this year. Daya, an 18 years old Pittsburgh native who released her debut album earlier this year, “Sit Still Look Pretty,” took the stage with The Chainsmokers for their closing number. Together they performed their Grammy nominated ‘Don’t Let Me Down.’ When asked about her collaborations with The Chainsmokers, “Everything they produce turns to gold…I would do it again.” Daya’s performance was clearly a crowd-pleaser. As she performed her pop-music hits, it was evident this recent high school graduate had made her way past up-and-coming performer.\n\nJon Bellion, a hip-hop and rock singer-songwriter who also released his first album this year and recently won a Grammy at the 57th annual Grammy Awards, took the stage following Daya. Immediately following Bellion was the fairly new pop-rock band, DNCE. Every song was a home run with the fans. The crowd was on their feet as the lead singer Joe Jonas, formerly a part of the Jonas Brothers, along with drummer Jack Lawless, guitarist JinJoo and bassist Cole Whittle, sang songs such as the Billboard’s Top 100 #9 on hit song “Cake by the Ocean.” Their reply when asked what was best about 2016: “Winning a best new artist VMA and the celebration afterward.” The group also expressed their eagerness to continue touring and making new music in 2017.\n\nFollowing DNCE, was another pop-rock group, Lukas Graham. This Danish group, who released their first album in 2012, performed a more soulful set. Their performance was strong, and it was evident they intended to convince their fans that they were well on their way to becoming much more than a small Danish band with one very recognizable hit. When asked about his great 2016 moments, frontman Lukas Forchhammer expressed “becoming a father and receiving a Grammy nomination” for their piano ballad hit song ‘7 years’ which peaked at #2 on Billboard’s Top 100.\n\nFifth Harmony’s electrifying energy filled the stage and the arena. The group of 5 ladies, who originally came together in 2012 as the result of the X Factor show, have won 3 VMAs and 7 Teen Choice Awards. Immediately following Fifth Harmony was the #1 EDM DJ in the world Martin Garrix. This 20-year old from Amsterdam is the youngest ever to receive the award. Earlier that evening when asked about such accolades and accomplishments that include releasing his first song, ‘Animals,’ at the age of 15, starting his record label in 2016, and closing day one Ultra Main Stage in March of 2016, Garrix replied:\n\n“It’s weird, it’s a dream come true.\n\n“Five years ago, I was a visitor in the crowd at Ultra and heard someone play one of my songs during their set. It was amazing. I love Ultra. I first performed there 4 years ago.”\n\n“To me, I am on the list of all the people I look up to. I started making music and DJing because of Tiesto; so, being presented with the #1 EDM DJ in the world award from him was unbelievable.”\n\nMartin Garrix’s performance did not disappoint and left the crowd eager for Pitbull. The Miamian took the stage in true get-the-party-started fashion. For over 20 minutes, AMALIE® Arena was tranformed into like a happening Latin club as Florida’s biggest pop ambassador performed and closed out the night with his popular hip-hop music.\n\nJingle Ball 2016 Facts and Take Aways\n\nThe Chainsmokers:\n\nOpened with Roses\n\nClosed with Don’t Let Me Down with Daya\n\nJingle Ball was first of 3 shows that night; also performed in Orlando and DR\n\nCloser was the first #1 single, first debuted at Sunset Music Festival in Tampa\n\nFormed together in 2014; First performance as group was at Sunset Music Festival in 2014\n\nhttp://www.thechainsmokers.com/\n\nDaya\n\n18 years old; born in Pittsburgh\n\nHit song, Hide away, reached #23 on Billboard’s Top 100\n\nGraduated high school in June\n\nDaya means compassion or kindness\n\nGrammy nomination with the Chainsmokers\n\nInterview:\n\nReleased first album was best part of 2016\n\nLoved working with the chainsmokers, “Everything they produce turns to gold”, would do it again\n\nhttp://www.theofficialdaya.com/\n\nJon Bellion\n\nborn in Long Island, New York\n\nReleased his first album this year\n\nhttp://www.jonbellion.com/\n\nDNCE\n\nFunk pop, dance rock band, started in 2015\n\nLeading singer is Joe Jonas, who used to be part of Jonas Brothers\n\nNominated for Favorite New Artist in 2016\n\nHit song “Cake by the Ocean” reached #9 on Billboard’s Top 100\n\nInterview:\n\nBest moment of 2016; winning a “best new artist” VMA and celebrating afterwards\n\nMost excited for touring and making new music in 2017\n\nhttp://www.dnce.com/\n\nLukas Graham\n\nDanish pop and soul band\n\nHit song “7 years” peaked at #2 on Billboard’s Top 100\n\nFirst album released in 2012 was #1 on Danish charts\n\nInterview:\n\nBest part of 2016 was becoming a father, and receiving a Grammy nomination\n\nhttp://www.lukasgraham.com\n\nFifth Harmony\n\nGroup of 5 girls that came together in 2012 from the show X Factor\n\nOne of them, Camila Cabello, announced the day after Jingle Ball that she is leaving the group\n\nHave won 3 VMAs and 7 Teen Choice Awards\n\nhttps://fifthharmony.com/727/\n\nMartin Garrix\n\n20 years old, from Amsterdam\n\nVoted #1 DJ in the world, youngest ever to receive the award\n\nFounded his own record label in 2016\n\nReleased his first ever song, Animals, at the age of 15\n\nInterview:\n\nOn being ranked #1; “Its weird, it’s a dream come true.
