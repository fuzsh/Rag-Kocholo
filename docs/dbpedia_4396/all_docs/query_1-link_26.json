        "text": "Lakeland's 97 Country remains the most popular radio station in Polk County, and two smaller local stations, WONN and WSIR, have tweaked their formats in bids for more listeners.\n\nRecently released radio ratings from Arbitron's fall 2003 survey show that with a 13 percent share of the listening audience, WPCV-FM, 97 Country, continues its reign as the county's highest-rated station.\n\nTampa's WFLZ, 93.3 FM, drew an 8.1 share with its pop/hits format to remain in second place for the fourth year in a row.\n\nTwo other Tampa stations, WDUV-FM and WSJT-FM, drew a 4.3 share each to tie for third place with formats of easy listening and smooth jazz, respectively.\n\nWith a 2.6 share, WWRZ-FM, The Rose, ties for ninth place and is Polk's only other station to rank in the Top 10. Like 97 Country and AM stations WLKF and WONN, The Rose is owned by Lakeland's Hall Communications.\n\nThe shares reflect the percentage of listeners 12 years and older who tuned into a given station between 6 a.m. and midnight, Monday through Sunday during a specific week.\n\nThey were compiled through diaries in which listeners logged the stations they listened to and at what times. The survey is conducted in the fall, but results are released in the following calendar year.\n\nWPVC's 13 share, which keeps it the only station in Polk drawing double-digit numbers, is a sign of 97 Country's 20-plus years of dominating the market, despite a drop from last year's 16.6, says Art Rowbotham, president of Hall Communications. The 16.6 marked the station's second-highest rating in seven years, while the current 13 is more consistent with typical numbers drawn by the station, Rowbotham says.\n\n\"One (ratings period) is a snapshot. And at any given point, you might get a different snapshot depending on where the diaries go in the county for the sample to be taken,\" he says.\n\nWhile 97 Country's high numbers keep the station in first place, a change in the much smaller figures drawn by smaller stations in Polk can make a crucial difference in any given year.\n\nLast year's 0.8 rating by WONN, 1230 AM, marked a decline from the previous year's 3.3 -- when it was No. 6 in the ratings -- and resulted in a tweaking of the station's format.\n\nIn earlier years, the Hall station had built an audience with a standards format that featured Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra and Barbara Streisand among others.\n\nIn recent years, however, WONN added songs from the 1980s and 1990s and saw its numbers decline. \"They brought it a little more contemporary than what the listeners wanted,\" Rowbotham says.\n\nA format change last year returned the station to its core playlist and resulted in this year's ratings increase to 1.2.\n\n\"This is more like WONN used to be before we changed and got more contemporary,\" Rowbotham says.\n\nAfter drawing a 2.4 share last year, the Winter Haven black-gospel station WSIR, 1490 AM, dropped this year to a 1.2 share.\n\nAs a result, the station recently tweaked its all-gospel format to add 12 hours of contemporary R&B at 5:30 p.m. daily to boost istenership. WSIR retains its gospel format from 5 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily.\n\n\"What we're doing with it is probably the only thing left to do with an AM radio station,\" says Joe Fisher, WSIR vice president and general manager.\n\n\"We certainly cannot compete with Hall in the area of news and talk.\"\n\nBill Dean can be reached at bill.dean@theledger.com or 863-802-7527."
