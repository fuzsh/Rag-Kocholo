It is owned by iHeartMedia and airs a sports radio format. WDAE is one of the oldest radio stations in Florida still broadcasting today, going on the air in 1922. The studios and offices are on West Gandy Boulevard in South Tampa. The transmitter is located near the Gandy Bridge in St. Petersburg. WDAE is licensed to broadcast with 5,600 watts by day and 5,500 watts at night. AM 620 is a regional broadcast frequency; because AM 620 is subject to interference from high-powered Cuban stations, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has given WDAE special temporary authority (STA) for higher power: 11,280 watts daytime and 11,000 watts nighttime. It uses a directional antenna at night. WDAE broadcasts using the iBiquity HD radio system during daytime hours. Programming is also heard on FM translator W237CW at 95.3 MHz and on the third digital subchannel of co-owned WBTP (95.7 FM). Three local shows are heard on weekdays on WDAE: Ronnie Lane and Tom Krasniqi â€“ \"The Ronnie and Tkras Show\" in late mornings, Pat Donovan and Aaron Jacobson with \"The Pat and Aaron Show\" in early afternoons, and Ron Diaz and Ian Beckles with \"The Ron and Ian Show\" during late afternoons. In mornings, nights and weekends, WDAE airs syndicated programming from ESPN Radio. Some programming from Fox Sports Radio is also heard on the station.
