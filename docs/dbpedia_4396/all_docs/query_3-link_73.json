        "text": "This is the continuation of the \"cyber list,\" so to speak -- the Web addresses for FM radio stations in our vicinity.\n\nAs well, these won't be added permanently to the weekly station listing guide in the back of the Sunday Click TV guide, so Radio Babe strongly suggests clipping and saving this content.\n\nJust don't blame her when stations change the Web site addresses and the links stop working. Happens all the time. Hopefully R.B. can keep you updated.\n\nRemember that almost all contain the station's contact information, although you may have to look carefully for it, to lodge compliments, complaints, and direct those programming suggestions and questions.\n\nWJIS 88.1 FM, Sarasota, contemporary Christian, rebroadcasts on WJYO 91.5 FM, Fort Myers, www.thejoyfm.com\n\nWMNF 88.5 FM, Tampa, community radio, NPR, www.wmnf.org\n\nWAYJ 88.7 FM, Fort Myers, Christian, http://wayfm.com\n\nWSMR 89.1 FM, Sarasota, religious, www.lifefm891.org\n\nWSRX 89.5 FM, Naples, contemporary Christian, www.praisefm.com\n\nWUSF 89.7 FM, Tampa, classical, jazz, NPR, www.wusf.usf.edu\n\nWGCU 90.1 FM, Fort Myers, simulcasts on WMKO 91.7 FM, Marco, classical, jazz, NPR, www.wgcu.org\n\nWBVM 90.5 FM, Tampa, and WLMS 88.3 FM, Lecanto, Christian, www.spiritfm905.com\n\nWSOR 90.9 FM, Naples, religious, http://wsor.mbn.org/\n\nWKES 91.1 FM, Lakeland/Tampa, religious, rebroadcasts on WKZM 104.3 FM, Sarasota/Bradenton, and WSOR 90.9 FM, http://wkes.mbn.org/\n\nWVIJ 91.5 FM, Port Charlotte, contemporary Christian, www.wvij.com/wvij2.htm\n\nWFTI 91.7 FM, St. Pete, religious, www.familyradio.com\n\nWDDV 92.1 FM, Sarasota, soft adult contemporary, www.doveradio.com\n\nWAFZ 92.1 FM, Immokalee, Spanish tropical, www.radiofiesta.com\n\nWYUU 92.5 FM, Safety Harbor, country, www.5country.com\n\nWRQC 92.5 FM, Estero, rock, www.realrock925.com/\n\nWIKX 92.9 FM, Charlotte Harbor, country, www.wikx.com\n\nWFLZ 93.3 FM, Tampa, top 40, www.933flz.com/main.html\n\nWTLT 93.7 FM, Naples, soft adult contemporary, www.lite937.com\n\nWSJT 94.1 FM, Lakeland, smooth jazz, www.wsjt.com\n\nWARO 94.5 FM, Naples, classic rock, www.arrow945.com\n\nWWRM 94.9 FM, Tampa, adult contemporary, www.warm949.com\n\nWOLZ 95.3 FM, Fort Myers, oldies, www.wolz.com WSSR 95.7 FM, Tampa, urban, www.957thebeat.com\n\nWRXK 96.1 FM, Bonita Springs, classic rock, www.96krock.com\n\nWTMP 96.1 FM, Dade City, R&B/urban, www.hot961.com\n\nWYFO 96.5 FM, Bradenton, and WYFO 97.3 FM, Sarasota, religious, simulcasts Lakeland's WYFO 91.9 FM, www.bbnradio.org/bbn/stations_and_ways_to_hear/station_pages/wyfo/station_info_ wyfo.htm\n\nWINK 96.9 FM, Fort Myers, Hot adult contemporary, www.winkfm.com/Default_ page.htm\n\nWSUN 97.1 FM, holiday, modern rock, www.97xonline.com\n\nWTLQ 97.7 FM, Punta Rassa, Spanish tropical, www.latinotropical.com\n\nWXTB 97.9 FM, Clearwater, rock, www.98rock.com\n\nWLLD 98.7 FM, Holmes Beach, R&B dance, www.wild987.fm\n\nWJBX 99.3 FM, Fort Myers, modern rock, www.99xwjbx.com\n\nWAFC 99.5 FM, Fort Myers, country, www.wafcfm.com\n\nWQYK 99.5 FM, Tampa, country, www.wqyk.com\n\nWCKT 100.1 FM, Fort Myers, country, www.wckt.com\n\nWMTX 100.7 FM, Tampa, hot adult contemporary, www.wmtx.com\n\nWAVV 101.1 FM, Marco, easy listening, www.wavv101.com\n\nWPOI 101.5 FM, St. Pete., '80s oldies, http://1015thepoint.com/\n\nWWGR 101.9 FM, Fort Myers, country, www.gatorcountry1019.com\n\nWHPT 102.5 FM, Sarasota, classic rock, http://1025online.com/\n\nWJGO 102.9 FM, Tice, rhythmic oldies, www.wjgo1029.com\n\nWTBT 103.5 FM, Bradenton, classic rock, www.thunder1035.com/main.html\n\nWXKB 103.9 FM, Cape Coral, top 40, www.b1039.com\n\nWKZM 104.3 FM, Sarasota, religious, www.mbn.org/default.asp?SectionID= 22B6A3833F5046D5AFD84FD2F26089BB\n\nWRBQ 104.7 FM, Tampa, oldies, www.oldies1047.com/home.html\n\nWSGL 104.7 FM, Naples, hot adult contemporary, www.WSGL1047.com\n\nWCVU 104.9 FM, Solana easy listening, www.wcvu.com\n\nWDUV 105.5 FM, New Port Richey, soft adult contemporary, http://wduv.com/\n\nWBTT 105.5 FM, Naples Park, dance top 40, www.1055thebeat.com\n\nWTZB 105.9 FM, Sarasota, modern rock, www.1059thebuzz.com\n\nWJPT 106.3 FM, Fort Myers Villas, standards, www.wjpt.com\n\nWCTQ 106.5 FM, Sarasota, country, www.wctq.com\n\nWDRR 107.1 FM, Fort Myers, Smooth jazz, www.wdrr.com\n\nWBBY 107.3 FM, St. Pete, rock adult contemporary, http://1073online.com/\n\nWSRZ 107.9 FM, Sarasota, oldies, www.wsrz.com\n\nThere you have the most recent cyber-offerings for our tri-area friendly radio atmosphere.
