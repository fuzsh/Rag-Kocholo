He added: “He spent two hours on his show pretty much trying to destroy what I’ve done in radio, what I’ve done with ‘The Opie and Anthony Show’, kind of destroy me as a person,\" Opie shared with his new co-host, Jim Norton. He reiterated that he had nothing to do with Cumia’s firing, but complained that he won’t leave him alone and stop taking shots at him. “I knew for many, many years that Anthony disliked me immensely,” Hughes added. “I knew for many, many years that he was manipulating people behind the scenes to dislike me immensely. I tried to talk to Anthony about our issues, I tried.” Hughes revealed that he and Cumia were “best friends from 1994-1999. ...“But what Ant did last night… was just completely and utterly uncalled for, period.” And just to be clear about his feelings towards Cumia: “Don’t like you! I’m not going to sit here and make believe I do — I don’t like you. And it’s a shame because I know what we used to have, but I just wish, you know, you could just f***ing move on,” Hughes said.

According to AP, Freberg provided the voices for numerous cartoon characters for such films as Lady and the Tramp, Alice in Wonderland and Stuart Little. He did them for popular TV programs as well, including The Bugs Bunny Show, Ren & Stimpy and Freakazoid. He also appeared in front of the camera, including a recurring role on the 90's sitcom Roseanne. But his greatest impact perhaps came through comedy records and syndicated radio shows. Among his many awards included two dozen CLIO awards and being named to the Radio Hall of Fame. According to the New York Times, his radio sketches for CBS in 1957 included some of the earliest put-downs of political correctness (before that idea had a name). One sketch entailed a confrontation with a fictional network censor, Mr. Tweedlie, who insisted that Mr. Freberg change the lyrics of “Ol’ Man River,” starting with the title. He wanted it renamed “Elderly Man River.” In addition to his son, Donavan, he is survived by his wife, Hunter Freberg; his daughter, Donna Jean Freberg; and one granddaughter.\n\nAdam Levine Hug-Attacked On Stage; Taylor Swift Tops Billboard's Music Award Finalists\n\nBrian Williams Thinks 'Maybe I Had A Brain Tumor' Before Making Up Stuff - [THE WRAP]\n\nTaylor Swift Top Billboard's Music Awards Finalist's List - [BILLBOARD]\n\nMick Jagger Makes Big Announcement - [ROLLING STONE]\n\n[WATCH] Adam Levine Hug-Attacked On Stage By Fan - [USA TODAY]\n\n[SEE] Pics Of Christina Aguilera In 'Nashville' - [TV LINE]\n\nStar Trek's George Takei Launches 'It Takeis Two' - [VARIETY]\n\nLook, Emilia Clarke Is In 'Vogue' - [E ONLINE]\n\nZach Braff And Donald Faison Offer To Make Pizza For Gay Weddings - [PAGE SIX]\n\n'Dukes of Hazzard's' James Best Passes Away - [CNN]\n\n[WATCH] No One Notices As Grateful Dead Drummer Joins Street Musician - [HUFFPO]\n\nSHARE JOCKLINE DAILY WITH A FRIEND, CLICK HERE\n\nGLOVES OFF: Things Get Personal Between Opie And Anthony\n\nIt Was Clear (To Cumia) That His Splintered Friendship With Opie Had Been 'Years In the Making'\n\nTHE MOUTH, APRIL 7TH, 2015 –– To some, this latest tiff between Anthony Cumia and longtime former partner Greg Opie Hughes may have stunt written all over it, but the words seem to tell a different story.

I think we owe it to the people that made us successful to not go behind some closed door because we have a fear, of what, airing our dirty laundry? We’ve done it for years,” Cumia added. Later on Twitter, Opie responded: 'You are still human garbage. Might want to look into what really is eating you. I'm not the problem.' Cumia fired back: 'Ha, okay that's a good one.'

Christopher Sparkman was gravely injured last year when a suicidal gunman opened fire at the Fed Ex store where Sparkman had been working as a security guard. Since then, he has had over 30 surgeries and he and his wife, Jamie Lynn, are facing huge medical bills. To help the family with these medical expenses, KICKS 101.5 partnered with Atlanta area T. Mac restaurants on Thursday, April 2, and raised over $6,500 for the Sparkman family, with restaurants still reporting numbers from the drive. From 11am to 7pm, KICKS 101.5 was on hand at T. Mac’s Kennesaw location, broadcasting and meeting with listeners. During that time, all Atlanta area T. Macs participated in \"A Day For Christopher\". Each location had a drop box placed at the front for patrons to drop their receipts. 10% of all receipts collected will go to the Sparkman’s. In a note to station staff Friday, Greg Frey, Program Director - WKHX, KICKS 101.5 Atlanta, said: \"Thanks to Cadillac Jack and Tug who spent a good chunk of their day onsite and on the air. Also, kudos to Jenn Fallin, Matt Jones, Liz Weber and Doug Sargent for making this whole thing possible.\n\nChevrolet Teams With Cumulus To Cook Up Best Day Ever\n\nTHE MOUTH, APRIL 7TH, 2015 –– Thanks to an innovative program with Chevrolet, Cumulus helped make April 1, 2015 the \"Best Day Ever\" for scores of delighted people in New York, Nashville, Kansas City, Chicago and Minneapolis.
