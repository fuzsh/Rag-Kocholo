        "text": "Behind the apparent success of two of Tampa Bay's top radio stations, \"Power Pig\" WFLZ and talk radio WFLA, lies a parent company with more than its share of financial woes.\n\nJacor Communications Inc. on Wednesday said it lost $2.3-million, or 23 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 1991. The company, based in Cincinnati, also said it is in default with its lenders, including non-payment of more than $7-million to First National Bank of Chicago.\n\nJacor, which said it is trying to restructure its debts, owns 11 radio stations, a cable television system and the Georgia Network, a radio network serving more than 140 stations in that state. The company's stations are located in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver, Jacksonville, Knoxville, Tenn. and Tampa.\n\nWhat impact Jacor's problems may have on its Tampa stations is not clear. Earlier this year, there was some speculation that WFLZ and WFLA would be sold, but that was immediately denied by the stations' local managers.\n\nChristopher Weber, spokesman for Jacor in Cincinnati, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\n\nBoth WFLZ (93.3-FM) and WFLA (970-AM) are regularly among the top 10 rated stations in Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Ohio company also said Wednesday that it has decided to suspend the monthly interest payments on its senior debt, commencing with the payment due last Monday, and on other subordinated debt until it can complete a restructuring.\n\nFor all of 1991, Jacor reported a profit of $1.5-million, but only after it sold two radio stations for $13-million. In 1990, the company lost $20.7-million.\n\nJacor indicated that the radio industry as a whole is having some difficulties. It cited a report that said radio revenue nationwide declined 2.8 percent from 1990 to 1991 _ the first annual decrease in radio revenue in the last 30 years."
