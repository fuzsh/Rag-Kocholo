        "text": "Local radio station 97 Country is still the most listened-to radio station in Polk County, while Orlando Spanish-language radio station WRUM-FM made its first appearance in the Top 10.\n\nRadio ratings released recently from Arbitron's fall 2006 survey show WPCV-FM obtained a 14.5 percent share of the listening audience, making 97 Country the county's most popular radio station.\n\nNot only is 97 Country the only radio station showcasing double digit numbers in listener ratings, but it also obtained a 2 percent share growth since last year.\n\n\"The audience in Central Florida strongly likes country music,\" said Art Rowbotham, president of Hall Communications and owner of the highest-rated WPCV. \"It's the predominant choice of music here, so it's no surprise that it continues to be No. 1.\"\n\nTampa's pop hits-infused radio station WFLZ 93.3 kept its No. 2 spot for the sixth year in a row with a 6.3 percent share in listener ratings, but had a 0.6 percent decline from its 6.9 percent share last year.\n\nAdult contemporary station WWRM out of Tampa came in at third place this year with a 4.9 share, making that a 0.8 share rise from last year's numbers when the station also came in at the third place position.\n\nLakeland smooth-jazz radio station WSJT made it back to the Top 10 this year after being absent in last year's ratings, gaining a 4.2 percent share of listeners, kicking off last year's No. 4 spot contender, Tampa's urban-format station WBTP-FM.\n\nWhile the fourth position changed this year, Cocoa Beach talk/personality radio station WTKS-FM held on tight to its fifth place spot with a 3.8 percent share of listeners, a 0.1 percent decline from last year's numbers.\n\nThe shares in the Arbitron study reflect the percentage of listeners 12 and older who listen to a specific station between 6 a.m. and midnight Monday through Sunday during a given week.\n\nThe numbers are compiled through diaries in which listeners logged the stations they were listening to at the time and the times they were found tuning in to each station. Although the radio survey is conducted during the fall, the results are released the next calendar year.\n\nRowbotham of WPCV said the 14.5 percent share this year is extremely positive for the station, which had its highest numbers in three years.\n\nThe station obtained a 13.6 share in Arbitron's fall 2004 listener numbers, before dropping to a 12.5 share in the fall 2005 survey which was released last year.\n\n\"97 Country has a mass appeal,\" he said.\n\nLake Wales regional Mexican-style music radio station WIPC-AM, which cracked the top 10 last year in the eighth spot, was a no-show this year in the top ratings scale.\n\nAll of the top-rated stations this year are FM. Yet, it's unfair to grade AM radio stations by listener ratings, said Rowbotham.\n\n\"They serve their local communities,\" he said. \"Our listeners are continually interested in these stations.\"\n\nWIPC-AM still counts about 11,700 loyal listeners who tune in to its Norteño, Tex-Mex and Tejano sounds.\n\nProving that Spanish-language radio is still on the rise, Orlando station WRUM cracked the Top 10 at the No. 8 position.\n\nThe station offers a variety of Latin music.\n\n\"Hispanic radio in Central Florida is continuing to grow, because I think the audience is growing,\" he said. \"This is something that has developed in recent years, and the growth is gradual.\"\n\nRowbotham said he expects to see a significant growth in \"localism,\" with radio stations serving their local communities like 97 Country aims to.\n\n\"More and more of the stations are going to be locally managed,\" he said. \"Big companies have found it's not economical to take care of smaller markets. To manage a public market in a small community, you need to have local people.\"\n\nIf a huge company takes care of a smaller market, Rowbotham said, it is at a disadvantage of knowing what the small community wants.\n\nHe also added that with the impending rise of high-definition radio in the next couple of years, listeners will have a bigger choice of stations to listen to. Different frequencies and broadcasts will be available in a digital format.\n\nAurora Rodriguez can be reached at aurora.rodriguez@theledger.com or at 863-802-7539.
