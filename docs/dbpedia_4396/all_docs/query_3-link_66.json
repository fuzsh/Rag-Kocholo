As detailed on THIS site, following one of most creative and outrageous strategies in radio history (involving potentially millions of dollars in ransom), Oldies-formatted WFLZ 93.3 “Z93” flipped to Rhythmic CHR as “Power 93, The Power Pig”. Longtime, full service heritage CHR WRBQ (Q105) lost significant portions of its audience. Following numerous attempts to stop the bleeding, it switched to a Country format within four years.\n\nThis aircheck represents a montage of The Power Pig about 2 years after its debut."
