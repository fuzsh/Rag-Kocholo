        "text": "Syracuse DJs are sharing their memories of “Kane,” a Syracuse University alumnus and former HOT 107.9 (WWHT-FM) radio host who died this past week.\n\n“He was a special guy to all of us,” said Skip Clark, who worked at Y94FM (WYYY-FM) while Kane was hosting late nights next door at HOT 107.9 in the same building in 1998. “He had an exceptional talent.”\n\nKane, whose real name was Peter Deibler, died Friday, March 6, of acute respiratory distress syndrome at the Shady Grove Adventist Medical Center in Maryland, according to The Washington Post. He was 43.\n\n“When I saw the news, my heart just fell,” Clark said. “It was hard.”\n\nMarty, who co-hosts “The Morning Mess” on 95X with Shannon, wrote on Facebook: “I am in absolute shock. I worked with Kane as we started Hot 107.9 in 1997 in Syracuse. My heart hurts for his family and daughters. Rest easy Kane... Thanks for all the memories.”\n\n“We all have our work people that we become friends.. or in this case we were almost a family,” another former HOT 107.9 staffer, Brian Chase, added on Facebook. “We had fun... and I mean a TON of fun, more laughs than you can imagine, some drama and the best club nights EVER. We were all inseparable. This is the first tragedy to hit our airstaff... and it hurts. It is just hard to fathom and comprehend that he is gone. Your HOT 1079 family will NEVER forget you.”\n\nDeibler began his on-air career on SU’s student-run radio station Z89 (WJPZ-FM), and was one of the first DJs on HOT 107.9 when it launched in the late ‘90s. He was actually still a student when he was hired at the Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia)-owned radio station, and would walk more than 2 miles to and from his dorm for the job.\n\nDeibler was also known as “Sean Kelly” on 98Q (WDAQ) in his hometown of Danbury, Connecticut, but was soon destined for bigger markets as “Kane.”\n\nClark, now a program director and afternoon on-air personality at Syracuse country radio station 92.1 The Wolf (WOLF-FM), said he encouraged Kane to send in an aircheck tape to 93.3 FLZ (WFLZ-FM) in Tampa, Florida.\n\n“I can remember it was like yesterday,” Clark said. “He knew he was good at what he did but he didn’t have the confidence... He needed a push. He was young and needed to explore.”\n\nClark also surprised him at the Syracuse airport the day he left to audition for WFLZ.\n\n“I will never, ever, ever forget that,” Kane said in a Facebook video in 2017. “I remember going down there, and I was nervous as all get-out because it was a big station, 93.3 FLZ, and you were there, man... It meant a lot, and it still does.”\n\nIn the same video, Kane also shared fond memories of working in Bridgewater Place at 500 Plum Street, where Y94FM and HOT 107.9′s studios are still located, along with B104.7, Power 620 AM and NewsRadio 570 WSYR. Kane said sometimes it would rain so hard, that the water would rise in the creek outside the building that he would see mannequins and deer floating.\n\n“And the basement would flood, and it would stink,” added Clark, who also hosts the “SkiP HappEns” podcast. “Those memories kind of make you laugh.”\n\nKane hosted the Sunday night program, “Open House Party,” on WFLZ, and then worked as program director for XM Satellite Radio’s KissXM, 20 On 20, and 90s On 9 in 2000. He eventually became nationally known as the host of “The Kane Show” at HOT 99.5 (WIHT) and the Sunday night program “Club Kane,” heard on 100 iHeartRadio stations nationally from from 2006 to 2020.\n\nKane was known for on-air segments like the Rick Dees-inspired “War of the Roses” and stunts like convincing WIHT to bail Bobby Brown out of jail in 2007, paying $19,150 for the R&B singer’s overdue child support in exchange for Brown appearing on his show for a week. Brown only ended up doing 10 minutes on-air, but it made headlines worldwide.\n\nBut Kane never forgot Syracuse.\n\n“There are cities that — Tampa’s one of them, Cincinnati’s one of them, Syracuse is one of them, DC’s one of them, Baltimore, Louisville — there are places with very special spots in my heart, and Syracuse is one of them,” Kane said in 2017. “From doing a college radio station at Syracuse University, to my hometown of Danbury, you learn how much you love something when you’re willing to walk at night, when I lived on campus — two-and-a-half miles I walked at midnight — home after doing a radio show. And it was so cold in Syracuse that, sorry to get gross, my boogers would freeze.”\n\n“It was an incredible experience. And you meet great people. And our radio family, then and now, is just awesome.”\n\n“The Kane Show” abruptly ended in April 2020 after 14 years on the air. iHeart DC Regional Senior VP of Programming Jeff Kapugi said at the time that Deibler would no longer appear on air, but would “still be a part of the iHeart family.” No other details were given.\n\nDeibler’s survivors include two children.\n\n“Kane routinely discussed being a father to his two daughters, Sam and Sophie, endearing him to his many listeners,” his reps said in a statement. “Although co-hosts came and went, Kane remained a constant, comforting voice for thousands of people driving to work, dropping the kids off at school and running errands.”\n\nThe family is requesting that their privacy be respected during this difficult time.\n\nSee Kane talk about Syracuse and Skip Clark from the 26:58 mark to about 40:00:\n\nSee more photos and tributes to Kane:\n\nJeff Wise, who previously worked on-air at HOT 107.9 as Danger Boy, shared an audio clip of Kane from 1998:"
