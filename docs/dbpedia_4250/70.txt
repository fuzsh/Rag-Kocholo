Ekaterina Svanidze (1880 - 1907) was the Georgian first wife of Joseph Stalin; they married in 1903.

Ekaterina Svanidze, nicknamed Kato, was a Georgian girl, sister of Alexander Svanidze, a graduate of Tiflis who joined Stalin as a Bolshevik. She married Joseph Stalin in 1903, and gave him a son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, who joined the Red Army but was captured by the Nazis and committed suicide by running into an electric fence.

On November 25, 1907, Ekaterina died of turberculosis "in Stalin's arms." Stalin said, "This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her died my last warm feelings for people."
