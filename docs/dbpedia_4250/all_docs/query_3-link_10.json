        "text": "Article content\n\nRuthless Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin brutalized his country from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. He murdered opponents, sent millions to prison, and enacted policies that led to famine in Ukraine, killing millions more.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nResisting family resemblance Back to video\n\nHis atrocities are well documented, but the story of his three children is less known. Not surprisingly, they were traumatized by Stalin’s ego and cruelty.\n\nIn 1906, the future dictator married Ekaterina Svanidze when he was 28. They had a child, Yakov, but Ekaterina died of typhus before the baby had his first birthday. At her funeral, Stalin was so distraught, he jumped into his wife’s grave, setting off a struggle to get him out.\n\nBut such devotion was never shown to his son. Stalin considered Yakov weak, ignored him, and sent him to be raised by his mother’s relatives. When a woman broke the young man’s heart, he tried unsuccessfully to kill himself with a gun.\n\nStalin said dismissively, “He couldn’t even do that right.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd when the Nazis invaded Russia in 1941, Stalin insisted his son enlist and had him sent to the front lines. Less than a month later, Yakov was captured, further infuriating his father. “There are no prisoners of war,” he said, “just traitors.”\n\nSo relatives of captured soldiers were often imprisoned, including Yakov’s wife, Yulia.\n\nWhen the Soviets captured Hitler’s nephew, the German leader proposed an exchange. But Stalin refused, saying it made no sense to trade his son, a lieutenant, for a high-ranking Nazi field-marshal.\n\nAs for Yakov, he refused to co-operate with Nazi propaganda. He died in a concentration camp at 36. The Germans said he was killed trying to escape, but an inquiry in 2000 ruled he deliberately electrocuted himself on the prison’s fence.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStalin’s second son, Vasily, was born to his second wife, Nadezhda. But when Vasily was 11, she shot herself through the heart after an argument with Stalin. The true cause of death was hidden from the boy.\n\nBut Vasily grew up to be pompous and entitled, with a taste for alcohol and women. His father made him, too, join the army, but the young man was kept away from the front, unlike his brother.\n\nVasily was a competent aviator, but was promoted because of his father, reaching the rank of general at 24. Stalin largely ignored him, and so did many of his colleagues, when the dictator died.\n\nVasily’s conduct became increasingly erratic and Soviet officials imprisoned him for years. After his release in 1960, Vasily became an alcoholic and died two years later, just shy of his 41st birthday.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nUnlike the two sons, Stalin’s daughter Svetlana, was his pride and joy. Vasily’s younger sister by the same mother, Svetlana was controlled by the dictator, even more so than Soviet citizens.\n\nStalin sent one of her suitors to prison for five years because he didn’t like the man; he disapproved of her first marriage; and arranged for her to marry the son of a political ally.\n\nWhen Stalin died, Svetlana tellingly took her mother’s maiden name, defected to the United States leaving two children behind, and lived a quiet life until her death in Wisconsin at 85, in 2011.\n\nThough nobody is doomed to repeat the mistakes or character of a dysfunctional father or mother, and nobody should choose to remain a victim for life, some of us face greater challenges when it comes to overcoming the negative influence of parents.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen we look at what some people have been through, it should be much easier for us to cut them some slack, show patience, and demonstrate empowering love.\n\nWhen you don’t grow up with a father or mother’s love, the parental picture of God can be a powerful and poignant one, once it takes root in the heart — which is often a difficult process.\n\nIn Him, we have a Father who loves us passionately and completely, regardless of our conduct. Even when we hurt him, He never abandons us, or writes us off. Instead, He makes available tremendous power for change and renewal.\n\nWe see God’s love for us, in Jesus. Though He sent his Son to the front lines in the fight against sin and death, his motive was love — for us. “God loved the world so much, He gave his only Son so everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life,” John writes.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“God sent his Son, not to judge the world, but to save it through Him.” (John 3:16, 17) It was a prisoner exchange for those in captivity to sin. His Son, for us.\n\nDoes it mean God doesn’t love us when bad things happen to us? Paul answers with a resounding no, in Romans 8 where he says absolutely nothing can separate us from God’s love.\n\nBut we have to ensure we don’t develop a pompous attitude of entitlement, thinking a relationship with him should give us special privilege and a pass from the hardships of life. We’re called to nobility, not spiritual nepotism.\n\nAnd though our Father has ultimate power, He never uses it to control our lives, no matter how much He dotes on us. He leaves us free to make our own choices and, yes, to sometimes suffer the consequences of those choices.\n\nBut when we embrace his love and standards, He gives us what we need to live as we should. Sadly, when some defect from the church, it’s because of an unscriptural ecclesiastical control Jesus never intended.\n\nGod went into the grave, not to mourn us, but to save us. Our response should be love, gratitude, and service to others. We can be proud to let people know Who our Dad is.\n\nShare your thoughts with Rick at info@followers.ca A former TV reporter and journalism prof, he pastors an independent, nondenominational church in Brantford, ON called Followers of Christ (www.followers)\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Brantford"
