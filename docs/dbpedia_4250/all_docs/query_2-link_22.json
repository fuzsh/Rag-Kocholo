        "text": "The 1932 suicide of Stalin's wife has been made public for what is believed to be the first time in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn an interview in the newspaper Moskovski Komsomolyets, a playwright, Mikhail Shatrov, implied that Stalin drove his wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, to kill herself.\n\nShe committed suicide as famine swept the Soviet Union during Stalin's forced collectivization of agriculture.\n\n''His relations toward women? I know little about this question,'' Mr. Shatrov said in the interview. ''We know about the suicide of his wife. In any case, Stalin was always crude.''\n\nNadezhda Alliluyeva was Stalin's second wife. His first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, died before the 1917 revolution and he remarried in 1918.\n\nWestern historians have written about the suicide, but Mr. Shatrov's mention of it is believed to be the first in an unrestricted Soviet publication. Mr. Shatrov is a leading proponent of the Kremlin's drive for greater openness in Soviet society. His recently published plays on Soviet history have drawn great attention in the Soviet Union.\n\nA Western biographer of Stalin, Isaac Deutscher, says Nadezhda Alliluyeva killed herself in November 1932 after she spoke her mind about Communist Party purges and the famine and was met by a flood of vulgar abuse from Stalin."
