        "text": "21 December marks the 135 anniversary of the birth of one of the most significant politicians in all stories Russian state - Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. According to the official version, it was 21 December that 1879 was born in the city of Gori and the future head of the Soviet state was born. Although there is another version: the birth of Joseph Dzhugashvili on white light happened December 18 1878 year.\n\nA great number of books, articles have been written about Stalin, and a lot of films have been shot. To a lesser extent, covered the activities of his descendants. And if they still talk about Stalin's children — Svetlana, Yakov, and Vasily — then the grandchildren are already little known. Meanwhile, among them there are very worthy and respected people. What is worth one Evgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili, which will be discussed in this article - military engineer and military historian, politician, candidate of military and candidate of historical sciences, retired colonel of the Soviet Army and even a little film actor (played the role of his own grandfather in the film “ Jacob is the son of Stalin (released on screens in 1990).\n\nChildhood and Suvorov School\n\nEvgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili is the son of Yakov Dzhugashvili and Olga Pavlovna Golysheva. Recall that Yakov is the eldest son of Stalin, from his first marriage with Ekaterina Svanidze, who was born in 1907 and subsequently died at the front. Yevgeny Yakovlevich was born on January 10, 1936 in Uryupinsk, Stalingrad Territory (this region included the territories of the current Volgograd Region and Kalmykia) with 27-year-old Olga Golysheva. Olga Golysheva met Yakov Dzhugashvili in 1934, when she came from her native Uryupinsk to Moscow - to study at aviation technical College.\n\nHowever, relations did not work out subsequently, and Olga left Moscow back to her homeland, to Uryupinsk. Her son was born there. By the way, in the meantime, Jacob Dzhugashvili married Julia Meltzer, their daughter was born, and for the first two years Olga Golysheva did not show him a son - she was afraid that he would be taken away. But then Yakov himself found his former beloved and arranged for his son to issue documents on the last name “Dzhugashvili” (for the first two years he bore the last name “Golyshev”). That is, Jacob never refused his son, although he already lived in another family. Before the war, Jacob graduated from the artillery academy of the Red Army and, with the start of hostilities, was sent to the active army.\n\nIt is a well-known story how Stalin refused to use his position and possible levers in order to free his eldest son from Hitler's captivity. Yakov died in captivity and was shot dead while trying to escape. By the way, both Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili and his son Yakov, Stalin's great-grandson, are convinced that Joseph Vissarionovich acted absolutely right about their father and grandfather — the head of the Soviet state could not do otherwise, to show that his child enjoys some privileges, while the children of ordinary Soviet citizens perish at the front. Therefore, the grandson and great-grandson of Stalin repeatedly told the media that they understand the motives of such an act of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.\n\nBefore the war, Olga Golysheva studied at the aviation technical school, but when the Great Patriotic War began, she, like Eugenia Yakov’s father, went to the front. She served as a nurse, was injured several times. Passed through the war, meeting the victory in Berlin. After the victory she moved with her son to Moscow, respectively Zhenya Dzhugashvili transferred to a Moscow school. Mother worked as a collector in the financial part of the Moscow Air Force Air Force. There is no luxury like the children and grandchildren of modern officials, of course, in this family was not. And the way for Stalin's grandson was one - to learn, acquire a profession and become a specialist, in order to earn a living worthy of his life and to benefit the Soviet people. There is nothing surprising in the fact that the young Yevgeny Dzhugashvili decided to become a soldier. In 1947, Yevgeny Dzhugashvili entered the Kalininsky Suvorov Military School.\n\nBy this time, the Suvorov School in Kalinin (now Tver) existed for four years - it was created in 1943 among the nine Suvorov schools opened in the Soviet Union for children of front-line soldiers who died during the war. As the son of Jacob, who was killed at the front, Yevgeny had thus the full right to enter the school. By the way, Alexander Burdonsky, the son of Vasily Stalin and a cousin of Eugene, who was younger than the hero of our article on 5 years, also studied in the same school - he was born in 1941 year.\n\nIn addition to the grandchildren of Stalin, the school was attended by children and grandchildren of other significant people of that era — Budenny, Gastello, Khrushchev and others. Eugene, by the way, personally and unfamiliar with the great grandfather, had no privileges to study because of his background.\n\nIt is worth - the grandson of Stalin Alexander Stalin (Burdonsky), son of Vasily. Sits - Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili.\n\nWhen Eugene wrote a letter to his grandfather, two generals came to the school, who spoke to the boy and told him to strive to be the best in everything. On this, the intervention of the omnipotent grandfather in the upbringing of his grandson ended. Only in 1953, when Joseph Vissarionovich died, to Evgeny, the Council of Ministers of the USSR appointed a pension in the amount of 1000 rubles, which was to be paid to him before graduating from a higher educational institution. How striking is this contrast compared with the way of life of children and relatives of representatives of later generations of the Soviet and Russian elites.\n\nEngineer and military historian\n\nIn 1954, after graduating from college, Yevgeny Dzhugashvili entered the Air Force Engineering Academy. NOT. Zhukovsky. This was facilitated by the personal appeal of his mother, Olga Golysheva, to the then Minister of Defense of the USSR Bulganin. Eugene studied at the Faculty of Radio Engineering, which he graduated from in 1959 year, receiving the title of lieutenant engineer. After graduating from the academy, Eugene was identified as a military representative to the designer Sergey Korolev himself. Military representative in the Design Bureau S.P. The queen in the Moscow region Podlipki Dzhugashvili worked 15 for years, occasionally leaving for launches at the Baikonur cosmodrome. Military engineer Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili had a chance to participate in the preparations for the launch of the first Soviet spacecraft, therefore, in the flight of Yuri Gagarin, there is, to a certain extent, his personal merit.\n\nDuring this time, he joined the Communist Party and decided to continue his studies - this time in the humanities specialty. After all, Eugene has always been interested in military history, and with a fundamental training of the Air Force Engineering Academy and having received a humanitarian education, it was possible to become an excellent military historian in the aviation field. As it turned out - the teacher of military history from Yevgeny Yakovlevich also turned out beautiful. Twenty-five years he gave teaching at the military academies of the Armed Forces of the USSR.\n\nAccording to Viktor Nikolaevich Gastello, the son of the famous pilot Nikolai Gastello, who studied three years older than Yevgeny Dzhugashvili at the Suvorov School, and then - and at the Air Force Engineering Academy, his departure from the Space Facilities Management Center (TSUKOS) Aunt Svetlana Alliluyeva abroad. As if Evgenia Dzhugashvili almost immediately after emigration was asked to leave ZUKOS and find a new place of service for themselves (Gastello VN. Former Suvorovets Dzhugashvili prefers to live in Tbilisi // Independent Military Review. 18.05.2007).\n\nYevgeny Yakovlevich entered the adjuncture of the Military-Political Academy. IN AND. Lenin, and in 1973, he defended his thesis on \"US Aviation in the Vietnam War of Aggression.\" After defending his thesis, Yevgeny Yakovlevich was directed by a teacher at the Military Academy of Armored Forces. R.Y. Malinowski. In parallel, he studied at the historical department of the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR. K.E. Voroshilov, which he graduated in 1976 year. In 1976-1986 Evgeny Yakovlevich taught at the Air Force Academy. Yu.A. Gagarin in Monino, in 1986-1987 years. - was a senior lecturer at the Military Academy of the General Staff, and in 1987-1991. - Associate Professor at the Military Academy. Mv Frunze. In the 1991 year, when the Soviet era ended, the service of Yevgeny Yakovlevich in the Armed Forces came to an end. Reaching the age of fifty-five years, Colonel Dzhugashvili began civilian life.\n\nProtecting the name of the ancestor\n\nUpon his retirement, Yevgeny Yakovlevich, despite the fact that he has an apartment in Moscow, preferred to visit Tbilisi more often. Although he spent his childhood in the RSFSR, and he served in the current Russian territory, it is obvious that he has a deep mental connection with Georgia. It is understandable - in the homeland of Stalin, his grandson was highly respected. VN recalls Gastello, a fellow student at the Suvorov School: “Zhenya complained to me that when he came to Gagra, he could not just have a drink with his friends. In the restaurant after the next feast, the wife was not allowed to pay the bill. When he tried to pay, he necessarily ran into one answer: “Already paid!” (Gastello VN. Former Suvorov Dzhugashvili prefers to live in Tbilisi // Independent Military Review. 18.05.2007).\n\nThe civil life of Yevgeny Yakovlevich turned out to be no less intense and worthy in its own way than the military life. After 1991, he began to take an active part in Russian and Georgian politics - as a leader of the communist movement. It should be noted that among the grandchildren of Stalin alone he was not afraid to raise the name of his grandfather and emphasize his commitment to the communist ideals. You can ideologically disagree with the convictions of Yevgeny Dzhugashvili, but you should give him his due - he did not betray the name of his grandfather and continued the struggle in his defense. And the times in relation to the name of Stalin in the nineties were, to put it mildly, not the most favorable. In both Russia and Georgia, the democratic authorities did not welcome the mention of the Soviet leader in a positive tone. Moreover, Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili faced another problem - his sister Galina - the daughter of his aunt Svetlana Alliluyeva - did not recognize him as the grandson of Joseph Vissarionovich. As you know, Svetlana Alliluyeva rather critically assessed the figure and activity of her father, went into exile in the United States of America. One can ponder for a long time about the reasons why it was Yevgeny — the son of Yakov Dzhugashvili and his civil wife Olga Golysheva — Galina did not recognize as a relative. Perhaps the reason lies precisely in the convictions and uncompromisingness of Yevgeny Yakovlevich himself.\n\nHowever, Yevgeny Yakovlevich himself is more convinced that there are more personal reasons for this: “Everyone knew they recognized me. Besides Galina, my sister. She was used ... Her fate is not very happy. Judge for yourself. I have sons, grandchildren. And she? She married Algerian, gave birth to a son, deaf and dumb. An interesting story came out with this pregnancy. I knew that she was pregnant and my Nana was the second child. And I have already decided that I will gather all the male names in the Dzhugashvili family. And now the phone rings. A friend calls me and says that Galya has given birth to a boy. I was upset, no longer listening to what he said to me, and he: \"Selim, Selim.\" I did not understand what it is, I say, is it? And he screams in my phone - Selim, Selim! The name is! Arabic! I was so happy. He ran to his wife and said, well, that's it, now go and give birth to Jacob! If a girl were born, they would call Olga ... but Jacob was born. There is already Vissarion, and my grandson was born, they called Soso, Joseph - now there is Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili ”(Quoted from the Soldier’s Son: an interview with Stalin’s grandson).\n\nDue to the disagreement on the role of the grandfather in national history, Yevgeny Yakovlevich broke up with Alexander Burdonsky, the son of Vasily Stalin and his cousin, which he also spoke about in an interview with Russian media. The work of life for Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili was the restoration of the honor and dignity of his grandfather, trampled in post-Soviet Russia, and in Georgia too. Yevgeny Dzhugashvili became a prominent activist of the communist movement in Russia and Georgia.\n\nIn 1999, he took part in the elections to the State Duma of the Russian Federation - he was in the first three of the electoral list of the Stalin bloc for the USSR - together with the leader of the Labor Russia movement Viktor Anpilov and the leader of the Union of Soviet Officers Stanislav Terekhov. However, the bloc did not pass to the State Duma - it did not get the necessary number of votes. However, Yevgeny Yakovlevich focused his attention on the development of the communist movement in Georgia. In 1996, he headed the Society of Ideological Successors of Joseph Stalin, in 1999, the People’s Patriotic Union of Georgia, and in 2001, the New Communist Party of Georgia.\n\nIn recent years, Yevgeny Yakovlevich has pleaded with various media outlets, individual journalists and public figures, insisting that they discredit the honor and dignity of his grandfather. Among the famous lawsuits, a lawsuit against Novaya Gazeta and journalist A.Yu. Yablokov in 2009, filed because of the publication of the article \"Beria was appointed guilty.\" The article claimed that Stalin ordered the destruction of 20 thousands of Polish prisoners of war. The court denied the lawsuit, justifying it by saying that the author of the article expressed his own personal opinion about the role of Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn the same year, 2009, Yevgeny Yakovlevich sued Echo of Moscow, demanding that the leading M.Yu. Ganapolsky, who claimed that Stalin had signed a decree on the possibility of using the death penalty for children with 12 age. The court for the plaintiff Dzhugashvili also refused. In 2011, a new suit followed against Ekho Moskvy - this time Evgeny Yakovlevich wanted to punish journalist N.K. Svanidze, who declared that \"Stalin choked little children.\" The claim was also denied.\n\nIn addition to lawsuits against the media, Yevgeny Dzhugashvili sued the State Duma of the Russian Federation, demanding that the declaration of the Russian parliament in the Katyn case be declared illegal. Recall that in this statement, the deputies claimed that the crime in Katyn was committed by order of Joseph Stalin, and Yevgeny Dzhugashvili claimed that this statement was unfounded and filed a lawsuit in the deputies 100 million rubles. Yevgeny Yakovlevich filed another lawsuit in Georgia - there he managed to win it, because he had legal proceedings with public figure Grigol Oniani, who claimed that Yevgeny Yakovlevich was in fact not Dzhugashvili, but an impostor, moreover by the last name Rabinovich. A Tbilisi court has officially established that Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili is the grandson of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin and the son of Yakov Iosifovich Dzhugashvili.\n\nBy the way, Yevgeny Yakovlevich not only defended the honor of his grandfather, but also played his role in the film \"Jacob - Stalin's Son\", filmed in 1990 year. The portrait similarity of Yevgeny Dzhugashvili with Iosif Dzhugashvili was noted by many, including the legendary Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov. The former Soviet people's commissar, who was fortunate enough to live up to the 1980s, recalled: “Look at Yevgeny, another son of Dzhugashvili, he, like poured, looks like his ancestors. Those who met and talked with Stalin will surely notice their similarity, not only external, but also in the manner of walking, generally in behavior, character. I am glad that Eugene often visits me, brings his sons Vissarion and Yakov Dzhugashvili. Meetings with them prolong my life, give me strength ”(quoted in: History of Russia. Stalin’s grandchildren // http://www.istorya.ru/book/stalin/06.php).\n\nFamily and Children\n\nWe can not say about the personal life of Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili, especially since it also applies to the continuation of the kind of Stalin. Yevgeny Yakovlevich married a Georgian girl, three years younger - Nanuli Georgievna Nozadze was born in 1939, she graduated from the philological faculty of Tbilisi University. They had two children in a marriage. In 1965, Vissarion Evgenievich Dzhugashvili was born, and in 1972, Yakov Evgenievich Dzhugashvili was born. The eldest son Vissarion graduated from the Tbilisi Agricultural Institute, and then - two-year higher courses of directors and scriptwriters at VGIK. In 2000, he made a film about his grandfather \"Jacob - Stalin's Son.\" In 2002, Vissarion Dzhugashvili left for the United States of America. The reason for this was the attack on him in Tbilisi, at the entrance of his own house, after which Vissarion decided to become a political emigrant. Married to Nana Japaridze, Vissarion has two sons - Joseph 1994, born - the full namesake of his great-great-grandfather, and Jacob 2000, born.\n\nThe second son, Yakov Evgenievich Dzhugashvili, graduated from high school in Moscow, then studied at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts, at the School of Art in Glasgow (Great Britain). Professional artist. Married to Nina Lomkatsi, he has a daughter, Olga Catherine. Yakov, like his father, is jealous of the memory of his great-grandfather. He also adheres to patriotic and communist convictions, sympathizes with Russia, considering himself a patriot. Jacob Dzhugashvili is convinced that anti-Stalinism is an attempt to defeat the defeated fascism and claims that it is built on deliberately distorting history, fictional facts, which aim to discredit Soviet history and personally of Joseph Stalin.\n\n- Yevgeny Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili and his younger son Yakov Dzhugashvili\n\nThus, the branch of Stalin's descendants, represented by Eugene Yakovlevich Dzhugashvili, his sons and grandchildren, to some extent, is the most colorful. After all, it is these people who are striving to uphold to the last the memory of their grandfather, remain loyal to the communist ideals, which are very unpopular in the modern world and were rejected even by other relatives of the late Soviet leader. You can have a different attitude to the historical figure of Stalin, but the desire of Yevgeny Dzhugashvili to preserve the memory of his grandfather in a positive way cannot but evoke understanding and respect.\n\nP P 'SЊSЏ RџRѕR \"RѕRЅSЃRєRёR№"
