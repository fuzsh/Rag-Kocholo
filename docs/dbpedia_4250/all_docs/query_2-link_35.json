He would eventually go back to his native Georgia, and leave the movement behind, which, in my biased opinion, could actually end up strengthening the Soviet Union when it is created, and allowing Trotsky (or someone else) to succeeded Lenin when he dies.\n\nI personally am not a big fan of Butterflies changing everything, so I do think that World War One would be virtually unchanged except for a few minor details, but after the 1917 Revolution in Russia the major changes start up.\n\nWhat think?\n\nThis has been an idea that has been rolling around in my head for a bit: what if Stalin's first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, didn't die of tuberculosis in 1907?\n\nI personally believe that Stalin, under pressure from the only women (or, for that matter, person) that he ever loved, might have scaled back his revolutionary motives until at last leaving the Bolsheviks in the early 1910's.
