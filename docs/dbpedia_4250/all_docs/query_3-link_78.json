        "text": "Dictatorships have been around since the fifth century BCE. However, sociological studies on authoritarianism only began in the early 1950s. Social scientists have studied the effects of an authoritarian personality on politics. Social scientists have also studied the impetus for authoritarian personalities. This paper will compare the childhoods of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. This paper will also discuss how their authoritarian personalities affected interpersonal relationships.\n\nBoth dictators did not have a happy childhood. Hitler’s father was a “cruel and emotionally distant alcoholic”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 24). His father (Alois) was also physically and verbally abusive. Their relationship was strained by their differing priorities. Alois was not pleased with Hitler’s poor academic performance. Their relationship was further hindered when Hitler dreams of becoming an artist. Alois had responded “Not as long as I live. Never!”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 24). Hitler’s mother “doted on him, and expressed much love and affection”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 24). Hitler was therefore exposed to two parenting extremes, an abusive parent and a parent that coddles him. His bad behavior went unpunished. His mother gave unwarranted praise and attention regardless of his behavior. Hitler “grew to be demanding, ill-mannered, and indolent” (Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 24). Social scientists argue that Hitler’s authoritarianism is rooted in his cultural upbringing(st). Mothers were passive and fathers were domineering. The father never admitted to his mistakes. Fathers “asserted male authority by instilling fear in” his sons and daughters (Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25). Children were subjected to obsessive and repetitive chores to avoid ‘punishment’. This is because “obedience was of greatest importance” to the German family(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25).\n\nMuch of Hitler’s childhood experience could explain his psychological development. Hitler advocated an “ideology in which he was the predestined savior”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25)(st). In his fantasy he rescues his “nation from the Jewish nemesis”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25). He then implements a “system based on fear and spite”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25). Moreover, the system prioritizes “obedience and [promotes] violent struggle”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25). Common sense seems to indicate that the traditional German father influenced Hitler(st). Hitler was unknowingly trying to relive his childhood trauma. But in this narrative Hitler could be the aggressor instead of victim. In addition, Hitler’s trauma caused Hitler to develop an insecure attachment style. Insecure Attachment is a relationship style where bonds are contaminated by fear. People with insecure attachments lack the ability to build trust with others. In addition, insecurely attached individuals become easily distrusting of others. These characteristics also “became the quintessential characteristic of his government and culture of Nazi society”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25).\n\nStalin, like Hitler, suffered at the hands of an “abusive, alcoholic father”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 25). Who also “victimized his family and deserted them”. This forced Stalin’s mother into housework. The undeserved beatings Stalin received hardened him as a person. Whether unconsciously or consciously “men [with] authority … reminded him of his father”. Hatred towards his father initiated feelings of revenge against men in authority. Which “became the goal towards which every thing was aimed”(Suny, R.,48). Stalin grew to be an insecure man of low self- esteem. “Stalin created an elevated self-image [which] was undermined by an abusive father”(Suny, R., 48). Stalin seemed to live by two effective extremes. The first effective extreme was that he worshiped himself. He dealt with this by promoting a narcissistic cult of personality”(Suny, R., 48). The second of his effective extremes was self-hatred. Oppressive fathers stunt the emotional growth of children. This because, the fathers, are often projecting inadequacy onto the vulnerable children. These children try to combat vulnerability by projecting it onto others. They prey on the weaknesses of others, resulting in a cult personality. Hitler and Stalin (in their minds) were able to be the strong heroes they desperately needed when they were young.\n\nEach dictator’s self-worth caused differing educational success and contrasting heterosexual relationships. Hitler was a mediocre student who neglected his work for artistic pursuits. One teacher called him “uncontrolled, dogmatic, hot-tempered…and despotic”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). Hitler spent his childhood alone. In the absence of close friendships, he spent his time daydreaming. One exception was an acquaintance: August Kubizek. They met in their late teens. Social scientists noted that Kubizek listened to Hitler attentively, without expecting reciprocity. Also, no “evidence exists that peer bullying caused Hitler’s withdrawn nature”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). Hitler scoffed at marriage, most of all for its “legal [pretensions].” In Hitler’s view, “a lover is much more practical”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 28)(st). He also believed that “any man can stamp his personality onto a woman” (Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 28). What Hitler really means is that he projected his inadequacy onto others. Which is also a common defense mechanism for insecure individuals. Stalin, compared to Hitler, was an excellent student. Stalin unlike Hitler “graduated from high school with honors in 1894”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). He was described to have natural intelligence. He paid attention to detail and had a “prodigious memory”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). This of course “impressed his teachers”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). Stalin “was also a loner, but he was bullied at school”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). Specifically, Stalin was bullied for his “socioeconomic status, short height, and thick Georgian accent”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 27). He was also ridiculed for his pox marks and his asymmetrical arms. These features were often omitted in his portraits. His portraits made him “looking large, domineering, and handsome”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 28). Stalin was physically and verbally abusive towards his wife Ekaterina Svanidze. But surprisingly “experienced sincere grief upon her death”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 28). Stalin and his second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, had a turbulent relationship. She was unafraid of publicly criticizing him. He “frequently retaliated with attempts to humiliate her”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 28). Hitler demonstrated the hostile lashing out. Authoritarian theorists considered this a byproduct of childhood sexual and emotional oppression. Stalin had clearer motivations, as he had been the victim of bullying.\n\nHitler and Stalin differ in their methods of parenting. Their methods of parenting indicates their inability to cope with childhood traumas. Hitler remained a bachelor and refrained from marriage until his last days. He admits that he could not marry because he is “a collective”(Dreijmanis, J., 121)(st). He did not see himself as an individual but as ‘whole nation’. His charismatic leadership was seen as an extension of his “narcissistic universe”(Dreijmanis, J., 121). Appearing dedicated to Germany’s power and prosperity was important to his personality. Although Hitler was a bachelor, his paternalistic behavior manifested throughout his dictatorship. Stalin verbally abused his two sons—Yakov and Vasily. However, he demonstrated affection and over-protection for Svetlana, his daughter. He was so “verbally abusive that Yakov attempted suicide by gunshot but failed”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 29). Stalin often mocked and demeaned Yakov for his failed suicide attempt. Yako later joined the Red army and was captured by the Germans. Stalin was given an offer for his sons release. However, Stalin has refused to negotiate. This tells us a great deal about Stalin’s role as a father(st). Here “we see traces of early psychological theories of authoritarianism”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 29). These theories “place emphasis on the oppressive role of putative fathers”(Husain, M., & Liebertz, S., 29). Stalin, the victim of a putative father, was repeating his father’s errors. His relationship with his sons show aggression towards those who violated his expectations. It also shows aggression towards those who lack obedience. These are also known as two important characteristics of the authoritarian personality.\n\nIn conclusion this paper compared Hitler’s boyhood to Stalin’s boy hood. This paper also discussed how their authoritarian personalities affected their personal relationships. The comparison between Hitler and Stalin reveals some surprising similarities and differences.\n\nReference list:\n\nDreijmanis, J. (2005).
