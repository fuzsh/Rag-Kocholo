        "text": "Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1922-1953, when he died. He was responsible for one of the most notable and devastating genocides, the Great Purge. His vicious reign took the lives of around 20-60 million people by his rigid and cruel treatment. Through his exploitation of the lower class and his manipulative abuse of power, Stalin created one of the worst examples of leadership in history. It takes an interesting character to be able to execute the cruelties displayed in his regime and the traits that Stalin developed into his cult of personality were likely acquired as a child and adolescent.\n\nThis paper will discuss how Stalin’s background helped build the qualities of a ruthless leader and how he displayed them …show more content…\n\nStalin had two wives; Ekaterina Svanidze (m. 1906–1907) and Nadezhda Alliluyeva (m. 1919–1932).

He was born with his second and third toe conjoined and due to blood poisoning; his right arm was made shortened and stiff. Stalin was abused by both his parents, his father in particular, although his mother claimed he had a wonderful childhood and home life.\n\nStalin and Marxism\n\nStalin learned about Marxism at a young age. He even studied and wrote about it prior to the revolution. However, once he was tasked with preserving it as a power in the USSR, he quickly demonstrated that"
