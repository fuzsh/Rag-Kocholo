        "text": "The Soviet Union gulag system under Stalin’s rule were corrective labor camps which consisted of more than 30,000 camps. The Gulag withheld many types of prisoners serving as the Soviet’s main disciplinary systems for mainly robbers, rapists, murders, and thieves. Additionally , the Gulag held political prisoners, which included real offenders as well as innocents caught up in the anger of the Soviets. Other than criminals, political prisoners, and innocents, people who arrived late to work three times, told jokes about a Communist Party official, or taking more food left in a field than told after working could send a person to the Gulag for up to 25 years. Many people in the countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were deported to labor\n\nHe left Trotsky in charge of planning the event, and he became the main leader of the Bolsheviks, the communist party he founded. In an attempt to bring the government down,in November 6th the Red Guards, first took main points in the city of Petrograd . Not many people were killed in the process. In November 8, the soldiers decided to take the Winter Palace. Here the Provisional Government surrendered and were captured and arrested.Lenin then gave a speech, revealing his own self and announcing that the government he was creating.\n\nTrotsky in 1918 became the war commissar and he created the red army, and was a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War 1918–20. He was a great public speaker and war tactician. However many Bolsheviks were afraid that he would become a military dictator such as Nicholas 2nd was. Also he had a reputation for being arrogant which made him unpopular within the party, also after Lenin died the triumvirate group established this group was made up of Kamenev, Zinoviev and Stalin their aim was not to get Stalin into power but to keep Trotsky out of reach of power.\n\nNo citizen was immune to the wayward forced labor camps that were formed in the Soviet Union officially in 1930. These camps were administered by the government agency known as The Main Administration of Corrective Labor Camps and Labor Settlements. This agency was then referred to as the acronym for this title- Gulag- and eventually the whole camp system was known as the Gulag (Applebaum viii). The Gulags were the Soviet’s penal system and Stalin’s administration used the camps as free labor to complete construction projects involving canals, railways, roads, and mines. Anyone could be sent, without trial, to a Gulag camp, regardless of their gender, age, political views, or ancestry. Felons who committed crimes of rape, murder, and robbery\n\nIn terms of government, there is no act crueler than genocide. The definition for genocide is “the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group”. Such an event happened in Soviet Russia in the 1930’s. Josef Stalin, the leader at the time, enacted a plan to purge his country of all who opposed him in order to strengthen his power. The cruel measures enacted were a horrifying example of how much power Stalin had, and how ruthless the USSR was, even to its own people.\n\n“Of the delegates who attended the National Congress of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) in 1934, fully 70 percent had been executed by the time of the National Congress in 1939” (pg. 90). Through this purge, Stalin solidified his control over the communist party and the country. Lenin differed by allowing his Bolshevik opponents to remain in their posts, but was mindful of their activities. He took action to prevent these opponents from ousting him form power. This action can be seen when Lenin, weary of his opponents turning to the Romanov family for leadership had the entire family executed.\n\nThe NEP was not able to sufficiently entice the peasants into selling their grain. Surprisingly, the NEP had originally been introduced to help provide more incentive for peasants to part with their grain voluntarily through the promise of private trade. Despite the incentive, the peasants of the country began to consume more of their produce in the 1920’s than in times before the revolution. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in the grain procurement by the country. Stalin, violently angry at the grain shortage resorted to “emergency measures.” Stalin insured that Article 107 of the Criminal code, which spoke of the “deprivation of liberty,” would be extensively applied to peasants that were speculated to be withholding grain. Additionally, these emergency measures led to illegal house to house searches for the procurement of grain. This often resulted in beatings and arrests of traders and peasants. In one instance, Stalin was forced to defend his use of coercion, in which he stated, “Point out even one political measure taken by the party that has not been accompanied by excesses of one kind or another.” Despite these awful occurrences, Stalin believed himself to have discovered a solution to the grain deficit. Stalin envisioned a collectivization of agriculture. Stalin believed that it was no longer possible for the country to thrive on an individual small peasant based economy. Stalin insisted that\n\nBy removing anyone who stood in the way of his policies, Stalin was free to rule the way he saw fit. In essence Stalin had created a government where anything he said, went. The Purges also changed the face of the government. Offices that had long been held by a single man were now occupied by new faces. This is comparable to the personnel changes that occurred during the October Revolution.\n\nAdolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin were two of the most disturbing and deadliest national leaders of their time. Although they were both born of unpretentious backgrounds, their interest was in radical political movements. Because it was during the most vulnerable time of WW1 and WW2, their rise to power was nearly effortless. Though they were formidable opponents, there was much that Stalin(leader of a Soviet Union) and Hitler(leader of the Nazi’s) had in common. As revolutionaries in the 1900’s, Europe's history has been affected due to their dreadful powers. Both promised modernism and progress in the average daily life of a countryman, but they were more troublesome with embellishing and broadening their power than to help an enormous dollop of unease people in their economy. Where Hitler's\n\nJoseph Stalin was born on December 18th, 1879, in Gori, Georgia. He was the son of a cobbler and a washerwomen. Joseph was a very weak child. He has scars on his face from smallpox whenever he was only seven. He was in a carriage accident a couple years after that that left his left arm a little disfigured. He could have gotten his injury from blood poisoning. The children around him treated him awful because of he was seen as nothing but weak. This led Joseph to want to be respected more and he wanted to be better overall. This also led him to be awful to anyone that was mean to him.\n\nThe April Theses consisted of ten commandments and ideas based on Lenin’s speeches, which published in the Bolshevik newspaper, Pravda. Moreover, “... Hectored large crowds and churned out endless articles, insisting, ‘No great question . . . has yet been resolved in history other than by force.’”(Reynold, 42). Even if the ideologies grew towards the media, no one seemed to respect Lenin’s ideas beforehand to the point where “Even Nadya was overheard telling a friend, ‘I am afraid it looks as if Lenin has gone crazy.’” (Reynolds 42) when Lenin announced his speech. Despite the inquiries of his sanity, in 1917, “...the Bolsheviks accepted Lenin’s April Theses to guide their activity, would revolutionary socialists accord world-historical significance to the Soviet” (Marot 142). Furthermore, the Bolsheviks accepted Lenin’s directives due to his composed slogan “All Power to the Soviets”, meaning how most of the power of Russia would transfer to the Soviets, their main leading group. The April Theses contained several policies that promised to restore the order of Russia and for those starving. As part of his plan, Lenin wanted to utilize the existing “capitalist state as an instrument to overthrow capitalism and then build socialism with it.”(Marot 143). Moreover, Lenin also wanted to use the Paris Commune and Karl Marx’s theory of communism as examples for Russia’s developing government. With the new expanding government of Russia, Lenin incorporated several of his policies as his contribution to the Bolshevik party, especially when “...he argued that only the Soviet could respond to the hopes, aspirations, and needs of Russia’s workers and peasants.” (“Lenin, Vladimir Ilich”). In Lenin’s perspective, the Soviets\n\nIn 1912, Joseph Stalin was appointed by Vladimir Lenin to serve on the first central committee of the Bolshevik Party. The Bolsheviks were a member of the Russian Social Democratic Party. After the October Revolution on November 9, 1917, in which they seized power in Russia, they were renamed the Communist Party. A little over a year later, on January 22, 1918, Ukraine declared independence as the Ukrainian National Republic. Then, in 1920, the Bolsheviks gained control of Ukraine with the help of Lenin’s Red Army."
