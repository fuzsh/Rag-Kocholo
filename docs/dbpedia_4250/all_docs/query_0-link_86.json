        "text": "As secretary-general of the Communist party, Joseph Stalin was effectively the Soviet Union’s head-of-state from 1924–53. He was premier from 1941. An advocate of Leninism, he rapidly industrialized the economy and enforced agricultural collectivization. He led the Soviet Union to ultimate victory during World War II and was overlord of the communist Eastern Bloc in the aftermath. He encouraged a personality cult and his totalitarian regime relied on terror as its chief weapon of enforcement. The persecution of perceived political enemies, allied to the disastrous effects of agricultural collectivization and the limited benefits of industrialization resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of Soviet citizens. His animosity towards the West propelled the world into the Cold War, the impact of his reign continuing long after his death."
