        "text": "Stalin\n\nA trip to Racha: Day 2\n\nThis post follows on from A trip to Racha: Day 1\n\nBecause some of our group were enjoying the previous night’s supra (Georgian feast) until 3am, Sunday didn’t get off to an early start. After we’d breakfasted and got everything ready, we finally left the guest house at 1pm. The weather on the Saturday had been hot and dry, on the Sunday it was cooler and more overcast with some rain.\n\nStalin’s first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, was born in Racha, tragically she died of typhus at the age of just 22. Stalin reputedly said ‘This creature softened my heart of stone. She’s died and with her have died my last warm feelings for humanity.’ Stalin allowed her funeral to take place in an Orthodox church despite his atheism.\n\nOur first visit would be to another church, the chapel of the Virgin at Barakoni in the village of Tsesi built in 1753.\n\nThe grass around the church is still cut with a scythe.\n\nThe church was closed and desecrated under the Bolshevik rule. It suffered further damage, though not serious, in the 1991 Racha earthquake, but was quickly repaired.\n\nAfter Barakoni we took a long unpaved muddy track up into the Khikhata range to the church of St George in the mountain village of Mravaldzali. The views over to the peaks of Svaneti were awesome. We passed another vehicle, whose driver suggested we had just another 2km to travel, half an hour later we finally reached Mravaldzali church. Nika’s driving was exemplary.\n\nThe interior of the church felt holy. A sanctuary from the outside world.\n\nWe didn’t stay long at the church and returned along the muddy track admiring the view until we came out by the River Rioni.\n\nThen, as is the Georgian custom another supra, I sat out most of this feast, my stomach is not Georgian.\n\nWe finally got on the road home at 9pm, arriving in Tbilisi around 1 am.\n\nA Trip to Prometheus Cave and Kutaisi: Part Two: Bagrati Cathedral, Gelati Monastery and Motsameta Monastery\n\nThe two principal tourist draws for Georgia are its natural wonders like the caves and mountains and its old churches. Georgia boasts being the second country to convert to Christianity (Armenia was first), today most Georgians are Orthodox, despite the efforts of their most famous son (Stalin) to turn them to atheism.\n\nThis is the second part of my post about our trip to Kutaisi on 7 June 2015 and features some of Georgia’s most important religious monuments.\n\nKutaisi is Georgia’s second city, to many it seems just like a large village.\n\nOur planned itinerary for the day was :\n\nPrometheus Cave (click on this link to see the first part of the blogpost)\n\nSataplia Cave\n\nBagrati Cathdedral\n\nGelati Monastery\n\nMotsameta Monastery\n\nRestaurant for a Georgian Feast (Supra)\n\nWe had to cancel our planned visit to Sataplia Cave, because the site was overbooked by school parties, who were visiting the same day as us. Prometheus Cave is bigger but lacks the famous dinosaur footprints found at Sataplia Cave. Ah well, we will have something to see next time.\n\nBagrati Cathedral is one of the distinct landmarks of Kutaisi, an impressive building that was officially rebuilt in 2012 after heavy damage. The original Cathedral was built in the 11th Century. UNESCO was not impressed and considered the rebuilding damaged “the integrity and authenticity of the site”.\n\nThis is an image from the Wikipedia of Bagrati Cathedral under construction in 2009.\n\nGeorgian Cathedrals have a lot of interesting stone carvings on the walls.\n\nAfter Bagrati we headed out of Kutaisi to Gelati Monastery. The Gelati monastic complex near Kutaisi contains the Church of the Virgin founded by the King of Georgia David the Builder in 1106, and the 13th-century churches of St George and St Nicholas. Gelati Monastery was eulogised as the “New Athens” and the “Second Jerusalem”, and was one of the most important historical and cultural centres in the Middle Ages.\n\nWe visited the church at the time a wedding was being performed, a lot of weddings were scheduled for 7 June as it is the day before the fast for St Peter and St Paul, which lasts until mid July.\n\nOne of the main attractions for me, was an old GAZ M20 Pobeda in the grounds.\n\nMaka liked the “Pobeda”, too. “Pobeda” means victory, Stalin preferred the name to “Rodina” meaning Motherland\n\nAlso there were plenty of birds to admire of the feathered kind, like these ravens.\n\nA lot of construction work is ongoing at Gelati.\n\nOur final sight was Little Motsameta Monastery, which sits on a spectacular clifftop promontory.\n\nAt the car park I find another delightful old Soviet car, a Zaporozhets 968M.\n\nFinally in the tradition of these trips we ended with a Supra (Georgian Feast), we convened at the Old Imereti Restaurant in Kutaisi, where my batteries died. Maybe just as well with the dancing in the minibus on the way home to Tbilisi.\n\n42.250000 42.700000\n\nA Visit to Mtskheta\n\nMtskheta is the spiritual capital of Georgia, it was the real capital until the 5th century when King Vakhtang Gorgesali changed the capital to Tbilisi. Here St Nino converted the Iverian Kingdom to Christianity. It lies less than 25 km North of Tbilisi on the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi Rivers.\n\nDriving to Mtskheta, the first monument to notice is Jvari Church overlooking Mtskheta, “Jvari” means holy cross, between 585 and 604 Karteli Duke Stepanoz I constructed the church on the hilltop. One of the attractions for tourists to Georgia is the ancient church architecture, which somehow managed to survive all the invasions by Arabs, Turks, Mongols, Persians and Russians.\n\nDominating the town of Mtskheta is the grand Svetitskhoveli Cathedral built in the 11th Century. According to tradition Christ’s robe lies buried beneath the cathedral.\n\nWomen visiting an Orthodox Cathedral are required to wear a dress and cover their heads. I take the symbol with the camera to mean no flash photography, usually my flash is “forced off”, I only use it rarely in certain conditions, I prefer my photographs to be illminated where possible with the light I see, artificial or natural, not by my flash.\n\nI recently read about some monks searching for relics in A Morbid Taste for Bones a Cadfael mystery by Ellis Peters. Here in the cathedral a foot shaped reliquary holds a bone from Saint Andrew’s foot.\n\nAround the Cathedral are many souvenir stalls, selling a wide range of items including some depicting Stalin. It is a tricky business when the most famous Georgian was also a murderous dictator.\n\nAfter walking around the cathedral and looking at Samtavro Church, we attempted to take a road to Armazi’s fortress but it proved unsuitable for the Toyota Vitz we were travelling in (needed a 4 x 4), so we abandoned that idea and as we were hungry, we headed for a local Khinkhali restaurant.\n\nIn addition to Khinkhali a meat filled dumpling, we had mtsvadi (grilled meat), Georgian Pickles, lobio (beans) and mchadi (a maize flour bread). Khato, my wife, is fasting for Lent so she just had lobio and mchadi. Mtskheta is famous for lobio which is served in a clay pot.\n\nDrinking Buddies?"
