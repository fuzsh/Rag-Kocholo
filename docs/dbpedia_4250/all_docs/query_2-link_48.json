He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically adhering to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, he formalized these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies are called Stalinism.\n\nHe was born Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, which in Russian is Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин and in Georgian is იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე სტალინი.\n\nSources\n\nWikidata: Item Q855, en:Wikipedia\n\nJosef Stalin Original name: Iosif Dzhugashvili on Find A Grave: Memorial #970 Retrieved 17:28, 21 April 2017 (EDT).\n\nThis week's featured connections are Princesses: Joseph Vissarionovich is 23 degrees from Catherine Mountbatten-Windsor, 23 degrees from Joan of Kent, 22 degrees from Mary Stuart, 21 degrees from Marguerite de France, 28 degrees from Maud of England, 21 degrees from Louise Argyll, 22 degrees from Elisabeth Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, 22 degrees from Sophie Hedevig Oldenburg, 26 degrees from Ingeborg Håkonsdatter, 28 degrees from 방자 이, 19 degrees from Rachel Parker and 23 degrees from Clotilde di Borbone-Francia on our single family tree.
