        "text": "P.S. I am not good in making things accurate, I just want to make this for fun, even if it is ASB (even ASBs are possible? Supernatural eh? Well, there are lots of possibilities), so this it:\n\nDuring a date between Stalin and his wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, Ekaterina coughs 7 times, due to the wine she, and her husband, was drinking. This woud change history, forever.\n\n1907, Ekaterina avoids Typhus.\n\nShe further softened the once reckless and aggressive man, into someone so soft no one would dare kill him.\n\nYet, other than the people he truly loves, he was still a person so demanding, a competitor, and wanted high expectations.\n\nYet, due to his wife, the Soviet Union developed into a Single-Party Democracy, with other elements of Democracy other than the elections (rights, freedoms) like the United States, but with religious freedom, and intolerance against LGBTs.\n\nYears later, Stalin is leader of the USSR. Though the Holodomor was averted, the quick industrialiation happened in the large country, further spreading to the eastern parts of the RSFSR, and the other allies, namely the Tuvan People's Republic, and the Mongolian People's Republic.\n\nThe Purges are averted. The Soviet Union saves it's officer corps, and adopts Deep Operations (which is claimed to be similar to Blitzkrieg), and further advanced doctrines in Defense and Offense.\n\nAs World War II happens, the Soviets prop up their Armed Forces.Willing to take advice, Stalin, by June 1941, had ordered to amass troops at the Western Borders in the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR.Troops are stopped at Odessa, Minsk and Vilnius and Kaunas.\n\nThe Soviet Union, after 1941, begins to push east, easily.\n\nBy April 1941, the Soviets have marched through all of Eastern Europe, and has reached Eastern Germany (former DDR borders). They have also invaded Greece and Turkey, and Persia (after not expelling the Axis diplomats). They happen to also created the atomic bomb by 1944, with the help of German rocket and ballistic scientists, and Soviet Spies in the U.K. and the U.S., and use this to defeat the Japanese, and liberating Asia. (Southeast Asia gains independence, but will only be Finlandisized).\n\nBy advice, Stalin stops there (Stalin does not really want a Germany united so as, although requiring the Nazi Government to hand over the weapons to the Soviet Troops and ordering the Nazi Scientists to work for the Soviet Government, but are given money in order to work well.\n\nThey happen to also created the atomic bomb by 1944, with the help of German rocket and ballistic scientists, and Soviet Spies in the U.K. and the U.S., and use this to defeat the Japanese, and liberating Asia. (Southeast Asia gains independence, but will only be Finlandisized, and would have strong ties to the USSR).\n\nIsrael becomes independent, with most help coming from the Soviet Union, and becomes a member of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nFrance is liberated by the British, after all forces there were sent to the East and were destroyed.Only a few pockets of the Nazi Armed Forces remain here.\n\nItaly's Mussolini would face a revolution and became Communist. The Vatican City is burned down, and the Catholic Leaders (including Pope) killed.\n\nSan Marino faces the Same Fate as Italy.\n\nThe U.S., threatened by possible Communist dominance, helps the British in the Cold War.\n\nChina becomes Communist. So did Korea. The Great Leap Forward is a success (Mao before becoming a revolutionaty, studies economics in Europe, where he read Marx's writings.) China, becomes the largest Country, economic and Military within the Communist bloc.\n\nThe USSR's economy expands through the Cold War, along with it's Allies and Finlandisized States, and it and it's Sphere develops Armed Forces seven times larger than NATO, and much more advanced.\n\nMore countries become Communist in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\nThe U.S., has an economic Crisis in 1973, and further removes itself in the International Scene.\n\nBy 1989, the Soviets Win.\n\nThe Hero of the Masses, Joseph Stalin, dies at the age of 95.\n\n_____________\n\nJust for fun."
