        "text": "Ekaterina \"Kato\" Svanidze (Georgian: ეკატერინე \"კატო\" სვანიძე; April 2, 1885 – December 5, 1907) was the Georgian first wife of Joseph Stalin. They were married in 1906.\n\nShe was a daughter of Semon Svanadze and Sephora (née Dvali). Ekaterina, nicknamed Kato, was a tailor who worked for the ladies of the Russian army\n\nShe had two sisters, Alexandra (nicknamed \"Sashiko\") and Maria (\"Mariko\"). She had at least one brother, but some sources claim she had more than one. Because her only known brother Alexander Svanidze spoke German and French and studied in Germany, it is unlikely that her family was poor. Alexander Svanidze was married to Maria Korona, a singer at the Tiflis Opera.\n\nKato Svanidze married Joseph Stalin in St. David's church at Tiflis in 1906. They had a son, Yakov Dzhugashvili. She died of typhus in 1907. Much of her family (including her sister Mariko and brother Alexander) would later be executed during her husband's Great Terror.\n\nIt is stated that Ekaterina died of tuberculosis in Stalin's arms.\n\nStalin would later state that, other than his mother, she may have been the only person he truly loved. At her funeral, he said \"This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.\""
