HISTORICAL EXPLAINATION ABOUT AKBAR TOMB (SIKANDRA) ?

SikandraLodhi, the second last emperor of the Lodhi dynasty, founded Agra city (1503), in continuation of the Lodhi empire' expansion. He set up the Sikandra village at the periphery of Akbar which derived its name from his founder SikandraLodhi. He declared Agra, the capital of the Lodhi Empire and was reigning Delhi by using Agra Fort as headquarter. On the right side of the monument ticket booking office, you can see the Tomb of SikandraLodhi where he was buried tentatively and later his burial was transferred to the Lodhi garden at Delhi. Same side some distance from this tomb, you can seethe KanchMahal constructed by the fourth Mughal king Jahangir. Its construction took 14 years which started from 1605 to 1619. Jahangir used to drink wine and construction was only done when he visited here in his spare time. Here you can see the eye-catching designs of wine bottles, jugs, plates, bowls and some brightly coloured glasswork that have increased their beauty on full moon nights. Agra was declared famous during the administration of Jalaludin Mohammad Akbar (1556-1605),the third emperor of the Mughal Empire. It is the capital of the Mughal Empire.

Agra tour guide provides detailed information on the history of the Mughal Empire and Great Akbar. At that time this city was called Akbarabad. It is believed that emperor Akbar had earmarked this place for burial during his lifetime (as per Tartary tradition). Also, the tomb of Akbar faces towards the east (rising sun) instead of Masjid at Mecca irrelevant to the traditional Mughal design.

INDO ISLAMIC CONSTRUCTION AT AKBAR TOMB(SIKANDRA)?

Akbar was Muslim though he was known for his tolerant and amiable policies towards other religions. During his tenure he had propounded the spiritual program known as Din- I- Ilahi (the religion of God) which encapsulate good virtues and values of every faith prevailing at that time. To make this principle effective he established matrimonial relationships with ladies of royal families. He had three wives of different religions namely Jodhabai (Hindu Rajput), Turkey Sultana (Muslim Turkish) and Mariam-uz-Zamani (Christian). There are four gates for accessing the tomb of Akbar. Nowadays the southern gate(also known as Jahanjiri Gate) is used for the entrance of tourists, a double story gate surmounted with four tall marble minarets depicting Islamic designs, each 172 feet height. Here you can see conspicuously the Arabic text (Sura) from the holy book Quran engraved on the entrance side of the gate. You can also see Lotus flower engraved on the gate, swastika designs made in red and black colour, and umbrella-shaped structures on minarets representing Hindu religion. Bottom of the gate bear designs of cross and stars engraved in black and white marble which represents Christianity. There is a small gate of 6 feet height right in front of the Jahanjiri gate and there is an anecdote about this small gate and your tour guide will narrate you. Akbar was advised by his minister Birbal that people who respect him by bowing their heads down may not show the same respect and courtesy once he dies. So Akbar built a small gate just in front of this tomb, with the intention that after his death, those who visited his tomb would be forced to bow to honor his tomb after his death.

CONTROVERSY ABOUT AKBAR TOMB?

Aurangzeb, the great-grandson of Akbar and the sixth Mughal emperor, was notorious as a hardcore Islamic fanatic ruler. He demolished a lot of temples and started the forceful conversion. Consequently, it invited irk of Jat Raja Ram Singh who attacked the Akbar Tomb from the northern gate(badly damaged). He looted the valuables from Akbar Tomb especially gold by melting its wall and ceiling (walls are still black due to burnt carbon). He dug up the grave of Akbar and burnt his bones too, which was unjustified revenge.
