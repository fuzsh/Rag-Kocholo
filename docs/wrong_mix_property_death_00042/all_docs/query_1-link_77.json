        "text": "“If ever a leader merited a tautology, it was the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great (literally, “Great the Great”). Under Akbar, a collection of fiefs … grew into the great Mughal Empire ….. Akbar sponsored artisans, poets, engineers and philosophers. He was a canny warlord … and … while a Muslim, Akbar was spiritually curious and hosted religious scholars from Hindu gurus to Jesuits at his vast, diverse court. At his capital city of Fatehpur Sikri, he championed melding of Hinduism and Islam known as the din-i-ilahi or the “divine faith.” While the creed no longer lingers, the ethos of pluralism and tolerance that defined Akbar’s age underlies the values of the modern republic of India.” from “Akbar the Great” by By Ishaan Tharoor (2011)\n\nI’m in the state of Uttar Pradesh, heading towards Agra. Agra is famous for its beautiful marble inlay work and the stunning red sandstone and marble architecture of Mughal times – you may have heard of the Taj Mahal – the most stunning example of white marble architecture that exists.\n\nAbout 40km before Agra is the “ghost city” of Fatehpur Sikri (City of Victory), built by the Great Emperor Akbar. Born in Pakistan and a descendant of Genghis Khan, Akbar ascended the throne at age 13. He was known for his great courage and adventurous nature – he liked to hunt for elephants. He had a disrupted childhood – his parents were exiled in Persia and although he was raised in Pakistan, his tutors were Persian and he had been in endless military conflicts across India since his ascendancy.\n\nWhen he was 27, Akbar married his first wife, Jodha Bai (or Harkha Bai) a Rajput princess from Amber. A wise man, Shaikh Salim Chisti, predicted Akbar’s first son would be born at this place and later that same year, a boy was born here to Jodha Bai and Akbar (he ruled as Emperor Jahāngīr). Akbar decided this place on the Sikri ridge was so special he moved his capital city from Agra to here.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, Akbar planned and built a walled city and named it Fatehabad, with “Fateh”, the Persian word for “victory” and the suffix, “a-bad” for the Mughal, later changed to “-pur” (to recognise the Hindu) and Sikri for the village near here.\n\nThis is one of the best preserved areas of Mughal architecture in India. Akbar built it to reflect his familiar Persian style but it also has Indian influences. The buildings are of striking red “Sikri” sandstone, it’s abundant here. He built palaces, public buildings and mosques with living areas for the court, army, servants and his community.\n\nThere are two marvellous points about this city.\n\nFirst – it’s intriguing – although it was the capital city, it was abandoned shortly after its completion. That’s because water was scarce here and Akbar realised it was too close to areas in civil disorder at the time. So, once again, he moved his capital city – this time to Lahore (in modern day Pakistan) – and he only briefly returned to this city. It never really achieved such status again.\n\nSecond – it’s constructed in the most stunning red sandstone and adorned with stone carvings, motifs and beautiful decorations – typical of the architecture of the time and still stunning to see today.\n\nFatehpur Sikri was bounded by a city wall with seven entry gates. The imperial buildings remain and ruins of some of the bazaars. In Akbar’s time, Fatehpur Sikri was well known for its fabrics and fine silks and more recently its masons and stone carvers.\n\nAfter Akbar married Jodha Bai, as is the case in Hindu families, her father and brothers joined Akbar’s court as advisers and, although that doesn’t surprise me, I’m fascinated to learn that they were accorded an equal rank to Akbar’s Muslim courtiers.\n\nIn total, Akbar had 36 wives of various ethnic and religious backgrounds. The Palace of Jodha Bai was for his first wife – it’s the largest part of the harem, with a single magnificent gateway, a triangular ceiling and several apartments. The most beautiful Hindu motifs of swans, parrots, elephants and lotus flowers decorate it and the pillars have beautiful mouldings and graceful brackets, with arabesque designs in glazed tiles.\n\nNearby, Panch Mahal has five tiers that diminish in size up to the large-domed chhatri. The floors are supported by over a hundred intricately carved columns and because the façade was decorated with pierced stone screens, it was probably built for the ladies of the court.\n\nOh, it takes my breath away … this beautiful work ….\n\nWhenever Akbar addressed his general public, he would stand at Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), surrounded by his ministers and officers. A giant platform links this open space to the Daulat Khana (Imperial Palace), next to Diwan-i-Kas (Hall of Private Audience).\n\nHere, Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and he gave private audience. It’s a plain square building with four elevated domes (chhatris) on the roof. It’s famous for its central pillar with square base and octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs, thirty-six serpentine brackets support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each corner of the building on the first floor, by four stone walkways.\n\nThis design just screams at me to touch it. My fingers trail over the delicate patterns … interesting – a beautifully delicate pattern worked carefully into the surface of such hard, unforgiving material – it just looks so soft. The carving is deep and precise, there’s petals, leaves, curves and feathery tiny strokes – all done hundreds of years ago by craftsmen who spent hours perfecting their work. Although it’s eroded by weather (and no doubt thousands of other feeling fingers before mine), these frescoes are wonderful and magnificent.\n\nOutside, an ornamental pool, Anup Talao (Turkish Sultana) has four bridges leading to a central platform.\n\nThere were games here too, Pachisi Court was marked out as a large board game, where people (well… yes … servants) stood and moved on command as the playing pieces. Perhaps this was a precursor to the modern day Chess or Ludo?\n\nOne of the largest mosques in India, Jama Masjid, accommodates 10,000 followers. Its large dome is decorated geometrically with white marble and inside is a white marble tomb for the wise man, Shaikh Salim Chisti. His crypt is under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with mother-of-pearl mosaic. White marble serpentine brackets support sloping eaves around a parapet.\n\nBuland Damaza – is a gigantic ‘victory arch’ in the wall of the mosque. At over 500 metres high, it commemorates one of Akbar’s successful campaigns and a central portico comprises three arched entrances – the largest, Horseshoe Gate, is where horseshoes were nailed to the large wooden doors for luck.\n\nWhenever he returned to the city, Akbar’s arrival was announced by drummers in the Drum House, Naubat Khana and as this is ahead of Hathi Pol or Elephant Gate, it is thought this was the imperial entrance.\n\nThe ruins of the “Meena Bazaar” would have been the trading spot for the beautiful crafts produced here.\n\nIt is such a beautiful city. I can feel the history here and the sense of community the people who lived here may have had.\n\nThe wonderful red sandstone carving work reminds me of the timber carvings done by the tribes in Maori and Polynesian culture – theirs was used to decorate and adorn their villages, particularly the community buildings such as their Meeting House. However, I know that in those cultures the timber carving was used just as much as a defence fortification against attack as a decoration – so their carvings often depict fierce monsters or legendary demons. But here, the carving is intricate, delicate and so beautiful.\n\nFatehpur Sikri was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and is now maintained as a historic site.\n\nI reach Agra in the mid-afternoon. This city presents huge anticipation for me – I can’t wait to see the Taj Mahal with my own eyes. That pleasure awaits me tomorrow ….\n\nOohhhh – how will that be?\n\nActually … my first impression of Agra is a little disappointing … it seems a rather dingy, industrial looking place and I notice lots of cycles and rickshaw taxis in use on the roads.\n\nThat’s interesting, I hadn’t noticed quite so many cycle-based vehicles elsewhere.\n\nI settle into my hotel – its lobby is decorated in the distinctive marble inlay that this area is renowned for. On every floor, the elevator doors and corridors are richly adorned with beautiful inlaid marble. A very good move – it’s the hallmark of this area – and the designs are exquisite.\n\nWhen I return to the hotel lobby I notice a collection of retail stores (yes, always the case in tourist hotels, I know) – but there is a curio which I can’t help but be intrigued by … an Astrologer has set up shop and he advertises his services … but there’s nobody around at the moment … hmmmm … should I?\n\nBut – there’s no time to think about this now … this evening I am heading to see a live show at Kalakriti Theatre.\n\nEvery evening the Theatre presents a music and drama spectacular to tell the lovely story of Emperor Akbar’s grandson, Emperor Shah Jahan and his one true love Mumtaz Mahal. A person recommends this show to me – the ticket is a very reasonable $30 AUD – but he is so confident that I will enjoy it, he will save me the trouble of paying for my ticket if I don’t enjoy it –\n\nOkay, let’s see shall we?\n\nWhen I arrive at the theatre, the vestibule is decorated in marble artefacts, it’s lovely – and several positive features strike me about the show itself. As a non-Hindu speaker, I am given a headset to wear – I can listen to an English translation throughout the show. As I wait for the curtain to rise, my eyes scan the audience and it’s clear that several other languages would be needed – and they are provided too. That’s such a great innovation … as the show progresses the English dialogue is perfectly timed to align with the performances on stage. Fantastic.\n\nThe gestures by these characters are Bollywood to a tee – of course, this is the way Hindu people enjoy their cinema and shows, and it’s a new experience for me. All the gestures and language are larger than life – as are facial expressions – this is supported by several Bollywood style dance sequences with brightly coloured costumes and great sets. It’s quite fun and very entertaining. The story is told beautifully.\n\nA feature that surpasses all these things is in the final scene … it’s a scale model of Taj Mahal … yes, on stage. It’s quite special and created in detail to the last centimetre. I understand it’s the only one in the world – built specifically for this show.\n\nOnce again, it’s just marvellous. It leaves a lasting impression for me. No problems about paying the ticket price either – I am fully entertained by this performance.\n\nBack at the hotel, I try to use the hotel’s free “lobby” wi-fi – nope, not working for me – so I purchase a data package (24 hours for R500) – and settle down in a comfy lobby sofa to read some emails …\n\nA shadow crosses my screen – I look up into a gentle face …\n\n“Madam, did you want me to read your chart?”\n\n– it’s the Astrologer …\n\nA wave of nausea and alarm washes over me …\n\nWhat’s going on? … “Um … well … um … I don’t know“\n\nI’m a bit shocked … how did he know?? … is this mystical intervention?\n\nHe sees my astonished face and smiles …\n\n“Madam, it’s okay … I saw you when you peered through my window earlier this evening – on your way out …”\n\nOh! thank goodness ... That’s a relief! …\n\nMy anxiety dissolves. So this man is just being opportunistic … that’s better – makes much more sense …\n\nDo I want an Astrology reading? I don’t know – I’m quite open to these things and this wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been “read” … um, yeah … why not?\n\nHe needs some basic details about me – date, time and place of birth – so I give him those and he goes away to draw up my “chart”. I see from his brochure that he is tertiary qualified in some of this,\n\nOkay then – it’s worth a go ….\n\nI see to my emails for the next half hour or so then find him in his workspace off the hotel lobby.\n\nRight … just take this on face value – he’ll make some lucky guesses and then build a story from there …\n\nHe starts to talk … he summarizes the details I gave him, then he asks if I want only the good stuff or everything.\n\n“I want everything please – don’t hold back …”\n\nHe begins a description …\n\n“A person who likes to travel …”\n\nUm … duh … Yeah – tell me something you can’t guess …\n\n“A person who enjoys wearing nice things … “\n\nAgain … Genius … that’s easy to see … come on, get on with it – we’re on the clock here!\n\n“A person who has been through some challenges recently, but now knows who they are and is happy with it …”\n\nHmmm, curiously close to the truth …\n\n“A person who’s geographically distant from family, but emotionally near ….”\n\n… again, hmm – weirdly true … can that be a lucky guess?\n\nI’m getting interested in this now … I lean in … as he speaks, he describes quirks of my personality, my workstyle, my career progress, my relationships …\n\nYes, that’s me …. I gulp – I clearly recognize myself.\n\nWow … that’s pretty amazing …\n\nNow adrenaline rises in me …\n\nHe tells me that writing is to feature heavily in my future … and the path my career and my finances will take. He describes some health issues, tells me how I will meet my end and when, describes matters of emotion and some things about me that nobody could possibly know …\n\nMan, this guy’s good …\n\nHe “reads” with me for a half hour – he’s authentic enough for me to remember what he said. He’s accurate and honest – I appreciate that.\n\nYeah, I like him and I trust him.\n\nWe have a good rapport … and in an act of pure entrepreneurialism, he offers to write a full report for me … for a fee, of course. Actually, I’d like to have it – I’m not going to use it to guide my life, but it will be interesting to look back at it in the future to see what his predictions were and what actually happened in my life – and whether these things align.\n\nI agree, I’m happy to arrange that – I’ll receive it back in Australia in a few weeks … and he’ll get it to me by that ancient mystical transmission method … email.\n\nIt’s late now – I’m totally buzzed up by the experience and I’m sure I won’t get a wink of sleep – but I need to get to bed – I have a 5am start tomorrow morning.\n\n============\n\nMy early start is to view the wonderful Taj Mahal – I have written about this visit elsewhere. After the marvellous visit there, I get to see other wonders of Agra …\n\nHistory says that Agra Fort was already established by 1,000 AD. Being such an impressive building, not only has it served in effective defence over the centuries, but it also became the grand seat of Indian government several times – making Agra a second capital city at some points.\n\nIn 1556, the Fort was captured by Akbar’s army and he took ownership of it and all its treasure, including the Koh-i-Noor (the world’s largest diamond – 106 carats – it is now part of the British Crown Jewels). The Fort was in ruins after the conflict, so Akbar had it rebuilt – by 4,000 builders, who worked with the Rajasthani red sandstone every day for eight years until it was completed.\n\nA few years later, Akbar’s grandson Shah Jahan was the ruling Emperor. He preferred constructions of white marble, often inlaid with gold or semi-precious gems (think Taj Mahal), and he decided to make some improvements to the Fort. In a departure from family trends, he destroyed some earlier buildings of the Fort to introduce his own style and there are several beautiful rooms of this design in the Fort. A great example is the Suman Burj.\n\nShah Jahan’s rule of the Empire lasted for 30 years. After Mumtaz’ death the children grew to adults and their third son, Aurangzeb, became an ambitious and treacherous man. He betrayed his two older brothers and was announced Emperor in 1658.\n\nSoon after this, he confined his frail father to Agra Fort under house-arrest. Aurangzeb told the public he had imprisoned his father to stop him spending more money on building a second mausoleum for himself on the other side of the river. Shah Jahan had planned this in black marble – to be joined to Mumtaz’s Taj by a bridge over the holy river.\n\nShah Jahan spent the next six years here – without ever leaving the Fort or appearing in public again.\n\nLegend has it that he would stand at the window of his rooms in Suman Burj, every day. He would gaze for hours upon Taj Mahal and weep for his Mumtaz. It was here that he finally died, with the view of the Taj in sight and images of Mumtaz in his mind.\n\nThis is such a sad tale. The whole area resonates with the story, the beauty and the mystery of this love story.\n\nThe area of Agra Fort has other buildings to view. In 1857, it was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion, which caused the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain.\n\nThe gardens here are beautifully manicured. As is often the case around Rajasthan, feral monkeys are populous at this site – to see them is common and I can see them everywhere here. They crawl along the sandstone ledges and eat berries and morsels they’ve sneaked from the trees.\n\nA very unusual and pretty variegated hibiscus grows in the garden here too – I’ve never seen one quite like it. Signs everywhere warn visitors not to walk in the gardens, or leave their litter behind – much like any other tourist spot really.\n\nBack at my hotel, I cross the road to explore a small Park opposite. I find a statue of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. He led the Indian Independence Movement under instruction from Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from independence in 1947 until his death in 1964. Considered the architect of the modern Indian nation-state, he was also the father of Indira Gandhi, third Prime Minister of India. She was the first woman to achieve this post, elected in 1965; and after her assassination in 1984 her son Rajiv became Prime Minister – he was assassinated in 1991.\n\nI return to Kalakriti Theatre (the site of the show last night) once again, this time to watch craftsmen actually making the pieces with special marble inlay. Ah yes, this explains why the Theatre lobby was so adorned with marble items last evening. These are crafted with such precision. Each item of marble is decorated with precious stones, each one inlaid separately by hand.\n\nThey use malachite, lapis, turquoise, jade, mother-of-pearl, abalone (paua shell) and several others. The designs are wide ranging, mostly on white marble background (but sometimes on black) and they are exquisite. The range of articles is broad – from tiny pieces for a dressing table, to large furniture – tables, screens and sculptures. They are mostly solid marble, heavy but beautiful work.\n\nBut … this is also a commercial trade and the pieces are available to buy. Many staff, other than the craftsmen, are at work here and they focus on making sales. They are persistent – to the point of irritation – so I must be quite assertive (read: blunt) with some to make sure they understand … so – if I DO want to buy, I’ll let you know, okay?\n\nI view all the artefacts and select a small piece to buy – a tiny table-top inlaid with coral and malachite, similar to the design on the beautiful Taj Mahal. I like it a lot and it can be transported to Australia for me, that’s marvellous. It should arrive in about six weeks. That is one thing I know for sure when I transact with the Indian merchants I visit – they are true to their word. If they say they’ll ship it to me, they do. Things arrive as they say they will – they use well known global courier services and they are reliable.\n\nBack at my hotel, I notice another traveller sitting with the Astrologer … later I see her and ask if she is happy with her reading …. she starts laughing.\n\n“Ha!” she shrieks “… my two friends and I all went to see him … he told every one of us the same thing … what a joke!”\n\nOh no!! My heart sinks – can this be true? … I’ve been tricked … I knew it!!\n\nBut he said so much about me that was true … have I? … HAVE I?\n\nOh – I’ve paid him to write it down for me too … oh, what a silly girl!!\n\nI ask her more …\n\nDid she give all her birth details? Did he spend time getting a chart together? – She says she didn’t know some of it, so she couldn’t tell him – so he couldn’t do a proper chart for her … it was just a very basic reading.\n\nRelief …. that explains it – …. no I wasn’t tricked after all. I can’t wait to see what the full report says ….\n\nI’m exhausted from the ups and downs of the day … so I’m off to settle down for the evening now – to refresh for something new tomorrow."
