        "text": "The fourth Mughal emperor, who ruled the empire for twenty-two years, was Jahangir. He was a prince that was born with a golden spoon in his mouth; the first surviving child of Emperor Akbar had already made him his father’s favorite. Unfortunately, he had a bitter relationship with his father, who he revolted against several times. However, the father and son were able to reconcile their differences during Akbar’s later reign. Jahangir’s life was haunted by vices that would make him unfit to rule though: opium and drink. He was also a patron of the arts, especially of painting.\n\nGolden Beginnings\n\nEmperor Jahangir was born on August 31, 1569, to Akbar and his Rajput wife, Marium-uz-Zamani. His birth was an auspicious event in Akbar’s life; he had several children who had died in different stages of infancy. Jahangir was the first son to survive. Akbar named him Salim, after the Chishti Shaykh. Akbar was so excited about the birth of Salim that he built the city of Fatehpur Sikri.\n\nGrowing up, Salim and his brothers were provided with a comfortable upbringing, which led them to develop habits that would hinder them in the future. Salim had developed a liking for drink, opium, and women. He had a demonic temper coupled with a streak of cruelty, which caused a rift between father and son.\n\nAs Bamber Gascoigne writes:\n\n“Akbar seems to have been intensely irritated by his eldest son, often it must be admitted with good reason—as when Salim executed three offenders with particularly whimsical and sadistic devices, or when he continually declined the command of expeditions to distant parts of the empire, seeming determined to remain near enough the centre to be strongly placed when his father died.”\n\nAkbar soon started to prefer his other sons to Salim. However, Abul Fazl claims that not all the blame lies with the son, as Akbar has a hand in it as well. Abul Fazl recalls:\n\n“…on the journey to Kashmir in 1589, Salim had been told to bring the harem forward to join Akbar, but he decided that the road was too dangerous and so came on alone. Akbar’s response was on the verge of hysterical. He refused to see the prince and laid hectic plans to ride all through the night, almost unaccompanied, over the admittedly perilous path to fetch the ladies himself.”\n\nRevolts\n\nIn 1599, Akbar was struck by tragedy, when his son Murad passed away, caused by his addiction to alcohol. Salim began to revolt against Akbar, making trouble by declaring himself emperor.\n\nGascoigne writes:\n\n“Compared to the rebellions by Moghul princes later in the seventeenth century this was a very low-key affair and can be more accurately described as Salim mooning about the country with a large army and vaguely referring to himself as emperor while disobeying Akbar’s orders to put his troops to any more effective use. Both father and son were careful to avoid any irretrievable step, and even when Salim marched in 1602 from Allahabad towards Agra with the force of thirty thousand men Akbar was able to talk him back into obedience without an open clash.”\n\nIn 1603, Hamida, Akbar’s mother, was able to bring about a reconciliation between the two. She was instrumental in helping them repair the rift. It could not have come at a better time because in March 1605, Akbar’s son Daniyal died as a result of alcoholism. Before his own death, Akbar placed his turban on Salim, confirming his position as successor to the Mughal throne.\n\nEmperor\n\nPrince Salim had inherited a rich and stable empire from his father, and upon ascending the throne he adopted the name Nur-ud-din Jahangir, which means ‘seizer of the world’. Unlike his father, Jahangir wasn’t interested in political and administrative affairs. Although a patron of the arts, he chose to indulge his time and energies in wine, women, songs, and drugs.\n\nSoon after his ascension, Jahangir faced his first challenge, in the form of his eldest son - Khusrau’s rebellion. The rebellion was put down and Khusrau fled to Delhi, with his father’s forces still in pursuit. After the capture and punishment of his son and allies, Jahangir turned his affections towards another son, Khurram (the future emperor Shah Jahan). During his reign there were regular uprisings that required his attention. Jahangir’s life took a turn in 1611 when he married the widow, Mehr-un-Nisa, upon whom he conferred the title of Nur Jahan. Even though he had 20 wives, Nur Jahan would remain his favorite until the end of his life.\n\nAnnemarie Schimmel writes:\n\n“The fact that Jahangir was able to live a life of luxury and devote himself almost exclusively to art and science, concerning himself very little with matters of government, was thanks to his wife Nur Jahan.”\n\nNur Jahan was an intelligent woman, who began handling the affairs of the country from the shadows. This brought her into direct conflict with Prince Khurram, who believed that Nur Jahan was using her influence to garner favor for her family members. In the beginning Nur Jahan had supported Shah Jahan’s claim to the throne; however, she shifted her support to Shahriyar.\n\nAs Jahangir became even more dependent upon drugs and drinking, he receded from public life and the functioning of the court was in large part due to Nur Jahan. Jahangir’s health began to deteriorate as time went on. He suffered greatly when Khurram rebelled, becoming disobedient after his victory against Malik Amber. Like Babur, Jahangir used to chronicle all the events of his life and it is in his diary that for the first time he refers to his beloved son, as bi-Daulat (the wretch). Khurram went on the run when his rebellion failed.\n\nDeath\n\nAs Jahangir’s health deteriorated, he began visiting places like Kashmir and Kabul that were supposed to help restore health. While Jahangir was camped by the River Jhelum, with his wife Nur Jahan by his side, his second son, Parviz surrounded the camp. Nur Jahan fled the camp and organized reinforcements, leading to a successful retrieval of her husband.\n\nAfter visiting Kashmir, Jahangir decided to return to Lahore, but unfortunately, he would never complete the journey. Emperor Jahangir passed away on the October 28, 1627, at the age of 57. There had been no really significant political or military developments during his reign. He had not expanded the empire beyond the boundaries established by Akbar.\n\nWhat do you think of Emperor Jahangir? Let us know below.\n\nNow, you can read Khadija’s article on “The Fascinating History of Lahore Fort in Pakistan” here.\n\nEarly life\n\nAkbar was born in Umarkot on October 15, 1542, to Emperor Humayun and his young wife, Hamida. Humayun had been on the run, therefore it seems likely that Akbar had a very unsettled early life. In 1553, at the age of ten, Akbar accompanied his father into battle, where he had been given the leadership of his dead uncle Hindal’s followers. In 1555, Akbar was with the advanced guard. However, perhaps Akbar’s early exposure to this violent side of royal life may have had a great impact upon his personality, making him stronger to face the numerous challenges that he would face in life.\n\nAkbar’s world was shaken when in February 1556, Humayun slipped on the stairs and died. Two months prior to his death, Humayun had appointed Bairam Khan as the guardian of his twelve-year-old son, Akbar. Not yet thirteen, Akbar was thrust into the limelight and quickly proclaimed as the next Emperor of the Mughal throne. As a child emperor, Akbar faced many threats not just from three Afghan rulers but also from a Hindu named Hemu. Akbar found protection in the form of Bairam Khan, who guided him during this difficult time - especially when in October 1556, Hemu marched upon Delhi defeating the Mughal forces that had been stationed there. Despite Hemu’s superior forces, Akbar and Bairam Khan didn’t run; instead they decided to face off against their enemy.\n\nPower\n\nBoth armies met on the field of Panipat, where years earlier Babur had won a victory against the Indian princes. 1556 would prove auspicious for the Mughal forces because they won when an arrow pierced Hemu’s eye causing him to faint bringing the battle to an end. Within eighteen months of his accession, the three most serious threats to his throne – Hemu, Sikander Shah and Adil Shah - had all been removed. A result of these constant fights was that he became someone who neglected his studies. Therefore, in a royal family which prized learning more than most, Akbar remained illiterate.\n\nBamber Gascoigne believes that the truth may have been different. He claims that “Akbar as a boy had learnt the rudiments of reading and writing, but preferred not to use them—perhaps originally from choice, and later because to read and write badly was worse than not doing so at all”.\n\nAs Akbar grew older, Bairam Khan had continued to run the affairs of state very efficiently. He kept firm control of the center and continually sent out expeditions to enlarge the frontiers of the kingdom. However, Bairam’s rule came to a halt in 1560 when Maham Anga (Akbar’s wet-nurse) and her son, Adham Khan, tricked Akbar into travelling to Delhi without his guardian, Bairam Khan. They took this opportunity to turn Akbar against his guardian. Akbar, who was now seventeen, felt he was ready to take more personal control of the empire’s affairs. Therefore, Akbar suggested Bairam Khan take a pilgrimage to Mecca — this was the Mughal way of ostracism.\n\nBairam could have gathered his forces and marched against the young ruler, but loyalty prevented him from taking any sort of action. Unfortunately, on the way, Bairam was murdered by an Afghan, who wanted to take revenge for the death of his father. Akbar believed that he had the power now, but the power held by Bairam had been passed to Maham Anga, who tried to manipulate the young monarch. She soon discovered that she couldn’t have the same amount of absolute control because Akbar now wanted to come into his own.\n\nBetrayal\n\nWith Bairam Khan gone, Akbar needed another general to lead his army. He gave command to Adham Khan, who was sent to invade and capture Malwa, ruled by Baz Bahadur. The ruler of Malwa had a reputation as a musician and had a harem filled with beautiful women. Unfortunately, he proved to be less impressive as a general when he lost to the Mughal Army. Adham won a grand victory against the enemy; however, it was during this expedition that his behavior changed. It was tradition that the victorious general had to send the captives and treasures to the Emperor, but Adham only sent a few elephants while keeping the rest of the goods for himself.\n\nOther offences were committed by Adham Khan and his fellow commander when they gathered the older women of Baz Bahadur’s harem and butchered them. When other Muslim companions protested their actions they too were massacred. When news of Adham’s actions reached Agra, Akbar was outraged. Taking matters into his own hands, he marched to Malwa with a small entourage. Akbar spent a few days clearing all the matters that had taken place, but the ultimate result was that Adham Khan was forgiven. This would prove to be troublesome later.\n\nUpon returning to Agra, Akbar wanted to ensure that the power that was being held by Maham Anga and her party would be reduced. Thus, in 1561 Akbar appointed Atkah Khan, who had been summoned from Kabul, as chief minister. This change did not sit well with the opposition, who saw their power slipping through their fingers. Therefore, after a few months, Adham Khan burst into the offices of the chief minister, which were next to the harem. Adham and his men assassinated Atkah Khan and then set their sights on the harem. Fortunately, the eunuch guarding the harem locked the door.\n\nAs this was happening, Akbar made his way into the office of the minister, where he was met by the gruesome scene. Gascoigne writes: “… Akbar emerged from another door to confront the assassin. Adham laid his hand on Akbar’s arm in an ambiguous gesture, which might have been either supplication or assault, whereupon Akbar punched him in the face. It was boasted later that the mark looked as though it had been a blow from a mace; at any rate it knocked him unconscious.”\n\nAkbar then ordered the unconscious Adham to be thrown off the parapet. He barely survived from the fall, so Akbar ordered that he be taken back up the stairs and dropped again. This time the fall proved to be fatal. Akbar took it upon himself to inform Maham Anga that her son was dead. Even though Akbar had pardoned Maham Anga, she died several weeks later from grief. Akbar was finally free of all influences, free of all the people who wanted to use him as a stepping-stone to power. Now nineteen years old, Akbar was coming into his own. In his rule he will prove why he was the greatest of the Mughal rulers.\n\nWhat do you think of Akbar’s early life? Let us know below.\n\nNow, you can read Khadija’s article on “The Fascinating History of Lahore Fort in Pakistan” here."
