        "text": "Agra is one of the most popular cities in Uttar Pradesh, famous for its Mughal-era architecture. Taj Mahal attracts tourists from all over the world, boosting the city’s tourism and making it one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nLike every other major city in India, Agra has a Passport Seva Kendra to help its citizens complete their passport applications without needing to go to Ghaziabad’s Regional Passport office.\n\nThe PSK Agra serves major functions which aid in completing the application process with ease. So, if you reside in Agra and want to renew your passport or apply for a fresh one, this blog will guide you through its entire process, including online and offline form filling. Read to learn more about it.\n\nSince the passport office in Agra comes under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad city, the city does not have a regional passport office in Agra. The Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) is an extended arm of the Regional Passport Office (RPO) Ghaziabad and is responsible for providing passport related services for the citizens of Agra.\n\nThese are the following functions carried out by the PSK Agra:\n\nAssisting Agra citizens with passport-related queries\n\nAccepting and processing residents’ passport applications\n\nVerifying applicant details\n\nIssuing fresh or renewed passports\n\nConducting police verification\n\nDispatching printed passports\n\nThe Passport Seva in Agra adds convenience for its residents by making all passport-related services available within its jurisdiction.\n\nA passport is one of the most important documents required by every Indian as an identity proof and proof of nationality. It is also one of the important documents needed to travel anywhere in the world for various reasons: travel, business, study, etc.\n\nFollowing is the list of types of passports you can apply for at the Passport Seva in Agra, along with their eligibility criteria:\n\nPassport Type Eligibility Criteria Colour Code Diplomatic Indian Foreign Services Officials Maroon Ordinary Ordinary citizens Blue Official Indian govt. officials White\n\nThe ECR passport, which had an orange colour code, is no longer available and has now been discontinued.\n\nTo ease the process of applying for passports and availing of passport-related services, the government has set up PSKs in almost all districts of India. Similarly, citizens of Agra can approach the city’s PSK for any of the services listed above.\n\nTo start the application process, you have to first fill up the application form, submit it along with the necessary documents, and book an Agra passport office appointment. Once you get an appointment, you can complete the application and submit the documents during the Agra passport office timings.\n\nDepending on the type of application, fresh or renewal, and the number of pages to your passport, the fees for your application will change. Here is a breakdown of fees for your various types of applications:\n\nFor Normal Application Scheme:\n\nType of Service Age Group Fees (in ₹) for 36 Pages Fees (in ₹) for 60 Pages Fresh Passport Below 15 years ₹1,000 - Fresh Passport Between 15 and 18 years ₹1,000 ₹2,000 Fresh Passport Above 18 years ₹1,500 ₹2,000 Reissue Below 15 years ₹1,000 - Reissue Between 15 and 18 years ₹1,500 ₹2,000 Reissue Above 18 years ₹1,500 ₹2,000\n\nFor Tatkaal Application Scheme:\n\nType of Service Age Group Fees (in ₹) for 36 Pages Fees (in ₹) for 60 Pages Fresh Passport Below 15 years of age ₹3,000 - Fresh Passport Between 15 and 18 years ₹3,500 ₹4,000 Fresh Passport Above 18 years ₹3,500 ₹4,000 Reissue Below 15 years ₹3,000 - Reissue Between 15 and 18 years ₹3,500 ₹4,000 Reissue Above 18 years ₹3,500 ₹4,000\n\nFor both types of application schemes, the fee changes if the reason for reissue application is due to loss or damage of passport.

The registration option can be found on the homepage.\n\nFill out all required details on the registration page.\n\nAdd a valid email address and phone number for verification.\n\nVerify your email address via the verification link sent to your email address.\n\nNext, log in to proceed with the application.\n\nProceed by clicking on “Apply for New Passport/Reissue of Passport.”\n\nFill out the form with the required details and documents. Submit the form on the website and upload the supporting documents.\n\nComplete the payment using your preferred mode.\n\nDownload the receipt and keep a printed copy with you. Your receipt contains important details, so it is required for the appointment.\n\nNext, schedule an Agra passport office appointment at the Agra PSK.\n\nGo to the PSK Agra office on the appointment date, along with all the necessary documents and the application receipt.\n\nFor a minor applicant (under 4 years old), carry a passport-sized photograph with dimensions 4.5cm x 3.5 cm clicked against a white background.\n\nComplete the process at the passport office as instructed. Next, a police verification will be conducted to complete the verification process.\n\nAfter the verification goes through, you will receive your passport via courier services.\n\nSteps for Applying for a Passport Offline in Agra\n\nYou can complete the application process by filling out the application form offline as well. These are the steps you need to follow to complete the process:\n\nYou will need to download the form from the official website.\n\nFill out the required information accurately and save the progress.\n\nNext, upload the filled-out form via the appropriate link.\n\nComplete the online payment with your preferred mode and schedule an appointment.\n\nCollect all your necessary documents, visit the PSK Agra on the appointment date and complete the process.\n\nTypically, a fresh passport application via the PSK in Agra takes approximately 30 days to come to your doorstep. On the other hand, a reissued passport takes around 7 days in case a police verification is not needed.\n\nHowever, if you need your passport urgently for certain reasons, you can opt for the passport office’s Tatkal scheme. This allows you to receive your passport within 1-3 working days and can be used for both fresh and renewal passport applications. However, note that the fees for the Tatkal scheme are higher than the Normal scheme.\n\nThe passport application process in Agra has become more convenient since the PSK was established in the city. It has added convenience for its citizens and saved their trips to Ghaziabad to complete their passport formalities.\n\nYou can now apply for a passport via the online application portal and visit the PSK in Agra. The application fees vary depending on the type of application, booklet size, age and application scheme.\n\nSo, if you are applying for a passport, follow the steps listed in this blog and make the best of the services offered by the PSK in Agra.\n\nAlong with the passport, many countries require travel insurance as one of the mandatory documents during visa applications.
