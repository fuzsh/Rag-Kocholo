Only let this one teardrop, the Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time…” — Rabindranath Tagore\n\nWhen you see and hear so much about an attraction like the Taj Mahal, it often doesn’t live up to your expectations. Although that didn’t happen when I finally saw its magnificence up close. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World and is an architectural, engineering, and design masterpiece.\n\nI’m sure that almost everyone who visits India has the Taj Mahal on their must-see list. I know it was on mine as I traveled through the country for three months. I was joined by a friend from Canada who was going to spend a couple of weeks with me.\n\nWe arrived late in the afternoon and got our first peek at the Taj from the other side of the Yamuna River, seeing the white marble dome losing its radiance as the sun started to set."
