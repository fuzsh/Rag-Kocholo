        "text": "2010-2014\n\nPrelude\n\nDuring four visits to India on motorcycle tours, Delhi and Agra became a key focus for add-on sightseeing. Both cities have an impressive array of architecture and other historic reminders from the glory days of the Mughal Empire. In addition, Delhi has an impressive collection of architectural remnants from the Lodi Sultanate (an Afghan dynasty) that preceded the Mughal conquest.\n\nThe stand-out attraction is the Taj Mahal in Agra. That was built by the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan. It was the last great architectural legacy of the Mughal Empire, which started to unravel soon after Shah Jahans reign.\n\nThe first Mughal Emperor, Babur, left his mark on Agra with his contribution to the Agra Fort which he took over on establishing the Mughal Empire in northern India (or Hindustan, as it was called) early in the 16th century (1526).\n\nThe second Mughal Emperor, Humayun, built his capital in Delhi, with the Purana Qila (the Old Fort) as its centrepiece. Humayuns tomb  often seen as the new benchmark for Mughal architecture, with its massive dome  is nearby the Old Fort in Delhi.\n\nThe third Mughal Emperor, Akbar the Great, undertook large-scale restructuring of the Agra Fort and built his new capital near Agra at Fatehpur Sikri, which he abandoned 14 years later.\n\nThe legacy of Shah Jahan (Akbars grandson), however, outstrips his predecessors. Not only did he build the Taj Mahal, but also the Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Delhi as well as the magnificent palaces inside the Agra Fort.\n\nDelhi\n\nLooking back on visits to Delhi, Im a little regretful that I wasnt more strategic or methodical in my approach to its wealth of treasures. It was only on second, third and, in one case, fourth visit that I discovered some of them.\n\nMy first serious foray into the sights of Delhi was with Dylan, my grandson, then 13 years old. This was a prelude to our Nepal/Bhutan tour in December of 2010. At that time, we covered the Mughal legacies of Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Old Delhi; and Humayuns Tomb near the Old Fort (in fact, close to the political centre of New Delhi even though both structures pre-date the current Old Delhi). We also visited the Hindu complex of Akshardham and the National Museum, whose Mughal armoury collection was of great interest to Dylan.\n\nOn my visit in 2012 as part of the Himalaya tour, I spent a day (in about 43ºC) at the Qutb Minar complex, most of a day at the Purana Qila (Old Fort) and several hours at the Museum, this time focussing on the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nIn 2014, with my then 14 year old grandson, Oskar, we visited the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, the Purana Qila, the Qutb Minar complex and the remnants of the Qila Rai Pithora. This visit was in conjunction with out South India tour.\n\nRed Fort\n\nThe Red Fort was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad  the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Its name is derived from its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone. The private apartments inside the walls of the fort consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise).\n\nAccording to the Unesco website, the Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Forts innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.\n\nPhoto Album\n\nHere is the photo album of visits.\n\nAgra\n\nWith Dylan in 2010 and Oskar in 2014, we travelled to Agra on the 6.15am Shantabdi Express. We had a car and guide the whole day to take us to the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort and Fatephur Sikri.\n\nI had initially worried about the expected three or four hours we might have to kill before catching the return train at 8.30pm; but that was an ill-conceived worry. We got back to the station at about 8.00pm, having arrived at 8.30am that morning!\n\nIn 2012, seven of us travelled by mini bus. That reduced the time we had available, which ruled out a visit to Fatephur Sikri  not that I felt the need to revisit Akbars capital, having spent several hours there in 2010 (and made a brief visit in 2007 as part of my Rajasthan tour). But I did instigate a visit to Akbars Tomb in Agra as part of rounding off key Mughal sights or sites.\n\nA Bit about Agra\n\nThough Agra's history is largely associated with the Mughal Empire, it was established long before the Mughals arrived. It is generally accepted that Sultan Sikander Lodi, the Ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, founded Agra in the year 1504. After the Sultan's death the city passed on to his son Sultan Ibrahim Lodi. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell to the first Mughal Emperor Babur in the first Battle of Panipat in 1526.\n\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Babur laid out the first formal Persian garden in Agra on the banks of the river Yamuna. The garden is called the Arām Bāgh or Ram Bagh - the Garden of Relaxation. But it was his grandson the Emperor Akbar who raised the towering ramparts of the Agra Fort.\n\nThe city under the Mughals became known as Akbarabad. Besides making Akbarabad a centre for learning, arts, commerce and religion, Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarabād called Fatehpur Sikri. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\n\nAkbarabād remained the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan later (1649) shifted his capital to Shahjahanabad  what is today the walled city of Old Delhi. Shah Jahan was noted for his construction of several great monuments of the Mughal era (Taj Mahal, the Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Delhi, palaces in the Agra Fort, and many gardens).\n\nShah Jahans son, Aurangzeb, on seizing the throne in 1658, moved the capital back to Akbarabad (Agra). He imprisoned his father in the Agra Fort until the latters death in 1666. Shah Jahans quarters looked out towards the Taj Mahal.\n\nAkbarabād remained the capital of India during the rule of Aurangzeb until he shifted it to Aurangabad in the Deccan in 1653. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and Jats and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nThe Taj Mahal was no less wondrous seeing it for a second or third, even a fourth time. The creation of Shah Jahan as a burial tribute for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, it has a typically Mughal symmetry in and around its precinct, except for the cenotaph of Shah Jahan himself next to his wifes; but that was subsequently added by his son.\n\nThe sight and experience of the Taj Mahal are unique. It has a magnetism and fascination that is likely the equal of no other world monument or natural feature. Its special interior appeal is its beautifully executed marble with intricate and delicate designs of in-laid semi-precious stones.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is perhaps India's most fascinating and beautiful monument. It took over 20 years (16321653) of labour and 20,000 workers, masons and jewellers to build and is set amidst landscaped gardens.\n\nVerses of the Koran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are twenty-two small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Tāj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of 18 m, and rises to a height of 24 m; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated by fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.\n\nWithin the main chamber are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. Their actual tombs are on a lower level under the main floor.\n\nAgra Fort\n\nAgra Fort (sometimes called the Red Fort  not to be confused with the fort in Delhi of the same name), was commissioned by the great Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565. A stone tablet at the gate of the fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar.\n\nThe red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Shah Jahan's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque, the Diwan-e-Am and Diwan-e-Khas (halls of public and private audience), Jahangir's Palace, Khas Mahal, Shish Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.\n\nThe forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 km, and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A 9 m wide and 10 m deep moat surrounds the outer wall.\n\nA heroic equestrian statue of Shivaji has been erected outside the fort. Shivaji Maharaj, was a Maratha sovereign who founded the Maratha Empire, which, at its peak, covered much of the Indian subcontinent. Shivaji led a resistance to free the Maratha people from the Sultanate of Bijapur and the Mughal Empire.\n\nFatehpur Sikri\n\nFatehpur Sikri was another creation of Akbar. It was to be his new capital, located and dedicated in honour of a guru who was attributed to bringing him the blessing of a son and heir. The city took 15 years to build. It was Akbars capital for only 14 years before he made Lahore his capital. It is said he was motivated by a shortage of water at Fatehpur Sikri, but there was also his need to be better located strategically.\n\nIt was abandoned and left to decay. Much of the 11km U-shaped wall still stands, the large lake that bordered the top of the U has long gone, as have most of its buildings; leaving only the royal palace complex and adjacent mosque and tomb of the guru standing. Its all pretty amazing.\n\nThe main buildings include:\n\nThe Jama Masjid (Friday Mosque) with its huge courtyard and monumental Gateway.\n\nThe Tomb of the sufi saint Salim Chishti within the mosque. Fatehpur Sikri was built to honour Salim Chishti, who was attributed with blessing Akbar with a son and heir.\n\nThe Diwan-i-Khas, or Hall of Private Audience, is a plain square building famous for its central pillar, which has a square base and an octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs. Its serpentine brackets support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each corner of the building on the first floor by four stone walkways. It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audiences.\n\nFatehpur Sikri\n\nFatehpur Sikri was another creation of Akbar.

It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audiences.\n\nAkbar's Tomb\n\nIn keeping with Mughal tradition, Akbars Tomb, a little north of Agra, has an enormous gate (large decorated building) thats easy to mistake for the tomb itself until you walk through it and see the more magnificent building of the tomb at the end of an extensive several hundred metre avenue. There were also three other lesser gates on the other three compass points, each of similar distance from the tomb building.\n\nThe Tomb of Akbar the Great is an important Mughal architectural masterpiece, built 1605-1613, set in 48 Ha of grounds in Sikandra, a suburb of Agra.\n\nAkbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. After his death, Akbar's son, Jahangir, completed the construction in 1605-1613.\n\nThe south gate is the largest, with four white marble chhatri-topped minarets which are similar to (and pre-date) those of the Taj Mahal, and is the normal point of entry to the tomb. The tomb itself is surrounded by a walled enclosure 105 m square. The tomb building is a four-tiered pyramid, surmounted by a marble pavilion containing the false tomb. The true tomb, as in other mausoleums, is in the basement.\n\nPhoto Album"
