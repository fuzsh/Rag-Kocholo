        "text": "The complex consists of two buildings, one being the mausoleum and the other a gigantic gate, connected to each other via a wide paved walkway.\n\nThe gate, known as Buland Darwaza (gateway of magnificence) itself consists of a huge archway and four marble minarets. It is more impressive than the mausoleum itself, which is wider but not as overwhelming. The architecture of the mausoleum is very interesting, as is it a good example of the mixture of the use of sandstone together with marble. If you stand too long on the courtyard, you might be harassed by the many monkeys, which can become very aggressive. Inside the mausoleum, you find the cenotaph in a very small, sober room."
