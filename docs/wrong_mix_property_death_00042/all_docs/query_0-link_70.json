        "text": "UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA\n\nI heard the name of Fatehpur Sikri when I just started realizing that I have this body and it has been given a name with which I am called today. Yes, this place is Fatehpur Sikri. I was told about one incident by none other than by my grandfather who was posted as TEHSILDAR at TEHSIL FATEHPUR SIKRI during 1947.\n\nIt was evening of 14th August 1947, when he received a message from LUCKNOW to be on alert as at any time declaration of independence might be announced and there were chances for unrest among the communities. In the morning, everybody knew that country is independent and it was customary and need of the hour to hoist the flag at buildings of importance and Government buildings. But my grand father chose to hoist the Indian Tricolor at BULAND DARWAZA as it was the highest structure of the FATEHPUR SIKRI TEHSIL HEAD QUARTER.\n\nHe had cherished memories of these moments and whenever he was a bit relaxed and found me around he used to share such stories of his service time.\n\nSo, despite having heard so much and curiosity I could not visit this place in the past. I found opportunity to visit this historic place only about three years back.\n\nNestled on the outskirts of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, Fatehpur Sikri stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance of the Mughal era. Built during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the late 16th century, this UNESCO World Heritage Site captivates visitors with its intricate design, rich history, and cultural significance. The grand buildings within Fatehpur Sikri complex showcase a fusion of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles, making it a must-visit destination for history enthusiasts, architecture aficionados, and curious travelers alike.\n\nFATEHPUR SIKRI is very near to city of TAJ, AGRA. It is hardly a 40 minute drive on BIKANER -AGRA ROAD. So, one can reach here by using local transport like Bus, Taxi etc. I reached using my own car. While traveling to SIKRI I could feel, this is the same road where my grand father had driven his car. The roads are certainly in good condition and surroundings are much better now.\n\nSo I reached this famous deserted city, , built by Akbar. It was formerly merely a village, called Sikri, celebrated as the abode of Sheikh Salim Chishti, a Muhammadan pir, or saint. the story and the relevant travelogs written by travelers from west reflects that-In 1564, Akbar, returning from a campaign, halted near the cave in which the saint lived. The twin children of his Rajput wife, Mariam Zamani, had recently died, and he was anxious for an heir. He consulted the holy man, who advised him to come and live at Sikri. The Emperor did so, and nine months afterwards Mariam, who was taken to Chishti’s cell for her confinement, gave birth to a son, afterwards the Emperor Jahangir. He was called Sultan Salim in honor of the saint. Jahangir, who describes all these circumstances in his memoirs, adds : “ My revered father, regarding the village of Sikri, my birthplace, as fortunate to himself, made it his capital, and in the course of fourteen or fifteen years the hills and deserts, which abounded in beasts of prey, became converted into a magnificent city, comprising numerous gardens, elegant edifices and pavilions, and other places of great attraction and beauty. After the conquest of Gujarat, the village was named Fatehpur (the town of victory).”\n\nThe glory of Fatehpur Sikri was short-lived. Akbar held his court there for seventeen years, and then removed it to Agra; some say on account of the bad water supply, others that the saint, disturbed in his devotions by the bustle and gaieties of the great city, declared that either he or Akbar must go. “Then” replied the Emperor, “let it be your servant, I pray.” The entire city was given up to the beasts of the surrounding jungle.\n\nForeign travelers, who visited it in the early part of the next reign, described it : “ Ruin all- lying like a waste desert, and very dangerous to pass through in the night.” This, however, was an exaggeration, for the principal buildings are still in a good state of preservation, probably owing to the remoteness of the place from any great highway or large town.\n\nThe city, which was some six miles in circuit, was surrounded on three sides by high battlemented walls, which had nine gateways. The fourth side was formed by a great artificial lake, now dry. The principal buildings are on the summit of the high ridge which runs throughout the length of the city. Let me take you to every important section of this great city of Great Akbar.\n\nThe Agra Gate — The visitor usually enters by the Agra Gate, concerning which an amusing story is told. One night Akbar, attended by some of his ministers, was inspecting the ramparts near this gate, when he observed a highway robbery being committed close by the walls. Turning severely to those responsible for the peace of the city, he demanded why such an outrage was permitted in the very presence of the Emperor. “ It is always darkest directly under the shadow of the lamp,” was the courtly reply.\n\nThe Naubat Khana (Music House)-in all Mughal buildings its an essential feature ,this place was used by court musicians to announce arrival and departure of Emperor and other ceremonial functions.\n\nThe Mint (TAKSAL) — Some distance beyond the Naubat Khana, on the right, is a large building believed to have been the Imperial Mint. Rare specimens of gold, silver, and copper coins from the Fatehpur Mint are in the British Museum. The brick domes of this building are interesting, as they are probably the earliest example in India of the use of radiating courses instead of horizontal layers in dome (arch) construction.\n\nOpposite to the Mint is a smaller building known as the Treasury (KHAZANA)\n\nThe Daftar Khana (OFFICE OF THE GREAT AKBAR) — Passing through the great quadrangle of the Diwan-i-am, the visitor arrives at the Daftar Khana, or Record Chamber, This was Akbar’s office, and is immediately opposite to his own sanctum, the Khwabgah, and the principal buildings of the Imperial Palace. A staircase in the south-east room leads to the roof, from which a fine view of the city and surrounding country can be obtained.\n\nThe Palace — A door in the side of the quadrangle, opposite to the Daftar Khana, leads into Akbar’s palace, the Mahal-i-Khas. The two-storied building on the left on entering contains Akbar’s private apartments. The first room on the ground floor is paneled into numerous recesses for keeping books, documents, or valuables. There are some remains of painted decoration representing flowers, such as the tulip, poppy, and almond flower, executed with much vigor and technical skill. Behind this is a chamber which, according to Edmund Smith, was used by a Hindu priest attached to Akbar’s court. It contains a stone platform raised on pillars, upon which he is said to have performed his devotions. It was more probably intended for Akbar’s own gaddi, or throne. A door in the west wall leads into the cloisters, which formerly connected Akbar’s apartments with the Daftar Khaana and with Jodh Bai’s palace.\n\nThe Khwabgah, or sleeping apartment — is a small pavilion on the roof. Originally the walls were entirely covered by fresco paintings, but only a few fragments now remain. Unfortunately, these have been protected by a coat of varnish, which reduces them all to a dull monochrome. It is to be regretted that a more scientific method of preserving them was not adopted. They are all in the Persian style, and, except for the Chinese element which is often, present in Persian art, there is no ground fori Edmund Smith’s supposition that Chinese artists! were employed here.\n\nOn the side window over the eastern doorway is a painting of a winged figure, in front of a rock cave, supporting a new-born babe in its arms. In all probability it refers to the birth of Jahangir in the cell of the Saint Salim Chishti, which Akbar, no doubt, thought miraculous. Many archaeologists make the great mistake of attributing every winged figure in these decorations to some Biblical story, Heavenly beings with wings, the inhabitants of Paradise, spirits of the air, or “ angels” are very common in Persian and Indian painting are by no means a monopoly of European artists.\n\nIt is known that Akbar took a great interest in painting. Abul Fazl, in the “Ain-i-Akbari,” states that “His Majesty from the earliest youth has shown a great predilection for the art, and gives it every encouragement, as he looks upon it as a means both of study and amusement. Hence the art flourishes, and many painters have obtained great reputations. The works of all painters are weekly laid before his Majesty by the Daroghas and the clerks ; he confers rewards according to the excellence of workmanship, or increases their monthly salaries. Much progress was made in the commodities required by painters, and the correct prices of such articles were carefully ascertained.”\n\nAkbar himself remarked, “ Bigoted followers of the law are hostile to the art of painting, but their eyes now see the truth. There are many that hate painting, but such men I dislike. It appears to me as if a painter had a peculiar means of recognizing God, for a painter, in sketching anything that has life and in drawing its limbs, must feel that he cannot bestow personality upon his work, and is thus forced to think of God, the giver of life, and will thus increase his knowledge.” The enlightened court of Akbar was evidently a paradise for artists.\n\nOpposite to Akbar’s apartments is a large square tank with a platform in the center, approached by four narrow stone paths. The tank was filled from the waterworks near the Elephant Gate, and the water was kept constantly fresh by an overflow channel connecting with the tank at the back of the Diwan-i-Khas.\n\nThe Turkish Sultana’s House — In the northeast angle of the Mahal-i-Khas quadrangle is a small, picturesque building, one of the gems of Fatehpur, called the Turkish Sultana’s House. It contains only a single apartment, surrounded by a verandah, but in the carving of every surface within and without there is a wealth of invention and decorative skill rarely achieved even by the Mogul artists. The dado panels are especially remarkable for the charming conventionalized rendering of trees, flowers, birds, and animals. They have suffered much from the hands of some of Aurangzib’s fanatical followers, and all the representations of animate nature have been mutilated. The carving was intended as a groundwork for painting and gilding which were never added, for the Fatehpur Palace was abandoned even before it was finished. Nothing is known with certainty of the lady who inhabited this delightful bower, but she must have been one of Akbar’s favorites.\n\n( to be contd.)"
