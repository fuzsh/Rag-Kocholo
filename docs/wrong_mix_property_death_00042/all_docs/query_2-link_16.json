Read less\n\nA newly completed white marble structure in Agra, which took over a century to build, is now drawing a substantial number of visitors. Many of these visitors often compare the iconic Taj Mahal with this recently constructed mausoleum of the Radha Soami sect's founder in Soami Bagh, located about 12 kilometers from the Taj Mahal. This pristine white marble edifice has become a popular attraction for tourists exploring Agra, leaving many in awe of its grandeur. It is being considered a worthy rival to the Taj Mahal, enhancing the architectural splendor of a city renowned for its Mughal-era monuments.\n\nIn contrast to the Taj Mahal, which was completed within 22 years by the labour of numerous skilled artisans and craftsmen under a mediaeval authoritarian regime during the 17th century, the construction of the Soami Bagh mausoleum extended over a century within an open society. Pramod Kumar, an ardent follower of the faith, added that the construction of the mausoleum serves as an example of their unwavering faith, fervour, and dedication of its creators, who were motivated by their religious beliefs.\n\nRead more: Most scenic train rides in North India\n\nResting on a foundation of 52 wells, the towering 193-foot structure, entirely crafted from white marble sourced from Makrana in Rajasthan, stands as one of India's most ambitious undertakings.\n\nDedicated to the founder of the Radha Soami faith, Param Purush Pooran Dhani Swamiji Maharaj, the grand mausoleum is situated in the Soami Bagh colony in Agra's Dayalbagh area. Each day, huge number of tourists visit the mausoleum. While the entrance is free, photography is not permitted.\n\nIf reports are to go by, some minor additions are yet to be made to the mausoleum. Visitors can still see craftsmen engaged in their work. \"Now, of course, we have huge grinders, cutters, finishers, lorries, lifters, and all kinds of machines and computer technology, all of which were employed to advantage here, and the results show,\" an official connected with the project said.\n\nVisitors have already started to draw comparisons between the Soami Bagh mausoleum and the globally renowned Taj Mahal, which attracts thousands of tourists from around the globe each day. The Taj Mahal is home to the mausoleum of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Officials overseeing the construction said, \"It represents a form of worship that has persisted and will continue tirelessly.\"\n\nThe Soami Bagh mausoleum is situated within a community of adherents to the Radha Soami faith, which boasts millions of followers across states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka, as well as in various foreign nations.\n\nRead more: Meghalaya's summer marvels: 9 must-visit attractions\n\nThe original samadh was a basic white sandstone structure. Construction on a new design by an architect from Allahabad began in 1904. Despite delays, men have been working tirelessly since 1922, primarily by hand, on the expansive and intricately adorned construction. Artisans, some of whom have spent their entire lives on the site, continue the tradition passed down through generations. While modern machinery aids their work, their craftsmanship remains meticulous.\n\nThe building's architectural design is not bound by any specific style, whether modern or traditional, although its conception leans towards oriental influences. There's a concerted effort to seamlessly blend various styles. Nevertheless, the sponsors of Soami Bagh, dubbed the 'garden of the Lord,' vehemently deny any intention to rival the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe 31.4-foot gold-plated pinnacle, taller than that of the Taj Mahal, required years of effort and a crane from Delhi for installation due to challenges in sourcing marble. Most marble comes from Makrana and Jodhpur, with mosaic stone from Nowshera, Pakistan, and semi-precious stones from Indian riverbeds. Despite leasing quarries in Mount Abu and Udaipur, acquiring high-quality marble posed difficulties, compounded by labour shortages as skilled masons migrated to Gulf countries. While the Taj Mahal remains a top tourist choice for its grandeur, spiritually inclined individuals find solace in Soami Bagh, prompting comparisons with the Taj Mahal in Agra.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
