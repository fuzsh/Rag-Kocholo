        "text": "History of Agra Fort\n\nAgra is a city in Uttar Pradesh, which is renowned for the architectural marvels built by several Mughal emperors in the olden times. One of them is Agra Fort, a majestic fort constructed by Akbar. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty till 1638.\n\nIt has a massive fort with a colorful and beautiful garden known as Angoori Bagh. The visitors are allowed to enter through a gate named Amar Singh Gate, which is on the southern side of the fort. The beauty of Angoori Bagh is breathtaking. It is a garden where the Mughals used to grow grapes, which were used to make wine. In front of the Angoori Bagh stands a graceful marble hall. We saw the Diwan-i-Aam, which is a hall where the king used to listen to the grievances of the common people. Next, we went to Diwan-i-Khas.\n\nIt has one of the most beautiful thrones in Indian history called the Peacock Throne. The emperor used this hall to meet his special guests. We also saw Nagina Masjid and Mina Masjid inside the fort complex. They were built by Shah Jahan. It is said that the Nagina Masjid was used for the personal use of the emperor while Mina Masjid was meant for use by both the emperor and the royal ladies.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Agra Fort is a big and beautiful palace with a lot of historical background. Its architecture reflects the amount of hard work and dedication that has been put into its construction.\n\nWriten By Janya Kaur Chugh, Prann Mishra & Tanisha Mohan (Springdales School, Pusa Road, New Delhi).\n\n__\n\nEdTerra Edventures conducts various other programs for the youth.
