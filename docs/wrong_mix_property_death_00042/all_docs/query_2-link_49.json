        "text": "Visiting one of the seven wonders of the world is simple right? You just stroll through the main gates, get in line and wait to enter? Not so fast! There are actually three gateways situated around the Taj Complex that offer entryway to the site. Though the prices are the same, not all gates are created equal and there are a few things to consider before you go.\n\nThe Western Gate\n\nThe western gate is the main entrance to the Taj Mahal facing out to Agra city. It may seem as though this gate is the most convenient in terms of accessibility, however it is also the most popular and queues here are typically much longer than at the eastern or southern gates. Try to arrive at the Taj early in the morning, or ready for sunset if using this gate. Locals predominantly use this gate.\n\nThe Eastern Gate\n\nOn most days, the eastern gate is a good entry point to use for the Taj Mahal as it is generally much less busy compared to the western and southern gates. This gate faces out towards Fatehabad and is a convenient entry point for tourists as it is the gate closest to many of Agra’s main hotels.\n\nThe Southern Gate\n\nThe southern entrance is the least used gate for accessing the Taj Mahal. It is surrounded by a busy market where you are likely to get pestered by toots, however it is arguably the best option for independent travelers or those staying in the nearby low-cost hotels. The only unfortunate thing about this gate is that it does not open until 8am so if you are hoping to be at the Taj for tourist-free photos as soon as it opens, this is not the gate to choose.\n\nAt first glance, the Taj Mahal may simply appear as though it is just one building. However, upon arrival at the majestic whitewashed site, travelers will note that there are several notable attractions that make up the Taj complex.\n\nThe main attractions of the Taj Mahal are the stunning and expansive gardens that encapsulate the mausoleum, the Lady Diana chair, and the interiors of the Taj complex itself. There is also an informative museum located on the complex, and a few additional buildings that are worth exploring (the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal’s grandfather, the mosque, and the assembly hall).\n\n1. The Ornate Gateway to the Taj\n\nIt may seem obscure to list a gateway as one of the Taj Mahal’s major attractions, however the Taj’s main entryway “The Royal Gate”, also called Darwaza-e-rauza is so picturesque and ornately decorated that it is an architectural masterpiece, and a perfect place for travel photography in itself. Tourists entering from the eastern, western, and southern gate reach this epic gateway from where the first glimpse of the Taj Mahal is possible. The main gateway exists in the form of an octagonal hall with elaborate gates on either side.\n\n2. The Mehtab Bagh Gardens\n\nCommonly referred to as the “moonlight gardens”, the Mehtab Bagh gardens are stunning and expansive lawns and gardens filled with pastel colored flowers, fragrant rose bushes and lush greenery. Located across the river from the Taj Mahal, the particular draw of the gardens is the incredible view of the Taj and photo opportunity that they offer, particularly as the sun begins to set.\n\n3. The Gardens of the Taj Mahal & The Lady Diana Chair\n\nUpon arrival, make a beeline for the Lady Diana chair — the classic spot where Princess Diana sat during her visit to India in 1992 and the perfect place for a photo opportunity. As the day progresses, lines to sit here become incredibly long so you may want to boycott this if arriving later in the day. Enjoy exploring the expansive fragrant gardens that encompass the Taj and taking photos amid their perfect symmetry.\n\n4. The Mausoleum\n\nUpon venturing inside the Taj, it feels as though the chaos of Agra has suddenly been replaced with the peace and serenity of the monument. The interiors of the mausoleum are exquisite, with elaborate tapestries, rich decorations and marble cenotaphs dedicated to Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. You will have to line up once more to enter the mausoleum, which is another reason why you should arrive as early as possible. The memorials that you see are actually decorative ones. The real crypts are situated below the surface and away from the tourists.\n\n5. The Museum\n\nThere is a mosque, an assembly hall, and a museum situated close to the mausoleum entrance. The museum is an interesting place to visit and provides a fascinating insight into the history of the Taj, as well as displaying the original construction plans for its creation.\n\n6. The Baby Taj\n\nAcross the river from the Taj, encapsulated by the beautiful Mehtab Bagh gardens, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal’s grandfather, Mirza Ghiyas Beg also known as I’timad-ud-Daulah awaits. Often referred to as being the “baby Taj Mahal”, it is thought to have been regarded as a draft for the full-size Taj. With whitewashed walls there are some similarities between the Taj Mahal and the Baby Taj, however with its elegant marble lattice screens and jewel box structure, the Baby Taj possesses a unique look.\n\nA Taj Mahal tour is an amazing experience. And although you might want to visit it time and again and maybe you will, it is important to ensure that you make the most of your visit at the moment.\n\nArrive Early\n\nThe Taj opens at 6:00 and you should get there early if you want to avoid the crowds. Whether you need to make it to the Taj for the very first thing in the morning depends on whether you are set on capturing some great photos without tourist hordes in the back of them, or you don’t mind the hustle and bustle. You will often find that people are queueing to enter the Taj as much as 30 minutes before it even opens. After 10:00, hundreds of tour buses pull up to the site making waiting in line and getting around a little stressful.\n\nKnow the Rules\n\nAs is likely to be expected for visiting a place of burial, there are some rules to adhere to when visiting the Taj Mahal. The rules and restricted items at the Taj have been listed below in the next segment. One of them to really remember is that photography is strictly prohibited inside the mausoleum so it’s better to take all the photos you wish to take now. Not to mention, once you come out again, it’s likely there will be more tourists!\n\nCapture the Best Shots!\n\nFor incredible pictures of the sunset over the Taj Mahal, cross the river towards the “Baby Taj”. Explore the tomb and the restored Mehtab Bagh gardens, and watch the sun disappear behind the clouds and the majestic backdrop of the Taj Mahal.\n\nYou can get to the Taj Mahal via bus, train, or by hiring a private driver. Public transportation in India is often overcrowded, prone to rescheduling, and unorganized. Be sure to arrive at the stations early and pack some reading material and snacks in case of a delay.\n\nBy Train\n\nYou can reach the Taj Mahal by train from New Delhi or Varanasi. From New Delhi, trains for Agra depart almost hourly. From Varanasi, the train services are less frequent, with only one train leaving per day. It is important to note that there are actually two train stations in Agra — Agra Cantt and Agra Fort stations. For the Taj Mahal, the most convenient station to disembark at is the Agra Fort station.\n\nBy Bus\n\nVarious transportation providers offer frequent bus services to Agra from numerous different starting points around India (including Delhi and Varanasi).\n\nYou can also fly in from different cities in India to Agra. Either ways, you will need to hire local transportation like bus, tempo, rickshaw, or taxi to get to the vicinity of Taj Mahal. You will also find prepaid taxis and autorickshaws at the rail station which is a more reliable but perhaps a bit costly option. Since diesel and petrol vehicles are not allowed inside 500 meter radius of the Taj, you might have to change to eco-friendly vehicles such as cycle rickshaw, horse-driven tongas, etc to reach the entry points.\n\nTaj Mahal Tour Packages\n\nSince getting to and around the Taj Mahal can be hectic, you could consider booking a place of one of the many Taj Mahal tour packages that operate to and from the site each day. This takes some of the stress out of organizing your Taj Mahal visit. It is advisable to organize this with a reputable provider in advance, since there are many touts posing as tour guides at the site.\n\nTaj Mahal holiday services are sold by many companies in Delhi and Agra."
