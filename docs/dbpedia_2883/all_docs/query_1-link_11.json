        "text": "Magnetic levitation is the first truly new transportation technology in one hundred years and comes at a time when advances in transportation are urgently needed. The German Transrapid magnetic levitation train is the first such commercially available system. Based on technology that originated in the United States, it has been under development for approximately fifteen years in Germany. While not yet in commercial operation, tests on the Transrapid indicate that the system can provide better service to passengers than conventional rail, both in terms of speed and comfort. And comparisons of environmental impacts show that the Transrapid compares favorably with other modes of transport. The article points out doubts that remain about costs and revenues and about the effects of electromagnetic fields.\n\nAvailability:\n\nFind a library where document is available.
