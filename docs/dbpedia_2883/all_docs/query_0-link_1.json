        "text": "[http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/transportstrategy/eddingtonstudy/ Eddington Report] ] refer to recent developments of railway and other competing technologies and draw parallels between Transrapid and previous high technology hypes without broad market impact outside niche applications.\n\nTechnology\n\n:\"See also: Technology in the Magnetic levitation train article.\"\n\nThe synchronous longstator linear motor of the Transrapid maglev system is used both for propulsion and braking. It functions like a rotating electric motor whose stator is cut open and stretched lengthways along the underside of the guideway. Inside the motor windings, alternating current generates a magnetic traveling field which moves the vehicle without contact. The support magnets in the vehicle function as the excitation portion (rotor). The respective magnetic traveling field works in only one direction, and therefore makes moving train collisions less likely; if there were several trains on the track section, they would travel in the same direction.\n\nThe superspeed maglev system has no wheels, axles, transmissions, or pantographs. It does not roll, it hovers. Electronic systems guarantee that the clearance remains constant (nominally 10 mm). The Transrapid requires less power to hover than is used by its air conditioning equipment. The levitation system and all on board electronics are supplied by the power recovered from harmonic oscillations of magnetic field of the track’s linear stator (those oscillations being parasitic cannot be used for propulsion) at speeds above 80 km/h, while at lower speeds power is obtained through physical connections to the track. In case of power failure of the track’s propulsion system, the Transrapid car can use on-board backup batteries to power the levitation system.\n\nEnergy requirements\n\nThe normal energy consumption of the Transrapid is approximately 50–100 kW per section for levitation and travel, and vehicle control. The drag coefficient of the Transrapid is about 0.26. The air resistance of the vehicle, which has a frontal cross section of 16 m², requires a power consumption, at 400 km/h (111 m/s) cruising speed, given by the following formula:\n\nP = c_w cdot A_{ m Front} cdot v^3 cdot (mbox{density of surrounding air})/2egin{matrix}P &=& 0{.}26 cdot 16,mathrm{m}^2 cdot (111,mathrm{m}/mathrm{s})^3 cdot 1{.}24,mathrm{kg}/mathrm{m}^3 /2 \\\\P &=& 3{.}53cdot10^6,mathrm{kg}cdotmathrm{m}^2/mathrm{s}^3 = 3{.}53cdot10^6,mathrm{N}cdotmathrm{m}/mathrm{s} = 3{.}53,mathrm{MW}end{matrix}\n\nPower consumption compares favorably with other high-speed rail systems. With an efficiency of 0.85, the power required is about 4.2 MW. Energy consumption for levitation and guidance purposes equates to approximately 1.7 kW/t. As the propulsion system is also capable of functioning in reverse, energy is transferred back into the electricity network during braking. An exception to this is when an emergency stop is performed using the emergency landing skids beneath the vehicle, although this method of bringing the vehicle to a stop is intended only as a last resort should it be impossible or undesirable to keep the vehicle levitating on back-up power to a natural halt.\n\nMarket segment, ecological impact and historical parallels\n\nCompared to classical railway lines, Transrapid allows higher speeds and gradients with lower wear and tear and even lower energy consumption and maintenance needs. The Transrapid track is more flexible adapted to specific geographical circumstances than a classical train system. Cargo is restricted to a maximum payload of 15 metric tonnes per car. Transrapids allows maximum speeds of 550 km/h, placing it between conventional High Speed Trains (200–320 km/h) and Air Traffic (720-990 km/h). The magnetic field generator, an important part of the engine being a part of the track, limits the system capacity.\n\nFrom a competition standpoint, the Transrapid is a proprietary solution. The track being a part of the engine, only the single-source Transrapid vehicles and infrastructure can be operated. There is no multisourcing foreseen concerning vehicles or the highly complicated crossings and switches. Unlike classical railways or other infrastructure networks (as jointly administrated by the Bundesnetzagentur in Germany) a Transrapid system does not allow any direct competition.\n\nEcological impact\n\nThe Transrapid itself is an electrically driven, clean, high-speed, high-price, high-capacity means of transport able to build up point-to-point passenger connections in geographically challenged surroundings. This has to be set in comparison with the impact on heritage and or landscape protection areas (compare Waldschlößchenbrücke). Any impact of emissions has to take into account the source of electrical energy. The reduced expense, noise and vibration of a people-only Transrapid versus a cargo train track is not directly comparable. The reuse of existing tracks and the interfacing with existing networks is limited. The Transrapid indirectly competes for resources, space and tracks in urban and city surroundings with classical urban transport systems and high speed trains.\n\nHistoric parallels\n\nThe debate and the development of Suspension railways before 1900 as well as Alweg around 1960 and monorails (e.g. Aerobus) in Germany have a variety of parallels:\n\n* they were all developed in German-speaking countries and were deployed in limited capacities overseas\n\n* they failed in the planned market segment but had an impact as “future technology” symbols in the media, politics and public debate\n\nSupporters praise Transrapid and its predecessors as\n\n* advanced technology per se\n\n* a sign and guarantee of progress and innovation in Germany\n\n* the mark of a new age or further Kondratiev wave\n\nOpponents see the Transrapid and the predecessors as white elephants, wishful thinking based cargo-cult technology without real market chances and usability.\n\nFor advantages and disadvantages of maglev trains, see also: maglev.\n\nImplementations\n\nGerman high-speed competition\n\nThe Transrapid originated as one of several competing concepts for new land-based high speed public transportation developed in Germany. It also faced competition from the InterCityExpress (ICE), a high-speed rail system based on \"traditional\" railway technology. The ICE “won” in that it was adopted nationwide in Germany. A variety of studies for possible Transrapid systems was elaborated, including a long-distance line from Hamburg to Berlin. The last left was an airport connection track from Munich city to the Airport, which was finally canceled in early 2008 due to dramatically increasing cost projections.\n\nChina"
