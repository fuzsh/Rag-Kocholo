        "text": "The CRRC 600 (Chinese: 时速600公里高速磁浮交通系统; lit. '600 km/h high-speed maglev transportation system') is a high-speed magnetic levitation (maglev) train under development in China, using German Transrapid technology under license from Thysenkrupp. The first trainset was unveiled in July 2021 at the CRRC Qingdao Sifang factory in Qingdao. The train is planned to reach 600km/h, which would make it one of the fastest trains in the world.\n\nTesting of a 2019 prototype maglev EMU began in 2020 on a 1.5km Tongji University in Shanghai, with testing continuing in 2021. Testing the train to its maximum speed would require extension of the test track, as maglev trains are unable to use regular high speed railway tracks.\n\nThe trainsets can carry 2 to 10 carriages, with each holding over 100 passengers. The train is expected to enter service in 2025.[citation needed]"
