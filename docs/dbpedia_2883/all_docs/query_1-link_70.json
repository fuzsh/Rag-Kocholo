        "text": "Transportation has become an integral part of our lives. In the modern era there is a saying – “Life runs on wheels”; which is very much true. People want to travel farther and faster these days. This calls for a potent transportation system with high performance and high reliability. When we hear the words “transportation” and “reliability” a picture of Train appears in our mind. As the world knows, railways have been extensively used for quite some time now. Although railways have proved to be the most reliable mode of transportation, it takes a back seat when it comes to high speed travel. Therefore we need to design a rail system which can achieve high speeds to reduce the duration of travelling of commuters without affecting the reliability. This very requirement gave birth to “MAGLEV trains”. A typical MAGLEV train works on the principle of “magnetic levitation”. Unlike conventional trains which rely extensively on internal combustion engines, MAGLEV trains rely on electromagnets for propulsion. MAGLEV trains are one of the applications of “high voltage engineering”\n\nThe term “Levitation” refers to a class of technologies that uses magnetic levitation to propel vehicles with magnets rather than with wheels, axles and bearings. Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) uses magnetic levitation to propel vehicles with maglev, a vehicle is levitated a short distance away from a “guide way” using magnets to create both lift and thrust. MAGLEV can be the future of travelling as we have seen in China, South Korea and Japan they have been using maglev trains for decades. Maglev trains move more smoothly and somewhat more quietly than wheeled mass transit systems. Maglev trains come out to be fastest in the trains as they are elevated from the ground due to the magnetic field which results in frictionless movement. Now the travel is faster due to the Hyperloop maglev trains. In simple words Hyperloop is a maglev train track which is built in a vacuum tube to eliminate the air resistance in order to achieve highest speed. Hyperloop can be a promising fut...\n\nIn this growing world when cities and towns continue to become more crowded , the modes of transportation that are currently available to us will not be able to handle the demands of these overpopulated areas. This problem can be solved by the concept of electromagnetism. Electromagnets and superconducting magnets have allowed us to create a magnetic levitating train nicknamed \"Maglev\" which reduces friction between track and train by floating over it instead of directly being in contact. This has a lot of potentials to create trains that require a high initial investment but later on low maintenance and helps in fast transportation thus saving time. The magnetic levitation system used by these trains play an important role in suspending the Maglev train stably and following the track quickly with the adequate gap from the side walls thus highly reducing chances of damage. This paper gives an idea about the tech aspects of maglev projects worldwide such as Germany, Japan, and USA and also discusses about various idea to bring Maglev trains in developing countries like India.\n\nMaglev system represent a promising evolution in high-speed ground transportation, offering speed in excess of 500 mph along with the potential for low operating costs and minimum environmental impact. The goal of this effort is to investigate the feasibility and viability of maglev systems in the Japan. The emergence of a sophisticated technology such as maglev requires a need for a co-ordinated research test program and the determination of test requirement to identify mitigate development risk and maximum use of domestic resources. The study is directed towards the identification and characterization of maglev system development risks tied to preliminary system architecture. Research objective are accomplished by surveying experiences from previous maglev development program both foreign and domestic, and interviews with individuals involved with maglev research and testing.\n\nThe name maglev is derived from magnetic levitation. Magnetic levitation is a highly advanced technology. It has various uses. The common point in all applications is the lack of contact and thus no wear and friction. This increases efficiency, reduces maintenance costs, and increases the useful life of the system. The magnetic levitation technology can be used as an efficient technology in the various industries. There are already many countries that are attracted to maglev systems. Many systems have been proposed in different parts of the worlds. This paper tries to study the most important application of magnetic levitation technology which is the Maglev"
