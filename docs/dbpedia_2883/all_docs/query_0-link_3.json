Most of the history and basic science presented there remains accurate, but many of the technology areas have advanced considerably since 1996. Technology is a moving target. In particular, magnetic levitation, that is, the use of magnetic forces to combat gravity and friction, has recently advanced in a wide variety of technology areas. The world’s fi rst commercial maglev train line was constructed in China to link the Shanghai airport to the city center, and, since 2003, millions of passengers have already experienced the excitement of traveling at speeds up to 250 miles per hour. A less visible but much wider application of magnetic levitation is in magnetic bearings. Here maglev applications have greatly increased in recent years and include their use in artificial hearts, energy storage, wind turbines, integrated-circuit manufacture, and ultracentrifuges to enrich uranium. (The recent assembly of large cascades of such centrifuges in Iran has become a major issue of international politics.) “Flying frogs,” the levitation of living frogs in high magnetic fields, drew much public attention in 1997 and stimulated greatly increased attention to the general area of diamagnetic levitation— levitation of matter repelled by magnetic fields. Superconductors, the ultimate diamagnetic materials, have seen increased use in maglev devices and demonstrations, including the levitation of a Japanese\n\nPreface\n\nx\n\nsumo wrestler and, of considerably more scientific importance, a half-ton superconducting ring for fusion research. The Levitron, a very popular toy in which a spinning magnet achieves stable levitation through gyroscopic action, became widely distributed in the late 1990s, and improved models, with higher levitation heights, have appeared in recent years. Many aesthetically striking items employing sophisticated electrical circuitry to achieve desktop levitation of globes and other magnetic objects have been developed and have even appeared in the form of a floating sculpture in an art museum. All these and other recent developments have convinced me that it would be timely to write a full-length popular-science book focused on one particular aspect of “the natural magic of magnets”—the topic of magnetic levitation. To quote from Driving Force, “Does gravity get you down? Magnets can lift you up! Does friction slow you down? Magnets can speed you up! Fighting the forces of gravity and friction is one of the things that magnets do best.” I should perhaps note here that some authors reserve the term magnetic levitation for cases where the magnetic antigravity force is repulsive, delivered from below, and prefer the term magnetic suspension for cases where the magnetic antigravity force is attractive, delivered from above. But most regard the words “suspension” and “levitation” as virtual synonyms. In this book, I will use the term magnetic levitation for magnetic antigravity forces of all types, in part because I much prefer the shortened form “maglev” to “magsusp.” We’ll start in Chapter 1 with examples of humankind’s longtime fascination with levitation from the worlds of literature, films, television, theater, magic, and religion, and then briefly describe various physical but nonmagnetic means that humankind has developed to combat gravity. Since magnetic levitation involves the use of magnetic forces to combat gravitational forces, we’ll review in Chapter 2 the basics of those two competing forces, and in Chapter 3 the fundamentals of maglev, including the central problems of force bal-\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nance and stability. Later chapters describe the various types of magnetic levitation that have been developed and their applications, finally reaching in Chapters 11 and 12 the topic of maglev trains, one of the most dramatic examples of magnets “fighting the forces of gravity and friction. . . one of the things that magnets do best.”\n\nRising Force\n\n1\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\nFictional and Illusional Levitation\n\nA few years ago I was in Manhattan on a short business trip, staying in a hotel in the theater district. I had a free evening, decided to see a musical, and chose a performance of Mary Poppins, hoping to relive some of the fun of the earlier movie version starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. I enjoyed the show, but the most memorable and magical moment came at the very end. After Mary Poppins had said her goodbyes to the Banks family, she opened her umbrella and flew away. And this time she didn’t just fly across the stage and into the wings, as she had done earlier in the show. This time she held up her umbrella and casually flew off the stage, up and high over the theater audience, up and high over the balcony, and out of sight. It was a wonderful effect, and its magical impression on me was enhanced by the wonder expressed in the face of the 6-year-old girl who happened to be sitting next to me. There’s something about seemingly conquering the ubiquitous force of gravity that is especially magical to most of us. I was well aware that the flight of Mary Poppins above my head was not really magic, not really a miracle. The rational part of my brain knew that she was supported by a harness attached to an array of many fine wires, wires fine enough that they would not be visible to us in the limited lighting in the heights of the theater above our heads. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the feeling of magic. Suspension of disbelief can be an important part of enjoying the theater. I’m not\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n2\n\nsure of the thinking of the 6-year-old girl who sat next to me. The world remains full of mysteries at that age, and I suspect she was not then thinking about harnesses and arrays of wires. During intermission, her mother had bought her a replica of the magical umbrella that seemed to be an important part of the flying ability of Mary Poppins, and probably in the following weeks, the girl often opened her umbrella and pretended to fly. Pretense and imagination are important parts of the gifts of childhood, a gift we adults often lose. If the girl took any time at all to wonder about how Mary Poppins was able to fly, she perhaps explained it to herself by the effects of a special wind on the unfurled umbrella. After all, the flying of kites was an important part of the play, and isn’t it wind that makes kites fly? In the book and stage versions of Peter Pan, the ability to fly was explained by Peter Pan as requiring only fairy dust and happy thoughts. (In Disney’s movie version, “fairy dust” was converted to “pixie dust,” probably because pixies were considered more politically correct.) In the TV series The Flying Nun, Sally Field wore an unusual winglike headdress that perhaps allowed a magical wind to levitate and propel her through the air. Disney’s Aladdin used a flying carpet, and Harry Potter and other students at Hogwarts flew on broomsticks, as did the scary Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz (who doesn’t seem quite so scary in “Wicked,” where she sings “Defying Gravity.”). From the Middle Ages on, broomsticks have been portrayed as the preferred flying mechanisms for witches, the flying power of the broomsticks often enhanced by application of magical ointments. (Most modern attempts to explain the origin of this long-held superstition have a sexual component, with the broomstick a phallic symbol, a notion not stressed in the Harry Potter books.) In the Star Wars films, Yoda and other Jedi Masters are able to levitate objects with the use of “The Force,” while Chinese martial arts films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon feature warriors battling in graceful gravity-defying displays with no attempted explanation of the source of their abilities. To fly around the world on Christmas Eve, Santa Claus requires a team of magical reindeer, but\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n3\n\nSuperman and many other superheroes in the world of fiction somehow levitate and fly on their own power, with no reindeer, broomsticks, umbrellas, winged hats, flying carpets, pixie dust, or even happy thoughts required. The ability to counteract the downward pull of the earth clearly exerts a powerful attraction to our imagination. Demonstrations of levitation have also long been a popular tool for magicians to display their powers. One famous illusion was the “ethereal suspension” introduced by French magician Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin in 1847. As Robert-Houdin himself described it in his memoirs, I placed three stools upon a wooden bench. My son stepped on the middle one; I had him extend his arms so I could support him with two canes, each of which rested on a stool . . . I removed the stool so the child was supported only by the two canes. Th is strange balancing already evoked great surprise among the spectators. It grew even more when they saw me remove one of the two canes and the stool that supported it, and it reached its peak when, after having raised my child to a horizontal position using my little finger, I left him sleeping in space, and to defy the laws of gravity, I also removed the feet of the bench at the base of this impossible edifice.\n\nHis son was of course supported by the other “cane,” which was actually a strong iron bar connected at the bottom to a firm base and at the top to a mechanical harness worn by the son but hidden underneath his clothes. The harness and cane were joined with a complex but invisible linkage that allowed the magician to swing his son from vertical to horizontal. The illusion was featured on a 1971 postage stamp of France honoring the centennial of Robert-Houdin’s death. It shows his son horizontal in the air, supported under his arm by a thin cane standing on a stool mounted on a seemingly unsupported bench. (Both the son and the bench were cantilevered.) This trick has evolved to the current day in various forms, one of which is the “broomstick suspension” in which Robert-Houdin’s\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n4\n\ntwo canes are replaced by two broomsticks with their bristles facing up. This version even appeared in one episode of TV’s I Love Lucy, with Orson Welles as the magician and Lucille Ball as “Princess Lu Cy” seemingly supported only underneath one arm by the bristles of a broomstick (containing a concealed iron bar). Harry Houdini later honored the memory of Robert-Houdin by borrowing part of his name, but in The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin, wrote that RobertHoudin stole the “ethereal suspension” and others of his famous tricks from earlier magicians. An earlier and simpler illusion, involving no body harness and no complex linkage to the vertical rod, consisted simply of a metal platform cantilevered a few feet above the ground, supported on one end by a firmly anchored vertical iron rod. The levitated person wears loose clothing to conceal the platform, and the clothing often hangs down to conceal the supporting rod. Where full concealment of the rod is not possible, he simply puts one hand on the upper end of the rod/cane “to keep his balance.” This simple illusion is considerably older than Robert-Houdin’s “ethereal suspension,” but it created a sensation at an outdoor exhibition in South India in 1936, largely because photographs were taken and published in the Illustrated London News. The pictures, which can be seen today on the Web, show Yogi Subbayah Pullavar seemingly levitating a few feet above the ground in front of a crowd of 150 witnesses. Before the demonstration, Pullavar, platform, and rod support were inside a tent so that the assembly of the illusion could not be observed. Once it was ready, the tent flaps were opened for several minutes to amaze the audience with the levitating Yogi, and then closed again to allow the illusion to be disassembled. Recently a Dutch magician with the stage name of Ramana has revived this “Indian magic,” performed the illusion on television, and even demonstrated it in Times Square. Of course, more effective are levitation illusions in which there is no visible supporting cane or rod or broomstick, illusions in which the levitated body appears to be completely unsupported, simply floating in air. John Nevil Maskelyne, an English magician of the\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n5\n\nnineteenth century, is usually credited with the invention of the first effective illusion of this kind. Here the magician’s assistant could actually be seen to rise into the air (aided, of course, by magical hand gestures of the magician). It involved an assembly of fine wires to lift the platform on which the magician’s assistant reclined. The structure was cantilevered and supported by an iron pillar that stood about a foot behind the platform and could slide up and down through the stage. The curvature of the rod connecting the platform to the pillar allowed Maskelyne to stand in front of the pillar and obscure it from the audience. The audience’s view of the pillar was often also partly blocked by the assistant’s loose clothing that hung below the platform as he or she was lifted. The most important component of the illusion was the “gooseneck” in the rod of the support structure, which allowed Maskelyne to pass a circular hoop over the levitated body “not once, but twice” to convince skeptics in the audience that no wires or pillars were involved. This was possible because although the hoop did indeed pass over the levitated body from head to toe, it avoided the wires and the pillar. After the first pass, the hoop was still linked into the gooseneck of the support structure, but by pulling it back through the gooseneck and passing it over the levitated body again, the hoop became free. So passing the hoop over the body “not once, but twice” was an absolutely necessary part of the illusion. In Levitation: Physics and Psychology in the Service of Deception, Jim Ottaviani and Janine Johnston diagram in detail the Maskelyne “levi” trick, report how it was stolen by American magician Harry Kellar (Figure 1), and show how Kellar improved it, replacing the pillar with a second array of fine wires invisible to the audience. With no pillar to hide, the magician could now walk completely around the levitated body, usually the body of an attractive young woman appearing in Oriental clothing and introduced as Princess Karnak “from the mysterious East.” (It was helpful if the “princess” was not only attractive and young but also not too heavy, thereby limiting the stress on the wires.) As with most illusions presented by magicians, the levitation was introduced and accompanied by an extensive\n\nFigure 1.\n\nKellar.\n\n1894 poster advertising famed levitation trick of magician Harry\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n7\n\ncolorful background story and mysterious incantations. Kellar later sold this and others of his successful tricks to his successor Harold Thurston, who for many years was America’s most popular magician. Thurston often invited some people from the audience to come to the stage to convince everyone that Princess Karnak “actually floats in space without any support.” Once on the stage, the men and women from the audience could of course see all the wires but, being told that they were now “part of the story,” they usually did not publicly reveal the magician’s secrets. Why spoil a good show for others? As Ottaviani and Johnston note at the end of their book, “that’s magic.” One of the most impressive demonstrations of levitation by magicians today is that of David Copperfield. I first saw it on television, and it can be seen today online via the wonders of the Worldwide Web. In this performance, instead of levitating a recumbent “princess,” Copperfield gracefully flies himself, gliding through the air and even turning somersaults in midair. Like Maskelyne did in the nineteenth century, Copperfield dispels your suspicions of supporting wires by having assistants seemingly pass circular hoops around his body. He later descends into a large transparent box, assistants put a cover on top of the box, and he can even levitate while in the box! He sometimes adds a sequence in which he invites a woman in the audience to join him, and he flies with her in his arms, as Superman did with Lois Lane. The Web also includes many sites explaining Copperfield’s levitation, which involves—you guessed it—an array of fine wires attached to a harness around his waist. This particular supporting system was created and patented by John Gaughan, a leading manufacturer of equipment for magicians. It is more sophisticated than earlier levitation devices and allows a wide variety of motions while the performer is in the air. As for those circular hoops, by using two assistants manipulating the hoops very rapidly and in synchronism, the illusion is created of hoops passing around Copperfield’s body even though they avoid the wires suspending him. And when he\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n8\n\nenters the transparent box, the top of the box is in sections that allow the wires into the box and permit Copperfield limited levitation even inside the box. But you might prefer just watching the magician’s wonderful performance without thinking of all the complex paraphernalia involved. More down-to-earth levitation illusions include the “street magic” of David Blaine and others that can be performed anywhere without the need of overhead wires. Here, however, the apparent levitation lifts the performer only a few inches above the ground and lasts only a few seconds. One such illusion requires no special equipment at all, just skill and lots of distracting patter and arm motions. Here the performer retreats a few feet from a small group of adult observers, turns his back to them, and stands at an angle to them. He then slowly rises on tiptoe on the foot away from the onlookers, while lift ing his other foot so that his two heels stay together, giving the appearance from behind that both feet are being lifted off the ground. The foot nearer the audience blocks their view of the tiptoe position of the other foot. The “levitation” must be brief, and there should be no children in the audience because they are likely to bend over quickly to look underneath the performer’s front foot and detect the true source of the “levitation.” There are several other techniques for “street magic” levitation, some of which involve movable supporting pillars hidden inside the performer’s trousers, but it of course remains important that the supporting device, be it a pillar or the front of a foot, be blocked from view. So this form of levitation must be limited in both height and duration. Also very popular with magicians and their audiences are tricks in which the levitated object is not the performer but smaller and lighter objects such as playing cards. In such cases, you are right to suspect the presence of some very thin unseen strings. Even light objects like playing cards need help to resist the relentless pull of gravity.\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n9\n\nWingardium Leviosa!\n\nLevitation plays an important role in the fantasy world of the Harry Potter books and films, and not only with flying broomsticks. In the first book of the series, the young wizard students at Hogwarts Academy are pleased when in their Charms class, Professor Flitwick announced that they would be finally learning the levitation spell. On each student’s desk was placed a large feather to levitate. (After all, these were only young wizards trying their first levitation, and after they first learned to levitate light objects like feathers, they could later progress to heavier things.) The professor explained that, like most spells, it would require both proper use of their magic wands (the correct “swish and flick”) and saying the magic words properly. For the levitation spell, the magical incantation was “Wingardium Leviosa!” Harry’s friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were sitting together in the front of the class and Ron tried first. After a wide, sweeping movement of the wand, he pointed it at the feather in front of him and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” But the feather did not budge. Hermione then explained to Ron that he was saying it wrong, emphasizing the wrong syllables. Hermione then picked up her wand, gave it the proper “swish and flick,” and said “Wingardium Leviosa!” with the proper pronunciation. The feather rose from the desk and hovered above their heads. “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” Neither Ron nor the other students in the class were all that pleased that Hermione had mastered the levitation spell first. Later in the story, however, Hermione and Harry were in serious danger from a giant troll carry ing a huge club. Fortunately, by now Ron had learned the levitation spell. After a wave of his wand and a well-pronounced “Wingardium Leviosa!” the troll’s club rose in the air and then dropped down on the troll’s head, knocking it out and thereby saving Hermione and Harry. In a later episode, Harry also used the levitation spell to escape a difficult situation. Apparently,\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n10\n\nalthough a girl was the quickest to learn, boys can eventually catch up—at least in the fantasy world of Harry Potter. In his book The Science of Harry Potter: How Magic Really Works, British author Roger Highfield uses the wonder in the Harry Potter stories as an excuse to introduce some of the “magic” in realworld science. With regard to various examples of levitation in Harry Potter, Highfield seems to feel that some form of magnetic levitation is probably at work, which he introduces in a section entitled “Magnets, the Levitron, and Levitating Frogs” (topics we discuss in Chapters 4 and 6). But he makes no attempt to give a scientific explanation of why the levitation in Harry Potter’s world seems to depend on the proper pronunciation of the magic words. In Harry Potter’s world, the nonwizard humans are called Muggles. In our world, however, the real wizards are the Muggle inventors, scientists, and engineers who use their knowledge and creativity, not magic wands and magic words, to produce all the magic of modern technology, including the magic of magnetic levitation. Mystical Levitation\n\nDavid Copperfield introduces his levitation show with references to the common dream of flying. I’ve had that dream, and you probably have too. In his famous The Interpretation of Dreams, Sigmund Freud confesses to be mystified by flying dreams. Since such dreams are generally pleasurable, Freud suggested that they might just be a remnant of childhood fun with swings or seesaws or being lifted and swung in the air by playful parents or uncles. (He of course also suggests a possible sexual interpretation, as is his wont.) Other writers suggest that flying dreams may represent a desire for freedom from the limitations of everyday life, or perhaps a wish for social elevation. Whatever the meaning of flying dreams, I suspect that even a few saints have had them—or at least had some mystical experiences akin to dreaming. Copertino, once spelled Cupertino, is a small town in southern Italy, in the “heel” of the boot-shaped Italian peninsula. The town is\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n11\n\nmost famous for the birth there in 1603, in a stable, of Giuseppe Maria Desa, known in the West today as Saint Joseph of Cupertino. Giuseppe grew up to be very devout. He became a friar and often was gripped in intense religious “raptures” or “ecstasies,” trances in which he had miraculous visions. Stories began to circulate that while he was in these trances, he often levitated several feet above the ground. Witnesses reported that over the years he levitated dozens of times, sometimes to considerable heights, and once even levitated in the presence of the Pope. After Giuseppe’s death in 1663, stories of his levitations were part of the reports issued for his beatification, and he was canonized in 1767. Several paintings of the saint show him floating in mid-air. San Giuseppe de Copertino, or Saint Joseph of Cupertino, the “Flying Friar,” is now, most appropriately, the patron saint of pilots and air travelers. Perhaps the best known and most loved of the many other Catholic saints who have been reported to levitate is Saint Teresa of Avila. In her case, we can read her own accounts of her levitations in her autobiography, written in 1562 for her confessors. In it, she often reports seeing visions of devils and angels and even the presence of Jesus himself, and describes her frequent raptures, transports, and “flights of the spirit.” “My soul has been carried away,” she wrote, “and usually my head as well, without my being able to prevent it; and sometimes it has affected my whole body, which has been lifted from the ground.” She was not pleased with her levitations. She asked her fellow nuns not to speak of them, and on one occasion, asked them to hold her down. She beseeched the Lord “to grant me no more favors if they must have outward and visible signs.” She was apparently aware that some might think that her levitations were only dreams. “One does not lose consciousness,” she argued, “At least I myself was sufficiently aware that I was being lifted.” Considering the times in which she lived, Teresa was certainly an outstanding woman. In addition to her autobiography, Teresa wrote several other books and spent many years traveling throughout Spain founding Carmelite convents. She was so revered during\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n12\n\nher life that she was canonized only forty years after her death, and later became one of the patron saints of Spain. The desire to claim a piece of divinity was then very powerful. Teresa’s body was exhumed and dissected, and her relics became highly prized and distributed to various holy sites throughout Europe. General Francisco Franco reportedly kept her left hand by his bedside throughout his life. Her home city of Avila, with a restored center that is a World Heritage Site, retained only one of her fingers. When my wife and I visited Avila several years ago, we were most charmed by the ancient stone walls that surround the central city, but our tour guide clearly felt that the most important wonder of Avila was Saint Teresa’s finger. In the Old Testament, Ezekial reported being visited by a spirit who “lifted me up between the earth and the heaven.” Gnostic books tell of the levitation of Simon Magus above the apostle Peter, and Islamic sources tell of King Solomon traveling through the air, albeit with the aid of a magic carpet. There are tales of levitating Japanese ninjas and Indian yogis and fakirs (some, like Subbayah Pullavar, may also have been fakers). Tibet has legends of levitating lamas, and the Buddha himself reportedly had the power, although it is said that he was reluctant to levitate in the presence of others, since he disapproved of the public demonstration of miracles. In modern times, practitioners of Transcendental Meditation practice “yogic flying”—essentially a short hop with the legs crossed in the lotus position—which is claimed to be the first step toward full levitation. (But no transcendental meditators yet seem to have reached the second step.) Many people have described the sensation of flying during “out of body experiences” (OBEs), such “flights of fancy” sometimes enabled by hallucinogenic drugs. Amazon.com offers several books on self-levitation, including a “how-to manual.” Humans can fly in their dreams and mystical raptures, and from ancient times to today, have developed countless stories of gods and heroes (and sometimes villains) capable of levitation. The desire to overcome, at least to a degree, the force of earth’s gravity seems to have been with us for a very long time, probably since the very first\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n13\n\nhumans wondered at—and envied—the wonder-full flying abilities of birds. Fortunately, we are not limited to fictional, illusional, and mystical means of levitation. There are several real physical methods to produce upward forces and achieve levitation. Physical Levitation without Magnets\n\nIt was in Paris in 1783 that humans first achieved free flight. Brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier had been inspired by observing smoke rise up the chimney, and explored the possibility that the “levity” of smoke could be exploited to lift other objects. They started with a small silk bag that they held over a fire, and the bag rose to the ceiling. They then advanced to much larger bags and to public demonstrations, including one before Louis XVI at Versailles in which a sheep, a rooster, and a duck were the passengers. The balloon floated for several minutes and landed about two miles from the launch site. The animals looked none the worse from their trip, so the brothers were encouraged to try human passengers. After trials with humans in baskets attached to tethered balloons, a Montgolfier balloon carrying two French noblemen as volunteers was released in the Bois de Boulogne on November 21, 1783. This first manned free flight lasted about 23 minutes, rose to an altitude of over 3,000 feet, and landed safely several miles away. Humankind was finally freed from the confines of the earth’s surface. It took a while for the Montgolfier brothers to learn that it was not the smoke itself that conveyed levity to the balloon, but the heated air that was less dense than the cooler air outside the balloon. The balloon ascension did not actually overcome gravity—it used it. Gravity pulled downward on a given volume of the surrounding unheated air with a greater force than it pulled downward on the lighter heated air within the balloon, so the surrounding unheated air fell and the balloon rose. Earlier, in 1783, other Frenchmen had used another approach to produce a gas lighter than air, fi lling a balloon with the recently isolated gas, hydrogen, to successfully launch\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n14\n\nan unmanned balloon. Hydrogen balloons had distinct advantages over hot-air balloons, which required considerable effort during flight to keep alive the fire that heated the air. However, hydrogen also has a distinct disadvantage as a lifting gas for passenger flight—it burns. It was not until 1937, with the fiery end of the German airship Hindenburg, that hydrogen was finally abandoned as a common lifting gas. Today’s lighter-than-air ships use helium, a nonflammable, chemically inert gas first identified in the solar spectrum in 1868 (named from helios, Greek for the sun) and not discovered as a significant component of natural gas until 1903. At ordinary temperatures, although helium is about twice as dense as hydrogen, it is still about seven times lighter than air, so it can provide plenty of lift. The phenomenon of buoyancy that lifted the Montgolfier hotair balloon and today lifts the Goodyear blimp and other lighterthan-air ships, as well as many party balloons, is the same thing that enables me to do something I enjoy each summer—floating on my back in ocean water. I can do that because the salt water is a bit denser (i.e., weighs a bit more for a given volume) than my body. So the earth’s gravity pulls down harder on the salt water than it does on me, and I, a lighter-than-salt-water body, can float. As reported by Archimedes in the third century B.C.E., a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyancy force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. (The familiar story that this discovery led Archimedes to jump out of his bathtub and run naked into the streets crying “Eureka” is highly questionable.) The buoyancy force can also be viewed as the difference between the fluid pressure exerted on the bottom surface of the immersed body (pushing it up) and that exerted on its top surface (pushing it down). In any fluid, be it liquid or gas, pressure increases with depth. Here I probably should mention that there is a magnetic form of buoyancy commonly called the magneto-Archimedes effect. For this you need a magnetic liquid or ferrofluid, which consists of extremely fine particles of a magnetic material, commonly an iron oxide, suspended in a water-based or oil-based liquid. Pour the ferrofluid into\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n15\n\na container, immerse a small chunk of copper or other nonmagnetic material in the ferrofluid, and put a strong permanent magnet under the container. The ferrofluid is attracted strongly downward toward the magnet, it flows underneath the copper, and the copper rises. (This effect occurs even in weaker magnetic liquids, as long as the immersed object that you want to lift is less magnetic than the liquid.) Some call this a form of maglev, but for this book, I’ll reserve the term levitation for cases where an upward magnetic force opposes the downward force of gravity, and the lifted object is contactfree or nearly contact-free and not immersed in liquid. Let’s return to the more relaxing topic of me floating on my back in ocean water. For those who like numbers, I note that the density of fresh water is 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cc) or 62.4 pounds per cubic foot, while the density of most ocean water is a bit higher, about 1.03 g/cc. Ocean water is about 3 denser than fresh water because, by weight, it holds about 3 salt. (The water in special places like Utah’s Great Salt Lake or Israel’s Dead Sea holds much more salt and can have densities as high as 1.2 g/cc or even greater.) The density of the human body is close to that of water but is variable. Your bones and muscles are denser than fresh water, but your fat is less dense. With more fat, you float more easily. And you can change your average density by varying the amount of air in your lungs. If I blow the air out of my lungs, I rapidly sink to the bottom of a swimming pool—I’m rather skinny. But not in the ocean—that 3 extra density of the water, provided by the salt, makes it easy for me to float. In the above paragraph, I used two different units for mass or weight—grams and pounds—and two different units for distance— centimeters and feet. (To be more precise, I used two different units for volume—cubic centimeters and cubic feet.) In my work as a scientist, I usually use the metric system, which includes describing masses in grams and distances in meters, but we Americans as a society have been very reluctant to give up the “English system” of ounces and pounds and inches, feet, and yards, even though the English themselves abandoned it long ago. I’m an American and a\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n16\n\nscientist (a Scientific American?), so I feel reasonably comfortable with both sets of units, but some readers of this book may be either nonscientists or non-Americans, or both, and I want you all to feel as comfortable as possible. So when I need to use numbers and units to describe things quantitatively in this book, I’ll usually provide a translation from one set of units to the other, as I did above. In case I forget, you can refer back here for the basics: 1 pound = 454 grams = 0.454 kilogram, and 2.54 cm = 1 inch = 1/12 foot. Human flight started with the Montgolfier brothers and buoyancy. The next major step came 120 years later and was also made by two brothers—Wilbur and Orville Wright. In December 1903, on the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, they demonstrated that even an object heavier than air could be encouraged to fly and carry a human aloft with the help of wings, a headwind, and enginedriven propellers. They started with kites and gliders, and their first successful biplane was essentially a powered glider. Today’s huge passenger airplanes, like the Wrights’ Flyer of 1903, get their levitation or lift mostly from the difference between the upward air pressure exerted on the lower surface of the wings and the downward air pressure on their upper surface. In the Montgolfier balloon, this pressure difference between bottom and top resulted directly from the force of gravity and the resulting increase of air pressure with depth. In the Wright biplane and modern airplanes, it results mostly from the plane’s motion through the air, from the “wind beneath my wings.” Lifting forces generated by propellers in helicopters and by fans in hovercrafts (air-cushion vehicles) also result from differentials in air pressure. On a much smaller scale, an upward stream of air, for example, from a hair dryer, can levitate a ping-pong ball, a process that has been called aerodynamic levitation when used in a laboratory for research purposes. You can lift off the earth yourself with a downward stream of gases if you have the nerve to try a rocket belt of the kind seen in the James Bond 1965 movie Thunderball and featured much earlier in the Flash Gordon comics. Here the downward momentum of the\n\nLevity vs. Gravity\n\n17\n\nescaping gases yields a reverse upward thrust that can lift a human wearing the belt, but only for about 20 seconds before the fuel runs out. NASA’s rockets lifting shuttles into orbit or astronauts toward the moon provide upward thrust much longer, since they can carry a lot more fuel than James Bond could carry on his back. A less familiar way to produce antigravity forces is acoustic levitation—levitation by sound. Sound waves in air are waves of varying air pressure, usually generated by vibrations of surfaces in contact with the air, like the diaphragms of the speakers in radios, telephones, and other electrical devices (or our own larynxes). Scientists have used sound waves to demonstrate acoustic levitation of various solid objects, even including living things like beetles, spiders, ants, and ladybugs. The sound waves are generated utilizing transducers—devices that convert electrical energy into sound energy, usually piezoelectrics, materials that change dimensions under electrical stimulation. Those changes in dimension produce vibratory surface motions that generate vibrations in the air, that is, sound. Most sound waves are traveling waves in which the maxima and minima of air pressure (regions of compression and rarefaction) move outward from the source, for example, the TV speaker. Optimum acoustic levitation requires a sound reflector and interference between incident and reflected waves to create “standing waves” of sound between the emitting and reflecting surfaces, waves in which the maxima and minima of air pressure remain fi xed in space. Although acoustic levitation of beetles is amusing (perhaps not to the beetles), the technique of acoustic levitation also has practical applications in science and engineering, such as the levitation of molten materials that are highly active chemically and would react if in contact with most possible containers. Acoustic levitation is one laboratory technique used for “containerless processing” of reactive materials, as well as for other experiments in which study of a material without the influence of a contacting surface is of interest. More generally, simulated weightlessness is of special interest, of course, to NASA. Many experiments done by NASA and other laboratories\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n18\n\nusing acoustic levitation employ “sound” waves of frequencies higher than we can hear, that is, higher than 20,000 cycles per second. The technique is then called ultrasonic levitation. Except for the rocket belt, all the physical techniques that produce levitation mentioned so far require the presence of air or another gas to produce the upward force on the levitated object. However, several levitation techniques can operate in a vacuum without the use of rockets. One such technique is optical levitation, in which the upward force on the levitated object is provided by light, usually in the form of a high-intensity laser beam. Instead of air pressure, the object is levitated by “radiation pressure” produced by the particles of light, called photons, which carry momentum and transfer it to the levitated object. With enough laser intensity, stable suspension of small solid particles or liquid droplets has been achieved. Another physical levitation method that can operate in vacuum is electrostatic levitation. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, offers an electrostatic levitator for researchers interested in containerless processing. It has two horizontal copper plates with a large voltage difference between them, producing a large vertical electric field between the plates that yields an upward force on a charged object. With the use of side electrodes, complex electronics, and techniques to maintain charge on the object, stable levitation can be achieved. It’s a highly sophisticated use of the electrostatic force, which is most familiar to us via the “static cling” of clothing removed from the dryer. Electrostatic levitation is interesting, but more complicated to achieve and less widely useful than its close cousin, the main subject of this book—magnetic levitation, or, in its popular abbreviated form, maglev. To appreciate the challenges of maglev, we should first review the basics of gravitational and magnetic forces, which we do in the next chapter.\n\n2\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\nForces of the Universe\n\nTheoretical physicists tell us that there are only four basic forces of the universe: gravitation, the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. In this book on maglev, we can ignore the two nuclear forces and concentrate on the competition between gravitational and magnetic forces. But what about the force we’re most familiar with, the force of touch—the force the bat exerts on the baseball, the antigravity force our chair exerts on the seat of our pants, the force of air pressure that, as we discussed in the previous chapter, lifts helium balloons and 747s off the ground? Physicists think of such things on the atomic level and tell us that the force one object exerts on another through touch is basically the repulsion at very small separations between electrons in one object and electrons in the other. So the force of touch is just one aspect of the electromagnetic force. So let’s forget about touch for now and concentrate on magnetic levitation, that is, the competition between upward magnetic forces and downward gravitational forces—two forces that operate at a distance without touch. First we should review a few basics about gravitation. We should know the enemy. The gravitational force between two masses, unlike electric and magnetic forces, is always attractive. According to Isaac Newton, the gravitational attractive force between two masses varies as the product of the two masses—mass 1 times mass 2. If both of the two masses are small, the gravitational force is tiny. However, we live on\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n20\n\nthe surface of a huge mass—the earth—that exerts a very large and very noticeable downward force upon us. That’s the force we’re trying to oppose with maglev. Newton also tells us that the gravitational force between two masses varies as the inverse square of the distance of separation between their centers. That means that if you double the distance of separation between two centers of mass, the force decreases by a factor of four—two squared (2 = 2 × 2). If you triple the distance of separation, the force decreases by a factor of nine—three squared (3 = 3 × 3). That’s the famous inversesquare law. The gravitational force we’re most interested in is the force exerted by the earth on us and other objects near the surface of the earth, and the distance of separation between us and the center of mass of the earth is usually pretty constant. The radius of the earth is about 4,000 miles. Since our separation from the center of the earth is very large, slight changes in altitude will make only very small changes in the total distance of separation. Although the earth’s gravitational force acting on you on the summit of Mount Everest will be a little less than that acting on you at sea level, the difference will be less than a pound. (To lose weight, increasing altitude is much less effective than dieting or exercise.) For positions on or near the surface of the earth, we can consider the downward force of gravity on a particular mass, like your body or some object you want to levitate, to be very nearly constant. Even if you are orbiting in the space shuttle about 200 miles above the earth’s surface, that increases your distance from the center of the earth by only 5 (from 4,000 to 4,200 miles) and decreases the gravitational force on you by only about 10 (inverse square—the square of 1.05 is about 1.10). So the earth is exerting on you and the other astronauts in the shuttle about 90 of the gravitational force that it exerts on you when you’re on the earth. It’s not “zero gravity” as it sometimes is mistakenly called. The gravitational field of the earth, although it decreases with distance from the earth, extends to infinity. In the shuttle, it’s just slightly reduced gravity.\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n21\n\nBut if that’s true, why can you and your fellow astronauts float around so weightlessly? Because you’re in free fall. You are falling like a skydiver but without the air resistance. And also unlike a skydiver, you’re not falling straight down. The forward velocity of the shuttle in orbit keeps it and you falling around the earth, not into it. If you want to experience free fall without a ride in the shuttle, some amusement park rides offer 2 or 3 seconds of nearly free fall (thoughtfully followed by rapid deceleration before you hit the ground). Special airplane flights offer, several times during the flight, up to 25 seconds of nearly free fall. (NASA calls their plane Weightless Wonder, but for those with weak stomachs, it has become known as the “vomit comet.”) The scenes in the movie Apollo 13 where Tom Hanks and other astronauts are floating around weightlessly were filmed in such a plane. But in this book we will be considering objects that are very near the surface of the earth and not in free fall. In fact, with maglev, we want to use magnetic forces to keep objects from falling. Before we consider our main object of interest, the magnetic force, we should say a few words about its close cousin, the electrostatic force, another aspect of the electromagnetic force. The electrostatic force can operate at large distances between objects if one or both objects have a net electrical charge. When an object is uncharged or electrically neutral, as most objects usually are, the negative charge of the electrons is balanced by the positive charge of the atomic nuclei. However, it is often easy to create a surplus or deficiency of electrons in an object, say by rubbing a rubber comb through your hair (or rubbing it with wool if you no longer have hair). The rubber comb picks up some extra electrons from your hair or the wool, gets a net negative charge, and is now able to attract light bits of paper. (You should try this on a day when the air is fairly dry. If the air is very humid, water in the air tends to drain the comb of its excess charge.) Although the paper is uncharged, the net negative charge on the comb repels electrons in the paper away from the surface and the paper surface facing the comb gets a net positive charge, resulting in attraction to the comb. Another common experiment is\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n22\n\nto rub a glass rod with a bit of silk. The glass will lose a few electrons to the silk and get a net positive charge, and it now can also attract light bits of paper. Here the net positive charge of the glass rod attracts electrons and the surface of the paper facing the glass rod gets a net negative charge. Objects with a net charge, either negative like the rubber comb or positive like the glass rod, can attract uncharged objects like the bits of paper simply by causing the motion of some electrons in the paper. Transfers and motions of electrons among clothes in the dryer produce the phenomenon of “static cling” referred to in Chapter 1. A charged object attracts uncharged objects, but if you have two objects, each with a net electric charge, they can either attract or repel depending on their relative sign. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. If free to move visibly in response to weak forces, say if hung by thin threads, two rubber combs rubbed with wool (each with a net negative charge) will repel each other, as will two glass rods (each with a net positive charge) rubbed with silk, but a rubber comb and a glass rod will be attracted to each other. These electric forces of attraction or repulsion between charged objects act at large distances of separation, and Frenchman Charles-Augustin de Coulomb showed that the decrease in force with increasing separation followed the same mathematical law that Newton postulated for gravitational forces—the inverse-square law. “Coulomb’s law” of electrostatic forces states that electric forces between two objects with net electric charge decrease as the inverse square of the distance between them. It’s instructive to set Newton against Coulomb and compare the relative strengths of gravitational and electrostatic forces. Two protons, elementary particles of positive charge, exert on each other both an attractive gravitational force and a repulsive electrostatic force. But it is not a close contest. The electrostatic force of repulsion between the two protons, at any distance, is stronger than the gravitational force of attraction by a factor of 10 – 1 followed by 36 zeroes. (That’s a trillion trillion trillion!) Nevertheless, despite the relative weakness of gravitational forces compared to electromagnetic forces,\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n23\n\nthey are very noticeable for those of us who live on the surface of a very large mass like the earth. The famous physicist Richard Feynman was once speaking at a physics conference on the relative weakness of gravity. “The gravitational force is weak,” he said, “In fact, it’s very weak.” As luck would have it, at that very instant a loudspeaker broke loose from the ceiling and crashed to the floor. Feynman quickly added, “Weak–but not negligible.” Magnetic Forces\n\nHaving discussed the basics of the gravitational force, which is essentially constant but defi nitely “nonnegligible” near the surface of the earth, we now turn to the forces that are used in maglev to combat the pervasive and nonnegligible force of gravity—magnetic forces. The source of gravitational forces is mass. The source of electrostatic charges is electric charge. The source of magnetic forces is also electric charge, but electric charge in motion, even though you usually cannot see the motion of the charge, which can be electric current or can be on the atomic scale in the form of spin or orbital motion of electrons. In fact, it is the motion-based connection between electricity and magnetism that led Einstein to his theory of special relativity, which deals with relative motion. But for this book, we will ignore relativity and focus on situations in which the forces we are using to counter gravity can simply be considered as magnetic forces. Here it will be useful to remind you of several basic things about magnets and magnetic forces you probably learned many years ago, but several of which you are likely to have forgotten if you are not a practicing scientist or engineer. I introduced them in my earlier book, Driving Force, as ten “facts about the force.” (If you have read and memorized Driving Force, you can skip this section.) Fact 1: If free to rotate, permanent magnets point approximately north–south. That’s what compass needles do and what other magnets will do if they are free to swing in response to the weak roughly north–south\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n24\n\nmagnetic field of the earth. The end of the magnet that points north we call the north pole (north-seeking pole) and the end that points south we call the south pole. The ability of magnets to identify directions was known in China well over 2,000 years ago, but became known in Europe only about 1,000 years later. Note that the earth’s magnetic field causes the compass needle to rotate, that is, exerts a torque on the compass, but does not produce any net force to move the compass needle southward or northward. Because the earth’s field is essentially constant over the length of the compass, the magnetic forces exerted by the earth’s field on opposite poles of the compass needle are equal and opposite—no net force. Fact 2: Like poles repel, unlike poles attract. The north pole of one magnet will repel the north pole of a second magnet, but will attract its south pole. Unlike gravitational forces, magnetic forces can be either attractive or repulsive. Many students I have talked with about magnets, from first-graders to engineering majors at MIT, seem to find repulsive magnetic forces more fascinating than attractive forces. And we will find that many techniques of magnetic levitation are based on repulsive forces. Fact 3: Permanent magnets attract some things (like iron and steel) but not others (like aluminum, copper, wood, or glass). Th is selectivity is one of the most fascinating, and most useful, aspects of magnetic forces. It is used a lot in industry, and you can use it yourself to separate out the tiny iron-rich particles that are present in sands and soils and even some fortified breakfast cereals. Fact 4: Magnetic forces act at a distance and can act through nonmagnetic barriers (if not too thick). This is also very useful, not only to engineers but also to magicians who can achieve mysterious effects with hidden magnets. It also adds to the aesthetic effect of some maglev devices. Fact 5: Things attracted to a permanent magnet become temporary magnets themselves.\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n25\n\nWhen touched by a permanent magnet, a steel paper clip becomes magnetic enough to attract a second paper clip; it becomes a “temporary magnet.” If your magnet is strong enough, you can hang a long chain of paper clips under it. These first five “facts about the force” were known even in ancient times. In one of Plato’s early dialogues, he has Socrates describing Fact 5 in detail, although he discussed a chain of iron rings, not steel paper clips. (Socrates, via Plato, was not just conveying scientific facts. He was using this familiar property of magnets as a metaphor for the ability of poets to inspire others.) The next three facts were not known until the nineteenth century, when the close connection between electricity and magnetism was discovered. These may be less familiar to you than the first five, but some will be very important to the topic of magnetic levitation. Fact 6: A coil of wire with an electric current flowing through it becomes a magnet. It was in 1820 that Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current flowing down a wire moved a nearby compass needle. In a wire wound into a coil (e.g., shaped like a bedspring or a Slinky), the magnetic fields from the various turns of wire add together, and the coil becomes an electromagnet with a north pole on one end of the coil and a south pole on the other (Figure 2). Increasing the current increases the strength of the electromagnet, and if the current is reversed, the poles reverse. Permanent magnets are wonderful things, but electromagnets have the distinct advantage that their magnetic fields can be changed by changing the current. Permanence is admirable, but flexibility also has its advantages. Magnetic fields of electromagnets can be turned on and off, and alternating magnetic fields can be produced by alternating currents. That’s often very useful, and is especially so in many levitation systems. Fact 7: Putting iron inside a current-carrying coil greatly increases the strength of the electromagnet. Iron can be magnetized (become a temporary magnet) by exposure to a permanent magnet (Fact 5) or an electromagnet (Fact 7).\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n26\n\nAnd an iron core inside an electromagnet can increase the strength of its magnetic field by factors of thousands. Many electromagnets in engineering use, including many of those in devices discussed in this book, are iron-core electromagnets. Figure 2 shows, schematically,\n\nA\n\nS\n\nN\n\nB\n\nS\n\nN\n\nC Magnetic field patterns around (top) a permanent magnet, (middle) an air-core electromagnet, that is, a current-carrying coil of wire, and (bottom) an iron-core electromagnet; the iron amplifies the magnetic field produced by the coil.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nS\n\nN\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n27\n\nmagnetic fields produced by a permanent magnet, an air-core electromagnet, and an iron-core electromagnet. We will encounter all three magnet types in later chapters. Fact 8: Changing magnetic fields induce electric currents in copper and other conductors. Shortly after Oersted discovered that you can use electric currents to produce magnetism, Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry independently discovered that you can do the reverse—use magnets to produce electric currents, the phenomenon we call electromagnetic induction. Faraday found he could induce currents simply by moving a magnet in the vicinity of a conductor. That’s still how we generate most of our electricity today. Fact 8 may be unfamiliar to you, but we’ll later devote one whole chapter to it (Chapter 5), since using electromagnetic induction is one of the important ways to produce magnetic levitation. Among other things, it’s what allows some Japanese maglev trains to lift off the tracks and break world speed records. The final two of the ten “facts about the force” deal directly with magnetic forces, and since in magnetic levitation we’ll be using magnetic forces to counter gravitational forces, we should include them, even though they may be totally new to you. We’ll refer to Fact 10 a few times in later chapters and to Fact 9 at least once. And they both are pretty basic to the essence of magnetism and its uses. They may be totally unfamiliar to you, but when we use them in this book, we’ll remind you of what they are. Fact 9: A charged particle experiences no magnetic force when moving parallel to a magnetic field, but when it is moving perpendicular to the field it experiences a force perpendicular to both the field and the direction of motion. In freshman physics courses, Fact 9 is essentially introduced as the definition of a magnetic field. Electric fields are defined in terms of the force they exert on even stationary charged particles, and magnetic fields are defined in terms of the force they exert on moving charged particles. We won’t use Fact 9 much in this book, but the\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n28\n\nfact that magnetic fields produce forces perpendicular to the direction of motion of charged particles produces circular or curved paths of the particles in many large and small devices, including the electrons moving in circular paths in the magnetron that generates microwaves in your microwave oven. And it’s how the earth’s magnetic field directs charged particles emitted from the sun to the earth’s poles, thereby both protecting us from some radiation and giving us the northern (and southern) lights. Fact 10: A current-carrying wire in a perpendicular magnetic field experiences a force in a direction perpendicular to both the wire and field. Fact 10 is a close cousin of Fact 9 and deals with charged particles (electrons) moving through a conducting wire (i.e., electric current) rather than through free space. In this book, when we are dealing with moving electric charges, they will mostly be moving not through free space but through conducting metals, as in the wires of a current-carrying electromagnet. So Fact 10 will be more important to us than Fact 9. We’ll remind you of it when we need it. In Driving Force, I used Fact 10 to explain how magnetic forces on current-carrying wires in speakers convert alternating electric currents into alternating forces, producing alternating motion of a diaphragm that generates alternating compression and expansion of air (i.e., generates sound). Fact 10 can also be used to explain how magnetic forces acting on current-carrying wires convert currents into motion in motors, the other most common use of magnets. But in Driving Force, I instead discussed a motor in terms of Fact 2, the force between magnetic poles. Sometimes you can think of an electromagnet as a magnet with north and south poles, but sometimes it’s more helpful to think of it as current-carrying wires. It’s both. There are lots of perpendiculars in Fact 9 and its close cousin Fact 10, and for full application, they involve some three-dimensional thinking and one of the venerable “right-hand rules” popu lar (at least to the professor) in physics courses. Those rules often produce the amusing sight of many physics students, during exams, pointing\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n29\n\nthe thumbs and index and middle fingers of their right hands in mutually perpendicular directions to figure out the direction of magnetic forces. We’ll spare you that challenge. Phew! I’ve already thrown a lot of magnet science at you, and we’re only in Chapter 2. Take a deep breath. You probably knew the first five facts before picking up this book, even though you may not have thought about them much lately. So a reminder may have been helpful, and we’ll remind you again if and when we need to. Facts 6 and 7 you probably learned in school through the traditional experiment of wrapping a wire around a nail, attaching the ends of the wire to a battery, and finding that the nail was now a magnet and could pick up paper clips. But that was a long time ago, so I suspect that reminder was even more helpful. And Facts 8, 9, and 10 may be total strangers to some readers. Fear not. In the coming chapters, we will not be assuming that you already know all these things. As noted earlier, we will be devoting all of Chapter 5 to discussing Fact 8 (electromagnetic induction). And when we need Facts 9 or 10 (mostly 10) in later chapters, I’ll be sure to remind you of them. When you see a fact about magnets and magnetic forces applied to a real physical situation, it will be a lot more meaningful than considering it in the abstract. Magnetic Materials\n\nI teach in the materials science department at MIT, so it’s appropriate that before discussing the fundamentals of magnetic levitation, I should also say a few words about magnetic materials, and in particular, about the one element that is at the center of the world of magnetism—iron. Iron would be a very special element even if it were not magnetic. Of all the hundred-odd elements, iron has the most stable nucleus, which results in iron being the most common metal in the universe. And, by mass, it is also the most common of all the elements in our planet earth. Oxygen, aluminum, and silicon are a bit\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n30\n\nmore common than iron in the earth’s crust; because iron is heavier, much of it is in the earth’s core. But iron is much easier to separate from its oxides than silicon and aluminum. And in the form of steel, it is mechanically strong, formable, and inexpensive, making it of extreme importance as a structural material. And iron’s magnetic! Its immediate neighbors in the periodic table, cobalt and nickel, are also magnetic, but they are much more expensive than iron, so they are much less used. As we discussed in Facts 5 and 7, iron becomes magnetized in the presence of permanent magnets and as cores in electromagnets, and the use of iron as a “temporary magnet” is important in many applications. It also turns out that iron is a major chemical component of most permanent magnets. Lodestones, the only magnets known to Plato and his contemporaries, are made of the mineral magnetite, an iron oxide found naturally around the world. Once scientists and engineers learned to make steels (iron containing carbon and other elements), steel magnets surpassed lodestones, and they played a central role in the development of the electrical industry in the nineteenth century. In the 1930s, alnico magnets (alloys of iron with aluminum, nickel, and cobalt) surpassed the steels, and they are still sometimes used today. Alnico magnets helped the Allies defeat Hitler through magnetrons and microwave radar, but today most permanent magnets used are either the “ceramic” ferrite magnets (iron oxides containing barium or strontium) or the “rare earth” neodymium magnets (an iron compound with neodymium and boron). Thus the overwhelming majority of permanent magnets used in the past and those used today contain lots of iron. The ferrites are much cheaper than neodymium magnets and are therefore more used; for example, most refrigerator magnets contain fine particles of ferrite magnets immersed in plastic or rubber. But neodymium magnets are much more powerful than the ferrites and are used wherever superior magnetic properties are more important than cost, particularly in applications where size and weight are critical, as in laptop computers and earphones. And they are used in many levitation de-\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Forces\n\n31\n\nvices because they can produce greater magnetic forces than ceramic magnets. Neodymium, an important component of today’s most powerful permanent magnets, is element number sixty, one of the so-called “rare earth” elements that usually appear near the bottom of charts of the periodic table of elements. Neodymium itself actually is not very rare and is more plentiful in the earth’s surface than more familiar elements such as lead and tin. However, it is relatively difficult to separate from its ores, making it fairly expensive. And over 90 of the earth’s known supply of rare earths is in China; half comes from a single mine in Inner Mongolia. In 1992, Chinese president Deng Xioping bragged, “The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.” There are other important industrial uses for rare-earth elements, but the importance of neodymium in particular to today’s high-strength magnets makes some analysts worry that China is developing a stranglehold on the world market for magnets, and neodymium magnets are important in much of modern technology. They are especially important in computer hard drives and also are key to several growing markets for environmentally friendly “green” technology, including generators for wind turbines and electric motors for hybrid and electric cars. One of the biggest users of neodymium today is the Toyota Prius. In 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced tighter restrictions on exports of several rare-earth metals, including neodymium, and the announcement instantly produced greatly increased interest in the mining of rare-earth ores in the Western world (and a strong increase in the stock prices of mining companies in the business). Some darkly accused China of wielding the rare earths as a “twentyfi rst century economic weapon.” Neodymium and the other rare earths are not yet as important to the United States as Middle Eastern oil, but if we ever carry through on our long-stated goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil, the balance will shift. We’ll find that neodymium permanent magnets and iron-core and air-core (iron-free) electromagnets all play important roles in the\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n32\n\nworld of magnetic levitation. And most of the above “facts about the force” will be important to our discussions about maglev. Now that we have reviewed the basics of gravitational and magnetic forces and magnetic materials, it is time to consider the basics of using magnetic forces to combat gravitational forces, that is, to consider the fundamentals of magnetic levitation.\n\n3\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\nPoles Apart\n\nMost dictionaries define “magnet” as a “body that attracts iron.” As noted in Fact 3 in the previous chapter, although magnets attract iron, they do not attract copper or aluminum, or most other things— plastics, glass, wood, and so on. My granddaughter discovered this shortly after she learned to walk by removing a magnet from our refrigerator door and trying to stick it, usually unsuccessfully, to other surfaces around our house. Magnetic forces are very selective, a property that is not only fascinating but also very useful in separating magnetic materials from nonmagnetic materials. For example, since hay is nonmagnetic and most needles are made of steel, with the use of a magnet it is really very easy to “find a needle in a haystack.” The forces between two magnets are even more interesting, since they are sometimes attractive and sometimes repulsive. Each magnet has at least two poles, a north pole and a south pole, defined by which way they point in the earth’s magnetic field if free to rotate, as in a compass (Fact 1). As I demonstrated to the wonder of my granddaughter’s first-grade class recently, south and north poles attract each other, but two south poles, or two north poles, repel each other. Unlike poles attract, like poles repel (Fact 2). Disc and ring magnets are usually magnetized in a direction through their thickness, so that one face is a north pole and the opposite face a south pole. With two ring magnets on a pencil, the repulsive force between two like poles facing each other, say north–north,\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n34\n\ncan lift the upper magnet against the downward force of gravity and produce the simplest form of magnetic levitation (Figure 3). The downward gravitational force on the upper magnet is balanced by the upward magnetic force of repulsion between the two magnets. (The two magnets in Figure 3 are ferrite magnets. If you instead use two neodymium ring magnets, the repulsive forces are stronger and the levitation height is considerably higher.) Here the repulsive force between the two magnets is directed perpendicular to the plane of the magnets, pushing the two north poles apart. The direction of magnetization of the magnets and the direction of the repulsive force between the magnets are both vertical. If instead you put two ring magnets on a table with the two north poles each facing upward, the magnets also repel each other in the sideways direction—the direction parallel to the plane of the magnets and perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. This sideways repulsion is the secret of the maglev toy called Revolution (Figure 4), in which magnets in the base, magnetized in the horizontal direction, repel two similarly magnetized disc magnets above them in the rotating part, producing levitation. In both Figure 3 and Figure 4, the magnetic repulsive force producing levitation is directed vertically upward against gravity, but in Figure 3 it is parallel to the direction of magnetization, while in Figure 4 it is perpendicular to the magnetization, parallel to the surface of the two disc magnets. The seeming defiance of gravity is more visually striking in the latter case, since the magnets in Revolution are less constrained and closer to full contact-free levitation than the magnets on the pencil. However, in neither of these cases are the levitated magnets totally free of contact. Touch was not involved in the upward push of magnetic repulsion that opposed the downward pull of gravity, but was necessary to keep the position of the levitated magnets stable. If you remove the pencil in Figure 3 and try to float the upper magnet above the lower one, it will move sideways or flip over until opposite poles mate. If you remove the glass plate in contact with one end of the rotator in Figure 4, the rotator will lurch forward and fall. As\n\nFigure 3. When two ring magnets are placed on a vertical support with like poles facing, the upper magnet is levitated by the repulsive force between the two magnets.\n\nThe horizontal rotating part (rotor) of the “Revolution” maglev toy is held up by repulsive forces between like poles of ring magnets in the rotor and pairs of triangular magnets beneath each ring magnet. The rotor can turn for several minutes because the only friction is between the steel-pointed end of the rotor and the glass plate that blocks its horizontal motion.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n36\n\nmany children and even adults have found with their futile attempts over the years, you can’t simply use the repulsive force between like poles of two permanent magnets to levitate the upper magnet freely in space without it being in contact with something, like the pencil in Figure 3 or the glass plate in Figure 4. Way back in 1842, Samuel Earnshaw, an English clergyman and mathematician, proved mathematically that stable contact-free levitation by forces between ordinary stationary magnets alone is impossible. So you can stop trying. But as we will see in the coming chapters, there are several ways to get around the Reverend Earnshaw’s proof and achieve contact-free magnetic levitation. And for many applications, a little contact doesn’t hurt. In the Revolution, the friction between the glass plate and the sharp metal tip of the rotating part (rotor) is pretty small, and once started, the rotor can spin for several minutes before slowing to a gradual stop. Force at a Distance\n\nAnother thing about magnetic forces that children learn pretty quickly when playing with magnets is that the forces between magnets fall off rapidly with distance between them. Gravitational and electrostatic forces also decrease with distance, and according to Newton and Coulomb, they decrease as the inverse square of distance of separation. But magnetic forces decrease more rapidly than as inverse square of distance—because magnets always have at least two poles. You may recall an experiment they often do in schools. Take a long bar magnet, with a north pole on one end and a south pole on the other, and break it in two. You find that now each of the two resulting magnets has both a north pole and a south pole. Two new poles have appeared on the new surface created by the break. All magnets have at least two poles, a north pole and a south pole— magnets are dipoles, not monopoles. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would attract or repel each other with an inverse-square law.\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n37\n\nBut for ordinary magnets, it is safe to assume that they have at least two poles. So the forces between magnets (i.e., between magnetic dipoles) are more complex than the inverse-square laws of gravitational and electrostatic forces. One important result of the fact that magnets are dipoles is that if a magnet is in a uniform magnetic field, the forces on opposite poles are equal and opposite, and the magnet feels no net force, as noted in the previous chapter. All it experiences is a torque that attempts to rotate it and align it, like a compass needle, with the local magnetic field. But there can be a net force on a magnet if the field is not uniform—if it changes with distance. A piece of iron is attracted to a magnet because the field is higher near the magnet than away from it. Where the magnetic force is repulsive, as in Figure 3, the upper magnet is pushed upward because the field from the lower magnet is lower there. We call that change of the magnetic field strength with distance the gradient of the field, in analogy to the gradient or slope of a hill, which is the change of height with horizontal distance. (For those who remember their calculus, the field gradient is the derivative of the field with respect to distance, but I promise not to mention calculus again.) If the field changes with distance, as it will in the vicinity of another magnet, the force on one pole will be greater than the force on the other pole, and there will be a net force. Now consider those two ring magnets on the pencil in Figure 3. The north pole of the top magnet is repelling the north pole on the bottom magnet. But each of the magnets has another pole! The south pole on the top magnet is attracting the north pole of the bottom magnet, and the south pole of the bottom magnet is attracting the north pole of the upper magnet. This decreases the net repulsive force between the two magnets, and the result is that, at large separations, the repulsive force between the two magnets varies not as the inverse square, but as the inverse fourth power of the distance between them. If you double the distance of separation, the force decreases by a factor of sixteen—two to the fourth power (2 × 2 × 2 × 2).\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n38\n\nThat’s quick! The force–distance relation all the way from small separations to large separations is more complex—I won’t burden you with it. The major point to remember is that the magnetic forces between magnets decrease very rapidly with distance of separation. The force of attraction between a magnet and a piece of iron decreases much faster yet because it depends not only on the gradient of the magnetic field, but also on the strength of the local field of the magnet acting on the iron, which determines the degree of magnetization of the iron. The net effect is that at large separations, the force between a permanent magnet and a piece of iron (always attractive) decreases as the inverse seventh power of separation! With the inversesquare laws of gravity and electrostatics, doubling the separation decreases the force by a factor of four (2). With the inverse-fourthpower law for the force between two distant magnets, doubling the separation decreases the force by a factor of sixteen (2). With the inverse-seventh-power law for the attractive force between a magnet and a piece of iron, doubling the separation decreases the force by the remarkable factor of 2, or 128! The Bottom Line: Since the force of gravity remains nearly constant near the surface of the earth, but magnetic forces decrease very rapidly with distance of separation, magnetic levitation gaps will in general be very limited. To a degree, the “reach” of a magnet’s field can be increased by increasing the magnet’s size, but to achieve levitation gaps greater than a few inches, you’ll need magnets that are both very strong and extremely large (and therefore extremely expensive). Sorry about that. The Floating Island of Laputa\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, magnetic levitation heights are generally limited to distances of inches or less rather than miles. But in fiction like Jonathan Swift’s satirical novel, Gulliver’s Travels (1726), imagination is not limited by facts. In Swift’s novel, after Gulliver had visited the tiny people of Lilliput and the giants of Brobdingnab,\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n39\n\nhe next visited Laputa, a magnetically levitated “Island in the Air” (Figure 5). Swift described this remarkable but imaginary island in considerable detail. It was circular with an area of 10,000 acres, about 70 of the area of the island of Manhattan, and achieved levitation to heights of up to 4 miles by means of a giant lodestone, a natural magnet. The magnet was shaped somewhat like a cigar, about 6 yards long and about 3 yards in diameter. As described by Swift, the magnet was endued at one of its Sides with an attractive Power, and at the other with a repulsive. Upon placing the Magnet erect with it attracting End towards the Earth, the Island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards, the Island mounts directly upwards . . . When the Stone is put parallel to the Plane of the Horizon, the Island standeth still; for in that Case, the Extremities of it being at equal Distance from the Earth, act with equal Force, the one in drawing downwards, the other in pushing upwards; and consequently no Motion can ensue.\n\nSwift was clearly aware of one basic fact about magnets—like poles repel, unlike poles attract (Fact 2). Although he did not describe the forces levitating Laputa in terms of north and south poles, it can be assumed that the lodestone was magnetized along its length, with a north pole on one end and a south pole on the other. Apparently Balnibarbi, the land above which Laputa levitated, contained underneath it a gigantic permanent magnet, a “Mineral which acts upon the Stone in the Bowels of the Earth.” And Balnibarbi’s gigantic underground magnet was predominantly of one pole facing upward, so that it repelled one end of Laputa’s lodestone and attracted the other. But among the various unrealistic properties of Laputa was its ability to stably maintain altitude when the lodestone was horizontal. In such an orientation, there would be no net upward levitation force to oppose gravity. It would not hover at a fi xed altitude; it would fall. And the vertical magnetic field from Balnibarbi would\n\nFigure 5.\n\nGulliver wondering at the magnetically levitated island of Laputa.\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n41\n\nexert a huge torque on the horizontal lodestone, tending to tilt the lodestone. But according to Swift, tilting of the lodestone produced motion of Laputa at an angle to the vertical, motion with a horizontal component that allowed Laputa to travel to other parts of Balnibarbi. That also wouldn’t work. Science-fiction and popular-science author Isaac Asimov in 1980 published an annotated version of Gulliver’s Travels in which he analyzed Swift’s description of magnetic forces in detail. He concluded, “In short, Swift’s mechanism to keep Laputa aloft and in motion wouldn’t really work, but I suppose that’s of no surprise to anyone. The explanation sounds scientific and impressive and that’s all that counts.” Swift’s motive in describing the impossible motions of Laputa was simply to satirize scientists and their writings, not to provide a scientifically accurate explanation of magnetic levitation. In addition to the inconsistencies noted above, to levitate an island of the weight of Laputa through forces on a lodestone of that size would require an impossibly strong repelling magnet, many miles wide, in the ground below. And it would require some means to counter Earnshaw’s rule and produce stable magnetic levitation. But Gulliver’s Travels is still a fascinating read, and among its pleasures is the remarkable but impossible floating island of Laputa. Unlike Swift, most fiction writers featuring levitation, like J. K. Rowling of the Harry Potter books, do not specify that magnetic forces are the source of the levitation. However, the writers of the Dick Tracy and Spiderman comics of the 1960s explicitly did. Dick Tracy and his colleagues flew around town in one-man maglev devices that, like Laputa, could achieve altitudes of miles. Chester Gould, the creator of Dick Tracy, was so impressed with the potential of magnetic forces that his comic strip frequently stated, “The nation that controls magnetism will control the universe.” And the “magnetic antigravity device” used by Spiderman’s adversary Vulture also reached impressive heights. Spiderman developed an “antimagnetic inverter” to weaken Vulture’s mysterious maglev device, but Vulture returned in a later issue with an improved version. Beyond asserting\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n42\n\nthat their characters achieved levitation through magnetism, the authors of Dick Tracy and Spiderman provided no scientific details that could be critiqued by Isaac Asimov. And they, like Jonathan Swift, conveniently ignored the decrease of magnetic forces with distance of separation and thereby achieved substantial heights of levitation. Writers of nonfiction like myself are more constrained. Stability and Degrees of Freedom\n\nThe upper ring magnet in Figure 3 floats above the lower ring magnet at a fi xed and stable distance of separation. The downward gravitational force on the upper magnet is essentially constant, but the upward repulsive magnetic force decreases rapidly with distance of separation, and the magnet rests at a separation where the upward and downward forces are equal and opposite. There’s a balance of vertical forces. No net vertical force, no vertical motion. Now if you displace the upper magnet a little bit upward from that position, the upward repulsive magnetic force will decrease and become less than the downward gravitational force, which is unchanged. The net force will be downward, pulling the magnet back to its original separation. If instead you were to displace the upper magnet downward, the upward magnetic force will increase to more than the downward gravitational force. The net force will now be upward, pushing the magnet back to its original separation. Thus displacement in either direction results in a “restoring force” acting to return the magnet to its original position where the upward and downward forces are equal and opposite. We say that there the upper magnet is in a position of stable equilibrium (with respect to vertical displacement). For small displacements from a position of stable equilibrium, the restoring force increases linearly with displacement, and in analogy to the forces resulting from stretching or compressing a spring, the ratio of restoring force to displacement is called the spring constant. Suppose we instead reversed one of the magnets on the pencil so that they attract each other. Imagine then holding the upper magnet\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n43\n\nfi xed and allowing the lower magnet to move up and down along the pencil. It would be possible to find a separation between the two magnets where the downward gravitational force and an upward magnetic force, now attractive, are equal and opposite. As in the repulsive case, there’s a balance of vertical forces in this position and no net force. But if you now were to displace the lower magnet a little bit upward toward the upper magnet, the upward attractive magnetic force would increase, the net force would be upward, and the magnets would snap together. If instead you were to displace the lower magnet downward, the upward magnetic attractive force would decrease, the net force would be downward, and the lower magnet would fall. Unlike the repulsive case, displacements from the position of zero net force lead not to restoring forces, but to net forces that move the magnet away from that position. That position is unstable. Instead of net restoring forces, there are net destabilizing forces. Since gravitational forces are constant but magnetic forces decrease rapidly with distance of separation, it is often easier to achieve stable levitation with repulsive forces than with attractive forces. If you’re attracted to something, it’s hard to keep your distance! But even in repulsion, we surely needed that pencil in Figure 3. By confining the magnets to the pencil, we could reach stable equilibrium of vertical forces. But if we tried to levitate one ring magnet above the other without a pencil, the upper magnet would spontaneously move sideways or tip over. It was stable, with displacements resulting in restoring forces, only for displacements in the vertical direction. But it was unstable with regard to sideways displacements or tipping displacements. If the lower ring magnet were made bigger than the upper one, the changed magnetic field distribution could stabilize the upper magnet against sideways displacements, but it would still be unstable to tipping motions. Full stability is not possible. Samuel Earnshaw proved mathematically, and many have proved by experiment, that you can’t levitate one stationary magnet above another without some contact. Earnshaw’s rule is an important limitation to the possibilities of magnetic levitation.\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n44\n\nThinking big, a Dutch company called Universe Architecture has recently designed a full-size “floating bed” based on repulsion between like poles of large arrays of permanent magnets, presumably neodymium. But to satisfy Reverend Earnshaw, the floating bed is mechanically stabilized by angled cables running from each of the four corners of the floating bed to the floor. Here the cables play the role of the pencil in Figure 3 and prevent the bed from flipping over, which would be disconcerting to a sleeper if it happened in the middle of the night. The magnetic floating bed is an intriguing use of Fact 2, but the bed weighs several tons and is priced at over a million euros. There have been no customers yet. Levitation of the two disc magnets in the rotor in Figure 4 by magnets in the base is more complex and more interesting. As with the magnets on the pencil, upward repulsive magnetic forces balance downward gravitational forces to achieve stability in the vertical direction. Displace the rotating part (the rotor) a bit upward, and it will return to where it was. Push it a bit downward, and it will return to where it was. There are vertical restoring forces. But it’s much more stable than that. If you move the rotor a bit sideways, it will also return to where it was. In the base below each disc magnet of the rotor are two triangular magnets, one on the left side and one on the right side, each magnetized in the same direction as the ring magnets, that is, horizontally along the rotor axis (Figure 6). They provide a “magnetic well” that exerts repulsive forces on the disc magnet (represented by arrows in Figure 6) roughly perpendicular to their hypotenuse (the long side of the triangle), thus with both vertical and horizontal components. The vertical components add together to provide a net vertical repulsive force upward on the disc magnet. The horizontal components, in contrast, are in opposite directions and cancel each other when the disc magnet centers between them. However, when the disc is displaced to one side, it becomes closer to the triangular magnet on that side. That repulsive force therefore increases while the repulsive force from the other triangle decreases, and the net horizontal force provides a restoring force against sideways displacements.\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n45\n\nSchematic of the magnet positions in the Revolution toy in Figure 4. Each of the two ring magnets on the rotor is supported by a pair of triangular magnets on the base. Direction of magnetization is normal to the figure. Repulsive forces between the magnets (indicated by arrows) both lift the ring magnet and resist lateral displacements.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nNow try some tipping displacements. With one end of the rotor fixed in position on the glass plate, displace the other end up or down a bit so that the rotor is no longer horizontal, and the rotor will return to horizontal. Displace that end sideways so that the rotor is no longer perpendicular to the glass plate, and it will return to perpendicular. The repulsive forces between each of the disc magnets in the rotor and the two triangular magnets in the base below each of them provide restoring forces and stable equilibrium not only for vertical displacements, but also for sideways displacements and for tipping displacements in two different directions. The Revolution device in Figure 4 (patent filed in 1991 by Gary Ritts of California) is a far more sophisticated maglev device than\n\nR I S I N G\n\nF O R C E\n\n46\n\nthe two ring magnets on a pencil in Figure 3. But it still falls short of our goal of complete contact-free levitation. Although stable against displacements in two directions of motion (vertical and sideways) and two axes of tipping, and allowing free rotation about the axis of the rotor (neutral stability around that axis—no restoring or destabilizing forces), the rotor would not be stable in the horizontal direction along its axis without the glass plate. The disc magnets are placed slightly closer to the glass plate than the base magnets, producing a small magnetic force pressing the rotor against the glass plate and keeping the rotor from moving backward. It is time to introduce an important term often used in discussing maglev devices (as well as in other areas of science and technology): degrees of freedom. If we are to levitate an object stably in space, it should be stable against displacements of six different sorts. It should be stable against displacements in each of three mutually perpendicular directions, say north–south, east–west, and up– down (or along x, y, and z axes for those more mathematically inclined). And it should also be stable against rotations about each of those three perpendicular directions. In some applications, it will also be desirable to have all those six degrees of freedom—three position variables and three rotation variables—not only stable, with restoring forces resisting displacements, but also fully controllable with magnetic forces. With the two magnets on a vertical pencil in Figure 3, the pencil has removed any possibility of displacements in either of two perpendicular horizontal directions and substantial rotations about either of these horizontal directions. (As you can see in the figure, the upper magnet is trying to tip over, but can’t.) The pencil has removed four degrees of freedom for the upper magnet and limited it to only two—vertical position along the pencil and rotation about the pencil. If the magnets are fully circular in symmetry, rotation about the pencil has no effect on magnetic forces (neutral stability). Only one of the six degrees of freedom, vertical position along the pencil, is stably controlled by magnetic forces.\n\nMaglev—A Balance of Forces\n\n47\n\nIn contrast, the glass plate in the Revolution device of Figure 4 has constrained only one degree of freedom of the rotor—displacement along its axis. As we have seen, magnetic repulsive forces between the two ring magnets and the pairs of triangular base magnets below each of them keep the rotor stable against both vertical and sideways displacements and also against tipping rotations about either of those directions. So the rotor is stably held with respect to those four degrees of freedom and has neutral stability against a fifth—rotation of the rotor about its axis. It’s unstable to only one of the six degrees of freedom—displacement along the rotor axis. Thus in the Revolution we have come a long way toward full contact-free levitation, but to achieve that, we will have to liberate all six degrees of freedom from constraint by physical contact. We will need some tricks to get around the dictates of the Reverend Earnshaw. Hint: Earnshaw considered only static magnets and static fields.\n\n4\n\nSpinning the Levitron\n\nOnly a Toy\n\nI have long been a fan of science toys, which are relatively inexpensive but capable of illustrating physical principles in an engaging way. Using them in seminar or lecture can make scientific concepts more accessible and understandable to students from kindergarten to college. The shelves in my MIT office hold numerous science toys, and I have often used the toys related to magnets in a freshman seminar on magnets that I taught there for many years. For example, I often introduced magnetic levitation to the freshmen with the Revolution toy of Figure 4 and then asked them to figure out where the magnets are and in which direction they are magnetized. The resulting discussions and analyses can be quite instructive for the students (and sometimes for me). Thus I was very excited one day in 1995, shortly after my earlier book on magnets went to press, when I first saw a Levitron, “the amazing antigravity top,” in a science-based store. I assumed that the upward levitating force on the top was the same repulsive force between like poles employed in Figure 3, but now there was no pencil needed to constrain four degrees of freedom of the upper magnet. I suddenly realized that in the Levitron, the levitated magnet was a spinning top, and I concluded that the gyroscopic action resisted tipping of the magnet and allowed the top to evade the rule of Samuel Earnshaw (which applies only to static magnets) and achieve contactfree levitation. My immediate reaction was fascination and wonder,\n\nSpinning the Levitron\n\n49\n\ncoupled with some annoyance with myself: “Darn! Why didn’t I think of that?” But I bought the Levitron and immediately went home to try my hand at achieving the magic of full contact-free magnetic levitation. I soon found it was not that easy to achieve. Within the box were the three main parts of the Levitron: the base, which clearly held a very large magnet; the small top, which contained a disc magnet about an inch in diameter; and a nonmagnetic plastic “lifting plate.” There also were a number of tiny brass and plastic washers, a couple of tiny rubber o-rings (to hold the washers on the top), and two thin wooden wedges or shims. The instructions indicated that I should place the lifting plate on the base, spin the top on the lifting plate, and then lift the plate an inch or so above the base until the spinning top floated free. Easier said than done. The first challenge was getting the top to spin. There were strong magnetic forces between the base magnet and the magnet in the top that mightily kept fighting me. And those forces kept winning. I had to try many times before I could get the top to spin. To make the top easier to spin, the marketers of Levitrons now offer an electrical “Starter” for those “not so nimble-fi ngered,” a category into which I apparently fell. Once I became intermittently successful in spinning the top, I faced the second challenge—to adjust the weight of the top to the proper value, which was the purpose of "
