        "text": "On December 31, 2002, the inauguration ceremony of Shanghai Transrapid Maglev Line, the world's first and only high-speed commercial commuting system using electromagnetic levitation (maglev) technology, was held in Shanghai. Premier Zhu Rongji and visiting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder attended and addressed in the ceremony.\n\nAt 10 in the morning, Premier Zhu Rongji, with his wife Lao An, and Chancellor Schroeder arrived at the newly decorated Longyang Road Station, the station of departure. After cutting the ribbon for the trial operation of Shanghai Transrapid Maglev Line, they took a train to the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the terminal of the maglev line.\n\nAt 10:00, green alternating with yellow and white, streamlined maglev train began to run against winds. During the operation, the train spent eight minutes for the whole of a single trip with a mileage of 30 kilometers, and the maximum speed reached the designed 430 km per hour. Premier Zhu, Chancellor Schroeder and their parties gave an animated applause to the success of the operation. After that, Zhu and Schroeder were shown around the platform at the Pudong International Airport, waving their hands to the staff members there again and again. Then they returned by the same train to the Longyang Road Station, where they inspected the control center and inquired about matters relating to the line's construction and operation.\n\nAt 11:10, the inauguration ceremony of Shanghai Transrapid Maglev Line was held in Shanghai International Media Center, and Zhu Rongji and Schroeder addressed in the ceremony.\n\nZhu said that after over two years' planning and construction, Shanghai Maglev Line has successfully finished its maiden journey, which is a major event not only in the history of ShanghaiÂs urban development but also in the history of China's railway transportation. He said it is a miracle for Shanghai to accomplish such a state-of-the-art, hi-tech project in such a short span of time. He also expressed his warm congratulations on the success of the trial operation and extended his welcome to Chancellor Schroeder and his parties who came to attend the ceremony.\n\nPremier Zhu said that as a new type of vehicle with high technology involved, maglev train has many merits including big capacity, rapid speed, low energy-consumption, high security and being environment-friendly, so it has prominent economic result and momentous social benefit, and enjoys a broad prospect. Zhu said that the completion of the first commercial maglev line by the Shanghai City is a beneficial exploration in the development of new types of rail transport. Zhu said that it will not only help accelerate Shanghai's drive of turning itself into a modern metropolis and but bear a significant meaning to the diversified construction of China's railway transportation and the substantial growth of the related technologies in China.\n\nZhu said that the showcase maglev line, in which German technologies were imported and utilized, has been the latest outcome of Sino-German cooperation in the hi-tech field, and it is expected to further boost bilateral economic and technological ties to a still higher level. He paid his highest respect to the technicians and working staff from both China and Germany, extending his appreciation to Chancellor Schroeder and the German Federal Government for their concern, assistance and support.\n\nZhu expressed the hope that both Chinese and German cooperative partners will keep their close cooperation in improving the system and further explore ways of localizing the production of maglev equipment so as to make it still more economical and competitive.\n\nSchroeder expressed his warm congratulation on and highly evaluated the success of the trial operation of the maglev line in his address. He said that the resolution of the Chinese government and the hard work of the construction staff delivered a high-quality and high-speed of the completion of the project, thus turning the dream three years ago into reality. He also thanked the Shanghai Municipal government for its vigorous support to this project.\n\nSchroeder pointed out that the completion of the commercial maglev line that has first appeared in the world is a full embodiment of the close cooperation between Germany and China in the fields of economy, trade and high-tech. He said that the German government and the business community hope to keep long-term cooperation with China, so as to benefit both peoples."
