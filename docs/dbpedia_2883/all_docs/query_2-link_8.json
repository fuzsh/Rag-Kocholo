        "text": "* China: Shanghai: a maglev extension to Honquiao Airport, crossing the EXPO site. Extension of the existing Maglev line form Pudong-Airport to Longyang road underground station towards the new Honquiao Traffic hub with stops at the Expo2010 Area and Shanghai South Railway station. The new line is to be 36 km long.\n\nStatus: realization remains uncertain\n\n* China: Shanghai-Hangzhou Maglev: extension from Honquiao Airport to Hangzhou.\n\nTrain is a proposed maglev train line from Shanghai to Hangzhou, in eastern China. On 22 February 2006, the Chinese government decided to consider an extension of the current Transrapid Maglev line to Hangzhou, starting talks about the details of the construction contracts with Germany's Transrapid Konsortium (Transrapid International, mainly ThyssenKrupp and Siemens). Negotiation is still in progress.\n\nStatus: realization remains uncertain\n\n* Germany: Munich Maglev line.\n\nStatus: Abandoned in 2008.\n\n* Germany: Hamburg-Berlin\n\nA Transrapid maglev line between the two cities of Hamburg and Berlin was projected during the 90`s.The length of the line would have been 295 km and would have been the first inter city maglev line.At a maximum speed of 450 km/h the total distance would have been covered in 55 minutes. The planning for the project started in 1994, where the german Parliament gave the green light by making a special law for planning and building the Maglev line. A new vehicle, the Transrapid 08, was developed as well as a new type of hybrid guidway. Initially, construction was intended to start in 1999/2000, with the first parts of the line to be operable in 2005/2006. During the planning phase, the costs for the project rose by about 50%, and the number of passengers was assumed to be lower than originally expected.After a change in the Government in 1998 several debates about the future of the Hamburg-Berlin maglev lines were held, and in 2000, the project was officially stopped, with the argument it would be not cost efficient. Instead the existing railway was upgraded to accomodate speeds of 230 km/h, what caused several problems as the trains run directly throuhg villages and stations with platforms at top speed. The upgrade costed 450 million € in addition to a primary upgrade that was made several years ago and that lifted the speed on this line to 160 km/h. Both upgrades together costed around 600 mio €.\n\nStatus: Abandoned in 2000.\n\n* Germany: Metrorapid\n\nThe Metrorapid would have been a 80 km long maglev line for regional traffic and commuters. Therefore it would have had several stops. The maximum speed would have been 300 km/h and the train would have covered the 78,5 km in 37 minutes with stops at Dortmund, Bochum, Essen, Mülheim, Duisburg, Düsseldorf Airport and Düsseldorf. An extension to Cologne was also in the talks. The Project was abondoned in the year 2003, mainly with the argument that an upgrade of the existing railway would be cheaper and achieve the same effect. The alternative, \"Metro Express\" has not left the status of planning yet and the financing is also not solved.\n\nStatus: Abandoned in 2003.\n\n* India: Delhi - Mumbai.\n\nAs of 2007, the Indian Ministry is in the process of reviewing a proposal to start a Maglev train system in India. It has already been estimated that the cost to complete this process would be over $30 Billion. The company who sent the proposals is a company based in the United States. There have been feelers sent to the Railway Ministry, in which the advantages of a Maglev train system were presented. Although still at a preliminary stage, if completed, the train travel time between the two cities would be reduced to approximately three hours, compared to an original 16 hours.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* Iran: Tehran - Mashhad.\n\nIn Iran, a 800 km maglev line between Tehran and the holy city of Mashhad are under discussion. First studies are being carried out by a Munich based (German) engineering company.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* Japan: Japan Maglev|Chuo Shinkansen Tokyo - Osaka.\n\nIf the proposed Japan Chūō Shinkansen maglev line is built, it will connect Tokyo to Osaka, and the existing test track in Yamanashi prefecture would be part of the line. In March 2007, JR Tokai (Central Japan Railway Company) made clear that it will have a maglev rail built between Tokyo and Osaka by 2027. About 450km of magelv guideway will be placed between Tokyo and Osaka with a top speed of 581km/h. The trip will take a little less than one hour if the ambitious plan is realized.\n\nStatus: planned. Realization is likely.\n\n* North America (Canada / USA): Cascadia Maglev\n\nLong-proposed but not on any official drawing boards would be a Maglev line along the Interstate 5 corridor, its core component from Portland, Oregon to Vancouver, British Columbia, with eventual extensions to Eugene, Oregon (in the south) and Whistler, British Columbia (in the north). The initial phase of the project would link Tacoma to Seattle, mirroring the old interurban line between those two cities. The same idea has re-surfaced with a conventional high-speed rail proposal, although its extension into British Columbia has been largely blocked by opposition on the part of the City of White Rock, British Columbia, which would sit astride the line.\n\nStatus: blueprint, unlikely\n\n* Netherlands: Randstadt Rapid\n\nStatus: blueprint, unlikely\n\n* PAN-European Corridor No. IV: Berlin - Dresden - Prague - Vienna - Bratislava and Budapest.\n\nRecent plans call on a high-speed link connection along the PAN-European Corridor No. IV in middle and eastern europe. A first feasibility study both on maglev and steel-wheel technology has been finished (2007) for a line between Berlin (Germany) and Budapest, thereby linking major cities, including Dresden, Prague (Czech Republic), Vienna (Austria), Bratislava and Budapest (Hungary).\n\nStatus: blueprint of EU\n\n* Switzerland: Swissmetro.\n\nA system of Maglev trains linking the major cities in Switzerland has been proposed. The project is based on high-speed maglev trains travelling in low-pressure tunnels at about 1000 km/h. Such trains would significantly lower the travel time between major cities in Switzerland. For example, time between Bern and Zurich could be reduced from the present 60 minutes by intercity train to a mere 12 minutes.Conclusive simulation tests have been done by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL).\n\nStatus: realization is uncertain\n\n* South Korea: [[ROTEM|DaeJeon Maglev]].\n\nStatus: realization is under way.\n\n* United Kingdom: UK Ultraspeed\n\nA maglev line has been proposed by UK Ultraspeed in the United Kingdom from London to Glasgow with several route options through the Midlands, Northwest and Northeast of England and is reported to be under favourable consideration by the government. A further maglev link is also being planned between Glasgow Airport and Glasgow to Edinburgh Airport and Edinburgh which would cut journey time between the two cities from one hour to 15 minutes. The technology that will be used is likely to be the Transrapid System.\n\nStatus: planned. Realization is not unlikely.\n\n* USA: Atlanta-Chattanooga\n\nA maglev project based on the Transrapid system. The proposed maglev route would run from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, run through Atlanta, continue to the northern suburbs of Atlanta, and possibly even extend to Chattanooga, Tennessee. If built, the maglev line would rival Atlanta's current subway system, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), the rail system of which includes a major branch running from downtown Atlanta to Hartsfield-Jackson airport.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* USA: Baltimore-Washington D.C. Maglev\n\nA 64 km project has been proposed linking Camden Yards in Baltimore and Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport to Union Station in Washington, D.C. It is in demand for the area due to its current traffic/congestion problems. The Baltimore proposal is competing with the above-referenced Pittsburgh proposal for a $90 million federal grant.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* USA: California-Nevada Interstate Maglev\n\nHigh-speed maglev lines between major cities of southern California and Las Vegas are also being studied via the California-Nevada Interstate Maglev Project. This plan was originally supposed to be part of an I-5 or I-15 expansion plan, but the federal government has ruled it must be separated from interstate public work projects.Since the federal government decision, private groups from Nevada have proposed a line running from Las Vegas to Los Angeles with stops in Primm, Nevada; Baker, California; and points throughout Riverside County, into Los Angeles. Southern California politicians have not been too receptive to these proposals; many are concerned that a high speed rail line out of state would drive out dollars that would be spent in state \"on a rail\" to Nevada.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* USA: Honolulu\n\nThe city of Honolulu, Hawaii was considering a Linimo type urban Maglev for its main mass transit train.\n\nStatus: Realization unlikely.\n\n* USA: Pittsburgh Maglev\n\nThe Transrapid Pittsburgh project is considered the most advanced Maglev initiative in the U.S. (followed by the Las Vegas project). If federal funding should be finalized, these two markets could be the first to see Maglev in the United States. Initially, the Pittsburgh project calls for a transrapid system throughout the metro Pittsburgh area. Further planning calls for extensions eastward to Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Upon completion, a commute from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg would be reduced to 90-120 minutes. A commuter traversing the Pennsylvania Turnpike would currently spend approximately 5-6 hours completing the same commute.\n\nStatus: planned, under intense discussion\n\n* USA: San Diego Airport Maglev\n\nSan Diego is considering a high-speed maglev line to serve as a passenger transportation node to remote airport sites under consideration. The cost estimate is approximately $10 billion U.S. for the 120-150 km (80-100 mile) run, not including the cost of construction of the airport.\n\nStatus: blueprint\n\n* Venezuela: Caracas - La Guaira Maglev.\n\nA maglev train is scheduled to be built staring form 2007 connecting the capital city Caracas to the main port town of La Guaira and Simín Bolívar International Airport.\n\nStatus: blueprint, unlikely"
