        "text": "Andreas Rau (AR): The Max Bögl Group has been involved in magnetic train technology for over 20 years, focusing at the beginning on track systems for the high-speed maglev train Transrapid.\n\nThe development of the public transport magnetic railway system TSB began in 2010 and has now completed more than 130,000 shuttle runs on its own test track in [the German municipality of] Sengenthal, travelling more than 85,000km in fully automatic operation.\n\nDrawing from the experience of developing the Transrapid’s guideway structure, we recognised that is very important to handle the intersections between each component of such a system.\n\nThe company has therefore decided to develop its own solution for urban applications out of one source, with the result being a very efficient and competitive infrastructure.\n\nWhile the Transrapid is optimally designed for maximum-speed traffic on long-distance routes, the TSB is optimised for local transport. Both systems differ fundamentally.\n\nWith the TSB, the chassis and its active parts, such as the power electronics, are located within the track, encapsulated under 20cm-thick reinforced concrete. This minimises noise emissions, among other things.\n\nThe drive system is located within the vehicle, allowing short train headway times of only 80 seconds while the track is completely passive, allowing for track costs to be significantly reduced.\n\nSince a large part of the systems required for long-distance travel can be eliminated in local transport, the vehicle is lighter and has a greater payload.\n\nThe TSB shows its true strengths when high passenger flows must be managed very quietly, with high reliability and short implementation times. Compared with conventional systems, the TSB avoids high, concentrated loads at the contact point between wheel and rail.\n\nThe TSB distributes loads evenly on the track without contact, making it unbeatably quiet and low in vibration, and requiring much smaller structures for the track. This saves resources, costs and implementation time, and also provides aesthetic advantages.\n\nAmong the international markets, China is one of those with the greatest potential for the TSB.\n\nIn its five-year plan, the Beijing Government has committed to commissioning local transport projects with a total route length of 3,000km. In addition to fast growth, China is a competitive but very open-minded market for new technologies and has a large appetite for investment.\n\nThat’s why we are working with our local partner, the company Xinzhu, which is familiar with these unique conditions and can optimally represent the TSB.\n\nThere is a demand for a low-emission, flexible transit solution like never before, due to the fact that cities are growing and the megatrend of urbanisation tightens the availability of space.\n\nSo there is a high demand for public transit with its high capacities as the backbone of urban mobility while providing the opportunity for fast implementation. The energy consumption of the system is comparable to a conventional system like trams or metros, considering different horizontal and vertical alignments, [as well as] distances between stations and schedules.\n\n[It is more important] to increase the occupancy of the vehicles by enabling flexible adjustments of headways, and that is the reason why we developed the system from the beginning as a fully automated solution.\n\nAutomation will play a very important role, as will the ability to speed up construction and implementation times.\n\nWe believe that, in addition to ground level or underground transport, elevated transport can be a good solution offering the same capacities and advantages of underground transportation.\n\nIt requires rail systems that are very quiet and infrastructure with a slim and aesthetic design for integration into urban spaces. For long-distance traffic, rail-guided systems will be very important for environmentally friendly mobility in leisure and business traffic as an alternative for air traffic."
