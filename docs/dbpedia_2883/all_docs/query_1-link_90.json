        "text": "FRANKFURT, Sept. 22 — A futuristic high-speed train collided with a service vehicle during a test run on Friday in northwestern Germany, killing 23 people and dealing a setback to magnetic levitation technology, which aims to narrow the speed gap between trains and planes.\n\nThe train, carrying at least 29 passengers, slammed into the vehicle at a speed of 125 miles per hour, scattering wreckage, including seats and clothing, along the elevated concrete track, said the authorities in Lathen, a small town near the Dutch border.\n\nTen people were seriously injured, said Andrea Menke, a spokeswoman for the local police. About 400 rescue workers labored until nightfall to extract bodies from the wreckage. Among the victims were two maintenance workers, she said; their condition was unclear. “It’s been very difficult for the rescue workers, because the magnetic train is above the ground, which makes it hard to reach,” Ms. Menke said.\n\nThe death toll had originally been reported at 25 but was later reduced by police to 23. The victims included visitors and employees of the company that operates the train, known as Transrapid.\n\nIt was the first major accident involving a magnetic levitation, or maglev, train. The authorities declined to speculate on the cause, though experts on maglev technology said it appeared to have been a communications breakdown rather than a flaw in the technology.\n\nThe service vehicle, which performs routine maintenance each morning, had not left the track by 9:30 a.m., when the train began its journey on a 20-mile circuit that cuts through pastures and forests.\n\nTelevision film showed rescue workers and firefighters being hoisted up to the track by cranes to reach trapped victims. Though heavily damaged, the train did not derail.\n\nA marvel of German engineering, the Transrapid is a monorail that uses magnetic levitation technology to propel the train to speeds of up to 280 miles per hour. The train cars have no wheels or axles, but hover above the track, and are moved by magnetic force.\n\nThat accounts for why this train’s shattered cars remained on the elevated track, despite the force of a head-on collision that would almost certainly have thrown a regular train off the rails. “The magnetic field under the Transrapid is very strong, and keeps the train on the track, even if it is going 400 kilometers per hour,” said Hartmut Müller-Gerbes, a spokesman for TUV Rheinland, a testing company that inspects the test track in Lathen.\n\nDeveloped in the 1970’s and 80’s, maglev technology was supposed to power the next generation of high-speed trains in Germany. But fears about its expense led the government to choose more conventional trains, and Transrapid is now primarily an export technology.\n\nThe government wants to build a maglev train between the Munich airport and the center of the city. But Bavarian officials said they would re-think the plan in light of the crash.\n\nThe only commercial use of the train is in China, where passengers can make the 20-mile trip from the financial district in downtown Shanghai to the airport in Pudong in less than eight minutes. In August, one of those trains filled with smoke because of an overheated battery; there were no injuries.\n\nGerman leaders have promoted the train as an emblem of the country’s healthy trade relationship with China. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, have joined Chinese officials for well-publicized rides on the Shanghai train during visits to China.\n\nTransrapid is a joint venture of the engineering company Siemens and the steelmaker ThyssenKrupp. Even before the accident, there were reports that Thyssen was considering pulling out of the venture.\n\nAdvocates of the trains argued that the crash, horrifying as it was, should not undermine the technology. “It’s no different than if you land an airplane and there is something parked on the runway,” said Kevin C. Coates, a transportation consultant in Bethesda, Md., and a former spokesman for Transrapid. “It’s going to take a lot to convince me this technology is not safe.”"
