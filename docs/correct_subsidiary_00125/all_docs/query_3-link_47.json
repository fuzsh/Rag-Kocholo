Merger & Acquisitions by Big IT Companies A study to identify the trend and strategy Prof. R. Srinivasan (CSP) Naveen Kumar K E (2008040) Satyajit Paul (2008046) Date – 19-Mar-2011 PGSEM Final Year Project\n\n2. Project Overview Understanding the strategies of the large Tech Companies by analyzing their acquisitions. Our study should help us develop an in depth understanding about the emerging technology trends & innovation and how those technology trends & innovation influenced the strategies of large technology companies. Methodologies  Selection of companies based on predefined criterion.  Data Collection Sources include company websites, Press Releases, SDC, Gartner Press Releases, Data Monitor.  Study the individual companies.  Develop the Taxonomy of Software Companies and find the market size.  Fit them into the Taxonomy of Software Companies.  Study the acquisitions of the companies over last 5 to 7 years  Study some of the high growth segments.  Observations & Insights.  Predictions.\n\n3. Selected Companies Hewlett-Packard IBM Microsoft Oracle Dell Cisco Systems Intel SAP EMC Criterion Used for filtration •Fortune Top 100 companies by Revenue. •Fortune Top 50 companies by Market Value. •Fortune Top Computer Software Companies. •Fortune Top IT Services Companies. •Companies having operations in India.\n\n4. Worldwide IT Spending Longer-term, server spending will be curtailed by virtualization, consolidation and, potentially, cloud computing. The infrastructure market (all the software to build, run and manage an enterprise) is the largest segment in terms of revenue and the fastest-growing through the 2014. The hottest software segments through 2014 include virtualization, security, data integration/data quality and business intelligence. Web conferencing, team collaboration and enterprise content management are forecast to have double-digit compound annual growth rates (CAGR), in the face of growing competition surrounding social networking and content.\n\n5.

Company Analysis - Microsoft • No big ticket acquisition but lot of small acquisitions, attempted Yahoo! buy. • Strong Presence in all the segments of Enterprise Software & Development Tools. • Enjoys the competitive advantage due to the use of in-house closed technology. • It has created a niche and enjoys monopoly in that space leading to extra-normal profit on all it’s softwareofferings. • High focus on Mobility and Entertainment Business. • One stop shop. 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Entertainment and Devices Division Microsoft Business Division Online Services Division Server and Tools Windows & Windows Live Division 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 18,000 20,000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Windows & Windows Live Division Server and Tools Online Services Division Microsoft Business Division Entertainment and Devices Division\n\n18.

Insights  IBM & Oracle stands out in managing acquisitions well including divestitures.  IBM is best positioned for one-stop-shop offerings to large enterprise customers.  Oracle is one-stop-shop in making. It lacks Services offering in order to grab big scale enterprise deals.  Cisco, EMC and Intel – a significant strategic alliance in making, will give IBMs and HPs run in Storage and Cloud space.  HP & Dell lacks strategic direction in the acquisitions.  Microsoft has most coherent cloud strategy for the end users – both SMEs and large enterprises.\n\n30.

Predictions  Oracle going for acquisition of a Services company that can provide scale – CSC is a good choice.  HP & SAP forming strategic alliance – while HP lacks middleware and Software, SAP can not really pitch against Oracle and IBM due to lack of depth in it’s offerings. So, it has choice to remain a focused player or need to forge alliance with a large Server/Storage vendor.  Dell acquiring Citrix. With EqualLogic and Compellent buys Dell is well placed in Server and storage. However Dell & Citrix would be strong alternative to EMC+Vmware, particularly in wake of it’s straining relation with EMC after Compellent buy.\n\n33. Emerging Trends • Consumer Computing moving to mobile and tablets. Its is experiencing explosive growth as never before. • Enterprise Computing moving to Cloud – Public Cloud as well as Private Cloud. • SMEs are ahead in adopting Cloud based Software Service, while Large Corporates prefer to have Private Cloud. • Private Cloud will experience higher growth over the Public Cloud. • Virtualization seems to be the hottest of all segments. • Storage is experiencing explosive growth driven by growth in social networking, videos and other user driven data (10x by 2011, 44x by 2020). • Security remains elusive for most of the vendors, remains the biggest concern for the corporates and potentially may slow down the growth of Cloud based computing.\n\n34.
