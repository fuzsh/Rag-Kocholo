        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., - December 19, 2007 - Cisco® today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Navini Networks, Inc., a leader in the Mobile WiMAX 802.16e-2005 broadband wireless industry. Navini is a pioneer in the integration of \"Smart Beamforming\" technologies with Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) antennas, a combination that improves the performance and range for WiMAX services and lowers the overall deployment and operational costs for service providers.\n\nNavini's WiMAX products will extend Cisco's market-leading Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi-Mesh portfolios, allowing Cisco to uniquely address the rapidly growing markets for portable broadband services. The acquisition will also help extend and enhance Cisco's Internet Protocol Next Generation Network (IP NGN) vision and will help drive broadband penetration to consumers and businesses in emerging countries.\n\nCisco selected Navini based on its industry-leading product portfolio, unmatched innovation and its real-world commercial deployments with service provider customers worldwide. Navini offers a leading portfolio of broadband WiMAX solutions with comprehensive offerings including base stations, adaptive antenna arrays, management systems and subscriber modems.\n\nCisco plans to integrate Navini into its Wireless Technology Group, under the Access Networking and Services Group."
