He also consults and does all the network engineering work for several other local ISP and WISPs, again, all using Mikrotik Router OS. Presentation Overview: The presentation I will be giving is a low level overview of the competition, costs, and needs of small to medium Businesses. Reviewing several key features in the Mikrotik we will show how the RouterOS can be a very powerful router/access device in these environments. We will also show a small group of dealerships in the St. Louis area that uses Mikrotik to interconnect all of its dealerships, and ensure reliable service, in a small case study. If your focus is to sell the RouterOS to individual companies, then this low level overview will show you some of the basic capabilities that the RouterOS can do, and show you the cost differences between other competitive Routers on the market.\n\nAlternative power solutions for MikroTik sites\n\nMark Billets, (Denver, CO, USA) Product Specialist for Electro-Comm Distributing.
