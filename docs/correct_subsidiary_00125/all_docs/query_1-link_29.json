        "text": "Networking giant Cisco has acquired Navini, a leader in the emerging WiMax broadband space, for US$330 million. Cisco says the mobile broadband capability will enhance its next generation IP network capabilities.\n\nCisco says the acquisition of Navini – whose products are distributed in Ireland by Irish Broadband – will form a central part of its vision to deliver any data service to any device over any network. Cisco calls this vision Connected Life.\n\nThe California headquartered networking player said it selected Texas-based Navini because of its product portfolio and real-world commercial deployment. The company’s modems, base stations, antennas and management systems have been rolled out by more than 75 broadband providers around the world.\n\nCisco says that its wireless broadband portfolio, now including WiMax, will play a key role in its Country Transformation and “digital inclusion” initiatives to drive broadband adoption in emerging countries and economies.\n\n“Emerging country service providers are in expansion mode, building out broadband wireless networks and are concerned about deployment costs and the availability of skilled resources,” said Brett Galloway, vice-president and general manager of the wireless networking business unit, Cisco.\n\n“Around the world broadband wireless networks based upon WiMax have the potential to add millions of new internet users who cannot be reached economically using copper or fiber infrastructures.\n\n“Additionally, WiMax networks will help drive the transition to open IP-based broadband wireless architectures and accelerate the rollout of new applications and services,” Galloway said.\n\nThe acquisition of Navini, which will be integrated into Cisco’s wireless networking business unit, will be number 124 for Cisco.\n\nBy John Kennedy"
