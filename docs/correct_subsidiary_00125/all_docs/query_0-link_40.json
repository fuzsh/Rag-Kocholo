It is just, because it is an important entry of a Cray Computer, which remains invisible in Solus. This Cray seem to come from London. But more is not to find out. I only wanted to know, why it was invisible here ?! (Seems to be a machine of gov ... )\n\ndschinn1001 You aren't reading this output correctly. \"CrayComm_11:39:96\" is a MAC address starting with 00:00:80 and ending with 11:39:96, put together as 00:00:80:22:39:96. This is just wireshark trying to be clever because many hardware vendors use a fixed sequence at the start of their MAC addresses. Examples:\n\nHonestly dude, you need to quit being so paranoid. You immediately jump to the conclusion that someone is poking around your machine that shouldn't be, and to date that hasn't proven to be true even once.\n\nYes thank you, you are right. I should not to assume too quickly something suspicious looking after a certain conspiracy in Linux machine. But I was thinking that a Cray Computer is nothing unexceptional. Well, in future I try not to aussume too quickly ..."
