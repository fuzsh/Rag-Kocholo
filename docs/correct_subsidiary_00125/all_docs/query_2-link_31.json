In the prior week there were the same number of transactions — 36 — but their total worth was 18 percent lower.\n\nThe leading deal was the $6.67-billion sale of Washington-state utility Puget Energy Inc. to a consortium of Australian and Canadian interests led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. In the second-largest buyout, Houston-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) company Goodman Global Inc. went to Hellman & Friedman LLC for $2.56 billion. In the third of the 10 largest North American deals last week, investor Kirk Kerkorian’s Tracinda Corp. bought 16 percent of San Antonio-based energy company Tesoro Corp. for $1.4 billion, according to data provided to CFO.com by mergermarket.\n\nThe week’s deals brought year-to-date M&A activity to $1.40 trillion, compared to $1.15 trillion through Oct. 28, 2006. There have been 3,796 proposals so far in 2007, down from 4,038 at the same time last year.\n\nMacquarie Bank, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, British Columbia Investment Management Corp., and Alberta Investment Management to buy Puget Energy for $6.67 billion\n\nThe consortium of “infrastructure investors” offered $30 a share for Bellevue, Wash.-based Puget Energy, a premium of 25.3 percent.

The Macquarie Infrastructure Partners unit of Australia’s Macquarie Bank has joined with the Toronto-based Canadian pension-plan board and the Victoria-based British Columbia Investment Management and Alberta-based Alberta Investment Management for the deal.
