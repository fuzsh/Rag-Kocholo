        "text": "According to a 2016 study by Accenture, excellent patient experience increases hospital revenue by 50%. NarrativeDx achieves these outcomes by partnering with healthcare organizations, patient experience and informatics leaders, and consultancies to identify key issues across departments and providers based on patient comments. These actionable insights inform human-centered solutions that improve care experiences, increase revenue, and boost referrals for a thriving healthcare system.\n\n\"We are using AI to improve healthcare experiences in a way that has never been done before,\" said Kyle Robertson, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, NarrativeDx. \"Our partners have been eager to leverage our technology to better understand their patients' experiences. The demand we are seeing is phenomenal, and we are on track to increase our client base 10x in 2017.\"\n\nThe NarrativeDx AI platform analyzes comments at a per-phrase level and identifies sentiment, named doctors and nurses, key themes, procedures, and even readmission risks from complex patient comments. The technology is proven to improve patient experience measures by 80 percent, and increase outpatient referrals by over $50 million.\n\n\"NarrativeDx has built a one-of-a kind analytics engine for narrative patient experience data,\" said Senem Guney, PhD, Founder and Chief Experience Officer, NarrativeDx. \"Our company was founded on the simple principle that patient voices matter, and by uncovering important insights from patients' own words about their experiences, we can make a meaningful improvement in the delivery of patient-centered care that brings value to the patient-consumer.\"\n\nFounded in 2014 by AI engineer and IP lawyer, Kyle Robertson, JD, and Senem Guney, PhD, NarrativeDx has seen steady growth in patient experience, and the financing will further support the company as it continues to invest heavily in product innovation and improving the patient experience.\n\n\"With NarrativeDx, it's like having a data scientist on our team,\" said Bridget Alston, Director of Patient Experience at HackensackUMC Palisades, a NarrativeDX customer. \"I have been able to shift from hours behind a desk collecting and analyzing comments to being out where I need to be with patients, staff and physicians. The NarrativeDx AI platform bridges the gap between quantitative data and qualitative data, and gives us actionable insights that we can prioritize and put into practice.\"\n\n\"As a Seed Round investor, we are excited to follow-on our initial confidence in the NarrativeDx team by leading this Series A Round,\" said Ben Scott, General Partner of LiveOak Venture Partners. \"With the best technical team in the industry, we strongly believe in their approach and are convinced that NarrativeDx has the ability to positively transform the patient experience and quickly boost hospital reputations.\"\n\n\"We are excited to work with NarrativeDx to see their innovative artificial intelligence technology reach its full potential,\" said Mark Bakken, Managing Partner of HealthX Ventures. \"We see great opportunity with tools that can help hospitals manage and improve their most important relationships â€“ those they have with their patients.\"\n\nAbout NarrativeDx\n\nNarrativeDx, based in Austin, TX, is the artificial intelligence platform for patient experience.
