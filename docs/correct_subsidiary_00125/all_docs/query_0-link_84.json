Understandably, investors are downbeat on this purchase, with the Cisco stock down 4% and Splunk up 28%.\n\nWill this make Cisco a software leader, with its SDN thrust, or a big cybersecurity player?\n\nDuring my stay with Cisco, it demonstrated vision with focus on the video and visual networking.\n\nBut a lack of vision was evident in its purchase of Navini Networks when Wimax was already dying. Pure Digital, makers of Flip camera, was another failed acquistion as smartphones were then beginning to integrate high-end cameras. I bought a Flip then and hardly used it.\n\nScientific Atlanta was then the company’s biggest acquisition. I didn’t see it fully integrated into Cisco. Linksys was in the Cisco stable for a few years before it was sold.\n\nCompanies flush with cash do tend to squander it away through unhealthy acquisitions. The advantage is that they help bring in good talent.\n\nAll of it makes me think once a visionary company need not necessarily remain one for ever!"
