        "text": "The new data center platform with both hardware and software\n\ninnovations, including:\n\n· The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, the flagship data center-class switching platform\n\ncombining Ethernet, IP, and storage capabilities across one unified network fabric\n\n· The Cisco Trusted Security (TrustSec) architecture\n\n· An operating system, the Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS), and the\n\nCisco Data Center Network Manager\n\nThe Cisco Nexus 7000 Series is the flagship member of the Cisco Nexus Family, the first in a\n\nnew data center class of switching products. The Nexus 7000 is a highly scalable modular\n\nplatform that delivers up to 15 terabits per second of switching capacity in a single chassis,\n\nsupporting up to 512 10-gigabits-per-second (Gbps) Ethernet and future delivery of 40- and 100-\n\nGbps Ethernet. Its unified fabric architecture combines Ethernet and storage capabilities into a\n\nsingle platform, designed to provide all servers with access to all network and storage resources.\n\nThis enables data center consolidation and virtualization. Key components of the unified fabric\n\narchitecture include unified I/O interfaces and Fibre Channel over Ethernet support to be\n\ndelivered in the future.\n\nThe Nexus 7000 is designed specifically for the data center with improved airflow, integrated\n\ncable management, and a resilient platform architecture. The data plane is fully distributed and,\n\nwhen coupled with the Cisco NX-OS operating system, is designed to enable zero servicedisruption\n\nupgrades on production systems. This provides a seamless systems design that reduces\n\nadministrative tasks and simplifies complex systems operations.\n\nBuilding data centers based on a unified fabric eliminates the need for parallel storage and\n\ncomputational networks, reducing the number of server interfaces and significantly reducing the\n\ncabling and switching infrastructure required. A unified fabric also enables customers to move to\n\nhigher-density server form factors, increasing the IT workload output of each data center.\n\nCombined with virtualization, this new technology will help customers to build more efficient\n\nand sustainable data centers, maximizing IT workload for each facility and saving more power\n\noverall than the network generally consumes. The Nexus 7000 architecture is designed around\n\nthis lossless unified fabric capable of simultaneously forwarding storage, Ethernet, and IP traffic.\n\nThe fabric scales performance linearly with each fabric module and is logically partitioned for\n\nefficient unicast and multicast traffic, making it ideally suited for market data video as well as\n\ncollaboration applications.\n\nMicrosoft is currently performing rigorous testing of the Nexus 7000 Series for security,\n\nmanageability and performance in a lab environment. “We appreciate the modular processes of\n\nthe Cisco Nexus operating system designed to resolve problems in real time without impact to\n\nproduction traffic, as well as data center-class high-availability features and unified fabric\n\nsupport,” said Debra Chrapaty, corporate vice president, Global Foundation Services, Microsoft.\n\nAt the heart of the Nexus 7000 Series is the NX-OS software, purpose-built to maximize data\n\ncenter resiliency and to consolidate disparate networks. NX-OS combines the best of Cisco’s\n\nSAN-OS, Layer 2 switching, Layer 3 routing protocols, and advanced virtualization capabilities\n\ninto one reliable operating system with the familiar Cisco IOS® interface.\n\nNX-OS has many innovative features, including:\n\n• Zero-service-disruption upgrades\n\n• Virtual device contexts\n\n• Graceful systems operations\n\n• XML interfaces to access switch information or any command\n\nNX-OS delivers zero-service-disruption system upgrades to maximize production uptime while\n\nself-diagnostic capabilities continuously track each software component in the operating system.\n\nIf a failure is detected, NX-OS policies enable stateful process restart without service disruption.\n\nThis modular design provides fault containment and automatic recovery so that processes can be\n\nremotely started, stopped and upgraded without human intervention.\n\nInnovative virtualization capabilities such as virtual device contexts allow the system to be\n\npartitioned into multiple logical devices, each with its own processes and command-line\n\ninterface running independent of one another. This system may be used by hosting providers and\n\ncomplex enterprise administrative models, to be shared by multiple administrators concurrently,\n\neach with its own switching environment.\n\nSecuring the Data Center with Cisco Trusted Security\n\nThe Nexus 7000 Series is the first platform to deliver Cisco Trusted Security, a new architecture\n\nintroduced last month that integrates identity- and role-based security across data centers. (See\n\nnews release at http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/prod_120507.html.) Cisco TrustSec\n\nenforces trusted traffic segmentation without requiring complex addressing models and\n\nunmanageable access control lists. This enables virtual machine mobility throughout the data\n\ncenter while helping to ensure data integrity with a wire-rate AES-128 encryption\n\nimplementation on every port of the Nexus 7000.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has\n\nreviewed the new Cisco data center switch for the high performance computing systems\n\nscientists employ for national security research. Applications such as research in fusion energy,\n\natmospheric modeling, and the simulation of other physical phenomena, can benefit greatly from\n\nincreased network bandwidth for data movement between parallel file systems and archival\n\nstorage.\n\nCisco Data Center Network Manager\n\nSupporting the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, the Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)\n\nprovides visibility across data center networks. Built on the foundation of Cisco Fabric Manager for storage networks, DCNM provides topology discovery and visualization for increased\n\noperational efficiency and systems awareness. Nexus 7000 management interfaces are fully\n\ncompatible with Cisco VFrame Data Center, an orchestration platform that uses network\n\nintelligence to provision resources together as virtualized services. VFrame DC will be a key\n\nenabler for services orchestration on the Nexus platform."
