Please enclose a note &/or business card with any additional information youâ€™d like me to know/add to blog posting.\n\nYou can send items to:\n\nAccessAgility LLC\n\nATTN: Free Shirt Friday\n\n8601 Westwood Center Drive Suite 250\n\nVienna, VA 22182\n\nMotorola WiNG 5 WLAN Solution\n\nMotorola will be announcing their new WiNG 5 WLAN solution at a media event on October 5th, 2010 in Boston.\n\n“WiNG 5 wireless LAN solutions place the brainpower of a wireless controller into every access point to better route data and deliver security, mobility services and quality of service.\n\nMany customers are now deploying 802.11n networks and also using more robust, media-rich wireless applications. But as their networks get loaded with traffic, they canâ€™t take full advantage of higher 802.11n speeds if theyâ€™re still using the typical legacy WLAN architectureâ€”although thatâ€™s exactly what most of our major competitors are selling.\n\nThe problem is that todayâ€™s typical WLAN architecture follows a â€œhub and spokeâ€ model which centralizes intelligence in WLAN controller. As growing wireless traffic routes through the WLAN controller, the increased high-bandwidth demands create a bottleneck at the controller, slowing the network for everyone and degrading service for latency-sensitive voice and streaming video apps. Our competitorsâ€™ answer is to add more controllers which adds cost.\n\nOur new WiNG 5 WLAN gives a better answer: distribute the intelligence. Make the access points network-aware and let them route their own traffic. Let them provide QoS, security and mobility services without going back to the controller. No more bottleneck means a faster network. And because network-aware APs route traffic around any problem areas, the network is more reliable.”\n\nAs hinted in video below the new WiNG 5 WLAN solution has better support for 802.11n by using a distributed architecture.\n\nHub and Spoke vs. WiNG 5 Architecture\n\nSee graphic from Motorola below illustrating the advantages of moving from a hub and spoke to a distributed architecture.\n\nWardriving At Ekoparty Conference In Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n“ekoparty – Electronic Knock Out Party – Security Conference, is a one of a kind event in South America; an annual security conference held in Buenos Aires where security specialists from all over Latin America (and beyond) have the chance to get involved with state-of-art techniques, vulnerabilities and tools in a relaxed environment never seen before.”\n\nWardriving + Tourism At Ekoparty\n\nAt Ekoparty one event that mixes tourism and security is a Wardrive around the City of Buenos Aries.\n\n“We are goning out on a van around Buenos Aires to discover WiFi accesses and draw a map pointing where they are. Those who want to participate should bring their notebook or equipament with the necessary software (and hardware). Any way who don’t bring these devices can enjoy a turistic tour and know a little more about our loved city.”\n\nCheckout image below from a 2008 Ekoparty Wardrive.\n\nI have always wanted travel to South America. This may a good way to mix business and tourism. I missed the conference this year but maybe in 2011 I can attend Ekoparty."
