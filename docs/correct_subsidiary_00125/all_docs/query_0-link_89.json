        "text": "Thermo to build clinical trial facility in India\n\nWALTHAM - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. yesterday said it has broken ground on a $17 million facility in Ahmadabad, India, to support growing demand for biopharma services in that country. The 100,000-square-foot facility will focus on packaging, distribution and logistics management of regulated pharmaceutical samples to patients participating in clinical trials worldwide. The site, scheduled to open this spring and employ about 100 people, will complement existing operations in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nWestborough firm reports order from major utility\n\nWESTBOROUGH - American Superconductor Corp. yesterday said it has received a multimillion-dollar order from a major U.S. utility for 150 of the company's Static VAR Compensator systems, which are used to control voltage in power grids. Details about the customer and value of the order were not disclosed.\n\nAmtrak carries record 25.8 million people in FY07\n\nWASHINGTON - A record 25.8 million passengers took Amtrak in the last fiscal year, an increase of 1.5 million over fiscal 2006, the national passenger railroad said yesterday. Ridership for the year ended Sept. 30 surpassed the previous record of 25.03 million set in 2004, before Amtrak transferred some services to a commuter rail operator. Ticket revenue at the federally subsidized company increased 11 percent to $1.5 billion from $1.37 billion in 2006. The Northeast saw the biggest leap in revenue, by 14 percent to $829.3 million, Amtrak said. The Acela Express, Amtrak's high-speed Boston-Washington service, experienced a 20 percent jump in ridership to 3.1 million passengers and a 23 percent increase in revenue to $403.5 million.\n\nUtility, energy company plan power deal in Conn.\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. - United Illuminating Co. and NRG Energy Inc. have proposed investing as much as $700 million in a partnership to build power plants in Connecticut to supply electricity during peak periods of demand. The proposal will be submitted to state regulators early next year and plants could operate in 2009. It would bring a utility back into the generation business for the first time since the General Assembly deregulated utilities in 1999. Utilities have since focused only on distributing electricity.\n\nCisco Systems purchase aimed at WiMax networks\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. - Cisco Systems Inc. is snapping up privately held Navini Networks Inc. for $330 million, providing the latest validation for the new wireless network technology called WiMax. Cisco, the world's largest maker of routers and switches to direct traffic over the Internet, said yesterday that Navini's technology will help it build high-speed Internet networks deep in emerging markets where traditional Internet infrastructure doesn't exist or is spotty.\n\nWal-Mart: Sales growth to slow during next 3 years\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. will cut back on spending to build new stores and tighten cost controls as sales growth slows over the next three years, Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe told investors and analysts at a conference yesterday. Schoewe trimmed plans for capital expenditures for the second time this year, to about $15 billion from a June forecast of $15.5 billion. The original projection was $17 billion. Analysts welcomed the move to focus on keeping more of the cash Wal-Mart generates rather than spending furiously on new stores.\n\nNike to buy U.K. soccer supplier Umbro for $582 million\n\nLONDON - Nike Inc. will acquire Britain's Umbro PLC for $582 million, the companies announced yesterday, as the U.S. apparel and shoe maker seeks a larger presence on soccer fields worldwide. Umbro, based in Cheadle, northwest England, designs, sources and markets soccer-related apparel, footwear and equipment sold in more than 90 countries. The acquisition is a major strategic development for Nike, which has said it wants to become the sport's top brand by the next World Cup in 2010. Nike said it intended to operate Umbro as an independent, U.K.-based subsidiary, like its Converse brand based in North Andover, Mass.\n\n(Daily News and Associated Press reports)"
