        "text": "Meraki in the Enterprise ASTERISK\n\nJune 21, 2023 by Sam Clements\n\nIf two decades in the VAR space teaches you anything, it’s that if you want to challenge yourself, learn to say yes, then qualify the relevance of that “yes” to the proposed question. One of the most heavily asterisk’d responses I’ve had to give in the past is in response to the question, “Is Meraki right for the Enterprise”, and I’m of the opinion that it’s high time we start leaving the asterisk off. Look, I’ve been a proponent of Meraki since prior to the Cisco acquisition, but let’s be honest, I’ve clarified that “asterisk’d Yes” in many ways over the years:\n\nIs Meraki right for the Enterprise? Yes*\n\nOver the years you may recall such greats as:\n\n*But they don’t have external antennas, so challenging RF environments are out!\n\nShortly after acquisition, Meraki did indeed role out External antenna support for their indoor portfolio and it’s been a part of the portfolio since!\n\n*But they don’t have firmware update controls or release notes\n\nMeraki has now one of the best software image management functions available. Or if you’re like most folks, you just want the peace of mind knowing you can refer to it after you’ve set it and forgotten it.\n\n*But they don’t have a way to turn off 2.4GHz radios or have RF profiles so challenging RF environments are still out!\n\nAdoption of RF Profies in the dashboard with no on-premises hardware changes or updates? All delivered seamlessly as part of a dashboard update – and you didn’t have to do anything to get it.\n\n*But they don’t have high gain antennas so challenging RF environments are still still out!\n\nWith Smart Antennas, Meraki is able to use the same RP-TNC connectors as other antennas, but this hardware level innovation never got much attention despite the fact that it enabled more complex designs with regulatory compliance assurance.\n\n*But the operating temperature of the AP is on the weak side and I’m concerned that they’ll melt in the rafters long term (or really any other AP centric “quality concern” that could be raised) so challenging RF environments are still still still out!\n\nMeraki adopting the Cisco AP portfolio for a unified approach to the hardware handily assuaged *many* concerns throughout the industry. Meraki APs were fine, but this makes is easy to reconcile for the field. If you can put a Cisco AP in a challenging RF environment, you can put a Meraki AP there now (since they’re the same thing)!.\n\n*But RRM! The Cloud simply can’t do as good of a job at challenging RF environments as my WLCs RRM so challenging RF environments are still still still still out!\n\nAt Mobility Field Day, Cisco showed off a unified RRM control plane feature that is a standalone RRM function that either your on premises controllers can use or your Meraki dashboard can use. The goal here is that regardless of the management platform (DNA Center or Meraki dashboard), you should be able to adopt an RRM system that works consistently across both platforms.\n\n*But centralized Data Plane/VLANs/tunneling/<other WLC centric concern here> means I have to abandon the Meraki dashboard, so clearly campus enterprise is out!\n\nWell, this is one that has been sticking in my craw for years, I’ll admit. It wasn’t until last years Catalyst portfolio transition for the Meraki wireless offering, that I had any hope that we’d see what I call “good” guidance on the topic. This has always left Campus Enterprise customers out in the wind to some degree or another. That was until I saw with my very own eyes Meraki pulling a Catalyst 9800 WLC into the dashboard for monitoring. Now, there’s a lot to unpack here and when I first saw this I had about a billion questions. Like:\n\n1) What do you mean I can have my 9800 controllers in the Meraki cloud?\n\nThis one I just had to have clarification on – it finally delivers on a huge part of the Meraki/Catalyst integration and yes, you can simply add your WLCs to the dashboard. You then get AP insights (they look just like a Meraki AP!) and of course all of that delicious client info. In short, add your WLCs to the dashboard and you have instantly massive insight into your clients and infrastructure. All without making any changes on your WLC!\n\n2) I’ve been in the dashboard, and there’s no way I can configure all the same things as I need on my 9800 there. How limited am I going to find myself here?\n\nWell, the good news on that front is that for now, this is monitoring only – you retain all of your 9800 functionality and do all of your configuration still on the 9800 directly – no loss of features since there really isn’t much to do from the dashboard once you’ve added it other than bask in the glory of the insights!\n\n3) Monitor only? What if I want to configure my 9800 from the dashboard and I can’t?\n\nWell yes – that is the current state of the integration – but believe me when I say, the trajectory that Cisco laid out at MFD is clear – Meraki and Catalyst everywhere that DNA Center is “too much”. I think it’s safe to assume that based on the current features available across the EN portfolio (especially on the MS and MR platforms) integrated into the dashboard – that Cisco isn’t done here.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on on your definition of Enterprise requirements (campus or otherwise), it’s clear that if you haven’t been watching the Meraki integrations happening over at Cisco, you really need to spend some time making sure that any of those pesky preconceived blockers you may have in the past aren’t quite so show-stopping now a days…\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the great times\n\nJanuary 30, 2021 by Sam Clements\n\nCisco posted the EOS notices for their stalwart Wireless LAN Controllers yesterday, covering the 5520 and the 8540 (and VM). This, coupled with the EOS notice for the 3504 model just the week prior marks the end of all of the hardware/virtual AireOS controllers from Cisco. It’s worth noting that the embedded AireOS (called Mobility Express) is not included in this months announcements. Mobility Express aside, this marks an ending of an era that began with the Aironet acquisition by Cisco in 1999. 22 years of service out of an acquisition is a pretty good run if you ask me. As I reflect on the past two decades, we’ve seen a ton of changes – not only on the Cisco front, but industry wide. We saw 802.11 evolve from hotspot networks of connivence to being mission critical, redundancy focused, pervasive solutions that our business critical applications rely on. We’ve also seen an industry where every single enterprise WLAN only manufacturer has been absorbed by those looking to address “access layer” technologies all in, regardless of physical medium. We saw Cisco mature the Wi-Fi portfolio with some pretty significant milestones:\n\nMigration of APs running VxWorks to Cisco IOS\n\nCisco acquire meraki for their Cloud infrastructure offering\n\nRolling some pretty awesome tech from Navini into the core product offering (Beamforming)\n\nTurning “real” spectrum analyzers from Cognio into everyday table stakes (CleanAir still can’t be beat!)\n\n26 major WLC releases in the AireOS family (more on this below)\n\nConverged Access (although we largely gloss over this milestone)\n\nCisco APs migrate from IOS to AP-COS (with it’s heritage in ClickOS from the meraki acquisition)\n\nWCS to NCS to Prime Infrastructure to DNA Center management platforms\n\nMerchant silicon from the 1242 days to custom silicone in Marvell radios, and back again to QCA/BCM based solutions intermixed with custom RF ASIC\n\nDriving fixes back into 802.11 through custom Wi-Fi extensions in the CCX program (802.11r and others)\n\nCountless forays into industrial and outdoor Wi-Fi solutions along with some pretty cool innovations (PRP over Wi-Fi, FSR, MRC, and on and on…)\n\nCisco transitioning their core WLC architecture over to IOS-XE and not screwing it up (frankly, like everyone expected them to do)\n\nI’ll admit, it’s easy to beat up on Cisco – they’re a large target – but the fact remains that a very large percentage of Wi-Fi in the world today is driven by AireOS networks and it’s worth stopping down for a moment to acknowledge that Cisco devoted well over two decades of development and maturity into the product. Since we’re looking at the close of a generation, I wanted to share a list I’ve been working on for sometime now that marks each and every AireOS code name and the version/release it went with. It’s well known that the AireOS founder is enamored with wineries so all major release has been named after a winery – and here they all are, in alphabetical order:\n\nWhen Cisco launched the Catalyst 9800 almost two years ago, it was well acknowledged that they actually delayed the release more than once to allow time for the product to mature – integrating 2 decades of features into a new product take time and I must admit, Cisco has done a pretty fantastic job of keeping new features rolling over the past two years in both AireOS and cat9800 platforms – something that’s difficult to do (especially as we reflect on Converged Access). With this weekends announcements, it’s safe to say that new APs from this point forward will require Catalyst 9800 WLCs. Consider yourself warned, especially as we look into 2021 and 2022 with every one eyes forward on getting to 6GHz (Wi-Fi 6e). If you’re still on AireOS, regardless of where you may be in it’s (which has been significant), the not-so-new-anymore kid on the block is the Catalyst 9800 WLC. I won’t gush on endlessly about what others have written, but suffice it to say, if you’re not getting on the 9800 bandwagon, you’re being left behind. Get up on the IOS-XE based 9800 sooner rather than later and start understanding how your migration looks, especially around models of APs that are supported. Check out the EOS notices for the 3504, 5520, 8540, and Virtual WLC at these links, and check out some of the CCIE preparedness videos I helped with here. Regardless of where you’re at on your journey, if you’ve got virtualization resources available to you – you really should be running a 9800 in a lab, or really anywhere you can.\n\nManagement Frame Detection?\n\nAugust 30, 2018 by scwifi\n\nNope! But MFD does stand for something even more exciting! Mobility Field Day (3!) is just around the corner! As a long time delegate with a few minutes to burn on the family PTO trip, I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on the upcoming event. As you can see from the Tech Field Day page there are tons of great sponsors lined up. Here is my take on the coming week, the sponsors strengths, weaknesses, and what I’d like to see. In order of presentation:\n\nArista (http://techfieldday.com/companies/arista-networks/, @AristaNetworks)\n\nArista has made a splash in the Wi-Fi space with their recent acquisition of Mojo Networks (nee: AirTight). I’m happy to see Mojo get scooped up, especially in the ever diminishing landscape of infrastructure providers especially since they have a strong story about ‘hardware agnostic’ solutions. Their story since the AirTight days has been one of open platforms and this strength has carried them to the success they’ve had so far. Arista has not. Admittedly I’m not a strong Data Center switch guy, but I don’t see a similar story of how the open, commodity hardware platforms with custom ‘better than you’ software on top meshes well with their corporate messaging. I’d love to see some reconciliation on that front, and a clear vision for the Mojo team moving forward. Please spare me the ‘HP acquired Aruba’, ‘Cisco acquired Meraki’, and those companies are fine story. Paint me a genuine story of market leadership backed by strong technical chops that promise to survive the acquisition.\n\nAruba (http://www.arubanetworks.com/, @ArubaNetworks)\n\nAruba (a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company) has been touting ‘industry leadership’ on several fronts recently. They have clearly claimed leadership on several fronts including WPA3 and some intriguing messaging around 802.11ax. Their strength is messaging. They do it well, but I fail to see how Aruba single handedly ‘landed’ WPA3 and how their messaging around 802.11ax (buy when *we’re* ready, but not anyone else) is anything more than corporate marketing fluff. I’d love to see how they are helping the industry move forward *as a whole* on more than just ‘standards stuff coming down the road’. Help me understand why Aruba’s implementation of QCA radios is better than someone else’s. Help me understand why their switches brings more value to an enterprise other than an ABC play. Help me understand why end to end networking with the Aruba logo on it is better.\n\nCisco (http://www.cisco.com/, @Cisco)\n\nCisco, the 800 lb. gorilla that everyone loves to hate. Cisco is a machine unlike any other. They have critical mass despite themselves and are painting some intriguing messaging around Assurance products that seem to resonate well with the on-premises enterprises. All other networking aside (routing, switching, security, Data Center, etc), Cisco Wi-Fi has seemingly lost its way as of late. Their adoption of QCA radios (CleanAir is awesome, unless they sell an AP without it!), their continued duality around the Meraki acquisition (it’s right when it will land a sale), and the feature gaps as new platforms come online has always stuck in my craw. The 802.11ac wave 2 APCOS change (the OS on the APs) debacle has left many with souring appetites for a monolithic beast of an assurance platform. I’d love to see how Cisco is involved in driving standards (WPA3, 802.11ax) while allowing their ecosystem around CCX fall to the wayside despite not having a standards based equivalent to 100% of those components (DTPC anyone?).\n\nFortinet (http://fortinet.com/, @Fortinet)\n\nFortinet (nee: Meru) has always been intriguing to me. If there is a dark horse in the Wi-Fi space, this is it. Out of left field, some strange security company acquired ‘those SCA guys’ which raised more than a few eyebrows in the industry. I’m not super passionate about firewalls so when someone touts that their strong suit is plopping some security stuff onto an already delicate Wi-Fi ecosystem, I get nervous. I’d love to see what Fortinet is doing on the SCA front (other than the occasional corner case deployment). How are you fostering the technology that made Meru, Meru? If you’re going to be the one exception in the CWNP curriculum, own that. Embrace it, get the delegates to see what makes it special. Get into the nuts and bolts of how it works, what makes it tick. Get your radio firmware developer into the room and nerd out with us for a bit. Don’t be afraid to put that unpolished guy on stage that only knows protocol. We love that kind of stuff.\n\nMist (http://mist.com, @MistSystems)\n\nMist is on the short list of Wi-Fi only players that I suspect will be acquired soon. Between them and AeroHive, there aren’t many players left and to be fair, Mist came out of nowhere when Cisco ‘spun out’ (my speculation) the previous owners of the AireOS legacy. They claimed virtual BLE was the next big thing, now it’s AI driven Wi-Fi – what’s next? Do they realize that the ‘heritage’ that they claim ownership of has turned off more people than it’s attracted? When someone claims to be at the helm of Cisco Wi-Fi during the Meraki acquisition, or to have the father of controllers (and RRM) in the drivers seat, how is that a compelling story when so many of todays woes are centered around those two topics? I’d like to hear how Mist has those people at the helm, but how they’re not destined to repeat the past. Mist claims to have an AI driven interface but fails to answer some pretty plain english queries. Tell me how Mist is better. How the AI is not just a bunch of if statements. Burning Man Wi-Fi, I hope not!\n\nNETSCOUT (http://www.netscout.com, @NETSCOUT)\n\nNETSCOUT (or is it netscout or NetScout?) has long held the mantle of go to wired insight products and only recently entered into the Wi-Fi foray with the Fluke (nee: AirMagnet) acquisition. They inherited an impressive product in the AirCheck G2, but also a legacy of tools that are, quite frankly, stale. What is next for the G2? Many of us in the industry love our hulk green Wi-Fi diagnostics tool and the G2 v2 additions were welcome. Is there enough left in the AirCheck to hope for a v3? I’d love to see a cleaner picture about link-live and how it plays a role in the beloved AirCheck G2. I’d love to hear a definitive story on the likes of AirMagnet Survey Pro, Wi-Fi Analyzer, Spectrum XT – all of which are *very* stale. Let’s put these to bed or make something of them that the industry can use.\n\nnyansa (http://www.nyansa.com, @Nyansa)\n\nnyansa has been that strange analytics company with the funny name that promises to fix all of our ails through machine learning and comparative analytics. They’re doing some neat things with ‘just a bunch of flows’, but is it enough? It seems like everyone is jumping on the analytics bandwagon now a days, but with the hefty price tag for a point-in-time resolution product, it feels somewhat estranged. Do you know what happens when your help desk has 9 dashboards all with different data in it, and you try to aggregate and correlate it into a meaningful dashboard? Your help desk now has 10 dashboards. I’d love to see why your data is better (of course), but tell me how it gets rid of data I don’t use today, and tell me how it does it at a price point that makes it a no brainer.\n\nDear reader, what do you want to see? Feel free to reach out to me by comment, or privately, or on twitter before or during the event and I’ll make sure you get a response. Till then, see you at MFD3 on September 12 through the 14th – make sure to tune in at: http://techfieldday.com/event/mfd3/\n\nHands on the Cisco 3504 WLC\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 by scwifi\n\nNot only are WLCs not dead, they’re not even on life support. Continued investment into the WLC platform is a clear indicator that there are still several use cases for centralized data, control, and management plane functions. Cisco has a long heritage of building awesome Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and the 3504 is the next in a long line of purpose built WLCs. If you’re familiar with the Cisco WLC portfolio, the 5520 and 8540 WLCs are basically UCS based appliances with hardware offloading cards added in. The 3504 returns to the heritage of a ‘from the ground up’ design of a purpose built desktop WLC solution and it’s aimed pretty squarely at the aging 2504 and 5508 platforms. As many people are moving forward with 802.11ac deployments, a look at your infrastructure controller may be warranted.\n\nWithout going into the details that are readily available on the data-sheet, I’ll instead focus on one or two key items of the platform that I find the most compelling.\n\n1) Feature parity. This WLC marks the first time the entry level boxes have feature parity with the larger WLCs. If you peruse any of the release notes, you’ll see a list of exceptions for various platforms especially on the low end. The 3504 was launched out of the gate expecting to support all of the features of the 5520 & 8540 making the differences between the three platforms strictly speeds, feeds, and capacity. This should be a comfort to those that regularly struggle with the feature gap in the Cisco WLC portfolio.\n\n2) Quiet operation. Let’s be honest, there are more than a few deployments where the equipment is sitting table top or on a cabinet out in the open somewhere. The 3504 supports ‘fan off’ operation at temperatures up to 86 F (30 C). For the overwhelming majority of situations, it’s difficult to get up to 86 degrees and maintain it with any level of comfort. This basically means that for most deployments, you’ll never hear a sound coming out of the WLC – even if it’s in your home lab.\n\n3) mGig support. Multigigabit (or NBASE-T) is becoming more and more prevalent on switching infrastructure and this marks the first time we can break the 1G link speed on the infrastructure side without having to deploy a full on 10G infrastructure. Those of you that read my posts regularly may recall that I’m a fan of being able to deploy solutions that break the 1G barrier on my existing copper runs. This was commonly APs but if you’ve been investing in the latest and greatest and ignoring the FUD about not needing mGig, this is another opportunity to leverage that investment.\n\nAll of these coupled together mean that you can get a quite elegant solution for most any environment now that we’re able to breath some life into the low end of the Cisco WLC portfolio. The 3504 is a notable improvement on the hardware and scale of the 2504 but don’t let it’s ‘desktop friendliness’ fool you – if you’re a 5508 customer today, there are going to be tons of places where ‘stepping down’ into a 3504 makes really great sense. With the rack mount kit available for it, you could easily put two 3504s in HA/SSO mode in 1RU and have all of the same features as the 5508 with a bit less capacity. Regardless of your current deployment, you really should make sure you take a peek at the 3504 as you’re considering lifecycle management of your gear.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a 3504 from Cisco as part of an early field trial and formed my opinions on my own. This post is my original work and I composed it without an expectation from Cisco.\n\n10 reasons to take another look at 2015 Cisco Mobility\n\nNovember 1, 2015 by scwifi\n\nLet’s face it, Cisco is huge. They’re massive, and occasionally they get things wrong. If you’ve strayed away from Cisco in the past year (or longer) because of a specific issue or gap, it’s high time you took another look. The Cisco Mobility offerings today are a far cry from what they were just an easy year back. Here are 10 great reasons to go get reacquainted with the 2015 Cisco Mobility offerings:\n\n1) 5520/8540 WLCs\n\nThe introduction of a Converged Access 60G solution highlighted the gaps in the WLC portfolio in the 20/40G of throughput range. Both of these new controllers (one 20G, one 40G capable) are based on the more mature AireOS codebase running 8.1 and later. While this doesn’t mark an EOS/EOL announcement for the 5508 (clocking in at 8G), it does give that 7 year old platform some good alternatives for lifecycle management.\n\n2) Prime Infrastructure 2.2 then 3.0\n\nEver since WCS was taken over and moulded into the NCS then Prime Infrastructure products, it’s always bore the scars of a legacy mired in Adobe Flash performance issues. Couple that with a dramatic uptick in features and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. The new versions of Prime Infrastructure are actually performing as well as they should be starting at about the 2.2 version and the new UI of Prime Infrastructure 3.0 completely moves away from Flash and demonstrates a significant re-think of the product – including ‘Make a wish!’.\n\n3) 802.11ac wave 2\n\nLet’s not forget the fun stuff – APs and radios. With competitively positioned 802.11ac Wave 2 products, Cisco is staying in the lead of the latest and greatest standards. With impressive throughput numbers, multiple gigabit uplinks, and fancy new features like MU-MIMO, the 1830/1850 APs are clearly paving the way for the next generation of some pretty obviously numbered future platforms. The only question is, what does Cisco have in store for us next?\n\n4) HALO\n\nNo, not the game – the new Hyper-Location Module and antenna array. Cisco is delivering on the promise that the industry made to us oh so many years ago about leveraging your WiFi network as a platform for tracking your enterprises assets. Touting down to 1 meter accuracy, this module for your AP3600/AP3700s will take your location fidelity ‘to the next level’.\n\n5) Mobility Express\n\nThose that don’t like having a bare metal controller and don’t see the need for controller based features (such as centralized data plane), we now have a ‘controller on the AP’ option! This allows us to focus on the smaller deployments without the extra cost and complexity (such as it is) for those customers. This isn’t a ‘one size fits all’ approach that we’ve seen in the past, but rather an evolution of a well thought out strategy to bring enterprise features to every market segment.\n\n6) UI improvements\n\nAlong with the Mobility Express product, the ‘metal WLCs’ are sporting a new user interface and out of the box setup experience (Day 0 and Day 1 support). If you’ve felt the WLC interface was a bit dated in the past, go take a gander at the plethora of new graphs, charts, and actual usable data about your infrastructure – all without having to goto a larger NMS platform!\n\n7) CMX Evolution\n\nThe MSE product is finally getting some legs under the advanced location pieces. This easy to deploy ‘for everyone’ product starts to bring some pretty insightful analytics to any sized deployment – all the way down to a ‘no maps required’ presence analytics and all the way up to a Hyperlocation enabled, social media engagement platform. With both on premises and cloud based offerings available, it really is very easy to start getting very insightful data out of any sized network.\n\n8) CCIE Wireless version 3\n\nThe dated CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert, Wireless) exam has been updated to include software and hardware platforms from this year. You can now tackle one of the industries most challenging certifications on contemporary labs that are actually relevant to solutions you’re deploying today!\n\n9) UX domain APs\n\nSee my previous blog on the topic for a more in-depth look at the UX products, but for those buying and deploying APs spanning multiple countries, this is a pretty good way to reduce a ton of deployment and ordering complexities. By standardizing on a single SKU globally, you can make quick work of some of the logistics nightmares of the past.\n\n10) Cisco ONE licensing\n\nYes, licensing is boring, complicated, and expensive. Cisco ONE addresses all three of those pain points in one easy go. With a ‘count the AP’ approach to licensing, you can now start to take advantage of all of the above products in an easy to consume, deploy, and license fashion – without breaking the bank. For example, if you wanted to replace your old WLC with a new one, in the past, you would end up repurchasing your AP licenses. In this model, all products start at 0 APs and you pick the size that’s right for you – at any scale. Pick the solutions you want to deploy: ISE, Prime Infrastructure, advanced location analytics, etc – and go! A significant departure from the traditional licensing model in Cisco-land.\n\nI know that a ‘recap overview’ blog sometimes seems too lofty, but there really is a ton to see if you’ve been unplugged from the Cisco world over the past year or so. Take a deep breath and plunge back in at any level and you’ll find something new that wasn’t there before. The Cisco ship sometimes turns slowly and sometimes it’s easy to forget that there is innovation happening all over the mobility space in San Jose.\n\nDisclaimer: I was part of the Wireless Field Day 8 delegation to Cisco where we learned about several of the above topics. For more information on Cisco’s appearance at WFD8, go check out the video!\n\nUX Domain APs\n\nOctober 26, 2015 by scwifi\n\nIn the wireless world, we’re constrained by regulatory requirements. These are, at their core, different rules by which we must abide by when we’re operating wireless equipment. Each country has their own set of requirements and restrictions – each manifesting itself in some iteration of channel availability or power limitation of some sort. Until now, this meant that each country had to have it’s own regulatory SKU to prevent a wireless professional or other ‘non-professional’ installer from exceeding or violating that countries requirements. Cisco has worked around this particular issue with a universal SKU Access Point. In the past you would order a specific AP for a specific country. The astute Cisco-configurator would identify the country code in an AP model number (A for North America, N for Mexico, I for Egypt, etc.). The gory details of country code mapping changed occasionally which meant that it was almost a full time job for international companies to wrangle which SKU went where.\n\nEnter the ‘UX’ SKU of AP. These APs are designated by the country code ‘UX’ and are universal SKU APs, meaning one SKU can be installed in any country. The way we’re able to do this is by way of software defining which country the AP is operating in. Now, the FCC won’t just allow you to ‘claim’ a country code, so there are some specific restrictions to deploying a ‘world capable’ AP. Today, this means tying the AP to a specific user, then using a non-hacked device to determine GPS coordinates of where the AP is installed to ‘prime’ or ‘unlock’ the AP based on what country it’s physically located in.\n\nThis blog will review the two ways to ‘prime’ a UX domain AP and get you up and running in no time at all! The first thing you need is an un-compromised (not jailbroken) device with both online capabilities (an Internet connection) and GPS capabilities. Enter the smartphone. Most of todays smart phones meet this requirement:\n\nStep 1) Head to your devices respective app store and grab the Cisco AirProvision application.\n\nStep 2) Plug in your AP and let it join to your WLC (this assumes you have things like discovery already taken care of). There are no UX specific join requirements so if you have regular Cisco APs joining your WLC, this part should be easy. Note that at this point the AP will be flashing ‘bad colors’ at you despite it’s radios being up and operational.\n\nStep 3) Enable ‘Universal AP Admin’ on one of your secure (PSK or .1x) SSIDs that has internet access (WLAN tab -> WLAN ID -> Advanced tab -> ‘Universal AP Admin’).\n\nStep 4) Join the above SSID on your unprimed AP.\n\nStep 5) Launch the app on your smartphone and log into CCO (page 1) then your WLC (page 2).\n\nStep 6) Click Configure!\n\nThat’s it! It’s a relatively straightforward way for your AP to know what country it’s at.\n\nThe good news is that you only ever need to prime a single AP in this fashion. Once it’s primed and comes back online, it will automatically include in its Neighbor Discovery Packets (NDP) UX domain info. Any other unprimed AP in earshot of these discovery packets will hear them and automatically pickup the country code of the already primed AP! Once you have primed a second AP by way of the NDP the priming sticks with the AP and you can then prime others off it in a cascading fashion – you can even re-prime the AP that you previously primed with the app!\n\nWhile this may seem like unnecessary work for those that are single country entities, those that have to operate in multiple country codes may find that simplified ordering is a lifesaver – assuming your installers have a smart phone and a free CCO account. This can also help if your company accidentally ordered several hundred of these and you don’t want to RMA them. Remember that the country code priming sticks with the AP across reboots, regardless of location (unless you re-launch the mobile app to reconcile your installation).\n\nThings to remember:\n\nYour smartphone must allow location access (it has to know where you’re at after all).\n\nYou must join the SSID on your unprimed AP. Joining on a different AP won’t help you any.\n\nYou have to have 2.4GHz enabled on your WLC and SSID – an unprimed AP operates in 2.4GHz only so you have to be able to see your SSID.\n\nYou must have the country code you’re provisioning enabled on the WLC (Thanks Andrew!).\n\nYour SSID must have internet access to allow CCO to be accessible.\n\nNDP priming only works on other NDP primed UX domain APs or app primed UX domain APs – not ‘regulatory domain APs’.\n\nDid you screw something up? You can reset the UX domain AP by performing a ‘Clear All Config’ on the AP page in the GUI (along with all of it’s other settings)!\n\nWhen your AP primes, it reboots. This is the same if you use the app or NDP. Don’t be surprised if you app-prime one AP and it cascades a bunch of NDP reboots.\n\n*Oct 26 14:16:35.003: %CLEANAIR-6-STATE: Slot 0 enabled *Oct 26 14:16:41.783: %CLEANAIR-6-STATE: Slot 1 enabled *Oct 26 14:17:08.719: %CDP_PD-4-POWER_OK: Full power - NEGOTIATED inline power source Writing out the event log to flash:/event.log ... *Oct 26 14:19:50.339: **************************** UNIVERSAL AP PRIMING *********************** *Oct 26 14:19:50.339: Action completed: regulatory domain values 0x0 0xB are written.

This AP was unprimed when it powered up, came online with radios up and then after several minutes received the NDP prime message and auto-rebooted. Easy, but potentially disruptive!\n\nWPA/TKIP only going away in Cisco WLC release 8.0\n\nApril 29, 2014 by scwifi\n\nCisco is readying the next major release of their WLC code, version 8.0. At the advocation of the WFA, this will bring with it a very significant change in security capabilities that you may find impacting if you’re caught unaware. In an attempt to raise awareness, Cisco has approved an discussion of this change first mentioned here. Cisco, in accordance with the new WFA guidelines, will no longer be allowing an SSID configuration with WPA/TKIP only security. If you are currently using an SSID that has WPA/TKIP only security, your configuration will automatically be updated to enable WPA2/AES connectivity as well as WPA/TKIP. You may want to start validation testing now if you are currently supporting legacy devices on a WPA/TKIP only SSID today. The easiest way to ensure you’re not caught by this change is to enable WPA2/AES along with WPA/TKIP and check to make sure your devices still behave as expected. I have confirmed in the lab that this change will be automatic:\n\nTo summarize of the variety of allowed and disallowed potential configuration options you have available and if they’ll be supported in WLC 8.0:\n\nWPA1-TKIP (Disallowed due to eliminating TKIP)\n\nWPA1-AES (Allowed by Extension Policy)\n\nWPA1-TKIP/AES (Disallowed since not used in conjunction with WPA2-AES)\n\nWPA2-TKIP (Disallowed due to eliminating TKIP)\n\nWPA2-AES (Certified and allowed)\n\nWPA2-TKIP/AES (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nWPA1-TKIP + WPA2-TKIP (Disallowed – no AES support)\n\nWPA1-TKIP + WPA2-AES (Certified and allowed)\n\nWPA1-TKIP + WPA2-TKIP/AES (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nWPA1-AES + WPA2-TKIP (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nWPA1-AES + WPA2-AES (Allowed by Extension Policy)\n\nWPA1-AES + WPA2-TKIP/AES (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nWPA1-TKIP/AES + WPA2-TKIP (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nWPA1-TKIP/AES + WPA2-AES (Allowed by Extension Policy)\n\nWPA1-TKIP/AES + WPA2-TKIP/AES (Disallowed due to WPA2-TKIP)\n\nOther SSIDs and security configurations are not impacted, including Open SSIDs, any SSID that currently has AES enabled, and WEP SSIDs.\n\nUPDATE: Due to user feedback, Cisco and the WFA finally settled on making the above restrictions in the GUI only. If you still have a business need for a WPA/TKIP SSID, you can configure it from the CLI. If you were building an SSID on a Cisco WLC with an ID of 6, you would use the following commands for example:\n\nconfig wlan create 6 TKIP-ONLY\n\nconfig wlan security wpa wpa2 disable 6\n\nconfig wlan security wpa wpa1 enable 6\n\nconfig wlan security wpa wpa1 ciphers tkip enable 6\n\nUsing the show commands you can validate that this configuration took at the CLI:\n\nshow wlan 6\n\n…\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2)…………. Enabled\n\nWPA (SSN IE)…………………………. Enabled\n\nTKIP Cipher……………………….. Enabled\n\nAES Cipher………………………… Disabled\n\nWPA2 (RSN IE)………………………… Disabled"
