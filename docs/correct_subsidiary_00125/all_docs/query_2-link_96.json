        "text": "MARCH 13TH 2003\n\nThe Economist\n\nNew wireless technologies for delivering broadband to the home are\n\nabout to challenge DSL and cable\n\nWIRELESS means mobile--or so many believe. Whether it is the fuss over\n\nthird-generation (3G) mobile phones and multimedia on the move, or the\n\nunexpected success of Wi-Fi hotspots that give laptop users fast\n\ninternet access without having to plug into a telephone socket, people\n\nthink of \"wireless services\" as something to use while away from the\n\nhome or the office. But another type of wireless technology may be even\n\nmore important. Known as \"wireless local loop\" (WLL), it could reignite\n\nthe consumer broadband market.\n\nThe telecoms boom left a glut of fibre-optic cable along trunk routes,\n\nbut this links directly only to the largest customers. Homes and small\n\noffices that want high-speed internet access usually subscribe to\n\neither a digital subscriber line (DSL) or a cable-television service.\n\nBoth are far from ideal: the phone wires used by DSL and the television\n\ncables tend to be owned by monopolies, and neither was designed for\n\nsurfing the web. Retrofitting a 1950s telephone line for broadband\n\ntakes a lot of work, making cheap DSL hard to supply profitably.\n\nIn principle, WLL has no such drawbacks. Indeed, many see it as an\n\nideal solution to the local access problem. Radio waves already reach\n\neverybody's home or office. So there is no need to dig up streets or\n\nshoehorn data into a system designed for voice. Of course, most WLL\n\nsystems require their own dedicated radio frequencies, but regulators\n\nhave been fairly generous with these--selling enough licences to\n\ncompeting WLL operators at a fraction of the prices paid by\n\nmobile-phone operators. Some can even use the same free, unlicensed\n\nfrequencies in the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bands as Wi-Fi, opening up the\n\nmarket to anyone.\n\nAt least, that is what WLL proponents say. In the real world, wireless\n\nhas so far lagged behind both cable and DSL. The problem is that, until\n\nnow, most WLL systems were fixed and required a clear line of sight\n\nfrom the customer's building to the service provider's base-station.\n\nLike satellite dishes, they had to be aligned by expert technicians,\n\nand could be knocked off target by snowstorms or wind. Unlike satellite\n\ndishes, their reception was easily disrupted by events on the ground.\n\nPeople who had a system installed in winter often found that it stopped\n\nworking in spring, as trees sprouted leaves that blocked the terminal's\n\nview of the base-station.\n\nThe latest WLL technology could change this. Unlike its predecessors,\n\nit does not require a line of sight, or outdoor installation. San\n\nFrancisco-based Soma Networks, for example, has developed a terminal\n\nthat can be placed almost anywhere in a customer's building. Like a\n\nmobile phone, it can even be carried around and used from other points\n\nwithin radio range of a service provider's base-station. The terminal\n\nis little bigger than a video cassette but has to be plugged into an\n\nelectric outlet. This is not particularly convenient, but portability\n\nis not its main selling-point.\n\nRather than the ability to move around, service providers are\n\nattracted to the new WLL's \"self-provisioning\" feature. Users can\n\nsimply buy Soma's terminal in a store and plug it into their PC and\n\ntelephone as soon as they get home, without needing to call out a\n\ntechnician. This is cheaper for the provider, and more convenient for\n\nthe customer. The first time the terminal is switched on, it directs\n\nweb surfers to a portal where they enter their billing information and\n\nchoose which voice or data package they want.\n\nThe device is capable of transmitting or receiving at up to 12\n\nmegabits per second--about ten times faster than most DSL connections\n\nand more than 200 times faster than a dial-up system. This way,\n\ncustomers can upgrade to a faster service at the click of a mouse. As\n\nmore customers sign up, service providers simply add more base-stations\n\nbecause all can use the same frequency without causing interference.\n\nPrevious WLL systems required adjacent cells to use different\n\nfrequencies, making it hard to increase network capacity with demand.\n\nExactly what service packages will be on offer is up to the network\n\noperator, but most WLL manufacturers envisage pricing based on service\n\nguarantees and peak speed, not volume of data or time spent online. The\n\nnetwork is able to prioritise traffic, ensuring that guarantees are\n\nhonoured during busy periods. Even more importantly, it means that\n\nlucrative voice traffic--the service from which telephone companies\n\nstill make most of their money--can be given priority over data. Rather\n\nlike text messaging on a mobile phone, data travel over spare network\n\ncapacity not used by telephone calls.\n\nThe similarity to mobile phones is not coincidental. Soma based its\n\nhardware around UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), the\n\n3G technology that is slowly becoming available in Europe and Japan.\n\nEntering a market dominated by the likes of Nokia and Ericsson may seem\n\nambitious, particularly when that market's size and even existence are\n\ndoubted by many analysts. But Soma is not really trying to beat the\n\nmobile-phone firms at their own game. The company has left out the\n\nparts of UMTS that deal with \"hand-off\", the complex process that lets\n\nusers move between cells without dropping calls, and it does not have\n\nto worry about miniaturisation or battery life.\n\nOther companies have had the same idea, although most have focused on\n\ndifferent applications. Another Silicon Valley start-up, IPWireless,\n\nhas also cherry-picked the UMTS standard, while Texas-based Navini\n\nNetworks has its own closely related technology. Both of these are\n\naiming for true mobility, retaining the hand-off circuitry and trying\n\nto make terminals as small as possible. (They are currently about the\n\nsize of a videotape, but both firms claim that cards which can fit\n\ninside a laptop are coming soon.) In the process, however, they have\n\nsacrificed telephony and focused solely on data-only systems.\n\nNot every WLL company is adapting 3G technology. Flarion Technologies,\n\na start-up firm backed by Cisco Systems, among others, has an approach\n\nbased on OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), the\n\ntechnology used in the fastest types of Wi-Fi and some\n\ndigital-television systems. OFDM can reach even higher data speeds than\n\n3G, by splitting a high-speed signal into several lower-speed\n\ntransmissions and sending each via a different path. Flarion's system\n\nshould provide a similar user experience to Wi-Fi, but covering a whole\n\ncity rather than only a few hotspots. Like IPWireless and Navini,\n\nFlarion lacks genuine telephony support, gambling that internet\n\nservices will be more important in the long term.\n\nThey could be right. It is already possible to make phone calls\n\nthrough all three systems using VOIP (voice over internet protocol), a\n\ntechnique that carries calls across the internet or other networks\n\nbased on the same architecture. VOIP requires special phones, and most\n\npeople think it still sounds inferior to normal telephony, but it is\n\nimproving all the time. Flarion hopes that its technology will\n\neventually be embedded inside VOIP cell phones, though for the moment\n\nit is concentrating on cards for laptops.\n\nHow long it will be before you can use this technology depends on\n\nwhere you live. America's three big long-distance carriers--AT&T,\n\nSprint and WorldCom--all have WLL spectrum licences. To date, only\n\nWorldCom has selected a system, but its roll-out has been delayed by\n\nits bankruptcy filing. Soma, IPWireless, Navini and Flarion have also\n\nshipped systems to smaller service providers in America and to larger\n\ncarriers in Japan and South Korea. All agree"
