The problem of multi-cell interference is especially severe when frequency re-use factor is small.\n\nPN offset pseudorandom noise offset\n\nthe PN offset technique is mainly used in a spreading spectrum communications network. This technique makes interference energy spread out over a wider spectrum, instead of trying to reduce it. As a result, interference energy has the same effect as thermal noises do.\n\nthe degree of isolation among cells depends on the spreading gain of the wireless communications network.\n\nthe frequency offset technique assigns different frequencies to different cells.\n\nthe multi-cell interference among cells is reduced because the interference signals do not appear on the same frequency as the desired signals.\n\nthe disadvantage of this technique is that spectrum usage efficiency is reduced. For example, in a wireless communications network with a frequency re-use factor of 3, spectrum usage efficiency is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nthe directional antenna technique is to have a directional antenna on an MS positioned toward the direction of arrival of desired signals and away from interference signals, which are the signals transmitted from other cells. The impact of the interference signals on a wireless station is thus reduced.\n\na disadvantage of this technique is that the directional antenna is bulky and expensive; therefore, it is not practical for mobile users.\n\nthe present invention discloses a method for reducing multi-cell interference.\n\nthe method is comprised of dividing a cell into a plurality of segments, partitioning a frequency spectrum into a plurality of sub-channels, assigning one or more sub-carriers to each of the plurality of sub-channels, assigning a predetermined sub-channel as a primary channel to a predetermined segment, deterrnining which of the plurality of the segments a desired communicating wireless mobile station enters, calculating a first spatial signature of desired signals from the desired communicating wireless mobile station, calculating a second spatial signature of interference signals from a plurality of non-communicating wireless mobile stations in one or more neighboring cells, and generating a null-steering beamf orming weighting vector from the first and second spatial signatures.\n\nFIG. IA shows a cell with a 360-degree central angle.\n\nFIG. IB shows a cell with a vertex angle of 120 degrees.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for reducing cell interference in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for allocating segregated channels.\n\nFIG.4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for null-steering beamforming. DESCRIPTION\n\nthe method disclosed in the present invention is applicable to any multiple access technique that uses some type of frequency division for multiple access channelization.\n\nThis includes frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplex multiple access (OFDM-MA), and any combination of the aforementioned techniques.\n\nFDMA frequency division multiple access\n\nTDMA time division multiple access\n\nMC-CDMA multi-carrier code division multiple access\n\nOFDM-MA orthogonal frequency division multiplex multiple access\n\nFDD frequency division duplex\n\nTDD time division duplex\n\neach sub-channel is assigned to a single user.\n\na TDMA system multiple users share a sub-channel but each of the users is assigned different time slots.\n\na MC-CDMA system multiple users share a sub-channel but each of the users uses different orthogonal codes.\n\nthe sub-channels could overlap with each other while in other systems such as TDMA and MC-CDMA, there is no overlap of subchannels.\n\nthe frequencies of the sub-carriers that form one sub-channel are not contiguous.\n\nthe sub-carriers are selected based on a predetermined permutation.\n\nthe sub-carriers in one sub-channel are logically adjacent to each other but not necessarily physically adjacent to each other.\n\nPUSC Partial Usage Subchannelizaton\n\nthe method disclosed in the present invention has two constituents: segregated channel allocation and null-steering beamforming.\n\nthe segregated channel allocation technique divides a cell into segments and significantly reduces multi-cell interference and yet at the same time maintains high spectrum usage efficiency. For example, in a cell with six segregated segments, the segregated channel allocation technique achieves the same level of interference reduction as in a cell with a frequency re-use factor of 6 while the spectrum usage efficiency with a frequency re-use factor of 1 is still maintained.\n\nthe null-steering beamforming method creates an antenna beam pattern that enhances the desired signal and suppresses the interference signal.\n\nthe efficiency of the method is not limited by the spreading gain of the system, but rather, it complements a pseudorandom noise offset method.\n\nFIG. IA shows a cell 100 with a central angle of 360 degrees.\n\na BTS is located at the center 120.\n\nthe cell 100 is divided into six equal segments HO[1 :6], each of which has a 60-degree central angle.\n\nFIG. IB shows another example of dividing a cell 140 into three segments.\n\na BTS is located at a vertex 142 which has a 120 degrees angle.\n\nthe cell 140 is divided into three segments 148[1:3] with approximately equal vertex angles at the BTS location 142.\n\nthe vertex angle 150 of one of the segment 148[3] approximately 40 degrees as shown in FIG. IB.\n\nthe BTS plans a frequency usage assignment for each segment of the cell, with each segment assigned a channel with a different frequency.\n\nthe channels are assigned in such a way that the probability of having the channels at the cell boundaries assigned the same frequencies is minimized.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for reducing cell interference in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Steps 210 and 220 depict segregated channel allocation while step 230 illustrates null steering beamf orming.\n\na BTS learns the location of an MS in its cell by receiving its location information explicitly from the MS or by detecting the location based on a receiving signal from the MS. Then the BTS instructs the MS to use a frequency of the channel assigned to the segment according to segment information in step 220.\n\nthe BTS employs a null-steering beamf orming method with an adaptive antenna array in step 230. Desired signals are sent to the MS in the segment via an appropriate channel.\n\nFIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating segregated channel allocation in detail.\n\na BTS divides a frequency spectrum allocated to a cell into JV subchannels in step 310. This is called frequency division channelization.\n\nthe BTS divides the cell into multiple segments in step 320.\n\na cell with a BTS covering 360 degrees can be segregated into six segments, each of which has a 60-degree angle as shown in FIG. IA.\n\nTo a cell with a BTS covering 120 degrees it may be segregated into three segments, each of which has a 40-degree angle as shown in FIG. IB.\n\nstep 330 the BTS assigns a unique group of sub-carriers to each of the segments as a primary channel for the segment. For each segment, the primary channels of its adjacent neighboring segments are considered as its secondary channels, and the primary channels of the next adjacent segments as its tertiary channels, and so on.\n\nthe primary channels of segments 2 and 6 will be the secondary channels of segment 1.\n\nthe primary channels of segments 3 and 5 will be the tertiary channels of segment 1, and the primary channel of segment 4 will be the quaternary channel of segment 1.\n\nthe frequencies of the sub-carriers in each channel are riot necessarily contiguous. They are selected based on a predetermined permutation.\n\nthe BTS plans a multi-cell channel allocation in such a way that there are no frequencies overlapped at the cell boundaries.\n\nthe BTS detects the location of the MS and subsequently a segment where the MS is located in step 340.\n\nthe BTS can determine the location of the MS in several ways.\n\nOne way to determine the location of an MS is to have a different access channel for each segment.\n\na BTS equipped with multiple antennas it can have each antenna point to a different segment in a cell.\n\na BTS equipped with an adaptive antenna array it can use a beamf orming method to create antenna beam patterns with each antenna beam pattern pointing to one segment.\n\nthe access channels of all the segments in the cell can differ in any of the physical attributes of a communication channel, such as the carrier frequency, phase, magnitude, and pseudorandom noise (PN) offset.\n\nPN pseudorandom noise\n\nan MS When an MS enters a wireless communications network, it scans and acquires an access channel. The MS sends the BTS an acknowledgement (ACK) message including the information it has acquired via the access channel. By comparing the access channel information received from the MS with the access channel planning map, the BTS determines the segment where the MS is located.\n\nACK acknowledgement\n\nAnother way to determine the location of an MS is to use antennas that have different receiving patterns for each segment in the cell.\n\nthe BTS identifies the antenna that receives the signal with the highest signal strength, which is the desired signal, and it subsequently determines the segment where the MS is located.\n\na BTS equipped with multiple antennas is able to compute the DOA of the receiving signals from a MS, based on the magnitudes and phases of the signals received from different antennas. Using the DOA information, the BTS determines the segment where the MS is located.\n\nFIG.4 is a flow diagram illustrating null-steering beamforming in detail.\n\ncomputing a bearnforming weighting vector requires spatial signatures of both the desired and the interference signals.\n\nthe null-steering beamforming weighting vector creates an antenna beam pattern that enhances the desired signal and suppresses the interference signal.\n\nthe BTS determines the spatial signatures of both the desired signals and the interference signals.\n\nthe MSs in the neighboring cells transmit uplink signals with orthogonal coding sequences.\n\nthe BTS not only receives the uplink signals from the MSs in its own cell but also those from the MSs in the neighboring cells. Based on the received uplink signals, the BTS determines the spatial signatures of the desired signals.\n\nthe BTS determines what the potential multi-cell interference sources are. When the BTS detects an uplink sounding signal from an MS in a neighboring cell, it compares the signal strength of this signal with a predetermined threshold. If the signal strength is larger than the predetermined threshold, the MS is identified as one potential multi-cell interference source.\n\nthe BTS detects more than one uplink sounding signal from one or more neighboring cells\n\nthe signal strength of all the uplink sounding signals from the neighboring cells are compared with a predetermined threshold. If the signal strength is larger than the predetermined threshold, the MSs with the strongest uplink sounding signals are identified as the potential multi-cell interference sources.\n\nthe spatial signatures of the interference signals are calculated from the receiving signals of the potential multi-cell interference sources.\n\nthe BTS determines the active multi-cell interference sources.\n\nthe BTS exchanges uplink sounding signal allocation information with all the other BTSs in every transmission cycle.\n\nthe BTS determines whether an MS is an active multi-cell interference source based on the uplink sounding signal allocation information sent by the other BTSs.\n\nthe covariance matrix of the interference signals is calculated based on\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nSignal Processing (AREA)\n\nComputer Networks & Wireless Communication (AREA)\n\nQuality & Reliability (AREA)\n\nMobile Radio Communication Systems (AREA)\n\nPCT/US2007/005219 2006-09-26 2007-02-28 Method for reducing multi-cell interference in wireless communications WO2008039231A2 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (2)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP07751950.2A EP2067361B1 (en) 2006-09-26 2007-02-28 Method for reducing multi-cell interference in wireless communications CN2007800249756A CN101496440B (zh) 2006-09-26 2007-02-28 éä½æ çº¿éä¿¡ä¸­çå¤å°åºå¹²æ°çæ¹æ³\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (4)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US84718206P 2006-09-26 2006-09-26 US60/847,182 2006-09-26 US11/711,202 US7480271B2 (en) 2006-09-26 2007-02-26 Method for reducing multi-cell interferences in wireless communications US11/711,202 2007-02-26\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date WO2008039231A2 true WO2008039231A2 (en) 2008-04-03 WO2008039231A3 WO2008039231A3 (en) 2008-11-27\n\nFamily\n\nID=39224828\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date PCT/US2007/005219 WO2008039231A2 (en) 2006-09-26 2007-02-28 Method for reducing multi-cell interference in wireless communications\n\nCountry Status (4)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US7480271B2 (pt-PT) EP (1) EP2067361B1 (pt-PT) CN (1) CN101496440B (pt-PT) WO (1) WO2008039231A2 (pt-PT)\n\nFamilies Citing this family (20)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US8195240B2 (en) * 2007-04-18 2012-06-05 Cisco Technology, Inc.
