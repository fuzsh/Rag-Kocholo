Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) announced a definitive agreement to acquire the Richardson, Texas-based Navini Networks Inc. for about $330 million in cash and assumed options.

Cisco noted that Navini's WiMAX products will extend its WiFi and WiFi-Mesh portfolios and also help extend and enhance its IP Next Generation Network vision to enable service providers to deliver any service to any device over any network.

Cisco said that it expects to close this acquisition in the second quarter of 2008 fiscal year. Upon closing, Cisco plans to integrate Navini into its Wireless Networking Business Unit, under the Ethernet and Wireless Technology Group.
