Cisco Systems agreed to acquire Navini Networks, a supplier of WiMAX infrastructure products, for approximately $330 million in cash and assumed options.

Navini offers a line of WiMAX solutions, including base stations, adaptive antenna arrays, management systems, and subscriber modems, which has been sold to more than 75 customers.

Navini has developed its own patented, “Smart Beamforming” and MIMO technologies, which enhances range and throughput performance of WiMAX, a combination it calls the “Navini Mobile WiMAX Solution”. The company claims 2-3 times the coverage area of non-beamforming implementations.

Navini’s Ripwave MX product line runs in the 2.3 GHz, 2.5/2.6 GHz, 3.4/3.5GHz and 3.6GHz bands and already supports Wave 2 features in addition to Wave 1 capability. In addition, the platform is capable of supporting beamforming, handover, HARQ, sleep/idle modes, power control, feedback and other advanced features.

Cisco said broadband wireless networks based upon WiMAX have the potential to add millions of new Internet users who cannot be reached economically using copper or fiber infrastructures.

Navini is based in Richardson, Texas.
