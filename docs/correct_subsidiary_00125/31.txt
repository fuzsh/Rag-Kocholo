21. © 2006 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. 21 The Burning Platform  Demand vs. industry capacity down – Creates price resistance & challenges to sustaining margins  Price-focused competitors from India & China are growing – Threatening Cisco's dominance in emerging markets  Product development by competitors can outperform CISCO products and new technical standards will make them outdated  Not enough people to cover transitioning customer base  Service providers’ purchasing patterns are becoming more uneven – Accuracy in Forecasting Sales – More rigid acceptance requirements are making the sales to implementation process more complex, and cycle time is increasing – Leading to slow revenue recognition – Focus on lead time performance is required Source: Team Developed

51. © 2006 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. 51 Future Recommendations (Cont.)  Must continually press U.S. government/FCC to do more to expand network infrastructure bandwidth – New applications depending more and more on video, UC, etc. – Current broadband capabilities insufficient to handle future traffic – U.S. substantially behind other countries in delivery of broadband  Expand “Green” initiatives internally –Will cut travel expenses by 20% starting 2008  Expand “Green” investments externally –Connected Urban Development –Reduces carbon footprint of cities

52. © 2006 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. 52 Future Recommendations (Cont.)  Fully exploit WiMAX technology – Already taken initial step with acquisition of Richardson based Navini Networks – WiMAX technology will be deployed on next generation of laptops – By 2012, ABI Research predicts approx. 95 million WiMAX subscribers and 200 million mobile devices equipped with the technology Source: Team Developed
