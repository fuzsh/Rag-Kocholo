NEW YORK – Mr. Evangelos Venizelos, the deputy prime-minister and foreign minister of Greece paid a visit to Archbishop Demetrios yesterday, Sept. 25, at the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Mr. Venizelos is visiting New York, as he participates in the Annual General Assembly of the United Nations.

The two leaders discussed the latest developments relating to the economic crisis in Greece, and the many other issues of mutual interest for Orthodoxy and Hellenism around the world.

Following the hour-long meeting, Mr. Venizelos said in a statement to the Press that the meeting with His Eminence was “interesting and substantive.” He also publicly thanked the Archbishop for his ministry and the work he is doing for Orthodoxy and Hellenism during a very critical time and in a very significant place.

In his statement, the Archbishop said that most of the credit belongs to the Omogeneia, the Greek American Orthodox Community in America as a whole. He also stated that the meeting with Mr. Venizelos was very informative and matter-of-fact but also full of hopeful signs for an end of the “storm” and a brighter future for Greece. He said, the Omogeneia always stood and will continue to be by the side of our brothers and sisters in Greece, it feels the pain of our brethren in Greece and helps in any possible way.

Mr. Venizelos was accompanied by the Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitrios Kourkoulas, the Ambassador of Greece to the U.S. Christos Panagopoulos, the Permanent Representative of Greece to the U.N. Michael Spinellis and other ministry staff.
