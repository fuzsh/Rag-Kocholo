        "text": "The leader of Greece's Socialist Party, Evangelos Venizelos, says he has made progress in efforts to form a coalition after inconclusive elections on Sunday.\n\nMr Venizelos, the third political leader to try, called his talks with a small left-wing party a \"good omen\".\n\nThe head of that group said he was ready to join a coalition that kept Greece in the euro while rejecting the terms of an international bailout.\n\nThe election saw a huge backlash against pro-bailout mainstream parties.\n\nUnder agreements with the EU and the IMF, Athens is due to approve fresh budget cuts worth 14.5bn euros (Â£11.6bn; $18.8bn) next month, in return for financial help worth a total of 240bn euros.\n\nMr Venizelos was given the mandate to start new coalition talks after failed bids by leaders of the centre-right New Democracy and radical left Syriza bloc.\n\nOn Thursday he met the leader of the Democratic Left party, Fotis Kouvelis, who said he was willing to participate in a broad-based government that would keep the country in the euro but disengage it from the bailout.\n\n\"I propose the formation of an ecumenical government that will respect the people's mandate,\" Mr Kouvelis said afterwards.\n\nMr Venizelos spoke of sharing common views with Mr Kouvelis, calling his proposals \"responsible and concrete\". He added that the meeting had been \"a good omen\"."
