        "text": "ATHENS — Former Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, who was forced to step aside in 2011, has burst back onto the political scene here with a bid to wrest control of his Socialist party from his successor.\n\nMr. Papandreou, who made his move in an open letter last week calling for an emergency party congress to pick a new leader, has thrown even more uncertainty into Greece’s volatile political landscape.\n\nThe party, Pasok, which has been part of a governing coalition for the past two years, has seen a huge decline in its popularity. But analysts believe that the return of Mr. Papandreou could bolster the party’s fortunes, reordering the fragmented political landscape, particularly if elections are held early next year as seems increasingly likely.\n\nMr. Papandreou would be likely to draw votes away from Syriza, Greece’s new left-wing party, which at the moment is far ahead in polls.\n\nUnder some scenarios, political analysts say such a development could make Pasok a crucial player in determining who leads the country after the next elections, which could be held as early as March.\n\nIt is far from clear, however, that Mr. Papandreou would succeed in ousting Evangelos Venizelos, who took over the party after Mr. Papandreou infuriated European Union leaders with his idea for a referendum on Greece’s bailout by international creditors.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
