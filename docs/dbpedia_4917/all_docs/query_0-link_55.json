        "text": "ABSTRACT Most of the pieces that make up this book gathered during the time I lived in Greece. The knowledge about Arvanites consisted of both my efforts to extract thorough information and their assistance to me. During my stay in Greece in 1993-2004, I studied the Arvanites' history. Undoubtedly, Arvanites League of Greece leaders Aristeidis Kollias, Georgios Mihas, and Kosta Kazakis were the ones who helped me to understand the Arvanite subject fundamentally. Precisely those Arvanite intellectuals were the ones that showed me the places where they lived in Greece. Greeks with Albanian roots are grouped below: 1) Arvanites, who are known as founders of Modern Greece. 2) Albanians of Greek Thrace, most of whom had come as a population exchange with the Treaty of Lausanne and were once known as an Albanian national minority. 3) Albanians from Kostur of Florina living on the outskirts of Thessaloniki. 4) Albanians of Epirus known as Chams and others belonging to the Islamic faith got massacred and persecuted by methods of genocide during 1944-45. Albanians of the Islamic, Sunni, and Bektashi religions in Greece are still resisting under the pressure of assimilation. These are found in small groups, and fortunately, Turkey cares more than Albania. This book aims to briefly bring about some historical aspects and documents about Albanians' contribution, known as Arvanites, for founding modern Greece. Arvanites contributed to all areas of life since the Arvanite Uprising in 1821. Kolokotronis, Botsaris, Tzavelas, Androutsos, Miaoulis, Karaiskakis, etc., were its heroes. Others were presidents and prime ministers such as Ioannis Kapodistrias, Miaoulis, Kriezis, Pangalos, Kountouriotis, etc."
