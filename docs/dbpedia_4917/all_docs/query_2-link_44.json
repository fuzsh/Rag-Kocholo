        "text": "This part is mainly based on data drawn from interviews carried out between March and September 2003. Moreover, information has been drawn from the database created for the scope of this book (Pontoporeia, 1945–2000), which includes records of 25,000 Greek-owned ships. Furthermore, information has been drawn from the shipping press of the second half of the 20th century, as well as from books and other published material. For most of the traditional shipowning families data were drawn from the Ploto and Pontoporeia, studies of Greek shipping companies for the period from the end of the 18th century to the eve of the Second World War (Harlaftis et al., 2002; Harlaftis and Vlassopulos, 2004, hereafter referred to in the text as Ploto and Pontoporeia respectively). The research presented in this book covers the period from 1945 until 2003."
