        "text": "This book discusses the relationship between Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical music and laiko (popular) song in Greece. Laiko music was long considered a lesser form of music in Greece, with rural folk music considered serious enough to carry the weight of the ideologies founded within the establishment of the contemporary Greek state. During the 1940s and 1950s, a selective exoneration of urban popular music took place, one of its most popular cases being the originating relationships between two extremely popular musical pieces: Vasilis Tsitsanis's “Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki” (Cloudy Sunday) and its descent from the hymn “Ti Ypermacho” (The Akathist Hymn). During this period the connection of these two pieces was forged in the Modern Greek conscience, led by certain key figures in the authority system of the scholarly world. Through analysis of these pieces and the surrounding contexts, Ordoulidis explores the changing role and perception of popular music in Greece.\n\nThis paper shows the parameters of the development of the Greek National Music School in the beginning of the 20th century, partly evolving as a historic command and partly as a conscious transfer of European practice to the Greek realm. In parallel, many Greek composers who continue their studies in one of the biggest European centres, assimilate different tendencies of modernism and introduce them in Greece upon their return home. Few of them will be totally able to avoid the use of national elements, while most of them will try to integrate them, even fragmentarily in their works. The already existing conflict among traditionalists since the foundation of the National Music School, regarding the criteria for the \" Greek character \" of music composed in Greece, is shifted among conservatives and avant-garde. Unfortunately, in certain cases the conflict was so strong that drove prominent composers who embraced modernism either to obscurity (e.g. Skalkotas) or discouraged them and turned them towards other music activities (e.g. Mitropoulos). The ones who chose to stay abroad (e.g. Xenakis) had the best of luck. During the first half of the twentieth century almost the total of Greek composers in the interior of the Greek domain are influenced by the prevailing trend, which promoted the idea of Greek music creation, resulting in the standard development of selective conduct and properties in which national elements co-exist, mingled with impressionistic, expressionistic, neoclassic, twelve-tone and other European techniques as well as elements mostly correlated to the rest of the national schools of eastern Europe (modal characteristics, oriental scales, etc.). This paper also looks into the progress during the second half of the 20th century when national music goes down. The new European trends are steadily gaining ground. The pace of information transfer is increased by contemporary means of communication. Greece is assessed into the west and does not suffer the dry censorship of eastern communist regimes. More and more contemporary Greek composers are imbued according to the avant-garde trends of Western Europe and diffuse those in the interior of their country. Establishing music faculties in Greek universities since the '80s contributed greatly to the above. Concluding, the nationalistic spirit of another era gave way to the genuine Greek spirit whose aim has always been the demand for quality and artistic value.\n\nThe influence of Western music on art music in modern Greece, though granted, has not been studied but only occasionally, through the work of very few Greek composers. A complete study of the aforementioned relationship is therefore the main objective for the integration of Greek art music creation in the Western-European musical map. Aim of this proposal is the research, registration and presentation of Greek composers in the 20th century, who have studied in countries of the European Union. In this paper the following parameters will be examined: a) the preferences of Greek composers with regard to the place of their studies. An effort will be made to develop a relative argumentation for the justification of their choices (correlation with purely musical and aesthetic criteria regarding specific European schools, choices suggested by professors or imposed, e.g. by an establishment offering scholarships, etc.). b) the changes during the century in the aforementioned preferences, and eventually their correlation with socio-political phenomena (financial crisis, world wars etc.) c) the fluctuation of the number of composers who had studied in Europe during the century, related to the standard of living in the urban centres, the gradual development of the industry of sound and the resulting possibility for the dissemination of the art of music in wider social strata and, finally d) the influences they were subject to, depending on the country where they had studied, the Faculty, the Professor and the main streams that were prevailing.\n\nThe reformation of Athens Conservatory in 1891, followed by significant aesthetic and cultural changes as regards the indigenous perception of western‐European music, and the formation of the first orchestral ensem‐ bles contributed to an inceptive promotion of symphonic music in Greece between 1890‐1910. However, it was due to the continuous efforts of Dimitri Mitropoulos, mainly between 1924‐1939, to establish a steady full orches‐ tral ensemble and expand the repertory of performed works that brought the Athenian audience closer to the Western‐European symphonic repertory. Important Greek symphonic works had already emerged after the second half of the 19 th century (i.e. by Dionysios Rodotheatos and Demetrios Lialios), while the preceding sinfonias by Mantzaros, Padovanis, Metaxas and other Ionian composers were more related to the pattern of the italian overture. The Greek symphony, originating from 1920 onwards, combined romantic aesthetics and ideals (mainly of Austrian – German orientation), (neo)classical structural features and indigenous characteristics of musical folklorism, national identity and tradition (initially modelled after 19 th century European national schools). Manolis Kalomiris and Petros Petridis comprised prime symphonists, followed by an important number of composers more or less attached to the ideals of the Greek Na‐ tional School. While examining the existing repertory of Greek symphonies during the first half of the 20 th century, both histori‐ cally and analytically, this paper also aims at corellating landmark works and composers to important social, politi‐ cal and even military events in Greece, up until World War II. The invasion of modernism after 1950 in Greek art music and its repercussions to the production of post‐war Greek symphonies will be also commented upon."
