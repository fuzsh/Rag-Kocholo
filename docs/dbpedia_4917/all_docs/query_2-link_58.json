        "text": "Imbued with the history and natural beauty of Greece, the great folk artist’s oeuvre radiates aesthetic and intellectual emotions as the uncompromising painter persistently immersed his gaze in the age-old traditions and events of Greece, seeking the truth of life. The simplicity and undiminished historical and aesthetic value of his work bears witness to his wisdom, with the well-judged tensions created by contrasting colours, sometimes vivid and dramatic, sometimes soft and lyrical. His painting is almost universally charged with the power of the myths of ancient Greece, the dignity and valour of the heroes of the Greek War of Independence, and the unsurpassed beauty of the Greek landscape. He usually accompanied his paintings with ungrammatical, poorly spelled captions that complemented the power of his images – the heroes and gods, seas and mountains, pine and olive trees. A world extending from Lesbos to Pelion, full of fiery excitement for the Greek history, with images from Constantinople and Smyrna to Egypt, Italy, Israel, Damascus, the “Russo-Japanese Naval Battle”, the “Deployment of Napoleon’s Army”, and so many more.\n\nTheophilos is iconic of the tradition of a country and a people. His ardent love for Greece led him to achieve a naïve expression of his visionary world. He persistently recalls mythology and historical memory, in works such as Demeter, Goddess of Agriculture; Achilles Versus Hector Outside the Fortress of Troy; Frixos on a golden-fleeced ram with Helle; Ares, Ancient-Greek God of War; Sappho, the Poetess of the Island of Lesvos and Kithara-Playing Alcaeus; The Dance of Zalongo; The Greek Victory at Karpenissi; The Death of Markos Botsaris in 1823; Georgios Karaiskakis Pursuing Kütahı, with his sword in 1826, are some of these characteristic captions by the artist. These paintings in the Theophilos Museum come from the important collection of Tériade, from the collector’s prescient commission to the artist five years before his death. Yannis Tsarouchis explains, “He gave him an open-ended commission, with no deadline, for a series of works that would one day go on display in Paris. Theophilos received the commission only a few years before his death and delivered it in the most brilliant manner. These works encapsulate the artist’s experience and thematic devices. Yet above all they represent a lucid expression of his findings as an artist. The commission occurred at an age when it is only natural for a true painter to feel an urgent need to clarify and complete his most fundamental elements.” (Yannis Tsarouchis, Θεόφιλος, Emporiki Bank of Greece, 1967). These works convey the spirit of a painterly narrative, since his inner truth serves, or goes hand in hand, with the urgency felt by a nation which experienced great and tragic moments – from glory and splendour to slavery and uprooting.\n\nTheophilos is the steadfast guardian of the cultural continuity of Greece. He did not seek to capture merely a moment; rather, he was after multifigure depictions of events, often featuring fighters who accomplished the shift from “I” to “We”. His subject matter was inspired by historical accounts and his painting technique was based on instinct as well as the Byzantine iconographical tradition – at a time when the few art lovers looked down on popular art and preferred the neoclassical style of Munich School artists, such as Gyzis, Lytras, Iakovidis, and Volanakis. In 1904 Theophilos produced a self-portrait as a chieftain – an eloquent statement of his personal truth. Bellicose, raising his sword in his left hand – being left-handed – he captures the bravery and determination of the Evzones, the select kilted infantry soldiers. Next to him stands a female figure, often claimed to be his sister, Irene. A self-portrait is a timeless reflection of an artist’s reality. Theophilos embodies the valour of his heroes, of a Greece indestructible through the centuries, defending freedom as the supreme good for all citizens. Depictions of heroes are a sizable element of his work, including those of Eleftherios Venizelos (Evangelos and Katingo Angelakos collection), in which he captured in his unmistakable and expressive style the powerful figure of the nation’s leader. Venizelos’s name appears in capital letters, as if to emphasise his enormous contribution and unparalleled judgement in defending the rights of Greece to the Entente Powers during World War I, as well as his negotiating skills, thanks to which he got the treaties of Sevres and Lausanne signed. In 1930 Theophilos produced the portraits of Tériade, capturing the austere, Doric countenance of the art critic who brought him out of obscurity to enjoy the glowing recognition he deserved. Many claim that nothing can be done without solitude. With his self-sufficient artistic merit, Theophilos relied on his own instinct and powers – his love for history, nature, and light. In evoking his visionary world, he achieved a supple, vibrant plasticity. Each of his works reflects a different era; all of them harmoniously fuse into a panoramic overview of Greek history – from Achilles and Alexander the Great to Karaiskakis and Kolokotronis. At the same time, he longed for unadulterated beauty, for instance in his Orchard by the Alyssida River, now destroyed, οr Peasant Girl of Corfu Island, or The Mayor of Megara; The Dance of Kilted Peasants and Young Ladies in Megara, among other works in the Theophilos Museum, all of which convey emotions of joy and serenity, in addition to their jubilant colour.\n\nThis passionate artist, so unjustly despised and ill-treated during his lifetime, had an unquestionable desire to vividly convey what he felt through an unpretentious painterly expression, full of power, brimming with pride, bathed in luminous, transparent, bold colours. His work reaches out all over the world – perhaps reflecting his own circumstances, his longing to escape the fate of the wicked, the defeated one. Elytis writes, “Beyond guilt and sin, Theophilos is headed straight to Paradise”. (Odysseas Elytis, Aνοιχτά χαρτιά, Ikaros, 1974). The honesty and depth of his naïve style was readily embraced by George Gounaropoulos, Stratis Eleftheriadis-Tériade, Andreas Embiricos, Odysseas Elytis, Fotis Kontoglou, Orestis Kanellis, Takis Eleftheriadis, Michalis Tombros, Kostas Ouranis, Dimitris Evangelidis, George Seferis, Kitsos Makris, and others. Reverently, they pored over his oeuvre and gathered valuable information about the son of the cobbler Gabriel Kefalas, born around 1868, and Penelope Michael, the daughter of an iconographer.\n\nAlthough he lived in poverty, kilted Theophilos won the battle of disinterestedness through the magic of his painting – and in so doing transcended the adversities of everyday life. This was his only refuge for peace of mind, his redemption. Life remained for him the irreplaceable good, the source of contemplation and creativity, and there was not a minute to lose. He lived a frugal life, opting for a pure conscience, an unadulterated creativity, and was ultimately rewarded with eternal victory. He conversed with the protagonists of history and was inspired by the unsurpassed beauty of nature, capturing its scents: Trees, mountains, land, sea, waves, all come to life when the sun shines its light on them; through colour – green, blue, ochre, or brown – the mystery of their essence is revealed. Nature is infinite – just as the love that emerges from his much-discussed works Erotokritos and Aretousa and Shepherd and His Wife. Interestingly, there are many recurring themes in his output, including Erotokritos and Aretousa, The Girl with the Hat, Adam and Eve, The Fall of Constantinople, Georgios Karaiskakis Pursuing Kütahı – suggesting that painting was a non-stop process for him.
