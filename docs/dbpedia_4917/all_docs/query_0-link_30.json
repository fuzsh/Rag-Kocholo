        "text": "INTERNATIONAL\n\nAn article on Tuesday about speculation in Afghanistan over who might replace Ahmed Wali Karzai, the assassinated leader of the provincial council in Kandahar and a half-brother of President Hamid Karzai, misstated the name of the province where Gul Agha Sharzai, a possible successor, is the governor. It is Nangarhar — not Jalalabad, which is the Nangarhar provincial capital.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nAn article on Wednesday about the decision by Representative David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, to resign following a young woman’s accusations of an unwanted sexual advance last year erroneously attributed a distinction to him. While he is the first Chinese-American elected to the House of Representatives, he is not the first elected to Congress. (Hiram L. Fong, a Republican from Hawaii, served as a senator from 1959 to 1977.)\n\n•\n\nAn article and a picture caption on Wednesday about a plan to build ultrahigh-speed computer networks around American universities misstated the number of member institutions supporting the project, known as GigU. There are 29, not 28. (Project officials omitted George Mason University from a list of participating colleges.)\n\nBUSINESS DAY\n\nA caption on Wednesday with the Advertising column, about a marketing campaign for Sharpie markers, reversed, in some editions, the media in which two ads appear. The biker’s helmet painted with Sharpie markers appears in a television commercial, and the decorated Cheeming Boey cups are featured in a print ad.\n\n•\n\nA picture caption on Tuesday with the Reuters Breakingviews column, about the European rescue plan for Greece, gave an incorrect identification from the wire service for the organization to which Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, spoke on Monday in Washington. It is the Peterson Institute for International Economics, not the Institute of International Finance.\n\nTHE ARTS\n\nA theater review on Wednesday about “The Patsy,” at the Duke on 42nd Street, and a listing of credits with it, using information from the program, misspelled the surname of the set and costume designer. He is Dane Laffrey, not Laffery.\n\nWEEKEND\n\nAn art review on Friday about “Nancy Grossman: Heads,” at MoMA PS1, and “Nancy Grossman: Combustion Scapes,” at the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery in Manhattan, misidentified the method Ms. Grossman used to paint the framed assemblages on display at the gallery. They were painted by hand, not spray-painted.\n\nSCIENCE TIMES\n\nA report in the Observatory column on Tuesday about bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, described their use of seafloor sponges as a foraging tool incorrectly. The dolphins place the sponges on their beaks, not on their noses. (Despite the dolphin’s name, its “nose” is actually its blowhole.) The article also described incorrectly the group of 54 Shark Bay dolphins known to use sponges. Most — not all — are female.\n\n•\n\nAn article on Tuesday about the evolution of organisms in urban areas referred incorrectly to the treatment for infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a newly evolved strain of bacteria discovered in New York City. Doctors typically prescribe drugs from a large class of antibiotics known as carbapenems; there is no single antibiotic called carbapenem.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nBecause of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about the actor G. D. Spradlin described incorrectly, in some editions, a scene from “The Godfather Part II,” in which Mr. Spradlin played a corrupt United States senator. In the scene, the senator threatens to “squeeze” the Mafia boss Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino; Michael Corleone does not threaten the senator.\n\nSTYLE\n\nAn article last Thursday about the hotelier Vikram Chatwal misstated the year in which he graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. It was 1994, not 1984.\n\nThe Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
