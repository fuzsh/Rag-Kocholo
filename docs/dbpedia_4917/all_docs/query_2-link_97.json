        "text": "The deep trouble that Greece has fallen into in the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has placed her in the international spotlight. This nation’s current predicament can be understood in the context of the deposed Constantine II’s failed struggle against George Papandreou in the 1960s to maintain Greek democracy and due to the Greek people’s refusal to reinstate a Crowned Democracy in late 1974. This refusal cleared the way for Papandreou’s ascendancy as prime minister between 1981 and 1989 and from 1993 to 1996.\n\nPapandreou rorted Greece’s membership of the European Union (EU) to establish an octopus type ascendancy through his party, the Pan Hellenic Socialist Liberation Movement (PASOK) that distorted Greece’s economy. This ultimately laid the foundation for the disastrous European component of the GFC.\n\nKing Constantine II’s failed struggle to safeguard Greek democracy in the 1960s has led to his name and that of the Greek monarchy falling into disrepute. The Greek monarchy has been caricatured as an unnecessarily meddlesome institution that represented the interests of foreign powers. These historical perspectives of modern Greek history are challenged by Dr. David Paul Bennett in his historical review of the Greek monarchy.\n\nThe Greek Revolution (1821-1829)\n\nThe current financial crisis has given Greece an international focus that it arguably has not had since her War of Independence (1821-1829). This struggle (which is often referred to as the ‘Greek Revolution’) drew widespread attention in Britain because the English poet Lord George Byron died of a fever while fighting for Greece. The Greeks fought heroically for their independence against Ottoman Turkey which had conquered Greece in 1453 from the Byzantine Empire (330-1453).\n\nThe Byzantine Empire bequeathed a cultural legacy that Greeks tenaciously held onto to maintain their identity under nearly four hundred years of Turkish rule. Greek independence (or the termination of Turkish hegemony) became a distinct prospect following British, French and Russian intervention in 1827 at the naval battle of Navarino against the Turkey. Indeed it was the grand ambition of Russia’s imperial family, the Romanovs, to ultimately destroy the Ottoman Empire and conquer the then Turkish capital Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) to establish a new Byzantine Empire.\n\nGreek independence therefore had a strong allure for the Russians and this was manifested when its former Foreign Minister Count Ioannis Antonios Kapodistrias became provisional president of a Greek republic (The First Hellenic Republic) in 1827. It was envisaged that Kapodistrias would rule Greece nominally on behalf of the Ottomans while the country would actually be a Russian satellite. Due to pressure from the great European powers of Britain, France, Austria and Russia it was agreed that Greece would become kingdom under the protection of the aforementioned powers. (This arrangement was nominally in place until 1919).\n\nKapodistrias as provisional president dragged his feet as a search was undertaken to find a new king of Greece. Due to rivalry within Greece’s ruling aristocratic families, who had previously collaboratorated with Ottoman Turkey before becoming Greek patriots, Kapodistrias was assassinated in 1831. The choice of Greek king eventually fell on the younger son King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Prince Otto, who became Greek king in 1832. *\n\n(The prime candidate for the Greek throne had been Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He had previously fought in the Russian army and his sister was the mother of the future Queen Victoria of Britain. The young prince, who went onto become the first king of the Belgiums in 1831, declined to accept the Greek throne wryly and perhaps prophetically predicting that a Greek king would always have to keep his bags packed).\n\nFailed Expectations: The Reign of King Otto\n\nPrince Otto was chosen by the foreign powers and was acceptable to the Greeks because the Bavarian royal family (the Wittelsbachs) could trace its antecedence back to princely families of the Byzantine Empire. The theme that modern Greek monarchy was a foreign imposed institution that was ill-suited to Greece commenced with controversy over King Otto’s reign (1832 to 1862). The first seemingly negative aspect of King Otto’s reign was that under the guidance of a Bavarian coterie of advisers (whose authority was enforced by an accompanying Bavarian garrison) Greece was converted into a de facto Bavarian colony.\n\nInitial Bavarian domination did however have the unintended positive ramification of displacing the aristocratic families (such as the Koundouriotis and Mavromikhalis families who had ruled Greece as vassals of the Turks and then underpinned the Kapodistrias regime. Therefore when a revolution led by veterans of the War of Independence overthrew and banished the Bavarian advisers in 1843 power actually passed to the broad mass of the Greek people. The Constitution of 1844 instituted popular local government and in this context Greece became one of the few independent nineteenth century European states without a powerful land-owning aristocracy.\n\nAt the time of the 1843 Revolution there was still a strong sentiment for King Otto who was regarded as a Greek patriot (which His Majesty actually was) cut off from his people by his Bavarian advisers. The Greek king was not inclined toward the role of constitutional monarch and was able to dominant Greek politics due to the absence of a coherent party system* which effectively undermined the power of the Greek parliament. (*Political parties, such as they were under King Otto, identified with the protecting powers. Therefore there was a ‘French Party’, an ‘English Party’ and a ‘Russian Party’).\n\nKing Otto utilized his political power to pursue his grand passion of extending Greece to Greek inhabited areas (‘unredeemed Greece’) that were still under Turkish rule: Macedonia, Thrace, Cyprus and Crete. There was also a strong Greek desire that Britain cede the Ionian Islands to the Greece. Nevertheless King Otto maintained Greek neutrality during the Crimean War 1854 to 1856 in which Britain and France fought against Russia. Greek neutrality during the Crimean War was a source of great unpopularity for King Otto. A Russian victory in the Crimean War was desired by most Greeks who hoped that this would clear the way to liberate unredeemed Greece.\n\nKing Otto’s reign did however have its major achievements. The Greek capital was relocated to Athens in 1839 and made into a first class modern capital. Under King Otto’s patronage a national library, a royal palace, a national gardens and a university were built in Athens. The constructions of these buildings was impressive because King Otto utilized his skills as a planner and as an organiser to surmount the nation’s scarcity of resources to construct a national capital which would serve as an important foundation for a future Greater Greece.\n\nThe king and his wife, Queen Amalia, also consciously fostered a sense of national identity by patronising Greek folk culture and adopting Greek national customs. The royal couple’s interest in Greek culture did have a lasting reciprocal impact as the Bavarian colours of blue and white were adopted and have remained as Greece’s national colours.\n\nThe Fall of King Otto\n\nFor all his patriotism, good intentions and actual achievements, King Otto’s reluctance to cede full authority to the parliament and his failure to achieve his self-appointed task of liberating unredeemed Greece led to his deposition in 1862*. The royal couple’s failure to have an heir had also caused grave concern because the throne would be inherited by one of the king’s younger Bavarian brothers. The nation was not prepared to endure another Bavarian born king who had not been raised in Greece and who would not a Greek Orthodox.\n\n(*Both King Otto and Queen Amalia, who respectively died in 1867 and 1875, tenaciously held onto their adopted Greek customs as they were acutely pained by their exile from Greece).\n\nWhile King Otto’s fall may have been of his own doing the Greek search for a new king and dynasty was influenced by a desire to have the British occupied Ionian Islands ceded to Greece. The Greek Parliament therefore nominated Queen Victoria’s second son Prince Albert as the new king of Greece and this was overwhelmingly confirmed in a plebiscite* by full male suffrage in 1863.\n\n(*There was an option of making Greece a republic but this received less than one hundred votes in the plebiscite).\n\nGeorge I and the Kingdom of the Hellenes\n\nQueen Victoria on the advice of the British government declined the throne on Prince Alfred’s behalf on the basis that Britain was one of the Protecting Powers of Greece and as such it was inappropriate for the Greek throne to go to a British prince. There was also the danger that Prince Alfred’s acceptance of the throne would alienate Russia which was wary of British influence in the Balkans in the wake of the Crimean War.\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark (the younger son of King Christian of Denmark) was selected by the Greek parliament in 1863 as the new king of Greece. This selection was due to the Danish royal family’s close relations with both the British and Russian royal families. Although Britain had refused to allow Prince Alfred to assume the Greek throne British goodwill toward Greece was manifested by the Ionian Islands being ceded upon Prince Frederick’s ascension.\n\nThe Danish prince took the name and title of George I on assuming the Greek throne. His Majesty’s reign (1863 to 1913) was an epoch in its own right and lasted fifty years and thereby constituted half the period in which the Glucksburg dynasty reigned in Greece, give or take war time banishments and a republican interregnum. Indeed it is plausible that had George I not being assassinated by a madman in 1913 that the turmoil and instability that bedevilled the Greek monarchy may have been avoided.\n\nThis counter factual historical perspective concerning the disastrous aspects of George I’s regicide have been used by republicans to support their contention that the late king’s successors were not up to his standard which consequently precipitated the rise of Greek republicanism. This conclusion will be challenged in this article.\n\nThe Glucksburg dynasty survived and was thrice restored with majority support which lasted until the 1970s. What distinguished the Greek monarchy from other European constitutional monarchies was that it was drawn into the vortex of partisan politics and as such faced entrenched and substantial opposition. The viability of a constitutional monarchy in such a context is problematic and the Greek monarchy did eventually fall. However, the ramifications of this fall have proven to be detrimental not only to Greece but to the world in the wake of the 2008 GFC.\n\nAlthough the Glucksburg dynasty did fall George I’s successors did, despite their travails, have their successes and these deserve recognition. The dynasty got off to a positive start when George I married Grand Duchess Olga of Russia in 1867. She was a cousin of Tsar Alexander III. As a Russian Orthodox Her Majesty immediately endeared herself to her new nation. George I remained a Lutheran but this did not cause any angst because it was pre-arranged that all his children (he eventually had eight children) would be Greek Orthodox.\n\nThe Birth of a Crowned Democracy\n\nGeorge I’s assumed the title of ‘King of the Hellenes’* to denote that an implicit objective of his reign would be to liberate unredeemed Greece. Furthermore the new king in swearing to uphold the constitution of 1864 (drafted in the wake of Otto’s authoritarian tendencies) officially designated Greece a ‘Crowned Democracy’ in which the role and legitimacy of the monarchy was to safeguard democratic parliamentary rule.\n\n(*For simplicity’s sake the Kingdom of the Hellenes and the Hellenic royal family will be respectively referred to as ‘Greece’ and the ‘Greek royal family’).\n\nGreece took a gigantic step to becoming an actual functioning democracy in 1881 when the 1864 Constitution was amended to oblige the king to appoint the leader of the largest parliamentary faction as prime minister. The ramification of this constitutional requirement was that Greek parliaments developed an inherent tendency of having two coherent parliamentary blocs. As a result the Greek party system (similar to Britain) has since traditionally being a two party system.\n\nIn contrast to the British party system Greece’s two major parties have met aphorised, reconfigured and being subject to the emergence of powerful third parties. Political controversy concerning the Greek monarchy and its resilience have been intertwined and derived from the fact that up until the 1970s at least one of the two major parties was monarchist.\n\nThe two major political figures (and rivals) in George I’s reign up until the late nineteenth century were Kharilaos Trikoupis and Theodoros Diliyiannis The rivalries between these two political leaders helped spawn the two major political parties, the Nationalist Party and the New Party. These two parties metamorphosed in the twentieth century to respectively become the Populists and the Liberals. The rivalry between these two parties was intense but non-ideological.\n\nThe Greek agricultural sector was (and still is) dominated by small landowners whose financial position was often derived from government support and/or political connections. Villages and towns were therefore often divided upon party lines in order to gain patronage. Which party one supported was often dependant upon family connections and allegiances. This patrimonial approach to party allegiance extended to the major cities due to family networks spilling over from villages into urban areas.\n\nGeorge I remained scrupulously above partisan political party divisions and as such ensured that the Greek monarchy was overwhelmingly accepted by the people. The absence of a land owning aristocracy also helped endear the Greek monarchy to its people. Consequently when Greece entered the twentieth century Greek republicanism was near non-existent.\n\nThe Struggle for National Expansion\n\nThe virtual absence of republicanism did not mean that George I’s reign was not without political controversy. The first major challenge of George I’s reign was the unpopularity he gained by supporting the nation’s leading politicians in keeping Greece neutral during the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-78. This prudence, particularly in the wake of Turkey’s defeat, caused great public frustration as Greece was apparently denied Greece the opportunity of taking Macedonia, Crete and Cyprus. (Britain capitalized on Turkey’s defeat to occupy Cyprus in 1881). British opposition in 1886 also seemingly thwarted Greece from taking military action against Turkey.\n\nGreece’s failure to capitalize on Turkish weakness did not imperil the Greek monarchy because George I was supporting the position of Greece’s parliamentary leaders. However their stance was probably not supported by public opinion and in 1894 the nationalist National Association. The aims of this association were to forement revolt by Greeks in Turkish occupied territories and subsequently ensure Greek government support for their compatriots.\n\nThe political impact of the National Association was apparent in 1896 when a revolt against Turkish rule broke out in Crete and Greece went to war against Turkey in 1897. Greece’s defeat in the 1897 War tarnished the Greek royal family because Crown Prince Constantine was at the forefront in heroically but unsuccessfully fighting against the Turks.\n\nIn the nineteenth century there was an expectation that royals actually fight in wars and although Crown Prince Constantine met this expectation Greece’s defeat adversely affected the royal family’s prestige. The threat of intervention against Turkey by Greece’s now nominal Protecting Powers still safeguarded Greece against possible Turkish retribution. Indeed it was at the behest of the Protecting Powers that Crete was granted autonomy and George I’s second son Prince George was made High Commissioner in 1898 in which he nominally represented the Turkish Sultan.\n\nThe Emergence of Eleutherios Venizelos\n\nThe prudent Prince George soon came into political conflict with Crete’s major political leader and main agitator for union with Greece, Eleutherios Venizelos. Venizelos was to go on not only to achieve his objective of uniting Crete with Greece (which was officially occurred in 1912) but of eventually extending Greek territory by 1919 to include most of Macedonia, western Thrace and northern Epirus. Indeed in terms of territorial expansion Venizelos more than doubled Greece’s size and he is arguably Greece’s greatest modern statesman.\n\nUnfortunately for the Greek royal family their relationship with Venizelos was fraught with political conflict which has to help underpin republican mythology concerning the Greek monarchy being an agent of foreign influence. In fact Venizelos only became a republican a year before his death in 1936. Indeed a closer examination of this Greek statesman’s life would highlight the contribution that the Greek royal family also made in achieving national consolidation and that they also had substantial support amongst the Greek people.\n\nVenizelos’s agitation for Createan union with Greece provided him with a national following in Greece itself which helped precipitate the formation in May 1909 of Military League among nationalist army officers. The Military League dared not stage an outright military coup because this would have alienated Greece’s two major political parties which still enjoyed overwhelming support.\n\nThe Military League still exercised its power in pursuit of the objective of liberating unredeemed Greece. The Military League exercised its political influence to secure the dismissal of Crown Prince Constantine and George I’s other sons from the military because they were misperceived as an impediment in taking military action against Turkey. The Military League dissolved itself in March 1910 following Venizelos’s arrival in Athens. He assumed the role of being the conduit of Greek nationalist aspirations on behalf of the military and the people in liaising with George I and the nation’s politicians.\n\nGeorge I and Venizelos were both sufficiently astute to come to a working political arrangement that ensured that constitutional government remained intact and indeed by the end of 1910 the Cretan politician was Greece’s elected prime minister. A new constitution was promulgated in June 1911 and a full reconciliation with the royal family was also seemingly reached that year when Crown Prince Constantine was given the new position of Inspector-General of the army.\n\nVenizelos’s domestic political talents were also apparent in foreign affairs when he succeeded in negotiating an alliance with Serbia and Bulgaria which led to these two nations in conjunction with Greece take Salonika and Macedonia from Turkey in the First Balkan War of 1912-1913. Friction almost immediately broke out between Bulgaria with Greece and Serbia over distribution of territory which precipitated the outbreak of the Second Balkan War in late June 1913. Within a month Greece and Serbia along Roumania had defeated Bulgaria in this war.\n\nThe heroism with which male members of the royal family fought, particularly Crown Prince Constantine and the effectiveness and compassion with which female members of the Greek royal family demonstrated in nursing wounded soldiers during the Balkan wars endeared the Greek monarchy to their people. Affection and loyalty toward the Greek royal family was seemingly permanently in the wake of the widespread grief that was generated by George I’s assassination in Salonika by a madman in March 1913.\n\nThe First World War: The National Schism\n\nThe apparently overwhelming acceptance of the Greek monarchy was jeopardized in 1914 by the division between Constantine I and Venizelos as to whether Greece should enter the First World War on the allied side. Prime Minister Venizelos favoured Greece the Entente while Constantine I wanted Greece to remain neutral.\n\nThe king’s desire for neutrality was due to the immense respect His Majesty had for the military acumen of the army chief of staff, General Ioannis Metaxas. The German trained Metaxas was considered by Constantine I to be a military genius and it was on the basis of Metaxas’s belief that the Central Powers would prevail in the First World War that the Greek king favoured neutrality.\n\nIt should be pointed out at this juncture that it is a mythology that Constantine I was dominated by his wife, Queen Sophia, the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. Queen Sophia became estranged from her brother after Her Majesty converted to Greek Orthodoxy of her volition. As a grand daughter of Queen Victoria* Sophia was a staunch anglophile who thought that her husband’s orientation toward Germany was absurd.\n\n(*Queen Sophia along with most grand children of Queen Victoria erroneously believed that she was the British Queen’s favourite grand-child. This distinction was actually held by Empress Alexandra of Russia).\n\nOut of genuine love for her husband Queen Sophia personally supported him and the only political conviction that Her Majesty shared with Constantine I was a deep faith in the personal genius of General Metaxas. (The exiled Queen Sophia went to her death in 1930 convinced that the Greek monarchy would be restored by General Metaxas).\n\nQueen Sophia has been mis-portrayed in contemporary Greek political culture as the villainess who dominated her husband and therefore plunged Greece into deep political crisis. A Greek 1980s movie on the political life of Venizelos grossly misrepresented Queen Sophia and falsely portraying Constantine I as wholly dependant upon his wife due to a supposed mental break down. This movie’s misrepresentation resonated with many Greek viewers because the depiction of Queen Sophia equated with caricature and hatred that many Greeks felt toward her grand-niece, the much misunderstood German born Queen Frederica. As inaccurate as the popular portrayal of Queen Sophia is, Constantine I’s actions in the First World War were actually reprehensible because His Majesty utilized his position to undermine democratic processes to keep Greece neutral. The king and prime minister initially agreed to disagree so that Greece accordingly remained neutral.\n\nIn March 1915 however Constantine I dismissed Venizelos and even though the former prime minister’s Liberal Party clearly but narrowly won the June parliamentary elections the king still delayed Venizelos’s reappointment until August. Bulgaria’s entry into the war in September 1915 on the side of the Central Powers precipitated great tension between Constantine I and Venizelos that the latter was again dismissed in October. The dismissal represented an irreversible rapture between the two protagonists that Venizelsos’s Liberals boycotted the December 1915 parliamentary elections which were consequently and overwhelmingly won by the now pro-king Nationalist Party, which later became the Populist Party.\n\nThe rupture between Constantine I and Venizelos became a national division (‘The National Schism’). In October 1916 the Allies occupied in Salonika where Venizelos established a rival government. The situation became even more dangerous in December 1916 when troops loyal to the king clashed with the allies. The allies took decisive action in June 1917 when British warships sailed into Athens and threatened to shell the capital unless Constantine I departed for exile.\n\nThe Greek Royal Family is Removed by Foreign Intervention\n\nThe first banishment of the Greek royal family gives lie to one of the persistent myths concerning the Greek monarchy- that it served the interests of foreign powers. The fact of the matter was that the Greek royal family was actually forced out by the threat of foreign military intervention and in a context when they enjoyed the strong support of their people. The allied ultimatum that Constantine I leave Greece resulted in thousands gathering outside the royal palace to block the king’s departure.\n\nIt was only by a ruse that the royal family was able to depart for their summer palace of Tatoi and from there go to neutral Switzerland. Popular resistance to Constantine I’s departure fostered a strong belief in succeeding generations of the Greek royal family (which may have existed until late 1974) that they always had the love of the Greek people no matter how turbulent the political situation.\n\nAnother republican myth concerning the Greek royal family in relation to the First World War era was that Venizelos was always a republican. The banishment of Constantine I saw the throne pass to his second son Prince Alexander because Crown Prince George was considered by the allies to be too close to his father. Venizelos treated King Alexander with the greatest respect and insisted that His Majesty be accorded full status as king. A chasm consequently developed between Alexander and his exiled family which adamantly refused to recognize him as king.\n\nWhatever controversy could be attached to Venizelos for coming to power and installing Alexander as king with foreign military assistance Greece’s entry on the allied side paid tremendous territorial dividends. Greek military support for the allied campaign on the Macedonian front in May 1918 helped secure an Entente military victory in the Balkans.\n\nVenizelos’s consistent and tenacious support for the allies was seemingly vindicated by the defeat of the Central Powers in November 1918. However, many if not most, Greeks remained loyal to the exiled Constantine I even though he had backed the losing side. This loyalty may have been derived from the resentment felt toward the heavy handed way in which the allies had deposed Constantine I in June 1917, the continuance of martial law and Venizelos’s pro-longed absences abroad negotiating treaties and agreements with foreign powers.\n\nDiscontent with Venizelos was manifested when he surprisingly lost the November 1920 parliamentary elections. Ironically a vital contributing factor in regard to Venizelos’s defeat was King Alexander’s surprise death in October 1920 (His Majesty died from blood poisoning after he had been bitten by his pet monkey) because the issue of royal succession raised the prospect of Greece becoming a republic. The political situation was further complicated because Venizelos remained a monarchist even though his Liberal Party was becoming republican inclined.\n\nVenizelos understandably could not abide a return of Constantine I and he offered the throne to Prince Paul. The twenty year old prince adamantly refused to become king because His Royal Highness recognised his father and older brother’s rights super-ceded his. Admiral Pavlos Koundouriotis accordingly became regent and there was an expectation that a Liberal victory at the November 1920 parliamentary polls would be a precursor to Greece becoming a republic.\n\nThe Greek People Restore Constantine I\n\nThe upset landslide victory in November 1920 elections by the pro-Constantine Populists resulted in Admiral Koundouriotis making way as regent for the much beloved Dowager Queen Olga (who is the only Romanov since the 1917 Russian Revolution to actually exercise reigning royal prerogatives) and the new government of Dimtrios Gounaris calling a referendum on the question of re-instating Constantine I as king. This referendum (which in effect was the first held on Greece remaining a monarchy) was held despite strong opposition from the Allies. In spite of, or perhaps because of, allied opposition Constantine I was overwhelmingly restored in the December 1920 referendum and was welcomed on his return by massive and emotional crowds.\n\nThe restoration of an apparently pro-German monarch following the allied victory was a highly unusual, if not, unique occurrence. Unfortunately the apparent fairytale ending soon became a horror story for Constantine I. Turkey under General Mustafa Kemal (who later assumed the name Kemal Ataturk) refused to accept allied conditions imposed on his nation as a defeated power. It subsequently fell to Greece not only to hold its territorial gains in Asia Minor against Turkey but to enforce allied conditions on the previously defeated nation.\n\nDue to Ataturk’s military skill Greece was defeated in March 1921 in Asia Minor. Greece under the leadership of the Populist Party and with the support of Constantine I persevered in the face of military defeat only to be completely routed in August 1922. The July 1923 Treaty of Lausanne resulted in over 1.5 million Greeks been expelled and the massive influx of refugees into Greece caused great dislocation. The loss of territory to Turkey and the arrival of displaced refugees combined with substantial existing pro-Venizelos sentiment created a groundwork for definite shift toward a republican future.\n\nMilitary Backed Republicanism: The Second Hellenic Republic\n\nIn the wake of Greece’s military defeat General Nicholas Plastiras staged a bloody military coup in September 1922 in which six generals and Prime Minister Dimtrios Gounaris were later executed. Constantine I was deposed and banished to Italy where His Majesty died a broken man in January 1924. The extremism of Plastiras’s action may have pleased those Greeks embittered by military defeat and population expulsion but there were also many who were appalled and as such remained staunchly loyal to their monarchy. General Plastiras’s violent action generated much passion which concealed his and his cohort’s shared culpability for the 1922 military defeat.\n\nFor General Plastiras and the military council that now ruled Greece the maintenance of the Greek monarchy was a danger. The executions represented a point of no-return. From the perspective of Greece’s military rulers the abolition of the monarchy was a necessity. Constantine I’s abdication resulted in Crown Prince George’s ascension to the throne as George II. There was still an existing base of monarchist support within the military which militated against an immediate move to a republic.\n\nAn abortive monarchist military coup led by Metaxas (who had been previously retired from the army) in October 1923 made the transition to a republic all but inevitable particularly as the Populist Party boycotted the December 1923 parliamentary elections. The new parliament on convening banished George II and remaining members of the royal family. Admiral Koundouriotis again became regent and the Liberal Party dominated parliament authorised a referendum to be held in March to make Greece a republic.\n\nVenizelos again became prime minister in January 1924 but resigned in early February due to his unease at his Liberal Party’s republicanism. The March referendum predictably made Greece a republic due to half the electorate adhering to the Populist Party boycott of the referendum. Admiral Koundouriotis was then elected ‘president’ in April by the parliament of the Second Hellenic Republic. (The First Hellenic Republic was that led by Kapodistrias).\n\nThe refusal by Venizelos to serve as prime minister under the new republic was a wise and ethical one. Someone as brilliant as Venizelos appreciated that his long term political viability would have been fatally undermined by serving as prime minister of a compromised republic. Venizelos knew that half the population were immediately alienated from the new republic and that the impetus for its creation was due to a clique of military officers wishing to safeguard their positions after carrying out a bloody military purge.\n\nAnxiety on the part of the army officers who had staged the 1922 coup was increased on their part for fear of the new republic becoming a functional democracy by the monarchist Populist Party eventually taking part in politics. The exiled Greek royal family*knew that in contrast to other recently deposed European royal families that they stood a realistic chance of being restored because one of the nation’s two major parties remained monarchist. Divisions between the Liberals and the Populists before the First World War had been based on patronage but the contemporary issue of a republic versus a monarchy was now the defining issue of division.\n\n(*George II first moved to Roumania and then to London, with his Roumanian wife, Queen Elisabeth, a Roumanian princess, whom he divorced in June 1935).\n\nFear that the Populist Party’s eventual re-entry into politics might lead to a restoration of monarchy led to General Theodoros Pangalos, one of the leaders of the 1922 revolt, to stage a coup in June 1925. ‘President’ Koundouriotis initially acquiesced to the Pangalos dictatorship before being deposed in January 1926 as a prelude to the dictator being ‘elected’ unopposed as ‘president’ later that year.\n\nA powerful myth that assails the Greek monarchy is that it worked in collusion with the Greek military to foist dictatorship on Greece. In fact banishments of the Greek royal family and the establishments of republics in 1924 and in 1973 were due to the Greek military’s hostility toward the monarchy. Strained relations on the part of the Greek monarchy with avowedly monarchist army leaders such as Metaxas (in the 1930s) and Field Marshal Alexandros (in the 1950s) laid the groundwork for a clique of covertly republican colonels to stage a military coup in 1967.\n\nThe first open republican military dictatorship of General Theodoros Pangalos not only deepened monarchist opposition to the military within society but threatened to alienate republican Greeks who had supported the 1922 military coup. General George Kondylis, one of the leaders the 1922 coup therefore staged a coup in August 1926 to disengage the military from an unpopular dictatorship.\n\nGeneral Kondylis’s intention of restoring democratic constitutional rule still roused fear among elements of the military that they would be held to account for the 1922 purge. Accordingly Colonel Napoleon Zervas* attempted to block a restoration of civilian rule. It was only after General Kondylis had forcibly dissolved Zervas’s Republican Guard in September 1926 that the way was cleared for Admiral Koundouriotis’s reinstatement as ‘president’ and for parliamentary elections to be held in November 1926.\n\n(*Zervas re-emerged during the Second World War as one of the major resistance leaders as head of the National Republican Greek League, E.D.E.S.).\n\nThe November 1926 parliamentary elections were a near circuit breaker which almost clinched the Second Hellenic Republic’s legitimacy and survival. The Populist Party’s participation and strong showing in these elections potentially reconciled monarchist orientated Greeks to the Second Hellenic Republic. Prospects for republican consolidation were further enhanced by the formation of a government of national unity following the 1926 elections between the two major parties led by the highly respected non-party Alexandros Zaimis. (Zaimis had previously established his sterling reputation as High Commissioner for Crete following Prince George’s resignation in 1906).\n\nThe wisdom of Venizelos’s previous withdrawal from Greek politics to maintain his democratic bona fides was seemingly vindicated when he led the Liberal Party to election victory in 1928 to again become prime minister. The transition to a democracy did not however consolidate the republic because monarchist sentiment had not been fully extinguished. Furthermore the Greek military’s hostility toward any prospect of a royal restoration, no matter how seemingly remote only strengthened monarchist resolve with those who were uneasy about the conditions in which the republic had been born.\n\nPrince Andreas Helps Revive Monarchism\n\nThe issue of monarchical restoration discreetly re-emerged in 1929 when the idea was advanced that parliament elect Prince Andreas as the next ‘president’ in succession to ‘President’ Koundouriotis. Prince Andreas was a son of George I and an uncle of the exiled George II. The prince (who was the father of Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh) was scapegoated for military defeat by the Turks at the Battle of Sakaryu in 1921 and sentenced to death by a farcical military tribunal in 1922.\n\nA British warship HMS Calypso was despatched to Athens to rescue Prince Andreas and it was under the threat of military action that the prince and his family (including an eighteen month Prince Phillip) departed Greece in December 1922. The threatened British military intervention would later be cited by republicans to support their contention that the Greek royal family was beholden to foreign interests.\n\nIn fact that the threatened British intervention was due to pressure brought to bear by the British establishment on George V to use his influence to save Prince Andreas. The British king was never fully forgiven by the establishment for His Majesty’s role in denying the deposed Nicholas II of Russia and his family refuge following the 1917 Revolution. This refusal cost Nicholas II and His Majesty’s family their lives.\n\nGeorge V was further discredited because it was widely believed in establishment circles that Nicholas II would have had the decency and courage to have done the right thing by his British relatives had a similar situation arisen. It was in this context British military action was threatened to save a prince whose nephew had not (to say the least) supported the allied side during the First World War.\n\nPrince Andreas in his own right had demonstrated great courage during his court martial which endeared him to those Greeks who were disgusted by the 1922 purge. The exiled prince’s mooted 1929 presidential candidacy was never really viable because the Populists were then the minority party. However fear that a military coup might ensue if Prince Andreas was elected ‘president’ drove the point home for many Greeks that they did not have the ultimate right to determine their constitutional destiny. This realization in turn bolstered monarchist sentiment.\n\nFormer General Metaxas struck a raw nerve when he put the issue of monarchical restoration to the forefront of politics of the Second Hellenic Republic. However, contrary to popular opinion, Metaxas was not always an avowed monarchist. He had returned to Greece to take part in the 1926 parliamentary elections as leader of the newly founded Free Opinion Party. This party initially accepted the Second Hellenic Republic and was a major threat to the Populist Party on the centre-right. Due to bitter in-fighting within the Free Opinion Party its vote steeply declined in successive elections between 1926 and 1936. To maintain political relevance Metaxas recast himself as a staunch monarchist to hold onto a hardline monarchist voting base.\n\nMetaxas’s avowed monarchism highlighted that ultimate power lay with the military. Even though the Second Hellenic Republic was supposed to be democratic, press censorship restrictions against advocacy of a royal restoration existed which served to foster monarchist sentiment.\n\nDue to a financial crisis Venizelos failed to win re-election in 1932 and in March 1933 (after an intermediary period of political instability) the monarchist inclined Populists led by Panayiotis Tsaldaris were elected to office*. The new prime minister had previously been imprisoned for his loyalty to the monarchy. He had courageously called for full press freedom and had called for a reinstatement of the monarchy.\n\n(*A military coup was attempted by General Plastiras on the Populists winning the 1933 elections but had failed due to opposition from Venizelos).\n\nThe Integrity of Panayiotis Tsaldaris\n\nAlthough a staunch monarchist Tsaldaris was prepared to serve as prime minister under the republic until a democratic referendum restored the monarchy. The threat of a republican military coup re-emerged in April 1934* when parliamentary election of a ‘president’ again paradoxically brought the issue of a royal restoration to the fore. Alexandros Zaimis, who had previously served as a non-party prime minister between 1926 and 1928 and had been elected ‘president’ by the parliament in 1929 and was re-elected as a compromise in 1934.\n\n(*The marriage of Britain’s Prince George, the Duke of Kent, to George I’s cousin Princess Marina in October 1934 generated rumours that went round the Athens cafes circuit that the newly wed royal couple could become the new King and Queen of Greece as part of a political compromise. It was expected amongst the British royal family that the Duke of Kent would ascend the throne on the abdication of Edward VIII in December 1936 instead of his painfully shy older brother Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who became George VI. During the Second World War it was rumoured that the anti-Soviet Duke of Kent (who was killed in a flying accident in 1942) was offered to be made king of Poland by the Polish Prime Minister in exile, General Wladyslaw Sikorski (who also later died in a plane crash) on condition of Britain helping secure genuine Polish independence at the end of the Second World War).\n\nBut the issue of royal restoration did not go away because Prime Minister Tsaldaris would not let go of the objective of asserting full civilian control over the military. The inter-related issues of monarchism and full civilian control came to the boil in March 1935 when a republican military coup was attempted. Although it is not fashionable for the point to be made this coup would not have been undertaken without Venizelos’s support.\n\nWhy Venizelos supported the March 1935 coup is something of a mystery. The Greek statesman had being a monarchist (if only a sentimental one during the Second Hellenic Republic) and had consistently being a democrat. Had the March 1935 coup succeeded Greece at best would have returned to a military backed republic supported by approximately half the population as had been the case between 1924 and 1925 (a period during which Venizelos wisely refused to hold office under). At worst, a successful 1935 military coup could have meant a Venizelos backed Pangalos type of republic, similar to the 1925-1926 period.\n\nThe March 1935 military coup (which was again principally instigated by General Plastiras) undoubtedly would have succeeded had General Kondylis not took the stunningly surprising action of staging a counter-coup. The coup’s failure had the profound ramification of Venizelos fleeing to Paris where he died a broken man in March 1936. The failure of the 1935 coup meant that constitutional government remained intact as did the military’s latent political power. This time however military political power was directed at restoring the monarchy instead of blocking the institution’s return.\n\nEarly elections were held in June 1935 following the coup’s failure. Due to a Liberal Party boycott an overwhelmingly monarchist parliament was returned. Prime Minister Tsaldaris ironically found himself confronting a demand from a new military strongman that he promptly restore the monarchy. The prime minister was a staunch democrat who refused to act in an arbitrary manner. Consequently the prime minister and General Kondylis found that they were at cross-purposes.\n\nFor General Kondylis the creation of a republic in 1924 had safeguarded him (and his fellow cohorts) from any retribution for supporting the 1922 military coup. Similarly Kondylis’s role in ending the Pangalos dictatorship in 1926 had seemingly secured his future against retribution for having been part of an open military dictatorship. Consequently the prospect of supporting the 1935 coup against a monarchist majority of the population (albeit, probably a small majority) was not a prospect that General Kondylis savoured.\n\nGeneral Kondylis, who had risked his life by betraying the 1935 coup, was not however prepared to take any chances and in October 1935 he forced Tsaldaris from office, summarily sacked ‘President’ Zaimis* and proclaimed himself regent and prime minister. A referendum (which Greek republicans overwhelmingly boycotted) was hastily called in early November which showed a purported 96% support for a royal restoration. The general’s heavy handed actions unfortunately tarnished the legitimacy of the Greek monarchy, which in 1935 probably had majority support. Indeed Kondylis’s actions undermined one of the reasons why there was support for the Greek monarchy- resentment against the latent political power of the military under the Second Hellenic Republic.\n\n(*Photos of ‘President' Zaimis’s tearful but dignified departure from the palace bolstered existing republican sentiment and the legitimacy of the Second Hellenic Republic among republican Greeks).\n\n1935: Monarchy Restored\n\nGeorge II on his return home in late November refused to associate with Kondylis and consequently compelled the general to resign. A new caretaker government led by Constantine Demertzis was appointed and new parliamentary elections were held in January 1936. The election results were disastrously indecisive. The convened parliament was near evenly divided between the Populists, (which were themselves divided into rival Tsaldaris and Kondylis wings) the Liberals and respective monarchist and republican aligned parties. The party that held the balance of power was the Communist Party of Greece (KKE)!\n\nThe political situation was further complicated by the respective deaths (of natural causes) between January and April 1936 of Venizelos, Tsaldaris, Kondylis and Demertzis. Venizelos’s death in March in Paris had the most profound impact. This was evident in the massive and emotional outpouring of grief at his funeral in Greece. The grief for Venizelos reinforced the sentiment and the notion that the monarchy was an imposed institution on Greece.\n\nThe late prime minister was held up as a martyr for Greek nationalism and democracy. Venizelos was probably the greatest modern Greek statesman in that he was primarily responsible for doubling Greece’s national territory. He had also been a democrat and a monarchist even though his base was overwhelmingly republican. Venizelos remained a monarchist (and a democrat) up until he tragically supported for the abortive 1935 military coup.\n\nHad Venizelos supported Tsaldaris (who always remained a democrat) the monarchy could have been restored in a democratic referendum and with that Greece could have avoided the turbulent divisions of the 1930s that spilled over during the German occupation and ultimately to the Greek Civil War of 1946 to 1949. Ironically Venizelos’s violation of his democratic principles fully reconciled him to the republicanism of his supporters.\n\nThe other tragic death in 1936 was that of Tsaldaris. His democratic principles and monarchism deprived the restored George II of a needed political base to steady a restored constitutional monarchy. The void created by Tsaldaris’s death was filled by his arch-rival on the centre-right, Ioannis Metaxas.\n\nThe Fourth of August 1936: Greece Avoids a Possible Communist Takeover\n\nIndeed with the deaths of Venizelos, Tsaldaris and Kondylis a void was created to the extent that the two major parties, the Liberals and the Populists consented to the king’s appointment of Metaxas as prime minister on the death of caretaker Prime Minister Constantine Demertzis in April 1936 as a compromise. Due to the polarised nature of the political situation the parliament was prologued and executive power was vested in an executive committee evenly composed of Liberals and Populists.\n\nThe very well organised KKE (led by the very able Nikos Zachariadis) utilized popular front methods to manipulate and attempt to appropriate the mass support of Liberal Party’s support base to support a general strike planned for August the 5th 1936. The prospect of this outcome occurring was viable due to the inexplicable decision of Liberal leader Themistoklis Souphoulis to enter into a pact with the KKE! The anxiety generated by the intended 1936 strike became such a legend that memoires of it were a factor in a substantial part of the population acquiescing to the Colonels’ coup of 1967.\n\nWith regard to the 1936 context George II was confronted with the prospect of a communist instigated and directed revolt leading to either civil war or a communist takeover. In order to safeguard the situation George II reluctantly acquiesced to the super efficient Metaxas taking strong counter measures to forestall the planned general strike by imposing martial law on August the 4th 1936.\n\nRoyal consent for the Metaxas dictatorship has been invoked by Greek republicans to legitimize their hostility toward the Greek monarchy. It should however be remembered that George II’s support for Metaxas was to forestall a genuine communist threat. The monarch envisaged Metaxas’s dictatorship as a necessary interregnum until democracy could be later restored. By contrast Metaxas regarded his dictatorship as a means to revamp what he regarded as the undisciplined the individuality of the Greek temperament to take Greece to a fascist future in keeping with the totalitarianism of Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany.\n\nGeorge II and Metaxas: The Concealed Rift\n\nThe differing objectives and intentions on the part of George II and Metaxas with regard to the August the 4th dictatorship were manifested by the intense rivalry between the regime’s National Organisation of Youth (EON) and the Boy Scouts. The latter youth organisation was under the patronage of George II’s brother Crown Prince Pavlos. Even though Greece under Metaxas was a tightly regimented dictatorship the Boy Scouts became a bastion for non-fascist Greeks who (similar to the Greek royal family) regarded the Metaxas regime as a transitory phenomenon.\n\nMetaxas was more interested and committed to EON than he was to his ephemeral August the 4th Movement. The rivalry between the two youth groups was often evident at official or semi-official ceremonies and functions. Although no-one would have known it at the time the dictator’s patronage of EON would later rebound on the Greek monarchy because the covertly republican colonels of the 1960s were influenced in the 1930s by Metaxas’s authoritarianism and subtle anti-monarchism.\n\nThe Metaxas regime (1936 to 1941) did have its successes. Public debts for small farmers were immediately cancelled on Metaxas coming to power. A public works program was undertaken and the civil service were pressured to be more responsive to public needs. A sound national currency with strong purchasing power was also achieved.\n\nAs Greece under Metaxas was officially corporatist state an eight hour working day was introduced, a concerted effort was made to extend education opportunities to all children and to end any notions of class distinctions. Something approximating a social welfare system was also introduced under Metaxas which has since led to an expectation on the part of future generation of Greeks that there always be a social security net.\n\nThe regime’s key success (even if temporary) was in destroying the apparatus of the KKE. The real threat of a communist revolution had been a crucial factor in Metaxas assuming near absolute power. It was subsequently a key objective of the regime to eliminate the well organised KKE. The Interior Minister Constantine Maniadakis ingeniously infiltrated the KKE at its highest levels to seemingly render the party ineffective.\n\nBut in a scenario similar to C.K. Chesterton’s 1908 book, The Man Who Was Thursday, some key regime operatives who had previously infiltrated the KKE actually went onto faithfully serve the KKE and its guerrilla front organisation the National Liberation Front/National Popular Liberation Army (E.A.M.-E.L.A.S) following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941.\n\nWhich Direction? Fascism and Monarchism Collide\n\nFor all the Metaxas regime’s successes its ultimate objectives were sinister because its underlying intention was to establish a fully-fledged and lasting totalitarian state. Metaxas openly admired Nazi Germany and the Greek regime was accordingly styled ‘The Third Hellenic Civilization’. Greece became a key trading partner with *Nazi Germany which used the country as its spring board to politically and economically infiltrate the Balkans.\n\n(*Eerily enough contemporary Greece in the wake of the 2008 GFC is now being used as a base for the People’s Republic of China, the PRC, to economically and politically infiltrate the Balkans).\n\nThe fascist objectives of the Metaxas regime were to be obscured by its effective resistance to the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940. Metaxas’s unambiguous ‘No’ to the farcical Italian ultimatum which would have reduced Greece to an Italian satellite was recognised by even anti-fascist Greeks as an act of heroism. Due to thorough military planning and preparation Greece not only successfully withstood the Italian invasion but by March 1941 was prepared to take Italian occupied Albania.\n\nThe conflicting objectives between George II and Metaxas were manifested with regard to profound disagreement as to whether an alliance with Nazi Germany should be entered into by Greece. Metaxas knew that Greece could not withstand a German intervention on behalf of the Italians. As a fascist Metaxas regarded his successful defence against the Italy as a prelude to Greece entering into an alliance with Nazi Germany whom he hoped would win the Second World War.\n\nGeorge II by contrast (who regarded the 4th of August regime as transitory) hoped for an allied victory and was opposed to any alliance with Nazi Germany. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill would never forget George II’s stance particularly in the wake of the fall of France in 1940 when continental allies of Britain were scarce.\n\nGreece Gains a Patriot: The Advent of Crown Princess Frederica\n\nIt should also be pointed out for historical accuracy that George II’s German sister in law Crown Princess Frederica was always staunchly anti-Nazi. Her Royal Highness was born in 1917 the daughter of Duke Ernest Augustus III of Brunswick-Gotha and Princess Victoria-Louise of Prussia. Duke Ernest Augustus III was also the claimant to the throne of Hanover. The kings of Hanover had reigned as kings of Britain from 1714 to 1837 until Queen Victoria’s ascension ended the link because female succession was not allowed in Hanover. The Kingdom of Hanover officially disappeared from the map of Europe when the kingdom was annexed by Prussia as a punishment for having supported Austria in the War of 1866.\n\nThe rift between the House of Hanover and the Hohenzollerns (the German imperial family) was apparently ended when Duke Ernest-Augustus and Princess Louise Victoria met, fell in love and were married in 1913. Despite the horrors of the First World War Duke Ernest-Augustus III resumed cordial relations with his royal British relatives following the war’s end.\n\nThe Duke’s anglophila was manifested by his hostility to the Nazi regime. At Princess Frederica’s marriage to Crown Prince Pavlos in January 1938 the Hanoverian flag was defiantly flown instead of the Swastika. During the Italian invasion the Nazi regime tried to use the Duke as an intermediary with his daughter to promote a German-Greek alliance. The Duke instead sent a coded message through to his relieved daughter urging the Greek government to resist any alliance with Nazi Germany.*\n\n(*The Duke’s anti-Nazism was unfortunately contradicted by the role that his wife Princess Louise-Victoria fulfilled in May 1940 in persuading her father, the deposed Wilhelm II, against taking up Winston Churchill’s offer to be flown to Britain from his Doorn estate in the Netherlands. The unflaggingly monarchist Churchill wanted to establish a royal German government in exile in London headed by Wilhelm II. Although the former German Kaiser, who deeply loved his grand daughter Crown Princess Frederica, unfortunately welcomed early German military successes he refused to allow his remains to be repatriated for a state funeral in Germany and at his own funeral in 1941, which he had previously planned, no Nazi paraphernalia was allowed).\n\nThe Second World War: Monarchy Breaks with Fascism\n\nThe concealed rift between George II and Metaxas was resolved when the dictator suddenly died of a heart attack in January 1941. Rumours circulated around Athens’s café circuit that Metaxas’s death was due to his coffee being poisoned. The August the 4th regime disintegrated on Metaxas’s death with the succession of the apolitical Alexandros Koyzis, the Governor of the Bank of Greece as the new prime minister. The German intervention did come in April 1941 and there was a sentiment amongst the pro-Metaxas officer army corps to collaborate with the conquering Germans.\n\nPrime Minister Koyzis committed suicide in April before the Germans took Athens as the government and royal family ironically evacuated to Crete. (Crete was a republican strong hold. Despite the effectiveness of the Metaxas regime’s repression this island still managed to revolt against the dictatorship in 1938). Before departing for Egypt George II notionally reconciled with the Liberal camp by appointing Emmaniouil Tsouderos as prime minister. Tsouderos was a Liberal Party leader and a one time supporter of Venizelos.\n\nGeorge II’s belated royal reconciliation with the Liberal camp only seemed to be of symbolic significance. The prospects for the Greek royal family ever returning to reign in their homeland seemed to be one of the most remote of all the exiled European royal families that had been banished by the Germans. Much of the Metaxas inclined officer corps that remained in the country did so because they were pro-German. Greece would have been a collaborationist country had it not being for the patriotism and courage of the vast majority of Greeks in resisting the Germans and Italians.\n\nUnfortunately a newly resurgent KKE moved into void by establishing the National Liberation Front/National Popular Liberation Army (E.A.M.-E.L.A.S). This guerrilla group appealed to the anti-fascism of Liberal republican orientated segments of society. Even E.A.M.-E.L.A.S’s major anti-communist rival was republican, the National Republican Greek League, (E.D.E.S) led by the staunchly republican Colonel Napoleon Zervas.\n\nThe monarchy’s limited mainstay of military support was undermined by a left wing mutiny of Greek troops stationed in Egypt in April 1944. This mutiny set the scene for a conference held in Beirut between the Cairo government (as the Greek Government in exile was known) and a communist dominated provisional underground government in occupied Greece. These two governments nominally merged to form a new government under the leadership of the republican Georgis Papandreou.\n\nThe new government’s non-communist components and George II subsequently moved to London in 1944. Following the German retreat from Greece in October 1944 Papandreou moved his government to Athens but without George II. Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens was appointed regent of Greece by the Papandreou government on its arrival in the Greek capital.\n\nIndeed not only was the prospect of a monarchical restoration slim but the chances of Greece withstanding a communist takeover were also correspondingly remote. The Greek government may very well have suffered the same fate as the royal Yugoslav government in exile which on its arrival in Belgrade in 1944 (without King Peter II) became a communist front. The Papandreou government avoided this outcome due to the landing and accompanying presence of British troops who landed in Athens and Salonika in October 1944. There were even clashes between ELAS and British troops in Athens in December 1944 (‘the December events’) which caused alarm in London and Moscow.\n\nDecember 1944: Winston Churchill Risks His Life for the Greek Monarchy\n\nThe presence of British troops, who were greatly outnumbered by ELAS guerrillas, would not have been enough to stop a communist takeover had it not been for the extraordinarily brave decision of Winston Churchill to go to Athens on Christmas Day 1944. This action of Churchill’s helps puts lie to the circulated myth that the British leader sold out the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe to Stalin.\n\nThe myth of the Churchill sell out revolves round the British prime minister’s dealings with Stalin at Yalta in October 1944 where the two leaders signed the so-called Percentages Agreement. Under this ad hoc and scrawled agreement majority percentages with regard to respective levels of Soviet and British (soon to be American) spheres of influence in Central and Eastern European nations were allocated by the two leaders.\n\nThe Soviet majority percentage quartiles that were formulated (with the exception of Greece) reflected existing Soviet military strength in the cited nations. Had President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States agreed to Churchill’s plan to launch an allied liberation of the Balkans from Italy* in 1944 then the Soviet armies would have been cut off before they reached Central Europe and Eastern Europe.\n\n(*Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s support for the Italian monarchy between 1943 and 1945 was a major reason for its survival and a source of its lingering power. Had Churchill won the 1945 British general elections a six month extension for the 1946 referendum on Italy’s continuance as a monarchy probably would have been granted and the Interior Minister Giuseppe Romita consequently could not have rigged the June 1946 referendum that made Italy a republic).\n\nPresident Roosevelt’s refusal to support Churchill and naïve preference for Stalin was due to the president’s bitterness concerning the way in which the British and French had deified President Woodrow Wilson at the Versailles Conference in 1919. As a result President Roosevelt had a paranoid fear about British ‘imperialism’ in the post-war era which greatly contributed to the later artificial post-war division of Europe.\n\nThe overlooked irony of the Percentages Agreement was that the only nation that Stalin granted a majority percentage to Britain was Greece even though communist ELAS troops had an overwhelming military advantage. Prime Minister Churchill’s physical presence in Athens caused Stalin (who was keen to avoid any possible inter-allied rift before Germany was fully defeated) to restrain the Greek communists. During his sojourn in Athens Churchill came to admire Papandreou (‘The Old Fox’) and Archbishop Damaskinos for their staunch anti-communism. This was despite Churchill’s initial antagonism toward the two Greek leaders due to their reluctance to immediately restore George II.\n\nThe vital consequence of Churchill’s visit to Athens was that the Soviets placed pressure on the KKE to adhere to the February 1945 Varkiza Conference where the communist partially disbanded and the military authority of the Greek government, backed by British troops, expanded. Papandreou resigned in February 1945 as prime minister and over the next thirteen months a series of prime ministers were appointed by Archbishop Damaskinos. These prime ministers (which included the notorious General Nicholas Plastiras) were republican inclined or at the very least supportive of the Archbishop’s desire to indefinitely extend his regency.\n\n1946: Constantine Tsaldaris’s Integrity Secures the Monarchy’s Improbable Return\n\nThe military position of these transitionary governments rested not only on British military support but also on a precarious co-operation between the anti-communist (but republican) E.D.E.S. and the military forces (the ‘Security Battalions’) of the former collaborationist regime of Ioannis Rallis. The ‘Security Battalions’ were *republican orientated but they were more sympathetic toward the monarchist inclined Populist Party than the Liberals which had close links to the rival E.D.E.S component within the merged non – communist military.\n\n(*The Security Battalions were overwhelmingly republican as they were predominately drawn from the military faction that had previously supported the republican military dictatorship of General Pangalos).\n\nThe March 1946 parliamentary elections were essentially a re-run of the January 1936 elections in that the nation was polarized between a Populist Party led monarchist coalition led by Constantine Tsaldaris* and a Liberal Party led republican coalition led by Themistoklis Souphoulis. The major difference between the 1936 and the 1946 elections was that the KKE boycotted the elections and prevented people in areas under its control from voting. Consequently the Tsaldaris led Populist coalition won the 1946 parliamentary elections.\n\n(*Constantine Tsaldaris was the nephew of the late Panayiotis Tsaldaris. The former utilized his family’s extensive network and his late uncle’s immense prestige to relaunch the Populist Party. A vital ingredient in relaunching the Populist Party was an appeal to existing monarchist sentiments).\n\nThe Tsaldaris family represented the best of democratic monarchist traditions. It was at Prime Minister Constantine Tsaldaris’s insistence that Archbishop Damaskinos reluctantly agreed to a referendum in September on the question of George II being restored to the throne. The 69% vote in favour of George II was partly due to a communist instigated boycott. The KKE was not adversely affected by George II’s return to Greece in September 1946 because it provided the communists with the needed pretext to launch a civil war to take power.\n\nThe Monarchy Saves The Day: The Greek Civil War, 1946 to 1949\n\nThe KKE launched their post-referendum military bid for power on the basis that a financially weak Britain would be unable to help Greece and that the republican Liberals would withhold their support for the restored monarchy. The latter assumption did not come to fruition. This was partly because Constantine Tsaldaris graciously ceded the prime ministership in 1947 to the Liberal leader Themistoklis Souphoulis. A succession of coalition cabinets between the Populists and the Liberals facilitated needed anti-communist national unity throughout the civil war.\n\nThe communist assumption that Britain would be unable to help militarily was correct and this opened the question of whether the United States would step into the breach. President Harry Truman’s decision to aid Greece (and a Soviet threatened Turkey) came with the unveiling of the Truman Doctrine in March 1947 which undoubtedly saved Greece from a communist takeover.\n\nThe president’s decision not to revert to American isolationism was partially due to the impact of Churchill’s ‘Iron Curtain’ speech in Fulton Missouri in March 1946. In his speech the now British Opposition Leader Churchill warned that Europe would be divided into communist and non-communist spheres and that the latter would eventually succumb without American support. The speech was also moving because Churchill singled out Greece. Churchill predicted that Greek heroism would prevail over the communist threat but emphasised that Greece desperately needed American military and economic aid.\n\n(Churchill was always very proud of his role in supporting the Greek monarchy. He was elated by the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 and very grateful to George II for refusing to go into an alliance with the Nazi Germany in 1941. From the 1950s to the early 1960s Churchill annually holidayed and painted on the Greek island of Corfu. A member of the Greek royal family, as expected by Churchill, always visited him on Corfu).\n\nThe subsequent inflow of American military and economic aid removed the threat of an imminent communist military victory. The Greek Civil War was in effect won when Tito’ Yugoslavia cut off aid to the Greek communists in June 1948 after being expelled from the Soviet bloc. Even without access to Soviet aid the KKE was a formidable threat because their strategy was premised on causing social dislocation. The communists carried out the barbaric practices such as sending children from occupied areas to Soviet bloc nations and by assassinating community leaders to facilitate the societal breakdown thought necessary to achieve victory.\n\nPerhaps the most important role that the Greek royal family made was that they provided a counter-force during the civil war that crucially rallied civilian and military morale. Nonetheless George II was understandably uncertain when he died in April 1947 of whether Greece could withstand the communist threat. The twice restored king was succeeded as king by his brother Crown Prince Pavlos.\n\nThe Unfair Vilification of Queen Frederica\n\nThe most important member of the Greek royal family that emerged in resisting the KKE was Queen Frederica. The queen was at the forefront of arriving at villages to rescue children who might otherwise have been abducted by the communists and generally providing humanitarian assistance where she could through Her Majesty’s Royal Aid Society. Another very important function that the queen fulfilled was in visiting the troops, often on the front line, to bolster their morale.\n\nQueen Frederica continued with her substantial charity activities following the civil war and this contributed to the royal family maintaining a devoted following which probably helps explain existing monarchist sentiment in contemporary Greece. The queen understood that royalty had to remain close to the people to survive and the there was no more important period to apply this dictum than during the civil war.\n\nUsually when a royal figure fulfils an important public role he or she becomes a symbol of national unity and purpose that transcends political differences. This was not to be the case with Queen Frederica. Those who supported the communist side (or perceived to have supported the KKE) were often ostracised following the civil war’s end in October 1949. For these people Queen Frederica became a symbol of right-wing oppression.\n\nAnother reason why Queen Frederica became an often hated figure was because Her Majesty was involved in Greek politics. However this involvement was often undertaken out of necessity. A closer analysis of Queen Frederica’s actions indicate that Her Majesty was motivated by a desire to promote democracy and ultimately ensure that the Greek monarchy became an institution that was above politics.\n\nMarshal Papagos and the Parastate\n\nA key factor in defeat of the KKE was the emergence of a political-security apparatus that became known as the ‘parastate’. The United States poured massive military aid to the Greek armed forces and with American help a Greek Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was created. The military and the Greek CIA were virtually independent of successive civilian governments. A key figure in the security apparatus was General Alexander Papagos who on becoming commander in chief of the armed forces in 1949 was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal.\n\nPapagos was the army chief of staff when the Greek army effectively resisted the Italian invasion of 1940. The Germans asked Papagos to lead a collaborationist regime but he famously replied that England loses every battle except the last. For his defiance General Papagos was deported to a German concentration camp in 1943. Freed in 1945 General Papagos returned to Greece that year to become one of the leading figures in resisting the KKE.\n\nGreece seemingly moved to the left in 1950 when the Liberal led coalition led by Nicholas Plastiras won the parliamentary elections. However the defeat of the Populists only facilitated Field Marshal Papagos’s formal political rise to power. Following a period of unstable coalition government, which further contributed to the break down of the established party system, Field Marshal Papagos retired from the army and formed a new political party called the Greek Rally. This new party won a plurality of seats in parliamentary elections in September 1951. A special parliamentary committee was formed which drew up a new constitution that was ratified in December 1951.\n\nElections under the new constitution were held in November 1952 which led to a landslide victory for Papagos’s Rally. The new constitution enshrined new civil rights provisions but in reality Papagos’s rise to power consolidated the parastate. The Greek CIA maintained extensive files on most citizens. Security agencies infiltrated the press, political parties (which often consequently split) and supported youth and professional organisations to carry out spying operations to prevent any possible leftist mobilization. Trade unionism was permitted but unions were prevented from having a political dimension to them that went beyond labour matters.\n\nThe emergence of the parastate had the strong support of an estimated 35% of the population who in the wake of the civil war were intensely anti-communist and monarchist. The parastate’s viability was also underwritten by a generation who had been subjected to the fascism of Metaxas’s EON and therefore supported the existence of a quasi-authoritarian state.\n\nArmy officers and the security services often invoked their supposed loyalty to the Crown to justify their independence from civilian government authority. Ironically however it was Queen Frederica the seeming symbol of right wing oppression who was hostile to the parastate. Her Majesty was intelligent enough to know that societal divisions fostered by the parastate could eventually precipitate widespread future unrest. Queen Frederica established a counter-network amongst politicians, the public service, the armed forces and the security services that opposed Papagos.\n\nThe queen’s actions were risky and the monarchy’s continuance now came under threat from the Right. Any notion by Papagos of abolishing the monarchy was complicated by the fact that the parastate’s support base within the population that was overwhelmingly monarchist. Queen Frederica never received any credit for her opposition to Papagos. This was because Her Majesty did not popularize her struggle or attempt to reach out politically to republican inclined Greeks. To have done so would have possibly alienated the monarchy’s existing support base.\n\nThe Monarchy Commences its Break with the Parastate\n\nThe monarchy’s struggle with Papagos was resolved when he died of natural causes in October 1955. Acting on the advice of his political adviser Panagiotis Pipinelis King Pavlos appointed the Public Works Minister Constantine Karamanlis as the new prime minister. This appointment was a surprise because the king had bypassed more senior ministers such as Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos. The royal bypassing of Stephanopoulos was particularly controversial because most of the previous Populist Party component that had gone into the Greek Rally was loyal to him.\n\nKaramanlis’s appointment therefore helped precipitate the breakdown of the Greek party system as the new prime minister founded the National Radical Union (ERE) which clearly and fairly won the February 1956 parliamentary elections. The appointment of a relatively politically unknown such Karamanlis as prime minister helped the monarchy break with the Papagos legacy. Under Karamanlis’s leadership cautious moves were made to curb the parastate. This was manifested when Karamanlis had over one thousand communist prisoners released before the February 1956 elections.\n\nThe major achievements of the Karamanlis era (1955 to 1963) were financial reforms to strengthen the drachma aimed to ultimately take Greece into the European Economic Community (EEC). Foreign investment was encouraged to stimulate economic growth and the foundations of a thriving tourist industry were established. Greece under Karamanlis maintained a pro-western foreign policy orientation. (Greece had previously joined the Council of Europe in 1949 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO in 1951).\n\nA giant step in dismantling the parastate was undertaken when emergency measures in place since the civil war were rescinded in July 1962. The progressive dismantling of the parastate under Karamanlis was previously apparent when the pro-communist United Democratic Left (EDA) emerged as the major opposition party following the May 1958 parliamentary elections*. The pro-communist left’s (the KKE was formally banned) reflected widespread discontent amongst segments of society that felt aggrieved by the continuance of the parastate. This upset upsurge by the EDA was also due to the splintering of the Liberal Party and Greek Rally into a myriad of political parties in the wake of Papagos’s death and Karamanlis’s rise to power.\n\n(*Under the 1952 constitution incumbent prime ministers were obliged to step down in favour of impartial caretaker governments which held office during the election campaign period).\n\nKing Pavlos Helps Revive The Liberal Camp\n\nAt Prime Minister Karamanlis’s instigation King Pavlos conciliated amongst the non-communist opposition parties to help form a non-communist opposition party in 1961, the Centre Union. This party essentially brought together the two main rivals within the Liberal camp, Georgis Papandreou and Sophoklis Venizelos, the son of Eleutherios Venizelos. The Centre Union also brought in figures from the political right represented by Spiros Markezinis and Stephanos Stephanopoulos who had been associated with Papagos.\n\nIt was ironic that Greece’s equivalent of a conservative political party, the ERE, was avowedly ‘radical’ and its major parliamentary opponent was avowedly centrist. These two parties, the ERE and the Centre Union, were thought to be metamorphisms of Greece’s respective liberal and conservative parties. The events that unfolded under the leadership of Georgis Papandreou and his son Andreas were to ensure that the ideological dichotomy in Greek politics would eventually be between a liberal/conservative party and a left-wing populist socialist party.\n\nGeorgis Papandreou and Sophoklis Venizelos went into the October 1961 elections as the co-leaders of the Centre Union. Following the Centre Union’s narrow loss George Papandreou emerged as the Centre Union’s de facto leader by launching his ‘unyielding struggle’ against electoral fraud he alleged had secured the ERE’s re-election. The allegations were not credible because a respected caretaker government was in place at the time of the 1961 elections.\n\n(Spiros Markezinis, a principal leader of the Centre Union, realized that a major objective of Papandreou’s civil disobedience campaign was to generate a left wing social movement. Markezinis consequently split from the Centre Union after the 1961 elections to form the Progressive Party).\n\nPapandreou’s civil disobedience campaign was sustained by those who resented the parastate. In fact Papandreou’s ‘unyielding struggle’ was not really against electoral fraud but against the parastate. The campaign intensified when an EDA Member of Parliament George Lambrakis was fatally wounded by two right wing youths allegedly linked to a parastate organisation at a rally in Salonika in May 1963. Lambrakis’s death generated further demonstrations and political passion.\n\nThe Papandreous’ Commence Their ‘Unyielding Struggle’ Against Political Moderation\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight the ‘unyielding struggle’ was probably orchestrated by Georgis Papandreou’s son Andreas. In 1959 Karamanlis invited Andreas to return from the United States to conduct an economic symposium in Athens and to become an economics adviser to the Greek government. The younger Papandreou was a Harvard PhD graduate and was then a well regarded economics academic.\n\nBy inviting Andreas Papandreou in 1959 to return to Greece Karamanlis commenced the tragic pattern of attempting to politically moderate Papandreou which the latter would shamelessly turn to his advantage. Prime Minister Karamanlis also erred in thinking that Andreas would moderate (indeed the exact opposite happened) his father due to his years in the United States as an academic.\n\nIn fact Andreas Papandreou had been a Trotskyite in his youth. He had evidently discarded his youthful Marxism as an academic. But Andreas Papandreou retained an appreciation of Trotskyite methodology. As such Andreas Papandreou understood how to create a strong political organisation to gain political power by instigating and utilizing mass campaigns of civil disobedience.\n\nThe underlying discontent that existed within a substantial part of population that was alienated by the parastate provided Andreas with the scope to create a political base for himself and to pursue his objective of taking power in his own right. Integral to Andreas Papandreou’s desire to take power was a determination to establish a political apparatus through which he could exercise power over Greek society. In such a context a key Andreas Papandreou objective was to abolish the Greek monarchy.\n\nDespite King Pavlos’s role in helping found the Centre Union Georgis Papandreou launched a vicious campaign against the king claiming that His Majesty ruled instead of reigned. This attack on King Pavlos was unfounded because His Majesty’s political actions, such as Karamanlis’s surprise appointment and helping to form the Centre Union, had been aimed at promoting political moderation to facilitate the progressive dismantling of the parastate.\n\nFurthermore King Pavlos and the royal family excelled in fulfilling non –political civic functions and charity work. The public affection that the royal family was held by a substantial part of the population was evident by the widespread celebrations in Athens in May 1962 when King Pavlos’s older daughter Princess Sophia married Prince Juan Carlos, son of the then Spanish claimant, Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona*. (This royal wedding was the largest gathering of royalty since the First World War).\n\n(*The royal couple are now the king and queen of Spain. The sterling success of the post- 1975 restored Spanish monarchy is testament to what might have been had in Greece had it not been for the chicanery of the Papandreous and the tragic intervention of Colonel George Papadopoulos).\n\nCrown Prince Constantine\n\nCrown Prince Constantine excelled as a non-political royal. His Royal Highness was charming and handsome. Born in June 1940 Constantine was raised in war-time exile in South Africa. (Interestingly Nelson Mandela officially invited Constantine II to his May 1994 presidential inauguration). The Crown Prince received an excellent education in which he attended a special school composed of students that were selected from a representative range of Greek society. His Royal Highness also received training in each of the three branches of the Greek armed forces.\n\nHis Royal Highness excelled in sports becoming a black belt in karate and a champion yachtsman. Indeed the twenty year old seemingly gained the nation’s adoration when he won an Olympic gold medal in yachting at the Rome 1960 Summer Olympics. The Crown Prince’s popularity was also bolstered by his attachment to the movie star *Aliki Vougiouklaki . Their amicable break up was erroneously attributed to snobbishness on the part of Queen Frederica.\n\n(*Many Greeks today believe that had Constantine II married Aliki Vougiouklaki that her continuing popularity may have influenced the vote for a reinstatement of a Crowned Democracy in December 1974).\n\nRace Against Time: Queen Frederica Moves to Fully Reconcile with the Liberal Camp\n\nQueen Frederica did have genuine concerns about her son’s future when King Pavlos was diagnosed with cancer in 1963. Her Majesty worried that her politically disinterested son would be unable to cope with the political machinations of Georgis Papandreou’s ‘unyielding struggle’. The queen consequently believed that the monarchy had to reach a reconciliation with the Liberal camp (in the form of Centre Union) before her son ascended the throne.\n\nQueen Frederica believed that the good will of the Centre Union could be gained without alienating the overwhelmingly monarchist ERE if the monarchy broke with Karamanlis. The ascension of George Papandreou the queen believed would be counteracted by the almost corresponding power of Sophoklis Venizelos within the Centre Union. Indeed it was expected that the septuagenarian Papandreou might die during the course of the following parliamentary term to be succeeded by the staunchly monarchist Sophoklis Venizelos. At any rate it was believed that the younger Venizelos would exercise a restraining influence on Georgis Papandreou. Furthermore Queen Frederica envisaged that a Centre Union government would fully dismantle the parastate, which an ERE government could not do due to opposition from its voting base. Such an outcome Her Majesty believed would allow the Greek Crown to make the transition to being a fully non-political monarchy.\n\nThe queen attempted the political shift after she and her daughter Princess Irene were accosted by left-wing demonstrators while on a private visit to London in 1963. Therefore when Prime Minister Karamanlis advised King Pavlos to cancel his scheduled official* visit to London scheduled for later that year the king declined to do so on his wife’s advice. As Queen Frederica had probably intended Karamanlis consequently resigned as prime minister in June 1963 due to the royal refusal to heed his advise.\n\n(* Karamanlis’s prediction proved to be correct and the Greek royal visit was marred by extensive hostile demonstrations in Britain. Elizabeth II on accompanying the royal Greek couple was booed and this caused Her Majesty to publicly cry for the first time).\n\nKaramanlis’s resignation ended his previous close friendship with Queen Frederica. Although no-one would have known it at the time Karamanlis would later have his revenge on the Greek royal family, particularly on Queen Frederica. But just as Karamanlis’s mishandling of Andreas Papandreou would fall into a tragic counterproductive pattern his malice against the Greek royal family would have profoundly negative consequences for Greece.\n\nPanagiotis Pipinelis, the outgoing Commerce Minister in the Karamanlis government, and one of King Paul’s key political advisers, formed a caretaker government on Karamanlis’s resignation. A successor non-party caretaker government (led by Stylianos Mavromichalis, the President of the Supreme Court) was formed in September on Karamanlis’s return from a holiday abroad to contest the early elections scheduled for November 1963.\n\nThe pro-communist EDA won the balance of power in the November 1963 elections which resulted in Georgis Papandreou forming a minority Centre Union government. The historical ramification of the 1963 elections was that Karamanlis’s failure to win led to his resignation as ERE leader and departure for a Swiss exile. Karamanlis was succeeded by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos as ERE leader, who oddly enough, was a republican despite his party being overwhelmingly monarchist.\n\nGeorgis Papandreou served as prime minister for just over a month during which time he adroitly distributed patronage before resigning in December 1963 to be succeeded by another caretaker government which held office until new parliamentary elections were held in February 1964. These elections were convincingly won by the Papandreou led Centre Union.\n\nAlthough King Pavlos was gravely ill His Majesty insisted on officiating at the swearing in of the new government because this seemingly signified the monarchy’s final reconciliation with the Liberal camp. The fast paced series of events that had occurred since Karamanlis’s June 1963 resignation apparently culminated with King Pavlos’s death in early March 1964.\n\nThe widespread mourning following King Pavlos’s death and international tributes to His Majesty seemingly indicated that the Greek monarchy’s continuance was assured. Indeed the late king’s principal achievement seemed to have been gaining the monarchy’s overall acceptance. In retrospect King Pavlos’s main accomplishment was that His Majesty was the only Greek monarch who had both died peacefully and whose reign was uninterrupted.\n\nConstantine II’s ascension in March 1964 also seemed to consolidate the monarchy as the new king was known to be non politically minded. Perhaps the first ill-omen for Constantine II’s reign was that Sophoklis Venizelos died in early February before Papandreou was sworn in as prime minister.\n\nThe unexpected death of Sophoklis Venizelos inverted the sequence that Queen Frederica had envisaged of the aged Georgis Papandreou dying to be succeeded by the staunchly monarchist and moderate Venizelos. Nonetheless the Venizelos wing of the Centre Union was still strong and led by Sophoklis Venizelos’s strong minded nephew, the Finance Minister Constantine Mitsotakis. It was now generally expected that the new Centre Union government would proceed to fully dismantle the parastate.\n\nThe 1964 Royal Wedding: The Greek Monarchy Moves to Break with Politics\n\nThe monarchy’s scope to generate good will and national unity was seemingly apparent when Constantine II’s marriage to Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark was celebrated with great gusto in September 1964. (In the wake of King Paul’s death the royal wedding was brought forward from January 1965). The then eighteen year old Danish princess was the youngest of Frederick IX’s* three daughters and arguably the most beautiful and popular.\n\n(*Frederick IX’s father King Christian X did not wear a Star of David during the German occupation as was reputed. Jews in German occupied Denmark were not required to wear this symbol. However Christian X informed the Nazi Germans that if they introduced the Star of David he would wear one on his public daily ride through the capital to show solidarity with his Jewish subjects).\n\nThe announcement of Princess Anne-Marie’s engagement to the Greek Crown Prince in January 1963 was met with concern in Denmark that Her Royal Highness would be entering into dangerous political territory by marrying into the Greek royal family. There was also concern in Denmark as to what Princess Anne-Marie’s status would be in relation to Queen Frederica. Her Majesty retained the status of Queen Consort until her son married and it was known that Queen Frederica intended to maintain the title of ‘Queen’ after the royal wedding.\n\nKing Frederick IX’s televised endorsement of the marriage and public admonishment to the engaged couple to always love and support each other no matter what circumstances won over Danish public approval for the marriage. The Danish Parliament consequently consented in July 1964 to Princess Anne-Marie’s marriage. In the light of subsequent events the royal couple have lived up to the late Danish king’s injunction.\n\nQueen Anne-Marie brought no potential bloc vote (such as what Aliki Vougiouklaki might have) to fall back upon in a time of crisis. Nonetheless Queen Anne-Marie has consistently being a tower of strength for her husband and family. The main disadvantage of Constantine II’s marriage to Anne-Marie has being that it seemingly bolstered the republican charge that the Greek royal family ‘is not really Greek’, particularly because the queen comes from the dynasty’s country of origin.\n\nQueen Anne-Marie’s republican critics have never given her credit for converting to Greek Orthodoxy prior to her marriage, renouncing her rights to the Danish throne, giving her full allegiance to Greece and raising her children as Greeks. During the three years when Queen Anne-Marie lived in Greece Her Majesty undertook extensive charity activities through ‘Her Majesty’s Fund’. This charity supported a micro-credit scheme to help poor women.\n\nFurthermore Her Majesty was a constant support to husband throughout the period of political turmoil while always keeping out of politics. In many ways Queen Anne-Marie represents the best of what the Greek monarchy could have been had it not been for the chicanery of the Papandreous and the tragic stupidity of Colonel George Papadopoulos.\n\nThe marriage of Constantine II and Princess Anne-Marie in September 1964 was the first televised royal wedding in history. This wedding was watched by millions of people around the world and was international headline news. All of Athens seemed to celebrate the wedding. Prime Minister Georgis Papandreou attended the wedding in good spirits. Constantine II publicly heralded the prime minister as a replacement father figure in the wake of his father’s recent death.\n\nThe royal wedding was also noteworthy for the wide range of royals from around the world that attended. The Greek royal family did not recognize any distinction between deposed and reigning royalty. Constantine II insisted on according all visiting royals with full royal status, perhaps most touchingly to a moved King Farouk, the deposed and unfairly maligned former Egyptian monarch.\n\nThe Courageous Princess Alice\n\nThis royal wedding also highlighted the close links between the British and Greek royal families. Prince Charles and Princess Anne represented the British royal family and the Orthodox nun who greeted them at the airport was none other than their grandmother , Princess Alice! Their grandmother, was a British born German princess who married Prince Andreas in 1903.\n\nHer Royal Highness endured the travails of exile as a member of the Greek royal family. It was Prince Alice who appealed to the British to rescue her husband Prince Andreas from certain execution which they did by dispatching the HMS Calypso in 1922. Princess Alice had come up with the idea that her husband stand for ‘president’ of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1929. By the time of the monarchy’s restoration in 1935 Prince Andreas and Princess’s Alice marriage had however ended.\n\nPrincess Alice returned to Greece in 1938 where she devoted herself to charity work. Her Royal Highness was the most prominent member of the Greek royal family, along with Princess Elena, (a Russian Grand Duchess who was the mother of Princess Marina) to remain in Greece during the German occupation.\n\nThe impoverished princess utilized her contacts with the Swedish royal family (her sister was the Swedish Crown Princess) to provide needed aid to the inhabitants of war torn Athens. Princess Alice continued her charity work during and after the Greek Civil War. (The rival and respective charity work of Princess Alice and Princess Elena were cumulative contributing factors in the pro-king vote in the 1946 referendum). In 1949 Her Royal Highness founded a Greek Orthodox order of nuns, the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary. Wearing her order’s habit Princess Alice drew attention at her daughter in law’s coronation as British queen in 1953. Although Princess Alice maintained cordial relations with the Greek royal family Constantine II was closer to Princess Alice’s good natured rival Princess Elena who died in 1957.\n\nIt was only with the great reluctance that Princess Alice accepted her son’s offer to depart Greece to move to Buckingham Palace in 1967 following the colonels’ coup. Princess Alice’s accepted her son’s offer due to her ill-health. Domiciled in Buckingham Palace Princess Alice endeared herself to her grand children, always insisting that they address her, as ‘Yia’ the Greek for ‘grandmother’. Princess Alice died in December 1969.\n\nHer Royal Highness’s posthumous desire that she be buried in the Covenant of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem was realized in 1988. In 1994 Princess Alice was recognized by Israel as ‘Righteous among the Nations’ at the Yad Vashem memorial for those who had died in the Holocaust. This award was given to Princess Alice because Her Royal Highness had sheltered a Jewish family, the Cohens, in her Athens flat during the German occupation. A surviving member of the Cohen family attended the ceremony as did the Duke of Edinburgh and his sister Princess Sophie of Hanover.* Princess Alice’s life was testament that foreign royalty who married into the Greek royal family wholeheartedly gave their allegiance to Greece.\n\n(*Although Princess Sophie had married into German royalty Her Royal Highness remained a Greek Orthodox. Her Royal Highness poignantly gave the Orthodox sign of the cross at the award ceremony).\n\nThe Old Fox Averts Political Moderation: The Double Game of Georgis Papandreou\n\nQueen Anne-Marie was prepared to devote her life to Greece as Princess Alice had after marrying into the Greek royal family. Unfortunately Prime Minister Georgis Papandreou’s duplicity became apparent at the time of the royal wedding. Queen Frederica emerged from mourning to make her first public appearance at the wedding. Contrary to popular opinion Queen Frederica was not financially well off. Her Majesty confidentially wrote to the prime minister asking for help with her financial situation.\n\nGeorgis Papandreou leaked news of the queen’s private correspondence and then hypocritically came to Her Majesty’s defence. To further undermine Queen Frederica’s position Prime Minister Papandreou canvassed introducing new press censorship laws that made it les majesty to attack Queen Frederica.\n\nGeorgis Papandreou also undermined senior ministers in his government and he eventually assumed the ministerial portfolios of education and foreign affairs. Expected liberal reforms dismantling the parastate, such as releasing remaining communist prisoners were not enacted. The only substantial reform that Georgis Papandreou fulfilled was that of reforming the school syllabus.\n\nParticular controversy was attached early in the Papandreou prime ministership to the role of his son. In an act of blatant nepotism Andreas Papandreou was appointed deputy minister for economic co-ordination. Although Andreas was supposed to be pro-American it was he who moved to ban Voice of America broadcasts in Greece and who publicly opposed Greece’s membership of NATO. Even at this early stage their were allegations of corruption against Andreas Papandreou who was obliged to step down as minister in June 1964 over awarding a lucrative contract to a friend. After a cursory investigation Andreas Papandreou was re-instated in November that year as a minister.\n\nThe pattern that emerged with regard to Papandreou failing to come through on expected reforms and supporting his son was to project that he was being sabotaged by ‘reactionary’ elements within his government and party. In truth the Papandreou strategy was to raise expectations of reform, deliberately refrain from following through and then convert disappointment into a newly created left wing galvanized political base so that a break with the moderate elements of the Centre Union could be engineered. A raw nerve with regard to this political game was reached in June 1965 when the conservative press revealed the existence of a left-wing group of army officers that was directly linked to Andreas Papandreou!\n\nDemocracy Threatened: The ASPIDA Conspiracy\n\nThe revelation of the existence of ASPIDA (‘The Shield’) duly alarmed senior commanders of the Greek armed forces, particularly the army chiefs of staff. The prospect that the prime minister’s son was involved in ASPIDA (which was composed of 28 officers) also sent shudders down the spines of Greece’s army generals as the end of the brutal Greek Civil War had only ended less than twenty years before.\n\nTrue to form Prime Minister Papandreou moved took the crisis to another level instead of finding a political compromise. Andreas Papandreou moved to dismiss the moderate Defence Minister Petros Garoufalias in July 1965. As defence minister Georgis Papa"
