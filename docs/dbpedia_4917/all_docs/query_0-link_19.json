        "text": "ATHENS — Rena Dourou, the new prefect of Athens and a member of the left-wing Syriza Party, was taking stock of the cavernous office she inherited recently, making plans to move to a cheaper and more functional alternative.\n\n“Look at this place,” she said. “It will take me until Monday just to get from my desk to the door. And downstairs, you should see the space people are working in. I am not saying this because I am leftist. People need space to do proper work.”\n\nThe polls these days show that Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Syriza, just a marginal party until the economic crisis, may be poised for a victory in the next national elections, ending the lock that two parties have had on the government for more than four decades.\n\nBut for the time being, Ms. Dourou’s election as prefect, the rough equivalent of the governor of New York, represents the party’s biggest victory so far.\n\nPetite and blond, Ms. Dourou ran an American-style campaign, going door to door, something most Greek politicians avoid out of fear of being assaulted by angry citizens. On her office wall, she kept a map of the region with dozens of pins indicating where she had traveled. Few opinion polls correctly predicted her victory.\n\nBut she brought her handshakes and her motto — “if you feel you have the life you deserve, don’t do anything and vote for the same old people” — all over the city, even to areas considered bastions of the right-wing Golden Dawn party.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
