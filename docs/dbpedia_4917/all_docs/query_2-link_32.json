        "text": "Greece’s socialist leader yesterday admitted he had failed in a last-ditch bid to form a government, taking the nation a step closer to repeat elections as it faces increased EU pressure over its finances.\n\nPasok chief Evangelos Venizelos’s announcement came after the key radical leftist party Syriza refused to join a pro-austerity coalition with the socialists and conservatives, paving the way for weekend talks hosted by the President to try to stitch together an emergency unity government.\n\nThe latest twist in the tortuous political drama came as EU paymaster Germany threatened to cut off the country’s loan life-line and hinted that the crisis-ridden eurozone could get along without Greece.\n\nMr Venizelos was the third party leader who tried and failed to cobble together a government after inconclusive elections last Sunday that saw a backlash against painful austerity measures that have triggered sometimes violent protests.\n\n“I am going to inform the President of the Republic tomorrow (Saturday) and I hope that during the meeting with Carolos Papoulias, each party will assume its responsibilities,” Mr Venizelos told reporters in Athens.\n\nIf the parties cannot agree a compromise by next Thursday, new elections will have to be called. Mr Venizelos had been hoping to win the support of Syriza, a party deeply opposed to the terms of the €240 billion EU-IMF bailout and which surged to second place in Sunday’s vote.\n\n“It is not Syriza which is rejecting (joining a coalition with the socialists and conservatives) but it is the verdict of the people of Greece,” said party chief Alexis Tsipras.\n\nEarlier, another possible ally, the small Democratic Left party, said it would not join a government made up of only Pasok and the conservative New Democracy party that did not include Syriza.\n\nAn opinion poll published yesterday showed that Syriza could even emerge as the victor if new elections are held in June.\n\nEarlier this week both Mr Tsipras and New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras failed in their own attempts to assemble a coalition government.\n\nGerman leaders warned yesterday that Athens could expect no more money without reforms and also suggested that the eurozone would cope if the cash-strapped country left the 17-member currency union.\n\nGreece has already committed to finding in June another €11.5 billion in savings over the nexttwo years. It also needs to redeem €436 million in maturing debt on May 15.\n\nThe political deadlock saw the Athens stock exchange plunge 4.5 per cent yesterday after closing up 4.19 per cent on Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the week, the eurozone announced it was blocking €1 billion out of €5.2 billion in bailout loans until Monday.\n\n“We want Greece to remain in the eurozone,” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the regional Theinische Post in an interview published yesterday.\n\n“But it also has to want this and to fulfill its obligations. We can’t force anyone. Europe won’t sink that easily.”\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle warned Athens could expect no more money without reforms."
