These special bonds make it even more difficult for me to understand the refusal of the German government to discuss the issue of the occupation loan and of the war reparations. It is not only a pending issue that is casting a negative shadow on our relations. It is a crucial issue of political ethics.\"\n\n\"It is contradictory that the Greek people are called on to implement, without discussion, painful prerequisites and commitments and Germany to refuse to discuss commitments that are pending from World War II. To refuse negotiating. To refuse international arbitration. Meaning, to refuse international legality on resolving differences. Your position that 'there is no question' is an allegation. It cannot be promoted unilaterally as a final conclusion\", President Papoulias said.\n\nIn his reponse, the German president reiterated Germany's unwavering position that there can be no concrete assumption of responsibility over war reparations and the WWII debt except at an ethical and political level.\n\nGermany has recognised its responsibility for WWII and the atrocities carried out, but added that the crimes of Nazis in Greece are mostly unknown and unredeemed in Germany.\n\nSpeaking of the Greek crisis, he expressed the wish that Greeks have the strength to continue their reforms. \"Greek men and women needed to shoulder a lot during the last few years and to make personal sacrifices in order to create a future for their country and themselves,\" Gauck said. \"I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that Germany is aware of this and has acknowledged its importance,\" he added, wrapping up with references to the long-standing friendship between the two countries.\n\n[02] German president affirms his country's solidarity to Greece, in speech at Acropolis Museum\n\nVisiting German President Joachim Gauck affirmed Germany's solidarity to Greece and said that Europe was learning from its mistakes and reforming, in a speech at the Acropolis Museum on Thursday that was organised by the German Embassy and the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP).\n\n\"The purpose of my visit to Greece is to show Germany's solidarity,\" he said, speaking about relations between the two countries. Gauck noted that Greece extended a hand to Germany following World War II even though it suffered greatly under the Nazi occupation, and was forced to give a loan and became an object of financial exploitation. The German president also spoke of the murders of tens of thousands of people, and made special reference to Jews.\n\nHe also expressed his support of Greeks suffering under the crisis, and from unemployment, and said \"I can hardly imagine German reality coming under similar circumstances,\" adding that Europe must not condemn a whole generation to passivity.\n\nCalling on Greeks to show strength, patience and decisiveness, he expressed certainty the crisis would be overcome, and he noted that Europe is learning from its mistakes. At the same time, common institutions and policies were necessary between member-states to deal with the challenge of globalisation, and said that it would be hard to imagine what would have happened in Greece without European help.\n\nEarlier, when ELIAMEP president Loukas Tsoukalis introduced Gauck, he said the German president had lived in East Germany, had been a Lutheran pastor, was active in human rights and in the opening of the Stazi archives, and became president in 2012. He has often said he wants a European Germany, not a German Europe.\n\n[03] President Papoulias raises issue of war reparations in meeting with German counterpart Gauck\n\nGreece and Germany share a common future as part of their European course, Greek President Karolos Papoulias (L) on Thursday told visiting German Presi-dent Joachim Gauck (R), after an official welcome ceremony at the Presidential Mansion.\n\nDuring talks between the two presidents and the delegations of the two sides, however, Papoulias also returned to the issue of German war reparations and repayment of a forced WWII loan extracted from Greece by the Nazi regime.\n\n\"Greece has never waived its claims and a solution of the problems is demanded with the fastest possible launch of talks,\" Papoulias stressed in joint statements with his German counterpart.\n\nReplying, Gauck noted that he was \"unable to adopt any position other than the legal position of the German government. What I can do, when we go together to Ioannina, is to find the words and acknowledge Germany's guilt to the victims of the region. Guilt has not only a material but also a moral dimension,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the German president, there had been a mistaken development in Germany in that \"many things have passed into oblivion\" that should not have been forgotten. \"There is guilt of a moral order. I will show the way. The atrocities of Nazism must remain in our memory,\" he noted.\n\nPapoulias said that he briefed Gauck on the economic crisis and its effects in Greece: \"the reduction of the public deficit proceeded violently and had a severe economic and social cost.\n\nThe economy was plunged into a vicious cycle of recession and unemployment, which especially among young people has reached unacceptable levels.\"\n\nExpressing his \"respect\" for Greek citizens forced to cope with the reforms, as well as those who continue to carry them out, Gauck admitted that it was hard for him to imagine Germany if so many people from the public sector were left jobless. He noted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel often referred to the reforms taking place in Greece, adding that they were something more than a \"light at the end of the tunnel\".\n\nThe German president also expressed satisfaction that the majority of Greeks support the reforms, noting that Germany \"is on your side\".\n\nReferring to his trip to Ioannina in northwestern Greece with Papoulias on Friday, where he intends to pay homage to the victims of a Nazi mass execution in the village of Ligiades, he described the Greek president as a \"fighter\" that had \"struggled against those barbaric people\" and said he was happy to represent \"a completely different Germany from that you experienced then.\"\n\nGauck also mentioned the founding of a Greek-German Foundation for young people, modeled along the lines of similar institutions created by Germany with France and Poland, stressing the importance of exchange programmes for young people between the two countries.\n\nIn earlier statements while receiving his German counterpart, Papoulias noted Gauck's recent statements during a meeting on Security in Munich, highlighting the new responsibilities of all parties for international security.\n\n\"Germany can play an important role in that direction, so can Greece in its own region. We stand side-by-side on the path of peace,\" he pointed out.\n\nGauck said his visit aimed to demonstrate solidarity with Greece as a \"historic place\" and \"confirm the long-standing friendship between the two countries,\" which remained strong despite recent incidents and discussions.\n\n[04] Papoulias: German tourist arrivals indicate of the sincere understanding between the two people\n\nDuring talks that also included delegations of the two sides, Papoulias pointed out that 2.5 million German tourists visited Greece in 2013, while their number is expected to rise by 10 to 12 percent this year, indicating the Germans' love for Greece and its civilization.\n\nPapoulias said he was citing this \"as an example of the warm-hearted understanding between the two countries' peoples,\" before announcing a break so that Gauck might reply \"and to give Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras time to prepare and talk about the hardship he has been going through with the troika negotiations.\"\n\nOn his part, Gauck said that \"German tourists came to Greece, undismayed by press reports on the situation in the country\". He pointed out that he was accompanied by two persons without a political background, one of which is dealing with 'Distomo issue'. Distomo is south-central Greek village where in 1994 Nazis killed 214 civilians.\n\n[05] Parliament president hosts luncheon in honour of visiting German President Gauck\n\nThe visit of German President Joachim Gauck to Athens is proof of the very good, timeless, bilateral relations and a gesture of confidence toward Greece, Parliament President Evangelos Meimarakis said Thursday, when he hosted a formal luncheon in honour of the visiting president.\n\n\"Greece in its capacity as the EU Council president sees as a priority the issues of concern for both countries that are related with economic growth, employment in Europe and migration,\" the parliament president said.\n\nMeimarakis underlined the consequences of the economic crisis and the ordeal of the Greek people, particularly of the weak social groups.\n\n\"The Greek people have made big sacrifices and this is acknowledged by everybody. A lot has happened in a very short period of time. We continue with the necessary adjustments and reforms anticipating the support and solidarity of our partners,\" Meimarakis said.\n\nThe visiting German president spoke warmly of Greece, noting that \"the constantly repeated question on whether there is a real cohesion risk, namely if Europe could lose its cohesion, now seems very distant. The response to this question is nothing more than my visit here today\".\n\nCiting the words of Theodor Heuss, another German president, that Europe was built on three hills - the Acropolis in Athens, the Capitol in Rome and Calgary - Gauck said that he had the opportunity to visit one of those hills today.\n\n[06] FM Venizelos to meet with German President Gauck on Thursday\n\nGovernment Vice-President and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos will meet on Thursday with the German President Joachim Gauck.\n\nThe meeting will be held at 19:30 at the Grande Bretagne Hotel in central Athens, according to a ministry announcement.\n\n[07] SYRIZA leader holds meeting with German president\n\nMain opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) leader Alexis Tsipras met with German President Joachim Gauck at a downtown Athens hotel on Thursday afternoon, raising the issue of the deadlock of the \"ineffective and barbaric austerity measures\" that have been imposed on Greece and the countries of the European south, as well as the issue of German World War II reparations and the occupation loan.\n\nTsipras was accompanied by deputies Manolis Glezos and Nadia Valavani.\n\n\"It is unacceptable for unemployment among young people to amount to 60 percent and have Germany strangely refuse a solution such as the one that benefitted it after World War II, the 1953 Conference\", Tsipras said, adding that such a solution will lead to prosperity.\n\nGlezos said that they provided supportive arguments to Gauck as to why Germany must fulfill what the International Conference in Paris in 1946 determined, just as it fulfilled it for everyone. \"How did it pay off Poland and Yugoslavia for the compulsory loan it received and did not do it for Greece?\" Glezos asked.\n\n[08] KKE on German President's visit to Greece\n\nCommunist Party of Greece (KKE) on Thursday issued an announcement on the German President Joachim Gauck's visit to Greece saying that \"the German President's visits to martyrdome sites and the homage to the victims of the nazis atrocities cannot hide either the real aim of the visit to Greece, which is to support the antipopular policy and the promotion of the German monopolies' interests or Germany's stance on the German war reparations and the occupation loan.\"\n\nMoreover, KKE condemns the Greek government's decision to ban demonstrations in downtown Athens.\n\n[09] Emergency EU Summit on Ukraine is underway; Samaras, Yatseniuk\n\nBRUSSELS (ANA-MPA / M. Aroni)\n\nPrime Minister Antonis Samaras addressed the emergency summit of EU leaders held here on Thursday to discuss the issue of Ukraine. According to diplomatic sources, he underlined the need to avoid moves that could cause an armed conflict and called for substantive dialogue between all sides to ease tension in the region.\n\nHe also referred to the historic ties between Greece and Ukraine and to the Greek community in Mariupol.\n\nThe European leaders agreed on an 11-billion-euro economic aid package for Ukraine, while the country's interim Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk stated that he is ready to sign the EU-Ukraine association agreement as soon as possible.\n\nThe Ukrainian prime minister, who attended the summit's morning session at the invitation of the EU28, underlined in a press conference he gave afterward, that the decision by the Parliament of Crimea to secede and join Russia is \"unlawful\". He also called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and expressed the will to enter a constructive dialogue with the Russian side.\n\n[10] PM Samaras: Europe must prove its mediating role in Ukrainian crisis\n\nBRUSSELS (ANA-MPA/M. Aroni)\n\nPrime Minister Antonis Samaras on Thursday underlined the need for Europe to certify its meditating role in the Ukranian crisis.\n\n\"We have a crisis to deal with and Europe must prove its meditating role,\" Samaras said before entering the extraordinary EU Summit on Ukraine held in Brussels.\n\n[11] Venizelos reports 'cautious optimism' from Ukraine guarantor powers\n\nROME (ANA-MPA / Th. Andreadis)\n\nGovernment Vice-President and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos, chair of the EU foreign ministers' council, on Thursday said he was receiving \"messages of cautious optimism\" concerning developments in Ukraine from the foreign ministers representing the guarantor powers for the country, based on a 1994 memorandum.\n\nReplying to questions from the ANA-MPA in Rome, where he participated in an international ministerial conference on the future of Libya, Venizelos said that there had also been a lengthy discussion on the events in Ukraine.\n\n\"The ministers of the guarantor powers, with whom I met, conveyed to me a message that a contact process has begun that may lead to a result. If not to a defusion than at least to control over developments,\" he added.\n\nRegarding Libya, which was the main item on the agenda, the minister stressed that its future was important for all countries in the Mediterranean and surrounding regions.\n\n\"We have helped Libya with all the difficulties it is facing, which are unfortunately continuing. We want a stable situation, a democratic Libya, with a constitution and a country that is in control of its territory and not at risk of losing its territorial integrity. Our country's participation in this conference gives us an opportunity to have a more intensive and practical contact on a bilateral level as well. This is something that naturally interests us, because there is always the issue of maritime zones in the eastern Mediterranean and because there is always the possibility of a Greek business presence in the region,\" he said.\n\nOn the sidelines of the Rome conference, Venizelos had a brief meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu, which he said focused chiefly on events in Ukraine. He reported that Turkey was concerned about the Tatars, a Turkish ethnic group in Ukraine, in the same way that Greece had concerns for the Greek diaspora in the region.\n\nVenizelos also had bilateral meetings with his German, French and U.S. counterparts, noting the need to always make use of such meetings and to avoid an escalation of the crisis so that the decision of the Crimea Parliament might be more properly evaluated, in the context of international law and with the aim of preserving peace, stability and security in the region.\n\n[12] Venizelos meets with Turkish FM Davutoglu in Rome\n\nGovernment Vice-President and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos on Thursday met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on the sidelines of the International Ministerial Conference on support for Libya held in Rome.\n\nThe two officials exchanged views on the prevailing condition in Ukraine after Davutoglu's visit on Saturday, March 1 and Venizelos' visit to Ukraine on Sunday, March 2.\n\nThe conference focuses on the political reforms and Libya's gradual transition to democracy. The participants will have the opportunity to seek ways to support the country in the sectors of administration, rule of law, proliferation of conventional weapons and borders control.\n\n[13] Deputy FM Kourkoulas to meet with Greek businesses active in Ukraine\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Dimitris Kourkoulas will meet at the foreign ministry on Friday with representatives of Greek businesses active in Ukraine, to identify the problems they face as a result of the crisis and to find solutions.\n\nThe executives attending the meeting represent the sectors of business, export and transport. Also present will be representatives from the ministries of Infrastructure, Transport & Networks and Rural Development & Food.\n\n[14] Gov't and IMF in standoff over banks' capital needs\n\nThe meeting between the government's economic staff and the troika of Greece's international lenders was concluded at 2 a.m. after six hours of deliberations but without the two parties coming to an agreement on the capital needs of the country's banks and the time scale lenders will have to find the necessary funds.\n\n\"We want equal terms for Greek banks and other European lenders,\" a senior Finance ministry official said. He pointed out it was mainly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative that disagreed on the time for the conclusion of the recapitalisation, as he considers that only a few months (less than six) are needed for the process to be completed.\n\nAccording to the official, Greece has submitted a compromising proposal to the troika. That provides among others the announcement of the Bank of Greece's stress tests on Thursday, the assessment of the banks' capital needs and giving banks the possibility to proceed with a share capital increase. The proposal also provides that in case banks do not raise the necessary funds, they can take refuge to the Financial Stability Fund. According to the proposal, Greek banks should be given the same time scale as the European banks in order to complete their recapitalisation.\n\nThe text updating the memorandum also dominated the marathon meeting, which concluded that:\n\n- there is no final agreement yet on the 2014 fiscal gap, but the troika seems to have accepted \"to a great extend the fact that there is no fiscal gap in 2014. We are very much close to an agreement on that issue; much closer than any other issue,\" the senior official said. He also added that Greece claims \"there is no gap or there is a very small fiscal gap in 2015.\"\n\n- there are signs of convergence on the reforms included in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) toolbox\n\n- the Greek side aims to table the 2015-2018 mid-term plan to parliament by May 15.\n\nIn any case, the possibility for a \"technical agreement in principle\" by the Eurogroup meeting on Monday seems to be fading away, as it is considered \"very ambitious\" according to Finance ministry sources.\n\n[15] Government in marathon of talks with troika\n\nThe government has launched a marathon of talks with troika representatives since Thursday morning in an effort to have \"at least a statement of sufficient progress\" prepared by Monday's Eurogroup and thus secure approval for the next tranche of economic aid through a teleconference.\n\nDevelopment Minister Costis Hatzidakis opened the round of meetings, meeting with the troika in the morning to discuss the Organisation for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) toolkit for Greece. According to sources, the government has accepted 87 percent of the recommendations of the international organization. Nevertheless, there are still quite a few pending issues, such as troika's demands on tighter time frames over legislative amendments.\n\nThe troika also had meetings with Merchant Marine Minister Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, Environment Minister Yiannis Maniatis and Deputy Environment Minister Asimakis Papageorgiou, as well as the general secretary for public health Christina Papanikolaou.\n\nA senior environment ministry official said that the troika \"has still not responded on whether it accepts the package to lower energy costs for big industries, amounting to 150 million euros.\" On the other hand, the troika seems to be accepting the draft bills on the privatisation of the grid administrator Independent Power Transmission Operator (ADMIE) and the so-called \"mini Public Power Corporation (DEH)\".\n\nA merchant marine ministry official mentioned that all those issues were discussed with the troika but there was no agreement on any of them. The official added that the troika has been asking for the abolition of the mandatory crew composition in passenger shipping and mandatory connections, saying that \"we cannot separate routes to low and high cost ones.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the Financial Stability Fund and the Bank of Greece are expected to meet with troika at the Finance Ministry after 15.00. According to the schedule so far, troika representatives will meet with Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at 18.00 and Justice Minister Charalambos Athanassiou at 18.30. A meeting with Labour Minister Yiannis Vroutsis on the issue of mass layoffs is expected after 19.00.\n\n[16] Admin. Reform minister meeting with troika ends without agreement\n\nA meeting between Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the heads of the troika of Greece's lenders concluded at the Finance ministry on Thursday evening without a substantive agreement, either for the completion of the second wave of gradual civil servant layoffs for 2013, which had an extension to the end of March this year, or for 2014.\n\nA senior ministry official said that the ministry's leadership does not wish to set quantitative targets (on suspension) for 2014, stressing that \"we want mobility, but not layoffs. They (the troika) are hearing it, (but) they have not agreed on it\".\n\nA new meeting will be held between the Administrative Reform ministry and the troika in the near future.\n\nCurrently, Thursday evening, the troika representatives are meeting with Labour Minister Yiannis Vroutsis.\n\n[17] Labour Minister Vroutsis' meeting with the troika postponed to midday Friday\n\nLabour Minister Yiannis Vroutsis' meeting with the representatives of the troika was postponed for midday Friday at the ministry of Finance.\n\nVroutsis met with Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, at the Finance ministry, in a meeting that lasted until 10:30 p.m. According to Labour ministry sources, they examined the two issues under negotiation - mass layoffs in the public sector and the process of applying the reduction of the non-wage-related cost by 3.9 percentage points starting this coming summer.\n\nThe source expressed optimism that negotiations between the troika and Labour ministry will be concluded shortly and that they will reach agreement on outstanding issues.\n\n[18] Damanaki announces joint proposal for European Maritime Security Strategy; to host 'fishing capacity' conference in Thessaloniki\n\nBRUSSELS (ANA-MPA / M. Spinthourakis) -\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Maritime Affairs & Fisheries Maria Damanaki announced here on Thursday the adoption by the European Commission of a Joint Proposal for a European Maritime Security Strategy.\n\nDamanaki underlined that it is a very important step in the effort to \"ensure the security of our seas and oceans,\" noting that it is \"a prime objective of the EU\".\n\nShe said that the world has become complicated and threats like armed conflicts, terrorism, drug trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, piracy and international crime have to be addressed.\n\nReferring to the Lampedusa tragedy, she underlined that such incidents will have to be prevented.\n\nDamanaki said that the proposal is a first step toward a coordinated action by the EU, noting that discussion will focus on 23 actions aimed at boosting cooperation. She underlined that existing resources will be better utilized, while effective and reliable partnership relations will be promoted with the EU's neighbours, as well as, solidarity among member-states.\n\nMeanwhile, it was announced that Commissioner Damanaki will host an International Conference on Sustainable Fishing Capacity Management in Thessaloniki on March 13-14, organized under the auspices of the Greek EU Presidency.\n\nThe conference will be formally opened by government vice-president and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos on March 13.\n\nThe two-day conference will be addressed by Damanaki, Rural Development & Food Minister Athanasios Tsaftaris, British businessman Sir Richard Branson and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Goodwill Ambassador Pierre Yves Cousteau.\n\n[19] DIMAR's Kouvelis meets with Schulz, Swoboda in Brussels\n\nBRUSSELS (ANA-MPA/V.

I am very close to finalising a deal of cooperation with Lebanon.

As you can see, there a fiscal gap issue no longer exists and a number of issues that recently appeared as 'thorns' between the two sides have been closed. The country, as far as its own obligations are concerned, has implemented the interventions it should.
