        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nHere is an interesting article that was sent to me by a friend written by the infamous Taki concernig a few world issues but more importantly the compensation that he found to be a less than adequate amount given to The Royal Family of Greece.\n\nWhat happened to honesty?\n\nTaki\n\nNew York\n\nDecember 14, 2002\n\nMy friend Tom Fleming, editor-in-chief of Chronicles, and a polymath who doesn’t tolerate fools or knaves, recently wrote that when he’s described as a journalist, he takes it as an insult. ‘Journalists are to writers what kept women are to wives ...’ The American version of Paul Johnson went on to say that even the old standards of mercenary journalism have collapsed. ‘Most journalists no longer even pretend to follow the news. All that matters to them is their celebrity status on TV.’ Egotism, rudeness, ignorance and total dishonesty make for a depressing spectacle, and nothing depresses more than today’s television, on both sides of the ocean. Then there’s politics, as practiced by today’s politicians. ‘He never told the truth when a lie would serve,’ was the great Douglas MacArthur’s judgment on FDR, and the same can now be applied to virtually the entire world of politics and journalism. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair are, of course, the masters of the direct lie, able to look straight into the camera and tell incredible whoppers with a sincerity that would make Mother Teresa blush.\n\nWhat a depressing thought at Christmas-time. I don’t watch television except for sport and the golden oldies, but at times I happen to channel-surf and run across a comb-over clown like William Kristol —always extolling the fairness of shooting Palestinian stone-throwing teenagers with armour-piercing missiles — or a loud-mouth like Chris Matthews beating the war drum. Kristol wears make-up à la Mae West, but it does very little for him. My spies tell me he also suffers from terrible halitosis. Where do the networks find these low-lifes? Once upon a time I used to listen to the news and more or less believed the soothing voices of the speakers. No longer. Too many channels have diluted the talent, and now it’s almost freak time. A disgusting-looking man like Alan Dershowitz (O.J. Simpson’s mouthpiece and saviour) is on almost every night, discharging hot air, humbug and hyperbole, and no one as yet has taken out a fatwa against him and the clowns who invite him on the air. And speaking of the latter, I just read a marvellous book by Michael Beschloss called The Conquerors. The book is built almost entirely around the conversations of high-up American officials trying to decide what to do with Germany. Roosevelt’s close friend and secretary of the treasury Henry Morgenthau wanted revenge. He wished to see Germany, one of Europe’s greatest countries, stripped of its industries and turned into ‘something like the used-up areas of Nevada deserts where only ghost towns, rusting machinery and abandoned mines remain’. Morgenthau and his ilk were following Stalin’s demands for unconditional surrender, a catastrophic decision accepted by Churchill and Roosevelt, one that made Germans fight to the last. Millions died needlessly but, thank God, Morgenthau’s plans were not followed by Truman. When FDR warned Morgenthau that Europe might starve if it could no longer buy German-made farm machinery, Morgenthau responded, ‘So what?’.\n\nNice guy that Morgi sonofabitch. Almost as nice as the aforementioned Alan Dershowitz, whom the great Paul Gottfried writing in the American Conservative recently took to task: ‘Always around to enlighten us, Dershowitz explains in his autobiography Chutzpah that millions of Poles were selectively murdered but in no way should be viewed as victims of genocide.’ In other words, mostly Catholic Poles don’t have the same propagandistic value as, say, Jewish victims. And speaking of victims, is there a bigger one than King Constantine of Greece? Seventeen hypocritical lawyers posing as fair-minded people and judging King Constantine’s case against the kleptocratic Greek republic found for the King — there was no alternative, the Greek state having stolen his property — but ordered the kleptocracy to pay something less than ten cents on the dollar. If this European Court of Human Rights is an omen of things to come, I’m off to Baghdad. Eighteen thousand acres of valuable land bought by the King’s grandfather and great-grandfather with private funds, and unlawfully seized by the Greek government, are worth closer to £350 million than the lousy £9 million issued by the judges in Strasbourg. Let’s not kid ourselves.\n\nStrasbourg judges are not going to go against Greek socialists. Both are made of the same scum. The Greeks have been maligning the King non-stop since he was the first to rise up against the military dictatorship in 1967, an act for which he lost his throne. The Greek royal family will never be forgiven for having fought the communist guerrillas and having kept Greece on the side of the West. King Constantine was born in Greece, and is as Greek as any of those crooked dwarfs now running the place. It is an outrage and a warning to any of us who might trust European justice in future. To make matters worse, the King gave the money to a Greek charity, surely to be skimmed off by the Greeks.\n\nTo all of you Spectator readers, the happiest of Christmases, and a very lousy 25 December to the Greek crooks and to the Pontius Pilates of Strasbourg.\n\nLink: http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?ta...2-12-14&id=2618\n\nI disagree with Jacqueline. Greece can forbid Constantine and his family to enter Greece no matter what passport they have. They can do that if a court decides that Constantine's trip can start a social and/or political unrest. Many countries have the same law.\n\nI doubt whether Greece will go to court in order to stop him from entering the country, but governments will be watching how he and his family behave when they visit. Bear in mind that it is not just the current government which made problems for him. He was ousted from the country when the previous (conservative) government sent the air-force against him while he was cruising in the Aegean in 1993. That was the last time he was in Greece. What happened was that the then conservative government, which included some supporters of Constantine, among them the then prime minister who is a personal friend of his, made a deal with the ex king. The deal was that he would be very discreet during his visit, and certain limits were set. At the same time the same government had promised him the same settlement on the royal property that he had agreed with a previous government (back in the eighties-different government, different party). For more information about this deal you can see what he himself says on his site.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Constantine provoked several people in Greece, the then opposition decided to exploit that in order to cause an uproar, the deal about the property was naturally off, and he was ousted from the country. Contrary to what you hear, Constantine is hugely unpopular in Greece among the population. He is very clever to blame it all on the government, rather than the Greeks, but that's tactics. The truth is that very few people like him, and nobody has protested the government's treatment of him and his family. It would be fair to say that he is even despised by many Greeks, especially his mother.\n\nThe 1993 government held elections shortly afterwards, a new party came to power, and they confiscated Constantine's property, declared him a persona non grata (this is legal, other countries have the same law), and refused to renew his passport (again, they have the right to do so under the law; the same applies in many European countries).\n\nAs for the Olympics, a special deal was made between the IOC and the Greek government about Constantine attending them.\n\nThe above are 100% factually correct. I am not stating my opinion, just facts.\n\nSamantha\n\nI seriously doubt that The Royal Family of Greece is a group of brutes who will \"behave badly\" when they visit Greece. They are hardly an uncivilized family and I doubt that any member of the family is going to start a movement. Yes, Greece can forbid any member of the GRF entrance, but they would certainly have hell to pay for it when denying entrance to ANY individual with a European Union passport. Regardless of the facts that you state Samantha, it would be an issue to say the least (and King Constantine loves issues). Sure, Greece has their laws-all countries do (thanks for the clarification) .\n\nGreece is not stronger nor bigger than the EU, no matter what some people would like to think. I think that the Greek goverment has simply been showing their weakness and fear of King Constantine. The fact that such a major issue is always made out of his visits to Greece are a testament to the fact that of course he is hugely popular there and that there is much to be feared by him. Governments usually don't fear the entrance of individuals who are hopeless, weak, and who pose no threat. If any problems are caused by his visit ever I doubt that the GRF itself would be to blame. That blame would fall on the individuals who support the GRF and King Constantine. King Constantine cannot be said to be \"provoking\" anyone. People have a right to feel the way in which they choose. I thought that Greece was a republic, not a dictatorship? I guesst that this fact still remains to be determined. Perhaps Greece should take issue with their citizens who feel that King Constantine is their rightful sovereign-that is of course unless individuals in Greece are not allowed to show dislike to their current form of government or express any opposing opinions. King Constantine cannot control how individuals feel about him. He would be ridiculously stupid to say to people: Oh no! Don't support me. I was forced into exile, so please support your current form of goverment and political and social leaders regardless of how you really feel about things. Don't ever have your own opinion. It does sound stupid doesn't it?\n\nI do not think that \"provoking\" people in Greece as you put it Samantha is a negative thing at all where King Constantine is concerned. It think that its wonderful that his mere presence always sparks such debate. Really, what is there to fear if King Constantine and the GRF are so weakened and have absolutey no power or support in Greece? It must be lovely to have that kind of effect on people. The GRF may never return to Greece, but it is more than obvious that it will be a very long time before they are forgotten.....ever.\n\nI simply love all of these deals that have to be made...all the limits that have to be set. It seems to me that the Greek governement simply isn't very confident in its current state. If it were, then how could a deposed monarch, be such a threat...a monarch who had all of his property taken, a monarch who had to flee the country immediately, a monarch who had to petiton the courts to obtain the monetary value for his family's property and still did not receive anything close to adequate compensation (one would think that he was a weakend and pathetic man, no? ) etc? What could he possibly do to such a strong and effective goverment?\n\nI think that tha entire thing is laughable. I have never really had a great interest in the restoration of former monarchies (other than studying them in an historical and political context), but I have to agree with Sylvia. It would be far too lovely to see the monarchy restored to Greece. It would be very fitting IMO. In all honesty, if it were not still possible, then the GRF and King Constantine, wouldn't have to watch Greek officials run through so many hoops every single time they wanted to make a simple visit (Does anyone of these people know how pathetic they look? ). I bet the GRF just laughs their \"you know whats off\" when they think about it. It's really quite entertaining. It certainly amuses me.\n\nJacqueline,\n\nI have some serious ties with Greece, so I know a lot about the public opinion there. And I don't hate Constantine and his family. So, this, I hope, allows me to be objective in my assessment of the situation.\n\nFirst, the EU issue: you write that \"[Greece] would certainly have hell to pay for it when denying entrance to ANY individual with a European Union passport.\"\n\nYes, this will indeed be so if they just deny entrance to an EU citizen without reason. However, as I wrote before, there is a provision both in Greek law (shared by other countries as well) and in the EU regulations that allows ANY EU country to deny entrance to a citizen bearing an EU passport. That can happen if the said country can prove that the person in question can cause political and social unrest, as I wrote in my previous message. So, no hell there.\n\nActually, Greece and France dealt with such an issue when the extreme right-wing politician and racist Le Pen visited Greece in the mid-eighties. There were riots against him in Greece, and both countries collaborated in having him declared a persona non grata for that. So, there was no hell from France or the EU. Constantine's case was obviously different: It would have been a major issue for Greece if they had forbidden him entrance, or had said that they were thinking about forbidding him entrance.\n\nTrue, Constantine and his family cannot be accused of such behavior, and this is why Greece never forbade him to visit. Where is the instability and insecurity that you argue there? However, this can, and I am sure that it will change in the future, IF Constantine behaves differently. Remember that the recent decision of the Court of Human Rights allowed Greece special provisions for the smooth transition from monarchy to a republic. I presume that you have read it, including the legal stuff behind it, since you are interested in the former RF or Greece. The confiscation of the royal property was considered a lawful move PROVIDED that there would be some (token) compensation. And this is what he got. A token compensation because the property was actually worth much more.\n\nThe issue of provocation and the former RF's behavior: we are not talking here about brutes, no problem there. It would, however, be an issue if a private individual visited and raised a claim to the throne (something that people like Symeon have not done in their respective countries). It would also be a problem if Constantine, as he did in 1993, staged certain appearances in certain regions and made certain declarations disputing the legal standing of the current political system of the country. This cost him his property, but it also goes against the Constitution of Greece. I presume that you have read that as well, so I won't repeat the relevant articles. Don't forget that Greece is a state of law, and it is recognized as such by the entire international community.\n\nConstantine should also know that there are issues in Greece that are still very sensitive among the population, and these have to do with the behavior of his family in the past. True, he was young when he became king, true, one cannot blame him for the actions of people like Constantine I, or even his own mother Frederica, or the weakness of his otherwise popular father Paul I, but he should understand that most Greeks are still sensitive about certain things. I am sure you are familiar with these, including the illegal stripping of certain Greeks off their citizenship for their political beliefs at the instigation of the Palace. About sending Greeks to exile for their political beliefs, something that not even the USA did during its darkest hours of Macarthyism. Or the attempt against the life of the then elected prime-minister, instigated by Frederica's entourage in the 1950's which led to the downfall of the government and the said prime-minister's fleeing the country.\n\nConstantine, it is felt in Greece, never showed good-will towards the Greek people by stating that he recognizes the referendum of 1975. Many people in Greece resent the fact that while he says that he is a private citizen he still styles himself as \"king\" and his daughter-in-law as \"crown princess.\" Yes, I know all about protocoll and the such, but this is, believe me, the common sentiment in Greece, and he refuses to respect that. The same common sentiment also wants him to adopt a last name, as Symeon has done. He refuses.\n\nTo me at least it is obvious that we are dealing here with two entities, Greece on the one hand, the former RF on the other, which are on a separate wave-length and cannot come together. So, they are better off staying apart.\n\nAnd, Jacqueline, believe me: Constantine IS unpopular in Greece. Hugely unpopular. If people resented the way the government treated him (and this includes all governments, also these which have included his sympathizers) they would protest. They would demonstrate. The Greeks are notorious individualists who have no problem to demonstrate and raise hell if they disagree with something. They have been on the news worldwide about demonstrations that they organized on issues they felt close to their heart. And these issues did not always have to do with foreign relations but included government policy as well. I'm afraid that Constantine is not one of these issues. Yes, there are some very few supporters of his left. Less than ten per cent of the population. However, if he does not tune himself in to the popular sentiment he will continue to have problems with Greece. And this is a pity if he really feels Greek and wants to go back.\n\nSamantha\n\nOriginally posted by Samantha75@Feb 28th, 2003 - 11:37 am\n\nAnd, Jacqueline, believe me: Constantine IS unpopular in Greece.

And this is a pity if he really feels Greek and wants to go back.\n\nSamantha\n\nWell, then there shouldn't be an issue about King Constantine or any member of the GRF visiting Greece now should there Whether he refers to himself as King or Emperor shouldn't really matter, now should it Marie-Chantal should be allowed to refer to herself as the Queen of Whoopie if she likes and no one shoud really care about it, now should they Such and unpopular group really shouldn't warrant any reaction (if any very little) and for someone who is so unpopular his visits along with those of his family should really spark little to no debate, shouldn't it If anything it should cause normal curiosity (what they are doing, how everyone is looking these days, what they're wearing, etc., etc., etc......). For someone who is hugely unpopular the goverment shouldn't expect much from him, the GRF or the Greek citizens. If he is so unpopular, then who cares about him One would think that such unpopularity would most likely lead to King Constantine being ignored. How can someone who is so unpopular pose such a threat Who cares about such an unpopular individual One would think that the presence of King Constantine along with that of any member of the GRF would cause the Greeks to have these massive demonstrations that you mentioned the Greeks being so famous for, so where are they (Since everyone is so insulted) One would think that such unpopularity would render one completely powerless and that one's presence anywhere in the world (for the most part) would be no relevant than that of a wire corset.\n\nSo, in case you haven't noticed, I do not believe you and therefore, certainly will not take your word for it.\n\nThis had the potential to be an extremely interesting discussion, but now I see that you are simlpy arguing for the sake of argument. I see no constant coherence in your statements, only an attempt to be contrary and cause chaos and with this in my mind, I must say that I have grown extremely bored of this \"discussion.\""
