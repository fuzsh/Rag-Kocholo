The Fighting Scots won by set scores 25-12, 23-25, 25-16, 19-25 and 15-10.\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nSCORE: Suffolk 2, Gordon 3\n\nRECORDS: Suffolk (5-4) | Gordon (9-5)\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED\n\nGordon and Suffolk had a see-saw affair present through the first four frames. The Fighting Scots got on the scoreboard first and the Rams responded in the second with mirror results present through the third and fourth stanza to force the fifth and deciding set. Thanks to an early start, Gordon grabbed the final set, 15-10, to seal up the match.\n\nSET ONE RECAP (25-12, GORDON)\n\nGordon jumped out to a 9-0 lead.\n\nSuffolk could not build momentum out of a timeout as the Fighting Scot's lead stretched to 16-5 at the midway point.\n\nThe Rams did not dig themselves out of the hole as the hosts outscored the visitors, 9-7 down the stretch to lock up the frame, 25-12.\n\nSET TWO RECAP (25-23, SUFFOLK)\n\nTwo Kayla Barbera kills sandwiched an attack error by Gordon's Mackenzie Hinds to put Suffolk up early 3-1.\n\nAfter the playing field leveled at 4-all, Hannah Fabiano sparked a 4-0 run by the visitors to give the Rams a 9-5 cushion.\n\nThe Fighting Scots inched back into the set and equalized things once again at 10-10.\n\nThe score locked four more times before the tides turned in Gordon's favor, 18-17.\n\nSuffolk found itself in a two-point hole after the Fighting Scots rattled off five unanswered points.\n\nThe Rams rallied and tied the frame at 21 and against at 23 before regaining the edge, 24-23 on an ace by Dakhensey Marcellus.\n\nOn the next play, Bridget Allison and Barbera combined for a block to put the set away in Suffolk's favor, 25-23.\n\nSET THREE RECAP (25-16, GORDON)\n\nA tightly contested frame was present with neither team making a stand until Suffolk gained a two-point lead thanks to a kill by Marcellus.\n\nThe edge was shortlived, however, as the Fighting Scots responded, outscoring the Rams 5-3, to jump in front, 12-10.\n\nAfter Chidera Nwankwo slammed down a kill, Gordon strung together nine consecutive points to put a 21-11 distance between it and Suffolk.\n\nSuffolk did not gain momentum as Gordon locked up the set, 25-16, on an Amanda Snyder kill.\n\nSET FOUR RECAP (25-19, SUFFOLK)\n\nThe Rams had to play catch up again and did so, tying the stanza at 5-5, before gaining their first lead of the frame, 6-5, on a Fighting Scots mistake.\n\nThe lead would change twice more before Suffolk grabbed an 11-7 advantage.\n\nThe blue and gold remained in front at the midway point 17-12.\n\nSuffolk maintained its advantage down the stretch to claim the set, 25-19.\n\nSET FIVE RECAP (15-10, GORDON)\n\nGordon put up the first five points.\n\nSuffolk clawed back and made it a 7-5 set.\n\nAfter switching sides of the net, the Fighting Scots pushed their advantage to 11-5.\n\nTwo kills by Barbera kept Suffolk alive and chipped away at Gordon's lead, 12-8.\n\nFabiano and Nwankwo each recorded kills to keep the Rams alive when the Fighting Scots had match point, 14-0.\n\nA service error by Allison ended Suffolk's hopes and gave Gordon the set, 15-10, and match.\n\nSTATISTCALLY SPEAKING\n\nFabiano's 17 kills led Suffolk's 51 kill attack, which saw Talia Lombardo, Nwankwo and Barbera all record nine kills apiece.\n\nDefenisvely, Marcellus, Lombardo and Liz Kerek all produced double figure digs. Marcellus led the way with 15 with Lombardo and Kerek adding 12 and 11, respectively.\n\nKerek set up Suffolk's offense with 34 handouts.\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\nSuffolk and Gordon went to five sets for the first time since 2012 and second time in the all-time series.\n\nKerek contributed her first double-double of the year and seventh of her career with a 34-assist, 11-dig performance.\n\nKerek's 34 handouts mark a season and career-best for the senior co-captain.\n\nPOST-MATCH PIC\n\nCOMING UP\n\nAfter a day of rest, Suffolk hits the road to visit Gordon Thursday, Sept. 21. First serve in Wenham, Massachusetts, is set for 7 p.m."
