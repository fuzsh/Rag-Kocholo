        "text": "Curious about the process of applying for ibogaine treatment? Want to know more about the screening process? In this episode of Ibogaine Uncovered, Amanda S. is joined by two previous guests, Beond co-founder Talia Eisenberg, MBA and VP of clinical operations, Vianey ‚ÄúNurse V‚Äù Perez, for a deep dive on Beond‚Äôs intake process, including details on medical screening, personalized care, and potential challenges or red flags. Deciding to pursue treatment with a psychedelic drug as powerful and potent as ibogaine can come with a hefty side of anxiety. The goal in creating this episode was to provide listeners with a resource that might help quell some of that stress. #IbogaineTreatment #HealingJourney #PsychedelicTherapy #BeondIbogaine #IbogaineTherapy #PsychedelicTherapy\n\nThe path is made by the very act of walking it. Psychedelic journeys are a process. It‚Äôs a misconception that we can have one psychedelic journey and be completely healed, contrary to what popular media like How to Change Your Mind seem to assert. Being open to the process rather than the destination, and curious about where psychedelic therapy will take you is a helpful attitude to have when embarking on the journey.

In group therapy, we face all kinds of emotions and it‚Äôs important to be open to that when you start your journey. The group analyst will always talk through the possible emotions you may encounter before you join a group and support you in dealing with them. Our network of experienced group analysts is available to talk through the sort of difficulties that group therapy can help with. You can DM us on LinkedIn or get in touch through our website. #TherapyGroupsOnline #therapy #MentalHealth #GroupTherapy #MentalHealthAwareness\n\nHi Friends üôãüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è Do you think the psychedelic renaissance comes with risks or side effects? Shannon Duncan, author of Coming Full Circle, says yes. As someone who has experienced treatment-resistant trauma, Shannon offers so many insights into how psychedelic medicines can be the breakthrough treatment option when all else is failing, however, only when administered in the ways he believes are most effective. In this episode, Shannon tells us a bit about his background and how he came to write his book. We discuss the environment and assistance it takes to get the most out of psychedelic medicines, the issue of true, deep healing compared to instant gratification, the shamanic approach to using medicines, and so much more. Do you agree that the risks may outweigh the benefits when trying psychedelic medicines without proper professional assistance? Please share your thoughts! Until next time, Much ‚ù§Ô∏è #PsychedelicConversations #ShannonDuncan #PsychedelicPodcast #Microdosing #PsychedelicScience #PlantMedicines #PsychedelicResearch #Entheogens #PsychedelicMedicines #TraumaHealing\n\nHowever much I wish I could help each one of you and provide the individual support you need, I can‚Äôt! That is why I have created resources and tools like the Pathological Lover Checklist to help empower you to make the right choices and the next move for YOU! I designed this checklist to help others recognize unhealthy behaviors in their partners. By highlighting key indicators like the ones above (and more), this checklist is a guide for self-awareness and education. However, the checklist is just a starting point. Your situation is unique and may be complex. Empowerment comes not just from identifying problems but also from actively seeking knowledge and support. If you want to learn more or assess your situation, visit my profile and website to take this assessment! If you want to empower someone you love on their journey toward healing and autonomy - send this post their way. #pathological #pathologicallover #traumabond #narcissisticabuse"
