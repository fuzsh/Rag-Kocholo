        "text": "“2short,\" the lead single from James Lockhart Jr.’s upcoming debut EP, poignantly and cleverly tackles the cruel beauty of memory and the uniquely sublime nature of time spent with those you love. The song follows a back and forth in the narrator’s mind, between moments of warmth, brought on by images of the past, and cold realizations that those images cannot compare to the true moments of connection that they shadow. This contrast is expertly accentuated by the arrangement and production choices. In the sections of memory, the sound is full, the drums are center stage, and it feels like James is singing right next to you. When the feelings of isolation and longing take over, the drums cut and his voice takes on the distant quality of a radio or telephone. The lyrics are straightforward yet lush with emotional potency. The second verse description of a Polaroid photo being taken, and subsequently looked to, “when I need to see somebody glowing,” struck me with a sharp bolt of nostalgia because of its accuracy and truth. In this particular moment, as we move into the summer and the world hopefully begins to open up safely, “2short” is able to delicately both lament the love and connection which was lost over the past year and implore the listener to cherish the moments that will come. Photo by Sara Laufer.\n\n— Emerson Obus on April 28, 2021\n\nEach day this week, Nashville-based folk singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Lydia Luce offers insight on tracks from her sophomore album, Dark River. Follow along as she intimately details her songwriting process in her own words. Photo by Betsy Phillips.\n\nJordan Lehning and I wrote \"Occasionally\" in the fall of 2019. He sent me the melody in a voice memo while I was on tour in California and I began jotting down some lyrics. Initially, the song was written about a reoccurring memory of someone. It lingers, you try and cast it away but it is resilient.\n\nAfter the tornado hit Nashville in March 2020 this song took on a completely different meaning. I realized that this song was about anxiety. I was having a really difficult time the few weeks after the tornado with panic attacks and severe anxiety. We recorded this song at Southern Ground in Nashville. — Lydia Luce\n\n— on April 27, 2021\n\nSunny chords strum in to transport you to a beach somewhere with great friends and cool drinks onSea Glass’ newest single “Lemon Lime Watermelon.”\n\nSea Glass is the brand new project from Brooklyn-based multi-instrumentalist and producer Jake Muskat. Through Sea Glass, he aims to create an exciting, collaborative project as each song features a different co-writer vocalist. For “Lemon Lime Watermelon,” Muskat enlists the help of Chicago native Sky Adler.\n\nWhimsical lyrics let us know that “Lemon Lime Watermelon” is “fresher than toothpaste.” The song builds as arpeggiated keys and a buoyant beat surface, inviting us to get out of our heads and be more present as Adler sings, “They’re stuck in last year / I’m flying through this week.”\n\nWith the vaccine rolling out, the weather getting nicer every day, and the possibility of experiencing live music again, it certainly feels like we’re in the home stretch of a forgettable year. Although we must keep taking care of ourselves and others, these uplifting times tell us that despite what’s happened, there’s still joy to be found.\n\nAs the song closes and filtered keys play the last chords, you can’t help but feel compelled by their proposition: “I’m starting over baby / You should come along with me / Let’s go on a spaceship / Let’s go on a journey.” How could you say no to that? Photo provided by Sea Glass.\n\n— James Ramos on April 27, 2021\n\nThis week, Oxford-based quartet Low Island is taking over Buzzing Daily to walk us through select tracks from their debut album, If You Could Have It All Again. Follow along as they delve into the modern synth rock-tinged record, which they've deemed \"a love letter to a wasted 20s.\" Photo by Evelin van Rei.\n\nMomentary is a song about unrequited love. It’s about wishing that the strength of feeling that someone instilled in you is something that you could give to them, and how so often love’s trajectory can travel along steep inclines only to be met with abrupt cliff edges. But what the song is trying to say is that in spite of all that, it’s always worth being honest about how you feel, no matter the outcome, because only then can you find the strength to move on. It’s a cliche but it’s true. — Low Island\n\n— on April 23, 2021\n\nInstantly infectious and only more memorable with every listen, Wilby’s latest single proves once again how powerful of a songwriter and artist she can be, and already is. The band feels so welcoming and homey, a fuzzy riff tying a bow on it all. So when Wilby delivers a devastating lyric to open, it caught me off guard: “I can still hear your voice in the kitchen.\" The more I consider this lyric, the more beautiful it becomes. Some of my fondest memories live in the kitchens of my life. Family often finds itself there, a place to care for one another. The lyric and band transport me back to those places, and I can hear my grandma talking about her day, my aunt walking me through a recipe. It warms my heart. There’s more happening around us, but Wilby winks as she asks, “Honey, what’s the rush?\" It’s moments like these that keep me in awe of Wilby’s music: tremendously human and vulnerable insights, from a voice like none other, sitting atop a loose and wonderful band. Shortly after the singalong-worthy chorus, we get another example of her magic. I’ve been haunted by this stunning thought: “Every memory has its limit / Good but never enough.” Even amidst Wilby painting these verses with specific and stunning imagery, it’s a reminder to be grateful for, and present in, each moment that comes our way. It’s easy to do that during this song, so lovely at every turn. The bridge offers another wonderful moment, a reminder that we can always carry our loved ones with us and hold those relationships close. The rest of the song has me singing and crying along, my heart filled to the brim with warmth and with love.

A part of yourself that you become attached to and, for fear of change, you don’t want to let it go. It’s about taking that part of yourself, or that feeling, for one last dance before finally saying goodbye. In an interview the other day, the interviewer likened it to the last cigarette. I thought that was a neat way of summing it up. — Low Island\n\n— on April 22, 2021\n\nThe other night, I was sitting on a patio in East Austin chatting with friends. With vaccines rolling out and folks excited to start stretching their limbs, maybe it was talk of travel that sparked this query to the group:\n\nFriend: “You know when you’re first dating someone, or the relationship’s young...and you kind of ask yourself, are we cool? We’re cool right? Like when one of you is out of town, or you haven’t seen them in a bit? But then when the relationship’s more mature, you don’t think twice about it even when you’re apart.” She added with a smile: “It’s just—yeah, we’re cool. You know.”\n\nAs it should be.\n\nRuth B.’s latest single, \"Situation,\" brings to mind that overthinking, feel-your-cell-phone-vibrating-even-though-it's-off sense of uncertainty that can get muddled in with early relationships, or those lacking transparency and honest communication, especially around commitment.\n\nDespite her description of this uncertainty, Ruth B.’s lyrics spotlight self-awareness, and her silkily straightforward melody lets the song’s meaning ring clear—like the kind of communication everyone deserves to have (and give) in their relationships: \"If you love me let me know or let me go / Let me know or let me go.\" Photo by Gabriel LN.\n\n— Talia Pinzari on April 22, 2021\n\nThis week, Oxford-based quartet Low Island is taking over Buzzing Daily to walk us through select tracks from their debut album, If You Could Have It All Again.

This song toys with the idea of leaving life’s false presentations behind for good. Easier said than done! — Low Island\n\n— on April 21, 2021\n\nSeattle indie outfit Kuinka experiments with pop convention for an anthemic new single \"All Mine,\" the second offering from their upcoming record Shiny Little Corners, due out April 30. Banjo strums, a folk-style stomping beat and raw chants balance more modern glittering synths for a uniquely liberating sound that stays close to home. Energy courses through each element of the song like adrenaline in your veins; you're restless for fulfillment, following their own search for cathartic joy: \"Can't sit still but you never try...I want to make it all mine.\" With \"All Mine\" and lead single \"Living Room Floor\" showcasing a deeper foray into the pop world, it's clear that Kuinka is taking a turn to uncover Shiny Little Corners indeed.

The first track I’ve chosen is \"What Do You Stand For.\"\n\n\"Who are you, and what do you stand for?\" is something an A&R person said to us in a meeting once. It was one of those frustrating meetings which every artist will have had where the person clearly had no interest in the band, perhaps not even in music; it feels like they’re just in the industry to socialise, name-drop and be on the guest-list. This song was written as a fuck you to all of them. — Low Island\n\n— on April 20, 2021\n\nVeronica Isley’s project Snowhore has just released their debut EP, Everything Tastes Bad. Each song is as experimental as it is personal, bearing different influences from punk to indie folk. “Sad Song” is beautiful, authentic and memorable, a great example of how intimate each song written by Isley truly is. With an unhurried tempo and fading chords, the song immediately evokes a somber sensation.\n\nThe lyrics touch on the relationships—both with others and herself—that Isley lost through the years she struggled with addiction. The song opens with the lines “I’m sorry for the things I’ve done / I didn’t mean to hurt no one.” While warmly specific, it artfully sings to the universal. The lyrics relate to anyone impossibly trying to cope with life without losing balance, attempting to keep that internal struggle from seeping out. As the song reflects on how “nothing’s changed” and “nothing feels right,” Isley leaves us connected through that feeling of self-doubt and confusion.
