It was clear right away that they were similar in all the important ways, had fun together, laughed all the time and had a chemistry that has just grown and grown.\n\nThe couple went on the March Jewish Federation trip to Israel. It was their first time away together, and they were without kids and animals and had so much fun seeing Israel. It was Allison’s first time in Israel.

Her daughters, Janis, Shoshana, Shemaya and Karen, joined her for brunch in her well-ventilated “salon,” which she created in her garage to permit her to host family during COVID restrictions.\n\n“It’s only a number,” says Gerel of turning 90.\n\nGerel is an avid gardener and played tennis from her teens until she broke her ankle about two years ago. Though she says her ankle is fine now, she has not returned to the courts since the Irvington Tennis Club she belongs to has been closed during the pandemic; and she admits she would need to be sure her balance is still up for the quick turns of tennis.\n\nShe still lives in her home of 58 years, which she shared with her husband, Henry, until his death in 2012. She still cares for the garden at Cedar Sinai Park that bears his name. For about 15 years, she cared for Robison Home’s eight gardens, until they were removed during construction of CSP’s four new households.\n\nGerel attributes her longevity to being active and getting out in nature. “I’ve been a gardener for many, many years. I do hard gardening – I dig.”\n\nShe attended B’nai B’rith Camp as a child. For most of her life, she has been active at Congregation Beth Israel, including taking an active role in the Temple Sisterhood. She has also been active at the Mittleman Jewish Community Center and Portland Jewish Academy. She served a term on the Robison board. She also volunteers in the archives for the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education (before COVID closed the building for much of the last year). She also spent 40 years as a tour guide for the Urban Tour Group, whic provides tours for schools designed to share the history, culture, architecture, and resources of Portland,\n\n“I am a relic of Portland,” says Gerel. Yom Huledet Sameach, Gerel, until 120!\n\n50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nDonna and Charles Kuttner\n\nPHOTO: Donna and Charles Kuttner just outside Jerusalem’s Jaffa Gate during a 2018 visit to Israel. Photo courtesy of the Kuttner Family.\n\nOn Donna and Charles Kuttner's first date, she wasn’t impressed.\n\nThat may have had something to do with her migraine, but a second date two weeks later made all the difference. “We talked and talked,” Donna recalls, and the two Texas natives discovered similar tastes in movies and books – both even had a copy of Winnie Ille Pu, the Latin translation of A.A. Milne’s children’s classic.\n\nA little over a year later, on Jan. 22, 1971, they married near Galveston, Texas, during a short break in Charles’ medical school schedule. In the five decades since, they’ve had three additional weddings (Reform, Conservative and Orthodox) as Donna completed her conversion to Judaism, and as the couple grew increasingly more observant.\n\nTheir religious journeys paralleled their geographic wanderings. They lived in San Francisco while Charles completed his residency in psychiatry, and there joined a Conservative synagogue. In 1976, when they moved to rural Linn County in Oregon, they joined Beit Am, the Mid-Willamette Jewish Community in Corvallis. And then in 1985, they joined Congregation Kesser Israel, though they didn’t move to Portland until 2001.\n\nCharles, a psychiatrist for some 45 years, now works at Fanno Creek Clinic. Donna, who was a music teacher when they met, earned two additional master’s degrees and a Ph.D. in public health from Oregon State University.\n\nFor both of them, their journey together has deepened their appreciation of the concept of bashert, or “soulmate.” They appreciate each other for their commonalities and their differences, for the journeys they’ve shared together, and the paths they have yet to explore.\n\n“Fifty years is a long time,” Donna reflects. “The only way you can make that work is to accept and respect the person for who they are, and who they will be as they change over time.”\n\nBoth Donna and Charles were married, briefly, to others before they met. “You don’t always pick the right answer the first time,” Donna says with a smile.\n\nTheir family includes daughter, Arwen, a Jewish day school teacher: her husband, Uri Ruttenberg; and granddaughter, Naomi, 14, in Englewood, N.J. Charles’ son, Jason, a clinical supervisor for a firm providing mental health services to adolescent dependents of military families, and his wife, Carrie, live in Honolulu, and Jason’s daughter, Io, 27, is working at a winery in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n~Story by Sura Rubenstein\n\nBirths\n\nADAR SIMA ALPERT\n\nAdar Sima Alpert was born Oct. 31 to Elana and Zev Alpert, joining big brother Lavi.
