        "text": "4.1.1 Internalized Ableism: Accepting Our Own Disability. Perhaps the most insidious form of ableism is the internalized notion that impairment is inherently negative. At its extreme, it can lead to erasure of the disability experience, or even internalized self-hatred [15]. The arrival of a disability identity is often separate from onset of impairment. Sometimes we arrive at this identity by being recognized as disabled by bystanders. Mankoff describes, “I was both shocked and upset the first time I was labeled as ‘disabled’ by a stranger who opened a door for me. The automatic door opener was broken and the stranger noted how important it was that these accessibility barriers be fixed for people like me. By using the button, I had labeled myself disabled.” Now, as a mother, she works to “inoculate her daughter against doubters,” a common negative experience shared by many with chronic illness, by encouraging her daughter to develop a disability identity early in her chronic illness experience. Kasnitz additionally skirted the issue of internalized ableism, “I talk about not really coming out as disabled until acquainted with Irv [Irving] Zola as a mentor at age 30. My sister remarked ‘The only person who ever thought you were in a closet was you.’ ”\n\nAnother expression of internalized ableism is the idea that disability has to cross some threshold of difficulty or suffering to count. After arriving at a bar, Hofmann and Bennett took advantage of the casual environment to speak honestly about their shared experiences with disability. Hofmann recalls, “I did not identify as disabled at the time and was uncomfortable claiming the moniker because I felt ‘too able.’ Bennett responded, ‘you're F***ing Disabled!’ At the time it was relieving to have Bennett validate my experience as an authority on disability because she was blind. I now recognize the ableism innate in that line of thinking; I'm disabled whether or not others recognize it. The final authority on my identity is myself.” Both Hofmann and Mankoff have questioned whether they are “too able” to count. Yet a disability identity can help tremendously by giving language to negotiate negatives and assert rights to access, by recognizing the positives the unique perspective offers, by providing community, by legitimizing the use of accessible technologies, and on and on.\n\n4.1.3 Representation: Expecting Disability in Academia. Another form of ableism that impacts the creation of AT is the assumption that disability is a characteristic of the studied subject. Although disabled academics are increasing in number, and though ASSETS has led the way in cultivating an accessible conference, academia still remains quite inaccessible, and representation of disabled academics decreases with successive ivory tower promotions [17]. For example, though ASSETS is known for long hosting entirely remote peer review, it is a relatively new transition for many ACM conferences. Mankoff recalls: “I have been asking permission to participate remotely at professional events for years. Only as program committee meetings grew too large, and then again when social distancing became necessary during the COVID-19 Pandemic, was this practice broadly adopted, allowing me to finally feel like I could participate as an equal.” Too often, disabled people not expected to occupy positions other than student or research participant, are told that resources are too scarce, or that their individual accommodation might disrupt the needs of the whole. Kasnitz contradicts this with experience organizing SDS and other disability studies events long run by and for disabled scholars. “It is no surprise to me that in March 2020, SDS was able to move a 400 person, 40 session meeting online in just three, exhausting weeks while other conferences were cancelling all around us. We predict that like voice recognition software, our protocols for online access will be widely adopted for everyone.” While others have argued for the importance of improving accessibility at all levels of academia [88], accessible systems and processes currently in place are not yet sufficient. The cultural change must run deeper for such systems and processes to stay centered, , and when it does we will benefit with a resilience that improves access not only for those with disability, but also the temporary impairments caused by everything from personal injury to the worldwide changes caused by COVID-19.\n\nDisability culture means not only prioritizing access earlier and more consistently, but also adopting important lessons that go beyond traditional notions of accessibility. These include the values of slowing down despite the constant pressure to do more in academia; balancing personal care with work; time management skills; collaboration skills; resilience; multi-modal communication; and problem solving. Perhaps the most misunderstood among these is time. A disabled person often moves at a different speed (e.g., crip time [39]). Whether working with a disabled colleague or planning a user study with disabled participants, success often demands a willingness to, as Mankoff says, “slow down and focus on quality over quantity.” On the other hand, we note that the right technology can save time. Time is a space where understanding and accessibility play important roles in providing choices rather than making assumptions. Our review of ableism demonstrates the power and necessity of addressing our biases and misconceptions, and the necessity that this take place both in our personal relationships as well as at the structural levels that dictate the far-in-advance planning of conferences and what qualifies one for tenure.\n\n4.1.4 Segregating Accommodation from Public Space. Processes to accommodate access needs are often separated from their contexts. Bennett reflected on the discontinuity of official accommodations and reality, “I have never been fully supported in a workplace and I constantly navigate the processes of getting workplace accommodations (whether through official channels or not), as a student, as an instructor, and as a researcher. Yet, this labor remains invisible unless I explicitly call it out to colleagues. Even the most accommodating workplace does not eliminate the need for my colleagues to intentionally work in ways that I can access and the need for us to negotiate which practices will work best for everyone. In fact, the official character of workplace accommodations has at times led me to ignore others’ needs when they don't fit within those structures since mine are presumed legitimate.” We do not condone nonconsensual disability disclosure, but keeping accommodation separate from other activities creates artificial barriers to including all stakeholders and belies the fact that most accommodations are incompatible with confidentiality. Instead, accommodations are often public and interactional in nature. Kasnitz shared an example of what publicly democratizing access accommodations might look like. “One year, just to make the point, a group of my able bodied colleagues all filled in the anthropology conference accommodation request box with ‘I will need a revoicer when I meet with Devva.’ We modeled how such a brazen culture change allows nondisabled allies to take on some of the responsibility and work involved in creating accommodating group public spaces.” We recognize that negotiating accommodations publicly often has dire consequences for individuals. But culture change must start with risk. Shared risk will better reflect the interactional nature of all access needs, not just disability, and better serve those whose accommodations are resisted. Nondisabled people and the “out” disabled people like Bennett and Kasnitz who have the privilege of sanctioned disability, have the moral imperative to use their platform to advocate for others’ (such as Mankoff and Hofmann's) accommodations—their civil rights.\n\n4.2.1 Managing Visibility. Many accessibility researchers are familiar with the term invisible disability to describe the wide range of impairments that are structurally suppressed or not obviously expressed externally. What is less discussed is how living on a spectrum from total invisibility (i.e.passing) to overt exposure affects how disabled people find their way to a disabled identity and the technologies designed to support them.\n\nWhen Hofmann declares her disability to justify what she needs, she is often denied since her disability is usually invisible. For example, the lack of a formal diagnosis led her to be discriminated against when requesting rightful accommodations. As a result, she often goes outside the systems designed to support disabled people to get what she needs. For example, “as an undergraduate, my university would not accept my doctor's loose diagnosis of ‘Orthostatic Syncope Disorder’ (i.e. fainting while standing disorder) as a reason to provide an accessible (air-conditioned) dorm room, even though heat significantly increases the frequency of my syncope episodes. Dorms were primarily assigned by major and Computer Science majors lived in the older Natural Sciences dorm. Computer Engineering students, alternatively, lived in the brand new and accessible Engineering Dorms. Without proof of sufficient need, I went outside the resources set for disabled students, and changed my major, temporarily, to access the accessible living space.” Despite fought-after and clear requirements that universities offer accessible housing as a reasonable accommodation, the invisibility or imperceptibility of Hofmann's disability provoked institutional ableism and forced her to solve access barriers for herself.\n\nAs researchers have noted [22], people with invisible disability and chronic illness may aim to prevent such discrimination by using assistive technologies. But as Mankoff transitioned to not only negotiating her own disability but also to beginning this journey supporting her daughter, taking up assistive technologies became about more than legitimizing asks for help [9, 56]. “I've worked hard to instill a disability-positive identity in my daughter. I got her a custom-made, beautiful, engraved cane in her favorite colors (Figure 1), which has garnered many enthusiastic questions about whether we made it and lots of praise. This cane is a success in my eyes: rather than people looking away/ignoring/ being afraid to say anything, they engage with her.” Canes present an opportunity to make the invisible visible for many with chronic illness, an opportunity to declare, to accept, and to support rather than to fix [56].\n\nLike Mankoff's daughter, Hofmann has begun to make her disability visible by using a mobility-cane. Sometimes the cane is necessary to help her balance or to be turned into a one-legged stool, but often it is a tool to tell others when she is fatigued and needs to walk slowly or rest. But making her disability visible can sometimes create new barriers. For example, many public busses lower a ramp for people who the driver thinks cannot manage a step. Often, the bus emits a loud high-pitched alert sound. This can make Hofmann faint, so “when I approach the bus I have to do this awkward dance of hiding my cane from the approaching bus driver who may kindly assume I can't take the step, but also clearly reveal it to other passengers who may need to give me an accessible seat.” In these moments, Hofmann must make her disability both visible and invisible, perceived and ignored.\n\nWhen a disability is not invisible or hideable, it complicates disabled peoples’ power to negotiate how others accommodate them. For example, Bennett's status as a blind accessibility researcher cannot be overlooked, sometimes to her detriment: “I avoid demos and posters at many conferences as I'm often drawn in, whether I'm interested or not, to exhibits that people think may interest me because they are ATs for blind people. Sometimes, I'm asked to share my opinion only to be told that I'm wrong or that I used the demo incorrectly. I know folks are well-intentioned; I understand how rare it is to happen upon someone, outside user studies, whom our technology is meant to benefit. But I don't wish to be a spectacle, and so I avoid these events, often costing myself opportunities to see interesting research.” Kasnitz offers another example, “because my impairments are visible, I constantly dodge proffered but unneeded accommodations and may never get a chance to ask for what I do need/ want from people who feel rebuffed. A waitress will bring me a paper cup of water that I can neither move nor pick up without crushing. She says, ‘now you don't need to worry about breaking a glass.’ I say ‘Thank You’ as I crush the cup with gusto. When offered a half a cup of coffee at a time to avoid spillage, I say ‘thanks, make that the top half.’ I can drink the top half without picking it up.” Because their impairments are not invisible, Kasnitz and Bennett may instead variously perform disability to get what they need or segregate themselves from environments where the perception of that disability is a hindrance.\n\n4.2.3 Different disability: Same Space, Same Time. We tend to study disability specific to individuals, ensuring their access to a specific technology or space, even for a specific time or task. But we rarely consider how disabled people co-exist. The increasing inclusion of people with disability also increases the likelihood people with a variety of access strategies will share the same space, time, or technology. Sometimes, co-existence creates radical moments of mutual caring by disabled people, even though they are usually portrayed as recipients of assistance [8], which has informed the independent living movement [85]. Recall Hofmann and Bennett's evening at the bar, to which they had walked to with a group of disabled students following a conference reception. Hofmann describes the journey, “Sirens from police cars and the occasional smell of cigarettes and marijuana kept making me faint. We realized that we could accommodate each other's needs. Bennett and another blind student took my arms on either side. I guided them along the streets and they could catch me whenever I went limp.” They still use this technique to navigate together.\n\nHowever, co-existence, perhaps naturally, produces conflicts. Recall that Hofmann hides her mobility cane from bus drivers to prevent them from triggering a ramp and alarm. Bennett, who navigates with a white-cane, cannot hide her cane given its utility. She is similarly recognized as disabled by bus drivers, who trigger the ramp for her. Bennett describes the conclusion of an evening as she and Hofmann exited a variety show of disabled comedians to a nearby bus stop, where they would separate for Bennett to catch a ride home, “since I would board the bus alone, I did not feel comfortable hiding my cane. Hofmann saw my bus pull up before we reached the stop and did not want me to miss it. We could move faster together, with Hofmann as my guide, but we both knew that if the beeping sound began Hofmann might faint. As expected, when the driver noticed my cane, they lowered the bus. Hofmann separated quickly to safely faint on a bench and I rushed to catch the bus. It was a brief and discomforting goodbye.” In one task Hofmann and Bennett's bodies may present opportunities for working together in both concert and conflict. In this case, since Bennett does not need the floor of buses lowered, she will hide her white-cane and walk behind Hofmann if they board together; Hofmann can guide Bennett and the alarm is less likely to blare.\n\nExperiencing and working through these conflicts is legendary. However, negotiating disability is common in disability studies spaces where disabled people are more represented and explicitly included. Kasnitz describes herself “presenting at SDS via Zoom in a meeting of about 30 people. A Deaf woman in the audience wanted everyone to turn off their cameras because of the visual distraction she experiences while watching her ASL interpreters. I had to deny her request because I depend on eye contact with my revoicer and the postural and facial expressions of my audience for feedback as to whether I'm understood…The Deaf woman thanked me for explaining that she was not alone in her reliance on visual communication even if the mode caused conflicts.” Disability studies and activist communities have developed a variety of techniques for managing these frictions from which accessibility researchers can learn.\n\nAccess is not singularly good or bad, and everyone's access needs vary, complement, and conflict. Technology is not flexible enough to make space for these conflicts; nor does it facilitate the art of thoughtful compromise in access work.\n\n4.3.1 Making Shared Meaning. While research recognizes the role of professionals and volunteers in the ecosystem of AT [55, 70], our experiences demonstrate the role AT plays in making shared meaning with those close to us. Hofmann tells us making can be, “a moment where a husband declares his role of a caregiver and a person who respects and loves a disabled person. Although my research focuses on the intersection of making and disability, I see no use in making for myself. But my husband seemed to have learned more from reading my papers than I had from writing them. In crafting me a cane (Figure 2) as a wedding present, he expressed how he embraces his role as a caregiver even though this violates the gender norms taught by his parents.” While research has examined how making can be a tool for empowerment, we rarely explore how having work done by the right people can be differently empowering. While the gift of a cane from her husband signified his embrace of her identity, accepting the gift of a cane from her mentor, Mankoff, signified self-acceptance: “I was struggling to manage my new impairments amidst the stress of presentations and travel. After years of encouraging me to use a seat-cane, Mankoff finally decided enough was enough. She left her own seat-cane for me to pick up at the hotel lobby. In the moment, this was just problem solving, ensuring I'd get through the conference, but this was the push I needed to begin using my own cane.” The impact of canes continued through storytelling during this self-study. Bennett was ashamed of using a white-cane for several years. Though Bennett's pride in using one evolved before our conversations, learning of canes’ additional potential to symbolize and deepen caring relationships transformed her personal understanding of support systems. Like all technology, AT exists in a system of relationships. None of the canes in these narratives completely resolve the users’ barriers to mobility, nor offer novelty over standard solutions. However, they exist as tools to work through the meaning of disability in a relationship. Making and curating allows us to express our roles as care-givers, care-receivers, partners, family, mentors, and mentees. The acquisition of AT means more than just the access it brings."
