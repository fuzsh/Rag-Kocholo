        "text": "Throughout Barnard's history, alumnae and friends have provided significant and much appreciated support through bequests, life income, and other planned gifts. The tradition of legacy giving helps ensure Barnard's continued excellence for future generations of students.\n\nThe Athena Society recognizes legacy donors who have made one or more of these gifts. By making a planned gift—and letting the College know you have done so—you are eligible to become a member of the Athena Society.\n\nBy joining the Athena Society, you benefit the College in meaningful ways: by helping us plan for the College's future, ensuring that we can carry out your intentions, and inspiring others to take advantage of these special ways of supporting Barnard. If you join anonymously, you will still be counted in our membership, but we will not publish your name in external communications.\n\nThe College acknowledges members' thoughtful planning for Barnard's future by\n\nInviting them to an exclusive, annual event of the Athena Society\n\nSending them special communications\n\nOffering confidential, personalized gift planning services\n\nIf you are 60 years old or more and have included Barnard in your estate plans you can document your bequest intention. By doing so, you will enable us to plan for the future, help honor your intentions and count your gift toward campaign and class fundraising totals. In most cases, you may document your future gift by simply completing and returning Barnard's Planned Gift Notification Form. In some instances, Barnard will ask you for additional documentation, particularly if you have restricted your bequest to a specific area or have designated Barnard as a beneficiary of a retirement fund.\n\nFor more information, please contact Alison White, Director, Planned Giving, at 212.853.8314 or plannedgiving@barnard.edu.\n\nMembers"
