Your report is private, confidential, and anonymous.\n\nTo make an online report, click the link above, or go to www.safeschoolhelpline.com. Alternatively, you can text 614-426-0240 then write TIPS. Finally, you can call 800-418-6423 Ext. 359\n\nYou and your friends deal with school issues every day. You know what we are doing right, and you can suggest changes that help us keep our schools safe.\n\nAt times, students like you overhear information that you don’t feel you can share. When someone uses drugs in the school, bullies, threatens violence, or commits illegal actions, it can hurt the school – and all of us.\n\nWe have subscribed to a service that allows students and parents to report this information anonymously. We hope the information outlined here will answer your questions and ease your mind – so you can help keep our school a safe place to learn."
