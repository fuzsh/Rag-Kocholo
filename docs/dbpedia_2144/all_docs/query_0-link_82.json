Her dissertation explores conditions of social change through strategic litigation in Germany. In this project she develops the idea of ‘litigation collectives’ as key factor for the success of strategic claims. During her research stay at the Center for the Study of Law & Society, Lisa will be working on a comparative chapter that juxtaposes the expansion of strategic litigation as a particular mode of legal mobilization in the US, Germany and on the transnational level. Besides her primary focus on courts, litigation and social movements, she is further interested in feminist legal studies, migration studies and socio-legal research methods. Lisa is a lawyer by training but was familiarized with research methods in social sciences through her work in an ethnographic research project on migration and German administrative law between 2016 and 2017. In 2018, she co-founded the graduate network Socio-Legal Lab. Through workshops, summer schools, film screenings and informal get-togethers, the Socio-Legal Lab provides a space to discuss the challenges of interdisciplinary research on law and society. Moreover, she is a member of the project group of the Integrated Research Institute “Law & Society” at Humboldt University Berlin. (1/6/20 – 4/30/20) lisa.hahn@rewi.hu-berlin.de\n\nMel Greenlee received her PhD in Linguistics and her J.D. from the University of California-Berkeley. Subsequently, she conducted research on language acquisition, bilingualism and other sociolinguistic topics at CUNY’s Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños, UCLA and Stanford, before returning to academia as a law student, where she focused on criminal defense and immigration law. Later, as a senior staff attorney at the California Appellate Project (CAP) in San Francisco, her defense work of over two decades centered on legal assistance to California capital appeals and in habeas corpus matters, aiding the ever-growing number of prisoners sentenced to death in challenging their convictions and sentences at the post-conviction stage. For many years, she has also conducted trainings and workshops on the role of language in capital trials and presented linguistic analysis of courtroom language to U.S. and international fora, addressing, for example, interpreter error, implications of prosecutors’ arguments, defense objections, and the role of language in determining a defendant’s competence to stand trial or for self-representation. Her work has appeared in such diverse journals as Language & Law/Linguagem e Direito, Applied Psycholinguistics, and the Journal of Pragmatics. Currently, having retired from her CAP attorney role, she continues her research and publication on sociolinguistic aspects of criminal cases, particularly as these affect capital proceedings.

He received his Ph.D. from Ryukoku University in 2010. He was a post doctoral researcher in the Ryukoku Corrections and Rehabilitation Center, the only private academic research center specializing in criminal justice and criminology in Japan. His research interests are Criminology and Criminal Justice. More specifically, the issues of drug crime punishments through the lens of “Penal Welfarism” as rehabilitation versus traditionally punitive measures. His current projects also include a focus on both the Death Penalty and Life Imprisonment in Japan. His book, “Keiji-shihou ni okeru Drug Addiction-Programs: Kaihuku wo meguru kenri to gimu [Treatment Programs for Drug Abusers in the Criminal Justice System: Are these a Responsibility of Clients?]” (Nihon-Hyoron-Sha, 2015), received the Academic Encouragement Prize of the Education and Research Center for Criminal Justice and Juvenile Justice. (8/1/18-3/31/20) maruyama@ris.ac.jp\n\nNoboru Yanase is a Professor at the College of Law, Nihon University, Japan. He received his L.L.M. and Ph.D. from Keio University. He is an author of many articles and books, including two single-authored books on the Japanese saiban-in (lay judge) system and the theory of deliberative democracy. His main area of research and teaching is constitutional law. Recently, he has actively advanced the international community’s understanding of Japanese constitutional theory, through publishing peer-reviewed articles in both Japanese and English. He has primarily focused his research on public participation in justice, and on this topic he was selected as a presenter at the Annual Meeting in 2016 by one of the most prestigious academic societies in Japan. He is also one of the few active researchers on the impeachment system in Japan, conducting comparative studies with the federal impeachment system in the U.S. As one of the leading experts in deliberative polling in Japan, he has managed most of the authorized deliberative polls in Japan, and his work in this regard has garnered him awards from the Japanese Association of Comparative Constitutional Law. (3/27/19-3/25/21) yanase.noboru@nihon-u.ac.jp\n\nDana Hayward is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology at Yale University. Her research explores the culture-shifting potential of the law – in other words, the power of the law to alter social norms and values. However, it can be difficult to study the cultural impact of legislation empirically, as laws both shape and are shaped by their cultural contexts. In her work, Dana suggests that a comparative analysis of close votes offers a promising solution to this dilemma. Drawing on insights from quasi-experimental research design, she argues that legislative decisions that pass or fail by narrow margins allow for comparisons in which levels of cultural support for law reform are held constant. While in residence at the Center, Dana will be working on her dissertation, which asks: How does legislative change affect the framing of moral issues? She conducts a qualitative comparative-historical analysis of four narrowly approved or defeated citizens’ initiatives that appeared on the ballot in the Western United States between 1990 and 1998. In each case, she compares how the issue was framed before, during, and after the approval or defeat of the measure, focusing particularly on media, political, and social movement discourses. She looks specifically at legislation in the issue areas of physician-assisted death and parental notification of abortion, as these issues raise similar sociological and ethical questions about bodily autonomy, informed consent, and the power of the state to regulate life and death. Dana holds an M.A. in Sociology from Yale, as well as an M.A. in Political Science and a B.Soc.Sc. (summa cum laude) in International Development and Globalization from the University of Ottawa. More information about Dana’s research can be found at www.danahayward.com.

Gwyn’s research examines how the interaction between law and social movements affects patterns of inequality and social change. Her recent work investigates how impact litigation has affected the LGBT movement, including the power dynamics among LGBT movement organizations, and the compatibility of the mainstream movement’s goals with the more underrepresented segments of the LGBT community. She is currently working on a book, Litigation and the Shaping of the LGBT Movement (1985-2015), which highlights a series of mechanisms that have enabled litigation to dominate the agendas of LGBT and queer activists working outside the courtroom. Gwyn received her J.D. and a Ph.D. in Jurisprudence & Social Policy from UC Berkeley. Prior to joining the UW faculty, Professor Leachman was a fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA.

He has defended numerous persons accused of capital offenses, homicides, and other felony offenses throughout various parts of the United States, in both Federal and State courts. While primarily a trial lawyer, in part because of his lengthy tenure as Chair, Co-Chair, or Vice Chair of the Amicus Curiae Committee of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice (CACJ), in addition to having tried many cases he has been involved in litigations before the United States Supreme Court and numerous other reviewing tribunals around the United States, resulting in more than 100 published decisions. He has been a lawyer with the Mexican Capital Legal Assistance Program since 2004 and has represented both Mexico and the Philippines in litigations in courts of the United States. He has qualified as an expert witness on a number of aspects of the defense of cases, and has testified on the subject of the competence of individuals to be subject to trial in courts in the United States. In addition, throughout his career, John has been involved in teaching, research and writing aimed primarily at persons practicing in the legal system. He is a regular author or coauthor of book chapters specific to California criminal procedure and has published more than 80 times in journals and periodicals on a wide array of subjects, including forensic mental health and practice recommendations for lawyers. He has often lectured to audiences of practicing lawyers and practicing forensic mental health practitioners. A two-time Fulbright Scholar, he was a law school faculty member for more than 10 years, and has often presented to lawyers and students outside the United States. He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by CACJ in 2106, the 2016 Rosoff Distinguished Research Award from the Department of Criminology, Law, and Society at UC Irvine, and in 2014, he was recognized for his contributions to forensic mental health practice by the Forensic Mental Health Association of California. In the Spring of 2019, he was named Visiting Scholar at the Center for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania, thereby continuing his focus on the intersection between mental health assessment and criminal law, with recent attention on the assessment of future violence.

He has two LL.M. degrees in both the U.K. and the U.S., and is awarded Ph.D from Kobe University. He has a particular interest in the legal duty of corporate directors as fiduciaries of shareholders. He has written a series of articles on the fiduciary duties of corporate directors in different contexts.\n\nHe is also qualified as a lawyer (Bengoshi) in Japan. As he developed his practical work, he began to think that the legal concept of the director’s fiduciary duty should be better understood by the Japanese people, and the investor’s class action system is necessary in order to enforce it. Korea and Taiwan already have such a system. Recently, the Japanese government has enacted a regulation which gives consumer groups the right to bring a class action. He believes that the introduction of the class action system for investors come true in the near future.

She is currently a blog staff member of the italian journal “Studi sulla questione criminale” and she is a cultured subject of Criminology at the Bologna faculty of Law. She is a law graduate and she attended a Master in Critical Criminology at the University of Padua. She also had her practical period of learning to become a loyer. Her study interests move to different fields: social movements, political economy of punishment, crime prevention, race and racism from a political and criminological points of view. Her graduation thesis was focused on Bologna housing squats and on that particular form of protest that is the block of evictions. Her master thesis was related both to the empirical study of some criminal preventive measures (precautionary measures ante-delictum) and on some more theoretical aspects of the so called “Dialectic of the criminal and the political”. The dialectic was related to the investigation of the actual politicization process of the criminal question hypothesizing how, on the other side, would be possible to politicize the social composition ri-aggregating it on political definition rather than criminal. Eventually with her phd project work she’s tryng to understand the functioning mechanisms of the italian administrative personal preventive measures through an empirical documental research conducted on the special survilliance ordinances imposed in the city of Bologna from 2011 to 2018 by “preventive” judges. The reasearch is tryng to stress for istance the concept of social dangerousness, safety and security, abitual delinquency.

Finlay is a PhD candidate in Sociology at Indiana University, Bloomington. His research focuses on the processes by which people, places, and things transcend a state of liminality, and transition from illegitimate to legitimate, and/or illegal to legal. For example, his master’s thesis examined how a quasi-legal organization (i.e. medical cannabis dispensary) sought legitimacy from broader society, despite the fact they violated some set of laws in doing so. In this case, understanding how cannabis became stigmatized at the macro level, and how it continues to be destigmatized at all levels of society, helps us to better understand how legal and social change comes to be. His dissertation project focuses on understanding how the formerly incarcerated use higher education as a tool to reshape how they view themselves and how they are seen in broader society. These efforts to understand decriminalization, destigmatization, and legitimation processes are directly tied to his own experiences as a formerly incarcerated person.

Doron’s doctoral dissertation introduces the disability con stereotype, the common apprehension that people “fake disabilities” to exploit disability rights, from academic accommodations to parking privileges. Through statistical analysis conducted on an original data set, a series of survey experiments, and in-depth interviews, the work reveals how the moral panic about abuse of law affects legislation, court decisions and the lives of Americans with disabilities. His work has been cited by a U.S. federal court as well as by the Israeli Supreme Court and was also featured in the New York Times. Doron holds an LL.B, an LL.M, and a BA in Communication, all from the University of Haifa (2009), as well as a JSM from Stanford Law School (2014). (08/18-6/19) ddorfman@stanford.edu\n\nBrandon M. Finlay is a PhD candidate in Sociology at Indiana University, Bloomington. His research focuses on the processes by which people, places, and things transcend a state of liminality, and transition from illegitimate to legitimate, and/or illegal to legal. For example, his master’s thesis examined how a quasi-legal organization (i.e. medical cannabis dispensary) sought legitimacy from broader society, despite the fact they violated some set of laws in doing so. In this case, understanding how cannabis became stigmatized at the macro level, and how it continues to be destigmatized at all levels of society, helps us to better understand how legal and social change comes to be. His dissertation project focuses on understanding how the formerly incarcerated use higher education as a tool to reshape how they view themselves and how they are seen in broader society. These efforts to understand decriminalization, destigmatization, and legitimation processes are directly tied to his own experiences as a formerly incarcerated person.
