        "text": "Pet insurance reimburses you for a portion of covered vet bills if your dog or cat were to unexpectedly get hurt or sick so that you can afford to get your pet the best care in the event of a costly accident or illness. Think of pet insurance like car insurance â itâs there to give you a financial safety net if something unexpected were to happen. Just like your car insurance doesnât cover routine maintenance or any accidents you got into before purchasing the policy, pet insurance plans typically donât cover routine care costs and pre-existing conditions. Learn more about pet insurance works.\n\nThe cost of pet insurance prices can vary widely depending on the type of pet you have, their age, their breed, and even where you live. At Embrace, we allow you to personalize parts of your policy so that you can get the best plan for your petâs needs and your budget. Learn more about our pricing options.\n\nNo pet insurance company covers pre-existing conditions.\n\nHowever, Embrace does distinguish between curable and incurable pre-existing conditions. Examples of incurable pre-existing conditions include diabetes, allergies, etc. Curable pre-existing conditions include things like ear infections and undiagnosed vomiting or diarrhea. As these issues can be completely cleared up, they could be covered moving forward if the pet goes 12 months symptom free.\n\nWe define what conditions are pre-existing for your pet by requesting their medical records for the 12 months (or less, if they are a new addition) prior to the purchase of the policy. If youâd like, you can request that we do a Medical History Review, which involves one of our claims adjusters reviewing your petâs medical records to let you know what â if any â conditions would be considered pre-existing. Itâs important to note that we donât automatically do these medical history reviews, you must request one. However, they are free of charge and available to anyone who has a policy.\n\nFinancial challenges happen, and that's the very reason pet insurance is worth it if you can find a way to fit the premiums into your budget. It's easier to find a small amount each month than thousands of dollars at once in an emergency. If youâre the type of person who would do anything to save your pet, itâs better to pay a small premium for even a basic policy to help get your pet the care they need."
