        "text": "By Thomas L. Schwenk, M.D.\n\nJessica L. Younger often called cancer “the best worst thing.” As Jessica’s colleague, office neighbor and friend, I was an eyewitness to this strange paradox.\n\nSo much good followed Jessica’s glioblastoma diagnosis in October 2017-more honesty, more recognition of special moments, more saying of the things that often go unsaid, remarkable and unified support. Alongside the good, there was heartache, a gradual yet relentless grief, and bouts of anger at the unfairness of it all-especially when modern medicine and “unicorn magic” simply couldn’t do any more, and our dear friend and colleague had to leave us.\n\nIn February, following Jessica’s official retirement from UNR Med, I was able to recognize her many accomplishments and contributions with the Dean’s Distinguished Service Award. While Jessica wasn’t able to attend her celebration, she joined in from home.\n\nI’d like to share with you much of what I said that evening in an effort to encapsulate a spirit that shone so brightly and will be forever missed. If you are looking a way to remember Jessica, I encourage you to share your memories in the comments. In lieu of flowers, please consider a gift to the edible garden which is being established on campus in Jessica’s honor.\n\nOne of my most important responsibilities each year is to choose the recipient of the Dean’s Distinguished Service Award. This award dates back at least 15 years and recognizes a UNR Med faculty member who has made extraordinary contributions to the success of the school of medicine and who has contributed to the school’s quality with the highest levels of excellence and commitment. I have the great privilege of presenting the award this evening to Jessica L. Younger, Chief of Staff in the School of Medicine and the Division of Health Sciences.\n\nJessica graduated on the Dean’s List with a B.S. in Business Administration in 2003, majoring in supply chain management, logistics and marketing. There is no better preparation for the position of Chief of Staff, who has to balance so many priorities and initiatives.\n\nFollowing some early business experiences, she was hired as the administrative assistant in the Office of the Dean of the School of Medicine in August 2007, working for Dean John MacDonald. Shortly after that, the roles of Dean and Vice President for Health Sciences split, and she stayed with Dr. MacDonald in his Vice President role, responsible for a wide range of human resources, personnel management, budget, planning, and university-wide liaison programs, until I arrived in 2011.\n\nI met Jessica in 2011 in a way that says so much about her style. On the final day of my recruitment interviews, Jessica was my campus host, taking me from one meeting to the next and then on to the airport. I learned later that she had asked Dr. Cheryl Hug-English, interim School of Medicine dean, if it would be acceptable to ask for that assignment. Cheryl said yes, Jessica asked, and as a result, we spent four hours together driving around Reno and the University campus in her L.L. Bean Ford Explorer. As Jessica gave me a folder with my boarding pass, she said she was taking the liberty of including a copy of her resume as well-nothing more, no elevator pitch, no specific request. We had spent enough time together that morning for me to know I was honored that she had somehow decided she would like to work with me.\n\nWhen I was eventually selected for the role of Dean and started thinking about how to structure the support for the Dean’s office, literally everyone I asked for advice pointed to Jessica. She started as Executive Assistant, but I soon realized we needed more. We needed a Chief of Staff, a role for which there was no precedent at the University. Jessica created the role and the precedent.\n\nJessica is often referred to as my Chief of Staff. She is not. She is the school’s Chief of Staff. She is your Chief of Staff. Audrey Goodnight said it best in her nomination statement for this award: “Whether known to you or not, Jessica has touched the lives and careers of every single person in this room, and throughout the School in this role.”\n\nJessica pushes colleagues when they need to be pushed, and supports them when they need support. Every single member of the School of Medicine has benefited by her commitment to their success and the school’s success. She is a mentor and she is a colleague to all.\n\nOne of the ways you can learn a lot about a colleague is to look at what is on the walls of her office. Many of you have seen the pictures in Jessica’s office of Radar O’Reilly, the company clerk in the TV show, M.A.S.H. Radar was always three steps ahead of Colonels Henry Blake and Sherman Potter. I am hoping I am not as bumbling as either of those characters, but Jessica was definitely always three steps ahead of me.\n\nI have spent more time with Jessica in the last nine years than with anyone, with the exception of my wife, Jane-maybe. I walked into the office on dozens of mornings to say that I had a thought about what to do with a particular dilemma or issue, and she would say she had thought about the very same issue just that morning, except that-like Radar O’Reilly-she was about three steps ahead of me in solving it. We finish each other’s sentences. We sometimes start talking at the same time, about the same topic, in the same way. I trust her judgment, and I respect her when she tells me, so carefully but so certainly, when I am wrong.\n\nWhen we redecorated the office a couple years ago, guided by Jessica in her tasteful but frugal way, she put up four framed prints, each with a graphic design of a brief phrase.\n\nBe connected. Stay excited. Move forward. Do the right thing.\n\nYou could not sum up a better work ethic, or one with higher principles, than with those four phrases. This is how Jessica has approached every dilemma and challenge we have confronted in the last nine years together.\n\nJessica dedicated her time to the University in numerous ways, the importance of which is not a list of routine committee memberships, but the power she brought to those roles to do important work. Her motto, which you can see on a small magnetic sticker in her office, defines how she approached these responsibilities: Blame No One, Expect Nothing, Do Something.\n\nOne of her most notable contributions prior to retirement was serving as a regional representative to the national organizations of dean’s assistants, sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges. She elevated the importance of that group, expanded its membership, and contributed to a more sophisticated approach to program planning that has led to a stronger and more influential national organization.\n\nJessica has been particularly committed to promoting the career growth of women in the School of Medicine. Jessica was involved with the University’s development of a series of leadership courses a few years ago, and has taken that initiative to new levels of success within UNR Med, with a particular focus on women in leadership roles. She has served as a personal mentor to so many faculty and staff members at UNR Med, particularly women whose careers and lives have been enhanced by her leadership.\n\nWhen the division of health sciences launched the Orvis School of Nursing and the School of Community Health Sciences as independent schools, Jessica served in a key transition role, working hard to ensure that this launch was a success and the schools would achieve their proper roles. These are examples of one of her most notable skills: creating positive professional relationships and nurturing strong connections across campus and around the country. She has served in a critical liaison role to literally dozens of key stakeholders, Regents, community leaders, health system executives, and community physicians. As best I can tell, she knows everyone on campus.\n\nAs UNR Med shifted to a northern Nevada-based school of medicine, Jessica played an instrumental role in a complex, often complicated, sometimes difficult transition. Building and maintaining nuanced relationships with stakeholders, old and new, were critical tasks to helping position our school as a fully northern Nevada-based school. The impact of this transition and Jessica’s role in it cannot be overstated.\n\nJessica isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions, and isn’t satisfied by “that’s the way we’ve always done it.” A great example is the restructure of our Advancement and Engagement team. Jessica saw that the fragmented model of the past, with each function isolated in its own silo, did not meet the needs of an increasingly complex School of Medicine. She recognized the efficiencies and innovation that could be developed through a strategic reorganization.\n\nThis change has had an incredibly important impact on the reputation of the School of Medicine, and in the process has positioned UNR Med as one of the major ways that the entire University is known to the community. Jessica’s analytical and leadership skills were critical to the success of the A+E team in taking this new direction. The sweeping changes were accomplished through Jessica’s focus on people-their aspirations, strengths and goals. This attention to our most precious resource is also reflected in her contributions as the driving force behind our efforts to assess and improve the culture in the School of Medicine. The results of this initiative may well be the most powerful manifestation of the impact of Jessica’s contributions on our success.\n\nAnd then there is her laugh. One laugh can brighten an entire day, perhaps an entire week. Jessica’s laugh is an expression of her sheer joy in life, of her connection with the world around her, of her energy and optimism, and of her appreciation for being a part of this life. I told her once, at the depth of our miseries as we worked through the many threats to the School in my early times here, that no matter how bleak the situation, no matter how bad the day, there was always her laugh that would get us through. It is that powerful.\n\nOne of our core values is “People are our strength.” Our school is only as good as its people. Some members of UNR Med have outsized influence on our success, and Jessica is one of those people. Our other core values emphasize innovation, improvement, respect, trust and integrity. Jessica embodies those values in an intense, aspirational way. She has taught me, and made clear to so many of you, that we do not succeed in spite of our core values; we succeed because of our core values.\n\nFor that reason alone, and on top of all of Jessica’s many achievements over the last 13 years, she is most deserving of being recognized with the Dean’s Distinguished Service Award.\n\nThomas L. Schwenk, M.D., serves as Professor of Family and Community Medicine, Dean of the School of Medicine and Vice President of Health Science at the University of Nevada, Reno."
