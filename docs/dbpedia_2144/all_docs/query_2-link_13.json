        "text": "Talya was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Alicent Hightower and a spy in Mysaria's employ.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Season 1[]\n\nWhen Rhaenyra is brought before Alicent shortly after giving birth to Joffrey Velaryon, Alicent tells Talya to fetch Rhaenyra a cushion. She later walks in on a conversation between Alicent and Larys Strong, but is quickly sent out.[1]\n\nTalya secretly meets Mysaria and delivers her information regarding the recent events: royal audience to decide the succession of House Velaryon, the last supper of King Viserys, the factions of the royal family, and the subsequent fight between Rhaenyra's sons and Alicent's sons.[2]\n\nJon informs Talya about the recent death of King Viserys. In turn, she quickly informs Queen Alicent. In the following hours, Talya, along with other servants, are imprisoned at the command of Ser Otto Hightower, in order to prevent the news of Viserys's death and the plans of the Green Council to crown Prince Aegon from spreading and reaching Rhaenyra on Dragonstone.[4]\n\nIn exchange for a sexual favor, Larys informs Alicent that Talya is one of Mysaria's spies.[4]\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Season 2[]\n\nLarys informs Alicent that all imprisoned servants were questioned, and those found guilty of espionage were executed.[5]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nTalya is portrayed by Alexis Raben, a producer on the show and the wife of Miguel Sapochnik.\n\nIn the books[]\n\nIn Fire & Blood, there is no character named Talya. The servant who informed Queen Alicent of Viserys's death, and was later imprisoned to keep the secret, was a man, and his name is not mentioned.\n\nAppearances[]\n\n– \"The Princess and the Queen\"\n\n– \"Driftmark\"\n\n– \"The Lord of the Tides\"\n\n– \"The Green Council\"\n\n– \"A Son for a Son\" (mentioned indirectly)\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]\n\nTalya on The Official Guide"
