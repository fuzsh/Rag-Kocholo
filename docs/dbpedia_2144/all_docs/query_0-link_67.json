        "text": "First – Previous\n\nI’m going to take a slightly different approach to this issue. I want to more explicitly try to work out the function it serves in the overall run because it wasn’t immediately clear to me. And by function, I mean how it serves the run’s story and themes. Obviously, as I hope my Character Studies help prove, every panel serves some function in the broader DC universe. This concept is made more challenging by my increasingly foggy memories of what happens later in the run. Still, I hope it will be a fun and illuminating way of engaging with the material. Especially this issue. I’m not sure the issue is well-executed. It seems to get lost in the fight scene and the banter. However, I do think there are some essential story threads here. And drawing them out is worthwhile.\n\nThe best part of the issue is the interactions between Dick and Damian. Dick’s love for his little brother is deeply moving and depicted in such a compelling and understated way\n\n(12-13). Seeing him support Damian through a difficult time is the primary selling point for what makes reading this enjoyable. But I’m not sure if that story beat is the issue’s purpose. Sure, it helps the overall run to argue that the Batfamily in general, and the Wayne family in particular, have a fulfilling and meaningful emotional connection. But I think the real purpose this subplot serves is to specifically explore Damian’s relationship to his parents\n\n(12). Part of what committing to a life with Selina means for Bruce is expanding his circle of support and focusing more on his emotional well-being. For Damian, torn between frequently warring, separated parents, having a father who is more emotionally engaged will make his adolescence better. And having a mother who is at peace with the way his father’s life is progressing will also be ultimately good for him. His well-being is also at stake in this confrontation. Therefore, the arc spends a lot of time on him. Plus, Damian’s relationship with parental figures will come up again as a motive behind his more plot-focused actions.\n\nHolly is the other clear purpose of the issue. Although she will appear as an actual character in the next issue, this issue establishes that looking for her is Bruce and Selina’s motivation\n\n(17). Mentioning her here allows for audience suspense to build between this issue and the next one. The information isn’t used as a big reveal. And an astute audience member could probably guess what Bruce and Selina were doing. But given that Holly will appear in the next issue, introducing that mild level of suspense here makes her appearance in the next issue a bigger payoff. Whereas not mentioning her earlier allowed the suspense for the confrontation with Talia to build going into this issue.\n\nWhile these elements are the most compelling parts of the issue, it would be ridiculous not to address that the vast majority of the issue consists of Bruce and Selina bantering\n\n(1). They are also fighting enemies. And, when Talia comes on the scene, the tone shifts. But their banter is the primary focus. This banter has been present in every issue where Bruce and Selina have shared page time to one degree or another. It would be ridiculous to suggest that this issue adds any new dimension to it. But I do think we can find some value in it as an indication of Bruce and Selina’s solidifying partnership. Bruce is most used to working with his Robins, and we see this in the way he talks to Selina about Talia’s men attacking them\n\n(7). There’s no reason he should be trying to prompt Selina for the right answer except force of habit from working with his children (and their friends). She takes it in good humor. Other than some light ribbing, she even treats it as a learning experience out of respect for his skill as a detective\n\n(7). Fitting this exchange into their overall banter, we can see that, in spite of the light tone they use with each other, they aren’t totally comfortable as partners yet. The light tone and easy flow of their banter indicate that they’ll probably get there, but this is still a developing relationship.\n\nSo those are the purposes: explore Damian’s parental relationships both to acknowledge the family unit and emotionally set up his future actions, create the appropriate tension around Holly in the arc, and show how Bruce and Selina’s dynamic is developing. There are a few topics I want to explore that aren’t directly related to the function of the issue, but that feels like a violation of my experiment. The most important one I talked about last time, anyway. And the less important ones I can probably talk about next time. So we’ll leave it here.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI haven’t done a question in a while, but this lends itself incredibly well to one. Do you agree with me about the function of the issue?\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Jones, Joëlle. Bellaire, Jordie. Cowles, Clayton. “The Rules of Engagement, Part 2.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 34, DC Comics, 2018.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nFull disclosure: I’m having a bit of trouble getting back into the swing of Exploring a Run. As my slump has led to me writing approximately a paragraph a day (if that), it has been a very long time between my last Exploring and this one. I didn’t expect it would be difficult to find the rhythm since it was very easy for Character Studies, but it has been. While the gap between working on this Exploring and the next one won’t necessarily be that much shorter, I will be more prepared for it. Hopefully that struggle isn’t noticeable in the end result, but if it is, know I am working on a strategy for how to approach the next one more comfortably.\n\nFor me, the most interesting part of this issue happens right at the beginning, with Selina killing the horse\n\n(1). It establishes an aspect of Bruce and Selina’s relationship that hasn’t been explored up to this point. Certainly not in King’s run, but I don’t think really at all. Selina’s more flexible moral code means that Bruce is happy to step back and let her do the dirty work. This is also shown in her beating up the gate guard\n\n(13), but that’s less striking. Bruce doesn’t have a problem beating people up. He may be unwilling to in this case for complicated political reasons, but mostly he just seems to be letting her have her way. Killing the horse, though, that’s more uncomfortable for Bruce. While his no-killing rule doesn’t necessarily include animals, he would certainly be less comfortable pulling the trigger than Selina. And in both these instances, taking the action isn’t actually the point. There’s a reason the art lingers on the horse’s dead body\n\n(5). Whether or not Bruce would do those things, Selina doing them tells us something about their relationship. This is the other side of the coin to Bruce’s willingness to let Selina get away with more crime than other Gotham villains. She’s able to take on the tasks that might stain his hands. And their relationship, when at its best, creates a version of Bruce as a character whose moral code is slightly less rigid.\n\nThe focus on this aspect of their relationship seems to fit in with the overall arc. Talia is Bruce’s other famously morally gray paramour. While Bruce standing back to let Talia do the dirty work isn’t (to my memory, anyway) a major part of their relationship, King is clearly setting up the meeting between Talia and Selina by drawing attention to the parallels between the two women. Talia’s characterization in comics is controversial. And, frankly, I have no particular desire to wade into that controversy. But it’s safe to say that, as far as her on-page actions, she has, at times, been an extremely dark character. By pulling Selina’s darker aspects to the forefront, the audience understands that these two great loves of Bruce’s life are more similar than they are different. This both foreshadows the explosive confrontation the issue is setting up and offers insight into Bruce. He is as drawn to darkness as he is repelled by it. This is a complication for Batman, but an aspect of Bruce’s psyche that he cannot avoid and thus has to learn to contend with.\n\nI said I don’t want to dig into the controversies around Talia’s characterization, and I stand by that, but there is something I have to address in this issue. This panel made me uncomfortable\n\n(20). It implies a certain amount of Orientalism. If you weren’t aware, around the Victorian era (although also for some time before and after), there was a general public fascination in Europe with the concept of the “harem” and the idea of the “barbaric sexual” practices of the Middle East. I’m hardly an expert, but you can read a bit more about that cultural fascination here, here, and here (if you’re in Chicago, I wasn’t able to quickly find as clear or concise an explanation as the one on the information plaques at the Chicago Institute of Art). Although those tropes aren’t super common in Western art and literature anymore, they do still impact our conception of many of the cultures they were initially applied to. To have Talia, a character who has never shown much interest in orgies, introduced to the run in this way simply feels racist. If this sort of sexual liberation had its roots in her history as a character or was given real attention instead of being shoved into the background for an establishing shot, it might not feel that way. But alas, here we are.\n\nThe last significant aspect of the Batman side of this issue that I want to discuss is the re-emergence of Batman as myth\n\n(12). King has poked at this topic a few times. This time we examine how, beyond Gotham, the in-universe cultural myth of Batman is explicitly tied to other prominent figures. In the case of this guard, Batman is tied to the political might of the Justice League and the influence of Talia. Batman can be a myth outside Gotham, but only as part of a larger mythology of superheroes and their satellites.\n\nThe specter of the Justice League in this issue isn’t just mythic, though. It’s political\n\n(17). I want to save the discussion of it for later in the arc. I can’t fully remember how the situation plays out, but however it happens, I think I’ll probably have something to say—both about how this characterization of the League interacts with the run’s central mission of exploring how it feels to be Bruce Wayne and with the larger obligation the run has to the DC Universe. The mentions in the above panels hint at those topics, but knowing there’s more to come makes me want to hold off on saying anything.\n\nThe other half of this comic is less interesting from the perspective of the run as a whole, although exciting for many fans—it focuses on the Bat family home front. In King’s run, the deep ethical divides in the Bat family matter significantly less than their familial connection. While this raises troubling questions for the overall characterization of Jason, within the context of this run, it makes perfect sense. Bruce is trying to build a new version of his family. One which looks just slightly more traditional by having a marriage at its center. He’s not expounding on the value of the nuclear family. However, he is envisioning a future where his emotional support system is a little more structured and accessible. Having as many of the kids hanging out at home in their downtime feeds into the new version of Bruce for the audience\n\n(11). Focused on his mission, Bruce probably doesn’t even know they are all there. But the audience sees the Bat family, particularly the subset of the Wayne family within the larger Bat family, looking more emotionally close than ever before.\n\nIn this focus on Bruce’s emotional support pillars, Alfred’s role in everything is sharper and more important. But also less acknowledged by Bruce. In the plot of the comic, Alfred’s actions in Batman Vol. 3 #33 look very different than him quietly sweeping up the room after Swamp Thing in Batman Vol. 3 #23 or serving supervillains dinner in Batman Vol. 3 #29. He’s lying to Superman\n\n(15)! But functionally, for Bruce, they are the same. He provides quiet background support, taking on tasks Bruce doesn’t even think to ask him to do and inserting himself into the dangerous world Bruce has chosen to live in. Not because he necessarily agrees with Bruce’s actions (in this case, he explicitly doesn’t\n\n(10)) but because he loves and feels responsible for Bruce. He works constantly, and largely quietly, in the background to ensure Bruce gets what he wants. It raises complicated questions as to whether he is an enabler or a supporter, the answers to which largely depend on how much you agree with Bruce’s actions. This run isn’t interested in those questions, though. What matters is he is there for Bruce under all circumstances, to the point that Bruce feels he can rely on him without even really thinking about it. He is a parent and a servant.\n\nBruce’s proteges aren’t just in the issue to represent Bruce’s family ties and react to Alfred’s actions, though. Bruce proposing to Selina and going to tell Talia about it both significantly impact Damian’s story. He is clearly rattled by everything that is happening and needs to find a way to deal with it\n\n(19). The text takes the time to emphasize the close relationship between Dick and Damian, which has been largely off-page since Flashpoint, by having Dick be the primary source of comfort for Damian\n\n(19). Damian and Dick will both play significant roles in the run as it goes on, so further fleshing out their characters and what this means to them is valuable for the story overall. It’s also necessary, from a connected continuity standpoint, for King’s work to acknowledge that there are ramifications beyond Batman to what is happening. Dick comforting Damian does both while also paying off on existing audience investment in their relationship.\n\nThere is one stylistic thing I want to talk about really quickly. I talked with Batman Vol. 3 #14 about why I think King’s dialogue works. I want to acknowledge that this issue demonstrates a way that it can fail. The semi-lyrical style with lots of pauses and implied meaning doesn’t gel well with some comic staples. Both are melodramatic, but they are melodramatic in opposite directions. With King’s dialogue trying to bring in more emotional weight and the implication of a character’s thought processes, and traditional comic melodrama trying to create excitement and clearly defined character traits. King isn’t the first writer to have Selina say meow in dialogue (most notably in another medium and continuity: Batman Returns (1992)) as if saying “meow” constantly is a thing a human being would naturally do. And, to be honest, it has never worked super well. But it feels even more awkward than normal because it so dramatically contrasts the rest of King’s writing style\n\n(13). This was true before Batman Vol. 3 #33, but it wasn’t until reading this issue that I was really able to put my finger on the problem. Ultimately, this isn’t a huge deal. But it can be a bit jarring.\n\nThis comic sets up the overall arc very well. Hopefully, I managed to do it justice despite my rustiness. And it will be exciting to explore the story as it unfolds!\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Jones, Joëlle. Bellaire, Jordie. Cowles, Clayton. “The Rules of Engagement, Part 1.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 33, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nUp until Riddler started speaking, I thought I hadn’t given this final issue enough credit. The use of silent panels to convey Bruce’s grief and desperation (1), as well as the emotional support Selina is able to give him, is truly moving (5). The issue leans into an idea common in music and visual art: sometimes emotions are too powerful for words. Here, those powerful emotions are conveyed through the body language of our characters. I don’t think the art is so powerful that it would work regardless of context. But, however one might feel about the arc, we know and love Bruce and Selina from the rest of the run (and from their much longer lives as a character). Therefore, we read their body language with compassion and empathize with them more deeply. To a certain extent, the fight scenes in this issue share this quiet (6). There are exclamations and crashes, but the dialogue doesn’t really start until the fighting has stopped. I don’t think this reliance on the art adds anything in particular to the fight scenes, but I think it does help the audience transition more smoothly out of the Bruce/Selina scenes. The audience carries the emotions of those scenes forward because the fight is subtle enough not to significantly disrupt the emotional intensity of the Bruce/Selina scenes. This allows the emotional core of the issue to linger long into the necessary plot-focused scenes.\n\nThe actual interplay between Bruce and Selina in this issue is also really enjoyable and interesting. Those ideas I talked about with #31, regarding how they consider each other’s morality, really come into play here. Objectively, what Bruce says is ridiculous (17). I will argue all day long that Bruce’s “no-kill rule” is an essential part of his character. But the theory that refusing to kill is the only thing separating him from the Joker has always been silly. I believe the character of Bruce believes it. That doesn’t mean it makes sense (or that writers should believe it). Goals, intentions, what prompts him to act, compassion, and engagement with reality are all things that separate Bruce from supervillains. He could choose to kill and keep a lot of those defining distinctions intact. Selina does not make that argument, though. Now, you could speculate that she doesn’t make it because she knows Bruce won’t accept it. But I don’t think so. She cries contemplating Bruce’s story (19). She struggles to articulate her argument (19). To me, the evidence of the text suggests that she is disappointed in his failure. Not so much that she doesn’t find it extremely easy to forgive, but still. Her morality is so guided by him that she cannot disagree with his analysis of the situation. She can only promise him that this one failure pales in comparison to her love for him. Ultimately, her speech is not, perhaps, the comfort Bruce needs, not the thing that will shift his worldview and get him to see reality more clearly. But it’s enough to get them through this moment of crisis and on the path to something better.\n\nThat something better being their engagement. I do find Bruce’s phrasing of “having” to love Selina intriguing (18). He doesn’t just love her, he needs her, and he doesn’t quite articulate why. It could be that this is simply how he describes the experience of having an emotion he didn’t intend to have. But I don’t think so. I think he has pinned a lot of himself on her by choice (his hopes for the future, a person to submit himself to, a moral compromise around her thievery that allows him to have any moral flexibility at all, a figure of comfort), and so he needs to love her to be the version of himself he wants to be, even when he isn’t that version of himself, loving her helps it feel closer. I’ll be curious to see if there are opportunities to continue to explore this aspect of his feelings for her. Otherwise, the actual engagement is lovely but nothing special. Selina pushing back on the way Bruce asked is sweet and funny (20). And her serious “yes” is a great end to the arc. There isn’t much else to say.\n\nThe last semi-positive thing I’m going to talk about is Joker’s declaration that he saved Riddler because of the “difference between a joke and a riddle” (16). Selina’s speech about how it doesn’t matter, while also saying it’s probably something deep, deflates the whole thing a bit (19). It makes it sound like the text is patting itself on the back for how “profound” it is without actually having to do the work of saying something profound. But in the moments between Joker posing the question and Selina ranting about it, the audience does get to play around with what he might have meant. Personally, I went for the most obvious answer. Jokes tend to be about subverting or disrupting audience expectations, whereas riddles tend to be about confounding expectations. Riddles need logic; jokes are often better without it. Riddler’s plan was convoluted but logical. Joker saving Riddler is totally ridiculous. But I’m sure other plausible readings exist.\n\nNow, we come to the twist (12). I have two major problems with this. First, good twists should be foreshadowed, allowing the audience to go back and see the hints adding up. Twists that pop up out of nowhere generally rely on the audience not being spoiled to have any impact at all. I’ll concede the possibility that this twist was more foreshadowed than I am giving it credit for (I’ve never been good at guessing twists), and my annoyance with Riddler’s character just made me miss the foreshadowing. But I did read the comics pretty closely (and I had read them before even though I didn’t remember the twist), and the only thing I can think that counts as foreshadowing is the absolute stupidity of Riddler’s motives, which doesn’t super work for me as a foreshadowing tool. Second, I think Riddler as master manipulator would work better for me if I hadn’t found his characterization so exhausting and annoying this whole arc. To be fair, I did really enjoy how much Joker just did not care about what Riddler was saying (13), but it wasn’t enough to make Riddler’s rant about his plan enjoyable for me.\n\nIn a run dedicated to exploring Bruce’s psyche, Riddler’s comment here should be of more note (12). The question of why Bruce does what he does is always one that hangs around his character. And insults like Riddler’s can pose massive challenges to both Bruce’s self-identity and to the audience’s perception of him. But taking Riddler seriously in this issue is so hard that it also becomes difficult to give this comment any credibility. The fact that Bruce doesn’t mention it in his talk with Selina makes me feel ok with just skating past it. But I will come back to the concept if I feel it becomes more relevant.\n\nWoof. Glad to be done with this arc!\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June. Cowles, Clayton. “The War of Jokes & Riddles, Conclusion.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 32, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nThis is one of the issues that reminds me why this arc left such a bad taste in my mouth. I find it, quite frankly, boring. And, while boredom has its place in some fiction, being boring is perhaps the worst crime a superhero comic can commit. Still, in rereading it for this project, I found it wasn’t completely devoid of value. In fact, with probably the biggest redeeming feature of the issue, it managed to do the one thing I’ve wanted the arc to do from the beginning: include jokes/riddles that naturally connect to the story without me having to bend over backward to make them fit. My favorite one is Riddler’s “bomb” riddle\n\n(4). It shouldn’t be shocking at this point to say that The War of Jokes and Riddles is building to some kind of explosion from Bruce—likely a violent one, given his encounter with Deadshot. And Bruce will be the first, and it will turn out only, one damaged by his own explosion. We see that damage further foreshadowed in this issue when he expresses concern to Selina about whether he is even worthy of her. The second is less interesting, but it works. Plus, it’s a two-for-one\n\n(20). This joke alludes to the unfinished business between the three major players of this conflict, something already reinforced by Joker’s choice to hole up in the building the war started in (I don’t love how cliche this moment is\n\n(4), but oh well). It also reinforces Bruce and Selina’s conversation by introducing the idea of marriage on the first panel of the page as Bruce builds to his final statement. And not simply the concept of marriage but an idea of marriage as a relationship in which information is shared freely. This is what I’ve been wanting from these jokes and riddles all along. If they aren’t going to be actually funny or engaging (which very few (arguably none) of them are), they should at least add something to the storytelling.\n\nWhile finally getting some good jokes and riddles was my favorite part of the issue, the hints we get at the power dynamic between Bruce and Selina are probably the most important to the run overall. Undoubtedly, this run presents Bruce and Selina’s relationship as, if not a happy ending in its own right, then at least the first step toward a happy ending. But it has never shied away from the fact that these are two incredibly damaged people, and that damage makes their relationship difficult. In this issue, we see the ways in which their individual problems combine to make their relationship unhealthy. The balance of power here is a moral one. And it is more complicated than it appears at first glance. Selina dismisses Bruce’s apology for endangering her life\n\n(7). I think, and I could be wrong, she’s actually dismissing him with a sex joke. But I don’t think I’m overstepping to read a sincere declaration of her commitment to him underneath the joke. In that context, her response becomes somewhat troubling. She doesn’t respond with assertions of her own agency but with submission to his authority. Now, I don’t think this is because Selina is denying or willing to give up her own agency. We saw her ability to decide her own future in full force earlier in the run. Still, I feel safe arguing, based on how events of the run play out and how these two are characterized, that there is a moral submission here. Selina is in charge of her own actions, but she trusts Bruce’s moral authority and that he puts her in dangerous positions for good reasons. One might think Bruce’s request for Selina’s judgment means he is submitting to her moral authority too, but I don’t think that’s true\n\n(20). Bruce knows Selina’s criminal activity better than almost anyone, and he’s not likely to soften his view on crime for her sake. Instead, I think he is submitting himself to her standards of his moral authority. That’s why these conversations taking place in the same issue is so important. Selina has entrusted herself to Bruce’s morality, to a certain extent, anyway, and to marry him would mean strengthening that aspect of their relationship. And so Bruce must confess his sins and see if Selina believes he has lived up to being the person she has always trusted him to be.\n\nThis issue seeks to wrap up Kite-Man’s story with mixed success. I would argue that, in an attempt to give the audience closure, the arc backs out of the emotional difficulty of the Kite-Man interludes. It attempts to give Kite-Man a final victory over Riddler\n\n(19) before, quite literally, shutting him up completely\n\n(19). The sense I get from the comic, and perhaps I am being unfairly cynical, is that the audience is supposed to cheer and then consider Kite-Man’s story over. But Kite-Man’s story, as told to us in #27 and #30, was not the story of revenge against Riddler. It was the story of him being buffeted by forces vastly more powerful than him\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #27 1). And even Batman, our hero, only cares about Kite-Man’s actual problems to the point that they are useful to him. Batman may mourn Charlie’s death, but he doesn’t consider the possibility of it when he recruits Kite-Man to spy for him. And he doesn’t save Charlie. Aligning himself with Batman may be the morally correct option\n\n(18), but within Kite-Man’s small world, there are no good options. And here, he is once again simply carrying out Batman’s orders in a game where he has no meaningful power. The actual events don’t undermine the emotional truth of Kite-Man’s story, but the implied expectation that the audience will cheer and then consider it finished absolutely does.\n\nI want to briefly touch on this panel\n\n(10-11). To overstate it a bit: by his mere presence, Bruce renders these supervillains heroic. That isn’t quite true. But for this one splash page, it sort of is. With the sun shining behind them and each of them positioned beneath their kites in the same kind of heroic, arms outstretched, chest puffed up, pose as Bruce, they look just as heroic as he does. As an artistic choice in a comic with so much discussion of morality, I certainly find it an interesting one. Bruce’s sense of moral authority is literally a force impacting those around him.\n\nLook, I’m not going to write more about how annoying I find these depictions of Joker and Riddler. It is not fun to write about. I can’t imagine it is fun to read about. If you’ve been keeping up with this project, you know where I stand. That said, I feel compelled to call out the moment that Joker is made to look utterly incompetent for the sake of a “joke”\n\n(12). To be fair, if this aspect of the arc didn’t already tick me off, I would probably think this was fun. Maybe even clever. But it does tick me off. So I don’t. Maybe you do!\n\nThank god this arc is almost over! I do think I’ve come to appreciate it more. And I am actually excited to examine the final issue. But rereading this comic was just exhausting, and I’m looking forward to moving on. To the best of my memory, this is the only arc of the run I disliked, so hopefully, things get brighter going forward.\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June.

Cowles, Clayton. “The Ballad of Kite Man, Part One.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 27, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nI really enjoyed writing about the first half of this interlude arc, but I struggled to fit it thematically into The War of Jokes and Riddles or the run overall. This issue helped me find a satisfying theory\n\n(16-17). The Sisyphean nature of superhero comics is remarked upon with relative frequency, both by audiences and in the meta-commentary of various story arcs. And no hero is more Sisyphean than Batman. He doesn’t just fight the same villains over and over again, although he definitely does do that; he fights for a city that never improves. Gotham never gets safer, happier, or healthier. Occasionally, the boulder rolls even further back down the hill, and Gotham gets worse. If this run is going to explore Bruce’s emotional landscape, it must engage with why he keeps going. Not just why he started or what he’s trying to accomplish, but why he continues. Kite-Man’s reasons for persevering cannot be reflected directly onto Bruce\n\n(12); however, Batman Vol. 3 #30 as a whole argues that everyone who participates in the Batman story perseveres. Joker’s troops here are portrayed more as downtrodden soldiers, victims of a war machine they have no say in, than as conniving supervillains\n\n(6). Like in the Joker-Riddler-Bruce dinner from the previous issue, everyone is fighting the same battle. So even if we can’t reflect Kite-Man’s reasoning exactly back onto Bruce, we can get a general sense of the communal impulse to perform Sisyphean tasks in Gotham.\n\nWith Batman Vol. 3 #27, I spoke about Kite-Man’s decision to align himself with the Joker and the way that decision reflects real-world current events. Now, Kite-Man faces the consequences of his decision. Aligning himself with the Joker doesn’t give him any more power than before. If anything, it gives him less power\n\n(3). He may have lost terribly in #27, but he did have opportunities to stand up for himself and his family\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #27 13). Those opportunities no longer exist. On Joker’s team, he just takes every beating. He gets no closer to avenging his son. And he claps while Joker rants\n\n(17). As a commentary, it is less poignant than #27, but it makes sense as a follow-through. Those with little power to begin with that choose to follow someone they know is cruel or terrible for the sake of gaining power rarely get the result they were hoping for.\n\nThe harsh reality of this arc is that Bruce doesn’t present Kite-Man with better options. Arguably, he could (although I wouldn’t state that definitively). But he doesn’t. Furthermore, he offers Kite-Man very little kindness and minimal empathy\n\n(18). I spoke with #27 about how Bruce doesn’t admit any culpability in Charlie’s death, but here it gets worse. He stands back and allows Riddler to use Charlie’s death to humiliate Kite-Man\n\n(20). Riddler even implies Batman encouraged Riddler to target Kite-Man in the aftermath. I don’t remember the rest of this arc super well. Maybe there’s some apology or clarification I’m forgetting, but I doubt it. As far as Kite-Man is concerned, Burce’s cruelty and violence are equal to Riddler’s and Joker’s. Our hero isn’t a better option for him. And if we’re going to understand Bruce as a character, we have to accept that too. Personally, I don’t go in for any of this “Batman is actually bad” stuff. He fits into DC’s overarching metanarrative as a hero, and dismantling that means dismantling the entire DC metanarrative. It can be done, of course, but what’s the point of even engaging with DC comics if you’re going to straight out dismiss the foundational narratives and tropes it is built on? However, DC has never positioned Bruce as a perfect hero. And while I would argue that the continued operation of Arkham as a hospital indicates Bruce does have a lot of empathy for his supervillains, he has never been effective at expressing that empathy. Which means when his smaller villains need help, they don’t turn to him. And when he has the chance to give them opportunities to be better, he rarely manages to even offer those opportunities, nevermind encouraging them to succeed. For Bruce, empathy and kindness are rarely accessible during the fight, and those around him do suffer for it.\n\nDespite the fact that Charlie is already dead, the ongoing flashback conversation does an excellent job of reminding the audience that, for all his faults, Kite-Man was a caring father who worked to develop his son’s emotional health. There’s a lot about the conversation that reads as a bit excessive or cliche. But Kite-Man’s unwillingness to bad mouth Charlie’s mom (and primary caregiver)\n\n(9), even just to contradict her, and his transformation of a painful humiliation into an opportunity to teach his son about failure are incredibly affecting\n\n(19). At the core of it, Charlie is more plot device than character. He means almost nothing to the audience in his own right. By showing us the ways that Kite-Man was a good father, our empathy for his suffering can be less about the abstract symbol of Charlie-the-child and more about the meaningful characterization of Kite-Man-the-father. This increases the emotional impact of the issue significantly.\n\nRiddler and Joker do suffer a bit from the overarching problems of the arc (especially Riddler), but I don’t feel the need to rehash those again here. The more interesting annoyance is the reappearance of Batgod. The Tweedles and Kite-Man talking about how Riddler can’t have anyone on his team that hits harder than Batman is legitimately insane\n\n(1). Even discounting Poison Ivy and anyone else whose powers aren’t physically hitting people, we know Riddler’s team has Deathstroke (chemically enhanced), Clayface (a walking avalanche), and freaking Killer Croc\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #26 18). But Batman is who spends the rest of the issue hanging over Joker’s troops like a specter. Any time Batgod appears, I get frustrated (for reasons a lot more complicated than him simply being overpowered), but after thinking about it for a bit, I have to acknowledge that there’s a pattern starting to emerge in King’s run that’s compelling. Batgod rarely makes a full appearance. But he definitely did in #2, and he pops up again here. I spoke at length about how his appearance in #2 seemed to have at least something to do with the story centering Claire and Henry’s perspectives. And this issue is obviously from Kite-Man’s perspective. Which begins to make Batgod look less like the reality of Bruce’s experience of being Batman and more like the external perception of his legend. I’m not sure that this trend is significant enough to really matter to the arc overall, but I do think it adds nuance to the run’s understanding of Batman. Now that the legend of Batman has been established, who Bruce is to himself has minimal impact on how Batman is perceived by outsiders.\n\nThere are two tiny parts of this issue I want to mention. First, and slightly more important, is this image\n\n(8). The reflected bridge is hardly an innovative artistic idea. And I’m not sure this issue uses it to much effect. As far as I can determine, it serves more to make the scene dynamic than to convey any meaning. But that doesn’t mean I love it any less. It is such a pleasing image, and it does work to make the necessary affirmation of Batman’s no-killing rule more dynamic. Second, I’m always excited to see Cluemaster because Cluemaster implies Steph\n\n(10)! (My top three Bat characters are Dick, Cass, and Steph, not necessarily in that order.) This shouldn’t seem particularly exciting. After all, Steph has literally already appeared in this run\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #7 6). But there’s something about a tangential reference, a subtle reminder she’s in this world even if she isn’t in this story, that I find incredibly satisfying. Maybe that’s just my fixation on the connected universe, but it makes me happy.\n\nI don’t feel like I got quite as much out of this interlude as I did the previous one, but it was still a good time. The exploration of the culture of Gotham and the implications of Batman Vol. 3 #27’s more explicit political commentary were fun to think about. And I like feeling like I can fit this mini-arc in with the overall run.\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June.

After all, it is a complex topic that King’s work on the character is largely uninterested in. I’m not saying Bruce’s status as a billionaire isn’t relevant to the run—it is—but in limiting the scope of my project to this run, I cannot consider the broader commentary DC does (and doesn’t) offer on Bruce’s financial power. Without the run displaying any specific interest in Bruce’s wealth, any commentary on its presence would be more a commentary on the overarching Batman mythology that King’s work draws on. That said, this issue features some intense indulgence in the extravagances of Bruce’s money. Bruce’s reference to his mother’s thoughts on problem-solving and hosting just emphasizes how steeped in generational wealth Bruce is\n\n(2-3). The nine-course meal mostly serves as a framing device. What is essential here is the use of Alfred. I have no doubt that Alfred consented to, and even helped plan, all of this. Nor do I think Bruce intends, or Alfred takes, any of Bruce’s treatment of him as a servant as a sign of disrespect\n\n(8). However, there is no denying the class-power dynamics at play here. Alfred would not be serving meals to Joker if he wasn’t employed by Bruce. Honestly, he probably wouldn’t even be in Gotham (easily the most dangerous city in the DC universe) if he didn’t work for Bruce. And framing him in the role of a more traditional servant, as opposed to the father/advisor role he plays for Bruce in private, emphasizes the class dynamics of that relationship. (DC will soon reveal that Alfred is a billionaire in his own right, something that complicates the employer-employee aspect of the Bruce-Alfred relationship but doesn’t destroy it. After all, wealth and class status are closely tied but not quite interchangeable in British or American culture.) This emphasis is particularly striking in a run that will end with Alfred’s death. I alluded to this concept with #23, but the extent to which Alfred has sacrificed for and been sacrificed by the Batfamily is a recurring motif in the run.\n\nWhile Alfred’s presence is definitely the most striking element of this issue for me, Bruce’s discussion of Batman is probably the most emotionally compelling\n\n(15). Because so much of this arc has focused on Bruce’s guilt, and because this plan is incredibly desperate and risky (costing a number of people their lives, even\n\n(19)), his assertion that Batman is “playing you for fools” has an ironic ring to it. He is both mythologizing himself in the eyes of Gotham’s criminal elite and forcing himself into an assertion of confidence he certainly did not agree with at the end of #28\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #24 19). There is even a ring of self-hatred in his “all he has to do is lean his back on his stupid gargoyle and watch” since we know how much his inability to take action pains him. His final statement about caring only about the city, not about Batman, rings true (at least to King’s version of the character) while also demonstrating just how desperate he has grown that he would so passionately decry his own alter ego\n\n(15). Throughout his speech, Bruce Wayne lambastes Batman; whether his individual points are strictly accurate doesn’t matter what matters is that Bruce gets to vent on his own alter ego as part of the problem, hating and uplifting himself in the same breath as he deals with the guilt of the war and his arrogant belief that he’s the only one who can end it. I also want to note, although I want to do it delicately, that Bruce is not so detached from Batman as he claims. He is not, after all, simply willing to give himself up\n\n(20). I obviously don’t think he’s wrong for being unwilling to die (or not even unwilling to die, because he would, but unwilling to consent to being killed) in a way that probably wouldn’t even really end the violence. I just think that’s an important stipulation to augment the discussion of how detached from Batman/desperate to solve this problem he is.\n\nThe villains carrying on this fixation with alter egos is the most interesting they’ve been during this arc. I mean, we still have the same excess and quirks that annoyed me earlier in the run, but Riddler’s deconstruction of Joker is fascinating\n\n(12). There’s no way to know if he’s right or not, Joker’s origin is too nebulous, but it doesn’t really matter. What Riddler does know is that his words will get under Joker’s skin, which is its own kind of understanding. I’ve never bought the whole “two sides of the same coin” or “foils” or “order vs. chaos” or whatever kind of arguments have been made to explain why the relationship between Batman and Joker is special. Frankly, I don’t think it is. Batman has elements of both horror and absurdity in its metanarrative; Joker is its most flexible villain, easily a genuine clown and a terrifying one. So, he has maintained the most popularity and prominence in the Batman mythology. But the relationship between the two characters has never been more meaningful or complex than the most formulaic of archenemies—fueled mostly by unexplained obsession. Still, I cannot deny that there is something to Bruce poking holes in his own ego by denouncing aspects of the in-universe Batman myth in the same issue that Riddler attempts to demolish Joker’s ego by ridiculing the Joker myth. All three of these men have pushed their conception of their identities into an exaggerated alter ego. The heart of this clash is an attempt to destroy those alter egos. Riddler and Joker through murder, Bruce by arresting/stopping them. Although none of them are succeeding in their methods, they are destroying these alter egos incidentally simply through their clashes. Bruce by enforcing Joker and Riddler’s inability to emotionally access their core gimmick. Joker and Riddler by filling Bruce with guilt over their war. Ultimately, this becomes a story about the fragility of identity, and Riddler spells that out for Joker in this sequence.\n\nIn this ego-centric framing, I find Joker’s argument for why he deserves to kill Batman less annoying\n\n(13). Initially, I felt this was the text forgetting the whole framing of the arc. This is simply too early in Batman’s history for Joker’s statement to carry any weight. The whole fact of The War of Jokes and Riddles indicates that, at this point, Joker and Riddler are both in contention for the title of Batman’s archenemy. I thought Joker’s statement felt more like a flash-forward than a viable argument. I didn’t think it was out of character for Joker to be so arrogant, but I thought the text gave his argument a weight it didn’t deserve. However, if I consider the entire dinner to be about negotiating the myth of the alter ego, then I can take the weight this sequence is given as being driven by what the issue is trying to say.\n\nI find the art in this issue largely uninteresting. It serves the story well, but I wasn’t overly struck by anything it was doing. The only exception is, unfortunately, a mixed bag. I think the grayscale flashbacks and flash-forwards generally work pretty well\n\n(5). The coloration serves to quickly clue the audience in on what’s happening while also emphasizing the emotional bleakness of these moments. Mostly, they are also simple enough to serve more as emphasis for what the characters are saying than as new information. However, I find this panel a little confusing\n\n(9). The most logical explanation based on the other flashbacks is that this panel is simply demonstrating the link between Bruce and Gordon. I could see reading it as a deception, though. If Gordon is aware of Bruce’s plan tonight, then the flashback points to Bruce’s ongoing deception of his dinner guests. It isn’t a significant problem for the text, especially since Gordon’s awareness or lack thereof may eventually be verified, but I did want to point out the potential dual interpretation.\n\nThere’s a connection here that I’m failing to make between guilt and the alter ego. Something about how the Batman myth Bruce forces his identity into is inherently more powerful and capable than Bruce as a human being, and because he’s invested so much of his sense of self into said myth, he bears the guilt of failing to actually be that mythic figure. Maybe? There’s a ways to go yet in War of Jokes and Riddles, so I’m hoping to get more of a chance to explore that idea. If I succeed, this project may actually manage to turn around my overall opinion on the arc (but isn’t that always the way, the more attention you pay to something, the more meaning you find or infuse in it, the more you love it).\n\nQuestion:\n\nI thought about trying to explore what, if any, symbolic significance the different courses had. But that’s way more external research than I intend to do for this project. If anyone else has any thoughts, I’d be thrilled to hear them!\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel.

Cowles, Clayton. “The War of Jokes & Riddles, Part 4.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 29, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nI tend to have a strong negative reaction to the use of the word “filler” in reference to fiction. While it is occasionally appropriate (when something negatively impacts the pacing of a story), I think the term is wildly overused. Sometimes it feels like “filler” is used to describe any part of the story that doesn’t move the main plot along. Even if whatever is being dismissed as filler serves as an important piece of character work, b-plot progression, mood/tone development, or otherwise valuable storytelling. Batman Vol. 3 #28 straddles the line for me on filler vs. mood development. It definitely doesn’t add anything in terms of plot, and I don’t think it does much with character or theme either. I wouldn’t get mad at someone who does dismiss this issue as filler (as long as they aren’t overusing the word elsewhere). That said, for me, this moment makes the whole issue worthwhile\n\n(17). We already know that exploring Bruce’s guilt, plus his willingness to share that guilt with Selina, is the primary purpose of The War of Jokes and Riddles. His breakdown here might be more visceral than his detailed profiles of the conflict’s victims, but it isn’t new. What is new is his emphasis on time. And realizing that puts the stagnancy of the whole issue in a fresh light. Having a whole issue in which the status quo doesn’t change at all gives the audience a glimpse into how time during this fight dragged on for Bruce. He watched helplessly from the sidelines, unable to impact any change for weeks. The breakdown also makes the intercut timeline of Gordon’s trips into the contested zone at the beginning feel like a meaningful demonstration of time instead of a neat art trick\n\n(2). If we are really going to understand Bruce’s emotional life, including his guilt, we have to understand how long he felt so deeply powerless. And for me, this breakdown helps the issue share that feeling with the audience.\n\nThe other significant moment is the final revelation of Deadshot’s condition\n\n(20). After understanding how taxing this conflict has been for Bruce, we begin to see its impact on his psyche. Unlike the breakdown, I don’t think this is actually a valuable piece of storytelling. It foreshadows Bruce’s near murder of Riddler at the end of the arc, but we already know Bruce is a violent vigilante who comes close to crossing the line sometimes. Hearing that he almost killed Deadshot is only a revelation for the readers most lost in the fantasy that Bruce’s brutal beatdowns of his enemies don’t do meaningful damage. It matters to the structure of the arc to have some foreshadowing, and it isn’t a bad moment, but I don’t think it has the same revelatory feel that understanding the pace of the war does. The audience doesn’t need it the way we need to understand Bruce’s experience of time, and so it doesn’t do anything to alleviate the feeling that the issue is filler the way Bruce’s breakdown does.\n\nAlso somewhat valuable, but not enough to justify the existence of this separate issue on its own, is Selina’s presence in the story. The entire framing device of The War of Jokes and Riddles is Bruce telling this story to Selina. And for the first time, she interjects into his narration\n\n(8). The interjection mostly gives Bruce and Selina a chance to have some cute, flirtatious banter, but it also emphasizes how different their perspectives are\n\n(9). They are indulging in the same familiar debates because they still understand the world very differently. We also see that very little about their relationship has actually changed. They know each other a bit better and trust each other a bit more, but they always understood each other. Selina knew Bruce would worry\n\n(11), even if he didn’t mean to. And Bruce knew Selina would take care of herself, even if she did so through means he disapproved of\n\n(11).\n\nThe stagnancy of this issue is mitigated by its massive action set pieces. I don’t think the fight between Deathstroke and Deadshot is terribly interesting, but it does feature one incredible page\n\n(13). This sequence gives a potentially boring gun battle a sense of tension and momentum as we follow the bullets themselves. And this single moment is exciting enough to carry the montage of the rest of their fight by making the audience understand how these two legendary assassins compare and how they might approach taking each other down\n\n(17).\n\nThere is one aspect of this issue that I was completely unhappy with. At first, Gordon’s response to Bruce’s speech about the two of them “catching” Gotham feels like a critique of Bruce’s arrogance\n\n(1). I talked during I am Gotham and I am Suicide about the complexities of Bruce’s desire to assert his ownership over Gotham, which Bruce’s speech feels like one of the more positive iterations of. But even at its best, this impulse is an unbelievably arrogant one. Gordon rolling his eyes and ignoring Batman’s advice feels like a way of demonstrating the danger of Bruce’s attitude even at its most heroic. However, by the end of the issue, Gordon is parroting Bruce’s words back to him\n\n(20). Failing to criticize Bruce’s arrogance is not necessarily a flaw in a Batman story. In fact, for better or worse, much of the Batman mythology trades on increasing and affirming Bruce’s arrogance. That said, like Bruce’s failure to take any responsibility for the death of Kite Man’s son, featuring an aborted attempt to critique Bruce’s arrogance in a story predominantly focused on his guilt muddies the waters around the arc’s core thesis. To be fair, I think the intention of the text is to shift the criticism from Gordon to Bruce himself. When Gordon repeats Bruce’s opening line, Bruce doesn’t respond\n\n(20). He is still thinking about his failure to subdue Deadshot without risking fatal injury. Gordon is affirming Bruce’s arrogance just as Bruce is beginning to doubt whether he can actually catch Gotham. For me, though, because that arrogance is so central to the Batman mythology, I just think the whole thing fails. Bruce can’t effectively critique his own arrogance without fundamentally changing as a character, which this arc is not suggesting he does. So we’re left with two separate failed critiques of Bruce’s arrogance without any substantial acknowledgment of how Bruce’s arrogance creates guilt (either by being the reason he fails or by making him feel more responsibility than he bears).\n\nThis last topic isn’t an especially notable part of the issue, nor is it one I typically find terribly valuable to discuss, but I found that the incredibly odd way DC always structures the superhero power dynamics of Gotham particularly caught my eye here. Joker and Riddler each lead teams full of super-powered individuals, despite neither of them having any meta-human abilities (that we know of, I’m very married to my personal headcanon that Joker is actually immortal) or really being in any way impressive beyond their weird gimmicks and callousness. Selina, also a relatively normal crook, is apparently the only criminal in the whole city capable of staying out of the conflict and dodging Riddler and Joker’s violent recruitment drives\n\n(8). Again, I want to emphasize, we see Deathstroke on Riddler’s side\n\n(5) and Mr. Freeze on Joker’s\n\n(4), but somehow Selina is the only free agent. And then, of course, Batman and Gordon are far more capable than two special forces units\n\n(19). Batman, somehow being able to simultaneously take down Deathstroke and Deadshot despite his inexperience, barely registers when considered in this context\n\n(18). I’m not saying any of this is bad, by the way. As I’ve said before, attempting to reduce superhero conflicts to a numbers game is only ever detrimental to the storytelling, but I do think the prevalence of this trend in Batman stories in particular is notable. In your average Batman story, quantifiable power of any kind doesn’t really matter in the face of creativity, determination, and willpower. And that is especially true in an issue like Batman Vol. 3 #28.\n\nWhile the order I went in here was pretty traditional in terms of my paragraph structure for these essays, I can’t help but worry I might have given off the impression that I overall don’t like the issue. That’s not true. The best part of the issue is just also the most interesting part of the issue, so I talked about it first. I think Batman Vol. 3 #28’s use of time is great; I’m feeling better than ever about discussing The War of Jokes and Riddles, and I’m excited for #29.\n\nNext\n\nQuestion:\n\nThere’s some kind of artistic parallel here, but I can’t figure it out\n\n(10). My instinct is that their reversed positions of standing and sitting along with the distance between them indicate how, despite surface-level changes, the core of their relationship is the same as it always was. But that interpretation feels like a bit of a stretch. What do you think?\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June. Cowles, Clayton. “The War of Jokes & Riddles, Part Three.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 28, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nFor the last two essays, I’ve mostly been complaining about this arc, but I do actually like the Kite-Man interludes. As standalone issues anyway. I feel less certain about how they fit into the thesis of the overarching run. I’ll come back to that concern after having a chance to consider the second interlude. For now, I am content to indulge in my overall enjoyment and basically treat Batman Vol. 3 #27 as a standalone. There is nothing groundbreaking about Kite-Man’s story. A less-than-stellar father gets caught up in events far outside the scope of his capabilities, and this involvement with the malicious powerful ends up costing his child\n\n(17) or setting him on a new path of empowerment\n\n(20) (in this case, both). It skirts the edge of a cliche, especially with scenes like this one\n\n(6). The story of an individual taking on the powerful forces that dictate the world all for the love of a child. But there’s nothing new under the sun, and a common story told well is far more compelling than an innovative tale poorly communicated. Plus, Batman Vol. 3 #27 does offer some opportunities to reflect on how it feels to be powerless in the face of the social and political forces that rule our world. Kite-Man’s opening speech about wind serves the dual purpose of presenting a metaphor for what it feels like to be buffeted by the great forces of the world and showing the character details that make his fixation on kites feel natural\n\n(1). The news pundits that appear throughout the issue serve to both effectively tell the story of the Gotham Kite-Man lives in and echo the role cable news has come to play in the political battles of real life\n\n(19). Choosing a small-time criminal in Gotham to explore the powerlessness and alienation many real people have felt regarding political life over the last decades (or longer) feels far more apt than trying to use Batman to tell that story. And Kite-Man’s ultimate choice to join the Joker is a, perhaps obvious, but compelling metaphor for the pressure the many Americans (and I assume people around the world) feel to continue to prop up systems that inevitably harm them.\n\nStepping away from Bruce’s perspective also allows the story to take a different approach to the action scenes that are an essential (if occasionally wearying) aspect of superhero comics. Kite-Man really only participates in one major battle scene, and his participation amounts to Joker dragging him away from a battle he didn’t intend to be caught in the middle of\n\n(10-11). Showing the devastation these battles cause mostly through news stories counter-intuitively makes the destruction more impactful\n\n(14). When seen through the eyes of the participants, the audience’s focus is on the survival/goals of our beloved characters, and whatever destruction occurs is mostly forgotten when the story moves on. The newscast forcibly reminds the audience that there is both an emotional and economic cost to the burned buildings, ripped-up streets, and destroyed cars. Even if that cost is ultimately worthwhile, it cannot be ignored. Obviously, it also fits thematically since the average person is rarely present for historic moments, and even if they are, they are typically on the fringes.\n\nUnfortunately, Batman Vol. 3 #27 isn’t totally free of the problems of The War of Jokes and Riddles. Riddler’s shirt opened to his navel to show off his question mark is more laugh-inducing than anything\n\n(8), which stinks in a scene that should at least be tense, if not scary. Joker fares better, mostly by virtue of having a few scenes that are both genuinely and intentionally funny\n\n(12)\n\n(20). Although, personally, I found his fake bomb brought my annoyance with the character back in full force\n\n(13). (To be fair, I can at least understand how this scene might work for some readers, which is more than I can say for #25 and #26.) In the previous issues, the problems with the villains have worked to undercut what appears to be the arc’s central purpose: exploring Bruce’s guilt. Although this issue suffers less from the villain problem, it also further damages the arc’s attempts to explore guilt. Bruce gets Kite-Man involved in the conflict\n\n(2). He forces Kite-Man to engage with Joker\n\n(4). Yet, he expresses no personal remorse over the death of Kite-Man’s son, only self-serving assertions about a “vengeance” he was already pursuing\n\n(19). He assured Kite-Man of his ability to keep Charlie safe\n\n(13), failed to live up to that assurance, and doesn’t even offer the most basic “sorry for your loss” apology. Now, obviously, we don’t get Bruce’s point of view in any way. His demonstrated memory of the personal details about Falcone’s murdered enforcers is probably enough for the audience to assume Bruce feels guilty\n\n(Batman Vol. 3 #26 19). However, this run’s commitment to sitting with Bruce’s emotions is its chief selling point. If this run accomplishes anything, it is forcing the audience to engage with Bruce as more human than symbol. To demand inference now is to undercut that accomplishment, at least a little.\n\nI was very critical of the art in this arc during my last essay, and I stand by those criticisms. However, since this issue has a very different tone than the rest of the arc, I find it less problematic here. There are even a few artistic moments I found intriguing. Keeping Bruce either mostly out of frame\n\n(4) or mostly in shadow\n\n(1) until Kite-Man asserts himself regarding the safety of his son is wonderful\n\n(13). It presents Bruce as this force of nature (which ties in beautifully with Batman Vol. 3 #23), pushing Kite-Man into the fray. His power is too much for Kite-Man to fully see, never mind counter. Only when Kite-Man is desperate enough to make a request of Batman—that he ensure the safety of Kite-Man’s son—does Batman come into frame as a person. And even then, he’s still mostly in shadow until Kite-Man reaches his breaking point and starts making demands\n\n(16). The other visual I find particularly compelling is the emptying bar. This visual motif is simultaneously effective for communicating details about the plot and emphasizing Kite-Man’s struggles. On a plot level, the initial emptying of the bar demonstrates how the patrons of the kind of bar Kite-Man frequents see the entrance of Batman as a threat\n\n(1). A reason to clear out instead of calmly continuing their revels or taking out their phones to take pictures of “The Batman.” The later, almost completely empty bar speaks to the impact of the war between Joker and Riddler\n\n(9). The criminals who frequent the place have likely chosen a side. Everyone else is probably hiding at home. From an emotional standpoint, the emptying of the bar indicates how alone Kite-Man feels against these powerful men batting him around to serve their own agendas.\n\nI did find one joke to be of middling interest. Joker’s joke/riddle about copycats does vaguely acknowledge the influence Joker as a concept has over Batman’s rogues gallery\n\n(5). And the influence Joker as a fictional entity has over that same group of characters. After all, the majority of the villains active in Gotham are participating in this war between Joker and Riddler. And there is some evidence to suggest that Riddler’s pitch to get people to participate is primarily about Joker\n\n(9). His influence as a concept is more nebulous. Tracing his impact through comics would be a massive undertaking that I’m not going to attempt for the sake of some half-decent meta-commentary in an unfunny joke (although someone should, it would be fascinating). In broad strokes, while it wouldn’t quite be accurate to call him the model for all Batman villains that came after him, Joker was one of the earliest concrete steps toward supervillainy to appear in Batman comics. And his outsized fame in popular culture is part of what keeps Batman and his rogues gallery relevant to a non-comics audience.\n\nThis felt good to write. It felt closer to an actual essay than the previous two, absolutely, but maybe even closer than the last five or six. I feel like, in trying to take on the whole run in such small chunks, I’ve lost sight of what makes the run exciting: what the story is trying to say. Hopefully, in addition to being fun to write, this essay will bring me back to that going forward.\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June.

This makes sense—as I have said frequently, the interconnected universe and negotiations of canon are what draw me to superhero comics. However, the questionable canonicity of the story’s contents isn’t the only thing that makes a narrative device like this interesting. This panel sequence beautifully reminded me of this fact\n\n(1). The marriage between the narration and the gunshots felt, to me, like a stark reminder that Bruce is telling this story. And I found myself wondering whose imagination we were in. Did Bruce imagine the three gunshots as he was recalling the Templeton children? Or did Selina add them to her imagining of the scene after Bruce mentioned the three children? Or is the visual storytelling of the comic detached from Bruce’s narration such that the images are only for the audience (and perhaps less unreliable than the narration)? I don’t have an answer to this question, nor am I certain I’ll find one, but I want to keep an eye on how the narration and art relate to each other. I might find my answer somewhere as unexpected as the inspiration I found to look for it. And if I don’t find a clear answer, keeping in mind the variety of supportable interpretations of this relationship will be both a necessary acknowledgment of the nuances of the text and, hopefully, a way to keep myself engaged with a story that otherwise doesn’t work that well for me. For example, I found myself enjoying this description of Dr. Knowles in part because I imagined Bruce throwing in this detail about the cat mainly for Selina’s enjoyment\n\n(3).\n\nAnd I’m going to need things to enjoy over the rest of this arc because, unfortunately, the Riddler and Joker stuff hasn’t gotten any better for me. I feel uncomfortable using the word “edgy” because it feels judgemental and a little nebulous, but I’m not sure I can come up with a better word to describe this sequence\n\n(4) (he might be just drawing the question mark in Knowles’s blood and not cutting it into himself, I can’t tell, but that’s barely any better). And this is Riddler, a character that, throughout Batman history, has rarely managed to be dark or scary, even coming off Zero Year. It is just too much, and it jars me out of my investment in the story. I feel similarly about Carmine Falcone being this afraid of the Joker so early in Batman’s career\n\n(7). Tynion’s currently running Joker Vol. 2 can get away with hardened criminals being terrified of Joker, but this is just too early for him to have this level of impact. (I don’t love this as an origin for Penguin either\n\n(14), but that can’t entirely be blamed on this run.) The over-the-top depiction of the main villains also filters into the descriptions of the side characters. Falcone’s mother is the worst example\n\n(15). Her story might have been impactful had it appeared as part of another comic, but here a phrase like “her father beat the child out of her” feels more connected to the Riddler carving a question mark into his chest than to any kind of emotional human tragedy. I mentioned the art as helping Riddler in Batman Vol. 3 #25, but the more I consider the art overall in this run, the more I think it damages the overall story\n\n(13). The art is so bright and is generally typical of superhero comics that it doesn’t do the edginess of the material any favors. Something in a more atmospheric style (like the work of Kelley Jones or Alex Maleev) might have made the excessiveness of the villains feel more impactful and less ridiculous.\n\nAnd again, I found that the exhausting nature of the villains’ depictions undercut the work the issue tried to do for Bruce’s characterization. The focus of the issue is Bruce’s guilt over the lives lost as a result of the Joker and Riddler’s conflict\n\n(19). As he tells this story to Selina, he makes sure to include the personal details he researched concerning many victims of the first wave of violence between Joker and Riddler\n\n(12). Bruce’s guilt is a central part of War of Jokes and Riddles. Him telling this story to Selina is a confession. It should matter that, even after all these years, he remembers small details about those that were murdered. It should be especially impactful because it puts in conversation two semi-conflicting core aspects of the Batman mythology. Bruce’s “criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot” has always shown how easy Bruce finds it to dehumanize those who don’t act in accordance with his morality. He simplifies their motives and disregards their character in favor of fitting them into a mold of “criminality” that is comfortable for him. However, he also refuses to take a life. He sees all life, including the lives of the worst criminals, as having enough inherent value that he cannot take one even under the most extreme circumstances. So his reflection on the humanity of the criminals murdered due to what he views as his own personal failure forces him to contend with why he values their lives. It forces him to consider why they pursued a life of crime and what those lives meant to the people living them\n\n(12). Unfortunately, the context of the over-the-top supervillain melodrama calls attention to how melodramatic Bruce’s thought process is and diminishes the impact of both his guilt and his empathy. For me, at least.\n\nThere is one villain in this book I enjoyed, but I think that has more to do with how much I love Poison Ivy than it does with her appearance in the book. Her walking through the park casually murdering everyone Falcone sent against Riddler is a fun scene for anyone who likes her character\n\n(10). However, her position in the actual story doesn’t add much yet beyond showing the scope of the fight. I know Ivy will play a larger role in the overall arc, but I’m not sure that packing in so many major villain “origins” into one story is really in service of any of those characters. Giving them their own space to flourish and their own stories about their histories will almost always allow for more compelling and engaging stories to be told about these characters. Ivy gets involved in the fight mostly because she is attacked while she is with Riddler\n\n(9). Riddler makes the case that Ivy cannot avoid being involved because the Joker will draw the whole city, including the parks, into the war zone\n\n(8), which may well be true, but she doesn’t really get to make her own decision. The story isn’t about Ivy; it is about Joker, Riddler, and Bruce. So her motives aren’t treated as important character beats for the text to consider.\n\nI also found some enjoyment in this riddle\n\n(4), but my delight had little to do with the riddle itself. When I started the last issue, I thought I was going to spend a lot of time on the content of the jokes and riddles, but I’ve honestly found them all painfully dull and obvious. This one holds some interest in that it alludes both to Riddler’s existential crisis and his murder of Dr. Knowles just by being such an angsty riddle, but that reading doesn’t tell us much that isn’t obvious on the page without the riddle. And Riddler’s existential crisis remains among the worst parts of this arc. However, due to some of my other reading, this riddle did strike something in me. I am generally against spoiler warnings on principle, but I can understand if you didn’t come into an essay on Batman Vol. 3 #26 expecting spoilers for a dark and challenging spy novel about the Vietnam War. So I will offer a spoiler warning for the novel The Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen (an excellent book which I highly recommend). One of the key revelations in the novel hinges on the potential dual meaning of “nothing” when applied to value statements. If one values nothing more than freedom, they could be interpreted to value freedom above all else or even the very concept of nothingness more than they value freedom. Riddler’s riddle is not playing with that dual meaning. The component “what does the misner spend and the spendthrift save?” alone rules out that potential interpretation. However, when applied to “what does man love more than life?” the dual meaning of “nothing” allows for what could perhaps be a more intellectually honest depiction of Riddler’s emotional crisis than “riddles have lost their excitement.” Riddler is struggling with the purpose of his life and his place in the world. It is a fairly common struggle, and one easily understood, framing it in the ridiculous trapping of riddles may have worked if the execution was better, but with the execution War of Jokes and Riddles has, I wish it had just gone for a more simple and straightforward depiction.\n\nI still feel more like I’m writing a negative review than an essay, but maybe that’s ok. I think I lost sight of what this project was actually trying to communicate a while ago. Maybe it can just be about me talking about which parts of the issue I found interesting and why. Maybe that’s all it ever was.\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June. Cowles, Clayton. “The War of Jokes & Riddles, Part Two.” Batman, vol. 3, no. 26, DC Comics, 2017.\n\nFirst – Previous\n\nOn my first read-through of this run, The War of Jokes and Riddles was the one arc I didn’t really like. I didn’t hate it. I just found it bland and mediocre. It happens more often than not in an industry that churns out as many stories as quickly as the comic industry. Unfortunately, I think I brought some of my disappointment with the arc into my re-read. My notes are filled with words like “annoying” and “dumb.” I’ll try to do better next time—maybe come into the issue in a better mood—but for Batman Vol. 3 #25, I’ll have to work with what I’ve got.\n\nPart of the problem is that this issue features very little Bruce. Instead, it mostly sets up Joker and Riddler as villains. And, personally, I’ve never been a huge fan of either. Attempts to make Joker unsettling or terrifying so often tip over into a kind of eye-rolling excess that is more exhausting than scary. For me—and again, this is extremely subjective—King’s Joker in Batman Vol. 3 #25 falls into this trap\n\n(3). Riddler fares slightly better, helped by some genuinely exciting artistic moments\n\n(11). His assisting the police may be a cliche, but it felt to me like a nod to his pre-Flashpoint career as a morally neutral private detective, which was a far more exciting direction for his character. Still, most attempts to put Riddler and Joker on the same level as villains feel hollow, and my exhaustion with Joker in this issue ends up making it feel more hollow and not less\n\n(22).\n\nThere is an attempt to bring the same meditative empathy that the run has worked to offer Batman to Joker and Riddler. Instead of them both just wanting to kill Batman, they each feel as though Batman’s presence in Gotham has given them some kind of existential crisis\n\n(22). While the run has had a great deal of success embracing the ridiculousness of Batman as a source of existential angst, the same trick doesn’t work here. We understand the very real tragedies that feed into Bruce’s ridiculousness, and we are able to place those tragedies in the context of the DC Universe to understand how that ridiculousness allows Bruce to flourish. We don’t have any personal context for Joker or Riddler. And even the setting to the DC Universe isn’t particularly helpful when we have no empathy to serve as a starting point. The attempt to explain Joker and Riddler’s motivation as having some greater emotional depth not only fails but makes the reader less sympathetic to Bruce as it cheapens the emotional depth that the run has worked so hard to access for him.\n\nWhat little we do get of Bruce in this issue is mostly compelling: him wallowing in guilt\n\n(26). Despite providing the narration, he really doesn’t have much else to do. The guilt is interesting. It speaks to the incredibly high standard Bruce holds himself to. And to the size of his ego to believe that he should have been able to handle two super-criminals entirely on his own without a problem so early in his career. In fact, the ego aspect proves even more fascinating when Bruce confesses that he imagined the good weather in Gotham was an omen, that somehow nature itself was telling him his first year as Batman had been a success\n\n(8). Neither his guilt nor his ego is a surprise, even without any context beyond the run. We have seen the impossible standard he has for himself, the scope of his hopes for Gotham, and his conviction that only he can do what needs to be done, but we have yet to see them play out this way. Throughout the run, when confronted with failure, Bruce has done whatever he could to correct it. Clearly, even all these years later, he is struggling to cope with a failure he felt unable to correct. This guilt also offers a new connection with Selina, as her guilt over Holly’s actions has informed much of her behavior over the course of the run.\n\nUnfortunately, all the intriguing character stuff is undercut by the presentation of the dialogue on the last page\n\n(28). I have never been among the critics of King’s dialogue. In fact, I have vocally praised it. Sure, he doesn’t write the way real people talk, but very few writers do. The ellipses, repetition, and stilted conversation are there to invite readers into the character’s thought processes. To see their hesitation, uncertainties, fixations, and communication problems. However, the final moments of the last page are so clearly about introducing the story (and emphasizing its gravity) to the reader that it undercuts what should have been the most genuinely emotional page of the issue. In theory, Selina serving as a surrogate for the audience should alleviate some of that awkwardness, but it doesn’t. First, because “war of jokes and riddles” is such an objectively silly phrase and only works if you’re talking about a title, not just telling a story to a loved one. Furthermore, Selina would know at least some of this history. She was there for a lot of Joker and Riddler tearing up the city in a war. So the page feels so directed at the readership that it breaks the immersion. This is not necessarily a fault, lots of good writing intentionally breaks audience immersion, but this page is supposed to be Bruce’s emotional private confession to Selina— it doesn’t work here.\n\nOne final complaint, I am deeply uncomfortable with the “Riddler walks out of Blackgate” scene\n\n(12). It is arguably the best scene in the comic, but I can’t shake the misogynistic tinge to it. The optics of Riddler listing only stereotypically female names as he walks out of prison were never great. Given that prison guards are mostly (or perhaps entirely) male, they get even worse. Ostensibly, the text justifies it by saying that the guard Riddler got his information from was using the money for his daughter’s college fund, so Riddler lists all the daughters, but it would have had the exact same resonance to list their children generally. Not one of these guards has a son they love? The entire scene reads as strong men being forced to make poor choices to protect defenseless women—a sentiment so steeped in misogynistic gender roles it is hard to read.\n\nWriting this felt more like writing a negative review than anything else. I hope I managed to say at least something interesting about the content of the issue. I promise to do better next time.\n\nQuestion:\n\nAm I missing anything exciting in approaching this issue with a sour attitude?\n\nNext\n\nBibliography:\n\nKing, Tom. Janín, Mikel. Chung, June.
