        "text": "I once met Colm Tóibín and asked if living in Spain helped with writing Homage to Barcelona. No, he said, there are so many problems in the world that the last thing people need is a writer complain he can’t write. Give me a pair of headphones, he said and pointed at a table in the corner of the auditorium, I’ll sit there and work.\n\nSo I have sat and worked on the trains, in moving cars, at long communal tables in busy libraries, at picnic benches in the parks, on the patios, in cafes. This was before I realized that I fall in love easily and have been avoiding crowded places since.\n\nFor a while, I slept in a small bedless room at my parents’ house. In the morning, I would fold and put away the thin mattress and the pillow, pull the low Japanese table, and wait for the words or my two-year-old niece, whichever arrived first. That room was good for writing. I was happy, had my books, very strong coffee, and a window that brought light.\n\nNow I write at an island table in a spacious kitchen. This, by the way, has nothing to do with what Rabelais said about Homer, who supposedly never wrote on an empty stomach; I sit here because I like that ancient yeasty smell filling the ashpazkhana when the ravenous fungus feed on the sugar in the flour. Aside from the invention of fire and language, no two things, I believe, have played a bigger part in man’s survival than bread and stories. So the sourdough rises and demands to be baked. And I stand by the pre-heated oven about to participate in the simple act of lurching our species fate forward into the great unknown.\n\nThe kitchen is also the best place to procrastinate.\n\nI keep some plants close by as if hearing them grow will help the sentences take shape in my head. But the plants need watering. I water them. I reach for the knife while a character considers making a scene. But I allow him to take his time. I mince garlic, chop onion, sauté the beef until brown on all sides, add paprika, salt, cumin, sumac, some garam masala. I let it simmer. I refill the spice jars, wipe the counter, vacuum the coffee grounds, do the dishes. And when every surface sparkles like fresh snow on a sunny day, I know I haven’t been writing but I can hear the music in the words whispering in my ears.\n\nAnd that is as good as writing.\n\nI am packing up the house where I have lived for the past twelve years—where I wrote my dissertation, had my son, published my first short story, spent the last days of my cat’s life—and\n\nall around me are half-filled boxes of what my now six-year-old son calls “all our precious things.” We do not know where we will be next year, so we have decided to make things simpler for ourselves by unpacking only a fraction of these boxes when we wake up in our new but temporary home in two weeks. I have promised my family that only two or three boxes of my books will be among those we unpack. This promise was possibly a mistake. This promise is definitely the reason I sit here writing this blog post instead of filling, sealing, and labelling the boxes surrounding me. I have decided to use this post to contrive a plan for packing my books.\n\nFor a long time, I listened to music while I read, thought, and wrote—sometimes classical music, yes, but generally any music that stirred up some kind of weather in me. Then, all of a sudden, I wanted only silence. There are probably a few explanations for this shift, but I like to think that one of these is that silence better allows me to hear the books around me talking. If I have had some wine and allowed myself to become extravagant, I imagine I am hosting a salon of my favourite writers—or at least some mad, messy, Sandhyaesque rendering of such a thing.\n\nSo, my plan is this: I will make a guest list for a year-long mental salon; it is those voices that I want to hear in 2023 that I will unpack next month.\n\nFirst, there are the voices I always want to hear—Jean Rhys, Carson McCullers, Clarice Lispector, Muriel Spark, Barbara Comyns, Tove Ditlevsen—even if they’re grumbling loudly from another room in the back of the house while I welcome my other, rather more alive, guests.\n\nAlso in that room, if they don’t mind the ghosts, are Lydia Davis, Deborah Eisenberg, and Diane Williams, as well as Ottessa Moshfegh and Kate Zambreno, and all the other writers whose oeuvres I began to work my way through while living in this house, including Sigrid Nunez and Joanna Walsh.\n\nThe novelists, short story writers, essayists, philosophers, poets, and memoirists mingle in my mind: laughing, listening, objecting, occasionally throwing a drink. Samanta Schweblin stands coolly by the window with Chloe Aridjis, as well as Grace Paley and Jenny Diski, who have floated out from the back room for some fresh air and fresh gossip. Lauren Elkin, Heidi Julavits,\n\nDeborah Levy, Sarah Manguso, and Lisa Robertson arrive at the same time, allow me to take their impossibly stylish coats, and strike up several long and dynamic conversations, snippets of\n\nwhich I try to overhear, with Natasha Brown, Alexander Chee, Danielle Evans, Cathy Park Hong, Mira Jacob, ZZ Packer, and Claudia Rankine. A thoughtful Claire-Louise Bennett stands on her own by the table in the corner, and I suddenly worry that I have not paid close enough attention to the pattern on my wallpaper or the olives I have put out.\n\nStephen Darwall, my dissertation advisor, chats amiably about conflict and relationships with Sarah Schulman, while Kathryn Davis and Talia Lakshmi Kolluri talk about what it is like to be\n\na manticore.\n\nThe air is by now heady with ideas and imagination, and nearly spilling the wine in my glass, I rush to open the door for Chelene Knight and Shezan Muhammedi, both of whose family history, like mine, includes refugees from Idi Amin’s violent 1970’s expulsion of South Asians from Uganda. I have only just begun to let this conversation take place in my mind again, and these writers are among the first to invite me to join after the death of my dear dad.\n\nI will not be able to fit all these voices—all the moods, all the registers, all the volumes—inside two boxes. My family might roll their eyes, but I know they will not begrudge me my party.\n\nRight now I am reading “Shut Up You’re Pretty” by Téa Mutonji which is an interconnected collection of short stories about a young Congolese woman coming of age in Scarborough and\n\nToronto. I picked up this book because I live on the edge of Scarborough and I like experiencing characters who navigate physical spaces I am familiar with.\n\nI am enjoying the book in short bursts as the content is difficult to digest in one sitting. It is not gratuitous, it is just a careful telling of hard truths.\n\nI enjoy reading fiction in short story form but the downside of most collections is the frustration of losing the characters you have invested in at the end of each story. This book allows the\n\nreader to enjoy the best of both worlds as Loli, the protagonist, is central to each piece. I also tend to gravitate toward stories that are told simply and rely heavily on the character’s voice, and\n\nin these two aspects “Shut Up You’re Pretty” more than delivers. Even if the content of Loli’s life is not like my own, her analysis of the situations she encounters seems relatable, authentic,\n\nand intelligent.\n\nParadoxically, that is why I must read the book in short bursts. I am afraid for Loli and the various ways her world might consume her. I am afraid to consider myself in her position, knowing that my decisions would likely be similar if I were truly dropped into her world. But overall, this means that the book is accomplishing what I think it intends to, what I think all authors strive for; it does not simply tell the reader the story. It makes them feel it as if it is, however temporarily, their own life.\n\nKim Jernigan: The poem is in the form of a letter home from a soldier at Fort Henry, Kingston in 1837. Can you provide our readers with the historical context for the poem? I’m also interested in your choice of an epistolary form, a letter home from a man at war. It opens with the line “ask your husband about the honey bees…” which raises the question of what relationship the writer has to the addressee.\n\nHollay Ghadery: The poem is written from the perspective of a man imprisoned in Fort Henry during the Rebellion of 1837-38, when people in Upper and Lower Canada were getting frustrated with the lack of responsible government. They began to rebel against the Crown and the conservative minority who were in power at the time. One of the men who took part in the Rebellion was Joseph Gould—a man from Uxbridge, Ontario (the small town my family moved to when I was 11 years old). It is through his persona that I write the poem, though I make no claims on complete historical accuracy. “Rebellion Box” is a creative interpretation. The letter felt like an obvious choice for the form. I first heard of rebellion boxes during a lecture at the Uxbridge Museum by local historian Allan McGillivray, and he mentioned that men would often send these boxes home to their loved ones with little sayings written onto the box. And the boxes would sometimes be accompanied by letters. In the case of Gould, he wanted to write to his intended, Mary, but he was a Quaker and the propriety at the time meant he could not correspond directly with her. So, he wrote to Mary’s mother, and that is to whom it speaks. His letter starts formally, but slowly unravels so that it is as if, at points, he is talking directly to Mary.\n\nKim Jernigan: Can you also shed some light on the bee sting? What it suggests about the relationships\n\nin the poem, how, for instance, the being stung has both literal and figurative resonance?\n\nHollay Ghadery: The sting is meant to reflect how when the speaker is in pain (mental, physical, existential) or distressed, he turns his thoughts to the person he loves—Mary—and her simply existing brings him comfort. “But Mary was in blue, and it was something else to think about.”\n\nThe exact words Joseph Gould wrote on the box he sent home for Mary were this:\n\nWhen liberty with all its charms\n\nShall comfort the distressed\n\nThen I’ll return with open arms,\n\nAnd clasp you to my breast.\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that Mary and Joseph were married three months after his eventual release from prison.\n\nKim Jernigan: The speaker says “I won’t stand for futility.” Can you shed some light on what this means in the context of the poem? I’m also interested in some of the imagery you use. What, for instance, are “marzipan creek pebbles”?\n\nHollay Ghadery: A large group of rebels were arrested after a raucous meeting at Montgomery’s Tavern (which I believe used to be on Yonge Street in what is now Richmond Hill) and brought to Fort Henry, where many were tried and even executed for high treason. Gould was not only part of the rebellion, but he helped led it. He had very high ideals and hopes. In his writing, he quite literally spelt “liberty” with a capital L. Imprisonment must have made him feel impotent. But, in making the boxes (he also made one for this sister) and writing home, he was also planning for the future. He continued to fight against the futility of his circumstance and the system that was trying to break him. And yes! Those sweet little pebbles. I imagined the men in prison weren’t afforded a diverse or particularly tasty diet, so their favourite foods—perhaps favourite childhood foods—might slip into their memories. Remembering pebbles in a creek, those pebbles might begin to look very much like little balls of marzipan.\n\nKim Jernigan: Is the poem a one off or part of a longer sequence of poems? And on a more frivolous note, how have you spent the prize money?\n\nHollay Ghadery: This poem was written as a part of a series of poems that explore the lives of local historic figures. Lucy Maud Montogomery and Thomas Foster also have poems written for or after them in this series. All are in my poetry collection coming out in April with Radiant Press, also titled Rebellion Box. And the prize money! I’d like to switch my home from propane heating to geothermal in an effort to become less reliant on fossil fuels. The switch is expensive, so the money has been earmarked to go toward that. I don’t know if that’s very exciting but it brings me comfort!\n\nProbably because I come from a big family in a small house or because I’m an actor and well-versed at finding privacy in public, I can write almost anywhere. I do have three favourite places to write: the open road, hotel or motel rooms, diners or bars or pubs, and my workspace at home.\n\nThe open road: I hope that you appreciate that I keep my eyes on the road because, trust me, I pay for it later when attempting to decipher what I’ve written. It’s probably because my body and attention are otherwise engaged that I get a great deal of writing done on the open highway. I’ve learned to take quick notes of thoughts that will return more complete ideas to me later when I’m off the road. I almost always have a big legal pad or at least my notebook open with a pen handy when I’m on the highway. So so exhilarating and productive.\n\nHotel or motel rooms: there is something about the anonymity of the place. That there is nothing personal there. Nothing that reminds me of me that, paradoxically, allows me to access my own voice. As long as it’s clean and there’s a decent table or desk and chair, I can work there until the cows come home.\n\nDiners, food courts,, bars, pubs; TV/film sets: it’s that privacy in public thing. These places are usually quite busy. I prefer busy. Food courts are definite favourite writing places. It’s so much that I write on sets but before or after getting called to set to shoot. There’s something about the imminent interruption that is endlessly provocative. In other public places, I love to eavesdrop. If you want to learn how people speak, go to an emergency room. Usually, the worst day of people’s lives and wow are they deliberate in their speech. Not that I care what the content of a conversation is, I don’t really. It’s the incredible way that all of you construct your thoughts into sentences. Endlessly fascinating. Overhearing all of you has been and continues to be, so instructive. I did get busted once for eavesdropping and taking notes. On a New Jersey Transit train. I swore it was the people’s syntax that I was snatching but that did not prevent a flood of stink-eye from the eavesdropping police.\n\nMy own workspace at home: where do I start? Long before we left Los Angeles, my partner and me learned that I need my own space. I just do. I make a lot of noise. I listen to jazz, classical music, electronica, Weimar, chanson francaise. Or utter silence. I do dance breaks, push-ups. But mostly my attention is not drifting to others like my partner. In my current workroom, there are floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with fiction, poetry, plays, theory, reference books; a printer. I have a rocking reading chair we got a hundred years ago in Toronto from Ikea (I think). A cheap reading lamp with a very good bulb. A big Persian family heirloom rug that my partner lugged from Zimbabwe in his backpack for me. He had a day layover in Paris and the rug visited Pére Lachaise cemetery with him. He’d never been to the city before and watched the sunrise by Proust’s grave (where I have done sitting practice many times) with the rug on his back. It’s special. I also have my work desk and art-making table in the room. My work desk is where I am writing this and where I teach a number of writing classes and spend a lot of my time. I can see out the window here and watch the folks mosey by on our sleepy little street in our sleepy little-ish town. On the other wall is my art table. A few years ago, I began making sculpture poems built around medication bottles. In their small way, they speak volumes about what it’s like to live with HIV, trauma, and the rest. They seem to capture what I don’t think I ever could in words.\n\nThese spaces reflect what the constantly flowing and evolving river that writing is in my experience. I’m always slipping off the bank into the current and these spaces, even speeding down the highway or perched at a table in a public space, or here in my workspace. These sites are doorways that I enter.\n\nKim Jernigan: Can you tell us how the form of the poem came to you?\n\nCallista Markotich: In Fugue, a poem written in a recognized poetic form called a fugue, Saint Stephen marches around a dimmed room in ICU with a silent nurse, trailed by Wenceslas, my sister’s choir and my own jumble of thought and memory. It is Boxing Day, the official feast-day of this 2000-year-old canonized martyr, the reality of my sister’s dying a numb knot in the middle of me. The somewhat random personae in my poem loop round and round busily, paying only distracted attention to the fact of my lovely sister dying. Fugue – fugio. I flee. It was the perfect form.\n\nIn a musical fugue, the first melody is repeated, “chased” by variations. My sister and my brother are musicians. She was an organist and a choir director and a chorister. It is he who first noted that our sister died on the Feast of Stephen, also Boxing Day, also the day that Good King Wenceslas looked out, and, as we hear in song each Christmas, forged his charitable legacy. The concreteness of the comment stayed with me, a cognitive element to stir into a crucible of intolerable emotion, this indirect, almost by-the-way approach to the raw grief of losing a close sister, life-long playmate, confidante, friend. Here is where I must say that she had cancer, melanoma, but was holding her own with courage and grace and promising therapies when she developed pneumonia and died very quickly, unexpectedly, impossible to accept. Fugio. I fled.\n\nAnd, about a year later, I began to pull together my poem, Fugue, a fugue.\n\nKim Jernigan: Can you tell us something more of your loss and the consolation of poetry?\n\nCallista Markotich: So much poetry comes to my mind! I’ve always loved language, been moved by hyperbolic expressions of grief in religious poetry, the funereal works of De Profundis and Requiem, and drawn to heavy, profound language of grand despair in poetry like John Milton’s and Gerard Manley Hopkins. When my sister died, my relationship to poetry was still as a reader and listener .While I would never be capable of wielding this kind of linguistic power, hearing and reading the great stately language at my sister’s funeral in the readings and hymns and prayers was a validation of the vastness of my feelings – how deep the loss, how huge the void, how infinite the loneliness. That poetic language was a like a confirmation to me.\n\nIn a poetry retreat that spring, Lorna Crozier read us Donal Ogg. I cannot describe the sadness that inhabited me as I listened to her read this eighth century translation of an anonymous Irish poem, simple words in a girl’s voice full of love and yearning, desolation and fear. Yet I felt soothed. Is sorrow a balm for other sorrow? Perhaps it’s due to the universality we strive for in poetry, that which lets us know we are not alone in human moil.\n\nWhen I began to write poetry at this retreat, it was healing. Some of this I might attribute simply to time. It took time, filled time with meditative, sometimes introspective behaviors that herded my sense of upheaval into the disciplines of sitting down, concentrating, holding the din at bay, going inside in silence, seeking inwardness. And time, merely the passing of it, can be an agent that gently salves the soul.\n\nI didn’t come up with Fugue right away, but began to marshal my thoughts and look truthfully at the experience of seeing my sister slip away from me. I saw that I railed against it. I perceived my emotions repeating over and over: this can not be. But I could accept something cognitive, not tethered to emotion: it was Boxing day, it was the Feast of Stephen, there was a silent nurse in ICU. That was my Fugue. It consoled me, informed me, gave me a way to honour my sister’s memory.\n\nKim Jernigan: Are there poems you read around the time of your loss that helped you find the language for your grief?\n\nCallista Markotich: Someone gave me Selah by Norah Gould (Brick Books, 2016), a collection which narrates a partner’s advancing dementia and his death in language that is grounded in real experiences within a familial and community context, yet full of image and metaphor. Here were shocking recognitions of universal emotions around the loss of a loved one – dread, sorrow, even anger, understated or even unstated, but stirred, and stirring.\n\nI was reading Michael Crummy too, and found poems such as Morning, Labrador Coast and Cigarettes, which offer in grim, matter-of-fact language, stark environmental and cultural harshness, but nonetheless shine with daily courage, and love with its strange vagaries and deep connections. These poems seemed to put personal suffering in its place: pathos, self-pity, complaint, begone, be banished! Allow readers to find what they will.\n\nElizabeth Bishop’s One Art does this. Losses are marched forward through the inexorable rhyme and repetition of a villanelle. In the guise of ordinary, non-sentimental language, an anecdotal chat about losing things, losses emerge and escalate to a cumulative heartbreaking effect, the ultimate admission of disaster, the penultimate words (Write it!) standing in for a sob.\n\nKim Jernigan: Who are some of your own favourite Canadian poets and how did you find your way to them?\n\nCallista Markotich: Mercifully, my friend Rena Upitis is the founder of Wintergreen, an educational retreat center north of Kingston. I was still in a state of shock when, over coffee, she urged me to attend a poetry retreat in May to be led by Lorna Crozier. I was not writing poetry then, but I regularly do as Rena asks; she is that kind of friend. That was the beginning, if late, to a new chapter in my life. Lorna introduced so many Canadian poets, often reading their poems to us in her inimitable voice. With her unstinting encouragement I began to read and write, read and write. My dog-eared Nortons and well-thumbed old textbooks and collections of traditional poets was augmented by many collections of Canadian poets and many volumes of Canadian literary magazines, quarterlies and reviews. Besides Lorna, my generous teacher and mentor, I love Barry Dempster for his rich, dense poetry and I am thankful to him for his support of my early efforts, Michael Crummy for his gut wrenching/heartwarming poems about people and life, Laurie Graham for her sensitive forays into our fraught history. I am so grateful to the poetry of Louise Bernice Halfe, Poet Laurate, and Randy Lundy and other poets for letting me see and try to learn and feel my way forward in this era of truth and reconciliation. And there are many, many more favourite poets, including Susan Haldane, a poet who is a farm woman, and Carolyn Smart whose Careen is a collection of newspaper headlines and historical bits stitched together in poetry as befits the sensational, colloquial story of Bonnie and Clyde. My list expands gracefully, simply, naturally. I recently brought Bats, by your son Luke Hathaway, to my far-flung little poetry group (Covid, Zoom), and it became an instantly triangulated favourite – three remote sites, three poets loving the language, the images, the poem – conceive of each one singly if you can."
