The nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every fibre of our being, threads the heart, pierces the liver.”\n\n— Copyright © 1928 Virginia Woolf from Orlando: A Biography\n\n“I don’t know you, but I wish I did; I wish I could tell you how much I love you, love your eyes for reading this, love your hands for holding my words. I wish I could tell you in a way you would understand that so long as you read this, the world is not so terrible a place; that so long as we speak to each other, so long as there is love in the movement of a pen over paper and love in the movement of eyes over words, we will be all right, we will know each other, we will learn each other like songs.”\n\n— Copyright © 2015 Amal El-Mohtar from her short story Pockets, published in Issue #2 of Uncanny Magazine"
