Seeking more control over the research questions he pursued, Caruso returned to academia and earned a Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University, where he studied with Max Bazerman, Nick Epley, and Dan Gilbert. His dissertation explored some differences in how people perceive events that have already happened in the past compared to those that will happen in the future, with an emphasis on understanding the implications of these differences for moral and ethical decision making.\n\n“The theme that persists in my research is a fascination with how two or more people who are looking at the same information, or the same seemingly objective facts, can come to very different conclusions,” Caruso says.\n\nCaruso regularly brings his findings into the classroom. His hope is that his students come to understand that while we all have many experiences that enable us to develop reasonable intuitions for behavior in certain situations, we often don’t get the feedback necessary to learn efficiently from our mistakes.\n\n“One great thing about this kind of systematic research is that we can test quite precisely the strategies or the processes that tend to work well, and understand the conditions under which they are and are not effective,” Caruso says. “So, a broad theme in my classes is that managers need to test their intuitions.”\n\nPrior to joining the UCLA Anderson faculty, Caruso was an associate professor in the Behavioral Science program at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nFarzana Nayani (she/her/hers) is a recognized Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion specialist, business and strategy coach, and international keynote speaker.

A scholar and researcher of organizational behavior, she teaches in the Management and Organizations and Behavioral Decision Making areas.\n\nCaruso’s passion for facilitating collaborative success runs deep in her life and work. “My formal interests in organizational and social psychology developed when I was an undergraduate at Stanford doing cross-cultural negotiation research with Jared Curhan and Lee Ross,” she says. These interests deepened during her years as an engineer and executive in a multinational Silicon Valley startup. “I was fascinated with the real-world experiences stemming from differences in cultural identity. Interpersonal problems could derail even the most talented individual performers, and effective collaboration skills could not only prevent such problems, but raise individual contributions to new heights.”\n\nLayering rigorous academic training on top of practical experience, Caruso grounds her interests in the areas of: effective collaboration (especially for cross-functional and multicultural teams); skilled improvisation in leadership; management of identity, power and influence; and strategies for optimal choice, judgment and decision making. She focused on these topics in over a decade of teaching, research administration and scholarship at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and has moved to UCLA Anderson to enrich and expand her work.\n\n“Propelled by our outstanding research in these areas, we are connecting to pioneers and pathbreakers, building bridges between research and practice to best accelerate innovation in the digital age.”\n\nCaruso stays connected to the everyday priorities and challenges of the workplace by consulting for private- and public-sector organization leaders across the globe, as well as by teaching classes in leadership, team dynamics and power and influence. In addition, Caruso partnered with Chicago’s Second City to co-found the Second Science Project, which offers skill-building leadership workshops at the intersection of robust behavioral research and professional improvisational practice.\n\nCaruso is a strong proponent of lifelong learning for management excellence, and encourages students to make the most of their professors’ knowledge, not only while they are pursuing their degrees, but also throughout their careers. “As a preeminent public university, UCLA has a a distinctive opportunity to advance equity, diversity and inclusion,” she says. “It is an honor to help UCLA Anderson seize that opportunity by creating the kind of challenging and rewarding educational climate that can benefit leaders from every walk of life.”\n\nHolly is the “intern who never left” Disney, recently celebrating her 10th year at the company.

When thinking about creating change, and how much cooperation and intentionality this ultimately requires, there's an imperative to understand the lived experiences and perspectives of people across different combinations of privilege, marginalization, and institutional power. Only then can we create systems and communities that truly recognize and benefit all of the people within them.\n\nRufus Johnson serves as the Co-VP of Operations for the LA Black MBA Association (LABMBAA).
