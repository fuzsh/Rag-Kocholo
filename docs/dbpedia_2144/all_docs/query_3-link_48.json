        "text": "Congratulations to members of the BSM alpine team as they head to the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) Alpine Skiing Tournament! Despite the unusually warm winter, the girls’ and boys’ alpine teams had a strong season with determination to do their best. They recently concluded their regular season at the Section 5 finals on Tuesday, Feb. 6, hosted at Wild Mountain. The girls’ team finished in third place, with Grace Horejsi ‘24 securing third place and Lara DePauw ‘24 securing 10th place. Horejsi and DePauw will go on to compete in the state tournament as individual racers in the girls' division.\n\nSkiers on the BSM boys’ alpine team also qualified for State after finishing in fifth place at the Section tournament. State qualifiers include Simon McMahon ‘24 who placed ninth and Bennett Erickson ‘25 who placed 12th.\n\nThis year marks the third appearance for DePauw, Horejsi, and McMahon in the State Tournament. For Erickson, it will be his second.\n\nLast year, McMahon finished eighth at State and Erickson in 50th, earning both skiers All-Conference Awards. Additionally, as part of the team, they secured 2nd place overall and recorded BSM's best state ski finish since 2004.\n\nThe upcoming 2024 MSHSL State Boys and Girls Alpine Skiing Meet will be held on Tuesday, February 13 at Giant’s Ridge in Biwabik, MN.\n\nMore information and tickets are available on the MSHSL tournament website. Regular updates will be provided on this announcement as the tournament progresses.\n\nGood luck Red Knights! We are #BSMProud.\n\nUpdate: Wednesday, Feb. 14\n\nSimon McMahon (14th), Bennett Erickson (DNF), Grace Horejsi (5th), Lara DePauw (17th)\n\nCongratulations on a great season, Red Knights!"
