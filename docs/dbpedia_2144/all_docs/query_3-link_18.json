        "text": "1930’s\n\nThe Bennett Four – the first women who graduated from Bennett College as a four year liberal arts college for women. Ruth Artis Whitfield – the first librarian at Bennett. Maggie Simpson Matthews – the first African American Director of the YWCA in Detroit, Michigan. Margaret Dean Freeman – the first African American hired as a retail sales person who later joined her husband to establish their own clothing business. Alma Tarpley Taylor – the first President of the National Alumnae Association.\n\nMaide Ruth Gamble Norman ’34\n\nBelle Norman was an actress who appeared in various movies such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Airport 77, Halloween III, A Raisin in the Sun and also in the television series Dragnet and Days of Our Lives to name a few. Belle Norman’s acting career began in the late 1940’s at a time when African-American actors were not given many opportunities to showcase their acting skills and talent. She was known for refusing to play her character in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? In a stereotypically demeaning manner and even rewrote some of her lines to eliminate “old slavery-time talk.” While Hollywood offered her limited parts, Maide was able to play leading roles on the stage; she also appeared in numerous made-for- television films and mini-series. In addition to her acting career, Belle Norman taught drama at Stanford University and the University of California at Los Angeles, where she established a pioneering course on the history of blacks in American theater. Over the course of her long career, Belle Norman received numerous awards for her acting, including the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame Award in 1977 which was one of the highlights of her career. Even though her experience of acting in early Hollywood cinema was typical for African-American actors, she was able to bring dignity to the characters she played.\n\n1940’s\n\nClarice Gamble Herbert ’40\n\nBelle Herbert was the first African-American woman to assume directorship of a YWCA in Philadelphia. Herbert was part of a remarkable family that moved to Lima from Villa Rica, Georgia, in 1916. Her father, L.C. Gamble, was one of Lima’s first black policemen, served as a trustee of Wilberforce College and helped found Bradfield Center when his sons, James and Louis Jr., were not allowed to join the YMCA. He also was active in Republican Party politics for 37 years before his death in 1961. Her sister, Maide Norman was a stage, film and television actress, who, among her many roles, appeared with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? In 1920, when the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified, her mother, Lila Graham Gamble, was the first woman in Lima to cast a vote. Belle Herbert, who, during her high school and college years was involved with the YWCA, became a volunteer desk clerk with the YWCA in Lima in the early 1940s. “Growing up black and having goals that, for a while, I thought were unachievable, the YWCA sort of helped me reach some of the goals I had for myself,” Belle Herbert said in a Oct. 19, 1997 news article, when she became one of 11 women inducted into the Ohio Women’s Hall of Fame.\n\nDr. Dorothy Brown ’41\n\nBelle Brown was the first woman to practice general surgery in the South and eventually being made chief of surgery at Nashville’s Riverside Hospital.

Dorothy turned to Dr. Matthew Walker, Meharry Medical College’s longtime chief of surgery, for help. Against the advice of his staff, Walker asked Brown to join the faculty and she became a professor of surgery in 1957, a job she held until 1983. She was also the first African American woman to be made a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. Dorothy’s determination, beliefs, and values helped her to break through barriers in other aspects of her life.

Brown Women’s Residence at Meharry College in 1970, the humanitarian award from the Carnegie Foundation in 1993 and the prestigious Horatio Alger Award in 1994.

What historians overlooked:, according to Belles of Liberty: Gender, Bennett College by Dr. Linda Brown, ’61, was that the first Sit-in in Greensboro was carefully planned on Bennett College’scampus, and without hundreds of women who sat down, marched and were incarcerated from 1960 to1963, the sit-in effort and subsequent desegregation of Greensboro and even other cities, might not have succeeded. Bettye Davis McCain, class of 1963, committed to sitting at the “white-only” lunch counter of F. and W. Woolworth’s variety store with students from A&T and to return until it was integrated.

Jackson began volunteering at her grandson’s school, Diggs- Latham, when he was in pre-kindergarten and decided to start a community garden at the school. In the beginning, she was a committee of one. A few teachers, parents and students would drop by and help on occasion, but no one stayed long-term. Determined, Jackson was not ready to give up on her idea of a garden where children could learn about growing things. It was hard in the beginning because when the soil was first turned, it was discovered that building debris had been buried where the garden was to be. As the soil was tilled, often rocks, bricks and other items turned up, making it difficult to prepare for planting. But Belle Jackson was not deterred. She applied for a grant from the Whole Foods Foundation and received $2,000 to help purchase a much-needed tiller. Her first plants were donated lettuce that was too wilted to sell. Through people she met at Old Salem who were starting a children’s garden, she learned about seed collections and helped to launch the Homowo seed collection project, which collects seeds primarily from Africa or with African-American roots. Her grandson is now grown, but Jackson continues to maintain the community garden. Some of the produce from the garden goes into the school’s Backpack Program to feed hungry children. The garden has yielded strawberries, cherry tomatoes, carrots, peanuts, asparagus, and even green cotton. Although green cotton isn’t a food, it teaches children what cotton looks like before it is cleaned, spun and woven into cloth. Becoming a Master Gardener was never part of Jackson’s plan. A friend who was taking the Master Gardening class through the NC Agricultural Extension Agency asked Irma to come with her. Since she happened to have some free time, she took the class, became a Master Gardener, and recently was honored as the Agricultural Volunteer of the Year.\n\nVernelle Clements Boykin ’71\n\nBelle Boykin is transforming lives by volunteering at five schools in Haiti.
