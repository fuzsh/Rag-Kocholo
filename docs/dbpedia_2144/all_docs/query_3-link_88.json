        "text": "As a dreamy and anxious child, I worried that music would someday dry up – a kind of twist on the one-day-the-sun-will-die fear that flickers through the night-provoked minds of children when grownups imagine them sweetly at rest. How implausible it seemed to believe in an infinite flow of melodic combinations made out of a trickle of musical notes. How could one composer plinking a tune on a piano in 1967 know whether this tune already had a history? Maybe it was chanted by a worker on the Giza pyramids or strummed on a lute by a girl who wondered whether Bastet had heard it eons before?\n\nThen there were words.\n\nWords seemed not to pose the same worry over scarcity that music did, perhaps because, hearing people talk and reading endless Nancy Drews and Alcotts, I could more readily believe in an infinite swirl of words burbling up from some mysterious, dependable wellspring.\n\nThe fine work chosen for this issue was compiled from a seemingly endless bounty of submissions, most of which we could not include in our already overflowing, but finite, sixth issue (not eleventh issue; see Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four for explanation). The editors offer appreciative thanks to the writers and artists who sent us work to consider and are heartened by the venturesome spirit that keeps those creative wellsprings bubbling.\n\nJust for essays alone, we had fanciful, idiosyncratic work on flirtation, travel, burdensome marijuana laws, family dynamics, costuming, vision, love, teaching, testing, wily petitioners, wacky social justice evangelists, love, family dynamics, love, work, family dynamics, love and more love, more or less, because love kind of covers the gamut and the gamut is everintriguing, sometimes astonishing, often peculiar, frequently unsettling, occasionally solacing. And all of this work was worth reading, admiring, and reserving space here to acknowledge.\n\nAs with previous issues, our sixth issue presents work by young artists alongside seasoned, well-published veterans.\n\nIn issue 5, we featured a series of portraits by Eli Dreyfuss, a remarkable young photographer I came across while browsing the galleries of work by national medalists on the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards site. One of Eli’s photos is included in this issue’s special section: a small sampling of the exciting work by young photographers culled from the 2016 Scholastic art galleries.\n\nWhen the world seems grim and the music seems in danger of running out, there is both respite and renewal to be found in the omnipresent voices of our artists – especially the humbling voices of the young. Eli writes: “In my eyes the world and every person in is it is beautiful. I capture their beauty and share their stories with the world.”\n\nAnd we can trust there will always be new music.\n\nKate Falvey\n\nEditor in Chief\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPECIAL SECTION: SCHOLASTIC ART AWARD NATIONAL WINNERS\n\nStuck in Time\n\n152 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nBrothers\n\n153 Elle Wolfley\n\nUntitled\n\n154 Nora Villalobos\n\nSheep\n\n155 Emily Goncalves\n\nHaven\n\n156 Taylor Ross\n\nCassandra\n\n157 Eleanor Levine\n\nClouds\n\n158 Torrance Hall\n\nThe Long Wait\n\n159 Eyerusalem Meaza\n\nLimbs\n\n160 Victor Payton\n\nEnlightened\n\n162 Anna Hopkins\n\nStruck\n\n163 Claire Pikul\n\nFrom Poetry Editor, George Guida\n\nI met Bill Herman (1926-2013) in another dimension. I was a twenty- one year-old intern at the City College of New York. Bill was the kindly dean, a mentor, who allowed me to feel I could actually have a career in teaching. He was wise, charming, generous, and, most important to me, down to earth. For years that’s how I remembered him, until one day, maybe fifteen years later, I ran into Bill at an academic conference. He was sitting in the audience for a reading featuring me and a few other poets. He had come with his wife, the writer Joanna Clapps Herman, whom I’d met at other readings, but didn’t know as his wife. After the reading, he approached, hugged me, and said he had laughed his “fool head off ” at my poems.\n\nIn the years that followed, I came to know and to value Bill and Joanna as friends and as remarkable writers. Bill never spoke much about himself, preferring to praise Joanna’s and other people’s writing. But he was an exceptional talent. In Joanna’s words, he was perhaps, more than anything else, a reader. He read and wrote nearly every day: plays, movie scripts, novels stories, poems, and memoir. Language had formed his life from a young age. He loved the high and the low. His stories, collected in The Man Who Beat Life (Pleasure Boat Press), show his elegant work.\n\nWhile William Herman was not well-known as writer, he was a writer’s writer, which, for this writer, means a gifted artist who practiced his art the way he lived his life—for the right reasons. In our very first issue, 2 Bridges published Bill’s memorable poem “I want to know someone,” which begins “I want to know someone / who looks like me”; and ends “I’d like there to be an intimacy / between us. / I have a thousand questions.” I’m glad I got to know someone like Bill. One time, as a younger man, I asked him what it was like to have a friend for sixty or seventy years. He said, “It’s the best thing in the world.” The next best thing is to have your friend with you on the page until such time as you can meet again.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPECIAL SECTION: PORTRAITS BY ELI DREYFUSS\n\nSelfie King\n\n120 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nMysterious Faces\n\n121 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nStand Strong\n\n122 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nLast Look\n\n123 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nEntrapped Sadness\n\n124 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nOne Sided\n\n125 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nState of Depression\n\n126 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nArtist’s Eyes\n\n127 Eli Dreyfuss\n\nYoung Eyes\n\n128 Eli Dreyfuss"
