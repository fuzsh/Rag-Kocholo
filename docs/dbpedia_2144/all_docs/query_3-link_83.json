The Committee on Education and workforce will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. Before we begin, I’d like to begin with a moment of silence to recognize all the Israelis and others who have been killed, injured or taken hostage by Hamas terrorists.\n\nThank you. Today, each of you will have a chance to answer to and atone for the many specific instances of vitriolic, hate filled, anti-Semitism on your respective campuses that have denied students the safe learning environment they are due. As you confront our questions in this hearing, remember, you’re not speaking to us, but to the students on your campus who have been threatened and assaulted and who look to you to protect them.\n\nSeveral of those students are with us in this room, including Jonathan Frieden, who’s the President of Alliance for Israel and a Harvard Law student. Iall Yacobi [ph], who’s a student at UPenn, Talia Kahn, who is the President of MIT Israel Alliance and an MIT graduate student; Bella Ingber, who is co-president of NYU Students Supporting Israel and a junior at New York University; Israel Ingber who is expected to start at the University of Chicago in the fall, after taking a gap year to study in Israel, after being sent home right before the atrocities of October 7th; Maya Kufer [ph], who is a freshman at UPenn; and Liam Kries [ph], who is an American Israeli sophomore at UPenn.\n\nWe have a short video that we will play now, that shows what these students are facing. Video Presentation. I want to do something, which I rarely do, quote”the Senate majority leader from New York, Chuck Schumer.” On Wednesday, he took to the Senate floor to deliver an address on anti Semitism, stating, ‘many of the people who express these sentiments in America aren’t neo-Nazis or card carrying Klan members or Islamist extremists.\n\nThey are in many cases, people that most liberal Jewish Americans felt previously were their ideological fellow travelers. Not long ago, many of us marched together for Black and Brown lives,’ end of quote. You see this speech by the most powerful elected Jewish politician in America was addressed to many on his left flank.\n\nHe questioned how these elements of the left, which pride themselves on diversity and inclusion, could be responsible for fomenting such hatred toward liberal, Jewish Americans. I quote Majority Leader Schumer to you, Presidents Gay, McGill, and Kornbluth, because I understand that speech to be a sort of reckoning for the Jewish identity with the radical left.\n\nYet for 40 minutes, he fails to use the word university a single time. However, after the events of the past two months, it’s clear that rabid anti-Semitism in the university are two ideas that cannot be cleaved from one another. A prime example of this ideology at work is at Harvard, where classes are taught, such as DP 385, race and racism in the making of the United States as a global power.\n\nThe Harvard Global Health Institute hosts seminars such as, quote, ‘Scientific Racism and Anti Racism History and recent perspectives.’ Even the Harvard Divinity School has a page devoted to, quote, ‘social and racial justice.’ Harvard also, not coincidentally, but causally, was ground zero for anti-Semitism following October 7th, and is the single least tolerant school in the nation, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expressions 2024 College Free Speech Rankings.\n\nUPenn is right behind them, at 247th of 248. MIT is in the middle of the pack. What I’m describing is a grave danger, inherent in assenting to the race based ideology of the radical left. Senator Schumer hasn’t put the pieces together, but the picture is far too clear now to American Jews. Institutional anti-Semitism and hate are among the poison fruits of your institution’s cultures.\n\nThe buck for what has happened must stop on the President’s desk, along with the responsibility for making never again true on campus. Do you have the courage to truly confront and condemn the ideology driving anti-Semitism, or will you offer weak, blame shifting excuses and yet another responsibility dodging task force?\n\nThat’s ultimately the most important question for you to confront in this hearing. I will close with this. I appreciate your appearances today on behalf of Harvard, UPenn and MIT, respectively. It proves your universities have, at minimum, a sense of accountability to the American people. But my praise for postsecondary education is very limited these days.\n\nHarvard, UPenn and MIT, you have a very big role to play in shaping the future for all of academia. This moment is an inflection point. It demands leaders of moral clarity, with the courage to delineate good from evil and right from wrong. With that, I look forward to each of your testimonies. I yield to the ranking member for an opening statement.\n\nDONALD NORCROSS: Thank you, Dr. Foxx. And thank our witnesses for appearing today. Historically, college campuses have been hubs for students and faculty to foster intellectual thought and expression. Regrettably, following Hamas’ mass October 7th attack on innocent civilians in Israel, and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, college campuses have become polarized, and we’ve been witnessing a disturbing rise in the incidence of antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n\nTo be clear, this discrimination is nothing new on college campuses, indeed nothing new in society, generally. Any student of history knows that it did not start with the October 7th attacks or any one new event, and it didn’t start with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. My colleagues would do well to recall this this country as a centuries long history of racism and white supremacy.\n\nAt the same time, free speech is a constitutional right and the bedrock of our democracy, and colleges and universities are often on the front lines of defending this right. But schools are also responsible for fostering campus environments that promote understanding, respectful dialogue, and above all else student safety.\n\nSo today we’ll hear from representatives of universities on their efforts to protect students and address discrimination on campus. Of note, this is an opportunity that my Republican colleagues denied us in 2017, when committee Democrats called for a hearing six years ago on campus discrimination, when white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia grounds shouting Jews will not replace us. We didn’t — couldn’t get a hearing back then.\n\nAnd while my colleagues claim to be committed to combating discrimination on campus, they’re also contradictorily and simultaneously stoking culture wars that can be divisive and discriminatory. Moreover, House Republicans are proposing significant cuts to the Department of Education’s offices — Office of Civil Rights, the very office responsible for upholding student civil rights and investigating discrimination claims.\n\nYou can’t have it both ways. You can’t call for action then hamstring the hamstring the agency charged with taking that action to protect students’ civil rights. In stark contrast, the Biden administration has taken an active role in helping institutions protect students as part of the White House’s national strategy to combat anti-Semitism.\n\nUnder President Biden’s direction, the Department of Education has provided additional guidance to colleges and universities on how to uphold the obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and better address anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of discrimination on campus. We’ve also opened investigations into recent incidences on many campuses, including Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Wesley, University of Pennsylvania, University of Tampa, just to name a few.\n\nIn closing, I want to echo my colleague, and I’ll quote, Senator Schumer again, ‘all Americans share a responsibility and an obligation to fight back, whenever we see the rise of prejudice of any type in our midst.’ So today, I hope my Republican colleagues will denounce the culture wars that have distracted us from protecting many vulnerable students.\n\nAnd I hope we can stand behind the Biden administration’s critical work to ensure that every student and educator has access to a campus free of discrimination, harassment and violence. To that end, I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Mr. Scott. Pursuant to Rule 8(c), see all members who wish to insert written statements into the record may do so by submitting them to the committee clerk electronically in Microsoft Word format by 5:00 pm, 14 days after the date of this hearing, which is December 19th, 2023. And without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 14 days, to allow such statements and other extraneous material referenced during the hearing to be submitted for the official hearing record. I now turn to the introduction of our witnesses.\n\nOur first witness is Dr. Claudine Gay, who is the president of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our second witness is Ms. Liz McGill, who’s the president of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our next witness is Dr. Pamela Nadel, who is a professor of history Jewish studies at American University in Washington DC. And our final witness is Dr. Sally Kornbluth, who is president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nNote, Dr. Kornbluth will monitor her diabetes during the hearing. We thank you all for being here today and look forward to your testimony. I’d like to remind the witnesses that we have read your written statements, which will appear in full in the hearing record, pursuant to Committee Rule 8(d) and Committee Practice.\n\nI ask that each of you limit your oral presentations to a five minute summary of your written statement. I also like to remind the witnesses to be aware of the responsibility to provide accurate information to the committee. If we have a demonstration that gets unruly, we will ask the campus police to take people out immediately.\n\nI now recognize Dr. Gay for five minutes.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished members of the committee, my name is Claudine Gay and I am the president of Harvard University. It’s an honor to be here today, representing a community of more than 25,000 undergraduate and graduate students, more than 19,000 faculty and staff, and more than 400,000 alumni, including multiple members of this committee.\n\nThank you for calling this hearing on the critical topic of antisemitism. Our community still mourns those brutally murdered during the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on October 7th. Words fail in the face of such depravity, the deadliest single day for the Jewish community since the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nIn the two months since the atrocities of October 7th, and the subsequent armed conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, we have seen a dramatic and deeply concerning rise in antisemitism around the world, in the United States, and on our campuses, including my own. I know many in our Harvard Jewish community are hurting and experiencing grief, fear, and trauma.\n\nI have heard from faculty, students, staff, and alumni of incidents of intimidation and harassment. I have seen reckless and thoughtless rhetoric shared, in person and online, on campus and off. I have listened to leaders in our Jewish community who are scared and disillusioned. At the same time, I know members of Harvard’s Muslim and Arab communities are also hurting.\n\nDuring these past months, the world, our nation, and our campuses have also seen a rise of incidents of Islamophobia. During these difficult days, I have felt the bonds of our community strain. In response, I have sought to confront hate while preserving free expression. This is difficult work, and I know that I have not always gotten it right.\n\nThe free exchange of ideas is the foundation upon which Harvard is built, and safety and well-being are the prerequisites for engagement in our community. Without both of these things, our teaching and research mission founder. In the past two months, our bedrock commitments have guided our efforts. We have increased security measures, expanded reporting channels, and augmented counseling, mental health and support services.\n\nWe have reiterated that speech that incites violence threatens safety or violates Harvard’s policies against bullying and harassment is unacceptable. We have made it clear that any behaviors that disrupt our teaching and research efforts will not be tolerated, and where these lines have been crossed, we have taken action.\n\nWe have drawn on our academic expertise to create learning opportunities for our campus community. We have begun examinations of the ways in which anti-Semitism and other forms of hate manifest at Harvard and in American society. We have also repeatedly made clear that we at Harvard reject antisemitism and denounce any trace of it on our campus or within our community.\n\nAntisemitism is a symptom of ignorance, and the cure for ignorance is knowledge. Harvard must model what it means to preserve free expression, while combating prejudice and preserving the security of our community. We are undertaking that hard, long term work with the attention and intensity it requires.\n\nOnce again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss this important work. I have faith today that through thoughtful, focused, and determined effort, we will once again meet adversity and grow. Thank you.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Dr. Gay. Ms. Magill, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished members of this committee, for the opportunity to be here today. My name is Elizabeth Magill, and I am the president of the University of Pennsylvania. Let me begin by saying that I and the University of Pennsylvania are horrified by and condemn Hamas’s abhorrent and brutal terror attack on Israel on October 7th. There is no justification, none, for those heinous attacks.\n\nThe loss of life and suffering that are occurring in Israel and Gaza during the ensuing war are heartbreaking. This pain, sorrow, and fear extends to our campus and to our city of Philadelphia. This hearing this morning takes place just two days after the Philadelphia community witnessed, in horror, the hateful words and actions of protesters who marched through the city and then near our campus.\n\nThese protesters directly targeted a center city business that is Jewish and Israeli owned, a troubling and shameful act of antisemitism. Philadelphia Police and Penn Public Safety were present, and thankfully, no one was injured. But these events have understandably left many in our community upset and afraid.\n\nAnti-Semitism, an old, viral and pernicious evil, has been steadily rising in our society and these world events have dramatically accelerated that surge. Few places have proven immune, including Philadelphia and campuses like ours. This is unacceptable. We are combating this hate on our campus with both immediate and comprehensive action.\n\nI have condemned antisemitism publicly, regularly, and in the strongest possible terms. And today, let me reiterate my and Penn’s unyielding commitment to combating it. We immediately investigate any hateful act, cooperating with both law enforcement and the FBI, where we have identified individuals who have committed these acts in violation of either policy or law.\n\nWe initiate disciplinary proceedings and engage law enforcement. We have acted decisively to ensure safety throughout and near our campus, expanding the presence of public safety officers at our religious life centers and all across campus. On November 1st, just over a month ago, I announced Penn’s action plan to combat antisemitism.\n\nThis builds on our anti-hate efforts to date, and it is anchored firmly in the United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. The plan centers on three, key areas and has many elements. Those areas are safety and security, engagement, and education. As part of this plan, I have convened and charged a task force to identify concrete, actionable recommendations, directing them to provide me with their recommendations, both in real time and then a final report in a couple of months.\n\nTo ensure that our Jewish students have a direct channel to share their experiences with me, I’ve created a student advisory group on the student experience. Today’s hearing is focused on antisemitism and its direct impact on the Jewish community, but history teaches us that where antisemitism goes unchecked, other forms of hate spread, and ultimately can threaten democracy.\n\nWe are seeing a rise in our society in harassment, intimidation, and threats toward individuals based on their identity as Muslim, Palestinian, or Arab. At Penn, we are investigating all these allegations for members of our community and providing resources to support individuals experiencing threats, online harassment, and doxing.\n\nWe will continue to deploy all the necessary resources to support any member of the community experiencing hate. As president, I am committed to a safe, secure, and supportive educational environment so that our academic mission can thrive. It is crucial that ideas are exchanged and diverse viewpoints are debated.\n\nAs a student of constitutional democracy, I know that we need both safety and free expression for universities, and ultimately democracy, to thrive. In these times, these competing principles can be difficult to balance, but I am determined to get it right. And we must get this right. The stakes are too high.\n\nPenn would not be what it is without its strong Jewish community — past, present, and future. I am proud of this tradition and deeply troubled when members of our Jewish community share that their sense of belonging has been shaken. Under my leadership, we will never ever shrink from our moral responsibility to combat anti-Semitism and educate all to recognize and reject hate.\n\nWe will remain vigilant. I look forward to your questions.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Ms. Magill. Dr. Nadell, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nPAMELA NADELL: Thank you Chairman — Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott for inviting me today. I’m Pamela Nadel. I’m a professor of Jewish history at American University. And I’m currently writing the book Antisemitism, An American Tradition, supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities Public Scholar Award.\n\nAnd I am delighted to be here today, because this gives me an opportunity to thank Congress for sustaining, through the NEH, scholarship essential to understanding our nation’s past. This is the third time I have testified about this topic before Congress. The first was in 2017, just three months after White supremacists chanting Jews will not replace us, paraded through the University of Virginia brandishing torch lights, echoing Nazi stormtroopers strutting through Germany in the 1930s. I emphasize this, because the antisemitism igniting on campuses today is not new.\n\nIt is part of a long history of American anti Semitism. While anti Semitism is difficult to define, historical examples convey some of its contours. Anti-Semites believe that Jews have been corrupted by money, since Judas portrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, and they’ve employed codenames for avaricious Jews — Shylock, Rothschild, and in the 21st century George Soros.\n\nAnti-Semites believe Jews conspire to destroy Christian, Western civilization. These conspiracy theories gained currency in the 1920s, when Henry Ford’s newspaper ran the series, The International Jew, The World’s Foremost Problem. Today, the charge that the Jews are internationalists has been replaced by the dog whistle globalist, implying the Jews are the puppet masters of the worldwide order.\n\nAcross American history, people from all walks of life have conveyed anti-Semitic ideas since 1654, when New Amsterdam Governor, Peter Stuyvesant, tried to expel, and I quote, ‘this deceitful race, such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ.’ Now more than 350 years later, we have just marked the fifth anniversary of the murders at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue.\n\nOn city streets, abuse is hurled at Orthodox Jews, and swastikas are graffitied on dorm doors, and also at the State Department. The long history of American antisemitism left its mark in higher education. Quotas on the admission of Jewish students began in the Ivy League in the 1920s, and spread to more than 700 private colleges and universities.\n\nThe campuses also wrestled with the challenge of antisemitic speech before this fall. In the early 1990s, Holocaust deniers took out full page ads in college newspapers. Those ads launched furious debates about free speech on campus and also helped propel Holocaust courses into the university to respond to the disinformation.\n\nAnti-Israel invective has been flaring on campus well before this fall. I could look back more than 20 years. In October 2200, students at the University of Michigan yelled “Israel is a fascist state” and protested a Hillel teaching. But the barbarity of the Hamas terror of October 7th adds a terrible new chapter to Jewish history.\n\nAnyone who claims to care about human rights should denounce these horrors. That so many on campus, not only did not, but that they justified the savagery in name of opposition to Israel has caused Jews around the world deep anguish. While I deplore all hateful speech, antisemitic speech remains in America, protected.\n\nFree speech stands at the core of the liberal arts education and education, which almost every member of Congress benefited from when they were students. But free speech does not permit harassment, discrimination, bias, threats or violence in any form. And when they occur, our institutions and not just the campus but our nation, they have in place mechanisms to respond.\n\nThe American Jewish community has long strategized about how to reduce antisemitism. Their efforts received a stunning confirmation when the US National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism was published. I believe this is the first time any nation has developed such a document. I urge Congress to do everything in its power to support the National Strategy and also the forthcoming National Strategy to counter Islamophobia.\n\nThank you.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Dr. Kornbluth, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Thank you. Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for this opportunity to describe how MIT is fighting the scourge of antisemitism. My name is Sally Kornbluth. I have been president of MIT since January of this year. As an American, as a Jew and as a human being, I abhor antisemitism and my administration is combating it actively.\n\nSince October 7th, my campus communications have been crystal clear about the dangers of antisemitism and about the atrocity of the Hamas terror attack. Let me repeat what I said in my very first message to campus. In that video, I said quote, “The brutality perpetrated on innocent civilians in Israel by terrorists, from Hamas is horrifying.\n\nIn my opinion, such a deliberate attack on civilians can never be justified.” I also made clear that students were feeling unsafe because of their Jewish faith or their ties to Israel. And said, “That should trouble every one of us deeply.” I have reinforced this message including in a November 14th campus video.\n\nAs I said then, quote , “antisemitism is real and it is rising in the world. We cannot let it poison our community.” I have been direct and unequivocal. And such leadership statements are important, but they must be paired with action. And this is just what we are doing at MIT. Months before October 7th, MIT joined the International Hillel Campus Climate Initiative, which helps universities build awareness of and actions against antisemitism.\n\nWe have launched an MIT wide effort called Standing Together Against Hate. It will emphasize both education and community building, especially in our residence halls. In addition to fighting antisemitism, it will address Islamophobia also on the rise and also underreported. MIT will take on both, not lumped together, but with equal energy and in parallel.\n\nImportantly, as is clearly visible on campus, we have increased the police presence. Safety has been our primary concern. Nonetheless, I know some Israeli and Jewish students feel unsafe on campus as they bear the horror of the Hamas attacks and the history of antisemitism. These students have been pained by chance in recent demonstrations.\n\nI strongly believe that there is a difference — between what we can say to each other. That is what we have a right to say and what we should say as members of one community. Yet as president of MIT, in addition to my duties to keep the campus safe and to maintain the functioning of this national asset, I must at the same time ensure that we protect speech and viewpoint diversity for everyone.\n\nThis is in keeping with the Institute’s principles on free expression. Meeting those three goals is challenging and the results can be terribly uncomfortable, but it is essential to how we operate in the United States. Those who want us to shut down protest language are in effect arguing for a speech code.\n\nBut in practice, speech codes do not work. Problematic speech needs to be countered with other speech and with education. And we are doing that. However, the right to free speech does not extend to harassment, discrimination or incitement to violence in our community. MIT policies are clear on this. To keep the campus functioning, we also have policies to regulate the time, manner and place of demonstrations.\n\nReports of student conduct that may violate our policies are handled through our Faculty Lead Committee on Discipline. Our campus actions, today, have protected student safety, minimize disruptions to campus activities and protected the right to free expression. We are intensifying our central efforts to combat antisemitism the vital subject of this hearing.\n\nI note that I am also deeply concerned about the rise in prejudice against Arabs, Muslims and Palestinians, nationally and in our community. And we are determined to combat that as well. We are also supporting faculty, staff and student initiatives to counter hate. And thanks to an inspiring group of faculty members, we are seeing more discussion among students with conflicting views.\n\nWe know there is further work to do, but we are seeing progress. And MIT’s vital mission continues. Thank you. I am happy to answer questions.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Dr. Kornbluth. I’ll begin the questioning of our witnesses. I’m going to ask members — before I ask my questions, let me — let me do some housekeeping. Under Committee Rule 9, we will now question witnesses under the five minute rule. I remind members that I’ll strictly enforce the five minute rule, so you’re — so members are advised to keep your questions succinct so the witnesses have time to answer.\n\nPlease don’t talk for four minutes and then ask the witness a question. That — we’ve heard from many students that they do not feel safe. You’ve talked about that in your statements. But the antisemitism we’ve seen — on your campuses didn’t come out of nowhere. Their cultures that your institutions that foster it because you have faculty and students who hate Jews, hate Israel and are comfortable apologizing for terror.\n\nHow did your campuses get this way? What is it about the way that you hire faculty and approve curriculum that’s allowing your campuses to be infected by this intellectual and moral rot? President Gay, I’m going to ask you to give me a brief answer. I also would invite you to follow up with more in writing and we will follow up with you.\n\nSo, I will go down the line President Gay, then President Magill and President Kornbluth.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: thank you. Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx. Again, antisemitism has no place at Harvard. When we recruit faculty, we do so with the understanding that they are joining a community where we — we honor, celebrate and nurture open discourse both on the campus and in the classroom. And to be a successful teacher and educator at Harvard requires the ability to draw out all of the viewpoints and voices in your classroom, irrespective of one’s political views.\n\nAnd we devote significant resources to training our faculty in that pedagogical skill and to prioritizing that in our recruiting and hiring.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Magill?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Thank you for the opportunity to address the question. I’m troubled by what you’re reporting about the — the culture of the institutions that we’re leading, very contrary to the values that I hold as a leader of Pennsylvania — University of Pennsylvania as well as the institution where any form of hate is very contrary to our values.\n\nI would venture an answer, Chairwoman Foxx, that antisemitism has a role in the broader society. And that’s what we’re seeing happening in the society and on our campuses. And I’m committed to combating it in immediate term and the long term.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Dr. Kornbluth?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Yes. So, MIT is a majority STEM educational research institution, and we are devoted to solving the problems that face society. Our faculty are hired for their brilliance. Now, we allow them to say what they’d like in the classroom in the name of free expression, but we are committed to having them know that this is — that our campus must be a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nAnd although they may say what they like in the classroom, academically, targeting any individual student harassing or discriminating is strictly forbidden in our classrooms and on campus.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. We will be following up with asking for specific plans for disciplining student and faculty who assault or harass students or prevent them from accessing — undistracted classes or campus spaces. We’ll be asking for your plan for preventing this rot from perpetuating how you’re going to hire and Assess instructors, how you change how you govern students, and what are the practical steps you will plan to take?. I — I want to ask you one more question.\n\nIt seems — as I’ve said and — and Ms. Magill. I appreciate the fact that you feel concerned about the — my feeling about the fundamental culture on the campuses that’s foundational to this issue, denial of the right of Israel to exist. So I want to ask each one of you, President Gay, do you believe that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish nation?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I agree that the State of Israel has the right to exist.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Ms. Magill same question.\n\nLIZ MAGILL: I agree, Chairwoman Foxx, the State of Israel has the right to exist.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Dr. Kornbluth?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Absolutely, Israel has the right to exist.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: I want to thank our witnesses again for being here and to say we will follow up. And to tell you that while we’ve talked about a larger culture out there, it’s the universities who should be examples of what this nation is all about. I yield back and I recognize the distinguished ranking member who is wanting me to recognize Mr. Courtney.\n\nJOE COURTNEY: Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx. And I want to thank you for the moment of silence for the 137 hostages who are still being held to this day. We had a hearing a couple of weeks ago on antisemitism where I shared with my colleagues and the witnesses that a dual US Israeli citizen with family in Waterford, Connecticut was one of those being held at the time.\n\nAlong — and we thought her husband. Her name is [inaudible] and [inaudible]. The good news is a week ago, Leah Ott [ph] was released. And unfortunately, a day later the Israeli military shared with the family that human remains which were found at the kibbutz where the violent attack took place unfortunately matched up to Ahviv.\n\n[ph] Again, Hamas never shared the information about whether or not they had him or not, which is just another example of their — their treachery. Dr. Nadell, in your testimony on page eight, you talked about President Biden’s US National Strategy to counter antisemitism and particularly, you talked about the use of Title 6 of the US Civil Rights Act in terms of being an effective tool on campuses to — to combat antisemitism.\n\nI was wondering if you could talk about the little bit.\n\nPAMELA NADELL: So, Title 6 allows for responding to some of the issues that the — the president’s of these universities, but also frankly of most universities around the nation, it seems at the moment have been dealing with in terms of when antisemitism moves into — moves beyond free speech, moves beyond rhetoric and involves harassment or intimidation. The issue is that the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education needs to be fully funded in order to implement the US strategy to counter antisemitism.\n\nAnd I just want to comment about this strategy because it is an extraordinary document. It has actions for the — the White House to carry out or the — the — that — that division, but it has issues for Congress to carry out, which I have a sense Congress has not been carrying out, and it also has major charges to Hall of Society to respond to antisemitism, some of which we are hearing is already happening on the campuses.\n\nThe problem is they don’t make headlines because they’re not a bunch of protesters.\n\nJOE COURTNEY: Thank you. And again, it’s important to note that document was released back in May of 2023, certainly before this committee and — and the you know, outrageous events of October 7th. And the ranking member mentioned in his opening remarks that, you know, at the same time we’re holding this hearing, we’re also now still trying to get a budget passed for fiscal year 2024. The majority in the House reported out their budget, which as you mentioned carried a cut for the Office of Civil Rights.\n\nTo be more specific, it’s a 25 percent cut, $35 million out of their rather small budget, $72 million lower than what the president had asked for. I mean, we — we had a witness here again two weeks ago from the — who worked for almost 20 plus years at ADL, the Anti-Defamation League. They’ve been around for 110 years, fighting antisemitism in this country.\n\nAnd again, she talked about the fact that, you know, that type of cut is just going to cripple the ability of the antisemitism police, if you want, to sort of look at it that way in terms of trying to — to stop this type of activity on campuses. And again, I was just wondering if you had sort of — what your view is of a cut in terms of the impact of the Office of Civil Rights to do its job?\n\nPAMELA NADELL: I think the cut is absolutely devastating. And what I would also remind everyone is that the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education does not only focus on antisemitism. It focuses on all forms of hate. And I — I would guess — I actually tried to find this information, but was unable to do so, but I would guess that the majority of complaints are not coming from Jewish students, although maybe now given what happened since October 7th, I would guess the majority of the complaints are actually coming from people of color and from others who have faced terrible bias.\n\nSo it is unthinkable, unconscionable to make that cut now.\n\nJOE COURTNEY: And talk is cheap. I mean, I’ve been around here a while. Budgets are what really, I think, show the true willingness to act in situations like this. And I’d just like to close by mentioning that in Connecticut, a young transfer student, an international student from the West Bank, Tyson Ali Hammad, [ph] a sophomore at Trinity College, is a math major who was up visiting friends in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nThey were walking from going bowling. And this coward came out of his house with a firearm and at point blank range shot all three students who were absolutely — they were going to their relative’s house at the time. And it shows again that the civil rights effort of the Department of Justice, which also was being subjected to a potential cut needs to get full funding in the Office of Civil Rights.\n\nAnd with that, I would yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Mr. Courtney. I now recognize Congressman Wilson from South Carolina for five minutes.\n\nJOE WILSON: Thank you. Thank you, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx. And Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, I believe appropriately began this hearing about how serious this hearing is. That the Iran puppets of Hamas have victimized the world including here in the United States. And shocking, as we include people who have been affected, it should be Paul Kessler of California, who was murdered by a professor, a professor supporting Hamas as he was demonstrating peacefully on behalf of the people of Israel.\n\nAnd so, we have victims right in our country of murder in California. With that in mind and I say this respectfully to each of the university professors here today, without any explanation, I would like the answer, and it should be a percentage of conservatives, and that is you each rightfully promote diversity and inclusion of race and gender with percentages available that is available at your universities.\n\nWhat is the percentage of conservative professors at your institutions? I only want to know the percent of conservatives. What is the number, Dr. — President Gay?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you, Congressman. So, I can’t provide you that statistic because it’s not data that we collect. But I will say that we — we try to draw our talent to Harvard from —\n\nJOE WILSON: Ok. I — we’ve got to race ahead, please. I want more. I just want to know. What is the percentage of conservative professors at Harvard?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I do not have that statistic. We don’t collect that data.\n\nJOE WILSON: Well, that concerns me. And President Magill, what are the percentage of conservative professors allowed to teach at your institution?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Representative, I strongly believe in a wide variety of perspectives. We do not track that information, so I can’t give that to you.\n\nJOE WILSON: Ok. No, none. I got the message. And President Kornbluth, what is the percentage of conservative professors in — at MIT?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: We do not document people’s political views, but conservatives are welcome to teach on our campus.\n\nJOE WILSON: And I think this is so sadly and shamefully revealing that there is no diversity and inclusion of intellectual thought. And the result of that is antisemitism. And you can study with government money all you want to, Doctor, but it’s due to illiberalism that has taken over the country. And you might look into that when you get your next government grant.\n\nWith that in mind, the barbaric mass murder on October 7th by Iran puppets Hamas, invading Israel, trained by war criminal Putin, has shockingly revealed that many college campuses are sickeningly antisemitic. This is defending the maniac Hamas agenda. The Hamas agenda is in their covenant of August 1988. I hope you read it because it says in Article 7, I’ll take you.\n\nYou don’t have to read the whole thing. Kill the Jews. What that means is death to Israel, death to America. And to have that presented as disgusting. Sadly, college campuses have descended from coveted citadels intellectual freedom to illiberal sewers of intolerance and bigotry. Diversity and inclusion are a George Orwell 1984 implementation as we see in excluding conservative thought.\n\nThe solution for close minded intolerance on campuses is obvious. To liberate academia from denial of free speech, respecting the First Amendment, there should be diversity and inclusion of more conservative academics overcoming today’s blatant discrimination. With that in mind, Dr. Magill, I’ve received questions from really wonderful students at the University of Pennsylvania who are in a state of shock about the state of the university.\n\nAnd you say the university has introduced a plan to combat antisemitism, yet we hear of more incitement and intimidation of Jewish students at Penn. Do you understand that having policies means nothing if you don’t implement them? And how many students or faculty have been removed to discipline under your policies?\n\nWhat is the average time for action on student conduct or other policies? Can — conclude — to conclude and get this back to me later, what are you enforcing? At a pro-Hamas Penn protest, President Huda [inaudible], [ph] and faculty member Ahmad Marlow [ph] were seen enthusiastically clapping in support of the speaker as he shouted, “Go back to Moscow, Brooklyn Blanking Berlin, where you came from.” Has any action been taken to address Professor [inaudible] and Professor Ahmed Marlow’s support of this insightful and intimidating speech?\n\nHow would are Jewish students in [inaudible] classes supposed to receive fair treatment when she endorses hatred? And I’ll introduce that. And also, I’m going to conclude by another question, how in the world can you all now have a class on resistance literature from pre-Islamic Arabia featuring a person who is with the terrorist organization PFLF? And I will present this to you.\n\nThank you.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: We go from Mr. Wilson from South Carolina to Ms. Wilson from Florida.\n\nFREDERICA WILSON: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott, and thank you to the witnesses for your testimonies today. As you — as the witnesses have shared, antisemitism anywhere is abhorrent and unacceptable and must be condemned. I’m privileged to represent a strong united Jewish community in South Florida.\n\nMy next door neighbor is a rabbi. My Jewish constituents have experienced everything from bomb threats on Jewish centers schools to harassment of Jewish community members. I stand with them. We talk often. We commiserate and we pray. We must take a stand against all forms of hate whether that be antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, xenophobia and terrorism.\n\nThis must stop. In Congress for seven years, I led the fight against Boko Haram, a terrorist group that kidnaped over 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria, gang rapes, beheadings, killing whole families, so I am particularly sensitive to this issue of terrorists and what they do. But disagreements about the conflict in the Middle East should never escalate to threats of violence against any community.\n\nWe are a civilized society. We must draw a line and condemn hate. Please know that in May the Biden administration — Biden-Harris administration introduced the US National Strategy to counter Antisemitism a comprehensive approach addressing anti-Semitism in diverse environments including college campuses.\n\nWith that I have a few questions. Ms. Nadell, based on your knowledge from 2016 to 2020, what has been the United States response to antisemitic events? I’m specifically thinking about Charlottesville Unite the Right, and what the Trump-Pence administration did compared to this administration. Ms. Nadell?\n\nPAMELA NADELL: The — the Unite the Right rally at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville, Virginia in August of 2017, was for me, and I believe actually for the majority of American Jews, a major turning point. It signaled that the long history of antisemitism in the United States that it was about to burst out again.\n\nAnd for the first time ever that I know of Jews who were worshiping in their synagogues make in a synagogue on Saturday morning and they watched some of those Unite the Right rallier’s parade past the synagogue armed. And they had to sneak out of the back of the synagogue because they were afraid that violence would break out.\n\nSo what we are seeing in terms of antisemitism in the — in this moment in time is that it’s been rising and rising since 2016. And although President Trump called the people who were the protesters and counter protesters said there were very good people on both sides. I disagree. I do not think there were very good people on both sides in Charlottesville in August 2017.\n\nFREDERICA WILSON: Ok, as I reflected, Professor Nadell, on the horrific events in the Middle East and the subsequent fallout on college campuses, I have been in contact with my friend and former Congressional colleague Ted Deutch, who now heads the American Jewish Committee. The committee is the author of the AJC Action Plan, a tool kit for university administrators.\n\nOne of the recommendations is that the university administrators recenter the conversation about the Middle East back to a place of fact based exchange. Could you comment on why this suggestion is important? And I’d like to, Madam Chair, into this report into the record.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Without objection.\n\nPAMELA NADELL: This action is important because the campuses where faculty who come from Middle East studies and faculty who come from Jewish studies have long been in conversation, not just since October 7th. Those are the places where the — what we do in the university has been manifested in, in the best way. So I’m thinking, for example, of Dartmouth University where they held a forum.\n\nAnd they had their second forum 300 people in the room. And they had 5000 people online. Our universities not only educate our students today, but we can educate the wider public. And so, I very much agree. I admire Ted Deutch and I admire the American Jewish Committee for what they are trying to do. But we — this is not a magic bullet.\n\nIt’s not going to be fixed overnight, but we are in the process of working on it and hopefully, tamping down antisemitism in America once again.\n\nFREDERICA WILSON: Thank you. And I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Your time is expired. And, Mr. Thompson, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: Thank you, Madam Chair, for calling this important hearing. Thanks today to all of our folks that are testifying. As we’ve all seen in recent weeks, there’s been a sharp rise in anti-Semitic words, actions and attacks online, around the world, and unfortunately right here at home. Nowhere in the United States have these hateful and divisive ideas been more prevalent or found a safer home than on college campuses.\n\nIt’s up to all of us to call out these actions and protect Jewish faculty, students, staff at these institutions. Unfortunately, many of our university leaders have not met this moment, and have allowed antisemitism to continue to grow and to rear its ugly head. President Magill, does the University of Pennsylvania have in place any policies to ensure that each student who is enrolled at the University receives information on the history of anti Semitism, how anti Semitism presents itself, and actions students can take to prevent and report anti-Semitic behavior?\n\nAnd why or why not?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss that. We are in the midst of making certain that all anti bigotry efforts ensure education about anti Semitism. We committed to that into September, and we’re working through that. We have added education — some parts of our program do and some parts of our program need to be enhanced.\n\nSo we’re working on that right now. And I assure you that we will make certain that that is included in all of our anti bigotry efforts — anti Semitism.\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: That is much appreciate. I wonder if that type of education would have been in place at all of our college campuses before this, whether we would have seen the mass of reactions that we have, that are just hard to describe and — and justify, in terms of- — of the demonstrations, and just the hate. As part of the recent protests on and around campus, there have been dozens of arrests made by university police, including several related terroristic threats.\n\nDoes the university plan on requiring students, faculty, or staff arrested as part of these protests to — to receive further education on anti-Semitic behavior?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Congressman, is that a question for me?\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: It is — I’m sorry, please.\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Well, we’re very committed to making sure everyone understands history and anti Semitism, for sure. The description of the arrests, I would need to learn a little bit more about.\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: Well, the requests that have occurred, are obviously, related to protests involving faculty or staff, students. You know, the question is, you know, within the consequences, when the university police are the ones that are — that are — that are intervening whether there’s any thoughts to further education for those individuals on — regarding anti-Semitic behavior and the impacts of it?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: It’s certainly consistent, with my perspective and my values and the institution’s values. I wonder if I could follow up with your team about the specifics of these arrests, because they are — I’m not — I don’t know exactly what you’re speaking about. But I agree with you, that anyone who was arrested for an activity that was anti-Semitic, some act or something else — harassment, intimidation — should certainly receive education, in addition to other consequences, in my —\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: For some criminal activity, they were arrested for that was obviously driven by anti-Semitic beliefs and expressions. Several faculty members at Penn recently provided support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, or the BDS movement. The movement requires boycotting Israeli universities and individuals who are complicit in what they consider Israeli government misconduct.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for a faculty member to support BDS and treat Israeli academics fairly. Can you tell this committee, unequivocally, that no such discrimination has taken place?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: I appreciate the opportunity to clarify a very clear position that the University of Pennsylvania has had for many years, which is we strongly oppose boycotting divesting and sanctioning Israel. We have many flourishing academic — it’s contrary to academic freedom, among other things. It’s singling out one state and treating it differently than others.\n\nWe have many academic collaborations with universities in Israel. We — they’re terrific collaborations. We have absolutely — we’re very clear on BDS. We are opposed to it. And our practices make that clear.\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: So as a part of that — and I’m a strong supporter of the right to free speech, including on college campuses — does University of Pennsylvania having policies and procedures in place to ensure that BDS supporters cannot implement their boycott positions, in their official capacities, or not giving such individuals administrative powers to begin with?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Well, it’s the position of the institution that we do not engage in boycotting, sanctioning, or divesting. And I would think that would followed for any member of the organization who is acting in their official capacity. But if you have specifics that I could follow up on after this hearing, I would very much like to hear them.\n\nGLENN THOMPSON: I will do that. Appreciate it. Thank you, Madam Chair.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Ms. Bonamici, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nSUZANNE BONAMICI: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the witnesses. I appreciate the full committee’s focus on this issue. I want to reiterate, as I did in the other hearing we had recently, that anti-Semitism, as well as Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry based on race, ethnicity, national origin or religion, are abhorrent and must not be tolerated.\n\nI’m deeply troubled by recent anti-Semitic incidents at colleges and universities across the country, including those whose presidents are here today. And I stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in calling for proactive steps from all of these institutions of higher education to root out discrimination, hatred, and bigotry in all of its forms.\n\nI also want to note that the main point of this hearing should be to identify bipartisan solutions to combat anti-Semitism, not an excuse to attack higher education, liberal arts education, or important diversity, equity, and inclusion work that’s happening at colleges and universities across the country.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns about anti-Semitism on college campuses, and that’s what we should focus on today. Not doing so is a disservice to the students across the country who are looking to Congress for support for the — and the public for the institutions. So during the previous hearing, I highlighted my support for additional funding for the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, and I want to join Representative Courtney in repeating that request today.\n\nOCR will be better able to enforce Title VI violations and protect student civil rights, with adequate staff and investigatory capacity. So I want to make that clear. We must — we must do that. Dr. Nadell, thank you for — for being here and for your work over the years. Public colleges and universities, as we know, must uphold constitutional free speech rights.\n\nAnd many private institutions also recognize the value of free speech and robust debate. I think all of our presidents recognize that today, but also with the understanding that schools cannot allow their campuses to become places where anti-Semitic speech makes students unsafe or feel unsafe. I think that’s a recognized.\n\nSo Dr. Nadell, what are some of the best ways that colleges and universities can work to make their campuses welcome, safe, and inclusive spaces for all students, in light of incidences of hate speech and discrimination, while also adhering to First Amendment principles?\n\nPAMELA NADELL: So thank you for the question. I think there are different forms and different venues for expanding this discussion of the very difficult issue that has sparked and ignited the anti Semitism, or the outbursts on college campuses that we’ve been seeing since October 7th. So one form, obviously, is the classroom, although, I would remind the members of — of the committee that the reality is that, most students during their college career, they take a handful of courses.\n\nMany of them are studying STEM, and most of them are actually never in classrooms where they’re hearing a discussion of issues like antisemitism or the conflict in Israel and Palestine. So that’s the first thing that I would point out. So academics, we — academics can continue to foster those conversations, and we need to take them outside of the classroom.\n\nI think the other place where there can really be a lot of work done that would be very successful, is on the side of student life on campus. And so student organizations are — they — they range broadly and widely on the campus, everything from a gardening club to, obviously, some of the student organizations that have been involved in the protests against — against Israel.\n\nSo these are other places —\n\nSUZANNE BONAMICI: Dr. Nadell, I don’t want to cut you off, but I have to get another question in, and I’m running out of time.\n\nPAMELA NADELL: Oh, yeah, sure. Ok.\n\nSUZANNE BONAMICI: But thank you for your work. And I also want to recognize, as well, the AJC Action Plan for Confronting Campus Anti-Semitism. President Gay, I understand that there’s an ongoing investigation of your institution by OCR, because of anti-Semitic incidents that occurred on campus. and I know we’ll be closely monitoring the outcome.\n\nBut in the interim and over the long term, what can Congress do to support your institution and other colleges in preventing discrimination? And also, if you could — could also respond, in the brief time, you mentioned that Harvard will not permit speech that incites violence or threatens safety. And I’d like you also to address who decides that and how, and in what time frame?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you, Congressman — women for your — for your questions. You’re correct that there is an ongoing investigation and, obviously, I can’t comment on an active investigation, other than to say we will work with the office to answer all of their questions. And I will say the work of the office is vitally important for ensuring students have access to educational opportunities.\n\nSo I fully support that the work that they do, and hope that the office gets the resources that it needs to be effective. With respect to student — I believe the question was about student conduct — so again, we are deeply committed to free expression. But when speech crosses over into conduct that violates our policies — policies against bullying, harassment, intimidation — we do take action.\n\nAnd we do have faculty led student disciplinary processes that are quite robust. And even over the last couple of months, as there have been incidents, we have — we’ve been leaning into those processes. And we do have disciplinary actions underway.\n\nSUZANNE BONAMICI: Thank you. My time is expired. I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: I now recognized Mr. Walberg for five minutes.\n\nTIM WALBERG: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thanks to the panel for being here. These are difficult times and difficult subjects, but they need to be addressed, because leadership matters. And you are leaders in academia at your institutions, as well. And leadership matters. President Gay, I was taken by some words in your — your opening statement, where you said, cure for antisemitism is knowledge.\n\nI would — I would go where angels fear to tread, and suggest that it might be better — going back to the original motto idea for Harvard, which was Veritas, truth that the cure for anti-Semitic — Semitism is not simply knowledge, it’s truth. Knowledge puffs up, knowledge sometimes based upon falsehoods.\n\nI think that’s what we’re facing right now. In the climate on campuses, is that we’re missing the fact of truth and allowing, under the guise of free speech, knowledge that isn’t true, to be exhibited in actions, as well. So, President Gay, in the weeks since October 7th, and again in your testimony, you have said that Harvard’s commitment to free speech extends to views that are objectionable or outrageous.\n\nAre you aware that Harvard is ranked dead last on the 2024 Foundation of Individual Rights and Expression Scorecard of Universities on Freedom of Speech?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you, Congressman, for the question. Respectfully, I disagree with that perspective, as represented in the report that you cited. I don’t think it’s an accurate representation of how Harvard treats speech on campus. We are committed to free expression and to making space for a wide range of views and perspectives on our campus.\n\nThis is —\n\nTIM WALBERG: With all due respect, let —\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: — this is — this is bedrock.\n\nTIM WALBERG: — me move on a bit. I would expect that you wouldn’t agree with that. I understand that. And I would expect that the University of Penn, the same would be true, that you wouldn’t agree that you’re second to last on that same scorecard. But President Gay, did you know that 70 percent of Harvard students say that shouting down a speaker is acceptable?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: That is not Ok.\n\nTIM WALBERG: I appreciate that. It seems that, perhaps, Harvard’s commitment to free speech is pretty selective. As you are no doubt aware, prominent alumnus, Bill Ackman tweeted you a letter on Sunday. And in that letter, and I have that tweet — guess that’s the beauty of social media. You can get those things. In that letter, he highlighted two cases of Harvard faculty members who were canceled, because of views deemed too controversial for your campus.\n\nTyler J. Van der Wiel was deemed guilty for those crimes, related to his views on marriage and abortion. And then, Carl — Carroll Hooven, an evolutionary biologist, was forced to resign, because she stated that a person’s sex is biological and binary. Mr. Ackerman’s letter also included quotes from a number of faculty, highlighting the culture of fear that pervades Harvard’s campus for those with views out of step with campus orthodoxy.\n\nAnd so, President Gay, in what world is a call for violence against Jews protected speech, but a belief that sex is biological and binary isn’t?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you for your question. So from the moment that our students arrive on campus, whether it is to begin their Harvard journey as an undergraduate, or at one of the professional schools, the message to them is clear — that we are an inclusive community but one deeply committed to free expression. And that means that we have expectations that that right is exercised mindfully and with empathy towards others.\n\nWe reinforce that during their time at Harvard, by helping them build the skills that allow them to engage in constructive dialogue, even on the most complex and divisive issues. Because what we seek is not simply free expression, but the reasoned dialogue that leads to truth and discovery and that does the work of moving us all forward.\n\nWe don’t always get it right in our students don’t always get it right —\n\nTIM WALBERG: But you are professors — — and when they transgress, they’re held accountable. — come under that, as well, don’t they? Your professors come under that as well, don’t they?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Absolutely.\n\nTIM WALBERG: And so, for Professor Van der Weil and Hooven, that didn’t work for them — the free expression of views, at the very least views, whether fact or truth, I guess we’ll leave that to understanding. But nonetheless, they were removed from their positions. And I think that sends a message, a message in this case with Jewish students, that there are less importance.\n\nI yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Mr. Takano, you are recognized for five minutes?\n\nMARK TAKANO: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you to our witnesses for being here. I do wish we could meet under different circumstances. President Gay, many individuals hold that Harvard did not condemn the attack against Israel swiftly enough. And I’d like to give you an opportunity to briefly to react. Can you tell us why the university did not react as quickly as other universities might have, or others might have hoped Harvard would have?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you, Congressman, for the — for the question. And — and respectfully, the — the notion that Harvard did not react is not correct. From the moment I learned of the attacks on October 7th, I was focused on action to ensure that our students were supported and safe. On that first day, we were focused on identifying whether we had any students or faculty who were in Israel and needed our assistance, including in getting out.\n\nOn October 8th, I joined students and other members of the Jewish community at Harvard Hillel for a solidarity dinner, to be there in support and also to learn more what their needs were. In the days after, not only did I condemn the attacks, I’ve continued to condemn the attacks, and furthermore, have continued to stay in conversation with our Jewish community on campus about their evolving needs, so that — to ensure that the university is providing them with the support that they need during this very challenging time.\n\nMARK TAKANO: Thank you, President Gay. Do you consider yourself as subject matter expert on anti-Semitic behavior?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Excuse me, could you repeat that question? I did not —\n\nMARK TAKANO: Do you consider yourself an expert on anti-Semitic behavior — subject matter expert?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: No, I don’t. But I know this — that anti-Semitism is hate or suspicion of Jews. And that is all I need to know to take action to address it on our campus.\n\nMARK TAKANO: Thank you. Real quickly, other than President — Professor Nadell, are there — do the other witnesses consider themselves to be experts on anti-Semitism, just a simple yes or no?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: No, I do not.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: No, I do not, but I learn.\n\nMARK TAKANO: Thank you. Well, my point is that, this is the second legislative hearing on this topic in a month, and the majority has failed to bring forth any witnesses who can speak on how to address this issue, and how to take concrete steps to combat anti-Semitism. President gay, it is my understanding that you have communicated to the Harvard community some of the specific steps you are implementing to combat anti-Semitism, and continue to foster student and community engagement.\n\nYou’ve already mentioned a few of the things that you’ve done since September 8th, but can you highlight some of these steps?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you for the question. So I’ve had repeated communications with the campus community about the steps that we’re taking, both immediate steps and longer term action, towards combating antisemitism. To begin, we’ve focused on enhancing the physical safety of the campus and the campus community. That includes an increased police presence, both plainclothes and uniformed officers, 24, seven threat monitoring, both on campus and online, coordination, on a daily basis, with state, local and federal law enforcement.\n\nAnd when necessary, we’ve taken the steps of closing the gates to Harvard Yard to limit the ability of outside actors to use our campus as a platform. We’ve also made it easier for students, or any community member, to report concerns and any kind of conduct that is — is threatening. We’ve also enhanced counseling and mental health services including trauma-informed care.\n\nWe’ve created community spaces so that students and faculty and staff can gather and to be together to process the tragedy. We’re also working on —\n\nMARK TAKANO: Excuse me, President Gay. Thank you. Are these actions only intended to assist Jewish students?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: These are resources that we’re making broadly available to our community, but we’re being particularly mindful to make sure that they are responsive to the needs of our Jewish community, as well as our Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian students who are also experiencing tremendous grief and are also fearful and distraught during this time.\n\nMARK TAKANO: President Gay universities stand as centers of thought, and it is of the utmost importance to strike a balance between First Amendment speech protections and the safety of students and faculty. But when speech crosses into the line of conduct — crosses the line into conduct, is it — it’s essential that universities act swiftly.\n\nHarvard is a private university. And private IHEs have — have different parameters to operate under — than public IHEs. Does this give Harvard a pass to avoid protecting free speech?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: We are deeply committed to protecting free expression, even of views that we find objectionable and outrageous and offensive. But when that expression crosses into conduct, that violates our policies around bullying, harassment, intimidation, threats, we take action and we do not hesitate to take action.\n\nMARK TAKANO: Thank you. My time is up and I yield back to the chair. Thank you.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Mr. Takano. Mr. Grothman, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Thank you. I’m going to follow up on some of the things Mr. Wilson had to say. Just playing around here a little bit on the internet — in 2016, they found about 2 percent of the faculty of Harvard were — viewed President Trump, I think, is Ok or good. And I think in the 2020 election, the Crimson, your local paper there, found 1 percent of the students voting for Donald Trump, which given that nationwide, it is about 50, 50 was kind of shocking.\n\nDoes it concern you at all, that you apparently have a great deal, a lack of ideological diversity at Harvard? And you think that atmosphere is maybe one of the reasons why there seems to be such an outbreak of anti-Semitism at your institution?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Is that — is that question for me?\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: It’s a question for you. And I’ll ask you, what are you — what are you going to do about it? Do you think it’s a concern?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: We — so we — we strive to have as diverse a faculty as we — as we can, because we want to make sure that we are sampling from the broadest pool of talent available in the world. That’s how we ensure academic excellence. And then —\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I — from what I read here, maybe I’m just — they are making stuff up, but I don’t think they’re making it up. We said 2 percent of your faculty viewed Donald Trump as something [inaudible] poor. In 2016, and after four years of working for diversity, 1 percent voted for him. Now I know all sorts of good people who don’t like President Trump.\n\nBut I’m just saying, when you compare the way people think at your campus, compared to America as a whole, if there’s one thing you are — it’s not diverse. Right? Do you consider that a problem, or the numbers I gave you?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: So, Congressman, I can’t speak to the specific data that you are referring to. What I can say is, that at Harvard, we try to create as much space as possible for a wide range of views and perspectives, because we believe that allows for a thriving academic community.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Well, how in the world is that even possible, and that that you’re trying to do that? Do you really feel that you’re — that your faculty are ideologically diverse? You came out of a, what was it a, political science background at Stanford?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: At Stanford as an undergraduate, as an economics major. And then, for my PhD, it was a PhD in political science.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Political science, that’s what I thought. Did you experience what you would say, given America’s divided now 50, 50, about 50, 50, or was it 75,25, or 90,10, regard — regarding to more constitutional conservative perspective, or more of a left wing perspective? What is your experience, both at Harvard and Stanford?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: So here’s what I can say on the topic that you’re exploring. And it’s — we want the most brilliant, talented faculty to come to Harvard and to build their careers there. And then —\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Ok, they only give me five — you’re not going to answer the question, and they only give me five minutes. Is it common at Harvard to ask faculty to submit a diversity statement?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: That’s a practice that varies across schools at Harvard.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: So sometimes you do? Well —\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: In some cases, there are schools that ask for that.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Ok. Could a scientist ever get cut from consideration for from a job, because they had the wrong view of diversity?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: What I would say, is that we aim to draw to our faculty, the broadest pool of talent.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Yeah, Ok. But when you hear that — and this is not the way I wanted this to go. But when you hear that 1 percent of your faculty voted for a presidential candidate who got about 50 percent of the vote, nationwide, does that concern you, or do you feel you’re not as diverse as you should be?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: What I’m focused on, is making sure that we’re bringing the most academically talented faculty to our campus and that they are effective in the classroom.\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Ok. I get one more question, because I want to go to go to the gal from Penn. Has Harvard ever made a faculty job contingent on a strong diversity statement?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: We look at everything a faculty member will bring to our campus — academic brilliance and excitement and ability to teach a campus community and student community that is diverse —\n\nGLENN GROTHMAN: Ok. Now I want to go to Ms. Magill. I have a friend whose son goes to the University of Pennsylvania. Right now, he is physically afraid to go to the library at night. Ok? Just unbelievable. Could you — I just can’t even conceive that it’s going on in the United States of America. But that’s what she tells me, and she doesn’t make it up. Could you give us your reasons as to why that is true in Pennsylvania?\n\nWhy, today, a Jewish student is afraid to walk to the library at night?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Congressman, let me start by saying I’m devastated to hear that. And the safety and security of our campus, and our students in particular, is my top concern. I would — if you would be willing, I would like to talk to your constituent and their — their Penn student. I’m very troubled by what you’re reporting.\n\nIt’s our top priority to keep our students safe and secure.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: I’m going to have to ask you to follow up on that with Mr. Grothman, and with the rest of the committee. Mr. Adams, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And thank you to the witnesses for coming today and to testify before the committee. But before I get started, I want to just thank you for your service to students and to the university community. Dr. Nadell, this question is for you. I’m glad, first of all, to see another Buckeye here, Ohio State.\n\nBut as a former professor at a small college in North Carolina, Bennett College, for over 40 years, I taught there, I am deeply disappointed by the rise of anti Semitism rhetoric that’s happening across the country. Anti-Semitism has no place on our college campuses or anywhere. And it’s been my mission to combat instances of anti-Semitism and hate and racism alike.\n\nThere are Jewish students across this country that are afraid to leave their dorms, afraid to step on campus, because of the hateful rhetoric that’s infiltrated our schools. So this question is to actually all the Presidents, but I did want Dr. Nadel. to answer first. Students should be able to express their views and opinions without fear of retaliation.\n\nHow are you balancing the protection of free speech, academic freedom, with the need to also oppose normalizing anti Semitism attitudes that are radical and dangerous? And if we could just briefly answer that, I want to hear from the president’s on this.\n\nPAMELA NADELL: Sure. So just briefly, obviously, we need to protect free speech, but we also need to protect the safety of our students on campus. And you used the word normalizing antisemitism. And the problem is anti-Semitism has been normalized in the nation, not just on campus.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you. Dr. Gay?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you. I’d say education is the key here, making students, and frankly, the entire campus community more aware of the insidiousness of antisemitism, so that they’re in a position to be able to recognize antisemitic tropes when they see them, and confront them in the moment.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you.\n\nLIZ MAGILL: I appreciate the question. At — at Penn, our policies are guided by the US Constitution. So our long standing open, expression guidelines follow the Constitution.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: I think, in addition to education, which I agree with, so that students are — and faculty and staff can identify and combat antisemitic tropes and speech, I think it’s important to call out antisemitism in a very visible and public way and a specific way in order to make clear what the — how it’s contrary to the values of the institution where we’re talking about speech alone.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you. So, Title 6provisions set the standard for what should be done to address racism hate crimes and violence on campuses. Do you think that your DEI departments are equipped with the tools to combat antisemitism or hate on your campus? And if not, what changes do you plan to make? This is for all the president’s.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: I can jump in here.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Yes, um-hum.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Yes, so our diversity equity and inclusion staff are absolutely charged with making the campus welcoming for all students and that absolutely includes our Jewish and Israeli students. We absolutely see antisemitism as an inclusion issue. We’re making sure that our staff who are dedicated to diversity equity and inclusion are being trained about antisemitism.\n\nBut you know, it goes well beyond that staff. It’s important that our leadership understands antisemitism that our students and faculty understand antisemitism. And I’ll just say one thing about MIT, we can make as many top down initiatives as we want, but the heartening thing is that the discussion of antisemitism and indeed, Islamophobia is now proceeding at a grassroots level at MIT.\n\nALMA ADAMS: So, can we hear from — thank you very much. Next president?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Our anti-bigotry efforts are also informed by a desire to make certain every person at the university feels welcome and can thrive. And that includes communities of faith and ethnicity. That’s the value we have. And we’re making sure that is from the top of the organization all through the organization. And I believe over the longer term — that’s sort of an immediate action over the longer term, making sure the entire community is discussing, understanding and capable of calling out and combating antisemitism when they see it.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you. Madam president?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Our DEI office is a resource for the entire community. And the professionals in that office are committed to ensuring that everyone feels a sense of belonging. But in building on an observation that President Kornbluth made, this is a shared responsibility that doesn’t vest strictly in the hands of our DEI professionals, but it really is work that needs to be taken up by the entire community, the leadership for sure, but also the faculty and the students and — and also doing the work.\n\nALMA ADAMS: Thank you very much. I’m out of time. Madam Chair, I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Ms. Stefanik, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Dr. Gay, a Harvard student calling for the mass murder of African Americans is not protected free speech at Harvard, correct?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Our commitment to free speech —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: That’s a yes or no question. Is that correct? Is that Ok for students to call for the mass murder of African Americans at Harvard? Is that protected free speech?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Our commitment to free speech —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: It’s a yes or no question. Let me ask you this. You are president of Harvard, so I assume you’re familiar with the term intifada, correct?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I’ve heard that term, yes.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: And you understand that the use of the term intifada in the context of the Israeli Arab conflict is indeed a call for violent armed resistance against the state of Israel, including violence against civilians and the genocide of Jews. Are you aware of that?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: That type of hateful speech is personally abhorrent to me.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: And there have been multiple marches at Harvard with students chanting quote, “there is only one solution intifada revolution.” And quote, “globalize the intifada.” Is that correct?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I’ve heard that thoughtless, reckless and hateful language on our campus, yes.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: So, based upon your testimony, you understand that this call for intifada is to commit genocide against the Jewish people in Israel and globally, correct?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I will say again that type of hateful speech is personally abhorrent to me.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s code of conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: It is at odds with the values of Harvard. But our values also —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Can you not say here that it is against the code of conduct at Harvard?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: We embrace a commitment to free expression, even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful. It’s when that speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies against bullying, harassment —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Does that speech not cross that barrier? Does that speech not call for the genocide of Jews and the elimination of Israel?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: When —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: You testify that you understand that it’s the definition of intifada. Is that speech according to the code of conduct or not?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: We embrace a commitment to free expression and give a wide berth to free expression even of views that are objectionable —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: You and I both know that’s not the case. You were aware that Harvard ranked dead last when it came to free speech. Are you not aware of that report?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: As I observed earlier, I reject that characterization.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: It’s — the data shows it’s true. And isn’t it true that Harvard previously rescinded multiple offers of admissions for applicants and accepted freshmen for sharing offensive memes, racist statements, sometimes as young as 16 years old? Did Harvard not rescind those offers of admission?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: That long predates my time as president, so I can’t —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: But you understand that Harvard made that decision to rescind those offers of admission.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I have no reason to contradict the facts as you present them.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Correct, because it’s a fact. You’re also aware that a Winthrop House faculty dean was let go over he — over who he chose to legally represent, correct? That was while you were dean.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: That is an incorrect characterization of what transpired.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: What’s the characterization?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I’m not going to get into details about a personnel matter.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Well, let me ask you this, will admissions offers be rescinded or any disciplinary action be taken against students or applicants who say from the river to the sea or intifada advocating for the murder of Jews?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: As I’ve said that type of hateful reckless offensive speech is personally abhorrent to me.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: [inaudible] today that no action will be taken — what action will be taken?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: When speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies, including policies against bullying, harassment or intimidation, we take action. And we have robust disciplinary processes that allow us to hold individuals accountable.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: What action has been taken against students who are harassing and calling for the genocide of Jews on Harvard’s campus?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I can assure you we have robust —\n\nELISE STEFANIK: What actions have been taken? I’m not asking —\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: What actions underway?\n\nELISE STEFANIK: I’m asking what actions have been taken against those students.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Given students’ rights to privacy and our obligations under FERPA, I will not say more about any specific cases other than to reiterate that processes are ongoing.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: Do you know what the number one hate crime in America is?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: I know that over the last couple of months there has been an alarming rise of antisemitism, which I understand is the critical topic that we are here to discuss.\n\nELISE STEFANIK: That’s correct. It is anti-Jewish hate crimes. And Harvard ranks the lowest when it comes to protecting Jewish students. This is why I’ve called for your resignation. And your testimony today, not being able to answer with moral clarity, speaks volumes. I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: The gentlewoman yields back. Mr. Norcross is not here. Ms. Jayapal, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nPRAMILA JAYAPAL: Thank you, Madam Chair. The Anti-Defamation League found that reports of antisemitism have nearly quadrupled since this point last year. And we’re seeing that reflected on college campuses with Jewish students reporting that they feel unsafe. No student should feel unsafe. I think we all agree antisemitism and indeed all forms of hate have to be rejected everywhere.\n\nAnd while all of you, as college administrators have a responsibility to condemn hate and acts of hate in all its forms, including antisemitism, I know that you also face the challenge of and the responsibility of ensuring that people can engage in healthy debates of ideas in a way that fosters safety and inclusion for everyone.\n\nSo I want to thank you for your commitment’s to work to ensure a continued diversity of perspectives on your campuses, a diversity of faculty with varied lived experiences. I know that my Republican colleagues have been trying to attack DEI initiatives including the funding for those initiatives for some time.\n\nAnd I hope that that is clear in terms of some of the comments that have been made. I want to just give Dr. Gay 30 seconds to — to respond to anything given the line of questioning that you had right before in case you wanted to say anything before I go to my lines of question.\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you for the opportunity, but I’m satisfied that I’ve conveyed our deep commitment to free expression recognizing that it’s uncomfortable.\n\nPRAMILA JAYAPAL: Thank you, Dr. Gay. Dr. Kornbluth, your institution is one of many that has responded to incidents between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine groups. Many college campuses have been grappling with their responses to prevent antisemitism to prevent Islamophobia and other forms of hate while also making sure that every student feels safe to express their thoughts in accordance with the principles of free speech and to engage in the idea of critical thought on college campuses, which I think is what many of us appreciated about our college experiences.\n\nCan you speak to the challenges that you’ve faced in condemning hate and acts of hate while making sure that students were heard? And also, just want to appreciate the distinction that you made in one of your comments between what we can say and what we should say. And — and just say that frankly, I think there’s been an explosion, thanks to the previous president in part that has shattered the norms of what is acceptable to say.\n\nAnd we’re dealing with some of the effects of that. But what challenges have you faced in condemning hate and acts of hate while making sure students were heard?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Thank you so much. You know, and I have to say —\n\nPRAMILA JAYAPAL: And if you could just pull that microphone right up to you, that would be great.\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Thank you. You know, I have to say my — my absolute goal is to ensure the safety of students and the continuity of our research and educational missions. And these recent events have troubled me deeply. And we have mobilized as a campus. I think the most important thing is first knowledge to understand that, as I mentioned in a previous answer, that our leadership, our students and our faculty have to have knowledge.\n\nBut way more importantly right now is these students are thrown together in classrooms and laboratories and dormitories every day. This is where the dialog is taking place. And we have to ensure that they have the tools for constructive communication across differences. We are bringing these discussions to the dormitories.\n\nWe have a center for construction — constructive engagement where the students are going to be able to have small roundtable discussions with each other. We have funded and mobilized — and I cannot tell you how wonderful our faculty have been. They’ve just issued a statement from 300 faculty about unity and working together with the students.\n\nAnd so, there have been lunches. There have been meetings for our Israeli and Jewish students with Jewish faculty for our Arab and Muslim students with Arab and Muslim faculty. But now they’re working to figure out how to bring them together. If we’re all going to live and work together productively, we have to move beyond, you know, formal training which we are committed to but to actual real dialog and to actually model constructive and civil dialog for our students.\n\nThat’s what being in a university is all about.\n\nPRAMILA JAYAPAL: Very powerful. Professor Nadell, the — the — these challenges of protecting free speech while denouncing antisemitism, Islamophobia, all forms of hate that’s not unique to MIT or to the institutions that are here. Can you speak to the same question of facility — the most effective ways to facilitate education and dialog to ease tensions at other — other colleges and in general?\n\nPAMELA NADELL: The most effective ways — and obviously, I very much appreciate your question because this is happening across the United States on colleges and campuses small and large. And the most effective ways are to recognize the many different levels and mechanisms for facilitating these dialogs at the student level, at the faculty level, at the administrative level.\n\nAnd bringing the — how to unite the campus, bringing the campus together. That’s what we’re all trying to do. And it doesn’t happen overnight.\n\nPRAMILA JAYAPAL: Thank you all so much for your work. I yield back, Madam Chair.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you. Mr. Allen, you’re recognized for five minutes.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: Thank you, Madam Chair and I want to thank each of you for being here today. And first — and my colleague earlier asked the question, you know, what is the truth? Of course, that question was asked 2000 years ago at Pilot. And — and of course, you know, obviously knowledge is important. But what about wisdom?\n\nIn full disclosure, I am a student and believe in God of the Bible and His word. In the House of Representatives, we — we are without excuse. We have, above the American flag, In God We Trust. Really? And then we have the full face of Moses looking down on the entire body who gave us the first five books of the Bible.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: Let me tell you how serious this issue is. In 1885 BC, BC not AD, BC, the Bible says Genesis 12:3, I will bless — talking about Israel, I will bless those who bless you. And whoever curses you, I will curse. And all peoples of the Earth would be blessed through you. That is a serious, serious promise. In fact, we heard one of the panelists talk about the Jesus of the Bible.\n\nand of course, our church, was founded by Jesus, who was a Jew, the American Church. In fact, the church throughout the — the world. You know, this is the Committee of Education and Workforce. Illiteracy — illiteracy is the number one problem in our workforce. But I think from a standpoint of truth, biblical illiteracy is the number one problem in America.\n\nWe are a biblically illiterate society. We have no idea about these promises that are ancient in this book that the prophecies, every one of them has come to fruition. Every single one of them. So with that, Dr. Magill like so many others, I have been extremely disappointed — or I’m sorry, Dr. Kornbluth.\n\nKornbluth, is that correct?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Kornbluth.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: Ok. At MIT, Israeli and Jewish students were blocked from attending class by pro-Palestinian protests at the school’s main entrance. The protest violated campus — campus rules when the school ordered all protesters to leave the area or face suspension. The contingent Jewish counter protesters left. The pro-Palestinian stayed.\n\nCan you explain how that is fair to Jewish American citizens whose rights are being violated, when you said, because we later heard serious concerns about collateral consequences for students such as visas and that sort of thing? Can you explain yourself there?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Yes, thank you very much for the opportunity. I have to say when we started this protest, when the protest rather was started, I ordered a police present to ensure safety. And we de-escalated when it was prudent. In a very tense situation among students, we avoided altercations and we kept everyone safe.\n\nAnd we are now entering into a process of ensuring accountability. Now with respect to the consequences. We strive for outcomes that are proportional to the transgression, in this case, violation of our time, place and manner rules for demonstration. I want to make one comment though about people attending classes.\n\nFirst of all, at no time —\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: Well, and I’m limited on time here, so could you submit that to us in writing?\n\nSALLY KORNBLUTH: Absolutely.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: I have another question here. In fact, you know, going back to talking about wisdom. Proverbs 9:10 says “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” And so, with that President Gay and President Magill, do either of you plan to suspend foreign students who violate the law or school policies?\n\nCLAUDINE GAY: Thank you for your question. Our international students are a vibrant part of our community and contribute significantly to Harvard strength and our real source of pride. But all of our students, irrespective of their citizenship, are held accountable to following our policies, including our policies around bullying, harassment and intimidation.\n\nAnd we hold them accountable for that.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: Ok. Well, Dr. Magill, if you’ll submit those in writing. And I have a few other questions I’d like for you all to answer. Thank you for being here.\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Yes, sir.\n\nRICK W. ALLEN: And, Chair, I yield back.\n\nVIRGINIA FOXX: Thank you, Mr. Allen. Ms. Wild, you recognized for five minutes.\n\nSUSAN WILD: Thank you, Madam Chair. I so wish that this hearing was one where we were having a robust intellectual discussion, taking advantage of the brilliant minds that we have in front of us about free speech, the limits of free speech and so forth. I fear that we have gotten away from that. I think the one thing that everybody in this room would agree on is that not all speech is protected or acceptable.\n\nFor example, when elected officials lie, that’s unacceptable. And that sometimes means that they — that they have to be removed from academic institutions where they may serve on boards, or in the case of Harvard, the senior advisory committee based on false claims of election fraud. But moving on to the subject of this hearing, let me just say as a Jewish mother of two students who are now fully launched and I had to send off to college not so many years ago, I am very, very sympathetic to the concerns of the students and the parents about their safety emotionally, physically and otherwise.\n\nBut — and it’s not just about antisemitism, it’s about all forms of hate speech, whether it’s anti-LGBT, Islamophobia, whatever it is. Racist language. Our students deserve a place of safety. And again, emotionally and physically. But at the same time, I think of college as the place where we learn to think critically.\n\nAnd to me that’s the most important part of going to college. So here we are in this — this strange balancing act. And I — believe me, I feel for all of you because it is a balancing act that you have to perform. So, at what point do we determine, or do you determine that speech is such that it incites violence, or it constitutes hate speech?\n\nAnd I’m going to ask President Magill from my home, state of Pennsylvania. You — you saw a video at the beginning of this. And to the extent that the protests at Penn were — were referenced, did you see that video as an example of — of hate speech or speech that would incite violence?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: I appreciate the question from the Representative from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I mean that — that video just as a human being was very hard to watch. The — the — the chanting, I think, calling for intifada global revolution very, very disturbing. And I can imagine many people’s reaction to that would be one of fear.\n\nSo I believe at a minimum that is — that is hateful speech that has been and should be condemned. Whether it rises to the level of incitement to violence under the policies that Penn and the city of Philadelphia follow, which are guided by the United States Constitution, I think is a much more difficult question.\n\nThe incitement to violence is — is a very narrow category.\n\nSUSAN WILD: So, let me just ask you there, if you became aware that a similar protest were — or rally or whatever you call it was going to be occurring on your campus tonight or tomorrow, how would you respond? What would your approach be?\n\nLIZ MAGILL: Well, our approach with all rallies, vigils and protests is that our public safety officers and something called open expression observers are — present at all of them. We have a long standing open expression policy that makes sure our open expression policies are followed. So, I would make sure that those people were there.\n\nThe — our public safety officers usually try to speak to the organizers of the conference and talk to them about what our rules are about — about protests.
