        "text": "Yesterday, I got my copy of Dr. Moya Bailey‚Äôs new book, Misogynoir Transformed: Black Women‚Äôs Digital Resistance, and I was so excited that I immediately sat down to read it, and began live tweeting my reactions. My fangirl thread caught the attention of Dr. Bailey, who then asked if I was going to do the whole book. I was absolutely going to live tweet the whole book. What follows is the thread (original link here) of my reactions to reading Misogynoir Transformed for the first time:\n\nSo just a few days after I had a melt down about my mental health as a BW, I read this question: ‚ÄúCan a person achieve the WHO definition of health if they encounter racism, sexism, ableism, and other oppressions as a part of their daily life in the world?‚Äù (12) @moyazb\n\nIt continues: ‚ÄúThe stress and material co sequences of system oppression make it nearly impossible to have physical, mental, and social well-being in a white supremacist patriarchal country.‚Äù (12) Misogynoir Transformed\n\nI needed to read this because I felt insane. Just the other day, I said to a friend, if I die, it will be because of the impacts of stress and anxiety and depression on my life that no one believed when I tried to explain it to them. I don‚Äôt think my bipolar/anxiety can manifest as it does in the DSM bc I‚Äôm a Black woman\n\nTherefore, you simply just have to believe when I say I need help. Because if a Black woman says she needs help, you have to know immediately that it‚Äôs bad because we are socialized via media messaging and upbringing to swallow EVERYTHING.\n\nMore things that I love about Misogynoir Transformed:\n\nDigital alchemy in multiple formations. It can be defensive, Bailey argues, which actively fights back against instance of misogynoir online; and it can be generative, which pushes past and desires new forms of representation\n\nI also appreciate the break down of how this book centers Black women AND Black queer folks, trans folks and GNC folks, which are voices often pushed to the margins of Black gender studies work on Black women/girls. It‚Äôs a great model for how to do that with care.\n\nRelatedly, the ‚ÄúNot all Black women are Black feminists, and not all Black feminists are women,‚Äù is gonna blow some folks‚Äô minds üòÇ\n\nThis intro is giving, ‚ÄúGet in losers, we‚Äôre troubling the assumed heteronormativity of Black women,‚Äù (29) and I love it, let me be gathered\n\nhttps://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-3755072543989337&output=html&h=280&adk=3112109425&adf=384685906&pi=t.aa~a.1695081512~i.21~rp.4&w=700&fwrn=4&fwrnh=100&lmt=1620566887&num_ads=1&rafmt=1&armr=3&sem=mc&pwprc=7152865607&psa=1&ad_type=text_image&format=700√ó280&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthreadreaderapp.com%2Fthread%2F1391033003569295361.html&flash=0&fwr=0&pra=3&rh=175&rw=700&rpe=1&resp_fmts=3&wgl=1&fa=27&adsid=ChEI8JDehAYQ2N3busyhk8GhARI7ABMrMNBf22comlRUgQVfWXD2NoQxJOencUsjcvdU-L_SXHHUOoNzuOO4q9yJs8tYlgV-XgS5AqMJFqQ&uach=WyJtYWNPUyIsIjEwXzEyXzYiLCJ4ODYiLCIiLCI4OS4wLjQzODkuOTAiLFtdXQ..&dt=1620566887283&bpp=3&bdt=1763&idt=4&shv=r20210505&cbv=%2Fr20190131&ptt=9&saldr=aa&abxe=1&cookie=ID%3Dd1465a6e39c51266-228c5eefd5b90067%3AT%3D1620081792%3ART%3D1620081792%3AS%3DALNI_MYOz36RwOshc0OjEjEfoFjkIdf_5g&prev_fmts=0x0%2C930x280%2C700x280&nras=3&correlator=8489449636628&frm=20&pv=1&ga_vid=1366802080.1620081792&ga_sid=1620566887&ga_hid=1981383817&ga_fc=0&u_tz=-240&u_his=2&u_java=0&u_h=900&u_w=1440&u_ah=831&u_aw=1440&u_cd=24&u_nplug=3&u_nmime=4&adx=268&ady=2375&biw=1236&bih=661&scr_x=0&scr_y=309&eid=42530671%2C44739521%2C31060710&oid=3&pvsid=404912114022373&pem=976&eae=0&fc=1408&brdim=147%2C23%2C147%2C23%2C1440%2C23%2C1236%2C829%2C1236%2C661&vis=1&rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&abl=NS&fu=128&bc=31&jar=2021-05-09-13&ifi=4&uci=a!4&btvi=2&fsb=1&xpc=Qt26DVixnQ&p=https%3A//threadreaderapp.com&dtd=148\n\nlove the chapter 1 title bc it deliberately calls in layers meaning making: ‚ÄúMisogynoir Is a Drag.‚Äù Its clever bc it mirrors: Misogynoir shows how layers of meaning are inextricable and drag‚Äôs multiple meanings are all necessary to understanding harm against BW.\n\nSpeaking of meaning making, let‚Äôs get into how Bailey sets up reading and dragging as direct linguistic descendants to signifying!!! (36)\n\nOne thing about Black folks, we love good words.\n\nHere‚Äôs something y‚Äôall probably don‚Äôt want hear today BUT: ‚ÄúBlack men in drag are able to use their portrayals of BW as a source of fatphobic, transphobic, homophobic, Misogynoiristic, and classist comedy that ultimately serves to discipline Black women.‚Äù (43)\n\nAnother read you probably didn‚Äôt want today BUT: ‚ÄúIt should be no surprise that toxic masculinity does not need a man to do it‚Äôs bidding.‚Äù (46)\n\nsome of the greatest perpetrators of harm to BW are us‚Ä¶Toni Morrison begged us not to participate in the oppression of our sisters üò¨\n\nThe thing that is very clear to me about Bailey‚Äôs work is that everybody is on notice. üòÇ masculinity and patriarchy is gone do what it and do and so sometimes, you will need to be gathered regardless of who you are and/or your identity. Everyone needs to be called in sometime ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è discussion time!\n\nThere‚Äôs an incident of police violence against a 15 yo Black girl captured and disseminated by a white boy; Bailey writes that this white boy engaged in defensive digital alchemy.\n\nWho can perform digital alchemy? Is it digital alchemy if it was unintentional? Moved onto Ch 2 on trans advocacy and am on p. 70 thinking about Janet Mock, realness, trauma and the Black women‚Äôs autobiographies.\n\nOne thing my students spoke about often this semester was BW trauma; I countered by offering that we should seize control of our stories + My thought, which is sort of reflected here, is that we absolutely don‚Äôt want other people to tell our stories for us bc of how we‚Äôre often rendered thru others‚Äô eyes‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre limited to trauma narratives; it just means BW should dictate how/if/when we share our pain I‚Äôm in p. 72-75 thinking about pageants + what does or does not make a digital alchemic act feminist.\n\nEverything Bailey says is true; but I know a Black girl who found pageants a way to learn to love herself. It was transformative for her. (Start 49:33)\n\nBailey prefacing #MisogynoirTransformed with a bit on how her intellectual pursuits shifted is important to me‚Äîoriginally she wanted to be an MD. It also makes me link the section on trans women‚Äôs health to @alondra‚Äôs Body & Soul. I read it with Prof Harold + think about it often\n\nReading the section on CeCe McDonald and am trying to figure out what the hell is up with Minneapolis?!\n\nEvery time someone asks if anyone still blogs or if blogging is dead, an Angel loses their wings. Ima read them: ‚ÄúBlogs are part of the digital woman of color feminist story as they serve as a space for building connection and understanding through the digital world.‚Äù (93)\n\nOn to Ch 3 on web series!\n\n‚ÄúDigital media makers are less concerned with creating content that reaches privileged out-group members than creating content for their own networks.‚Äù (104) Gotta call in my fav webseries @blackenough__ & my fav advocate of indie media @tayleighlamb\n\nSame page Bailey calls in worldbuilding, which is impt in my work which also centers fantasy. She argues that the liberatory worlds built in Black queer webseries are not utopias; this is also something I dealt with teaching. Fantasy =/= utopia. I don‚Äôt think liberation is utopia\n\nBut it‚Äôs hard right, bc I think what my students were grappling with was so much media that dehumanizes and is violent to their self, that they perhaps that their ideal reality was fantasy. Not quite the function of fantasy, which really, is to, momentarily, suspend disbelief.\n\nOkay so now I‚Äôm thinking about ‚ÄúQueerness becomes Taylor‚Äôs way to name her multifaceted desire.‚Äù (110) Bailey demonstrates how the openness of the webseries as a form offers more opportunity to showcase heterogeneity of Black queer life.\n\nBut I‚Äôm also thinking about naming. I‚Äôm drawn back to this moment when Bailey positions Janet Mock in a tradition of Black women autobiographers and what it means to be able to define the self, for the self, which again returns us to trauma‚Äîclaiming our agency means claiming our stories to do with what we see fit\n\nBUT ALSO, to return to this idea of openness of the webseries, she argues that they ‚Äúboth reinforce and challenge dominant ideas about sexuality.‚Äù\n\nI love this thing: ‚Äúboth/and.‚Äù\n\nI love that I have internalized multiple things can be true at once; it frees you up (An aside: I need to watch the episode of Skye‚Äôs the Limit where Mutha Indigo tells Skye she‚Äôs ‚Äúfeasting on scraps; little bits and pieces of ambiguous romance.‚Äù [113-114] because that was a read I absolutely was not prepared for.)\n\nOn p 127 when Bailey talks abt the group of friends in Between Women attempting harm reduction by not calling the police for their friend experiencing IPV, I immediately thought of abolition + what I learned from Mariame Kaba‚Äôs new book then the next sentence was about abolition!\n\nI‚Äôve been trying my best to read and engage with abolitionist words and sometimes my mind explodes at how deeply interconnected all the things I care about are and how their are no single issue struggles because we do not lead single issue lives. (Lorde)\n\nI‚Äôm just thinking about the seamless way Bailey lays bare IPV, abolition, queer relationships, toxic masculinity while also making claims about form as well as content‚Ä¶and bruh, I need to just hang it up now, aint no way I can ever write something like this üò≠\n\nChapter 3 is my favorite so far! Ugh. The talent.\n\nTime for another break then I‚Äôll resume. I think I‚Äôm just gonna read the whole rest ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nShit, chapter 4 is about Tumblr, guess I can‚Äôt stop now ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nBlack women, queer folks, GNC folks and trans folks use of social media sites will never not fascinate me mostly bc I am very much a Digital Black Girl‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and I feel seen when we talk about our online lives. Again, I quote ‚ÄúAlter Egos and Infinite Literacies,‚Äù by JMJ‚Ä¶every day\n\nOn p 150 reading the analysis of the interview w Tumblr user Danielle Cole + thinking so much about how I write for me, but also to be heard. Ofc I often cite, ‚ÄúI went online to try speak myself into existence by speaking to myself.‚Äù From Alter Egos & Infinite Literacies @jmjafrx\n\nThe reason Tumblr can be a space of generative digital alchemy is part due to design; the site is structured around shared interests, rather than offline connections, Bailey argues. Finding this space that explodes preconceived notions of Blackness + queerness blew my mind at 16\n\nTbh the difference between defensive digital alchemy and generative feels like the point I tried to make to my students all semester: identifying issues and raising awareness is a thing, AND if we know that it what we do not want, what *do* we want? How do we make it?\n\nYUP, so now Bailey argues that sites like Tumblr (and Twitter) are effective in being places to begin community conversations about issues like Misogynoir but it does not necessarily transform or combat the Misogynoir itself (154)\n\nI‚Äôm thinking so much about transformative justice in design now bc of this chapter and about all the conversations @tayleighlamb and I have about it‚Ä¶\n\nBut then it was followed by a section on personas, which is something that really fascinated me with BW in digital and IRL I‚Äôm obsessed with this article by Taylor Crumpton about Black women in rap‚Äôs alter egos!\n\nThe proud tradition of alter egos in female rapBoth Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj have announced new personas, continuing a culture of female rappers channelling unfiltered anger through fictional characters.https://theface.com/music/female-rap-alter-egos-beyonce-sasha-fierce-nicki-minaj-megan-thee-stallion-rico-nasty\n\n‚Äúgenerative digital alchemy becomes a praxis that transforms Misogynoir through what it facilitates.‚Äù (161)\n\nIf y‚Äôall thought I was obsessed with the idea of digital alchemy before‚Ä¶ On p. 166-167 and thinking about what would happen if we reckon with social media as the tool that is. It was something I struggled with early in my grad school career bc the people I met here were my life preservers; but the platform is the not the relationship, it facilitates. P 169, first full paragraph translation: ‚ÄúI miss when we read on the internet.‚Äù üåö\n\nIn citing her interview with Myers, Myers says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There are ways where Black women are ‚Äòappreciated‚Äô but it still feels‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt say appreciated. ‚ÄòRecognized,‚Äô ‚Äòcelebrated,‚Äô I guess, in the sense of visibility, but it can so quickly turn on its head.‚Äù + WHAT HAVE I BEEN TELLING YALL ABOUT ME FEELING USEFUL AND NOT LOVED?! I have been screaming it for the last few weeks and it‚Äôs RIGHT HERE IN THIS BOOK that we need BW women to be celebrated and appreciated AUTHENTICALLY. (170)\n\nWHEW, COME ON THEN\n\nWrapped chapter 4, so I‚Äôm just gonna go to the conclusion.\n\nI am already snapping because I still remember the first time I got dragged by a Black woman Professor publicly. Lisa Woolfork got me together on the *first* day of her class my second semester third year at UVA. A few quotes to leave you with from the conclusion:\n\n‚Äúwe need to continue to stretch our imaginations, because another world is not only possible, it is required for more than mere survival.‚Äù (178) ‚ÄúI love these imperfect & messy means for making something out of the scraps you have been given. But this practice of making a way out of no way is not sustainable. I envision a Black queer feminist future where we have what we need and Misogynoir is truly transformed‚Ä¶‚Äù (181) ‚ÄúEven as I work toward the end of Misogynoir, I know that it requires the transmutation of people.‚Äù (181) And fin.\n\nThank y‚Äôall for joining me in this day long live tweet of @moyazb‚Äôs #MisogynoirTransformed, available from @NYUpress (link below)\n\nI hope this thread gives you something to think about and inspires you to pick up Bailey‚Äôs book ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nnyupress.org/9781479865109/‚Ä¶\n\nMisogynoir TransformedWhere racism and sexism meet‚Äîan understanding of anti-Black misogynyWhen Moya Bailey first coined the term misogynoir, she defined it as the ways anti-Blac‚Ä¶https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/\n\nI‚Äôd already rearranged the syllabus for my spring 2021 Magical Black Girls class once‚Äì back in June when Bethany C. Morrow released A Song Below Water. It was too good not to teach, especially when it specifically spoke to themes of the violence and silencing Black girls too often endure, the matrilineal nature of our power, and the strength of sisterfriends.\n\nI told myself that I would not be readjusting again, no matter what new thing I discovered.\n\nAnd then I was able to get my hands on an ARC of Legendborn.\n\nTracy Deonn pens a modern take on Arthurian legend reimagined as a secret society at a Southern Predominately White Institution (PWI). The protagonist, Bree Matthews, falls head first into this world, and it‚Äôs made abundantly clear to her by the others in the reimagined ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù that Bree does not fit.\n\nAny Black person at a PWI, particularly a Southern one, knows the experiences Bree endures intimately. We know the malevolent administrator who sneers at our presence. We have met the parents who are quick to label us as ‚ÄúAffirmative Action‚Äù and believe that us occupying a space on those campuses has somehow stolen something from their children. We have befriended the seemingly innocuous white person, who says something racist and when you call them on it they‚Äôre quick to dismiss your retort, saying, ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.‚Äù\n\nAll of that would be enough to make anyone‚Äôs blood boil just below the surface, but add to it the depths of Bree‚Äôs grief and being thrown into an unknown magical world, where the same essence may have a different name to different people. Where the intersections of experience and history collide in unexpected ways. Deonn seamlessly weaves a tale based in uncomfortable truths about the relationship between Black and white people in the South that span centuries. Though born from those uncomfortable truths, it takes up the strength and power generated by Black individuals and families and shows how we have risen and continue to rise.\n\nFor all of that, Legendborn is the rare kind of book that satisfies the appetite of all the various portions of my personality and interests. Most times, it‚Äôs a pick and choose type of situation: perhaps you get high fantasy but lack depictions of Black girlhood, or you get Black girlhood but not as the heroine of the story.\n\nWith Tracy Deonn‚Äôs Legendborn, I didn‚Äôt have to choose. I got to bring all the sides of my magic-loving, history-seeking, smart-mouthed Black girl self to the table when I settled down to read a chapter or two. As a Black girl who has spent a significant amount of time at two Southern Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) with big reputations for both my bachelors and masters/Ph.D. programs, the difficult, conflictual feelings Bree has about Carolina didn‚Äôt need to be explained. I understood the instinctual pull Bree felt to a campus that was not built with her in mind, and yet needing to know it intimately because it would bring her closer to a parent.\n\nReading Legendborn pulled to the surface all the things I didn‚Äôt know about my undergraduate institution, but that I learned in great detail at my graduate institution. I spent two years as a graduate assistant for The Lemon Project: A Journey of Reconciliation, my campus‚Äô attempt at making the history of Black people readily available, to bring forth that which the institution would rather hide. In that time, I learned not only about the enslaved people who built my university, but met the Black folks who would much later integrate our Southern PWI, and build with the Black students who still work to make it a better place.\n\nI know the high fantasy is the draw of Legendborn, but it is the richness with which Deonn weaves so much of what is important to me as the backdrop of this narrative. It‚Äôs the vibrancy with which Deonn allows Bree to be a Black girl and revel in all the complexity of what that means. Yes, I love the way she has reimagined Arthuriana, I love the strong characters, the elements of the magic that underlies this whole world, but it is the way Bree is simply in this world, whether she fits or not, that makes it near and dear to my heart and what makes it perfectly teachable.\n\nBree is the result of centuries of racial conflict and the deep love Black women have for each other. She is both softness and hard edges; strength and fragility. She is deliciously human and wondrously exceptional.\n\nThat she is all of these things and stunningly magical is a revolution.\n\nIt‚Äôs legendary."
