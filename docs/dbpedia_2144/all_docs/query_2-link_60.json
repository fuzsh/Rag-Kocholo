During the pandemic, she developed new lab resources, including a common lab notebook for students to keep notes and complete post-lab activities in an accessible space during online labs.\n\n“Students highlight her rapport with them, consistent preparation and thorough communication, especially teaching online labs. Though Jessica has taught the BIOL 220 lab in the past, this year she had to redesign her teaching style and her methods for the online environment. She maintained teaching notes for herself and worked to integrate her previous experience into new experiments. Due to the online labs, we put more focus on microscopy and protein methods, which are outside Jess’s usual wheelhouse. However, she brought consistent preparation and modified the provided materials to inform her own learning and teaching. In all this, she was largely independent.” -Dana Huebert Lima, Teaching Associate Professor\n\nChemistry\n\nSamuel Eddy\n\nMorgantown, West Virginia\n\nSamuel Eddy teamed up with an undergraduate research student to create a new lab course for CHEM 342, Physical Chemistry.\n\n“Sam is an enthusiastic teaching assistant.
