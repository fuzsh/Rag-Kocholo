- Currents — horizontal and vertical velocity, Lagrangian currents and water transport rates

- Meteorology — Radiosonde, Met. stations and data buoys

- Optical properties — pigments, turbidity, irradiance

- Sea level

- Water column temperature and salinity

- Water column chemistry — nutrients, carbons, oxygen
