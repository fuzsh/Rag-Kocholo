        "text": "ENSO Alert System Status: La Niña Watch\n\nSynopsis: ENSO-neutral is expected to continue for the next several months, with La Niña favored to emerge during August-October (70% chance) and persist into the Northern Hemisphere winter 2024-25 (79% chance during November-January).\n\nENSO-neutral continued this past month, indicated in the mostly near average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) across the east-central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1). The most recent weekly Niño-3.4 index was +0.3°C, while SST anomalies remained cooler in the eastern Niño-3 region (-0.1°C) and warmer in the western Niño-4 region (+0.5°C; Fig. 2). Below-average subsurface temperatures weakened during the past month (area-averaged index in Fig. 3), but negative anomalies still dominated the eastern half of the Pacific (Fig. 4). Low-level wind anomalies were easterly over the western equatorial Pacific, and upper-level winds were westerly over the eastern Pacific. Convection was near average around Indonesia and the Date Line (Fig. 5). Collectively, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system reflected ENSO-neutral.\n\nCompared to the previous month, the most recent IRI plume delayed the emergence of La Niña to September-November 2024, with La Niña then persisting through the Northern Hemisphere winter (Fig. 6). The forecast team is also favoring a delayed development of La Niña this month, but is anticipating the transition to occur earlier (August-October). This is, in part, supported by the continuation of below-average subsurface ocean temperatures and near-term forecasts suggesting a resurgence of easterly wind anomalies in July. In summary, ENSO-neutral is expected to continue for the next several months, with La Niña favored to emerge during August-October (70% chance) and persist into the Northern Hemisphere winter 2024-25 (79% chance during November-January; Fig. 7).\n\nThis discussion is a consolidated effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA’s National Weather Service, and their funded institutions. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions are updated weekly on the Climate Prediction Center web site (El Niño/La Niña Current Conditions and Expert Discussions). Additional perspectives and analysis are also available in an ENSO blog. A probabilistic strength forecast is available here. The next ENSO Diagnostics Discussion is scheduled for 8 August 2024.

OISSTv2 is often used for real-time analysis and model initialization, while ERSSTv5 is used for retrospective official ENSO diagnosis because it is more homogeneous over time, allowing for more accurate comparisons among ENSO events that are years apart. These two products may differ, particularly during ENSO events. The difference between the two datasets may be as much as 0.5 °C. Additionally in some years, the ERSSTv5 may tend to be cooler than OISSTv2 in the context of warming trends, because ERSSTv5 is expressed relative to a base period that is updated every 5 years, while the base period of OISSTv2 is updated every 10 years. In February 2021, both datasets were updated to reflect the 1991-2020 climatology period.\n\nRecent and Current Conditions\n\nThe SST anomaly for NINO3.4 during the Apr-Jun 2024 season was +0.45 °C, and for the month of June 2024 it was +0.24 °C. The most recent weekly (week centered on 10 July 2024) anomaly in the NINO3.4 region was 0.3 °C, indicating that the tropical Pacific is in the ENSO-neutral state. The IRI’s definition of El Niño, like NOAA/Climate Prediction Center’s, requires that the monthly SST anomaly in the NINO3.4 region (5S-5N; 170W-120W) exceed +0.5 °C. Similarly, for La Niña, the anomaly must be -0.5 °C or colder.\n\nOceanic and atmospheric conditions across the tropical Pacific are indicative of ENSO-neutral conditions. As of July 17, 2024, the 30-day Southern Oscillation Index stands within the ENSO-neutral range, with a value of -1.12, while the equatorial Southern Oscillation Index registers a value of 0.6 for the month of June 2024. The trade winds (at 850 hPa) are slightly above normal across the central-eastern equatorial tropical Pacific, while the upper-level winds (at 200 hPa) are also close to average over the equatorial Pacific. Negative subsurface temperature anomalies have persisted in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and extended to the surface. Below-average temperature remain at depth in the central Pacific Ocean. Weak (less than 50 meters depth, ~ +0.5 °C) positive subsurface temperature anomalies remain prevalent in the western Pacific Ocean. Together, these observed conditions in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system indicate an ongoing ENSO-neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific.\n\nExpected Conditions:\n\nNote – Only models that produce a new ENSO prediction every month are considered in this statement.\n\nWhat is the outlook for the ENSO status going forward?\n\nThe El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Diagnostic Discussion released on 11 July 2024 by the Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS issued a continuation of ENSO-neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific for the next several month, along with a La Niña watch with 70% likelihood for Aug-Oct, 2024.\n\nThe latest set of ENSO prediction models from mid-July 2024 is now available in the IRI ENSO prediction plume. These are used to assess the probabilities of the three ENSO categories by using the average value of the NINO3.4 SST anomaly predictions from all models in the plume, equally weighted. A standard Gaussian error is imposed over that averaged forecast, with its width determined by an estimate of overall expected model skill for the season of the year and the lead time. Higher skill results in a relatively narrower error distribution, while low skill results in an error distribution with width approaching that of the historical observed distribution.\n\nAccording to the ENSO forecast issued by the IRI, ENSO-neutral conditions are forecasted to continue during Jul-Sep (72% chances), and Aug-Oct (55% chances), while chances for La Niña are 25%, and 41% respectively. La Niña onset is most likely in Sep-Nov 2024, though the probability for that is just 49%, while the continuation of the ENSO-neutral state is estimated at 47%. La Niña then remains the most-likely category for the next three seasons with probabilities of 52% in Oct-Dec, 51% in Nov-Jan, and 48% in Dec-Feb, 2025. In Jan-Mar, 2025, ENSO-neutral conditions become once again dominant with 50% chance, while La Niña is estimated at 43%. ENSO-neutral conditions then prevail during Feb-Apr (60% chances) and Mar-May (69% chances). The probability of El Niño remains very low throughout the forecast period, (less than 10%). A plot of the probabilities summarizes the forecast evolution.\n\nThe climatological probabilities for La Niña, ENSO-neutral, and El Niño conditions vary seasonally, and are shown by the lines on the plot, and are given in a table at the bottom of this page for each 3-month season.\n\nCaution is advised in interpreting the forecast distribution from the Gaussian standard error as the actual probabilities, due to differing biases and performance of the different models. In particular, this approach considers only the mean of the predictions, and not the total range across the models, nor the ensemble range within individual models. At longer leads, the skill of the models degrades, and uncertainty in skill must be convolved with the uncertainties from initial conditions and differing model physics, which leads to more climatological probabilities in the long-lead ENSO Outlook than might be suggested by the suite of models. Furthermore, the expected skill of one model versus another has not been established using uniform validation procedures, which may cause a difference in the true probability distribution.\n\nIn summary, the forecast indicates continued ENSO-neutral conditions until Aug-Oct, 2024. The forecast shows La Niña onset in Sep-Nov with only 49% chances, while the continuation of ENSO-neutral state is estimated with 47% chance. La Niña then remains the most likely category until Dec-Feb 2025 with weak probabilities (52-48%). In Jan-Mar, 2025 ENSO-neutral becomes dominant with 50% chances, while the probability for La Niña continuation is only 43%. ENSO-neutral prevail during Feb-Apr, and Mar-May, 2025 with probabilities of 60% and 69% respectively.\n\nA caution regarding the model-based ENSO plume predictions (released mid-month) is that factors such as known specific model biases and recent changes in the tropical Pacific that the models may have missed, are not considered. This approach is purely objective. Those issues are taken into account in CPC’s official outlooks, which are issued early in the month, and which will include some human judgment in combination with the model guidance.\n\nSeason La Niña Neutral El Niño JAS 25 72 3 ASO 41 55 4 SON 49 47 4 OND 52 42 6 NDJ 51 42 7 DJF 48 44 8 JFM 43 50 7 FMA 33 60 7 MAM 24 69 7\n\nList of Models Used\n\nForecast SST Anomalies (deg C) in the Nino 3.4 Region\n\nSeasons (2024 – 2025) Model JAS ASO SON OND NDJ DJF JFM FMA MAM Dynamical Models AUS-ACCESS -0.10 -0.20 -0.20 -0.17 BCC_CSM11m -0.67 -0.69 -0.52 -0.38 -0.22 -0.03 0.15 0.31 0.48 CMC CANSIP -0.50 -0.81 -0.94 -0.96 -0.98 -0.95 -0.87 -0.80 -0.75 COLA CCSM4 -0.59 -0.95 -1.09 -1.14 -1.11 -0.96 -0.63 -0.21 0.14 CS-IRI-MM -0.07 -0.32 -0.51 -0.66 -0.73 -0.62 DWD 0.02 -0.12 -0.17 -0.17 ECMWF 0.03 -0.11 -0.09 -0.08 -0.11 GFDL SPEAR -0.07 -0.33 -0.58 -0.79 -0.84 -0.68 -0.39 -0.10 0.08 IOCAS ICM 0.46 0.32 0.02 -0.26 -0.48 -0.60 -0.67 -0.68 -0.68 JMA -0.48 -0.71 -0.83 -0.87 -0.82 KMA -0.50 -0.74 -0.92 -1.05 LDEO -0.27 -0.36 -0.43 -0.49 -0.38 -0.15 0.07 0.18 0.21 MetFRANCE -0.16 -0.40 -0.54 -0.61 -0.60 NCEP CFSv2 -0.62 -0.99 -1.23 -1.32 -1.25 -1.03 -0.78 SINTEX-F -0.68 -0.79 -0.82 -0.85 -0.85 -0.81 -0.70 -0.61 -0.53 UKMO -0.51 -0.75 -0.86 -0.95 Average, Dynamical models -0.295 -0.497 -0.607 -0.671 -0.697 -0.647 -0.479 -0.273 -0.150 Statistical Models BCC_RZDM -0.02 -0.14 -0.24 -0.40 -0.47 -0.46 -0.42 -0.38 -0.40 CPC CA -0.48 -0.64 -0.66 -0.63 -0.65 -0.69 -0.63 -0.44 -0.22 CPC MRKOV -0.33 -0.32 -0.30 -0.25 -0.15 -0.05 0.00 0.01 0.03 CSU CLIPR -0.63 -0.42 -0.21 0.00 -0.08 -0.16 -0.24 -0.11 0.02 IAP-NN -0.02 -0.14 -0.20 -0.23 -0.25 -0.22 -0.15 -0.02 0.10 NTU CODA -0.10 -0.21 -0.28 -0.40 -0.41 -0.40 -0.39 -0.33 -0.30 TONGJI-ML 0.49 0.34 0.21 0.22 0.31 0.27 0.03 -0.22 -0.25 UCLA-TCD 0.30 0.20 0.07 -0.06 -0.14 -0.17 -0.16 -0.11 -0.03 UW PSL-CSLIM -0.16 -0.25 -0.35 -0.45 -0.56 -0.63 -0.63 -0.58 -0.46 UW PSL-LIM -0.28 -0.42 -0.54 -0.60 -0.61 -0.59 -0.57 -0.58 -0.56 Average, Statistical models -0.122 -0.200 -0.251 -0.281 -0.300 -0.310 -0.315 -0.276 -0.206 Average, All models -0.229 -0.383 -0.470 -0.521 -0.517 -0.470 -0.388 -0.275 -0.183\n\nDiscussion of Current Forecasts\n\nThe IRI-Plume indicate ENSO-neutral conditions during Jul-Sep (72% chances) and Aug-Oct (55% chances) 2024. In Sep-Nov, the chances of La Niña are 49%, while persistence of the ENSO-neutral state is estimated at 47%, which shows high uncertainty in the ENSO forecasts at this time of the year. Thereafter, La Niña is forecasted to become the most likely category with 52% chances in Oct-Dec, and remain so for next two seasons i.e., Nov-Jan, and Dec-Feb, 2025. In Jan-Mar, 2025 ENSO-neutral conditions returning with weak probabilities (50% chances), however, forecasts show 60% and 69% probabilities of ENSO-neutral state for Feb-Apr, and Mar-May, 2025 respectively. Based on the multi-model mean prediction, and the expected skill of the models by start time and lead time, the probabilities (in %) for La Niña, ENSO-neutral and El Niño conditions (using -0.5 °C and 0.5 °C thresholds) over the coming 9 seasons are:\n\nSeason La Niña Neutral El Niño JAS 25 72 3 ASO 41 55 4 SON 49 47 4 OND 52 42 6 NDJ 51 42 7 DJF 48 44 8 JFM 43 50 7 FMA 33 60 7 MAM 24 69 7\n\nSummary of forecasts issued over last 22 months\n\nThe following interactive plot shows the model forecasts issued not only from the current month (as in the plot above), but also from the 21 months previous to this month. The observations are shown up to the most recently completed 3-month period. The plots allow comparison of plumes from the previous start times, or examination of the forecast behavior of a given model over time.\n\nHovering over any single model will highlight that particular model in the chart.\n\nClicking a particular model will hide/show that model in the chart.\n\nAt the bottom of the plot, you can select which models to show in the chart: all the models, the dynamical models only, or the statistical models only.\n\nNotes on the data\n\nOnly models producing forecasts on a monthly basis are included. This means that some models whose forecasts appear in the Experimental Long-Lead Forecast Bulletin (produced by COLA) do not appear in the table.\n\nOnce an IRI ENSO probability forecast has been published, the results stand even if a model reports an error and changes their data. When this happens we will update the plume with the model's correct values even though our forecast hasn't changed. What this means is that our forecast is always the same, but the underlying data may be different from what we based our forecast on.\n\nThe SST anomaly forecasts are for the 3-month periods shown, and are for the Nino 3.4 region (120-170W, 5N-5S). Often, the anomalies are provided directly in a graph or a table by the respective forecasting centers for the Nino 3.4 region. In some cases, however, they are given for 1-month periods, for 3-month periods that skip some of the periods in the above table, and/or only for a region (or regions) other than Nino 3.4. In these cases, the following means are used to obtain the needed anomalies for the table:\n\nTemporal averaging\n\nLinear temporal interpolation\n\nVisual averaging of values on a contoured map\n\nThe anomalies shown are those with respect to the base period used to define the normals, which vary among the groups producing model forecasts. They have not been adjusted to anomalies with respect to a common base period. Discrepancies among the climatological SST resulting from differing base periods may be as high as a quarter of a degree C in the worst cases. Forecasters are encouraged to use the standard 1991-2020 period as the base period, or a period not very different from it."
