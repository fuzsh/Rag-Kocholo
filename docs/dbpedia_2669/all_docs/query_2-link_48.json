        "text": "Abstract The NERC DataGrid (NDG) project has been investigating vocabularies describing measurements or model outputs for use in its 'discovery'and 'use'metadata schema. It has been recognised that the two types of metadata have significantly different requirements of this type of vocabulary and therefore that more than one vocabulary is required. Automated construction of metadata records from data holdings requires that mappings exist between data labelling and the vocabularies used.\n\nAbstract The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) DataGrid (NDG) aims to provide a framework for the discovery and use of data needed in NERC research. To support this, the NDG has developed a metadata and data model. The data model is directly concerned with the representation and use of the data, with the metadata model covering the discovery and higher-level considerations.\n\nAn ever-increasing number of sensor resources are being exposed via the World Wide Web. Discovery, selection and use of these sensors and their observations require a robust sensor information model, but the homogenous description of sensor metadata is a complex and difficult task. Currently, the only available robust model is SensorML, which is intentionally designed in a very generic way. Due to this genericness, interoperability can hardly be achieved without the definition of application profiles that further constrain the use and expressiveness of the root language. So far, such SensorML profiles have only been developed up to a limited extent. This work describes a new approach for defining sensor metadata, the StarFL model. This language follows a more restrictive approach and incorporates concepts from the recently published Semantic Sensor Network Ontology to overcome the key issues users are experiencing with SensorML.

Data sharing and data service such as support of metadata deign, structuring of data contents, support of text mining are applied for better use of data as data interoperability. Semantic network dictionary and gazetteers are constructed as a trans-disciplinary dictionary. Ontological information are added to the system by digitalizing text based dictionaries, developing &quot;knowledge writing tool&quot; for experts, and extracting semantic relations from authoritative documents with natural language processing technique. The system is developed to collect lexicographic ontology and geographic ontology. 1. INGRODUCTION\n\nExperience from recent projects helps illuminate the promises and limitations of OWL to specify, review, refine, harmonize and integrate diverse data and concept models. One of the attractive features of OWL is that it can be used by inference engines to help augment queries through inferred semantic relationships. But OWL, like SQL, is only a computer programming language. Using it to review and refine representations of data, metadata, and concept systems, including terminologies, thesauri, and ontologies, requires a well-defined abstraction layer ï€­ which itself can be specified in terms of OWL. In order to optimize, harmonize and integrate such information effectively for large scale projects, OWL definitions and relationships should be specified in terms of a standard metamodel, such as ISO/IEC 11179-3, Edition 3."
