        "text": "It's interesting that before the maligned-by-some Obamacare, there was ... nothing. With the Obamacare insurance mandate gone, Obamacare is obviously better than what existed before it, since those ignore it are no worse off than with what existed previously.\n\nOf course, the idea that we all pay for our own healthcare is not only totally false, it's also the primary underlying problem behind the healthcare mess in the US. There is no free market for healthcare in the US because (1) healthcare is not amenable to a free market for many reasons and (2) we have become addicted to the idea of healthcare \"insurance\" that is subsidized by corporations or the government. In a non-subsidized insurance market, some people must pay more and some less for the average healthcare expenditure, but that amount is unaffordable for all but the very rich. The only way for a non-subsidized insurance market to even approach practicality would be for healthcare expenditures to be drastically reduced, which can only be done via government intervention, either through regulation or a single-payer system. The irony of the situation is that the same people who hate the single-payer system also complain about the carnage in the wake of its absence."
