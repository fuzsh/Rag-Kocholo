        "meta_description": "The Ocean Surface Mixing, Ocean Sub-mesoscale Interaction Study (OSMOSIS) data set contains a variety of oceanographic measurements including a year long time series of the properties of the ocean surface boundary layer and its controlling 3D physical processes. The core observations include measurements of temperature, salinity, nutrients, currents and shear harvested from a suite of instrumentation including CTDs, ocean gliders, drifter buoys and moored sensors. OSMOSIS data were collected during three cruises. The first cruise undertook preliminary exploratory work in the Clyde Sea (September 2011) to hone techniques and strategies. The following cruises carried out mooring deployments and recovery in the vicinity of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) observatory (in late Summer 2012 and 2013 respectively). Additional opportunist ship time being factored in to support the ambitious glider operations associated with OSMOSIS. This multiple year study will combine traditional observational techniques, such as moorings and CTDs, with the latest autonomous sampling technologies (including ocean gliders), capable of delivering near real-time scientific measurements through the water column. The OSMOSIS data set will contain high-resolution vertical measurements, which will shed light on the complex turbulent processes that drive the deepening of the OSBL and similarly the sub-mesoscale processes promoting OSBL re-stratification. Continuous mooring and glider measurements over a complete annual cycle will also provide invaluable insight into how the OSBL evolves over time. The NERC OSMOSIS Consortium brings together scientists from various UK research centres including the University of Southampton School of Ocean and Earth Sciences, University of Reading, Bangor and the National Oceanography Centre (NOC).",

Data managers quality assure submissions and assemble the metadata necessary for curation. Submissions (as received) are placed in a long-term accession and stored in triplicate across multiple sites. Appropriate data are transferred into a standard internal format with source variable names mapped to controlled vocabularies, documentation assembled, and metadata loaded into BODC databases. Access to these data is through direct request, the BODC website and through partner repositories such as SeaDataNet. Access control is attained by assigning a data policy to each set of data and this policy is used to administer access when data are requested. Discovery metadata is aligned with EU INSPIRE (through MEDIN) and SeaDataNet community standards. Data are converted to open community formats including Ocean Data View ASCII and SeaDataNet NetCDF, with data described using terms from the NERC vocabulary server. BODC submission agreements are documented on the BODC website and customer service is assured with a dedicated requests team that serve data following local regulations including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) 2004.\n\nPass\n\nYes\n\nStatement\n\nThis dataset was created by the organisations with the \"originator\" role in this metadata record following their in-house data processing and quality control procedures. The data were then provided to the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) for ingestion into one of the schemas of the National Oceanographic Database (NODB). During ingestion BODC undertake quality control, documentation and metadata enhancement procedures appropriate to the type of data. For an overview please see http://www.bodc.ac.uk/about/information_technology/data_processing_steps/. BODC supply full information about data collection, data processing and data quality with all data requests to enable users to assess data suitability themselves.\n\nFile identifier\n\n50eb3ced80135b95a436238d98b53b98 XML\n\nMetadata language\n\nEnglishEnglish\n\nHierarchy level\n\ndataset Dataset\n\nDate stamp\n\n2021-12-20T06:31:16\n\nMetadata standard name\n\nMEDIN\n\nMetadata standard version\n\n3.1.1\n\nOverviews\n\nSpatial extent\n\nN\n\nS\n\nE\n\nW\n\nKeywords\n\nProvided by\n\nShare on social sites\n\nAccess to the portal\n\nRead here the full details and access to the data.\n\nAssociated resources\n\nNot available"
