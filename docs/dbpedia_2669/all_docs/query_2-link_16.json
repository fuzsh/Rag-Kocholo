It presents cruise metadata and a summary of BODC data holdings for the cruise. It also links to external references, for example cruise reports.\n\nHierarchy level\n\ndataset Dataset\n\nConformance result\n\nExplanation\n\nBODC protocols are based on the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model enabling BODC to iterate towards compliance with the on-going evolution and development of community requirements including FAIR (Findable,Accessible,Interoperable,Reusable), TRUST (Transparency, Responsibility, User community, Sustainability, Technology) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics). Data managers quality assure submissions and assemble the metadata necessary for curation. Submissions (as received) are placed in a long-term accession and stored in triplicate across multiple sites. Appropriate data are transferred into a standard internal format with source variable names mapped to controlled vocabularies, documentation assembled, and metadata loaded into BODC databases. Access to these data is through direct request, the BODC website and through partner repositories such as SeaDataNet. Access control is attained by assigning a data policy to each set of data and this policy is used to administer access when data are requested. Discovery metadata is aligned with EU INSPIRE (through MEDIN) and SeaDataNet community standards. Data are converted to open community formats including Ocean Data View ASCII and SeaDataNet NetCDF, with data described using terms from the NERC vocabulary server. BODC submission agreements are documented on the BODC website and customer service is assured with a dedicated requests team that serve data following local regulations including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) 2004.\n\nPass\n\nYes\n\nStatement\n\nThis dataset was collected by the originators and provided to the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC). Data have undergone BODC quality control procedures described in https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/documents/nodb/63428/ prior to long term archive and management. Further information about data collection, data processing and data quality reports are linked to the individual profile references in the cruise metadata document linked to this metadata record.\n\nFile identifier\n\ne36e407461bd52d0a758c77a888d0ef8 XML\n\nMetadata language\n\nEnglishEnglish\n\nHierarchy level\n\ndataset Dataset\n\nDate stamp\n\n2021-12-23T11:31:06\n\nMetadata standard name\n\nMEDIN\n\nMetadata standard version\n\n3.1.1\n\nOverviews\n\nSpatial extent\n\nN\n\nS\n\nE\n\nW\n\nKeywords\n\nProvided by\n\nShare on social sites\n\nAccess to the portal\n\nRead here the full details and access to the data.\n\nAssociated resources\n\nNot available"
