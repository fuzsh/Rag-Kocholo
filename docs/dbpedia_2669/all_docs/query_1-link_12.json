Our vital, in-depth scientific research has helped us to better understand the intricate, interconnected marine environment—one that we all depend on every day. The knowledge we’ve gained has helped guide the world in protecting the lungs of our planet’s ecosystem. Yet our journey has only just begun. Together with our global community of Members, we continually work as a voice for our ocean, and to fulfil our responsibility to future generations."
