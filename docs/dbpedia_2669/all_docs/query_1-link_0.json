        "text": "Argo aims to deploy a global array of profiling floats. This will result in the long-term systematic measurement of physical state of the upper ocean. BODC acts as the UK Argo Data Centre and the Southern Ocean Argo Regional Centre.\n\nMERMAN is a new national database designed to hold and provide access to data collected under the Clean Safe Seas Environmental Monitoring Programme (CSEMP) - formerly the National Marine Monitoring Programme (NMMP).\n\nGliders are buoyancy driven autonomous vehicles, which undertake measurements throughout the water column for several months at a time. Measurements can include temperature, salinity, pressure, levels of oxygen and ocean colour (i.e. algae, near the surface or stirred up sediment). The gliders transmit data each time they surface by communicating with the shore station over an Iridium link."
