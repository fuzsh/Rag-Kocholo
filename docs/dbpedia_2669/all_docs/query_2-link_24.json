The 25°N monitoring array\n\nLinks to articles, papers and media coverage.\n\nFinding a reliable and cost-effective way to monitor the Atlantic heat conveyor is a primary aim of the RAPID programme.

The results suggest that the Gulf Stream flow across 25°N has remained nearly constant in this period, but the MOC has slowed from about 20 Sv in 1957 to 14 Sv in 2004.\n\nThe evidence for the slow-down can be found both in the increase in southward recirculation of warm water in the surface layer, and in a decrease in southward transport of lower North Atlantic Deep Water between 3000 and 5000m depth.\n\nSome climate models have suggested that we could expect such a slowdown as a result of global warming, and that this could cool northwest Europe by a few °C, with the change happening relatively fast, perhaps over just a decade. These measurements are evidence that the models could be right.\n\nThe five sections are just 'snapshots' and cannot tell us for sure whether the changes are a result of natural variability. Very little is known about how the MOC varies seasonally or from year to year. To be sure that the observed change is the result of a long-term trend rather than natural fluctuations we will need to monitor flow across 25°N continuously for about a decade.\n\nThe MOC monitoring array at 25°N\n\nIn April 2004 Prof. Bryden's team deployed an array of instruments across the Atlantic at 25° North. The array measures temperature, salinity, currents and pressure. The first full year of measurements were collected in April 2005, and analysis of this data is now underway. The mooring array will continue to give data until the end of the project in 2008. However, the team are hopeful that they will be able to continue the work beyond this to collect a full decade's worth of data.\n\nTo build up a picture of the natural variability in the Atlantic overturning circulation the team intends to combine data from the MOC array with measurements from oceanographic cruises, satellite images and data from floats. Armed with this knowledge they should be able to say with greater certainty if changes observed in the 'snapshot' data from 1957 to 2004 represents actual long-term change in the MOC.\n\nBased on their analysis and their experiences with the prototype array the team are also hoping to develop recommendations for a longer term 'early warning system', which could continue to monitor the health of the Atlantic conveyor in a cost-effective way.\n\nLinks: Articles, scientific papers and media coverage\n\nSlowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at 25°N.\n\nScientific paper in Nature (letters) 1 December 2005.\n\nBryden et al., Nature 438, 655-657.\n\nOceanography: The Atlantic heat conveyor slows.\n\nNature News and Views article by Detlef Quadfasel, 1 December 2005."
