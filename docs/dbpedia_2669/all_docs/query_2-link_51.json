Material types include continuous drillcore, core samples, individual hand specimens, bulk samples, unwashed cuttings, washed and dried cuttings, plugs, powders and bulk samples. Details of thin sections are in our BRITROCKS database.\n\nUKCS (offshore) hydrocarbon well collection\n\nThe UKCS (offshore) hydrocarbon well collection database of core and sample types and depths contains records from over 8000 UKCS (offshore) hydrocarbon wells.It includes over 300 km of drillcore and 4.5 million samples of cuttings. Material may be selected by any combination of well name, operator, depth range and sample type.\n\nResults include thumbnail links to high resolution images (where available)."
