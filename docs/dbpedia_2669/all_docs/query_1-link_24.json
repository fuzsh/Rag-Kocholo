        "text": "A new polar research ship for Britain\n\nThe RRS Sir David Attenborough is one of the most advanced polar research vessels in the world.\n\nWant to know what RRS Sir David Attenborough is up to this season? Check out our ‘Science this season’ page for latest updates from Antarctica.\n\nThis multidisciplinary research platform is transforming how ship-borne science is conducted in the polar regions and provides scientists with state-of-the-art facilities to research the oceans, seafloor, ice and atmosphere.\n\nThe new polar ship was commissioned by NERC, built by Cammell Laird for operation by British Antarctic Survey. The commissioning of the RRS Sir David Attenborough was part of a major Government investment in polar infrastructure which will keep Britain at the forefront of world-leading research in Antarctica and the Arctic. This £200m commitment represents the UK Government‘s largest investment in polar science since the 1980s.\n\nExplore the ship’s scientific facilities and operational capability\n\nExploring new frontiers\n\nBritain has been a world leader in polar exploration and research for over a century. Today, studying these remote regions is crucial in helping us understand changes in our planet’s oceans, marine life and climate system.\n\nTechnical features\n\nLength: 129 metres; beam: 24m; Gross Tonnage: 15,000\n\nScientific cargo volume of approximately 900m³\n\nEndurance – up to 60 days\n\nRange 19,000 nautical miles at 13 knots (24 km/h) cruising speed; more than enough for a return trip from England to Rothera Research Station, or to circle the entire Antarctic continent twice!\n\nIce breaking capability – up to 1m thick at 3 knots (5.6 km/h)\n\nBow and stern thrusters for excellent dynamic positioning in challenging conditions\n\nLaunch and recovery of aerial and ocean robotic systems\n\nCrew approx. 30\n\nAccommodation for up to 60 scientists and support staff\n\nEnhanced scientific capability\n\nRRS Sir David Attenborough is designed to support science in extreme environments. A wide range of specialist scientific facilities, instruments and laboratories enable scientists to conduct multi-disciplinary sciences to study the ocean, seafloor, ice and atmosphere. Marine robotics and remotely operated vehicles – including the famous Boaty McBoatface – capture data from the deep ocean and previously inaccessible locations under the ice.\n\nFrom the ship, scientists can deploy, operate and control a range of remotely piloted science instruments at the same time, meaning they can gather measurements from both airborne and marine remotely operated vehicles and autonomous platforms simultaneously.\n\nShe is also the first British polar research ship to feature a moon pool – a vertical shaft (~4 x 4 m) running through the vessel, open to both the air and sea. Using the moon pool, scientific equipment can be deployed and recovered through the centre, and most stable part, of the hull. This is easier and safer than deploying equipment over the side or stern, particularly in the polar oceans’ rough seas.\n\nThe ship has a number of built-in laboratories. However, it’s also possible to ‘plug-in’ portable, containerised laboratories. This makes science on board the RRS Sir David Attenborough much more flexible and, as technologies and techniques change, the containers can be reconfigured to ensure research teams have the facilities they need to conduct world-leading science.\n\nOperational capability\n\nThe new polar ship for Britain operates year-round, spending the northern summer supporting Arctic research cruises and the austral summer in Antarctica carrying out research programmes and bringing people and supplies to BAS research stations.\n\nHer ice-strengthened hull, designed to break through ice up to one metre thick, and ability to spend up to 60 days at sea means the RRS Sir David Attenborough can undertake extensive voyages. The ship’s operational facilities will enable her to undertake logistics work efficiently, maximising the time spent on research cruises.\n\nBuilding a new polar vessel\n\nUseful documents\n\nCabin Safety and information\n\nSDA video tour\n\nWatch a tour of the RRS Sir David Attenborough:\n\nPurpose\n\nRRS Sir David Attenborough provides UK polar researchers and their international collaborators with a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary research platform to study the ocean, seafloor, ice and atmosphere.\n\nIt’s critical that we understand the role that the polar oceans play in our changing world. The Southern Ocean in particular has the sparsest data coverage of any of the world’s major oceans due to its remoteness and inhospitable nature. RRS Sir David Attenborough plays an important role in improving our knowledge of key polar atmospheric and oceanic processes, which regulate our climate. She is also enhancing our knowledge of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, essential for conserving and managing Antarctica’s species and biological resources.\n\nInternational studies focusing on the changing Arctic are also being enhanced by this new facility. The ship enables scientists to investigate the impact that physical and biological changes in the Arctic environment will have on Arctic and non-Arctic countries alike.\n\nAt both poles, researchers can carry out marine geophysical and geological investigations to map and date glacial landforms and sediments on the seafloor to reconstruct past environments. This is fundamental for helping predict how the polar regions may respond to future climate change and contribute to global sea-level rise.\n\nScientific activities:\n\nAtmospheric science\n\nBiological Oceanography\n\nChemical Oceanography (Biogeochemistry)\n\nPhysical Oceanography\n\nMarine Geophysics\n\nMarine Geology\n\nScientific facilities\n\nReconfigurable laboratory space to meet evolving science needs over the lifetime of the vessel, with docking stations for containerised laboratories for additional flexibility\n\nComputing and communication facilities to enable seamless collection, processing, storage and real-time transmission of scientific data\n\nEnhanced deck facilities including science hangar, winches and a moon-pool for flexible and reliable deployment and retrieval of scientific equipment such as remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, even in rough weather and in pack ice\n\nSmall boats and diving facilities to enable sampling in shallow coastal areas and under pack ice\n\nHelideck and hangar for two small helicopters to assist with the deployment of airborne scientific instruments and scientific field parties\n\nSophisticated environmental sensor systems to continuously monitor atmosphere, water-column and seabed conditions\n\nRock drills and sediment corers to collect seafloor samples offering valuable insights into past environmental conditions\n\nSeismic systems to examine the structure and evolution of the seafloor\n\nNext-generation technologies\n\nCapability to deploy, operate and control large numbers of remotely piloted science instruments at the same time\n\nRobotic submarines and marine gliders will collect data on ocean conditions and marine biology and deliver it to scientists working in the ship’s on-board laboratories\n\nAirborne robots and on-board environmental monitoring systems will provide detailed information on the surrounding polar environment"
