        "text": "A team of scientists and engineers, led by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and University of Southampton, are headed to the north Atlantic to revisit a deep, cold-water coral reef area 16 years after it was named a Marine Protected Area, to look for evidence the coral is regenerating.\n\nThese 1,000-metre deep coral reefs were discovered in 1998 off the north-west coast of Scotland by NOC scientists, who named the area the ‘Darwin Mounds’ after their research ship, RRS Charles Darwin.\n\nThis latest expedition, on board the RRS Discovery, aims to answer the question ‘how long does cold water coral take to recover?’ by returning to the site once more, using marine robots to look for signs the coral has regrown. The results will help inform the use of Marine Protected Areas, which were recently given an extra £7 Million by the UK government.\n\nThis will be achieved by comparing surveys of the site from 2000 and 2011, with those conducted on this expedition. The surveys use some of the newest marine survey technology, including the NOC’s robot-sub, Autosub6000, to map the area, and the HyBIS Robotic Underwater Vehicle to collect high-definition video footage.\n\nDr Blair Thornton , Associate Professor of Oceanic Engineering Science at the University of Southampton, is on board as the principal investigator and expedition co-chief scientist for the BioCam project. BioCam is part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) OCEANIDS program, in collaboration with NOC and partners in the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), to help to efficiently map out the extent of living and dead coral within the reefs.\n\nDuring this expedition, the research team will deploy a new 3D imaging system integrated on Autosub6000 that can create a 100-hectare 3D map of the coral reefs in 24 hours, which will be a record if the trials are successful. This technology is being developed by the University of Southampton in collaboration with the NOC as part of the BioCam project.\n\n“We are excited to deploy our technology and generate high-resolution 3D visual reconstructions of cold-water coral in UK MPAs,” Dr Thornton enthused. “Our plan is generate 100-hectare scale maps with millimetre-order resolution for scientists to visualise and explore while we are still out at sea.\n\n“We will also use machine learning algorithms to automatically interpret the data and help scientists understand the broader-scale spatial patterns that have been observed,” he explained. “Our goal is to maximise understanding of the observations within expedition relevant timeframes. Hopefully this will allow our teams to make the best informed decisions while we are all still out at sea and improve the quality of information we gather from this expedition.”\n\nCold-water corals build reefs that are important habitats for a wide range of other species, including commercially important fish. The ‘Darwin Mounds’ reefs are fragile, and can easily be damaged by the heavy gear of deep-sea bottom trawlers. Much of the coral was previously destroyed, leading to the site being given Marine Protected Area status in 2003.\n\nAn expedition by the NOC team to the site in 2011 found that deep, cold-water corals are very slow to recover from damage. This finding suggested that deep-water Marine Protected Areas protect vulnerable marine ecosystems most effectively when they are put in place before that damage occurs.\n\nDr Veerle Huvenne, expedition chief scientist, said: “I’m very excited to go back to the Darwin Mounds, which we last visited eight years ago. I really hope we will find evidence of coral recovery.\n\n“Long-term repeat surveys in the deep sea are very rare, which means we know very little about how habitats and ecosystems evolve over time, be it in a natural or human-impacted state. Our expedition to the Darwin Mounds will bring back new insights, no matter what we find.”\n\nThese surveys will be conducted as part of the Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science (CLASS) programme, which aims to assess how the ocean will evolve as a result of climate change and the intensified of human exploitation of the ocean. The expedition will also take collaborators from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, University of Edinburgh and Scottish Association of Marine Science."
