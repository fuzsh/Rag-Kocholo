        "text": "To streamline procedures to clear the arrival, stay and departure of ships and enhance efficiency of shipping worldwide, IMO Member States are required to use a single, centralized digital platform or \"Maritime Single Window\" (MSW) to collect and exchange information with ships when they call at ports.\n\nIMO is working with the OECS* and Antigua and Barbuda – the first country to establish such a platform in the region, with support from IMO – to establish an MSW in five countries in the Eastern Caribbean sub-region.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO) is excited to announce a photography competition in honour of Black History Month this October. The theme for this year’s photo contest is ‘Diversity at Sea,’ celebrating multiculturalism within the maritime sector.\n\nIMO invites photo submissions from all skill levels showcasing unique perspectives on maritime life. Whether capturing diverse crews, the rich cultural mosaic of port cities, or the daily experiences of maritime professionals worldwide, we want your interpretation of ‘Diversity at Sea’.\n\nIMO has launched a new toolkit that will help the global maritime industry respond better to ever-evolving ‘insider threats’. Insider threat refers to the risk that arises from a maritime employee carrying out or enabling a security incident, either through a lack of awareness, complacency or maliciousness."
