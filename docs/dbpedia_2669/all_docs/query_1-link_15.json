        "text": "About the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)\n\nWe are an independent, not-for-profit research institute. Our 600+ staff provide the data and insights that researchers, governments and businesses need to create a productive, resilient and healthy environment.\n\nLatest stories\n\nClimate change caused unprecedented wildfires\n\nUnprecedented wildfires in Canada were three times more likely due to climate change, according a new report. The first annual global review of its kind, jointly led by UKCEH, explains causes of wildfires and makes future predictions.\n\nTackling flooding threats in the Caribbean\n\nUKCEH is part of a new international project aiming to reduce flooding impacts on coastal communities in Caribbean nations through collaborative research.\n\nOur changing woodlands now look a shade different\n\nSurveys by UKCEH have captured how Britain’s broadleaf woodlands have changed dramatically over the past 50 years, due to disease, lack of management, climate change and an increase in deer numbers.\n\nOur ambition\n\nWe seek to understand our environment, how it sustains life, and the human impact on it – so that together, people and nature can prosper.\n\nExcellent environmental science with impact\n\nWe have a long history of investigating, monitoring and modelling environmental change, generating evidence-driven solutions to complex environmental challenges. Watch our video to find out more about how our science is having a positive impact.\n\nOur science\n\nScience departments\n\nScience challenges\n\nScience infrastructure\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe carry out excellent environmental science across water, land and air. Our science makes a difference, informing policy-making, commercial innovation and conservation action all around the world.\n\nExplore our data\n\nEnvironmental Information Data Centre\n\nEnvironmental Information Platform\n\nEnvironmental datasets\n\nHow we work\n\nWe believe that the best solutions are co-designed and co-delivered, and our partnerships cross borders, sectors and disciplines. We are a strategic delivery partner for the Natural Environment Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation."
