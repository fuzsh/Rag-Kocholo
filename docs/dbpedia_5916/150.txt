Edward Stanley, 14th earl of Derby (born March 29, 1799, Knowsley Park, Lancashire, England—died October 23, 1869, London) was an English statesman, important as leader of the Conservative Party during the long period 1846–68, thrice prime minister, and one of England’s greatest parliamentary orators; nevertheless, he has no great political reputation.

Entering Parliament as a Whig in 1820, Derby held office under Viscount Goderich (1827–28) and became chief secretary for Ireland under Lord Grey in 1830, joining the Cabinet in 1831. In 1834 he resigned over the Irish Church question, but he served under Sir Robert Peel (1841) only to resign again (1845) over the repeal of the Corn Laws. He succeeded to the earldom in 1851 and was premier in 1852, 1858, and 1866; among his legislation were the removal of Jewish discrimination in Parliament membership, the transfer of India’s administration from the East India Company to the crown, and the Reform Bill of 1867.
