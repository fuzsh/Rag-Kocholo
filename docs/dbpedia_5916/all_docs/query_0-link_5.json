        "text": "Warren Bennis once said, “A business short on capital can borrow money and one with poor location can move but a business short on leadership has little chance of survival”\n\nI’ve always been struck by the different way people choose to lead in a managerial or Board level role. Equally the way people respond to that behaviour has also fascinated me. And please make no mistake, leaders make a conscious decision on how they behave, it’s not an inherent personality trait. Motivational versus controlling, hard versus soft, dictator versus autocrat - Which one is the best? If you hope this article will answer that question you will be a little disappointed, however I would like to share some of my own experiences.\n\nI have had the great good fortune to be able to work my up from the shop floor to the Board room in two very different verticals and on that journey have had contact with some great leaders but also with some very poor so called managers (who sadly thought they were great leaders). There was the shouter, the screamer, the table thumper, the ‘do as I say’ advocate, the ‘do you know who I am’ boss, the passive glory taker, the invisible manager, the eager beaver, the completely clueless, the Walter Mitty, the influencer, the challenger, the positive reinforcer, the endorser, the team player, the trainer, the friend and the one person I will always refer to as The Gaffer despite it being over 20 years since I worked with him.\n\nYou will all recognise superiors you’ve worked with in the past as being somewhere in this range. Think about your current boss, which one is he/she? Or maybe I’ve missed one out, let me know.\n\nBut despite this range being very diverse it is impossible to not shape your own style of leadership by taking a small part of each of them and moulding it to your advantage. Those who make a success of leadership adapt their learnings and develop their own style, those who don’t simple become a parody from the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nMy own style of leadership has been shaped by the phrase ‘Celebrate the calm, quiet leader. While others talk - they listen. While others plot - they plan. While others panic – they act.’\n\nDuring my first few months as a Director I was challenged by an external business coach. He felt I didn’t speak enough in Directors’ meetings; I was too quiet. I politely asked him to give me an example of an occasion when this was the case and what would he have liked me to have said in that situation - sadly he couldn’t be specific. My response was to ask him what he thought of the contributions I had made in those meetings. He replied by saying I was always concise, accurate, authoritative and influential. I concluded the conversation by explaining to him that I will never become what I call a ‘talking head’, someone who speaks for the sake of speaking, loves the sound of their own voice and as a result doesn’t have influence because everybody else in the room just simply becomes unresponsive to them.\n\nThe noise around more vociferous leaders can be positive but the main issue they have is that they have a target on their back. They choose, through their demeanour, to be front and centre. They are there to be shot at all the time. As a result of this some of their alpha peers also try to assert their authority and challenge their place in the hierarchy by plotting against them. Politics and the fight for survival is then overtly displayed and is there for all colleagues to see and form judgement on. The quiet leader on the other hand cements their place at the head of a company through their expert use of emotional intelligence and the art of planning ahead. Covertly you might say but always efficiently effective when it comes to internal politics.\n\nAnd when leadership is required the most is usually at times of adversity and when that happens who do you want to look to? There is a tendency for the ‘talking heads’ to become invisible. They look to their less well paid, more experienced, more reliable subordinates to do all the thinking for them while they bask in the reflected glory of their team.\n\nSimilarly, the ‘politicians’ will look left and then look right to see which one of their colleagues is deeper in the mire than they are. Once their target has been identified they will form alliances and ensure their misery is compounded as much as possible. Not fully understanding that memories are long, and loyalties are strong.\n\nMy view on leadership is by no means unique but true leaders should ALWAYS be visible, accessible, effectively communicative, logical, calm, knowledgeable, direct, authoritative, empathetic and realistic. They should be outward facing and looking for solutions to match the business goals but with a consistent inward facing people-centric approach.\n\nIf a leader ever falls into the trap of believing that those who shout loudest and those who form political cohorts are the most powerful soon cease being true leaders. What skills they may have had once to encourage people to follow them on their journey will be erased. That is not to say that they may not be successful, for themselves, but they will have abdicated any claim to the title of being a true leader on the way.\n\nI’ve been influenced and inspired by quiet leaders and negatively affected by the talking heads and politicians. That has allowed me to spot each type from a very great distance and I now help others do the same and make positive changes. Any team, whether they are at a Board or Operational level, has these challenges but as true leaders it is vital that you possess the necessary skills and competencies to leave a positive footprint in the minds of your colleagues that cannot be erased.\n\nIt would be great to hear your shared experiences and debate, please feel free to get in touch."
