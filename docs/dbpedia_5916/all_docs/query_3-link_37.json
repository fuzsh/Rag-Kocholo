        "text": "PABLO — Dallas Durheim claimed to “feel nothing,” even after his car collided in the first couple of heats of Saturday night’s demolition derby.\n\nDurheim maintained a one-track mind as he remained focused on qualifying for the main event.\n\n“I really didn’t feel anything,” Durheim said. “When I got hit, I just put the car in reverse and drove off.”\n\nDurheim, who entered in his first-ever derbies, captured the big purse in the main event Saturday night at the Mission Valley Speedway in Pablo.\n\n“I plan on doing more derbys but I don’t know about this year,” Durheim, who is a rookie in the derby, said.\n\nDurheim, who will play for the Ronan Chiefs during the 2017 season (a team that qualified for the Class B quarterfinals last year) said he will now transition his focus on football.\n\n“I really don’t have much time now that I have to focus on football practice,” Durheim said. “They are having me play running back I guess. I am really not sure yet.”\n\nDurheim, whose father Tony Adams has raced since 1985 and retired from demolition derby competition at 59, said he has had “the fever” for a while.\n\n“I really got the fever and all of my family participates in the derby now,” Adams said. “A lot of times our driving habits are criticized but at the end of the night, we get into the money and that is all we care about.”\n\nAdams said he and his family are very conscious about their safety.\n\n“We are pretty well protected and everyone started following us in different ways to improve the safety of the sport,” Adams said. “Our number one point of emphasis is safety.”\n\nAdams, who had just received his 40-year pin as a journeyman lineman for Mission Valley Power, said he still gets nervous when he or one of his family members participates in the derby.\n\n“I still get nervous even though I am not driving and I get butterflies all over,” Adams said.\n\nAdams, whose family participates in powwows as dancers, said they do both as a “family.”\n\n“There is nothing better than spending time with your family,” Adams said.\n\nThe competitive dynamics in a violent motor sport such as a demolition derby can be complicated, Adams said.\n\n“The sport here is different,” Adams said. “We have a lot of different friends and a lot of different enemies. We shake hands, we are friends again and do team up with some people. Most of it’s ourselves.”"
