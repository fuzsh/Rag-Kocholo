        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. â The Kentucky Derby Festival introduced the five women selected for its 2024 Royal Court. The five princesses that make up the Royal Court will serve as ambassadors for the Derby Festival, the city of Louisville and the entire state, as they attend events throughout the year.\n\nâThe Royal Court Program has been a tradition for more than 60 years, and seeing the Derby Festival Princesses out in the community is one of the first signs that the Derby Festival season is around the corner,â said Matt Gibson, Kentucky Derby Festival president and CEO. âThese young women are academic scholars, leaders in their communities and have resumes packed with awards and achievements. Weâre honored to have them as our ambassadors.â\n\nThe 2024 Royal Court was selected from dozens of applicants for the program, representing over 15 colleges and universities from around Kentucky and throughout the region.

The two-week festival has grown since its inception in 1956 to include over 70 events ranging from the mini-marathon to the Pegasus Parade.\n\nThunder Over Louisville, the opening ceremonies for the Kentucky Derby Festival, will be on April 20, kicking off the festivities for the 150th Kentucky Derby on May 4."
