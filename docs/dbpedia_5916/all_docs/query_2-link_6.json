After all, the Run for the Roses does have a 150-year history for becoming the world’s most prestigious outdoor runway. To provide an atlas of attire for racing fans, the Churchill Downs team, along with Guest Editor Zanna Roberts Rassi, worked with treasured partners and official licensees as well as top designers from around the globe to curate the first ever official Style Guide for the 2024 Kentucky Derby. Mixing classic race day occasion wear with contemporary design, the guide honors decades of fashion inspiration by presenting a composite of heirloom elegance alongside today’s biggest trends.\n\nTonya Abeln\n\nSpring 2024\n\nRead More\n\nFall 2023 ISSUE\n\nThe Fresh Bloom of Influence and Inspiration\n\nWylie Caudill Brings His Signature Roses to the Official Art of the 150th Run for the Roses\n\nWylie Caudill’s journey into the world of art is a testament to the power of passion, perseverance and the powerfully transformative influence of social media. Initially harnessing his budding creativity as a chalk artist on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University (EKU), Wylie’s aim was to connect with people and establish a reputation for himself as he tried to find his place in this new phase of undergraduate life. Even with his vast imagination, he never envisioned this seemingly small and concentrated endeavor would ignite a deep love for large-scale artwork and pave the way for a successful career as a muralist.\n\nTonya Abeln\n\nFall 2023\n\nRead More\n\nDerby Review 2023 ISSUE\n\nKentucky Derby 149\n\nSaturday, May 5 at Churchill Downs Racetrack\n\nThe 149th running of the Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve was held before a spirited and vibrant crowd of over 150,000 fans under mostly sunny skies on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs Racetrack. A top-rank grade I stakes race for 3-year-old Thoroughbreds with a $3 million purse, the Kentucky Derby remains America’s longest continually-held sporting event and is often revered as the “Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports.” This year was no exception, as the exuberant crowd witnessed Mage triumph in America’s greatest race.\n\nDerby Review 2023\n\nRead More\n\nSpring 2023 ISSUE\n\nPaint the World Derby\n\n“It is not unusual for an artist to have such a specific point of view that the mere mention of their name evokes an immediate mental connection to their work. It is, however, a rare gift for an artist to completely embody that visual language in every facet of their life. Brazilian-born Romero Britto is the personification of his art in human form. The consistency of his artistic brand sparks familiarity and his larger-than-life personality is creative study in human connection. Both are iconic. Both illicit a dopamine effect of happiness. And both will be a major part of the 149 th Kentucky Derby”\n\nTonya Abeln\n\nSpring 2023\n\nRead More\n\nFALL 2022 ISSUE\n\nAn Unbeatable View\n\n“A new, larger and more beautiful paddock will debut for the 150th Kentucky Derby, to be held the first Saturday in May, 2024. A big project, estimated at $185-200 million. But one whose cost is dwarfed by expectations of something special, built in the heart of the racetrack. ‘The new paddock will be transformational for the track,’ promises Churchill Downs Racetrack General Manager Mike Ziegler. ‘It turns the whole focal point upon entering the racetrack to a grand paddock. And the first thing you’ll see upon walking in the gate is the Twin Spires.”\n\nBill Doolittle\n\nFall 2022\n\nRead More\n\nSPRING 2022 ISSUE\n\nThe Sun Shines Bright: Aimee Griffith and the Official Art of the Kentucky Derby\n\n“The artist chosen for the official artwork of the Kentucky Derby always has a unique story, but Aimee Griffith’s journey as an artist is especially intriguing. Born and raised in Bardstown, Kentucky, with fond memories of Thunder Over Louisville as a kid, Aimee didn’t truly begin her work as an artist until recent years. Though she took an art class in college, it wasn’t until her family’s relocatoin to Austrailia in 2016 that Aimee really began to come into her own as an artist. What began as trips to the free museums with her kids eventually led to her own urge to pick up a paint brush herself.”\n\nTony Lewis\n\nSpring 2022\n\nRead More\n\nFALL 2021 ISSUE\n\nThe Father of the Kentucky Derby: How Col. Matt Winn Established the Legacy of the Kentucky Derby\n\n“It is nearly impossible to speak of the Kentucky Derby without mentioning the name of Matt Winn. Born on June 30, 1861, in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Patrick Winn and Julia Flaherty Winn, Colonel Matt Winn – as he was popularly known due to his honorary title – has a story inextricably tied to the modern Kentucky Derby, serving on the management team of Churchill Downs from 1902 to 1949 and widely regarded as the father of the Derby as we know it today.”\n\nChris Goodlett\n\nFall 2021\n\nRead More\n\nSPRING 2021 ISSUE\n\nOvercoming Erasure:\n\nKentucky Derby Museum expands and enhances its ‘Black Heritage in Racing’ exhibition\n\n“As with much of American history, the contributions of Black horsemen to the legacy of the Kentucky Derby, though integral, are largely unknown to far too many of us. This spring, the Kentucky Derby Museum is doubling down on its efforts to remedy that erasure. Since 1993, the museum has hosted a permanent ‘Black Heritage in Racing’ exhibit on the second floor. But now, the exhibit moves downstairs to a 930-square-foot space to expand the stories of legendary Black horsemen through artifacts, oral history interviews and artwork.”\n\nKellie Doligale\n\nSpring 2021\n\nRead More\n\n2020 ISSUE\n\nRacing’s Keystone:\n\nA celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Twin Spires\n\n“Every object and significant building of the first 20 years of the Downs and the Derby – with the exception of the racetrack itself, which hasn’t moved an inch in 146 years – have been modified or removed. One has to say the ‘modern’ life of the ancient Downs begins with that grandstand and its spires: the heart of the track that grew from there and a continuing heartbeat of its history.”\n\nBill Doolittle\n\n2020\n\nRead More"
