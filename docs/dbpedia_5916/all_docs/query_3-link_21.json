        "text": "You don't need the man from the Grauniad to tell you that mistakes are a huge part of life. All walks: the official book of The Sopranos, for example, has a section devoted to malapropisms. Everyone has their favourite misheard lyric. And then there's football, in which people frequently pass off an erroneous perception or opinion as fact.\n\nTake Derby's two league championships in the 1970s. Some people think that both were won under the managership of Brian Clough. In a sense this is understandable: such is Clough's legend that the temptation to presume that he is responsible for everything good about Derby – from those two titles to Derby's oldest pub, the 478-year-old Ye Olde Dolphin Inne, to the railway service that allows you to escape the place – is considerable. But that is not the case, and the second title, claimed in 1974-75, three years after Clough's, was won by a thoroughly different but almost equally remarkable man: Dave Mackay.\n\nOr was it? Some feel that Mackay's title was basically Clough's title; that Clough had left such a good team that all Mackay had to do was write 11 names on a teamsheet. While Derby did have outstanding players, this is such an insulting and simplistic argument that it barely deserves the time of day. Right up to the last couple of years at Stamford Bridge, the history of football is pockmarked with cautionary tales about the enormous difficulties of walking into a dressing-room that had previously been run by a successful, legendary figure. As Clough himself found out.\n\nIf taking over from Clough was difficult enough, Mackay did so in the most extraordinary circumstances. When Clough was forced out by the chairman Sam Longson in October 1973, his disciples – who also happened to be his first-team squad – staged a sit-in at the ground (during which directors, scared to face them, locked themselves in the boardroom and had to discharge in a champagne bucket). They also threatened to go on an unprecedented strike, signed a letter asking for the reinstatement of Clough as part of the fans' Bring Back Clough campaign, and said they would no longer train under Mackay. To complicate this Rubik's Cube of a situation further, many of the players had shared the field with Mackay in his playing days at Derby during Clough's time.\n\nFor a month there was pandemonium, but Mackay showed first a diplomat's sang-froid and then his iron will. \"They are a schoolboys' eleven, not men,\" he said. \"I am a man and I like dealing with men, not misguided children. I will fight them to the death.\" Which, given that during his playing career Mackay established himself as the first indestructible human being, was pretty much that. In late November, the players publicly gave their support to Mackay and, having failed to win in the first eight games under him, rallied to finish third in the table. And then, in Mackay's first full season, they won the league.\n\n\"Mackay,\" wrote Clough in his autobiography, Walking On Water, \"came striding in as only a man of his courage and reputation could and was eventually to win Derby another championship.\" In this paper, Michael Carey wrote that, \"He was one man, maybe the only man, who could have ridden the storm out at Derby ... We are entitled to marvel at the miracle of Shaftesbury Crescent [as Derby's ground was known in those days], which 18 months ago was a black comedy entitled Can The Rams ever forget Brian Clough and find True Happiness by playing Somebodyelse's (sic) Football?\" Mackay was strong enough to withstand not only the rebellion but also, when he'd seen that off, Clough's presence around the ground; it is possible to imagine his ghost lingering like that of Nathaniel Sr in Six Feet Under. \"You sure you wanna sign Franny Lee, buddy boy?\"\n\nCrucially, Mackay knew his own mind and followed the instinctive, maverick genius of Clough the only way he possibly could: by not following him at all. It was a case of 'And now for something completely different'. Mackay encouraged an almost naive attacking football (they were top scorers in both his full seasons at the club), cut players more slack both on and off the pitch – \"he treated us more like men,\" said one – and ran the club with the strong, silent dignity he showed as a player, something which was in stark contrast to Clough's ostentatious bolshiness.\n\nHe was also very successful in the transfer market. Originally Mackay planned to rip up Clough's mutinous team, but instead settled for hugely significant tweaks. \"He wanted to start afresh this season,\" wrote Michael Carey in the Guardian on April 25 1975, just after Derby had clinched the title. \"But he admitted that in a footballing sense he had awakened to find a crock of gold at the foot of his bed, and even now he sometimes catches his breath when he writes the names on the teamsheet, names, of course, to which he has added those of [Francis] Lee, [Bruce] Rioch and [Rod] Thomas. All three have made more of an impact than anyone dared hope.\"\n\nRioch top-scored with 15 goals from midfield, and he and Lee (12) were part of a quartet responsible for 52 of Derby's 67 league goals. The others were the strikers, the brilliant Kevin Hector (13) and Roger Davies (12). The signing of Lee, who scored that interesting ... very interesting winner at his old club Manchester City in December, gave a slightly polite team a necessary swagger. Some Clough stalwarts – Colin Boulton, Colin Todd, the outstanding David Nish, Kevin Hector, Roger Davies – remained integral, but this was undeniably Mackay's team. He also sold Clough's dearest Johns, O'Hare and McGovern, back to him at Leeds, marginalised the excellent but ageing Alan Hinton and, for the title campaign, got only four games out of the injured Roy McFarland. He was replaced by the 29-year-old Peter Daniel, a perennial understudy who excelled in his big season.\n\nOne of Clough's men who stayed in the first XI, Davies scored five in one game, against Luton on 29 March, and when two days later Derby won 5-2 away at a good Burnley side their championship credentials were obvious. That had not always been the case. Derby were 10th at Christmas – only Liverpool, in 1981-82, have won the title from a worse position on 25 December – ninth on Valentine's Day, and didn't go top until the 39th game, which took them not halfway round the world, as Richard Scudamore would like nowadays, but straight to cloud nine. Derby also lost away to five of the bottom seven. But they were undeniably the best of a strong bunch in one of English football's more congested title races: they won eight and lost one of 11 games between the start of March and the last week of April, when they clinched the title. Pound for pound, given the fierceness of the competition, that's almost the equal of Arsenal's famous 13-match winning streak to clinch the league in 2001-02. They simply blew their rivals away.\n\nAs in 1972, Derby's triumph was confirmed while they weren't playing. This time, however, they won it with a game to spare, and heard of Ipswich's draw at Manchester City during their player of the year awards in a local nightclub. As Gerry Harrison wrote in The Times, \"The mood was right, the setting conducive, the champagne well chilled.\" A recall of what those champagne buckets had been used for 18 months previously showed how far the club had come, and how remarkable Mackay's achievement was."
