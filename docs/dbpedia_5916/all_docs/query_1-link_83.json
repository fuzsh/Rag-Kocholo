        "text": "Derby Entrepreneurship Center at Tufts (DEC) is humbled and honored to share that we are the proud recipient of a 10-year, $1 Million sustaining grant from Cummings Foundation’s $30 Million Grant Program. The $30 Million Grant Program awards $30M to 150 nonprofits every year – and DEC has been selected to win a ten-year grant. Having a 10-year grant makes all the difference in the world to our ability to invest in long term programming. We are very grateful to the Cummings Foundation for placing their trust in us and supporting our quest to build entrepreneurial leaders at Tufts.\n\nOn Thursday, June 13, DEC attended the Grant Winner Celebration hosted by Cummings Foundation, where the names of fellow grant recipients were read by Joyce and Bill Cummings. All of the nonprofits and causes in attendance came ready to cheer and DEC was no exception. Elaine Chen, Cummings Family Professor of the Practice in Entrepreneurship and Director of the Derby Entrepreneurship Center, and Morgan Dent, Communications Specialist at Tufts Gordon Institute, represented DEC at the event. Elaine even created branded signs to cheer with.\n\nElaine showed off her hand-made signs with the help of Tufts alumni Brad Hamilton, A86, and Elana Varon, J87, A24P, who also received a grant for their nonprofit: The Institute for Storycraft and Information Gathering.\n\nElaine poses for a photo with Joyce and Bill Cummings of Cummings Foundation.\n\nJoyce and Bill Cummings congratulated the evening’s grant recipients and celebrated the positive impact their various causes would have on the local community.\n\nTo learn more about the Derby Entrepreneurship Center at Tufts, please visit derbyecenter.tufts.edu.\n\nAbout Cummings Foundation"
