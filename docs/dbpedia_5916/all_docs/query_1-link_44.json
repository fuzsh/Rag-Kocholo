We’re excited to have Kristen join this prestigious group and look forward to the insights that each member of the 2019 class brings.\n\nThe ISA Elite program, now in its fifth year, includes three nights’ hotel accommodation and free entry to all education sessions at ISA International Sign Expo 2019, the sign, graphics, and visual communications industry’s leading event. It also includes unique networking opportunities with fellow professionals and industry leaders. A two-day follow-up leadership conference will be held in the fall.\n\nISA International Sign Expo takes place April 24-26 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, with education events starting on April 23.
