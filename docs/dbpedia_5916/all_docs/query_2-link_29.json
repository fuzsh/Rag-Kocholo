        "text": "The second pillar of my ABCD Framework is how to build strong partnerships with stakeholders. Richard T. at Nasdaq said your ability to listen and respond to #stakeholders whether or not they are fully on board with what you are trying to do is crucial. Taylor says he was once told by a C-level #leader that White #men were beginning to perceive themselves as being excluded from the company’s #diversity, #equity, and #inclusion efforts. “As a White man, this was tough to hear,” he says. “When I look around my organization, I see White people in positions of power everywhere.” However, he continues, “I realized that the words I used and the messages I communicated were very focused on #minority and marginalized communities. If all an #employee hears is how we’re focusing on #attracting, #retaining, and #advancing ‘diverse’ people, naturally they don’t see themselves in this picture and it creates a sense that ‘I don’t matter.’” US pre-orders: Amazon https://lnkd.in/gmDgpfz4 or Barnes & Noble - https://lnkd.in/gvazbuv8 UK pre-orders: Waterstones - https://lnkd.in/gPA7Nbd3, Blackwells - https://lnkd.in/gFGWyzb8, Foyles - https://lnkd.in/gB5YBXaw or Amazon UK - https://lnkd.in/gsG686Wt ….
