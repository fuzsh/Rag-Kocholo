        "text": "Governance\n\nThe Local Governing Board's Role\n\nIn accordance with the Governance handbook, all governing boards have three core functions:\n\nto ensure clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction\n\nto hold executive leaders to account for the educational performance of the academy and its pupils, and the performance of staff\n\nto oversee the financial performance of the academy and make sure its money is well spent\n\nOdyssey Collaborative Trust have chosen to have a Local Governing Board in each of the schools across the MAT (Multi-Academy Trust). The LGB is responsible for overseeing many of the strategic decisions of the school. A key role is to act as a 'critical friend': to support, to challenge, to ask questions and ultimately to represent the school community. The LGB works in close partnership with the Head Teacher, Staff and the Local Authority. Whilst the Head Teacher is responsible for the day to day running of the school, the governors are involved with such decisions as staffing, curriculum, school buildings and finance. They ensure the school functions well and maintains the proper range of academic and social objectives.\n\nThe Board of Trustees (Odyssey Collaborative Trust), work in collaboration with the LGB to ensure these functions can be fulfilled; the LGB and Board of Trustees maintain regular contact and put procedures in place to ensure the LGB report back to the Board of Trustees about the performance of the academy they oversee and the LGB's delegated functions.\n\nThe standard term of office for a governor is 4 years. The Chair and Vice Chair of Governors are elected annually at the first meeting of the academic year. They meet at least three times in an academic year and carry out governor visits into school.\n\nShould you wish to contact the Governors please email governor@springfield.derby.sch.uk\n\nor write to Chair of Governors\n\nC/O Springfield Primary School West Road Spondon Derby DE21 7AB\n\nBoard of Governors\n\nAttendance at Meetings\n\nCalendar of Meetings 2023-2024\n\nSupplemental Funding Agreement\n\nMinutes of Meetings\n\n16th June 2022\n\n10th March 2022"
