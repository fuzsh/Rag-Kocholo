        "text": "I began my professional career as a biological anthropologist studying primate behavior and comparative ecology. This path allowed me to live and work in some of the most biodiverse and threatened regions in the world, and fostered a profound and personal interest to become involved in applied research initiatives that contribute to sustainable management and environmental policy in a meaningful way. The transition to working on climate change impacts to biodiversity in the Chicago Wilderness region was a natural progression that grew from my graduate work on human-wildlife interactions. A main goal of my current work is to help build and renew positive relationships between people and the environment as sustainable partnerships that communities are empowered to create and continue.Professional: Past and present climate change; Historical and current interactions between humans and the environment; Climate change impacts to biodiversity; Landscape and ecosystem-based approaches to mitigation and adaptation; Comparative ecology; Climate science education.\n\nPersonal: Being outdoors in any capacity (hiking, biking, kayaking, camping); Gardening and native landscaping; Supporting the local live music scene; Creative cooking; Travel, travel, travel.\n\nSelected recent publications:\n\nBrandt, L., Derby Lewis, A., Scott, L., Fahey, B., Darling, L. and Swanston, C.

The application of this work includes 1) developing adaptation strategies for natural communities through collaborations with scientists, natural resource managers, and community leaders, 2) creating effective methods of communicating climate science to diverse audiences, 3) promoting the role that natural habitats play in responding to climate change and 4) understanding the role cities can play in wildlife conservation. My background of research, teaching, and training in the fields of anthropology, ecology and evolution, and climate science enables me to take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of climate change impacts to both natural and human communities, as well as communicate this information across a broad range of audiences."
