        "text": "Before using an abbreviation or acronym for a company, title, etc., double check the AP Stylebook. Try looking up either the acronym or the company name or check under the abbreviations and acronyms entry. Do not follow an organization’s full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes. If an abbreviation would not be clear on second reference, do not use it.\n\ntop\n\nFormal names of degrees are capitalized: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts or Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, etc. Shortened degree names are lowercased and use an apostrophe in bachelor’s degree, a master’s, etc., but there is no possessive in associate degree, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts or Master of Science. Avoid using abbreviations such as B.A. or M.A. Capitalize only when referring to the official name of the degree. The degree field is not capitalized unless it is the formal name of the degree: Master of Architecture, Master of Business Administration, Master of Agribusiness, but Master of Arts in teaching, Bachelor of Science in business administration, etc.\n\nExamples:\n\nbachelor’s degree in journalism and mass communications; master’s degree in education\n\nBachelor of Arts in journalism and mass communications; Master of Science in special education\n\nan associate degree\n\nShe earned her doctorate.\n\nfive master’s degree programs\n\ntop\n\nAcademic titles should be capitalized when they precede a name, but lowercased elsewhere. Spell out formal titles such as chancellor. In general, use professor as a title. Avoid using Ph.D. unless necessary to establish credentials and do not use professor and Ph.D. together. For a detailed explanation of each academic title, see Other references section.\n\nExamples:\n\nKansas State University President Richard Myers will attend the event.\n\nRichard Myers, president of Kansas State University, will attend the event.\n\nThe university president will attend the event.\n\nThe university recognized Tom Jones, professor of biology, for his accomplishments.\n\nThe university recognized Professor Tom Jones for his accomplishments.\n\nTom Jones, Ph.D., led the study.\n\ntop\n\nWhen writing addresses, spell out street, avenue and boulevard only when part of a formal street name without a number: Pennsylvania Avenue. Use the abbreviations St., Ave. and Blvd. only with a numbered address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. All similar words like alley, drive, road, terrace, place, etc., are always spelled out. It's easier to remember what words get abbreviations because they spell STAB. Use figures when writing numbers in an address but spell out and capitalize First through Ninth when used as street names. See addresses in the AP Stylebook.\n\ntop\n\nUse the singular form when referring to the admission process. Use the plural form when referring to the university office.\n\nExample: The Office of Admissions helps students with the admission process.\n\ntop\n\nSecond reference: Ahearn or the field house. Field house is written as two words when used with Ahearn and when used as a common noun, but some field houses at other universities are spelled as one word.

The ampersand — & — should only be used if part of the college or company's formal name: College of Architecture, Planning & Design or Procter & Gamble. The ampersand should not otherwise be used in place of and, except for some accepted abbreviations: B&B, R&B.\n\ntop\n\nSecond reference: the unit.
