        "text": "When you quote directly or paraphrase from a source (book, article, or webpage) in your paper, you need to insert an in-text citation.\n\nCheck out the new APA In-Text Citation Checklist!\n\nYou have two format options: parenthetical and narrative\n\nParenthetical In-Text Citation\n\nThis citation typically consists of the author’s last name(s), year of publication, and page number in parentheses at the end of the sentence. The period goes after the closed parenthesis.\n\n“This is a direct citation” (Chapman, 2019, p. 126).\n\nWhen paraphrasing the idea in your own words, do not use quotation marks; page numbers are not required (Jackson, 1999).\n\nNarrative In-Text Citation\n\nAnother option is to use the author’s name in the sentence, followed directly by the year in parentheses, with the page numbers in parentheses at the end of the sentence.\n\nAccording to Chapman (2019), \"This is a direct citation\" (p. 216).\n\nJackson (1999) explains that when paraphrasing the idea in your own words, do not use quotation marks. Page numbers are not required.\n\nAdditional Resources from the Excelsior College Online Writing Lab:\n\nAPA Citations in the Body of Your Paper: multiple examples\n\nAPA Side by Side: Examples that \"provide reference information and corresponding in-text citation information for common source types and situations you are likely to encounter while working with your sources\".\n\nDirect Quoting - When you are using someone else's exact words.\n\nIf you are using a quote that is less than 40 words, enclose the quote in quotation marks and add the author’s name (unless it is already in the sentence), year of publication and page numbers (if there are any) in parentheses. Place this reference where a pause would occur or at the end of the sentence. Punctuation marks should be placed after the parenthetical citation. You also will need to add each work from which you cite to your Works Cited page. Here are two examples:\n\nThe article goes on to say that “People don't do derby just for exercise but usually because it becomes a part of who they are” (Fagundes, 2012, p.1098).\n\nFagundes (2012) believes that roller derby gives participants \"a chance to feel like a superstar\" (p. 1098).\n\nIf you are using a quote that is more than 40 words, do not use quotation marks. Instead, put the quote on a new line and indent the whole block approximately 1/2 inch from the left margin. Keep the quote double-spaced. Remember to add a parenthetical citation and put the work on your References page. The parenthetical citation comes after the final punctuation mark. This is called a Block Quotation.\n\nHe asserts the following:\n\nMore importantly, though, the notion of competing under derby names was a perfect fit with the recent reimagination of the sport as a punk-rock spectacle that allowed, and encouraged, participants to develop outrageous public personas. The story of derby-name emergence probably has more to do with coincidence and path dependence than with conscious design. Derby pioneer Ivanna S. Pankin’s classic derby name pre-dated her founding of Arizona Roller Derby in 2003. Rather, it was a handle and email address she used as a musician in Phoenix’s punk rock scene. When she publicized her nascent league using the alias Ivanna S. Pankin, and the entire Austin scene was already using skate names, the leagues that popped up in their wake followed suit, and the practice of using colorful nicknames has been used by virtually all derby leagues and skaters since. (Fagundes, 2012, pp.1093-1094)\n\nParaphrasing - Restating others' ideas in your own words.\n\nIf you mention the author’s name in the paragraph, then just put the date in parentheses directly after the author's name.\n\nFagundes (2012) believes it is hard to pin down when the practice of skating under a pseudonym began.\n\nIf you do not mention the author’s name, then include the author’s name in parentheses before the date.\n\nIt is hard to pin down when the practice of skating under a pseudonym began (Fagundes, 2012).\n\nAccording to the official APA Style & Grammar Guidelines sections on Citing Specific Parts of a Source and Direct Quotation of Materials without Page Numbers, you have several options when quoting sources that do not have page numbers (webpages, eBooks, etc.). Use the option that will best help your reader find the quotation in the source.\n\nProvide a paragraph number; you will probably have to count them manually.\n\nAccording to the IceBridge Project leader, \" in addition to the airborne and satellite measurements, scientists will be out on the ice taking height and density measurements as well\" (Gray, 2019, para. 6). Source\n\nProvide a heading or section name.\n\nMedical consensus is that the flu is spread \"mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019, How Flu Spreads section). Source\n\nProvide an abbreviated heading or section name in quotation marks if the name is too long or unwieldy to cite in full.\n\nResearch has shown that an average of 8% of the U.S. population experiences flu symptoms each flu season,\" with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019, \"How Many People\" section). Source\n\nProvide a heading or section name, plus a paragraph number within that section.\n\nThompson's research is focused on understanding \"factors that support speech-in-noise ability in early childhood\" (DeAngelis, 2018, Auditory Neurodevelopment section, para. 4). Source\n\nUse the same formats for both print books and e-books. For e-books, the format (e.g. PDF, EPUB), platform (e.g. Ebook Central, OpenStax), or device (e.g., Kindle) is not included in the reference.\n\nIf an e-book without a DOI has a stable URL that will resolve for all readers, include the URL of the book.\n\nInclude a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), when it is available.\n\nBasic Book Formats\n\nAuthor, A.

Marstiller, 2022)\n\nFrom the APA Style section on Personal Communications:\n\n\"To describe Traditional Knowledge or Oral Traditions that are not recorded (and therefore are not recoverable by readers), provide as much detail in the in-text citation as is necessary to describe the content and to contextualize the origin of the information. For example, if you spoke with an Indigenous person directly to learn information (but they were not a research participant), use a variation of the personal communication citation.\n\nProvide the person’s full name and the nation or specific Indigenous group to which they belong, as well as their location or other details about them as relevant, followed by the words “personal communication,” and the date of the communication.\n\nProvide an exact date of correspondence if available; if correspondence took place over a period of time, provide a more general date or a range of dates. The date refers to when you consulted with the person, not to when the information originated.\n\nEnsure that the person agrees to have their name included in your paper and confirms the accuracy and appropriateness of the information you present.\n\nBecause there is no recoverable source, a reference list entry is not used.\"\n\nAPA issued preliminary guidance on an April 7, 2023 blog post: How to Cite ChatGPT\n\nQuoting or reproducing the text created by ChatGPT in your paper\n\nRemember that the results of a ChatGPT chat you did are not accessible by others.
