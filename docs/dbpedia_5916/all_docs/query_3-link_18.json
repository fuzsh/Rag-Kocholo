        "text": "All horses must be enrolled in the USHJA International Hunter Derby program during the current competition year to be eligible to compete.\n\nThe Championship awarded over $223,000 in 2023, and once again 80% of the entry fees as well as a portion of enrollment fees will be added to the guaranteed $100,000 to create the total prize money purse. The entry fee for the Championship is $1,000. Eighty percent of the total prize money will be awarded to Tier I IHD Championship final standings. Twenty percent of the total prize money will be awarded to Tier II final standings. The Derby Challenge will offer $10,000 in prize money, paid out to the top twelve horses.\n\nAll horses must enter with the horse show by July 24. Pre Entry fees are $1,000. Any horses entered after that date will pay the Post Entry Fee of $3,000.\n\nExhibitors can enter online at https://entries.showmanagementsystem.com/login or enter via paper entry forms. Exhibitors are required to complete both the Championship entry form and the Bluegrass Festival Horse Show entry form. All entry forms, entry fees, stall fees, drug fees, night watch fees and all other applicable fees are paid to the Bluegrass Festival Horse Show.\n\nEntries must be received in the Bluegrass Festival Horse Show office or postmarked by July 24, 2024. The entry fee, including premium entry fee if applicable, is non-refundable after August 2, 2024. The ground jury reserves the right to accept or refuse entries after the closing date due to extenuating circumstances, on a case by case basis, and late entries are not guaranteed. If permitted, late entries will incur a $250 late entry fee. It is recommended that you use a method of delivery which provides delivery confirmation.\n\nInvitations\n\nUSHJA will email invitations to compete in the 2024 Platinum Performance/USHJA International Hunter Derby Championship to recorded owners and riders of eligible horses in June. The Invitation will include a USHJA International Hunter Derby entry form and a link to the online prize list.\n\nClassic Hunter Round\n\nAll entered horses compete in the first round of competition over a Classic Hunter course featuring International Hunter Derby style fences, including height options. Based on scores in the Classic Hunter round, horse-and-rider combinations advance to one of two possible second rounds: 1) the Handy Hunter Round (split into two sections) or 2) the Derby Challenge.\n\nHandy Hunter Round\n\nFor the second phase of competition, riders are grouped into two tiers based on their amount of Derby money won in the previous competition year; to be classified as Tier I, a rider must have been standing 40th or higher on the IHD Rider Money Won list as of December 1, 2022. All other riders are classified as Tier II.\n\nThe top 20 overall horse-and-rider combinations from the Classic Hunter round will be invited to compete in the Tier I Handy Hunter Round, and will be eligible for 80 percent of the prize money and the title of USHJA International Hunter Derby Champion. The top 20 horses ridden by a Tier II rider from the Classic Hunter round, including those invited as part of Tier I Handy Hunter Round, will be invited to compete in the Tier II Handy Hunter Round, and will be eligible to win 20 percent of the total prize money. Tier II riders competing in the Tier I Handy Round are eligible for prize money in both categories. USHJA may invite additional horse-and-rider combinations to either section of the Handy Hunter round at the organizationâ€™s sole discretion.\n\nFinal placings in both tiers are based off of composite scores from the Classic Hunter and Handy Hunter Rounds.\n\nDerby Challenge\n\nThe Derby Challenge is open to all horses that did not qualify for Tier I or Tier II Handy Hunter Round, guaranteeing each entry in the Championship two rounds of competition. Each horse starts the Derby Challenge with a clean slate, where no scores from the Classic Hunter Round carry forward. Horses compete for $10,000 in prize money with the top 12 horses taking home a share of the prize money."
