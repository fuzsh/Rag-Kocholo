Market Street in Akron.\n\nAfter leaving the Akron Area YMCA in 2011, he served as chief executive officer of a four-county YMCA based in Batavia, New York through 2014 and as chief advancement officer of the Lake County YMCA in Painesville, Ohio, from 2015 through 2017.\n\nTaylor served as executive director of Habitat Humanity of Mahoning County, based in Youngstown, Ohio, from 2018 until mid-2022.
