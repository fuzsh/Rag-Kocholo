        "text": "The Department for Transport (DfT) has today confirmed that Derby is to be the location for the planned Great British Railways (GBR) headquarters.\n\nGBR will be a new government body which will absorb Network Rail and also undertake an organisational role with the operation of train services too. It was a key outcome of the William-Shapps Plan for Rail, published in May 2021, with the purpose of ending fragmentation and integrating the country’s railways.\n\nIn a press briefing, transport minister Huw Merriman confirmed Derby delivered on all fronts in terms of where the GBR headquarters should be located. Each potential site was rated on five criteria that were then assessed along with a public vote. The five criteria assessed were levelling up, what it can offer GBR, value for money, connectivity, rail heritage/links to network, along with public support. Derby gained 45,600 votes - 5,000 more than any of the five other sites considered. The other potential locations were Birmingham, Crewe, Doncaster, Newcastle and York.\n\nThe proposed location for the GBR headquarters is the Railway Technical Centre, the first part of which was opened in 1964.\n\nA review of the potential locations for the headquarters by NCE last year revealed that Derby is the only city to have manufactured rolling stock continuously since 1840, a tradition that continues today with Alstom supplying the new HS2 trains.\n\nDerby City Council leader Chris Poulter said: “We're absolutely thrilled that Derby has been selected to become the new home of GBR. This result is a testament to the hard work of our team, alongside our key rail and city partners based across Derby - we couldn't have done it without them.\n\n“Rail heritage is at the heart of our city and for this to be recognised by Government is a fantastic achievement. The investment we’ll see from this significant move will be huge, not only just for Derby but for levelling up across the whole of the wider East Midlands.\n\n“Not only do we have Europe's largest rail cluster centred right here in Derby, but we also have a rich history of being the only city in the UK to have manufactured rolling stock continuously since 1840. I'm thrilled that Derby's heritage is being recognised in this defining way. We can’t wait to see what this momentous move will mean for Derby and its citizens in the future.”\n\nWhile transport secretary Mark Harper committed to GBR in this year's George Bradshaw address, delivered at the ICE, ministers are still working to get the legislation needed to switch powers over from Network Rail through parliament.\n\nMerriman assured delays with the passage of the bill to form GBR have not slowed the project down at all and more has been able to be achieved than if the legislation was passed at the start of the year. He said that the legislation is currently in the pipeline as an application has been made and is currently being assessed with the hope of being mentioned in the next King’s Speech.\n\nCurrent plans will see GBR own the railway infrastructure, collect fare revenue, run trains and plan the network and set most fares and timetables. The package of reforms aims to ensure that Britain’s railways become more customer focused and financially sustainable.\n\nHarper said in a statement: “It’s full steam ahead for the reform of our railways and today’s announcement is not only a huge win for the brilliant city of Derby, but a key milestone for the entire rail industry across the country.\n\n“GBR will put the passenger first, promoting collaboration and innovation across a joined-up, efficient and modern network.”\n\nMerriman added that while Derby will be the central hub for GBR, the project intends to devolve more powers to regional sections of the planned body than currently exists within Network Rail. This means the setting up of regional headquarters across the country allowing each authority to choose what is best for the railways to serve their communities. He said that while having a headquarters is essential and will be very beneficial for Derby, the body will very much be looking to devolve powers amongst each region.\n\nMidlands Connect chief executive Maria Machancoses said: “I am thrilled to hear Derby has been selected as the home for the new GBR headquarters.\n\n\"It is an excellent choice; Derby is right in the heart of the country and is home to the greatest cluster of rail sector businesses in the UK and indeed Europe making it a perfect location for the home of GBR.\n\n\"Investing in Derby is a therefore a clear vote of confidence for the rail industry bringing a host of job opportunities to the region and we look forward to working together with GBR on our plans, including the Midlands Rail Hub.”"
