Some of the resident Jesuits are retired, while others work in the community or are staff members of the Jesuit Center.\n\n“Generally we are in a bit of a transition,” Derby said, noting the religious residential community has gotten smaller as its members have aged.\n\nSusan Bowers Baker formerly was the director of spirituality programs at the Jesuit Center and she continues to work part time on Derby’s staff.\n\nOne of Derby’s goals in his newly created position is to dispel rumors about the future of the Jesuit Center, which he said is not threatened.\n\nThe center continues to offer programs, religious retreats and activities for students of all ages as well as those in other denominations.\n\n“We are also trying to encourage a connection between spirituality and the arts,” Derby said.\n\nHe has established an art room, hoping to bring in more visual artists and musicians to develop retreat programming.\n\nMusical programming, in particular, appeals to Derby, who is a vocalist with the Ignatian Schola, a musical ensemble including Jesuits and colleagues, rooted in Ignatian spirituality. It performs at Jesuit spirituality-related events on the East Coast. Derby said he continues to perform infrequently with the musical group, which is based mostly in New York.\n\nDerby, a native of Long Island, N.Y., still has family members there as well as an aunt in Lancaster County.\n\nHe earned his bachelor of arts degree in religion at Kenyon College and holds master’s degrees in English from Fordham University and theological studies from Boston College.\n\nDerby worked in middle and secondary education at Nativity Mission Center and Xavier High School in New York City as well as in Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nHe also served for five years as director of vocations for the New York and Maryland Provinces of the Society of Jesus.\n\nDerby’s first encounter with the Jesuit Center was when he was a Jesuit novice and made a 30-day retreat there. He returned many times as a retreatant.\n\nHe noted the property covers 240 acres, mostly wooded, with some farmland that is rented out. There is also a cemetery on the property for the Jesuit community as well as a labyrinth, groves and religious statues. In short, it’s a perfect place for a spiritual retreat.\n\n“I find that people here turn a corner and find a new piece of art or a vista,” he said.\n\nAn upcoming directed retreat from Jan. 26-28 is already sold out. Derby said directed retreats are largely silent, although participants do meet one on one with a spiritual director.\n\n“In many cases, they (participants) are working on their relationship with God as they have come to know God,” Derby explained.\n\nAnother retreat, from March 16-18, is geared to those who are personal or professional caregivers to others. There are still openings for that event, which also will feature music by the local music group Opus One.\n\n“It will be a good opportunity for those who do a lot of caring to get some TLC in return,” Derby observed.\n\nOther upcoming programs:\n\nFeb 14: Two sessions of a four-hour Lenten program, “Lent: A Season of Grace,” led by Linda Robinson.\n\nApril 2-6: Jody Cole will return to lead her popular icon writing retreat.\n\nMay 11-13: A Mother’s Day retreat featuring a speaker who is a spiritual writer as well as a mother and a grandmother.\n\nTo register for a program or for more information, go to jesuitcenter.org.\n\nContact Carol Balinski: 610-371-5007 or cbalinski@readingeagle.com.\n\nOriginally Published: January 13, 2018 at 12:00 a.m."
