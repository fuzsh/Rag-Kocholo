        "text": "The final round of the Home Run Derby always reminds that for as much as this is a competition of brute power, it is also a test of elite endurance.\n\nNeeding 14 home runs to take the crown from Teoscar Hernández, Bobby Witt Jr.’s hands appeared slower. His bat path at times became longer. Witt, however, blasted four home runs in the final eight swings of his regular round, entering the bonus period with 11 home runs.\n\nThe product of nearby Colleyville, Texas, earned a bonus swing with a mammoth 450 foot home run in the extra period. On his final swing, with 13 home runs, Witt smoked a ball that died in center field and hit off the bottom of the wall.\n\nThat means Hernández, the Dodgers’ outfielder, is this year’s Home Run Derby champion.\n\nARLINGTON, Texas — When Teoscar Hernández was with the Houston Astros as a rookie, he was a bottom-of-the-order role player. With the Toronto Blue Jays in his prime, Hernández was overshadowed by younger homegrown talent. Now with the high-wattage Los Angeles Dodgers, Hernández is the guy who hits behind Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and the rest of the Hollywood superstars.\n\nOn Monday night, it was Hernández’s turn to take the spotlight.\n\nNearly eliminated in both the first and second rounds, Hernández became the first Dodgers player ever to win the Home Run Derby when he topped Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. in the final round. Witt’s final swing of the night would have tied but fell just short in center field.\n\n“If I have to bet, it doesn’t matter who I’m going against, I’m going to bet on myself,” Hernández said. “People maybe underestimate myself, and you could see it at the end when Witt was hitting all those homers. But I’m here.”\n\nHernández was one away from elimination in the first round, and he advanced to the finals by beating Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm in a second-round swing-off. In the finals, Hernández hit 14 home runs. Witt had 13, and his final swing of the night fell just short, hitting the base of center field wall, just feet from tying the competition.\n\n“Oh man, I was nervous,” Hernández said. “That God it didn’t go out, so, super happy.”\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nAfter his 21 home runs in Round 1, Alec Bohm struggled through his first nine swings. After 17 swings, he had mustered only three home runs. His swing flattened out as if he were partaking in a base-hit derby. Then, suddenly, the home runs started flying.\n\nHis myriad Phillies teammates started cheering off to the side. With the clock winding down in regulation, Bohm tied Teoscar Hernández at 14 home runs. He hit a ball that hooked foul as time expired. In the bonus round, Bohm just got under two balls that fell short of the fence.\n\nBohm and Hernández are headed for a swing-off.\n\nTeoscar Hernández got off to a slow start in the semifinals. Perez noticed on the broadcast that Hernández had incorporated a toe-tap into his approach, and it took him several swings before he went deep. He managed only three homers before his timeout with 22 swings left.\n\nDuring the break, he chatted with former Toronto teammate Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who won this event last year. He re-directed his aim toward the left-field wall, rather than center, and experienced better results: 13 homers in regulation. He could only produce one more.\n\nSo Alec Bohm will need to beat 14 to advance to the finals against Witt.\n\nAs the ESPN broadcast noted, only two shortstops have ever won the Home Run Derby. Both of them played for the Baltimore Orioles — Cal Ripken Jr. (1991) and Miguel Tejada (2004).\n\nGunnar Henderson entered the night as one of the most popular picks to win this derby. But he will not join the list of Orioles shortstops to win the crown. Henderson did not homer until his 10th swing Monday, chopping low line drives into the outfield at the outset of his round.\n\nOnce Henderson began lifting the ball, he homered on four straight swings but still finished regulation with only 11 home runs. Henderson’s Scooby-Doo themed “Zoinks!” bat won’t get any more use this evening."
