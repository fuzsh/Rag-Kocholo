        "text": "Our Mission\n\nOur league is dedicated to youth empowerment through the sport of roller derby. ​We provide opportunities for all youth skaters, from beginner through advanced, ages 7+. Our mission is to nurture bold self-confidence in skaters by developing teamwork and athletic ability while treasuring individuality in a culture of integration, encouragement and service to others. We strive to enable derby athletes and teams to reach their full potential, to be competitive at the highest level of roller derby, and to become valuable contributors to our community.\n\n​League History\n\nSanta Cruz Derby Groms was founded over a decade ago, having started as a summer camp in 2009 run by the Santa Cruz Derby Girls. Between 2010 and 2015 the league operated seasonally and was maxed out at 40 skaters. In 2015, the Groms became members of the Junior Roller Derby Association (JRDA) and competed for world rankings and championships for the first time. The league shifted to year-round operation in 2016 and began to grow with the addition of the Grommets Training Program in 2017, expanding accessibility to junior roller derby to more of our community's youth. This time period also coincides with the rise of our competitive team within the JRDA rankings, including our league's first gold medal national championship title win in 2018. By 2019 the Groms had matured into a fully functional independent league and completed the process of forming our own 501(c)(3) volunteer run non-profit. Our league now has over 150 skaters within the Grommets training program, age division home teams, and our JRDA charter teams.\n\n​We've expanded our offerings in 2024 through the formation of a new competitive team for our age out skaters 18+. Our Groms Legacy WFTDA (Women's Flat Track Derby Association) team provides opportunities for Groms skaters who are aging out of junior derby and want to continue playing competitive roller derby at the highest level while maintaining the strong bonds with our coaches and our league. We're excited to see what Groms Legacy can accomplish!\n\nContribution to the Community\n\nOur coaches challenge our youth athletes to achieve their full potential as roller derby athletes and we have been successful. The Groms are a top performing league within the JRDA, have qualified for the world championship tournament for the past 7 seasons, and have advanced to the final championship game for the last 6 seasons, taking home 6 medals, including gold and the national championship title in 2018, 2023, and 2024.\n\nWe have found that junior roller derby is much more rewarding than just achieving greatness on the track. The opportunities that we provide for youth, and especially for young women, has yielded amazing benefits. Through their involvement with the sport and our derby community, we consistently see and hear from parents about their growth in self-confidence, positive body image, leadership and team working skills, and what it takes to build trust and accountability. They participate in healthy competition as a team and together they learn that it’s OK to be heard, to take up space, and to aggressively pursue their goals both on and off the track.\n\nWe are starting to see skaters that started with our league a decade ago heading out into the world as adults as they turn 18. Twenty-seven skaters have graduated from our junior league, with nearly all of them pursuing higher education. Those that are studying locally also give back to our derby program by serving as coaches, helping to bring up the next generation of confident young women. We are extremely proud of all of these kids and look forward to seeing the great things that they go on to accomplish in the world!\n\nVision for the Future\n\nOur vision for the future is made up of three main goals outlined below. We need your help to achieve our goals as a volunteer or donor. ​"
