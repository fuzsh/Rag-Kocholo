        "text": "1900 to 1910\n\nThe turn of the century saw Derby maintain their position in the upper reaches of Division One while Bloomer was continuing to see off all who came up against him.\n\nHe scored his 200th goal in November 1901, a figure only one other Derby player - Kevin Hector - has passed.\n\nDerby were back at Crystal Palace for another FA Cup final in 1903, but with Bloomer out injured and a goalkeeper also struggling, it wasn't to be.\n\nBury's 6-0 success still stands today as the highest winning margin in an FA Cup final.\n\nAnd midway through the 1905/06 season came news that rocked Derby - Bloomer had been sold to Middlesbrough, and the following year his loss was felt as the club suffered relegation for the first time.\n\nJimmy Methven was appointed manager in August 1906 and played the last of his 511 games for the club that season, but couldn't prevent them losing their Division One status.\n\nDerby gradually improved their Division Two position over the next three seasons and in 1909/10 they were a solitary point away from winning promotion, having been beaten by Oldham Athletic in game 36 of 38.\n\nDerby finished fourth on 53 points, tied with Hull City and Oldham, and it was the Latics who would celebrate top-flight football that year.\n\nIn that very same season Alf Bentley became the first Derby player to reach the 30-goal mark - something even the great Steve Bloomer hadn't managed.\n\n1910 to 1920\n\nSteve Bloomer was back in a Derby shirt in October 1910 at the age of 35, and he made an immediate impact with two goals in a 5-0 victory over Lincoln City in his first game back.\n\nAnd the following season his impact was there for all to see as Derby won promotion back to Division One after finishing top of the table.\n\nBloomer scored 18 league goals as the Rams clinched the championship thanks to a 2-0 win at Barnsley on the final day of the season, thanks to a superior goal average compared to second-placed Chelsea.\n\nOn April 26 1913, Ernald Scattergood became the first - and so far the only - goalkeeper to score for Derby County, when he netted a penalty in a 1-1 draw at Manchester City on the final day of the season.\n\nScattergood went on to net two more goals in a Rams shirt - both penalties.\n\nBloomer remained a prolific scorer right up past his 40th birthday but he only played five times in 1913/14, scoring twice, as Derby finished bottom of Division One and suffered their second relegation.\n\nBloomer scored 332 goals for the club in 525 games and is still Derby's leading all-time goalscorer, while only three players - Kevin Hector, Ron Webster and Roy McFarland - have made more appearances.\n\nHaving dropped out of the top-flight in 1914, Derby bounced straight back the following season as they became Division Two champions again.\n\nThe 1914/15 campaign was the last in league football until 1919/20, due to the First World War.\n\nWhen football resumed, the Rams comfortably held on to their top-flight status.\n\n1920 to 1930\n\nThe turbulent run continued in 1920/21 as Derby, still under Jimmy Methven's management, dropped out of Division One again.\n\nMethven departed the Baseball Ground the following season following 31 years at the club, as player and manager, and a final 12th in Division Two was Derby's lowest-ever finish.\n\nA breeze of excitement blew through football across the country in 1922/23 with news that Wembley Stadium would host the FA Cup final for the first time.\n\nAnd the Rams, now under the control of Cecil Potter, fell just short of going all the way.\n\nPotter guided Derby all the way to the semi-final, a fine achievement for a team outside of the top-flight, but they were beaten 5-2 by West Ham United - who were also in Division Two.\n\nDerby finished third for two successive seasons, when both times they should have secured a top-two spot and promotion, but when George Jobey took over for the 1925/26 campaign they went one step better.\n\nJobey's Derby finished second in the table and top-flight football returned to the Baseball Ground - now owned by the club after they purchased it from Francis Ley in 1924.\n\nThe Baseball Ground was beginning to take shape and a then-record 30,557 packed in to see Derby take on Bolton Wanderers in December 1926, a couple of months after the new main stand on Shaftsbury Crescent was opened.\n\nJobey's Rams were scoring goals for fun but they were also conceding them at an alarming rate too, though they were establishing themselves firmly in the upper-reaches of the top-flight.\n\nIn 1929/30 they finished second in Division One for only the second time in their history, ten points behind eventual champions Sheffield Wednesday, having scored 90 and conceded 82 in 42 games.\n\n1930 to 1940\n\nJack Bowers smashed the club's goalscoring record with 37 league goals in 1930/31 and 39 overall, at more than one per game.\n\nDerby were continuing to sit solidly in Division One, never threatening honours but not looking like going down, and in 1932/33 Bowers extended his goals-in-a-season record to 43 in all games.\n\nThat tally still stands today.\n\nDerby were FA Cup semi-finalists that season, where they lost 3-2 to Manchester City, and in the quarter-final the Baseball Ground's attendance record was broken again when 34,218 witnessed a 4-4 draw with Sunderland.\n\nThat figure was beaten once more the following season when Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten 3-0 in front of 37,727 - this after a double-decker stand at the Osmaston End had been completed.\n\nBowers suffered a knee injury in 1934/35 so Hughie Gallacher came in for what now seems a modest £2,750, but he was soon filling his boots with 23 goals in his 27 games that season.\n\nDerby finished second again the following year and the attendance record was smashed again as 37,830 were present to see Nottingham Forest beaten 2-0 in the FA Cup.\n\nThe Baseball Ground was really coming to life with the Normanton End stand now open.\n\nJobey was still in charge at the end of the decade as Derby finished sixth in 1938/39, only for football to be interrupted due to war once more.\n\nIn September 1932, Jack Nicholas had embarked on a run that saw him play an amazing 328 out of 331 league games up to the end of 38/39.\n\nThere was still more to come from the inspirational defender.\n\n1970 to 1980\n\nThe Rams began the decade by winning silverware, the Watney Cup, an out-of-season invitational event, by beating Manchester United at the Baseball Ground.\n\nTheir transfer record was raised again, to £170,000 for centre-half Colin Todd, though in 1970/71 Derby finished only ninth in Division One - little indication of what was to follow.\n\nDerby didn't lose a league game in 1971/72 until the middle of October, by which time they had established themselves among the chasing pack at the top of the division.\n\nAs the season went on there was a feeling that maybe, just maybe, the club from what was then just a town could ruffle the feathers of the big-city outfits and claim the championship for the first time in its history.\n\nThe title race went right to the wire and on May 1 1972, when Derby beat Liverpool in their final game of the season they were in pole position.\n\nHowever, it was out of their hands. Both Leeds United and Liverpool, still with a game to play, could overtake them at the top of the table.\n\nIt was a nervous few days in Derby but the players - on an end-of-season trip to Majorca - had their dreams realised when both results went their way.\n\nDerby, runners-up three times, were the champions of England for the first time in their history.\n\nIt also wasn't the only silverware they picked up during the season.\n\nThe Rams claimed the Texaco Cup, while their reserves won the Central League, completing an unprecedented trophy treble for the club.\n\nThey used only 16 players all season, of which just 12 could class themselves as regulars on the teamsheet, making their triumph even more remarkable.\n\nEuropean football came to Derby for the first time, and the Rams were dining at the top table of the European Cup.\n\nPortugese giants Benfica were drawn out in the second round for a trip to the Baseball Ground, and nothing could prepare them for what lay in wait.\n\nEven the legendary Eusebio was powerless as Roy McFarland, Kevin Hector and Jon McGovern sent the home fans into raptures with three first-half goals that put Derby in command.\n\nThe second leg, at the intimidating Estadio du Luz, was one Derby had to defend in but they did their job superbly to return home with a 0-0 draw and a place in the quarter-final.\n\nCzechoslovakian champions Spartak Trnava were seen off and all of a sudden the Rams were just 180 minutes away from the European Cup final.\n\nStanding in their way was the Grand Old Lady of Turin, Juventus.\n\nThe first leg over in Italy was a controversial affair.\n\nJuventus won it 3-1, but McFarland and Archie Gemmill picked up their second yellow cards of the tournament, ruling them out of the return.\n\nDerby gave it everything they had but it was not to be. Roger Davies was sent off, Alan Hinton missed a penalty, and their dreams of going all the way were over.\n\nIn the league they finished ninth, and in October 1973 the club was in turmoil after the resignation of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor following disputes with the board.\n\nAt a time when Derby County should have been establishing itself as one of the leading lights in the English game, they were back to the drawing board.\n\nIf the fans couldn't keep Clough, then only one man could seriously be considered to take over - the man who had helped galvanise the club upon his arrival in 1968.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Clough and Taylor was never going to be easy, but Mackay - and his assistant Des Anderson - steadied the ship and indeed took Derby to third in 1973/74, earning them a place in the UEFA Cup.\n\nThey, too, would have plenty more to come their way.\n\nIn the summer of 74 they landed the experienced Francis Lee from Manchester City, and that would prove an inspired capture.\n\nThe UEFA Cup adventure lasted as far as round three, and defeat by Velez Mostar of Yugoslavia, though in the previous round the Rams had gone to Spain and put out Atletico Madrid after a penalty shoot-out.\n\nDivision One was tightly-fought all season and Derby were never too many points adrift of the leading pack, even if they weren't always part of it.\n\nDavies, Hector and Lee added 12, 13 and 12 league goals each, though Bruce Rioch's 15 from midfield would ultimately prove crucial.\n\nDavies, signed from non-league football a few years previously, netted all five in a win over Luton Town on March 29.\n\nBy that time Derby were hitting their best form of the season and were unbeaten in their last nine games, winning six.\n\nA draw at Leicester in their penultimate game put Derby within touching distance of their second title in three years, and once again they weren't playing when they were crowned.\n\nInstead, the annual awards night was taking place when news broke that nearest challengers Ipswich Town had blown their chances and Derby were champions once more.\n\nA 0-0 draw at home to already-relegated Carlisle United on the final day of the season took none of the gloss away from what was another remarkable triumph.\n\nClub legends paraded on the pitch, the trophy was given pride of place on a lap of honour, and another glorious chapter was added to Derby County's history.\n\nHaving been crowned champions again, the Rams splashed out £100,000 on Arsenal striker Charlie George - a bargain in the market.\n\nGeorge made his debut at Wembley in the Charity Shield, which Derby won 2-0 against West Ham United thanks to goals from Roy McFarland and Kevin Hector.\n\nDerby had declined the opportunity to take part in the 1972 game.\n\nGeorge would also go on to score arguably the most memorable hat-trick in the club's history.\n\nAnother European Cup adventure got underway with victory over Slovan Bratislava, then came the ultimate glamour tie - Real Madrid, the true giants of the European game.\n\nAnd Derby were in dreamland with a first leg on October 22 that surpassed all expectations.\n\nGeorge smashed home a wonderful first goal that sent the Baseball Ground crowd wild ten minutes in.\n\nSeven minutes later it was two when George fired in from the penalty spot, before Real pulled one back on 25.\n\nBy half-time the Rams were 3-1 up thanks to David Nish and they received a stroke of good fortune in the second period when Real had a goal ruled out for offside - by the same Russian linesman who had awarded Geoff Hurst's effort off the bar in the 1966 World Cup final.\n\nGeorge netted his second penalty of the night and third of the game with 12 minutes left to make it 4-1 to Derby.\n\nThe return leg at the Bernabeu would always be tough but, sadly for Derby, Real turned on the style that had earmarked them as one of the great pioneers of the game.\n\nThey raced into a three-goal lead to level the tie by 55 minutes, but by 62 the Rams were back in it through Charlie George to lead on aggregate.\n\nDerby were five minutes away from going through but a late Real goal forced the tie into extra-time, where Mackay's men had given their all but were beaten by another strike to go down 5-1 on the night and 6-5 on aggregate.\n\nIt had been a marathon encounter and one that showcased all that was good about the game.\n\nDomestically, Derby were threatening to not only retain their title but add a first-ever Double in the club's history.\n\nBut when Charlie George dislocated a shoulder in March, having already scored 24 goals in all competitions, their hopes took a big blow.\n\nManchester United saw them off in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough, 2-0, and Mackay's Rams won just two of their last six games.\n\nStill, finishing fourth was another fine achievement for the club from a provincial town in the East Midlands - Derby didn't even become a city until 1977.\n\nThe Rams were back in Europe, this time in the UEFA Cup, and broke their all-time record victory with a 12-0 thrashing of Irish minnows Finn Harps - Kevin Hector with five, Charlie George and Leighton James with hat-tricks, Bruce Rioch completing the scoring.\n\nAs had happened to Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, Dave Mackay and Des Anderson lasted just 18 months after winning the title before departing the club.\n\nReserve-team coach Colin Murphy took over temporarily and was given the job permanently in February 1977 after an unsuccessful attempt to lure back Clough and Taylor, who were now at Nottingham Forest.\n\nRon Webster broke the all-time appearances record with his 526th outing in April, but Derby dropped down to 15th in the table by the end of the season.\n\nMurphy lasted until September 1977 before being replaced by Tommy Docherty, who quickly began to usher in a new era as the title-winning team began to break up through Docherty's extensive transfer dealings.\n\nDocherty guided Derby to 12th in his first season but his much-changed team narrowly avoided relegation in 78/79 by finishing fourth from bottom, and Addison took over the reins for 79/80.\n\nBut after such a glorious decade, Derby ended it on a low note by finishing second from bottom and dropping out of Division One.\n\nTwice champions, European Cup semi-finalists, that great night against Real Madrid - now the Rams were facing a return to the second tier.\n\n1980 - 1990\n\nDerby didn't threaten a return to the top-flight in the early years of the 1980s, instead they all too often looked like they would drop down again and end up in Division Three.\n\nJohn Newman took over from Colin Addison in January 1982 and with the help of former favourites Charlie George and Kevin Hector, both now back at the club, secured Derby's status for another season.\n\nHector scored his 201st and final goal in his 589th and final game for the club on the last day of the season, a fitting way to bring a great career to an end.\n\nNobody has played more games for Derby than the man known as the King, and only Steve Bloomer has scored more goals.\n\nPeter Taylor returned to the Baseball Ground - minus Brian Clough - with Derby in trouble in November 1982 as attendances dropped and results were getting worse.\n\nTheir second win of the season didn't come until December, but a long unbeaten run from the end of January to the end of April secured their safety.\n\nThe 1983/84 season saw an altogether different problem surface.\n\nThe threat of relegation continued to hang over the Baseball Ground but the threat of extinction was growing by the week due to the club's financial difficulties.\n\nIn April the club went to the High Court and after much work behind the scenes, Derby were saved and the winding-up petitions lifted.\n\nBut on the field, there was no way back. The Rams ultimately finished third from bottom, five points adrift of safety, and nine years after winning the league they were in the third tier of the English game.\n\nNine years after winning the FA Cup, in 1946, the same fate had fallen upon the club.\n\nRoy McFarland, a legend as a player, had taken over for the last nine games of the season but by then the situation was helpless.\n\nMcFarland remained at the club as assistant to new manager Arthur Cox ahead of the 84/85 season, Derby's centenary year, as the club looked to rebuild.\n\nCox steered Derby to seventh in Division Three, and with the opportunity to add more quality to his squad for 1985/86 he did the trick.\n\nThe Rams finished third but there were no play-offs in those days so it was enough to earn them automatic promotion back to the second tier.\n\nThat season they took on the likes of Newport County, York City, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic - how times can change in 20 years.\n\nAnd after taking Derby up once, Cox repeated the feat the following year as the Rams returned to the top-flight.\n\nBobby Davison, having contributed 17 goals to the first promotion campaign, added a further 19 this time around and with valuable contributions from Phil Gee (15) and John Gregory (12), Derby romped to the title.\n\nThey were promoted in their 40th game of 42 by beating Leeds United at the Baseball Ground, and clinched top spot on the final day with victory over Plymouth Argyle to go up with a six-point cushion over their nearest challengers.\n\nRobert Maxwell, who had helped rescue the club in 1984, took over as chairman, and the Rams began to splash the cash.\n\nEngland internationals Peter Shilton and Mark Wright arrived - Wright for a record-smashing fee - and quickly became two of the finest players to pull on a Derby County shirt.\n\nGoals were hard to come by in that first season back up, though the Rams finished a comfortable 15th despite suffering a record-equalling eight straight defeats midway through the campaign.\n\nTo remedy that, the Rams broke the million-pound barrier for the first time with the signing of Welsh international striker Dean Saunders in October 1988.\n\nSaunders added five goals in his first four games to quickly become a hit with the Baseball Ground faithful, and he ended his debut season with 14 in 30.\n\nDerby finished fifth in the table, helped by memorable wins away to Manchester United and eventual champions Arsenal, but were once again denied European football due to the ban on English clubs imposed following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.\n\nThe Rams needed to build on that but investment wasn't forthcoming and when Paul Goddard - the perfect foil for Saunders - was sold to Millwall in December 1989, it was a clear indication that Maxwell was cutting back.\n\nThey flirted with relegation before eventually finishing 16th, though they did enjoy a double over Manchester United.\n\nShilton and Wright starred in England's run to the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup as Shilton also became the world's most-capped international player during the tournament.\n\nThe turn of the decade was, once again, ushering in a turn in the club's fortunes.\n\n1990 to 2000\n\nDerby began the new decade in decline and turmoil. Chairman Robert Maxwell had introduced a freeze on transfers and the Rams were only able to bolster their ranks with a couple of loan signings during 1990/91.\n\nThat had a disastrous effect on the team's form, and Arthur Cox's men suffered a club record 20-game winless run.\n\nBy the time they picked up three points on May 4, having not done so since December 1, they were, not surprisingly, already relegated.\n\nMaxwell departed, paid off by the sales of Dean Saunders and Mark Wright to Liverpool for a combined fee of over £5m, and a new board of directors took over at the helm.\n\nMoney was scarce until the November 1991 arrival of Lionel Pickering, a local multi-millionaire, who would ultimately oversee some dramatic changes at the club.\n\nOn the field the Rams were looking for an immediate return to the top-flight, which would become the Premiership in 1992/93, and they came desperately close.\n\nThe season reached its final day and Derby needed to beat Swindon Town at home, and hope Middlesbrough slipped up, so they could sneak into second.\n\nFor a while things were going their way but while Derby did their part, Boro recovered and left the Rams in the play-offs.\n\nThere they lost to Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final, and despite some considerable spending - including doubling the transfer record to £2.65m on Craig Short - the Rams never threatened a tilt at promotion in 1992/93.\n\nHowever, they did return to Wembley for the first time since 1975, in the final of the Anglo-Italian Cup.\n\nThe competition was for teams in the second tiers of their national leagues, and Derby faced up against Serie B side Cremonese in March 1993.\n\nThey fell behind early, Martin Taylor saved a penalty, Marco Gabbiadini equalised, and at half-time the 37,000-plus Rams fans were hoping for victory.\n\nIt wasn't to be however as the Italians netted twice more after the break, but for many Derby followers it was the first chance to see their side play at the famous stadium.\n\nThey were back at Wembley again the following season, but this time the prize was far greater.\n\nArthur Cox had resigned in the early part of the campaign and his long-time assistant Roy McFarland, a legend as a player, was handed the top job.\n\nMcFarland guided the Rams to sixth in what was now Division One, earning them a play-off place, and after semi-final victory over Millwall only Leicester City stood between Derby and the Premiership.\n\nIt all looked so good when Tommy Johnson opened the scoring in front of over 73,000 fans on a baking hot May day, but Steve Walsh equalised for the Foxes just before half-time.\n\nThe second half was a tense affair but late in the game, Walsh won it for Leicester.\n\nDefeat was cruel on Derby, while for Leicester it was success at the third attempt having lost in the previous two finals.\n\nThe play-off hangover was all too apparent as 1994/95 got underway and while Derby had their good runs during the season, they were never really up with the pace of the promotion challengers.\n\nKey players departed during the season and by the end, another era in the club's history had closed when McFarland's contract wasn't renewed.\n\nThe Rams had finished ninth, and it was time for major change in the summer of 1995.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation about who would take over, in flew the Bald Eagle - the experienced Jim Smith was appointed boss, and one of his first moves was to bring in ex-Rams midfielder Steve McClaren as his assistant.\n\nMany of Cox's big-money signings left, though Smith was wily enough to often complete player-plus-cash deals to bolster his squad.\n\nBut by October, there was the feeling that something was missing - a spark, an inspiration, that extra influence.\n\nIn came Croatian sweeper Igor Stimac for £1.57m, the second-highest fee in the club's history, and that despite competition from across the continent.\n\nHis debut gave no clues as to what would follow - a 5-1 defeat at Tranmere Rovers on November 4.\n\nTwenty games later, on March 9, the Rams had embarked on an unbeaten run that had taken them to the top of the table.\n\nDefeat at Sunderland ended that run, a record inside one season, and Sunderland went on to claim the title.\n\nDuring the run it was also announced that the club would be leaving the Baseball Ground, its home for over a century, and moving to a new purpose-built facility on an up-and-coming city industrial unit called Pride Park.\n\nNerves began to set in and it was all down to the penultimate game of the season.\n\nDerby County v Crystal Palace, second v third, and a win would be enough to send Smith's side up.\n\nDean Sturridge opened the scoring early on, Kenny Brown levelled for Palace almost immediately, and there couldn't have been many tenser occasions in the Baseball Ground's history.\n\nDerby were back in front midway through the second half through a powerful header by Robbie van der Laan, the inspirational central midfielder signed by Smith and immediately installed as captain in the summer of 95.\n\nDerby were heading to the Premiership - and with a new ground just over a year away, another exciting chapter in the club's history was getting going.\n\nConsolidation in the first season in the Premiership and the last at the Baseball Ground was the aim, and with the aid of some astute signings, Derby managed it comfortably.\n\nRepublic of Ireland legend Paul McGrath arrived at the age of 36, barely trained during the week yet was a true rock come the weekend.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, 20-year-old Costa Rican striker Paulo Wanchope joined in March 97 and made his debut in a memorable 3-2 win at Manchester United, where he scored one of the great Derby County goals of all-time.\n\nArsenal were the last-ever league visitors to the Baseball Ground and somewhat spoiled the party by going away with a 3-1 win, but no matter - Derby were already safe, and looking forward to bringing the cream of the crop to their new home.\n\nAshley Ward scored the Rams' last goal at their historic home, and then netted their first at Pride Park - which had been opened in July by Her Majesty The Queen at a ceremonial occasion.\n\nHowever, his record didn't remain in the books for long due to what was literally one of the darkest nights the club had faced.\n\nIn August 1997 Derby led Wimbledon 2-1 when, 11 minutes after half-time, the floodlights failed and proceedings were abandoned - not how they wanted to mark their first league game in the new surroundings.\n\nItalian duo Francesco Baiano and Stefano Eranio arrived that summer, from Fiorentina and AC Milan respectively, and it looked as though the good times were heading back to Derby.\n\nEranio went on to become the first Ram to net at the new home.\n\nThe Rams produced some spectacular football in their first season at Pride Park and went unbeaten there until February 1998.\n\nA challenge for one of the European places was a realistic one until six defeats in the last ten games saw them ultimately finish ninth.\n\nThe 98/99 campaign began solidly enough and six games unbeaten from the start left them second during the early weeks.\n\nInconsistency proved a problem as the Rams were never quite able to match their sparkling form of the previous year, although they did record a memorable 2-1 win away at Liverpool in October 98.\n\nSoon-to-be-relegated Nottingham Forest were beaten at Pride Park in April by a late goal from Argentinian defender Horacio Carbonari, the club's new record signing at £2.7m, and the Rams went on to finish eighth - their highest placing under Smith.\n\nRepresentative football came to Pride Park for the first time in February 1999 when England U21 took on their French counterparts in front of 32,865 fans.\n\nThe disastrous August 99 signing of Argentinian striker Esteban Fuertes didn't help matters as he was refused re-entry to the country following a training break abroad after irregularities were found with his passport, just ten games into his Rams career.\n\nOnly four wins in the first half of the season left Derby struggling near the bottom of the table so big bucks were spent.\n\nSeth Johnson and Lee Morris had already arrived for £3m and £2m respectively, then Branko Strupar and Craig Burley both came in for £3m - along with the loan signing of Giorgi Kinkladze.\n\nBelgian striker Strupar bagged the first goal of the new Millennium in English football, and looked a class player when fit.\n\nDerby hung on to their Premiership lives and survived by five points, having only secured their safety on the penultimate day of the season.\n\nSome good young players were starting to emerge, but it had been another difficult decade in the life of Derby County.\n\n2000 to 2010\n\nDerby began the 2000/01 season by scoring goals for fun but they were also conceding at an alarming rate and found themselves in big trouble early on, particularly once the scoring dried up.\n\nNovember 18 arrived and they were still without a win after 13 Premiership games, but they finally got off the mark by beating Bradford City 2-0.\n\nTo say they never looked back would be generous, as the spectre of relegation was always hanging over their shoulder, but Derby's form did pick up from that point.\n\nAnother astute signing by Jim Smith, Nigerian centre-half Taribo West, helped add experience and quality to the defensive ranks and his presence played a crucial role in developing Derby-born teenager Chris Riggott alongside him.\n\nRiggott went on to claim the player of the year award in his first season but it wasn't until the penultimate game that safety was assured.\n\nThe task that day was immense - Manchester United at Old Trafford, already crowned as runaway Premiership champions.\n\nBut Malcolm Christie's superb first-half goal was enough to give the Rams all three points, and keep them in the top-flight for another season.\n\nThe prestige of full international football came Pride Park's way in May 2001 when England took on Mexico in front of a then-stadium record crowd as a star-studded Three Lions side a 4-0 win.\n\nItalian superstar Fabrizio Ravanelli arrived from Serie A giants Lazio in the summer of 2001 and scored on his debut, an opening-day win against Blackburn Rovers, but by the time another win arrived in November a lot had changed.\n\nJim Smith, so inspirational in winning promotion at the first attempt and the man behind a great few years, had moved on after declining a role as director of football.\n\nIn his place was Colin Todd, a legend as a player from the 70s, who had already been in place as Smith's assistant.\n\nBut Todd's Derby won only four games and he too was soon gone, sacked in January after a bad run of results that also included the indignity of a 3-1 home defeat by Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup.\n\nTodd's replacement was another former club hero, John Gregory, who had played a starring midfield role in the 1980s revival.\n\nGregory oversaw three wins and a draw from his opening six games, raising hope of survival, but after winning 3-1 at Bolton Wanderers on March 16 it went wrong.\n\nThat proved to be the Rams' last top-flight win and seven successive defeats later they were relegated, though their fate had been on the cards for a while.\n\nAn eighth defeat followed, though they did at least ensure they didn't go out of the Premiership on a losing note thanks to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland on the final day - Marvin Robinson with their last top-flight goal.\n\nHopes of an immediate return the following season were raised on the opening day by a 3-0 thrashing of Reading in front of an almost-capacity crowd, but it was one of many false dawns.\n\nMost of the big-money signings of recent years stayed at the club, including Ravanelli, but Premiership outgoings on a Football League incoming were always going to be impossible to sustain.\n\nMany of the high earners were moved elsewhere during January - the first such transfer window for clubs - and with very little freedom in the market Gregory was forced to rely on some promising youngsters.\n\nOne of those was Lee Holmes, who became the club's then youngest-ever player on Boxing Day at the age of 15 years and 268 days.\n\nAnother 15-year-old, midfielder Tom Huddlestone, had already been among the substitutes for league games but was not used.\n\nBut throwing in the kids to a difficult situation is never preferable, and a run of nine games without a win - seven defeats - from February into March saw Derby in danger of another relegation.\n\nGregory was suspended in March over allegations of \"serious misconduct\", plunging the club into even more turmoil with off-field financial difficulties starting to bite.\n\nIn came George Burley as interim manager with a simple brief of keeping Derby in the division during the final seven games.\n\nThree wins were enough to achieve that aim, and they were enough to get Burley the job on a permanent basis when Gregory was sacked in the summer.\n\nThe 2003/04 season opened up in desperate style, a 3-0 home defeat to Stoke City, and by the end of October only three wins were on the board.\n\n'The board' also turned into a key phrase during October as the Rams were taken over by a three-man consortium of businessmen in a surprise deal.\n\nThe club went into temporary receivership, allowing the deal to take place, but the financial problems were worsening and fans were becoming concerned about what the future held.\n\nLoan players came and went, with only Everton midfielder Leon Osman a real success, though some smart late-season signings of experienced players helped the cause.\n\nOne of those men, striker Paul Peschisolido, made an immediate impact and scored twice in a famous 4-2 win over local rivals Nottingham Forest - thanks to the legendary coffee cup incident.\n\nForest keeper Barry Roche lined up a feet-only clearance after a back-pass but the ball bounced up off a rogue coffee cup sat on the pitch in front of him, Roche's clearance looped up into the air and Pesch gleefully tapped it in to an empty net.\n\nSafety was finally secured on the penultimate day of the season though the Rams ended up just a solitary point above the relegation zone.\n\nOne positive was the emergence of Huddlestone, who appeared in all but three of the season's games - despite not turning 17 until late December 2003.\n\nIn stark contrast, 2004/05 proved to be a memorable campaign for all of the right reasons - and it almost had a dream ending.\n\nGeorge Burley raided the continental market to bring in Spanish midfielder Inigo Idiakez and Danish midfielder Morten Bisgaard, and domestically he snapped up former England U21 striker Tommy Smith and experienced Coventry centre-half Mo Konjic.\n\nKonjic's season was disrupted by injury but the other three proved inspired captures, as did Polish international striker Grzegorz Rasiak upon his September arrival.\n\nRasiak went on to score 17 goals in all competitions and Idiakez showed all of his class from 300 games in La Liga as the Rams equalled their club record 12 away league wins.\n\nAlong the way they secured a memorable Boxing Day success at Wigan Athletic, who went on to win promotion to the Premiership, along with a 3-0 Pride Park destruction of Nottingham Forest - who went on to be relegated to League 1.\n\nThat helped them to fourth in the newly-formed Coca-Cola Championship, and a place in the play-offs, where they came up against Preston North End.\n\nBut without Rasiak and Idiakez for the first leg they went down 2-0 at Deepdale, and although the pair returned - but were clearly not fit - for the return, Derby were up against it.\n\nRasiak missed a late penalty in a heartbreaking 0-0 draw that saw Preston go through to Cardiff, where they lost to West Ham, while the Rams' dreams were shattered in cruel fashion.\n\nThat was Burley's last game in charge as he left soon afterwards, so once again Derby County were at a time of change despite having enjoyed a successful season.\n\nIt was a season that also saw the passing of the club's most legendary boss of all-time, Brian Clough.\n\nThe man who guided Derby to their first league championship in 1972 sadly passed away after illness in September 2004, which sparked emotional scenes as tributes were left in abundance at Pride Park.\n\nThe stadium also hosted Clough's memorial service which was attended by thousands of fans, and friends and family of the great man.\n\nGone but never forgotten - and the A52, which links Derby and Nottingham, has since been renamed Brian Clough Way in his honour.\n\nOn the field but not football-related was the stadium's first concert in July 2005 when the legendary Rod Stewart performed to thousands of delighted fans.\n\nNext into the hot-seat after a summer of speculation was former Bolton Wanderers assistant boss Phil Brown, but after a promising start things quickly turned sour.\n\nAn abysmal away record coupled with home form that wasn't much better, along with some less than successful loan signings, meant Brown's Derby were soon in trouble.\n\nThey were drawing too many games for comfort, but following two humiliating defeats - 6-1 at Coventry City and 3-1 at League 1 side Colchester United in the FA Cup - Brown's time was up, just seven months after taking over.\n\nThe board turned to Academy manager Terry Westley, who had helped nurture the club's young stars of recent years.\n\nTeenage defender Lewin Nyatanga had already made his senior breakthrough earlier on in the season and was about to become a record-breaking Welsh international, while one of Westley's first decisions was to throw in 17-year-old Giles Barnes for a full debut in his first game in charge.\n\nBarnes's emergence was a key factor in the club managing to stay just above the relegation zone, though fears of the drop hung over Pride Park until safety was secured with three games left.\n\nBy that time director of football Murdo Mackay had left, as had chairman John Sleightholme, and the club was in the midst of a takeover battle.\n\nThe battle was eventually won by a consortium of local businessmen, all Derby County fans, who completed the deal in time to be welcomed by the crowd before the final day of the season.\n\nTheir arrival ushered yet another new era in, but their immediate impact was felt more off the field as the club's financial status - which had been worsening by the month - was secured, and Pride Park Stadium returned to local ownership.\n\nThe managerial position was once again up for grabs and this time the club managed to secure the services of Preston North End's Billy Davies, who had been a target of the previous administration 12 months back.\n\nDavies - who had guided Preston to two successive play-offs and was in charge when they beat the Rams in 2005 - set about his rebuilding task.\n\nHe began to re-shape the squad, bringing in his own players, and made an impressive start.\n\nBy December he had guided the Rams to second in the Championship, their highest position since falling out of the Premiership in 2002, and six wins from six in November earned him the manager of the month award.\n\nDavies also oversaw the club's first win at Leeds United since November 1974, which went down particularly well with the fans, and by the halfway point of the season they were still sitting in the top two.\n\nIt got even better after Christmas for the Rams as they hit the top of the table on the back of a run of eight successive victories in all competitions, including six in the league for the second time during the season.\n\nDavies was rewarded as January's manager of the month as he continued to keep the Rams right in the hunt for promotion as the season went on.\n\nIndeed, at the start of February, following a 1-0 win at Southampton they opened up a six-point advantage at the top of the Championship.\n\nBirmingham City were hot on Derby's tails and with Sunderland getting up a head of steam while on a remarkable run, the heat was on.\n\nDefeats away to both in the space of a fortnight at the end of February and the start of March meant that Derby sat second with nine games to go.\n\nA run of five games without defeat after the Birmingham reverse kept the Rams back in the hunt though they would ultimately rue four dropped points over Easter thanks to draws with Leicester and Coventry.\n\nSunderland and Birmingham took advantage of games in hand to move ahead at the top and when they both won over the final weekend of April, Davies's side knew they had to pick up three points of their own at Crystal Palace to keep the automatic promotion race alive.\n\nThey went down 2-0 in the Sunday afternoon kick-off, sending the top two up to the Premiership, but that was the beginning of the story.\n\nDerby were already guaranteed third place in the Championship by the time they beat Leeds United 2-0 at Pride Park on the final day of the season, and results elsewhere meant they would face Southampton in the play-off semi-final.\n\nSteve Howard was the catalyst for victory in the first leg at the St Mary's Stadium.\n\nThe big number nine, Derby's newly-crowned Player of the Year, netted with a superb header and a composed penalty to turn things around after the Saints took an early lead.\n\nDerby had the advantage going into the second leg, at Pride Park, and when Darren Moore scored after just 102 seconds it looked as though they were well on their way to Wembley.\n\nBut Southampton had other ideas. Jhon Viafara equalised almost immediately, and he levelled the aggregate score early in the second half.\n\nLeon Best's own-goal swung the tie back Derby's way again and they were 90 seconds from victory when Polish striker Grzegorz Rasiak came back to haunt his old club, making it 3-2 on the night and 4-4 overall.\n\nExtra-time came and went, and penalties were required to separate the two sides.\n\nBest missed the first, and after the Rams scored their first four it was down to ex-Derby ace Inigo Idiakez to keep Southampton in it.\n\nThe Spaniard stepped up and blazed his kick high over the bar, sending Derby to Wembley and sparking off great celebrations.\n\nDubbed the richest game in football, due to a reported £60m for the winners due to increased TV rights and other spin-offs, the Championship play-off final would be between Derby County and West Bromwich Albion for a place in the Premier League.\n\nDerby had beaten West Brom at Pride Park, West Brom had beaten Derby at the Hawthorns, and despite finishing eight points adrift of the Rams it was Tony Mowbray's Baggies who were the favourites.\n\nThey perhaps had the better of the game in front of a near-75,000 crowd, but they reckoned without Derby's grit and resilience that had taken them to the brink of the Premiership.\n\nThe crucial moment came just after the hour when January signing Stephen Pearson broke into the box to slide home the only goal of the game from Giles Barnes's low cross.\n\nIt was the perfect time for the Scotsman to score his first goal in a Derby shirt and crown his return after being sidelined by a foot injury.\n\nDerby held firm and when the final whistle blew, the scenes were like few ever witnessed in the long and distinguished history of the club.\n\nThe celebrations continued over the next few days with as many as 20,000 supporters lining the streets of the city and cramming on to the Pride Park pitch to greet their heroes a day later.\n\nA few months later, Matt Oakley who scored the opening goal of the 2007/08 season, three minutes in at home to Portsmouth.\n\nAnd a Derby-born son of a Rams legend later equalised to earn a point on his debut - Andy Todd, whose father Colin won two championships in the 1970s, dived in to head home and secure a 2-2 draw.\n\nThe first win of the season came in September as new signing Kenny Miller marked his debut with a spectacular strike to see off Newcastle United, but by the end of October it was still the only victory thus far.\n\nBilly Davies left his position following a meeting with Adam Pearson, where it was decided that it was \"mutually in the best interests of both parties\" for Davies to depart.\n\nThe hot-seat wasn't vacant for long however as just two days later, in came former Bradford City, Sheffield Wednesday and Wigan Athletic boss Paul Jewell.\n\nHis first game in charge was a gut-wrenching 1-0 defeat at Sunderland, thanks to a stoppage-time winner for the hosts, and two months into his tenure Jewell hadn't tasted a Premier League victory.\n\nThat two-month mark was recognised with another change at the top - and it was possibly the most dramatic in the club's history.\n\nIn came United States-based General Sports and Entertainment as the club's new owners after agreeing an investment partnership.\n\nBut a miraculous escape couldn't be pulled off and the Rams' relegation was finally confirmed on March 29, following a 2-2 draw at home to Fulham coupled with Birmingham City's 3-1 win over Manchester City.\n\nDerby's start to the new 2008/09 season was a difficult one and it took them until the middle of September, and the visit of Sheffield United, for them to record their first victory of the campaign.\n\nThat was the cue for Jewell's side to go on an impressive autumn run and lift themselves comfortably into mid-table, while also reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup for the first time since 1968.\n\nBut the league form soon deserted Derby again and following the 1-0 defeat at home to Ipswich Town, Jewell resigned as boss.\n\nIn came Nigel Clough, fresh from a ten-year spell with Burton Albion that had seen the Brewers improve their position year-on-year and he left them sitting 13 points clear at the top of Blue Square Premier and in a strong position to claim a place in the Football League for the first time.\n\nHe watched from the Pride Park stands as his new charges earned themselves a 1-0 lead against Manchester United in the first leg of their Carling Cup semi-final, though they ultimately went down 4-2 at Old Trafford and 4-3 overall.\n\nHowever he did quickly oversee a pair of memorable victories away to Nottingham Forest - the Rams' first since the 1971/72 season under his late father.\n\nThe 2009/10 season saw the Rams finish the campaign in 14th spot, a very respectable finish considering a number of injuries and a transitional year with the squad under Clough in his first full campaign in the hotseat."
