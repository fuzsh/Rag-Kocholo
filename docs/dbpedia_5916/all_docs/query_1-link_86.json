        "text": "How does it really really work?\n\nWho knows? There’s nothing legally binding about the Spitzenkandidat process, and many national governments are no fans of it, feeling it robs them of their say. That could put the two institutions on a collision course. The Council has said it will not be bound by the process. The Parliament has insisted it will reject any candidate not chosen through the Spitzenkandidat system.\n\nWhat makes a good candidate?\n\n“Multilingualism provides a clear advantage, and knowledge of the three working languages of the EU institutions can be considered quasi prerequisites,” according to the Commission’s inhouse think tank, the European Political Strategy Centre. A Commission president need not be a former leader of a country, but “executive experience is necessary given the scope of the tasks at hand. And finally, the credibility and effectiveness of the candidate will be bolstered if they are considered by the European Council as ‘one of their peers.’”\n\nSo, who’s it going to be?\n\nIf the Spitzenkandidat process is followed to the letter, the candidate of the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) is almost certain to take the top job. But given the next Commission president will be chosen by a new Parliament with a new balance of power, anything is possible. French President Emmanuel Macron is another wild card. He has not yet aligned his La République En Marche party with an existing European political party and could emerge as kingmaker, in particular if the EPP and Socialists fail to win 50 percent of MEP seats. (They currently hold 53 percent.)\n\nAnd the candidates are?\n\nGlad you asked. There are no formal candidates at this stage (parties will start selecting their candidates at congresses in the fall), but POLITICO has compiled the following list of the most viable contenders\n\n* * *\n\nMichel Barnier\n\nWho? A French politician who’s done everything except lead France. Currently the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Barnier has at different times served as France’s foreign, Europe, environment and agriculture minister. He’s put on the Winter Olympics, been a two-time European commissioner and narrowly lost the EPP nomination for European Commission president to Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014.\n\nPros: Has served as Ireland’s head of government, leading the country through financial crises. Having retired from national government, Kenny (like Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014) would be free to campaign full-time. Ireland has not held a top European political office since Pat Cox led the Parliament from 2002 to 2004.\n\nCons: Like Barnier, represents an older generation, in marked contrast to the leader of his country.\n\nAge at time of European election: 68\n\nWill he run? Kenny has kept his cards close to his chest.\n\nChances of EPP nomination: Slim\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: High\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nJyrki Katainen\n\nWho? An alumnus of the EU’s Erasmus exchange program (he studied in Leicester, U.K.), Katainen is one of two canny former Finnish prime ministers in the running. Unusually for a European commissioner, Katainen doggedly pursued just a few flagship projects, most notably the European Fund for Strategic Investment (which he pushed through Parliament and national governments in record time in 2015), proving his ability to wade through the red tape of Brussels.\n\nAge at time of European election: 47\n\nPros: The youngest viable candidate, a former prime minister, effective current European commissioner, and from a Nordic eurozone country (none of which have held the Commission presidency).\n\nCons: Viewed as reserved, which may be problematic when compared to Finland’s other viable EPP candidate, the charismatic Alexander Stubb. Does not speak German.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill he run? Katainen has promised to make his decision by summer.\n\nChances of EPP nomination: Moderate\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: High\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nAlexander Stubb\n\nWho? A former Finnish prime minister, he replaced Jyrki Katainen. Now vice president at the European Investment Bank, Stubb is known for playing against type: An outgoing, sporty, glamorous Finn who seems more at home among a cosmopolitan crowd than among his quiet compatriots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge at time of European election: 51\n\nPros: From a eurozone Nordic country, speaks five languages, and has worked for four EU institutions, including as an MEP.\n\nCons: He’s not the only qualified Finn. POLITICO’s Finnish sources suggest Stubb will not try to elbow past Katainen — his compatriot, party colleague, and fellow marathon sports enthusiast.\n\nWill he run? “If someone was asking if I’ll go back to national politics, the answer is no. But European politics is always an appealing affair to me,” he told POLITICO’s EU Confidential podcast in February.\n\nChances of EPP nomination: Moderate\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: High\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\nWho? A highly-regarded serving German defense minister, von der Leyen looks like a dream candidate on paper.\n\nAge at time of European election: 60\n\nPros: From a big country (Germany), the biggest party (EPP), is the face of an important new EU initiative (the so-called PESCO common defense policy), speaks English, French and German fluently, was born and raised in Brussels, would be the first female Commission president.\n\nCons: Has not been a national leader or held another high-level European post, and other national governments will be suspicious of having both a German Commission president and a German Commission secretary-general (Martin Selmayr).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill she run? Von der Leyen may not want to stand down from frontline national politics and give up her shot at replacing Angela Merkel as chancellor of Germany. On the other hand, she is not Merkel’s preferred successor, and Merkel may find having her in Brussels is a useful way to keep her hands off the domestic crown.\n\nChances of EPP nomination: Slim\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: High\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nDalia Grybauskaitė\n\nWho? President of Lithuania and a former commissioner, Grybauskaitė has gone from Soviet-era Communist Party member to steely center-right leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge at time of European election: 63\n\nPros: Would be the first Baltic, post-Soviet and female Commission president. A highly-regarded member of the European Council.\n\nCons: Is required by the Lithuanian constitution to not be a member of a political party, seemingly preventing her from running for the EPP nomination. Would need to be put forward as a compromise candidate after the election in order to secure the post.\n\nChances of EPP nomination: None, due to internal EPP rules.\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: N/A\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nFederica Mogherini\n\nWho? The EU’s chief diplomat, Mogherini could be the youngest candidate from a major party if proposed by the Party of European Socialists. Like Katainen, Mogherini was young enough to have enjoyed the EU’s Erasmus student exchange program.\n\nAge at time of European election: 45\n\nPros: Already holds one of the EU’s four highest offices, from a large founding EU country (Italy).\n\nCons: Socialists are unlikely to win the European election, and as chief diplomat, Mogherini would either need to step down to run or would be severely limited in her campaigning.\n\nWill she run? There are few viable or visible Socialist contenders. Of the current Socialist European commissioners, Frans Timmermans’ star has waned, Maroš Šefčovič’s star has only ever flickered, and Pierre Moscovici is from the wrong French party to win his government’s support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChances of Socialist nomination: Moderate\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: Slim\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nChristine Lagarde\n\nWho? A French lawyer by training, Lagarde was brought into the French government in 2005 as a nonpartisan expert outsider to serve as minister for trade. She went on to become a highly-regarded finance minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy and managing director of the International Monetary Fund since 2011. She is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most powerful women.\n\nAge at time of European election: 63\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPros: The ultimate globalist insider, adept at achieving consensus in difficult situations.\n\nCons: The ultimate globalist insider, found guilty of negligence in her handling of a government payout to a businessman while finance minister. Lagarde is not a member of the EPP and would be better suited as Mario Draghi’s replacement at the European Central Bank.\n\nWill she run? No. Lagarde has a full-time global role and is not a member of any of the parties. Her best shot at the job is as a post-election compromise candidate.\n\nChances of nomination: None\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: N/A\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nGuy Verhofstadt\n\nWho? A former Belgian prime minister, he was a candidate for the Commission presidency in 2004, until he was vetoed by Britain’s Tony Blair. Verhofstadt leads the liberal ALDE group in the European Parliament and serves as the institution’s Brexit coordinator.\n\nAge at time of European election: 66\n\nPros: Speaks all major European languages, has held high office for more than 30 years at both national and EU level.\n\nCons: Verhofstadt’s Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe (ALDE) is only the fourth-biggest party in the European Parliament, and Verhofstadt is a divisive figure even within his own party.\n\nWill he run? Verhofstadt is both ALDE’s greatest strength and weakness. If Macron does not form an alliance with ALDE before the election, his chances of running are high. If the French president weighs in with a preferred candidate or offers Verhofstadt another prize in exchange for dropping out, he may stay out of the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChances of ALDE nomination: High\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: None\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\n* * *\n\nMargrethe Vestager\n\nWho? The most globally visible European commissioner (for competition policy), Vestager has graced a thousand power lists thanks to her bold use of her portfolio’s executive powers. She comes from a small Danish left-leaning liberal party and is admired, feared and loathed in equal measure.\n\nAge at time of European election: 51\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPros: Charismatic, accomplished, stylish and down-to-earth. Vestager is the sort of excellent communicator that campaign managers dream of, and speechwriters fear writing for. Having Emmanuel Macron as a fan doesn’t hurt.\n\nCons: Not supported by her own government, not from a eurozone country, and stuck in a party — the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe (ALDE) that holds less than 70 of the European Parliament’s 751 seats.\n\nWill she run? Vestager is too smart to reveal her plans at this point. Her best chance is as a post-election compromise candidate.\n\nChances of ALDE or En Marche nomination: High\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament election: None\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: High\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nMatteo Renzi\n\nWho? After a dizzying spell as a social democrat prime minister of Italy, Renzi crashed out of his country’s top job before he turned 43, then led the PD to a terrible result in Italy’s 2018 election.\n\nAge at time of European election: 44\n\nPros: Dynamic centrist who refuses to take no for an answer. The sort of socialist Macron could bring into his tent.\n\nCons: Unfocused hyperactivity rarely leads to success in the EU’s complicated bureaucracy.\n\nWill he run? A wildcard candidate. Few expected Renzi to seize control of Italy as quickly or brutally as he did in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChances of Socialist or En Marche nomination: Slim\n\nChances of party coming first in Parliament elections: Slim\n\nChances of securing European Parliament support: Moderate\n\nAlso On POLITICO"
