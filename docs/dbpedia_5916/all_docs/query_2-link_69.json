        "text": "Our Counseling Program\n\nBeing a Derby Academy student means your authentic self is welcomed and celebrated here. Effective School Counseling Programs are a collaborative effort between school counselor, families, administration, and teachers to create an environment resulting in a positive impact on student growth both academically and social/emotional.\n\nJulie Browne, a National Certified Counselor and Massachusetts Licensed School Counselor and Social-Emotional Learning Coordinator, works school-wide to address any and all challenges impacting student learning. She values and responds to the diversity and individual differences in culturally sensitive and responsive ways. Julie focuses her time and energy on direct and indirect services to students from face-to-face counseling and group lessons, to providing outside referrals and consulting with families. Julie also oversees the Social-Emotional Learning at Derby based on the CASEL framework.\n\nThe Role of The School Counselor\n\nFor those of you I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, I am Julie Browne and I have the distinct privilege of being the Derby School Counselor which encompasses the following:\n\nSocial Emotional Learning (SEL)\n\nI lead this school-wide experience through research-based and Derby created SEL curricula. We cover topics such as inclusivity, growth mindset, worry, confidence, empathy, digital citizenship, and leadership to name a few. We not only discuss such topics, we strive to weave them into our daily language and conversations.\n\nExample of Digital Citizenship Curriculum Utilized\n\nSocial-Emotional Learning CASEL Wheel\n\nSocial-Emotional Learning in Pre-K–Grade 5\n\nAdvisory Social-Emotional Learning in Grades 6–8\n\nCounseling Support\n\nI provide counseling support to individual children and in small groups. If at any time you believe something is impacting your child's school experience, please email me directly at jbrowne@derbyacademy.org.\n\nLearning Support\n\nIf your child has, or is in the process of receiving, a neuropsychological evaluation and is in need of any learning support, I work closely with Zaidee Rose our Director of Student Support, along with with a team of learning specialists, teachers, and the Division Heads to determine how to best support each child.\n\nIn the second week of home-schooling my own children I found the built-in opportunity to help develop Executive Functioning (EF) Skills. We were naturally working on them without even knowing it! EF skills include creating a schedule, goal setting, time management, prioritizing, note-taking, studying etc... You can have your child check-off items on the daily schedule once complete. Without rushing around to get out the door or run to the next scheduled activity here is time in our new situation to ask your child to clean up after each meal, turn off the lights after leaving each room, help with the chores around the house, clean out and organize a closet or room. Ask your child to summarize what they learned or share their notes with you. You can also play problem solving games (heads up, guess who).\n\nFor MS and US learners, please click here for Time Management Tips for On-line Learning"
