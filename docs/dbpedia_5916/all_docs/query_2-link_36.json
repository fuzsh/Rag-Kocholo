This training enables Scout units to extend their camping season to a full 12-months. These unique skills are delivered in a safe environment and culminates in a 24-hour outdoor overnight session that tests your new-found skills while enjoying some Scout fellowship and competition. This is NOT a survival skills session – it is an opportunity to learn about how winter camping can be fun and exciting, and still be enjoyable! Program is delivered in a troop setting, where each participant is assigned to a unique cold weather patrol. There are three troop meetings that are mandatory for graduation. The fourth final meeting is our outdoor overnight adventure!\n\nAll troop meetings are held at the Beaumont Scout Reservation.\n\nProgram areas include: first aid, cooking, nutrition, travel planning, shelters, clothing systems, sleeping systems, mental aspects of winter camping, nature, games, and FUN!\n\nYouth Participant Requirements\n\nYouth must be 14 years old and at least First Class as of December 9, 2018, have long-term camping experience, and have their Scoutmaster’s and Parental/Guardian approvals.

Every time you complete a training session, print out the certificate provided and turn in to your Unit Leader, Committee Chairman or council service center.\n\nYouth Protection Training\n\nYouth protection training is mandatory for ALL registered adults and must be taken prior to any other training courses. It is available online and must be re-taken every two years. Youth safety is the No. 1 concern of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).\n\nIntroduction to Leadership Skills for Troops\n\nThe purpose of the Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops course is to teach Scouts with leadership positions about their new roles and how to most effectively reach success in that role. It is intended to help Boy Scouts in leadership positions within their troop understand their responsibilities and to equip them with organizational and leadership skills to fulfill those responsibilities. Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops is the first course in the series of leadership training offered to Boy Scouts and is a replacement for Troop Leadership Training. Completion of Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops is a prerequisite for Boy Scouts to participate in the more advanced leadership courses National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) and the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience (NAYLE). It is also required to participate in a Kodiak Challenge Trek.\n\nThis course is designed to be presented within the Boy Scout Troop. Materials for presenting this course to your troop may be found at Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troop Manual – the scout shop does not carry a printed copy of this manual, they do offer a packet of cards to supplement the course that can be given to the boys as a commitment card and to remind them of what their responsibilities are in their role.\n\nThe River Trails Eagle Board meets every last Thursday of the month.
