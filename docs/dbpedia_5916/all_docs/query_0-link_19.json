        "text": "Three reasons why you might want to consider a fractional COO. Depending on the scale of your organization, certain leadership positions may be beyond your reach. That's where fractional leadership can play a role. In the blog linked here I explore a few reasons why you might consider that option. I have leveraged this approach as a firm leader in the past and am currently serving in a fractional leadership capacity today. What is less clear to me, is how to match people with the skills and experience to the firms that need them. I am a big fan of, and often make referrals but I'm not sure that's the only solution. If you have experience, insight or just thoughts on how to best make these connections, please share your thoughts in the comments.\n\nDear Executives, Sharing is Caring! Share your expertise! Now!

The job of the chief staff executive (CSE) can be demanding under any circumstances. Navigating the uncharted waters as you take on the role for the first time in your career will be exhilarating and yet can also be particularly hard. Maybe you‚Äôre following in the footsteps of a long-term and beloved leader, or perhaps being brought in during times of crisis or downturn to ‚Äúclean house‚Äù and turn things around? Maybe you're the pioneer, serving as an organization‚Äôs first paid chief staff executive as it transitions from being founder-led to founder-inspired? This panel of successful chief staff executives will share priceless lessons learned that are perfect for anyone newly appointed or aspiring to the top spot. Let's unpack the professional and personal challenges, rewards, and surprises they encountered‚Äîincluding some that are not often discussed. Find out what they wished they‚Äôd known before taking on their roles, what surprised them, and what sustains them in their work. #leadership #representationmatters #ceo #assnchat #asae\n\nBeing a Non-Executive Director is different from being an Executive Director and some first-time Directors take longer than others to make the switch between executive and non-executive ways of thinking and behaving. Most understand at an intellectual level that they will need to approach their Board responsibilities in a different way from their executive role, yet underestimate how difficult this transition is in practice. As a Non-Executive Director you exercise power through influence.\n\nüì£ Calling all PR Professionals!
