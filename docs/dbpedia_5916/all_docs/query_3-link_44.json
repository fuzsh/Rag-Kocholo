        "text": "Teoscar Hernandez is your 2024 MLB All-Star Home Run Derby champion!\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers slugger takes home his first Derby title in his first appearance after outlasting Kansas City Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. in a dramatic final round.\n\nIt was an upset-filled night in Arlington as New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, Baltimore Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson and hometown star Adolis Garcia of the Texas Rangers were eliminated in the first round, paving the way for Hernandez, Witt, Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez to take center stage at Globe Life Field.\n\nWe have your one-stop shop for everything Derby related, from the round-by-round results to our favorite moments from one of the most anticipated events of the summer.\n\n2024 MLB Home Run Derby results\n\nFinal\n\nBobby Witt Jr. (13) vs. Teoscar Hernandez (14)\n\nSemifinals\n\nAlec Bohm (15) vs. Teoscar Hernandez (16)\n\nJose Ramirez (12) vs. Bobby Witt Jr. (17)\n\nFirst round\n\nAlec Bohm: 21 home runs\n\nJose Ramirez: 21 home runs\n\nBobby Witt Jr.: 20 home runs\n\nTeoscar Hernandez: 19 home runs\n\nAdolis Garcia: 18 home runs\n\nMarcell Ozuna: 16 home runs\n\nPete Alonso: 12 home runs\n\nGunnar Henderson: 11 home runs\n\nOur favorite moments from the 2024 Home Run Derby\n\nJesse Rogers: Hernandez was far from the favorite to win the Home Run Derby, but win it he did -- and with plenty of dramatic flair. He almost didn't make it out of the first round, beating hometown star Adolis Garcia by a single home run to advance -- and ruining the night for many Rangers fans in attendance in the process. After sweating that one out, Hernandez had to navigate around the story of the night to that point, Phillies slugger Alec Bohm. The two finished the semifinals tied 14-14 before Hernandez took the swing-off 2-1. One final moment of drama came after his final round, as he watched Bobby Witt Jr. make a charge that came up just short. He has wanted to do this event for years, and he earned this Derby win.\n\nJeff Passan: Another foot, maybe two, and everything would have changed at the Home Run Derby on Monday night. At the very least, Bobby Witt Jr. would have earned himself the opportunity for a swing-off against Teoscar Hernandez in the final. And perhaps he would have just won the whole thing with his next swing. But baseball can be cruel sometimes, and the best story of the night -- the burgeoning star going back home and winning a Derby at his first All-Star Game -- fell just shy. Witt's final swing launched a ball toward center field -- an uncommon place for a Derby hit. Witt's power looked like it would make that irrelevant. But as the crowd stood and the fans cheered and the drama peaked, the ball clanged off the wall, ending Witt's dream and making Hernandez's. Witt will be back any time he wants. But his first will always carry the sting of what could have been.\n\nDavid Schoenfield: Alec Bohm was the big underdog in this contest -- although he had plenty of support from his Phillies All-Star teammates cheering him on. He was the surprise co-leader after the first round, heard saying, \"Just like everyone thought\" on the broadcast. Then in the semifinals, a home run on his final swing would have given him a spot in the finals ... it headed toward the foul pole, a high arching ball ... and curled just foul. He remained tied with Teoscar Hernandez. Then lost the swing-off. So close. It feels like the first thing that has gone wrong this year for the Phillies, who will begin the second half as World Series favorites.\n\nAlden Gonzalez: When it was over, reigning champion Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sauntered down the third-base line -- Derby trophy in hand, customized Hernández jersey on his back -- to meet his good friend and former Toronto Blue Jays teammate. The two of them were showered with water and blue Gatorade. Hernández had become the seventh Dominican-born player to win the Derby, joining Vladimir Guerrero Sr., David Ortiz, Sammy Sosa, Robinson Cano, Miguel Tejada and Juan Soto. After the dust settled, I asked the younger Guerrero if he'd come back to try for a second title next year. \"If Teoscar does it,\" he said, \"I'm in.\"\n\nUpdates and analysis from the Derby"
