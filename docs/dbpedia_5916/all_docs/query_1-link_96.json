        "text": "Let’s find out if it would really be a great fit for us to coach together.\n\nI have five criteria that any client must meet:\n\nThey must be inspiring or have an inspiring mission\n\nThey must make or be ready to make a big impact in the world\n\nThey must be fun\n\nThey must bring along a challenge\n\nThey must understand the power of commitment\n\nCoaching is not for everyone\n\nLet’s be clear: you do not need coaching. In-fact nobody needs coaching. The question is do you want coaching? Personally I believe in coaching so much that I have had my own coach for years but that’s because I love having someone who believes in me. I love having someone hold me accountable to a bigger vision. I love someone who doesn’t believe in the negative stories I tell myself or the fears that hold me back. Not everyone wants that.\n\nHi, I’m Tony Prueitt.\n\nI am a Husband, Father, Business Owner and High Performance Business and Executive Coach that cares about creating better lives for people. I choose to work with clients that share similar values to mine:\n\n✓ I put my family first; business comes second.\n\n✓ Business is about what it delivers for my clients personally and the lives they want to create for them and their families.\n\n✓ Integrity is very important: I strive to do what I say I will do and expect the same from others.\n\n✓ Fun & having a sense of humour is essential.\n\n✓ Congruency: As a business owner, I always try to lead by example, especially when I coach my clients and ask them to do the same.\n\n✓ Embrace new learnings – I always focus on developing myself as a person, coach and business owner through feedback from my clients, education and my own coach.\n\nMy clients explain that working with me is an investment and not a cost. I’ve been described as ‘an unreasonable friend that provides an outside perspective’, a reputation that has created raving fans and helped build my business.\n\n“Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don’t wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don’t wish for less challenge, wish for more wisdom.” Jim Rohn\n\nYour High Performance Business Coach\n\nTony’s passion is to ignite people’s imaginations about what is possible to have, so that they find the motivation to take action and be the best they can be.\n\nTony has helped business owners achieve their goals, and take their business to the next level.
