        "text": "Claire Ward has been elected as the first Mayor of the East Midlands.\n\nThe new Mayor of the East Midlands Combined County Authority said: “I am truly humbled that the people of Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire have elected me to become your very-first East Midlands Mayor.”\n\nThe Mayor will have access to £38 million per year in funding, alongside devolved powers around transport, housing, skills and adult education, Net-Zero and economic development.\n\nCouncillor Baggy Shanker, Leader of Derby City Council said:\n\n“For too long, the East Midlands has been left to lag behind other areas and passed over for funding and other opportunities. The formation of the East Midlands Combined County Authority and the election of Claire as its Mayor will only be a positive for the region.\n\n“The potential that will be unlocked following this historic election will soon begin to deliver a big boost for the area and all of its residents. I’m optimistic for the future of Derby and the wider region. I’m excited to start working with Claire to uplift Derby and the East Midlands.”\n\nSpeaking after her election, Claire Ward said:\n\n“We know we can punch above our weight as a region, but we have been held back. Constantly at the bottom of the table for investment from Government, projects promised then scrapped, we’ve been overlooked and underfunded for too long. That must end now.\n\n“If we are going to change politics and make it work better for people, we will need to work together. As Mayor, I will work across the political divides, uniting those who share an ambition to make this a better place, so we can delivery truly transformational change for our region.\n\n“So let me set out that my commitment from day one is to be the person who stands up for this region, shouts out for this region and demands better for this region.\n\n“Our region has a proud heritage of leading where others follow. From Cromford Mill, to Derby’s Silk Mill, this is the true birthplace of the industrial revolution. Our businesses and creative talent across the region, over decades, have led in manufacturing and innovation.\n\n“Together we will restore that pride and purpose, to make the East Midlands the best place to live, to work and to learn.”\n\nJohn Forkin, managing director of Derby’s investment promotion agency, Marketing Derby, welcomed the news, saying: “We have seen how a Mayor can be pivotal in putting an area on the map and we very much welcome Claire into this new role and really look forward to working with her on attracting inward investment to create opportunity and growth for all.”\n\nEast Midlands Chamber reacted warmly to the appointment. Chief executive, Scott Knowles said “I wish Claire every success as Combined County Authority mayor and at East Midlands Chamber we stand ready to work with Claire in highlighting the key issues facing businesses in the East Midlands.\n\n“While there is plenty of growth potential in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, the skills gap and the need for reform in areas like transport are ever present, as are the prohibitive costs of doing business.”\n\nAlso, on Friday 3 May, Nicolle Ndiweni (Labour and Cooperative Party) was elected as Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner."
