        "text": "As it has done for nearly 70 years, the Kentucky Derby Festival has selected five Derby princesses to reign over the events leading up to the historic 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nOn Monday, the 2024 Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Princesses were announced at an event hosted at Dillard's at Mall St. Matthews. The five members of the 2024 Royal Court will serve as official ambassadors for the Kentucky Derby Festival, the city of Louisville, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and will attend more than 70 springtime festival events.\n\nThe five women were selected from nearly 100 candidates for the 2024 Royal Court Program. The women represent different colleges and universities from around Kentucky and the region. All the applicants went through preliminary judging in November with final selection taking place over the weekend.\n\n“The Royal Court Program has been a tradition for more than 60 years, and seeing the Derby Festival Princesses out in the community is one of the first signs that the Derby Festival season is around the corner,” said Matt Gibson, Kentucky Derby Festival president and CEO. “These young women are academic scholars, leaders in their communities and have resumes packed with awards and achievements. We’re honored to have them as our ambassadors.”\n\nThe 67-year-old Princess Program is coordinated by The Fillies, a volunteer group and The Kentucky Derby Festival. The first Derby Festival Princess was crowned in 1957, the second year of the festival. Organizers say the program is not a beauty pageant, instead, the five women serve as representatives of Louisville during the two-week event leading up to the Kentucky Derby.\n\nCandidates must maintain a minimum 3.0 grade-point average and are selected by a panel of three out-of-state judges. Criteria for selection include knowledge of the Derby Festival, poise, intelligence, personality, and campus and community involvement.\n\nThe first Derby Festival Princess was crowned in 1957, the second year of the Festival. Notable past princesses include former Kentucky Governor Martha Layne Collins and the late Gail Gorski, the first female pilot ever hired by United Airlines.\n\nHere's who is on the 2024 Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Court:\n\nMeet the 2024 Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Court\n\nPaighton Brooks\n\nThe 21-year-old from Alexandria, Kentucky is a student at the University of Louisville.
