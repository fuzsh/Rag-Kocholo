        "text": "Stepping into Churchill Downs’ Woodford Reserve Paddock Club Tunnel, the aroma of bourbon is immediate. The dark tunnel, part of a recently completed $200 million overhaul of the paddock, is lined with Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels, producing a scent that highlights not the overpowering odor of alcohol but all the other ingredients — like charred wood and sorghum syrup — that make up this version of Kentucky’s best-known export.\n\nContinuing through the tunnel and out into the sunshine and the middle of the paddock, another sensory hit — the distinct smell of horses — is followed by whiffs of cigars or perfume.\n\nThe paddock, the ring where horses warm up and are saddled prior to racing at the stately 149-year-old racetrack in Louisville, was previously accessible only to horse owners, but is now 2.5 times larger and encircled by three tiers of seating and a large plaza. Club SI and the Woodford Reserve Paddock Club, from which the one-of-a-kind, bourbon-scented tunnel stems, were added at the base of the tiered structures, with clear views into the paddock through glass walls. The renovation also created a wow-type entry sequence for fans by reorienting the paddock to face the main entrance and demolishing a 1920s-era building that blocked the Twin Spires.\n\nBoth new clubs were unveiled in time for the 150th Kentucky Derby, the latest in a decade-long string of capital improvement projects totaling roughly $530 million that have elevated the experience at Churchill Downs above any other in horse racing and made it among the most premium sports venues in the world. More than a third of Derby Week attendees are considered premium guests. Ticket sales revenue, which makes up roughly 55% of Kentucky Derby revenue, has grown 130% during the 10-year building spree.\n\n“We’ve been investing a lot of money where we think our customers want to see it,” said Churchill Downs President Mike Anderson, who took his current role in December 2020. “And obviously, it’s worked thus far.”\n\nPublicly traded Churchill Downs Inc. (CDI) has furthered the distance between itself and the rest of the horse racing world during the past decade by diversifying its investments beyond tracks and into casinos and hotels, online betting, and historical horse racing (HHR), the latter a type of betting game not too dissimilar to slot machines. In 2023, live and historical horse racing brought in $1.1 billion of Churchill Downs’ $2.5 billion in net revenue.\n\nThat financial success enabled Churchill Downs to grow at a time when most of its peers are contracting. The other two legs of the Triple Crown — the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in New York and the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico in Maryland — have either confirmed or floated major renovations that will decrease the full-time size of their venues and rely on flexible seating options to increase capacity during their Triple Crown events one week each year.\n\n“They’re setting a new standard for the equine world,” said Mason Hansen, Populous principal and interior design director, who, with the design firm, has worked on the 158-acre Churchill Downs for the past eight years. “They’ve done a lot of improvements that some of the others have not yet, and that’s created a bit of a stir.”\n\n‘Don’t screw with history’\n\nThere has been a facilities master plan for each year of Anderson’s 28 with CDI, and many more in the decades before that. When initial assessments for the most recent began in 2016, Populous’ designers, including Hansen and Kelly Kerns, encountered a legendary facility that over a century had crowded its history — including its most iconic aspect, the Twin Spires — with various additions. The grand venue did not have a fan entry sequence to match. Fans passed through the main gate and were met by the back of a building.\n\n“So, when we first started doing improvements to the track, went there, and toured through all these facilities,” Kerns said, “we realized it’s not in the condition it was portrayed as on TV.”\n\nBrick and steel beams from the original Twin Spires building, constructed in 1895, were discovered and highlighted in the renovation, and JC insignia were placed at the new entrance, a reference to Louisville Jockey Club, the outfit that helped found Churchill Downs in the 19th century.\n\n“We’ve been very careful and surgical to add new amenities around the existing footprint throughout the last 20 years,” Anderson said. “We’ve listened to the folks that have been here for 40, 50 years and saying, ‘Don’t screw with history,’ and we’re also listening to our new customers saying, ‘This is what we want.’”\n\nBefore COVID, there were plans to spend $300 million on a hotel and a ballroom-type convention space.\n\nThe pandemic did inspire a pivot to all-inclusive food and beverage for all premium guests, a decision first made to allow the 2021 Derby to be held — it had 56,000 attendees, about a third of the usual number — that’s since resulted in operational and budgeting efficiencies. Churchill Downs largely knows what its F&B revenue will be each year, and because general admission infield fans are now limited to concessions outlets in the infield, crowding on the frontside of the track and around the paddock has diminished. For premium guests, there are no cash transactions — lessening security concerns associated with huge amounts of paper currency — nor credit card transactions, meaning the venue isn’t affected by payment processing outages. There are no point-of-sale devices needed, either.\n\nLean into luxury\n\nInstead of the hotel and convention center building plan, Churchill Downs listened to market demand and leaned into premium, spending $300 million in the past three years. There are roughly 65,000 reserved seats on the frontside of the track — basically everything apart from the infield — including the 7,000 seats added with the First Turn Experience project, and the venue boasts 45 seating products, easily four times the average at most stadiums or arenas and ranging in price from nearly $700 for loge boxes near the paddock to $15,000 per person in the Spires Terrace and Suites. The staff of Sarah Contardo, Churchill Downs vice president of sales and strategy, only numbers 40 people in ticketing and premium.\n\nThe loge boxes spread across three levels surrounding the paddock take the new addition’s premium seating total to 3,600. The paddock is much more vertical now, in part because it was recessed seven feet into the ground, enabling more people to see it.\n\nClub SI — its naming rights and decor taken by Sports Illustrated — and the Paddock Club (1,300 seats combined) sit on either side of the horses’ path to the track. One-way glass enables guests to see the thousand-pound horses as they prepare to race or get saddled mere feet away, but prevents the horses from potentially getting spooked.\n\nIn one of Churchill Downs’ most premium spaces, service is central to the Paddock Club experience. Besides seats in the grandstand and a private betting parlor, the Paddock Club includes full concierge service from Churchill Downs’ 90-person concierge team, which can help guests get off-site reservations or rides home, but also help them source hats or get clothing altered last minute. The women’s restroom includes a lengthy makeup table with chairs and hair stylists and makeup artists hanging out during the Derby to provide touch-ups free of charge.\n\nThe Paddock Club features family-style meals at guests’ tables, enabling Chef Robert Lopez and his Levy team to paint a picture with lengthy layouts of food, much of which is sourced from local farms. Four days ahead of this year’s 150th Derby, an attendant prepped a bourbon and bon-bon pairing in a private tasting room. A $15,000 bottle of Woodford Reserve sat behind a glass case.\n\nWithin the paddock tunnel, a secret speakeasy hides behind the bourbon barrel walls, one of three scattered around Churchill Downs. The secret space is used for private toasts with current or potential sponsors, VIPs and visiting executives. During the Derby, Anderson said he and his team will host between 10 and 30 corporate partner prospects. The Louisville Mayor’s Office and Kentucky Governor’s Office host economic development prospects, too. Getting them to Churchill Downs for the Derby is key.\n\n“People don’t understand Derby unless you’ve been to Derby. It’s really hard to explain,” Anderson said. “It’s a magic feeling.”\n\nChurchill Downs’ place in horse racing\n\nAs Churchill Downs expands and ascends, it stands in marked contrast to the rest of horse racing. More than 40 tracks have closed since 2000, including Arlington Park, which Churchill Downs sold to the Chicago Bears for nearly $200 million, and Hollywood Park, which eventually became SoFi Stadium.\n\nThe other two legs of the Triple Crown at Belmont and Pimlico are both poised to downsize in the coming years. Belmont is run by the New York Racing Association (NYRA), a quasi-government agency overseen by the state that licenses the right to operate the Belmont Stakes. Pimlico, home to The Preakness, was just turned over to Maryland state control by the Stronach Group, which will then lease The Preakness license to a new operator.\n\nPerhaps the most important difference between Churchill Downs and the other two is CDI owns the Kentucky Derby. Ownership allows CDI to further profit off the Kentucky Derby’s brand and IP, like the Twin Spires betting product, and its multifaceted business, including a 200- to 300-event-per-year private and corporate events business and 30 owned-and-operated casinos nationwide.\n\nChurchill Downs’ $2.75 billion acquisition of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment (P2E) and its racetrack, casino and hotel, and historical horse racing (HHR) facilities last year, doubled the size of the company, while HHR has been a “wildly successful” — Anderson’s words — addition to the CD portfolio during the past 13 years. It opened its first HHR facility, the $65 million, 800-machine Derby City Gaming in Louisville, in 2018. Another location has since opened. The racetrack gets a piece of every dollar bet at the HHR facilities, which Anderson puts into prize purses that are among the highest in the country. In 2018 when Derby City Gaming opened, Churchill Downs’ total racing prize purse for the year was nearly $39 million. This year, it will top $86 million, including $5 million for the Kentucky Derby (compared to $2 million for the Belmont Stakes and $1.5 million for The Preakness).\n\nLive horse racing and HHR are listed in the same revenue segment in Churchill Downs’ Securities Exchange Commission filings. That pairing encompasses the future for the owners of the most famous venue and race, a future in which the sport and enjoying it in the finest way possible are still critical to the bottom line but buffeted increasingly by digitally based lines of business.\n\n“We have the greatest race on the planet and we’re going to do everything we can to preserve the tradition and history and grow it. Fashion, food, horse racing thrown in, too,” Anderson said. “It’s also part of what we’re supposed to do as a company, and the history of 149 years, is to ensure that this place is here for another 150 years. That’s not purely ROI, but to make sure that we’re still standing, we keep this thing going.”"
