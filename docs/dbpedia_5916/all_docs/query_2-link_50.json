        "text": "Key words, titles and explanations to understand the C of E\n\nPeople\n\nThe Church of England believes in the “threefold order of ministry”, which means there are\n\nthree types of clergy: deacons, priests and bishops. You can be a priest only once you have been\n\nordained a deacon, and you can only become a bishop only if you have been ordained a priest.\n\nDeacons are the first rung on the ladder. They can use the title Reverend, preach and hold\n\nSunday services, but cannot lead a service of communion and do not usually (but may) conduct\n\nweddings. The vast majority of deacons spend only a year as a transitional deacon before being\n\nordained priest. A small number remain permanently as deacons, sometimes known as\n\n“distinctive deacons”. They often assist priests in parishes and focus on pastoral work out in the\n\ncommunity.\n\nPriests are the bulk of the clergy in the C of E. After serving one year as a deacon they are\n\nordained priest and usually continue working in the same church as before. They organise and\n\nlead Sunday services, preach, conduct baptisms, weddings and funerals, and lead services of\n\ncommunion. Some priests do not work in parish ministry, and can instead become chaplains in\n\nprisons, the military, hospitals or other non-church settings. Others work in academia, C of E\n\ninstitutions, or take on part-time jobs mixing and matching all of the above. It is a status, not a\n\njob title, so once you are ordained priest you are a priest for life, regardless of if you are actually\n\nin any particular post.\n\nBishops are the leaders of the C of E. There are about 150 in the Church, all chosen from the\n\nranks of the priests. Some are diocesan bishops, which means they are in charge of a diocese\n\nand responsible for all the clergy and work going on in that particular geographical region. Most\n\ndioceses also have at least one and as many as four or five suffragan bishops. These are\n\neffectively assistant bishops, who either help the diocesan bishop in running the diocese, or\n\nsometimes are given specific sub-regions in the diocese to look after.\n\nOrdinand While someone is training to become a deacon (and then a priest), they are an\n\nordinand. There are a wide variety of ways to train: it can be in a traditional residential college,\n\nit could be part-time (coming into a college one or two days a week), or it could be a distance\n\nlearning course. Ordinands must undertake theological study, normally a degree, as well as\n\nlearning more practical things about how to be a priest. “Mixed-mode” training, where the\n\nordinand works most of the time for a church, while doing their theological training on the side\n\npart-time, is becoming increasingly popular.\n\nThe service at which ordinands become deacons and deacons become priests, is called\n\nordination. Deacons are normally ordained in a big service once a year in the summer\n\n(Petertide) at each diocese’s cathedral and is led by the bishop. The ordination of deacons as\n\npriests oftens happens in late September (Michaelmas) in a larger church or cathedral.\n\nCurate Once an ordinand has finished their training (which usually takes two or three years),\n\nthey must then serve an apprenticeship of three to four years called a curacy, working under a\n\nmore experienced priest, called a training incumbent. As a curate, the deacon/priest is expected\n\nto start gradually to take on more responsibility and try the various tasks (preaching, leading\n\ncommunion, conducting weddings and funerals) of a priest, while also doing some extra training\n\ncourses.\n\nVicar Once the curacy is finished, the priest is now eligible to be appointed to run a parish full\n\ntime. The title of this job is usually vicar.\n\nRector For complicated historical reasons to do with how the medieval church paid its clergy,\n\nwhich are mostly lost in the mists of time, some parish priests are called rectors instead. There is\n\nno actual difference between the job done by rectors or vicars: it refers only to which particular\n\nparish they have been appointed.\n\nTeam rector/team vicar The one exception to this is team ministries, where multiple parishes\n\nare collected into a group. Then one of the priests will become the team rector, who is\n\nnominally in charge of the group. The other technically more junior priests working underneath\n\nthem are called team vicars.\n\nPriest-in-charge Another term used for priests running a parish. Again, the actual work done is\n\nexactly the same as a rector or vicar. The only difference is that a priest-in-charge has slightly\n\nless freedom to act as they please, not holding the freehold of the parish, and – unlike rectors\n\nand vicars – they work on a time-limited contract basis for the diocesan bishop.\n\nStipends Clergy are paid a “stipend” rather than a salary if they are working an ordinary parish\n\njob. It varies in amount from diocese to diocese, but tends to be in the range of £22,000-\n\n£25,000 a year. It is not a salary but an allowance given to cover living costs, as most parish\n\npriests are not employees of the bishop or diocese, but independent office-holders with no\n\nformal contractual obligations. Bishops, deans, archdeacons and archbishops also receive\n\nstipends, which go up with seniority.\n\nNon-stipendiary minister/self-supporting minister Both terms refer to a priest who is not paid\n\nby the C of E. They can be either full-time or part-time, and are mostly older people who have\n\ncome into the clergy later in life and do not want or need a salary. They can still have the same\n\nresponsibilities and take the same jobs as any other priest.\n\nHouse for duty Another slightly different way of being an unpaid priest. A house for duty job\n\nmeans the priest appointed to this parish will not be paid but will be given a house to live in.\n\nPermission to officiate If a priest has retired from full-time work but still wants occasionally to\n\nlead services at churches on behalf of other vicars, they must apply for permission to officiate\n\nfrom the diocesan bishop. The cadre of retired clergy with permission to officiate are an\n\nessential part of keeping Sunday services going in rural areas, where there are not enough fulltime\n\nclergy to cover every church.\n\nDean A dean is a priest who is in charge of a cathedral. They act both as spiritual leader,\n\norganising the worship and services, and also as a professional chief executive, running the\n\ndozens (sometimes hundreds) of staff needed to keep these often ancient buildings going.\n\nRural dean or area dean Nothing to do with a cathedral but a senior priest in a deanery, chairing\n\nthe deanery synod and working in support of the archdeacon.\n\nArchdeacon Priests who work as senior members of a diocese’s staff. They act as deputies for\n\nthe bishops of the diocese, in particular checking up on the clergy, carrying out various\n\ninspections, offering guidance during vacancies, administering human resources issues, and lots\n\nof other administrative minutiae needed to keep the diocese going.\n\nArchbishop In Anglicanism, an archbishop is the chief bishop of a province. They are the most\n\nsenior of all the diocesan bishops and have a number of other institutional roles and\n\nresponsibilities. There are two archbishops in the Church of England: the Archbishop of York and\n\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, each in charge of their own province. The Archbishop of York is\n\nalso Primate of England, while the Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of All England (the\n\nwhole Church of England) and therefore the senior of the two. Each archbishop is also the\n\ndiocesan bishop of a diocese, although most of the day-to-day running of it is delegated to one\n\nof their suffragan bishops.\n\nThe religious life The term used for monks and nuns. Members take vows and follow a common\n\nrule. As well as traditional secluded or cloistered communities of monks and nuns, there are a\n\ngrowing number of more informal and modern groups, whose members may live among\n\neveryone else and work normal jobs.\n\nReader These are un-ordained lay people, not priests, who are still given some theological\n\ntraining and licensed to help lead worship, preach at services, and assist in pastoral and\n\nevangelistic work. Often now known as licensed lay ministers (LLMs).\n\nLaity The collective term for everyone who is not ordained as a deacon or priest, i.e. most of us.\n\nThe adjective form is “lay”, and currently the Church of England is very exercised about trying to\n\nmake sure “lay leadership” is encouraged rather than just letting the priests do everything.\n\nChurchwarden Each parish church is supposed to appoint two members from its congregation to act as churchwardens. They must be elected annually by the church and can normally only serve six years in a row before standing down. Their role is to support the parish priest in running the church, in particular relieving some of the administrative burden. They are particularly important during a clergy vacancy, as they must ensure the worship and life of the church continues while the search for a new priest is carried out.\n\nPlaces\n\nParish The smallest geographical sub-division in the C of E. The whole of England is divided into\n\nabout 12,500 parishes. Each parish has its own church (occasionally more than one), and has a\n\npriest who is responsible for arranging regular services. With more than 16,000 churches, the\n\nChurch has rarely had enough clergy to give every parish its own priest, so it is very common for\n\npriests to be in charge of several churches or parishes at the same time.\n\nDeanery The next level up, a deanery is a group of parishes in a geographic region. Other than\n\ngathering for deanery synod meetings, it is mostly just a way of linking parishes.\n\nDiocese A diocese is a group of deaneries. They are the main geographical sub-divisions of the\n\nChurch of England, which has 42 of them, including the Diocese in Europe. They vary\n\nenormously in size but tend to have hundreds of parishes and clergy within each. They are each\n\nlegally independent bodies, which have their own staff and operate often quite separately from\n\nother dioceses and the national Church. They each have a diocesan bishop who is in charge, and\n\nnormally at least one suffragan bishop assisting them.\n\nCathedral Each diocese also has at least one cathedral, which is a large church and acts as the\n\n“seat” (hence the name, from the Latin cathedra, or chair) of the diocesan bishop. The cathedral\n\nis effectively the mother church of the diocese, and hosts large events and special services. They\n\nare run by deans, who have complicated relationships with the bishop, who is technically their\n\nboss but actually has little power to interfere in the day-to-day running of the cathedral. There\n\nare also a group of priests and lay people who help the dean, known as the cathedral chapter.\n\nProvince This is the next biggest geographical region, encompassing many dioceses and run by\n\nan archbishop. In England, there are two provinces: the province of Canterbury which is all of\n\nthe south and the Midlands as far north as Derby, and the province of York, which is basically\n\nthe north. Outside of a few technical legal issues, the provinces are not particularly relevant.\n\nThe Anglican Communion The Church of England is just one of 40 Anglican churches across the\n\nworld. These are mostly, but not exclusively, found in Commonwealth countries and tended to\n\nbe started by C of E missionaries during the British Empire. They are all autonomous institutions\n\nbut share a common heritage and lots of similar traditions. Sometimes, Anglican churches in\n\nother countries use the name “episcopal” instead. Although each Church is self-governing, the\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury is regarded as the “first among equals” among the archbishops and\n\nthe Church of England is the mother Church of the whole communion. There are occasional\n\ngatherings of Anglican leaders globally, including the Anglican Consultative Council, primates’\n\nmeetings and the Lambeth Conference.\n\nChurch plant In recent decades, the C of E has thought beyond the traditional parish structure of\n\none church in every community. Church plants are where a new congregation is started from\n\nscratch in a particular place, even if there is already a parish church nearby. They more often\n\ncome from the evangelical wing of the Church and are popular with younger people in their\n\ntwenties and thirties. Sometimes a church will be “planted” into a small and struggling parish\n\nchurch, with a new leader and congregation parachuted in from outside.\n\nRoyal peculiar This is any church which is not a parish church and is not part of a diocese.\n\nExamples include Westminster Abbey, or the chapel at Windsor Castle. They are not under the\n\nauthority of the local bishop but instead governed directly by the Queen, who appoints their\n\nclergy.\n\nFresh expression This is another new movement which has grown quickly in recent decades. A\n\nfresh expression of church is any kind of congregation which does not meet in the standard\n\nSunday morning parish church style. There is an enormous range, from Christians gathering in\n\ncoffee shops or cinemas on weekday evenings, to meetings which take place around an activity\n\nlike hiking or dancing.\n\nMessy church This is a similar movement to fresh expressions but focused on creating church\n\nservices which are more informal, child-friendly and fun to attract families who would not\n\nattend a traditional service. They can take place on other days of the week and often feature\n\ntoys, sports, crafts and music quite prominently.\n\nLiturgy\n\nLiturgy The general name for the form of worship in a service including formal written prayers,\n\nreadings, and other calls and responses which make up the bulk of a traditional Anglican service.\n\nIt is foundational for Anglo-Catholics. Most Anglican worship uses liturgy in one form or another\n\napart from the most informal services.\n\nHoly communion/the mass/the eucharist Three names which all refer to the same thing, the\n\nmain liturgical service of worship in the C of E. Canon law requires it to be celebrated each\n\nSunday in every parish (although some more evangelical parishes celebrate it less often).\n\nInstituted by Jesus at the Last Supper, this service involves all the congregation sharing in the\n\nsacrament of bread and wine. Anglo-Catholics who tend to call it mass, believe this ritual is an\n\nessential part of Christian life and the foundation of a believer’s connection to God. They also\n\nmostly believe the wine and bread literally turns into Jesus’s blood and body, a doctrine known\n\nas the “real presence”. Evangelicals, who usually call it communion, see the service as a way of\n\nremembering Jesus’s death on the cross for their sins, and see the bread and wine as a symbol.\n\nEvensong Another popular service, especially in cathedrals, and one of the few things genuinely\n\nunique to the C of E. Evensong normally takes place with a choir in the afternoon/evening at\n\nlarger churches and cathedrals, and features singing of hymns, prayers and psalms, plus Bible\n\nreadings and other elements.\n\nBaptism A service of initiation into Christian faith. All Christians are supposed to be baptised, as\n\na sign of their belonging to the family of God. When this takes place as a child it is often called\n\nchristening, but can happen at any age. Anyone who lives in a C of E parish (ie everyone) is\n\nentitled to be baptised upon request by their local priest. Often this service takes place during a\n\nnormal Sunday service.\n\nConfirmation A secondary service of initiation, where those who were baptised as children can\n\nconfirm the promises their parents made on their behalf. Often done as a teenager, it is\n\ncommon for people to undertake a short course of classes in basic Christian teaching before\n\nbeing confirmed. Confirmation can be done only by a bishop, and so usually involves a special\n\nservice either at a parish church or in the cathedral.\n\nLectionary A guide produced by the C of E which gives Bible readings to use on every Sunday\n\nand weekday of the year. This is followed very closely by most parishes but less so by more\n\nevangelical churches.\n\nCollect A short prayer near the start of the service when the people have gathered, collecting\n\ntogether the various parts of the service. There are collects for each Sunday of the year and\n\nothers for special days. Most branches of the Christian church use collects and most Anglican\n\nparishes will always use them.\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer The first book of liturgy to be approved for the whole the C of E. It\n\nwas written by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury during the Tudor era and the English\n\nReformation in the 16th century. First published in 1549 and in its current form in 1662, it\n\nbecame the standard liturgy of the C of E until the publication of Common Worship in 2000. It is\n\nthe preferred liturgy used by Anglo-Catholics, but is seen by others as old-fashioned and\n\nfeaturing language too archaic to be useful in the 21st century.\n\nCommon Worship The alternative to the Book of Common Prayer, used by the majority of\n\nAnglican parishes. It combines contemporary and simpler English services alongside traditional\n\nlanguage versions and was first published in 2000.\n\nVestments/vesture The collective name for the various items of clothing priests can wear during\n\nservices. Each item has its own, esoteric name, and there is almost unlimited variety of robes\n\n(cassock, surplice, chasuble); scarves (stoles); and hoods. The colour of stoles and chasubles (the\n\ndiamond-shaped garment worn over the shoulders) changes for the seasons. Some vestments\n\nwere reintroduced in the last century by Anglo-Catholics imitating Roman Catholic styles.\n\nCommon to all is the clerical collar, the white upright collar commonly known as a “dog collar”.\n\nGroups\n\nAnglo-Catholic One of the three main groups in the C of E. Anglo-Catholics are so called because\n\nthey combine Anglicanism with more Roman Catholic traditions and style. They prefer more\n\nformal services, with choral music and organs, clergy in robes, incense and bells. They tend to\n\nemphasise the tradition of the Church very highly, although in terms of beliefs can vary\n\nenormously from very conservative Anglo-Catholics who hold to almost everything the Roman\n\nCatholic Church believes, to more liberal believers who are comfortable with gay marriage and\n\nrelaxed about divorce, but still enjoy a more formal style of worship.\n\nLiberal This group tends to have a middle-of-the-road worship style, which is neither very fussy\n\nnor very informal but happy to bring together elements from any tradition. Liberals believe that\n\nfaith is renewed by new insights and interaction with contemporary society and are often in the\n\nvanguard of progressive change within the Church.\n\nEvangelicals The third main group tends to have a “low” style of worship, which prioritises\n\ninformality. They often sing modern songs rather than traditional hymns, their priests\n\nsometimes do not wear dog collars, let alone robes, and they aim to make their services\n\naccessible to people who may not normally come to church. In terms of belief, they take the\n\nBible as their touchstone and see it as having the ultimate authority, not modern society or\n\ntraditions of the Church. A significant and growing subset are charismatic evangelicals, who are\n\nstrongly influenced by Pentecostalism and make engagement with the Holy Spirit and the\n\nsupernatural an important part of their church life.\n\nEvangelism/witness/mission Three words that basically mean the same thing – telling non-\n\nChristians about Christianity and encouraging them to become Christians. It is especially\n\nimportant for those in the evangelical tradition and has become an increasingly significant\n\nbuzzword and priority for the national C of E in recent years.\n\nSeasons\n\nThe Church of England’s calendar is divided into seasons, grouped around important Christian\n\nfestivals. The traditional beginning is Advent, which starts four Sundays before Christmas at the\n\nbeginning of December. Then Christmas season begins on the 25 December and runs until 5\n\nJanuary. Epiphany begins on 6 January (it commemorates when the Wise Men are believed to\n\nhave visited Jesus) and runs until 2 February. Then there is a period called Ordinary Time when\n\nwe are simply celebrating Jesus rather than and particular event or period. The next season is\n\nLent, which starts five Sundays before Easter, so anything from mid-February to late March.\n\nEaster season starts on Easter Sunday and runs until Pentecost, which is seven Sundays later\n\n(and marks the giving of the Holy Spirit to the first believers after Jesus’s resurrection). The next\n\nday we are back to Ordinary Time which runs all the way until Advent again.\n\nInstitutions\n\nGeneral synod Effectively the parliament of the Church of England, it meets two or three times a\n\nyear to pass new laws, scrutinise the national Church leadership and discuss other matters. It is\n\ndivided into three houses: laity, clergy and bishops. The House of Laity is about 150 people,\n\nelected on five-year terms from each diocese, depending on population. The House of Clergy\n\ncomprises priests, archdeacons, deans and chaplains, also elected on five-year terms from each\n\ndiocese. The House of Bishops is the 42 diocesan bishops plus a handful of elected suffragan\n\nbishops. The House of Bishops also meets separately several times a year, making leadership\n\nand strategy proposals to general synod, especially on liturgical and theological/doctrinal\n\nmatters. The most important decisions at the general synod, such as changing doctrine, require\n\na two-thirds majority to vote for it in each of the three houses.\n\nDiocesan/deanery synods Each diocese and deanery also have their own regional synods, with\n\nelected representatives from each parish. Deanery synods discuss budgets, clergy deployment\n\nand the future of failing churches and are responsible for electing the general synod. The\n\ndiocesan synod sets the budget for the diocese and discusses main items of concern to the\n\nchurch and society. When the general synod is debating major change, a majority of diocesan\n\nsynods will have to agree them first. For example, if enough dioceses had not voted for the\n\nordination of women as priests or as bishops, those pieces of legislation would not have\n\ncontinued.\n\nParochial Church Council (PCC) The PCC is a kind of executive committee of a parish church, and includes all clergy attached to the church plus the two churchwardens, any lay workers, and several representatives of the congregation, who are normally elected annually. It meets roughly two to six times a year, and makes all major spending and strategy decisions together with the priest.\n\nArchbishops’ council The executive decision-making body of the Church, which distributes\n\nmoney and co-ordinates national activities. A relatively new institution, it was set up in 1999 and\n\nincludes both archbishops, eight representatives from the houses of clergy and laity, two\n\nelected bishops, the head of the Church Commissioners and six other people chosen by the\n\narchbishops. It is answerable to the General Synod.\n\nChurch Commissioners They control the Church of England’s historic endowment of about £8.3\n\nbillion, investing in various portfolios and releasing investment income each year to fund a\n\nproportion of the C of E’s work and a part of the clergy pensions bill. In various forms the\n\ninstitution dates from 1704, and historically funded new church buildings and clergy pensions.\n\nToday they give about £220 million each year to the C of E (about 15% of its total income: the\n\nrest comes almost entirely from donations from congregants) which pays for the bishops,\n\narchbishops, national Church bodies, some cathedral spending, and other one-off new spending\n\nfor mission. They are legally an independent body from the C of E, although they work closely\n\ntogether and recently have agreed to give additional money from the endowment to try to\n\nboost church growth.\n\nCollege of Bishops Larger than the House of Bishops, the college includes every diocesan and\n\nsuffragan bishop. They meet fairly infrequently and tend not to take the big decisions but to\n\nadvise on them.\n\nPrimates’ meeting This is a sporadic gathering of all the primates (the leading archbishop) of\n\neach province of the Anglican Church worldwide. Called by the Archbishop of Canterbury, they\n\nmeet to discuss big picture strategy and handle disagreements. It has recently become more\n\nsignificant as liberal pro-gay provinces in the Western world become more estranged from\n\nconservative provinces in the global south.\n\nLambeth Conference Held roughly every 10 years, this is a gathering in England of every bishop\n\nin the entire Anglican Communion. It is not clear if it actually has any formal decision-making\n\npowers over individual churches, but its conclusions are widely seen as significant. The next\n\nmeeting is in summer 2022.\n\nCrown Nominations’ Commission This is a committee formed to choose a new diocesan bishop\n\nor archbishop when a vacancy arises. It is formed of a mixture of clergy and laity representing\n\nthe diocese in question, plus some consistent centrally elected members who represent the\n\nnational Church. If a two-thirds majority agree on a candidate, the name is submitted to the\n\nprime minister, who then advises the Queen to appoint that person. This process is usually just a\n\nformality but in the past some prime ministers have rejected the commission’s\n\nrecommendation.\n\nRenewal and Reform A recent project spearheaded by the current Archbishop of Canterbury,\n\nJustin Welby. It seeks to re-energise the C of E and refocus its priorities on mission and growth.\n\nIt includes a number of streams, such as boosting young ordinands, spending more money on\n\nnew mission projects, streamlining bureaucracy, modernising the digital output of the Church,\n\nand better training for senior clergy leaders.\n\nCanon law\n\nCanon law Canon law is basically the rule book of the C of E, comprising the current\n\necclesiastical law. Canon Law can be changed only by the general synod and for liturgical\n\nchanges and doctrinal changes such as the ordination of women bishops, with the agreement of\n\nparliament.\n\nConsistory courts Each diocese has a consistory court which can hear cases relating to clergy discipline and the use of\n\na church building and grounds such as churchyards. With origins going back to the Norman Conquest, consistory courts maintain some High Court powers, for example in relation to witnesses, documents and contempt. They are courts of the land just as the High Court or County Courts, for example.\n\nChancellor Each diocese has a chancellor who is the judge in the consistory court. To be\n\nappointed, a person must have been a circuit judge or had the qualifications required to do so."
