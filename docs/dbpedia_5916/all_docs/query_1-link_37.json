Under the new leadership of Tri 4 Schools, the experience and impact of Berbee Derby will continue!\n\nAfter evaluating many charitable organizations, the Berbee Derby staff chose Tri 4 Schools. We are honored to be trusted to continue the event’s legacy. While the event will operate under new leadership and new name, the Birdie Derby, the incredible experience and impact on our community, children, families and schools will continue.\n\nWhy was Tri 4 Schools selected?\n\nTri 4 Schools supports the wellbeing of kids inside and outside the classroom through school grants, youth multisport events and wellness-based afterschool programs. 100% of entry events are donated to schools. Like the Berbee Derby, all proceeds of the Birdie Derby will continue to fund education. The resources, programs and projects funded by Birdie Derby promote a positive relationship between physical activity, and mental and emotional health.\n\nOur Commitment to the Participants\n\nTri 4 Schools produces exceptional events, where every detail is meticulously crafted to deliver an unforgettable experience. We are excited to provide the Berbee Derby participants with the same experience. We’re confident that the next 20 years will be just as special as the last 20 years.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nPlease join us in participating for in the 20th running of the Berbee Derby!\n\nMark your calendars for 12/5/23 and register for the Birdie Derby.\n\nKeep the tradition alive and join us for the 2024 running of the Birdie Derby!"
