        "text": "A major scheme to redevelop the Becketwell area of Derby city centre took a significant step forward this week as Developer St James Securities and Derby City Council exchanged contracts, triggering a planning application for a £200m mixed development that received 89% of support in a recent public consultation.\n\nD2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership has allocated £8.1 million from the Local Growth Fund to the development, subject to the approval of a final business case for the project.\n\nThe Becketwell project covers the former Debenhams store, Pennine Hotel, NCP Car Park and Laurie House at Becketwell with the first phase of development comprising of a high quality new public square and 342 Build to Rent apartments within two buildings, the tallest of which will extend up to 19 storeys in height.\n\nThe new multi-purpose public square will be the centrepiece of the proposed development.\n\nD2N2 Chief Executive Officer Sajeeda Rose said: “We are pleased to see the progress being made on the Becketwell project and will continue to work with Derby City Council to take the scheme forward.”\n\nChris Poulter, Leader of Derby City Council added: “The area has been in need of regeneration for years and this is a fantastic step in our plans to transform Derby’s city centre.”\n\nPaul Morris, director of St James Securities, commented: “We were delighted to be chosen by Derby City Council in March 2018 to deliver a truly comprehensive and badly needed major regeneration scheme for Derby city centre and are hopeful of a successful determination to this application by the end of 2019.”\n\nDerby Regeneration\n\nThe vision for the wider site is to create a whole new part of the city centre with its own distinct character and identity. This will take the form of a series of buildings, spaces and views that will enhance the attractiveness and vitality of the city.\n\nThe regeneration is expected to bring numerous benefits to the city, including a repopulation of both office workers and residents to the city centre which will help boost activity outside of traditional retail hours.\n\nIt centrepiece that the substantial levels of investment proposed at Becketwell will provide confidence for further new investment in surrounding areas of the city centre.\n\nThe work on the demolition of the former Debenhams building is set to start in September 2019, with construction work on the first phase of development set to commence in 2020."
