        "text": "Thirteen brands will enjoy top-tier sponsor status at the Kentucky Derby this weekend, including brands in four categories that are new to the Churchill Downs portfolio. First-year sponsor Ford's Garage, a restaurant chain with 23 units in the U.S., will serve as an official watch party location for The Run for the Roses. FanDuel is also aboard with naming rights to the Starting Gate Rooftop Garden. Among existing sponsors, Brown-Forman extended its partnership by five years through 2027, and this week it will debut the new Woodford Reserve Paddock as part of Churchill Downs' $200M renovation that is scheduled to wrap up in time for the Derbyâ€™s 150th running next year. Additionally, White Claw upgraded its deal with a three-year extension. Several other brands are deemed \"preferred\" partners (vs. official sponsor). That roster includes Kendall-Jackson and La Crema, both from Jackson Family Wines, as well as AT&T as the preferred fiber internet provider beginning this year. John Deere has provided tractors and services since 2012, while CDI-owned properties TwinSpires (online wagering platform) and Brisnet (handicapping data provider) will also see exposure during the race."
