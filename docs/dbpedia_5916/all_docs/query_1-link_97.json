        "text": "Trees and ecology\n\nConservative Councillor Chris Poulter also claims the smaller, younger trees don’t have any value (yet still thinks it's fine for the majestic centuries old trees near Markeaton to be felled?!). Those young woods are still habitats for wildlife, provide food for wildlife and sequester carbon. The Kingsway area had wildlife sites identified in the planning reports that will be permanently lost if the A38 expansion happens. The trees and shrubs also providing a screen against the current road’s noise and pollution.\n\nAlso we believe the number of trees is closer to 100,000 after Simon Beavis, an ex-council gardener who originally planted the A38 mitigation trees from 1980's counted them.\n\nNone of the environmental assessments in Highways England's planning application give an actual number for the trees that will be lost and some Derby City councillors tried claim that not even 100 trees would be lost from the A38 expansion when residents objected to the scheme (these councillors had likely not looked at the planning document maps, visited the tree felling areas and certainly not set out to count the trees).\n\nSo Simon Beavis set out to discover what that number is. Simon visited areas in the \"red areas\" in the Highways England maps that show where trees will be felled. Then marked out 20 sq metre grids, counted the numbers of trees in the grid and scaled it up to the area. Turns out around 100,000 will be lost.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nThis is outrageous that those in positions of power can spread false claims about carbon emissions and climate like this. Imagine if they were spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic? These kinds of lies have real world harm. We must hold them to account and ensure they do not abuse their positions of power.\n\nWrite to BBC Radio Derby and ask them to correct Councillor Poulter’s false claims about the A38 expansion.\n\nradio.derby@bbc.co.uk\n\nDo NOT vote Conservative in the local elections. As of April 2021, the Council’s cabinet is dominated by Conservatives (including Mr Poulter and Mr Barker mentioned above) who support environmentally destructive schemes without reading planning documents then spread misinformation about the schemes. How can we trust them to make any development and planning decisions for Derby or respond the climate emergency?\n\nEncourage others to NOT vote Conservative. If Derby City Council is going to act on the climate emergency, we must get the Conservative cabinet out of power. Since Derby declared a climate emergency in 2019, the leadership’s words and actions (or lack of) have clearly demonstrated they do not care about the climate and ecological emergency.\n\nAsk your other local election candidates what their stance on the A38 expansion is and their plans for the climate emergency in Derby. If they don't promise to set a carbon reduction pathway with targets that align with the Paris Agreement, then they aren't doing enough. To check this, look at the recommended carbon pathways for local authorities. Also see what other local authorities are doing in response to the climate emergency.\n\nWrite to the Councillors and request they publicly correct their mistakes and provide the correct information on the carbon emissions of the A38 expansion.\n\nmick.barker@derby.gov.uk\n\nchristopher.poulter@derby.gov.uk\n\nIf they refuse to, are rude and ignore your request. Then file a complaint about their conduct for dishonesty and disrespect.\n\nWrite to Derby City Council’s chief executive and request all Councillors and staff undergo climate science training.\n\nChief Executive Paul Simpson Paul.Simpson@derby.gov.uk\n\nDerby City Council’s leadership has failed to set any carbon reduction targets that align with the Paris Agreement."
