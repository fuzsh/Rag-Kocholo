        "text": "Based in Cincinnati, OH, the leadership of Jostin Construction includes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a founding principle. The concept of diversity wins characterizes this foundational tenet, as it is woven throughout the company’s culture. DEI is lived throughout the company and is pivotal to the company’s success in such a way that one cannot separate the two from each other. Dive into Jostin Construction’s experience with the application of DEI principles in the construction industry. This article serves as a case study of the successful integration of DEI into a company’s culture as a critical factor to ensuring long-term success in the modern workplace. ➤ https://lnkd.in/erkKQ6HX\n\nThere’s no denying the economic conditions of the last 20+ years have had a drastic impact on our industry. Multiple recessions, a global pandemic, rapid inflation, and increased cost of education have taken their toll on our profession. As a mid-career architect, I’ve been fortunate to have navigated these challenges, but it hasn’t always been easy. I can say with confidence that it’s because of the leadership and mentorship of those around me that I’ve become the architect I am today. The constant willingness of others to provide input and fill the knowledge gaps created by these external challenges has been a critical part of my development as a professional. Shoutout to Ruth Gless and the AIA Columbus ARCHway Mentorship Program for being consistent gap-fillers in my career. What gaps have you experienced on your journey? How have you addressed those gaps and moved from opportunity to agency? What can I do as candidate for The American Institute of Architects (AIA) At-Large Director to help fill those gaps? Let me know below!\n\nArchitects have a bigger role to play in helping to navigate through project complexities and enabling various expertise within teams to gel together and deliver more ambitious outcomes. “I had given everything and I looked around and everyone else on the team had given everything too. I just knew that this was harder than it needed to be. . . “ I believe that the diverse skillsets of architects can be used more effectively and clients need to understand this plus the importance of more effortless leadership to unlock huge potential on projects. This is about finding ways for expertise on projects to be of higher value. Not working any particular group harder. If you are involved in a project, you’re in a relationship with moving parts. If you don’t focus on its leadership, you’re being reckless with design. I thoroughly enjoyed my Radio Interview with Rosalind Derby in New Zealand. Thank you for having me on your show!

Here is a link to a Case Study about our work together: https://lnkd.in/eXpP9MYj Five key takeaways: 1. The value of bringing in outside expertise for major transformations: If your organization is facing a transformation or generating its own, it helps to bring in someone who has “been there/done that” before. 2. The importance of creating a compelling vision and strategic plan: Knowing where you want to go and having a plan to get you started is a key to success. 3. The power of an executive partnership: Find an executive thought-partner who cares about you and your team’s success and understands how organizations work adds significantly by accelerating progress and providing a sounding board. 4. The benefits of the fractional model: The fractional executive model gives you access to world-class expertise without a long-term hire, saving time and money. 5. The impact of taking a people-first approach: A people-focused approach that takes the time to understand your working style, the organizational culture and the people involved helps ease the inevitable changes and drive adoption.
