        "text": "NACOGDOCHES, Texas — Hosted by the Stephen F. Austin State University hospitality program, the fifth annual Kentucky Derby dinner and auction is set for 6 p.m. April 14 at the Fredonia Hotel.\n\nTentatively themed “Spring Day at the Derby,” the event will feature a four-course dining experience inspired by traditional Kentucky Derby dishes. A cocktail reception with a cash bar will take place at 6 p.m., and dinner will be served at 7 p.m. Silent and live auctions will take place throughout the evening.\n\nAs was the case last year, students enrolled in the special events production course — along with help from students in the introductory hospitality course — will plan and execute the dinner and auction. The students’ responsibilities include deciding the theme, menu, décor and other aspects of the event.\n\nThe fundraiser benefits the School of Human Sciences through student scholarships, student travel funds to conferences and industry events, and faculty development programs.\n\n“This event is important because it gives students a lot of experience in management, catering, customer service and culinary arts,” said Carlie Allen, adjunct instructor in human sciences. “Being able to handle a quality fundraiser is a valuable skill, and with the Kentucky Derby dinner and auction, hospitality students get the kind of experience they’ll need to start building their careers.”\n\nGuests are encouraged to wear traditional derby attire, which includes wide-brimmed hats, bow ties and colorful dresses. Tickets are $60 per person, $100 for couples and $400 for a table of eight and must be purchased in advance at sfasu.edu/give/hmsevent."
