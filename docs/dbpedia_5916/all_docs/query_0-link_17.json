        "text": "Wide review of the Club’s operations and executive structure results in changes.\n\nFollowing the recent appointment of Sam Rush as Derby County’s President and Chief Executive, a wider review of the Club’s operations and executive structure has been taking place. Led by Mr Rush, this has been with a view to ensure that all areas of the Club are working as best they can to deliver continued progress both on and off the field.\n\nWith the review now concluded, the Club can confirm the following changes:\n\n• Mal Brannigan, currently Vice-President Finance is to leave\n\n• John Vicars, Vice-President Operations has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer\n\n• Lisa Biesty has been promoted to Commercial Director\n\nCommenting on these changes Rush said: “When I came to the Club, I wanted to ensure that we had the best skill sets in the right places so that Derby can effectively take on the challenges ahead.\n\n“The changes we are making allow me to focus on the strategic vision of the business and to ensure that the Club’s non-football activities run as effectively as possible, whilst also enabling me to work very closely with the Manager and his team.\n\n“I would like to place on record our thanks to Mal Brannigan for his work and dedication since coming to Pride Park. While it is tough to let good people go, I believe it best for the long term interests for the Club and we wish him every success in the future.\n\n“Both John Vicars and Lisa Biesty will take on new roles going forward. Both are well known and respected within the community and I am sure they will continue to deliver an outstanding service from both an operational and commercial perspective.”"
