Arnold Schwarzenegger is starring in his first series ever!\n\nWhen a father and daughter learn that they've each secretly been working as CIA Operatives for years, they realize their entire relationship has been a lie and they truly don't know one another at all. Forced to team up as partners, FUBAR tackles universal family dynamics set against a global backdrop of spies, fantastic action and humor.\n\nAlso starring Monica Barbaro, Milan Carter, Fortune Feimster, Travis Van Winkle, Jay Baruchel, Andy Buckley, Aparna Brielle, Barbara Eve Harris, Fabiana Udenio and Gabriel Luna.\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#2\n\nThe only Fubar I recognize\n\nTurn down the suck, turn up the good\n\nZor\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n12,018\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#3\n\nThe only Fubar I recognize\n\nTurn down the suck, turn up the good\n\nHell yeah, can't think of a better movie to get fuckin rip-roarin' loaded to!\n\nStrafer\n\nThe Flagpole is Wider\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n29,837\n\nSweden\n\nrsfour\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n17,408\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#5\n\nBrother met both when they were filming here lol.\n\nshaneo632\n\nWeekend Planner\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n29,800\n\nWrexham, Wales\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#6\n\nPLEASE be good, I need me some good Arnie content.\n\nAuthenticM\n\nSon Altesse Sérénissime\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n32,018\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#7\n\nlooks fun!

With the daughter instead of the mother.\n\nCloseTalker\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n33,225\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#8\n\nWow, if Netflix was once known for throwing a ton of money at productions they clearly stopped before this shot. This feels like it could be on NBC.\n\nJ_Viper\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n26,036\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#9\n\nPLEASE be good, I need me some good Arnie content.\n\nYou know it won't be lol\n\nThe fact that not a single filmmaker knew what to do with Arnie once he came back is heart breaking\n\nawilliams213\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,287\n\nCT\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#11\n\nThis looks so much fun.

I actually laughed at a bunch of the jokes despite expecting to cringe going in. It might actually be good? The trailer makes it looks like it is almost a pure comedy with the spy premise and action merely being used to set up jokes.\n\nwenis\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n16,249\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#17\n\nLooks abysmal both visually and just in the writing. Arnie's gotta feed his animals either way tho I guess!\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#18\n\nYou know it won't be lol\n\nThe fact that not a single filmmaker knew what to do with Arnie once he came back is heart breaking\n\nIt was an open goal even:\n\nKING\n\nCONAN\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#19\n\nLiked what I saw. Bunch of decent jokes, Arnold is too old to be jumping from jeeps at full speed, but I agree with the others, it feels like a serialized True Lies and I'm going to be there for it.\n\nApr 19, 2023\n\n#20\n\nThe only Fubar I recognize\n\nTurn down the suck, turn up the good\n\nIs that the one with Terry from Trailer Park Boys?\n\nBishop89\n\nWhat Are Ya' Selling?\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n36,943\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nApr 21, 2023\n\n#22\n\nReverse true lies.\n\nLooks like it could be fun\n\nLegacy\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n15,704\n\nStrings\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n32,508\n\nApr 21, 2023\n\n#25\n\nNick Santora created this?

Almost every character is annoying and has like one character trait. I do enjoy Roo and Aldon together and Luna is great.\n\nI'll finish it just for Arnold though.\n\nVic_Viper\n\nThanked By SGM\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n29,490\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\n#38\n\nIts a good 6.5-7 out of 10. When it gets too silly it can dip in quality. It feels like a joke at really weird times.\n\nshaneo632\n\nWeekend Planner\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n29,800\n\nWrexham, Wales\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\n#39\n\nAfter this and Top Gun: Maverick I am crushing fierce on Monica Barbaro.\n\nDerbel McDillet\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nNov 23, 2022\n\n16,489\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\n#40\n\nI thought this was a movie.\n\nSoj\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n11,060\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\n#41\n\nFinished it. I actually want to see a second season now. The ending could be the setup for a better show if they follow through on it and don't hand wave a quick resolution.\n\nI hope netflix doesn't cancel it.\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\n#42\n\nTrailer looked fun. Will probably check it out this weekend along with abc\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\n#43\n\nI was expecting very little but the 1st episode was actually quite enjoyable. Extremely generic but a easy, breezy, turn off your brain viewing.\n\nHyun Sai\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n14,562\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\n#44\n\nThis was not great. I enjoyed Luna but the rest of the cast is weak and I couldn't finish the first episode.\n\nphranc\n\nNov 13, 2017\n\n933\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\n#45\n\nDefinitely enjoying this show. Could be a sequel to True Lies.\n\nHope it doesn't get canceled after just one season.\n\nThat puppet scene had me lol.\n\nStrykerIsland\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,263\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\n#46\n\nThe characters are great, really enjoying it. I'm four episodes in.\n\nphranc\n\nNov 13, 2017\n\n933\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\n#47\n\nHaha. Tom Arnold makes a cameo.\n\nRealCanadianBro\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,206\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\n#48\n\nKim Jee-woon got it right with The Last Stand\n\nThe Last Stand is great. Maggie and Aftermath are both solid as well. Sabotage had potential but it's kinda a mess and Killing Gunther has a killer poster is extremely entertaining and Earthquake Love slaps.\n\nLump\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n17,042\n\nMay 28, 2023\n\n#49\n\nIt's like the writing and production and vibe of something like Leverage but with Arnold, there are worse shows for sure"
