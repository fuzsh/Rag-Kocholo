        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is returning to the action-comedy genre with a new Netflix series, FUBAR, and not a moment too soon.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, people ask me when I’m going to do another big action comedy like True Lies,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement. \"Well, here it is. FUBAR will kick your ass and make you laugh - and not just for two hours. You get a whole season. It’s been a joy to work with Nick [Santora], Skydance, and Netflix to give my fans exactly what they’ve been waiting for.\"\n\nFUBAR originated as a military acronym standing for either “Fucked Up Beyond All Repair” or “Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition”—Schwarzenegger has used both while describing the series.\n\nThe series, originally developed at Skydance Television and first announced in 2020, was created by Nick Santora (Santora served as writer and producer on the hit show Scorpion, and also developed Reacher for Amazon, a show based on the popular from Lee Child). Schwarzenegger has worked with the indie studio before, partnering with Skydance before to make Terminator: Genisys and Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\nFUBAR will be Schwarzenegger’s first scripted television series. (His last season run came in 2017 with NBC’s The Celebrity Apprentice.)\n\nWhat is FUBAR about?\n\nFUBAR follows the adventures of a father (Schwarzenegger) who, alongside his daughter (Top Gun: Maverick's Monica Barbaro), learn they were in fact secret CIA operatives for years, a revelation that throws their entire relationship into doubt. The international spy thriller will likely deliver plenty of family adventure in a similar vein as Alias, the espionage drama series that featured Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber as father-daughter double agents.\n\n\"FUBAR is, by far, the most surreal project of my career,\" said Santora. \"I grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films -- I'd hit my dad up for a few bucks so I could race to the movies and see the biggest star in the world on the big screen -- so creating the first scripted television project for Arnold is unbelievably exciting for me. The thing I always marveled at was how Schwarzenegger could be funny while still kicking ass ... that's why I wanted FUBAR to be a hysterical, CIA-spy comedy mixed with heart-stopping action! And it is all that - and more. I'd love to elaborate with more details, but, sorry, it's classified.\"\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nIn addition to Schwarzenegger and Barbaro in the lead roles, FUBAR will also feature Fortune Feimster, Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Barbara Eve Harris, Gabriel Luna, Milan Carter, Fabiana Udenio, and Travis Van Winkle.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nSchwarzenegger just dropped the first full-length official trailer for FUBAR in his newsletter, sharing a first look at him and Barbaro in action together:\n\nWhen will FUBAR be released?\n\nAlong with the trailer, Schwarzenegger also gave his fans a release date for the series: it will begin streaming on Netflix on May 25."
