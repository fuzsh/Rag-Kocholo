        "text": "FUBAR: Balls to the Wall\n\nSpotlight Premieres\n\nD: Michael Dowse; with David Lawrence, Paul Spence, Tracey Lawrence\n\nTerry and Dean live like the world is one big heavy-metal parking lot. In the parlance of Western Canada, they \"give'r\" or achieve the seemingly impossible through an adherence to the tenets of hard-rock culture that may include a series of drop-kicks and shotgunned beers. Opening with an anniversary beer bash marking the loss of Dean's cancerous testicle, the film reintroduces the duo with a severe lack of money, jobs, and women. Adulthood suits Terry who moves in with the town slut and finds steady income, while Dean finds the dream of metal stardom increasingly and devastatingly elusive. What begins as an oft-told tale of interminable screw-ups ratchets up and up until the left-field climax complete with a gnarled family tree, Geddy Lee vocal stylings, and a Christmas reunion that makes The Family Stone look like the Waltons. In other words, they give'r.\n\nSlate includes everyone from Wes Anderson to the Zellners\n\nThe comedian and showrunner will speak March 9\n\nOur recommendations for an art and community filled weekend"
