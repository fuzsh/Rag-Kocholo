        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has just released his latest comedy 'FUBAR', in which Luke Brunner, a retired CIA agent, played by Arnold, is forced to mentor his daughter Emma, played by Monica Barbaro.\n\nHowever, not many know the meaning of the headline: 'FUBAR'. So, let's go over the meaning of this word. \"FUBAR will kick your ass and make you laugh for a whole season: not just for two hours,\" explained the Austrian actor in his latest interview on the Netflix platform.\n\nWhat does 'FUBAR' mean?\n\n'FUBAR' is military slang for \"F**ked Up Beyond All Recognition (or Repair)\". It is said to be a term that comes from World War II and refers to any situation, or person, that has gone wrong and there is no possibility of repair.\n\nIn fact, it is not the first time it has been used in the world of cinema, the first time was in 1989 in a comedy starring Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone. It is also used in the 1998 film 'Saving Private Ryan', where the military continually uses the term.\n\nSynopsis of 'FUBAR In the series Arnold will be Luke Brunner who, on the verge of retirement at the agency, discovers a family secret. Forced to return to the field for one last job, the series tackles universal family dynamics in a global context of spies, action and humour\n\nFUBAR cast'"
