Those names are Frank Darabont, Gavin O'Connor, and Andy Muschietti.\n\nBut at the bottom of the article, they do a little update on Marvel's current Ant-Man fiasco and casually drop two new (or new to me, anyway) names for potential directors: Nicholas Stoller and Michael Dowse. Excuse me while I run to imdb.\n\nOh! Nicholas Stoller directed Neighbors, Get Him to the Greek, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and The Five-Year Engagement, four movies I've never seen but people seem to think are funny. Michael Dowse directed Goon, a big favorite of mine."
