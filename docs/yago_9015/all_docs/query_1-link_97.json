        "text": "\"You're not here to play hockey. You're here to fight.\" During the Toronto Film Festival this year, we got our first trailer for the selected hockey comedy Goon from Canadian filmmaker Michael Dowse and starring Seann William Scott, Jay Baruchel, Liev Schreiber, and more. Now we have a new trailer for story about an outcast bouncer named Doug Glatt (Scott) who finally makes his way into semi-pro hockey and just kicks the hell out of the competition. The film got some decent buzz out of TIFF, and Matt Goldberg at Collider enjoyed the film quite a bit and even called it \"painfully funny.\" Watch the new trailer below!\n\nHere's the latest trailer for Michael Dowse's hockey comedy Goon, originally via JoBlo:\n\nAcclaimed Canadian filmmaker Michael Dowse (Fubar, Fubar 2, It's All Gone Pete Tong) returns with his latest, Goon, a raucous, hilarious take on Canada's one true national obsession — hockey — and the divisive topic of violence in the game. Co-written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg (Superbad, Pineapple Express, Green Hornet) based on the book Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey, the film is the Canadian comedy counterpart to Jimi Hendrix's version of the \"The Star Spangled Banner\": sacreligious, twisted and, somehow, perversely patriotic. This premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, and was acquired by Magnet Releasing. Goon is available VOD February 24th, and in theaters March 30th."
