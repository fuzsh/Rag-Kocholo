        "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 14/02/2012 (4570 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nMICHAEL Dowse, the director of the hockey movie Goon, is returning to Winnipeg (where much of it was shot) to be at the première on Wednesday at Silver City Polo Park.\n\nWinnipeg Free Press film writer Randall King got a jump on the première with a live question-and-answer session with Dowse at the Free Press News Café Wednesday.\n\nScripted by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg, Goon was shot around southern Manitoba in late 2010. Seann William Scott stars as a bouncer drafted by a hockey team solely because of his fighting skills. Baruchel stars as his loyal best friend and Alison Pill stars as the hockey fan who steals Scott’s heart. Liev Schreiber also stars as a rival hockey goon at the end of his career.\n\nDowse’s previous films include Fubar, Fubar 2 and It’s All Gone Pete Tong.\n\nWarning: This video includes strong language.\n\nDuring the interview, Dowse took a shot at some other Canadian hockey movies. Watch the video below.\n\nvideo player to use on WFP"
