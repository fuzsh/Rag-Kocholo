Michael Dowse, director of FUBAR, was in the red chair to talk about his recent work, The F Word, starringDaniel Radcliffe.

One of his other films, the hockey comedy Goon, is responsible for a peculiarly proud moment based on one of the lines from the movie.

"My crowning achievement is having [Montreal Canadiens goaltender] Carey Price refer to his goal posts as Siegfried and Roy," said Dowse. In Goon the goalie character Marco "Belchie" Belchior does just that. "That was it. That was, like, I'm done. I can hang up the skates."
