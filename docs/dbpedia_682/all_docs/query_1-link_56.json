Students must achieve a grade-point average of 3.5.\n\nIthaca College\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents were inducted into The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi, the nation's oldest and most selective collegiate honor society for all academic disciplines, at Ithaca College: Alison Dolan of Branchburg, Makenzie Holmsborg of Annandale.\n\nKean University\n\nKean University has three student groups attended the ninth-annual Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U), hosted by President Clinton and Chelsea Clinton at the University of California, Berkeley, from April 1 to 3. Seven students shared their innovative solutions to global and community problems and sought funding to further their ideas.\n\nTheir student-led projects are the Vertical Gardens Initiative from Be the Change at Kean University, Let’s Go Bigger from the Department of Occupational Therapy, and the Organic Multicultural Vegetable Garden from the School of Environmental and Sustainability Sciences (SESS).\n\nBe the Change has the distinction of attending CGI U for a second straight year and was given the added opportunity to present at the CGI U Exchange and Dinner on April 2.\n\n“We educate the leaders of tomorrow at Kean University,” said Kean President Dawood Farahi. “However, having three separate student groups representing Kean at Clinton Global Initiative University shows that our students are already proving themselves as leaders on the global stage.”\n\nThe Kean students attended the conference, accompanied by faculty advisor Norma Bowe, and were among more than 1,000 student leaders who made Commitments to Action through CGI U. Through their initiatives, the Kean students pledge to tackle the issues of poverty alleviation, public health, and environment and climate change, three of CGI U’s five focus areas, which also include education, and peace and human rights.\n\nBe the Change at Kean University fosters peace and hunger relief in communities through gardening. Starting first with “peace gardens” in Newark, the group then turned its attention to global needs. Last year, Be the Change shipped a freestanding vertical garden to a refugee camp in Kosovo after attending CGI U, and this year the group is seeking funding for its Vertical Garden Initiative to create a more cost-effective, light-weight garden that can be shipped to refugee camps or communities in need anywhere in the world.\n\n“We are very excited to be going back to CGI U for the second year in a row,” said graduate student Jillian Mahon of Bridgewater. The group's plans include designing and shipping vertical gardens to Syrian refugees in Greece, she said.\n\nLet’s Go Bigger from Kean’s Department of Occupational Therapy is a community mobility program designed to improve the health and wellbeing of senior citizens. The students are attending CGI U to expand a successful program that they ran in seven senior housing facilities in Rahway, Linden and Trenton that assisted older adults in getting out of their homes and into the community to engage in meaningful activities. Participants reported sustained physical, psychological and social benefits of increased involvement in their communities.\n\nThe Organic Multicultural Vegetable Garden from SESS is envisioned as a place for elementary and high school students to make cultural and environmental connections through gardening. SESS students will grow vegetables from diverse cultures, with the compost produced from food waste on Kean's campus, and teach local students about farming, sustainability and diversity at the garden, which will be located at Liberty Hall Farm at Kean University. The harvested produce will be donated to local food banks. The team hopes that, through CGI U collaboration, it can establish gardens in high schools and universities with diverse cultures and students.\n\nTo learn more about the Clinton Global Initiative University, visit cgiu.org.\n\nALSO: Kean University’s Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) will host Kickin’ for Courage, a campus-wide kickball tournament, at Kean’s Jim Hynes Baseball Field from 1 to 5 p.m. Friday, April 29. Student and faculty teams will compete at the even to raise money and awareness for Bonds of Courage, a nonprofit group dedicated to honoring military personnel in times of war and peace.\n\n\"I think I can speak for all of my colleagues when I say that it makes us proud to know that our students are so willing to assist others in need, especially our service men and women,” said Kean professor and PRSSA faculty advisor Jeremiah Sullivan.\n\nEight teams will vie against each other in the live competition. The cost of admission is $3 and includes food. All event proceeds will support Bonds of Courage and go towards care packages for service men and women.\n\nKean University began hosting a PRSSA chapter in 2014. The organization strives to expand student knowledge in the field of public relations and help its members to advance their careers, widen their professional networks and cultivate leadership skills. Each semester, Kean University’s PRSSA develops a campaign to help a local non-profit organization.\n\nThe Kean University Dance Team will provide live entertainment at the Kickin’ for Courage event. Several local businesses donated food and provided additional support. Event sponsors include: Padonno’s Pizzeria, Ferraro’s Pizzeria, Proud Pappas Pizzeria, JC’s Barber House, Wegmans, Starbucks and Shoprite of Union.\n\nFor more information, visit www.kean.edu.\n\nLehigh University\n\nKorey Finn of Whitehouse Station was selected for induction into the student associates honor's program, 2016-17, at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nMcDaniel College\n\nSomerville resident Nicholas Riga, a student at McDaniel College in Westminster, Maryland, participated in the National Model United Nations 2016 conference in New York City, March 27-31. McDaniel's delegation of eight students represented the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan. The mission of the National Model United Nations is to advance the understanding of the United Nations system and contemporary global issues through quality educational programs that emphasize collaboration and cooperative conflict resolution and prepare participants for active global citizenship.\n\nMisericordia University\n\nMisericordia University’s Department of History and Government, Government, Law and National Security Program, and Government, Law and National Security Club recently sponsored the presentation, “Lessons from the Field,’’ in which an active shooter trainer, sniper and SWAT team leader discussed various aspects of their careers to program majors and members of the campus community in Dallas, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe seminar, under the direction of Rebecca Padot, assistant professor of the Government, Law and National Security Program, featured Sgt. Bernie Fowler, head training officer, Active Shooter Trainer, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team; Patrolman Phil Thompson, sniper, Monmouth County Emergency Response and SWAT teams, and Cpl. John Weg, retired SWAT team leader, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team.\n\nThe law enforcement officials discussed the various ways the SWAT team can respond to government attorneys should an incident occur, as well as the coordination needed between the Monmouth County Emergency Response Team and other government officials. In addition, the emergency response team gave a presentation on the history of active shooter incidents in the United States and how law personnel should prepare to respond to an active shooter incident.\n\nALSO: Giving up time with family and friends to focus on those in need, 50 students from Misericordia University spent their spring break on volunteer projects in underserved areas of Schenectady, New York, and Washington, D.C., with Habitat for Humanity in Lakeland, Florida, and at the Young People Who Care Ministries in Frenchville. Campus Ministry and the Office of Community Outreach coordinated the four service trips.\n\nTwelve Misericordia students and three chaperones worked as street ambassadors and provided meals at the City Mission of Schenectady, a city where the poverty rate is nearly 10 percent higher than the state average. The group helped City Mission serve 600 meals and provide shelter to more than 100 men, women and children each day. They painted and organized the City Mission Thrift Store and assisted with Weekend Blessings, a food distribution program that provides more than 800 backpacks a week filled with non-perishable food items for low-income children to take home for their weekend meals. Among the student participants was Abigail Parsons of Annandale.\n\nDuring the evening hours, several students also walked the streets of Schenectady with City Mission Ambassadors, formerly homeless men in City Mission’s residential program who are paid by private businesses to walk the downtown area during evening hours. Businesses and visitors to Schenectady feel safer and men in the Ambassadors Program are able to earn money and build their work resume.\n\nIn other projects: A group of 12 students spent the week in Washington, D.C., where they accepted donations to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, visited with veterans, and participated in team building exercises under the direction of a wounded veteran who is a patient and volunteer at Walter Reed.\n\nAnother team of 12 students spent a week of service at Young People Who Care Ministries (YPWC) in Frenchville, a small town in rural Clearfield County. YPWC is a grass roots ministry that responds to the needs of people in Central Appalachia, Pennsylvania. The students assisted with home repairs, cleaning, organizing and yard work for the elderly of the community.\n\nA team composed of 14 students spent their spring break with Habitat for Humanity in Lakeland, Florida. The students worked on three different housing projects.\n\nOak Knoll School of the Holy Child\n\nStudents, faculty and parents from Oak Knoll School of the Holy Child in Summit traveled to Cuba for a photography tour during spring break in the midst of historic developments in Cuban-American diplomatic relations.\n\nEmily Goncalves, Grace Johnson, Grace Nydam, Allison Palmeri, Hannah Whalen, Hannah Bucknam, Mary Kate Bucknam, Olivia Quartell, Helena Lyons, Stella Lyons, Nicole Githens, Lily Sutton, Julia Smollen, and Adriana Coder were able to gain unique insight to the Caribbean nation and its culture during the March 15-22 trip.\n\nThe students’ journey, which was guided by professional photographer Jay Seldin, included visiting an Olympic boxing gym, masonry school and farms. At the end of the trip, students were able to have their photos critiqued by Seldin.\n\nJennifer Breitenstein, Oak Knoll’s Upper School photography teacher who also accompanied the students, said the students benefited from being immersed in a different culture, and said the timing couldn’t be better given the historic developments between the United States and Cuba.\n\nShe acknowledged while Cuba’s natural beauty was often on display during the trip, so were some of the economic and infrastructural issues facing the island nation.\n\n“It was a demanding trip. Our hotel, where the press stayed for President Barack Obama's visit, didn't have water for 24 hours,” she said, noting cellular phone service was also unreliable.\n\nLily Sutton '17, of Chatham, chose to view the lack of phone service as a positive development.\n\n“It was nice to disconnect from my phone and really learn about the culture,” said Sutton, who added that seeing traditional Cuban music and dances were her favorite part of the trip.\n\n“Their performances were so emotional and they had a lot of pride in what they were doing,” she added.\n\nPiscataway: Conackmack Middle School\n\nOn March 21, the Conackamack Middle School Team was crowned the winner of “Iron Chef Piscataway.”\n\nThis annual event conducted in the Piscataway High School Commons pitted three teams of middle school student against a team of their principals in an hour-long cooking competition. The teams had one hour to plan and cook a three-course meal with a secret ingredient that that commemorated Piscataway’s 350 anniversary – whole cranberries.\n\nPHS film students transformed the Commons into a television studio – guests could watch the action live from anywhere in the room, simply by looking at the mounted monitors. All food materials and prizes were donated by Sodexo Food Services. The event was sponsored by the Piscataway Education Foundation.\n\nRaritan Valley Community College\n\nThe Raritan Valley Community College Enactus team was named Regional Champion at the Enactus United States Regional Competition, conducted March 29 in Washington, D.C. The RVCC team now advances to the National Exposition, which will be conducted from May 15 to 17 in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe 40 Enactus members were honored for their contributions to the community including providing consulting services to small businesses, teaching youth how to run a bike shop, assisting 500 families with sustainable hunger relief, and helping a local women’s support group build their social assets.\n\nEnactus, an international non-profit, is a community of student, academic and business leaders committed to using the power of entrepreneurial action to enable human progress. Student programs are established on campuses across the nation. Enactus students apply business concepts to develop entrepreneurial projects that transform lives and shape a better, more sustainable world.\n\nRVCC Enactus students work throughout the year, including during the summer, focusing on projects that empower those in need in Somerset and Hunterdon counties. The team gives a 17-minute audio/visual presentation in front of a panel of business executives to persuade the judges that RVCC Enactus is among the most effective Enactus teams in the country.\n\nEnactus teams and their projects are judged on how effectively they meet the following five criteria: Target People in Need; Consider the Relevant Economic, Social, and Environmental Factors; Apply Business and Economic Concepts and an Entrepreneurial Approach; Effectively Empower its Target Audience; and Improve the Quality of Life and Standard of Living for its Project Beneficiaries.\n\n“I am thrilled that our RVCC Enactus students once again have distinguished themselves at competition,” said team advisor Tracy Rimple. “This is further evidence of the high quality of our students, the excellence of our programs, and dedication of our faculty and staff.”\n\nThe Enactus United States National Exposition offers competitive, energy-filled events where teams showcase the collective impact of their community outreach efforts. Students present their projects and are evaluated by business leaders serving as judges, who rank them on how they use business concepts to improve the quality of life and standard of living for those in need. The winners of these national competitions are then invited to compete at the Enactus World Cup.\n\nRVCC Enactus members represent a variety of majors, including business, engineering and criminal justice.

However, only about one in three (35 percent) says colleges are doing “extremely well” in preparing them for a job and career.\n\n“Measuring College Outcomes,” was authored by Darryl Greer, Stockton University’s William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy’s Senior Fellow, and based on a statewide poll of 770 adults who were either recent graduates of public and private colleges or had at least two years of college. The poll was conducted by the Stockton Polling Institute, which surveyed recent college graduates and students to uncover their opinions on their college experience and desired outcomes. The research was conducted as part of Greer’s Higher Education and Strategic Information and Governance Project (HESIG).\n\nSeventy-eight percent of recent graduates identified “internships or practical experience in college” as the most important factor to ensure success in a current or future job and career. Eighty-four percent viewed internships as “very important” to overall success in developing a career and finding a job. Seventy-three percent of recent graduates felt that college is worth the cost. However, 31 percent felt that the most significant change their college could have made to add greater value to their higher education experience would be to provide “more hands-on practical experience, such as internships.” About one-half of graduates and those with at least two years of college reported having had an internship.\n\nThe 2016 findings and prior reports can be downloaded at stockton.edu/hughescenter.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 15, HESIG and the Hughes Center will host a symposium on Achieving Student Outcomes: Linking Academic Success, Workforce Preparation and Civic Participation at Stockton University’s Campus Center Event Room. The event seeks to bring together collegiate professionals across New Jersey to discuss best practices for collegiate advising and career counseling, and will apply the “Measuring College Outcomes” findings. The symposium is hosted in support with the New Jersey Secretary of Higher Education’s Student Success Collaborative. Free registration is available here.\n\nThe Hughes Center can be found at facebook.com/StocktonHughesCenter and can be followed on Twitter@hughescenter.\n\nThe Hun School of Princeton\n\nFaces of Courage, a photographic exhibit by Mark Tuschman opened in the Wilf Family Global Commons at The Hun School on March 24. The exhibit is a collection of work documenting disadvantaged women from the developing world, regions like East Africa, Latin America, India and Asia. The gallery opening featured class visits and presentations from the artist followed by a book sale and reception. The exhibit is open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. or by appointment through May 13.\n\nTuschman’s work tells the story of women around the world who are denied basic human rights like health care, education, freedom, and justice. But it also tells stories of triumph, education, and the impact of micro-finance. They are child brides, sex workers, victims of domestic abuse, healthcare workers, and entrepreneurs. The collection is also the subject of an award-winning book, Faces of Courage: Intimate Portraits of Women on the Edge, produced in 2015 with the help of a Kickstarter Campaign.\n\nThe collection is a decade long project, a lifetime in the making. Tuschman explained, “I think growing up in Brooklyn made me sensitive to the plight of individuals less fortunate.”\n\nTuschman was deeply affected after visiting a women’s shelter in Ulan Bator, Mongolia in 2001. He decided then, to dedicate himself and his photography, to helping to bring women’s rights to the forefront of the world’s attention. First, he began working to document conditions for various non-profits and NGO’s. But somewhere along the journey, the project became his and the voice became theirs.\n\n“I wanted to tell the stories of these women as accurately as possible. My mission now, is to educate young people and to help create more activists,” he said.\n\nThe school is at 176 Edgerstoune Road, Princeton. Visit www.hunschool.org.\n\nThe Middle Earth afternoon program\n\nAs a result of National Volunteer Week (April 10-16), Middle Earth, a Bridgewater-based nonprofit serving youth for more than 40 years, is recognizing the hard work of their students who are consistently trying to make a difference in the community.\n\nMiddle Earth youth volunteer in community projects all year long. They help out at community events, harvest fresh vegetables to donate to the local food bank, organize pet supply drives for a nearby animal shelter, and clean local parks. They have even created balloon anchors for Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nLast month, middle school students from Bound Brook conducted a bake sale and raised more than $150 to give to the American Cancer Society for cancer research. The youth, who participate in Middle Earth’s 21st Century Community Learning Center, recruited volunteers to work and contribute baked goods, created a menu and pricing, and advertised the sale and its cause.\n\nAnother group of Middle Earth students from the same afterschool program recognized a significant problem at their school: the safety of the playground equipment. They researched safer options for the playground and developed a budget to see how much was needed to make their ideas a reality. The students presented their ideas to the school principal, who, in turn, pledged money to their cause. The students worked tirelessly planning and implementing a hot dog and lemonade sale at their school for three straight days during the afterschool program. As a result, the students were able to donate nearly $200 to the school, and the improvements to the playground are now being made.\n\n“Every single program at Middle Earth offers community service. We believe it is that important,” said Maria Strada, executive director of Middle Earth. \"Volunteerism provides youth with an awareness of the needs of others and a sense of personal responsibility to contribute to the larger community. I am, personally, so proud of these youth.”\n\nIn addition to community service, Middle Earth’s programs offer local youth a safe environment where they can use their free time constructively, engage with caring adults who listen, obtain help with homework, prepare for college and future employment, and participate in fun group activities. Their programs teach positive decision-making skills, acceptance of consequences for their actions, and leadership skills, as well as basic life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and obtaining a driver’s license. Learn more at www.middleearthnj.org.\n\nThe Middle Earth afterschool program was funded in its entirety with federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by No Child Left Behind, Title IV, Part B, 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC) grant funds through a grant agreement with the New Jersey Department of Education.\n\nThe Wardlaw-Hartridge School\n\nA group of Upper School students and four chaperones from The Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison enjoyed a 10-day trip to Spain during spring break.\n\nThe students stayed with host families, attended classes at Colegio Altair Internacional in Madrid and bonded with their new Spanish friends. They also took the opportunity to enjoy sightseeing in places such as Cordoba, Sevilla, Granada, Toledo and Madrid. They visited a beautiful castle in Segovia, walked through a walled city in Avila and enjoyed a fabulous tour of Real Madrid Stadium. Some of the host families took their homestay students to a soccer match.\n\nThe group also visited a few museums, including Reina Sofia and Museo de Prado, two art museums in Madrid. The students learned about the art in these museums during classes at the school in Altair.\n\n“Why do we encourage student travel? We want our students to see other places in the world and experience cultures different from our own. Travel can be a little scary, but once students figure out that they can connect with people despite differences, and they learn to navigate in new environments, students grow and become smarter, more competent individuals,” said Rhona Eserner of Edison, the trip leader and W-H Director of Global Learning.\n\nThe students who attended the trip were Akash Dalal of Scotch Plains, Alexandra Garces of North Brunswick, Allison Haley of Colonia, Aman Kaur of Iselin, Andrea Tobar of South Plainfield, Andrew Park of Westfield, Anisa Ahmed of Scotch Plains, Brennan Wright of Westfield, Jaden Dugenio of Branchburg, Jordan Borst-Ortiz of Colonia, Jordan Rose of Watchung, Joshua Marseille of Linden, Laura Arriaza of Plainfield, Learta Bajqinovci of Roselle Park, Neha Chhabra of Watchung, Raphael Genty of Scotch Plains, Samantha Anastasiou of Scotch Plains, Scott Hargrove of Fanwood, Sonali Shah of Edison, Sreeja Arumilli of Edison, Steven Bessette of Scotch Plains, Victoria Howell of Piscataway, Wilson Guo of Edison and Whitney Porter of North Plainfield.\n\nStudents from the school in Altair, Spain returned to the U.S. with the Wardlaw-Hartridge students. Their visit includes two trips to New York City, a three-day excursion to Washington D.C. and two days attending classes with Wardlaw-Hartridge students. The students from Spain returned home on April 6.\n\nWarren Township: Warren Middle School\n\nBefore there was the written word, there was oral tradition… entertaining storytelling used to pass on cultural and historical information from one generation to another. Fables, folk tales, and legends are examples of oral tradition that were used by communities of yore to reinforce values, address societal ills, and share history and customs.\n\n“Oral tradition is about taking a story and passing it on from person to person,” said Tahira, a professional storyteller who visited Warren Township Midle School sixth-graders in February to share stories based on African oral tradition. “It’s interactive. It’s not a passive experience.”\n\nTahira’s expressive and educational performance was a precursor for a language arts unit on oral tradition that 6th grade language arts teachers have been doing for years. Some classes begin the unit this month; others completed it last month.\n\nThe Language of Literature unit on oral tradition combines reading, narrative writing, and public speaking, with some modern-day technology thrown in for use in the oral presentations.\n\n“My students write a folk tale and may choose to write with a partner,” said sixth-grade language arts teacher Brenda Sasso. “The students are required to use a plethora of figurative language, repetition, great description, explicit verbs, etc. When all are finished, they illustrate and publish their works. We then share them with the class and put them on the bulletin board for my other classes to read.”\n\nSasso and Dean of Students Max Achtau worked with the PTO to bring Tahira’s “Gift of Story” presentation to the middle school as part of its cultural arts program.\n\nWith the help of a guitar, a shekere (a gourd covered in closely woven beads), communicative facial expressions and vocals that are clear and pure, Tahira delivered a high-energy, interactive program.\n\n“In oral tradition, there’s always some magical component,” Tahira told her young audience as she used the spoken word and song to pass on age-old African folklore.\n\nSubmitted by Mary Ann McGann\n\nWestfield Public School Board of Education\n\nThe spring season represents the start of the fourth marking period in the Westfield Public Schools and continued activity by the Board of Education.
