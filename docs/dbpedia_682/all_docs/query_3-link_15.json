        "text": "Through the Westfield experience, students become independent, self-assured, confident learners ready for college and life – and they make life-long friends along the way.\n\nThe educational program is divided into three distinct divisions: Lower School (grades PK-5), Middle School (grades 6-8), and Upper School (grades 9-12). The curriculum and content delivery are carefully attuned at each level to children’s developmental and emotional needs. The school’s administration, faculty, and staff work closely together to insure a smooth transition academically and socially as students move from Lower School to Middle School and on to Upper School.\n\nSmall classes allow teachers to build a personal relationship with each student and to develop bonds that are vitally important to a student’s overall success. Students receive quality instruction and engage in meaningful activities as they focus on core academic curriculum. This study is enhanced at all grade levels with a strong curriculum that includes foreign language, fine arts, technology, and physical education. The Advanced Placement, Honors, and College Dual Enrollment programs provide opportunities for students to experience more challenging academic rigor."
