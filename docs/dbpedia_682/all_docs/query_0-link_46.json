        "text": "Westfield State University (also known as \"'Westfield State'\" and formerly known as Westfield State College) is a comprehensive, coeducational, four-year public university in Westfield, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1838 by noted educator and social reformer Horace Mann as the first public co-educational college in America without barrier to race, gender, or economic class.\n\nLocation\n\nWestfield State is located 45 miles (72 km) from Hartford, and 90 miles (140 km) from Boston, both of which have international airports. The nearest bus and train station is in Springfield. Approximately 50% of students have a car on campus. There are 13 other colleges and universities in proximity to the campus.\n\nWestfield State University’s main 256-acre (1.04 km) campus is located in a suburban neighborhood along Western Avenue and accessible via the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority bus system, which is free to on-campus residents.\n\nThe Main Campus is known for its centralized large campus green, tall pines, flowering trees, and seasonal landscaping. Nine residential halls, five academic buildings, one dining hall, an interfaith center, a power plant, the campus center and library encircle the green, where intramural sports and recreational activities are common.\n\nAdjacent to Overlook Drive is the Woodward Center (athletic facilities) and The Horace Mann Center (administrative and academic space). Across from the Horace Mann Center is the 300-acre (1.2 km) Stanley Park, which offers many points of interest including a duck pond, rose gardens, soccer and lacrosse fields, hiking trails, a picnic area, and a wildlife sanctuary to name a few. The park also offers wireless internet access and is often used by the students.\n\nAs a major initiative, the university has begun establishing a presence in downtown Westfield that is a five-minute drive from the campus. Lansdowne Place is now housing upperclassmen at 38 Thomas Street and the Westfield State University Downtown Art Gallery has featured a variety of art exhibitions, since opening in the fall of 2008.\n\nHistory\n\nWestfield State University has a long and distinguished history that reflects the history of education in America. Retired WSU history professor, Robert T. Brown, wrote the first scholarly history of the Westfield Normal School, 1839-1914. \"The Rise and Fall of the People’s Colleges\" was published in 1988 by the Institute for Massachusetts Studies in Westfield. The following information is adapted from Brown’s work.\n\n19th Century\n\nIn Colonial America, school children would often spend more time working on their family farms than in the classrooms. When they did go to school, they were taught by very young schoolmasters, who really were not well-educated. Religious leaders argued that nothing could be done to improve schools until a better class of teachers were available and until teaching had become a profession like that of the ministry or medicine. There also had to be a distinct way of training them.\n\nEducational inadequacies and concerns for the welfare of young children reached its peak in the early 19th century with reformers noting that before teachers could be improved, training schools and methodology of teaching had to be established. As early as 1784, New York State created a Board of Regents to improve the new country’s schools and by 1795 provided for an annual appropriation of $50,000 to be allocated to school districts. In Vermont in 1823, the first teachers’ seminary was opened in Concord, which was later moved to Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Swiss educator Pestalozzi developed a way for teachers to study children and the learning process. This type of teaching was embraced by France and Prussia where schools for the training of teachers had been established. In France, they were called “normal” schools—for the basic norms of teaching. In 1835, the Massachusetts Legislature adopted this view and created the Common School Fund, whose monies were administered by the Board of Education.\n\nHorace Mann\n\nHorace Mann, the Secretary of the Board of Higher Education, who from 1837 to 1848 was in charge of most everything to do with education in the Commonwealth, began a statewide public speaking tour to galvanize popular support for “normal schools.” Relaying his vision of how education would enhance economic opportunity, provide stability and create law and order, Mann spoke to the general public, parents, the working class, and the wealthy and preached to the religious leaders. He emphasized how education would be “a social equalizer” and turn unruly masses of children into civilized individuals.\n\nIn 1838, under Mann’s aggressive leadership, state funds were appropriated to match a $10,000 gift from Edmund Dwight of Boston to establish in Massachusetts the first state-supported institutions in the United States for the training of teachers for the “common schools.” He chose the sites of the schools, hired the staff, and outlined the curriculum.\n\nReligious leaders played a strong role in Mann’s mission. Reverend Brooks met with Edmund Dwight, who was born in Springfield and who was one of the leading men of the Boston establishment. A newly appointed member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, Dwight had made his fortune in industry and was committed to many of the evangelical reformist principles.\n\nIn March 1838, Dwight approached Mann with an offer. He would donate $10,000 to improve the preparation of teachers if the legislature would match the sum. Mann quickly contacted the members of the legislature and won the acceptance and on April 19, 1838, Governor Edward Everett signed the resolve for a three-year experiment in qualifying teachers for the common schools.\n\nThe Barre Experiment\n\nOn December 28, 1838, the Board established two schools—an all-female school in Lexington, an institution which eventually became Framingham State University, and another in Barre, which became the first coeducational public training school in the nation and the forerunner of Westfield State University. A third school opened in Bridgewater in 1840, the forerunner to Bridgewater State University. The first class in Barre consisted of 12 women and 8 men, who passed the entrance exams and were admitted.\n\nA thriving village of 2,700 people, the town of Barre had a strong industrial base of cotton and woolen mills, a gunpowder mill and its biggest employer, a factory that made palm leaf hats. While Barre was able to live up to their financial agreement to the school, townsfolk were not prepared for the influx of normal school students and complaints were filed with the Board of Education. When the principal of the school’s health broke down, he missed the winter term in November 1841, and died soon after. This led to a failure of the Barre experiment and the school closed its doors in 1841.\n\nWestfield Normal School\n\nLeading the effort to have the school reopened and relocated was Reverend Emerson Davis, pastor of First Congregational Church in Westfield and William Gelson Bates, a Westfield attorney and a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In September 1844, Bates was instrumental in turning the tide within the Boston legislative bodies to have the school reopened and moved to Westfield. (Davis Hall is a dormitory named in his honor.)\n\nOne of the many arguments for the school to move to Westfield was the prosperity of the community. Westfield was a thriving industrial community and the largest settlement between Springfield and Albany. A canal connecting Westfield to New Haven, which was later replaced by a railroad, tied Westfield to Boston. It was also at this time that Westfield flourished as a center for the whip making industry and boasted successful tobacco growing and cigar-rolling businesses, powder mills, brick-yards and even an organ manufacturer. It was the ideal location for a normal school.\n\nOn September 4, 1844 the Barre school was reopened in Westfield and renamed the Westfield Normal School. In September 1846, a Greek revival building opened at the corner of Washington and School Streets to house the school.\n\nBetween 1854 and 1856, William Harvey Wells was principal. Wells had already established his reputation in educational reform and was the author of a major text on grammar and a national figure in philology. During his tenure, the Westfield Normal School began to grow and by 1856 there were 20 students in attendance.\n\nJohn W. Dickinson, a four-year faculty member and strong advocate for educational reform, was principal from 1856 to 1877. He believed that teachers had a responsibility to mold students and lead them on a path of perfection, of life and citizenship. An advocate of child health including nutrition and exercise, Wells embraced the individualism of each student and often lectured on the nature of education. During this time, the school was a two-year school that also offered an additional two years of advanced studies. (Dickinson Hall is the dormitory named in his honor.)\n\nThe Civil War and the post-war financial panic of 1873, which ushered in an agricultural depression until the end of the century, had a tremendous impact on Westfield. The war caused the withdrawal of male students and an influx of black students, and soon it was established that the school could be multi-racial. Booker T. Washington utilized the Massachusetts normal schools as a place of instruction for the most promising pupils at Tuskegee Institute. His chief organizer in the North was Samuel Courtney, who attended Westfield Normal School from 1882 to 1885 and became a practicing physician in Boston and a respected member of the Boston School Committee. (WSU now has a dormitory named in Courtney’s honor.)\n\nBy 1887 the school building had deteriorated and a request by then principal, James Greenough, for a new building was proposed. This aroused the competitive interests of surrounding towns. Northampton and Springfield proposed relocating the school to their areas in hopes of giving their towns an aura of prestige and the economic benefits. Their efforts failed and a new sandstone three-story building was erected on Court Street in 1892, heralding a new era in the history of normal schools.\n\nThe new school featured laboratories for scientific teaching. The first floor housed a training school that began with two kindergartens and a primary class. By 1898 it had grown into a school with nine grades and a kindergarten that educated 165 students.\n\nIt was at this time that money was appropriated for improvements in other normal schools throughout Massachusetts and new schools were built. Increasing the number of schools by two-thirds initially reduced the enrollments of the rest of the schools and by 1874 Westfield’s out-of-county enrollment vanished.\n\nWithin a few years, the state enacted tough new entrance requirements. These new admission standards and modifications of the curriculum made it difficult for students to gain admission, eventually resulting in declining enrollment, plummeting it to the lowest enrollment since the school moved from Barre. The faculty revolted, resulting in the resignation of Principal Greenough.\n\nWhen Charles S. Chapin arrived at Westfield as principal in 1896, he immediately began rebuilding the school and secured an excellent faculty, including noted marine biologist Charles Branch Wilson, for whom the university’s Wilson Hall is named. By the time Chapin left in 1901, the student body had doubled in size.\n\nEarly 20th Century\n\nIn 1900, a new training school was built on the site of the old normal school building. A full nine grades plus kindergarten would be housed in this building, run and staffed by the principal of the normal school. For the first time in the history of Westfield there would be ample opportunity to practice what the students had been learning.\n\nIn 1901, Clarence Brodeur became principal and served for 22 years. At the time, nearly half the students were commuters on the trolley line. No males were enrolled from 1897 to 1938. Most faculty earned only about $1,000 a year and faculty came and went due to the low salary.\n\nDuring this time the Massachusetts Legislature, in response to an outcry for public education to meet the needs of modern industrial and social conditions, created a Commissioner of Education position. The Commissioner was empowered to implement a program, which would make the normal schools responsive to industrial needs.\n\nSubsequently, many normal schools throughout Massachusetts introduced manual training including household arts, gardening, basket-making, chicken raising and the commercial arts. The resulting emasculation of the Westfield Normal School’s academic program in 1915 included reducing the nine science courses to only one, the abolishment of the four-year program, and having only 20 courses remaining in the curriculum: educational methods, sewing, physical education, penmanship, and methods courses. Money dissipated and the maintenance of the buildings started to decline.\n\nBy the time Charles Russell became principal in 1925, the school could not afford to have its catalog professionally printed and the Court Street building was unsafe for habitation. Russell’s accomplishments are many. He expanded community outreach, brought groups of visiting educators from abroad to the school to observe American methods and encouraged the faculty to think and act as professionals. In order to prepare students to teach at the junior high school level, he expanded the course of study from two to three years.\n\nWestfield State Teachers College\n\nWhen all the normal schools were renamed state teachers colleges in 1932, it made it possible for them to now legally offer a four-year college degree. Unfortunately, this giant step enhanced the vulnerability of the school’s dependency on the economy and as the Depression deepened, teachers lost their jobs and enrollment declined.\n\nMid 20th Century\n\nEdward Scanlon, for whom the university’s Scanlon Hall is named, arrived on the verge of Westfield’s 100-year celebration and began his 22 years of fighting off legislative attempts to close the school. In 1928, Governor Leverett Saltonstall proposed closing Westfield and three other schools, arguing that there were more graduates than there were teaching jobs available. His proposal did not pass the legislative process, but it was recognized that fewer teachers were needed. This led to a proposal that Westfield become a vocational training center offering courses for machinists, toolmakers, dental and medical technicians. This proposed change died in the legislature.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, the reputation of the whole normal school system sunk so low that Life magazine identified Massachusetts’ public higher education system as one of the worst in the nation. Again, there were legislative attempts to solve the problem by trying to close some of the schools, Westfield among them. Again there was rallying of supporters, which defeated closure plans in the House.\n\nYet in June 1953, the Westfield City Council voted to convey to the Commonwealth for $1 a tract of some 26 acres (110,000 m) of city-owned land in upper Western Avenue as the site for a new $3,025,000 Westfield State Teachers College. The college opened its new home in 1956 with nearly four-hundred students. The post-war economy buried money problems.\n\nWestfield State College\n\nFor the next 20 years, Westfield would continue to expand its offerings and on May 24, 1968, the legislature voted to change the names of state teachers colleges yet again to recognize such growth. For the next 42 years the institution would function as Westfield State College.\n\n21st Century\n\nIn July 2010, both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to change the state college system to a state university system, and to rename the six state colleges to state universities including Westfield. The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.\n\nWestfield State’s Office of International Education is fostering partnerships with institutions of higher learning throughout the world in order to expand international study and exchange opportunities. New academic majors and a program of campus improvements to the University’s infrastructure has been undertaken including renovations and new construction. Mod Hall, an office and classroom building, was added to the campus as well as new suite-style residence hall, University Hall. Plans are underway for construction of an academic building to be connected to Wilson Hall, which is set to break ground in September 2014.\n\nAdministration and Organization\n\nThe University President is the day-to-day chief executive of the university, appointed by and responsible to the Board of Trustees, a group of 11 community and regional leaders, currently chaired by John F. Flynn III, Class of 1979, and Chief Administrative Officer of the Massachusetts State Police. The President is assisted by a Cabinet, composed of five Vice Presidents, who oversee Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, Advancement and University Relations, Administration and Finance, and Enrollment Management. The University is currently led by Interim President Dr. Elizabeth Preston, appointed on November 25th, 2013 by the Board of Trustees following the resignation of previous president Evan S. Dobelle.\n\nThe longest standing forum on campus, the Student Government Association (SGA) consists of a 75 member legislature elected by the student body and an 8-member executive council, which represent each class and residence hall, commuters, WSU’s multicultural community and alumni and work in the interest of academic and social concerns.\n\nA faculty of 222 tenured and tenure-track faculty members in 24 departments serves 4678 undergraduates. Eighty-five percent of the faculty hold terminal degrees in their fields and the student-faculty ratio in the day division is 18 to1. Fifteen percent of the faculty are persons of color.\n\nCurrent statistics provide an interesting view of the student body. According to the registrar, of the 4678 undergraduate students, 51% are women, 49% are men and 2866 students live in 10 residence halls.\n\nFinancial Aid Office statistics for 2009-2010 note that 80% of undergraduates received some type of financial assistance including federal grants and state and institutional aid. Sixty-eight percent received a student loan; 148 scholarships totaling $572,412 were awarded and 342 students earned $458,260 through Federal Work Study. Seventy-seven percent of 2008 graduates secured employment within three months of graduation.\n\nThe WSU Office of Institutional Research reports that of the 1139 first year students who entered day or evening divisions in the fall of 2010, the composite verbal and math SAT score was 1020. Their average high school G.P.A was 3.0. Twenty-five percent of the 2010 freshman class was in the top 25% of their high school class (58% reporting) with 72% in the upper half of their high school class. Seventy-nine percent of first year students from the class of 2009 returned for the fall semester of 2010.\n\nThe university’s Urban Education Program, which functions as the school’s primary recruiter of high school students from diverse educational, linguistic, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, reports that 93% of first-year students served are from Massachusetts, while 37% of them are the first in their family to attend an institution of higher learning and 91% received financial assistance.\n\nAs of fall 2010, 131 faculty members serve 126 undergraduate and 139 graduate students in the Division of Graduate and Continuing Education.\n\nWestfield State employee fall 2010 rosters listed 607 employees, representing 221 faculty members, 197 members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), 145 administrators and 40 non-unit professionals, 15% of whom are persons of color.\n\nAcademics\n\nAccreditation\n\nWestfield State University has received accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc. In addition, its teacher licensure programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Educator Preparation and Quality. The Athletic Training program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE); The Health Fitness program by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) and the Social Work program by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) Its music program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), while the Computer Science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). WSU has also been designated as a Commonwealth of Massachusetts-accredited Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training institution.\n\nMajors and Departments\n\nFull and part-time programs lead to undergraduate bachelor’s and advanced degrees, including: the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science, (B.S.), Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.), Bachelor of Special Education (B.S.E.), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.), and Master of Social Work (M.S.W.).There are 31 undergraduate majors, 34 minors and 43 different concentrations at Westfield State University. New undergraduate majors include Nursing, Athletic Training, Spanish and Ethnic & Gender Studies and the newest graduate degree, a Master of Social Work. The highest enrolled majors are Criminal Justice, Business Management, Education, Psychology and Communication.\n\nThe Honors Program\n\nThe Honors Program is designed to provide academically motivated students with intellectually challenging courses from an interdisciplinary perspective and/or with a specialized topical focus.\n\nHonors classes are limited to 15 to 18 students with coursework that emphasizes greater interaction with classmates and the professor, more writing and discussion, and independent study. The honors experience extends beyond the classroom and often includes attendance at special events, receptions with guest lecturers, field trips to cultural events, participation in conferences, and informal gatherings to provide students with opportunities to socialize and learn. In addition, the university provides designated honors housing\n\nIncoming first-year students with a minimum high school GPA of 3.5 and combined SAT scores of 1150 may be considered for participation in the Honors Program. Other factors that are predictive of academic success may be considered. Transfer students who graduate from a Commonwealth Honors Program at a community college are guaranteed admission to the program.\n\nThe Honors Program at Westfield State University enriches the educational experience of students in the program by promoting intellectual growth and nurturing student-faculty relationships. As part of the Honors Program, WSU students graduate with College Honors or Commonwealth Honors. Along with select honors courses offered each semester, honors students are offered other academic and social opportunities such as priority registration and access to special events both on-campus and off.\n\nThe Honors Center is located in the Honors Department in Mod Hall.\n\nGraduate and Continuing Education\n\nWestfield State University’s Division of Graduate and Continuing Education offers a variety of master’s degrees and graduate certificates. Classes are offered on-campus and/or online. Graduate study, post-baccalaureate teacher licensure, and community education courses are offered; in addition, several certificate programs, including a graduate certificate in homeland security. Classes are offered during the day, evening, one winter session and two summer sessions.\n\nMaster’s are offered in English, Applied Behavior Analysis, Education, Mental Health, School Guidance (Pre-K-8 and 5-12), Public Administration, Accountancy, Criminal Justice and Social Work.\n\nInitial Teacher Licensure Degree Programs are offered in Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education, Special Education Secondary Biology, Secondary Chemistry, Middle School General Science, Secondary and Middle School History and Secondary and Middle School Mathematics, as well as Licensure programs for Reading Specialists and Principals in Elementary, Middle and Secondary Schools.\n\nWSU also has Professional Licensure Degree Programs including those in Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education, Physical Education, Secondary Biology, Middle School General Science, Secondary and Middle School History and Secondary and Middle School Mathematics.\n\nNon-Licensure Degree Programs include Early Childhood Education, Educational Administration, Elementary Education, History, Vocational Education, Secondary Education and Special Education. There is also a Certificate Program of Advanced Graduate Study (C.A.G.S.) in Educational Administration and School Principal Programs.\n\nThe Center for Teacher Education and Research\n\nEstablished in 2004, WSU’s Center for Teacher Education and Research (CENTER), works to further develop the connections between Westfield State University and its K-14 partners. Superintendents, principals and/or teachers, look to the CENTER as a resource for teacher education and professional development. The CENTER is located on the second floor of Juniper Park School. The resource room is open every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.\n\nThe CENTER at Westfield State University recently collaborated with Gateway Regional School District, the lead school district, to acquire a one million dollar grant from the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE). The grant, titled “Memorializing Promise and Conflict: A Monumental History of American Democracy,” is part of the federal Teaching American History (TAH) program which helps area school districts to improve history teaching in grades 7 through 12 with innovative programs and new technology. It is significant to note that The CENTER has successfully directed and implemented TAH programs since 2005, bringing $4 million in TAH funds to the region. This is the fourth TAH grant it has received and administered.\n\nOther CENTER programs include:\n\nScience Grant - MMSP - a federally funded, state-run grant program that provides inquiry-based science professional development in partnership between the Gateway Regional School District, Holyoke Public Schools, Easthampton Public Schools and the CENTER.\n\nFull Release Mentor Training - a program done in collaboration with the New Teacher Center from Santa Cruz. This program works with veteran teachers on the skills necessary to support beginning teachers both in the day-to-day teaching duties and the growth of their teaching skills.\n\nMentor Training - Each summer the CENTER provides foundational training for those teachers who work with beginning teachers in their districts.\n\nOngoing courses and workshops for educators - the CENTER continues to offer a variety of credit and non-credit courses and workshops for principals, teachers, school nurses and central office administrators. These are held as week-long workshops during the summer, full-day and after school workshops during the school year, and some on-line training.\n\nUniversity Support Services\n\nDisability Services\n\nOpened in fall 2010, the Banacos Academic Center is the home to three academic resource programs including Westfield State’s Tutoring Center, Disability Services and the Learning Disabilities Program.\n\nThe University offers a supportive, understanding, academic setting where students with learning difficulties can flourish. A professional learning assistant is assigned to each first-year program student. Learning assistants teach students to master their individual learning strengths and assist students in becoming fully independent learners. The services available include: test accommodations, reader/scribes for examination, individual tutoring, academic advisement, early registration for classes for first-year and second-year students, access to Kurzweil 3000 scanner/readers and other assistive technology. Also provided is professional assistance with academic skills, time management and self-advocacy, note takers for classes, an extended course withdrawal policy and phonic ear assistance.\n\nTRiO Student Support Services Program\n\nThe TRiO Student Support Services Program (SSSP) is a U.S. Department of Education federally funded TRiO program providing ongoing support throughout a Westfield student’s university career. SSSP offers eligible participants free, comprehensive academic and personal support designed to assist with persistence to graduation and preparation for graduate or professional school.
