        "text": "Clash in the Classroom\n\nAccording to the guidance department, females at WHS are more likely to enroll in higher-level English courses and males are more likely to enroll in higher-level math and science courses.\n\nPhysics Teacher Mr. Josh Garodnick said that Physics I is around two-thirds to of three-quarters female. However, it is the opposite in Physics Honors.\n\nGarodnick said: “[That trend] can’t be [happening because] females aren’t good at science.”\n\nHe added that middle school may be where this gender divide starts.\n\nEIS Science Teacher Ms. Kristi Houghtaling said that she doesn’t notice a difference between the two genders in her Gifted and Talented class.\n\nHowever, she said that she thinks girls are less confident in her regular eighth grade science classes because of “the expectation that girls will achieve in science is much lower than [the expectation for] boys [and because] there may be a perception that it is ‘uncool’ to have a true interest in science among the girls.”\n\nFrom Halls to Stalls\n\nIn the survey of WHS students, many reported that the ways in which students interact are largely influenced by the stereotypes associated with gender.\n\nSophomore Andrew Malacrea said that one stereotype is that “women are mostly just good for cooking and cleaning.”\n\nAdditionally, some WHS students reported that females are stereotyped based on their clothes. Said alum Jason Isbit, “Girls who wear revealing or sexy clothing are often considered slutty.”\n\nJunior Samantha Gruskin said, “I always thought that you were supposed to just dress in a manner that respected the school…but [the WHS dress code] is definitely aimed [toward] girls.”\n\nShe added, “Boys don’t get called out on [inappropriate dress] because there’s so much stigma surrounding the way girls dress.”\n\nFurthermore, Farabaugh said that many old stereotypes still hold true, and that “promiscuous girls are still demonized and promiscuous boys are still lauded.”\n\nIn addition to dress, students reported that gender-based stereotypes manifest in arts programs.\n\nSophomore Kaelyn Smith said that some boys “won’t go out for theater or subjects in the arts because they’re afraid of being looked at as ‘gay’ or ‘weird.’”\n\nSome surveyed students said that gender-based stereotypes exist in the physical education program as well. According to Physical Education Teacher Ms. Lindsey Ginex, females participate less when playing a co-ed game than when playing a single-sex game. She added that females are more scared that they will get hurt when playing contact sports with males such as football.\n\nSenior Brittany Fogel reported a stereotype that “girls can’t play sports,” but Ginex said, “I don’t think that boys are better at gym [than girls].”\n\nWHS and Beyond\n\nGender stereotypes follow students not only through high school, but also into college and professional careers. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, in America, there are more females attending college than males; however, according to naviance.com, math- and science-based schools, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have a higher percentage of male students than female students.\n\nFurthermore, according to bls.gov, males make up 75 percent of the employees in computer- and math-based jobs and 86 percent of the employees in architecture- and engineering-based jobs across the nation."
