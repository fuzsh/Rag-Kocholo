        "text": "Middle School\n\nMiddle school is a time of personal growth and discovery. Students have the skills to nurture their academic strengths and interests, exploring complex ideas in all subject areas. Building on previous knowledge and skills, children can apply higher-level thinking to reach beyond the classroom. They analyze and question the world around them, as they prepare for high-school, college and careers. Equipped with a solid moral and academic foundation, students are ready to succeed.\n\nWe're More Than Academics\n\nStrong hearts and minds impact the world in amazing ways. Virtues such as respect, perseverance, compassion, and courage are essential to what kids need to succeed and an essential part of what we teach. We make them part of every school day. This helps students learn the importance of making good decisions and doing the right thing in life. Moral Focus is so integrated into everything we do:\n\nWe created a curriculum specifically around Moral Focus.\n\nWe celebrate a “virtue of the month” every month.\n\nOur students create a class contract where students agree how to treat their teacher and each other.\n\nStudents are recognized and celebrated for how they live out Moral Focus every day.\n\nApply Today\n\nWe can’t wait to share your student’s journey! Apply online, in person, or over the phone and don’t hesitate to ask us questions along the way! We are here for you.\n\nApply Today!"
