During my time there I didn't know how lucky I was. Landmark helped me know how to advocate for myself and my children. I have a son right now who needs help and if I could put him in landmark I would. It's an amazing place to live and go to school. Day student or resident\n\n- Posted by Student/Alumni - Kate\n\n5\n\nBoth of my children graduated from Landmark -1999 and 2003-. My daughter could not say the alphabet when she when she first started Landmark in third grade. She had auditory processing issues (she spoke very little until about three years old) Dyslexia and ADHD. She would have been illiterate 50 years ago. She flourished in the elementary, middle school and high school. She graduated from Westfield State University with a BA in History, Cum Laude. I can't say enough about the support and caring my children and I experienced while they were there.My son has been very successful in his endeavors since graduation from Landmark High School.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Mary\n\n5\n\nLearning in a traditional school system has been a challenge for my child. This became apparent her first day of kindergarten in public school. Over the last four years, my husband and I are thrilled at progress she has made at Landmark. Not only has she learned to read and compute with increasing confidence, but the school has nurtured her self-esteem and confidence to make her an engaged learner. We strongly attribute this to the appropriateness of the language-based program at Landmark, in no small part helped by structure, small class size and dedicated teachers.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Stephanie\n\n5\n\nSchool is doing an excellent job with my daughter who is twelve. This is her second year. Not only are the teachers patient but her advisors and councilors are very caring. Other than the distance from where we live, I have no complaints and would recommend the school highly.\n\n- Posted by Parent - steph\n\nEndorse Landmark Elementary•Middle School. Endorsements should be a few sentences in length.
