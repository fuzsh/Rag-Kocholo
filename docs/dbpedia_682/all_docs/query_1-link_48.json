Relay Graduate School of Education (475033) awards the most degrees in Teacher Education in the US, having also the highest percentage of degrees awarded in Teacher Education, followed by Warner Pacific University Professional and Graduate Studies (480198).\n\nData on the critical and distinctive skills necessary for those working in the Teacher Education field from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Teacher Education majors need many skills, but most especially Speaking. The revealed comparative advantage (RCA) shows that Teacher Education majors need more than the average amount of Management of Material Resources, Social Perceptiveness, Coordination, Service Orientation, Learning Strategies, Negotiation, Management of Personnel Resources, Monitoring, Persuasion, Instructing, Speaking, Time Management, Active Listening, Complex Problem Solving, Reading Comprehension, Systems Evaluation, Critical Thinking, Active Learning, Technology Design, Judgment and Decision Making, Systems Analysis, Writing, Management of Financial Resources, Operations Analysis, Quality Control Analysis, Troubleshooting, Equipment Selection, Mathematics, Operation Monitoring, Science, Programming, Installation, Operation and Control, Equipment Maintenance, and Repairing.\n\nThese two visualizations, one a radial chart and one a bar chart, show the same information, a rating of how necessary the following skills are for Teacher Education majors. Toggle between \"value\" and \"RCA\" to see the absolute rating of that skill (value) and the revealed comparative advantage (RCA), or how much greater or lesser that skill's rating is than the average. The longer the bar or the closer the line comes to the circumference of the circle, the more important that skill is. The importance of Management of Material Resources is very distinctive for majors, but the Speaking, Learning Strategies, Reading Comprehension, Active Listening, Instructing, Monitoring, Writing, Critical Thinking, Active Learning, Social Perceptiveness, Complex Problem Solving, Coordination, Judgment and Decision Making, Time Management, Service Orientation, Persuasion, Negotiation, Management of Personnel Resources, Systems Evaluation, Systems Analysis, Operations Analysis, Mathematics, Management of Material Resources, Science, Quality Control Analysis, Management of Financial Resources, Technology Design, Operation Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Programming, Equipment Selection, Installation, Operation and Control, Equipment Maintenance, and Repairing are the three most important skills for people in the field."
