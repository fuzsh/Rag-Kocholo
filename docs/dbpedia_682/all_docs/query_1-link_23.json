        "text": "If you live within a school's priority area, you will be considered for a place at that school before children who live outside the priority area.\n\nPriority areas are determined by administrative parishes. Your parish will also be identified on your council tax bill.\n\nHow priority areas are used\n\nList of secondary school priority areas\n\nHow priority areas are used\n\nPriority areas are used by schools that use our admission rules. Some foundation schools and academies also use our rules and priority areas to prioritise applications.\n\nYour child is not guaranteed a place at a school in your priority area but they will be considered before children living outside the priority area.\n\nWithin each priority area, children who apply to their nearest school will be considered under Rule 4. \"Nearest school\" in this context means their nearest Hertfordshire maintained school or academy which is:\n\nnon-faith\n\nco-educational (accepts boys and girls)\n\nnon-partially selective (doesn't offer places based on academic ability).\n\nList of secondary school priority areas\n\nFind a school's admission rules\n\nSingle sex schools – priority areas\n\nThere are 7 single sex schools in Hertfordshire. All are academies and are responsible for their own admissions, although we allocate places on their behalf.\n\nAll use single sex priority areas and most will use parish proportionality (rules based on the size of the parish).\n\nSingle sex girls' schools – priority areas\n\nFind a school's admission rules\n\nSingle sex boys' schools – priority areas\n\nBoys' schoolVillages, towns and parishes\n\nHitchin Boys' School\n\nCodicote, Graveley, Hexton, Hitchin, Holwell, Ickleford, King’s Walden, Knebworth, Langley, Letchworth, Lilley, Offley, Pirton, Preston, St Ippolyts, St Pauls Walden, Weston, Wymondley.\n\nVerulam School\n\nAldenham, Colney Heath, Harpenden, Kimpton, London Colney, Redbourn, Sandridge, Shenley, St. Albans, St Michael, St Stephen, Wheathampstead.\n\nRichard Hale School\n\nBayford, Bengeo Rural, Bramfield, Brickendon Liberty, Datchworth, Essendon, Great Amwell, Great Munden, Hertford, Hertford Heath, Hertingfordbury, Hunsdon, Little Berkhamsted, Little Munden, Sacombe, Stanstead Abbotts, Stanstead St Margarets, Stapleford, Tewin, Thundridge, Ware, Wareside, Watton-at-Stone, Welwyn, Widford, Woolmer Green.\n\nFind a school's admission rules\n\nParish proportionality rules in single sex schools\n\nAfter a school offers places under higher admissions rules (for example, children looked after or siblings), they work out how many places are left to offer under the parish proportionality rules.\n\nEach parish in a priority area is allocated a number of places. That number is worked out as follows:\n\nWe count the number of applicants living in each parish in the priority area. These are all on time applications and include children qualifying under higher rules.\n\nThe number of applications in each parish in the priority area is then divided by the total number of applications from the whole priority area.\n\nPlaces are then allocated within each parish:\n\nfirst to children where it is their nearest school\n\nthen on a random basis (if there are any places left). Every school preference is given an individual random number between 1 and 1 million. If a preference is for a single sex school, this number will be used for this random allocation.\n\nHitchin Boys' School and Hitchin Girls' School use slightly different rules to the above.\n\nMore about the single sex allocation process (PDF 224KB)\n\nFind a school's admission rules"
