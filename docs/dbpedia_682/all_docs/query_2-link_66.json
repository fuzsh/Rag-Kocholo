        "text": "Westfield, city, Hampden county, southwestern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies along the Westfield River just west of Springfield. Originally part of Springfield, it was the site of the western frontier trading post (1660) of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was incorporated as a separate town in 1669. Farming gave way to light industry in the 19th century, and the manufacture of whips and lashes was important until the automobile replaced the horse.\n\nThe city’s manufactures now include electronic equipment and paper products; education, health care, and tourism also provide income. Westfield State University was founded as a state normal (teacher-training) school in 1838, and it was the first public coeducational normal school in the United States. Art and historical exhibits are combined in the city library at the Westfield Athenæum (1864). Dewey House (c. 1735) is the museum and headquarters of the area historical society. Inc. city, 1920. Pop. (2000) 40,072; (2010) 41,094."
