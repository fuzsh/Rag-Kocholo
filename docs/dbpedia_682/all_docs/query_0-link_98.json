        "text": "A Message from Dr. Katie Jenner\n\nWhen hearing from educators, parents, families, and students, one thing that is top of mind is how we might make the four years of high school as valuable as possible–with the goal to support students in lighting their unique fire of purpose, knowing their value, and understanding the possibilities for their life ahead. Our K-12 schools play a key role in helping to launch students towards a successful future, including offering more streamlined pathways (especially during the 11th and 12th grade years) to help them pursue their unique hopes and dreams.\n\nOver the past few years, we have seen more and more high schools and local career centers forging partnerships with business and industry, as well as higher education, to connect students to their future next steps. This connection is increasingly providing some sort of credential of value (i.e., market-driven industry certification, the Indiana College Core, etc.), as well as increasing access to experiential learning (e.g. work-based learning). Combined, this allows students to have greater access to:\n\nIncrease their level of educational attainment;\n\nHone their skill development in a work-based learning setting;\n\nConnect with a broader network of people (who they may not have otherwise had the opportunity to know); and\n\nGain career experience that will help inform their path ahead…whether they discover they want to consider exploring something different, or they find that they love it!\n\nHearing from you, we have many success stories around the state, including some that I’ve highlighted in the past and more to come. We also undoubtedly have challenges and barriers that we must continue to work together to overcome.\n\nSo, as we step on the gas to rethink the high school experience for Indiana students, we want to continue hearing from you. Through this survey in particular, we hope to learn more about the good work happening in schools and communities across Indiana with regard to work-based learning opportunities, as well as how we as a state can continue to support these efforts. This optional survey is designed for district- and school-level administrators and staff familiar with work-based learning activities (superintendents, principals, CTE directors, work-based learning coordinators, school counselors, other administrators, etc.).\n\nWe know this is a busy time of year, and we really appreciate your feedback! Thank you in advance for taking a moment to complete the survey, and as always, thank you for all that you do for Indiana students!\n\nReminders for the Class of 2024\n\nArmed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) Graduation Pathway Requirements\n\nPursuant to Indiana Code (IC) 20-32-4-1.5, the Indiana State Board of Education (SBOE) established the use of the ASVAB to meet graduation pathway requirements. Beginning with the 2025 graduation cohort, HEA 1635 requires students electing to use the ASVAB as a means for meeting graduation pathway requirements to also fill out the Military Enlistment Intent Form. Students graduating in the 2023 and 2024 cohorts who have earned a qualifying ASVAB score, as determined by SBOE, prior to July 1, 2023, will be able to utilize previously earned ASVAB scores without a signed Military Enlistment Intent Form to fulfill their graduation pathway requirements. Learn more here. Contact IDOE's Student Pathways team with any questions.\n\nGraduation Waiver Caps\n\nAs outlined in Indiana Code (IC) 20-26-13-10, for purposes of calculating the 2024 graduation rate, Indiana schools may not count more than 9% of their graduation cohort as graduating if utilizing postsecondary ready competency waivers. Schools exceeding the 9% cap will receive an adjusted state graduation rate. Postsecondary ready competency graduation waivers will be capped at 6% for the 2025 cohort and 3% for the 2026 cohort and beyond. In December, schools received a letter with their 2023 graduation rates along their post-secondary competency waiver rates. The letter provided a breakdown of how the 9% cap would impact their graduation rate, which should be considered when helping the class of 2024 meet their graduation requirements. Contact IDOE's Office of Student Pathways and Opportunities with questions regarding postsecondary ready competency qualifications, or Office of Accountability with questions regarding the calculation of the graduation rate or the cohort report.\n\nOffice of Student Assessment\n\nNEW: IREAD-3 Spring 2024 Final Student Results Now Available\n\nStudent results for the IREAD-3 Spring 2024 test administration are now finalized within the Centralized Reporting System (CRS), and Individual Student Reports (ISRs) may be downloaded and provided to families. Pass percentages (and other aggregated data) will be released publicly following the summer retest. Internal aggregate scores (e.g., total percent of students who passed) should not be shared publicly (e.g., on school websites) until IDOE releases the data following the summer retest. Review this guidance and resources for providing interventions and early summer school opportunities to support early literacy efforts. Contact IDOE’s Office of Student Assessment with any questions.\n\nNEW: WIDA ACCESS Initial Results Release\n\nWIDA ACCESS electronic reports and data files are available in WIDA AMS today, Friday, April 26. Printed reports will arrive in corporations on Tuesday, May 21. Data discrepancies identified and corrected by corporations and schools during pre-reporting data validation are reflected in the initial results. Review and share results in a timely manner.\n\nAs a reminder, WIDA Alternate ACCESS results are delayed due to standard setting of the new assessment this summer. Electronic reports and data files will be available in WIDA AMS on Wednesday, September 11. Printed reports will arrive in corporations and schools by Thursday, September 26. Contact IDOE’s Office of Student Assessment with any questions.\n\nNEW: Naturalization Examination Requirements\n\nPursuant to Indiana Code (IC) 20-30-5-7(d), students must take the naturalization examination from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) during the student’s high school U.S. government course.

The 2024 application is now open through Monday, September 2. Learn about the requirements and apply here. Contact Lily Brown with any questions.\n\nOffice of Educator Licensing\n\nREMINDER: LVIS360 Update\n\nEducators applying for initial licenses or renewals in the next few months should log in to the updated LVIS360 system soon to link their LVIS legacy licensure data to their LVIS360 account. The new system requires users to create an Access Indiana account prior to accessing LVIS360. The Office of Educator Licensing recommends getting acquainted with the new login process and linking your new LVIS360 login to your legacy account now before the busy season for licensing starts in May. Administrators, please encourage your teachers to log in soon. Access the user portal here. Submit questions here.\n\nOffice of Educator Preparation\n\nREMINDER: Annual Principal Survey Regarding Initial Educator License Holders\n\nIndiana Code (IC) 20-28-11.5-9 requires principals at each school corporation, charter school, and virtual school, to complete an annual survey that provides information regarding the principal's assessment of the quality of instruction by each particular teacher preparation program located in Indiana for teachers employed at the school who initially received their teaching license in Indiana in the previous two years. A survey is not required for those who completed an out-of-state program for initial licensure. The 2024 survey can be accessed here, select “Complete the Survey,” and then enter the access code provided earlier this week. Summary results will be shared with educator preparation programs for program improvement, and summary data without names will be posted here. Contact Scott Bogan with any questions.\n\nOffice of Educator Talent\n\nREMINDER: Early Literacy Endorsement 80 Hours of Professional Development Requirement\n\nInformation regarding how educators with an existing prekindergarten through grade six or special education license can obtain the 80 hours of professional development required to add the Early Literacy Endorsement can be found here.

Schools and districts that would like additional support should register for the Indiana Literacy Cadre by Wednesday, May 1. Please see this memo for more details. Contact IDOE’s Literacy Center with questions.\n\nREMINDER: Nominations Open for Distinguished Educators Recognition\n\nIDOE’s Office of Educator Talent is looking for confidential recommendations of teachers representing the very best educators in Indiana.

Contact the Office of Educator Talent with any questions.\n\nOffice of the General Counsel\n\nNEW: State Guidance for Indiana Schools Regarding New Federal Title IX Regulations\n\nLast Friday, the federal government sent out a nearly 1,600-page unofficial version of the final Title IX regulations to be implemented in August 2024. IDOE is currently working with legal counsel to review these new regulations, which among other things expands the definition of “sex” in Title IX. At initial review, these draft regulations will undoubtedly have major implications for Indiana schools and students and will likely be subject to legal challenges. Therefore, we are advising schools not to change their existing policies.\n\nOffice of Information Technology\n\nREMINDER: Final Week for 2024 School Tech Plan Survey Submissions\n\nThe 2024 School Tech Plan Survey will close on Friday, May 3.

While the McKinney-Vento Act provides educational protections for students experiencing homelessness, including specific transportation requirements, transportation remains one of the biggest unmet needs for students experiencing homelessness. ARP-HCY provides an opportunity to meet transportation needs through more flexible uses of funding, including vehicle purchases.

As of Friday, April 5, 28.0% of the class of 2024 had completed the FAFSA, and of the total 31,624 students who have submitted the FAFSA, 6,710 will need updates and/or corrections. While this represents a 27.9% decrease compared to last year, Indiana ranks first in the nation for closing the gap compared to last year. While CHE will not extend the Monday, April 15, priority deadline, state aid will be awarded to all Hoosiers who filed by Monday, April 15, and qualify based on their FAFSA. After that, CHE will award state aid on a first-come, first-serve basis if funds remain. Schools should continue to encourage students and families to file after Monday, April 15. See this announcement for additional FAFSA updates. CHE’s Outreach Coordinators are available to assist students, families, and school or community partners with FSA ID creation, FAFSA filing/corrections, and appeals.

While voluntary, school corporations and charter schools are encouraged to develop financial forecasts to project revenues, expenditures, and cash balances beyond the life of ESSER in order to measure your school or district’s ESSER cliff and inform current management decisions.
