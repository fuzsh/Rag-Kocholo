        "text": "“Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn ‘em to ashes, then burn the ashes.”\n\nThat chant, about a fictional state that burns its books, is from Ray Bradbury’s 1953 sci-fi classic “Fahrenheit 451.”\n\nEvery year, thousands of New Jersey's teenagers read the chant and the book as part of their school reading list. And its message about the life-giving power of free speech and debate was never more relevant than today, as school districts grapple with calls to ban books during a period of unprecedented cultural and political shifts, and as a small minority of parents, no longer willing to leave curricula to the “experts,\" run for school board elections to have a say in the matter.\n\nBut what books do high schoolers enjoy, or dislike? And how have secondary school reading lists changed in response to a changing New Jersey, where the odds that two people selected at random belong to two or more different racial groups, also called the diversity index, increased to 65.8% in 2020 from 58.4% in 2010, according to the U.S. census. More than a fourth of students in the state are Latino, and one in 20 is Asian, according to the UCLA Civil Rights Project.\n\nThrough social media, NorthJersey.com asked a few local students what they think about the books they're required to read. Possibly because curriculum and books have been the subject of controversy at schools, most of the districts contacted for this story did not provide access to their students, and the responses below include this reporter's children. They were hardly a scientific survey but taken together they suggest that local students gravitate to characters and settings that reflect their own experience, but they don't shy away from controversial, complicated topics set in eras and cultures unlike their own.\n\nMaplewood ninth grader Molly Graham said she appreciated the premise of \"Fahrenheit 451,\" but not the book. Despite its message, she could not relate to the dystopian future it envisions where a firefighter tasked with the job of burning books begins to question his role.\n\n“A lot of the books we read [for school] have like, very important messages, but some of them can be a little boring and old,” Graham said.\n\nBut Fahrenheit 451’s “apocalyptic world” made an impression on Jayanth Mammen, a college freshman at the University of Pennsylvania who read it in high school. “What you do remember is everything that they did wrong. Firefighters who represent good and safety had the job of burning books – it teaches you that you should take knowledge in every way it is given to you.\n\n“It teaches you the power of a government controlling people by controlling what knowledge they have, and the power of having your own knowledge and informing yourself, which right now is a very pressing need,” Mammen said.\n\n“The Outsiders” and “Uglies,” young adult novels with young characters, worked better for Maplewood's Graham. \"Uglies,\" about a dystopian society that divides people into pretties and uglies, was much more relatable, she said. “The characters were like, my age,” said Graham.\n\n\"Uglies,\" a 2005 sci-fi novel by Scott Westerfeld, connected because \"a lot of society talks about how people look,\" Graham said. \"Though a lot of the characters weren’t actually ugly, society just made them feel like they were.”\n\nReading lists, created as much to broaden student horizons as to teach language and literature, also change regularly. Though some staples have remained, including Shakespeare and Greek poetry, other, newer offerings such as the novels of Nobel-winning African American writer Toni Morrison, which discuss race and sexual violence, have been the subject of recent bans.\n\nIn February, a CBS poll showed that most Americans, regardless of political persuasion, do not support book bans. Yet calls for censorship in schools have shot up recently, with 1,648 titles being pulled from school libraries and curricula between June 2021 and July 2022, according to PEN America, a 100-year-old organization dedicated to preserving freedoms of speech and letters.\n\nThe move to ban books in American schools in 2021 is unprecedented in recent memory. Though public school book bans have recurred throughout American history, the recent trend is comparable only to \"flare-ups in the McCarthy era and the early 1980s,\" according to PEN.\n\nMost of these dealt with LGBTQ+ themes, race or racism, and contained sexual content, the group said in a report published in September. And 40% of the calls to ban books came from new or proposed laws, elected officials and organized groups.\n\nIn New Jersey three books faced bans in the Sparta Township, Lower Township and Westfield school districts according to PEN America; Texas and Florida topped the list with between 501 and 1000 book bans. PEN America defines bans as any action from a community that leads to limited access to books.\n\nTeachers have also struggled with what appears to be a lag in student interest in reading after the pandemic. “In most teachers’ minds reading lists are an opportunity to share, to invite students on a journey of learning and hopefully self-growth through a shared experience,” said Garfield High School English teacher Rob Barbier.\n\n“Teachers in the last two years are facing previously unseen challenges with getting students to read,” and some students were showing a drop in 'ability and interest' in engaging with books 'on both the literal and imaginative level,' \" he said.\n\nThe city of Passaic school district decided to inspire better student engagement by revamping reading lists to emphasize cultural representation for its diverse and majority Spanish-speaking student population. The school district redesigned its middle school English language arts curriculum in 2021 using a “windows and mirrors” approach to select books and texts, said Denise Martinez, supervisor of ELA for grades six through 12.\n\nThe idea drove the district’s vision for teaching English by reflecting “students’ lived experiences and current events,” and honoring “languages and cultures from around the world.” This approach was key for a student body that is 93.6% Hispanic, said Martinez, though she pointed out that the basic goal of any curriculum is to support all students, regardless of background. African American students make up 3.8% of the school population, 1.8% are Asians, and 0.6% are white.\n\nFall from grace:9 takeaways from our series on Instagram influencer Jay Mazini\n\nMartinez, a New Jersey native of Cuban origin, said she went to school in Paterson but doesn’t remember “reading a book about a Latin person or seeing Latin representation.\" She said she did not have that exposure. \"So, it's really important for my students now in the district to see books or characters that look like them and sound like them and different cultures,” she said.\n\nMartinez began her career as a teacher in Jersey City’s public schools and remembers her school principal encouraging staff to bring in books that the majority African American student body could connect with. That was in 2008. Fast-forward to 2016 at Passaic, when Martinez got permission to teach “The Pearl,” a Mexican novella by John Steinbeck, to her mostly Hispanic students. In 2021, following an infusion of COVID-relief money, the district began revamping curricula for math and English in middle school and the district’s three high schools.\n\n“Choosing literature that's diverse is so important for students so they can see themselves through different cultures and different literature,” said Martinez. Despite a majority Hispanic student group, Martinez said she was very proud that teachers in the district's STEM-focused high school wanted to take into account a large number of Indian students. “In the Science Academy we have a very large population of Indian students and our teachers said that we need to have literature that represents them too. So that's a priority,” said Martinez.\n\nThe district “windows and mirrors” approach still includes classic novels that encompass great works in American and English literature – such as \"Lord of the Flies,\" \"The Great Gatsby,\" \"A Raisin in the Sun\" and \"Of Mice and Men.\" Books from Latin American culture in the new curriculum include \"Summer of the Mariposas\" and \"The House on Mango Street.\"\n\nBut it also seeks balance by studying \"Macbeth\" in one marking period and \"The Kite Runner,\" a modern novel set in Afghanistan, for the next. The school also offers electives, such as Gothic Literature, for students who enjoy Frankenstein and Dracula.\n\nNJ's new education requirement:'What is true?': Gov. Murphy signs information literacy education law\n\nAnother way of finding balance is by selecting reading material based on themes that describe the human experience. Themes like “The Weight of Love”, \"Victim or Victor\" and “Persistence and Struggle” can sweep in novels and plays from around the world, Martinez said.\n\nPassaic teaches Shakespeare’s \"Romeo and Juliet\" under its \"weight of love\" theme, along with books from other cultures. The struggle of unrequited love, or love that may not be accepted by families, is universal, said Martinez, adding. \"200 years ago or 20 years ago, you see that every single day.\"\n\nShakespeare’s Elizabethan English from the 16th century spoke volumes more to 10th grader Emma-Lee Montalbano from Garfield High School than did Mark Twain’s 1800s Americana.\n\n“I think that Shakespeare’s wording, even though it's older, is still pretty easy to follow because there are still some crossovers in modern English. When you understand all the little undertones and everything, it's very fun. It’s interesting, you want to see who’s going to end up getting together.”\n\nAs for Twain’s Huckleberry Finn? “It was really hard to read because of its older Southern English.”\n\nVictoria Walatek, a junior at Bergen County Academies, enjoyed the graphic memoir, “I Was Their American Dream,” a coming-of-age story set against an immigrant backdrop. Walatek was able to relate to it as an immigrant child who fits in, but also sometimes doesn’t. The book was about people who are “too Americanized for their culture, but they’re too different for basic American culture – I can relate to that because I am Polish,” she said.\n\nTwo other New Jersey high schoolers each said that of all the books they read, they loved the late Toni Morrison’s novels the most. Morrison's books have been banned 16 times in 13 school districts, including once in Yorktown Heights, New York, in the last year, according to PEN America.\n\nMorrison's “The Bluest Eye,” and “Beloved” are among the nation’s most banned books, ostensibly for being too violent and explicit. The bans sprung from a cultural backlash that began during the pandemic in 2020 and continues, following heightened attention nationwide to incidents of discrimination by race and sexuality.\n\nBut for Watchung Hills Regional High School sophomore Nirali Mammen, \"Bluest Eye\" was also eye-opening; thorny at first but eventually rich. She said she did not understand the conflicts in the book at first, but grew to love it as she continued reading and analyzing it in class. It was \"subtle,\" because all the events in the book, including a rape, \"help its central theme.\"\n\n“It gave me a different perspective on racism because it told the story through the eyes of a child. It brought in characters from different situations that were all limited because of their race,\" said Mammen.\n\n“Beloved,\" resonated with college freshman Francesco Petrosillo, who graduated from West Milford High School. The book was “enticing” and “mysterious,” he said, “while exploring the concept of manhood, pain, and the scar of slavery on American history.”\n\nPetrosillo had fewer kind words for Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" another American classic praised for its evocation of teen angst.\n\nCaulfield, he said, “was overly pessimistic and his nihilism came off as just being whiny.” Henry David Thoreau's 1854 book \"Walden,\" about his sojourn in the woods where he went to experience simple yet deliberate living and \"to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\" also did not sit well with Petrosillo. \"I hated Walden because Thoreau's transcendentalism just seemed self-righteous,\" he said.\n\nAnother book deemed controversial for sexual violence and Islamophobia-fueled concerns that it would foster terrorism and promote Islam, is \"The Kite Runner,\" Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel about a friendship between two boys of different social classes set in Afghanistan. It was banned in school districts in Florida, Texas, Idaho, Mississippi, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nBut turns out, it is popular among teens in New Jersey.\n\n\"When I asked teachers their students' favorite novel from the current curriculum, the overwhelming response was 'The Kite Runner,'\" said Martinez.\n\nThough set in a foreign country and culture and around themes that include sex trafficking, child rape and the trauma of war, teachers said it was their favorite novel to teach eighth and ninth graders in Passaic, and the most interesting to their students.\n\n“I really enjoyed it, it was one of the few that I did enjoy,” said Elvira Garcia, a senior at Passaic High School. Garcia, who remembers reading \"The Kite Runner\" in ninth grade, said she was emotionally invested in the book from the start.\n\n“I connected with Amir,” the book's protagonist, she said. “It goes to show just how much other books that we read skip over the hardest parts of what happens during war. It’s not just about the fight, it’s about how innocent children and people really suffer.”\n\nThe book faced challenges because of how far it went, said Garcia. “ It’s so controversial,” she said. “But the parts that are controversial are the parts that are supposed to be talked about.”"
