        "text": "Amy Urbanski has lived in Westfield long enough to see cornfields leveled to build residential neighborhoods.\n\nAs Urbanski raises her family in the city about 20 miles north of Indianapolis, all three of her children will go through the school system, which is working to keep up with that same growth Urbanski has watched over the years.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools is running up against the clock as more and more families, like Urbanski’s, have children reach school age or move to the area.\n\nAnticipating the increase, the school district has unveiled a new plan to address growth over the next decade as population projections predict more children will pour into its schools.\n\nMore:Rebecca Coffman began her career in a Zionsville classroom. Now she's the superintendent\n\nUnder the initial plan, released by the district Thursday, WWS will build two new schools and reevaluate its remaining schools.\n\nHere's what to know about the plans.\n\nWhat is Destination Westfield?\n\nDestination Westfield is the name of Westfield Washington's growth and vision plan, the district announced on Jan. 26.\n\nThe plan unveiled how the district will address the student population boom, including building new schools and eventually \"rebalancing\" students by moving some from one school to another.\n\nThe biggest shift comes for Westfield's future fifth and sixth graders. Currently, students in those grades attend Westfield Intermediate School and move to Westfield Middle school for seventh and eighth grade.\n\nBut under the district's plan, fifth grade students will join kindergarten through fourth grade in elementary school buildings while sixth grade students move up to middle school.\n\n\"We only want to do that at one time and we'll do that when the middle school is ready,\" Westfield Superintendent Paul Kaiser said.\n\nWhere will Westfield Washington build new schools?\n\nAs of now, the district plans to build a new, seventh elementary school at 171st Street and Towne Rd and a new, second middle school at Centennial Road and State Road 32.\n\nMore:Westfield Washington Schools eyes parcel of land for future middle school\n\nThe expansion plan will also convert Westfield Intermediate School, 17710 Shamrock Blvd., into an eighth elementary school.\n\nThe district's concept plan shows mockups of school buildings, parking lots and athletics fields on the parcel of land at the northeast corner of Centennial Road and State Road 32.\n\nAt this location, the district has the option of building a ninth elementary school if they need it in future years, Kaiser said.\n\nWhen does Westfield Washington plan to open new schools?\n\nWestfield Washington has yet to release a timeline for proposed projects. Brian Tomamichel, assistant superintendent for business for the district, said a calendar will become more clear in the next six months.\n\nHowever, if nothing goes awry, the district hopes to have the plan reach completion by the 2027-28 school year, Tomamichel said.\n\nSome pieces to the expansion, including whether Shamrock Springs Elementary will be rebuilt or renovated, remain under discussion.\n\nConstruction on both schools is set for next school year. Kaiser said it takes 18 to 24 months to build an elementary school and nearly three years to build a middle school, depending on availability of materials.\n\n\"I don't think what we want to do is say 2025-26 and then be off by a year,\" Tomamichel said. \"We're trying to be careful on that end.\"\n\nWhy is Westfield Washington expanding?\n\nTotal enrollment has steadily increased over the last 20 years for Westfield Washington, and the growth shows no signs of slowing down, district projections reveal.\n\nDistrict enrollment projections show more than 1,000 students will join Westfield Washington in the next four years. And, given that this school year outpaced the projections, the district may see even higher growth than anticipated, Tomamichel said.\n\nFor fifth through eighth graders, intermediate and middle schools are nearing capacity, making those grades a priority for more space, Kaiser and Tomamichel said.\n\nThe school district will specifically keep an eye on fifth grade capacity numbers because it's the closest to capacity, Kaiser said.\n\nHow fast is the City of Westfield growing population and is it rising?\n\nIn 2021, the City of Westfield was the fastest-growing community in the state, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau by the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University.\n\nThe Hamilton County city gained more than 3,600 residents, more than double the second fastest growing city in the state, Fort Wayne. Overall, Westfield grew by 7%.\n\nAccording to 2020 Census results, Westfield had a population of about 46,000 residents.\n\nMore:Westfield was fastest growing community in Indiana in 2021, IU analysis finds\n\nWhat's changing for students in this growth plan?\n\nAs little as possible, Kaiser and Tomamichel said.\n\n\"The research says that the less transitions kids have the better,\" Kaiser said.\n\nTeachers have also expressed support for the plan, Kaiser said.\n\n\"Hearing what our teachers feel is best for kids, they have the educational experience and they were loud and clear that they thought fifth grade belonged in elementary school,\" he said.\n\nDown the line, Westfield Washington will also go through reassignments to redistribute students equally to new campuses. They hope to go through the process only once to avoid any disruptions to student careers, Kaiser said.\n\nAs a parent of three children, Tomamichel said he feels this move will lessen worries of young students, like his third-grade daughter.\n\nInstead of switching schools three times — once from elementary to intermediate than intermediate to middle and then high school — students will only switch twice.\n\n\"I can tell you from a parent's perspective, like I look forward to that for my kids to have just one less transition one less anxiety filled year,\" Tomamichel said.\n\nHow much will expansions cost?\n\nThe school district has yet to put out a ballpark figure for proposed expansion projects. Tomamichel said they will have more of an idea in several months.\n\nBut Westfield Washington does not expect to need a capital referendum and the projects will not impact the tax rate as new residents buy or build homes and home values continue to rise in the city, he said.\n\n\"We'll be looking at doing this within the bounds of our kind of normal operating budget that were allowed by the state,\" Tomamichel said.\n\nWhat do parents think about this?\n\nParents, like Urbanski said Westfield Washington is being proactive about the growth plan, even in its infancy. But others wish it had come sooner.\n\nUrbanski said she support fewer transitions and less disruptions for her third grader, first grader and youngest child who attends Westfield Washington Schools daycare. The change also comes at just the right time, she said.\n\n\"I think the timing is spot on,\" Urbanski said. \"I don't think anybody could have correctly forecasted this growth.\"\n\nMatt McNally, of Westfield, said he would have preferred if the district had started the process years ago but he's glad it's happening. McNally, the father of Westfield High School students, said the district is often transparent about decisions, which he appreciates.\n\nTomamichel said he expects some parents to say it should have happened sooner, and admits the district could have started a few years ago, but there were a number of things to work through to get to this point.\n\nIndyStar archives contributed to this report.\n\nRachel Fradette is a suburban education reporter at IndyStar.
