These are versatile tools! They can be used to send follow up thank you notes after visits, passed around during presentations to show your hometown, and given out as souvenirs. They are so easy to pack and are inexpensive.\n\nGo to the Sportti Divari for second hand skis and skates early in the winter.\n\nThis has been the easiest and most superior travel experience that I have encountered. I use all the travel apps such as HSL, Linkki, Perile, and VR. Air travel has also been quite easy.

The benefits are countless. There is much to say about my Fulbright experience. I have been impacted both professionally and personally. I am eager to share what I have learned in Finland with educators from all over the United States. I believe my research will give teachers a renewed sense of vigor for designing meaningful learning opportunities that prepare students for life beyond the classroom walls. Due to the support I have gained in Finland, my Fulbright project will thrive well past my program dates.
