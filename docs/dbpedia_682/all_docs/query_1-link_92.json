        "text": "1894\n\nWORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF MERCERS\n\nThe Company had been contemplating the foundation of a school for girls ‘of the highest type, splendidly endowed and equipped’ since February 1872. In that month, Lord Lyttelton, Commissioner for Endowed Schools, approached the Company and asked them to divert some of John Colet’s endowment towards the project. Around 1509, John Colet, the Dean of St Paul’s, had used part of his fortune towards the foundation of the boys’ school.\n\n1 Sep 1927\n\nMISS ETHEL STRUDWICK\n\nMiss Ethel Strudwick was appointed High Mistress. She had read Classics at Bedford College, London and been Headmistress of the City of London School for Girls since 1913. During her time as High Mistress she continued to teach, as much as half a timetable. She is remembered for leading the school through the great challenges of the Second World War.\n\n19 Jan 1954\n\nGOLDEN JUBILEE BANQUET\n\nOn the Saturday before the school’s birthday on 19 January, there was a service at St Paul’s Cathedral attended by over 2,000. It was followed by a banquet at the Connaught Rooms which more than 800 Old Paulinas attended.\n\n1 Jan 1964\n\nMRS ALISON MUNRO\n\nMrs Alison Munro was appointed as High Mistress. She is the first Old Paulina to hold this post. She read PPE at St Hilda’s College, Oxford and then pursued a career in the civil service, culminating in being Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation by 1958. Under her leadership, a substantial programme of development began in 1971. She was appointed CBE in 1964 and DBE in 1985.\n\n1 Sep 1974\n\nMRS HEATHER BRIGSTOKE\n\nMrs Heather Brigstocke, made Baroness in 1990, was appointed High Mistress. After reading Classics at Girton College, Cambridge and teaching in London and Washington, she was Headmistress of Francis Holland, Regent’s Park, before becoming High Mistress. Her long term in office saw many innovations, including the Friday lectures, Economics A level, the Head Girl Team and the first new building (the Theatre block in 1985) since 1933.\n\n1 Apr 1992\n\nMISS JANET GOUGH\n\nMiss Janet Gough was appointed High Mistress. Miss Gough studied English at Cambridge and is best known for being the only High Mistress to have started as a teacher at St Paul’s. A gifted teacher, she had taught a generation of Paulinas and served as the school’s first Director of Studies and the second Surmistress (the Deputy Head’s previous title) before her appointment. Developments during her time included the Bursary Scheme and the opening of the Mercers’ Building in January 1994. Each morning she would greet students on the Marble.\n\n1 Sep 1998\n\nMISS ELIZABETH DIGGORY\n\nMiss Elizabeth Diggory was appointed High Mistress. After studying History at Westfield College, London, Miss Diggory became headmistress of St Albans High School for Girls and of Manchester High School for Girls. During her calm and orderly years at St Paul’s, she orchestrated an extraordinary building programme where the theatre block doubled in size, the Sports Hall was completed, the art department extended and the old gym turned into a Senior School centre. Miss Diggory also presided over the great celebrations of the Centenary in 2004.\n\n2004\n\nCENTENARY\n\nSt Paul’s Centenary saw a host of celebrations. The hundredth anniversary on 19 January 2004 included a lecture from the school’s historian and the opening of the archive display and the Old Paulina art exhibition. Parents were able to attend all lessons and the day ended with a party for Paulinas in the Sports Hall, enlivened by acrobats and with teachers acting as waiters. A Community Open Day on 1 July was held between two splendid summer parties, one for Old Paulinas and one for parents. There were also concerts in St John’s Smith Square and the Sports Hall. The summer concert marked by the premiere of Julian Grant’s opera The Prevailing Tree and the royal visit the next day added a touch of glamour to a memorable year.\n\n1 Sep 2006\n\nMS CLARISSA FARR\n\nMs Clarissa Farr was appointed High Mistress. Studying English at Exeter University, Ms Farr soon became Headmistress of Queenswood School before her appointment at St Paul’s. Amongst the achievements of her eleven years were the introduction of A level Drama and, for the departing VIII (Year 13), Valediction. A gifted public speaker and lover of the theatre, Ms Farr added a touch of drama to her assemblies, and she was the first High Mistress to direct her own play; Aphra Behn’s The Rover. Ms Farr undertook ambitious building projects; including the enhancement of the entrance of the school (in accordance with the original 1904 designs) and the Garden Building.\n\n11 Apr 2015\n\nALUMNAE BOAT RACE SUCCESS\n\nBoth the men’s and women’s Oxford and Cambridge Boat Races were held on the same day and course for the first time since the event’s inception. Former Paulinas Maxie Scheske (rower and Oxford Women’s Boat Club President) and Jennifer Ehr (coxswain) were on the winning Oxford team on this historic occasion.\n\n1 Sep 2017\n\nMRS SARAH FLETCHER\n\nMrs Sarah Fletcher was appointed High Mistress, a leading educationalist committed to high academic achievement, diversity and inclusion. After reading History at New College, Oxford, Mrs Fletcher taught in a wide range of schools – state, maintained, single-sex and co-educational. Before her appointment as High Mistress she served as head of Kingston Grammar School and the City of London School for Boys. Since 2017, she has overseen the opening of the Garden Building and the new Pavilion, established a partnership scheme with other schools, guided St Paul’s through the great crisis of the COVID pandemic and begun a major development of the Colet Library and the Rosalind Franklin Design and Technology Centre.\n\n18 Mar 2020\n\nTEMPORARY CLOSURE\n\nThe school closed for the second time in its history, owing to the COVID-19 outbreak. The first such closure was on 3 September 1939 to escape wartime London. The school reopened in September 2020 with new health and safety measures."
