        "text": "If you bring your child to school, please do not drop off your child at school before the doors open. No supervision is provided.\n\nArrival and Dismissal of Students\n\nBefore/After School\n\nPlease drop your students off at the designated doorway. Do NOT park your car and walk your child into the building. This is a safety concern as you and your child may be walking across moving traffic.\n\nPlease park in a single file line and pull up to the next car as far as possible to allow more cars in line.\n\nStudents should exit vehicles only on the side of the sidewalk. Do not walk around cars.\n\nDrivers should stay in vehicles.\n\nPlease leave only when the car in front of you has moved forward. Do NOT pull around the car in front of you as children could run between the cars unseen.\n\nPlease do NOT leave unattended cars in the drop-off line so that traffic can move freely. If you find it necessary to park and leave your vehicle, please find a designated parking space in the lot.\n\nAfter School\n\nAll students are to leave school at their designated time. No student should be in the building unless participating in an activity supervised by a teacher or parent/guardian. If a student is to stay for such an activity, a note must be sent to the classroom teacher and the bus driver must be notified that the child will not be riding the bus home. Children without such notes will follow their usual dismissal procedure.\n\nParents/Guardians meeting students finished with after-school activities should follow the dismissal procedure set up by each club.\n\nPlanned Early Dismissal\n\nIf it is necessary for a student to leave school during the school day, a written note stating the reason for this absence must be presented to the teacher at the beginning of the school day. These notes are forwarded to the school office so an early dismissal slip may be completed.\n\nParents/Guardians must come to the school office to pick up students for these early dismissals. NO parent/guardian will go to the classroom for student dismissals. The office staff will call the classroom for the student to be dismissed to the office. Students should report back to the school office if they return the same day so a re-admit slip may be issued.\n\nIf an unexpected situation arises and a parent/guardian needs to make special dismissal arrangements with a student, they may call the school office and speak to an office staff member. The office must be called no later than 1:00 p.m. to complete such special arrangements. Please do not leave special dismissal messages on teachers’ voicemail or email.\n\nVehicle Idling\n\nDrivers of all public and private vehicles are to turn off the engine if the vehicle is to be stopped more than five (5) minutes in locations where vehicle exhaust may be drawn into the building or while on school grounds.\n\nEmergency School Delay/Cancellation/Dismissal\n\nThe cancellation or late beginning of school will be broadcast via the best method available. Parents will also be contacted through School Messenger, our emergency contact system. Parents are encouraged to keep phone contacts updated in PowerSchool. Please do not call the superintendent’s office or school office to ask about the closing of school.\n\nCertain situations may require releasing students from school before the end of the day or relocating them from one school building to another. If students are released early or relocated, the school district will notify parents by providing information via School Messenger. Information will also be available on the school corporation website and through social media channels.\n\nIf there is an emergency school closing during school hours, it is imperative that your child knows exactly what he/she is supposed to do.\n\nExample 1: If your child is to go home he/she would always have a key or know where one is kept.\n\nExample 2: If your child is not to go home he/she must know where he/she is supposed to go.\n\nExample 3: If your child attends BAC, please make sure that he/she knows to attend BAC as normal.\n\nIf you transport your child to and from school, please make arrangements with someone who will always be able to pick him/her up.\n\nEmergency closing arrangement information on each student is requested from each parent/guardian the first week of school. Please keep this and other emergency information up to date during the school year in PowerSchool.\n\nIf a bus driver or other school person believes a child may be harmed by releasing him or her from a bus or school, and the parent or guardian is not present, alternative arrangements may be made. The parent or guardian will pay any cost for these services.\n\nSchool Visitors\n\nA SafeVisitor background check will be required for anyone who visits our schools and will spend unsupervised time with any student, including family members of our students. Examples of activities in the schools where visitors will need a completed SafeVisitor background check are listed below:\n\nLunch Guests\n\nClassroom Parties\n\nClassroom Volunteers/Helpers/Room Parents\n\nField Trip Chaperones\n\nExamples of activities that will not require a formal background check are listed below (these visitors will still follow normal school check-in procedures):\n\nClassroom Guest Speakers\n\nParent/Teacher Conferences/Case Conferences\n\nSpecial Events (Grandparent’s Day/Famous Hoosiers/etc.)\n\nSchool Programs\n\nVisiting school office area or dropping off items at the school\n\nBackground checks are good for four years at any school in the district. These background checks will cost $12.95 (additional fees may apply) and can be acquired via the link below.\n\nPlease note - this process could take 3 to 6 business days. Once approved, please be on the lookout for a badge notification email from “info@safevisitorsolutions.com.” Your badge will be attached as a PDF. You can either print it, save it on your phone, or download the SafeVisitor app. A photo will be required and added upon your first visit to the school.\n\nWeb address for SafeVisitor process:\n\nhttps://secure.safevisitorsolutions.com/Safe/Volunteer/003471/volunteer\n\nYou can find more information at www.wws.k12.in.us/Page/1474\n\nAccident Insurance for School-Aged Children\n\nStudent accident insurance is an inexpensive type of insurance that should be considered as a supplement to your regular insurance plan since it is very limited in scope. This insurance is made available as a courtesy to you and is not sponsored by the school.\n\nThe school carries no coverage on your child and can make no payments to cover medical costs. The insurance plan offered covers accidents that require medical attention that happen at school and on the bus. An application can be completed on the district website under Parents/Important Documents.\n\nBirthdays\n\nWe recognize that birthdays are a special time. We will acknowledge students’ birthdays. However, as a result of our district’s Wellness Policy, we have changed our procedures for celebrating student birthdays at the classroom level. Please do not send in or bring in food treats, flowers, balloons, etc. Each elementary school will have its own guidelines for celebrating birthdays. Guidelines will be explained through “Meet the Teacher” nights and newsletters. No birthday party invitations may be distributed to students during the school day.\n\nClassroom Assignment\n\nMany factors are taken into consideration when determining class assignments. The teachers, assistant principal, counselor, and principal work together to plan for the grouping of students for the upcoming school year. We try to balance the number of boys and girls in each class. Consideration is also given to ability levels, compatibility, special needs, learning styles, and teaching styles.\n\nContacting a Teacher\n\nIf you need to contact a teacher, please contact the teacher directly through Talking Points, email, or voicemail. Your call will be returned as soon as possible. Staff can also be reached by email. Staff email addresses are listed on the school’s website under Staff Directory.\n\nCurricular Materials and Student Fees\n\nThe Indiana Department of Education covers the cost of curricular materials for students. Parents will be invoiced for student fees, covering consumable and perishable items in a student’s classes. Full payment or a payment plan should be completed by the end of the first six weeks of school.\n\nIf a student's schedule changes during the year, fees may be adjusted based on the new classes. The parent may incur an additional cost or be due a credit.If a credit is on the account, a refund will be issued by the end of June.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools requires all unpaid fees not on a payment plan to be sent to a collection agency by the end of the school year. Any account turned over to collections will have an additional $10.00 fee added to its outstanding balance.\n\nIf a student is withdrawn from school, the parent will receive a prorated refund for any consumable items that have not been used. However, many consumable materials used in classes lose their value once they have been used for any part of a class.\n\nStudent fees are established annually and approved by the Board of School Trustees. Payment is collected at the district level. Payment can be made at the administration building with cash, check, credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Discover), or by completing a payment contract. Payment can also be made online through the PowerSchool interface. Payments made via credit card will be subject to credit card fees.\n\nDesks/Books/School Property\n\nThe Board of School Trustees authorizes the principal or his/her designee to examine school desks and their contents when deemed appropriate. Students are expected to properly care for all school property including desks, library books, textbooks, technology, etc. If a student destroys or loses school property he/she and his/her parents/guardians are responsible for the replacement cost of the lost or destroyed property.\n\nStudents are also expected to respect the property of their classmates and teachers.\n\nElectronic Devices\n\nStudents are prohibited from using a “wireless communication device” (as defined by Indiana law) during “instructional time” (as defined by Indiana law). Teachers may allow students to use a wireless communication device for educational purposes during instructional time. However, teachers must obtain authorization from the administration before permitting this. Students are permitted to use a wireless communication device: (1) in the event of an emergency; (2) to manage a student's health care; (3) if included in a student’s IEP; (4) if included in the student’s plan developed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (5) if otherwise required by law. If you or your child decides to send such devices, understand that the school is not liable for any loss or damage to the device. All devices should be clearly labeled with the owner's name.\n\nNo cell phones or smart watches of any form are to be used during the school day including drop off and pick up. If these devices are brought to school, cell phones should be kept in their backpack or bag in their cubby. Smartwatches may be worn but not used to text or communicate during the school day. If a student has continuous reminders to follow this rule, they will be asked to give them to the teacher and at the end of the day it will be returned. If there are continued violations the device may be confiscated and kept in the office and the parent will be required to pick it up. We ask that parents do not text their children during the day; you can contact the office for any questions or concerns. Pictures and videos are not to be taken without prior approval from a teacher or staff member. Students are not to post to social media while on school property, including inside and outside the school building, athletic fields, and school buses.\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act\n\nWestfield Washington Schools must comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act. Information regarding out-of-school suspensions and/or expulsions will remain part of each student’s permanent record that begins in kindergarten and concludes when a student graduates, transfers outside the district, or is expelled. Information about in-school suspensions or punishments by individual teachers, such as an after-school detention, is not part of the permanent record. These records will not appear on transcripts of grades that colleges receive. This information will be shared with other schools only when the student transfers. For more information, contact the Director of Student Services at 317-867-8006.\n\nField Trips\n\nEach grade level plans field trips that relate directly to the curriculum being studied. A fee is assessed for admission and transportation costs. When space allows, there may be opportunities for parents/guardians to chaperone on field trips. All parents/guardians serving as chaperones must complete the Safe Visitor background check as described above in the “School Visitor” section. For safety and supervision reasons, younger siblings are not permitted to attend field trips.\n\nIt is School Board policy that all children going on field trips have a signed permission slip. These forms must be signed by the parent/guardian and returned by the day of the trip. *A student without proof of proper immunizations is considered in violation of IC 20-34-4-5 students will not be allowed to attend field trips and/or extracurricular activities until immunization records are up to date and on file with the school nurse.\n\nLost and Found\n\nArticles found in and around the school should be turned in to the lost and found box. Owners may claim their property by identifying it. Please check with the school office if your child loses an item at school. Many valuable items go unclaimed each year. Periodically, unclaimed items are given to charity.\n\nMessages to Students and Teachers\n\nIf a parent/guardian wishes to get a message to a student or teacher during school hours, he/she may call the teacher’s voicemail or send an email. If the message is about a dismissal change, please call the school office by 1:00 p.m.to be sure that the message is received rather than calling the classroom teacher. A complete telephone directory is available online. Students and teachers are not called to the telephone except in emergency situations. It is preferred that Parents/Guardians should be sure that pick-up arrangements for after-school activities are finalized in the morning so the use of a telephone is not necessary. Teachers are with students throughout the day and may not be able to return your message promptly.\n\nMoney\n\nChildren should not carry money to school unless there is a specific purpose for it. The school is not responsible for the loss of money.\n\nSchool Messenger\n\nSchool Messenger is the WWS electronic parent/guardian notification system. Emergency notifications, weather delays, closings, student documentation, general building information and district information are sent via voice messaging, text messages and email notification to the phone numbers and email addresses provided. Email is generally used for non-emergency situations (i.e. weekly newsletters or district announcements). For an emergency or immediate activity, the system calls the parents/guardians’ listed number and sends a text to the cell phone number provided. Please be sure to keep accurate email addresses and phone numbers in PowerSchool. Parents/guardians can update their email and phone number by notifying the front desk of their child’s school.\n\nTalkingPoints\n\nWestfield Washington Schools uses TalkingPoints as a multilingual communication tool between teachers and families. Families can choose to receive messages via SMS text messaging or through the free FAMILIES/TalkingPoints mobile app for Apple or Android. To ensure messages are received from your child’s teachers, make sure your contact information for the “Father” and “Mother” fields in PowerSchool are correct. When a teacher sends a message, TalkingPoints will automatically use these two phone numbers. If you would like to add additional contacts, please reach out to your child’s teachers.\n\nTechnology Guidelines (Policy 13000-03)\n\nThe use of technology (this policy includes, but is not limited to): telephones, cellular devices, digital media players, tablets, laptop and desktop computers and workstations, direct radio communication, Internet access, voice mail, e-mail, text messaging, direct messaging through device applications, facsimile transmission and receipt, artificial intelligence, including\n\nlanguage-generation tools and large language models, and any computer based research and/or communication) is a privilege. Abuse or misuse of the equipment, policies, or rules will lead to a loss of privileges or disciplinary action by school administration. Students and their parents/guardians are responsible for the cost of repair or the cost of replacement of any damage incurred either by vandalism or carelessness. All technology use is governed by the Responsible Use of Technology and Internet Use Policy (A300).\n\nStudent owned personal devices and Corporation technology shall be used by students under teacher supervision with the purpose of improving instruction and student learning. A copy of the Policy and Parental Consent form is available in PowerSchool.\n\nSchool Meal Assistance\n\nFinancial assistance is available to parents who complete a Household Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals form and qualify for assistance. The forms are available during registration, online or at the administration building. The form completed must be for the current school year. A child is eligible if the total household income and the amount and source of income received by each household member fall within federal guidelines for Free/Reduced Meals.\n\nTobacco Products\n\nSmoking and tobacco use are prohibited in and on school grounds. Tobacco and nicotine-based products and look-a-like products such as electronic cigarettes are specifically prohibited by Indiana Statute and Westfield Washington Schools. Tobacco includes, but is not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, nicotine, nicotine delivering devices, chemicals, or devices that produce the same flavor or physical effect of nicotine substances; and any other tobacco or nicotine innovations. Violations will result in serious consequences as outlined in the due process section of this handbook.\n\nToys\n\nAll toys should be left at home unless a note is received from your child’s teacher allowing toys to be brought to school. Toys games and/or cards brought to school without such permission may be kept by the teacher or school office until a parent/guardian picks them up.\n\nSports equipment for recess may be brought to school only after the classroom teacher approves it. Any equipment brought in must be labeled with the child’s name, and the child must plan to share the equipment with the other students. The equipment must remain in the backpack, cubby, cabinet, or locker during the rest of the day. The school is not responsible for any lost or misplaced toys.\n\nVolunteers\n\nVolunteers are welcomed and always needed in our school. Those volunteers who work directly with students or supervise a group of students on a field trip must complete the SafeVisitor background check. Please see the section on School Visitors in this handbook.\n\nHealth Clinic\n\nThe health clinic is staffed by a Registered Nurse provided by Riverview Health and licensed to practice nursing by the State of Indiana. The health clinic is provided to take care of illness and injuries that occur during the school day. Please update your student’s medical information by logging onto PowerSchool found under PARENTS on your school building website. Every school year you will need to verify, update and date the online form. This form is used to provide care for your child, provide information to emergency services, if needed, and allow the school nurse permission to administer the listed school provided over the counter medications.\n\nHealth Conditions and/or Emergency Medical Needs & Procedures\n\nIf your child has a health condition (e.g. diabetes, asthma, severe food allergy, seizures) that requires the use of medication, emergency treatment, or a medical procedure during the school day, please contact the school nurse. An individual health care plan or emergency care plan for school and/or school sponsored events will need to be completed by the school nurse. All procedures including administration of prescription medication, and emergency treatment plans must have a medical order that is completed annually or as needed to ensure up-to-date information.\n\nVision & Hearing\n\nVision and hearing screenings will be conducted for students in designated grades as mandated by the State of Indiana. If appropriate, parents/guardians will be notified if a student is in need of professional consultation following a screening. Hearing Screenings are performed by the district Speech and Language Pathologists. School nurses and local optometrists/ophthalmologists perform the vision screening tests.\n\nReports to Child Protective Services (Policy A225)\n\nAs a school district, we are under duty by State Law to submit a report of any suspected child abuse or neglect to the Indiana Department of Child Services who handle all investigations. Such a report is made directly to the Department of Child Services and they handle the investigation.\n\nIllness/Injuries at School\n\nTo help your student focus on their studies and classroom work we ask that all known illnesses or injuries be treated at home prior to arriving at school. If a student becomes ill or seriously injured at school and requires special medical attention, the following steps shall be taken:\n\nFirst aid will be given as appropriate.\n\nThe principal, school nurse, or volunteer health aide will be notified and the student will be sent to the health clinic for medical attention.\n\nIf the student is not able to continue the school day due to a medical illness or injury, the parent/guardian will be contacted:\n\nIf contact cannot be made with the parent or guardian at the first report of an illness or injury, the school may send the child home with the person whom the parent/guardian has indicated. Please remember to keep all emergency contact information current in PowerSchool by updating home, cell, and work phone numbers, as well as, the names and phone numbers of friends and/or relatives who can be reached if the parent/guardian is not available.\n\nIf a parent/guardian has no means of getting the child home, the school may send the child home in accordance with the parent’s request.\n\nIf a parent or guardian cannot be contacted and there is serious injury or illness, the school may secure the services of emergency medical services or any person previously designated in writing by the parent/guardian. The school assumes no responsibility for the emergency services or fees.\n\nAll school personnel should be informed (on a need to know basis) of children who have special health problems that may require special attention when an injury or illness occurs (hemophilia, diabetes, epilepsy, allergies, etc.). It is the parent’s/guardian’s responsibility to inform school personnel of any health problems and update information on a yearly basis or as needed.\n\nAll personal injury accidents that require special medical attention occurring at school, on the way to or from school, or at related activities are to be reported in writing using the Incident Report Form.\n\nThe Incident Report Form will be completed as soon as possible.\n\nOne copy of the Incident Report Form will be retained in the health clinic and one filed within three (3) days of the incident at Westfield Washington Schools Central Office.\n\nStudents who are ill may visit the clinic with a pass provided by the teacher. A daily log is kept of students’ reasons for visiting the clinic and the treatment provided.\n\nExclusion from School\n\nA child with a contagious illness, disease or fever should not be sent to school. Please specify on the school attendance line if your child is absent due to a fever, contagious disease, or chronic illness.\n\nDistrict exclusion criteria states students are to be excluded from school for one or more of the following medical conditions or at the school nurse’s discretion.\n\nFever—documented temperature of 100° F or above. Your child must be fever free (less than 100° F) for at least 1 full school day after being sent home with a fever. After the full day they may return to school once they are fever free (<100˚F) without using fever reducing medication.\n\nAny rash and fever combined—the student should remain home until fever free for at least 1 full school day and until fever free (<100˚F) without using fever reducing medication.\n\nAll red or pink eyes with pus or drainage present should be evaluated by a physician.

If this is a result of a medical condition, please provide a medical note to your school nurse.\n\nIDOH Communicable Diseases Reference Guide—The guidelines set forth by IC 20-34-3-9 and Indiana Department of Health Current Communicable Diseases Reference Guide for School Personnel is followed by the district in determining exclusions, restrictions, and control measures for students and their illnesses. Due to outbreaks of communicable diseases during the school year, revisions to the reference guide for school personnel may occur after publication and may not be included in this handbook.\n\nSchool Required Immunizations\n\nPer IC 20-34-4, schools shall require the parent/guardian of a student who is enrolled in the school to furnish a current copy of your students’ immunization record to the school nurse before the first day of school; unless a current copy is on file with the school.\n\nSpecific vaccine information can be found on the district website under Parents, Health Services or contact your school nurse.\n\nIndiana State Law allows these exceptions: (IC 20-34-4-5): Medical exemption statement written by a physician or religious objection written by parent/guardian that list which immunizations are objected. Exceptions must be re-signed each year by the first day of school.\n\nImmunizations for the underinsured and uninsured are available through the Hamilton County Health Department, call 776-8500 for additional information.\n\nAdministration of Medication at School\n\nAdministration of Medication at School (Policy 10000-30)—For your child’s safety, all medication needed during school hours or at school functions that are supervised by school staff, will be administered by the nurse, administrator, or trained designated staff in the health clinic. All medication permission forms are good for only the current school year and must be completed each year.\n\nSchool Provided Medications\n\nThese medications will only be given to students who have a current parent/guardian signed Medical Information page of the Demographic page in PowerSchool.\n\nTransportation of Medication\n\nBy Indiana State Law-all medication, both prescription and non-prescription, must be transported to and from the health clinic by a parent or guardian. This includes over the counter medications. All medications brought to the school by a student will be held in the health clinic until proper written permission has been obtained. No medication will be given without proper written permission.\n\nStudents are not permitted to have any medication or drugs in their possession, exception see Emergency Medication information below.\n\nStorage of Medication\n\nAll medication, prescription and non-prescription, must be in the original container and stored in the health clinic.\n\nAll prescription medication must be in a prescription bottle with a current label including the name of the student, name of the medication, correct dosage, and when to administer medication. All prescription medication requires a medical order from a physician to the school nurse with specific time to be given and dose at school.\n\nAll non-prescription medication (over the counter) must be in the original container with the student’s name written on the label.\n\nParents/guardians may provide the clinic medication inventory for up to a 30-school day supply of medication or if less than 30 days left in the school year the maximum number of remaining school days.\n\nParent/Guardian Permission to Give Medication at School\n\nIf a non-prescription medication request is for a dose greater than that listed on the label, a signed physician’s medical order is required.\n\nPrescription medication must have a physician medical order indicating time and dose to be given during the school day to the nurse prior to administering any medication; this includes emergency medication, daily medications, and as needed medication.\n\nAll medication that can be given prior to and after school should be given at home.\n\nTo Stop a Medication or Change Dose\n\nParents/Guardians should notify the school nurse by phone or provide a written note to stop the medication if it is no longer needed at school.\n\nIf a prescription dose is to be changed, it will require an updated medical order from your physician to the nurse.\n\nAll medication must be picked up by the parent/guardian by the last day of school. Any medication left in the health clinic after the last day of school will be properly disposed of.\n\nAll discontinued medication must be picked up from the health clinic within 1 week of notification.\n\nEmergency Medication and Self-Administered Medications\n\nStudents with a disease or medical condition may carry and self-administer medication for the chronic disease or medical condition when they have an authorization form on file with the school nurse. The authorization must be completed by the physician and state the following:\n\nthe student has a disease or medical condition for which the medication is prescribed,\n\nthe student has been instructed on how to self-administer the medication, and\n\nthe disease or medical condition requires emergency administration of the medication.\n\nContact the school nurse for a copy of the authorization form.\n\nHomeopathic medication, over the counter herbs, minerals, essential oils, vitamins, and other non-FDA approved medications: Requests to administer these products by parent/guardian at school will not be honored, as there is no standardization, no FDA approval, and no guidelines regarding safety of these products.\n\nBody Safety Programs\n\nIn July 2018, the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation that expands the grade levels for body safety education in schools to grades Kindergarten through Grade 12. (Previously the law required education in grades 2-5). Each school corporation shall make available for inspection to a parent all of the instructional material used in connection with instruction on human sexuality. Prior to a school providing instruction on human sexuality, the school must provide a written request for consent of instruction from an emancipated student or a student’s parent(s). This allows the parent or emancipated student to opt out of the instruction.\n\nHead Lice\n\nParents/Guardians have the prime responsibility of assisting in the prevention and management of head lice cases through regular checks of their child’s hair and starting immediate treatment when head lice are detected.\n\nWhile head lice are a nuisance, they do not spread disease and are not a health issue. Should a case of head lice be brought to the school’s attention, the school nurse will maintain confidentiality at school, verify presence of an active infestation, and bring it to the child’s parent’s/guardian’s attention. Parents/Guardians, students and school staff will be educated about head lice identification, treatment and prevention.\n\nIf at all possible, students should not be excluded from school for having head lice as the management of head lice should not disrupt the educational process of the child. The need to exclude students from school will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe policy is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Nurses, and the Hamilton County Health Department.\n\neLearning\n\neLearning days are held in place of cancellation days which would need to be made up later, often in June, by adding days onto the end of the school calendar. When these make-up days are at the end of the school year they do not reflect the learning that was needed at the time of the day off. WWS eLearning days allow students to continue to make educational progress. This is especially important when faced with high stakes tests (ILEARN, AP, IREAD-3, etc.) which have fixed testing dates regardless of the number of cancellation days.\n\nSchool cancellation days will be eLearning Days unless otherwise communicated.\n\nAll classroom work will be posted by 10:00 AM on the day of the cancellation. K-4 students will find their work posted on Google Classroom and have a designated window to complete the work. 5-12 students will find their work on Canvas and have two school days to complete. For those students who do not have device or internet access, school lab hours will be posted. In addition, WWS partners with local businesses to provide students the opportunity to use WiFi during operating hours of the business.\n\nTeachers will check email during the school day to provide students with instruction and technical support. A tech hotline is also available to support students and parents as issues arise.\n\nAttendance will be determined by students logging in and engaging in their classwork over the duration of the eLearning period.\n\nLists of Frequently Asked Questions, staff office hours, Westfield WiFi Partners, and other information can be found on each school's website under the Parents tab.\n\nThe above protocols are for eLearning days due to inclement weather or other short-term or emergency situations. Should we need to move to eLearning for an extended period of time, such as the situation with COVID-19, guidance specific to the situation will be communicated.\n\nGrade Reporting to Parents/Guardians\n\nStudents in kindergarten and grades one and two receive a standards-based report card showing the progression of skill development (+, o, -) on state and local curriculum standards (+=Achieved the skill, o=Ongoing-working to achieve the skill, and -=Skill not yet achieved). S, N, or U are assigned in special area subjects. (S=Satisfactory, N=Needs Improvement, U=Unsatisfactory)\n\nStudents in grades three and four receive letter grades each trimester in academic subjects. S, N, or U are assigned in non-academic and special areas.\n\nThe grading scale is as follows:\n\nA\n\n=\n\n93%-100%\n\nA-\n\n=\n\n90%-92%\n\nB+\n\n=\n\n87%-89%\n\nB\n\n=\n\n83%-86%\n\nB-\n\n=\n\n80%-82%\n\nC+\n\n=\n\n77%-79%\n\nC\n\n=\n\n73%-76%\n\nC-\n\n=\n\n70%-72%\n\nD+\n\n=\n\n67%-69%\n\nD\n\n=\n\n63%-66%\n\nD-\n\n=\n\n60%-62%\n\nF\n\n=\n\n59% & below\n\nThroughout the trimesters, parents/guardians should check their child’s progress in PowerSchool and talk to their child about their social, emotional and academic progress. If you feel that a conference to discuss your child’s progress is needed, please call your child’s teacher.\n\nHigh Ability\n\nWestfield’s high ability services fall under a range of K-12 services in the RtI (Response to Instruction) process. Official identification occurs in late spring for grades K, 2, and 6, with additional qualifications in 8th grade for specific high ability courses at Westfield High School. Early services include flexible grouping, differentiation, and enrichment within the classroom and grade level. Middle and upper services include acceleration and honors/AP/ACP courses. Students may qualify in language arts and/or math. For more information, contact your child’s principal or the Assistant Superintendent - Curriculum & Instruction at, 317-867-8009.\n\nIREAD-3, ILEARN Remediation & Preventive Remediation Opportunities/Title I\n\nState law requires that all 3rd grade students must pass IREAD-3, be granted a Good Cause exemption, or receive intentional reading remediation at the 3rd grade level to be promoted to 4th grade. Classes and study groups are organized to remediate or to help prevent later remediation on the basis of IREAD-3, ILEARN achievement and NWEA predictors of achievement on ILEARN. These classes and groups may run during school, before or after school as well as during the summer as appropriate.\n\nThe Board considers it very important that parents/guardians be consulted and informed at the earliest possible date when student participation in IREAD-3 and/or ILEARN Remediation and Preventive Remediation classes/groups is recommended.\n\nStudents who are at risk of not meeting IREAD-3, NWEA, or ILEARN standards in language arts/and or math may also participate in activities funded by Title I in those schools which receive federal funding.\n\nKindergarten Entrance\n\nAs referenced in Policy C100, any child meeting the age requirement who is a resident of Washington Township, Hamilton County is eligible to register. A child must be five years old on or before August 1 to be eligible to enter kindergarten and must be six years of age before August 1 to be eligible to enter the first grade.\n\nIf, in the opinion of the Superintendent of Schools or his designated agent, any parent/guardian has attempted to gain entrance of his or her child or children to the Westfield Washington Schools by circumventing the age date, the Superintendent or his agent may deny entrance to that child for the school year in question. The decision of the Superintendent is final.\n\nParent/Guardian Teacher Conferences\n\nFormal parent/guardian teacher conferences for students in grades K-4 will be held during the fall. At any time during the school year a parent/guardian may call to set up a conference with a teacher. A teacher or staff member may also request a conference with the parent/guardian.\n\nRelease of Directory and Student Records/Privacy Act Information (Policy E175)\n\nAs referenced in Policy E175 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), sensitive information about students is kept confidential. FERPA defines \"directory information\" as information contained in the education records of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as student’s name, address, parents’/guardians’ names, major field of study, sex, age, date of birth, grade level and school, school or activity photo, honors and awards, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, and enrollment status. The law specifies, however, that certain non-sensitive “Directory Information” may be released for any purpose at the discretion of the school corporation, with general notification of such intent. Notification may consist of published policies such as this one.\n\nThe permission has been divided into two categories: Print and Electronic. Print publications include the yearbook or student newspaper, printed programs for extracurricular activities, news releases to the local media, district publications, and interviews with local news media. Electronic mediums (internet and broadcast) such as district website, district videos, podcasts, and interviews with local news media for broadcast such as TV or radio.\n\nYou have the right to request the withholding of any or all directory information. Please consider very carefully your decision to withhold any of the above information. This information is typically used in news stories about our students’ achievements and classroom activities, honor roll lists, the yearbook, and school directories and school/district newsletters. Should you deny permission for the release of information, any future requests for such information from news media and other individuals will be refused for the duration of the school year.\n\nTo request withholding of information, please notify your child’s school in writing within 14 days of the start of school or within 14 days of enrolling your students.\n\nDuring a student’s career, the school system collects and records data concerning the student. The school system recognizes that the collection, maintenance, and limited dissemination of such data is essential in school operations, but also that preserving the rights of privacy of the student and parents/guardians, and the student’s or parent’s/guardian’s right to correct inaccurate data is equally essential.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-7-3 a school corporation or other entity to which the education records privacy provisions of the federal Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g) apply may disclose or report on the education records of a child, including personally identifiable information contained in the education records, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, under the following conditions:\n\nThe disclosure or reporting of education records is to a state or local juvenile justice agency.\n\nThe disclosure or reporting relates to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve, before adjudication, the student whose records are being released.\n\nThe juvenile justice agency receiving the information certifies, in writing, to the entity providing the information that the agency or individual receiving the information has agreed not to disclose it to a third party, other than another juvenile justice agency, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian.\n\nFor purposes of subsection two (2), a disclosure or reporting of education records concerning a child who has been adjudicated as a delinquent child shall be treated as related to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve the child before adjudication if the juvenile justice agency seeking the information provides sufficient information to enable the keeper of the education records to determine that the juvenile justice agency seeks the information in order to identify and intervene with the child as a juvenile at risk of delinquency rather than to obtain information solely related to supervision of the child as an adjudicated delinquent child.\n\nAs referenced in Policy E175 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), personally identifiable information about students is kept confidential. Parents and eligible students (a student who has reached 18 years of age) have the right to:\n\n(i) inspect and review the student’s education records at reasonable times within 45 days of the day a school receives a request to access records;\n\n(ii) seek amendment of the student’s education records believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights;\n\n(iii) provide written consent before the school discloses the student’s education records, except to the extent FERPA authorizes disclosures without consent; and\n\n(iv) file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, Family Policy Compliance Office, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington D.C. 20202, concerning alleged failures by the district to comply with the requirements of FERPA.\n\nCertain persons may examine student records without a parent’s consent. These include school officials, who have “legitimate educational interests.” A school official is a person employed by the school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the school board. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the school who performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of personally identifiable information from education records, such as a software or technology service provider, an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; or a parent, student, or other volunteer assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n\nA parent or eligible student may view his/her student’s records by making a request in writing to the building principal. Any request for amendment of education records by requesting an informal conference with the Superintendent or designee.\n\nSpecial Education Services\n\nWWS accommodates the unique needs of students in special education ages 3-22 years of age in the students least restrictive environment, which means inclusion in a general education classroom as frequently as possible (case conference committee determination). Teachers use a common framework for education, but regularly—and creatively—adapt their instruction to accommodate the needs of the individual student. WWS is a single district planning corporation as it relates to special education services.\n\nDevelopmental Preschool Program (Child Find/Evaluation and Eligibility for special services): This program is for children ages 3-5 who qualify for special education services and is held at the Virginia F. Wood Early Learning Center. Each student who qualifies is evaluated by our Early Childhood Assessment Team.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools also offers Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech and Language Therapy to students that qualify under an area of eligibility listed within Indiana Article 7.\n\nReporting Absences\n\nParents/Guardians are required to notify the school office when a student is absent. Please phone the attendance line by 9:30 a.m. on the day of the student’s absence. Please give your name, your child’s name, your child’s teacher’s name, reason for absence, and request make-up work at this time. Make-up work may be picked up in the office after 2:30 p.m. This should be done each day the student is absent. Failure to inform the school could result in the child’s absence being counted as truant. A doctor’s excuse may be requested after the third consecutive day of absence. A change of status regarding an absence can occur only after a conference with the principal.\n\nMake-Up Work\n\nClasswork and assignments are essential to the learning process. All work missed due to absence (excused, unexcused, or truancy) is expected to be completed. A student shall have one day to make up work for each day of absence. This guideline may be altered at the discretion of the principal and the teacher if it is determined that it is unreasonable for the student to complete all missing work within the allotted time. This guideline may also be altered for unexcused prearranged absences, such as vacations, in order for the learning process to remain as uninterrupted as possible. Students should utilize Canvas first to see the work they missed while they are out, completing what is possible to be completed if physically able. Lengthy absences may require that the teacher provide schoolwork alternatives and timeframes for completion. In such cases, the teacher will notify the student and the principal. Teachers will strive to ensure the alternative assignments assist the student in achieving course learning targets and set a reasonable timeframe for the completion of the work.\n\nIC 20-33-2 requires children to attend school during the time it is in session until the child graduates or becomes 18 years of age. We know that good attendance and high achievement are related. Student attendance at school is expected in order that learning within the classroom can occur. Because regular attendance is expected of our students, vacation taken during a school term is considered an absence.\n\nAbsences and early dismissals from school are defined as any non-presence during part or all of a scheduled school day that is not canceled or altered due to weather or other emergency. Tardiness is a form of absence that will be factored into consequences employed by the school.\n\nExcused Absences\n\nGuardians are urged to call the school to report the absence as soon as possible, preferably before 9:30 a.m. on the day of the absence. The following are considered by state statute to be excused absences:\n\nStudent illness\n\nDeath/grave illness of an immediate family member\n\nExclusion because of exposure to contagious disease\n\nRequired religious observation\n\nMedical, dental, or professional appointments\n\nSchool sanctioned activities\n\nOther educational activity\n\nOther Educational Activity\n\nOther educational activity is defined as any other absence, approved by the building principal, resulting from an educational activity that is relevant to the child’s academic growth and equivalent to the child’s school activities/experiences. Such absence requires a written request submitted to the principal at least 30 calendar days in advance if the event is known or should have been known prior thereto. Upon the student’s return to school, he or she must make-up missed work and submit a report to the principal about the WWS curriculum-relevant learning that took place during the absence. The principal shall have discretion to rescind prior approval of the excused absence status if the reporting is deemed insufficient. Principals will consider the proposed absence based on factors that include but may not be limited to: the timeliness and quality of the parent’s/guardian’s written request, the student’s prior attendance record, the student’s academic standing, the nature of the proposed activity, and school curriculum/activities that the student would miss during the proposed other educational activity.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-2-14, -15, -16, -17, students supplying the proper notification to the school office and participating in the following events are not counted absent:\n\nPage or honoree in the Indiana General Assembly;\n\nAny required court appearance for which they are subpoenaed;\n\nHelp to a political candidate, a political party or to a precinct election board ON ELECTION DAY; or\n\nNational Guard duty (maximum 10 days).\n\nParents/Guardians must notify the school with physician documentation when circumstances of prolonged student illness occur. This will assist the principal in employing this policy’s parent/guardian notice and intervention provisions.\n\nExcessive Absences\n\nA student that has excessive absences may be withdrawn from classes.\n\nTarget Group 1: Students with Excessive Absences\n\nExcused absences not included in school procedures:\n\nReligious holidays\n\nDeath in the immediate family\n\nCourt appearances, jury duty\n\nServing as a page for the State Legislature\n\nCollege visitation – High School\n\nDriver license examination – High School\n\nImmigration, passports\n\nStep 1: When a student misses 7 days of school (vacation or illness, no doctor’s notes provided), the parent, student, school administration, and counselor will communicate to discuss the student’s attendance at school. Documentation of the meeting will be kept in the school file.\n\nStep 2: When the student misses 10 days from school (vacation or illness, no doctor’s note provided), a Letter of Incapacity and a Physician’s Certificate, which requires a doctor’s note for any further absences, will be mailed to parent by certified mail.\n\nStep 3: When the student misses 12 days of school (vacation or illness, no doctor’s note provided), the student and parent are referred to the school administrative team. The school administration will complete the school referral .attendance form.\n\nStep 4: School administration will review Indiana Law on school attendance and educational neglect, define excused and unexcused absences, and discuss the consequences of further absences from school. If appropriate, the child will be referred to the Westfield Youth Assistance Program to assist the student and parent in correcting his/her school attendance issues.\n\nStep 5: If students in grades 1-6 are still missing school, educational neglect charges will be filed. If students in grades 7-12 are still missing school, truancy charges will be filed and a pick up order will be requested.\n\nTarget Group 2: Students who are Truant\n\nA student is truant when neither his/her parents/guardians nor school officials know the reason for a student’s absence at the time of the absence or the “willful refusal to attend school in defiance of parental/guardian authority.” (Indiana Court of Appeals: Simmons v. State of Indiana.) Skipping a class or leaving school without permission is an example of truancy. Truancies accumulate throughout the school year and do not reset at any time.\n\nStep 1: When a student is truant for 1 day of school, the parent, student, school administration, and counselor will meet. At the meeting, an attendance letter will be handed to the parent, as well as information on the Westfield Youth Assistance Program. When appropriate, the student will be assigned a Thursday School. Documentation of the meeting will be kept in the school file.\n\nStep 2: When a student is truant for 2 days of school, the student and parent are referred to the school attendance officer. The school administration will complete and submit a school attendance referral form for review by the school principal. The school administrative team will contact parents by mail and by phone to inform the parent and child of a required meeting to be held to discuss the continued absences of the student.\n\nStep 3: At the meeting, the school administrative team will review Indiana Law on school attendance and educational neglect, define excused and unexcused absences, and discuss the consequences of further absences from school. If appropriate, the child will be referred to the Westfield Youth Assistance Program to assist the student and parent in correcting his/her school attendance issues.\n\nStep 4: When a student is truant for 3 days of school, when appropriate he/she may be assigned to an Out of School Suspension .\n\nStep 5: When a student is truant 4 or more days of school, a truancy petition will be filed. In addition, a pick up order will be requested for students in grades 7-12.\n\nIf a student is truant, work will not be credited and progressive discipline will ensue. Truancy will count toward the absence limit.\n\nHabitual Truant\n\nWestfield Washington Schools defines a “habitual truant” as a student who is truant from school or any part of the school day, for a second time during the school year and neither the parent/guardian nor school officials know the reason for a student’s absence at the time of the absence or the student displayed “willful refusal to attend school in defiance of parental/guardian authority” (Indiana Court of Appeals: Simmons v. State of Indiana).\n\nWHS is required to notify the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles which could then either invalidate that student’s license to operate a motor vehicle or prevent the student from acquiring a learner’s permit for a time period as prescribed by law.\n\nThe Bureau of Motor Vehicles is prohibited from issuing a driver’s license or permit to a student less than eighteen (18) whom:\n\nis a habitual truant;\n\nhas at least a second suspension from school for the school year;\n\nhas an expulsion from school; or\n\nhas withdrawn from school, for a reason other than financial hardship, and the withdrawal was reported before graduating.\n\nIf a person is less than eighteen (18) years of age and is a habitual truant, is under a suspension or an expulsion, or has withdrawn from school as described in Section 1 of this chapter, the bureau shall, upon notification by the person’s principal, invalidate the person’s license or permit until the earliest of the following events.\n\nA student whose license or permit has been denied or invalidated for the above reasons will be eligible for a license or permit or have a license or permit revalidated upon the earliest of one of the following events:\n\nthe student turns eighteen (18);\n\n120 days after the person is suspended, or the end of a trimester during which the person returns to school, whichever is longer;\n\nthe suspension, expulsion, or exclusion is reversed after the person has had a hearing under IC 20-33-8.\n\nFurthermore, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles may not issue a driver’s license or permit to a student who is:\n\nat least thirteen (13) years of age, but less than fifteen (15);\n\na habitual truant;\n\nand identified in a list submitted to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles may not be issued an operator’s license or a learner’s permit to drive a motor vehicle or motorcycle under IC 9-24 until the person is at least eighteen (18) years of age.\n\nduedueClassroom Expectations\n\nEach classroom teacher, in cooperation with his/her students, sets up classroom expectations at the beginning of the year. These co-created expectations provide the foundation for a safe, equitable, and relationship driven learning environment. The co-created expectations are shared with parents/guardians at our classroom Information Night/Meet the Teacher Night and are sent home the first week of school.\n\nWWS is dedicated to the social and emotional development of all students to help them reach their full potential. This is an ongoing process focused on student, teacher, and parent / guardian cooperation and collaboration in the classroom, built on a foundation of positive relationships between school and home. Classroom teachers utilize a wide array of interventions to support positive behavior in the classroom. Some examples included, but are not limited to: relationship building, classroom circles, cooperative learning, restorative practices, goal setting, problem-solving, self-reflection, empathy building, mindful moments, etc.\n\nSupporting Student Behavioral Needs\n\nEach classroom teacher and bus driver establishes a system for his/her classroom or bus with expectations and age appropriate student supports. If a child experiences a lack of success with classroom / bus expectations, then additional supports may include:\n\nconference with child and teacher;\n\nconference, in person or by phone, with parent/guardian;\n\nletter to parent/guardian;\n\nloss of recess and/or special school privileges;\n\nloss of bus privileges if incident was bus related;\n\nassignment of tasks to complete such as letters of apology, school service project, etc.;\n\nafter-school detention;\n\nin-school suspension;\n\nout-of-school suspension;\n\nExpulsion.\n\nIn the interest of maintaining a safe and healthy educational environment for all stakeholders, the administration reserves the right to conduct searches of school property based upon reasonable suspicion. The nature and manner in which the search is conducted shall be controlled by the circumstances of each particular situation.\n\nRecess\n\nAll children should wear proper clothing and footwear to match current weather conditions to go outside for recess (e.g. coats, hats, boots, mittens, etc. for cold or snowy weather). The children will go out for recess in cold weather when the wind chill factor is 15 degrees or above. Children will only be allowed to stay inside for one to three days with a note from a parent or guardian. A doctor’s note may be required after three days. If students are inside during recess because of illness, they will complete unfinished work or do quiet work.\n\nWWS Behavior and Disciplinary Policy (Policy 10000-05)\n\nAs referenced in Policy 10000-05, it is the policy of Westfield Washington Schools to balance the rights of student expression with that of all members of the school community, with the interests of an orderly and efficient educational process, and with the needs of a school environment suitable for the healthy growth and development of all students.\n\nWWS Behavior and Disciplinary Policy (Policy C375)\n\nAs referenced in Policy C375, it is the policy of Westfield Washington Schools to balance the rights of student expression with that of all members of the school community, with the interests of an orderly and efficient educational process, and with the needs of a school environment suitable for the healthy growth and development of all students.\n\nAnti-Bullying (Policy C200)\n\nBullying is prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools. Students who commit any acts of bullying are subject to discipline including but not limited to suspension, expulsion, arrest, and/or prosecution.\n\nDefinition: “Bullying” is defined as overt, unwanted, repeated acts or gestures, including verbal or written communications or images transmitted in any manner (including digitally or electronically); physical acts committed; aggression; or any other behaviors committed by a student or group of students against another student with the intent to harass, ridicule, humiliate, intimidate, or harm the targeted student, head for the targeted student an objectively hostile school environment that:\n\nplaces the targeted student in reasonable fear of harm to his or her person or property;\n\nhas a substantially detrimental effect on the targeted student’s physical or mental health;\n\nhas the effect of substantially interfering with the targeted student’s academic performance; or\n\nhas the effect of substantially interfering with the targeted student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by the school.\n\nApplicability: Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying in all forms. This policy may be applied regardless of the physical location in which the bullying behavior occurred, whenever the individual committing the bullying behavior and any of the intended targets of the bullying behavior are students attending a school within Westfield Washington Schools and disciplinary action is reasonably necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or prevent an unreasonable threat to the rights of others to a safe and peaceful learning environment. Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying through the use of data or computer software that is accessed through any computer, computer system, or computer network.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on bullying prevention and policy to all students in grades K-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (C200) can be found on the district’s BoardDocs website, https://go.boarddocs.com/in/wws/Board.nsf/Public.\n\nChildren’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) (Policy A300)\n\nWWS recognizes its responsibility to educate students regarding appropriate behavior when using the Internet. Therefore, students shall be provided instruction about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking sites, user forums, chat sites, and about cyberbullying awareness and response.\n\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide age-appropriate instruction regarding safe and appropriate behavior on social networking sites, user forums, chat sites, and other internet services. Such instruction shall include, but not be limited to, the dangers of posting personal information online, misrepresentation by online predators, how to report inappropriate or offensive content or threats, behaviors that constitute cyberbullying, and how to respond when subjected to cyberbullying.\n\nCriminal Organizations (Policy 10000-52)\n\nCriminal organizations are prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools. Students who commit any acts of criminal organization and criminal organization activity, or reprisal, or retaliation against an individual who reports suspected criminal organization activity are subject to discipline.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization” means a group with at least three (3) members that specifically: (1) Promotes, sponsors, or assists in; or participates in; (2) Requires as a condition of membership or continued membership; or (3) Has as one of its goals; The commission of a felony or an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult or the offense of battery.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization Activity” means knowing or intentional participation in a criminal organization, or knowing or intentional solicitation, recruitment, enticement, or intimidation of another individual to join a criminal organization.\n\nApplicability: The Board of School Trustees of Westfield Washington Schools prohibits criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior on school property, on school buses, and/or at school-sponsored functions and prohibits reprisal or retaliation against individuals who report criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior or who are victims, witnesses, bystanders, or other people with reliable information about an act of criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on criminal organization activity and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform site located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (10000-52) can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nDue Process\n\nIt is important that students be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. The Student Due Process Code (IC 20-33-8), enacted and amended by the General Assembly of Indiana, outlines in detail the procedures to be followed when either suspension or expulsion is utilized as a disciplinary measure. Once due process is initiated, a student will not be permitted to withdraw from school to avoid disciplinary action except in Policy C375, Student Behavior, Rights, and Discipline. Due process procedures begin at the time a student is questioned in relation to an incident.\n\nIn August 2006 the School Board instituted a practice not to hear student due process appeals for expulsion.\n\nLegal Settlement (IC 20-33-8-17) (Policy C125)\n\nA student may be expelled from school if the student’s legal settlement is not in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student is enrolled. Expulsion will not be undertaken if the student voluntarily is withdrawn by the parents/guardians within five calendar days of discovery.\n\nGrounds for Suspension or Expulsion\n\nGrounds for suspension or expulsion are student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience. Examples of student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience for which a student may be suspended or expelled include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Using violence, force, noise, coercion, threat, intimidation, fear, passive resistance, or other comparable conduct constituting an interference with school purposes or urging other students to engage in such conduct. The following enumeration is only illustrative and not limited to the type of conduct prohibited by this rule:\n\na. Occupying any school building, school grounds, or part thereof with intent to deprive others of its use.\n\nb. Blocking the entrance or exits of any school building or corridor or room therein with intent to deprive others of lawful access to or from, or use of the building, corridor, or room.\n\nc. Setting fire to or substantially damaging any school building or property or lighting a fire on school property.\n\nd.

Threatening or intimidating another person for any purpose including obtaining money or anything of value from the student or hazing of other students.\n\n6. Possessing, handling, or transmitting a knife or any object that can reasonably be considered a weapon, or represented to be a weapon. A weapon is defined as any object, mechanism or air gun that could be used to inflict physical harm to another person. This is punishable by up to one-year expulsion.\n\n7. Possessing, using, transmitting, or being under the influence of any narcotic drug, hallucinogenic drug, amphetamine, barbiturate, marijuana, spice, alcoholic beverage, tobacco products including electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, or intoxicants of any kind. Use of drug(s) authorized by a medical prescription from a physician for the person in possession of the drug is not a violation of this rule.\n\n8.

Harassment and discrimination may be any act, speech, or gesture sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities provided by WWS.\n\nProcedural Response:\n\nPlease see Policy 13000-01 for a full description of the procedure to investigate a complaint of harassment\n\nAll complaints will be followed up on and the following steps will be taken.
