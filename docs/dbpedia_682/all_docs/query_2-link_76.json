The various extracurricular programs are designed to enhance what your child learns in the classroom.\n\nIf you need assistance in reading, understanding, or completing forms or information, the district will provide, upon request, free interpretation services in multiple languages. Contact your school office, or go to https://www.tps.org/students_parents/language_assistance_services for further information.\n\nSi necesita asistencia para leer, comprender o completer el formulario o la información que se adjunta, el distrito proporcionará, si se solicita, servicios de interpretación gratuitos en varios idiomas.
