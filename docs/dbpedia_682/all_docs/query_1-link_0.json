        "text": "Accident Insurance for School-Aged Children\n\nStudent accident insurance is an inexpensive type of insurance that should be considered as a supplement to your regular insurance plan since it is very limited in scope. This insurance is made available as a courtesy to you and is not sponsored by the school.\n\nThe school carries no coverage on your child and can make no payments to cover medical costs. The insurance plan offered covers accidents which require medical attention that happen at school and on the bus. An application can be completed on the district website under Parents/Parent Resources.\n\nAssemblies and Convocations\n\nStudents are expected to behave in a proper manner and to be attentive during the program. Horseplay of any kind, such as, but not limited to, annoying or pestering other students, making unnecessary noises, or throwing projectiles is not acceptable behavior. Students who cannot conduct themselves properly will lose their privilege to attend any assemblies or convocations and will be assigned a study room during those times with the same guidelines as in-school suspension.\n\nBicycles and Skateboards\n\nBicycles ridden to school should be placed in the racks provided and not removed until dismissal from school. A lock should be placed on the bicycle for protection against theft. All students who ride bicycles to school should be extremely careful to observe traffic laws and safety rules. Riding “double” is a violation of traffic laws. The parking lot and streets around school are no place to perform “tricks” because of the congestion and traffic. Riding these items must be done on sidewalks. Other wheeled riding objects such as but not limited to skateboards, longboards, hoverboards, motorized scooters etc. are not to be ridden on school property and must be safely stored in a locker or locked on the bike rack.\n\nBook Bags—Gym Bags\n\nStudents who bring book bags or gym bags (which include rope bags) to school must keep them in their assigned locker throughout the school day. Because of safety reasons, students are not permitted to bring book bags or gym bags to class. Students are encouraged to purchase bags that will fit into a locker.\n\nCanvas\n\nCanvas is our learning management system. Parents can choose to create a Canvas observer account in order to see their student’s assignment due dates, teacher feedback on graded assignments, class announcements, and other course content. To learn more about Canvas observer accounts, click here.\n\nElectronic Devices/Cell Phones/Communication Devices\n\nStudents are prohibited from using a “wireless communication device” (as defined by Indiana law) during “instructional time” (as defined by Indiana Law). Teachers may give students permission to use a wireless communication device for educational purposes during instructional time. In addition, students are not allowed to have devices out during lunch or passing periods without permission from school personnel.\n\nStudents are permitted to use a wireless communication device:\n\nin the event of an emergency;\n\nto manage a student's health care;\n\nif included in a student’s IEP;\n\nif included in the student’s plan developed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (5) if otherwise required by law;\n\nwith permission from school personnel.\n\nStudents are assigned a one-to-one device from the school for educational purposes. Students should keep personal cell phones and/or other wireless communications out of sight during each class period. Students will be accountable to the discipline code if they violate this rule. Checking the time, using a calculator, or using other cell phone functions will be considered usage. Text messaging, audio recording, or videos may only happen with permission from school personnel. The administration may confiscate any electronic device for inappropriate use.\n\nIf a student brings a personal device to school, the school is not liable for any loss or damage to it. The Technology Use Form must be completed in PowerSchool. All devices should be clearly labeled with the owner's name.\n\nIt is preferred that parents contact the receptionist if they need to contact a student (or vice versa) during the school day. The student will be provided with a pass to come to the office and take the call if needed.\n\nCurricular Materials and Student Fees\n\nThe Indiana Department of Education covers the cost of curricular materials for students. Parents will be invoiced for student fees, covering consumable and perishable items in a student’s classes. Full payment or a payment plan should be completed by the end of the first six weeks of school.\n\nIf a student's schedule changes during the year, fees may be adjusted based on the new classes. The parent may incur an additional cost or be due a credit. If a credit is on the account, a refund will be issued by the end of June.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools requires all unpaid fees not on a payment plan to be sent to a collection agency by the end of the school year. Any account turned over to collections will have an additional $10.00 fee added to its outstanding balance.\n\nIf a student is withdrawn from school, the parent will receive a prorated refund for any consumable item that has not been used. However, many consumable materials used in classes lose their value once they have been used for any part of a class.\n\nStudent fees are established annually and approved by the Board of School Trustees. Payment is collected at the district level. Payment can be made at the administration building with cash, check, credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Discover), or by completing a payment contract. Payment can also be made online through the PowerSchool interface. Payments made via credit card will be subject to credit card fees.\n\nPermanent Behavior Record (Every Student Succeeds Act)\n\nWestfield Washington Schools must comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act. Information regarding out-of-school suspensions and/or expulsions will remain part of each student’s permanent record that begins in kindergarten and concludes when a student graduates, transfers outside the district, or is expelled. Information about in-school suspensions or punishments by individual teachers, such as an after-school detention, is not part of the permanent record. These records will not appear on transcripts of grades which colleges receive. This information will be shared with other schools only when the student transfers. For more information, contact the Director of Student Services at 867-8006.\n\nField Trips\n\nEach grade level may plan field trips that relate directly to the curriculum being studied. A fee is assessed for admission and transportation costs. It is School Board policy that all children going on field trips have a signed permission slip. These forms must be signed by the parent and/or guardian and returned by the day of the trip unless otherwise designated by the teacher. When space allows, there may be opportunities for parents/guardians to chaperone field trips. All parents/guardians serving as chaperones must complete the Safe Visitor background check as described above in the “School Visitor” section. For safety and supervision reasons, younger siblings are not permitted to attend field trips.\n\nChildren who have failed to return a signed permission slip will remain at the building and will be assigned alternative work. *A student without proof of proper immunizations is considered in violation of IC 20-34-4-5 students will not be allowed to attend field trips and/or extracurricular activities until immunization records are up to date and on file with the school nurse. Disciplinary action during the school year may result in restrictions for attendance on field trips.\n\nA student who has accumulated five (5) absences for the current quarter may not be permitted to participate on a field trip. The Administrator when making this decision will consider extenuating circumstance.\n\nAdministrators reserve the right not to allow a student to go on a field trip due to issues such as attendance, tardies, or discipline.\n\nLockers\n\nAll students are assigned a hall locker in which their books, materials, coats, etc. are to be placed during school hours. Students are issued a combination for their lockers. It is the responsibility of the student to secure his/her lockers at all times. The care of the locker is the responsibility of the student. Lockers are the property of the school; therefore, students cannot presume an expectation of privacy. Student lockers can be examined by the principal or his/her designee under appropriate circumstances. Listed below are helpful tips in keeping your locker safe and secure:\n\nEach student should memorize his/her combination.\n\nNo student is to disclose the combination to another student.\n\nEach student should keep the locker locked to ensure the security of their property. The school is not responsible for items that are lost or stolen.\n\nA student should not have access to another student’s locker.\n\nUnder no circumstances can students share the same locker.\n\nStudents are responsible for the contents in their assigned locker.\n\nNo items should be attached to the locker door without school administrations prior approval.\n\nStudents should not pre-set lockers to open or tamper with the locking mechanisms.\n\nMedia Center\n\nThe Media Center is open from 8:45 am to 3:35 pm, except on Wednesdays when it opens at 9:15 am. Students need a pass to go to the Media Center during class time. Students may check out as many books as they desire as long as they do not have any overdue materials or outstanding debts with the Media Center. All general circulation books are checked out for two weeks. Books may be renewed for an additional two weeks.\n\nMoney\n\nChildren are discouraged from bringing money to school unless there is a definite need for it. The school is not responsible for the loss of money.\n\nRestrooms\n\nRestrooms may be used during the school day. To be excused from class time, a student must have a pass from the classroom teacher. Restrooms should be used by students in the area closest to their classroom. Restroom privileges should not be abused. No phone use, picture taking, or videotaping is permitted in restrooms. Every effort should be made to keep the restrooms clean. Students caught or found guilty of vandalizing or defacing restrooms will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\nSchool Messenger\n\nSchool Messenger is the WWS electronic parent/guardian notification system. Emergency notifications, weather delays, closings, student documentation, general building information and district information are sent via voice messaging, text messages and email notification to the phone numbers and email addresses provided. Email is generally used for non-emergency situations (i.e. weekly newsletters or district announcements). For an emergency or immediate activity, the system calls the parents/guardians’ listed number and sends a text to the cell phone number provided. Please be sure to keep accurate email addresses and phone numbers in PowerSchool. Parents/guardians can update their email and phone number by notifying the front desk of their child’s school.\n\nTalkingPoints\n\nWestfield Washington Schools uses TalkingPoints as a multilingual communication tool between teachers and families. Families can choose to receive messages via SMS text messaging or through the free FAMILIES/TalkingPoints mobile app for Apple or Android. To ensure messages are received from your child’s teachers, make sure your contact information for the “Father” and “Mother” fields in PowerSchool are correct. When a teacher sends a message, TalkingPoints will automatically use these two phone numbers. If you would like to add additional contacts, please reach out to your child’s teachers.\n\nTechnology Guidelines (Policy 13000-03)\n\nThe use of technology (this policy includes, but is not limited to): telephones, cellular devices, digital media players, tablets, laptop and desktop computers and workstations, direct radio communication, Internet access, voice mail, e-mail, text messaging, direct messaging through device applications, facsimile transmission and receipt, artificial intelligence, including\n\nlanguage-generation tools and large language models, and any computer based research and/or communication) is a privilegeAbuse or misuse of the equipment, policies, or rules will lead to a loss of privileges or disciplinary action by school administration. Students and their parents/guardians are responsible for the cost of repair or the cost of replacement of any damage incurred either by vandalism or carelessness. All technology use is governed by the Responsible Use of Technology and Internet Use Policy (A300).\n\nStudent owned personal devices and Corporation technology shall be used by students under teacher supervision with the purpose of improving instruction and student learning. A copy of the Policy and Parental Consent form is available in PowerSchool.\n\nSchool Meal Assistance\n\nFinancial assistance is available to parents who complete a Household Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals form and qualify for assistance. The forms are available during registration, online or at the administration building. The form completed must be for the current school year.\n\nA child is eligible if the total household income and the amount and source of income received by each household member fall within federal guidelines for Free/Reduced Meals.\n\nSmoking, Vaping, and Tobacco Products\n\nSmoking, vaping, and tobacco use are prohibited in and on school grounds. Tobacco and nicotine-based products and look-a-like products such as electronic cigarettes are specifically prohibited by Indiana Statute and Westfield Washington Schools. Tobacco includes, but is not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, nicotine, nicotine-delivering devices, chemicals, or devices that produce the same flavor or physical effect of nicotine substances; and any other tobacco or nicotine innovations. Violations will result in serious consequences as outlined in the due process section of this handbook.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools prepares all students for the day after graduation and emphasizes Life Readiness in order for all young people to be successful in our community. The student learning experience is shaped through cognitive and non-cognitive growth cultivated by opportunities provided by staff members on a daily basis at school. These opportunities will only be maximized through daily attendance. A student’s attendance is essential to learning -- learning that includes not only factual subject matter but also the skills needed for Life Readiness. Reading the material and performing satisfactorily on tests does not compensate for the loss of insight gained during guided instruction, class collaboration, or supervised work. Furthermore, every student contributes to one another; therefore, a student who is absent short-changes those who are not.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools bases its attendance policy on state code and Indiana Department of Education guidance. Indiana State Code requires children to attend school during the time it is in session until the child graduates or becomes 18 years of age. The Board of School Trustees, as an agency of the State, is required to enforce regular attendance of students. Absence from school is defined as any non-presence (excused or unexcused) during part or all of a scheduled school day that is not canceled or altered due to weather or other emergency.\n\nUsing both state code and IDOE guidance, Westfield Washington Schools establishes that all students must be in attendance for over 166 days of the 175 day school year, meaning that students should not miss more than 9 days in a year. The state of Indiana counts all absences alike, whether excused or unexcused. Not missing more than 9 days (whether excused or unexcused) ensures a student has an attendance percentage of 95% or higher; this percentage has been proven to maximize student learning. Westfield Washington Schools sees student attendance as the first and most important rule in creating the best learning experience for students.\n\nAny student who is absent for 10 full days or more, or for 10 individual class periods or more at the middle and high school level, puts their status as a student in good standing in jeopardy. As a result, the ability to participate in co-curricular or extracurricular events (including but not limited to clubs, athletics, performing arts, prom, et al.) may be revoked unless approved by an administrator.\n\nReporting Absences\n\nIt is the responsibility of the child’s parent to notify the school office when a student is absent. Please phone the attendance line by 10:00 a.m. the day of the student’s absence. A parent may call the attendance line and leave a voicemail 24 hours a day. A parent may call in his/her native language. Please give your name, phone number, your child’s name, and the reason for the absence. Any absences not verified by a parent within 72 hours (3 days) may be deemed as truant, which will compromise the ability of the students to make up work for credit.\n\nParents/Guardians are encouraged to provide a doctor’s excuse to the office for each absence that requires a visit to the doctor or other medical professional.\n\nPer state code, attendance policies are determined locally. It is a local decision to excuse or not excuse an absence.\n\nTypes of Absences\n\nIndiana State Code utilizes the terminology of Excused, Unexcused, and Truant for absences. As a result, Westfield Washington Schools utilizes the same terminology. Further explanation of these terms follows. Excused absences are verified by either a parent or a third party, such as a doctor and matching the board approved definition. Unexcused absences are unverified, or exceeding the allowed limit even if verified, or truancies.\n\nExcused Absences\n\nA parent call-in is required to excuse an absence\n\nStudent illness (with accompanying medical note preferred; accompanying med note is required if a student reaches 7 or more of any type of absences)\n\nDeath/grave illness of an immediate family member\n\nExclusion because of exposure to contagious disease\n\nRequired religious observation\n\nMedical, dental, or professional appointments. Please make every effort to schedule appointments outside of school hours.\n\nPre-arranged absences\n\nPre-arranged absences include vacations (not exceeding 7 days), club sports athletic tournaments, external performing arts opportunities, extended medical absences, job interviews and internship interviews. Any possible external verification for these types of absences is encouraged.\n\nParents/guardians are expected to plan vacations/college visits around the school schedule as absences are a serious interruption to the learning process.\n\nThe parent/guardian must call the school attendance office at least two school days in advance of any pre-arranged absence.\n\nPlanned vacation days shall be taken with the parent/guardian of the student.\n\nClass work shall be completed in advance of the pre-arranged absence or as teachers may determine.\n\nThe principal or assistant principal shall deny pre-arranged absence days to students having excessive absences or when vacation days will extend absences beyond the 7 day limit.\n\nOther Educational Activity\n\nOther educational activity is defined as any other absence, approved by the building principal or assistant principal, resulting from an educational activity that is relevant to the child’s academic growth and equivalent to the child’s school activities/experiences. Such absence requires prior notification at least two school days prior to the absence and proper verification. These types of absences will be coded uniquely, accounting for presence in class on those days and not accumulating towards the student’s absence total. The principal or assistant principal shall have discretion to rescind approval of the other educational activity status if the reporting is deemed insufficient, if the student already has excessive absences, or if the student is not in good academic standing.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-2-14, -15, -16, -17, students supplying the proper notification to the school office and participating in the following events are not counted absent:\n\nService as page or honoree of general assembly\n\nService to the election board or political candidate on Election Day.\n\nWitness in judicial proceeding or any required court appearance for which a student is subpoenaed.\n\nDuty with the Indiana National Guard (maximum 10 days)\n\nDuty with the Indiana wing of civil air patrol\n\nNational Guard duty (maximum 10 days)\n\nParticipation in the state fair\n\nA principal approved educationally sound activity.\n\nParents/Guardians must notify the school with physician documentation when circumstances of prolonged student illness occur. This will assist the principal or assistant principal in employing this policy’s parent/guardian notice and intervention provisions.\n\nUnexcused Absences\n\nAn unexcused absence is any absence not covered under either the definition of excused absence or listed as an exception to compulsory attendance.\n\nThe following are considered unexcused absences:\n\nAny absence in excess of 10 previously accrued that is not excused by state law or accompanied with medical verification, or previously approved by principal.\n\nAny absence not recognized by state law or Westfield Washington Schools.\n\nStudents arriving to class 30 minutes late or more are considered absent for that class. This will be considered unexcused unless accompanied with the proper verification noted above.\n\nTardy To School\n\nTardiness is disruptive to the educational process and is considered to be a serious matter. WMS believes that timeliness is a life skill and students are responsible for their own tardiness to school. When students arrive at school after the 8:45 a.m. (except Wednesdays when students arrive after 9:15 a.m.) bell has rung, they should report directly to the office. Students are to sign in with the secretary in the main office. Parents/Guardians must notify the school office by note, phone call or in person when a student is tardy to school. Failure to inform the school office will result in the child’s arrival being counted as unexcused. A tardy will follow the same criteria listed under absences. Reasons such as, but not limited to, car trouble, traffic, oversleeping, missing the bus, school closing assumptions, or parent taking responsibility will result in an unexcused tardy to school.\n\nThe consequences for the above named actions will be named at the discretion of building administration based on the consequences and interventions found on page —-.\n\nTardy to Class\n\nTardiness is disruptive to the educational process and is considered to be a serious matter. WMS believes that timeliness is a life skill and students are responsible for their own tardiness. Students who arrive after the bell should arrive with a pass. Students who do not arrive with a pass will be marked as tardy. Tardies are indicated in powerschool and should be reviewed throughout the week. Students who are tardy to class without a pass are subject to consequences. The consequences for the above named actions will be named at the discretion of building administration based on the consequences and interventions found on page —-.\n\nTruant\n\nTruancy is defined as an absence from school without the knowledge or consent of the parent/guardian and the school, or absent from school when there is an attempt to evade the Indiana Compulsory Attendance Law. The following circumstances are considered truancy:\n\nThe willful non-attendance by a student not to attend school. This act of non-compliance is not authorized an/or known by the parent/guardian\n\nA student does not report for an assigned class during the course of the school day.\n\nA student leaving the building and/or school grounds during the day without permission.\n\nA student misrepresents a pass and does not report to a designated location during the day. An example would be reporting 20 plus minutes late for a class or wandering in the school to a designated location.\n\nLate arrival to school may be considered an instance of truancy.\n\nStudents will be considered a “habitual truant if they are truant from school more than ten (10) days in the school year.\n\nCodes to Know and Other Key Definitions\n\nKey Definitions:\n\nFull Day Presence: A student who attends four periods or more is considered present for the entire school day at Westfield Middle School (Single period absences may still be enforced with school discipline). It is the school’s goal to maximize full day presence.\n\nHalf Day Presence: A student who attends three periods in a school day is considered present for 50% of the day at Westfield Middle School. If a student must miss school, it is valuable that they still attend as much as possible on such a day.\n\nAbsence: A student who attends zero or only one period in a school day is considered absent for the day at Westfield Middle School.\n\nHabitual Truant: Habitual truant\" refers to a student who has been absent ten (10) days or more from school within a school year without being excused or without being absent under a parental request that has been filed with the school. (Indiana Code 20-18-2-6.5)\n\nChronic Absentee: The term Chronic Absentee refers to a student who has been absent 10% or more of the school days during the scholastic year (Indiana Department of Education)\n\nIn grades 5-12, students who are absent from school for more than three periods may not attend or participate in any extracurricular activities on the day of absence without administrative approval.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Truancy Prevention Policy\n\nEffective July 1, 2024, Indiana Code 20-33-2.5 establishes that each school corporation shall adopt a truancy prevention policy. Westfield Washington Schools champions student learning and preparation for Life after Graduation; as a result, every school will fulfill this plan as appropriate for grade level. Beyond state expectations, Westfield Washington Schools is committed to an informative and educational policy regarding student attendance. As a result, we incorporate three tiers to our system in order to best reach all families.\n\nTier 1: Every school will send all families returning to a district school a written attendance update at the end of each school’s term (trimester or quarter). These will be sent to emails on file. Transparency will be on display, with regular schoolwide data updates about attendance performance targets in principal newsletters.\n\nTier 2: Students who have missed five total days or more during the school term will be informed in writing. As this is cumulative throughout the year and not within one single grading period, this may not require further action unless otherwise indicated.\n\nTier 3:\n\nWestfield Washington Schools will initiate truancy prevention for any absent student who is absent 5 days (unexcused and/or unverified) within a trimester or quarter, depending on school. Westfield Washington Schools may also initiate truancy prevention for a student who has had 7 or more called-in absences, even if they are considered excused.\n\nStudents who are absent in conformity with a medical letter of incapacity to attend signed by a doctor, therapist, or other medical professional may be exempt from this.\n\nUpon the fifth unexcused absence, the process will be initiated with a written notification sent either virtually or on paper to the parents of the student, informing the parent of the student’s attendance record and reminding the parent of responsibility to monitor the student’s attendance and ensure the student attends school in accordance with compulsory attendance laws. This letter will invite response for a required in-person attendance conference to discuss an action plan of improvement. This letter will also include verbiage on the definition and action steps that must legally be taken if the student is considered a habitual truant, which includes reporting the student to an intake officer of the juvenile court or the department of child services in accordance with IC 20-33-2-25, and subsequent actions that may be taken by those entities upon referral by the school district.\n\nThe attendance conference will be held within five (5) school days of notification. The following individuals will be present in the conference:\n\nA representative of the school (principal, assistant principal, dean, and/or counselor)\n\nA teacher of the student (Grades K-6 only)\n\nThe student’s parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\nThe school will permit the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s) to elect to bring a representative who may provide insight into the student’s absenteeism if the student’s parent fulfills the following:\n\nMakes request to the school that the representative attend; and\n\nProvides notice tt the school regarding the identification of the representative;\n\nat least forty-eight (48) hours before the attendance conference.\n\nDuring the meeting, an attendance contract will be developed; contract will be in effect for forty-five (45) days. Attendance contract may include expectations accompanied with extra supports and/or accountability measures.\n\nAt the secondary level, this may take place for students who have accrued five unexcused absences to a single class period.\n\nMake-Up Work\n\nClasswork and assignments are essential to the learning process. All work missed due to absence (excused, unexcused, or truancy) is expected to be completed. A student shall have one day to make up work for each day of absence. This guideline may be altered at the discretion of the principal and the teacher if it is determined that it is unreasonable for the student to complete all missing work within the allotted time. This guideline may also be altered for unexcused prearranged absences, such as vacations, in order for the learning process to remain as uninterrupted as possible. Students should utilize Canvas first to see the work they missed while they are out, completing what is possible to be completed if physically able. Lengthy absences may require that the teacher provide schoolwork alternatives and timeframes for completion. In such cases, the teacher will notify the student and the principal. Teachers will strive to ensure the alternative assignments assist the student in achieving course learning targets and set a reasonable timeframe for the completion of the work.\n\nCurricular, Co-Curricular and Extracurricular Incentives for Attending\n\nStudents in regular attendance are considered students in good standing. A student must attend four class periods on the day of a co-curricular or extracurricular activity on the day of the activity in order to be able to participate. If the event takes place on Saturday, the student must fulfill this obligation on Friday. Administrative approval is required for any exceptions.These events include but are not limited to athletic contests, musical and theatrical performances, academic team competitions, prom, et al.\n\nA student who has accrued five or more absences in any given quarter or ten or more absences for the current school year (excused or unexcused) may be withheld by administration from participating in field trips.\n\nA student who has accrued five or more absences in any given quarter or ten or more absences for the current year may be withheld from participation in school organizations, including but not limited to athletic teams, musical and theatrical co-/extracurricular organizations, et al.\n\nTardies are considered a form of absence. A student who has accrued excessive tardies may be withheld from participating in field trips as well as co-/extracurricular activities and organizations.\n\nDisciplinary Action\n\nWestfield Washington Schools may utilize school discipline for any unexcused absence, truancy, or absence exceeding 7 in the school year unless deemed excused by administration.\n\nDisciplinary Action for Truancy\n\nThe result of the first truancy/unexcused absence will be:\n\nDetentions twice the number of hours missed, or\n\nSaturday School if a total of four hours of detention is to be served.\n\nThe result of a second truancy will be:\n\nSaturday School\n\nSubsequent truancies/unexcused absences will result in one or more of the following:\n\nLoss of ability to participate in co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities/organizations; loss of ability to participate in field trips.\n\nLoss of driving privileges for students who are drivers\n\nReferral to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of invalidation of driver’s license\n\nPlacement on an attendance contract\n\nReferral to Hamilton County ACES\n\nReferral to DCS\n\nFiling of truancy with the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office\n\nSuspension and/or expulsion\n\nB. Actions for Absences Exceeding 10 in the School Year\n\nExcessive absences can merit both school discipline as well as extra support. Any of the following disciplinary steps may occur:\n\nLoss of ability to participate in co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities/organizations; loss of ability to participate in field trips.\n\nAfter-school detention to make up missed time\n\nSaturday School for more built in study time\n\nAttendance Contract\n\nRequirement for parent/guardian to produce a certificate of incapacity not later than six (6) days after the certificate is demanded.\n\nLoss of driving privileges for students who are drivers\n\nReferral to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of invalidation of driver’s license\n\nRequirement for medical notes upon future absences.\n\nWellness check through WPD\n\nReferral to DCS\n\nReferral to Hamilton County ACES\n\nFiling of truancy with the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s office.\n\nSuspension and/or expulsion\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Attendance Procedures/Hamilton County Schools Attendance Program Project ACES – Attending Class Equals Success\n\nWestfield Washington Schools participates in the Hamilton County Schools Project ACES Attendance Program in collaboration with the Hamilton County Juvenile Prosecutor’s Office. Project ACES tracks the total number of excused/unexcused absences to school accumulated for the entire school year. The goal of Project ACES is to ensure that every child attends school as required by Indiana Law so that each child will receive the necessary guidance and knowledge to become a productive member of the community. Absences to school are cumulative throughout the school year and do not reset at any point during the school year for grades K-12.\n\nProject ACES is a collaboration between the school, parent, student, Westfield Youth Assistance Program, and the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office. In working together and through early intervention, we believe that attending class will equal success for each and every student.\n\nLegal Loss of Driving Privileges\n\nAdditional information about the legal loss of driving privileges can be found in the Westfield High School handbook.\n\nThe following are in addition to the policies of Westfield Washington Schools and are specific to Westfield Middle School.\n\nExpectations\n\nStudents at Westfield Middle School are expected to act in such a manner as to maintain the high expectations held for their behavior by the community.

As a general rule, students will be expected to have proper materials and to conduct themselves in a manner that demonstrates respect for themselves, for others, for the staff, and for school and private property. Students whose behavior does not meet these expectations may be subject to disciplinary actions, which include detention, Thursday School, Suspension or Expulsion.\n\nThe determination of disciplinary action will be made following an examination of the offense, its circumstances, and the guidelines established in IC 20-33-8.

Detention, special work details, or assignments will be used if feasible and if appropriate to the infraction. A student will receive one of these consequences once for behavior problems. The administration, however, reserves the right to deal with each student as an individual in order to attempt to bring about a change in behavior, especially when parents/guardians or counseling are involved.\n\nIn the interest of maintaining an appropriate educational environment as well as student health and safety, and the health and safety of school personnel, the administration reserves the right to conduct searches of school property based upon reasonable suspicion.

Students do have the full protection of due process including the appeal of any decision dealing with disciplinary action.\n\nIt is the intent of the administration and teachers of Westfield Washington Schools to follow the discipline procedures as outlined in the student handbook. In addition to the actions specifically provided in the student handbook, the superintendent, principals, any administrative personnel, or any teacher of the school corporation shall be authorized to take any action in connection with student behavior which is reasonable, desirable, or necessary to help any student to further school purposes, or to prevent an interference therewith; such action, including but not limited to, such matters as:\n\ncounseling with a student or group of students;\n\nconference with a parent/guardian or group of parents/guardians;\n\nassigning student additional work;\n\nrearranging class schedules;\n\nrequiring a student to remain in school after regular hours to do additional schoolwork or for counseling; or\n\nrestricting extracurricular activities.\n\nAnti-Bullying (Policy C200)\n\nBullying is prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools.

This policy may be applied regardless of the physical location in which the bullying behavior occurred, whenever the individual committing the bullying behavior and any of the intended targets of the bullying behavior are students attending a school within Westfield Washington Schools and disciplinary action is reasonably necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or prevent an unreasonable threat to the rights of others to a safe and peaceful learning environment. Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying through the use of data or computer software that is accessed through any computer, computer system, or computer network.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on bullying prevention and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (C200) can be found on the district’s BoardDocs website, https://go.boarddocs.com/in/wws/Board.nsf/Public.\n\nAnti-Bullying Description\n\nWe will not bully others.\n\nWe will help students who are bullied.\n\nWe will include students who are being left out.\n\nIf we know that somebody is being bullied, we will immediately tell an adult.\n\nDisciplinary actions for a student found to have engaged in bullying behavior will be handled in the following manner:\n\n1st and 2nd offense: Warning Conference with School Staff\n\n3rd offense: Guidance Counselor Intervention\n\n4th offense: Referral to the Assistant Principal\n\nContinued offenses: Referral to the Assistant Principal and possible suspension\n\nSeverity of consequences may be altered at the discretion of school administration due to the nature and level of bullying.\n\nChildren’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) (Policy A300)\n\nWWS recognizes its responsibility to educate students regarding appropriate behavior when using the Internet.

Students who commit any acts of criminal organization and criminal organization activity, or reprisal, or retaliation against an individual who reports suspected criminal organization activity are subject to discipline.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization” means a group with at least three (3) members that specifically: (1) Promotes, sponsors, or assists in; or participates in; (2) Requires as a condition of membership or continued membership; or (3) Has as one of its goals; The commission of a felony or an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult or the offense of battery.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization Activity” means knowing or intentional participation in a criminal organization, or knowing or intentional solicitation, recruitment, enticement, or intimidation of another individual to join a criminal organization.\n\nApplicability: The Board of School Trustees of Westfield Washington Schools prohibits criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior on school property, on school buses, and/or at school-sponsored functions and prohibits reprisal or retaliation against individuals who report criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior or who are victims, witnesses, bystanders, or other people with reliable information about an act of criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on criminal organization activity and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform site located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (10000-52) can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nDrug/Alcohol Policy (C450)\n\nAs referenced in Policy C450, students who are in possession of drugs and/or paraphernalia and/or who have items that a reasonable person could judge to be used in the sale of drugs or paraphernalia or who exhibit behavior which lead school authorities to have reasonable suspicion to suspect the student is under the influence of a controlled substance will be subject to the drug/discipline policy and will be dealt with accordingly. Furthermore, the school may subject items in said student’s possession to a test to determine if those items contain drugs or alcohol.\n\nThe school administration may also require a drug/alcohol screen to be immediately administered at the school corporation’s expense. If the test is positive, all future drug tests will be done at the parent’s/guardian’s or student’s expense. Factors which the administration will consider may include, but are not limited to:\n\nOdor of alcohol/marijuana/smoke;\n\nGlassy, dilated, bloodshot eyes, or dark circles under eyes;\n\nAppears dazed, giddy;\n\nStaggering walk;\n\nSlurred or rapid speech;\n\nIncoherent thought processes;\n\nDisruptive, aggressive, physically threatening, out of control, or unusual behavior;\n\nBragging or talking to other students about alcohol or drug use;\n\nNoticeable withdrawal from favorite activities and friends;\n\nPhysical indicators from an objective assessment by the school nurse or;\n\nPossession of, use, or transporting drug paraphernalia or items used to weigh or sell drugs or drug paraphernalia.\n\nRefusal to submit to a drug test will be considered an admission of being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. This is a violation of school rules and will be dealt with according to the student discipline policy. The administration will make a reasonable attempt to apprise the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the situation.\n\nIn addition, in an effort to promote a drug-free campus and to protect the safety and health of the school’s faculty, staff and students, Westfield Middle School periodically requests the Westfield Police Department to conduct random searches of student lockers. This is done through a modified internal lockdown while students are safely in class. The School Board authorizes the use of specially-trained dogs to locate and detect the presence of weapons and prohibited drugs on school property as directed by the administration. Westfield Middle School treats this type of search as a community partnership with Hamilton County and Westfield law enforcement. Canine searches are treated as a safety drill and there will not be any prior or concluding communication with students, staff, or parents about the drill. This is done to protect the safety of students, staff, law enforcement officials, and canine law enforcement animals.\n\nIf a canine indicates a locker, the school administration may conduct searches of individuals on the basis of ‘reasonable suspicion’. Administration will meet with the implicated student to more fully investigate the situation. This may include, but is not limited to, a more thorough search of the student’s person or belongings, a nurse evaluation of substance-induced symptoms present, and a drug screen. Parents will be notified in a timely manner regarding the investigation. Any search conducted by the administration shall be conducted in accordance with School Board policy, this Student Handbook, and applicable law.\n\nPossession or consumption/use of, or sale or supplying of, alcohol or drugs by a student is an expellable offense.\n\nFirearms, Weapons, and Destructive Devices (Policy A200)\n\nPolicy:\n\nNo student shall possess, handle or transmit any firearm, deadly weapon or destructive device on school property, on a school bus, or WWS events even if held outside school property.\n\nNo student shall possess any object which is either intended, or may in fact be used as, or looks like a weapon or other instrumentality which could cause harm to any other person on school property, on a school bus, or WWS events even if held outside school property. Such objects include, but are not necessarily limited to, knives, batons, night sticks, brass knuckles, bombs, fireworks, electronic stun weapons, tasers, stun guns, or chemicals.\n\nAnyone who has reason to believe that any individual is violating the law or this policy shall immediately report the alleged violation to an administrator or law enforcement officer.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n“Firearm” is any weapon that is capable of expelling, designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel, a projectile by means of explosion.\n\n“Ammunition” means fixed cartridge ammunition; shotgun shells; the individual components of fixed cartridge ammunition and shotgun shells; projectiles for muzzle loading firearms; and any propellant used in a firearm or in firearm ammunition.\n\n“Knife” is an instrument that consists of a sharp edged or sharp pointed blade capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds; and is intended to be used as a weapon. The term includes a dagger, dirk, poniard, stiletto, switchblade knife, or gravity knife.\n\nIn addition to being subjected to criminal charges, any student who violates this policy shall be subject to expulsion or suspension.\n\nDue Process\n\nIt is important that students be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. The Student Due Process Code (IC 20-33-8), enacted and amended by the General Assembly of Indiana, outlines in detail the procedures to be followed when either suspension or expulsion is utilized as a disciplinary measure. Once due process is initiated, a student will not be permitted to withdraw from school to avoid disciplinary action except in Policy C375 Suspension and Expulsion of Students. Due process procedures begin at the time a student is questioned in relation to an incident.\n\nIn August 2006 the School Board instituted a practice not to hear student due process appeals for expulsion.\n\nLegal Settlement (IC 20-33-8-17) (Policy C125)\n\nA student may be expelled from school if the student’s legal settlement is not in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student is enrolled. Expulsion will not be undertaken if the student voluntarily is withdrawn by the parents/guardians within five calendar days of discovery.\n\nGrounds for Suspension or Expulsion\n\nGrounds for suspension or expulsion are student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience. Examples of student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience for which a student may be suspended or expelled include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.
