        "text": "Summary:\n\nWestfield Middle School is a public middle school serving 691 students in grades 7-8 in Westfield, MA, which is part of the Westfield school district. While the school has a predominantly White student population, it faces challenges in academic performance, with proficiency rates below the state average across all subjects and grade levels.\n\nWestfield Middle School's academic performance, as measured by MCAS Next Generation test scores, lags behind the state average, with proficiency rates of 40.71% in English Language Arts, 27.02% in Mathematics, and 23.15% in Science, compared to the state averages of 42.29%, 40.6%, and 41.22%, respectively. The school's statewide ranking among Massachusetts middle schools has been consistently in the bottom half, ranging from 280 out of 501 schools in 2022-2023 to as low as 400 out of 482 schools in 2015-2016. Additionally, the school's performance varies significantly across different student subgroups, with Asian and White students performing significantly better than African American and Hispanic students.\n\nInterestingly, Westfield Middle School's academic performance is generally lower than that of nearby middle schools, such as Westfield Intermediate School, Roberta G. Doering School in Agawam, and Agawam Junior High. These schools tend to have higher proficiency rates and better statewide rankings. The school's declining performance over the years, with its statewide ranking dropping from 272 out of 498 schools in 2018-2019 to 280 out of 501 schools in 2022-2023, suggests that the school may be facing challenges in maintaining or improving its academic outcomes.\n\nDetail:"
