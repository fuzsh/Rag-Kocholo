        "text": "\"Throughout my time at Whitfield I have been a part of many leadership teams and programs and looking back, I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to be in those leadership roles. I have met and worked with so many amazing people over the years. Being on the Student Council has allowed me to branch out and get to know my classmates even better. What makes being a leader so fulfilling is getting other people involved and working together to achieve our goals.\"\n\n\"When I initially enrolled my daughter I felt like the school would accept her for who she was and would help her determine who she wanted to become. Since then, my daughter has found her voice. She is able to share her own values, opinions, beliefs, and perspectives with conviction, and appreciate the perspectives of others.\"\n\n\"There are many factors that contributed to the decision to send our kids to Whitfield, including the student-to-teacher ratio, overall school size, and class size. While Whitfield maintains a high expectation for academic achievement, there are lessons learned that go far beyond the textbooks. Kind, caring, accepting. These are life qualities that are a tremendous part of the educational experience at Whitfield.\"\n\n\"A quality education and diverse community were crucial “must haves” for our family. While there are great choices in the region, we feel no other institution exemplifies the environment in which we want our children to succeed more than Whitfield. \"\n\n\"I love our school community. Whitfield is truly a special place with the most caring and dedicated faculty, parents and students. Our students see the example of our faculty and staff who are lifelong learners and who share their enthusiasm for scholarship every day.\"\n\n\"Our school community cultivates trust, professionalism, empathy, collaboration, compassion, and multiculturalism. I especially value working at a school that respects and embraces everyone, and a school that engages in open and civil conversations about human rights, social justice and inclusion, global citizenship, and the need to understand one's role in an increasingly pluralistic and multicultural world.\"\n\n\"The small, structured class size fostered an environment for my growth. Throughout high school, I felt the most comfortable and accepted in the arts programs and really enjoyed the opportunity of being involved in band, choir and theater. All of those experiences made an impact on my life.\"\n\n\"Whitfield's focus on constructive classroom communication helped foster my strong participation skills in college — something I saw other students struggle with. Having the confidence and skillset to engage with a professor in class helped bring topics to life and furthered my understanding. Whitfield taught me to bring an analytical eye to college material rather than simply memorizing lessons letter-for-letter.\"\n\n\"Whitfield instilled a strong work ethic in me, both in and out of the classroom. Whitfield allowed me the opportunity to be successful academically while also taking part in athletics and extracurricular activities. Any high school will provide an education. What makes Whitfield unique is how other values are also instilled in students—communication, relationships, respect, trust, and reward for hard work.\"\n\n\"At Whitfield, we equip our students with the foundational understandings and critical skills they need to thrive in college. But just as important, we teach our students how to learn, fostering the 21st-century skills—creativity and collaboration, critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication—they will need in the century ahead. We prepare our students to confront unforeseen challenges, to explore fields of study that are only now in their infancy, to thrive and succeed in careers that don’t yet exist.\""
