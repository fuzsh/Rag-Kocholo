        "text": "High school in Union County, New Jersey, United States\n\nWestfield Senior High School (WHS, or Westfield High School) is a comprehensive public high school located in Westfield, in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in ninth through twelfth grades as the lone secondary school of the Westfield Public Schools. It was established in the early 1900s at its original location on Elm Street until 1951 when it was moved to its current location on Dorian Road. The new wing designated for biology, chemistry, physics, and other sciences, along with English as a Second Language (ESL) was completed in 2002. Westfield High School is overseen by the New Jersey Department of Education. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.[3]\n\nAs of the 2022–23 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,818 students and 150.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.1:1. There were 30 students (1.7% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 7 (0.4% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.[2]\n\nIn 2023, the administration of Westfield High School was criticized for failing to address cyber harassment. In a report by the Associated Press, several AI-generated nudes of some 14-year-old female students had been distributed among fellow students. The school refused to take action to suspend the perpetrators or address the cyber sexual harassment, despite pleas from the victims and their families.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first high school in Westfield was the old brick academy on Mountain Avenue opposite the Presbyterian Church, a town landmark. The minister of the church was the supervisor of it and all the schools in Westfield.\n\nThe history of the high school began in 1869 with the opening of the old Prospect School which, at that time, had a staff of five teachers. For the few students who were preparing for college, the school principal taught Latin, Greek, higher mathematics and science. The other teachers taught the elementary subjects. On March 2, 1880, the Board of Education, in its formal minutes, made the first direct reference to a high school in Westfield. When the Lincoln School on Academy Place was erected in 1890, classes of high school level were transferred to it.\n\nIn 1900, the high school department was transferred to the newly opened Washington School on Elm Street. Shortly afterward, a regular full four-year high school program, which received state approval, was organized. The high school became an independent unit in January 1916, when it moved to the Elm Street building. The program, chiefly college preparatory, was offered to 306 students by 11 teachers. That year there were 39 students in the graduating class.\n\nIn 1923 when the present Roosevelt Intermediate School was opened, Westfield adopted the 6-3-3 plan and designated the Elm Street building, now containing grades 10, 11 and 12, as Westfield High School. Frank N. Neubauer was designated principal, and he remained in that office until his death in 1947.\n\nDuring this time a library was established, a program in athletics and physical education was developed, and opportunities for outstanding experiences in art, industrial arts, music, speech, and dramatics were expanded. It was in this period that guidance services became an integral part of the program, and pupil activities grew to include publications, clubs, social events and student government. In 1947 Robert L. Foose became the second principal of the high school.\n\nBy the late 1940s the Elm Street building had become much too small for the ever-growing student body. Students were being housed in the Elm Street building, the old Washington School as an annex, and two temporary structures on Walnut Street. To maintain and expand Westfield's high educational standards and experiences, a new high school building became imperative.\n\nThe present building on Dorian Road was opened on February 4, 1952. The staff, consisting of 42 teachers, taught 725 students in three curricula: business education, college preparatory, and general. In the first commencement from the new building, 203 students were graduated.\n\nRapid growth in student enrollment necessitated further expansion. In September 1960, the high school gained an addition consisting of 17 new classrooms, two gymnasiums and a cafeteria. In the 1970s, four additional classrooms were added by the acquisition of the two portable buildings on Trinity Place. In 1962 Westfield instituted its first summer school program which was approved by the State Department of Education.\n\nWith the retirement of Dr. Foose in 1969, Albert R. Bobal became the school's third principal. During the 1970s, each academic department opened its resource center where students could work independently or seek tutorial assistance from teachers. The Department of Special Services opened resource rooms at the high school so that specially trained teachers could help special needs youngsters to succeed. In 1979 Project 79, an alternative school-within-a-school, was created for at-risk students of average or above average ability.\n\nOn November 9, 1971, John List murdered his wife, and mother and two other children and then drove to Westfield High School to watch his elder son John Jr., 15, play in a soccer game. After driving John Jr. home, List shot him repeatedly because, as misfire evidence showed, his son attempted to defend himself.[8][9]\n\nIn 1980, Dr. Robert G. Petix was named the fourth principal of Westfield High School, a position which he maintained until his retirement in June 2006, making him Westfield High School's longest-serving principal. During the 1980s and 1990s, several new additions to the facility and grounds were made, including renovated playing fields outdoors, updated science labs, a new and expanded library/media center, several state-of-the-art computer labs, and a technological infrastructure of approximately 300 networked computers with Internet access. With the opening of the 1988–89 academic year, Westfield High School welcomed ninth graders to its halls for the first time.\n\nThe last decade of the 20th century was marked by substantial increases in enrollment in the elementary schools that necessitated the construction of additions to all but one of the district's six elementary school buildings. During the first year of the new millennium Westfield taxpayers approved a $22 million referendum bond to accommodate the arrival of these enrollment increases at Westfield High School.\n\nConstruction at the high school began during the summer of 2001 with the replacement of all windows and the conversion of two former shop classrooms into four large classrooms for use during the 2001–02 school year. By the spring of 2002, the \"portable\" classrooms on Trinity Place had been razed in preparation for the construction of a three-story Science wing which began following a ground breaking ceremony in April 2002. At the same time, construction also began inside the existing building. By the end of the summer, a new Student Center and an Art studio classroom had been created by extending the building into the main courtyard, and a renovated Foods Lab was ready to greet students. Work on the expansion of athletic storage facilities and the creation of new teacher work and preparation areas was also finished.\n\nWith construction of the new Science wing completed in the spring of 2003, classes in the existing science classrooms and labs in the main building were moved to their new location in the new wing. During the summer of 2003, work was completed on the renovation and air-conditioning of the former science classrooms for use as general purpose classrooms, as well as on other aspects of the referendum construction project, including the creation of a Counseling Suite for the departments of Guidance and Special Education, the expansion of administrative offices, and the renovation of the varsity gymnasium floor and replacement of bleachers.\n\nIn July 2008, Westfield High School welcomed its fifth principal, Peter Renwick.[10] Renwick retired in 2017, and was replaced by Dr. Derrick Nelson, the sixth principal of the high school. On April 8, 2019, school officials announced that Dr. Nelson had died on April 7 after donating bone marrow.[11]\n\nMary Asfendis was named in June 2019 as the seventh Westfield High School principal.[12]\n\nIn December 2021, swastikas were found twice in the school's bathrooms in less than a week.[13] A similar incident happened in March 2022.[14]\n\nAwards, recognition and rankings\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1928, Westfield High School was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the first group of high schools to be accredited by this association. It was also, at this time, established as a center for the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB). Westfield High School is one of the few schools in the nation to hold over 80 consecutive years of accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.[10]\n\nFor the 1994–95 school year, Westfield High School was named as a \"Star School\" by the New Jersey Department of Education, the highest honor that a New Jersey school can achieve.[15]\n\nThe school was the 21st-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology.[16] The school had been ranked 49th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being the 49th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 328 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's 2012 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", after being ranked 41st in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.[17] The magazine ranked the school 27th in 2008 out of 316 schools.[18] The school was ranked 22nd in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which included 316 schools across the state.[19]\n\nSchooldigger.com ranked the school tied for 55th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 12 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (91.9%) and language arts literacy (96.9%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).[20]\n\nIn its listing of \"America's Best High Schools 2016\", the school was ranked 67th out of 500 best high schools in the country; it was ranked 14th among all high schools in New Jersey and second among the state's non-magnet schools.[21]\n\nIn its 2013 report on \"America's Best High Schools\", The Daily Beast ranked the school 356th in the nation among participating public high schools and 30th among schools in New Jersey.[22]\n\nIn the 2011 \"Ranking America's High Schools\" issue by The Washington Post, the school was ranked 25th in New Jersey and 865th nationwide.[23]\n\nWestfield was listed in 29th place nationwide in Newsweek's 2014 listing of the Top High Schools in America, after finishing in 691st place nationwide in Newsweek 's May 8, 2006, issue, listing the Top 1,200 High Schools in the United States.[24]\n\nThe school has a Theatre Department.\n\nCourses\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield High School offers a comprehensive program of some 165 different courses and 18 Advanced Placement (AP) classes. Some of these classes include business, fine arts, music, and practical arts. Advanced Placement classes are available in AP English Literature and Composition, AP English Language and Composition, AP Spanish Literature, AP French Language, AP Latin Literature, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Computer Science AB, AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Physics I, AP United States History, AP United States Government and Politics, AP European History, AP Environmental Science and AP Psychology.\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\n[edit]\n\n80% of the students participate in co-curricular activities, including 60 different co-curricular activities and 27 varsity athletic teams.\n\nThe school's marching band won the USBands Group V A national championship in 2015 with their program The Caged Bird Sings.[25]\n\nThe band finished second at the 2021 New Jersey Marching Band Directors Association State Championships with the program \"Swipe Up\".[26]\n\nThe band finished second at the 2023 New Jersey Marching Band Directors Association State Championships with the program \"Unstoppable\".[27]\n\nStudent publications\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Westfield High School students produce a number of different publications, including the weekly Hi's Eye student newspaper which is run by four editors, and the Iris magazine. The newspaper maintains its independence through subscriptions, community sponsors, independent fundraising and advertising. Since 1983, Westfield High School students have operated a public-access television cable TV station producing live and single-camera productions.[citation needed] In addition, the literary magazine Folio, the Weather Vane yearbook, and original theatre scripts are also produced by the students.\n\nHi's Eye\n\n[edit]\n\nHi's Eye is the student-run weekly newspaper at Westfield High School and is New Jersey's only weekly uncensored student newspaper, and one of the few uncensored school publications in the entire country.[28][29] Hi's Eye has an editorial staff of Print Journalism seniors and is free from administrative prior review. The paper was established in 1935. It publishes 30 issues per year with four sections: news, opinion, features, and arts and entertainment. Historically, the arts and entertainment section was a special monthly edition but in 2022 became a part of the regular production when the sports section was removed and became a separate, online-only, publication Hi's Eye is unique among many student run newspapers in that it is weekly, and that it is completely self-funded.\n\nIn September 2011, Hi's Eye unveiled a new online version. Hi's Eye aims to use the website to reach readers more often, and with more news that perhaps cannot always fit in the print version. The blog, which consists of weekly opinion articles, was created in May 2014. In September 2014, Hi's Eye created a Facebook Page, Twitter account, and Instagram account in hopes to reach a broader audience.\n\nHi's Eye has won numerous national awards and recognitions from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, American Scholastic Press Association, National Scholastic Press Association, and the New Jersey American Civil Liberties Union. Hi's Eye received First Place with Special Merit from the ASPA for the 2011-2012 school year, a Pacemaker Award from NSPA for 2013, the Gold Medal by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association for 2013-2014 and an All-American honor rating by the National Scholastic Press Association.[30][31]\n\nVarsity sports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Westfield High School Blue Devils[4] compete in the Union County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, which comprises public and private high schools in Union County and was established following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).[32] Prior to the NJSIAA's 2010 realignment, the school had participated in the Watchung Conference, a high school sports association which included public high schools in Essex, Hudson and Union counties.[33] With 1,398 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Group IV for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 1,060 to 5,049 students in that grade range.[34] The football team competes in Division 5A of the Big Central Football Conference, which includes 60 public and private high schools in Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Warren counties, which are broken down into 10 divisions by size and location.[35] The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Group V North for football for 2022–2024, which included schools with 1,313 to 5,304 students.[36]\n\nWestfield High School has 28 varsity interscholastic athletic teams, including baseball, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls cross-country, field hockey, football, gymnastics, golf, ice hockey, boys and girls lacrosse, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls swimming, boys and girls tennis, softball, spring track and field, boys and girls volleyball, wrestling, cheerleading and winter track, among others.[4] Their main rival in sports are the Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School Raiders, while Cranford and Plainfield both consider Westfield its biggest rival as well.[37] Westfield's football rivalry with Plainfield dates back to 1900, making it one of the oldest active public high school football rivalry in the state.[38] The rivalry with Plainfield was listed at 17th on NJ.com's 2017 list \"Ranking the 31 fiercest rivalries in N.J. HS football\". Westfield leads the rivalry with a 60-45-7 record as of 2017.[39]\n\nThe school was recognized by the NJSIAA as the Group IV winner of the Seventh Annual ShopRite Cup in 2009–10, based on the overall performances of the school's athletic teams which included first-place finishes in girls' tennis, boys' cross country, girls' swimming and boys' tennis; second place in girls' soccer and tied for third in football, plus bonus points for having no disqualifications for the winter and spring seasons.[40]\n\nThe boys track team won the spring / outdoor track state championship in Group III in 1940 and the Group IV title in 1977.[41]\n\nThe boys cross country team won the Group IV state title in 1963, 1966, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1979-1981, 1995, 1996, 2009-2011.
