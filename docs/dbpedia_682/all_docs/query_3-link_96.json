        "text": "HOLYOKE — Holyoke Public Schools is gathering suggestions for potential names and mascots for the new middle school building through a new survey released.\n\nThe short survey asks the public to give suggestions on a new name and mascot and the reasoning why the suggestions should be considered. After suggestions are collected and the list is narrowed, another survey will be shared where people can select their favorite among finalist options. From there, a subcommittee will make a recommendation to the School Committee and City Council on the name of the school.\n\n“School Committee members recognize the importance of community engagement in naming a new school, so they tasked the DEI subcommittee with developing an inclusive process for naming the new school,” School Committee member Dr. Yadilette Rivera-Colón told Reminder Publishing. Rivera-Colón is also chair of the subcommittee leading the school renaming effort.\n\nShe continued, “This provides an opportunity to create a school identity that reflects the values and aspirations of our community. We believe this process will help foster a sense of ownership and pride among our residents.”\n\nRivera-Colón added the school’s original name of William R. Peck School will still be under consideration along with new submissions through the survey.\n\nThe following criteria will be considered when selecting an appropriate name for the new school:\n\nHistorical figure, place, event or other instance of historical or cultural significance.\n\nNational and state historical leaders or heroes, both past and present.\n\nIndividual, living or deceased, who has contributed outstanding civic service to the city, especially service in education.\n\nName that signifies the values of the city (e.g. Holyoke School of Excellence.\n\nThe suggestions from the first survey will be reviewed by a small group that will likely include families, students and staff who will be part of the new school community, according to Rivera-Colón, along with members of the DEI subcommittee, Soto and an HPS Cabinet member, plus Mayor Joshua Garcia and potentially a City Council member.\n\nThis review is scheduled to take place on Sept. 11, a week after the Sept. 4 deadline for survey submissions.\n\n“Members of the School Committee and City Council hope to finalize the name of the new school by November,” Rivera-Colón said. “Superintendent Anthony Soto and his team hope to finalize the school colors and mascot by November, as well.”\n\nProgress continues at new middle school construction site\n\nSoto, superintendent and receiver, shared through the districts’ weekly newsletter that significant process has continued on the construction of the new middle school building.\n\n“No longer just a steel skeleton, the school is taking form with roof elements and second floor concrete deckings now in place. Construction work remains on track, and before long the building will be fully enclosed,” Soto said.\n\nDuring this time, more than 350 cubic yards of concrete has been poured to form the second story deck on the northern side of the new building. The new school is a two-story, 107,475-square-foot school that will serve 550 middle school students.\n\nOther summer improvement projects\n\nWhile a new school continues to be built, current schools all over the city are seeing work done this summer to improve overall quality. Donahue, McMahon and Lawrence schools are seeing new windows installed this summer, along with other construction and maintenance projects across the district.\n\nHPS Operations and Facilities staff are leading these projects in partnership with outside vendors selected to assist with the work following a bidding process.\n\nSullivan School will see an upgraded basketball pavilion added, which in turn will make the school’s facilities more suitable for middle school students. Dean Technical High School is receiving a new boiler system. According to the district, crews have already removed the old system and pour new concrete slabs in preparation for the arrival of the new boiler in coming weeks.\n\nAll work will be completed before the beginning of the new school year and quality inspections will ensure that every aspect of the improvements is up to code."
