We generally play two days a week with games against other towns on the weekends in both the fall and spring. However, the main season is the spring and usually involves some fun travel events!\n\nMost players find this sport in middle school or afterwards, so it is a great time to begin!\n\nQuestions? Contact westfieldultimate@gmail.com\n\nFall 2024 Information:\n\nThe Fall 2024 season will have practices on Mondays and Thursdays from mid September to end of October 4 to 5:30 at Sycamore Field. From there, players can sign up for weekend games as their schedule allows. We hope people can make as many games as possible. We will develop two sets of teams. We will have Westfield 1 and Westfield 2 which are our teams split evenly skill wise. The second set of teams will be Westfield A and Westfield B which is split by skill / age level. Everyone will be on two of those teams. The game schedule dictates which split we are using:\n\n2024 FALL REGISTRATION\n\nThis registers you for payment and waivers for the two practices a week plus home and away games in blue on our calendar\n\nThis forms confirms which games you can/can't attend. We completely understand that everybody cannot make every game, but it's helpful to have accurate attendance. We will be splitting into teams and we use people's availability to make teams so we have enough players each time.\n\n2024 FALLEXTRA PROGRAMS/TRIPS\n\nOur HS Team practices on Tuesdays from 3:30 to 5:30 at Jefferson from Sept 17th through Oct 29th. Some advanced MS Players can participate with them on Tuesdays if you are interested. The reasons for participating might be for an extra challenge, to add a 3rd day a week instead of 2, or to add Tuesdays because you have a constant conflict on Mondays or Thursday. If you have questions, please reach out (or read the google form carefully).\n\nOur personalized Jersey store will be open through Sep 12th. Most people have a blue jersey that is blank on the back. If you are thinking about playing long term and want to add a name/number, then please email westfieldultimate@gmail.com with your preferred number if you don't already have one. There are some extra items such as sweatshirts, pinnies, white jerseys, and crew necks."
