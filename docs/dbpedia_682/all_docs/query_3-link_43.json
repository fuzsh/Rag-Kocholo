With the addition of Kindergarten and 1st Grade the school is extremely overcrowded and the commute to each class is always a hassle. The food isn't extremely bad, but can definitely be hit or miss sometimes. The admin has 0 trust in the students and have blocked almost every website you can image on the school chromebooks. The HSP program at Link is one of my favorite aspects of the school and really sets up each kid to be successful. Programs such as The Wight Foundation and SEEDS really set you up for success. Academics should be more personalized and tailored to each student because some higher level kids end up being held back and can't reach their full potential because of the cirriculum. The arts program here is really good. At the end of the day, I feel like Link itself isn't a bad school, just the kids that come through the program come in with what I call \"The Newark Baggage\" which makes it harder for the school to... .\n\nRead 6 reviews.\n\nOverall Niche Grade : C+ ,\n\nStudents : 400 ,\n\nStudent-Teacher Ratio : 9 to 1 ,\n\nUnion County TEAMS Charter School\n\nPublic School ,\n\nPLAINFIELD, NJ ,\n\nK-12 ,\n\n48 Niche users give it an average review of 3.1 stars.\n\nFeatured Review: Senior says A school environment plays a pivotal role in shaping students' experiences and fostering their growth.
