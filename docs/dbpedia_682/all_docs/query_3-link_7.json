All of the programs and activities for the Middle School students serve to support the schoolâ€™s mission. The curriculum included at these grade levels prepares the student for the college preparatory curriculum of the Upper School at Westfield.\n\nThe Middle School academic program is designed to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of adolescents and to encourage and assist in developing skills that will prepare them for transition to the Upper School. Curriculum materials are selected from various publishers to give a well-balanced and thorough preparation at each grade level."
