This board, composed of 13 dedicated student members (grades 5-12), has engaged in meaningful discussions and collaborative work to help shape the future of our district.\n\nOur final meeting of the academic year was held last Wednesday at the District Office, where we celebrated our achievements, finalized the district anti-racism statement, and planned for the next year.\n\nThe sessions were thoughtfully designed and led by our two School Board Representatives, Dennis and Alex. They dedicated time outside of the sessions to plan and prepare materials for the group, ensuring that each meeting was productive and engaging.\n\nMeeting Highlights\n\nFirst Meeting: We kicked off our first meeting by discussing what anti-racism means to each of us and sharing personal experiences within our schools. We also established a community agreement to guide our interactions and ensure a respectful and productive environment.\n\nSecond Meeting: The board identified three key focus areas: safety, academic policies, and student-teacher relations. We delved into how school safety impacts students individually and within their communities, sharing observed safety concerns in our schools.\n\nThird Meeting: We continued our discussions on school safety, examined its effects on our communities, and started identifying potential solutions for the concerns raised by students.\n\nFinal Meeting and Celebration: Our final session focused on celebrating our work together, finalizing the district anti-racism statement, and planning for the upcoming year.\n\nThe Superintendent's Student Advisory Board has provided a valuable platform for student voices to be heard and for impactful changes to be discussed.

This prestigious recognition is a testament to Julie's unwavering commitment and passion for supporting our students and families.\n\nJulie's journey into education began with a background in Health Information Management. Her true calling emerged when her youngest child started kindergarten in the Aberdeen School District, where she began volunteering in the classroom. This initial experience led her to become a paraeducator and eventually transition into a Library Tech position. During her four years as a Library Tech, Julie discovered her love for helping children develop a passion for reading.\n\nAfter relocating to the Puget Sound area, Julie joined the Tukwila School District as a paraeducator. She then advanced to the role of Assessment Specialist before taking on her current position as Quality Engagement Specialist for the past seven years. Throughout her over 17-year career in education, Julie has been a relentless advocate for students facing homelessness, foster care, and economic challenges. She has dedicated herself to breaking down barriers to education and ensuring that students have access to basic needs such as housing, food, and clothing.\n\nJulie's advocacy extends beyond our district as she partners with organizations like School House Washington, Road Map Project for Family Engagement, and Building Changes. Her expertise has been sought after at numerous trainings to guide other school districts on McKinney-Vento data practices and the importance of building community relationships. Additionally, Julie serves on the City of Tukwila Human Services Advisory Board, further demonstrating her dedication to community engagement and support.\n\nJulie works alongside Maryan Abdow, our other devoted Quality Engagement Specialist, to serve our growing McKinney-Vento population. Their combined dedication and authentic care for our students and families are truly commendable.\n\nWe are incredibly fortunate to have Julie as part of our Tukwila School District family.

Each eligible child will receive a one-time payment of $120 in food benefits on a dedicated SUN Bucks card. This initiative aims to ensure that students have access to nutritious meals throughout the summer months.\n\nHow to Access SUN Bucks:\n\nEligibility and Enrollment: Families already enrolled in benefits like SNAP, TANF, or FDPIR will automatically enroll their school-age children in SUN Bucks if the program is available in their area. Additionally, children attending schools that offer the National School Lunch Program or School Breakfast Program may also be automatically enrolled if they meet the income requirements for free or reduced-price meals.\n\nApplication Process: If not automatically enrolled, families can apply directly for SUN Bucks by meeting the necessary income limits and other requirements.\n\nBenefit Distribution: SUN Bucks will be issued from mid-June through the end of August 2024. Once qualified, families will receive an approval notice and a SUN Bucks EBT card within seven to 10 business days via U.S. Mail.\n\nExpiration: Benefits expire 122 days from issuance, so it's important to use SUN Bucks before they are removed.\n\nFor detailed information and additional questions about S-EBT benefits, families can visit the DSHS SUN Bucks webpage at: https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer/sunbucks or call the S-EBT Contact Center at (833) 543-3230 between 8 am and 5 pm Monday–Friday (except observed holidays). Schools are encouraged to share this information with families through communication channels such as social media, emails, and other outreach methods. By spreading the word, we can ensure that families and communities who qualify for the free lunch program are well-informed and can benefit from this vital support.\n\nTogether, let's ensure that our students have a healthy and nutritious summer!\n\nTSD Communications\n\nWe are thrilled to share the success of our recent Afghan Family Nights, held on April 18th and May 9th, which saw more than 50 families and students in attendance. These events were organized by our dedicated Community Liaison, Zia, who has been a steadfast support for Afghan families throughout the year.\n\nZia's efforts in coordinating these gatherings have been invaluable. Not only did he bring together our Afghan community, but he also invited representatives from various community organizations to connect families with essential resources. These connections are crucial in helping our families feel supported and integrated into the Tukwila School District (TSD) community.\n\nThe success of Afghan Family Nights highlights the importance of community engagement and the positive impact of having dedicated liaisons like Zia. His work, along with that of all our Community Liaisons, has been instrumental in making TSD a welcoming and supportive environment for all families.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the dedication and hard work of Zia and our entire Community Liaison team.

Set against the backdrop of Foster High School's state-of-the-art Performing Arts Center, this production was a testament to the talent, dedication, and diversity of our school community.\n\nFrom the opening scene to the final bow, the stage was alive with drama, music, and laughter, captivating the hearts of all who attended. Congratulations are in order for all Cascade View scholars and staff who were involved in making this production a resounding success.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the performance was the inclusion of lines spoken in students' home languages, adding a unique TSD element to the production. This celebration of linguistic diversity not only enriched the performance but also served as a powerful reminder of the strength and beauty of our truly diverse community.\n\nBehind the scenes, Cascade View Elementary's 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders, along with six dedicated staff members, worked tirelessly for six months to prepare for this production. Their hard work, perseverance, and teamwork were evident in every aspect of the performance, from the choreography to the costumes to the musical arrangements.\n\nAs we reflect on this unforgettable experience, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to everyone involved in bringing \"The Lion King\" to life at Cascade View Elementary.

What we didn’t know at the time was the full extent of the work ahead in regards, mostly, to the financial health of our district. We could not have asked for a better person for this time than Dr. Concie Pedroza.\n\nWhen we began our interim superintendent search, we sought input from the school community to understand the qualities most desired in a superintendent. Consistency, visibility, and a commitment to student and community engagement emerged as key themes. Dr. Pedroza exemplifies these qualities and more, making her the ideal leader to guide us through the tough decisions and actions required to stabilize our district's finances.\n\nOur district is currently facing a significant budget deficit and is under binding conditions for at least two years. During this time, we must take decisive action to address our financial challenges. Dr. Pedroza has already demonstrated her dedication to putting students first and implementing strategies to move us forward. Here are just a few of the highlights:\n\nEstablished the first Superintendent Student Advisory Group\n\nAll Staff Kick 0ff - Prioritizing anti-racist actions as a district and in schools\n\nIncreasing collaboration and communication across the district through:\n\nAttending school staff meetings\n\nWeekly staff updates\n\nOngoing 1:1’s with members of cabinet with the intention of creating clearer goals and alignment across departments\n\nVisibility in community and schools\n\nAttended parent groups, visible at many school events,\n\nParticipates in or is present at community board meetings (TCF, Still Water, Rotary, etc)\n\nHas increased and continues to embed equity and anti-racist practices into all facets of the organization - including more intentional and aligned PD for school leaders\n\nThe Board has determined that it is in the best interest of the district, based on feedback and input expressed by students, staff and families, and the current work over the next two years necessary for the sustainability and longevity of our district, to bring forward a resolution appointing Dr. Concie Pedroza as our Superintendent. Superintendent contracts are typically signed for a three-year term to allow leaders to make a meaningful impact. At the end of year two, we will engage extensively with our district community to consider the potential extension of the Superintendent's contract.\n\nWe remain committed to transparency and accountability, ensuring that the voices of those most impacted by our decisions are heard. Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Tukwila School District Board of Directors\n\nCarlee Hoover (they/them), President, District 1\n\nCharley Simpson, Vice President, District 4\n\nTerrence Proctor, District 3\n\nDave Larson, Legislative Rep, District 5\n\ntsdboard@tukwila.wednet.edu\n\nTSD Communications\n\nAt Tukwila Elementary, Mrs. Kodis-Fisher's 3rd-grade class embarked on an exhilarating adventure into the captivating world of animals. Over the past month, these eager learners immersed themselves in research, writing, and creative expression, resulting in an enriching and memorable animal project.\n\nGuided by their curiosity and Mrs. Kodis-Fisher's expert guidance, students selected animals to study. With enthusiasm and dedication, they delved into the lives and habitats of their chosen creatures, gathering information and insights to shape their understanding. Their efforts culminated in detailed 8-paragraph reports, adorned with photos and personalized glossaries—a testament to their hard work and commitment to learning.\n\nBut the exploration didn't end there. In Mrs. Kodis-Fisher's class, students delved deeper into the complex relationship between humans and animals. Through thought-provoking discussions, they examined how human actions can impact animal environments, sparking conversations about conservation, habitat preservation, and environmental stewardship.\n\nTo further reinforce learning and strengthen the home-school connection, students engaged in a hands-on activity: the creation of animal dioramas. These imaginative displays brought their research to life, showcasing their understanding of animal habitats and the organisms that inhabit them.\n\nThe culmination of their efforts was celebrated at Tukwila Elementary's classroom zoo event. Families, administrators, and community members were invited to explore the diverse array of animals through captivating presentations prepared by the students themselves. It was a joyous celebration of learning, creativity, and collaboration—a testament to the hard work and dedication of Mrs. Kodis-Fisher's class.\n\nAs the project came to a close, students engaged in self-reflection, evaluating their performance and considering what they had learned. They also shared suggestions for future classes, offering insights to enhance future projects and learning experiences.\n\nThe animal project at Tukwila Elementary exemplifies the power of hands-on, inquiry-based learning to engage students, foster curiosity, and inspire creativity. It is a testament to the dedication of teachers like Mrs. Kodis-Fisher and the boundless potential of our students to explore, learn, and grow.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nWe are delighted to share the resounding success of our recent Parent Education Series event, where families had the opportunity to explore the intricacies of navigating the Skyward Technology platform with expert guidance.

They learned how to navigate the system with ease, leverage its resources effectively, and make the most of its capabilities to support their child's academic journey.\n\nThe event also served as a platform for families to connect with one another, share experiences, and build a supportive network within our school community. By coming together to learn and collaborate, families reaffirmed their commitment to their child's education and demonstrated the power of collective engagement.\n\nAs we reflect on the success of the Parent Education Series event, we extend our heartfelt appreciation to our Community Liaisons for their unwavering dedication and exemplary service. Their leadership and guidance were instrumental in making this event a meaningful and impactful experience for all involved.\n\nMoving forward, we remain committed to providing ongoing support and resources to empower families in navigating the ever-evolving landscape of education technology. Together, we will continue to strengthen our partnership between home and school, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive and succeed.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nIn a stirring tribute to Black History Month, students from Showalter Middle School and Rainier Beach High School embarked on a poignant journey through the Northwest African American Museum (NAAM), accompanied by Seattle Seahawks player, Matt Gotel. This meaningful field trip not only celebrated the rich tapestry of African American heritage but also provided a profound opportunity for reflection, education, and cultural exchange.\n\nThe museum's exhibits offered a window into the diverse experiences and contributions of African Americans throughout history. In the words of the museum:\n\n\"In 'Freedom of Expression,' the Northwest African American Museum features a variety of rotating talented artists. This exhibit showcases the strength and range of visual artistic expression produced by artists of African descent residing in the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\n\"In 'Positive Frequencies,' artists delve deeper into the profound impact of music on our lives. Through these intricate mixed media pieces, they aim to capture the essence of different musical genres, representing the diverse array of emotions and experiences they evoke.\"\n\n\"Making a Way: The Jacob Lawrence and the Northwest Black Experience\" offers a compelling journey through pivotal moments in Black history, as reflected in the classic work of Jacob Lawrence.\n\nAccompanied by Matt Gotel, students engaged in meaningful dialogue and reflection, drawing inspiration from his personal journey and experiences.\n\nAs the field trip coincided with the start of Black History Month, it served as a poignant reminder of the ongoing quest for justice, equality, and inclusion. Through education, dialogue, and shared experiences, students were empowered to become agents of change in their communities and beyond.\n\nAs we continue to honor Black History Month beyond the month of February, let us reaffirm our commitment to celebrating the richness and diversity of African American culture. May this catalyze meaningful conversations, transformative learning experiences, and a renewed dedication to building a more equitable and inclusive society.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nWe are thrilled to extend our heartfelt congratulations to Preston Hopp, a senior at Foster High School, for his outstanding achievement in making it to the prestigious Washington Music Educators Association (WMEA) All-State Wind Symphony this year!\n\nOver President’s Day Weekend, Preston had the incredible opportunity to join a select group of talented musicians from across Washington State. Under the guidance of Dr. Kaitlin Bove from Diablo Valley College, the Wind Symphony delivered breathtaking performances, showcasing a diverse repertoire that included a Suite of Squamish Music.\n\nPreston's dedication and musical prowess shone brightly as he secured the 1st chair position in his section, among eleven exceptionally talented young musicians. His remarkable talent even earned him a small solo during the performance!\n\nReflecting on his experience, Preston shared, \"I had a great experience. It was a lot of fun to play with such a big band and get to know people from all over the state. I wore my cross-country sweatshirt and met some people that run for other schools. This was such a cool experience, and I'm really glad I chose to audition. I wish I had done it sooner.\"\n\nPreston's journey to the All-State Wind Symphony not only exemplifies his musical excellence but also highlights the power of stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing new opportunities. His enthusiasm and dedication serve as an inspiration to his peers and the entire community.\n\nAs a district, we take immense pride in Preston's achievement and commend him for his hard work, talent, and commitment to excellence.

Congratulations on a job well done! 🎉👏\n\nTSD Communications\n\nIn the heart of our district, a beacon of hope shines brightly through Still Waters Services, a vital organization dedicated to supporting families in transition. Founded in 2016, Still Waters emerged from humble origins in a church to address the pressing need for sustenance among students transitioning from the foster care system. At its core, Still Waters strives to ensure every child is nourished and prepared for the challenges of learning.\n\nAbigail, the dedicated Executive Director and parent to two Tukwila Elementary students, embodies the spirit of advocacy and compassion that defines Still Waters. Her personal journey, rooted in the Philippines where she taught and experienced constant transition, fuels her passion for serving those in need. Recognizing the struggles of students in transition housing, Abigail saw a gap in access to basic nutrition and sprung into action.\n\nThe Tukwila Weekend Snack Pack Program, a cornerstone of Still Waters' initiatives, brings much-needed sustenance to our students. Designed to fill the hunger gap during weekends and holidays, these snack packs are carefully curated to offer nutritional value and cultural alignment. From elementary to middle school, students benefit from these packs, which have expanded beyond their original scope to ensure no child goes hungry.\n\nBut the impact of Still Waters extends far beyond the contents of these packs. Families express profound gratitude for the support, noting the essential role these snacks play in supplementing their meals. Students, too, find solace in knowing they are seen and heard, fostering a sense of belonging within our community.\n\nCentral to the success of Still Waters are the volunteers who selflessly dedicate their time and effort. Every Wednesday morning, a team of volunteers converges to prepare and distribute over 5000 items to families in need. From stocking shelves to delivering packs to classrooms, these volunteers form the backbone of Still Waters, ensuring its mission is realized.\n\nYet, Still Waters' commitment to uplifting students’ voices sets it apart. Through innovative initiatives like the Viking Pantry at Showalter Middle School, students are empowered to make choices and voice their needs. Middle school volunteers and high school athletes from Foster Football actively engage with the organization, amplifying student representation and leadership.\n\nCommunity involvement stands as a pillar of sustainability for Still Waters. Partnerships with local businesses and organizations, like Westfield and BECU, bolster their efforts through donations and volunteerism. Yet, there is always room for more support and engagement, as Still Waters continues to serve as a beacon of hope for our community.\n\nAs we reflect on the profound impact of Still Waters, let us reaffirm our commitment to supporting and uplifting one another. Together, we can nourish the hearts and minds of our students, empowering them to thrive and succeed. Join us in our mission to make a difference and create a brighter future for all.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nDear Tukwila School District Community,\n\nI am writing to you with great enthusiasm and a deep sense of commitment as the newly appointed Principal of Foster High School. I am honored to serve this vibrant community I hold dear to my heart.\n\nAllow me to introduce myself. My name is LaTanya Parker, and I come to this role as a highly collaborative, equity-driven leader of color. As a mother of three sons and a wife, family is at the core of my values. I am a proud graduate of the University of Washington's Danforth Educational Leadership Program, and my journey in education spans over 16 years. During this time, I have had the privilege of serving scholars and families in K-8, elementary, and high schools within the Southeast Seattle communities.\n\nHaving been a former resident of Tukwila, I intimately understand the special and unique qualities that define this diverse community. This understanding has been a driving force behind my decision to serve here for the past three years, first as the assistant principal and now as the principal of Foster High School.\n\nMy passion and dedication revolve around ensuring that all scholars, especially those furthest from educational justice, receive an enjoyable and equitable learning experience. I am committed to highlighting the genius and brilliance of our scholars and families in the classroom and woven throughout the district in our instruction, curriculum, decisions, and actions.\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, I deeply understand the significance of how representation, identity, sense of belonging, and belief from educators play a crucial role in determining whether scholars show up to school, contribute their genius, and feel genuinely seen, which can impact their academic success.\n\nMy vision for every scholar who graduates from Foster High School is for them to feel confident in their abilities and equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to implement their post-secondary plans. I want them to leave Foster not as mere student ID numbers, grades, or transcripts but as change agents, knowing that regardless of how they entered Foster, our educators genuinely care and believe in their ability to succeed in life.\n\nI envision every Foster Bulldog walking with purpose, heads held high, and entering their next phase of life reflecting on the empowering words of James Baldwin, \"Your crown has been bought and paid for. Put it on your head and wear it.\"\n\nIn partnership with you, the families, and the Foster High School community, I look forward to fostering an environment where each scholar's potential is recognized, celebrated, and nourished.\n\nThank you for your warm welcome, and I am excited to continue this journey with you.\n\nPrincipal LaTanya Parker\n\nTSD Communications\n\nIn the spirit of fostering unity and celebrating diversity, Showalter Middle School commenced the new year with a powerful event - the Week of Solidarity in January.

Our students, with their distinct visions and voices, embody the spirit of future leaders poised to shape a world marked by equality, understanding, and unity.\n\nJoin us in celebrating the spirit of solidarity at Showalter Middle School. As we honor Black History Month, let's collectively champion a future where every voice is heard, every perspective is valued, and positive change becomes our shared legacy.\n\nTSD Communication\n\nEarlier this month, Thorndyke Elementary School buzzed with excitement as the community gathered for the grand opening of their new playground. The vibrant structure, made possible by a voter-approved bond, replaced a decaying play area that was no longer safe for the Eagles, as the students are fondly known.\n\nLaughter and joy filled the air as students explored the colorful slides and swings. The highlight of the day was a special student who, with a beaming smile, cut the ribbon, officially inaugurating the playground. It was a symbolic moment, marking a commitment to the safety and well-being of the Eagles.\n\nThe event showcased the power of community unity, with parents, teachers, and community members celebrating together. The new playground wasn't just a recreational space; it was a testament to the resilience of a community dedicated to providing the best for its students.\n\nIn the weeks following, the sounds of laughter echo daily as children enjoyed their new play area. Thorndyke Elementary's playground standa as a symbol of transformation, a beacon of joy, and a testament to the positive impact that can result from collective community efforts.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nIn a dazzling display of cultural richness and unity, Foster High School recently hosted a Multicultural Assembly, providing students with a platform to showcase their diverse talents. The event, held in December, brought together a tapestry of traditions, highlighting the unique cultural heritage within our school community.\n\nThe assembly was a testament to the vibrant tapestry that makes up the Foster High School family. From captivating dance performances to soul-stirring musical renditions, students poured their hearts into sharing the beauty of their backgrounds. This celebration not only honored the diverse roots of our student body but also fostered a deeper sense of understanding and appreciation among peers.\n\nBeyond the colorful performances, the Multicultural Assembly served as a reminder that our differences are a source of strength, contributing to the rich fabric of our school community. As we look back on this event, we celebrate the talents, traditions, and the unity that define Foster High School, where every voice is heard, and every culture is embraced.\n\nThis multicultural showcase not only added a burst of energy and joy to our school halls but also reinforced the importance of fostering an inclusive environment where every student feels seen and celebrated.

Operation Warm, a nonprofit dedicated to providing winter coats to children in need, partnered with Nordstrom to ensure that each student, including those from the large refugee community, received a brand new coat.\n\nAside from me organizing Operation Warm at Thorndyke, Nordstrom also donated 50 boxes of brand new children's socks and clothes that our district's own Julie Herdt and Kimberly Goodman were able to link with the Tukwila Children's Clothing Bank. The Tukwila Children's Clothing Bank provides clothing to all of our district families in need.\n\nThe Eagles, as the students are affectionately known, eagerly embraced the thoughtful gesture, especially with Seattle experiencing below-freezing temperatures. For many students, including those who have recently arrived in the community, this initiative provided not only physical warmth but also a sense of comfort and inclusion during the holiday season.\n\nNordstrom's volunteers worked tirelessly alongside Operation Warm to make the day extra special. The collaboration between the nonprofit and the retail giant exemplified the positive impact that corporate social responsibility can have on the lives of students, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. Beyond the practicality of the coats, the initiative fostered a spirit of togetherness, compassion, and a shared sense of belonging for all students.\n\nAs the students proudly showcased their new coats, the act of generosity extended far beyond protection from the cold. It symbolized a moment of collective kindness and care that will resonate within the school community, particularly among families who have recently resettled.\n\nThis heartening event serves as a shining example of the positive change that can occur when organizations unite for a common cause. Operation Warm and Nordstrom, through their collaboration, not only provided warmth but also shared joy and gratitude with the Thorndyke Elementary community, creating a meaningful impact for students, especially those who may be navigating the challenges of adjusting to a new community.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nWe are thrilled to share a momentous occasion that not only celebrates individual achievements but also serves as a source of inspiration for our entire community.

Beginning tomorrow, 11/7, we will be switching to white milk being served during breakfast and juice and water being offered at lunch.

Please be aware that our priority will be to reserve milk for breakfast service for as long as possible. Currently, it is estimated that this shortage could last anywhere from 4-6 months.\n\nIn response, we're taking prompt measures, including introducing additional water stations in cafeterias and providing water bottles when feasible. We're actively investigating alternative milk distribution solutions. To ensure everyone is informed, we will post this information on our website and communicate it to district staff as soon as possible.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this challenging period.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nOur recent Newcomer Family Night at Showalter Middle School was an unforgettable evening filled with warm welcomes, connections, and support.

He puts his full effort into everything he does. It is a hard job communicating with the vast number of administrators, coaches, parents and everyone else involved. But he has been amazingly communicative and responsive whenever I or others have had questions. He started an after school sports program for the elementary students this year, which I'm sure has been a lot more work, and something he really didn't have to do. He just thought it would be great to give more access to our students, many of whom got to play on their first organized sports team ever this year. He would show up to all the games to make sure everything was organized and help referee. Everyone who was at those games saw how much the students enjoyed it. He even helped the CV Dance Crew get t-shirts for their performance at a Foster basketball game. He has just gone above and beyond in so many ways. He deserves to be recognized for his good work.\"\n\n-Anonymous\n\nTSD Communications\n\nPlease congratulate Stephanie Aragon, 5th grade teacher at Cascade View, for being honored as a TSD Superstar!\n\nStephanie is a caring, compassionate teacher who creates a warm and welcoming classroom for all her students.

Stephanie has taken a leadership role at Cascade View, spearheading the Race and Equity Group at CV and instituting Community Walks to help our larger community connect and get to know each other better. Stephanie approaches situations and challenges with an open mind and a sense of curiosity to gain a deeper understanding of any situation. Stephanie has helped me develop a wider perspective on ways to approach broader solutions in our community. She truly makes Cascade View a better place to teach and learn.\n\n- Kristy Johnson\n\nStephanie is an incredible 5th grade teacher, Race & Equity leader, advocate for students, and friend to all. She is always going the extra mile to ensure their success in and out of the classroom. I frequently see her around our school meeting with parents, gathering people together to go on community walks for R&E, taking science lessons to the outdoors to be hands-on, and more. She inspires me every day to be a kinder, more patient and more engaged educator!\n\n- Estelle Kim\n\nTeacher Aragon always goes above and beyond to educate her students and is always thoughtful and inclusive. She will always advocate on behalf of the students and willing to collaborate however is needed to ensure their needs are met both in and out of the classroom. It has been amazing to witness the impact she has on her students and the connections made each year. Not only does she show up for the students but as staff, we can always count on her greeting us with a big smile in the hallways or for an occasional stop by with words of encouragement to help us through the week.\n\n- Tyrell Laury\n\nStephanie attended Tukwila Elementary School and graduated from Foster High School and remains involved in the Tukwila community. She leads the CV Race & Equity Team and is a member of the Leadership Team at Cascade View. Stephanie has organized several field trips for our 5th grade classes including the Sea Mar Museum of Chicano/a & Latino/a Culture and the Northwest African American Museum. Stephanie is an advocate for social justice in our school and the Tukwila Community. She is a collaborative colleague and strives to learn and grow as an educator.\n\n- Stephanie Motsch\n\nStephanie is what TSD is all about. She joined us at Cascade View 2 years ago eager and ready.

She has revamped our CV Race and Equity team by ensuring that families and members of the community have a place at the table. Teacher Aragon is a fierce advocate for her students, ensuring that all of them are welcome. I have been so fortunate to learn from Teacher Aragon myself, and I am a better teacher because of it.\n\n- Natalie Reeder\n\nStephanie Aragon goes out of her way to support her students and collaborate with colleagues. She greets every students, and embraces their cultural and linguistic diversity through translanguaging, teaching to their unique identities, and sharing diverse literature and perspectives. She has the brightest and most welcoming room in our building. When you walk through her ivy-decked door, you can see a space that's full of student work and voice, as well as fun places to read and work. She has brought in community members to share about their unique careers and how they got there. She is always coming up with creative new ways to deliver and integrate instruction, including and especially science and social studies. Her effective science teaching contributed to SBA science scores that were higher than the state average. She was the Race and Equity Lead this year and organized monthly community walks to bring our school into the community and all the places our students love and spend time. She focuses on positive behavior interventions. For example, she will validate a student's strong emotions and give them space to calm down, but she holds them accountable for their actions as well by holding restorative talks. She loves her community that she grew up in so much that she wanted to give back to it by teaching here, and she loves our students and she loves our school. She has so much earnest and genuine enthusiasm for teaching and her students and I am so grateful I get to call her my colleague.

Students and families have also joined on these walks. Stephanie really listens to her students and shows them respect, and in turn they respect her and think very highly of her. When some of her students have shown behavior issues, she does everything she can to help problem advocate and support their needs. Stephanie is a great co-worker, always a team player, friendly and equally thoughtful to co-workers.\n\n- Tammy Tauiliili\n\nI cannot say enough about Stephanie Aragon. She is one of my 5th grade teacher colleagues at Cascade View. She has been a wonderful asset to our 5th grade team. Last year was her first year and when I first stepped into her classroom it looked like I was in a beautiful clearing in the middle of a forest ecosystem. There were “grass” covered areas with vines on some of the walls giving the appearance of trees. There were lights all around giving the appearance of stars on the ceiling. Everything she put into the classroom was put there with intention and purpose and provided an engaging environment that was also calming to her students and anyone who comes into the room.\n\nStephanie also has an air purifier in the classroom and when we had the forest fires last year and I was having trouble breathing due to the smoke in the air, I was invited into her room to get a moment to literally breathe in some refreshing air.\n\nThis year Stephanie has brought many engaging activities to our whole 5th grade team to share. She had several field trip ideas that would enhance our social studies topics for the year and engage our students in learning about the cultures we are studying.\n\nStephanie is a Social Justice Advocate who has been an important influence on my learning and teaching through a social justice lens.

She is always smiling with an amazing attitude. Her passion for learning and leading is evident in the smiling children I see.” - Veronica Birdsong\n\n“Since day the first day she started as Principal at Cascade View, Dr. Fremstad let the staff know she was all about five F’s: Faith, Family, Football, Food and Fun which she clearly demonstrates each day. In the context of Faith, Dr. Fremstad expresses her faith in our students, staff and community. She lets our students know she believes in them, she loves working for them and has confidence that they will be the best that they can be. When it comes to family, Dr. Fremstad always encourages us to take care of ourselves and our families. Over and over, when a family emergency occurs, she is the first to inquire about how we are, what can she do and reminds us to take care of our family needs. If it is a Monday morning quarterback conversation you want, Dr. Fremstad will gladly talk about any football game that occurred over the weekend--just make sure you know you will walk away with nothing but accolades when it comes to the Huskies and Seahawks! If you should happen to be at Cascade View on a day Dr. Fremstad arranges for food to be in the staff room, come in hungry. Fruit bowls, salads, bread, sandwiches abound with Chick Fil-A and Panera Bread Company being the most popular menu items. This year the coffee table at Cascade View has become a full-fledged coffee bar with a continuous variety of K-cups, creamers, syrups and even a frother! Fun comes in a variety of forms, this month it take the form of a rubber duck. All staff were given a rubber duck with a number on the bottom. Numbers are drawn each week with prizes for the staff that range from taking over a recess duty, gift cards, snacks etc… For all these reasons, Dr. Fremstad should be one of Tukwila’s shining stars for the month of April.” - Cindy Golston\n\n“Dr. Fremstad is not just an amazing principal but a truly phenomenal person. She truly cares for the students, staff and families at Cascade View and is a strong advocate for our learning community. From keeping our campus safe to making sure the teachers have everything they need to ensure student success, she works everyday to make sure that Cascade View is truly the Home of Joyful Teaching and Learning. Each decision she makes is always for the benefit of the students, because they are the reason we are here. On any given day, you can walk into Cascade View and find us laughing and having fun with students, staff and families. The care and compassion that Dr. Fremstad has for our entire learning community is what makes Cascade View a very special place for everyone. Dr. Fremstad is the heart and soul of the school and I feel very honored to work with her.” - Angela Meyer\n\nHsian-Yu Kuo, Director of Information Technology and Theren Hayes, Instructional Technology Specialist\n\n“Hsian-Yu works tirelessly all year long to keep our network running. He may be \"behind the scenes\", but as soon as the internet goes down, he is the one who gets called. Hsian-Yu is responsive to staff needs and questions. Hsian-Yu is patient and has to wear \"many hats\" in terms of how he supports student and staff technology needs. I appreciate his diligence and responsiveness so much! I don't know what we would do without him.” - Erica Cieslikowski\n\n“Theren is such a valuable and knowledgeable resource to us all. Possessing experience as a previous classroom teacher gives him an even keener eye as to what is beneficial for staff and students alike. Theren is always helpful with providing needed training in a way that I can always understand. He is encouraging and always so enthusiastic which is always contagious. Thank you Theren for all that do in front and behind the scenes!” - Jill Quy\n\n“Tech has an overabundance of surplus much of the time. Theren pushed to get it out of the way, and with cooperation from Scottie, Lenny, and Hsian Yu, got it all out of the Service Centre. It involved a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of work moving it all, and they did it before I was even aware it had been cleared out. Thanks for your magnificent efforts!” - Jason Wilke-Nguyen\n\nTSD Communications\n\nPlease join us for Foster High School's production of \"Night of the Living Dead,\" May 11 - May 13 in the FHS Performing Arts Center.\n\nTSD Communications\n\nCome and get vaccinated at our next Vaccine Clinic on Tuesday, April 18 from 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. at Foster High School.
