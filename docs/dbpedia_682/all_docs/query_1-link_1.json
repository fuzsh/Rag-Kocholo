        "text": "WESTFIELD, Ind. — REAL News Central Indiana has learned the newly hired principal of Westfield Middle School pushed a policy to change the genders and names of children without notifying parents while she was the principal of Fall Creek Junior High in the Hamilton Southeastern School District. Westfield Washington Schools announced the hiring of Stacey Swan earlier this week.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by REAL News Central Indiana, as Principal of Fall Creek Junior High, Swan pushed a policy to secretly transition children in the fall of 2021 in the form of school wide “Gender Support Guidelines.” RNM obtained a copy of a powerpoint shared by Swan that was obtained through a public records request last year. It’s not clear if Fall Creek Junior High is still implementing the same secretive policies regarding the social transitioning of minor children.\n\nThe “Gender Support Plan” specifically states “STAFF SHOULD NOT DISCLOSE INFO THAT REVEALS A STUDENT’S TRANSGENDER STATUS UNLESS ALLOWED BY GENDER SUPPORT PLAN.”\n\nThe policy further states the “STUDENT DECIDES NAME & PRONOUN THEY WILL BE CALLED” and “LEGAL DOCUMENTATION OR PARENT PERMISSION IS NOT NEEDED TO BE CALLED BY SELECTED NAME.” The entire powerpoint presentation containing the Fall Creek Junior High “Gender Support Guidelines” can be seen below.\n\nSwan has been the principal of Fall Creek Junior High since 2019. Prior to that, she was the Principal of Noblesville West Middle School.\n\nWant to keep seeing the news the legacy media just won’t report?
