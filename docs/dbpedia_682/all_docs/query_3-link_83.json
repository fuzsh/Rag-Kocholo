        "text": "Middle school principal moves to central office\n\nBy AMY ADAMS\n\nnews@readthereporter.com\n\nLast night at the Westfield Washington Schools (WWS) board meeting, Assistant Superintendent for Business and Operations Brian Tomamichel announced that Mike Hall, current principal of Westfield Middle School, will assume the role of director of operations at the central office effective July 1.\n\nThe current Director of Operations, Dr. Joseph Montalone, will retire after 19 years with the district. Montalone served as principal of Shamrock Springs Elementary School and opened Maple Glen Elementary School before becoming director of operations six years ago.\n\n“We can’t say enough, Joe, about all you have done for the district over the last 19 years, 28 years in total in education in various roles,” said Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and Safety Chris Baldwin. “We thank you for all you’ve done for the students and the staff and the parents of Westfield schools, and you’ll be missed.”\n\nIn honor of Montalone’s final board meeting, Superintendent Dr. Paul Kaiser announced the new Dr. Joe Montalone Award that will celebrate Westfield Washington Schools team members who “advance a culture of positivity within and across the Shamrock community” and will be given annually at the May school board meeting.\n\n“When I was asked to come up to the position of director of operations six years ago, I looked at it as an opportunity to serve even more students and staff,” Montalone said. “It’s been an honor. It’s never been a job. I’m surely going to remember every human being. I’m not going anywhere. I’m not moving anywhere because there is no place I would rather be.”\n\nMike Hall comes into the position with 14 years of educational leadership experience in WWS. When he was named principal of Westfield Middle School, Hall was serving as principal at Monon Trail Elementary School and in a dual role as assistant principal at Carey Ridge Elementary School and Maple Glen Elementary School.\n\n“It was just an awesome way to start my career in Westfield,” Hall said.\n\nMike’s wife, Angie Hall, works as a special education teacher at Shamrock Springs Elementary School. They live in Westfield with their children, Graham and Grace, who both attend WWS.\n\nHall received his Master of Education degree from Indiana Wesleyan, his Master of Business Administration with a focus on educational leadership from University of Indianapolis, and his education specialist degree from Oakland City University. He has worked 21 total years in education, beginning as a fourth- and fifth-grade teacher in Lawrence Township in Marion County, then serving as an assistant principal at Anderson Community Schools.\n\n“I get choked up when I first think about moving on,” Hall said. “The piece I will cherish and carry with me is that I know so many kids that walked through the door at the middle school. I’ve known some of those kids since they were five years old.”\n\nAs the director of operations, Hall will serve as the district safety leader and will be responsible for heading the foodservice team, the custodial operation, and the transportation department across all 10 buildings.\n\n“We all know that if those things don’t function at a high level, then the schools don’t function,” Hall said. “It’s not lost on me the importance of this role. It’s certainly a different challenge to what I’ve had for the last 20 years.”\n\nIn his new position, Hall will report directly to Tomamichel.\n\n“I’ve seen Mike progress from an elementary principal to a leader at our second biggest school,” Tomamichel said. “I’m looking forward to seeing him continue to grow as a leader and as a difference maker in our district. I’m excited to see Mr. Hall continue to make an impact on our students and staff, and I know he’s going to bring that passion and hard work to the Administration Center.”\n\nA position for the WMS principal was posted on the WWS website.\n\n“We’re looking for someone to continue the tradition of leadership that the past leaders have provided in that building,” said Kaiser. “Some to continue the progress we’ve made and to work with a great teaching staff.”\n\nAnyone interested in the middle school principal position can apply at applitrack.com/wws/onlineapp.\n\n“I’m confident that at the end of the day, Dr. Kaiser and his team will select an amazing principal to come in and lead the middle school and create the experience that the kids will have,” Hall said.\n\nAbout Westfield Washington Schools\n\nWestfield Washington Schools is one of the fastest growing school districts in the state of Indiana. With an “A” rating from the Indiana Department of Education, WWS enrolled nearly 9,200 students in 2022-23 across six elementary, one intermediate, one middle, and one high school. The district employs roughly 1,200 staff members. Westfield High School is ranked in the top 3 percent nationally by U.S. News and World Report and has a graduation rate of 98.3 percent with 86 percent of its graduates continuing onto higher education."
