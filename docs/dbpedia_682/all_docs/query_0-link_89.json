        "text": "Happy May Everyone,\n\nWe had a big week over here in the State Senate. I’m very proud to announce that the Bond Bill to fund the reconstruction of the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home passed the Senate. After months of working tirelessly with staff, family, and residents, this is a huge step towards creating a new Home where we can care for our veterans with the dignity they deserve. The bill still hasn’t been signed into law yet , but I’m hopeful and will continue to work relentlessly to push this through.\n\nApart from the preparation for the Bond Bill, I was able to still get out into the community and meet with some constituents this week. On Monday, I took a meeting with the 509 chapter of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). As the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities, I look forward to working with them on policy in the future.\n\nI also met with Westfield State University’s student government this week to provide them with my annual update about the State Legislature. I’m very proud to have Westfield State in my district. These students are going to be our next generation of leaders and I’m always to happy to talk to them about what’s going on in the Legislature.\n\nI was also able to tour another one of my favorite places in Westfield this week, the Boys and Girls Club. I, alongside State Senator Lesser from Springfield and Representative Pease from Westfield, toured their new addition. We also toured their new kitchen which has been vital during the course of this pandemic. We’re lucky to have such a hardworking and dedicated staff at our local Boys and Girls’ Club.\n\nAlso congratulations is in order for Miren Neyran Alcantara from Holyoke Community College and Miranda Kamukala of Springfield Technical Community College, two constituents of mine who are being celebrated this week by the Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges for being some of the highest academic achievers in our state’s entire Community College System! Both were named to the Phi Theta Kappa All-Massachusetts Academic Team for their outstanding academic achievement and student service. The community colleges in our region have some truly incredible students and congratulations to both on their achievements.\n\nThis Sunday marks Easter in the Greek Orthodox church! My family and I are very proud of our Greek heritage and faith. I’m very excited to be able to celebrate with them and I hope that as we move out of the pandemic, gatherings like this become more and more common. στην υγειά μας!\n\nRecently I’ve started sending out newsletters from my office. You can sign up at senatorjohnvelis.com/newsletter/ to receive the newsletter right in your email inbox.\n\nAs always, if there is anything I can do to assist you, please never hesitate to reach out to my office. I can be reached at my email: john.velis@masenate.gov or by phone: (413) 572-3920 and you can find me online at senatorjohnvelis.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Velis\n\n(Boston–04/29/2021) On Thursday, April 29, 2021, the Massachusetts State Senate passed a bill authorizing $400 million in bonds for the design and construction of a new facility for the soldiers’ home in Holyoke. It also authorizes the issuance of $200 million in general obligation bonds to increase geographic equity and accessibility related to the continuum of long-term care services for Massachusetts veterans across the state, with an emphasis on those areas not primarily served by the soldiers’ homes in Chelsea or Holyoke.\n\n“Massachusetts has always been a leader for veteran services, and this bill reflects the Senate’s deep commitment to those who have served our nation,” stated Senator John Velis (D-Westfield), Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs. “While our veteran population and their medical needs are changing, the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home’s mission remains the same: to provide care with honor and dignity. This bond bill will ensure that the next generation of residents at the Home receive the care with honor and dignity that they have earned in service to our country.”\n\n“The funding in this bill will ensure that we begin to rethink how we deliver care to veterans of every generation across Massachusetts,” stated Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Ashland). “Ensuring that our veterans are connected to their communities is an important factor in ensuring that their physical and mental health is taken care of, and so I am proud of the steps we have taken to ensure geographic equity and accessibility, especially for our women and LGBTQ veterans, as well as veterans of color. Our quick action in passing this legislation will help ensure we maximize federal funds in this important endeavor.”\n\nIn passing the $400 million bond authorization for a new soldiers’ home in Holyoke, Massachusetts is eligible to receive up to 65 per cent in federal reimbursement through the Veterans Affairs State Home Construction Grant Program. The existing soldiers’ home in Holyoke was built in 1952 with many triple and quadruple-bed rooms. The bill passed by the Senate will advance the construction of a modern facility with a “small house” concept to meet the needs of future generations of veterans.\n\n“To meet the needs of the ever changing veteran population, the bill adopted today is a reflection of the strong advocacy of the members of this Senate to begin providing the long-term care services desperately needed for all veterans across the Commonwealth,” said Senator Michael J. Rodrigues (D-Westport), Chair of the Senate Committee on Ways & Means. “I want to thank Senate President Spilka for her leadership along with Senators Rush, Velis, Feeney and others for their contributions to improve the bill to address regional equity and increase accessibility to services for our veterans who are not served by the soldiers’ homes in Chelsea or Holyoke.”\n\nThe Senate adopted an amendment on the floor to ensure that construction of the project utilizes a diverse workforce and provides for well-paying, middle class jobs. The amendment inserts Project Labor Agreement language that mandates a pre-bid, pre-hire labor agreement for the construction of the new facility in Holyoke, which will ensure that the workforce is local, diverse, inclusive, well-trained, safe and skilled.\n\nHistorically, such agreements on large taxpayer funded projects result in the completion of construction on-time and on or under budget. Additionally, this amendment mandates bold action to establish, recruit, and assist women, minority, and veteran owned businesses who may participate in the design and construction of the facility. The bill establishes the Access, Inclusion, and Diversity Committee to help set and monitor progress of diversity and inclusion goals and recommend solutions and programs to meet them, throughout the design and construction of the facility.\n\n“The new Holyoke Soldier’s Home should be a safe, comfortable and welcoming facility worthy of its residents and their service to this country,” stated Senator Paul Feeney (D-Foxborough), the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets. “Our veterans deserve the very best in care and treatment. The passage of this bond authorization will ensure that their needs are met for generations to come. I am proud that the Senate added additional language during our debate that strengthens the bill to reflect our Commonwealth’s collective values. It is critical that significant taxpayer funded projects of this scope be completed on-time and on-budget with a diverse, local, safe, well-trained and highly skilled workforce. Additionally, we should be working diligently to assist women, minority, and veteran owned businesses in creating jobs and opportunities now and in the future. The bill we passed today accomplishes these goals by authorizing funding for a modern facility for our Commonwealth’s veterans while expanding opportunities for many local working-class people in the construction trades.”\n\nAs part of the Senate’s commitment to increase geographic equity and accessibility for all veterans, the bill requires the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM), in consultation with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) and the Department of Veterans\n\nAffairs (DVA), to hold hearings across the state to better understand the regional long-term care needs of veterans throughout the Commonwealth. Based on these hearings, communities will be better positioned to advocate for the $200 million authorized in new capital spending for long-term care services for veterans across the continuum of care, including potentially new “small home” satellite veterans’ homes, or new or expanded capital supports for community or home-based care.\n\nOne of many amendments adopted on the floor also requires the Department of Veteran’s Services to consider the needs of veterans in designing facilities to ensure new facilities meet the needs of a changing veteran population, while another requires plans for new long-term care facilities to prioritize equitable access, regardless of race, religion, sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.\n\nThe bill must now be reconciled with the version recently passed by the House of Representatives.\n\n###\n\n(BOSTON 3/29/2021) Today Senator John C. Velis announced a series of education-related bills that he filed in the Massachusetts State Senate. The three bills deal with cardiac arrest in student athletes, excused school absences for mental health, and reimbursement for school building projects from the Massachusetts School Building Authority.\n\nSD1233, An Act relative to sudden cardiac arrest awareness in student athletes, directs the Department of Public Health to develop an interscholastic athletic sudden cardiac distress and death prevention program for schools. Senator Velis stated that the idea for this legislation came from conversations with Westfield resident, Susan Canning, whose son, Kevin Major, died from an abnormally enlarged heart muscle known as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in July of 2011.\n\n“Kevin’s story is truly heartbreaking, and Mrs. Canning has been tireless in her work to raise awareness about issues of cardiac arrest in our youth,” said Senator Velis. “2,000 people under the age of 25 die each year of sudden cardiac arrest, with many of these tragedies occurring during athletic or physical activities. Often times these young, seemingly healthy, individuals don’t even know they are at risk, and this bill would ensure that our school systems are trained to spot the warning signs before it’s too late.”\n\nThe bill, which is supported by the American Heart Association, requires certain school personnel to participate in the program, where they would be trained in recognizing the symptoms and warning signs of cardiac distress and sudden cardiac arrest. Additionally, student athletes would be required to provide information relative to any cardiac medical history at the start of each sports season.\n\nSD2388, An Act relative to the mental health of children in schools, would allow for school absences to be permitted for behavioral health concerns. There is currently no state law in Massachusetts mandating that schools allow such absences, but many already do.\n\n“Mental health is an issue that is simply not talked about enough, especially when it comes to youth in our communities,” said Senator Velis, who is Vice Chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery. “School can be an incredibly stressful time for many students. It is so important that student are taking care of their mental health, and they should be able to take the time to do that without any consequences.”\n\nSD1743, An Act relative to school districts in receivership and the Massachusetts School Building Authority, would make school districts in receivership eligible for higher reimbursement rates from the state for school building projects. Currently, school districts cannot receive more than 80% reimbursement of eligible costs from the Massachusetts School Building Authority.\n\nSenator Velis stated after working with Holyoke Public Schools and City officials on their current middle school project, it became clear that school districts in receivership face unique challenges in completing new building projects.\n\n“There are currently only three school districts in the state that are in receivership, Holyoke, Lawrence and Southbridge,” said Senator Velis. “These school districts have already been determined to need more support from the state and I think that should apply to any new school construction projects as well.”\n\nState Representative Patricia Duffy, who represents Holyoke in the House of Representatives, is a cosponsor of SD1743 as well.\n\nThese bills have yet to be referred to a committee.\n\n###\n\n(BOSTON 3/22/21) At the end of last month State Senator John C. Velis filed bill SD1372: An Act relative to military spouse-licensure portability, education and enrollment of dependents. This bill would help moving military families transition easier by speeding up the state professional licensing process, allowing children moving into the Commonwealth enroll in school prior to the move, and letting college students keep in-state tuition.\n\nRelatively short durations of military assignments and long re-application processes often discourage military spouses from seeking their respective licenses when moving to a new state. This bill would require state agencies to accept or reject their application within 30 days of applying, which would help speed up the process of finding a new job.\n\nThe legislation would also create a “purple star campus” designation for schools with services geared towards frequently moving military families, including having designated-military family staff contacts and website resources for students and families. The bill would also allow rolling and virtual enrollment for students in military families who are going to move to the Commonwealth, alleviating the burden of missed deadlines and repeated classes that children with parents in the military often face.\n\nFor college students whose military family or sponsor move out the Commonwealth, the legislation also requires that they be deemed an in-state resident and still qualify for in-state tuition at institutions of higher education so long as they remain continuously enrolled.\n\n“Moving around frequently is a fact of life for my fellow service persons in the military. It always has been. ” said Velis. “Spouses can’t work. Kids get stuck in the bureaucratic muck and fall behind in school. College students lose affordability. I just think that–we as a Commonwealth–should do everything on our power to ease transitions for families who are already sacrificing so much for us.”\n\nSenator Velis worked closely with officials from the Department of Defense on this legislation, which follows many recommendations put forward by the Military Child Education Coalition.\n\n“The Military Child Education Coalition applauds Massachusetts Senator John Velis and his fellow Senators for introducing SD 1372 calling for the adoption of a state-wide Purple Star Campus program,” said MCEC President and CEO Dr. Becky Porter. “The Purple Star Program has the ability to reshape the educational environment for our military-connected children and families for years to come. MCEC looks forward to increased opportunities to work side-by-side with state educators and administrators across the nation to help them earn their schools the designation of being recognized as a Purple Star Campus.”\n\nSenator Velis is a major in the army reserves and was recently appointed the Chair of the Joint committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs.\n\nThis bill has not been referred to a committee yet.\n\n###\n\nHappy St. Patrick’s Day Folks,\n\nIt was another busy week here in the State Senate. This week marked the first hearing on the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home Bond Bill. Elected officials, family members, veterans’ advocates, and myself testified before the Joint Committee on State Administration and Regulatory Oversight on the specifics of the bill, which would allow the state to build an entirely new facility. The need for a new Home has existed for far too long and the tragedy that occurred there this past spring has only made that more apparent. Our veterans are the best of us and therefore they deserve the best from us.\n\nThis past Thursday’s Senate session was fruitful as well. The Senate passed a coronavirus relief package aimed at small businesses. Among other things, it would make PPP loans non-taxable income and extend the tax filing deadline until May 17th. As the light at end of the tunnel for this pandemic gets brighter and brighter, it’s paramount that the legislature continues to focus on the keystone of our economic recovery: small businesses.\n\nIn addition to the hearing about the bond bill this week, the Special Oversight Committee on the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke also held a hearing on Friday. We heard testimony directly from Mark Pearlstein, who was appointed by the Governor to conduct an independent investigation on the COVID-19 outbreak at the Home. The purpose of these hearings is to find out the underlying institutional causes that led to the tragedy at the Home last spring and to make sure something like this never happens again.\n\nFriday morning I also joined some of my colleagues and officials from Mercy Medical Center for their virtual legislative breakfast. It was an informative meeting where we heard directly from Mercy leadership about how the Center has adapted to COVID-19 to serve our communities.\n\nOn Wednesday I had the pleasure of presenting citations to two retiring Westfield Police officers, Terry Manos and William Ulrich. With a combined sixty-four years on the force, they did an excellent job serving and protecting our community. Thank you to the both of them and everyone here in my office is wishing them a happy retirement.\n\nI’d also like to commend the staff and students at Holyoke Community College for being ranked amongst the best community colleges in the United States by AcademicInfluence.com this week. They were 20th out of 839 schools across the country. They’re deserving of it and I know they will continue to help build a stronger workforce for the entire region.\n\nThis week, the Governor also announced new updates to the Vaccine eligibility timeline. On March 22nd, individuals 60+ and workers in certain sectors will become eligible. On April 5th, individuals 55+ and those with one comorbidity will become eligible. And on April 19th, the general public will become eligible. If you have any questions on your eligibility, please visit www.mass.gov/covid-19-vaccine or my website link which I mention below.\n\nRecently, I also started sending out both quarterly newsletters and weekly email updates regarding the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. To sign up for my COVID-19 updates, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/covid-19-updates/ To sign up for my quarterly newsletter, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/quarterly-newsletter/\n\nAs always, if there is anything I can do to assist you, please never hesitate to reach out to my office. I can be reached at my email: john.velis@masenate.gov or by phone: (413) 572-3920 and you can find me online at senatorjohnvelis.com.\n\nSláinte!\n\nJohn Velis\n\nHappy March Everyone,\n\nNow that spring has begun and we can be outside for longer than fifteen minutes, I’m looking forward to some more outdoor events in the community.\n\nOn Tuesday I presented two Senate citations to members of our medical community, one to Physicians’ Assistant Kenzi Holden and the other to Doctor Sarah O’Shea. During the onset of the pandemic, these two went above and beyond for their clinic, routinely seeing more than twenty patients a day and almost completely giving up time with their families in order to best protect their patients. The Commonwealth is lucky have them working in our healthcare system.\n\nThursday, I attended the Baystate’s COVID-19 legislative update alongside other legislators from Western Mass. Members of both the public sector and Baystate staff discussed the many issues facing healthcare workers right now, chief amongst them being lack of vaccine supply. Positive test rates are–thankfully–starting to drop across the Commonwealth. However, there are still miles ahead of us and I urge everyone to continue to taken proper precautions.\n\nLater on Thursday I visited the State Police headquarters in Framingham to discuss public safety in the Commonwealth and projects that they are co-opting with the Department of Homeland Security on. I also toured the Massachusetts Fusion Center, which is the operational hub of the Commonwealth’s homeland security efforts. The work these agencies are doing to is paramount to keeping the Commonwealth safe and I look forward to working with them to determine how the Massachusetts legislature can best aid them in their duties.\n\nTo finish the week, I sat in on a roundtable for the Connecticut Valley Superintendents. This group is comprised of superintendents from Hampden, Hampshire, Franklin counties as well as officials from local universities and community colleges. Educational institutions have already been left reeling by the pandemic. From declining enrollment to the more intangible learning loss, the complex ways in which schools have been changed will be felt for years if not decades to come. The state legislature needs to be prepared to aid however it can and I will continue to support strong funding for our public school systems in the state budget.\n\nRecently, I also started sending out both quarterly newsletters and weekly email updates regarding the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. To sign up for my COVID-19 updates, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/covid-19-updates/ To sign up for my quarterly newsletter, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/quarterly-newsletter/\n\nAs always, if there is anything I can do to assist you, please never hesitate to reach out to my office. I can be reached at my email: john.velis@masenate.gov or by phone: (413) 572-3920 and you can find me online at senatorjohnvelis.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Velis\n\n(BOSTON 3/4/2021) – Last week the National Conference of State Legislatures announced that they had selected twenty state legislators from across the country to participate in their 2021 Opioid Policy Fellows Program. Among those selected was Senator John Velis (D-Westfield). Prior to his selection and the application process, Senator Velis had been nominated for the fellowship program by Senate President Karen Spilka (D-Ashland).\n\n“Recovery—and the struggles of addiction—are issues that I personally understand and want to positively impact,” said Senator Velis, who is Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery. “I believe one of the long-lasting impacts of this pandemic is going to be the negative effect this period of isolation and stress has had on those suffering with mental health disorders and substance abuse. For many people these two issues are co-occurring, and I’m looking forward to learning more about what we can institute here in Massachusetts to help address these problems.”\n\nThe program is designed for legislators who are emerging leaders in opioid and substance use disorder issues and is supported by health professionals, addiction experts, and policy specialists. The fellowship will include a series of seminars and conferences that focus on policies to prevent, intervene and treat opioid misuse, addiction and overdose. The program will also address the intersections of opioid use with mental health, maternal and pediatric health, human services, and criminal justice.\n\n“This is a unique opportunity to learn directly from those who have been studying issues of opioid addiction and substance use disorders for years,” said Senator Velis. “In addition to speaking with subject matter experts, this is also a chance to learn about innovative programs that other states have implemented that we here in Massachusetts might be missing out on. This is all about taking those best practices and policies that are out there and figuring out how we can implement them here in the Commonwealth to help save lives.”\n\n“So much of our world has changed due to the ongoing pandemic, and that includes how to best offer assistance to those with addiction and substance use disorders,” stated Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Ashland). “Senator Velis has been a longtime advocate for those in the recovery community and it’s for that reason I was thrilled to nominate him for NCSL’s 2021 Opioid Policy Fellow Program and congratulate him on his selection. I look forward to him sharing with the Senate more about his experience so that we can continue to build on our progress to help those most in need as they continue to recover.”\n\nSenator Velis was appointed Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery last month. The Chair of the Committee is Senator Julian Cyr (D-Truro).\n\n“We always make better policy when we bring our most real vulnerable experiences to this work. I have much admiration for Senator Velis’ decision to share his own journey through addiction and use it to inform how we go about helping others,” said Senator Cyr. “Our committee work will benefit from his pursuit of further study on opioid policy.”\n\nThe first conference for the program will be held virtually on the weekend of March 26th. There will be a series of shorter virtual webinars throughout the later spring and summer, and organizers hope to hold a second weekend conference in person in September.\n\n###\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI hope you’re all doing well. I know many of you reached out to my office this week regarding COVID-19 vaccinations, especially on Thursday when the appointment website went down. This is completely unacceptable, and the system absolutely has to be improved.\n\nWhen individuals 65+ and those with 2+ comorbidities became eligible to book appointments this week, over a million new people became eligible. The state received just over 110,000 doses from the federal government this past week, and we simply do not have the vaccines at this time for everyone to get an appointment immediately. That being said, it should not be this difficult to access the site, book an appointment, and get clear information. Although Governor Baker is unilaterally overseeing the vaccine rollout and vaccination locations, I will continue to communicate these issues and advocate for improvements. Next week, the Legislature will be holding a public, livestreamed oversight hearing on Thursday to hear directly from Administration officials on the rollout of the vaccine process and the website itself. We expect answers from those responsible for this failure and a better system must be delivered for our residents.\n\nThis Friday marked the official end of “bill filing” season. After weeks of requests, research, and revisions, my staff and I are excited to announce all the bills that we’ve filed in the Senate so far. I will still have the ability to file bills through the entire two-year session, but submitting by this deadline ensures that they will be heard by a committee promptly.\n\nI’m also excited to announce that for this upcoming Legislative session, I will be the Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Children, Families, and Persons with Disabilities as well as the Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Recovery. As a veteran, I’m especially proud to announce my Chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs. All of these are policy areas that I’m passionate about and I’m very much looking forward to a productive Legislative session.\n\nAs a part of the bill filing process, my staff and I have been taking meetings with many constituents and experts regarding issues facing the Commonwealth. Among those meetings I took this week, one that stands out is the meeting I had with Maryanne Frangules, the founder of the Massachusetts Organization of Addiction Recovery (MOAR). We discussed how COVID-19 has exacerbated difficulties for those suffering from addiction and how the Legislature and especially my new position as Vice-Chairmanship of the Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Recovery can best help them in the upcoming session.\n\nThursday morning, I met with the Western Mass Legislative delegation to discuss how Baystate’s pending consolidation of psychiatric beds in the region and Holyoke Medical Center’s acquisition of Providence Behavior Health Hospital will affect the area. As always, we will work with our partners in both the Legislature and in the private sector to insure the best possible outcome for the patients of Western Mass.\n\nRecently, I also started sending out both quarterly newsletters and weekly email updates regarding the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. To sign up for my COVID-19 updates, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/covid-19-updates/ To sign up for my quarterly newsletter, head to senatorjohnvelis.com/quarterly-newsletter/\n\nAs always, if there is anything I can do to assist you, please never hesitate to reach out to my office.

Senator John Velis (D-Westfield) was named the Senate chair of the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs. When asked about his new position, Senator Velis stressed the importance of delivering for those who have served our country.\n\n“Those in our Armed Forces are selfless and courageous individuals who lay their lives on the line in defense of our great country. In turn, we need to do everything we can to make sure we are properly assisting and caring for those who serve and have served.” said Senator Velis, who is a Veteran and Major in the U.S. Army Reserves himself. “Our Veterans have their own unique needs and skillsets, and I am incredibly excited to chair the committee directly tasked with all aspects of Veteran affairs.”\n\nSenator Velis will chair the Joint Committee alongside State Representative Paul McMurtry (D-Dedham). Senator Velis noted that he has filed several pieces of Veteran Affairs legislation on his own already and that he hopes to see several major Veterans Bills be signed by Governor Baker this session.\n\nIn addition to his chairmanship, Senator Velis was also named Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery, and Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities.\n\n“Both of these committees will be working on issues very near and dear to my heart,” said Senator Velis. “As someone who went through the special education system in Westfield, and as someone who has had their own struggles in recovery, I look forward to lending my personal insight to these committees as we work on legislation that will benefit residents across the Commonwealth.”\n\nSenator Velis will also be sitting on five other joint committees in the 2021-2022 legislative session, including the Joint Committee on the Judiciary, the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government, the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, the Joint Committee on State Administration and Regulatory Oversight, and the Joint Committee on Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development.\n\n###\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nHard to believe we’re already at the end of January! 2021 is moving along and I hope this new year has been good to you all so far. This week I had several meetings regarding potential legislation to file in this new session, as well as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process.\n\nOn Monday morning I met with Dave Cruise, President and CEO of the MassHire Hampden County Workforce Board. We had a informative conversation about companies and businesses in our district and how the Legislature can support them. Monday afternoon I sat down with Mayor Humason and Representative Pease to talk about our legislative priorities and how we can work together to benefit the City of Westfield.\n\nOn Tuesday I met with Westfield City Councilor Kristen Mello and other community members to discuss PFAS and a new potential study that would look at the impact of the contamination in food sources across the state.\n\nThis week my staff and I also met virtually with representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense to talk about potential legislation for Veterans and active military members in the Commonwealth. While I will be refiling several pieces of Veterans affairs legislation from my time in the House, I have a few new interesting initiatives I will be pursuing as well.\n\nEarlier this week, the Baker Administration announced that individuals who are 75+ years old can begin to book appointments through mass.gov/covid-19-vaccine to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when Phase 2 begins on February 1st. I have heard from many constituents this week about the difficulty and confusion of signing up for a vaccine appointment on the site. While the Governor is unilaterally overseeing the vaccination distribution, my office has been communicating with the Administration frequently to make our concerns clear.\n\nThis week I co-sponsored legislation to greatly improve the current vaccination booking process. SD300, An Act streamlining COVID-19 vaccination sign-up in Massachusetts, directs the Department of Public Health to immediately establish an accessible, one-stop online sign-up for COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as a 24/7 phone hotline in multiple languages. Ensuring access to the vaccine is crucial to recovering as a Commonwealth.\n\nLast week several of my colleagues and I also sent a letter to Governor Baker asking for increased vaccination preparations in Hampden County, and I am glad that Eastfield Mall in Springfield will now be a mass vaccination site. I will continue to advocate to improve the vaccination process however I can, and my staff is available to assist with any questions or concerns you may. In addition, I will be sending out COVID email updates as new information becomes available. You can sign up to receive them at senatorjohnvelis.com/covid-19-updates/\n\nAs always if there is anything I can do to assist you, please never hesitate to reach out to my office. I can be reached at my email: john.velis@masenate.gov or by phone: (413) 572-3920 and you can find me online at senatorjohnvelis.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn C. Velis"
