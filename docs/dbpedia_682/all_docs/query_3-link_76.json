This is a secured app and requires you to first have a child enrolled in a program before you are able to use the app.\n\nClick the EZ ChildTrack link to the left to go to our Parent Portal website, then scroll down to the bottom of the Login page to press your app store button. After the app has downloaded, and you have opened it, there is no longer any need to scan a QR Code. Just return to our Parent Portal website and press the app store button a second time. Done! Again, in order to use the app, you must first have a child enrolled in a program."
