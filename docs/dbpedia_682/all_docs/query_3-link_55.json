Are they in need of a clean slate to work towards their goals? Large, traditional schools are often unable to provide a relationship-based approach & prevent students from falling through the cracks — that isn’t something that happens at Options Schools.\n\nHere, we believe all learners deserve to benefit from the individualized educational experience needed to achieve their full potential. Students can choose from brick and mortar campuses in Noblesville and Westfield, IN, or a flexible established online program, along with additional campus programs serving students in all 92 counties in the state of Indiana.\n\nOptions is accredited by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and AdvancED."
