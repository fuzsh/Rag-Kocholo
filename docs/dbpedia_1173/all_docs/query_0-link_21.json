Pictures and Mexican animation house Anima Studios are producing a Spanish-language Top Cat origin story.\n\nThe Warner release Don Gato: El Inicio de la Pandilla (Top Cat: The Gang’s Beginnings) will hit Mexican theaters in August 2015. Andres Couturier (Kung Fu Magoo) is directing the film, which will be a reboot done entirely in CGI.\n\nThe first Top Cat movie, produced by Anima and Argentina’s Illusion Studios, had a record-breaking opening weekend in Mexico in 2011 and it became the year’s highest-grossing domestic film. Internationally, it was released in 25 countries."
