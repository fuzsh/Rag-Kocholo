        "text": "The year has just one Marvel Studios release ('Deadpool 3') and one DC film ('Joker: Folie à Deux'), but there are new horror entries ('Saw XI') and epics ('Dune 2' and 'Gladiator 2').\n\nThe dual actors and writers strikes of 2023 have wreaked havoc on the theatrical landscape, with some projects delayed so long that they will no longer be hitting in 2024, making the year more barren than theater owners and movie studios would like.\n\nStill, there are plenty of projects that are on track and expected to be big, from long-gestating sequels (Gladiator 2, Beetlejuice 2) to R-rated comic book offerings (Deadpool 3, Joker: Folie à Deux).\n\nMean Girls (Jan. 12)\n\nParamount’s movie musical adapts the Broadway musical adaptation of the 2004 movie. Tina Fey is back for this iteration, a Gen Z take on the high school movie classic starring original Broadway star Renee Rapp, Angourie Rice and Jon Hamm.\n\nBook of Clarence (Jan. 12)\n\nFilmmaker Jeymes Samuels’ follow-up to his Black western The Harder They Fall follows a man living in Biblical times who takes his cues from the new Messiah and starts his own faithful following, which puts him in conflict with the ruling Roman empire.

Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill and Bryan Cranston also star, alongside pop star Dua Lipa. The Apple film is getting a global theatrical release via Universal.\n\nLisa Frankenstein (Feb. 9)\n\nThe campy, young adult take on the Mary Shelley classic sees a high schooler reanimate a corpse who turns out to be a love interest.

Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, Isabela Merced and Tahar Rahim also star in the film, which upon the release of its first trailer, spawned the instantly memable line, “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.” S.J. Clarkson directs for Sony and Columbia.\n\nBob Marley: One Love (Feb. 14)\n\nThe biopic of Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley comes from King Richard director Reinaldo Marcus Green and stars Kingsley Ben-Adir as Marley. It follows the singer’s rise, as well as his personal and political journey.\n\nDune: Part Two (March 1)\n\nThe follow-up to Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune was set for release in 2023 but was pushed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. The film, from Warner Bros. and Legendary, will pick up where the last left off with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) looking to avenge his family line with the help of the Fremen. Florence Pugh, Austin Butler and Christopher Walken join the cast that is also led by Zendaya.\n\nRoad House (March 21)\n\nThe 1989 camp action flick starring Patrick Swayze is getting a 2024 re-do thanks to director Doug Liman.

The film will be streaming via Amazon.\n\nThe American Society of Magical Negroes (March 22)\n\nSet for a Sundance 2024 debut, the feature from comedian and satirist Kobi Libii follows a young man who gets recruited into a secret society of Black people who are meant to make white people’s lives easier.

Nicholas Hoult voices Garfield and Odie’s owner, Jon, while Chicken Little filmmaker Mark Dindal directs.\n\nInside Out 2 (June 14)\n\nThe gang is back together in this animated follow-up to the beloved Pixar movie that follows the anthropomorphized emotions of a young girl led by Amy Poehler’s Joy. Joining for this round is Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke.\n\nBad Boys 4 (June 5)\n\nIn many ways, Bad Boys 4 is a much-needed palette cleanser for those involved. It marks Will Smith’s return to the summer blockbusters following his infamous Oscars slap in March 2022. And filmmakers Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah moved on to the project after their previous feature, Batgirl, was unceremoniously shelved by Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav a few months after that. Bad Boys 4, starring Smith and Martin Lawrence as Miami cops and best friends, is a follow-up to Bad Boys for Life, which stands as the highest grossing film of 2020 (it was one of the few blockbusters to bow before the pandemic shut things down). It arrives nearly 30 years after the 1995 original, directed by Michael Bay.\n\nThe Bikeriders (June 21)\n\nAfter Disney-owned 20th Century Studios opted not to release The Bikeriders amid the SAG-AFTRA strike, the New Regency film landed at Focus Features, which set a 2024 date for the Jeff Nichols-directed movie.

Set in New York City on the first day of an alien invasion, the feature originated from an idea Krasinski. Pig’s Michael Sarnoski directs a cast that incudes Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, Djimon Hounsou and Denis O’Hare.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 (June 28)\n\nKevin Costner’s multi-film western saga has been in the works since 1988, with the star-filmmaker putting at least $20 million of his money into the projects. Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone and Abbey Lee are among the cast. Horizon has been closely watched, because it has been part of a dispute with his hit streaming Western, Yellowstone. The Yellowstone team has said Costner was less available for filming the final season due to his commitments on Horizon, while Costner’s camp has blamed script delays.
