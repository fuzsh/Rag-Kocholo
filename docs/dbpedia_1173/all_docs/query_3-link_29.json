        "text": "Tickets are On Sale Now for the Exclusive Cinematic Event, with the Film Coming to Theaters for One Showing on Wednesday 8/28, Before the 9/19 Debut of the Limited Series from Warner Bros. Television and DC Studios\n\nBURBANK, Calif., August 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Warner Bros. Pictures’ \"The Batman\" flies back into select theaters around the globe for one special night—in the U.S. on Wednesday, August 28 and internationally on a select date on or near the 28th—in celebration of the upcoming debut of the HBO® Original series \"The Penguin.\" At the screening, fans will not only revisit Gotham City with Robert Pattinson as Batman, but they will be the first to see an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of \"The Penguin,\" with insights from series star Colin Farrell, executive producers Matt Reeves, Dylan Clark, Lauren LeFranc, who also writes and serves as showrunner, and Craig Zobel, who also directed the first three episodes.\n\nThe announcement was made today by Jeff Goldstein, President, Domestic Distribution and Andrew Cripps, President, International Distribution, Warner Bros. Pictures, who stated, \"‘The Batman’ was a massive hit around the world when we released it in 2022, and we’re excited to be able to bring it back to theaters in partnership with our friends at AMC and Dolby, giving audiences a chance to see it again on the big screen as they gear up for more of Colin Farrell’s terrific performance as The Penguin.\"\n\nReeves’ powerful new vision of the globally iconic DC Super Hero was both a critical and commercial success, as the blockbuster \"The Batman\" grossed over $772 million at the worldwide box office in its initial theatrical run in the first quarter of 2022. Oz/The Penguin, portrayed by Farrell in the film, became an immediate fan favorite and, with the actor on board, Reeves turned to showrunner Lauren LeFranc to develop a limited series.\n\n\"The Penguin,\" an eight-episode HBO Original limited series from Warner Bros. Television and DC Studios, will debut on September 19, 2024 on HBO and will be available to stream on Max.\n\nDomestically, the Studio is partnering exclusively with AMC and Dolby on 100 Dolby Cinema® at AMC screens across the U.S. Internationally, the film will be available in Dolby Cinema and Dolby Atmos® in theaters across The UK, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and South Korea. Audiences will receive a mini-poster featuring exclusive new art, while supplies last.\n\nAbout \"The Batman\"\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures, Matt Reeves’s \"The Batman,\" stars Robert Pattinson in the dual role of Gotham City’s vigilante detective and his alter ego, reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne.\n\nMore than a year of stalking the streets as the Batman (Pattinson), striking fear into the hearts of criminals, has led Bruce Wayne deep into the shadows of Gotham City. With only a few trusted allies—Alfred (Andy Serkis), Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright)—amongst the city’s corrupt network of officials and high-profile figures, the lone vigilante has established himself as the sole embodiment of vengeance amongst his fellow citizens.\n\nWhen a killer targets Gotham’s elite with a series of sadistic machinations, a trail of cryptic clues sends the World’s Greatest Detective on an investigation into the underworld, where he encounters such characters as Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz), Oz, aka The Penguin (Colin Farrell), Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and Edward Nashton/aka The Riddler (Paul Dano). As the evidence begins to lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator’s plans becomes clear, Batman must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit, and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued Gotham City.\n\nStarring alongside Robert Pattinson as Gotham’s famous and infamous cast of characters are Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Jayme Lawson, with Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell.\n\nReeves directed from a screenplay by Reeves & Peter Craig, based on characters from DC. Batman was created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger. Dylan Clark and Reeves produced the film, with Michael E. Uslan, Walter Hamada, Chantal Nong Vo and Simon Emanuel serving as executive producers.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents a 6th & Idaho/Dylan Clark Productions Production, a Matt Reeves Film, \"The Batman.\" The film is distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.
