        "text": "This is a list of production numbers for the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, TV shows, episodes, specials, movies, and advertisements. Production numbers are extremely useful and more accurately chronological than going by release date. The release dates can sometimes be inaccurate and could be off by several weeks, months, or even years.\n\nNotes[]\n\nAt present, there is no easy way to get the production numbers for the golden age shorts between 1930 to mid-1943, and for many newer productions. For the golden age shorts, production artwork, lobby cards, and documentation are adorned with the in-house production numbers (model sheets in particular). Due to this, most production codes within this period is unknown.[1]\n\nLate in the 1943 release season, the production numbers actually started appearing on screen under the WB shield, this was an anomaly for cartoons in the golden age as no other studio had or would put their in-house production numbers in the opening or end titles.\n\nGolden Age[]\n\nFrom 1930-1945, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies had their own production numbers (3-to-4-digit with a 2-letter production number, with a hyphen):\n\nThe 2-letters are always LT or MM, which identify the series each cartoon is in,\n\nThe first set of digits identify each cartoons specific number given,\n\nThe second set of digits identify which production season the cartoon was made in.\n\nIn 1945, starting with Robert McKimson's \"One Meat Brawl\" (which started production six weeks before Bob Clampett left), the studio switched to a 4-digit production number system. Beginning as MM-10-15 (the tenth Merrie Melodies of the fifteenth season), the hyphen was dropped and it became 1015. From that point onward, both the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies went by the same production number, and would gradually count up starting from 1015.[2] Due to the backlog which began post-WWII, the new 4-digit production number system was not seen on screen regularly until 1947; \"Bacall to Arms\" and \"Rhapsody Rabbit\" are only cartoons released in 1946 that are seen with the newer production number system, despite being the third and twenty-sixth cartoon assigned with a 4-digit production number respectively.\n\nBlue Ribbon reissues were also assigned production numbers, but only used during the 1949-59 seasons, being counted with the mainline shorts. When The Bugs Bunny Show started production it went under the same 4-digit production number system as the theatrical shorts.\n\nThe production numbers changed again when operations switched to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and again when operations switched to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.\n\nPost-Golden Age[]\n\nWarner Bros. Animation began to use a 6-digit production number system in the 1970s. The numeric code has been updated over the years.\n\n255XXX/256XXX - Movies, specials, commercials\n\n406XXX - 1990–1999 (407XXX)\n\n385XXX - 1999–2004\n\n257XXX - 2004–2006\n\n345XXX/346XXX - 2006–2013\n\n3A5XXX - 2012–2016\n\nThey have kept it for decades since until 2016 when it was changed to a 3-digit with a 4-letter production number. Their alphanumeric code begins with A14.XXXXX.\n\nWABB = Wabbit / New Looney Tunes\n\nBBBD = Bugs Bunny Builders\n\nBYEB = Bye Bye Bunny\n\nLTCT = Looney Tunes Cartoons\n\nTINY = Tiny Toons Looniversity\n\nPDMV = The Day the Earth Blew Up A Looney Tunes Movie\n\n1930–1945 (3-to-4-digit with a 2-letter production number for the Looney Tunes series)[]\n\nProd. # Title Original Release Earliest Production Date Known Notes LT-1-1 \"Sinkin' in the Bathtub\" 19 April 1930 LT-2-1 \"Congo Jazz\" 9 August 1930 LT-3-1 \"Hold Anything\" 22 August 1930 LT-4-1 \"The Booze Hangs High\" 31 October 1930 LT-5-1 \"Box Car Blues\" 25 October 1930 LT-6-1 \"Big Man from the North\" 6 December 1930 LT-7-1 \"Ain't Nature Grand!\" 13 December 1930 LT-8-1 \"Ups 'n Downs\" 30 January 1931 LT-9-1 \"Dumb Patrol\" 2 March 1931 LT-10-1 \"Yodeling Yokels\" 28 March 1931 LT-11-1 \"Bosko's Holiday\" 1 May 1931 LT-12-1 \"The Tree's Knees\" 15 May 1931 LT-13-1 \"Lady, Play Your Mandolin!\" 2 August 1931 Released as a Merrie Melodies cartoon and the first one in the series.

Release Notes BYEB 265 Bye Bye Bunny TBA PDMV 325 The Day the Earth Blew Up A Looney Tunes Movie 2024\n\nNotes[]\n\nShorts, episodes, specials, movies, and advertisements that either do not have a production number or there production number is known will not be listed.\n\nSeveral cartoons released between 1945-1946 had their series swapped upon release.\n\nThe production numbers for, Fresh Airedale, Quentin Quail, Peck Up Your Troubles, Nasty Quacks, The Eager Beaver, Walky Talky Hawky, and Fair and Worm-er label them as Looney Tunes even though they were released as Merrie Melodies.\n\nThe production numbers for, Hare Conditioned, Hare Tonic, Baseball Bugs, Hush My Mouse, Acrobatty Bunny, The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, and Racketeer Rabbit label them as Merrie Melodies even though they were released as Looney Tunes.\n\nThe original 3-to-4-digit with a 2-letter production numbers were often displayed differently.\n\nWhen lobby cards displayed production numbers in the early years they would display as\n\n(insert) of the (Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies) series of Vitaphone Song Cartoons\n\nA \"Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies\" Cartoon No. (Insert)\n\nLooney Tune or Merrie Melodie Cartoon # (insert)\n\nWhen the production numbers started appearing on screen, they do not have the 2-letters were excised (for example the production number for Baby Bottleneck is LT-12-15 but displayed as just 12-15 under the WB shield on the original title).\n\nSurviving production material shows production numbers without the final two digits (which indicate the production season).\n\nSome of the numbers may be wrong, as certain cartoons in the 1960s of the studio's run feature identical production numbers in the opening titles. Blue Ribbon reissues would sometimes have the same production numbers as each other or newly released cartoons. Also some might not be properly sourced.\n\nWhile in some cases the reasons for disparities are obvious (cartoons done by the faster Cinecolor process in the late 40s having much higher production numbers than the Technicolor shorts of that season), a cartoon with an earlier production number that was not released until after one with a later production number could mean anything.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
