        "text": "Written by Kevin McCorry The Warner Brothers cartoons have been available for viewing on Saturday morning U.S. network television series other than The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour and The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. They have also been broadcast on weekdays on popular syndicated cartoon compilation television series. Below is a complete listing of every other regular television programme to feature Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.\n\nLOONEY TUNES\n\nIn 1955, on WABD-TV in New York and KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, Warner Brothers' library of pre-1948 Looney Tunes, a cavalcade of the film studio's cartoon characters of the 1930s and early 1940s, premiered on television under the Looney Tunes television series name.\n\nAt first, the films were seen on weekdays with local personalities introducing them.\n\n30-minute instalments of this cartoon compilation television series began airing on April 11, 1955. There were 190 cartoons in the package, including those with Bosko, the Warner Brothers cartoon animation studio's first character- a diminutive, wide-eyed black figure with very little personality except a love of life; Buddy, an equally nondescript boy with a girl-friend named Cookie; and Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and others.\n\nPrints of each film were black-and-white, and it was not until 1969, when television stations across the United States demanded colour, that Warner Brothers manufactured colour prints of those early films that were originally produced in black and white. In 1960, Warner Brothers added post-1948, colour Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies to its package for syndication (direct sale to individual television stations), while the ABC television network aired select post-1948 classics on The Bugs Bunny Show.\n\nA listing of cartoons shown on this Looney Tunes television series is unavailable at this time.\n\nTHE PORKY PIG SHOW\n\n\"Who's our favourite TV star? Who comes on with a wham? Who's got the laughiest show by far? P-P-P-Porky Pig, our favourite ham! Ooh, that Porky, Porky Pig! He's the barnyard's Mr. Big! When the music starts, you wanna tap your toes. You feel like dancin' a jig! Swing around in a circle, and doesy-do! Time to watch Porky Pig.\" \"Sadly now we sing again, to each and every one. Gladly we'll come back,and then, we'll all have more fun! Watching Porky and his friends, wish it never had to end. Don't forget next time we meet, we're planin' something big. Just be sure to join us then for Porky Pig!\"\n\nFriz Freleng created Porky Pig, Warner Brothers' first major cartoon character, for \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" in 1935, a Merrie Melodie in which Porky was a porcine version of Chubby of the Our Gang comedies. Freleng's fellow cartoon animation directors Tex Avery, Robert Clampett, and Frank Tashlin refined Porky, giving to him a more appealing look, and Mel Blanc replaced Joe Dougherty as the provider of Porky's stuttering voice. Porky's particular speech impediment distinguished him from all other cartoon characters in the 1930s and 1940s, rendering him lovably vulnerable as the modest, put-upon hero of many cartoons pairing him with hustlers, moochers, aggressors, or troublemakers, some of whom were Daffy Duck and the pushy, master-seeking Charlie Dog. Porky's fractured statement of \"That's All, Folks!\" ended most of the Warner Brothers cartoons through the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nPorky's cartoon presence diminished in the 1950s while most of the other Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters were in their prime. During this time period, he was usually a sidekick to a bumbling Daffy Duck in such Chuck Jones-directed cartoon shorts as \"Drip-Along Daffy\" (1951), with Daffy as a \"Western-type hero\" and Porky as \"comedy relief\", \"Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century\" (1953), Daffy's outing as an outer space adventurer and Porky as an \"eager, young space cadet\", \"Deduce, You Say\" (1956), with Porky as \"Watkins\" to Daffy's \"Dorlock Homes\", and \"Robin Hood Daffy\" (1958), in which Daffy is a Robin Hood pretender and Porky a laughing Friar Tuck. Porky's other appearances through the post-1948 time period were as the blase master of a timid Sylvester Cat, while the travelling pair encounter a murderous-mouse-infested house, a haunted hotel, and an abducting buzzard from Jupiter, and Porky was also director Robert McKimson's character of choice in pairings with an annoying Daffy Duck.\n\nFrom September 20, 1964 to September 2, 1967, Porky was the host of his own Saturday morning television series on the ABC network. The Porky Pig Show, thirty minutes long, featured the cartoons of Porky, Daffy, Bugs Bunny, Tweety and Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn, and others. The opening to each Porky Pig Show instalment involved Porky inviting his cartoon character friends, many of them rather bizarrely sized in cartoon animation provided by Hal Seegar Productions, assembling in a barn on Porky's farm to watch Porky's television programme.\n\nIn 1971, four years after its network run, the television series was reassembled, with a different collection of cartoon shorts, and syndicated under the title, Porky Pig and His Friends.\n\nPorky Pig Show # 1 (Sept. 20, 1964) \"Often an Orphan\" with Porky Pig and Charlie Dog \"Mice Follies\" with the Honey-Mousers \"The Super Snooper\" with Daffy Duck Porky Pig Show # 2 (Sept. 27, 1964) \"The Awful Orphan\" with Porky Pig and Charlie Dog \"Bell Hoppy\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper \"Wild Wife\" with the Harried Housewife Porky Pig Show # 3 (Oct. 4, 1964) \"Scaredy Cat\" with Porky Pig and Sylvester \"Baton Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and the Bothersome Fly \"Feather Dusted\" with Foghorn Leghorn, Miss Prissy, and Egghead Jr. Porky Pig Show # 4 (Oct. 11, 1964) \"The Wearing of the Grin\" with Porky Pig and the Leprechauns \"The Unexpected Pest\" with Sylvester \"Which is Witch\" with Bugs Bunny and Dr. I.C.

Although the title was Bunny et ses amis, Bugs only appeared with Daffy Duck in \"This is it\" (sung by them in French) to open each instalment, with cartoon animation and background of \"This is it\" having been lifted from the original Bugs Bunny Show (1960-2) and reversed. Bugs' cartoons were never shown in this television series. Sylvester was the undoubted focus. Aside from an occasional Foghorn Leghorn cartoon short, the contents of every instalment of Bunny et ses amis were Sylvester's cartoons with Tweety, Sylvester Jr., Hippety Hopper, Speedy Gonzales, Spike and Chester, or Elmer Fudd. The first instalment consisted of \"Chili Weather\", \"A Street Cat Named Sylvester\", \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\", and \"Tugboat Granny\", all minus their titles. The format of the Bunny et ses amis television series was consistent with this. Each instalment featured four cartoons, all with their titles removed.\n\nCartoons Shown On Bunny et ses amis\n\n\"A Street Cat Named Sylvester\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Tugboat Granny\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Fowl Weather\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Tweet Tweet Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Trick or Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet Zoo\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet and Sour\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Putty Tat Trouble\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and the Big Bad Wolf\n\n\"The Jet Cage\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Bird in a Bonnet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Snow Business\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Gift Wrapped\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Catty Cornered\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Rocky\n\n\"Tree Cornered Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet and Lovely\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"The Rebel Without Claws\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Room and Bird\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Greedy For Tweety\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Home, Tweet Home\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's Circus\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"A Pizza Tweety-Pie\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Hawaiian Aye Aye\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Dog Pounded\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's S.O.S.\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Canary Row\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"All a Bir-r-r-d\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Muzzle Tough\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tweety and the Beanstalk\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Sandy Claws\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tweet Dreams\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"A Bird in a Guilty Cage\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Hyde and Go Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Trip For Tat\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Ain't She Tweet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\" with Sylvester, Spike, and Chester\n\n\"Birds of a Father\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"Bell Hoppy\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Hippety Hopper\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Canned Feud\" with Sylvester\n\n\"Tree For Two\" with Sylvester, Spike, and Chester\n\n\"Too Hop to Handle\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"A Mouse Divided\" with Sylvester and the Drunken Stork\n\n\"Mouse-Taken Identity\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Goldimouse and the Three Cats\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Goldimouse\n\n\"Fish and Slips\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"The Slap-Hoppy Mouse\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Cats A-Weigh!\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Cat's Paw\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"Who's Kitten Who?\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Pop 'im Pop!\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Hoppy-Go-Lucky\" with Sylvester, Benny Cat, and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Hoppy Daze\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Pappy's Puppy\" with Sylvester and Butch J.

Clampett reused the bird in two additional cartoons, \"Birdy and the Beast\" (1944) and \"A Gruesome Twosome\" (1945), in which more unfortunate felines battle the \"naked genius\", who was given the voice of a toddler, a musical sense, and the name of Tweety. After Clampett departed Warner Brothers in 1947, his tiny bird became a yellow-feathered canary as Friz Freleng, senior cartoon-animation director at Warner Brothers, paired Tweety with a lisping, white-bellied, mainly otherwise black cat named Sylvester, created by Freleng for the 1945 cartoon, \"Life With Feathers\". A buffoonish Sylvester in that cartoon and in \"Peck Up Your Troubles\" (1945) combated, respectively, a suicidal love bird and a woodpecker. Despite some initial opposition from general producer Edward Selzer, Freleng combined Clampett's bird with Sylvester, who evolved quickly into an often silent schemer and, like Chuck Jones' Wile E. Coyote, the eternally frustrated, empathetic pursuer of an elusive fowl.\n\nThe first Tweety-and-Sylvester duel, \"Tweetie Pie\" (1947), won an Academy Award, and the canary and cat starred in a total of 42 highly successful animated-cartoon short films from 1947 to 1964. Unlike the Road Runner series of cartoons, which were limited in setting to the U.S. southwestern desert of modern times, the cartoons with Tweety and Sylvester spanned the globe and delved into history and fiction, and the duo were sometimes accompanied by Granny, a Tweety-protecting matron, and/or a bulldog. In his cartoons through the 1950s, Tweety became less energetic and a coy spectator of Sylvester's woebegone machinatons.\n\nSylvester proved his versatility by appearing without Tweety in several wonderful cartoons. In a lengthy line of cartoon shorts directed by Freleng's colleague, Robert McKimson, he fights a baby kangaroo, Hippety Hopper, which he and his impressionable son, Junior, constantly mistake for a giant mouse. Freleng's Sylvester is also the unwitting victor in confrontation with a bully bulldog, whose mongrel admirer proves circumstantially to be a superior cat-fighter. In more Freleng classics, Sylvester is unsuccessful at catching a mouse that withholds from him a desperately needed can opener and is the victim of a drunken stork's misplaced bundle, of a adoringly destructive little girl, and of a commando Red Riding Hood mouse. Sylvester was also used by Freleng and McKimson as the feline opponent of Speedy Gonzales, Mexico's fastest rodent, and by Chuck Jones as travelling companion of Porky Pig in some scary places and situations.\n\nFor many years a staple on The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour, the duo of Tweety and Sylvester were given their own television show by CBS in September, 1976. On September 11, 1976, The Sylvester and Tweety Show premiered at 9 A.M. Atlantic Time, directly before The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour, which aired at 9:30. Midway through the 1976-7 season, CBS moved The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour to 10 o'clock and inserted an episode of Clue Club at 9:30 to separate Sylvester and Tweety at 9 A.M. from Bugs and the Road Runner at 10.\n\nTitle cards for some of the cartoons featured in episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Show.\n\nEach half-hour episode of Sylvester and Tweety contained three cartoons, the first and third with Tweety and Sylvester, and the second with Sylvester apart from Tweety. An exception to this was the instalment airing on September 25, 1976, which contained three Tweety-and-Sylvester cartoons, \"Trick or Tweet\", \"The Rebel Without Claws\", and \"Hawaiian Aye Aye\". Often, a cartoon clip was added to an instalment to extend the television programme's duration by a minute or two. Following each episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Show was In the News, a short information segment to keep children informed on world affairs. Some of the sponsors for The Sylvester and Tweety Show were Sugar Pops and Cheerios breakfast cereals, Kenner Toys, Gabriel Toys, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Tootsie Pops (who can forget the classic commercial in which a boy asks an owl how many licks are necessary to reach the Tootsie Roll centre of a Tootsie Pop?), Bubble Yum, and, of course, McDonald's.\n\n\"Bad Ol' Putty Tat\" and \"Room and Bird\" were two of the cartoons from which clips were used for the Sylvester and Tweety Show opening.\n\nThe opening for all episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Show featured clips from some of their cartoons, among them \"Bad Ol' Putty Tat\" (Sylvester using a makeshift trampoline to reach Tweety's house), \"Room and Bird\" (Sylvester chasing Tweety down a corridor in the Spinsters' Arms Hotel), \"Hoppy Daze\" (Sylvester, coiled springs on feet, pursuing Hippety Hopper in a warehouse), and \"Tweet Tweet Tweety\" (Sylvester running after Tweety in a woodland and the two characters respectively rowing a log and a boat on a river). These clips were interspersed with new cartoon animation of Sylvester giving chase of Tweety on a stage, with lettering of their television show title behind them, in the same font as on title cards to their cartoon shorts as presented on the CBS television network since 1966. Robert McKimson directed these newly animated scenes, and he was listed above Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones in the cartoon directors' credits at the end of each instalment. Sprightly music accompanied the visuals of the opening and of the closing credits. And Mel Blanc was sometimes known to voice Bugs Bunny announcing that The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour would be the next television programme scheduled after Sylvester and Tweety.\n\nThe Christmas episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Show contained the three cartoons, \"Gift Wrapped\", \"Canned Feud\", and \"Putty Tat Trouble\", with Christmas being celebrated in Granny's house in \"Gift Wrapped\", Sylvester's people going away on a vacation and leaving Sylvester in a locked house with a mouse that holds the only thing that will enable Sylvester to eat any canned goods in \"Canned Feud\", and Tweety referring to Christmas as he removes snow from his nest in \"Putty Tat Trouble\".\n\nOn December 25, 1976, two of the cartoons on The Sylvester and Tweety Show were, appropriately, \"Gift Wrapped\" and \"Putty Tat Trouble\". Between them was \"Canned Feud\".\n\nCartoons Shown On The Sylvester and Tweety Show\n\n\"Tweet Tweet Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet and Sour\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Fowl Weather\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and the Big Bad Wolf\n\n\"Trick or Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Hawaiian Aye Aye\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"The Rebel Without Claws\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet Zoo\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"The Jet Cage\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Bird in a Bonnet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Bird in a Guilty Cage\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Snow Business\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Putty Tat Trouble\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Gift Wrapped\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Catty Cornered\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Rocky\n\n\"Tree Cornered Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Satan's Waitin'\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Hyde and Go Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet and Lovely\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Home, Tweet Home\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's Circus\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"A Pizza Tweety-Pie\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Ain't She Tweet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Dog Pounded\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's S.O.S.\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tugboat Granny\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Canary Row\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"All a Bir-r-r-d\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Muzzle Tough\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Street Cat Named Sylvester\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Tweety and the Beanstalk\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Sandy Claws\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tweet Dreams\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Birds Anonymous\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Trip For Tat\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Canned Feud\" with Sylvester\n\n\"Tree For Two\" with Sylvester, Spike, and Chester\n\n\"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\" with Sylvester, Spike, and Chester\n\n\"Hippety Hopper\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Claws for Alarm\" with Porky Pig and Sylvester\n\n\"Mouse-Taken Identity\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Fish and Slips\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"Birds of a Father\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"The Slap-Hoppy Mouse\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Cats A-Weigh!\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Who's Kitten Who?\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Pop 'im Pop!\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Hoppy-Go-Lucky\" with Sylvester, Benny Cat, and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Hoppy Daze\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Claws in the Lease\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.\n\n\"Kit For Cat\" with Sylvester and Elmer Fudd\n\n\"D' Fightin' Ones\" with Sylvester and Bulldog\n\n\"Lighthouse Mouse\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"A Mouse Divided\" with Sylvester and the Drunken Stork\n\n\"Greedy For Tweety\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny (clips only)\n\n\"Room and Bird\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny (clips only)\n\n\"Bad Ol' Putty Tat\" with Tweety and Sylvester (clips only)\n\n\"Goldimouse and the Three Cats\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Goldimouse (clips only)\n\n\"Cat's Paw\" with Sylvester and Sylvester Jr. (clips only)\n\n\"Too Hop to Handle\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper (clips only)\n\n\"Bell Hoppy\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper (clips only)\n\n\"Pappy's Puppy\" with Sylvester and Butch J.

Here's your chance to have some fun. Come on and laugh with Speedy and Daffy. You will be the happy one. You said you want to see a super show. Yes, you did! You said you did. Yes, you did! And so, let's go now. On with the show now. It's time to have a real good time. Real good time!\"\n\nHis first appearance was in the 1937 Tex Avery-directed Looney Tune, \"Porky's Duck Hunt\", as the mischievous mallard who frustrates hunter Porky Pig. For the first decade of his cartoon life, the \"little, black duck\" conceived by Avery and nurtured by Avery's fellow cartoon animation directors Robert Clampett and Chuck Jones, moved out of the marshland of his initial cartoon and became the most hyperactive, mirthful, multi-situational cartoon heckler in the Warner Brothers cartoons. Yet, he was gradually, through the 1940s, acquiring a different persona, that of a cowardly yet ambitious, gluttonous, and downright greedy egoist who would challenge Bugs Bunny's dominance even while yielding to his conspicuous and shameless frailties, eventually becoming Bugs' jealous co-performer on stage in \"Show Biz Bugs\" (1957) and in The Bugs Bunny Show.\n\nJones made Daffy a vainglorious, failing star, the loser in several woodland confrontations with Bugs Bunny and with Elmer Fudd's rifle, and a miscast, overweening bumbler who revels in the prestige and never in the dangers involved with such roles as a \"Western-type hero\" in \"Drip-Along Daffy\" (1951), a Space Age adventurer in \"Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century\"(1953), swashbuckler in \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (1950), Victorian era sleuth in \"Deduce, You Say\" (1956), and a Robin Hood pretender to a laughing Porky Pig in \"Robin Hood Daffy\" (1958). In the same vein, Daffy was a somewhat less-than-invincible \"Stupor Duck\" (1956) and a recurring gumshoe battling formidable villains, in cartoons directed by Robert McKimson, who also paired Daffy with Porky, with Daffy as obnoxious hitchhiker, unrelenting insurance seller, huckster hotel operator, and burdensome house-guest.\n\nDaffy did not receive exposure on an equal level to that of the other main Warner Brothers cartoon characters on CBS' The Road Runner Show and The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour. Few of his cartoons were included in the CBS package prior to 1975: \"Don't Axe Me\", \"You Were Never Duckier\", \"Stupor Duck\", \"Duck Amuck\", and some of Daffy's cartoons with Bugs. And although more of Daffy's cartoon outings were added after 1975, among them \"Daffy Dilly\", \"Fast Buck Duck\", \"Aqua Duck\", and \"Robin Hood Daffy\", Daffy was still mostly relegated to scenes on stage, in which he was usually humiliated by Bugs. The majority of his classic cartoons were distributed to individual television stations in the syndication packages of Bugs Bunny and Friends and Porky Pig and His Friends, with film prints of variable quality.\n\nStarting in 1978, the NBC television network ran its own compilation television series of Warner Brothers cartoons. With CBS holding the television network rights to most Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, and Tweety and Sylvester cartoon shorts, NBC had little option but to air a television series starring Daffy, the only major Warner Brothers cartoon character with a sizable number of cartoons available outside of the rights held by CBS. Though NBC obtained some pre-1960 classics, for the most part the cartoons that it purchased the rights to air were post-1960, including nearly all of Daffy's limited-cartoon-animation tussles with Speedy Gonzales in a minimal-background Mexico. Several of Speedy's cartoons with Sylvester and small numbers of cartoons with other characters, were included in the mix.\n\nThe original opening to The Daffy Duck Show combined brief clips from the cartoons of Daffy, of Speedy, and of Daffy and Speedy together, with a rather uninspired song performed by a group of female singers. The opening to The Daffy Duck Show in its 1980-1 season, newly cartoon-animated, showed Pepe Le Pew descending into a hole in the middle of a vinyl record, and Yosemite Sam, Porky Pig, Tweety, Foghorn Leghorn, Granny, Speedy, Elmer Fudd, and Daffy emerging from the hole and scurrying away in various directions. An announcer then introduced most of these characters, and then Daffy and Speedy would squabble over who should receive \"star\" billing for the television show.\n\nEach half-hour episode of The Daffy Duck Show contained four cartoon shorts.\n\nThe Saturday morning Daffy Duck Show premiered on NBC at 11:30 A.M. Atlantic Time on November 4, 1978, moved to 9 A.M. on September 15, 1979, returned to 11:30 on December 8, 1979, and remained there until its move to 1 P.M. for its final months on the air in 1982.\n\nThe episode of The Daffy Duck Show airing on November 14, 1981 contained the cartoons, \"Music Mice-Tro\", \"The Turn-Tale Wolf\", \"His Bitter Half\", and \"Good Noose\".\n\nCartoons Shown On The Daffy Duck Show\n\n\"His Bitter Half\" with Daffy Duck\n\n\"Golden Yeggs\" with Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and Rocky\n\n\"Holiday For Drumsticks\" with Daffy Duck and Tom Turk\n\n\"Stork Naked\" with Daffy Duck and the Drunken Stork\n\n\"Boobs in the Woods\" with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig\n\n\"Don't Axe Me\" with Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, and Mrs. Fudd\n\n\"Good Noose\" with Daffy Duck\n\n\"Daffy's Inn Trouble\" with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig\n\n\"Suppressed Duck\" with Daffy Duck\n\n\"Corn On the Cop\" with Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and Granny\n\n\"Tease For Two\" with Daffy Duck and the Goofy Gophers\n\n\"Daffy Flies North\" with Daffy Duck and the Laughing Horse\n\n\"It's Nice to Have a Mouse Around the House\" with Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Speedy Gonzales, and Granny\n\n\"Music Mice-Tro\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A Taste of Catnip\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Sylvester\n\n\"Daffy's Diner\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Muchos Locos\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Porky Pig\n\n\"Quacker Tracker\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"The Spy Swatter\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Speedy Ghost to Town\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Rodent to Stardom\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Fiesta Fiasco\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Skyscraper Caper\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"See Ya Later, Gladiator\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Go Away Stowaway\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Swing Ding Amigo\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Feather Finger\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A Squeak in the Deep\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A-Haunting We Will Go\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Witch Hazel\n\n\"Daffy Rents\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Mexican Mouse-Piece\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"The Astroduck\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Assault and Peppered\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Go Go Amigo\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Chili Corn Corny\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Well Worn Daffy\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Moby Duck\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Nuts and Volts\" with Sylvester and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Mexican Boarders\" with Speedy Gonzales, Sylvester, and Slowpoke Rodriguez\n\n\"A Message to Gracias\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Chili Weather\" with Sylvester and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Gonzales' Tamales\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Cats and Bruises\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"The Pied Piper of Guadalupe\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Cannery Woe\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Mexican Cat Dance\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Freudy Cat\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"Pappy's Puppy\" with Sylvester and Butch J.

In autumn of 1982, to supplement its then hour-long Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show, CBS ran a 60-minute television series consisting of the many Daffy-and-Speedy cartoons combined with those with Sylvester with or without Tweety. Most episodes of The Sylvester & Tweety, Daffy & Speedy Show contained eight cartoons, often four with the cat with or without the canary and four with the duck and mouse. The Sylvester & Tweety, Daffy & Speedy Show aired weekly on Saturdays starting in September, 1982, but not long thereafter, The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show expanded to two hours, and cartoons with Sylvester, Tweety, Daffy, and Speedy were absorbed into the two hours of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show.\n\nCartoons Shown On The Sylvester & Tweety, Daffy & Speedy Show\n\n\"Tweet Zoo\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet Tweet Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Trick or Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Putty Tat Trouble\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweet and Sour\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Hyde and Go Tweet\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's S.O.S.\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Hawaiian Aye Aye\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Sandy Claws\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Pizza Tweety-Pie\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Birds Anonymous\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"The Last Hungry Cat\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tugboat Granny\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Canary Row\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Fowl Weather\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Tweety and the Beanstalk\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and the Big Bad Wolf\n\n\"Dog Pounded\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"The Rebel Without Claws\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"The Jet Cage\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Home, Tweet Home\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Satan's Waitin'\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"All a Bir-r-r-d\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"A Bird in a Bonnet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Bird in a Guilty Cage\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Gift Wrapped\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Catty Cornered\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Rocky\n\n\"Snow Business\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tree Cornered Tweety\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Trip For Tat\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tweet and Lovely\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Tweety's Circus\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Ain't She Tweet\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"Tweet Dreams\" with Tweety and Sylvester\n\n\"Muzzle Tough\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny\n\n\"A Street Cat Named Sylvester\" with Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Hector Bulldog\n\n\"Freudy Cat\" with Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., and Hippety Hopper\n\n\"A Taste of Catnip\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Sylvester\n\n\"It's Nice to Have a Mouse Around the House\" with Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Speedy Gonzales, and Granny\n\n\"Music Mice-Tro\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Swing Ding Amigo\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Daffy's Diner\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Chili Corn Corny\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Skyscraper Caper\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A-Haunting We Will Go\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Witch Hazel\n\n\"Muchos Locos\" with Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales, and Porky Pig\n\n\"Go Away Stowaway\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Well Worn Daffy\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A Squeak in the Deep\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Quacker Tracker\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Assault and Peppered\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Snow Excuse\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"The Spy Swatter\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Speedy Ghost to Town\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Rodent to Stardom\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Fiesta Fiasco\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Moby Duck\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"See Ya Later, Gladiator\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Feather Finger\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Daffy Rents\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Mexican Mouse-Piece\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"The Astroduck\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Go Go Amigo\" with Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Cats and Bruises\" with Sylvester and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"Nuts and Volts\" with Sylvester and Speedy Gonzales\n\n\"A Message to Gracias\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\n\"Cannery Woe\" with Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester\n\nTHE BUGS BUNNY/LOONEY TUNES COMEDY HOUR\n\nIn September, 1985, the network rights to broadcast Warner Brothers' cartoons on Saturday morning transferred from CBS to ABC. On September 7, 1985, at 9 A.M. Atlantic Time, ABC began transmitting The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour, initially a 13-episode television series, instalments of which contained seven, and sometimes eight, cartoons, some extensively edited for violence. No Speedy Gonzales cartoons were shown, presumably because of their Mexican stereotypes. And for some bizarre reason, no Tweety cartoons appeared either. Each instalment in this television series was approximately forty-two minutes long, with the remaining seventeen minutes of airtime filled with commercials and a segment of Schoolhouse Rock.\n\nThe one-minute opening for The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour was composed of quick cuts from various cartoons with which an announcer introduced each of the characters starring in the show. Clips from \"Bully For Bugs\" (Bugs being rear-ended by the Bull), \"Little Boy Boo\" (Foghorn Leghorn pitching a baseball to Egghead Jr., who bats it down Foghorn's throat), \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (Porky Pig escorting Sylvester; Sylvester and Porky laughing at Daffy Duck), and \"Drip-Along Daffy\" (Daffy falling through the saloon floor after drinking Canasta's noxious cocktail and triggering his own guns into shooting a hole through the floor) were included in this assortment of cartoon excerpts.\n\nThe format of the television show was consistent in that the first cartoon in each instalment was a Bugs Bunny, and the third was a Road Runner. For four consecutive weeks early in the season, the second cartoon in the episodes was a feature without regular characters: \"A Waggily Tale\", \"I Was a Teenage Thumb\", \"The Hole Idea\", and \"Martian Through Georgia\". Bugs was heavily favoured in this television series, appearing often in 3, and sometimes in 4, of the seven cartoons per episode.\n\nMoving-graphic cartoon titling first utilised in the final Bugs Bunny/Road Runner season was retained for The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour, but the accompanying music was that which had been used for all Bugs Bunny cartoons in Season 1 of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour.\n\nBelow are images of the titling for some of the cartoons on The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour.\n\nThe contents of the first instalment of The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour were \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny\", \"Robin Hood Daffy\", a severely edited \"Fast and Furry-ous\", \"Bewitched Bunny\", \"Pop 'im Pop!\", \"A Scent of the Matterhorn\", and \"Knighty Knight Bugs\". Instalment two's cartoons were \"Hot Cross Bunny\", \"Hippety Hopper\", \"Zoom at the Top\", \"Wideo Wabbit\", \"Mouse Wreckers\", \"Heaven Scent\", and \"Beanstalk Bunny\". \"A-Lad-in His Lamp\", \"Cats A-Weigh!\", \"Gee Whiz-z-z-z!\", \"Hare-Breadth Hurry\", \"Who's Kitten Who?\", \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\", and \"High Diving Hare\" were the cartoons in episode three. And six of the cartoons of episode four were \"Mother Was a Rooster\", \"Going! Going! Gosh!\", \"Robot Rabbit\", \"Wild Over You\", \"A Fractured Leghorn\", and \"Dumb Patrol\".\n\nOn December 7, 1975, having aired thirteen episodes of The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour, ABC began rerunning those episodes, and did so until February 22, 1986. ABC then repeated them again, from March to June, 1986. For June, July, and August of 1986, new Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour episodes were shown, with some cartoons of the initial thirteen episodes mixed with cartoons new to this television series.\n\nCartoons Shown On The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour\n\n\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd\n\n\"Bewitched Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and Witch Hazel\n\n\"Knighty Knight Bugs\" with Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, and the Dragon\n\n\"Hot Cross Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and the Bespectacled Doctor\n\n\"Wideo Wabbit\" with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd\n\n\"Beanstalk Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd\n\n\"A-Lad-in His Lamp\" with Bugs Bunny and Smoky the Genie\n\n\"Hare-Breadth Hurry\" with Bugs Bunny and Wile E.

In autumn of 1988, TVA broadcasted L'Epopee de Bugs Bunny, the French version of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979), which was cut to an hour's length, with commercials. In early January, 1989, TVA began running classic cartoon shorts under the title of Bugs Bunny et ses amis (Bugs Bunny and Friends) at 6:30 P.M. Eastern Time, after the evening news on Saturdays.\n\nInstalments were a half-hour long, with four cartoons shown in each. Titles and credits for the cartoons were cut, and to allow for additional commercial time, some cartoons were joined a minute in progress. Every instalment started with a Bugs Bunny cartoon.\n\nTVA showed a limited amount of cartoons from January to early September, 1989, repeating many of them twice. When the network obtained an entirely different and larger batch of cartoons in September of that year, all of the cartoons that it had been showing for the previous 8 months disappeared and for the next 11 years were not seen again on the network. Instead, the cartoons that first aired on TVA starting in late 1989 were recycled constantly- until 2000, when Bugs Bunny et ses amis was replaced on TVA by Quoi de neuf, Bugs?.\n\nThe quick opening and closing for Bugs Bunny et ses amis contained clips of \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\" (Daffy pointing at Bugs and shouting at Elmer to fire his rifle), \"Little Beau Pepe\" (Pepe wooing the paint-striped cat), \"Ali Baba Bound\" (Porky riding Baby Dumpling), \"Crockett-Doodle-Do\" (Foghorn being struck by lightning), \"Swallow the Leader\" (the cat being dive-bombed by the swallows), \"Zip 'n Snort\" (the Road Runner), and \"Operation: Rabbit\" (Wile E. Coyote about to be hit in his nitroglycerin shed by a train). An instrumental version of the Bugs and Daffy song, \"This is It\", played over these clips.\n\nCartoons Shown On Bugs Bunny et ses amis (Jan.-Sept., 1989)\n\n\"8 Ball Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and the Penguin\n\n\"Horse Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam\n\n\"Hare Splitter\" with Bugs Bunny, Daisy Bunny, and Casbah\n\n\"Operation: Rabbit\" with Bugs Bunny and Wile E.

While some occasional later time period (1958-64) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were in the package, the majority of the cartoons were of the late 1940s and early to mid-1950s, and the cartoons provided by Warner Brothers Canada were in no way affected by the distribution situation in the United States. Some of YTV's cartoons were also on ABC; some were on the WB Network; and some were on Nickelodeon.\n\nYTV also obtained most of the prime-time television specials. Notable exceptions were How Bugs Bunny Won the West, Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals, and Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales. The television specials were intermixed with 76 three-cartoon episodes, which were broadcast from Monday to Friday at 5:30 P.M. Atlantic Time, then for a short time period over the Holidays of 1997-8 at 12:30 P.M., then at 5 P.M. through to August, 1998. Starting on September 21, 1998, Bugs Bunny was retransmitted weekdays on YTV at 9:30 A.M.. A further three-cartoon instalment was added when YTV moved Bugs Bunny to a 1:30 P.M. airtime in November, 1998.\n\nCartoons were run in their original format, with no editing of any kind, which is surprising as some cartoons have violence that has for a long time been deemed unsuitable for television, and others contained ethnic or racial stereotypes or racially stereotypical caricatures. \"Caveman Inki\", banned from television in the U.S., appeared whole on YTV, as also did the seldom-shown \"Which is Witch\" and \"Wise Quackers\", but the instalments featuring these were run at the unusual airtime of 12:30 and past the notice of regular viewers of the 5:30 airings, and when these episodes circulated again in the summer of 1998, \"Caveman Inki\" was replaced by \"Beep, Beep\", and \"Wise Quackers\" was superseded by \"Hillbilly Hare\". \"Which is Witch\" was permitted to continue running, as also was \"Southern Fried Rabbit\" (with Bugs in black face posing as a slave).\n\nShow # 1 (Aug. 22, 1997) \"Rabbit Every Monday\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"Two Scents Worth\" with Pepe Le Pew \"All Fowled Up\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk Show # 2 (Aug. 25, 1997) \"8 Ball Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and the Penguin \"Wild Over You\" with Pepe Le Pew \"Feather Bluster\" with Foghorn Leghorn Show # 3 (Aug. 26, 1997) \"The Fair Haired Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam \"For Scent-imental Reasons\" with Pepe Le Pew \"Weasel Stop\" with Foghorn Leghorn and the Weasel Show # 4 (Aug. 27, 1997) \"Bewitched Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny and Witch Hazel \"Little Beau Pepe\" with Pepe Le Pew \"The EGGcited Rooster\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk Show # 5 (Aug. 28, 1997) \"Yankee Doodle Bugs\" with Bugs Bunny and Clyde Rabbit \"Touche and Go\" with Pepe Le Pew \"A Broken Leghorn\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Miss Prissy Show # 6 (Aug. 29, 1997) \"No Parking Hare\" with Bugs Bunny and the Construction Worker \"Odor of the Day\" with Pepe Le Pew \"Henhouse Henery\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk Show # 7 (Sept. 1, 1997) \"Hawaiian Aye Aye\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny \"Louvre Come Back to Me!\" with Pepe Le Pew \"Little Boy Boo\" with Foghorn Leghorn, Miss Prissy, and Egghead Jr. Show # 8 (Sept. 2, 1997) \"A Hound For Trouble\" with Charlie Dog \"Don't Give Up the Sheep\" with Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog \"A Kiddies Kitty\" with Sylvester and Little Suzanne Show # 9 (Sept. 3, 1997) \"Gone Batty\" with Bobo the Elephant \"Muscle Tussle\" with Daffy Duck \"I Gopher You\" with the Goofy Gophers Show # 10 (Sept. 4, 1997) \"Kit For Cat\" with Sylvester and Elmer Fudd \"Knighty Knight Bugs\" with Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, and the Dragon \"The Leghorn Blows at Midnight\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk Show # 11 (Sept. 5, 1997) \"Lighthouse Mouse\" with Sylvester and Hippety Hopper \"Little Red Rodent Hood\" with Sylvester \"Heaven Scent\" with Pepe Le Pew Show # 12 (Sept. 8, 1997) \"A Scent of the Matterhorn\" with Pepe Le Pew \"The Foghorn Leghorn\" with Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk \"Terrier-Stricken\" with Claude Cat and Frisky Puppy Show # 13 (Sept. 9, 1997) \"A Fractured Leghorn\" with Foghorn Leghorn \"Sandy Claws\" with Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny \"Cheese Chasers\" with Claude Cat, Hubie, and Bertie Show # 14 (Sept. 10, 1997) \"A Bird in a Guilty Cage\" with Tweety and Sylvester \"There Auto Be a Law\" with the Meek Car-Driver \"Ali Baba Bunny\" with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Hassan the Arab Show # 15 (Sept. 11, 1997) \"The Awful Orphan\" with Porky Pig and Charlie Dog \"Beep, Beep\" with Road Runner and Wile E.
