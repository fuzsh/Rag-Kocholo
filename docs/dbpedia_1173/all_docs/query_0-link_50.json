        "text": "Actually the 1998 print of Dough for the Do-Do does air on TV, on Cartoon Network Latin America:\n\nAll the 1997/1998 restorations do show up on TV, but its very random and varies on each broadcast and region.\n\nFor examples:\n\n1. In Cartoon Network Latin America, Tooncast and Cartoon Network/Boomerang UK, and Mediaset Italia 1 \"Dog Pounded\" is aired as the 1997 restoration while in Cartoon Network/Boomerang USA and Italy the old one (the unrestored 1988 LD/video print) is aired instead.\n\n2. On Cartoon Network/Boomerang USA \"Mouse Mazurka\" airs as the old (the unrestored 1988 LD/video print) while on Cartoon Network Latin America, Tooncast and Boing Spain the 1998 restoration print is aired instead.\n\n3. On Cartoon Network/Boomerang in USA and Latin America and Tooncast \"Bonanza Bunny\" is aired as the 1997 restoration while on Boomerang Germany the old one (the unrestored 1988 LD/video print) is aired instead.\n\n4. On Cartoon Network/Boomerang USA and Latin America and Tooncast \"Design For Leaving\" airs unrestored (as the 1986 Golden Jubilee tape print) while the 1998 restoration shows up on Cartoon Network Japan.\n\nA lot of these 1997/1998 prints are not shown frequently in America, but are shown more frequently in Europe, although this is random and not all the time these 1997/1998 restorations are aired. However, some TV networks such as Boing Spain and Mediaset Italia 1, air all the 1997/1998 restorations, with almost all of them having the dubbed disclaimer at the end (although the 1998 prints of Canned Feud, The Foghorn Leghorn, Golden Yeggs and Tweety's S.O.S. are aired without the dubbed disclaimer on Mediaset Italia 1).\n\nHere's another oddity: \"A Mouse Divided\" currently airs on Boomerang USA as the 1998 restoration without the dubbed disclaimer on the original ending card, as all the very few 1998 restorations that air on Boomerang USA (Greedy For Tweety, Robot Rabbit, Don't Give Up The Sheep, Wideo Wabbit, Big House Bunny) all have the dubbed disclaimer intact.\n\n1. They should add the 1998 dubbed prints to DVD releases, if they aren't in HD, why the need? One weird thing about A Mouse Divided is that the black borders are on the cartoon until after the drunk stork's laugh iris out, weird? Usually the borders disappear after the credits.\n\n2. Isn't the 1998 dubbed version of Dough for the do-do on the Volume 1 DVD?\n\n3. The USA dubbed version of What's Brewin' Bruin keeps the original ending card? with disclaimer. If so, what dubbed card does the EU version have?\n\n4. Other than the 1998 dubbed version cartoons listed on Wikia, did they restore any other cartoons in 1997-98, that are only available on television? @A-Cecil\n\nThat's true for the two shorts. (Only for the EU Dubbed Versions) I'm not sure if Good Night Elmer has its dubbed ending card for the USA Dubbed version, or if it keeps the original ending.\n\nevidenced from CN Latin America, good night elmer does keep original end card on both dubbed versions making it one of the few that keeps the original closing titles post-1936.\n\nThat looks like a restored print. Also, @A-Cecil, I think WB can make money by releasing the 1998 dubbed version cartoons. 1998 dubbed versions are very good quality. They should release the I love Tweety in the USA, that way they already have the restored prints and then they can make extra money. Fans really want new restored cartoons, not double dips. Also, are the 1997 dubbed versions just unrestored prints. it seemed if WB was being lazy?\n\n@Kevin Mo Let me explain to you about the 1997 dubbed prints.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE between those post-1948 shorts with the DUBBED VERSION (C) 1997 WARNER BROS and the THIS VERSION (C) 1997 WARNER BROS disclaimers.\n\n1. Firstly the post-48 shorts with the DUBBED VERSION (C) 1997 WARNER BROS. disclaimer. Shorts with this disclaimer are the ones coming from the Stars Of Space Jam VHS tapes/Japanese laserdisc as well as the VHS releases Carrotblanca: Looney Tunes Go To The Movies and Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote: Chariots Of Fur and Five Other Cartoons. These post-48 shorts with this disclaimer however are not restored at all, having them sourced from the same transfers used for the Warner Home Video 1990s laserdisc releases. The reason behind the dubbed disclaimer placed on these unrestored cartoons are only because of a dub track produced. As the result of this, they are NOT officially called \"dubbed versions\".\n\n2. Finally, the post-48 shorts with the THIS VERSION (C) 1997 WARNER BROS. disclaimer. Shorts with this disclaimer all come only from the Bugs and Friends' Japanese laserdisc and the European VHS tapes. These post-48 shorts were given a new restoration by Warner Bros. in 1997 for this international home video release, hence they are officially called \"dubbed versions\". The cartoons coming from this international release are Bugs Bunny cartoons plus cartoons featuring Daffy Duck, Tweety, Road Runner, Speedy Gonzales or Marvin the Martian, depending on the tape/disk, covering through the 1950s till 1965. While their NTSC versions (which is often rare in availability) present the dubbed version prints in normal-pitched audio and NTSC playback speed, their PAL versions however for some reason present the dubbed version prints in normal-pitched audio instead of high-pitched audio despite playing at PAL playback speed. These 1997 restorations do exist with and without the dubbed disclaimer.\n\nThat's a VHS/LaserDisc print, we are lucky to have the 1998 dubbed print on DVD.\n\n@Kevin Mo the Golden Jubilee transfers from 1986 appear exclusively on VHS. They are never released on Laserdisc.\n\nNot counting the Japanese laserdiscs in circulation, there is only one unrestored remaster that is used for the laserdisc releases of the post-48 shorts, which is first created in 1988 by Warner Bros. This WB video remasters created in 1988 and appears on the Laserdiscs and all the Looney Tunes VHS releases by Warner Home Video from 1988 to 1996 have a cleaner look and better colors than earlier transfers of post-1948 shorts (Oldest TV prints, The Looney Tunes Video Show VHS, Golden Jubilee VHS), have full wide viewing (as opposed to the cropped pan-and-scan method used on many prints of the Golden Jubilee tape series) and either have black borders or no borders in the title sequence. For cartoons that have never been restored at all, this are the best way to see them. Some of these kind of transfers have very vibrant and saturated colors despite the fact that they are not restored at all, such as Tweety's Circus, Catty Cornered, Bugsy and Mugsy, Fast and Furry-Ous, Gone Batty, A Street Cat Named Sylvester, Mouse Wreckers, Feline Frame-Up, etc.\n\nMany of these prints have been shown on TV, especially ABC, Nickelodeon, The WB, Cartoon Network and Boomerang.\n\nAnd to give you an idea, this is how the 1988 WB video remaster (a.k.a. Laserdisc print) of \"Bugsy and Mugsy\" looks like (taken from GUFFAW AND ORDER: Looney Tunes Fight Crime laserdisc release):\n\nA lot of post-48 shorts exist as this 1988 WB video remasters (a.k.a. Laserdisc prints), but not all of them are released on VHS/Laserdisc between 1988-1999 for some reason, and some of these transfers never even made it on home video.\n\n(Note: These lists below do not include any of the B&W shorts from the Sunset Productions package or any of the modern revival Looney Tunes shorts from 1979-1999)\n\n1988 WB video remasters (A.K.A.
