And like with similar news earlier in the year, the delay is a result of the Archive's disc replicator, Allied Vaughn, being overwhelmed with orders from a variety of labels.\n\nAmong the July titles being delayed is the 1939 comedy Idiot's Delight. Starring Clark Gable and Norma Shearer, the Blu-ray is now set for release on August 13.\n\nDespite Idiot's Delight originally being released by MGM, the Blu-ray is still scheduled to include two Warner Bros. cartoons among its special features: The Good Egg (1939) and It's an Ill Wind with Porky. Both cartoons are making their debuts in HD.\n\nThe Idiot's Delight Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on August 13 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nJuly 28, 2024\n\nNew Witch Hazel Mini-Guide Launched\n\nA quick guide for all of your witchy needs\n\nNot a normal news update, but July 24 marked the 70th anniversary of the release of Bewitched Bunny, and to celebrate we have launched a brand new mini-guide just for Witch Hazel.\n\nLike with the mini-guide we launched last month for the Tasmanian Devil, it's just short and sweet. No introductions, no bells and whistles; just copying and pasting the info from other sections of the site to present all of Hazel's cartoons together.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nIdiot's Delight Warner Archive Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nComing July 30; includes HD debuts of The Good Egg (1939) and It's an Ill Wind\n\nAfter having first been announced on Facebook way back on May 28, Warner Archive's upcoming Blu-ray release of the 1939 comedy Idiot's Delight is now finally up for pre-order, and a $21.99 retail price has been revealed. Starring Clark Gable and Norma Shearer and featuring Gable doing a musical number of (of all things) \"Puttin' On the Ritz,\" the Blu-ray is set for release on July 30.\n\nBut before we dig deeper into Idiot's Delight, Warner Archive also recently threw everyone a few curveballs on its June wave of Blu-ray releases, swapping out a number of announced bonus cartoons for other titles, or in a couple of cases just adding new titles outright. The label gave no explanation as to why these changes were made, and some of these changes aren't even reflected on the releases' back covers.\n\nThe Alfred Hitchcock Mr. & Mrs. Smith Blu-ray is no longer containing The Cat's Tale or Sport Chumpions but rather Holiday Highlights and Stage Fright\n\nIn addition to the previously announced The Sneezing Weasel and Love and Curses, the Blu-ray of The Shining Hour also contains a third bonus cartoon, Porky's Five & Ten. This is the version first used on Porky Pig 101 with the missing WB shield zoom.\n\nThe Blu-ray for The Man I Love no longer contains Roughly Squeaking or Slick Hare but rather Rabbit Transit and Crowing Pains.\n\nFinally, the Act of Violence Blu-Ray now offers The Shell-Shocked Egg as a bonus cartoon!\n\nBack to Idiot's Delight but keeping on the subject of cartoons as special features, despite the movie originally being released by MGM, the Blu-ray will include two Warner Bros. cartoons among its special features: The Good Egg (1939) and It's an Ill Wind with Porky. This will be Egg's first apppearance on home video since the Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc series and Wind's debut on Blu-ray after first appearing unremastered on the Porky Pig 101 DVD. Both cartoons are making their debuts in HD.\n\nBUT! (yeah, here it comes)\n\nThe Blu-ray will be using HD masters initially prepared for HBO Max. It's an Ill Wind has no glaring problems despite not being sourced from the negative, but The Good Egg has some dreaded Photoshopping done to its title sequence.\n\nIt's getting to the point where one has to start wondering why the Archive can't just zoom in to crop out these issues like they do for the Collector's Choice discs.\n\nRegardless, if you were getting this solely for The Good Egg, you have been warned.\n\nThe Idiot's Delight Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on July 30 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nNew Tasmanian Devil Mini-Guide Launched\n\nA quick guide for all of your Taz needs\n\nNot a normal news update, but while everyone is celebrating Juneteenth or waiting patiently for the launch of MeTV Toons, we wanted to officially announce that in honor of today's 70th anniversary of the release of Devil May Hare, we have launched a brand new mini-guide just for the Tasmanian Devil.\n\nWe say \"mini-guide\" because it's short and sweet. No introductions, no bells and whistles; just copying and pasting the info from other sections of the site to present all of Taz's cartoons together. This may or may not be something we will do in the future for other supporting characters.\n\nEnjoy, and Happy Birthday Taz!\n\nMay 18, 2024\n\nWarner Archive The Shining Hour Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order and DATE CHANGE\n\nNow Coming June 25; includes HD debuts of Love and Curses and The Sneezing Weasel\n\nA week after Warner Archive's June Blu-ray releases first started showing up for pre-order (and all with a new street date), the last lingering title has finally joined them. The final straggler is the film adaptation of the Broadway play The Shining Hour, which is now up for pre-order, and a $21.99 retail price has been revealed. Starring Joan Crawford and Margaret Sullavan, the Blu-ray is now set for release on June 25.\n\nDespite the movie originally being released by MGM, the Blu-ray will include two Warner Bros. cartoons among its special features: Love and Curses and Tex Avery's The Sneezing Weasel. Curses had been used as a bonus on past DVD releases for Gold Diggers in Paris, but this will mark Weasel's first home video release since the Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5 laserdisc from 1997.\n\nBUT! (yeah, sorry)\n\nThe Blu-ray will be using HD masters initially prepared for HBO Max. As longtime readers of our news site know, quality control on the opening titles has been extremely hit or miss, and unfortunately we're getting a double-dose of Photoshopped titles.\n\nJust look at what's going on to the left of the \"Blue Ribbon\" seal. Not that we'd ever offer any suggestion or compromise for these atrocities, but was red really that hard of a color to mimic that they needed to clone-stamp and smudge-stretch the edge of the picture? Back in the day when Warner Bros. or Turner wanted to protect information on a frame (like a title or a credit), they would create an obvious windowbox. Just saying, the solution to this \"problem\" was already figured out, and with far more finesse.\n\nAs for Love and Curses, sigh...just look. The image at the left is from older, pre-HBO television broadcasts. The image at the right is what we're now getting, as recently seen on MeTV.\n\nOnce again, we post screenshots like these not to anger fans or to whine. We simply want everyone to be aware of what they're in for. Again, the bodies of the cartoons are perfectly fine, and we may very well get corrected versions on a future Collector's Choice volume. But until that may happen, consider yourself warned.\n\nThe Shining Hour on Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on June 25 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nWarner Archive Mr. & Mrs. Smith Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order and DATE CHANGE\n\nNow Coming June 25; includes HD debuts of The Cat's Tale and Sport Chumpions\n\nWarner Archive's June Blu-ray titles have started coming up for pre-order, but unfortunately with these pre-orders have come the news that all of the titles are being pushed back a week. This has been a recurring issue with Warner Archive releases primarily because the label's disc replicator, Allied Vaughn, has started becoming overwhelmed with orders from not just the Archive but also a number of other studios and labels (Allied also handles replication for Studio Distribution Services, Disney, Paramount, Sony, and Hallmark, among many others).\n\nAmong the June titles being delayed is the Blu-ray debut of Alfred Hitchcock's lone outright comedy, Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Starring Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery as a long-married couple who discover that by a technicality their union isn't quite legal, the Blu-ray is now scheduled for release on June 25 and is now available to pre-order, while a retail price of $21.99 has also been revealed.\n\nDespite the movie originally being released by RKO, the Blu-ray will include two Warner Bros. cartoons among its ample special features: The Cat's Tale and Sport Chumpions. This release will mark the disc debut for both titles and their first home video release since the Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 3 laserdisc set back in 1992.\n\nBUT! (and you know what's coming)\n\nThe Blu-ray will be using HD masters initially prepared for HBO Max. As longtime readers of our news site know, quality control on the opening titles has been extremely hit or miss.\n\nFortunately, The Cat's Tale appears to have been able to get out unscathed. As for Sport Chumpions, however....\n\nYikes.\n\nAgain, we post screenshots like this just to make sure everyone is aware of what they're in for. The body of the cartoon is perfectly fine, but if this opening sequence is a dealbreaker for you, you have been warned.\n\nThe Mr. & Mrs. Smith Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on June 25 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nWarner Archive The Man I Love Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order and DATE CHANGE\n\nNow Coming June 25; includes HD double-dips of Roughly Squeaking and Slick Hare\n\nContinuing the news of Warner Archive's delayed June titles, the Blu-ray debut of the 1947 drama The Man I Love is now also up for pre-order, and a $21.99 retail price has been revealed. Directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Ida Lupino, the Blu-ray is now set for release on June 25.\n\nThough the disc's biggest selling point is the restoration of an entire sequence that had been missing from the film since 1956, it does also contain as special features two classic cartoons: Roughly Squeaking and Slick Hare. Both are double-dips on the format, as Roughly Squeaking last appeared on the Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: Chuck Jones Collection (though, in all fairness, the Blu-ray edition is currently out of print). Slick Hare, meanwhile, can easily be found on the Platinum Collection Volume Three.\n\nThe Blu-ray release of The Man I Love is scheduled for June 25 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\nClassic Cartoons Featured on Warner Archive June Blu-rays\n\nMany bonus cartoons, including three disc debuts\n\nThis week Warner Archive announced their June slate of Blu-ray titles, and true to form it's another impressive assortment of classic films and fan-favorite TV shows. And as has been the norm, a number of titles will interest collectors of classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. The June batch of Warner Archive Blu-rays are due to come out on June 18.\n\nAt press time, the specs for the special features on each title's announcement did not indicate whether the cartoons will be featured in HD. We have reached out to the Archive for clarification. It would be a safe bet to assume as much, but nevertheless without confirmation we ask that consumers tread lightly.\n\nFirst up is something for Alfred Hitchcock fans, the Blu-ray debut of Hitchcock's only full-fledged romantic comedy, Mr. & Mrs. Smith starring Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery (it was the last film with Lombard released during her lifetime). Despite being a legitimate hit upon its release, it's not very good, and the director himself never thought too highly of it, but historically this marks the final Hollywood Hitchcock film to see a Blu-ray release.\n\nThe disc's special features are more enticing than the actual feature. Included are two radio adaptations, one starring Lombard herself opposite Bob Hope and another with Errol Flynn and Lana Turner, and two Warner Bros. cartoons: The Cat's Tale and the public-domain staple Sport Chumpions. (Even though the movie was an RKO release.) This Blu-ray will mark the disc debut for both titles and their first home video release since the Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 3 laserdisc set back in 1992.\n\nNext is 1947's sorta film noir drama The Man I Love, directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Ida Lupino (no Alvino Ray Gun, though). Notably, the film was scanned in 4K from its original camera negative, restoring six minutes back into the movie that had been cut for a 1956 re-release and has remained unseen since (reportedly an entire musical number).\n\nThe cartoons included on this disc are the only two double-dips among the new announcements, Roughly Squeaking and Slick Hare. The former was previously released on both DVD and Blu-ray on the Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: Chuck Jones Collection, while the latter was last used as a bonus on the Dark Passage Blu-ray.\n\nFinally it's the film adaptation of the Broadway play The Shining Hour. Starring Joan Crawford and Margaret Sullavan, it's a sort of romantic rectangle complete with jealousy, creepy farmhands, and a house-burning!\n\nKinda like with the Hitchcock title, despite being an MGM release, the disc does contain the Blu-ray debuts of two more Warner Bros. cartoons: Love and Curses and Tex Avery's The Sneezing Weasel. Curses had been used as a bonus on past DVD releases for Gold Diggers in Paris, but this will mark Weasel's first home video release since the Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 5 laserdisc from 1997.\n\nOnce we get confirmation if the cartoons will be in HD will we do our customary breakdown on possible problems, as most of these shorts were remastered for HBO Max...and you know what that could mean.\n\nThe Mr. & Mrs. Smith, The Man I Love, and The Shining Hour Blu-rays are all scheduled to be released on June 18, and official prices and links to pre-order them on Amazon will be posted here as soon as they appear.\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nThe Mask of Fu Manchu Warner Archive Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nIncludes HD debuts of Freddy the Freshman and The Queen Was in the Parlor\n\nBack on March 20 Warner Archive announced their April titles, with the Blu-ray releases originally scheduled for April 30. This past week all of the announced titles have finally become available for pre-order, but with the unfortunate update that they had all been delayed by a week. One affected title is 1932's The Mask of Fu Manchu with the one and only Boris Karloff as the iconic title villain. Boasting a new \"4K scan of best preservation elements,\" the Blu-ray is now set for release on May 7 and is now finally available to pre-order at all of the usual online stores such as Amazon.\n\nAmong the disc's special features are the HD debuts of two classic black-and-white Merrie Melodies, Freddy the Freshman and The Queen Was in the Parlor. Having both last been seen on home video in the 1990s in the Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc series, this Blu-ray marks both cartoons' debuts newly remastered and their debuts on a modern disc format.\n\nBUT (and you know what's coming)....\n\nThe remastered HD versions of the two cartoons had been prepared for HBO Max (at press time Freddy the Freshman has yet to actually premiere on the Max service). Unfortunately, both cartoons fell victim to the rampant \"Photoshopping\" that was done to many shorts' title sequences by an overseas post-production house over the summer of 2020.\n\nFreddy the Freshman comes out the more tolerable of the two alterations, with most of the graphic tinkering only affecting the Merrie Melodies title screen. (The edges of the musical notes at the top and bottom of the image are a good indication of where the original title screen ended.) Thankfully a fade out present in the original cartoon saves the short from any messing around on the actual title card, which itself leads into the cartoon's opening gag, as the credits are all written on the back of Freddy's car.\n\nThe Queen Was in the Parlor, however, seems to have received bigger visual vandalism. In the opening sequence, usually only the right half of Goopy Geer's marotte (jester stick) can be seen, and in most prints the left side of the title screen used to cut it right in half. Now the rest of the marotte can be fully seen, and it appears as if Goopy's elbow might have been digitally added, too.\n\nLike always, we mention these changes for anyone who may consider these to be a dealbreaker. Past the title sequences, the cartoons play intact and haven't looked this good on home video since the end of the last century.\n\nThe Mask of Fu Manchu is scheduled to be released on May 7 on Blu-ray only and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\nLooney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3 Warner Archive Blu-ray Now Available\n\n18 disc debuts! 6 home video debuts!\n\nToday's the day, everyone! It's been a brutal month-and-a-half, but we made it! Today Warner Archive has released its much-anticipated Looney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3, the label's latest Blu-ray containing twenty-five classic Warner Bros. cartoons all making their physical debut in HD. With films covering a span of three decades, the 25-cartoon compilation is now available through the Archive's official shop at Amazon and other online retailers.\n\nThe Blu-ray contains the following cartoons....\n\nA Feud There Was (1938) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHop, Skip and a Chump (1942) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nChina Jones (1959) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nCinderella Meets Fella (1938) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nDumb Patrol (1964) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nEgghead Rides Again (1937) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nElmer's Pet Rabbit (1964) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHobo Bobo (1947) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHoneymoon Hotel (1934) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nI Only Have Eyes for You (1937) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nMexican Joyride (1947) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Is the Name (1935) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nOf Rice and Hen (1953) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nPre-Hysterical Hare (1958) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nPunch Trunk (1953) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nQuentin Quail (1946) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nRiff Raffy Daffy (1948) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nSaddle Silly (1941) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nSheep Ahoy (1954) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nThe Mouse on 57th Street (1961) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nThe Sheepish Wolf (1942) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nThere Auto Be a Law (1953) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nTugboat Granny (1956) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nWar and Pieces (1964) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nWet Hare (1962) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nLike we've done with the earlier volumes in this series, we are fully recommending this title. We're getting some new-to-disc Daffy cartoons (including one we thought we'd never see, and you can honestly take your pick of which one we're referring to!), a nice mix of one-shots alongside shorts with the star characters, a number of upgrades of cartoons that had only previously been used as special features on past Warner DVDs (and a much-needed redo of a previously remastered Porky-and-Daffy!), and SIX U.S. home video debuts, including three Bugs Bunny titles!\n\n(And historically, with its release on this disc, Pre-Hysterical Hare is the final 1950s Bugs short to be released on home video.)\n\nDespite the constant state of flux the home video industry has been in, this is nevertheless a very exciting time for Looney Tunes fans. We can only hope this new volume does well so that the Collector's Choice series can continue.\n\nThe Looney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3 Blu-ray is now available online and retails for $21.99. Order it now on Amazon.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nJerry Beck on Stu's Show March 20\n\nDeadline for e-mail questions is March 15\n\nAnd here we go again, folks! It's been a big year in animation, and who better to talk about it than the one and only Jerry Beck as he makes his annual return to Stu's Show, the online series hosted by pop culture/television historian Stu Shostak. The show is a video/audio simulcast, so you can either listen or watch it as it premieres. The show will air at 7PM EST and is available as a free stream for those who tune in (afterward, fans can purchase a \"rerun\" of the episode online). Information on the various ways to access the show can be found on its web site: www.stusshow.com.\n\nAnd BOY, is there a lot to talk about this time! Mickey Mouse's appearance in Steamboat Willie entering the public domain, the renewed focus on animation at Warner Archive (including the continuing Looney Tunes Collector's Choice series), the ongoing status changes of the Coyote vs. ACME feature film, and the breaking news that Disney will shut down its own home video distribution and license titles out to Sony! And if all these changes are making your head spin, Jerry will bring some stability by again offering three rare cartoons to screen at the end of the show.\n\nAnd as is now the norm for Jerry's appearances on Stu's Show, this will be a pre-taped episode. Stu will read viewers' e-mailed questions to Jerry during the show like always, BUT there is a deadline to get them in by the time the show is taped. We reached out to Stu, and he told us that viewers have until March 15 to e-mail questions to: comments@stusshow.com\n\nAs we always stress, remember that Jerry only works as a consultant for Warner Bros. (and other labels) on select projects. He does not have final say on programming, remastering, or release matters; he can only try to comment on situations as best as he can...and even then, he is sometimes contractually required to not say anything about certain upcoming releases. The information he gives is never meant to be inferred as any sort of official statement from a studio and that they can and do change plans on a whim without telling him. Anything Jerry is authorized to reveal will be said during the show, so please do not barrage Stu and Jerry with \"When will this cartoon or show come out on DVD?\" questions.

Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nLooney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3 Warner Archive Blu-ray Announced for March 12\n\n18 disc debuts! 6 home video debuts!\n\nAnd here we go, folks! Barely a month after the release of its predecessor, today Warner Archive announced on their Facebook page the hotly anticipated Looney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3 on Blu-ray. Containing twenty-five classic cartoons all new to the format, the Blu-ray will see release on March 12.\n\nAt press time, the disc is not available to pre-order, nor has a retail price been revealed, but it will most likely be in the same ballpark as the first two volumes. Also, there is still no word yet if a DVD edition will be made available for any of the volumes.\n\nThe Blu-ray will contain the following cartoons, listed for now in (almost) alphabetical order....\n\nA Feud There Was (1938) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHop, Skip and a Chump (1942) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nChina Jones (1959) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nCinderella Meets Fella (1938) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nDumb Patrol (1964) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nEgghead Rides Again (1937) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nElmer's Pet Rabbit (1964) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHobo Bobo (1947) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nHoneymoon Hotel (1934) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nI Only Have Eyes for You (1937) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nMexican Joyride (1947) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Is the Name (1935) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nOf Rice and Hen (1953) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nPre-Hysterical Hare (1958) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nPunch Trunk (1953) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nQuentin Quail (1946) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nRiff Raffy Daffy (1948) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nSaddle Silly (1941) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nSheep Ahoy (1954) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nThe Mouse on 57th Street (1961) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nThe Sheepish Wolf (1942) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nThere Auto Be a Law (1953) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nTugboat Granny (1956) (NEW TO DISC!)\n\nWar and Pieces (1964) (NEWLY REMASTERED!)\n\nWet Hare (1962) (BRAND NEW TO HOME VIDEO!)\n\nThis time around, eighteen of the twenty-five cartoons on this collection are brand new to modern optical disc formats, having only previously been released on either VHS or laserdisc. We have six home video debuts in the mix as well, including three Bugs shorts: Pre-Hysterical Hare, Wet Hare, and Dumb Patrol--not exactly cream-of-the-crop Bugs, but considering what's left to remaster and release on disc, this is a huge step toward finishing his filmography. Most of the remaining cartoons here have only previously been released unremastered as extras on past Warner Home Video DVDs.\n\n(For those wondering, these are all of the Bugs Bunny shorts left to remaster and release uncut: All This and Rabbit Stew, Any Bonds Today?, Fresh Hare, Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips, Gas, Three Brothers, The Goofy Gophers, A Feather in His Hare, A-Lad-in His Lamp, Which Is Witch, Horse Hare, Lighter Than Hare, Devil's Feud Cake, and The Iceman Ducketh.)\n\nAnd it appears that we're getting another upgrade from a previously remastered title with Riff Raffy Daffy. That short last appeared remastered back in 2012 on the Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham DVD from the Looney Tunes Super Stars series, but even then it couldn't escape the rather muddy look most prints seem to possess (the film was originally processed in Cinecolor, if that's any indication). We can only hope that it's been newly remastered again from the negative and cleaned up--it definitely needed it.\n\nThis is arguably an even better mix of cartoons than we saw on Vol. 2, with some missing-in-action Chuck Jones one-shots like Punch Trunk and The Mouse on 57th Street, a number of 1930s Tex Avery titles remastered, the long-awaited return of Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog to home video, and two key cartoons in the Egghead/Elmer evolution. There's some slightly un-PC Daffy cartoons (including another Arthur Davis favorite), Chuck Jones's final classic-era Road Runner short, yet another Tweety cartoon coming to disc after having only been released in the Japanese I Love Tweety series, and with Pre-Hysterical Hare we can now historically say that every 1950s Bugs Bunny cartoon has been released on home video and is currently available on disc!\n\nThe disc's official synopsis, as posted by Warner Archive's Facebook page, reads as follows....\n\nThey say the third time's the charm, to which we'll add THREE times the fun and 300 times the laughs! Looney Tunes Collector's Choice Volume 3 provides 25 classic Warner Bros. cartoons, here for the first time on Blu-ray and spanning 30 years (1934-1964), the Golden Age of animation! And with rarities featuring Daffy Duck, Foghorn Leghorn, and Tweety & Sylvester - directed by Warner Bros. cartoon geniuses Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Tex Avery and Robert McKimson-this collection is one for the ages. Highlights include some of the first and last original Bugs Bunny shorts; landmark early appearances by Egghead and Elmer, hilarious rarities with Bobo the Elephant and Quentin Quail; and the first color Merrie Melodies short \"Honeymoon Hotel\".\n\nThis sounds like such an amazing collection, and of course we will be recommending this both here and on our home page. We're only three volumes in and we're seeing cartoons that many fans thought would never see a legitimate release. And there is still so much more to release after this!\n\nLooney Tunes Collector's Choice Vol. 3 is scheduled to be released on March 12 on Blu-ray only, and a price and link to pre-order it will be posted here as soon as they become available.\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nWarner Archive Joe's Apartment Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nIncludes HD debuts of The Lady in Red, Superior Duck, and From Hare to Eternity\n\nAfter a month and a half of waiting, and just a day after one title had gone live, the remainder of Warner Archive's announced January releases are now finally coming up for pre-order. And it's definitely a diverse bunch of films, including 1996's Joe's Apartment, the wacky comedy produced by MTV and starring Jerry O'Connell and thousands of singing-and-dancing cockroaches. Boasting a brand new 4K scan of the negative, the Blu-ray is set for release on January 30 and is now finally available to pre-order at all of the usual online stores such as Amazon.\n\nAmong the disc's special features are three cartoons making their debuts in HD: the appropriately bug-themed The Lady in Red and two 1990s Chuck Jones shorts, Superior Duck and From Hare to Eternity. Duck and Hare have been used numerous times as off-the-shelf bonuses on past DVDs and Blu-rays, but The Lady in Red is making its first appearance on home video since the second Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc set.\n\nAs an added bonus, The Lady in Red will be from the recent HBO Max master, which normally when mentioned would be cause for alarm but this time it's noteworthy because that version includes the short's original title card. Most often seen in the past as a \"Blue Ribbon\" reissue (including on laserdisc), this restoration of its original title sequence is a welcomed surprise.\n\nThe Joe's Apartment Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on January 30 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nWarner Archive The Prince and the Pauper (1937) Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nIncludes HD debuts of Plenty of Money and You, Streamlined Greta Green, and A Sunbonnet Blue\n\nAnd the Warner Archive January pre-orders are coming fast and furious, with another announced title going live being the 1937 version of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, starring Errol Flynn and twins Billy and Bobby Mauch and arguably the most known \"straight\" adaptation of the story (no offense to Mickey Mouse, Garfield, or the Monkees). Boasting a brand new 4K scan of the negative, the Blu-ray is set for release on January 30 and is now finally available to pre-order at all of the usual online stores such as Amazon.\n\nAmong the disc's special features are three 1930s Merrie Melodies all making their debuts in HD: Plenty of Money and You, Streamlined Greta Green, and A Sunbonnet Blue. Although an unremastered version of Plenty... had been used on DVD releases of Gold Diggers of 1937, the other two shorts are making their disc debuts on this release and haven't been seen on home video since the final Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc set.\n\nNow here comes the standard HBO Max warning.\n\nAll three HD versions were prepared for HBO Max, and unfortunately all three were subject to the bizarre \"Photoshopping\" that was done to make the cartoons HDTV-friendly. Like usual, these alterations only affect the title sequences, where on all three shorts extra bullseye rings are present. Plenty of Money and You and A Sunbonnet Blue are also \"Blue Ribbon\" reissues, and so extra visual information was created for the Blue Ribbon title cards (extra shadow for the statue, extra red space, etc.). And finally, it should be noted that the Blue Ribbon title card for Plenty... was one of the early ones that would darken the background when the title lettering appears (such as on the retitled-and-reissued The Wild Hare); the HBO Max version has the red color of the background remain, so count that among the differences, too. You have been warned!\n\nThe Prince and the Pauper on Blu-ray is scheduled to be released on January 30 and will retail for $21.99. Pre-order it now on Amazon.\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nWarner Archive Rover Dangerfield Blu-ray Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nIncludes HD debuts of Dog Daze and Dog Collared\n\nIt's been nearly a month and a half since Warner Archive took to Facebook to announce its January Blu-ray titles, and with three federal holidays taking place since then it has taken online stores a while to get some of those titles up for pre-order. At press time, the only release ready to go is the odd 1991 animated family film Rover Dangerfield, starring--who else--Rodney in the lead role as a wisecracking basset hound. Boasting a new 1080p HD master, the Blu-ray is set for release on January 30 and is now finally available to pre-order at all of the usual online stores such as Amazon.\n\nAmong the disc's special features are two Warner Bros. cartoons making their debuts in HD: Robert McKimson's Dog Collared with Porky and 1937's Dog Daze from Friz Freleng. Although Dog Collared last appeared on DVD back on Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham from the Looney Tunes Super Stars series, Dog Daze is making its disc debut and its first appearance on home video since the final Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc set.\n\nIt needs to be mentioned that Dog Daze was remastered for HBO Max, and there does appear to be some Photoshopping done to the opening titles on that version, with some \"extra\" bullseye rings being present. The rest of the cartoon plays unaltered. So, like with all of these Warner Archive Blu-rays using the HBO Max versions for extras, if that's a dealbreaker, you have been properly warned."
