        "text": "Plot\n\nMarc Antony is guarding a construction site when he catches a bag and begins barking at it. Coming out of the bag, it reveals Pussyfoot and he barks at her. However, she is not afraid, believing the dog is her friend and Marc Antony's emotions soften. Before returning to guard duty, he leaves Pussyfoot a sausage for her to snack on and she gratefully kisses him. However, trouble is ahead, thanks to a hungry alley cat who has seen the sausage and wants it for himself."
