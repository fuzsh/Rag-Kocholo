        "text": "Good news for Physical Media collectors – Warner Archive Collection is giving its fiercest collectors their choice of rare titles in the Looney Tunes catalog. Announced by George Feltenstein (and yours truly) earlier today on The Extra’s podcast, a new 20-title collection, Vol. 1 of a new series called Looney Tunes Collector’s Choice, is expected to release in late May on blu-ray. And with it a group of first-time-on-blu-ray, restored HD Warner cartoon classics – not the same restorations from HBO-Max and MeTV: an upgrade.\n\nAll blu-ray premieres – uncut – with physical media exclusives that are not on HBO-Max streaming, or MeTV broadcast: including Bugs Bunny in Chuck Jones’ Beanstalk Bunny (1955) and Arthur Davis’ 1947 Catch As Cats Can – a zany cartoon featuring a Crosby parrot and a Sinatra canary and a loopy, early version of Sylvester. Other cartoons on this hilarious set include Frank Tashlin’s A Tale Of Two Mice (1945), Robert McKimson’s Daffy Doodles (1946) and Friz Freleng’s His Bitter Half (1950).\n\nThe official street date is May 30th. Pre-orders have begun on Amazon.\n\nUPDATE: This collection contains the following animated short subjects:\n\n(in alphabetical order)"
