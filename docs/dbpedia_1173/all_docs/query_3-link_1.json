        "text": "American film studio\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures is an American film production and distribution company of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group division of Warner Bros. Entertainment (both ultimately owned by Warner Bros. Discovery). The studio is the flagship producer of live-action feature films within the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group unit, and is based at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California. Animated films produced by Warner Bros. Pictures Animation are also released under the studio banner.[3]\n\nFounded in 1923 by brothers Harry Warner, Albert Warner, Sam Warner, and Jack L. Warner, in addition to producing its own films, it handles filmmaking operations, theatrical distribution, marketing and promotion for films produced and released by other Warner Bros. labels, including Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, New Line Cinema, DC Studios, and Castle Rock Entertainment, as well as various third-party producers.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, the others being New Line Cinema, DC Studios, Castle Rock Entertainment, and a minority stake in Spyglass Media Group. The most commercially successful film series from Warners include Harry Potter, DC Universe (formerly DC Extended Universe), Batman, The Lord of the Rings, and Monsterverse; Barbie is the studio's highest-grossing film worldwide with $1.4 billion.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Warner Bros. § History\n\nThe studio's predecessor (and the modern-day Warner Bros Entertainment as a whole) was founded as the Warner Features Company in New Castle, Pennsylvania, by filmmaker Sam Warner and his business partners and brothers, Harry, Albert, and Jack, in 1911.[5] They produced their first film, the Peril of the Plains[6] in 1912, which Sam directed for the St. Louis Motion Picture Company. In 1915, Sam and Jack moved to California to establish their production studio,[7] while Albert and Harry on July 8, 1915, set up the New York–based Warner Brothers Distributing Corporation to release the films.[8][9][10] In 1918, during WW1, to kickstart their business, the four Warner Brothers chose to produce an adaptation of the book My Four Years in Germany by James W. Gerard to be their first full-scale picture, as they were considered by the sensitivity of both the content and the war for their first production at the time.[11] The war film was a box office hit and helped the brothers establish themselves as a prestige studio.[12]\n\nOn April 4, 1923, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established as their main focus was entirely on the motion picture industry.[13] In 1927, Warner Bros. Pictures revolutionized the film industry when the American-Jewish Warner brothers released their first pictures \"talkie\" The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson. However, founding member Sam Warner died prior to the premiere of the film.[14] When the company diversified over the years, it was eventually rebranded to its current umbrella name, but Warner Bros. Pictures continued to be used as the name of the film production arm of the company.\n\nThe studio has released twenty-five films that have received an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination: Disraeli (1929), I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), 42nd Street (1933), Here Comes the Navy (1934), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935), Anthony Adverse (1936), The Life of Emile Zola (1937), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Four Daughters (1938), Jezebel (1938), Dark Victory (1939), to name a few.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950[15][16][17] films and cartoons to Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Popeye cartoons, originally from Paramount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold to United Artists (UA), which owned the company until 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired UA.[18][19]\n\nIn November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling 32% of control of the studio and music business to Seven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Elliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million.[20] Eventually, the company, including the studio, was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts on July 14, 1967.[21]\n\nIn 1982, during their independent years, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions, the film production arm of France-based then-struggling personal-care company Faberge Inc.[22]\n\nIn 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt, Turner kept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the UA library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to the RKO Radio Pictures library) while spinning off the rest of MGM.[23]\n\nIn 1989, Warner Communications acquired Lorimar-Telepictures Corporation and merged with Time Inc. to form Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery).[24][25] Lorimar's catalogue included the post-1974 library of Rankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library of Monogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.\n\nIn 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studio Hanna-Barbera and the Ruby-Spears library from Great American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Castle Rock Entertainment on December 22, 1993[26][27] and New Line Cinema on January 28, 1994.[28][29] On October 10, 1996, Time Warner Entertainment acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.'s pre-1950 library back home. In addition, Warner Bros. only owns Castle Rock Entertainment's post-1994 library.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe division was incorporated as Warner Bros. Pictures on March 3, 2003, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases.[30] The company became part of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, which was established in 2008, and Jeff Robinov was appointed the first president of the company.[31] In 2017, longtime New Line executive Toby Emmerich joined as president.[32] In January 2018, he was elevated to chairman.[33][34] On October 23, 2018, it was announced Lynne Frank, President of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.[35] In June 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures signed an agreement with SF Studios to have their films distributed in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.[36]\n\nAs with most other film distributors, Warner Bros. Pictures struggled with releasing films during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on theater openings. After pushing several films planned for 2020 into 2021, WB announced in December 2020 that they would take the unusual approach of having their entire slate of 2021 films planned for both theatrical release as well as having a simultaneous one-month period of availability on the HBO Max streaming service, in a similar manner for how they were releasing Wonder Woman 1984 that month. After one month, such films would still be available in theaters and would then later be available via home media under typical release schedules.[37] The move to include streaming, dubbed \"Project Popcorn\", was criticized by production companies, directors, and actors as Warner Bros. Pictures had not informed anyone about the plan ahead of the announcement, as well of concerns of lower payouts due to the streaming options,[38] leading Warner Bros. Pictures to alter its compensation rates for the affected films by January 2021 to provide larger payouts to casts and crews of these films.[39]\n\nIn March 2021 Warner Bros. announced that for 2022 they will discontinue their same-day HBO Max and theatrical release model in favor of a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window.[40] This is part of an agreement the studio reached with Cineworld (who operates Regal Cinemas).[41]\n\nOn June 1, 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the company formerly known as Discovery, Inc. prior to its acquisition of WarnerMedia two months earlier, announced that Emmerich will step down as head of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group after a transition period, and that it would be divided into three separate units; Warner Bros. Pictures/New Line Cinema, DC Films, and Warner Animation Group. Former MGM executives Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy would serve as the co-chairs of Warner Bros. Pictures (and temporarily oversee the other two divisions until new executives are hired for them), while Emmerich would start his own production company and enter into a five-year distribution and funding agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures.[43][44] On June 8, COO Carolyn Blackwood announced that she was stepping down as well.[45]\n\nSteve Spira returned as president of business affairs for Warner Bros. in June 2022, while De Luca and Abdy took over from Emmerich in July 2022. Former president Alan Horn was appointed as a consultant for WBD President David Zaslav, working with De Luca and Abdy.[46]\n\nIn August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.[47] That same month, plans for film distribution at the studio were changed, with the studio relying more on theatrical releases than HBO Max-only releases.[48]\n\nWalter Hamada, the president of DC Films, stepped down on October 19, 2022.[49] President of Production & Development Courtenay Valenti exited on October 28 and was replaced by Jesse Ehrman.[50][51] On June 9, 2023, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group was renamed as the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.[52]\n\nFilm library\n\n[edit]\n\nMergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.[53]\n\nShared universes\n\n[edit]\n\nWarner Bros. owns some shared universes. Some of them are based on books and comics, including some of the highest grossing IP's in the movie industry.\n\nIP No. Films Notes DC Extended Universe 15 Movies based on DC Comics. DCEU was Warner Bros.'s first iteration of a shared universe. The DC Universe serves as an upcoming reboot, led by James Gunn.

The Lego Movie 4 Warner Bros owned the rights to Lego films up until the end of 2019. More Lego movies were planned, but were cancelled after Universal Pictures bought the Lego film rights. Cancelled sequels include a sequel to The Lego Batman Movie, called Lego Superfriends.[54][55]\n\nFilm series\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Release date No. of films Notes Gold Diggers 1923–51 7 Looney Tunes 1930–present 8 Penrod and Sam 1931–38 2 Perry Mason 1934–37 6 Philo Vance 1934–40 5 Torchy Blane 1937–39 9 Four Daughters 1938–41 4 Nancy Drew 1938–2019 6 Secret Service 1939–40 4 Ocean's 1960–present 5 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures (2001–present) Dirty Harry 1971–88 The Exorcist 1973–2005 4 co-production with Morgan Creek (3–4) Oh, God! 1977–84 3 Every Which Way but Loose 1978–80 2 Superman 1978–2006 5 co-production with Legendary Pictures (2006); Except for Supergirl, which was distributed by Tri-Star Pictures Mad Max 1979–present 5 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures Poseidon 1979–2006 2 Friday the 13th 1980–2009 co-production with Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema The Shining 1980–2019 Arthur 1981–2011 3 Blade Runner 1982–2017 2 co-production with Alcon Entertainment and Columbia Pictures (2017) National Lampoon's Vacation 1983–2015 5 Gremlins 1984–90 2 co-production with Amblin Entertainment Police Academy 1984–94 7 Sesame Street 1985–present 2 co-production with Sesame Workshop The Color Purple 1985–2023 co-production with Amblin Entertainment (1984–2023), The Guber-Peters Company (1984), OW Films, SGS Pictures, Quincy Jones Productions and Domain Entertainment (all 2023) Lethal Weapon 1987–98 4 The Lost Boys 1987–2010 3 Beetlejuice 1988–present 1 Batman 1989–97 4 co-production with Polygram Pictures (1989–95) Under Siege 1992–95 2 co-production with Regency Enterprises Unforgiven 1992–2013 Grumpy Old Men 1993–95 The Fugitive 1993–98 Free Willy 1993–2010 4 co-production with Regency Enterprises Major League 1994–98 2 distribution only; co-production with Morgan Creek Ace Ventura 1994–2009 3 Eraser 1996–2022 2 Twister 1996–2024 co-production with Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment (both 1996–2024), The Kennedy/Marshall Company and Domain Pictures (both 2024) The Matrix 1999–present 4 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures Analyze 1999–2002 2 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures and TriBeCa Productions Pokémon 1999–2019 4 US distribution only; co-production with The Pokémon Company Deep Blue Sea 1999–2020 3 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures The Whole Yards 2000–04 2 distribution only; co-production with Morgan Creek (2000) and Franchise Pictures Miss Congeniality 2000–05 co-production with Castle Rock Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures Tom and Jerry 2001–present 16 co-production with Turner Entertainment Cats & Dogs 2001–20 3 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures (1–2) Wizarding World 2001–present 11 Scooby-Doo 2002–present 6 Kangaroo Jack 2003–04 2 co-production with Jerry Bruckheimer Films Terminator 2003–09 US distribution only; co-production with Columbia Pictures A Cinderella Story 2004–present 6 Laura's Star 2004–11 5 The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2005–08 2 co-production with Alloy Entertainment The Dark Knight trilogy 2005–12 3 co-production with Legendary Pictures Willy Wonka 2005–present 2 co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures Happy Feet 2006–11 300 2006–present co-production with Legendary Pictures The Hangover 2009–13 3 Final Destination 2009–present 2 co-production with New Line Cinema and Practical Pictures Sherlock Holmes co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures Watchmen 1 US distribution only; co-production with Paramount Pictures, DC Studios (both 2009–present) and Legendary Pictures (2009) Dolphin Tale 2011–14 2 co-production with Alcon Entertainment The Hobbit 2012–14 3 co-production with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, New Line Cinema and WingNut Films Magic Mike 2012–23 DC Extended Universe 2013–23 15 co-production with DC Entertainment (2013–16), DC Studios (2016–23) and RatPac Entertainment (2016) The Conjuring Universe 2013–present 7 co-production with Atomic Monster, The Safran Company and New Line Cinema The Lego Movie 2014–19 4 co-production with Warner Bros.
