        "text": "Logo descriptions by Jason Jones, James Fabiano, Cameron McCaffrey, Matt Williams, AmantiDorian, and RedheadXilamGuy\n\nLogo captures by Bob Fish, Eric S., Logofan95, JHProd, CuriousGeorge60, AmantiDorian, Shadeed A. Kelly, V of Doom, Mr.Logo, snelfu, SuperMuppet, Gilblitz112, and ClosingLogosHD,Thestudioghibifan, and RedheadXilamGuy\n\nEditions by V of Doom, Wiley207, AmantiDorian, CuriousGeorge60, MariluHennerArtist45, StephenCezar15 and Unnepad\n\nVideo captures courtesy of Eric S.and NinJutsuDude1997 (AmantiDorian)\n\nBackground: Warner Bros. Animation is the successor to the original Warner Bros. Cartoons established in 1944, which was known before as Leon Schlesinger Productions. The studio was established in 1980.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(October 11, 1960-1967)\n\nNickname: \"Animated WB Shield\"\n\nLogo: A generic variant of the 1955 Warner Bros. Television logo with Looney Tunes characters.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn The Bugs Bunny Show, the WB shield is seen on a red background. After a short fanfare, Bugs Bunny appears, and says, \"This folks, is a Warner Bros. Television production.\" The shield closes. At the end of the show, the Warner Bros. Television logo appears.\n\nOn The Porky Pig Show, during the credits the classic Warner Bros. Cartoons logo is seen on a bumper tire. As the camera zooms in, the tire opens like a door. Porky appears and utters his famous catchphrase, \"Th-th-th-that's all, folks!\" The door closes, but shortly after Porky is shown saying \"We've been brought to you by...\"\n\nOn The Road Runner Show, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner are seen on two different sides of the shield.\n\nFX/SFX: It depends on the variant. For The Bugs Bunny Show and The Porky Pig Show, it's the characters opening the shield. None for The Road Runner Show.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show. On The Road Runner Show, we hear the Road Runner's distinctive \"Meep meep!\" and tongue-popping-out sound effect.\n\nAvailability: Rare. It's seen on TV broadcasts of The Porky Pig Show and The Road Runner Show.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(1967-1970)\n\nNicknames: \"Animated W7\", \"Animated W7 Shield\"\n\nLogo: Another generic variant of the TV logo of the era, this time for the 1967 WB-SA TV logo.\n\nVariant: Some episodes of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show have the shield on a red background. The color of the shield is yellow, and the company name is absent. Suddenly, Bugs Bunny pops out of the shield, and says the following: \"This has been a Warner Bros. Seven Arts-\". Road Runner then pops out of the shield too and says: \"Beep, beep!\". Bugs then continues: \"Like the bird says, this has been a Warner Bros.-Seven Arts television presentation\". The shield then closes.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Rare. It's usually seen on The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show. Later used for some episodes of The Bugs Bunny Show before 1970.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(1972-1984)\n\nNickname: \"Animated Big (\\\\')\"\n\nLogo: Same as before, except the LT characters stand beside the 1972 WBTV logo (the Big \"W\" logo) with the company name on top (in the Warner Communications custom typeface) and the byline \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\" below.\n\nVariant: On the 1979 Bugs Bunny Valentine Special and the 1981 special Bugs Bunny: All-American Hero, the font in the logo is seen in a black color.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show.Availability: Quite rare, it's seen on episodes ofThe Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show and The Sylvester and Tweety, Daffy, and Speedy Show, as well as other Looney Tunes specials during the era, though most specials plaster it with the 6th logo.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(1984-1986)\n\nNicknames: \"Animated WB Shield II\", \"Unprofessionally-Drawn WB Shield\"\n\nLogo: Same as before, except the LT characters stand beside the WBTV logo logo with the company name on top and the Warner Communications byline below. The WBTV logo uses the WB shield logo, without the banner. This is all on a red background.\n\nVariant: In the early days, the name and the byline were in the previous logo's font. In 1984, the font was updated to reflect the new WBTV logo introduced at the time.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Extinct. Once again, it was available on The Bugs Bunny Comedy Hour and on the last few seasons of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show during the era.\n\n5th Logo\n\n(September 13, 1986-March 8, 1992)\n\nNicknames: \"Animated WB Shield III\", \"Unprofessionally-Drawn WB Shield II\"\n\nLogo: Same as before, but with Bugs Bunny (on the left) and Tweety (on the right) on a purple background with the WB logo with a maroon background inside.\n\nVariant: By no later than 1990, the top byline was changed to \"WARNER BROS. ANIMATION INC.\", which takes over the screen.\n\nBylines:\n\nSeptember 13, 1986-1990: \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\"\n\n1990-March 8, 1992: \"A TIME WARNER COMPANY\"\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Extinct, it was only seen on The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show. But it was common in Canada, due to the show frequently airing on Teletoon Retro before it shut down.\n\nEditor's Note: Like all previous logos, it's just boring.\n\n6th Logo\n\n(1990-1992)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/b8d5434f55ad550466a78bf9a64a30bdaaacc0ee\" width=\"267\"></iframe>\n\nNickname: \"WB Shield Wallpaper\"\n\nLogo: Over a royal blue wallpaper of little WB print shields, we see Bugs Bunny in the spotlight, prompted on top of the company name \"WARNER BROS. ANIMATION INC.\" in yellow-green.\n\nFX/SFX: Bugs eating his carrot.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The sound of Bugs munching his carrot, usually played over the closing theme of the show."
