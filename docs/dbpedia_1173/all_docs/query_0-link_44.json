        "text": "I've been going through a database I've had for many years and thought fans of the WB cartoons might like a list of what's on home video, but NOT available on the six Golden Collection DVD sets, nor on the Looney Tunes Super Stars DVDs. (There might be a goof or two along the way, so if there is, I apologize.)\n\nThere are also a number of cartoons relesased as bonuses on various DVDs. Those are not on the list below. Only proper Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies compilations were considered.\n\nOK, here we go:\n\nIn Japan, there were three Tweety & Sylvester DVDs (region 2) released under the \"I Love Tweety\" name. Many of the films were later released on the Golden Collection sets, but these are still unique to these sets (as far as DVDs go):\n\nI Love Tweety Vol. 1\n\nGreedy For Tweety\n\nDog Pounded\n\nCatty Cornered\n\nThe Jet Cage\n\nTweety's Circus\n\nCatty Cornered\n\nMuzzle Tough\n\nA Street Cat Named Sylvester\n\nI Love Tweety Vol. 2.\n\nSandy Claws\n\nTree Cornered Tweety\n\nTweet Zoo\n\nTweet and Lovely\n\nI Love Tweety Vol. 3.\n\nA Pizza Tweety-Pie\n\nA Bird In a Bonnet\n\nHawaiian Aye Aye\n\nRebel Without Claws\n\nOn the LD front, there are a heap of titles still not available on DVD (US or Japanese).\n\nLooney Tunes After Dark\n\nHare-way to the Stars\n\nHasty Hare\n\nHyde and Go Tweet\n\nThe Duxorcist\n\nThe Night of the Living Duck\n\nLooney Tunes Assorted Nuts\n\nFeline Frame-up\n\nA Hound For Trouble\n\nPests for Guests\n\nFrom A to Z-Z-Z-Z\n\nGone Batty\n\nA Sheep in the Deep\n\nStrife With Father\n\nBad Ol' Puddy Tat Blues\n\nA Mouse Divided\n\nPop 'Im Pop!\n\nTree For Two\n\nStooge For a Mouse\n\nCurtain Calls\n\nCurtain Razor\n\nHigh Note\n\nTweety's Circus (on Japanese \"I Love Tweety\" DVD)\n\nNelly's Folly\n\nDuck Victory\n\nCracked Quack\n\nDon't Axe Me\n\nMuscle Tussle\n\nGuffaw & Order\n\nThe Blow Out\n\nBoston Quackie (also on Japanese LD set)\n\nCatty Cornered (on Japanese \"I Love Tweety\" DVD)\n\nBugsy and Mugsy\n\nPorky's Movie Mystery\n\nRiff Raff Daffy\n\nHam On Wry\n\nThumb Fun\n\nDog Collared\n\nThe Pest That Came to Dinner\n\nHare Beyond Compare\n\nBeanstalk Bunny\n\nRobot Rabbit\n\nRabbit Every Monday\n\nHare Lift\n\nKnights Must Fall\n\nIf At First You Don't Succeed (Wile E.

Many of the titles have not been released on DVD, but some did see release cropped for 16:9 fake widescreen in the first two \"Looney Tunes Super Stars\" collections.

These titles have yet to see release on DVD or LD:\n\nVol.1: All Stars\n\nThe Slap-Hoppy Mouse\n\nWild About Hurry\n\nVol. 3: The Vocal Genius (Mel Blanc)\n\nA Fractured Leghorn (on two other VHS tapes as well)\n\nPast Perfumance (on two other VHS tapes as well)\n\nVol. 4: Daffy Doodles (Robert McKimson)\n\nLovelorn Leghorn (also on 1985 VHS release)\n\nVol. 5: Musical Masterpieces\n\nNotes To You\n\nVol. 6: Supporting Players\n\nBosko and Honey\n\nI Gopher You\n\nThe Lion's Busy\n\nTerrier Stricken\n\nVol. 8: Tex-Book Looney (Tex Avery)\n\nThe Haunted Mouse\n\nVol. 10: Canine Corps\n\nBosko and Bruno\n\nBuddy and Towser\n\nSheep Ahoy\n\nVol. 11: Wabbit Tales\n\nCompressed Hare\n\nVol. 12: Porky and Daffy\n\nNaughty Neighbors\n\nPlane Dippy\n\nPorky and Daffy (also on 1992 VHS release)\n\nPorky's Bear Facts\n\nPorky's Cafe\n\nPorky's Prize Pony\n\nVol. 13: Comic Cat-tastrophies\n\nBell Hoppy\n\nCat's Aweigh\n\nReally Scent (also on 1985 VHS release)\n\nTouche and Go\n\nVol. 14: Cartoon Superstars\n\nFastest With The Mostest\n\nHome Tweet Home (also on 1992 VHS release)\n\nLouvre Come Back to Me (also on Looney Tunes Video Show VHS)\n\nOdor Of The Day (also on 1985 VHS release)\n\nVol. 15: A Battle Of Wits\n\nDaffy's Southern Exposure\n\nFox In a Fix\n\nTweet and Sour (also on 1992 VHS release)\n\nA Witch's Tangled Hare (also on 1988 VHS release)\n\nWoolen Under Where\n\nZoom at the Top\n\n(Phew!) As you can see, WB has released loads of cartoons on home video, with DVD only making up part of what's out there.\n\nThe most surprising thing in making this list was seeing that \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" (Daffy's first appearance) has only been released on one VHS tape, more than 26 years ago.\n\nI guess it's also amazing that \"Porky's Hare Hunt\" (first prototype Bugs - or at least a screwy rabbit) has never seen an official release on home video."
