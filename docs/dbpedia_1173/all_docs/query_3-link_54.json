        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nJust in time for Halloween (and beyond), Warner Bros. has released a collection of 25 of its most popular thrillers, sci-fi and horror movies, as part of a new digital bundle celebrating the studio’s 100th anniversary.\n\nAvailable exclusively to download on Apple TV, the Warner Bros. 25-Film Vol 4. Thrillers/Sci-Fi/Horror Bundle is on sale for $29.99 for the complete set. This breaks down to just about $1.20 per movie, or a whopping 85 percent off — or a $170 discount — from the list price. Download the films to your device to watch on your next movie night at home.\n\nThe movies span nearly 90 years of cinema with releases as early as 1933 with the original King Kong to as recent as 2021 with the remake of Dune from director Denis Villeneuve. This bundle also features a mix of 16 4K Ultra HD releases and nine HD releases altogether. Ahead, you’ll find a complete list of all of the movies in the collection and which ones are in 4K and HD.\n\n4K Ultra HD Digital Movies:\n\nHD Digital Movies:\n\nInteresting to note: This bundle is compatible with the Movies Anywhere service — which means once you download them to your Apple ID account, you can watch them on just about any device with the Movies Anywhere app for free. And while Apple TV has a number of deals that are live right now, you don’t need to be an Apple TV+ subscriber to score this movie bundle.\n\nThis is one very impressive collection of movies, and fans of even just one or a few of the titles might find it worth getting the whole set — especially considering the hefty discount and the low price. And let’s be honest, there’s plenty of high-quality movies from directors such as Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, The Wachowskis, Stanley Kubrick, David Fincher, Spike Jonze, William Friedkin, James Wan and others."
