        "text": "Visuals: Same as before, but the design has been cleaned up a bit. The border of the shield, banner, text, and \"WB\" are now gold, and the inside of the shield is now blue. The text on the banner has been shortened to \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" and changed to a serif font. The scripted word \"Presents\", in the same font as the previous logo, usually appears below the shield. Also, the background has been changed to a set of clouds (much like the logos from 1984 on). For its later years, this logo was usually superimposed onto the opening scene of the film.\n\nVariants:\n\nA B&W version of this logo exists, and appears on several films, the first of which was Key Largo.\n\nA sepia-toned variant of this logo can be found on Jack and the Beanstalk and Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nSome films, most notably The Crimson Pirate and The Master of Ballantrae, had this logo on a different cloud background.\n\nA different version was used on 3D films, as well as some 2D films that were originally planned to be made in 3D, such as House of Wax, Hondo, Dial M for Murder, Them!, The High and the Mighty, Rebel Without a Cause, East of Eden, Mister Roberts, The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, and Drum Beat (where this variant is presented in CinemaScope). Here the WB shield appears as a live-action model, the banner is straightened, and a different cloud background (which would be revived as part of the main logo beginning in 1984). This variant was used from 1953 until 1956, and was also used for plastering, such as for reissues of the 1951 film Force of Arms (aka A Girl for Joe).\n\nA variant with the \"Presents\" text absent appeared on Alfred Hitchcock's Under Capricorn, New York Confidential, and the 1961 Canadian film The Mask.\n\nAnother rare version is seen on some Scope Gem travelogues like Alpine Glory. This variant uses a different cloud background, and has the 3D text \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES PRESENTS\", with \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" in a TCF CinemaScope-esque font, zoom towards the screen before stopping.\n\nSome films, most notably Battle of the Bulge and Cool Hand Luke, have this logo on a black background; a French variant of this also exists.\n\nSometimes, the banner reads \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES INC.\" like the previous logo, except the \"INC.\" is very tiny and on the very right of the banner. This version can be seen on films such as The Prince and the Showgirl.\n\nA German version exists where the \"Presents\" text is replaced with \"zeigen\", and a white version of the shield is superimposed over the opening scene of the film. Another German variant, which uses the 3D version, has \"zeigen\" chyroned over the \"Presents\" text.\n\nOn the Japanese release of None but the Brave (1965), the company name is written in Japanese.\n\nClosing Titles:\n\n1st Closing Title: Same as above, seen only with the \"A Warner Bros.-First National Picture\" and \"A First National Picture\" text.\n\n2nd Closing Title: Superimposed on the last scene of the movie or a special background, the words \"The End\" (the font varies depending on the film) fades in, with the WB shield bug between two thick lines below. Sometimes, the following disclaimers were used:\n\n\"Produced and Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc.\"\n\n\"Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc.\"\n\n\"Produced and Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures\"\n\n\"Distributed by Warner Bros.\"\n\nThese texts are seen sandwiched in between the words \"The End\" and the WB shield bug.\n\nTechnique: None.\n\nAudio: The Max Steiner horn fanfare from the previous logo was initially used for this logo, but it was gradually phased out in favor of the movie's opening theme.\n\nAudio Variant: On New York Confidential, the logo has a different fanfare composed by Joseph Mullendore.\n\nAvailability: Seen on prints of many Warner Bros. films on AMC and TCM, and preserved on Warner Archive Collection or Warner Bros. Home Entertainment DVD releases.\n\nIt also precedes the prologue in the 1949 re-release version of G Men.\n\nThis logo made its first full-color appearance in The Rope and made its final appearance in Cool Hand Luke (copyrighted to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, the film was completed by the time the merger had finished).\n\nThe logo was briefly revived for a short time in 1974 starting with Blazing Saddles, and was later used on some films (albeit as a variation) until 1979, when it made its last appearance on Time After Time.\n\nSometimes, this may be preceded by a later logo, as seen on the earliest home video releases of Them! (where the 10th logo preceded this one).\n\nThis also appears on the VCI release of Drum Beat.\n\nLegacy: This is the most well-known version of the Warner Bros. shield, according to the Movie title stills collection Warner Bros. website. This particular design was listed as the 12th best corporate logo by Complex Magazine for its longevity and iconic status.\n\n6th Logo (January 20, 1968-November 12, 1970)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, an abstract \"W\", consisting of two slanted elongated circles and a shorter elongated circle, zooms towards the camera. Around halfway through, the words \"WARNER BROS\" (in a modified version of the Zarana typeface) appear below it as it zooms in. The red \"W\" overtakes the screen as a smaller white \"W\" zooms in. It stops in the middle of the screen, and a rounded black square fades in around the \"W\". The byline \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\", in the same font as \"WARNER BROS\", fades in below. Most of the time, \"PRESENTS\" also fades in below (in Helvetica).\n\nTrivia: The \"Big W\" was designed by Saul Bass, who also designed the Geffen Pictures \"G\" logo. The \"Worms\" nickname is attributed to an audio commentary for the film Gremlins, which brought back the shield logo. The \\\\' logo was seen in several other shapes like a circle and a parallelogram, but these prototypes were scrapped. Although this logo has since been retired by the studio, it is still used by the now-unrelated Warner Music Group (formerly owned by Time Warner).\n\nVariants:\n\nOn All the President's Men, the logo is in black and white and \"PRESENTS\" is absent (this variant is preserved on the DVD release). On old VHS releases (including the 1980 WCI release and the 1991 letterboxed French Canadian Warner release), the color is simply faded.\n\nOn some films (including Oh, God!, The Frisco Kid, The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, Just Tell Me What You Want, Private Benjamin, The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, Firefox, The Man with Two Brains, National Lampoon's Vacation, and Daffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island), \"PRESENTS\" fades in at the same time as the Warner Communications byline.\n\nOn Superman and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, a white \"W\" zooms in on a black background and stops in the middle. The words \"RELEASED BY WARNER BROS\" fade in below. (Superman retained this on early video releases, but it was replaced by the regular version on later releases, and the 1984 version of the shield on later video releases. It was restored on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases. Current prints of the film replace it with the variant seen on Flags of Our Fathers).\n\nOn some other outside productions released by WB (including Superman III), \"RELEASED BY WARNER BROS\" replaces \"WARNER BROS\" at the beginning of the logo (this version was retained on the original video release of Superman III).\n\nSome prints of Superman II and III have this variant, but the text is in a different, bolder version of the font. The \"W\" logo also appears reanimated in this variant, with the \"RELEASED BY WARNER BROS\" disclaimer appearing once the \"W\" fades in.\n\nOn Exorcist II: The Heretic, there is a still image of a black \"W\" inside a red square field, with \"WARNER BROS, A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\" below.\n\nOn Night Moves and Dog Day Afternoon, the word \"PRESENTATION\" appears below the Warner Communications byline, making the phrase \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY PRESENTATION\".\n\nOn the 1984 VHS release of Class of '44, the logo's 2.35:1 aspect ratio is squeezed into 4:3 full screen.\n\nOn trailers for re-releases, the logo has a copyright notice at the bottom, with \"A RE-RELEASE FROM WARNER BROS.\" above. This has been seen on reissue trailers of Superman and Around the World in 80 Days.\n\nThere is a short version that starts with the white \"W\" zooming in. This can be seen on the trailer for McQ.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\nThe closing \"DISTRIBUTED BY WARNER BROS\" logo has the colors switched, with the \"W\" in black and the circle in white. This was seen as late as 1988 on Evil Angels, with an in-credit variation appearing as late as 1990 on The Witches. Sometimes, on redrawn Looney Tunes cartoons, it fades from the end cards.\n\nA B&W version of the closing \"DISTRIBUTED BY WARNER BROS\" logo also exists, which appeared at the end of a January 12, 1993 airing of S01E08 of F Troop on Nick at Nite.\n\nAn early version of this logo had a different font for the text as well. This version appeared at the beginning of some prints of The Shining.\n\nA black-and-white version appeared at the end of TCM's print of Onionhead (1958), followed by the 2003 Warner Bros. Television logo in color.\n\nAn ITV overnight showing of the 1968 film The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in early September 1996 had its original W7 logo at the beginning, but this logo, with \"PRESENTS\", oddly appeared at the end.\n\nSome early WCI Home Video releases have this closing variant sloppily tacked on at the end of some features, and replacing the Warner Bros. distribution logo at the end of early video prints of Mister Roberts (1955) and replacing the National Pictures distribution logo at the end of the WCI print of Executive Action (1972).\n\nTechnique: 2D animation. None for the closing variant.\n\nAudio: Usually silent, but sometimes the film's opening theme plays over it.\n\nAudio Variant: Oddly, on Warner Archive's Blu-ray release of The Drowning Pool, it has the second half of the 1999 fanfare playing due to a plastering error, using the 2001 prints.\n\nAvailability: It premiered on The Train Robbers and made its final regular appearance on Lassiter, subsequently appearing on Finders Keepers and Irreconcilable Differences (as seen on the Vestron Video release and the 2009 Lionsgate DVD, as it uses the same VHS master).\n\nWarner Bros.' editing bug in the '80s and early '90s meant that Warner Communications and Time Warner shield logos were seen over this logo and, ironically enough, that this did some plastering of its own back when it was the current logo, as seen on early WCI/Warner VHS and Betamax releases of The Green Berets (originally had the 6th logo) and The Candidate (originally had the 9th logo).\n\nThis logo has started to resurface again on most newer remasters on most 1973-1984 films.\n\nThough films from The Ladd Company did not use this logo, this precedes that company's logo on the original rental-only VHS and Betamax release of Looker.\n\nLegacy: This logo was noted as being \"drastically simpler\" than the studio's previous logos, mainly due to the absence of the shield, and was even considered to be a touch \"Nazi-like\" by Fast Company magazine. Nonetheless, it's still a favorite of many, including those in the movie industry, including Ben Affleck, Steven Soderbergh, Todd Phillips, and Clay Kaytis, who opted to use it on their respective movies Argo, the Magic Mike movies, Joker, and A Christmas Story Christmas.\n\n11th Logo (April 13, 1984-February 2, 2001)\n\nVisuals: Over a set of clouds (the same set used in the 1953 variant of the 5th logo), the WB shield appears (including the banner reading \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" in a set of boxes), with the byline of the owner at the bottom.\n\nBylines:\n\nJune 8, 1984-September 14, 1990: \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\"\n\nMarch 9, 1990-February 26, 1993: \"A TIME WARNER COMPANY\"\n\nAugust 14, 1992-February 2, 2001: \"A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\"\n\nVariants:\n\nSome films coincidentally modify the shield, with the color inside of the shield being changed to a more greenish tone.\n\nDuring this logo's duration, the sky background came in three colors: pale blue, dark blue and light blue.\n\nFor some earlier films, and for films that had this logo plastered on over older logos, the word \"PRESENTS\" fades in after a couple of seconds, like on WB films that originally used the 9th logo. This logo was also seen in black and white when added to the beginning of some films, such as Onionhead.\n\nScope films used a different, more stylized cloud background, which was also used for this logo's television counterpart during the Warner Communications era. The clouds in this background are more uniformly fluffy in appearance.\n\nA French variant used an animation of the shield and byline (which strangely still uses the Warner Communications text, despite it being replaced by Time Warner by then) glowing on a black background before flashing to the shield and background, with the text \"PROCHAINES SORTIES CINEMA\" (French for \"UPCOMING CINEMA RELEASES\") zooming out and shining. An announcer says \"Et maintenant découvrez en exclusivité les bandes annonces des prochaines sorties Warner Bros disponible d'ici quelques mois chez Warner Home Video\" (roughly translating to \"And now discover exclusive trailers for the next Warner Bros. releases, available in a few months from Warner Home Video\").\n\nOpen-matte and bylineless versions also exist.\n\nA later variant modifies the banner slightly to remove the boxes the text is embedded in.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\n1984-1998: The closing logo, seen at the end of most movies, features a simple superimposed WB shield (without a banner), much akin to the logo Warner briefly used before the introduction of the \"Big W\" logo in 1972. The phrase \"DISTRIBUTED BY WARNER BROS.\" appears above the shield with the owner byline at the bottom. Beginning with The Perfect Storm on June 30, 2000, the above text is changed to \"DISTRIBUTED BY WARNER BROS. PICTURES\", and a URL is added below the byline.\n\nA German variant exists where the text reads \"Im Verleih der WARNER BROS. FILM GMBH\", which translates to \"A Film of Warner Bros. GmBH\". The shield is also redrawn.\n\nFilms released from 1984 to roughly 1989, would use the \"Big W\" logo after their credits.\n\nA few movies would use a variant where the \"Big W\" logo is bigger than normal.\n\nOn films released from 1986 to 1990, the credit logo used the previous logo font with a WB shield.\n\nOn some films, like Goodfellas and Something to Talk About, the shield uses its 1953 alternate design.\n\nA variation of the credit logo can be seen at the end of The Bonfire of the Vanities and Curly Sue with the WB shield and below that \"Distributed by Warner Bros., A Time Warner Company\".\n\nDecember 8, 1988-March 22, 2000: Another ending variation features the movie logo, but with the words \"DISTRIBUTED BY WARNER BROS.\" above the shield. This was also used at the beginning of Freejack.\n\nA 16:9 stretched to 4:3 variant also exists.\n\nMay 12, 2000-February 2, 2001: Only the words \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" appear above the shield, and the text on the banner is redone. Some films like The In Crowd, Get Carter and Miss Congeniality have the banner simply reading \"WARNER BROS.\". A URL is also added below the byline. There is also a print closing logo, which was seen on Invictus.\n\nTechnique: None, except for fading effects on the \"PRESENTS\" text on the original Warner Communications variation.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme or audio of the film.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the Warner Archive DVD-R release of How Sweet It Is!, the logo is accompanied by the National General fanfare (the original distributors of the film) as the result of a plastering error.\n\nOn a Kabel 1 airing of It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987), the logo is accompanied by the 1985 Warner Home Video rendition of the Max Steiner fanfare due to another shoddy plastering job. Surprisingly, this logo fits better with that fanfare.\n\nAvailability: The 1992 version is usually the one that plasters older logos. Fortunately, WB has eased up on this somewhat, and older logos have been seen more often in recent years on newer prints/masters.\n\nThis logo made its first appearance on the aforementioned Gremlins (released on June 8, 1984) and made its final regular appearance on True Crime (released on March 19, 1999). The closing version made its final appearance on Valentine (released on February 2, 2001).\n\nThis logo does not appear on Space Jam, as NBA sold the rights distribution to Time Warner, but only the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo appears at the beginning instead. However, the trailer and scenes do feature this logo.\n\nThe Warner Communications byline version can be found on the 1997 DVD and the 2022 4K UHD Blu-ray releases of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) (the 2003 DVD release has the 1998 logo with the AOL Time Warner byline), current DVD and Blu-ray prints of The Dead Pool, TCM prints of The Goodbye Girl, and the Blu-ray release of Full Metal Jacket (1987).\n\nHowever, it's not as easy to spot as the 1992 variant, as many DVD releases and Encore/Starz prints replace it with the Time Warner Entertainment byline variant, such as on the DVD release of Pee-wee's Big Adventure or even with the next logo below (occurs on the Police Academy films and Moving).\n\nEven the 1990 Time Warner byline variant has been plastered with the next logo on most of Encore's prints of films released from 1990 to 1992, but it is intact on the Blu-ray of Goodfellas, the 1999 DVD and 2017 Warner Archive Blu-ray releases of My Blue Heaven, and the 2000 Director's Cut DVD release of Lethal Weapon 3.\n\nOne instance where this logo does some plastering of its own was on The Ballad of Cable Hogue, where it plastered the Kinney Shield.\n\nThe 1984 Warner Communications \"Distributed by\" variant can also be found at the end of the 1999 DVD release of The American President (1995) of all places, likely due to a printing error when editing out the Columbia Pictures in-credit closing logo.\n\nThe 1984 Warner Communications opening variant also strangely plasters the New Line Cinema logo on the 2018 Criterion Collection DVD releases of Female Trouble (1974) and Polyester (1981).\n\nIt also makes an even stranger appearance on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of Catalina Caper, a Crown International film (it appears to have been sourced from a television print from around 1987); it appears as Joel and the Bots are entering the theater.\n\nIt also appears at the start of Blazing Saddles (1974) on the 1996 UK VHS re-release of the same name from Warner Home Video.\n\nLegacy: This is considered by many to be a throwback to the 1948 shield. However, the 1992 variant is disliked by many people for its large-scale plastering, giving it the nickname \"Shield of Staleness\" or \"The Shield of Annoyance\".\n\n12th Logo (January 16, 1998-December 22, 2023)\n\nVisuals: A picture of the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank is seen with a gold tint, and ripples slowly (a la the DreamWorks Pictures logo) before rotating to reveal itself as the WB shield over the quintessential cloud background, both of which are now redone in CGI. The shield continues to rotate as it zooms out to its usual position, with the company byline fading in underneath.\n\nTrivia: If one pauses right before the transition from the backlot image to the shield animation, some posters can be seen on the studio wall, including those for Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Friends, and Space Jam, dating the photograph to somewhere between mid-1996 and early 1997.\n\nBylines:\n\nJanuary 16, 1998-February 2, 2001: \"A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\" (in the Garamond font in the normal variant, but in the Bodoni Condensed font in the 75 Years variant)\n\nOn some scope films starting in 1999, the byline is noticeably larger.\n\nFebruary 16, 2001-September 12, 2003: \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" (also in Garamond)\n\nOn some scope films such as Training Day, the byline is noticeably larger.\n\nOn the 2003 DVD release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the byline gets cropped out, using its 16:9 version, meaning that it's bylineless, like the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo. This only applies for widescreen copies.\n\nNovember 5-December 5, 2003: \"A Time Warner Company\" (in Adobe Garamond Pro)\n\nDecember 12, 2003-August 24, 2018: \"A TimeWarner Company\" (with \"TimeWarner\" in its own custom font, called Bodoni BE Regular, while the rest of the byline is in FF Meta)\n\nOn the Warner Animation Group films Storks and The LEGO Batman Movie, the byline (excluding \"TimeWarner\") is in the Proxima Nova font and is smaller.\n\nJuly 22, 2018-March 18, 2022: \"A WARNERMEDIA Company\", with \"WARNERMEDIA\" in its own logo font, called AT&T Aleck Sans Bold, while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font. The shadow behind \"MEDIA\" is also absent.\n\nOctober 29, 2019-March 31, 2021: \"a WarnerMedia company\", with \"WarnerMedia\" in its own logo font, called AT&T Aleck Sans (modified), while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font. It was seen on Godzilla vs. Kong (albeit using a custom variant) and strangely, it uses the 14th logo at the end. It was also spotted in the first trailer for Tom & Jerry (2021) and at the Warner Bros. segment in HBO Max's unveiling at the 2019 WarnerMedia Day, which was shown on the stage monitor behind the Chair & Chief Executive Officer of Warner Bros., Ann Sarnoff, alongside the Warner Bros. Television Group logo on both sides of the stage.\n\nDecember 22, 2023: \"A WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY COMPANY\", with \"WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY\" in its own logo font, called Geograph Medium, which is created by Klim Type Foundry and has been designed exclusively for National Geographic, while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font. It was seen on Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (albeit using a custom variant). It was also spotted in the trailer for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\n\nOn the 2003 DVD of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the AOL byline gets cropped out, meaning that it's bylineless, like the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo. This only applies for widescreen copies.\n\nVariants:\n\nJanuary 16-December 18, 1998: For the logo's debut and its first official year (1998), \"75\" and \"YEARS\" slide out from behind the shield as it zooms out. \"Entertaining The World\" fades in underneath, followed by the Time Warner Entertainment byline in white instead of orange. Also, the shield and the background are slightly enhanced. Sometimes, the banner may just read \"WARNER BROS.\" instead of \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\".\n\nThere is a flat/open-matte and scope version of the logo. The flat and 1.37:1 \"academy\" versions vertically stretches the tinted picture of the Warner Bros. studio, while the cloud background is normal. The scope and open matte versions have the tinted photo as normal and the cloud background horizontally stretches as the shield zooms out further.\n\nOn the 75 Years montage intro, a version exists where a copyright stamp \"©Warner Bros. 1998\" (uppercased in the Warner Bros. banner with a space between the copyright stamp \"© WARNER BROS., 1998\" and the company name) fades in with the Time Warner Entertainment byline (a la the 1997 Universal Pictures logo). This appears in both 4:3 and scope.\n\nA French VHS promo has the \"WARNER BROS.\"-shield variant zooming out to its place, but it freeze-frames, and the text \"75 ANS A VOUS FAIRE RÈVER\" fades in.\n\nThere is a 35mm promo version, where it has a randomized vignette on the logo.\n\nA short version of the \"WARNER BROS.\" variant exists on a different promo from the company.\n\nFebruary 5, 1999-2011: The logo is reanimated to remove the 75th Anniversary wordings. Also, the byline is now in orange. This version would stay the same until it was reanimated once again in 2011 (not counting the changes in bylines and color grading).\n\nThe flat and scope versions are almost identical. The reflection of the studio from the banner is the same in the scope version while it is rendered differently in the flat/open-matte version.\n\nA somewhat enhanced WB shield can be seen on NASCAR 3D: The IMAX Experience, Clash of the Titans, Hubble 3D, Born to Be Wild 3D, and 3D international releases of Beowulf. The animation revealing the shield is quicker, the flash reflection on the banner when the shield is revealed is not as bright, the inside of the shield is a brighter blue, the banner around the shield is shinier, the cloud background is further back, and the shield zooms out further more.\n\nA version of the logo exists in which Bugs Bunny walks from the shield, does a Vanna pose, and eats a carrot. This version was used for Warner Bros. Family Entertainment for a short time in 2005.\n\nStarting with Dolphin Tale in 2011, the shield is sleeker, the banner is shinier, the byline is orange-yellow, and the animation revealing the shield is enhanced. Some films like The Dark Knight Rises, Gangster Squad and most foreign films released by the company at the time used the 2003 version, with the last film overall using that version being the Chinese film Zhongkui: Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal, released in 2015. The shield rotating was reanimated as the rippling animation is zoomed in. In the scope version, it's zoomed in even more.\n\nOn a TV airing of Miss Congeniality, the byline underneath the 2001 version of the logo is blurred and reads \"A TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY\" in the Arial font. It is unknown whether or not this variant was remade by technicians.\n\nOn FX, FXX and FXM airings of The Negotiator, the 2003 version of the logo with the Time Warner byline is still.\n\nA promotional tape has the shield replaced with a shinier 2D shield with \"WARNER BROS. STUDIOS\" instead of \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" on the banner.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\n1998-February 2, 2001, May 17, 2002, March 5, 2004: Same as the previous logo.\n\nFebruary 16, 2001-November 26, 2020: This closing logo features the 1984 shield with the banner inscription updated to match that of the current opening logo; the words \"Distributed by\" (in the font depending on the version of the closing variant) appear over the shield with the \"www.warnerbros.com\" URL address underneath the byline (also depending on the version). This is pretty much a modified version of the 2001 Warner Bros. Television logo.\n\nFebruary 16, 2001-December 5, 2003 (AOL Time Warner and prototype Time Warner bylines): The text \"Distributed by\" is in Garamond, like its television counterpart, while the \"www.warnerbros.com\" URL address is in bold below the byline reading either \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" or \"A Time Warner Company\".\n\nDecember 12, 2003-August 24, 2018 (official Time Warner byline): When the byline was changed to \"A TimeWarner Company\", the \"Distributed by\" was updated to the custom Didot/Bodoni hybrid font with the URL in FF Meta. Also, starting with this version, the sky background is different, however some films such as TMNT, IT, The LEGO Batman Movie, The LEGO Ninjago Movie and Ready Player One used the old sky background instead.\n\nJuly 22, 2018-November 26, 2020 (WarnerMedia byline): Once again, the text above and below the logo and the byline was changed in favor of the byline change to \"A WARNERMEDIA Company\". Here, both \"Distributed by\" and the \"www.warnerbros.com\" URL are now in AT&T Aleck Sans typeface. Like the opening variant, the shadow behind \"MEDIA\" is not there.\n\nOn The LEGO Batman Movie and The LEGO Ninjago Movie, it cuts in and cuts out instead of fading in and out.\n\nThere's an alternate scope version with the shield being further zoomed out, much like the IMAX variant. This was spotted on We Are Marshall.\n\nA variant based on the opening logo appears in the 2016 German film Vier giegen der Bank.\n\nOn Studio illegale, the last few seconds of the opening logo is used instead.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Intralink Film Graphic Design for the original 1998 and 1999 versions, and Picturemill for the 2011 version.\n\nAudio:\n\nJanuary 16-December 18, 1998: A wind-blowing chime theme that samples the first seconds of the Non-Stop Music library track \"Journey to Chung King\", composed by Holly Anderson, followed by a sampled sound from the E-MU Emulator III.\n\nFebruary 12, 1999-November 26, 2020: An 8-note piano tune that builds into a powerful, moving fanfare, based on the theme from Casablanca, \"As Time Goes By\" (originally used in the Broadway musical Everybody's Welcome). It is a shortened version of an instrumental of \"As Time Goes By\" that appeared in a Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary promo that had been shown theatrically a year earlier. The fanfare made its debut in Message in a Bottle. The fanfare uses \"Crescendo Finale\" from Peter Siedlaczek's Orchestral Colors, and maybe an unknown cymbal sample (probably SampleCell II or Big Fish Audio Prosonus).\n\nOn movies released during the AOL Time Warner Company byline's usage, the harp is quieter.\n\nWhen the Time Warner byline was introduced in November 2003, the harp was removed.\n\nIn other cases, it uses the opening theme of the movie or silence.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nA low tone version of the \"As Time Goes By\" theme was heard on an AMC print of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nThe 16mm/35mm montage intro for the 75th anniversary of Warner Bros. uses an extended version of the \"As Time Goes By\" theme on the 75th Anniversary logo. The voiceover (voiced by Chuck Riley) thanks audiences around the world for celebrating 75 years.\n\nOn Hearts of Atlantis, as well as current prints of Stealing Home and Cookie, the fanfare is high pitched as it was in a PAL print.\n\nThe intro video of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood has \"As Time Goes By\" from Casablanca (archival audio) transitioning into the 1998 fanfare, as soon as Jack (played by Dooley Wilson) sings the phrase \"The fundamental things apply...\".\n\nOn Australian prints of the French film Love, Sex & Therapy (2014), the fanfare is a lot more reverbed than usual, with the piano (with the exception of the opening part) being almost inaudible.\n\nThe Japanese live action movie, Gintama 2, had the last spoken dialogue echoing at the start of the fanfare, in which the logo was shown two times as a running gag during the start of the movie, as shown below.\n\nOn a sizzle reel dating from the 2000s, the cymbal hits are removed, and the ending flourish also sounds a bit different.\n\nOn Studio illegale, one of the stereo audio tracks for the fanfare are missing, making the fanfare sound less powerful.\n\nAvailability: It first debuted on Fallen and appeared on most of the company's films from this era until it was officially retired in 2020, with the final film to use this logo being Superintelligence.\n\nThe 75th Anniversary variant first appeared on Fallen and last appeared on You've Got Mail.\n\nHowever, probably due to the 75th Anniversary wordings, it is almost always plastered with the 2003 version on newer prints of such films, although some releases may retain it.\n\nPre-Disney prints of The Negotiator have made this logo next to the Regency logo.\n\nIt is also removed on Star prints of The Negotiator, as it just cuts to the Regency logo instead.\n\nThe 1999-2000 version was also spotted plastering older logos on some 1999-2001 prints of older films, such as the May 2001 DVD of Superman II (where it plasters the 1972 logo).\n\nThe AOL Time Warner byline debuted on Sweet November and last appeared on Matchstick Men.\n\nIt also plasters previous logos on some 2001-2003 prints of older films.\n\nThe prototype Time Warner byline was rare and first appeared on The Matrix Revolutions (as a variant). It last appeared on The Last Samurai.\n\nHowever, it makes a surprise appearance on The Polar Express (2004, albeit using a custom variant), and the trailer for Gravity (2013), with the 1999 version. It is the only 2004 film release to have the prototype Time Warner byline, as all other 2004 film releases use the later/official TimeWarner byline onwards.\n\nThe official TimeWarner byline debuted on Something's Gotta Give (TV spots and trailers for the film use the Prototype Time Warner byline instead), and made its last appearance at the end of the IMAX re-release of 2001: A Space Odyssey and on Bleach, released on July 20, 2018 in Japan.\n\nJust like the AOL Time Warner version, this byline plasters previous logos on post-2003 prints of pre-2003 films (in addition, also plastering the 75th Anniversary, Time Warner Entertainment, and AOL Time Warner versions of the same logo).\n\nSeveral classic films, including the first two Lethal Weapon films (current prints of Lethal Weapon 3 still retain the 1990 logo), Superman II, III and IV: The Quest for Peace, The Exorcist, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (though the \"Big W\" has been retained on the original 1997 DVD release), The Lost Boys, Blazing Saddles, All the President's Men, Falling Down, Return of the Living Dead Part II, recent HBO Family airings of Casablanca (plastering the black-and-white 4th logo), and current prints of the National Lampoon's Vacation series (with the exception of European Vacation) have had their old logos plastered with this one in lieu of the \"Shield of Staleness\", though this one is mainly found on the most recent releases. The 2018 version with the WarnerMedia byline also plasters the previous logo on current prints of Steel (1997).\n\nThe WarnerMedia byline version made its first official appearance on Teen Titans Go! To the Movies.\n\nThis logo may or may not be plastered, or preceded by the Toho logo on Japanese prints of Legendary Pictures features distributed by Toho in Japan; it is known to have at least appeared on Japanese prints of Godzilla vs. Kong.\n\nThe Japanese anime movie, Gintama: The Movie (subtitled A New Retelling Benizakura Arc in Japan), had the logo shown 3 times, while the Japanese live action movie, Gintama 2, had the logo shown 2 times, all as a running gag during the start of the movie.\n\nThe AOL Time Warner byline variant also makes surprise appearances at the end of Amazon Prime Video's print of Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie and a TCM France airing of Ransom.\n\nThis logo also appears at the beginning of pre-Disney prints to the feature-length movie, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, before the Lucasfilm logo.\n\nHowever, Disney+ prints of the film remove this logo, due to Disney's ownership of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThis logo also appeared on the international theatrical prints for Man on the Moon and Wonder Boys (both produced by Mutual Film Company), although the logo does not appear on the home video releases.\n\nStrangely, this also appeared on season 3, episode 10 of Suddenly Susan on The Roku Channel. The chimes from the 1998 Warner Bros. Television logo were also audibly heard before the logo even appears.\n\nSurprisingly, the 2011 enhanced Time Warner version is retained on current prints of Clifford's Really Big Movie where it is preceded by the 2013 Universal Pictures logo.\n\nThis was used in tandem with the next logo until November 26, 2020.\n\nThis may or may not appear on Italian prints of Sony Pictures Releasing-distributed films.\n\nHowever, this notably appears on Italian prints of Call Me by Your Name (2017), preceding the Sony Pictures Classics logo.\n\nDespite the logo ending usage in late 2020, this logo also made surprise reappearance on the British film The Nan Movie, released on March 18, 2022.\n\nThe closing variant of the 2003 Warner Bros. Pictures logo also recently appeared at the end of a December 23, 2022 affiliate KNBC airing of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966), plastering the 1960 MGM Television logo.\n\nThe closing variant of the 2003 Warner Bros. Pictures logo also appeared at the end of the December 24, 2018 and December 31, 2022 UK airings of Escape to Victory (1981) on ITV4 and Channel 5, respectively.\n\nThe closing variant of the 2003 Warner Bros. Pictures logo also appears at the end of the Warner Archive Collection 2017 Blu-ray release of Doc Hollywood (1991).\n\nThe closing variant of the 2003 Warner Bros. Pictures logo also appears at the end of the Blu-ray release of Caddyshack (1980).\n\nLegacy: A favorite of many in the logo community thanks to its beautiful CGI and music.\n\n13th Logo (August 26, 2020-June 29, 2021)\n\nVisuals: It starts off similarly to the last two logos, but this time, instead of a simple rippling image, the camera pans across a photorealistic CGI rendering of the Warner Bros. Studios backlot (which has the numbers on the sound stages and a red carpet outside the Steven J. Ross Theater), with the camera then moving to the left past the iconic water tower (displaying the \"dimensional\" version of the 2019 WB shield and \"WARNER BROS. STUDIOS\" in three rows on it, in the new corporate font, Warner Bros. Sans, based on the shield's lettering, with \"WARNER BROS.\" in its condensed bold version and \"STUDIOS\" in its heavy version) as it takes center stage, similar to the Searchlight Pictures logo. After a few seconds, it continues the same way the previous two logos did, with the same 2019 WB shield from the previous logo (now brighter and more realistic) rotating as it zooms out like the 12th logo (with the letters and shield outline starting off in gold when it zooms out, a homage to its previous gold color, before subtly changing to the new platinum silver), revealing a more realistic, detailed cloud background. The byline then fades in below as the shield shines.\n\nTrivia:\n\nIn the 2021 film Space Jam: A New Legacy, the still version of the logo without the WarnerMedia byline is shown on a boardroom monitor at the end of the Warner 3000 pitch, with a different shield animation at the end, transitioning into the same logo as shown above. The same studio lot shown in the logo was also shown during the scene leading into the Warner Bros. Serververse. The cloud background in the logo (with the WB shield covered up by windows) was used as the desktop background in a Dell monitor on the Warner Bros. executive's (played by Sarah Silverman) computer. Furthermore, the entire studio lot made another appearance in A Hollywood Christmas.\n\nThe logo depicts the sun rising over the Cahuenga Pass to the south. In real life, the sun rises in the east, over the Forest Lawn Cemetery and the Walt Disney Studios.\n\nBylines:\n\nJanuary 14, 2021-August 11, 2022: \"a WarnerMedia company\", with \"WarnerMedia\" in its own logo font, called AT&T Aleck Sans (modified), while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font.\n\nJune 16, 2022: \"a Warner Bros. Discovery company\", with \"Warner Bros. Discovery\" in its own logo font, called AT&T Aleck Sans, just like the WarnerMedia byline, while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font as a placeholder, just like CNN's usage of the WBD byline at the end of programs from CNN International, like CNN Newsroom (International) and The Global Brief, except for the company's name, in which has the Geograph Medium font and is uppercased, making it a mix between the placeholder and the official WBD bylines.\n\nJune 24, 2022-September 8, 2023: \"A WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY COMPANY\", with \"WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY\" in its own logo font, called Geograph Medium, which is created by Klim Type Foundry and has been designed exclusively for National Geographic, while the rest of the byline is in the standard variation of the same font.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the sun appears first, and then its glow and the rest of the footage of the studio lot fades in.\n\nOn films shot in scope (2.39:1), the shield and byline are smaller.\n\nSome films, notably Holiday Harmony and a Thai trailer for Suzume (in which the company handled distribution there), have the 16:9 variant cropped to 2.39:1 aspect ratio.\n\nA version exists where the logo doesn't fade in or fade out. This version may or may not have music. This can be seen on Devastudios' website, Michael Daniels' website, Dune (2021; albeit using a variant with a fade out), Sexo, Pudor y Lágrimas 2 (Sex, Shame and Tears 2), and the end of the 4K Blu-ray release of both the theatrical version and the director's cut version of The Outsiders: The Complete Novel.\n\nA \"behind-the-scenes\" version of this logo exists, showcasing the different production stages of the backlot, water tower, clouds, and the WB shield.\n\nSometimes on the closing variant, the logo is entirely still. This can be seen at the end of YouTube prints of Thir13en Ghosts, plastering the 12th logo.\n\nThe intro video of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood follows the same transitions for both the normal and New Line Cinema versions from the 12th logo. In the New Line Cinema version, it is slowed down to give time to transition to an archival scene from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as soon as the byline disappears and the lens flare appears. The minor difference is that it was in a 16:9 (1.78:1) ratio instead of the usual 21:9 (2.35:1) ratio from the previous logo.\n\nClosing Variant: The tail end of the opening logo with no extra text. Here, the logo stays on-screen for at least 4 extra seconds before fading out. This is the first time that the \"Distributed by\" text above is not used, and the first time since 2000 that the URL below is absent.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Devastudios (who previously animated the logos for Lionsgate Films and Paramount Pictures). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the backlot was created using drone footage, original blueprints from the Warner Bros. Studio Facilities and available photography and videography from Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood and Google Earth, all in order to reconstruct it in CGI. The sky and clouds were created with Terragen from Planetside Software. You can read more about how this logo was made here.\n\nAudio: A re-orchestrated version of the 12th logo's theme, now in a different key (this time in E♭ major). It has a more powerful, orchestral buildup, and the opening notes are now played on a guitar and flute as opposed to a piano. This was composed by Ludwig Göransson. It is unknown what samples are used (probably Spitfire Audio or Cinesamples).\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSome films, most notably the first few to use this logo, have either the opening theme of the movie or silence.\n\nAn upload of the logo on Billy Mallery's Vimeo page has an alternate fanfare which is based on the \"As Time Goes By\" theme, composed by Mallery himself. It wasn't used on any films as this was a \"runner up\" score. It is unknown if other runner up versions from other composers exist.\n\nOn the intro video for Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood, the 1998 arrangement of the fanfare is used, transitioning from \"As Time Goes By\" from Casablanca (archival audio), as soon as Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) sings the phrase \"The fundamental things apply...\".\n\nAvailability: This was used in tandem with the previous logo until June 29, 2021.\n\nIt first debuted on the HBO Max original movie Locked Down, the 12th logo appears on the UK trailer for said film instead.\n\nThe logo with the fanfare debuted on Non Mi Uccidere and Rurouni Kenshin: Final Act - Part 1: The Final, released on April 21 and 23, 2021 in Italy and Japan, respectively; and later made its North American debut on King Richard, released on November 19, 2021.\n\nThis also appeared at the end of Judas and the Black Messiah, despite using the previous logo at the beginning of the film, and also at the end of Godzilla vs. Kong, despite the 12th logo (albeit using a custom variant) appearing at the beginning of the film.\n\nThis logo is also beginning to plaster said logo as seen on the 2021 director's cut of Justice League (titled Zack Snyder's Justice League; both the regular and B&W (Justice is Grey) versions) on HBO Max and the end of YouTube prints of Thir13en Ghosts, originally released in 2001.\n\nIt also appeared at the end of the 4K Blu-ray release of the director's cut of The Outsiders: The Complete Novel.\n\nThe WarnerMedia byline's final appearance was on Tang and Me, released in Japan on August 11, 2022. However, it later made a surprise appearance on the television series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.\n\nThe Geograph Medium Warner Bros. Discovery byline made its official debut on Elvis, released on June 24, 2022 (albeit using a custom variant, while the standard variant first appeared at the end of the film), and later on the trailers of the Japanese films Karada Sagashi and Kin no Kuni Mizu no Kuni. The full version made its debut on the UK release of The Lost King, and later appeared on the U.S. on A Christmas Mystery on HBO Max.\n\nThe prototype Warner Bros. Discovery byline only appeared on the HBO Max original movie Father of the Bride as a placeholder.\n\nWith the water tower having been repainted to have the Warner Bros. Discovery shield on it in 2022, it is currently unknown if or when the logo may get altered, reanimated or replaced to reflect this, as Warner Bros. may keep the logo for the foreseeable future. However, the WBD shield was be used for the studio's 100th anniversary logo that is placed on the left of \"1\" in \"100\", which was revealed on December 14, 2022, instead of the placeholder logo, which featured the 2019 WB shield in the silhouette version of the studio's water tower on the first \"0\" in \"100\", previously revealed on March 23 of that year. It started appearing as a secondary on-screen logo, starting with The Flash, albeit using a variant.\n\nAs the company formed a multi-year deal with MGM to distribute their films in some international territories, including on home video, this logo has started to appear with the MGM logo on the international trailer for Bones & All, and on international prints of the film itself.\n\nOn theatrical prints of Warner Bros. films since 2021 in Australia, Mexico and Hong Kong, it is preceded by the 2012 Universal Pictures logo, and was notably found in theatrical prints of films like Dune, The Matrix Resurrections, The Batman, Air (distributed by Amazon Studios domestically) and Barbie in these aforementioned territories.\n\nOn the other way around, this precedes the Universal logo on Indian theatrical prints of Universal films starting with Knock at the Cabin. Philippine and Brazilian theatrical prints of Universal films, despite handling local distribution by Warner, only show their own logo.\n\nThis appears on many of the Singapore-based distributor, Encore Films releases in Southeast Asia before the latter company's logo. Notable appearances of this logo are on the Philippine and Thai theatrical release prints of Suzume, with both the opening and closing logos, the Philippine theatrical print of The Wandering Earth II, preceding the China Film Administration logo and on Singaporean and Malaysian release prints of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (released by Lionsgate domestically).\n\nIt is also seen on Singaporean and Hong Kong theatrical prints of Expend4bles.\n\nThis also appears on British theatrical prints of Hypnotic, preceding the Solstice Studios logo.\n\nThis also appears at the end of The Nun II and the trailer of said film, but it doesn't appear at the beginning of the film, instead opening with just the 1994-2010 New Line Cinema logo (albeit as a custom variant).\n\nLegacy: Considered to be an exceptionally beautiful and much more fulfilling effort from Warner Bros, this time around, with more realistic effects, stunning CGI and a fresh take on the fanfare.\n\n15th Logo (December 8, 2023-)"
