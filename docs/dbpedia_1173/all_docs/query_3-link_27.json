        "text": "Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. is a fully integrated, broad-based entertainment company and a global leader in the creation, production, distribution, licensing and marketing of all forms of entertainment and their related businesses. A WarnerMedia company, the Studio is home to one of the most successful collections of brands in the world and stands at the forefront of every aspect of the entertainment industry, from feature film, television and home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to DVD and Blu-ray, digital distribution, animation, comic books, videogames, product and brand licensing, and broadcasting. The company’s vast library, one of the most prestigious and valuable in the world, consists of more than 100,000 hours of programming, including 8,600 feature films and 5,000 television seasons comprised of tens of thousands of individual episodes. Warner Bros.’ employee population ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 on any given day in North America (depending on the level of television and movie production) and some 2,000 employees overseas.\n\nIn 2019, Warner Bros.

It also monetizes its distribution and marketing operations by distributing films that are totally financed and produced by third parties. In 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures Group will continue to produce the industry’s broadest slate, featuring the Studio’s DC Super Heroes, New Line Cinema’s horror titles, thoughtful dramas and smart comedies.

Pictures is also a global leader in the marketing and distribution of feature films, operating offices in more than 30 countries and releasing films in over 120 international territories, either directly to theaters or in conjunction with partner companies and co-ventures.\n\nNew Line Cinema, part of Warner Bros. Entertainment since 2008, coordinates its development, production, marketing, distribution and business affairs activities with Warner Bros. Pictures to maximize film performance and operating efficiencies. New Line’s 2020 release slate, distributed by Warner Bros., includes “Malignant,” “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” and “The Many Saints of Newark.”\n\nThe Warner Bros.
