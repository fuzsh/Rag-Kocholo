        "text": "Last night I went to the local rep cinema to catch Stanley Kubrick's 1971\n\nfilm \"Clockwork Orange\", which film buffs will know has been out of\n\ncirculation for many years due to a rights dispute and was recently\n\nre-released. I think it must be at least 25 years since I last saw it. I\n\nwon't go into an OT commentary on the film, but there is one brief shot\n\nwhich might be of interest to fans of the late John Fahey: About 25(?)\n\nminutes into the film there is a scene in which Alex, the central character\n\n(played wonderfully by Malcolm McDowell) and supreme Beethoven admirer,\n\nstrolls through a 70's-futuristic shopping mall and stops at a small record\n\nshop. Several LP covers are visibly on display, of which I recognized three\n\n(it was a lousy print, but even so they would be even harder to spot on a\n\nvideo I think): Walter/Wendy Carlo's album of Moog music from \"2001: A Space\n\nOdyssey\" (A little Kubrickian logrolling there); an album by the now-obscure\n\nKeef Hartley Band; and, amazingly, a copy of John Fahey's \"The\n\nTransfiguration of Blind Joe Death\"! The lettering was not legible-- at\n\nleast in this faded print-- but the cover design was unmistakble.\n\nSo there you have it. Was Kubrick a Fahey fan, or was it some unknown\n\nset-dresser? Was this mere coincidence, or was someone paying a little\n\ntribute? When you consider all the thousands of LPs that *could* have been\n\non display, and what a control freak Kubrick apparently was, it's tempting\n\nto conclude the latter. I wonder if Fahey knew about this (and did he care)?\n\nI wonder if his music might ever have been considered for use in a Kubrick\n\nfilm? I suppose we'll never know...\n\nthe central character\n\n> (played wonderfully by Malcolm McDowell) and supreme Beethoven admirer,\n\n> strolls through a 70's-futuristic shopping mall and stops at a small record\n\n> shop.\n\nThe Chelsea Drugstore.\n\nSeveral LP covers are visibly on display, of which I recognized three\n\n> (it was a lousy print, but even so they would be even harder to spot on a\n\n> video I think): Walter/Wendy Carlo's album of Moog music from \"2001: A Space\n\n> Odyssey\"\n\nWalter Carlos did NOT compose the 2001 soundtrack.\n\n> So there you have it.

Silly me. Thanks so much\n\nfor seting me straight about who really wrote the \"Blue Danube\".\n\nI was referring to an album of Moog arrangements of music from 2001 which\n\nwas around in the late 60s. Hell, maybe it wasn't Carlos; I haven't seen a\n\ncopy in 30 years, but there it is in the film. Give me credit for having\n\nhalf a brain, will you? Like, duh.\n\n\"BubbaBob\" <rnorton@_removethis_spinn.net> wrote in message\n\nnews:Xns918DEFA8728...@209.249.90.101...\n\n> thra...@yahoo.com (Thrawn) wrote:\n\n>\n\n> > I asked Kubrick's daughter about it, you can find it on my site.\n\n> >\n\n> > Viddy Well!\n\n> > Alex Thrawn\n\n> > www.maloclmmcdowell.net\n\n> >\n\n>\n\n> I sure can't find it there.

I wondered\n\nif that was how the place actually looked and asked Stanley Kubrick's\n\ndaughter Katharina who had a walk on part in that scene.\n\nK: \"As I recall, The Chelsea drugstore looked pretty much like that. The\n\nobvious placement of the 2001 album was \"set dressing\" and I'm\n\nsure that Dad had things moved around the place to suit his needs. Overall\n\nthough it had exactly that feel to it. It was a totally cool place as\n\nfar as my 16 year old self was\n\nconcerned.\"\n\nAll the best,\n\nSteve Comeau\n\nremove the anti-spam word \"not\" to reply\n\n\"BubbaBob\" <rnorton@_removethis_spinn.net> wrote in message\n\nnews:Xns918DA0532EC...@209.249.90.101...\n\n> \"Alan Crozier\" <alan.c...@telia.com> wrote:\n\n>\n\n> > \"BubbaBob\" <rnorton@_removethis_spinn.net> wrote in message\n\n> > news:Xns918DEFA8728...@209.249.90.101...\n\n> >> thra...@yahoo.com (Thrawn) wrote:\n\n> >>\n\n> >> > I asked Kubrick's daughter about it, you can find it on my site.\n\n> >> >\n\n> >> > Viddy Well!\n\n> >> > Alex Thrawn\n\n> >> > www.maloclmmcdowell.net\n\n> >> >\n\n> >>\n\n> >> I sure can't find it there.
