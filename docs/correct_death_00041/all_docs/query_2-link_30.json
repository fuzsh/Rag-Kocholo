        "text": "“Leon was a special and lovely man driven by his curiosity, who spread love and warmth wherever he went,” his children said in a statement provided by his daughter, Masha Vitali. “He will be remembered with love and be hugely missed by the many people he touched.”\n\nVitali was profiled in the 2017 documentary Filmworker, which spotlighted his contributions to Kubrick’ work. Filmmaker Tony Zierra’s noted that Vitali did everything from casting and coaching actors to overseeing restorations.\n\nHis duties went so far as to once setting up a video monitor so that Kubrick could keep an eye on his dying cat.\n\nMatthew Modine, who starred in Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket, tweeted his condolences Sunday.\n\n“There are people we meet who have a profound impact upon our lives. Leon Vitali was one such person in mine,” Modine wrote. “An artist in every aspect of his life. A loving father & friend to so many. A kind, generous & forgiving nature. He exemplified & personified grace.”\n\nFilmmaker Lee Unkrich also tweeted that he was, “Completely heartbroken to hear about the passing of Leon Vitali. He helped me (asterisk)enormously(asterisk) with my Shining book and I’m gutted that he won’t see it. He was a sweet, kind, humble, generous man and a vital part of Stanley Kubrick’s team.”\n\nVitali was considered a rising actor before he met Kubrick. He appeared in several British television shows, including Softly, Softly, Follyfoot, Z Cars and Notorious Woman. In 1974, he was cast in Kubrick’s film Barry Lyndon as Lord Bullingdon, the son-in-law of Ryan O’Neal’s title character."
