        "text": "Later I studied at St Martin’s School of Art and wherever I could in between babies and stuff!\n\nIB: You’re German. What’s your background?\n\nCK: I was born in 1932 in Braunschweig, a town in North Germany. I then lived in many different places as my parents were opera singers. Later, I was evacuated and I lived in my Nan’s relatives house in a brickworks, in the countryside. Then I lived with lots of other people after the war and went to boarding school.\n\nI was 23 when I met Stanley and we got married a year or so later. I had been married before – criminally young – and had my eldest daughter, Katherine, in Germany before I went to the US. Stanley and I had Vivien who lives in California and Anya**.\n\nIB: Moving to your paintings, the colours you use are very vivid, strong. Are they what you see or what you’d prefer them to be?\n\nCK: I tend to see the world in bright colours, but now I’m longing to use more muted versions. I hope it comes not from growing older but from being more sensitive.\n\nIB: So your style changes …\n\nCK: Yes, it goes in phases. It’s a bit like handwriting – one day you write and it looks okay and another day you think how beautiful and neat it looks. Seems to be true of painting too.\n\nIB: Do you sell most of your work?\n\nCK: Well, it goes in waves, I sold very well at first on the Internet but that was because I was riding on Stanley’s coat tails and when he died lots more people looked me up, otherwise I think I wouldn’t be looked up that much. So that was good for sad reasons. It seems to have evened out. I sell at ‘Art in Action’, I sell to people who collect my work – overall I have sold a little over half my work. Of course, when I was young I sold them very cheap and I sold lots!\n\nIB: Away from art, what makes you angry?\n\nCK: The war in Iraq, but it’s not something I want to speak publicly about …"
