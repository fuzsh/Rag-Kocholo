        "text": "\"I would like to ask your preferences in terms of cinema. What kind...? \"\n\n\"I like good films.\" [laughs]\n\nStanley Kubrick, interview by Vicente Molina Foix, El Pais - Artes, 1980\n\nSitting in the projection room of his English mansion, Stanley Kubrick immersed himself in the images of his time, trying, as he said, to \"see everything\". But what did his visionary eye retain from this stream?\n\nThis list of the 100 \"films of his life\" provides us with some answers. It is based on a collection of interviews with the filmmaker by the British critic Nick Wrigley, and completed by the memories of his faithful collaborator Jan Harlan."
