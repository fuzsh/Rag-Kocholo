        "text": "LONDON &#151; Stanley Kubrick, a visionary craftsman whose films included Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, died Sunday. He was 70.Police were summoned to Kubrick\\'s rural estate 25 miles northwest of London and certified his death. \"There are no suspicious circumstances,\" police said. Kubrick\\'s family said there would be no further comment.At the time of his death, Kubrick was preparing for the midyear release of Eyes Wide Shut, his first film in 12 years. Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the film had been shrouded in the secrecy that attended all of Kubrick\\'s later movies.Over a four decades, Kubrick worked infrequently but often brilliantly, and was regarded as a maverick talent and perhaps a genius.\"Stanley Kubrick was the grandmaster of filmmaking. He copied no one, while all of us were scrambling to imitate him,\" director Steven Spielberg said in a statement released by his office.Kubrick was a fierce perfectionist who wouldn\\'t do one take if he could do a hundred. \"He gives new meaning to the word \\'meticulous,\\'\" Jack Nicholson said after working with Kubrick in The Shining.In accepting the D.W. Griffith award, the highest honor of the Directors Guild of America, Kubrick described directing in a videotaped statement.\"Anyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film also knows that, although it can be like trying to write War and Peace in a bumper car in an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal the feeling,\" he said in 1997.Kubrick chronicled the effects of war in Fear and Desire (1953) and Paths of Glory (1957); the suicidal logic of the Cold War in the blackly comic Dr. Strangelove: or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964); and sexual obsession in Lolita (1962).In a book recently published in Britain, another British-based American filmmaker, Terry Gilliam, recounted the impact of Paths Of Glory, a story of insanity among French troops during World War I.\"Suddenly ... there was a movie that was about something &#151; about injustice &#151; with themes and ideas, and the good guys didn\\'t win in the end,\" said Gilliam. \"That film completely changed me.\"Common to all Kubrick\\'s work was a cool, icy brilliance that some found too emotionally detached, even as others hailed the director\\'s visual flair.In Barry Lyndon (1975), based on the 19th-century Thackeray novel, Kubrick insisted on shooting by candlelight.Adapting Stephen King\\'s thriller The Shining for the screen in 1980, Kubrick made a horror film that was all the more disturbing for taking place largely in bright light.The Shining got mixed reviews, as did Full Metal Jacket seven years later. A late arrival in a spate of Vietnam War films, Full Metal Jacket was filmed entirely in England, with northeast London standing in for Vietnam and the Parris Island boot camp.Kubrick was born July 26, 1928, in New York City, and began working as a photographer for Look magazine at age 17. In his off hours, he watched films at the Museum of Modern Art.\"I was aware that I didn\\'t know anything about making films, but I believed I couldn\\'t make them any worse than the majority of films I was seeing. Bad films gave me the courage to try making a movie,\" Kubrick once said.In 1951, he sold a 16-minute short, Day of the Fight, to the RKO film studio.Kubrick was drafted into Spartacus by Kirk Douglas when the production &#151; then the most expensive ever mounted in the United States &#151; ran into trouble. The film included footage shot by the original director, Anthony Mann, and Kubrick was unhappy with the results.\"If I ever needed convincing of the limits of persuasion a director can have on a film where someone else is the producer and he is merely the highest paid member of the crew, Spartacus provided proof to last a lifetime,\" Kubrick told an interviewer.2001: A Space Odyssey, with its dazzling visual imagery and inspired use of music, was a great success, and Kubrick got the second of his four Academy Award nominations for best director. The other nominations were for Dr. Strangelove, Barry Lyndon, and A Clockwork Orange, which unlike 2001 were also nominated for best picture.A Clockwork Orange, set in a violent future, was one of Kubrick\\'s most provocative films and was disparaged by Anthony Burgess, whose novel was the basis of the film. Burgess accused Kubrick of turning his novelistic study of free will into an orgy of violence.One of Kubrick\\'s memorable touches was to have his hero sing \"Singin\\' in the Rain\" while dishing out a brutal beating. Later, the hero is brutally brainwashed by the state.The film\\'s star, Malcolm McDowell, said of Kubrick, \"Extraordinary, yes. Brilliant, yes. But as a human being &#151; that\\'s the test he doesn\\'t do too well.\"McDowell said he was temporarily blinded while filming the brainwashing scene. \"When Stanley saw me with bandages over one eye, he ran up to me shouting \\'Are you all right?\\' Then he added: \\'We shall just have to shoot from the other side,\\'\" McDowell said.Controversy about A Clockwork Orange moved Kubrick to withdraw the film from screens in Britain in 1973 after 61 weeks in London theaters.He is survived by his wife, Susanne Christiane Harlan, and their three daughters. His first two marriages, to Toba Metz in 1948 and Ruth Sobotka in 1954, ended in divorce.<HR>Films of Stanley KubrickEyes Wide Shut (to be released this summer)Full Metal Jacket (1987)The Shining (1980)Barry Lyndon (1975)A Clockwork Orange (1971)2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Dr. Strangelove (1964)Lolita (1962)Spartacus (1960)Paths of Glory (1957)The Killing (1956)Killer\\'s Kiss (1955)Fear and Desire (1953)"
