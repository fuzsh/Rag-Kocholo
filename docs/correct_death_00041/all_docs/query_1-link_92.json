        "text": "Director Stanley Kubrick had worked on many projects that were never completed or fully realized, including a large-scale biographical film about French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte and a film about the horrors of the Holocaust. Now, in an interview with The Guardian, Kubrick’s trusted personal assistant and friend Emilio D’Alessandro revealed that the director was planning to make a “Pinocchio” film and a second WWII film that centered on the Battle of Monte Cassino, one of the bloodiest battles of the war.\n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Stanley Kubrick Reveals the Stanley Kubrick We Never Knew\n\nRegarding “Pinocchio,” D’Alessandro said that Kubrick sent him to buy Italian books about Pinocchio for research. “He wanted to make it in his own way because so many Pinocchios have been made,” D’Alessandro says. “He wanted to do something really big…[Kubrick] said: ‘It would very nice if I could make children laugh and feel happy by making this Pinocchio.'” The primary motivation was that Kubrick wanted to make a film his grandchildren can enjoy. D’Alessandro also emphasized that this project was a completely separate venture from “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” a Kubrick creation that was later directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nStanley Kubrick is responsible for some of the very best films of the 20th century, including “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Dr. Strangelove,” “The Shining,” and his last film “Eyes Wide Shut.”\n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Aesop Rock’s Quirky Remake Of Stanley Kubrick’s ‘The Shining’"
