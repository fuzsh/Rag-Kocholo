Death comes in the form of systemic failures. It is evident in the spectacular collapse of rational plans and the machinery of human affairs, from the failed heist in The Killing (1956), to the dysfunction in the military hierarchy of Paths of Glory (1957), and the only-too-functional doomsday machine in the death comedy, Dr. Strangelove (1964), to HAL’s lethal breakdown in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and Barry Lyndon’s abrupt fall from the aristocracy after the death of his son."
