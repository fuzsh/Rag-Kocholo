        "text": "Stanley Kubrick: 1928–1999\n\nStanley Kubrick made his first film (Day of the Fight) in 1951, and his last (Eyes Wide Shut) almost fifty years later, in 1999. He was often described as a perfectionist, and devoted several years to the production of each film. Since his death in 1999, shortly after filming Eyes Wide Shut, he has been widely regarded as one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. Kubrick avoided the Hollywood system by living and working in England, earning—and perhaps cultivating—a reputation as a reclusive genius. He worked in a wide range of genres, notably science-fiction (2001), black comedy (Dr. Strangelove), horror (The Shining), period drama (Barry Lyndon), and war (Paths Of Glory).\n\nIn addition to the films mentioned below, Kubrick worked uncredited in an unknown capacity on the short documentary World Assembly of Youth (1953), directed by D. Corbitt Curtis and Richard Millett. He also worked as a second-unit director for Norman Lloyd’s five-part Omnibus television mini-series Mr. Lincoln (broadcast in 1952–1953; Kubrick was photographed on the set by The Kentucky Courier-Journal, published on 26th October 1952). He also worked briefly on the set of Lewis Gilbert’s film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), lighting the supertanker set under condition of anonymity. Kubrick appeared with his future wife Toba Metz as an uncredited extra in Hans Richter’s Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947); coincidentally, the film starred Ruth Sobotka, who would become Kubrick’s second wife. He worked uncredited on the English-language dubbing of the Russian film Илья Муромец (1956), released in America as The Sword and the Dragon in 1960. He is also known to have worked on the dubbing and sound editing of an exploitation film with the working title Shark Safari, in 1953, and he worked briefly as an uncredited cinematographer on the spoof serial Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates (Louis McMahon, 1966).\n\nDay of the Fight (1951)\n\nReleased as part of RKO’s This Is America series. An alternate version, without the four-minute prologue added by RKO, omits the This Is America title. Boxer Walter Cartier, the subject of the documentary, was the subject of a previous photo-spread by Kubrick for Look. Kubrick also appears in the film himself: he can be seen loading his camera at the ringside.\n\nFlying Padre (1951)\n\nA documentary about Fred Stadtmuller—a priest from New Mexico who travelled around his parish by aeroplane—released as part of RKO’s Pathé Screenliner series.\n\nThe Seafarers (1953)\n\nKubrick was commissioned by the Seafarers International Union to produce this promotional documentary, which was Kubrick’s first film in colour. Some versions begin with a few seconds of silent footage from the workprint.\n\nFear and Desire (1953)\n\nKubrick’s first feature film, produced independently with a skeleton cast and crew. It was originally shown at the Venice International Film Festival in 1952 under the title Shape of Fear, and Kubrick cut nine minutes of footage before its 1953 general theatrical release. Kubrick later suppressed its distribution, however there were occasional screenings of archival prints at American film festivals. The film was initially available only as a bootleg video, though a restored version was released after Kubrick’s death.\n\nKiller’s Kiss (1955)\n\nKubrick was photographed on the set by Life magazine in 1954, and his voice can be heard briefly on the police radio in one sequence. A scene in which Jamie Smith fondles Irene Kane’s breasts, which was cut from the film at Kane’s request, may have been present in the preview version. The film was censored by the MPAA, with four minutes of footage deleted. A further three minutes were removed before its release. (The original running time was 74 minutes.) The film’s original title, Kiss Me Kill Me, was changed to Killer’s Kiss before general release, though some surviving prints bear the original title.\n\nThe Killing (1956)\n\nKubrick experimented with a complex, non-linear narrative, constructing a series of interconnecting flashbacks, confidently alternating between past and present. He produced the film in partnership with James B. Harris, forming Harris-Kubrick Pictures, and photographed himself and Harris for a Variety press advertisement to promote the film.\n\nPaths of Glory (1957)\n\nThe preview version was 89 minutes, though two minutes were cut by Kubrick before general release. The film was banned in France for nineteen years, though when it was initially released in other Francophone countries the French national anthem was removed from the opening titles soundtrack.\n\nSpartacus (1960)\n\n70mm prints were released in 2.21:1 Super Technirama and stereo sound, with overture, intermission, entr’acte, and exit music. 35mm prints were released in 2.35:1 Technirama. Executive producer Kirk Douglas fired the original director (Anthony Mann) and hired Kubrick after production had already started. Kubrick was photographed on the set in 1960 by Life magazine.\n\nAfter preview screenings at 202 minutes, Kubrick cut thirteen minutes from the film and changed the placement of the intermission, resulting in a first-run version at 189 minutes. Further cuts were then made at the behest of the MPAA, with a “snails and oysters” homoerotic bathing sequence totally removed and milder alternate takes replacing some of the violent shots. The MPAA-approved, censored version was 182 minutes. In 1967, a significantly truncated version (161 minutes) was released in 35mm.\n\nIn 1991, Spartacus was rereleased in a restored version (196 minutes), with Kubrick’s approval. The soundtrack format was 5.1 surround sound, appropriate to the original six-channel version. The MPAA-censored shots were reinstated, as was much of the footage Kubrick himself had removed after the previews. As the original violent shots were restored, the milder alternate takes were removed. The “snails and oysters” sequence was reinserted, though the dialogue between Laurence Olivier and Tony Curtis had to be redubbed as the original soundtrack had been destroyed. Olivier’s lines were dubbed by Anthony Hopkins, as Olivier himself had died before the restoration. Additional footage of Charles Laughton now exists as audio only.\n\nLolita (1962)\n\nSeveral of Lolita’s more risqué innuendos were censored before the film’ release. The MPAA also insisted upon the partial removal of the cot seduction sequence: in the American cinema version, the scene fades ten seconds earlier than in the British version. Kubrick himself is visible in the first shot inside Quilty’s mansion, walking out of the frame on the right hand side. He also personally took some of the publicity photographs of star Sue Lyon. The film was shot with alternating aspect ratios: some scenes are in Academy format, while others are matted at 1.66:1.\n\nDr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nKubrick personally painted the ‘DEAR JOHN’ and ‘Hi THERE!’ slogans on the film’s prop nuclear bombs. An epilogue involving a custard pie fight, which altered the film’s tone from satire to slapstick, was removed by Kubrick before the general release. (This footage is archived at the British Film Institute in London.) Also before the premiere, the word ‘Dallas’ was redubbed by Slim Pickens to “Vegas” following the Dallas assassination of John F. Kennedy. In America, the film begins with a written disclaimer emphasising that it is a work of fiction. The film was shot with alternating aspect ratios: some scenes are in Academy format, while others are matted at 1.66:1. The sleeve for the Criterion Collection’s Dr. Strangelove laserdisc (1992) was designed by Kubrick.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\n70mm prints were released in 2.21:1 Super Panavision 70. Kubrick is visible as a reflection in the astronauts’ helmets during some sequences, and he also provided the breathing soundtrack for Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood’s spacewalking scenes. As the film’s special effects supervisor, Kubrick won his only Academy Award. A documentary, A Look Behind the Future (1967), includes footage of Kubrick on the set, and he was photographed by Antony Armstrong-Jones for Life magazine (vol. 60, no. 20; 20th May 1966) during the making of the film.\n\nNineteen minutes were cut from 2001 by Kubrick after preview screenings, and two of the intertitles were also added at this time; a prologue and voiceover were cut after the exhibitors’ preview. The film’s Cinerama version, identified by the Cinerama logo in the end credits, included overture, intermission, and exit music. There was also a non-Cinerama version, in 35mm, with four-track stereo sound.\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1971)\n\nThe film was originally rated ‘X’ by the MPAA, and the version first released in US cinemas was the uncut ‘X’ version. The following year, Kubrick withdrew the film from US cinemas and modified two sequences with milder alternate takes. This modified version was reclassified ‘R’ by the MPAA, and the ‘R’ version was rereleased in US cinemas to replace the original ‘X’ version. In British cinemas, the original ‘X’ version was the only version to be screened, though in 1974 Kubrick withdrew the film from Britain altogether after he received death threats. (It was rereleased in Britain in 2000, after Kubrick’s death.)\n\nBarry Lyndon (1975)\n\nBarry Lyndon was intended to be projected at 1.66:1, as stipulated in an open letter from Kubrick sent to cinema projectionists.\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nThe voice of Charley, the radio weather announcer, was played by Kubrick himself; Kubrick’s reflection is visible in an office window in the opening scene; and (like Alfred Hitchcock in Psycho) Kubrick wielded the knife himself when it was used to slash Jack Nicholson’s hand. His daughter, Vivian, directed a behind-the-scenes documentary titled Making the Shining for the television series Arena, broadcast in 1980.\n\nAfter the film’s premiere (running 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a short scene outside Durkin’s shop and an explanatory epilogue with Shelley Duvall in hospital before the US general release. Kubrick then cut the film a second time (to 119 minutes), before its European general release. Italian, Spanish, and German inserts were filmed to replace the English-language text seen in Jack’s manuscript. The end credits, originally blue, are white on most video releases.\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nKubrick played the part of Murphy, the radio announcer. As with most of his other films (except the widescreen Spartacus and 2001), he preferred that Full Metal Jacket be shown in the Academy ratio on television and video.\n\nEyes Wide Shut (1999)\n\nThe scene in which Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman kiss in front of a mirror was released in isolation as a teaser trailer at the ShoWest trade fair before the film’s general release. The same scene, as it appears in the film itself, is shorter, is cropped on all four sides, and utilises an alternate take for the moment when Kidman removes her glasses. .\n\nIn America, cloaked figures were digitally inserted to mask the simulated sex in the film’s orgy sequence, in order to secure an ‘R’ rating from the MPAA. The digital figures were not present when the film was screened in the UK. However, for the UK release the orgy scene was censored in a different way: a recital from the Bhagavad Gita during the Meditations music in the orgy scene was removed and replaced. Italian inserts were filmed to replace the English-language text in the warning letter handed to Bill and the newspaper article he reads.\n\nKubrick on Kubrick: Interviews\n\nKubrick avoided public appearances, television interviews, and photographers, though he spoke to journalists with surprising frequency, as this first comprehensive list of Kubrick’s interviews demonstrates. Kubrick also published some of his screenplays, and wrote several published articles and letters; these activities are all listed here. Entries are listed according to the date of their first publication. (Kubrick: The Last Interview, by Adrian Rigelsford and Kim Meffen, published in TV Times on 4th September 1999, is not included, as it was a hoax published by the magazine in error.) The interviews list has been revised and expanded in collaboration with Filippo Ulivieri.\n\n1940s\n\nCamera Quiz Kid...

Ronson made a documentary for More4 (Stanley Kubrick’s Boxes, 15th July 2008). The props and documents Bernd Eichhorn discovered were shown as part of an extensive Stanley Kubrick touring exhibition beginning in 2004, and an exhibition catalogue (Kinematograph XX: Stanley Kubrick, 2004) and documentary (Stanley Kubrick: The Exhibition by Katia de Vidas, 2005) were also released. Alison Castle edited two enormous, lavish books: The Stanley Kubrick Archives (2005) and Stanley Kubrick’s Napoleon: The Greatest Movie Never Made (2009).\n\nJan Harlan, Kubrick’s brother-in-law, directed A Life in Pictures (2001), a feature-length documentary with extensive and rare footage of Kubrick; he also co-edited a book about AI with Jane M. Struthers: Artificial Intelligence — From Stanley Kubrick to Steven Spielberg: The Vision Behind the Film (2009). Christiane Kubrick, the director’s widow, wrote A Life in Pictures (2002), featuring a large selection of Kubrick photographs. In 2007, Kubrick’s archives were transferred from Childwickbury to the University of the Arts in London. In 2014, two books were produced in cooperation with the Archives: The Making of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (four volumes, by Piers Bizony) and Stanley Kubrick: New Perspectives (edited by Tatjana Ljujic, Peter Kramer, and Richard Daniels).\n\nKubrick’s Look Photographs: 1945–1950\n\nAt high school (from 1942 to 1946), Kubrick took pictures for the school magazine (Portfolio) and yearbooks. He also sold images to Look magazine, and worked as a photojournalist for the publication until 1950. One of his Look photographs, a portrait of Montgomery Clift, was also published in Flair magazine (vol. 1, no. 8, September 1950); another, taken in the Copacabana nightclub, was published in Quick magazine (Are Nightclubs Old-Fashioned?, 26th November 1951). After leaving Look to become a director, Kubrick had no further photographs published, with two exceptions: a colour self-portrait for the cover of Newsweek (vol. 79, no. 1; 3rd January 1972), and a 1953 portrait of Herman G. Weinberg that was used as the cover photo for Weinberg’s memoir Coffee, Brandy and Cigars: A Kaleidoscope of the Arts — and That Strange Thing Called Life (1982).\n\nKubrick’s photographs were included alongside other Look images in the exhibitions Look at America (1957) and Only in New York: Photographs from Look Magazine (Donald Albrecht and Thomas Mellins, 2009), and the books Our Land, Our People (Edward A. Hamilton and Charles Preston, 1958), School Photojournalism: Telling Your School Story in Pictures (Edward A. Hamilton, 1958), and The Look Book (Leo Calvin Rosten, 1975). Look reprinted two of Kubrick’s photographs after he left the magazine: a portrait of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein (12th July 1955), and a photo of cannabis (Dope Is Threatening Our Youth, 13th March 1951). The Look photographic archives are currently held at the Library of Congress in Washington and the Museum of the City of New York.\n\nAn exhibition of Kubrick’s photographs curated by Michel Draguet, Stanley Kubrick: Photographer, opened in 2012, and its catalogue was published as Stanley Kubrick: Fotografo. Donald Albrecht and Sean Corcoran curated the exhibition Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs in 2018, which was accompanied by an extensive catalogue. Rainer Crone curated three exhibitions of Kubrick’s photographs, all with accompanying catalogues: Stanley Kubrick: Still Moving Pictures — Fotografien 1945–1950 (with Petrus Graf Schaesberg, 1999), Stanley Kubrick: Fotografie 1945–1950 (2010), and Stanley Kubrick: Visioni e finzioni 1945–1950 (2011). Selections of Kubrick’s Look photographs have been published in three further books: Stanley Kubrick: Ladro di sguardi — Fotografie di fotografie 1945–1950 (1994), Art by Film Directors (Karl French, 1994), and Stanley Kubrick: Drama and Shadows — Photographs 1945–1950 (Rainer Crone, 2005).\n\nA copy of this first comprehensive list of Kubrick’s photographs is included in the Stanley Kubrick Archive at the University of the Arts, London, and it was reprinted in Stanley Kubrick: Fotografie 1945–1950 — Un narratore della condizione (Rainer Crone, 2010).
