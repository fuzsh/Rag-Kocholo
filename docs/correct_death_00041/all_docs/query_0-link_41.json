        "text": "The first major exhibition of legendary director Stanley Kubrick's film props, possessions and memorabilia is being held in Frankfurt am Main in Germany.\n\nKubrick's meticulous planning comes through in the show\n\nWhen Kubrick died in 1999, shortly before the release of his last film, rumours abounded about his compulsive obsessiveness and predilection for reclusion.\n\nThere were many myths about the man, but little was known about the methods he used to conjure masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr Strangelove.\n\nThe exhibition, put together with the help of Kubrick's widow Christiane (herself German) and his long-standing executive producer Jan Harlan seeks to remedy that.\n\nAlthough what is on show represents a fraction of the material of the Kubrick estate at his home near St Albans in England, the array is simply mind-boggling.\n\nIt ranges from costumes to props, camera equipment to extensive working and research documents, and his chess set - he played a lot when shooting - to annotated scripts.\n\nKubrick's widow Christiane in the exhibition's Eyes Wide Shut set\n\nIt is public knowledge that Kubrick planned his film projects down to the minutest detail.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in exhibits relating to the preparation of the film Napoleon, which Kubrick never made.\n\nFor two years in the late 1960s-early 1970s, Kubrick researched the project in depth, working on the screenplay, finding locations, commissioning costume designs and bombarding a Napoleon expert with detailed questions on the great man's smallest habits.\n\nThe most impressive exhibit is the shooting schedule of the film Kubrick said would be the best ever made.\n\nThe schedule is timed to the second and includes information on sequence order, cross-referenced to their order of appearance in the screenplay, whether the scene would be shot by day or night, its location, in which country, and in which season.\n\nBut Kubrick did not stop there. Displayed are also the armoire-full of books on the French emperor - Kubrick reckoned he had read almost everything published on the subject - with index cards cataloguing information on all the important persons around Napoleon and their movements ordered by year.\n\nKUBRICK FILMOGRAPHY\n\n1999: Eyes Wide Shut\n\n1987: Full Metal Jacket\n\n1980: The Shining\n\n1975: Barry Lyndon\n\n1971: A Clockwork Orange\n\n1968: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n1964: Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\n1962: Lolita\n\n1960: Spartacus\n\n1957: Paths of Glory\n\n1956: The Killing\n\n1955: Killer's Kiss\n\n1953: The Seafarers, Fear and Desire\n\n1951: Flying Padre, Day of the Fight\n\nIn the end, the monumental project never came to pass because of technical problems - Kubrick wanted to shoot inside scenes by candlelight only - and high production costs.\n\nOther goodies on show include personal letters - one from Katharine Hepburn, gently turning down a request to star in a Kubrick film - and letters from fans marked \"F-P\" for the positive ones and \"F-N\" for the negative ones.\n\nPlus there are photographs of the so-called pie scene, which never made the final cut in Dr Strangelove.\n\nIt was shot over five days and required 3,000 pies - but was taken out because Kubrick thought it would turn the film he described as a \"nightmare-comedy\" into a mere farce.\n\nThen there is the famous Dali-inspired, lip-shaped red settee used in Lolita; the zero-gravity loo door used in 2001; the outrageous naked-woman coffee table of A Clockwork Orange; sketches for Artificial Intelligence, eventually completed by Steven Spielberg; and the small-scale model of the war room in Dr Strangelove - never entirely seen on screen.\n\nThe exhibition gives an insight into the methods of the great director, but reveals very little about the man himself.\n\nLIFE IN DATES\n\n1928: Born on 26 July in The Bronx, New York\n\n1946-1951: Photographer for Look magazine\n\n1953: Produces and directs first feature film Fear and Desire\n\n1957: Paths of Glory is banned in Switzerland and Israel. Not distributed in France until 1975\n\n1961: After filming Spartacus, Kubrick quits Hollywood and moves to London\n\n1974: Withdraws Clockwork Orange in the UK due to adverse public reaction and personal threats\n\n1999: Dies on 7 March\n\nOne of his quotes on the attraction of ghost stories hints at his grasp of psychology and philosophical search for meaning.\n\n\"Ghost stories appeal to our craving for immortality,\" he said. \"If you can be afraid of a ghost then you have to believe that a ghost may exist. And if a ghost exists, then oblivion might not be the end.\"\n\nOf 2001, his most seminal work, he said it was about the search for God.\n\nBut his most revealing insight came from what he said about Napoleon: \"He fascinates me. He was one of those rare men who moved history and moulded the destiny of their own times and of generations to come.\"\n\nA comment that could be easily applied to the man whose vision and directorial techniques influenced film as an art form in the 20th Century."
