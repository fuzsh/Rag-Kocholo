        "text": "LONDON — Stanley Kubrick, the director of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"A Clockwork Orange,\" whose films often puzzled and shocked audiences only to end up as classics, died yesterday at his home in England, his family said. He was 70.\n\nPolice were summoned to Kubrick's rural home north of London yesterday afternoon, said authorities in Hertfordshire, where he was certified dead. \"There are no suspicious circumstances,\" police said.\n\nKubrick's family announced his death, and said there would be no further comment.\n\nKubrick's films included \"Spartacus\" in 1960, \"Lolita\" in 1962, \"Dr. Strangelove\" in 1964, \"2001\" in 1968 and \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 1971.\n\nHe also made \"Barry Lyndon,\" released in 1975, \"The Shining\" in 1980 and \"Full Metal Jacket\" in 1987.\n\nMalcolm McDowell, who starred in \"A Clockwork Orange,\" issued a statement through his publicist calling Kubrick \"a heavyweight of my life.\"\n\n\"He was the last great director of that era. He was the big daddy,\" said McDowell.\n\nKubrick's latest film, \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" is slated for release on July 16, Warner Bros. said yesterday. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in the story of jealous obsession, which Kubrick made in great secrecy.\n\n\"He was like family to us and we are in shock and devastated,\" Cruise and Kidman said in a statement released by their publicist.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg issued a statement describing Kubrick as a \"grand master of filmmaking.\"\n\n\"He created more than just movies. He gave us complete environmental experiences,\" Spielberg said.\n\nKubrick was born on July 26, 1928, in New York.\n\nAt 17, he was hired as a staff photographer by Look magazine, which had been impressed by a picture Kubrick had snapped on the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt died.\n\nWhile working at Look, he studied film by attending screenings at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\"I was aware that I didn't know anything about making films, but I believed I couldn't make them any worse than the majority of films I was seeing. Bad films gave me the courage to try making a movie,\" Kubrick once said.\n\nIn 1951, he sold a 16-minute documentary about a boxer, \"Day of the Fight,\" to the RKO film studio.\n\nKubrick was drafted by actor Kirk Douglas into the film \"Spartacus\" when the production - then the most expensive ever mounted in the United States - ran into trouble. The film, about a slave revolt in ancient Rome, included some footage shot by the original director, Anthony Mann, and Kubrick did not regard the finished product as a great success.\n\n\"I tried with only limited success to make the film as real as possible but I was up against a pretty dumb script which was rarely faithful to what is known about Spartacus,\" Kubrick told an interviewer.\n\n\"Lolita,\" starring James Mason and Shelley Winters, was based on Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a professor who is sexually obsessed with a 12-year-old girl. The work was filmed in Britain, in part because of censorship problems, and thereafter Kubrick was based in Britain.\n\n\"Dr. Strangelove,\" starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, was a black comedy about nuclear war released in the early 1960s during a period of great fears over the bomb and Cold War tensions.\n\n\"2001,\" a science fiction film about the evolution of man and humanity's place in the universe, combined dazzling visual imager an inspired use of music. It proved to be a great success for Kubrick.\n\nIn an interview with Playboy magazine, Kubrick said he had \"tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious with an emotional and philosophic content ... just as music does. ... You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning.\"\n\n\"A Clockwork Orange,\" set in a violent future, is a graphic film about a young thug who carries out rapes and beatings before being sent to prison where he is brainwashed.\n\nThe film was one of Kubrick's most controversial - it was even disparaged by Anthony Burgess, whose novel was the basis of the film, and Kubrick eventually removed it from screens in Britain. One of Kubrick's memorable touches was to have his hero sing \"Singin' in the Rain\" while dishing out a brutal beating.\n\n\"The Shining,\" a thriller based on a Stephen King novel, starred Jack Nicholson as a writer who went mad and attacked his family while at a deserted, snowbound resort hotel.\n\nKubrick was married three times, first in 1948 to Toba Metz, then after divorcing he married Ruth Sobotka in 1954. Their marriage ended three years later, and in 1958, he wedded Suzanne Harlan, with whom he had three daughters.\n\nDetails about funeral arrangements were not immediately available."
