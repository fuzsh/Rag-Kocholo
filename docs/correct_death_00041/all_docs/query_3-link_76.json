Sometimes death was unspeakably cruel, as in Paths Of Glory, where the politics of a brutal war lead to three unjust executions.\nBut death could also be far more enigmatic - and not necessarily the final stop. In 2002 A Space Odyssey, space traveler Dave finds himself aging rapidly, as death seems near. But it’s not; he is reborn as a star child in an orb, floating above Earth.\nAnd in The Shining? A homicidal Jack Torrance collapses in the Overlook Hotel’s maze and freezes to death. But does he? The final glimpse into the photo in the Overlook lobby, with Jack posing with fellow guests on July 4 1921, suggests death has met Jack more than once.\nPerhaps Kubrick felt death was one stop along life’s journey - but not necessarily the ultimate one.\nA brilliant man.\n#stanleykubrick #stanleykubrickfilm #stanleykubrickmovies #pathsofglory #kirkdouglas #2001aspaceodyssey #starchild #theshining #theshiningmovie #jacktorrance #theoverlookhotel #deathinmovies #death #movies\".",
