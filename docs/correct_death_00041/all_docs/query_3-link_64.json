        "meta_description": "By the time director Stanley Kubrick began principal photography on his final film, Eyes Wide Shut in 1996, he had been living in England for over 35 years. As the United States wandered blindly into the 1960s, still beaming from the pristine kitchen-countertop sheen that characterized much of suburbia in midcentury America, the Bronx-born filmmaker felt stymied by the formulaic conventions that Hollywood demanded. Fleeing for both a change of scenery and the freedom to make his adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s controversial novel Lolita, Kubrick was unencumbered by the moral panics American journalists stoked for sport, eventually settling into a sprawling manor in the English countryside, about a 30-minute drive from London, where he lived until his death in 1999, at age 70.",
