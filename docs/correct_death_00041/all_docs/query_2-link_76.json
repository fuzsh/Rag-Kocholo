        "text": "Shelley Duvall, the intrepid, Texas-born movie star whose wide-eyed, winsome presence was a mainstay in the films of Robert Altman and who co-starred in Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining,\" has died. She was 75.\n\nDuvall died Thursday in her sleep at home in Blanco, Texas, her longtime partner, Dan Gilroy, announced. The cause was complications from diabetes, said her friend, the publicist Gary Springer.\n\n\"My dear, sweet, wonderful life, partner, and friend left us last night,\" Gilroy said in a statement. \"Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away beautiful Shelley.\"\n\nDuvall was attending junior college in Texas when Altman's crew members, preparing to film \"Brewster McCloud,\" encountered her at a Houston party in 1970. They introduced the 20-year-old to the director, who cast her in \"Brewster McCloud\" and made her his protege.\n\nDuvall would go on to appear in Altman films including \"Thieves Like Us,\" \"Nashville,\" \"Popeye,\" \"Three Women\" and \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller.\"\n\n\"He offers me d*** good roles,\" Duvall told The New York Times in 1977. \"None of them have been alike. He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him. I remember the first advice he ever gave me: 'Don't take yourself seriously.'\"\n\nDuvall, gaunt and gawky, was no conventional Hollywood starlet. But she had a beguilingly frank manner and exuded a singular naturalism. The film critic Pauline Kael called her the \"female Buster Keaton.\"\n\nAt her peak, Duvall was a regular star in some of the defining movies of the 1970s. In \"The Shining\" (1980), she played Wendy Torrance, who watches in horror as her husband, Jack (Jack Nicholson), goes crazy while their family is isolated in the Overlook Hotel. It was Duvall's screaming face that made up half of the film's most iconic image, along with Jack's axe coming through the door.\n\nKubrick, a famous perfectionist, was notoriously hard on Duvall in making \"The Shining.\" His methods of pushing her through countless takes in the most anguished scenes took a toll on the actor. One scene was reportedly performed in 127 takes. The entire shoot took 13 months. Duvall, in a 1981 interview with People magazine, said she was crying \"12 hours a day for weeks on end\" during the film's production.\n\n\"I will never give that much again,\" said Duvall. \"If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me.\"\n\nDuvall disappeared from movies almost as quickly as she arrived in them. By the 1990s, she began retiring from acting and retreated from public life.\n\n\"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime, they turn on you?\" Duvall told the Times earlier this year. \"You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true.\"\n\nDuvall, the oldest of four, was born in Fort Worth on July 7, 1949. Her father, Robert, was a cattle auctioneer before working in law and her mother, Bobbie, was a real estate agent.\n\nDuvall married the artist Bernard Sampson in 1970. They divorced four years later. Duvall was in a long-term relationship with the musician Paul Simon in the late '70s after meeting during the making of Woody Allen's \"Annie Hall.\" (Duvall played the rock critic who keeps declaring things \"transplendent.\") She also dated Ringo Starr. During the making of the 1990 Disney Channel movie \"Mother Goose Rock 'n' Roll,\" Duvall met the musician Dan Gilroy, of the group Breakfast Club, with whom she remained until her death.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Lindsey Bahr of The Associated Press."
