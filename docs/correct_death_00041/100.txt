Three scripts, written almost half a century ago, were found in a trunk filled with valued possessions at Kubrick's home in Childwickbury, in-between Harpenden and St Albans, when he died in 1999.

British film producer Charles Finch announced this month that he will be taking one of the projects forward, with the lead role offered to Irish actor Colin Farrell.

Lunatic at Large, a dark mystery thriller about an escaped axe-murderer, is said to be the missing link between two of Kubrick's most successful films, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining.

The script is said to have been filed away and lost after his move to England in 1961.

His widow, Christiane Kubrick, who still lives at their Harpenden home, said to The Times newspaper last week: "Stanley threw a lot of things away.

"These weren't among them, so he really liked these three projects. I remember reading them at the time. He was very excited about Lunatic but then other things happened...the stories were packed away and then we moved to England to do Lolita here."

Kubrick is already credited with one posthumous film, Artificial Intelligence: AI, which Steven Spielberg adapted from notes and drafts that the director left behind.
