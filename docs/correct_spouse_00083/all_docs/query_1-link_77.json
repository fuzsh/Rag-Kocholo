As important the concept as it is, particularly for elders with chronic diseases, few available instruments have been validated for use with Spanish speaking people. Objective: Translate and adapt the Health Empowerment Scale (HES) for a Spanish-speaking older adults sample and perform its psychometric validation. Methods: The HES was adapted based on the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form. Where \"diabetes\" was mentioned in the original tool, it was replaced with \"health\" terms to cover all kinds of conditions that could affect health empowerment. Statistical and Psychometric Analyses were conducted on 648 urban-dwelling seniors. Results: The HES had an acceptable internal consistency with a Cronbach's Î± of 0.89. The convergent validity was supported by significant Pearson's Coefficient correlations between the HES total and item scores and the General Self Efficacy Scale (r= 0.77), Swedish Rheumatic Disease Empowerment Scale (r= 0.69) and Making Decisions Empowerment Scale (r= 0.70). Construct validity was evaluated using item analysis, half-split test and corrected item to total correlation coefficients; with good internal consistency (Î±> 0.8). The content validity was supported by Scale and Item Content Validity Index of 0.98 and 1.0, respectively. Conclusions: HES had acceptable face validity and reliability coefficients; which added to its ease administration and users' unbiased comprehension, could set it as a suitable tool in evaluating elder's outpatient empowerment-based medical education programs.

A survey study among Turkish patients with diabetes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEyÃ¼boÄlu, Ezgi; Schulz, Peter J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective This study aimed to assess the impact of health literacy and patient empowerment on diabetes self-care behaviour in patients in metropolitan Turkish diabetes centres. The conceptual background is provided by the psychological health empowerment model, which holds that health literacy without patient empowerment comes down to wasting health resources, while empowerment without health literacy can lead to dangerous or suboptimal health behaviour. Design, setting and participants A cross-sectional study was conducted with 167 patients over the age of 18 from one of two diabetes clinics in a major Turkish City. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to eligible outpatients who had an appointment in one of the clinics. Health literacy was measured by a newly translated Turkish version of the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Chew self-report scale. Patient empowerment was measured by a 12-item scale based on Spreitzer's conceptualisation of psychological empowerment in the workplace. Self-care behaviour was measured by the Self-care behaviours were measured by the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA). Level of diabetes knowledge was measured by Diabetes Knowledge Test. Results Two subscales of empowerment, impact and self-determination, predicted self-reported frequency of self-care behaviours. Neither health literacy nor diabetes knowledge had an effect on self-care behaviours. Conclusions Health literacy might be more effective in clinical decisions while empowerment might exert a stronger influence on habitual health behaviours.

This study evaluated the correlations among patient empowerment, self-care behavior, and glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes in mainland China. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study. Eight hundred eighty-five patients who sought care at hospitals in Nanjing, Changsha, Yunnan, and Chongqing, China, were enrolled. Structured questionnaires and medical records provided the data. The instruments included a demographic and clinical questionnaire, the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form, and the Chinese version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was used as a measure of glycemic control. The data analyses are presented as proportions, means (Â±SD), Î², and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multilinear regressions were used to examine the correlations among the scores of patient empowerment, self-care behavior, and HbA1c values. Linear regression revealed that patient empowerment was a statistically significant predictor of patients' self-care behavior even after controlling for age, gender, marital status, educational level, and diabetes duration. Diet (Î²=0.449; 95% CI, 0.370, 0.528), exercise (Î²=0.222; 95% CI, 0.164, 0.279), blood glucose testing (Î²=0.152; 95% CI, 0.106, 0.199), medication taking (Î²=0.062; 95% CI, 0.030, 0.095), and foot care (Î²=0.279; 95% CI, 0.217, 0.342). Additionally, patient empowerment was a statistically significant predictor of HbA1c (Î²=-0.094; 95% CI, -0.123, -0.065). Our study indicated that perceived diabetes empowerment is a predictor of self-care behavior and HbA1c in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, interventions to enhance and promote patient empowerment should be essential components of diabetes education programs to improve self-care behavior and glycemic control.\n\nEmpowerment in the Treatment of Diabetes and Obesity.\n\nPubMed\n\nÅuczyÅski, WÅodzimierz; GÅowiÅska-Olszewska, Barbara; Bossowski, Artur\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAs the available therapies for diabetes and obesity are not effective enough, diabetologists and educators search for new methods to collaborate with patients in order to support their health behaviors. The aim of this review is to discuss perspectives for the development of new empowerment-type therapies in the treatment of diabetes/obesity. Empowerment is a process whereby patients gain the necessary knowledge to influence their own behavior to improve the quality of their lives. It is carried out in five stages: (1) identify the problem, (2) explain the feelings and meanings, (3) build a plan, (4) act, and (5) experience and assess the execution. Although many years have passed since the advent and popularization of the concept of empowerment, the area remains controversial, mainly with regard to the methodology of therapy. Some previous studies have confirmed the positive effect of empowerment on body weight, metabolic control, and quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes; however, few studies have been conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes. There is still a need to confirm the effectiveness of empowerment in accordance with Evidence Based Medicine by performing long-term observational studies in a large group of patients. In future, empowerment may become part of the standard of care for patients with diabetes and/or obesity.\n\nEmpowerment in the Treatment of Diabetes and Obesity\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAs the available therapies for diabetes and obesity are not effective enough, diabetologists and educators search for new methods to collaborate with patients in order to support their health behaviors.

However, few researchers specifically focus on the barriers to and facilitators of empowerment in Iranian people with diabetes. Understanding the factors could help health professionals facilitate self-empowerment more effectively. This study aims to determine the barriers to and facilitators of empowerment in Iranian people with diabetes. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using in-depth interviews to collect the data from 11 women and men in 2007. Themes were identified using constant comparative analysis method. Common barriers to empowerment were similar to other chronic diseases: prolonged stress, negative view about diabetes, ineffective health-care systems, poverty and illiteracy. Diabetes education, fear of diabetes' complications, self-efficacy and hope for a better future emerged as being crucial to empowerment. Facilitators specific to Iranians were: the power of religion and faith, the concept of the doctor as holy man, accepting diabetes as God's will, caring for the body because it was God's gift and support from families especially daughters. Empowerment was strongly influenced by cultural and religious beliefs in Iran and the power of faith emerged as an important facilitator of diabetes empowerment. The findings will help health professionals understand how Iranian people with diabetes view life and the factors that facilitate empowerment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which perception of empowerment by Arab adults living with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) was associated with better glycemic control and self-care management. A cross-sectional descriptive study was led among 300 Arab adults living in Oman with T2DM in an outpatient diabetes clinic. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES), glycosylated haemaglobin (HbA1c) and Body mass index was assessed. The DES was found to be valid and reliable for the population. ANOVA, Regression analysis, and Structural equation modeling was used for analysis. The composite score and three subscales of DES were a significant and strong predictor of good glycemic control among Omani adults with T2DM (p<0.001). Age, education, duration of DM, prior DM education program and medications were significantly associated with DES. Diabetes nurse educators engaged in the care of adults with T2DM should assess self-empowerment and tailor interventions to increase empowerment for better glycemic control. Patient empowerment plays an essential role in maintaining self-care behaviours and HbA1c.\n\nDo Perceptions of Empowerment Affect Glycemic Control and Self-Care Among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDâSouza, Melba Sheila; Karkada, Subrahmanya Nairy; Hanrahan, Nancy P.; Venkatesaperumal, Ramesh; Amirtharaj, Anandhi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: The Arab adult with T2DM is understudied with less known facts about the perception of empowerment and its relationship with self-care and glycemic control.

PMID:26156908\n\nThe context of empowerment and self-care within the field of diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nScambler, Sasha; Newton, Paul; Asimakopoulou, Koula\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThere is a growing emphasis within the diabetes literature on the importance of empowerment as a way of encouraging people to take control of and responsibility for the successful management of their disease. Patients are actively encouraged to become active participants in their care, and there is an expectation that health-care professionals will facilitate this process. This article uses Bourdieu's concept of field, as a bounded social space in which actors conduct their lives day-to-day, to explore the context within which issues of empowerment are addressed and negotiated. The practice of empowerment within the biologically defined and biomedically 'policed' field of diabetes is explored using empirical data from a study of diabetes health-care professionals' understanding and practices around empowerment. It is concluded that rather than promoting active self-management and empowerment, the nature of the field of diabetes, and in particular its privileging of the biomedical, can mitigate against people with diabetes negotiating the field effectively and taking control of the disease and its management.

A quasi-experimental pre and post design was used to investigate the impact of using education on self-management as measured by A1C levels and empowerment scores. Nine hours of diabetes self-management education classes were offered in the Armenian language to 75 clients at 2 adult health day care centers over 6 weeks. The participants were mostly first-generation Armenian immigrants aged 65 years and older. A1C results, the 8-item Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES), and the 15-item Armenian Ethnic Orientation Questionnaire-Revised (AEOQ-R) were used to determine the impact of education on self-care management. After institutional review board approval was obtained, 75 participants completed the study. A paired t test indicated that the postintervention mean A1C level was significantly lower than the preintervention mean A1C level. The postintervention mean DES score was significantly greater than the preintervention mean DES score. No mediating effects of age, gender, acculturation, and number of years with the disease were identified for either A1C or DES score. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the diabetes self-management education classes in improving diabetes self-care management skills.

Diabetes management is impossible when only utilizing medication. So, patients must be educated to manage their diabetes. This study aims to assess the effect of education by telephone and short message service on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes (primary outcome). A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Urmia diabetes association in Iran. Sixty six participants with definitive diagnosis of type 2 diabetes entered into the study. Patients with secondary health problems were excluded. Patients were selected by simple random sampling then allocated into intervention (n=33) and control (n=33) groups. The intervention group received an educational text message daily and instructive phone calls three days a week for three months along with usual care. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) with confirmed validity and reliability was used for collecting data. Data was analyzed using SPSS V6.1. Independent t-test, paired t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data. The empowerment of the intervention group compared with the control group significantly improved after three months of distance education (p<0.00, EF=1. 16). The study findings show that the distance education has a significant effect on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, using distance education along with other diabetes management intervention is highly effective and should be part of the care in diabetes treatment. Copyright Â© 2016 Diabetes India.

METHODS Assessment of the instrumentâs conceptual equivalence, as well as its translation and cross-cultural adaptation were performed following international standards. The Expert Committeeâs assessment of the translated version was conducted through a web questionnaire developed and applied via the web tool e-Surv. The cross-culturally adapted version was used for the pre-test, which was carried out via phone call in a group of eleven health care service users diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pre-test results were examined by a group of experts, composed by health care consultants, applied linguists and statisticians, aiming at an adequate version of the instrument, which was subsequently used for test and retest in a sample of 100 users diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus via phone call, their answers being recorded by the web tool e-Surv. Internal consistency and reproducibility of analysis were carried out within the statistical programming environment R. RESULTS Face and content validity were attained and the Brazilian Portuguese version, entitled Escala de AutoeficÃ¡cia em Diabetes â VersÃ£o Curta, was established. The scale had acceptable internal consistency with Cronbachâs alpha of 0.634 (95%CI 0.494â 0.737), while the correlation of the total score in the two periods was considered moderate (0.47).

The BENCH-D study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossi, Maria Chiara; Lucisano, Giuseppe; Funnell, Martha; Pintaudi, Basilio; Bulotta, Angela; Gentile, Sandro; Scardapane, Marco; Skovlund, Soren Eik; Vespasiani, Giacomo; Nicolucci, Antonio\n\n2015-09-01\n\nWe evaluated empowerment in T2DM and identified its correlates. A sample of individuals self-administered the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form (DES-SF) and other 9 validated instruments (person-centered outcomes). Correlates of DES-SF were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses. For person-centered outcomes, ORs express the likelihood of being in upper quartile of DES-SF (Q4) by 5 units of the scale. Overall, 2390 individuals were involved. Individuals in Q4 were younger, more often males, had higher levels of school education, lower HbA1c levels and prevalence of complications as compared to individuals in the other quartiles. The likelihood of being in Q4 was directly associated with higher selfreported self-monitoring of blood glucose (SDSCA6-SMBG) (OR=1.09; 95% CI: 1.03-1.15), higher satisfaction with diabetes treatment (GSDT) (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.25), perceived quality of chronic illness care and patient support (PACIC-SF) (OR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.16-1.31), and better person-centered communication (HCC-SF) (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19) and inversely associated with diabetes-related distress (PAID-5) (OR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). Adjusted DES-SF mean scores ranged between centers from 69.8 to 93.6 (intra-class correlation=0.10; p<0.0001). Empowerment was associated with better glycemic control, psychosocial functioning and perceived access to person-centered chronic illness care. Practice of diabetes center plays a specific role. DES-SF represents a process and outcome indicator in the practice of diabetes centers. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Few instruments have been developed to measure health promotion self-care behavior of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Developing and psychometric testing of the Chinese version of the Diabetes Health Promotion Self-Care Scale (DHPSC) for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Four hundred and eighty-nine patients with Type 2 diabetes were recruited from endocrine clinics in four hospitals in Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the construct validity of the scale. Correlations between the DHPSC and the satisfaction subscale of Diabetes Quality of Life, Diabetes Empowerment Scale, and HbA1c were calculated to evaluate concurrent validity. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were used to assess the reliability of the scale. The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008. A proposed second-order factor model with seven subscales and 26 items fit the data well. The seven subscales were interpersonal relationships, diet, blood glucose self-monitoring, personal health responsibility, exercise, adherence to the recommended regimens, and foot care. The DHPSC statistically significantly correlated with the satisfaction subscale of Diabetes Quality of Life and the Diabetes Empowerment Scale. HbA1c only statistically significantly correlated with the subscale of health responsibility. Reliability was supported by acceptable Cronbach's alpha (range, .78-.94) and test-retest reliability (range, .76-.95). The DHPSC has satisfactory reliability and validity. Healthcare providers can use the DHPSC to comprehensively assess the health promotion self-care behaviors of patients with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nCollective empowerment strategies for patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaldoni, Nayara Ragi; Aquino, JÃ©ssica Azevedo; Sanches-Giraud, Cristina; Di Lorenzo Oliveira, ClÃ¡udia; de Figueiredo, Roberta Carvalho; Cardoso, Clareci Silva; Santos, Thiago Reis; Alves, Geisa Cristina Silva; Dal Fabbro, Amaury Lelis; Baldoni, AndrÃ© Oliveira\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and analyze collective empowerment strategies for patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The systematic review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct and BVS. The term \"Diabetes Mellitus\" was used with each of the following describers, along with the connector \"AND\": \"self-care\", \"health education\", \"motivation\" and \"empowerment\". Inclusion criteria were: intervention study with control group published between 2004 and 2014. For meta-analysis, RevMan V 5.3 software was used. Among the nine analyzed articles, 66.7% (n=6) were developed in patients diagnosed with DM2. Concerning the indicators for intervention effectiveness evaluation, all articles (n=9) used glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the most used instrument was Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities Measure, representing 44.4% (n=4) of the studies. The types of strategies used were similar in the articles. There was evidence of a decrease in HbA1c levels in 66.7% (n=6). The meta-analysis found significant evidence indicating beneficial effects of empowerment. Programs based on collective empowerment in DM have shown the interventions lead to improvement in clinical parameters, behavior, increased knowledge about DM, and self-care.

In rural areas, access to health care may be limited, and support from family members becomes important. The aim of this study was to describe perceptions and associations of diabetes empowerment, self-management ability and needs of self-management support among people with T2D in a northern rural community of Sweden. People with T2D (n = 159) living a rural municipality in northern Sweden answered the SWE-DES-23 questionnaire and additional questions concerning self-management and needs for self-management support. A higher diabetes empowerment was associated with longer diabetes duration and support from healthcare professionals and relatives. Women rated a need for self-management support significantly higher than men did. Nonretired persons rated a significantly higher need for self-management support and a lower perception of support from healthcare professionals compared to retired persons. Cohabitant persons had a significantly higher perception of support from relatives and also estimated a higher need for relatives' involvement in clinical visits compared to persons living alone. Both the newly diagnosed and also those people with a diabetes duration of 10-15 years rated a higher need for group support. Higher self-awareness and readiness to change were apparent among people with short and long diabetes duration. Furthermore, self-management ability, support from healthcare professionals and from relatives and lastly diabetes duration was associated with diabetes empowerment. Not only people newly diagnosed with T2D should be offered patient-centred group support, strengthening patient empowerment.

Participants were recruited from three community health centers in South Korea from September 2016 - April 2017 using a convenience sampling method. A total of 136 people with diabetes aged 60 and above were participated in this study. The main study variables of health literacy, empowerment and diabetes self-care activities were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. This study applied a simple mediation analysis with a single covariate using the PROCESS macro, with health literacy entered as an antecedent variable, empowerment as a mediator, diabetes self-care behaviors as outcome variables and diabetes education as a covariate. After controlling for diabetes education, the indirect effects of health literacy to self-care behaviors through empowerment were significant when the self-care behaviors were particularly diet and physical exercise. Whereas, the indirect effects were not significant when the self-care behaviors were foot care and blood glucose monitoring. This study indicates that the people with higher health literacy were more empowered and those with higher empowerment were more likely to eat healthy foods and exercise. In the light of these findings, a health literacy-tailored empowerment enhancing program may be important targets for interventions promoting diabetes self-care behaviors of diet and physical exercise.

Effective empowerment approach can be beneficial for improving patients' health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of empowerment model on indicators of metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. a randomized controlled trial of 103 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either the intervention (empowerment approach training) or the control group (conventional training) 2014. Empowerment approach training were performed for the experimental group for eight weeks. Data collection tool included demographic information form and indicators of metabolic control checklist. Analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance, chi-square test, paired t-test, independent t-test and multiple linear regression. Before the intervention, two groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and other indicators of metabolic control. After the intervention, average HbA1C and other metabolic indicators except for LDL showed significant differences in the experimental group compared to the control group. study results indicated the positive effects of applying the empowerment model on the metabolic control indicators. Therefore, applying this model is recommended to nurses and the relevant authorities in order to improve clinical outcomes in diabetic patients. Copyright Â© 2015 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

A cohort of 24 250 patients was evaluated using a linked administrative database during 2009-2013. We selected 12 125 patients with Type 2 diabetes who had at least one Patient Empowerment Programme session attendance. Patients who did not participate in the Patient Empowerment Programme were matched one-to-one with patients who did, using the propensity score method. Hospitalization events and emergency department visits were the events of interest. Cox proportional hazard and negative binomial regressions were performed to estimate the hazard ratios for the initial event, and incidence rate ratios for the number of events. During a median 30.5 months of follow-up, participants in the Patient Empowerment Programme had a lower incidence of an initial hospitalization event (22.1 vs 25.2%; hazard ratio 0.879; P < 0.001) and emergency department visit (40.5 vs 44%; hazard ratio 0.901; P < 0.001) than those who did not participate in the Patient Empowerment Programme. Participation in the Patient Empowerment Programme was associated with a significantly lower number of emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio 0.903; P < 0.001): 40.4 visits per 100 patients annually in those who did not participate in the Patient Empowerment Programme vs. 36.2 per 100 patients annually in those who did. There were significantly fewer hospitalization episodes (incidence rate ratio 0.854; P < 0.001): 20.0 hospitalizations per 100 patients annually in those who did not participate in the Patient Empowerment Programme vs. 16.9 hospitalizations per 100 patients annually in those who did. Among patients with Type 2 diabetes, the Patient Empowerment Programme was shown to be effective in delaying the initial\n\nThe construct validity and reliability of the Turkish version of Spreitzer's psychological empowerment scale\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Today, many organizations have adopted some kind of empowerment initiative for at least part of their workforce. Over the last two decades, two complementary perspectives on empowerment at work have emerged: structural and psychological empowerment. Psychological empowerment is a motivational construct manifested in four cognitions: meaning, competence, self-determination and impact. The aim of this article is to examine the construct validity and reliability of the Turkish translation of Spreitzer's psychological empowerment scale in a culturally diverse environment. Methods The scale contains four dimensions over 12 statements. Data were gathered from 260 nurses and 161 physicians. The dimensionality of the scale was evaluated by exploratory factor analyses. To investigate the multidimensional nature of the empowerment construct and the validity of the scale, first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Furthermore, Cronbach alpha coefficients were assessed to investigate reliability. Results Exploratory factor analyses revealed that four factors in both solutions. The first- and second-order factor analysis indicated an acceptable fit between the data and the theoretical model for nurses and physicians. Cronbach alpha coefficients varied between 0.81-0.94 for both groups, which may be considered satisfactory. Conclusions The analyses indicated that the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the scale can be considered satisfactory.

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess measurement equivalence of the 28-item Empowerment Scale (Rogers, Chamberlin, Ellison, & Crean, 1997), using data from 1,035 White and 301 Black persons with severe mental illness. Metric invariance of the Empowerment Scale was supported, in that the factor structure and loadings were equivalent across groups. Scalar invariance was violated on 3 items; however, the impact of these items on scale scores was quite small. Finally, subscales of empowerment tended to be more highly intercorrelated for Black than for White respondents. RESULTS generally support the use of Empowerment Scale for ethnic group comparisons. However, subtle differences in the psychometric properties of this measure suggest that Black and White individuals may conceptualize the construct of empowerment in different ways. Specifically, Black respondents had a lower threshold for endorsing some items on the self-esteem and powerlessness dimensions. Further, White respondents viewed the 3 dimensions of empowerment (self-esteem, powerlessness, and activism) as more distinct, whereas these 3 traits were more strongly interrelated for Blacks.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an empowerment program providing support for psychosocial, behavioral, and clinical aspects of diabetes to help Brazilian users of public health services obtain metabolic control of this condition. In this cluster randomized trial, participants aged 30-80 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were recruited from ten Brazilian public health units in 2014 and 2015. Five units were randomly assigned to receive the empowerment program based on a behavior change protocol, and five continued to receive only conventional treatment. The primary outcome was the biochemical and anthropometric parameters, and the secondary outcomes were self-care, attitude, knowledge and empowerment related to diabetes. The effect of the experiment was defined as the percentage variation between the values at the initial and final periods. To evaluate this effect and to compare it in the two groups, tests were used for paired and independent samples, respectively. There were 238 participants: 127 and 111 in the intervention and control group, respectively. For glycated hemoglobin, the mean effect in the control and intervention groups was 3.93 and -5.13, respectively (pâ<â0.001). Levels of glycated hemoglobin and other metabolic indicators, as well as the most part of the secondary outcomes showed a significant difference in the experimental group compared to the control group. The empowerment program improved metabolic control of type 2 diabetes in Brazilian users.

The role of family services in parental reinforcement is important, given their extensive reach to most families and their aim of promoting family welfare. No instruments applicable to this situation were available in Finland. The Family Empowerment Scale is a widely used instrument that measures parent's empowerment. The personnel version of the Family Empowerment Scale enables an evaluation of the reinforcement of empowerment. This study used a cross-sectional survey design. The Family Empowerment Scale was modified to measure how family services personnel evaluate reinforcement of parental empowerment. In May 2009, a questionnaire was sent to unit heads (nÂ =Â 457) in public social, health and educational services for families with children aged 0-9Â years. The construct, convergent and discriminant validities, reliability and responsiveness of the personnel version of the Family Empowerment Scale were assessed. According to confirmatory factor analysis, the personnel version of the Family Empowerment Scale comprised three subscales (family, service system and community) as in the original Family Empowerment Scale. Confirmed convergent and discriminant validities supported the same construct. The reliability of the personnel version of the Family Empowerment Scale was acceptable. The reinforcement level of parental empowerment was high. Parental empowerment was reinforced most in health and least in educational services. The psychometric properties of the personnel version of the Family Empowerment Scale were acceptable. It can serve as a generic instrument for assessing reinforcement of empowerment in family services in Finland.

The scope of this study is to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument to measure parents' psychological empowerment in their children's vaccination decision and propose a context-specific definition of this construct. Grounding in previous qualitative data, we generated an initial pool of items which was later content and face validated by a panel of experts. A pretest allowed us to reduce the initial pool to 9 items. Convergent and discriminant validity measures included the General Self-Efficacy Scale, a Psychological Empowerment Scale, and the Control Preference Scale. Vaccination-related outcomes such as attitude and intention were also included. Principal Component Analysis revealed a 2-factor structure, with each factor composed of 2 items. The first factor concerns the perceived influence of one's personal and family experience with vaccination, while the second factor represents the desire not to ask other parents about their experience with vaccination and their lack of interest in other parents' vaccination opinion. In light of its association with positive immunization-related outcomes, public health efforts should be directed to reinforce parents' empowerment.\n\nPsychometric Properties of the Family Support Scale Adapted for African American Women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nLittlewood, Kerry; Cummings, Doyle M; Lutes, Lesley; Solar, Chelsey\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe purpose of our study was two-fold: 1) adapt and test a social support measure specific to the experiences of African American women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); 2) examine its relationship to psychosocial measures. 200 rural African American women with uncontrolled T2DM participating in a randomized controlled trial completed surveys at baseline on their social support, empowerment, self-care, self-efficacy, depression and diabetes distress. Exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to test the psychometric properties of the Dunst Family Support Scale adapted for AA women with T2DM (FSS-AA T2DM) and its relationship with other psychosocial measures. The 16 items of the FSS-AA T2DM loaded onto three distinct factors: parent and spouse/partner support, community and medical support, and extended family and friends support. Reliability for the entire scale was good (Cronbach's Î± = .90) and was acceptable to high across these three factors (Cronbach's Î± of .86, .83, and .83 respectively). All three factors were significantly correlated with self-reported empowerment, self-care, self-efficacy, depression and diabetes distress, although the pattern was different for each factor. FSS-AA-T2DM showed good concurrent validity when compared with similar items on the Diabetes Distress Scale. The FSS-AA T2DM, a 16-item scale measuring social support among rural African American women with T2DM, is internally consistent and reliable. Findings support the utility of this screening tool in this population, although additional testing is needed with other groups in additional settings.\n\nValidity and reliability of the Family Empowerment Scale for caregivers of adults with mental health issues.\n\nPubMed\n\nKageyama, M; Nakamura, Y; Kobayashi, S; Yokoyama, K\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Empowerment of family caregivers of adults with mental health issues has received increasing attention among mental health nurses in Japan and has been recognized as a new goal of family interventions. The Family Empowerment Scale (FES) was originally developed to measure the empowerment status of parents of children with emotional disorders. However, it was later applied to broader health issues. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We developed a Japanese version of the FES for family caregivers of adults with mental health issues (FES-AMJ) and examined the validity and reliability among parents. Results showed that the FES-AMJ had acceptable concurrent validity and reliability; however, insufficient construct validity was found, especially for the subscale regarding the service system. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Further studies need to modify the scale. Clarification of ideal family empowerment status in the service system through discussion with mental health nurses and family caregivers may be important. Introduction The Family Empowerment Scale (FES) was originally developed for parents of children with emotional disorders. In Japan, family empowerment is gaining increasing attention and may be one goal of nursing interventions. Aim To develop a Japanese version of the FES for family caregivers of adults with mental health issues and to study the validity and reliability of this scale among parents. Method We translated the FES into Japanese and administered this self-report questionnaire to 275 parents. Results The multitrait scaling analysis revealed acceptable convergent validity and insufficient discriminant validity among all subscales. In particular, all items of the Service system subscale had insufficient discriminant and/or convergent validity. Each subscale significantly correlated with the indicator of empowerment. The intraclass correlation coefficients of each subscale were .855-.917.

ICT can play a key role in better management of diabetes and in patient empowerment. Patient empowerment involves patients to a greater extent in their own healthcare process and disease management becomes an integrated part of their daily life. Self-management opens the possibility for patients to contribute to their own healthcare as well as to be more in control of their disease. The objective of our study was to explore the impact of an ICT-based patient empowerment framework in diabetes self-management. A modular patient empowerment framework that fosters diabetes self-management was designed and implemented. The framework incorporates expert knowledge in the form of clinical guidelines, and it supports patients in the specification of personalized activities that are based on medical recommendations and personal goals, and in the collection of observations of daily living. The usability and usefulness of the proposed framework were assessed in a pilot study with the participation of 60 patients and 12 health professionals. The study revealed that a patient empowerment approach based on self-management ICT tools is useful and accepted by both the patients and the physicians. For those patients who were already disciplined in their disease management the piloted solution served as a facilitator for data logging. For the rest, it served as an incentive for better adherence to disease management principles. The ICT tools prompted many patients into becoming more physically active and into making dietary habits' adjustments. However, this impact proved to be tightly correlated with the sociocultural background of the subjects. The study also demonstrated that even in patient-centric self-management interventions the physicians still have a key role to play. However, the acceptance of such interventions by the healthcare\n\nConceptualizations of patient empowerment among individuals seeking treatment for diabetes mellitus in an urban, public-sector clinic.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamsay Wan, Claire; Vo, Linda; Barnes, Catherine S\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe patient empowerment paradigm has been promoted as a critical component of diabetes care. The present study explores how patients in an urban, public-sector clinic perceive patient empowerment as it applies to their treatment, interactions with clinicians, and self-care behaviors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 individuals and analyzed through an inductive approach. Patient empowerment was described as taking responsibility for self-care behaviors. Participants reported they that must be internally driven to maintain their self-care regiment, and placed moral value on their performance. Some participants asked questions during healthcare encounters, but fewer reported setting the agenda or making meaningful decisions regarding their care. Gaps in individuals' perception of empowerment were identified, along with barriers such as frustration, fatigue, financial concerns, transportation, and scheduling difficulties. Increasing patient empowerment in socially disadvantaged settings will require careful communication to elicit questions, present all available treatment choices, and encourage individuals to take responsibility without placing blame on them for instances of poor glycemic control.

The article provides preliminary insights into the extent to which cyber patients view the digital environment of peer-based information and support as a resource for informed and empowered participation in self health care management. Data come from cancer patients (N = 350) who participated in the Study of Virtual Health Networks for Cancer Patients of the 21st Century. Data were first analyzed using exploratory factor analysis with principle component extraction and Varimax rotation. Age-based split-sample analysis (â¥ 51 and â¤ 50) was performed on a subsample, which consisted of only women (N = 255), in order to cross-validate psychometric data obtained from the full sample. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using AMOS 19.0. to further validate the scale. The composite scale is unidimensional with excellent internal consistency reliability. The highest average scores were obtained for informational empowerment items. The lowest average was for the item that measured empowerment to seek second opinion from additional health care professionals. The ability of this composite measure to provide information about the extent to which computer-connected patients view digital peer support as an empowerment tool makes it a valuable addition to the literature in health informatics, supportive cancer care, and health quality of life research.\n\nEffectiveness of web-based interventions on patient empowerment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamoocha, David; Bruinvels, David J; Elbers, Nieke A; Anema, Johannes R; van der Beek, Allard J\n\n2010-06-24\n\nPatient empowerment is growing in popularity and application. Due to the increasing possibilities of the Internet and eHealth, many initiatives that are aimed at empowering patients are delivered online. Our objective was to evaluate whether Web-based interventions are effective in increasing patient empowerment compared with usual care or face-to-face interventions. We performed a systematic review by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from January 1985 to January 2009 for relevant citations. From the 7096 unique citations retrieved from the search strategy, we included 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of review authors assessed the methodological quality of the obtained studies using the Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that measured comparable outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to determine the level of evidence for each outcome. In comparison with usual care or no care, Web-based interventions had a significant positive effect on empowerment measured with the Diabetes Empowerment Scale (2 studies, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 - 0.94]), on self-efficacy measured with disease-specific self-efficacy scales (9 studies, SMD = 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 - 0.33), and on mastery measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale (1 study, mean difference [MD] = 2.95, 95% CI 1.66 - 4.24). No effects were found for self-efficacy measured with general self-efficacy scales (3 studies, SMD = 0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.35) or for self-esteem measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1 study, MD = -0.38, 95% CI -2.45 to 1.69). Furthermore, when comparing Web-based interventions with face-to-face deliveries of the same interventions, no significant (beneficial or harmful) effects were found for mastery (1 study, MD = 1.20, 95% CI -1.73 to 4.13) and self-esteem (1 study, MD = -0.10, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.25).

Twenty-seven participants (male and female) were selected through purposive convenience sampling for an explorative qualitative study. Semistructured focus group interviews with four open-ended questions were used to study the participants' self-care behavior at the beginning and the end of the program, and the data obtained were subjected to content analysis. At the end, one third of the participants had been able to reduce their blood glucose to acceptable levels. Most of the others had achieved reduced but irregular blood glucose levels; however, some did not achieve any reduction. Diet was the most difficult problem, and economic difficulties, incorrect knowledge, and misleading beliefs were barriers. In conclusion, an empowerment education program can substantially improve the outcome of self-care management for many people with type 2 diabetes. In the planning of such programs, barriers should be taken into account.

It has been argued that this represents a form of empowerment by patients, as it enables them to control the content and flow of the information available to them. To explore this, the use of online discussion groups by those with diabetes was examined. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 participants with type 1 and 2 diabetes and analysed using thematic analysis. Participants were recruited via online and offline routes, namely discussion boards, newsletters, and research networks related to diabetes. By drawing on the advice, information, and support shared online, participants were empowered to position themselves as active participants in their own health care and to further engage with health-care professionals. The findings indicate that forums can play a valuable role in aiding and motivating individuals in the daily management diabetes and highlight how this support is used to complement formal health services. However, more work needs to be carried out to determine to explore when and under what circumstances online support may be particularly beneficial to those with long-term conditions.

However, it has been shown that through daily monitoring, appropriate patient-specific empowerment, lifestyle behavior of diabetics can be positively influenced and the associated and costly diabetes complications significantly reduced. As personal face-to-face coaching is costly and hard to scale, mobile applications and services have now become a key driver of mobile Health (mHealth) deployment, especially as a helpful way for self-management. Despite the huge mHealth market, a major limitation of many diabetes apps is that they do not use inputted data to help patients determine their daily insulin doses. On the other hand, the majority of existing insulin dose calculator apps provide no protection against - or even may actively contribute to - incorrect or inappropriate dose recommendations that put users at risk. Besides, there is clear evidence that lack of education on insulinotherapy and carbohydrate counting is associated with higher blood glucose variability with type 1 diabetes. Hence, there is a need for an accurate modelling of glucose-insulin dynamics together as well as providing adequate educational support. The aims of this paper are: a) to highlight the usefulness of mHealth technologies in chronic disease management; b) to describe and discuss the development of an insulin bolus calculator integrated into a pilot mHealth app; c) to underline the importance of diabetes self-management education.\n\nSystematic review of empowerment measures in health promotion.\n\nPubMed\n\nCyril, Sheila; Smith, Ben J; Renzaho, Andre M N\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEmpowerment, a multi-level construct comprising individual, community and organizational domains, is a fundamental value and goal in health promotion. While a range of scales have been developed for the measurement of empowerment, the qualities of these have not been rigorously assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the measurement properties of quantitative empowerment scales and their applicability in health promotion programs. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was done to evaluate empowerment scales across three dimensions: item development, reliability and validity. This was followed by assessment of measurement properties using a ratings scale with criteria addressing an a priori explicit theoretical framework, assessment of content validity, internal consistency and factor analysis to test structural validity. Of the 20 studies included in this review, only 8 (40%) used literature reviews, expert panels and empirical studies to develop scale items and 9 (45%) of studies fulfilled â¥5 criteria on the ratings scale. Two studies (10%) measured community empowerment and one study measured organizational empowerment, the rest (85%) measured individual empowerment. This review highlights important gaps in the measurement of community and organizational domains of empowerment using quantitative scales. A priority for future empowerment research is to investigate and explore approaches such as mixed methods to enable adequate measurement of empowerment across all three domains. This would help health promotion practitioners to effectively measure empowerment as a driver of change and an outcome in health promotion programs. Â© The Author 2015.

In order to cope with occupational stress, nurses need to employ flexible adjustment mechanisms that allow them the power to process their experiences. Failure of efficient stress management causes burnout, and burnout is closely related to powerlessness. It is therefore believed that the occurrence of burnout can be reduced by means of psychological empowerment of nurses. Our study was conducted to determine the effect of a \"psychodrama-based psychological empowerment program\" on (1) the perception of empowerment and (2) the levels of burnout in oncology nurses. The sample was made up of 82 oncology nurses (38 nurses in the study group and 44 in the control/comparison group). Study data were collected using the Psychological Empowerment Scale, the Nurse Work Empowerment Scale, and Maslach's Burnout Inventory. The study group attended a \"psychodrama-based psychological empowerment program\" (2 hours, 1 day a week, for 10 weeks). For data assessment, we employed an independent t test and one-way analysis of variance. The psychological empowerment and workplace empowerment scores of nurses in the study group increased and their burnout scores decreased following attendance in the psychodrama-based psychological empowerment program. We found that the psychodrama-based psychological empowerment program increased psychological empowerment and enhanced perception of workplace empowerment while decreasing levels of burnout in oncology nurses. The program is recommended and should allow oncology nurses to benefit from their personal experiences and thus increase self-empowerment, to enhance their perception of empowerment, and to prevent burnout.\n\nThe Utility of the Family Empowerment Scale With Custodial Grandmothers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHayslip, Bert; Smith, Gregory C.; Montoro-Rodriguez, Julian; Streider, Frederick H.; Merchant, William\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Family Empowerment Scale (FES) was developed specifically to assess empowerment in families with emotional disorders. Its relevance to custodial grandfamilies is reflected in the difficulties in grandchildren's social, emotional, and behavioral functioning, wherein such difficulties may be explained via either reactions to changes in their family structure or in their responses to the newly formed family unit. Utilizing 27 items derived from the 34-item version of the FES, which had represented differential levels of empowerment (family, service system, community) as indexed by one's attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, we explored the factor structure, internal consistency, construct, and convergent validity of the FES with grandparent caregivers. Three-hundred forty-three (M age = 58.45, SD = 8.22, n Caucasian = 152, n African American = 149, n Hispanic = 38) custodial grandmothers caring for grandchildren between ages 4 and 12 years completed the 27 FES items and various measures of their psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. Factor analysis revealed three factors that differed slightly from the originally proposed FES subscales: Parental Self-Efficacy/Self-Confidence, Service Activism, and Service Knowledge. Each of the factors was internally consistent, and derived factor scores were moderately interrelated, speaking to the question of convergent validity. The construct validity of these three factors was evidenced by meaningful patterns of statistically significant correlations with grandmothersâ psychological well-being, grandchild psychological difficulties, emotional support, and parenting practices. These factor scores were independent of grandmother age, health, and education. These findings suggest the newly identified FES factors to be valuable in understanding empowerment among grandmother caregivers.

Analysis of data from 464 Korean diabetes patients indicates significant relationships among diabetes patients' online community activities, perceived CMSS, sense of empowerment, and their intention to actively communicate with the doctor. Diabetes patients who have engaged more in online community activities perceived greater social support from other members of the community. Perceived CMSS significantly predicted their intention to actively communicate with the doctor through sense of empowerment. Sense of empowerment was a valid underlying mechanism that explains how patients' perceived CMSS influences their intention to actively communicate with the doctor. The implications for health communication research and practice are discussed.\n\nPsychometric Support for the Ownership in Exercise and Empowerment in Exercise Scales\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMoore, E.

Diabetes treatment, as for all chronic diseases, relies on patients' ability to cope with daily problems concerning the management of their disease in accordance with medical recommendations. Thus, it is important that patients learn to manage and cope with their disease and gain greater control over actions and decisions affecting their health. Healthcare professionals should aim to encourage and increase patients' perception about their ability to take informed decisions about disease management and to improve patient self-esteem and feeling of self-efficacy to become agents of their own health. E for Empowerment is therefore an additional factor to take into account in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. E stands also for Economics to be considered in diabetes care. Attention should be paid to public health policies as well as to the physician faced with the dilemma of delivering the best possible care within the problem of limited resources. The financial impact of the new treatment modalities for diabetes represents an issue that needs to be addressed at multiple strata both globally and nationally. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, assessing the role of empowerment is dependent on effective measures of empowerment. Although many measures of empowerment exist, no measure has been developed specifically for patients with long-term conditions in the primary care setting. This study presents preliminary data on the development and validation of such a measure. Methods We conducted two empirical studies. Study one was an interview study to understand empowerment from the perspective of patients living with long-term conditions. Qualitative analysis identified dimensions of empowerment, and the qualitative data were used to generate items relating to these dimensions. Study two was a cross-sectional postal study involving patients with different types of long-term conditions recruited from general practices. The survey was conducted to test and validate our new measure of empowerment. Factor analysis and regression were performed to test scale structure, internal consistency and construct validity. Results Sixteen predominately elderly patients with different types of long-term conditions described empowerment in terms of 5 dimensions (identity, knowledge and understanding, personal control, personal decision-making, and enabling other patients). One hundred and ninety seven survey responses were received from mainly older white females, with relatively low levels of formal education, with the majority retired from paid work. Almost half of the sample reported cardiovascular, joint or diabetes long-term conditions. Factor analysis identified a three factor solution (positive attitude and sense of control, knowledge and confidence in decision making and enabling others), although the structure lacked clarity. A total empowerment score across all items showed acceptable levels of internal\n\nEmpowerment of patients in online discussions about medicine use.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Berkel, Jasper J; Lambooij, Mattijs S; Hegger, Ingrid\n\n2015-04-08\n\nPatient empowerment is crucial in the successful self-management of people with chronic diseases. In this study, we investigated whether discussions about medicine use taking place on online message boards contribute to patient empowerment and could subsequently result in the more effective use of medicines. We discuss the extent to which patient empowerment processes occur in discussions on online message boards, focusing on patients with three disorders with different characteristics: diabetes, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Because information is an important factor in both patient empowerment and self-management, we also evaluate the quality of the information being exchanged. We used a deductive thematic analysis method based on pre-existing categories. We gathered and analysed 5532 posts related to the conditions ADHD, ALS and diabetes from seven message boards (three for ADHD, three for diabetes, and one for ALS). We coded the posts for empowerment processes and the quality of the information exchanged. We identified patient empowerment processes in posts related to all three disorders. There is some variation in the frequency of these processes, but they show a similar order in the results: patients used the online message boards to exchange information, share personal experiences and for empathy or support. The type of information shared in these processes could contribute to the patient's self-efficacy when it comes to medicine use. The exchanged information was either correct or largely harmless. We also observed a tendency whereby participants correct previously posted incorrect information, and refer people to a healthcare professional following a request for medical advice, e.g. concerning the choice of medicines or dosage. Our findings show that patient empowerment processes occur in posts related to all three disorders. The type of information shared in these processes can contribute to the\n\nMeasurement invariance of the Short Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale and of the Health Empowerment Scale in German and French women.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetrocchi, Serena; Labrie, Nanon H M; Schulz, Peter J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nMeasurement invariance is a crucial prerequisite to carry out cross-cultural research and to provide knowledge that enables culturally diverse patients to feel comfortable with their health providers. Although trust in doctors and health empowerment are widely studied, no previous research has examined their measurement invariance.

Community empowerment has increasingly gained recognition as a key approach for addressing HIV in sex workers, with its focus on addressing the broad context within which the heightened risk for infection takes places in these individuals. However, large-scale implementation of community empowerment-based approaches has been scarce. We undertook a comprehensive review of community empowerment approaches for addressing HIV in sex workers. Within this effort, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of community empowerment in sex workers in low-income and middle-income countries. We found that community empowerment-based approaches to addressing HIV among sex workers were significantly associated with reductions in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and with increases in consistent condom use with all clients. Despite the promise of a community-empowerment approach, we identified formidable structural barriers to implementation and scale-up at various levels. These barriers include regressive international discourses and funding constraints; national laws criminalising sex work; and intersecting social stigmas, discrimination, and violence. The evidence base for community empowerment in sex workers needs to be strengthened and diversified, including its role in aiding access to, and uptake of, combination interventions for HIV prevention. Furthermore, social and political change are needed regarding the recognition of sex work as work, both globally and locally, to encourage increased support for community empowerment responses to HIV.

Also, among studies supporting the favorable effects of DSME on mental HRQoL, the direct effect of DSME that is independent of improved glycemic control has never been investigated. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of community-based DSME intervention targeting empowerment on mental HRQoL and to determine whether the effect is direct or mediated by glycemic control. We conducted secondary analyses of data from the Diabetes Self-Care Study, a randomized controlled trial of a community-based DSME intervention. Study participants (nâ=â516) were African Americans and Latinos 55 years or older with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1cââ¥â8.0%) recruited from senior centers and churches in Los Angeles. The intervention group received six weekly small-group self-care sessions based on the empowerment model. The control group received six lectures on unrelated geriatrics topics. The primary outcome variable in this secondary analysis was the change in Mental Component Summary score (MCS-12) from the SF-12 Health Survey between baseline and six-month follow-up. We used the change in HbA1c during the study period as the main mediator of interest in our causal mediation analysis. Additionally, possible mediations via social support and perceived empowerment attributable to the program were examined. MCS-12 increased by 1.4 points on average in the intervention group and decreased by 0.2 points in the control group (difference-in-change: 1.6 points, 95% CI: 0.1 to 3.2). In the causal mediation analysis, the intervention had a direct effect on MCS-12 improvement (1.7 points, 95% CI: 0.2 to 3.2) with no indirect effects mediated via HbA1c change (-0.1 points, 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.1), social support (0.1 points), and perception of empowerment (0.1 points\n\n[Development and evaluation of the reliability and validity of an empowerment scale for health promotion volunteers].\n\nPubMed\n\nKoyama, Utako; Murayama, Nobuko\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThis qualitative and quantitative research was conducted to develop an empowerment scale for health promotion volunteers (hereinafter referred to as the ESFHPV), key persons responsible for creating healthy communities. A focus group interview was conducted with four groups of health promotion volunteers from two cities in S Public Health Center of N Prefecture. A qualitative analysis was employed and a 32-item draft scale was created. The reliability and validity of this scale were then evaluated using quantitative methods. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 2009 for all 660 health promotion volunteers across the 2 cities. Of 401 respondents (response rate, 60.8%), 356 (53.9%) provided valid responses and were thus included in the analysis. 1) Internal consistency was confirmed by item-total correlation analysis (I-T analysis), assessment of Cronbach's coefficient alpha for all except one item and good-poor analysis (G-P analysis). Four items were excluded from the 32-item draft scale because of correlation coefficients more than 0.7, leaving 28 items for analysis. 2) Based on the results obtained from the factor analysis performed on the 28 provisional empowerment questions, 28 items were chosen for inclusion in the ESFHPV. These items consisted of four sub-scales, namely 'activity for healthy community' (10 items), 'intention for solving health problems of the community' (10 items), 'democratic organization activity' (four items) and 'growth as individual health promotion volunteers' (four items). 3) The Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the ESFHPV and its four sub-scales were 0.93, 0.88, 0.89, 0.84 and 0.79 respectively. The coefficients of I-T analysis were between 0.33 and 0.69. 4) The health promotion volunteers who attended other community activities demonstrated significantly high scores for the ESFHPV and the four sub-scales. Persons who were above 60 years, had a longer duration of activity as a health promotion volunteer and were housewives showed\n\nPsychometric evaluation of the Chinese version of the Patient Perceptions of Empowerment Scale (PPES).\n\nPubMed\n\nYeh, Mei-Yu; Lin, Sieh-Hwa; Tung, Tao-Hsin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Patient Perceptions of Empowerment Scale (PPES) and to perform a cross-cultural validity assessment. In this cross-sectional survey, 554 inpatients in three general hospitals in northern Taiwan were recruited. Principal component analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the scale. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the measurement model of the Chinese version of the PPES. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the presence of a second-order four-factor model (information, decision, individual, and self-management) of the Chinese version of the PPES when used with a Taiwanese inpatient population. The results indicate that the 11-item, second-order, four-factor Chinese version of the PPES provided best goodness-of-fit for the data in this study. The 11-item four-factor Chinese version of the PPES is a self-completion scale. This study demonstrated that the Chinese version of the PPES is a reliable and valid self-report instrument for the assessment of patient perceptions of empowerment in clinical practice. Further adaptation and evaluation of the scale will hopefully stimulate further studies on PPES in the fields of psychometrics in Taiwan.\n\nNurses' Empowerment Scale for ICU patients' families: an instrument development study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Hong; Liu, Ya-Lan; Qiu, Li; Chen, Qiao-Ling; Wu, Jing-Bing; Chen, Li-Li; Li, Na\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFamily members provide essential support for ICU patients, contributing to their mental and physical recovery. Empowering ICU patients' families may help them overcome inadequacies and meet their own and patients' acknowledged needs. Nursing should understand and address patients' families' empowerment status. To develop a tool, the Nurses' Empowerment Scale for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients' Families (NESIPF), to help ICU nursing staff assess the empowerment status of patients' families. Four-phase instrument development study. A 19-item instrument was initially generated based on literature review and interviews with family members of ICU patients. The Delphi research method was applied to gain expert opinion and consensus via rounds of questionnaires. A panel of 27 experts experienced in critical care medicine, nursing and psychology participated in two Delphi rounds and their input helped formulate an 18-item pretest instrument. Families of 20 patients were recruited to examine instrument readability. After a 2-week interval, another 20 patients' families were recruited to examine test-retest reliability. Two hundred questionnaires were then administered and analysed to examine the instrument's construct validity, criterion-related validity and internal consistency. Expert authority coefficients of two Delphi rounds reached 0Â·89 and 0Â·91. Kendall' W coefficients of 0Â·113 (P < 0Â·001) in round 1 and 0Â·220 (P < 0Â·001) in round 2 indicated slight to fair agreement among experts. Content validity index (CVI) reached 1Â·0 for 12 items; the CVI for item 13 was <0Â·7 so it was excluded. Cronbach's Î± coefficient was 0Â·92, indicating acceptable internal consistency reliability. The coefficient of internal consistency of each dimension was 0Â·717-0Â·921. The Pearson correlation coefficient >0Â·9 (P < 0Â·05) showed an acceptable test-retest reliability. The instrument has acceptable reliability and validity and can assess the empowerment status of families of\n\nDiabetes Empowerment Council: Integrative Pilot Intervention for Transitioning Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeigensberg, Marc J; Vigen, Cheryl; Sequeira, Paola; Spruijt-Metz, Donna; Juarez, Magaly; Florindez, Daniella; Provisor, Joseph; Peters, Anne; Pyatak, Elizabeth A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe transition of young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from pediatric to adult care is challenging and frequently accompanied by worsening of diabetes-related health. To date, there are no reports which prospectively assess the effects of theory-based psycho-behavioral interventions during the transition period neither on glycemic control nor on psychosocial factors that contribute to poor glycemic control. Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to develop and pilot test an integrative group intervention based on the underlying principles of self-determination theory (SDT), in young adults with T1D. Fifty-one young adults with T1D participated in an education and case management-based transition program, of which 9 took part in the Diabetes Empowerment Council (DEC), a 12-week holistic, multimodality facilitated group intervention consisting of \"council\" process based on indigenous community practices, stress-reduction guided imagery, narrative medicine modalities, simple ritual, and other integrative modalities. Feasibility, acceptability, potential mechanism of effects, and bio-behavioral outcomes were determined using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods. The intervention was highly acceptable to participants, though presented significant feasibility challenges. Participants in DEC showed significant reductions in perceived stress and depression, and increases in general well-being relative to other control participants. Reduction in perceived stress, independent of intervention group, was associated with reductions in hemoglobin A1C. A theoretical model explaining the effects of the intervention included the promotion of relatedness and autonomy support, 2 important aspects of SDT. The DEC is a promising group intervention for young adults with T1D going through transition to adult care. Future investigations will be necessary to resolve feasibility issues, optimize the multimodality intervention, determine full intervention effects, and fully\n\nAssociations of changes in psychosocial factors and their interactions with diabetes distress in patients with type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Ruey-Hsia; Hsu, Hui-Chun; Kao, Chia-Chan; Yang, Yung-Mei; Lee, Yau-Jiunn; Shin, Shyi-Jang\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo assess the associations of changes in self-management behaviours, diabetes self-efficacy, resilience, social support, patient empowerment and their interactions with changes in diabetes distress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience diabetes distress. Few longitudinal studies have investigated the associations of changes in various psychosocial factors with changes in diabetes distress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study adopted a longitudinal design. Data were collected at baseline and 12Â months later. Overall, 304 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from four hospitals in southern Taiwan by convenience sampling. A self-report questionnaire and medical record were used to collect demographic data, clinical indicators, self-management behaviours, diabetes self-efficacy, resilience, social support, patient empowerment, and diabetes distress. Data were collected from February 2014-March 2015. An increase in resilience or diabetes self-efficacy significantly associated with a decrease in diabetes distress, whereas an increase in patient empowerment significantly associated with an increase in diabetes distress. The interactions between increase in patient empowerment and increase in self-management behaviours significantly associated with decrease in diabetes distress. Nurses could endeavour to improve the diabetes self-efficacy and resilience to reducing diabetes distress. Arbitrarily empowering patients may increase diabetes distress. Increasing self-care management behaviours and patient empowerment might need to be simultaneously addressed to reduce the diabetes distress in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, the ability to measure empowerment accurately across all levels of care staff is necessary. The objective of this study was to examine the structure of responses by registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and care aides to 3 instruments measuring workplace empowerment: the Conditions of Work Effectiveness Questionnaire, Job Activities Scale, and Organizational Relationships Scale. Despite considerable differences in education and job function, both caregiver groups appear to interpret and respond to 38 of 40 empowerment items in a similar manner. Therefore, our findings support the inclusion of all care staff when using these instruments to measure work place empowerment in LTC settings. Copyright Â© 2011 Mosby, Inc.
