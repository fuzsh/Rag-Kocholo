        "text": "TATAWO [Half a star]\n\nTHERE are beautiful bodies and ornate tattoos aplenty in this baffling Spanish film, but plotting is obviously a nebulous concept to writer-director Jo Sol.\n\nIt’s tempting to blame the indecipherable story line on inept subtitling, but unfortunately the tangle of characters, action and motives appears to be inherent.\n\n“Tatawo” means “Tattoo Bar,” and in the window of this establishment a hippie named Simona (Mercedes Ortega) poses and preens nude, showing off her many tattoos.\n\nShe’s in love with Francis (Miguel Molina) – who’s sometimes called Frenchie. The bar’s ex-con owner, Mariel (Alexis Valdes) – who’s sometimes called the Cuban – is in love with her.\n\nThat seems to be about it, although other people – a shadowy character called Enrique (Carlos Lasarte) and Mariel’s wife, Bug (Paulina Galvez) – also mill about the tattoo bar doing something or other.\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles. Running time: 90 minutes. Not rated (sex, nudity, drug use). At the Quad, 13th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues."
