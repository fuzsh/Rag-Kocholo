        "text": "BILLIARDS—HAROLD WORST, 36, a cue manufacturer from Grand Rapids, won the all-round title at the $30,000 Las Vegas Open plus $4,350 in prize money. Worst also took the one-pocket division of the tournament. IRVING CRANE, one of the game's perennial winners, gained the straight pool title, and newcomer ED KELLY JR. of Baltimore won the nine-ball championship.\n\nBOXING—Unbeaten NINO BENVENUTI, 27, of Trieste, a 1960 Olympic gold medalist, won the world junior middleweight title by knocking out Champion Sandro Mazzinghi, 26, with a right uppercut in the sixth round of a scheduled 15-round match in Milan. It was the 57th straight victory for Benvenuti, who now wants a match with Middle-weight Champion Joey Giardello of Philadelphia.\n\nThe world lightweight champion, ISMAEL LAGUNA of Panama, gained an eight-round TKO over Raul Soriano of Mexico in a scheduled 10-round non-title bout in Panama. In another non-title fight, in Honolulu, Welterweight Champion EMILE GRIFFITH earned a unanimous 10-round decision over Eddie Pace of Los Angeles.\n\nCREW—The NAVY varsity eight-oared shell defeated favored Cornell by less than a length in the IRA championship on Lake Onondaga in Syracuse, N.Y., rowing the three-mile distance in 16:51.3 (pane 34). Washington finished third, one and a half lengths back. Navy junior varsity and freshman shells also won their events, for the first sweep of all three IRA titles in seven years.\n\nIn the nation's oldest and longest race—the Harvard-Yale 100-year rivalry over a four-mile course along the Thames (Conn.) River—HARVARD'S eight-oared crew (page 36) romped to a whopping 10½-length victory over Yale in 19:41.6.\n\nGOLF—GARY PLAYER of South Africa shot a 71 in the 18-hole playoff of the U.S. Open in St. Louis to defeat Australia's Kel Nagle by three strokes after the two had tied at 282 in the regulation four rounds (page 24).\n\nHARNESS RACING—Ralph Baldwin guided DARTMOUTH ($4.70), a 4-year-old trotter owned by Castleton Farms's Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Van Lennep, to victory by a neck over Dashing Rodney in the $100,195.75 Realization Trot at Roosevelt Raceway. In winning, Dartmouth gained the Founder's Plate—a $35,000 bonus for a Standardbred who wins the major race at Roosevelt for 2-(Westbury Futurity), 3-(Dexter Cup) and 4-year-olds in consecutive seasons.\n\nRichard Downing's BRET HANOVER ($2.60), driven by Frank Ervin, won the $17,400 Hanover-Hempt mile pace in Washington, Pa, in the record time of 1:57 2/5 to remain unbeaten in 29 consecutive starts—the longest winning streak in the modern history of pacing. The 3-year-old colt's fifth victory of the season was by three-quarters of a length over Bullet Van.\n\nHORSE RACING—HYERES III, a 7-year-old French horse ridden by Jean Daumas, won the four-mile, $64,000 Grand Steeplechase of Paris for the second year in a row, finishing 1½ lengths ahead of another French entry, Yasco. Jay Trump, Mrs. Mary Stephenson's American hunter who won England's Grand National in March, was a tired third, 2½ lengths behind the winner.\n\nArgentine-bred TRONADO ($19.40), ridden by Jockey Joe Baze and carrying a lightweight 113 pounds, upset three of the nation's top handicap horses in the $54,800 Inglewood Handicap at Hollywood Park with a victory by a neck over Hill Rise. Viking Spirit, who finished another neck behind in third, was disqualified for interference, and favorite Quadrangle, two lengths back, gained the show spot.\n\nMrs. Ada L. Rice's 4-year-old colt PIA STAR ($8) won the $46,750 Equipoise Mile at Arlington Park, finishing five lengths ahead of Quita Dude. Ridden by Johnny Sellers, Pia Star equaled the world record for a mile set by Swaps at Hollywood Park in 1956 with a 1:33[1/5] clocking.\n\nMOTOR SPORTS—Ferraris swept the first three places in the 24-hour Le Mans endurance race, as American expatriate MASTEN GREGORY, formerly of Kansas City, won in a Ferrari entered by New York distributor Luigi Chinetti (page 32). It marked the sixth year in a row that a Ferrari has won. Gregory and co-driver Jochen Rindt of Austria covered 2,906.2 miles over the twisting 8.36-mile circuit set in French farm country to finish six laps ahead of Pierre Dumay and Taf Gosselin of Belgium. Willy Mairesse of Belgium and Jean Beurlys of France came in third, while none of the six factory-Ford entries completed the race.\n\nSWIMMING—FRANK WIEGAND of East Germany, the Olympic 400-meter freestyle silver medalist, shaved 1.2 seconds from the 220-yard freestyle world record with a clocking of 1:59.9 in Frankfurt.\n\nTENNIS—ARTHUR ASHE of UCLA, the third-ranked U.S. player, trounced Mike Belkin of the University of Miami 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 to win the NCAA singles championship in Los Angeles. Ashe and Ian Crookenden, paired against another UCLA team of Dave Reed and Dave Sanderlin, won the doubles title 8-6, 7-5, 6-3 to give UCLA the NCAA team championship—31 points to Miami's 13.\n\nRoy Emerson of Australia was awarded the men's singles trophy of the London Grass Court championships by default when Dennis Ralston, the No. 1 ranked U.S. player, injured his thumb during a spill in the semifinal doubles match and was forced out of the singles final. ANNETTE VAN ZYL of South Africa defeated England's Christine Truman 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to take the women's title.\n\nTRACK & FIELD—JIM RYUN of Wichita, Kans. set two meet records in the schoolboy Golden West meet in Sacramento with clockings of 4:04.3 for the mile and 9:04 for the two-mile (page 56). Other double winners were BOB HAWKE of Butte, Mont. in the shotput (61 feet 7¼ inches) and discus (187 feet 11 inches) and RALPH WISE of Pasadena, Calif. in the 100-yard (9.5) and 220-yard (22.3) dashes, although a recheck showed that the 220 was actually 230 yards in distance. BOB BEAMON of Jamaica, N.Y. hurtled 50 feet 3¼ inches in the hop-step-and-jump with the aid of a favoring wind to top his own national interscholastic record by 9¼ inches. Other meet records were set by RON FREEMAN of Elizabeth. N.J. in the 440 (46.8). ERIC KLEIN of Seattle in the broad jump (24 feet 10½ inches) and BOB STEINHOFF of Downey, Calif. in the pole vault (15 feet 6 inches).\n\nSouthern California and Oregon, each winners of two NCAA team titles in the past four years, collected 32 points apiece in the NCAA championships in Berkeley, Calif. to split the title. It marked the first tie in the meet's 44-year history. DOUG BROWN, a 5-foot-6 distance runner from Montana, set collegiate and meet records with a 27:59.2 in the six-mile run, finishing 210 yards ahead of runner-up Chris Westman of Washington Stale. Brown also set the only other meet record with a 13:40.2 in the three-mile run, beating John Lawson of Kansas by inches. CLARENCE ROBINSON of New Mexico, the meet's other double winner, leaped 25 feet 10½ inches in the broad jump, and 50 feet 2 inches in the hop-step-and-jump. BOB DAY of UCLA, who a week earlier had run a mile in 3:56.4, won the event in a relatively slow 4:01.8 after a sizzling early pace (55.3 at the quarter and 1:53.4 at the half) and TOM FARRELL of St. John's University took the 880 (1:48.1) by five yards over Villanova's Noel Carroll. EARL HORNER of Villanova won the 220 with a 21.1 in a photo finish with Edwin Roberts of North Carolina College, the Olympic bronze medalist, and CHARLIE GREENE of Nebraska took the 100-yard dash in 9.4.\n\nAustralia's RON CLARKE lowered his own world record in the 10,000-meter run by 1.6 seconds with a 28:14.0 in Turku, Finland and HAROLD CONNOLLY of Santa Monica, Calif. raised his own world mark in the hammer throw by 7½ inches with a heave of 233 feet 9½ inches in Walnut, Calif.\n\nJim Grelle of Portland, Ore. upset New Zealand's Peter Snell in a heralded \"Miracle Mile\" at the Vancouver, B.C. international meet and won in 3:55.4, the fastest mile ever run by an American. Snell finished 10th and last, apparently troubled by a stomach ailment.\n\nMILEPOSTS—PROMOTED: LOU KLEIN, 46, from batting coach to head coach of the eighth-place Chicago Cubs. Klein replaces BOB KENNEDY, 44, the head coach for the past two seasons (record: 182 wins, 198 losses) under the Cub's rotating coaching system.\n\nSIGNED: For $104,000 by the Kansas City Athletics, Outfielder RICK MONDAY, the first choice in the major league's free-agent draft. MONDAY, who hit .359 for NCAA champion Arizona State, was assigned to the Athletics' Lewiston, Idaho farm team in the Class A Northwest League.\n\nRESIGNED: BOB BOYD, 35, the highly successful basketball coach at Seattle University the past two seasons (22-6, 19-7), to go into business. Freshman Coach Lionel Purcell will succeed him."
