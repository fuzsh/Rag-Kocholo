This founding history, together with a long and complex history of sociological involvement in\n\npublic intellectual life, as well as traditions of engaged scholarship in this country, form the backdrop against which this resolution was adopted.\n\nAt the July 2013 Annual General Meeting of SASA, it was agreed that the incoming SASA Council should communicate the content of the\n\nresolution to the SASA membership. The resolution signals SASA’s recognition of the risk posed by Israel’s occupation of Palestinian\n\nterritories, and the devastating social consequences thereof. It also gives central recognition to the position of intellectuals and academic\n\ninstitutions in the struggle for social justice.\n\nAt a moment when we are confronted by immense social challenges – at a local, regional and global level – the resolution on Israel has\n\nre-opened many questions about the role and significance of SASA, and sociological scholarship more generally, in critique and progressive\n\nsocial change. These questions, and the debates they inspire will no doubt continue to energise and enliven SASA as a community of\n\nengaged sociologists.\n\nA statement issued by SASA Council on a resolution regarding scholars from Israel adopted at the Annual General Meeting of the\n\nSouth African Sociological Association on July 3rd 2012.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSASA AGM approves new Constitution - posted on 9 July 2013\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe 2013 Annual General Meeting of the South African Sociological Association has approved\n\nammendments to the SASA Constitution, including an addition to the preamble and a change of\n\nmain method of communication to that of the SASA mailing list. The new Constitution can be\n\naccessed under the 'About Us' tab of this website.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nLetter: Restructuring the ISA - posted on 9 July 2013\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRESTRUCTURING THE ISA - OPEN LETTER TO THE ISA MEMBERSHIP Dear Member: In a few days the representatives of the Research Committees and National Associations (in good standing) will be asked to vote on organizational changes in the ISA that have been proposed by the ISA Executive Committee. The proposed changes involve the re-composition of the program committee for World Congresses that will give wider representation to Research Committees and National Associations and enable future ISA Presidents to play a more direct role in shaping World Congress programs. If the proposals pass then they will take effect at the 2014 World Congress in Yokohama. The details of the changes can be found at http://www.isa-sociology.org/restructuring-of-the-isa/ [1]. There you will also find the rationales for and against the changes as well as the modification in the ISA Statutes and By-laws that the changes will require. All 4 documents can be found in the three official languages of the ISA, but the English version will govern in case of ambiguity. We encourage you to read the materials and post your comments and suggestions on the blog and if you have questions I and others will try to answer them. Don't hesitate to get in touch with your representatives to express your views! All changes in ISA Statutes and By-laws have to be approved by the Assembly of Councils, which is composed of the representatives of the Research Committees and National Associations (in good standing). They will have 90 days to register their vote. Best wishes for an engaging and open discussion. Yours sincerely, Michael Burawoy ISA President\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPetition: Defend Democracy in SASA - posted on 20 June 2013\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear SASA member\n\nDefend Democracy in SASA\n\nAt the 2012 SASA conference, held at UCT, a presenter from an Israeli university built on occupied Palestinian territory contemptuously rejected requests that he distance himself from his government’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land. In response, every sociologist in the room walked out, and held the session elsewhere. Subsequently, the following resolution was put to SASA’s governing body, its Annual General Meeting (AGM):\n\nAny academic from an Israeli institution who wishes to be invited to present a paper at a SASA conference must first indicate his/her opposition to Israeli rule in the occupied territories.\n\nThis resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority, with about a quarter of the meeting abstaining and fewer than ten people voting against. Despite this overwhelming adoption of the resolution, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (Cape Town) exerted pressure on the SASA Council through a complaint about the specific incident and the subsequent resolution. This resulted in the Council revisiting the resolution, culminating - despite reported differences amongst Council members - in a decision of Council that the resolution was unconstitutional. The Council offered two reasons.\n\nFirst, it said that motions had to be tabled 24 hours before the AGM, which had not occurred. But, technically, this was not a motion, it was a resolution (which had been brought to the AGM immediately after the incident). From the constitution, it is clear that 24 hours notice is not required. Clause 7(c) states:\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, a majority of the voting members present may: i) place items on the agenda of that Meeting; (ii) pass resolutions binding on the Council …\n\nThe second argument was that some of the people who voted were not members. While indeed it is necessary for the Council to ensure that only paid-up members participate in the voting process, in the last decade this requirement has never been strictly adhered to. This therefore cannot be a basis on which to nullify the resolution. The danger here is that if the resolution is unconstitutional on these grounds, then the election of Council would be as well, and all decisions of Council since then would be nullified. This would retrospectively also apply to any previous Councils and AGMs where this was the case. This is therefore a potentially very damaging argument for the organisational integrity of SASA. Had the President genuinely believed that he erred in allowing the AGM to consider the resolution, the proper recourse would have been to resign. Alternatively, the Council could have taken the view that, since a substantial majority of members backed the resolution, it would accept the decision as binding.\n\nIn practice, the Council overturned a resolution that was democratically adopted by the AGM. This poses a threat to SASA’s internal democracy as well as SASA’s role in broader societal affairs. We call on all SASA members to support this petition for the reinstatement and immediate implementation of the resolution. We also request that you support the call for the following motion, headed ‘Defence of Democracy in SASA’, to be the first item on the agenda of the forthcoming AGM of the South African Sociological Association.\n\nThis Annual General Meeting, being the final decision making body of SASA:\n\n1. Notes that the following resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority at the 2012 AGM: ‘Any academic from an Israeli institution who wishes to be invited to present a paper at a SASA conference must first indicate his/her opposition to Israeli rule in the occupied territories.’\n\n2. Expresses its disapproval of the SASA Council’s decision to repudiate this resolution.\n\n3. Re-affirms the resolution as the democratic decision of the AGM of SASA.\n\n4. Reiterates that the resolution is binding on the Council in accordance with Article 7(c)(ii) of the SASA Constitution.\n\nIf you support this petition and motion, please send an email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Include your name, institutional affiliation, and any other SASA-relevant information.\n\nWe hope you will support this cause.

Retha Gaigher's work centred on issues such as health literacy and children with albinism. Her son, who asked that fellow sociologists be informed of her death, noted that while she shunned recognition, she was a formidable writer. She was also involved in the Tswelopele Day Care Centre in Indermark, Limpopo, which aimed to help meet the great need for early childhood development services in a community where the unemployment rate is high and most of the employed men work in cities several hundred kilometers away. Together with her husband, Ian, she ran the Lajuma Research Centre, which hosted postgraduate students and volunteers who worked with the centre to build a database of the biodiversity and ecology of the northernmost parts of South Africa. Retha will be sorely missed by loved ones.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCall to social scientists to sign Marikana statement - posted on 21 September 2012\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTo all social scientists in South Africa:\n\nThis link takes you to a statement on the Marikana Massacre: http://marikanastatement.blogspot.com/\n\nWe invite all social scientists in South Africa, including doctoral students and associated scholars, to add their name to the list of statement supporters.\n\nThis a matter of urgent concern and we will close the list on Friday 21 September, after which we will publish the statement and list of signatories.\n\nPlease forward this email to other South African social scientists.\n\nA list of initial signatories appears below, and further down you will find the text of the statement.\n\nBest regards,\n\nProf. Edward Webster (Wits)\n\nProf. Peter Alexander (UJ).\n\nInitial signatories\n\nProf. Freek Cronje, Northwest University, President: South African Sociological Association\n\nProf. Eddie Webster, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Jacklyn Cock, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Peter Alexander, University of Johannesburg\n\nProf. Shireen Hassim, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Norman Duncan, University of Pretoria, Dean: Faculty of Humanities\n\nDr. Kelly Gillespie, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Ari Sitas, University of Cape Town\n\nProf. Noor Nieftergodien, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Maxi Schoeman, University of Pretoria\n\nProf. Jimi Adesina, University of the Western Cape\n\nProf. Francis Nyamjoh, Univeristy of Cape Town\n\nProf. Michael Burawoy, University of the Witwatersrand, President: International Sociological Association\n\nProf. Tina Uys, University of Johannesburg, Vice President: International Sociological Association\n\nProf. Henning Melber, University of Pretoria\n\nDr Nolwazi Mkhwanazi, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Peter Vale, University of Johannesburg\n\nProf. Roger Southall, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nProf. Jane Duncan, Rhodes University\n\nProf. Dirk Kotze, UNISA\n\nProf. Andries Bezuidenhout, University of Pretoria\n\nSalim Vally, University of Johannesburg\n\nProf. Lawrence Hamilton, University of Johannesburg\n\nProf. John Daniel, School of International Training, Durban\n\nDr Hylton White, University of the Witwatersrand.\n\nMarikana: Statement by South African Social Scientists\n\nAs social scientists we share with the public of South Africa the sense of shock and outrage that followed the recent massacre at Marikana. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those who died.\n\nAs social scientists we also respond to what has happened in a particular way. Our disciplines avoid episodic description and uncritical acceptance of official statements. Through our research and teaching, we aim to contribute to an examination of social structures, social processes and social context, making sense of these historically and with awareness that they have political significance. Our research aims to reveal phenomena that are hidden, rather than rely on reports of what is immediately visible.\n\nOur analyses are leading us to a recognition of continuities from our apartheid past, with these exposed through events at Marikana. These include:\n\n• massive inequalities that impact adversely on all aspects of the social life of people who are poorer;\n\n• widespread prevalence of low wages (with the persistence of migrant labour and the expansion of outsourcing, subcontracting and informal employment, all of which exacerbate pre-existing problems);\n\n• increased levels of unemployment, especially among young people;\n\n• a system of production based on private profit at the expense of people’s needs;\n\n• domination of the economy by the mining industry, and, with this, repatriation of profits by foreign investors;\n\n• racism that is structural as well as interpersonal;\n\n• growing violence, including hidden violence associated with poverty;\n\n• the prevalence of shacks and other low-cost housing, generally accompanied by the poor provision of basic services; and\n\n• highly repressive forms of public order policing and administration (including the use of the doctrine of common purpose).\n\nPopular perceptions of the Lonmin Marikana mine massacre were initially shaped by TV footage of a single part of the massacre, viewed from the standpoint of the police. This account was reinforced by media briefings, prejudiced reporting, and opinions that blamed the violence on inter-union rivalries. Social scientific research giving weight to accounts by workers has emphasised the culpability of the police, flawed and biased official versions of events, sympathetic treatment of popular culture, and the unity of workers around a demand for a living wage.\n\nMoreover, as social scientists we have a normative concern with defending truth, justice and democracy. And from this stance, we join others in civil society, in calling for:\n\n• condemnation of the killing of strikers by the police, and the threat to the right to strike that this implies;\n\n• recognition of the complicity of Lonmin, which has responded to workers with intransigence and insensitivity;\n\n• appreciation that the gross inequality of rewards that exists at Lonmin, as elsewhere in mining and beyond, is indefensible;\n\n• support for the legitimate demands of workers for substantially improved pay;\n\n• a welcoming of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry and the investigation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID);\n\n• consideration of demands by civil society organisations for expansion of its terms of reference of the Commission of Enquiry;\n\n• full and sympathetic consideration of evidence by Lonmin strikers and community members in the areas around Marikana;\n\n• determination of who authorised the use of live ammunition at Marikana;\n\n• an IPID-led inquest or investigation into each individual death;\n\n• careful monitoring of the Commission of Enquiry by independent civil society researchers;\n\n• criminal charges to be brought against any police officer who terminated or endangered the lives of civilians by ordering or implementing orders to use live ammunition, or who tortured protesters while they were held in custody;\n\n• disbanding the task forces that carried out the massacre;\n\n• suspending those responsible for mismanagement of the processing of the crime scene;\n\n• dismissal of the Acting Director of the National Prosecuting Authority, who accepted the use of ‘common purpose’ in charging all those arrested with murder;\n\n• dismissal of those who authorised a violent assault on the mine workers;\n\n• the unfettered right of workers to belong to a union of their choice, combined with the promotion of strong, democratic unions; and\n\n• immediate lump-sum payments and ongoing support to the families of miners and others killed at Marikana, and full compensation for those who were injured.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAcademic positions at the University of the Witwatersrand - posted on 23 June 2012\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWITS UNIVERSITY\n\nSOCIOLOGY\n\nLECTURER, SENIOR LECTURER/\n\nThe Department of Sociology in the School of Social Sciences enjoys an international reputation for outstanding teaching, research and public engagement, particularly in the fields of economic and industrial sociology, development sociology and health sociology.
