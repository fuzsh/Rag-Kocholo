They would also go on to lose the third-place play-off to Czechoslovakia.\n\nIt was a better story for Spain four years later who won the tournament at home, beating the holders Soviet Union 2-1 in the final. Similarly, Italy lifted the trophy in Rome in 1968 after a 2-0 win in a replay against Yugoslavia.\n\nThe 1972 tournament held in Belgium saw the hosts lose their semi-final to eventual winners West Germany before beating Hungary in the third-place play-off.\n\nFour years later, Yugoslavia were beaten in extra time by West Germany and Netherlands in both their semi-final and third-place play-off matches respectively.\n\nThe tournament expanded to eight teams featuring two groups of four in 1980 in Italy. Finishing second in their group, the hosts advanced to the third-place play-off where they were beaten on penalties by Czechoslovakia.\n\nMaking amends for 1960, France won the tournament as hosts in 1984, beating Spain 2-0 in the final.\n\nWest Germany hosted in 1988 and were beaten in the semi-final by rivals Netherlands who went on to lift the trophy – the third-place play-off had been abolished at the previous tournament.\n\nSweden made their tournament debut as hosts in 1992 but were beaten 3-2 by Germany in the semis as fellow Scandinavians Denmark shocked the world by winning the competition.\n\nFootball ‘came home’ to England in 1996 in the first 16-team edition, but the hosts were beaten on penalties by eventual winners Germany in the semis.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands were the first joint tournament hosts in 2000. The former crashed out in the group stages while the latter were beaten on penalties in the semi-finals by Italy.\n\nPortugal marched to the final on home soil four years later but were beaten by Greece in one of the competition's greatest ever upsets.\n\nAustria and Switzerland assumed joint-hosting duties in 2008 but neither team made it out of their first-round group.\n\nEuro 2020 had no set hosts with matches taking place across 11 countries in a one-of-a-kind tournament. The final took place at Wembley with England, in front of their own fans, one of the two protagonists. However, the Three Lions were beaten on penalties by Italy.\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer\n\nPremier League\n\n‘The toughest moment in my career’ – Maguire reflects on Euro 2024 agony\n\n26/07/2024 at 10:50"
