        "text": "The match between the Netherlands and Argentina was one of the most eagerly awaited in this category. Two historic teams in this discipline with a great track record: the Netherlands have been in the final of the Olympic Games consecutively since Athens 2004. They have won three golds and two silvers in five consecutive editions. On the other hand, Argentina also has a good number of medals, having won three beach medals and two bronze medals in its entire track record.\n\nThe match started evenly on both sides, having a first half where the score remained at zero. However, at the start of the second half, Luna Fokke opened the scoring in the 21st minute, after receiving a long ball over her head and beating Cristina Cosentina in the Argentine goal. Following this, Nunnink Laura scored in the 26th minute, making it even more difficult for the Argentine team.\n\nEven so, Argentina had their chances to come back in the second half, but Valentina Raposo was unfortunate in her penalty corner kicks, eight of them without finding the net. In this way the game for the Argentines became very complicated and after the third goal by Jansen Yibbi, finally sentenced the match.\n\nIn this way the European team managed to maintain its streak of consecutive finals and return to fight for the gold medal. This is the sixth consecutive match in which the Argentine team lost to the Dutch in the Olympic Games: semifinals in Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and Paris 2024, finals in London 2012 and Tokyo 2020, and quarterfinals in Rio 2016."
