She lit up the world with her smile and lit up the stage with her singing, dancing and acting.\n\nJulie Carr D’Agostino, 22, of Elmhurst, passed away on Friday, August 7, 2015, surrounded by her loving family and friends. She was the beloved daughter of Mario and Mary Carr D’Agostino; loving sister to Michael, Kevin, Elizabeth (fiancé Ryan Hogan), Carly, and twin sister Natalie; adored niece, cousin, and friend to many; loyal companion to her dogs Tino and Kiwi.\n\nDeemed “Warrior Princess,” Julie fought a brave and courageous battle to the end, always maintaining a positive attitude and never wanting to give up despite the overwhelming obstacles in her way, family members said. In her short life, Julie achieved a “Ph.D.” (Personally her Degree) in design, fashion, cooking, organizing, crafting and hosting. She will always be remembered for her strength, resilience, loyalty, love of Meryl Streep, fondness of shopping and all things pink. Heaven is likely a little pinker with her in it. Since Julie’s passing, there have been pink ribbons gracing numerous trees in south Elmhurst around the area of Visitation Church.\n\nAbout four years ago, the Independent brought you a story about Julie, her struggle to maintain her health and her double-lung transplant in October of 2011.\n\nBorn a twin on November 10, 1992, alongside her sister Natalie, Julie faced struggles healthy children never have to.\n\n“Natalie did everything. I’d get upset sometimes when I couldn’t do things,” said Julie. “I did have a few outbursts when I was younger, but nothing too much. And [as the sickness progressed], I was so oblivious and so sick, I don’t even remember anything.”\n\n“You’ve gotta understand,” said Julie’s father Mario. “She’s got a fantastic attitude.”\n\nPrior to her lung transplant, hundreds of faithful Visitation parishioners prayed many times as Julie’s body continued failing as she waited for lungs that would help her breathe on her own again.\n\nPrayers were answered on October 24, 2011, when Julie underwent a successful surgery that placed two healthy lungs inside her chest. Months prior to the surgery, Julie’s health had been rapidly declining due to complications from Cystic Fibrosis.\n\n“We have 16 steps in our house. Julie would come down the stairs once in the morning and not go back up until bedtime,” said Mary D’Agostino, Julie’s mother. “She could not go back up the stairs, she was not strong enough. We’d run up the stairs for her.”\n\nAfter the operation she could go up and down the stairs on her own with ease. Julie said her new lungs brought her so much more than just good breaths and the ability to eat her favorite foods or be more active.\n\nIt was such a story, her friend and neighbor Giancarlo Iannotta called it a miracle and he later directed and produced the movie, “Miracle on South Street: The Julie D Story.” There was hardly a dry eye in the house, when nearly 200 people of the Visitation community attended a viewing in the Valentino Center.\n\n“The whole experience brought so many people closer,” said Iannotta. “Her story touched so many people.”\n\n“Every year for my birthday I wished for a cure to CF,” Julie said. “When I was in the ICU, I didn’t care about the latest iPad or iPod. I know love is all you need – and your family. If you’re stripped of everything else, but have that – that’s all you need.”\n\nToo numerous to list, her family wishes to thank all of those who helped Julie on her journey, prayed for her strength and worked tirelessly to comfort her.\n\nFriends and family met for a Mass of Christian Burial Wednesday, August 12, 2015, at Visitation Catholic Church in Elmhurst. Interment Queen of Heaven Catholic Cemetery, Hillside.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Gift of Hope Organ & Tissue Donor Network, Attn: Gwendolyn Blakemore, 425 Spring Lake Drive, Itasca, 60143; or, Make a Wish America, 4742 N. 24th Street, Suite 400, Phoenix, AZ 85016-4862; or, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 6931 Arlington Road, 2nd floor, Bethesda, MD 20814.

Braunshausen Sr., formerly of Villa Park, passed away recently at the age of 89. He was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and served during WWII. Beloved husband of the late Alice J. Loving father of Richard W. Jr. (Valerie), Patricia (George) Mangriotis, John (Lucie), Robert (Paula), Christine Burger, Bonnie Lullo and Kenneth (Ric Mundell). Dear grandfather of 22; great-grandfather of 14. Fond brother of Walter (Eileen) and Charles (Denise). Uncle and great uncle of many.\n\nRichard (known in his younger years as “Dick”) lived a full life. He grew up in Maywood, one of three boys born to German immigrant parents. He joined the US Air Force shortly before his 18th birthday and completed training as a bombardier just as the war was ending. After traveling for his job, in 1950, he married the love of his life Alice Jean Mueller. They had seven children, eventually settling in Villa Park to raise them.\n\nWorking mostly in the automotive parts business, Richard owned a parts store for several years. He was very much a family man, spending all his spare time with his wife and children boating on Lake Geneva, creating wonderful memories, and vacationing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. His love of wooden boats was only surpassed by his love for his family. He suffered a devastating blow when his wife of 25 years passed in 1975. He continued on, doing his best to raise his remaining at-home children on his own. He was a caring and accepting man, involving his children in everything he did. He loved having a large family, seeing the grandkids, and being surrounded by them. It was comforting to him and you would often find him asleep amidst the chaos.\n\nAffectionately known by some as “Mr. B.,” he was well respected and loved by many. He passed peacefully, surrounded by his children, and will finally be reunited with his bride.\n\nFuneral service was held on Wednesday July 29, 2015, at the Steuerle Funeral Home, 350 S.

One of her favorite books she had her students read was Watership Down, which accounted for her collection of rabbit items.\n\nAfter retirement from York, and up until last year, she and her sister Doris would spend part of the winter in Casey Key, Florida, where family and friends would come to visit. This yearly adventure that was one of the highlights of her year.\n\nAnother of her greatest joys was her family. Margaret loved being around all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Christmas was always a very special time for her, especially when Debbie and her family would make the trek from Virginia and all the family was together.\n\nShe had a great sense of humor and was a great \"straight woman,\" setting up the punch lines for Andy and, later, her sons’ jokes.

She was 72.\n\nPat was born on January 15, 1943, in Chicago, the daughter of Columbo “Jack” and Helen Tenebrini. Pat spent her childhood growing up in Chicago and then Elmhurst with her two older sisters Mary Lou and Gloria and her younger brother Paul.\n\nAfter graduating from Immaculate Conception, Pat enrolled at Webster University near St. Louis before leaving school. She was married in June 1962 and had two daughters, Karyn and Bridgett. She resided in Elmhurst until 1978, when she moved to Chicago.\n\nPat had an encouraging word for everybody, a voracious appetite for books and movies, and accumulated wide-ranging knowledge that she generously shared with others. In particular, she developed a keen medical mind that made her a de facto aches-and-pains adviser to family and friends.\n\nIn addition, Pat was an enthusiastic champion of others—a trait that served her well in the 1970s and ‘80s as a representative for advertising photographers, artists and other creative talents. During that time, she met the love of her life and future husband, Bill Daniel, who went on to become an advertising agency owner.\n\nThey traveled extensively, and in style, to an assortment of international locales. Their vacations took them to spots like Mexico, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Italy. Without fail, they came back with stories of adventure (and hilarious misadventure) that underscored the fast friendships they easily formed on their journeys.\n\nDeeply intuitive, one time in the mid-1970s, Pat met a muscle-bound bouncer at a Chicago nightclub. After “reading” his palms, she assured him that he was bound for great fame. Within a few years, he was known globally as Mr. T.\n\nPat lived in Chicago from 1978 to 1994, then moved with Bill to Oak Park to be close to her two daughters and their families. For the next 11 years, Pat and Bill’s home on North Taylor Avenue was a frequent hub of social activity, from her daughter Bridgett’s backyard wedding to holiday, birthday and a variety of other celebrations.\n\nIn that time, Pat also delighted in being part of the early years of her four grandchildren, Natalie & Zane Lindeman, and Zach & Maggie Rose Baron.\n\nShe and Bill moved to Palm Springs in 2005, where they lived near her brother and his wife. Most recently, she hosted Thanksgiving for more than 25 family and friends visiting from near and far. In semi-retirement, Pat also worked as a production listings coordinator for “Below the Line,” a movie industry newsletter that serves as “the voice of the crew.”\n\nHer entertainment industry roots date back to the 1980s, when she began working primarily as a production coordinator on movies and television shows that filmed in Chicago. Her credits include “ER,” “Chicago Hope,” and “Fred Claus.” In that capacity, Pat was a beloved “mother hen” to the many men and women she worked alongside for more than 20 years.\n\nPat will be remembered in many ways but perhaps most by her hearty laugh, her ubiquitous reading glasses and her child-like zest for seeing the extraordinary beauty in what others would dismiss as the ordinary of life.\n\nPat was preceded in death by her parents; her sisters, Mary Lou Kubitz and Gloria Pekelsma; and her brother-in-law Al Kubitz.\n\nSurvivors include her husband Bill; her daughters Karyn (Les Lindeman) McCarthy and Bridgett (Matt) Baron; her adopted daughter Brittny; her brother Paul and his wife Nina Ushana; grandchildren Natalie, Zane, Zach and Maggie Rose; her former husband, Tim McCarthy; brother-in-law Glenn Pekelsma; nephews John (Darla Jo) Kubitz, Jim (Joy) Kubitz, Jeff (Robin) Pekelsma; nieces Susan Kubitz, Pam Ziarko, Chris (Tom) Hanchin and Jennifer (Steve) Kane; and many other relatives and friends.\n\nAt Pat’s request, there were no funeral services. Instead, and in keeping with her fun-loving spirit, she called for celebrations of her life. The first was held on April 4th in Palm Springs and another one is set for May 9th—the day before Mother’s Day—in Oak Park.\n\nFor more information, please visit celebratingpatty.com.

He earned a degree in electrical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., where he was a member of the basketball team and Sigma Nu Fraternity.\n\nDirectly after graduating from Rose-Hulman, Bill began a career at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago that would last 31 years. Bill married Judith Margaret Bradley on August 31, 1968, and soon after, earned an M.B.A. from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. The couple settled in Elmhurst, where they remained residents for 44 years. At Commonwealth Edison, Bill rose from engineer to executive management and continued his friendship with his “FOF” colleagues throughout his retirement.\n\nBill and Judy spent their retirement traveling, volunteering, and recently wintering in Sarasota, Florida. Bill was active in various volunteer activities and hobbies. He served as an Elder and board member of Redeemer Lutheran Church in Elmhurst. He was also on the board of Lutheran Child and Family Services and the Chicagoland Lutheran Education Foundation. As a member of the Fox Flying Club, he enjoyed flying single engine airplanes. Bill and Judy flew to numerous places, including Minnesota, Nova Scotia, New Orleans, Arizona, the Bahamas and around the island of Hawaii. Bill highly valued family vacations. His children fondly remember many trips across the country, often hearing Bill’s ham radio call sign from the passenger seat while he spoke to hams all over the world. During retirement he fulfilled his interest in genealogy, eventually going on vacation/research trips with Judy to Germany and Scandinavia, including the Valdres Valley, researching his Norwegian heritage.\n\nBill was predeceased by his parents. He is survived by wife Judy of 47 years, son Michael (fiancée Nancy Veltema) and daughter Elizabeth (Randall) Swartz, and numerous cousins and friends in Illinois and Florida.\n\nBill was a man who was interested in everything and always there to offer a helping hand. He was skilled at all sorts of craftsmanship, from working on the church organ and sound system to rehabbing his daughter’s two-flat. Bill was the go-to guy for so many: his family, his congregation, various organizations, his friends and neighbors. Bill was valued and respected for his talents, patience and ethics and he leaves behind shoes too big to fill. He is deeply mourned by family and friends.\n\nVisitation at Ahlgrim Funeral Home, 567 S. Spring Rd., Elmhurst on Thursday, March 5 from 3-8 p.m..

Ken Wegner, who knew Bill well because of all the fundraising they had done together, called for an extra round applause during the brief program portion at the 15th annual Chef Fest event.\n\n“He wouldn’t have wanted a moment of silence,” Wegner said to the capacity crowd at Drury Lane. “So let’s give him another round of applause.”\n\nEarlier in the evening, The Independent had a chance to speak personally with Wegner to hear his memories of the man who was often known as “Dollar Bill.”\n\n“Bill had a huge heart, he always wanted to do good,” he said. “He worked very hard for the foundation, he was a wonderful person to work with and he really cared about people and about the hospital.”\n\nWegner frequently served as Chairman of the fall fundraising events that used to be held at The Carlisle, which were typically costume parties.\n\n“Here’s the funniest stories I have about Bill,” he said. “One year Bill’s date came dressed as Marilyn Monroe and had bright red lipstick on. Well, I couldn’t find Bill for a while -- it was time to draw raffle tickets or something – and I couldn’t find him anywhere. When he finally showed up, he had the same lipstick on his own lips as well as all over his face!\n\n“It was so funny moments because here’s Bill -- he’s so straight and narrow, all business, always doing the right thing. And now, his shirt was all rumpled and he had lipstick all over his face.”\n\nWegner said Chef Fest was a tribute to him, that he was very instrumental in the many events the hospital held over the years.\n\n“He was a wonderful, wonderful man. The Foundation wouldn’t be what it is today without Bill von Stein.”\n\nDarrell Whistler, who served many years on the Hospital’s Board of Governors, liked working with von Stein as well.\n\n“What I really liked was how he would critique me,” he said. “Bill was on top of everything and every time we would do something, he would write down notes – he had beautiful printing – and he was very articulate. He would always go over his notes afterwards and tell me what we could have done better. That’s how he was, even if things were done well, he wanted to make them better.”\n\nBetsy Hanisch had this to say: “He was a real friend to Elmhurst. He was one of the first people I met through my involvement with the [Elmhurst Chamber of Commerce] Board of Directors. At the time, they were trying to get business people more active with the hospital. Then 16 years ago, he helped me launch the Golf Outing that took place at River Forest. It was, he admitted, way beyond his comfort level – because he didn’t golf.”\n\nHanisch also talked about his retirement party.\n\n“His retirement party was ‘Hats off to Bill’ – there was a coat tree with the many hats he wore – for Rotary, Boys and Girls Clubs, all the things he’d been involved in. It was a wonderful tribute.”\n\nWilliam B. von Stein was born on November 8, 1939, and passed away on February 17, 2015, at the age of 75. He was the beloved husband of the late Marilyn J., nee Donner. He is survived by two daughters Susan (Mike) McManus and Meg (Larry) Zelenovich; his stepchildren Patty Barnett, Mike Adamle, Mark (Susan) Adamle and Vic (Mary) Adamle. He was the proud grandfather of Kate, Carolyn and Mary and step-grandfather to many.\n\nIn addition to being Vice President of Development for Elmhurst Memorial Hospital, Bill von Stein was active with Elmhurst Rotary Club, was a volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club of West Cook County and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. In lieu of flowers, memorials will be appreciated for the Boys and Girls Club of West Cook County or to Elmhurst Memorial Hospital.\n\nFuneral services were held on Friday, February 20, 2015, at Ahlgrim Funeral Home in Elmhurst. Interment Chapel Hill Gardens West Cemetery.\n\nBridget Ann Hancock, 68, of Trevor, passed away on Tuesday, January 13, 2015, at her daughter’s home surrounded by her loving family.\n\nBorn on October 9, 1946, in London, England, she was the daughter of the late John and Florence (Piper) O’Sullivan and one of nine children. She met her late husband John G. Hancock in London, while he was stationed at R.A.F Bentwaters, and they married on October 19, 1968. They had one daughter Stephanie before returning to the U.S.\n\nShe proudly accepted the role of a military wife and moved from England to air force bases in: Maine, Illinois, a second tour in England, North Dakota, Texas, and two bases in Illinois, including a last assignment at Great Lakes Naval Station. She became a member of the Officer Wives Club after John completed Officer Training School in 1979. During John’s last assignment at Great Lakes, they moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and John retired as a major from the military in 1993, and started a second career at the Kenosha County Courthouse until retirement in 2008. John passed away on December 8, 2008.\n\nOver the years, Bridget worked part-time at some of the schools her daughter attended as an assistant and a “lunch lady.” She also worked retail sales at the Scott Air Force Base Exchange store and worked for many years in retail sales at the Company Store, Eddie Bauer and more recently Cole Haan in the Prime Outlet Mall. She thoroughly enjoyed working with her fellow employees and loved meeting and assisting the store customers over the years.\n\nShe & John owned many animals in their time together, including their beloved Brittanies, cats and horses. Bridget often accompanied John to dog show competitions, and the Brittany Club field trials and events, making friends with many fellow animal lovers. She also was a member of the British Wives Club and enjoyed gatherings with fellow women originally from the United Kingdom.\n\nThose who knew and loved Bridget will remember her kindness, sense of humor, and her dedication to friends and family, including her daughter Stephanie (Ken) Nurczyk of Elmhurst, IL; her two beloved grandchildren Ryan & Sophia Nurczyk; her two sisters Josephine Roberts of England and Patricia Kerr of Brooklyn, NY, and sister-in-law Clarene (Gene) Perttula of North Adams, MI. She also leaves many other beloved family members and friends with her beautiful memory.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015, at 3:30 p.m. at the Piasecki-Althaus Funeral Home. A visitation for Bridget will be hosted from 2 p.m. until the time of the service at the funeral home.

Vertovec of Elmhurst, passed away on January 12, 2015, at the age of 91. He was born in Elmhurst on March 13, 1923, to Frank and Caroline Vertovec. He grew up in Elmhurst with his five siblings, Fran, Frank, Carl, Ray and Jean. He later graduated from Elmhurst College and received his law degree from DePaul University.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the Air Force, specializing in radar navigation training. Following his service, Ed married his beloved wife Betty J. Pace on June 21, 1947. According to Ed, Betty made their 67 years of marriage total happiness and bliss.\n\nEd lived and maintained a local law practice in Elmhurst where he championed numerous public works projects, including the advancement of the Chamber of Commerce and the Elmhurst Park District, along with Co-Chairing the Underpass Committee.\n\nIn 1988, Ed and Betty retired to Skidaway Island in Savannah, Georgia. Ed devoted countless hours to his lifelong love of volunteer work, donating his time to many organizations including the Chatham County Victim Witness Assistance Program, the Chatham County Juvenile Court Panels (which assisted judges in caring for minors), the Village Library at Skidaway, and the Howard Young Medical Center in Minocqua, Wisc. He was presented the Thousand Points of Light Volunteer Award by President George H.W. Bush in a ceremony in Salt Lake City.\n\nWhen Ed and Betty moved back to Elmhurst in 2013, he began searching for the right volunteer job. After experiencing an incredible day in Washington, DC on the Honor Flight with his brother Ray and many other veterans, Ed became involved in aiding local veterans through his work at The Lexington including organizing a lecture from four Battle of the Bulge survivors just last week.\n\nEd will be remembered for his many great passions including travel, sports, reading and history. His life-long emphasis on fitness and working out began many years ago at the Elmhurst YMCA with his close friends, The Jolly Boys, and then continued at The Courts where he played tennis several times a week. He continued playing a bi-weekly game of tennis until he was 90.\n\nOver the years he also played numerous sports including softball in an Elmhurst league, volleyball, and (perhaps most importantly) golf, which he continued well into his 80s. After retiring from most team sports, he happily sat in bleachers through rain, snow, sleet, sun and heat watching his descendants play a wide variety of sports. For the past 40 years, Ed and Betty also spent countless hours enjoying the comforts of their lake home in the north woods of Wisconsin with family and friends.\n\nTo know Ed was to love him. He was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great- grandfather and friend. His frequent greeting of, “Hello this is sweet and lovable Ed Vertovec,” always rang true. Ed was generous, kind, gentlemanly, positive, brilliant, and humble. He always had a smile on his face and a song on his tongue. He wrote amazing poetry for family occasions, his last being his beloved wife’s birthday, where he had the entire room in tears. Ed lived his long life with enthusiasm and optimism. He was always thinking of others and what he could do to help them. His sage advice was welcomed even this week. Ed will be missed more than words can express, but he has made the world a better place. His spirit and his goodness will live on in all whose lives he touched.\n\nEd is survived by Betty and their four children -- Kristine (Glenn) Rosenberger, Joe (Nancy Ebaugh), Mary, and Ann (David Audley). Ed was an enduring grandfather to nine grandchildren: Tiffani, Brian, Allison, Christopher, Hannah, Sam, Jordan, Ben, and Wil; and to three great grandchildren: Hope, Collin and Andrew. He is also survived by his brother, Ray (Anne) and his sister, Jean (Roman) Schmitt.\n\nA Memorial Mass was held on Saturday, January 17 at Immaculate Conception Church, 134 Arthur, Elmhurst.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, remembrances may be made to Honor Flight Inc., 300 E. Auburn Ave. Springfield, OH 45505 www.honorflight.org or The Village Library, 1 Skidaway Square, Savannah GA 31411, (912) 598-1183, thevillagelibrary.org.\n\n[Ed. note: Just last week, the Elmhurst Independent began publishing columns that had appeared in SeLEXions, a literary journal written by residents of Lexington Square in Elmhurst. The first-ever column, appearing on the Viewpoint page of the January 15, 2015 edition of the Elmhurst Independent, was written by Ed Vertovec. The Elmhurst Independent mourns his loss and extends its sympathies to his family and loved ones.]\n\nJane Ellen (Bizzell) Re, 63, passed away on January 1, 2015, in the Venice, Florida hospital, after an illness. She was predeceased by her parents, Herman A. Bizzell and Dorothy (Pulhamus) Bizzell, for whom she cared tenderly in their last years.\n\nJane will be lovingly remembered by her son Ben Re, of Lexington, Kentucky; son Joe Re, of Villa Park, Illinois; sister Patricia Bizzell, of Worcester, Massachusetts, and her nieces Anna Herzberg, of Providence, Rhode Island, and Rachel Herzberg, of Tel Aviv, Israel; former husband Michael Re and wife Karen, of Carlsbad, California; his mother, Alice Re, and Don Smith, of Nokomis, Florida; Leslie (Re) and Paul Oslansky, of Cinncinatti, Ohio, and their daughter, Deanne, of Chicago, Illinois; and her long time family friend, Gladys Going, as well as many other friends.\n\nJane was born in Evanston, Illinois, on August 12, 1951, and lived most of her life in the Chicago area, eventually residing in the west suburb of Elmhurst where her family started and grew. As a young woman, she had a successful career as a photographic model, featured in a city-wide campaign for the Ford Motor Company. Later she obtained her realtor’s license and managed commercial property with the Inland Real Estate Group for many years. She retired to Nokomis in 2012.\n\nJane loved animals, and was never without a canine companion, including her Papillon, Mishka, who survives her. Jane was an accomplished horsewoman, and in earlier days enjoyed riding her quarterhorse mare, Clover. Equine and equestrian art adorns her home, much of it her own skillful drawing and painting. Jane’s love of animals and artistic ability combined in the recent launch of a business creating color portraits of dogs, from life or from photographs.\n\nAbove all, Jane valued her family and friends, and she would do anything for them. Her home was the center of Christmas celebrations for the whole family for many years. She was a gracious hostess with a great sense of humor. She will be sorely missed.\n\nCremation services in Florida will be private, and Jane’s ashes will be interred in the family plot in Kansas at a later time, when a memorial service will also be scheduled.

As a teenager, he supported his family through first the Russian and then German occupations of Eastern Poland during WWII, until he was taken at gunpoint and placed in a forced labor camp in Markranstadt, Germany for three years.\n\nAfter the Americans liberated the camp in April of 1945, Mr, Wyrwa was recognized by the U.S. Army for his leadership skills and his ability to speak five languages and, at the age of 22, was appointed as Messing Officer for the entire refugee camp. He was later appointed Liaison to UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and later to the IRO (International Relief Organization) to oversee several regional camps, where thousands of refugees from several nations benefited from his service in post-war West Germany.\n\nMr, Wyrwa married Wieslawa (Jane) Lippert on March 15, 1947, whom he had met while they were fellow forced laborers. In 1951, after several years of waiting, they finally obtained a permanent status visa and were able to immigrate to the U.S. with $50 in their pockets, which they used to buy gifts for their sponsors. He subsequently lived the American Dream, working hard during the day at any job he could get to support his family and then attending night school at Loyola University to earn a degree in business administration. Mr, Wyrwa later found employment at Perfect Plus Hosiery and worked his way up to being Senior Vice President. After the company was bought out by IC Industries, he was hired by Midas International Corporation and eventually became the Manager of Consolidations and Reporting, until he retired in 1987. Mr, Wyrwa was able to finally enjoy some well deserved rest in his retirement, playing his beloved Contract bridge, tending his plants and teaching his grandson how to play chess.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife Wieslawa (Jane) and daughter Eva (Donald Miller) Wyrwa-Miller, grandson Robert Miller and nieces Grazyna (Paul) Lippert Zajaczkowska and Iwona Lippert.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents Adela (nee Lukowicz) and Edward Wyrwa; and by his only sibling, his brother Adam, who was killed at the age of 16 by the Nazis for being a Resistance fighter; and, by his dear son George, who drowned at the age of 16 trying to save another swimmer.\n\nFuneral Mass was held on Monday, December 15, 2014, at Visitation Church in Elmhurst.

Greg was a humorist and professional speaker whose hallmark was his uncanny resemblance to the farmer in Grant Wood's famous American Gothic painting. An article about Greg and his work features a photo of Greg, dressed in overalls and standing complete with pitchfork, next to the painting. He'd use the resemblance in his work by telling his audiences that they could find ways to have more humor in their lives, even if they came from a somber family, \"like my parents.\"\n\nDuring his 30-year career as a speaker, Greg spoke to more than half a million people, giving talks in 49 of the 50 states and in Canada, England, and Australia.\n\n“I’m more saddened than words can express,” said his wife Madeleine. “I know that literally thousands of people have been touched by Greg’s talks. I have files full of your messages to him over the past 30 years, messages that told him how much his words moved you, or made you laugh, or helped you cope. Your responses to Greg were what made his work meaningful to him. “I had the privilege of being with Greg from the beginning of his speaking career, when we went to a local vendor to pick up stacks of newly-printed glossy brochures. At that time, I had no idea that I would be with him to the end of that journey.”\n\nGreg was truly the warm, funny, people-person that you ever saw on stage, according to Madeleine. In Elmhurst, he knew people by name, who worked at the Jewel, the Ace Hardware, the Post Office, at Walgreen’s, etc.\n\nHe gave a talk for cancer survivors at an event sponsored by Elmhurst Hospital a few years ago. He also did at least one presentation for the staff of the Elmhurst Park District\n\nMemorials are requested to the American Lung Association or to the Music Program at Unity Temple headed by Marty Swisher, 875 Lake Street, Oak Park, 60301. Greg loved the choir!\n\nA third conviction Greg stood by was ending violence in any form. He was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, teaching at inner city schools as his alternative service. His heart was broken by the suffering that violence causes. For this reason, he stood at our services when the names of U. S. soldiers lost each week to war are read. He also stood for the civilian victims of war, for the soldiers lost on “the other side,” for the heart-breaking number of people in the city of Chicago lost in violence, whose names are also read at our service every week.\n\n“I know he would be glad for any donations made to organizations dedicated to nonviolent means of bringing more peace and justice into our world,” Madeleine said.\n\nThere will be a Memorial Service for Greg at Unity Temple in Oak Park, on Saturday, December 20 at 2 p.m. Arrangements were provided by the family and at his web site at gregrisberg.com\n\nAlvin Paul Klaeren, 86, of Newark, Ill., formerly of Elmhurst, passed away peacefully on Saturday, October 4, 2014, at his home surrounded by his loving family.

Alvin was a member of Salem Lutheran Church in Sandwich and First United Methodist Church of Elmhurst. He proudly served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953.\n\nAlvin was a licensed architect and a member of the American Institute of Architects. He played semi-pro football with the Elmhurst Travelers and was inducted into the American Football Association Hall of Fame in 2005.

He was really good at it and he excelled in mentoring the young people in his department. But he wanted to make a long-lasting difference for the community at large, so, throughout his business career and well into retirement, he lent his expertise to an array of public parks, trails, and conservation groups.”\n\nAn MBA graduate of the University of Chicago, his research work in advertising represents a veritable summary of 20th century consumer marketing in America. Among the brands he guided to the marketplace were Ray-O-Vac, Pillsbury, Kool-Aid, Kleenex, Kraft, Pepsodent, Hallmark, Lincoln automobiles (including the Edsel), Goodrich, Hiram Walker, Johnson Wax, Raid, Dial, International Harvester and First National Bank of Chicago. He retired from his professional career as Worldwide Director of Marketing Services for Foote, Cone & Belding (FCB).\n\nExcept for his military service, Pomerance spent all of his life in the Chicago area. He was born in 1921 to I. S. Pomerance, a dentist, and Grace F. Smith, a physician, on Chicago’s south side. After attending Chicago public schools, through junior college, he attended the University of Chicago, where he met his future wife, Ginny Lus. His education was interrupted by World War II, during which he served as a sergeant in an armored division and later as a lieutenant in a signal company of the Army Air Corps. Following the war, he earned his MBA in statistics.\n\nElected three times to six-year terms on the Elmhurst Park District board, Pomerance served as its president for several years. He also served as president of the Illinois Association of Park Districts, was a trustee of the Illinois Park and Recreation Foundation, and for more than a decade was a trustee of the National Recreation and Park Association. He was a founding member of the People for Elmhurst Parks Foundation, served on the board and published the newsletter of the Illinois Prairie Path in its early days, and was a member of the Advisory Board of the Forest Foundation (now The Conservation Foundation).\n\nFollowing retirement from Foote, Cone & Belding, he returned to school to study landscape design at College of DuPage, with supplementary courses at the Morton Arboretum, leading to work in the landscape architecture department of the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County and the landscape department of the Chicago Park District.\n\nIn both of his careers, Pomerance contributed articles to magazines and journals and was a sought-after speaker. He held officer positions in his major professional groups — Marketing, Statistics, and Public Opinion Research — and frequently delivered research papers at local and national meetings of such groups. He also spoke at meetings of the Advertising Research Foundation and the European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research. Equally active in the parks field, he contributed articles and spoke often at meetings of State of Illinois groups and at regional and national conferences.\n\nBetween business and retirement, Pomerance and his wife traveled to more than 100 countries on seven continents. He delighted in showing his pictures to travel clubs, civic groups, and to friends at home where his wife would prepare meals indigenous to the countries being described. Some of their trips also involved service, including copying from old church records in Hungary, an archeological dig in Argentina, and teaching English in Poland. At the age of 90, he made his most recent international trips, one to the fjords of Norway and another to Amsterdam to hear a new opera. Widely recognized by his peers, Pomerance was elected to Beta Gamma Sigma, the national honor business fraternity, at the U. of C. He twice received Merit Awards from the American Marketing Association for research papers, was published in the Journal of Marketing, and was listed in Who's Who in Finance & Industry and in Who's Who in America. He served as a part-time instructor in marketing research, statistics, and advertising at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. In 1989 he was named Commissioner of the Year by the Illinois Association of Park Districts, and was honored with the National Voluntary Service Award by the National Recreation and Park Association in 1994.\n\nPomerance volunteered for the PTA, Boy Scouts, the Elmhurst YMCA and at Elmhurst Memorial Hospital and, until shortly before his death, was an instructor in the AARP Driver Safety Program for seniors. He also enjoyed classical music as a longtime subscriber to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera. His work on a family genealogy provided much satisfaction to him and the opportunity to connect with distant relatives all over the world.\n\nHis wife Ginny, whom he married in 1944, preceded him in death after almost 67 years of marriage. In addition to daughter Lynne Attaway, other survivors include his sister Helen Johnson of Chicago; two other children, Diane Koenker of Urbana and Roger Pomerance of Chicago; five grandchildren and five great grandchildren.\n\nJames W. “Jim” Panter, Jr., a resident of Villa Park, died Monday morning, September 8, 2014, in Elmhurst Memorial Hospital.\n\nJim was born August 7, 1935 in Struthers, Ohio, a son of James Walter Panter, Sr. and Edna Allen, who was a descendent of Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen. Raised in Struthers, he had lived in Cleveland, moving to the Chicago area then to Villa Park in 1967.\n\nHe was a 1953 graduate of Struthers High School. He worked at General Extrusions in Youngstown and in construction with the Arnold Company in Cleveland. He then worked in the printing industry where he found his career.\n\nIn 1960, his brother Charles founded Associated Data Forms in Oak Park, where Jim worked as well.

That is why the community gave a collective gasp at the news that she had passed away at the age of 69.\n\nIrene Shaffer, nee Korynecky, of Villa Park, passed away on June 16, 2014, at Elmhurst Memorial Hospital. Beloved daughter of Alex and the late Maria Korynecky; loving sister of Villa Park Village Clerk Hosanna Korynecky, Gladys (David) Novotny and the late Nester Korynecky. Funeral services were held at Steuerle Funeral Home in Villa Park on June 19, 2014. Interment took place at Mt. Emblem Cemetery.\n\n“Irene was a dedicated volunteer who worked so hard to make a difference in our community and she certainly did,” said Alesia Bailey, executive director of the Villa Park Chamber of Commerce. “We have truly lost a wonderful person.”\n\nSome knew her as a long-time employee at Villa Park National Bank, now BMO Harris Bank. Others people knew Irene through her hundreds of hours of volunteering for the Kiwanis Club, the Community Pride Commission, the Villa Park Historical Commission and many other organizations.\n\n“Until I went to her funeral, I had no idea she was an alto singer,” Bailey said. “She conducted the choir and was a very spiritual person.”\n\nMaking her singing debut in public at age 10, Irene not only sang alto and led the choir, but also was involved for years with kids’ music programs.\n\nIrene came to this country from Ukraine with her two sisters and a brother. She took care of her mother for many years until she passed away, then continued to take care of her father who is still alive.\n\nServing on the Community Pride Commission for many years, she eventually served as chair of the Commission for five years, learning her job under the tutelage of sister Hosanna – the two never went anywhere without each other.\n\nShe was always out and about at community activities. As a Kiwanian, Shaffer worked on their fundraisers, including selling tickets to the annual Kiwanis spaghetti dinner served just before a performance of the Willowbrook spring play. You saw Irene at parades, on holidays and other events throughout Villa Park. And she was always willing to help.\n\n“Irene remained relentless in her pursuit to immerse herself in her community to contribute and make a difference,” Bailey said. “I don’t have all the facts [about her volunteer service], but what I do know is that Irene was everywhere. She volunteered even when no one asked. She would just show up and say ‘I’m here to help, what can I do?’\n\n“I think that's what I remember most about her. You never had to ask, you just knew she'd be there, ready to help.”\n\nWilliam Martin “Bill” Fox, died at his home in Rock Island on June 14, 2014, at the age of 88.

Payne, a resident of Lexington Square of Elmhurst, passed away on June 18, 2014, at the Lexington Square Community in Elmhurst at the age of 103. Born and raised in the Montclare area of Chicago near Grand and Harlem Avenues, he attended St. Ignatius High School, graduating with the class of 1929. He was a captain on the Chicago Police Department until his retirement in 1968, when he became the Police Chief of Elmhurst, serving until 1978.\n\nHe was the beloved husband of the late Ardele, nee Beberger, for more than 74 years. She died in 2013 at the age of 95.

In later years his pursuits turned to golf, bowling and his grandchildren.\n\nReaching adulthood during the lean years of the Great Depression, Payne applied for any job he could. When he celebrated his 100th birthday, he said he never planned on a career in law enforcement, he just landed there.\n\n\"I'd had as much an idea of going into police work as the man in the moon,” Payne said, who landed his first law enforcement job in 1936. “But I took any job I could get.”\n\nHe served as a traffic officer for the Chicago Park District, which led to his eventual career in law enforcement, culminating with his service as Chief of Police in Elmhurst.\n\nPayne is credited with making several improvements to the Elmhurst department during his tenure. He was responsible in 1974 for the City joining DuComm, a consolidated dispatch center that made better use of the city's resources. He also expanded the forensics and evidence technician programs. While those fields are big today, they were a new and relatively unknown back when Chief Payne served. He brought them into the limelight.\n\nHe witnessed such improvements to Elmhurst as the construction of the underpass at Robert Palmer Drive, which was built in the 1970s and provided a way for motorists – and squad cars – to avoid being stopped by the trains that travel along First Avenue.\n\nAccording to family members, to supplement his salary, Payne had a career as a model on the side and was once known as the “Mr. Hines Lumber man.” His son said he took on the second job so that his sons could attend Catholic schools.\n\nFuneral Mass was held on Tuesday, June 24, 2014, at Visitation Catholic Church. Interment Private. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in Bill's name to Elmhurst Police Benevolent Association (EPBAA), 125 East First Street, Elmhurst.\n\nVisitation and Funeral Mass were held on Tuesday, June 24 at Gibbons Funeral Home, 134 S.
