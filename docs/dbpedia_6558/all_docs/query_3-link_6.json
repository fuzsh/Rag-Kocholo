        "text": "Ranking players from all over the world will compete for the United States men's and wo­men's grass‐court champion­ships starting today at 1 P.M. at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens.\n\nRafael Osuna of Mexico, the first player of his country to win the United States champ= ionship, and Maria Bueno of Brazil are the defending title­holders.\n\nA record number of 356 play­ers is participating in the 83d tournament, which takes in senior singles and mixed doubles and will run daily through Sept. 13. Thirty‐seven countries are represented.\n\nEighty‐two players arrived at Kennedy International Air­port yesterday aboard a KLM airliner chartered by the People­to‐People Sports Committee.\n\nEmerson Top‐Seeded\n\nThey were guests at a lunch­eon at the Manger Vanderbilt Hotel, where many are quar­tered. Some left by bus to practice at the Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove and the Pip­ing Rock Club in Locust Valley, L. I.\n\nRoy Emerson of Australia, the Wimbledon champion, heads the list of seeded players. He is the man his country is count­ing on most to win back the Davis Cup from the United States in the challenge round at Cleveland beginning Sept. 25.\n\nEmerson's teammate, Fred Stolle, is seeded fifth. They combined to defeat Sweden, 5‐0, in the interzone cup final. Dennis Ralston of Bakers­field, Calif., and Chuck McKin­ley of San Antonio, Tex., who rank second and first in this country and are expected to face Emerson and Stolle in the challenge round for the cup, are seeded second and fourth.\n\nOsuna is third and Manuel Santana of Spain, Nicola Pie­trangeli of Italy and Arthur Ashe of Richmond are sixth, seventh and eighth.\n\nTop Half Strongest\n\nEmerson and Ashe are in the top quarter with Frank Froeh­ling 3d, Torben Ulrich of Den­mark, Marty Riessen, Tony Roche of Australia, Jose Luis Arilla of Spain, Graham Still­well of Britain and Felicisimo Ampon of the Philippines.\n\nMcKinley and Santana are in the second quarter, in which also are Pierre Darmon of France, Gene Scott, Charles Pasarell of Puerto Rico, Ronald Barnes of Brazil, Antonio Pala­fox of Mexico, Clark Graebner, Herb FitzGibbon, Premjit Lall of India and Eduardo Zuleta of Ecuador.\n\nThe bottom half of the draw is not so strong. Osuna, Pie­trangeli and Michael Sangster, the ranking player of Britain, are in the third quarter with John Newcombe and Owen Da­vidson of Australia, Cliff Richey, Bill Lenoir, Rod Susman, Whit­ney Reed, Donald Dell and Keith Diepraam of South Africa.\n\nIn the fourth quarter are Ralston and Stolle, with Cliff Drysdale and Ray Moore of South Africa, Vic Seixas, Pancho Contreras of Mexico, Bill Bond, Cliff Buchholz, Shiv Misra of India and Bill Bowrey of Australia.\n\nMiss Bueno tops the seeded list in the women's singles, fol­lowed by Margaret. Smith of Australia, whom she defeated in last year's final and also in the Wimbledon final in July.\n\nAfter them are Billie Jean Moffitt, Lesley Turner of Aus­tralia, Nancy Richey, Mrs. Ann Haydon Jones of Britain, Robyn Ebbern of Australia, Norma Baylon of Argentina, Mrs. Carole Clark Graebner, Fran­coise Durr of France, Mrs. Karen Hantze Susman, Annette Van Zyl of South Africa, Helga Schultze of Germany and Justina Bricka.\n\nToday's play will be confined to qualifying matches in the men's singles and a few first­round women's matches. Sixty­four men were drawn for two qualifying rounds. The sixteen who survive after tomorrow will join 112 others in the first round.\n\nMost of the ranking women players will be competing today in the Federation Cup matches at the Germantown Cricket Club near Philadelphia. Twenty nations are entered.\n\nThe United States won the cup at Wimbledon last year, the first time it was in competition.\n\nJ. Clarence Davies and Henry Benisch are the national tour­nament chairmen for the Unit­ed States Lawn Tennis Asso­ciation and the West Side Club. Daniel Johnson is the tourna­ment referee.\n\nThis article can be viewed in its original form. Please send questions and feedback to archive_feedback@nytimes.com"
