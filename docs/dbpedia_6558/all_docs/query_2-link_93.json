        "text": "When Major Smith goes into the Bier Keller, he is wearing an officer's peaked cap. He takes it off and places it on the table and we never see it again. (Apparently, it was stolen from the set during the lunch break.)\n\nAfter Smith and Schaffer initially climb into the Schloss Adler, Schaffer puts on a cap and Smith doesn't have one as they walk out the door of a room and into a hall. Less than a minute later, both of them are walking down another hall, and Smith now has a hat similar to Schaffer's.\n\nAfter the swim in the river all four heroes are soaking wet. Yet when they are in the plane, Major Smith produces an immaculately dry notebook with the incriminating evidence. No wet pages or blurred ink.\n\nThe scenes showing the escape out the window shows the stunt people rappelling normally with full rigging in the long shots, yet in the close up shots the actors are just holding onto the rope and they were not shown rigging the ropes for rappelling and did not show the use of any \"D\" rings or other rappelling gear.\n\nThe helicopter seen landing in the castle courtyard is a Bell model 47G, not built until well after the war in 1953. While the Germans had a small number of working helicopters during the war (none of which would have been readily available to the filmmakers), the Bell does not make a convincing stand-in for any of them.\n\nEveryone, Allied and Axis alike, refer to the German mountain troops as the \"Alpenkorps\" throughout the film. The Alpenkorps was a real unit, but it was disbanded at the end of WWI. The WWII incarnation was known as the Gebirgsjäger, the designation it carries to this day.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, during the initial briefing for the mission, Clint Eastwood is wearing the same colored green necktie that the British are wearing. Members of the U.S. Army wore khaki ties during that period.\n\nEarly in the film, Christiansen makes reference to a \"Pathfinder squadron... with ten-ton bombs\". The film is set some time before late 1944 which is when bombs of this size were developed, and the first wasn't dropped until March 1945. Also, the role of Pathfinder squadrons was marking targets, and they wouldn't have carried the bombs themselves.\n\nDuring the briefing, early in the movie, the team is told that General Carnaby had been on his way to meet with his Russian counterpart regarding D-Day plans and that the meeting place was to have been Crete. That would be impossible as Crete had been seized in a German airborne assault in the spring of 1941 and remained in German hands until the war ended. Moreover, the Western Allies would not share top secret operational plans with their Soviet Allies.\n\nOn the ride up to the castle, Smith and Schaffer climb down onto the roof of the cable car gondola without making enough noise to alert the occupants inside. On the ride down, Smith again descends from the cable gripping device onto the roof, but this time the occupants hear his footsteps and begin shooting up through the roof. This can be explained by the people in the gondola on the trip down were trying to escape and so would be more alert for any suspicious noises.\n\nIt is assumed that in the cable car, Maj. Jonathan Smith screws the light bulbs in, not out, to extinguish them. However light bulbs in public transport stations and vehicles (such as an aerial tramway) have reversed threads to prevent passengers from stealing them for their home.\n\nBooby traps using wires are placed by the road used for the escape yet there is a substantial period between this point and the eventual escape using the bus. However, the trip wires are fastened to posts at the roadside, not all the way across the road, so any passing traffic would not rip through them before the escape. The bus then knocked over the posts during the escape, triggering the timer mechanisms.\n\nWhile the presence of signs reading \"Militärkommando Hohenwerfen\" in the castle would, at first glance, appear to be an error caused by using the actual name of the shooting location Schloß Hohenwerfen (called \"Schloß Adler\" in the film), similar signs can be seen on other buildings. This indicates that \"Hohenwerfen\" does not refer to the castle, but to the administrative region (e.g. a municipality) that contains both the village of Werfen and the Schloß Adler.\n\nWhen the metal canisters which landed by parachute at the beginning of the film are first seen, there is an obvious trail through the snow leading into the far trees, indicating the canisters were placed rather than parachuted into position, or the wind could have dragged their attached parachute through the snow.\n\nWhen the Nazi car (after Smith and Schaffer's arrest) is pushed into the ravine, it explodes without apparent reason before touching the ground. The same happens to the planes on the airfield being lightly hit on the tail by the German Alpine Post Bus.\n\nWhen von Hapen walks across the square whilst it is snowing, the falling snowflakes move with the camera as it pans across, showing them to have been added afterwards.\n\nNear the end of the corridor firefight, Schaffer retreats into the room and a German soldier throws a grenade through the door. In the widescreen version you can see the grenade strike the door frame and bounce back at the actor's feet, yet there is an explosion inside the room where the grenade would have landed. And grenades do not explode in a fireball as shown in this, (and other) movies.\n\nIn the cable-car fight scene, Christiansen fires the silenced pistol five times and then throws the gun on the cable-car floor after the bullets run out. The gun immediately bounces several times, even up to shoulder height, suggesting it is in fact a prop-gun made of rubber or some other material besides metal.\n\nAfter the team parachute lands in the valley, presumably in the middle of German occupied territory, they soon realize that one member is unaccounted for. In the next scene, One soldier locates the missing team member. He yells loudly, \"Major\", loud enough for his voice to echo in the hills and mountains. Any experienced soldier, part of a stealthy secret invasion force, would know better than to yell that loud possibly notifying the enemy of their presence.\n\nWhen Smith and Schaffer first sight the Schloss Adler through binoculars, they also look at a German military training camp nearby. During this shot, the matted image moves noticeably within the still frame image; a poorly executed special effect.\n\nSchaffer's hair is not only too long for a military officer, it's also a 1960's hairstyle. Additionally, all the women in the film -- Mary, Heidi, and the women in the gasthaus -- have obvious 1960s hair and makeup.\n\nWhen Cpl. Cartwright Jones (formerly posing as \"Gen. Carnaby\") is being interrogated he states his name, rank and serial number. He prefixes his serial number with RA, which stands for Regular Army. The Army did not start using this designation until after WWII. Also, RA was a serial number prefix solely for enlisted men - not commissioned officers.\n\nWhen the captured German Alpine Post Bus races throughout the airfield, Schaffer and Mary shoot several small jeeps which flip over. As they do, the rope that flipped them can be seen being pulled off screen.\n\nAfter setting explosives in the hut, Smith and Schaffer climb through the back window to take shelter under the bridge. The shadows of the camera crew are visible on the snow.\n\nWhen they are swimming in the river after jumping from the cable car, they are clearly all wearing flotation vests under their clothes, as they float too high in the water, (their shoulders are clear of the water) and struggle to swim because the vests hold them upright.\n\nSmith and Schaffer have been arrested and are being transported by a staff car and subsequently cause the car to crash. The vehicle careens up and through a wood barricade and then slams into a pile of gravel. The hinged windshield flies open and one of the Germans inside the car is ejected over the hood. Visible briefly is a small cable attached to the top of the windshield that was used to pull the windshield open so the prop dummy of the German could fly through the opening.\n\nAlthough several stylish call signs are used in the radio transmissions (\"Broadsword\", \"Danny Boy\", \"Father McCree\"), most of the other operatives and Colonel Turner, as well as the team's location, are referred to by name in open transmission.\n\nWhen the men first land by parachute, Sgt Harrod is discovered with a broken neck, which appears to Smith to evidence of foul play. However, in the deep snow where Harrod is lying, foot prints would be obvious, proving that someone else had approached him, murdered him and then left. Nobody appears to notice any footprints, not even Smith, who is convinced the Sgt was killed deliberately by someone in his group.\n\nWhen Col. Kramer confronts Von Hapen, he tells Von Hapen that he sent out an order that there were five enemy agents in the area. However, there were originally seven men in the group. Col. Kramer could not have known that two had been killed. The traitor Col. Turner could not have told Col. Kramer of the two dead commandos by radio as he was with Adm. Rolland and the radio operator for the entire operation and could not have made a radio call to Col. Kramer with either of them knowing.\n\nIt would not be likely they would allow the key German operative in the British army (Col. Turner) commit suicide. He must have still possessed precious information and bargaining power than just the names in the diaries.\n\nWhen Herrod is laying dead in the snow after the parachute drop, there are no signs of footprints in the area around his body. However, Herrod was killed by a blow to the neck. If one of the other team members had killed him before gathering with the others, there would have been obvious tracks as it was not snowing at the time.\n\nOver schnapps in the nightclub, Major von Hapen and Mary/Maria have a dispute over the location of the cathedral in Düsseldorf. While the city does have a large church (the collegiate church of Saint Lambert), it is not a cathedral, as Düsseldorf has never been a bishop's seat.\n\nThe RAF airman in the plane at the start ends a transmission with \"Over and out\". While common in films and TV, this is incorrect radio procedure. \"Over\" means you expect a reply. \"Out\" means you are ending a transmission. \"Over and out\" is contradictory."
