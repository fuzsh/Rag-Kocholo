        "text": "The shot put is a track and field event in which athletes ‘put’ a heavy metal ball, known as a ‘shot’. The shot is put – not thrown – with one hand and the goal is to achieve the maximum distance possible. p>\n\nThe history of stone throwing as a sport originated in Ancient Greece\n\nSoldiers competed in cannonball throwing events during the Middle Ages\n\nA modern version of shot put first appeared in the Scottish Highland Games during the 19th century\n\nMen’s shot put has been contested at every modern Olympics since 1896\n\nWomen’s shot put was first introduced to the Olympics in 1948\n\nThe United States is the most successful shot put nation in Olympic history. Male athletes from the country grabbed gold at every edition of the Olympics from 1896 through to 1968 - except two\n\nWorld shot put records\n\nWomen’s shot put world record\n\nHistorically, athletes from Germany and the Soviet Union have dominated women’s shot put world records. The current record is held by Natalya Lisovskaya of the Soviet Union. She threw 22.63m in 1987.\n\nIn contrast, the first women’s record was 10.15m. This was set by the French shot putter Violette Gouraud-Morris in 1924. Some 45 years later, in 1969, Nadezhda Chizhova set a record of 20.09m. This made Chizhova the first female shot putter to achieve a distance of 20 metres.\n\nValerie Adams is one of the leading women’s performers in shot put history. The New Zealander claimed successive Olympic titles in 2008 and 2012 and earned a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Games. She also won four consecutive World Championships titles between 2007 and 2013, and four world indoor titles between 2008 and 2014.\n\nMen’s shot put world record\n\nThe United States is a formidable force in men’s shot put. It all began with Ralph Rose, who set the first men’s record of 15.54m in 1909. From then on, US-born athletes have been at the forefront of the men’s shot put world record progression.\n\nTwo of the biggest pioneers were Bill Nieder and Parry O’Brien. Nieder was the first person to surpass 20 metres, achieving 20.06m in 1960. Meanwhile, O’Brien set nine consecutive records between 1953 and 1956.\n\nHistorically, the United States is the most successful shot put nation in Olympic history. With the exception of 1920 and 1936, male US athletes secured the gold medal at every edition of the Olympics between 1896 and 1968.\n\nIn recent years, Poland’s Tomasz Majewski became the third man in Olympic shot history to win back-to-back titles, achieving the feat in 2008 and 2012.\n\nShot put athletes\n\nThe most successful shot put athletes display a combination of strength, speed, balance, agility and explosive power.\n\nAs a two-time world champion and Olympic gold medallist, USA’s Ryan Crouser embodies these qualities. Crouser’s shot put records encompass both indoor and outdoor competitions: he set the indoor record of 22.82m in 2021 and the outdoor record of 23.56m in 2023.\n\nLike Crouser, Joe Kovacs’ shot put career includes two golds at the World Athletics Championships (2015, 2019). He has also recorded a personal best of 23.23m, which is the second-longest put of all -time.\n\nIn the women’s sport, shot put athletes of particular note include: New Zealand’s Valerie Adams, China’s Gong Lijiao and USA’s Chase Jackson.\n\nA prodigiously talented athlete, Adams’ shot put record is unparalleled. She claimed two successive Olympic titles (2008 and 2012), three gold medals at the Commonwealth Games (2006, 2010 and 2014) and four World Athletics Championships wins (2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013).\n\nGong is a two-time world champion (2017 and 2019) who also claimed the Olympic title in Tokyo. She has a total of 10 world and three Olympic medals to her name.\n\nMeanwhile,Jackson was the first US woman to win a gold in the shot put at the World Athletics Championships, in 2022. One year later, her shot putting skills made her the highest-ranked female shot putter in the world and she retained her world title in Budapest.\n\nThe techniques in shot put comprise several key elements:\n\nGrip and positioning\n\nThe glide or the spin\n\nA smooth and controlled release\n\nShot put grip and positioning\n\nFirstly, shot putters must use the right grip. This involves holding the shot at the bottom and placing the thumb and little finger on each side of the shot. Then, the athlete must place the shot so that it touches or is in close proximity to the neck or the chin.\n\nAn athlete should focus on keeping their putting arm’s elbow high. The arm should also be parallel to the floor. Added to this, the athlete should also stand on the balls of their feet with their knees bent.\n\nSpin and glide\n\nTwo putting styles are currently in general use by shot put competitors: the spin and the glide.\n\nInitially dubbed the‘ Oldfield Spin,’ the spin technique was invented by Brian Oldfield. To execute the spin, athletes begin by facing away from the putting direction. They then spin on the ball of their foot and rotate like a discus thrower, using rotational momentum for power.\n\nMeanwhile, the glide is a linear movement in which the competitor rotates 180 degrees. They start in a fixed position, kicking one leg to the front and explosively pushing with the other. The hips rotate forwards, the arm and shoulders are pulled back and the feet remain close to the ground at all times.\n\nThe release\n\nIn each of these shot putting techniques, the athlete drives with the legs and transfers energy to the upper body. The shot is then released using a forward-leaning posture, which propels the shot.\n\nNo matter whether an athlete glides or spins before the release, their aim is to release the shot with maximum forward velocity at an angle of slightly less than 45 degrees.\n\nRules in shot put\n\nNormally, each athlete shall be allowed three trials and the eight athletes with the best valid performances shall be allowed three additional trials. The ranking order is determined by distance. In the event of a tie, the winner will be the athlete with the next-best measure. At major championships, the format is typically a qualification round followed by a final.\n\nIn elite competitions, there’s a list of conditions that must be met for a valid put. Here are the main shot put rules:\n\nThe athlete normally must commence their attempt within 60 seconds of the official having indicated to the athlete that all is ready for the trial to begin.\n\nThe shot shall be put from the shoulder with one hand only At the time an athlete takes a stance in the circle to commence a put, the shot shall touch or be in close proximity to the neck or the chin and the hand shall not be dropped below this position during the action of putting. The shot shall not be taken behind the line of the shoulders.During the trial, the competitor must stand within the throwing circle; they must not touch the top of the stop board, the top of the rim or the ground outside the circle\n\nThe shot must land inside the throwing sector, which is approximately 35 degrees\n\nThe athlete must not leave the circle before the shot has landed\n\nAfter completing their put, the competitor must exit from the back half of the circle\n\nThe use of gloves is not allowed\n\nThe shot put is performed within a seven-foot diameter (2.135m) circle that has a 10cm high stop board at the front. The shot must be properly executed inside the circle’s boundaries and land within the specified sector. This means that the athlete cannot touch the top of the stop board during their put or leave the circle before the shot has landed.\n\nA failure occurs when an athlete violates shot put rules. For example, stepping on or over the stop board, exiting the circle incorrectly or using cartwheeling techniques. These disqualify the put from being measured.\n\nShot put FAQs\n\nHow much does a shot weigh?\n\nIn elite competition, there are two standard shot weights: one for men and one for women. The men’s shot weight is 7.26kg (16lb) and the women’s shot weight is 4kg (8.8lb).\n\nDoes the shot weigh the same at the Olympics and World Athletics events?\n\nThe Olympic shot weight is the same as it is at World Athletics events, such as the World Athletics Championships. However, the weight of the men’s and women’s shot put varies in other competitions, including school, U20 and masters competitions. .\n\nWhat is the shot made of?\n\nThe shot is typically made of metal. The types of metals commonly used include iron, steel and brass. These metals have different densities, which means the size of the shot varies depending on its composition..\n\nIs the material of the shot different for indoor and outdoor competitions?\n\nIndoor and outdoor shots are sometimes made using different materials. For example, indoor shots are often wrapped or cased in plastic or rubber to prevent damage. Outdoor shots are usually made from iron, steel or brass.\n\nWhat type of shoes are worn for the shot put?\n\nShot putters wear specialised throwing shoes. These shot put shoes have a smooth sole and reinforced sides. This design provides stability and support while allowing shot putters to easily spin and glide.\n\nShot put events\n\nParis 2024 Olympic Games\n\nWorld Athletics Championships Tokyo 25\n\nWorld Athletics U20 Championships Lima 24\n\nWorld Athletics Indoor Championships Nanjing 25"
