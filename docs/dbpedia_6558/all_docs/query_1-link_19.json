        "text": "Before the Open era of tennis began in 1968, professional tennis players were forbidden from playing in the major tournaments, such as Wimbledon, the United States Open (then called the United States National Championships) and the French and Australian Opens.\n\nAmateurs were often paid under the table and in appearance fees, rather than based on their results. In an effort to draw all of the best players to the sportâ€™s biggest tournaments, tennis went pro, starting with the British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth, England, in April 1968.\n\nVirginia Wade, who reached No. 2 in the world in 1975, had a knack for winning on notable occasions. She won that first Open tournament in Bournemouth; won the first U.S. Open, defeating Billie Jean King in the finals at the West Side Tennis Club in 1968; and, finally, won Wimbledon in 1977 during the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, who was in attendance."
