        "text": "Yes, interesting point about dribbling and Van Basten - would say in terms of minimal dribbling (like with his first goal vs England) he was very good but he didn't really attempt very extensive dribbling - sometimes he showed good control followed by a bit of manipulation of the ball or dribbling and then was fouled or was near the box and tried a pass or shot. His use of the ball was generally efficient I'd say and he brought others into the play a lot. But yeah, also at Ajax he had shown what he could do with more extensive dribbling. I feel his Euro 88 version may be him at his best, but that doesn't mean he didn't do more of certain things at other times.\n\nConversely because of what we discussed I'm not sure if I equate Euro 84 with prime Platini completely, but it seems a bit silly on the face of it not to - likewise and maybe even more obviously I suppose it's just a case of one part of his game being more effective/crucial than ever and another aspect not as good as at some other times. I remembered I'd rated Rivera's 67/68 European Cup game at Man United 8.5, and I do think overall that was more like a great midfield playmakers appearance now I think about it (let alone his Final performance vs Ajax ofc) - but it makes sense that as he didn't score when he had that half-chance in the second half that the rating is slightly below the decisive Platini performances vs Belgium and Yugoslavia I think. I also rated Best's performance 7.5 and that being slightly below Van Basten in the Final does feel fair enough so to my mind I think I'm about managing to keep my ratings consistent with each other generally speaking (I don't rate every game in this way ofc, and only really started when World Cup games and ratings were being discussed - I don't think I'll be starting a website called PDG Calcio lol!).\n\nMaybe it is also because France had already Tigana and Giresse for sharing the 'creativity' and 'inventiveness' part (probably the only tournament where both of them were remotely in their prime; Tigana didn't start at the beginning of 1982WC at least) as opposed to other times for the club or national team. The dominance of the team as well made 'creativity' or 'inventiveness' less necessary arguably (less frequent applied within 90 minutes and less noticeable compared to team mates). In 'Gioco all'Italiana' it was often the case of a solid and stable midfield block behind him and then Boniek, Rossi + sometimes another player as support for the attack (with him in the typical hybrid AM/SS role).\n\nI know that MvB himself has admitted that the ankle troubles prevented him from pulling off certain things, such as a banana shot with the upper laces of the foot (if you know what I mean; stretching the foot). From testimonies by world class dribblers we know that fitness affects dribbling more than other attributes, but as I said there are a few impressive individual goals (vs Inter and so on) or dribbling displays at big matches (1987CWC semi final + final; 1990 Intercontinental Cup) and/or against elite defenders after 1986 (when the ankle issue started).\n\nI'll have a look again at the two 1968 euro finals by the way. From a purely individual point of view Dzajic in 1968 is a good alternative option I feel. By which I do not (necessarily) say that the latter two are rivals for Platini in the overall picture; that's ofc more someone like Cruijff who took three teams (maybe four) to a higher level than could be reasonably expected or was desired by 'the authorities' (as I said previously: the bizarre 1973 UEFA downgrade - which is a fact - shows that pretty much). But as an individual tournament I'll look at the two 1968 euro finals again.\n\nFrom before I joined this board I know it isn't your favorite team and you often use it is a black sheep to argue against. That's all nice and well, but factually you are simply wrong here (besides, thanks to good UEFA contacts Germany played practically a home match in 1972).\n\nIn 1972 the Soviet Union was betting on two horses. Olympics was still a very prestigious tournament and key priority for the Eastern Bloc, to beat each other. In 1984 and 1988 they were banned from using players who played in World Cup games for the Olympics.\n\n1972 Soviet Footballer of the Year: #2 and #3 in the ranking played both the Olympics and euro 1972, the #1 (Lovchev) only played in the Olympics. --> Olympics win.\n\n1988 Soviet Footballer of the Year: #3 didn't play in both tournaments, #2 only played at euro 1988, and #1 played at both (Mikhailichenko). --> European Championships win.\n\nLooking below the top three, and at the top ranked players per position:\n\nhttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Список_33_лучших_футболистов_сезона_в_СССР\n\nhttps://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_najlepszych_piłkarzy_roku_w_ZSRR\n\n1972 top ranked players per position: Rudakov, Dzodzuashvili, Khurtsilava, Kaplychnyi, Kolotov played both tournaments. Lovchev (Soviet footballer of the year) and Blokhin (Ukraine footballer of the year and Soviet league topscorer, 8 goals in 9 NT games) played only in the Olympics. Muntyan only played at euro 1972. Fedotov, Gutsaev, Puzach missed both. --> Olympics win. Betting on two horses (7 top rated players vs 6 top rated players).\n\n1988 top ranked players per position: Mikhailichenko played both tournaments. Dasaev, Khidiyatullin, Kuznetsov, Demyanenko, Lytovchenko, Aleinikov, Zavarov, Protasov only played at euro 1988. Gurlokovic, Dobrovolski only played in the Olympics. --> European Championships win. With a landslide (9 top rated players vs 3).\n\nNot for the first time you are way off the mark here. There's no doubt that the euro 1988 team was the \"real Soviet team\"."
