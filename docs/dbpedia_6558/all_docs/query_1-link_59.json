        "text": "ST. CLOUD (WJON News) -- After the Olympics wrap up in Paris this weekend, we can look forward to the Minnesota Senior Games in St. Cloud next week.\n\nFifteen different sports will be played over four days at various venues around the St. Cloud metro area.\n\nVisit Greater St. Cloud Executive Director Rachel Thompson says registration is closed, but they have a record 706 athletes competing in this year's Senior Games. Athletes must be 50 or older.\n\nOur oldest competitor this year is going to be 96 years old, and they are competing in bowling. We have five athletes over the age of 90 doing track and field, swimming, and bowling.\n\nAthletes are coming from 24 different states, as well as representing 185 Minnesota cities.\n\nThe numbers are up this year because this is a qualifier for next year's National Senior Games which will be held in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nWith over 700 athletes coming to town next week to compete in 15 different sports, a lot of volunteers are needed to help pull off the Minnesota Senior Games. Thompson says you can sign up for the days and times that work best for you.\n\nIt might be something that you are familiar with and you know how the game works or you might not, we're happy to have you. The volunteer tab lists out the type of activity you would be doing as well as the time frame so you can pick the day of the week that works best for you, as well as what sport you are interested in helping out with.\n\nSports range from archery, basketball, cycling, golf, pickleball, track and field, softball, table tennis, volleyball, and more. The sports will be played at various venues around the St. Cloud metro area Thursday through Sunday.\n\nThe games are also open to the public for anyone who wants to watch.\n\nREAD RELATED ARTICLES\n\nJake Anderson for St. Cloud Mayor\n\nJames Trantina for St. Cloud Mayor\n\nCarol Lewis for St. Cloud Mayor\n\nSteven Schiller for St. Cloud Mayor\n\nAnne Buckvold for St. Cloud Mayor\n\nMike Conway for St. Cloud Mayor"
