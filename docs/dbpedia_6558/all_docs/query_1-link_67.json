        "text": "Today is the 47th anniversary of the first of Kornelia Ender‘s 29 World Records in just four years. She was 14 years old and goes down in history as the first Wundermädchen of the German Democratic Republic‘s medals machine in swimming.\n\nEnder set a staggering 23 solo world records in the pool between 1973 and 1976. In 2:23.01 over 200m medley in East Berlin, the 14-year-old took down the 2:23.07 world record in which Shane Gould (AUS) had claimed one of three gold and five medals in all at the Munich 1972 Olympic Games. Gould’s tally remains the record for solo scores in Olympic waters at a single Games among women.\n\nEnder’s world mark was the start of a new era and a dark chapter of swimming history.\n\nThe next day, on April 14, 1973, Ender would take down the 100m butterfly world record, her 1:03.05 effort inside the 1:03.34 in which Japan’s Mayumi Aoki had claimed Olympic gold in Munich the year before.\n\nEnder was 1973 sportswoman of the year in the GDR, her husband-to-be Roland Matthes the sportsman of the year. Archive documents show two charts collated by GDR sports authorities that year. One is the popular vote for the sportspeople of the year. Matthes won the votes with 342,558 votes over the 78,582 amassed for nearest rival Hans-Georg Achenbach who in 1976 would become Olympic ski jumping champion. After he escaped from the GDR in 1988, Achenbach exposed the state’s systematic doping of athletes on the cusp of the discovery of secret-police files that confirmed the details of the Sporting Crime of the 20th Century.\n\nIn the women’s votes, Ender amassed 236,181 votes to keep at bay the 171,800 votes of Renate Strecher (nee Meissner), the 1972 100m and 200m Olympic sprint track champion of 1972.\n\nThe other chart shows the 1973 points league for a domestic swimming competition with a twist. The league measured the combined times of the swimmers in 100m on all strokes and the 200m medley in club derbies. Kornelia Ender topped the women’s table, her times 59.02 on freestyle, 1:25.28 on breaststroke, 1:04.97 on butterfly, 1:07.73 on backstroke and a 2:24.91 in the 200m medley (in training).\n\nBy the time her career ended in 1976, she had taken the 100m freestyle world record down, in 10 leaps, from 58.25 in July 1973 to 55.65 for Olympic gold in Montreal; her 100m back World record in 1976 stood at 1:01.62; her breaststroke was down to a 1:15; her 100m butterfly World record stood at 1:00.13; and her 200 IM world record was a 2:17.14, which would almost certainly have resulted in a fifth gold and sixth medal at the 1976 Olympics had the 200 IM not been removed form the program that year.\n\nTallies That Lasted The Test Of Time … Under A Cloud\n\nLike Gould, Ender would notch up tallies to last the test of time, too. In Munich, Ender was just 13 when she claimed silver in the 200m medley 0.52sec behind Gould. Lynn Vidali, of the United States, had led by more than a second at the last turn but Gould, a freestyle ace who claimed world records in all freestyle distance from 100m to 1500m in her career, caught the American with 20m to go and never looked back.\n\nThe Australian raced in lane 2, Vidali in 5, Ender in lane 4. The East German also ploughed past Vidali with a fast last lap. The silver would be the first of eight Olympic medals, two more silvers won in relays at Munich four years out from four golds and a silver won in a controversy soaked women’s meet at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.\n\nEnder was hand-picked as a potential superstar of sport when she was six years old, her ankles and wrists among measures taken to assess how tall and long in limb she might become and what sports were best suited to those measures.\n\nHer silver medals at Munich 1972 at 13 set up a narrative of an extraordinary talent on the way to supremacy – and coincided with the use of systematic doping under State Plan 14:25. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989, an estimated 10,000 athletes across all sports had been doped by their guardians.\n\nRecords show that systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs, the use of Oral-Turinabol and other substances designed to boost testosterone and cause androgenisation of women athletes, underpinned the GDR’s results between 1973 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Some substances trialled on domestic ‘guinea-pig’ swimmers who never made it to international waters had not been put through full clinical trials nor tested on laboratory animals before being fed to athletes.\n\nWhen Ender became suspicious of what she was being given (see archive entry below), she refused to take chlorodehydromethyltestosterone and in 1977 she was barred from further participation in the GDR swim program. In that era, FINA gave honours to several GDR swimming officials, including Dr Lothar Kipke, a member of the international federation’s medical commission who behind the Wall was reported by his Stasi (secret police) watchers for the brutality with which he rammed syringes into the backsides of under-aged girls. To this day, Kipke, who in 1999 was criminally convicted of abuse of underaged athletes, retains his FINA Pin for services to swimming.\n\nKornelia Ender’s Bull Run\n\nOf the 29 world records that she established between 1973 and 1976, 6 fell in relays, 14 on freestyle, 1 on backstroke, 6 on butterfly and 2 on medley. Only breaststroke escaped. It is a scope of World records unparalleled in swimming history.\n\nAt the helm of it all was Kornelia Ender’s stunning progress over 100m freestyle: from the 58.25 clocked on July 13, 1975, Ender set 10 world records, becoming the first woman to break 58, 57 and 56 seconds, the 55.65 at which she left the mark in Montreal on July 19, 1976 marking a 2.85sec gain on the clock since Gould’s 58.5 in 1972.\n\nThere has never been a leap in standards like it. It took 14 years for Dawn Fraser and Gould to achieve that progress before Ender.\n\nOn July 22 at the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976, Ender won the 100m butterfly and 200m freestyle titles (her triumph also marked the biggest winning margin in history) within 27 minutes of each other, both in world-record time. Born in Halle, Ender won four world titles and a silver at each of the 1973 and 1975 world championships.\n\nBelgrade 1973 World Titles\n\nKornelia Ender topped the women’s competition at the inaugural World Championships in Belgrade with four golds and a silver. In the 100m freestyle, she took down her own world record in the heats (57.61) and final (57.54); in the 4x100m freestyle with Andrea Eife, Helge Hubner and Sylvia Eichner, Ender claimed another world record and gold, in 3:52.45, wiping almost three seconds off the global standard set the year by the USA for Munich 1972 gold; in the 4x100m medley, Ender was joined by Ulrike Richter, Renate Vogel and Rosemarie Kother for a World record of 4:16.84, four seconds inside the global mark set by the USA for Olympic gold the year before.\n\nEnder, Richter, Vogel and Kother were all world record holders in their solo events, while in the 200m medley, Ender was beat by teammate Andrea Hubner, who claimed gold in a World record of 2:20.51, 2.5sec inside the world records of Gould in 1972 and then Ender in 1973.\n\nEnder took silver in 2:21.21. Those swims were part of a wave of dominance, in terms of advances in the world records, margins of victory over the rest of the world and winningness across almost all events. At Belgrade 1973, Ender’s five medals contributed to a GDR tally of 10 golds, five silvers and three bronzes. Together with the 100 and 200m backstroke titles claimed by Roland Matthes, the GDR stunned the swimming world by topping the medals table with one gold more than the USA.\n\nThe Fastest Marriage In Swim History\n\nWhen Ender wed Roland Matthes, quadruple Olympic backstroke champion of 1968 and 1972, in 1978, the event was described as “the world’s fastest marriage”. It lasted four years. Ender would later marry Steffen Grummt, who competed for the GDR in bobsleigh.\n\nTheir daughter Francesca is the offspring of parents who boast eight gold, six silver and two bronze medals at the Olympic Games; 11 gold, three silver and 1 bronze medal at world championships; and 49 world records. In the early 1990s confirmation of a secret state-run doping programme tainted GDR results from 1973 to the collapse of the republic from November 1989.\n\nEnder is now 61. On the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, she revealed that in 1989, she had almost escaped to the west through Hungary but the authorities found out and she and her family were turned back. Later it would emerge that it was her own father who had informed the authorities of his daughter’s attempts to find a new life in the West.\n\nAfter the fall of the Wall, Ender became a physiotherapist and ran a successful practice for 25 years.\n\nMatthes, Olympic champion over 100 and 200m at the 1968 and 1972 Games, passed away after a short, acute illness late last year, our obituary to the most decorated backstroke swimmer in history complimented by a moving tribute from John Naber, the double Olympic backstroke champion on Montreal 1976 who ended the era of Matthes dominance.\n\nIn 1991, I was the first journalist to interview Ender after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ender was delightful, the Grummt family fine hosts during several hours at their home on a day I will never forget. Here is an edited extract from the feature published in The Times, London, on December 7, 1991:\n\nIgnorance is bliss\n\nKornelia Ender speaks for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall and revelations that her coaches gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe bliss of ignorance, it seems, can survive even the most thought-provoking revelations. For Kornelia Grummt, who gained her reputation as Kornelia Ender, a statement this week by 20 former East German coaches that swimmers took performance-enhancing drugs, means looking back more in sadness than in anger.\n\nIn the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, Ender, then aged 18, won four gold medals to add to her eight world titles, four other Olympic medals and four European titles. Today, from her comfortable home in Schornsheim, a village in southwest Germany, she says she never knew that she was being given drugs to help her, but acknowledges that she was injected with substances.\n\nThe coaches’ statement came at the start of a week in which Germany, at Gelsenkirchen, hosts the first European sprint championships, and brings the success of the first wundermadchen of the East German sports machine sharply back into focus.\n\nEnder was the experiment that went right, a role model for subsequent German generations. She was chosen by a state talent scout at the age of ten as the girl who would become the fastest woman sprint swimmer in the world; between 1973 and 1976, she set the world record at 100 metres freestyle ten times (a record in itself, one more than Dawn Fraser), lowering the time from 58.25sec to 55.65sec, and retired unbeaten.\n\nBefore her arrival, it took ten years for the world record to improve just under a second and in the 15 years since 1976 the record has been reduced by only 0.92sec each of the four times by an East German, the holder being Kristin Otto, who won six Olympic gold medals the year before the Berlin Wall crumbled.\n\nThis year, Ender’s time would have won the European title and placed her third in the world. The town of Halle housed the Child and Youth Sports School where Ender, at ten, was taken to board. From day one, the target was Olympic success. Ender spent two hours in the water twice a day and did one hour of land work each day, and was rewarded by an above-average lifestyle.\n\nCaught up in the success of team and self, and believing that the “GDR system was right and good”, she says, in reference to drugs, she had “no knowledge, nor any way of knowing, that such a problem existed”. She adds:\n\n“There was no mention of it and nobody spoke about it. It was possible that we were given things in our food and drink. We were fed by a special kitchen at the school but we didn’t know of anything. When I was very young, we were never given pills or injections.”\n\nHowever, in 1975, as the pressure for success grew and training workloads increased to more than 18km (about 11 miles) a day in water, she said she was “astonished that I had grown so much. I put on eight kilos (about 18lb), but in muscle, not height”. Ender added:\n\n“Now, after all this time, I still ask myself whether it could be possible they gave me things, because I remember being given injections during training and competition, but this was explained to me as being substances to help me regenerate and recuperate. It was natural to think this way because the distance swimmers had more injections than we did as sprinters.”\n\nOf the coaches now speaking up and the doctors who may still be hiding, she says: “It’s very sad. The only losers in that are the athletes. It is easy for them to state these things now the finger of blame is pointed at us, not them, and we knew nothing of these things, they did. They deserve punishment. The medical men are the real guilty people. They know what they have done. When they gave us things to help us ‘regenerate’ we were never asked if we wanted it, it was just given.”\n\nThat sadness, she insists, does not detract from the joy that is still fresh in her memory of a swimming life in a system in which she strongly believed. The pressure to win translated into pressure to do as she was told after her retirement, failure to do so costing her the chance to revisit Montreal, at the invitation of the city, in 1986.\n\nIt also costs her her career. When Ender became suspicious of what she was being given, she refused to take chlorodehydromethyltestosterone and in 1977 she was barred from further participation in the GDR swim program.\n\nBut she denied her first marriage at 19 to Roland Matthes, the Olympic backstroke champion in 1968 and 1972, was arranged to create a “superswimmer”. The relationship, she says, was genuine and Francesca was born to the couple in 1978.\n\nThe adage that parents live their dreams through their children may be applied to the Grummt family, though the norm would be reversed for her husband Steffen Grummt, a bobsleighs for the GDR, and Kornelia, who says:\n\n“I don’t pressure her to achieve what I did. I encourage her only to do the things she likes, the things she has talent for.”"
