It was averred that the besifuspension was postponed out of con- anypideration for McKinley, as lame an rresPxcuse as was ever Offered for evading heajin unpleasant necessity—and it was ‘ither that or nothing. If the public eeded to be protected against further nfraction of etiquette by him, they fPeeded it the moment the Cleveland dou- bles were ended, not ten days later. Fail- re to give the same consideration to Darlene Hard as to McKinley was an World Tennis insult. It amounted to saying that she was expendable but he was not. Nobody told him (until too late, at any rate) that he was so poisonous than he could not even play three, perhaps but two, sets at Forest Hills with two ladies on the court to keep him on his good be- havior, and thus carry out the USLTA’s official agreement with the sponsoring Longwood Cricket Club. It almost cer- tainly deprived Darlene of accomplish- ing the hat trick since she had already won the doubles, did win the singles, and was an Oodds-on favorite in the mixed against Mark and Smith. In a hurried telephone poll, 30-odd officials country-wide voted not to re- scind the suspension once it was im- posed until the Executive Committee could meet. This led some reporters to give the result without mentioning that no voter was asked whether he thought the suspension was a wise and proper step in the first place. This caused the uninformed to misinterpret the result as a vote of approval, which it was not. Incidentally, the conduct of contest- ants at Forest Hills was no different in the six days I was there than it was the year before. Any claim that the suspen- sion had a salutary effect should be taken with a grain of salt. The circumstances attendant upon the suspension moved certain highly re- spected New York and Boston colum- nists to castigate the USLTA unmerci- fully in lengthy diatribes. A contributing factor causing this hostility was the brief visit of our Davis Cup Captain to the National Doubles for nothing more than an unprecedented anti-Ralston press con- ference, after which he left town with- out saying a word to Dennis. The news- men were astonished that he did not rise to the defense of one of his boys, which is his supposed duty, instead of deni- grating him. It was also remarked dis- approvingly that he should have re- mained on the scene to boost the morale of his charges during a major national tournament, as his predecessors had done since time immemorial. Tennis participation is at the highest level on record, thanks to the unselfish and, more often than not, unsung exer- tions of a host of dedicated officials and devotees on the regional and Jocal level. To them we doff our hats in profound admiration and gratitude. The status of amateur tennis as a spectator attraction gives signs of moving in the opposite direction. What is needed is a complete change in national administration and policy making. Those who did not pro- test Pietrangeli’s professionalism _be- fore he opposed us but did so publicly weeks later, who concocted the idea of holding amateur and pro tournaments concurrently, who engineered the Ral- ston fiasco, etc., must be repaced by per- sons of the highest calibre. There is little hope that this will materialize, ten- nis politics in this day and age being what they are. Only when apathy is re- placed by courageous action and enough people high and low speak their minds will the situation change. Jerome Scheuer Boston, Mass. * * * I have just returned from the Fiji Islands where my husband and I wit- nessed some extremely interesting tennis. The Islands are several thousand miles away from the nearest continent and the game is only four years old, but never have we seen more enthusiasm. We were walking by the Nandy Hotel when we saw a large crowd congregated around a grass court. We stopped and became so intrigued that we couldn’t leave. The competition, one of their first, was be- tween the two cities of Nandy and Suva. The players were so eager that their love of the game was transmitted to the audi- ence. It was their competitive spirit rather than their skill which kept us there. Later I saw one player excuse himself from a crowd on the grounds that he had just received his copy of WorLp TENNIS and planned to spend the next BE rcnoereni Our original, exclusive TENNIS BELT in heavy 1” elastic webbing.

Mickey Falkenburg Wagstaff New York, N. Y. * a * I would like to report the results of an experiment which could be helpful to some readers of WorLD TENNIS. Each summer we offer what is called the Fair- mount Park Tennis Program. The Phil- adelphia Tennis Patrons Association provides the necessary rackets (116 at present). Since the start of the program 10 years ago, we have been much an- noyed by the fact that a great many children drag their (our) rackets on the ground and over the hard courts. This rubs away the wood on top and eventu- ally exposes the strings. Further rubbing then causes the strings to break at the top. Usually the two center strings are broken. The children are instructed to hold their rackets up. However, many con- tinue to rub them from thoughtless habit rather than from malice. Incidentally, it is surprising to see how many experi- enced players wear away wood from the tops of their rackets by this same sort of | rubbing. (Are you one of the numerous tribe whose rackets make contact with the ground in picking up balls or in playing? ) I began to attack this problem several years ago. The company which manu- factures our rackets was approached. My thinking evolved into applying a | protective cover of some sort as a “scuff plate.” This might be a thin sheet of | metal (aluminum or stainless steel) or a sheet of tough plastic. Such a sheet | could be fastened by small screws or by epoxy cement. Upon mentioning this to Mr. Al De Stefano, foreman of the car- penter shop of the Fairmount Park Cém- mission, he came up with a differe DITC approach. This was to omit the prote tive sheet and simply insert four or fiy screws into the racket so that the head protruded above the wood. Thus, whe the racket touched the ground, th screws would wear away instead of th wood. I then thought of using only tw screws as shown in the illustration. First, two small holes are drilled receive the screws. These are 3/8 round-head wood screws. A pair of thes weight 1.86 grams. This is less than 1/]| of an ounce. Then, before insertion! each screw is dipped into a bit of greasf to reduce the chance of splitting tht [y the rackets. The entire operation takes o + Fores! two or three minutes. We tried this of <,;. 40 rackets. Not one split and the prob pxciting ¢ lem has apparently been solved. Thi er-finals idea might be useful to any organizatiog'V°T4S°: which supplies rackets for children—fogitst and park programs like ours, for city recreagension © tion departments, for schools or fopnly the camps. testants Joseph I.

M World Te: DITORIAL ‘ ONE-SIDED ENCOUNTERS In the early rounds of the National Championships 7 it Forest Hills, one out of every twenty matches is Pxciting or generates spectator appeal; from the quar- TOD : Thi er-finals on, every fourth match, to pick a rough atiogt erage, is a “good” one. Most of the contests in the _fogirst and second rounds are too uneven to produce crefension or thrills. But as the tournament progresses, fopnly the strongest remain in contention. The con- estants are more evenly matched and the battles ire better balanced. Interest is generated by a close engagement, not by 1 one-sided contest. Every spectator has undoubtedly heen just as thrilled by a three-set match between wo club players as he has by the finals of the Na- wrmaftional Championships. Thirteen-and-unders and sen- fingors, provided the opponents are evenly scaled, can Pagproduce as many rounds of applause as two top pro- clulessionals, albeit the tennis in the first case is not °ehearly so good. eo France and England have solved the problem of anef2dless poor first round matches by having qualifying -whgounds. Many a top American and any number of ame#esser Davis Cup stars have had to fight their way Theghrough three rounds of competition before being they ermitted i in the draw. At the French Championships e alleight qualifiers are seeded, and the seeded players are aMprominent enough to make any tournament chair- man’s mouth water. The French and Wimbledon jualifying rounds are far more interesting than the irst three rounds at Forest Hills, where the weak are pitted against the strong in hopeless battles. Several American tournaments have followed the uropean example. The Pacific Coast, the Pacific Southwest and River Oaks have extremely interesting pre-tournament competitions in which college stars ure pitted against each other and local battles local. fhe No. 3 man on a college team can possibly upset he No. 1 man at another school. However, if he were 0 play Chuck McKinley right off the bat, he would ot only bore the audience but he would lose his hance for a win against a player who is only slightly rs Petter than he. 28 The U.S. grass court circuit, which culminates in on* forest. Hills, is extremely uneven. Forty college play- rs are on the circuit; so are the world’s leading ama- eurs. Most of the grass court tournaments do not have room for all the circuit players, and the chair- “faan has to decide which promising young man will be admitted and which left out. Many a good young * er has been stranded for a week because his entry lif. G World Tennis was not accepted. Often he has had wins over three of the other entries, and he cannot see the justice of the chairman’s decision. A year ago the Southern Champion was left out of two major tourneys. This year two South American Davis Cuppers were re- jected at a big grass court event. The following week these two met in the final round of the Orange Con- solation! It would be far more fair to every class of player if qualifying rounds were held. Players fighting for the right to get into the draw would provide spectators with all the interest and thrills that well-balanced matches produce. This was proved this year by the King Lambert Consolation tourneys which were held at most of the grass court fixtures: ousted first-round- ers faced each other in a regular elimination tourna- ment, and for the consolation final at Newport, the players turned out en masse. Many a first rounder gets into a tournament by the skin of his teeth, then takes a 6-0, 6-1 pasting from an Australian Davis Cupper. By the end of the season he can have five first round grass court losses to “name” players, and in none of these matches did he ever stand a chance. Two fifteen-and-unders can put on a great show against each other, but it is not fair to the players involved nor to the spectators to pit a good 15-year old against the World Champion. Every year at Forest Hills, the seeded players are put into the Stadium to play the world’s most boring matches against players who are not yet of national, much less international, caliber. The real excitement is somewhere off in the field where a pretty good col- lege player is battling a reasonably good Canadian, or the No. 4 American Junior has taken the first set off a pretty good sectional player. When the third round rolls around, some of the seeds are still facing cannon fodder. There is hardly a tournament that could not be improved by a qualifying event. In the case of certain club championships, the level of play is so uneven, with the winner and possibly the runner-up being so much better than the other contestants, that every- one would benefit by having one, two or more of the best players “stand out” until the lower echelon had battled each other unto the death. Each tournament has its own peculiarity, but if players are to get the most fun out of competition and if spectators are go- ing to have the best possible matches to watch, then a certain proportion of the entries should play off for 16, 8 or even 4 spots in the draw. Ashley Cooper (right) beat Paul Remy in the first round at Paris. by TONY TRABERT The professionals had their two most successful tourna- ments ever during the month of September. The first event, played in Paris, was the World Professional Hard Court Championships, and the second event, played at Wembley, was the London Professional Indoors. Both titles went to Ken Rosewall, the Little Master. Sixteen players participated, including Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad, and Luis Ayala of Chile made his professional debut. At first we were afraid the show would flop. Monday and Tuesday nights were bad in Paris, and Wednesday was com- pletely washed out. But the crowds got better each day and we ended up with 10,000 for the final. At London the last three days were sell-outs. In the first round at Paris, Luis Ayala knocked off Lew Hoad. The match was begun on a rainy evening, and at 8 P.M., when the weather halted play, Luis was leading 6-3, 6-1, 2-1. He had never played better. When the match was called, he was afraid that he had lost his chance for a great win. The next day Lew took the third set and had point for 3-1 in the fourth. Thereafter he could do nothing right and he never won another game! I nudged by Andres Gimeno in the quarter-finals, and the veteran Segura beat Ayala.

He won the first # making hardly an error in the process. He never came cla to playing that well thereafter. His temper was as hot as weather, and toward the end of the fourth he was throu physically. Rosewall was even better at Wembley. He lost only one and that was to Hoad in the final. He consistently got li first serve in, and against Segura in the semis he returm serve so well that he forced little Pancho to remain on @ baseline. In the other half, Hoad seemed to find his fot for the first time since he broke his foot last March. Fi he beat Buchholz. Then he downed me by one service bre in the third set. He played a tremendous match against Ge zales in the semi-finals, winning in four sets. In the final,# the second game of the first set, Lew pulled his back wh running for a backhand volley and suffered a recurrence his old back injury. Thereafter he could not bend or scra ble as well as usual. He tried for winners since he could! longer run. However, Rosewall is now playing the best tennit of his life and could well have beaten a fit Hoad.

Her absence from Wimble- lon and Forest Hills, however, makes it desirable to place her, like Fraser, in an Insufficient Data category. It is to be hoped that these two great champions will return to the lists f 1962, better than ever. A remarkable feature of this year’s lists is the number of lations represented who have never, or not for many years, had a player in the First Ten. Mexico has both a man and a woman for the first time. Spain regains a place last held by Manuel Alonso in 1927. Great Britain appears in the Men’s ist for the first time since Bunny Austin was ranked second n 1938. In the Women’s list we have two Australians for the malfirst time, and Edda Buding is the first German to reach kings#hese heights since Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling in 1939. afte} This year our lists of potential candidates were sharply causfeduced at the start of the season as it was found that the abor of recording the wins and losses of many players, hose possibility of reaching the top were neglible, was ; for useless and confusing task. Thus, the records of only thirty mosgien and twenty-five women called for review. A preliminary whergcreening reduced these lists to fifteen of each sex, and the ‘ounfecord of each of these was matchéd against all the others. jal alt was then found that five in each group could be set aside beeiind the remaining ten went through another screening, titlfeach one’s record against the other nine being weighed. ; As a further check, though not altogether conclusive, a tim@point system was devised. Taking the four major champion- nd t@tips—Australia, France, Wimbledon and Forest Hills- yrightplus two others, the British Hard Court and the Italian ient#hampionships, the winner of each of these six tournaments Vari World Tennis was given 5 points, the runner-up 3 points, the two semi- finalists 2 points each, and the four remaining quarter-final- ists 1 point each. In addition, a Wightman Cup win was considered worth an additional 2 points. In the following comment, the number of points won under this system is placed after each name. Men The margin between Emerson and Laver is almost invis- ible. Each has won five times from the other and on the point system they are also even, each with 19 points. Against other members of the First Ten, Emerson is 12-9 and Laver 17-11. But Emerson beat Laver in three championship finals and went to the final at Los Angeles while Laver lost to Stewart in an early round. On the basis of these results we award the palm to Emerson, with Laver in second place. Pietrangeli (8) and Santana (7) are also neck and neck. Both have wins over Emerson and Laver and are champions of Italy and France respectively. Between them, Santana has two wins to no defeats but has many more bad losses. So we rate Pietrangeli No. 3 and Santana No. 4. In the fifth place is Chuck McKinley (3), winner at Bris- tol, Orange and Tuscaloosa and finalist at Wimbledon. Krish- nan (2), Chuck’s conqueror in five close sets at New Delhi, rates sixth. The Indian won at Wiesbaden, Dusseldorf, Am- sterdam, Ostend and Knocke le Zoute over lower ranking players. At Wimbledon he beat Emerson to reach the semi- final. Mike Sangster (7) has the enviable record of being a semi- finalist in three major tournaments and a quarter-finalist in another. Yet he has no wins over anyone in the First Ten iy Roy Emerson of Australia, who was given the No. 1 position in the world by Mr. Potter, lunges for a forehand volley at Bournemouth. At Forest Hills, where he won the U. S. title, he made all his volleys count. Even when he had to stretch he either hit winners or very offensive shots. Photo, European.

POTTER 7 HILE THE ALLIED statesmen were drafting the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, the shattered remnants of their armies were entraining for the demobilization camps. Those who exchanged racket for rifle in 1914 were sobered by the reflection that many of their omrades would no longer face them on the courts. Only the ericans had come through practically unscathed. In spite of some doubts, the decision to resume the Wim- bledon championships in 1919 proved to be an unqualified success, with a record entry of 128 in the gentlemén’s event. A newcomer from Australia, Gerald Patterson, won the All- Comers’ and, in the Challenge Round, defeated his mentor, Norman Brookes, in straight sets. The standing-out Ladies’ Champion, Mrs. Lambert Cham- bers, had an even longer Wimbledon record than Brookes. Born Dorothea Douglass, the daughter of the Vicar of St. 4 Matthew’s church at Ealing, a London suburb, she started Hher career as many children have done by batting a ball against a wall. She entered her first tournament when she was only nine and won a handicap singles at eleven. She became marked as a player with a future when she met Mrs. Sterry, four times champion, at Eastbourne in 1900. Though tishe lost a close match, this meeting placed its stamp on Miss Douglass’ game. Disdaining the net-rushing tactics of her conqueror, she based her own game on accurate backcourt play. Her backhand was as reliable as her forehand and she took the net occasionally for a finishing stroke. Her service, while soft, was well-placed. Her match temperament was of ideal. Miss Douglass came to Wimbledon for the first time in 41902 and lost in the semi-final, The next year she won the _werg championship. The years 1905 to 1907 were marked by her . Cu meetings with May Sutton. The American girl defeated Miss losing Douglass in 1905 and 1907 but lost to her in 1906. Miss Sutton did not come back to England in 1908. Two years pt t@elapsed before Miss Douglass, now Mrs. Lambert Chambers, wag resumed her reign. When she returned to Wimbledon in \" 1910 it was noted that her game, which was only in its for- f thd mative stages during previous years, had now reached a in 24 fruition which was to make her stand out above any other time Englishwoman who has ever played tennis. The speed and a 34 accuracy of stroke which had marked her early play had chest been developed amazingly. She had become better as she - wil grew older and was to go on getting better until her apogee in 1919. | an ~=On May 24, 1899, at Maretz-sur-Matz, near Compiégne in | tw? France, was born a girl who was to become the greatest of _ andj all woman players. Suzanne Lenglen’s father, who had a small fortune, spent the winters with his family at Nice on ‘donj the Riviera. Charles Lenglen was secretary of the Nice Ten- wit nis Club and though he was not a player himself, he was | on familiar with the deference paid to the Dohertys and other hing noted players who visited the club. He determined that he would make Suzanne a tennis champion, just as other girls ‘alia are trained in music or art. zaty{. To teach his daughter the game he analyzed the strokes of nitelf the champions who visited Nice. He selected as models the forehand of one, the backhand of another, the service of a World Tennis third. With five-franc pieces as the reward for well-executed strokes, he set about teaching each of these models to the child. Rope skipping, hundred-metre sprints and other exer- cises to build up Suzanne’s physique were also part of her training. In the winter of 1912 she was permitted to enter her first handicap. In 1914 she was handicapped at minus fifty. At Nice she first met Mrs. Chambers and the greater experience of the English champion gave her a straight set win. In the Paris championship Suzanne went through to the Challenge Round and carried the champion to three sets. She had arrived just in time to have the War cut short her progress. When tournaments were resumed in 1919 she was twenty and at the height of her powers. The French and World’s Hard Court championships were postponed until 1920. So Suzanne and her father turned their thoughts to Wimbledon. In an even shorter skirt than May Sutton’s and with an odd-looking hat perched on her black hair, the French girl proceeded confidently on her way to the All-Comers’ final. One of her first matches was against the 1912 champion, Mrs. Larcombe, who tried drop shots and slices without avail. Mrs. Satterthwaite was beaten in the final and the gallery was already Lenglen-crazy as it had been over the Renshaws and Dohertys. One bridge remained to be crossed. Guarding it was the seven-times champion, Mrs. Chambers. Nineteen years had gone by since she first stepped into the list. Suzanne was then less than a year old. Those nineteen years had taken their toll of physical endurance. But they had also served to whet the skill and sharpen the courage of the champion. She was taller by a head than the youngster across the net. She was sharp-featured and flat-chested. She wore an ankle-length skirt and trimly starched waist. What a contrast to the stocky, full-bosomed girl who opposed her! It was nation against nation, old against new, middle age against youth. But it was not only the Lenglen on the court who was to do battle that day. There was another Lenglen in the stand. He eyed every move, corrected every failing, watched his daugh- ter justify his choice of a career and the methods he had employed. The champion opened the service. Suzanne sprang to the attack, took the first game at love and went to 4-1. Mrs. Chambers fought back to 4-3 but the French girl, at an encouraging nod from her father, once more went ahead. It was 5-3, then 5-4 and 40-30, set point. Another reaction by the champion, 5-all, 6-5 and set point for Mrs. Chambers. The French girl equalized and they were 8-all when Suzanne took the net and won the first set at 10-8. This was only an appetizer for Mrs. Chambers, who had got out of tighter places. She got to 3-1. Suzanne was puffing and looked appealingly at her father. A phial was dropped on the court. Suzanne swallowed a mouthful of cognac and sugar and pulled up to 4-all. Mrs. Chambers gritted her teeth and won the set at 6-4. The stimulant was still potent. Suzanne ran away to a 4-1 lead in the deciding set. With nothing to draw on but her fighting spirit, the champion won five games in a row and two match points. “Now, Suzanne,” Charles Lenglen seemed to shout, although he was still as death. “Now, Suz- anne, risk all!” Obediently the French girl drove deep to the champion’s forehand and dashed for the net. Mrs, Cham- bers had an answer to that and lobbed over the incoming head, Suzanne stepped back a pace and brought her racket down wildly on the fast-dropping ball. If it had been a clean hit it would have landed in mid-court where Mrs. Cham- bers was waiting to put it away. But Suzanne could only try to save it. The ball hit the wood at the tip of her racket and fell just over the net. She was encouraged by this stroke of luck. She let nothing go now. After five more games the championship was hers. 19 The two men’s finalists are in typical position. Roy Emerson is attacking close in to net and Jon Douglas is in the back court. Douglas defends more often than his opponents, and on the backhand side his passing shots are beautiful. Photo, Jim Biltchik.

Old-timers can recall intercollegiate player Jack Tidball upsetting the world’s best amateur, Ells worth Vines, and young Gracyn Wheeler knocking off U. 5. National Champion Alice Marble. Southern Californians love the fast cement with its true, high bounce, and the color ful seeded stars from foreign countries are invariably the victims of the locals. This is Los Angeles’ most exciting tour- nament, with not unexpected “surprises” coming daily and with the hometown boys registering their long-sought wins. This year’s tournament was no exception. Wimbledon Champion Rod Laver was rudely knocked off in the third round by Hugh Stewart. Wimbledon Doubles Champions Karen Hantze and Billie Jean Moffitt failed to win the women’s tandem doubles title. U. S. Champion Roy Emerson, who is rated the No. 1 amateur in the world, was the victim of California’s Jon Douglas. Only Darlene Hard came through. Ever since her bout with hepatitis, she has been invincible. She won the singles, the doubles and the mixed, suffering no let-down after her brilliant Forest Hills victory. The Men’s Singles Bruce Campbell, a UCLA student, won first day honors by downing 19-year old British Davis Cupper Roger Taylor.

Junior champion Charlito Pasarell was ousted by a local club player, Jim Bisch, in three tense sets. When the second round of play had concluded, Forest Hills semi-finalist Rafael Osuna was out of the competition. He was the victim of former Yugoslavian Davis Cupper Vladimir Petrovic. This match was played on the resurfaced center court, which is now considerably slower than it was before. This gave all defensive, steady, back court players a distinct advantage over the advocates of the big serve and volley game. However, most of the upsets can be attributed more to a let-down on the part of the stars and a keenness on the part of the local players than to court conditions. Such was the case of Chris Crawford’s loss to attacking Larry Nagler in straight sets. Mike Franks was given a scare before downing Arthur Ashe, and Navy Champion Norm Perry scored a mild upset as he defeated an off-form Bill Hoogs. Hugh Stewart allowed world traveler John Lesch only two games, which is an indication of how well Huge Hugh was playing. Stewart was sensational in the third round as he ushered Rod Laver to a spectator’s seat. He outdid himself, and never has his forehand drive appeared more deadly. With Stewart serving at 5-4, deuce, in the final set, one of his drives flicked the net and deflected just enough to go beyond the reach of Laver’s outstretched racket. On match point, Laver overhit an overhead by inches, thus bringing Stewart into the quarter-final round. Bruce Campbell held double match point on Larry Nagler before losing. Petrovic —_ his second upset by downing Ramsey Earnhart of USC straight sets. Billy Bond, also of USC, matched “est shoe Mike Sangster serve for serve for three sets. One service break was all that was necessary to give victory to the Eng- lishman. Jon Douglas changed his tactics after losing the first set to Petrovic, stormed the net and was never again in trouble. In another quarter-final Mike Sangster beat Bob Mark in straight sets. Roy Emerson defeated Mexico’s Antonio Pala- fox 6-4, 6-0. There were some brilliant points in the first set. but Palafox became disheartened when a linesman’s close call at 4-all, point for a service break, was given in favor of Emerson. Roy took eight games in a row for the match. Stewart advanced to the semi-finals with a three set decision over Nagler.

In an era when most men’s matches are characterized by service, return and volley, we saw intelligent baseline rallies, with the men com- ing to net only when a deep approach shot forced a short return. The composed Douglas never wavered, and eventually Stewart, who had by far the biggest weapon in his forehand. succumbed in the third set. Emerson defeated Sangster in straight sets in a match that was not exactly stimulating. Mike could not get his first serve in play nor could he adjust his timing to the courts. Fleet-footed Jon Douglas was at an advantage in the final on the slow center court, as he had been throughout the tournament. He forced Roy Emerson to play defensively. then outmaneuvered him from the baseline. Jon led 5-3 on his own serve in the third set but was not able to hold deliv. ery. The next and deciding game was the most exciting ol the match. On the last point Douglas’ return ticked the tape and brought Emerson out of position. He won the title 6-2 1-6. 6-4. The Women’s Singles Seven of the eight seeds in the women’s division managed to reach the quarter-finals. Only Billie Jean Moffitt was upset Her conqueror was veteran Dodo Bundy Cheney, a semi finalist in the U. S. National Seniors. Margaret Smith of Australia impressed the gallery with her magnificent all-court game. She is young and strong. and one felt she could have gone on indefinitely. Her oppo nent, Wightman Cupper Karen Hantze, had a one gam lead in the final set and was just able to hang on to clinch the victory. Both girls were serving and volleying incredibly. and the match was of the highest caliber. Darlene Hard de feated Jan Lehane in three sets.

Young Aussie Lesley Turner defeated Dodo Cheney in another close fought battle. Darlene started out slowly in the semi-final round against Lesley Turner, but she hit her peak during the late stages of the second set, which she won at 8-6, and she went on to win the third at 6-0. Turner’s timing was lost once Darlene jjgot her attacking game under control, and the latter could do no wrong in the final stanza. Karen Hantze’s supposedly |“weak” forehand was spectacular against Ann Haydon as she defeated the English girl in three sets. It was a stimulat- ing match, intelligently played on both parts. with the vic- tory going to the more spectacular shot-maker. Darlene won her title the “hard” way against Miss Hantze. .| She was a little too loose in the first set, which she dropped at 5-7, but the quality of her play improved as the match | progressed. She took the second set 6-2 and went from 2-3 in the third to 6-3. The spectacular play was somewhat dim- inished by Karen’s court conduct. She stalled between points -2,Jand quick served her opponent on several occasions. The between-sets break was extended to 20 minutes instead of the usual 10, although Darlene was ready to resume play on time. (In the semi-final round, Haydon was kept waiting a full 30 minutes before Hantze reappeared.) Nevertheless. the quality of play was extraordinarily high and the gallery was treated to some fantastic retrieves as well as beautiful winners. The Men’s Doubles The best match of this event was unfortunately finished so late in the evening that there were very few people stay- ing to appreciate it. The left-handed tandem of Bill Hoogs and Jim McManus, both students at the University of Cali- fornia, defeated the Mexican Davis Cup team of Rafael Osuna and Antonio Palafox, 5-7, 9-7, 6-3. Roger Taylor and Mike Sangster were disappointing in losing to Stewart- Douglas 6-2, 6-1. The latter then downed Hoogs-McManus The only two weaknesses in Darlene Hard’s powerful game were a tendency to double-fault and an unsure forehand. Both showed amazing improvement this season. She has a blistering first serve and she puts either slice or twist on her second de- livery. Note the youngster spectating through the hole in the canvas. Photo, Theodore Pettit. in three sets. Laver-Emerson handily beat Mark-Franks to enter the final. Although Stewart and Douglas played well. Laver and Emerson were too strong and they won the title by scores of 6-4, 6-4. The Women’s Doubles Ann Haydon and Darlene Hard had much less trouble reaching the final than did their opponents. Moffitt and Hantze were down 1-4 in the third to Cheney and Diane Wootton, then amassed five games in succession. In the next round, Buding and cute Deidre Catt extended the Wim- bledon Champs to three sets, although the third set was fairly one-sided. The final was won by Hard and Haydon 6-4. 4-6. 6-4, in a match that was started at twilight. The Mixed Doubles The mixed doubles, again held the first week-end of the tournament, acts as a teaser for what will follow during the remainder of the week. Darlene Hard picked up the first of her three winner’s trophies as she teamed successfully with fellow U. S. National Champion Roy Emerson to defeat Jan Lehane and Roger Taylor in the final. As a result of the superb semi-final and quarter-final matches, the final was anticlimactic. In the quarters, Lehane and Taylor won by the narrow margin of 9-7 in the third over Smith-Osuna. and Hard-Emerson defeated Bill Bond-Robyn Ebbern at 7-5 in the third. Catt-Laver also had a 9-7 in the third vic- tory over Moffitt-Franks. Dave Reed defeated UCLA teammate Charlie Pasarell in straight sets to take the Junior title for the second year in a row. It was Charlie’s first Junior loss of the year. Both had won extremely long semi-final matches, which undoubtedly took their toll in the final. Carole Caldwell upset tennis- weary Billie Jean Moffitt in three sets. Carole played ex- tremely well, controlling the rallies most of the time with her change of pace, well-executed lobs and deeply-placed drives. Results on Page 68 PASSING SHOTS by NED POTTER day to comment on the suspension of Dennis Ralston, but as the action of the Executive Committee of the USLTA confirming the decision of the Amateur Rule Committee to extend the suspension until December 31, 1961, was not taken until after the last issue of Wortp Tennis had gone to press, we feel that our readers may be interested in some observations about the case. According to the report of the Referee, M. D. Kallie, Ralston, in the course of the doubles match between Mexico and the United States at Cleveland on Satur- day, August 19, “forcefully threw his racket four times, repeatedly pounded the net with his racket, picked up a ball after point and pounded it into the net four times as hard as he could hit it, repeatedly swore quite audibly and on one occasion yelled ‘G-- D--- it!’ and took several steps toward the stands with menacing gestures. The ultimate in bad conduct was reached when he fell and the Captain of the Mexican team leaped to his assistance and offered him a towel. Ralston spurned this attention with evi- dent distaste.” These are, indeed, serious offenses. apparently committed over the duration of the match, yet no action was taken at any time during the match to warn Ralston or to discipline him on the spot. Neither the Captain of the Davis Cup team nor his assistant on the court, nor the umpire, nor the referee himself, took any action whatever during the play, al- though the referee’s report states that Ralston’s conduct “came in for a terrific lambasting from the newspapers and radio, plus booing, catcalls and vehe- ment remarks from a sell-out gallery.” The whole matter of poor sportsman- ship was the subject of a long discussion at the Annual Meeting of the USLTA last February, following the actions of McKinley and Ralston in Australia which led to McKinley’s suspension un- til May 1 and the probation of both boys for the entire year. At that time, a report of the Research and Planning Committee was adopted which called for “Immediate and appropriate action against players regardless of their rank- ing, guilty of offensive court conduct in tournament or Davis Cup play.” | MAY seem somewhat late in the 24 USLTA Tournament Regulations pro- vide (Section 7 in part) “The (Tour- nament) Committee shall have power, when so convened (by the Ref- eree), if the misconduct of a competitor be reported to them by a member of the Committee, or by an Umpire, to dis- qualify the offender after a hearing.” Also (Section 9) “An Umpire may de- fault a player who, in the opinion of the Umpire, deliberately ignores and re- fuses to follow directions of the Umpire with respect to personal conduct of the player during a match, and such default shall stand unless, on appeal by the player, the Umpire is affirmatively re- versed by the Committee.” Three points are worthy of mention in connection with the foregoing quota- tions: 1—There was no “immediate action.” 2—The Umpire did not default Ral- ston nor warn him that his conduct might lead to a default if continued. 3—The Referee did not convene the Tournament Committee nor did any member of the Committee or the Um- pire report Ralston’s misconduct. The only official report of this mis- conduct is contained in a letter from the Referee to the President of the USLTA, dated Wednesday, August 23, which was four days after the offense occurred. By that time Ralston was entered in the National Doubles at Long- wood where play had commenced on the previous Sunday, August 20, the day after the match in Cleveland in which the offenses occurred. It would appear that, failing immediate action to warn or default Ralston during the course of the match after his first or second offense, the Referee should not have waited four days to submit his re- port. By the time this report reached the Amateur Rule Committee, Ralston and his partner, McKinley, were already playing in the National Doubles and Ralston was also competing in the Mixed Doubles with Darlene Hard. Neverthe- less, a meeting of the Amateur Rule Committee was not convened until Tues- day, August 29, by which time Ralston and McKinley had won the doubles title and Ralston and Hard had reached the final of the mixed which, by agreement, was to be played at Forest Hills duriz the Singles Championships. As reported in a USLTA press lease dated August 31, “because am notification to Ralston prior to the (final doubles) match would have been unfaiy to McKinley, it was decided that , notice to appear before the Committe should not be given Ralston until afte he and McKinley had played the fina match on Monday, August 28.” Meanwhile the draw for the Single Championship in which Ralston had entered was scheduled for Tuesday, Au gust 29, at 10 A.M., although play in the Championship did not commence) until Friday, September 1. Three mem. bers of the Amateur Rule Committee met the same morning to take action on Ralston’s case and received a telegram from him stating that he would be un able to attend the meeting but would be available from Wednesday on. The mem. bers present thereupon, having commu. nicated with the absent members by phone, recommended to the President that Ralston “be declared ineligible to compete in tournaments and matches held under the auspices of the USLTA, pending final action upon such charges by the Executive Committee.” Some questions about this procedure are in order: 1—Although the recommendations for “immediate and appropriate action”’ had been in effect since February, why had no other case of misconduct been called to the attention of the Amateur Rule Committee? It is claimed in extenua tion that this was a Davis Cup match. If misconduct is ignored in local tour naments, why single out a Davis Cup match for action? 2—According to the Rules, the Um pire is in charge of a match. Why did he not join with the Referee in con- demnation of the misconduct cited? 3—Is it possible that no action was taken on the spot in Cleveland, as clear- ly directed in the Rules, in order to give the U. S. team, at that time tied with Mexico at one rubber each, an oppor tunity to win the crucial doubles which they lost in any event? Was it the news paper furor which induced the Referee to make his dramatic accusations four days after the U. S. had finally won the tie? 4—Why was Ralston permitted to play in the National Doubles after his misconduct had been reported? The ac tions “detrimental to the welfare of the game” should have disqualified him then as well as later. 5—Why was the Amateur Rule Com- mittee so hasty in denying Ralston 4 hearing when he had indicated his will ingness to appear the following day? Even if the draw for the singles had been made, it could have been reopened any time before play commenced.

It is certainly time that drastic action be taken to penalize players who display unsportsmanlike conduct on the court, and we hold no brief for Ralston or any other player who misbehaves, whether in a Davis Cup match or a local tourna- ment. We do believe that the handling of this case was ill-considered and auto- cratic and that, in view of the delays and the needless haste to make an exam- ple, the suspension should not have been as severe as it was. It has been said that capital punish- ment has never averted another murder. Similarly, suspension of one player, no matter how prominent, will not stop rowdyism. The solution is to enforce the rules impartially and immediately in every case and to do it on the spot, not after the offender has already entered another tournament.

In the following year the first Closed State Championships were held, with Gardnar Mulloy the winner. Mul- loy won again in 1952, 1953, 1959 and 1960. Other winners have been Malcolm Fox, Al Harum, Gerry Moss, Ben So- bieraj and John Skogstad. Carol Ann Prosen, still a Junior, won the Women’s title in 1959 and 1960. Since 1959 these championships have been held on the Municipal Tennis Courts in Delray Beach. These courts, which are operated and maintained by the Delray Beach Recreation Depart- ment, now consist of nine Teniko Courts in two tiers. The first four courts were laid out in 1941, two others were added in 1945 and three more in 1959. The largest event held on the Munici- pal Courts is the Gulf Stream Junior tournament, which has been held in early May since 1945. Last spring more than 200 junior boys and girls, in 18 year to 11 year classes, took part in this event. The 1961 Florida State Closed Cham- pionships will be held this year on the Municipal Tennis Courts in Delray Beach from November 11 to 12. Ken- neth Jacobsen, Second Vice President of the Florida Lawn Tennis Association, is the chairman of the tournament com- mittee. The Pepsi-Cola plaque will be pre- sented to Mr. Jacobsen on November 12, the final day of the tournament.
