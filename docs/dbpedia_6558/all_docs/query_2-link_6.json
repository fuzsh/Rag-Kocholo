        "text": "Boris Becker (born November 22, 1967, Leimen, near Heidelberg, West Germany [now in Germany]) is a German tennis player who, on July 7, 1985, at age 17, became the youngest champion in the history of the men’s singles at Wimbledon. At the same time, he became the only unseeded player and the only German ever to win the title as well as the youngest person ever to win any Grand Slam title in men’s singles (a mark lowered by four months when Michael Chang won the French Open in 1989).\n\nBecker’s father, an architect, built the hometown tennis club (Blau-Weiss Tennisklub) where Becker learned to play as a child. He started playing competitively at age 8 and began concentrating almost wholly on tennis by age 12; he dropped out of school in the 10th grade (or form) and instead was schooled in the West German Tennis Federation, where his principal coach was Günther Bosch, a Romanian-born German.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nBecker burst onto the international tennis scene at age 17 at the Wimbledon Championships in 1985. With powerful serves and an attacking style, he overpowered his opponents, advancing to the finals, where he defeated Kevin Curren in four sets. Excelling on the fast grass surface, he won Wimbledon again in 1986 and 1989 and was a finalist there in 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1995. He won the Australian Open twice (1991, 1996) and the U.S. Open (1989). In international tennis, he was a member of West Germany’s and then Germany’s Davis Cup squads (1985–99), helping the team to victories in 1988 and 1989; he served as the team’s manager in 1997. He also captured an Olympic gold medal in doubles in 1992 at the Barcelona Games.\n\nBecker retired from competitive tennis in 1999; during his career he had won 49 singles and 15 doubles titles. He subsequently became involved in various business ventures. Becker also worked as a TV commentator, and from 2013 to 2016 he coached Novak Djokovic, who won six Grand Slam titles during that time. However, Becker faced various legal problems. In 2002 he was convicted of tax evasion in Germany. He received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to pay a fine. In 2017 Becker filed for bankruptcy in England, but he was later accused of hiding assets and loans. A trial ended with his conviction in 2022, and he received a prison sentence of two years and six months. However, Becker was released in December after serving just eight months. He immediately returned to his home country of Germany.\n\nBecker was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2003. The autobiography Boris Becker: The Player (2004) details his professional and personal life, including his high-profile marriage and divorce from model Barbara Feltus and his alcohol and drug addiction."
