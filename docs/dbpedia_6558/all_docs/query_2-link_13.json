        "text": "Every year, the US Open draws thousands of tennis fans to New York for the greatest summer spectacular. The women’s tennis championship starts with 128 players competing for the final 16 spots in the main draw, but only one player takes home the trophy. With the 2023 US Open having just wrapped, let’s take a look back at the past 10 winners of the US Open Women’s Tennis Championship who got to raise the trophy at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nWomen’s US Open Tennis Champions\n\n2023 Winner: Coco Gauff\n\nAt the 2023 US Open, 19-year old American Coco Gauff won her first Grand Slam title after defeating the world No. 1 player in women’s singles Aryna Sabalenka with a score of 2-6, 6–3, 6–2.\n\n2022 Winner: Iga Swiatek\n\nIn the 2022 US Open women’s final, Iga Świątek battled past Ons Jabeur 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) for her second Grand Slam win of the season.\n\n2021 Winner: Emma Raducanu\n\nIt was a battle between teenage upstarts Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez at the 2021 US Open. British qualifier Raducanu defeated Fernandez in the final, 6-4, 6-3, to win her first Grand Slam title.\n\n2020 Winner: Naomi Osaka\n\nJapan’s Naomi Osaka won her second US Open singles title in just three years at the 2020 US Open, defeating Victoria Azarenka 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. Osaka also became the first woman since Arantxa Sánchez-Vicario in 1994 to win the US Open after dropping the first set.\n\n2019 Winner: Bianca Andreescu\n\nCanadian tennis player Bianca Andreescu won her first Grand Slam trophy at the 2019 US Open. She defeated 23-time winner Serena Williams 6-3, 7-5.\n\n2018 Winner: Naomi Osaka\n\nIn a breakout performance at the 2018 US Open, Naomi Osaka defeated Serena Williams 6-2, 6-4 to become Japan’s first-ever tennis player to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Kerber, who won the Australian Open that same year, became the first player to win bouth hard court majors in the same year since Martina Hingis in 1997.\n\n2015 Winner: Flavia Pennetta\n\nItaly’s Flavia Pennetta beat fellow Italian, and her childhood friend, Roberta Vinci 7-6 (4), 6-2 for her first Grand Slam championship title. At age 34, Pennetta became the oldest first-time Grand Slam champion in the US Open. Shortly after her win, Pennetta announced she would retire from tennis.\n\n2014 Winner: Serena Williams\n\nAt the 2014 US Open, No. 1 seed Serena Williams defeated No. 10 Caroline Wozniacki 6–3, 6–3 for her third consecutive and sixth overall women’s singles title. This win also marked the 18th Grand Slam singles title for Williams.\n\n2013 Winner: Serena Williams\n\nDefending champion Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka met again at the 2013 US Open. Williams defeated Azarenka 7-5, 6-7, 6-1 in a rematch of the previous year’s final.\n\n2012 Winner: Serena Williams\n\nSerena Williams earned her 15th career Grand Slam singles title at the 2012 US Open, beating No. 1 Victoria Azarenka 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.
