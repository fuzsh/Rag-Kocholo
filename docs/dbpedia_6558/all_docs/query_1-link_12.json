        "text": "Drama and Beauty\n\nThe Games were blessed with many outstanding heroines, but none more so than Vera Caslavska. The attractive and vivacious Czech gymnast won four golds and two silver medals. Her victories were dramatic: defeating Soviet gymnasts two months after the Soviet invasion of her homeland.\n\nNOCs: 112\n\nAthletes: 5,516 (781 women, 4,435 men)\n\nEvents: 172\n\nVolunteers: N/A\n\nMedia: N/A\n\nThe German Athletes\n\nThe athletes from the German Democratic Republic competed in their own team under the name of “East Germany”. It was only in 1972 that they took part under the official name of their country, “German Democratic Republic”.\n\nIn the Footsteps of Columbus\n\nThe itinerary of the Olympic torch relay followed in the footsteps of Christopher Columbus, tracing the route of his first journey from Spain to the New World.\n\nA Special Year\n\nThe year 1968 was extremely important from a political point of view. The People’s Republic of China found itself in the midst of the Cultural Revolution. The attempt to liberalize Czechoslovakia was crushed by Soviet troops. The French government was caught up in student demonstrations, and throughout the United States, peace and civil rights demonstrations were taking place. Mexico was not forgotten in this wave of revolution: students and teachers were on strike and held large protest rallies, bloodily repressed at the Square of Three Cultures.\n\n“Black Power”\n\nOver and above winning medals, the Black American athletes made names for themselves by an act of racial protest. During the medal presentation ceremony, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medal winners in the 200m, raised a black-gloved fist and hung their heads when their country’s national anthem was played. In doing this, they were protesting against racial segregation in the United States and were subsequently expelled from the Olympic Village.\n\nThe Appearance of Tartan\n\nA synthetic material (tartan) was used for the first time on the athletics track.\n\nOfficial Timing\n\nThe athletics, cycling, rowing, canoe, swimming and equestrian competitions were timed manually and electronically. For the first time, the electronic time was the official one.\n\nCeremonies\n\n12 October 1968, Mexico, Opening Ceremony. Enriqueta Basilio de Sotelo (MEX) climbs with the Olympic torch.\n\nOfficial Opening of the Games by:\n\nPresident Gustavo Diaz Ordaz\n\nLighting the Olympic Flame by:\n\nNorma Enriqueta Basilio de Sotelo (athletics)\n\nOlympic Oath by:\n\nPablo Lugo Garrido (athletics)\n\nOfficials' Oath by:\n\nThe officials' oath at an Olympic Summer Games was first sworn in 1972 in Munich."
