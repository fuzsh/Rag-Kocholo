The 2024 French Open begins on Sunday at Roland-Garros in Paris with the final set to take place on June 9.

The clay Major was the first one to join the Open Era in 1968, allowing both amateurs and professionals to participate at the event. Since then, 31 different women have lifted the coveted Suzanne-Lenglen Cup.

USA’s Chris Evert holds the record for most French Open titles (7) by a woman followed by Germany’s Steffi Graf (6).

Poland’s Iga Swiatek won her third French Open title and fourth Major overall with a 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Karolina Muchova in the final of the 2023 edition.
