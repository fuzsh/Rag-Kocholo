        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- As the NBA 2020-21 season kicks off, the Cleveland Cavaliers will once again rely on young talent in an effort to take the next step in developing the franchise.\n\nNow, with Tristan Thompson gone, Kevin Love is the longest-tenured Cavalier, entering his seventh season in Cleveland. However, he is not expected to play in the opener due to a strained right calf injury. If Love remains unavailable it is likely that Larry Nance Jr. will replace him in the starting lineup."
