        "text": "Just having a little fun with it.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors introduced Mike Dunleavy Jr. as their new general manager Monday as the former NBA player and son of former NBA head coach Mike Dunleavy is replacing Bob Myers.\n\nDunleavy Jr. was asked about the Suns acquiring Bradley Beal in a blockbuster trade in terms of whether that will \"change\" his approach to the team.\n\n\"What's the deal?\" a smiling Dunleavy Jr. said.\n\nThe Suns are trading Chris Paul, Landry Shamet, multiple second-round picks and a pick swap to Washington for Isaiah Todd, Jordan Goodwin and Beal, sources have informed The Republic.\n\nBradley Beal trade grades: NBA title or bust for Phoenix Suns with Washington Wizards deal\n\n\"Look, we're aware of all the stuff going on around us in the league as far as trades and rumors, all that stuff,\" Dunleavy Jr. continued. \"But we're pretty focused on our own team.\"\n\nDunleavy concluded by asking Warriors team owner Joe Lacob if he had any \"comments on theoretical trades that actually haven't gone through yet?\"\n\nIn reaction, a smiling Lacob said, \"No. Thanks for the hint.\"\n\nThe Warriors and Suns are both coming off losing in the Western Conference semifinals. Golden State fell the Los Angeles Lakers while the Suns lost to the eventual NBA champion Denver Nuggets.\n\n'I was surprised, too': Chris Paul learned about trade on plane ride to New York for GMA appearance\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
