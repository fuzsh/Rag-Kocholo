        "text": "Team USA basketball coach Steve Kerr says there is \"no thought\" of replacing Kevin Durant in the Olympic squad despite him suffering with a calf strain.\n\nThe USA played their final warm-up game ahead of the Games, with LeBron James starring as they beat Germany 92-88 in London on Monday to make it five wins on the bounce.\n\nHowever, Durant has not played in any of those five pre-Olympic games due to a right calf injury he sustained while training last month.\n\nDespite stepping up his training in the last week, he is still a doubt for their opener against Serbia on Sunday.\n\nKerr has until Saturday to finalise his roster for the Games, and insisted he would not be calling up a replacement for Durant, who he hopes will get to train with the rest of the team when they travel to Paris.\n\n\"There's no thought of replacing Kevin,\" Kerr said. \"I was hoping he would get a game in here, but it just didn't work out that way.\n\n\"When he missed time, he came right back - and he is who he is.\n\n\"He's one of the most skilled players of all time. So, we hope he comes back soon, and I think he'll fit right in.\"\n\nThe USA are aiming to win a fifth consecutive gold medal at this year's Olympics, and will also face South Sudan and Puerto Rico in Group C.\n\nLeBron James has been named Team USA's male flagbearer for the Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nA two-time gold medallist in 2008 and 2012, the NBA legend was selected by his fellow Olympians ahead of what will be his fourth Games in Paris.\n\nJames, who also won bronze in Athens 20 years ago, is the first men's basketball player to achieve the honour.\n\nThe 39-year-old will lead his 591 fellow Team USA athletes along the River Seine in what will be the first summer Olympic opening ceremony held outside the main stadium.\n\n\"It's an incredible honour to represent the United States on this global stage,\" James said, \"especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together.\n\n\"For a kid from Akron, this responsibility means everything to not only myself but to my family, all the kids in my hometown, my team-mates, fellow Olympians and so many people across the country with big aspirations.\"\n\nFour-time NBA champion James, who is also the record points scorer in the league's history, will look to help Team USA to a fifth successive gold in the men's basketball - and 17th overall.\n\nThey begin their campaign against Serbia on Sunday while also playing South Sudan and Puerto Rico in Group C, with all their matches taking place at the Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille.\n\nSam Hauser has agreed to a four-year, $45million contract extension with the Boston Celtics, his agent told ESPN on Sunday.\n\nHauser signed with the Celtics in 2021 as an undrafted rookie and has since established himself as one of the NBA's most accurate 3-point shooters.\n\nHis current rookie contract is due to expire in 2025, but this extension will keep him with the team until the end of the 2028-29 season.\n\nHauser shot 42.4% on 3-pointers last season, the fourth-best in the league among players with over 400 attempts, and became just the third player in Celtics history to make 10 3-pointers in a game in 2023-24.\n\nThe 26-year-old also made 179 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, the sixth most in the NBA.\n\nHis extension is the third of the offseason already, with All-NBA forward Jayson Tatum signing a $315million five-year deal and guard Derrick White committing to $125million over four years."
