        "text": "On Thursday, the Golden State Warriors hired Mike Dunleavy -- former Chicago Bulls small forward -- to become their next general manager, according to ESPN.\n\nDunleavy, 42, was hired by the Warriors in 2018 as a pro scout. In 2019, the Warriors promoted him to assistant general manger; then Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2021; now he succeeds Bob Myers as the Warriors' general manager.\n\nMyers was an outstanding general manager and President for the Warriors, leaving Dunleavy big shoes to fill. Over Myers' nine-year run with the Warriors, he earned a record of 474-237 with three NBA championships and seven playoff berths. He was the mastermind behind the Warriors' dynasty.\n\nDunleavy played for the Bulls between 2013-2016. He averaged 9.9 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game between 176 total games played between three seasons.\n\nHe played 17 seasons in the NBA, starting out with the Warriors for the first four years of his career."
