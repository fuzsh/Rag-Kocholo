        "text": "Mike Dunleavy Jr., who was just traded from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Atlanta Hawks as part of a package for sharpshooter Kyle Korver. Dunleavy Jr. was reportedly initially interested in the team buying him out, but after speaking with head coach Mike Budenholzer, the sweet-shooting wing has reportedly “made peace” with the idea:\n\nDunleavy Jr. will no longer seek a buyout:\n\nDunleavy Jr. reportedly registered interest from superior teams such as the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, so the fact that he’s content to stay with the Hawks after just one meeting likely says a lot about the impact of his relationship with coach Budenholzer.\n\nDunleavy, 36, is a career 37.6 percent three-point shooter and has eclipsed the 40 percent mark in four separate seasons in his 15-year career."
