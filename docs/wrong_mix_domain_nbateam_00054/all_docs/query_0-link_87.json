        "text": "CLEVELAND: Mike Dunleavy’s shooting slump to start the season is deepening and not even a spot start was enough to jump-start his shot.\n\nDunleavy started Sunday in place of J.R. Smith, who missed the game with a sore right ankle. Smith turned it during Friday’s win at Washington, although he was able to remain in the game. But his foot was sore when he arrived at the arena Sunday and was still walking gingerly as he departed after the game. But the Cavaliers don’t believe it’s serious and didn’t even bother to take X-rays.\n\nCoach Tyronn Lue chose Dunleavy to start over Iman Shumpert, believing the matchup against the Hornets was favorable to Dunleavy and might spark a turnaround for him. Instead, Dunleavy shot 1-of-6 (0-of-3 on 3-pointers) and is now shooting just 27 percent from deep (7-of-26). He is a career 37-percent 3-point shooter.\n\nLue said he thinks Dunleavy just needs time to adapt to his new role.\n\n“He’s a great shooter and he’s always been over his career,” Lue said. “You come from playing 32, 34 minutes and being a starter and now you’re coming off the bench when you’re playing 16 minutes a game, it’s tough to try to find your rhythm.”\n\nGuys like Dunleavy and Richard Jefferson (4-of-17 from 3) are part of the reason Lue believes the Cavs will eventually shoot the ball better than they have.\n\n“We know he’s a great shooter,” Lue said of Dunleavy. “And when he’s open, we want him to take those open shots. We’re going to continue to play him to get him in a good rhythm.”\n\nRemember when?\n\nThere was a debate at one time between who the Cavs should draft in 2011, Kyrie Irving or Brandon Knight. Turns out, Kemba Walker just might be the second-best point guard to come out of the class.\n\nIrving was clearly the right choice with the No. 1 overall pick despite some fans wanting the Cavs to select Derrick Williams first and Knight fourth — which in hindsight would’ve been a disaster. Williams and Knight have combined to play for seven teams since entering the league, while Irving and Walker remain with the franchises who drafted them.\n\nWalker is two years older than Irving and averaging career highs in points, field-goal percentage and 3-point shooting. His 21 points in Sunday’s loss make it eight consecutive games in which he has scored at least 20 points as he continues to try breaking into an elite point guard class.\n\n“I think he’s figured it out,” Lue said of Walker. “His shooting has gotten a lot better from the 3-point range. Midrange, he was already a great shooter. But shooting 46 to 47 percent from 3 now … I just think the game has really slowed down for him. He understands the NBA game now and he’s tough to deal with.”\n\nDribbles\n\nJefferson’s next basket will be the 5,000th of his career. … Tristan Thompson grabbed 12 rebounds Sunday. … Shumpert’s 15 points tied his season high. … Channing Frye is shooting 50 percent (19-of-38) on 3-pointers in his last six games."
