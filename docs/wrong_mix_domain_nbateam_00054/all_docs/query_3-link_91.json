        "text": "It’s a great time to be a professional athlete.\n\nWith revenue booming in sports, players are using their earnings to reinvest in other leagues by becoming minority owners for different teams.\n\nCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was the latest star to join an ownership group, purchasing a stake in the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\n\nAside from Garrett, here are 20 current and former athletes who own professional teams:\n\nPatrick Mahomes: Kansas City Royals (MLB), Sporting Kansas City (MLS), Kansas City Current (NWSL), Alpine F1 Team (F1)\n\nThe reigning NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP has a wide-ranging portfolio. He has planted his flag in Kansas City, joining ownership groups for the MLB, MLS and NWSL teams in the city. The Chiefs’ quarterback most recently joined Alpine F1 Team as an investor alongside Travis Kelce, Rory McIlroy and Ryan Reynolds.\n\nLeBron James: Boston Red Sox (MLB), Pittsburgh Penguins (NHL), Liverpool FC (EPL), RFK Racing (NASCAR)\n\nJames, 38, is already set up well for his post-playing career. The 19-time NBA All-Star joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner in 2021, which in turn made him a part-owner of FSG’s ventures in baseball, hockey, soccer and stock car racing.\n\nMichael Jordan: Charlotte Hornets (NBA), 23XI Racing (NASCAR)\n\nIn 2006, Jordan became a minority owner in the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets (then Bobcats). He became the Hornets’ majority owner in 2010 before selling his majority stake in 2023, while maintaining a minority share. Elsewhere, His Airness debuted as a NASCAR team owner in 2021 and has since become a mainstay at race tracks supporting his two cars.\n\nMagic Johnson: Los Angeles Dodgers (MLB), Washington Commanders (NFL), Los Angeles Sparks (WNBA), Los Angeles FC (MLS)\n\nJohnson is one of the faces of sports in Los Angeles after starring for the Lakers. Now, he co-owns the MLB’s Dodgers, WNBA’s Sparks and MLS’s LAFC. In 2023, the five-time NBA champion invested $240 million in a group led by Josh Harris to purchase the Washington Commanders.\n\nTom Brady: Las Vegas Aces (WNBA), Birmingham City FC (EFL Championship)\n\nSince retiring after the 2022 NFL season, Brady has quickly built his portfolio. He partnered with Mark Davis to become a minority owner in the Las Vegas Aces, who subsequently won their second straight WNBA title. He also became a minority owner and chairman of Birmingham City FC, which is currently one level below the Premier League. Brady is also set to buy a stake in the Las Vegas Raiders once other NFL owners approve of the deal.\n\nSerena Williams: Miami Dolphins (NFL), Angel City FC (NWSL)\n\nThe recently-retired Williams has owned a minority stake in the Miami Dolphins with her sister Venus since 2009. In 2020, she was announced as part of a massive investment group in a new NWSL team, Angel City FC. Other athletes involved with the women’s soccer club include Candace Parker, Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Julie Foudy and Billie Jean King, among others.\n\nKevin Durant: Philadelphia Union (MLS), NJ/NY Gotham FC (NWSL)\n\nKD is all-in on soccer in the U.S. He bought a 5% stake in the Philadelphia Union in 2020, then joined Gotham FC in 2022 as an investor. The NWSL franchise, like Angel City FC, has a number of big name investors: Durant, Sue Bird, Carli Lloyd and Eli Manning, among others.\n\nAlex Rodriguez: Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA), Minnesota Lynx (WNBA)\n\nRodriguez and Marc Lore are in the process of becoming majority owners of Minneapolis’ professional basketball teams. They currently own 40% of the clubs. This came after an unsuccessful attempt to buy the MLB’s New York Mets.\n\nAaron Rodgers: Milwaukee Bucks (NBA)\n\nEven though he no longer plays in Wisconsin, Rodgers is still connected to the state. In 2018, he purchased a minority stake in the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: Milwaukee Brewers (MLB)\n\nWhile Rodgers owns part of the Bucks, the Bucks’ biggest star owns part of the Brewers. Antetokounmpo joined the Brewers’ ownership group in 2021.\n\nDavid Beckham: Inter Miami CF (MLS)\n\nThe retired English soccer star has grown the sport in America since signing with the LA Galaxy back in 2007. Beckham, along with Jorge and Jose Mas, founded Inter Miami CF in 2018 and made major headlines by signing Lionel Messi in 2023.\n\nDwayne Wade: Utah Jazz (NBA)\n\nWade purchased an ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021, joining new team owner Ryan Smith. The Hall of Famer has attended a number of games in Salt Lake City since the purchase.\n\nJames Harden and Oscar De La Hoya: Houston Dynamo (MLS), Houston Dash (NWSL)\n\nNow this is an unlikely duo. Harden, an NBA MVP and De La Hoya, a world champion boxer, joined these ownership groups at different times. Harden joined in 2019, while De La Hoya has been involved since 2007.\n\nMarshawn Lynch: Seattle Kraken (NHL)\n\nThe newest NHL franchise has a pair of iconic Seattle minority owners. Lynch, a former Seattle Seahawks running back, and musician Macklemore were announced as minority owners in 2022 following the Kraken’s debut season.\n\nNaomi Osaka: North Carolina Courage (NWSL)\n\nOsaka, a four-time Grand Slam singles champion, is another celebrity owner in the NWSL. The Japanese tennis star joined the North Carolina Courage’s ownership group in 2021.\n\nJ.J. Watt: Burnley FC (EPL)\n\nA few months after retiring from the NFL, Watt and his wife Kealia Ohai became minority owners of Burnley FC. The club received a promotion to the Premier League for the 2023-24 season.\n\nMario Lemieux: Pittsburgh Penguins (NHL)\n\nTwo years after retiring as a Penguin, Lemieux bought the club in 1999. He served as their principal owner, and returned to the ice as a player from 2000-2005, before selling his majority stake to Fenway Sports Group in 2021. Lemieux still retains minority ownership in the club.\n\nSteve Nash: Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS)\n\nWhile still playing in the NBA in 2011, Nash joined a group of investors to establish the MLS club in his native British Columbia. He still holds a role with the club, which has qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs six times in its history.\n\nWarrick Dunn: Atlanta Falcons (NFL)\n\nDunn, a 12-year veteran NFL running back, purchased a minority stake in the Atlanta Falcons in 2009 -- one year after he retired."
