        "text": "Introduction\n\nAround 2 weeks go, the Bob Myers era in Golden State officially came to a close. Myers cited his primary reason being that he had other interests outside of just basketball, and his off the court projects would unfairly take his attention away from the Golden State Warriors organization. The Warriors were quick to find his replacement, with Mike Dunleavy Jr. being announced as his replacement a few days after Myers’s resignation. Dunleavy got straight to work as General Manager, making a shocking trade for Chris Paul that would send Jordan Poole, Ryan Hollins, and Patrick Baldwin Jr. to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Chris Paul. This move drew harsh criticism from many NBA fans and media outlets (especially those that were/are fans of the Golden State Warriors), but I for one think that Mike Dunleavy Jr. may actually be on the right track to bringing Golden State back to relevancy.\n\nChris Paul????\n\nIf you were not aware a week ago, this trade should have reminded you that it is not 2014 anymore. Around this time last week, the entire NBA world was shocked with the news that the Golden State Warriors were finalizing a deal to send Washington’s Chris Paul to Golden State in exchange for Golden State’s most promising young star, Jordan Poole. Contractually speaking, this trade makes perfect sense, seeing that Golden State gets rid of their horrible contract that they gave to Poole for a big name in the league, and Jordan Poole is still able to get his money from a team that can actually afford him. The concerning thing about this trade is that Golden State traded away their potential successor to Stephen Curry for 38 year-old Chris Paul, who has been injury prone the last 3 years of his career. Everywhere Paul goes, an immediate impact is made, but recently, he is not able to stay healthy enough to finish the job he started. Chris Paul also does not add anything shot creation wise to this Golden State team that could make up for the loss of Poole, which could spell bad news for the Warriors in the playoffs if they make a deep run. The Chris Paul trade was a very risky move by Mike Dunleavy Jr. to say the least, but I do think there are some upsides to the trade that are not being talked about enough. Age aside, Chris Paul is still one of the best facilitators in the league, and he provides a much needed spark off the bench to create offense for Golden State’s weapons. While Jordan Poole is a marvel to watch when he is hot, his issues and lack of basketball IQ were highlighted to an almost egregious extent due to Jordan never having “that” game the entire 2022–23 NBA Playoffs. Poole consistently killed the momentum that Stephen Curry created for Golden State early, took forced shot after forced shot, made costly turnovers on the offensive end, and had no presence or intensity on the defensive end in order to make up for his lackluster offense. While Chris Paul is virtually obsolete on the defensive end (though he will get more steals than Poole), he does provide great playmaking, clutch shot making, and veteran experience that Golden State does not have outside of their core three members. Chris will be able to help the younger guys such as Moody, Kuminga, Podziemski, and Jackson-Davis flourish in the second unit. Going off of history, Chris Paul should take the play of the second unit to a whole other level, which is something that Jordan Poole was never going to do in this Golden State team. Chris Paul also takes the playmaking responsibilities off of Stephen Curry, who can now go back to solely focusing on getting open, instead of facilitating for the entire team + getting his game going as well. As a Golden State fan, I wish Jordan Poole the best on the Washington Wizards, and hope he flourishes in Washington as their starting point guard. I will also say that as a Warriors fan, Chris Paul currently (if he stays healthy) can potentially have many more upsides on this Warriors roster than Poole ever had, and I feel that is a chance the Golden State Warriors are more than willing to take.\n\nGolden State’s Newest Members\n\nOne thing that can be said about the Golden State Warriors since 2009 is that their scouts have an incredible eye for talent. Outside of James Wiseman, almost every player the Warriors have drafted since Stephen Curry has had a positive impact on the team, whether it be in the form Klay Thompson, Jonathan Kuminga, Jordan Poole, Draymond Green (that order was in fact intentional), or Moses Moody. While the Warriors did not get a crazy steal in this year’s draft (that would go to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the form of Emoni Bates), this Golden State scouting team was still able to add pieces to this roster that may show up big down the line. With their 19th Pick, the Warriors drafted Brandin Podziemski, a guard out of Santa Clara, who has the potential to be a big spark off the bench for the Warriors, and also add more perimeter defense to the Warriors, which never hurts any team. Last season, Brandin averaged approximately 20/9/4 on over 42% from three, so he fits right into the primary gameplan of Golden State. In the second round, the Warriors drafted Trayce Jackson-Davis, a forward out of Indiana (who I was surprised dropped all the way down to pick 57), which hopefully is the start of Golden State addressing their lack of size. Last year, Jackson-Davis averaged approximately 21/11/4 shooting over 58% from the field, giving Golden State a much needed boost in the paint, and help for Kevon Looney off of the bench. As aforementioned, most of Golden State’s drafted talent tends to help big on the team (it got them 4 rings), and I see Brandin and Trayce only adding to that trend this coming season.\n\nJob’s Not Finished\n\nWhile the Golden State Warriors have made some decent moves already this offseason, the FO’s job is far from over if they want to become championship contenders like they were two years ago. With the Denver Nuggets winning this year’s NBA Championship, top contending teams are going to try and get bigger, and Golden State should follow suit. In the past, Golden State has dominated the league while being a smaller team, but the Los Angeles Lakers exposed the fact that Golden State is simply too small to win an NBA Championship as currently constructed. Bigs such as Brook Lopez and Nikola Vucevic would be my top targets if I am the Warriors, since they are both bigs who can spread out the floor and still fit into Golden State’s primary weapon of the three ball, but guys like Mason Plumlee, Jakob Poeltl, and Andre Drummond can also provide the size Golden State desperately needs for a much cheaper price tag. Kevon Looney is one of the best rebounders in the league, and in general one of the most underrated big men in the association, but it would be asinine for the Warriors to have as their only option to stop guys such as Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Warriors’s forward position also needs some depth, because as it stands, Draymond Green is the best forward on the Golden State offense in the playoffs post Kevin Durant. Sure, you can give Kuminga more minutes until he’s ready for the big stage, but that development will at least take a couple more years, even with Chris Paul. This position is especially in need of filling since Patrick Baldwin Jr. was a part of the Chris Paul package, meaning the Warriors have little to nothing for guys like Aaron Gordon, Rui Hachimura, and Kevin Durant when they get going. Kyle Kuzma (if they can afford it) would be an amazing piece for Golden State to have, since he is a fairly long forward who can fit right into the snipers of Golden State, but also get buckets in the paint when needed. If not Kyle, guys like Dwight Powell, Christian Woods, Dario Saric, and Wenyen Gabriel are all free agents who Golden State can potentially sign (not all four of course) to add that defensive cushion in the forward position, who can also provide a scoring presence in the paint. Extending Draymond Green should be the Warrior’s top priority, since they cannot make any real moves until they see how much money they have left over, but beefing this current roster up is a must if they want a shot at getting their 5th ring in 9 years.\n\nConclusion"
