        "text": "Mike Dunleavy Jr. has long been a thorn in the Cavs’ side. His 15-year career includes a decade with division foes in Chicago, Indiana and Milwaukee, where his long-range shooting and pestering defense often brought groans from the seats at The Q. But the 36-year-old veteran, whose father Mike Dunleavy Sr. played and coached in the NBA, was acquired in a July trade from the Bulls. He’ll help fill the tough-nosed void left by Matthew Dellavedova. We caught up with Dunleavy at Cavs media day.\n\nQ:What’s it like to know that LeBron James said he wants you on his team?\n\nA: He said that? Well, it’s flattering. I have a lot of respect for LeBron, with everything he’s accomplished and the way he approaches the game. He knows what’s going on. We’ve played against each other for quite a few years now and know each other pretty well as competitors. I’m looking forward to finally getting to know him as a teammate.\n\nQ: How much did your father influence your career?\n\nA: I remember getting to be around him when he was finishing up his playing career — when I was 4 or 5 years old — then more when he started coaching. Being around those different settings, the practices and games, was a big help. How could it not be? You’re a kid and you get to be around the NBA all the time. It molded me into the player I am today. To have a dad in the business was a really cool thing for a kid.\n\nQ: How can you help the team?\n\nA: I see myself being involved in whatever way, shape or form we need. It’s as simple as that. I can play a lot of different roles, anything necessary to get these guys back to the mountaintop. I’m just happy to be here. After that trade, it was like Christmas in July for me."
