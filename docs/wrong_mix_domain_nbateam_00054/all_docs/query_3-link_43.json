        "text": "By TOM WITHERS\n\nNew York Knicks assistant Johnnie Bryant is joining new Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson’s staff, a person familiar with the hiring told The Associated Press on July 6.\n\nBryant, who interviewed for the Cavaliers’ opening before Atkinson was hired, will be an associate head coach, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the addition.\n\nBryant will be reunited in Cleveland with Cavs All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell They spent several years working together in Utah, and Mitchell has often credited the 29-year-old Bryant with making him a better player.\n\nMitchell agreed this week to a three-year, $150.3 million contract extension with the Cavs. His commitment came just days after Cleveland hired Atkinson, the former Brooklyn coach who spent the past three seasons as an assistant with Golden State.\n\nBryant spent six seasons with the Jazz. He went to New York in 2020, when it appeared Mitchell might be headed to the Knicks in a trade before the Cavs pulled off a blockbuster deal to acquire the 27-year-old.\n\nAtkinson is still completing his staff, but has already added former Lakers assistant Jordan Ott and former NBA player DeMarre Carroll. Ott is coaching Cleveland’s Summer League team in Las Vegas.\n\nESPN previously reported Bryant’s hiring by the Cavs.\n\nCleveland fired coach J.B. Bickerstaff after being eliminated in the playoffs."
