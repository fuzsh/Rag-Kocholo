Dunleavy became a pro scout for the Warriors in 2018 once he wrapped up his 15-year playing career during which he spent 2002 through part of '07 with Golden State.\n\nThe Warriors selected him with the third overall draft pick in 2002 out of Duke.\n\nNBA SUSPENDS GRIZZLIES' JA MORANT 25 GAMES AFTER SECOND GUN INCIDENT ONLINE: 'ALARMING AND DISCONCERTING'\n\n\"We think Mike is the perfect fit to lead our basketball operations department,\" Lacob said. \"He has a wealth of basketball knowledge, stemming from his family upbringing, a 15-year NBA playing career and five seasons serving under Bob Myers in our front office. He’s young and energetic, has established numerous relationships around the league and communicates well with players and coaches—all important traits in this business.
