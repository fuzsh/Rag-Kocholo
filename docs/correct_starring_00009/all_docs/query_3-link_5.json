        "text": "Morgan Freeman turns 87 on June 1. I’d like to formally wish a happy birthday to one of the most prolific actors of our time! I thought it would be fun to list my 5 favorite Morgan Freeman movies of all time. But, upon a quick IMDB search, I realized that there are far too many Morgan Freeman movies that I haven’t seen.\n\nNot to worry, most of the movies he’s been in have been great ones, so I’m excited to embark on a Morgan Freeman movie-watching binge. With 152 films and counting, that’s going to take a lot of time. So, until then, I feel like I can settle on a few favorites.\n\nMorgan Freeman Is Also Known For His Voice Acting\n\nI’m not including the things for which he has provided his very recognizable voice. It’s pretty much widely agreed upon that his narrations are the best in the business. If there were a movie made about my life, I’d definitely want him narrating it. I can hear him now: “…it was at this point that Kris realized that he wasn’t wearing any pants and that everyone was laughing at him, not with him.”\n\nMorgan Freeman Is A Very Accomplished Southern Man\n\nBorn in Memphis and raised in Mississippi, where he now resides, Morgan Freeman has too many accomplishments to list. But, some highlights are an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Tony nomination, he’s been awarded the Kennedy Center Honor, an AFI Life Achievement Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award and the Screen Actor’s Guild Life Achievement Award, just to name a few.\n\nMorgan Freeman has a lot of different kinds of movies in his catalogue, some fun, some serious, some meaningful and some silly. I like all of these kinds of movies. But, this is a top 5, so I’ll do my best to narrow it down."
