        "text": "At the center of Glory is the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first African-American regiment in the history of the United States. Commanded by the white Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), they are assigned menial tasks. Getting the opportunity to serve their country more significantly requires a fight, during which they encounter prejudice even from people on their side.\n\nFreeman plays John Rawlins, a gravedigger who serves as the person in the group who has a lot of wisdom and an ability to see things as they are. His insights help his fellow soldiers to carry on in the face of odds that often seem insurmountable, both from the enemy and from within. They respond to his calming presence and ability to motivate.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “We runaway slaves but we come back fightin' men. Go tell your folks how kingdom come in the year of jubilee!”\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption was not a box office hit, although it has become a widely-regarded classic in the years following its release. Freeman is Red, an inmate at Shawshank Prison. He befriends the newest arrival, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is there for a offense he probably didn't commit.\n\nRed becomes a support and a confidante to Andy during the course of the story. The realities of prison life - from a mean warden to fellow inmates who engage in bullying - wear on Andy, yet Red is always there to keep his spirits up. And since Andy is hatching a plan to escape, Red also acts as a beacon of hope, rooting for his friend to succeed.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “Get busy living, or get busy dying. That’s g*ddamn right.\"\n\nLet's be honest - not every actor can play God. Doing so requires a certain gravitas or iconic status. George Burns famously pulled it off, and so did Morgan Freeman. In Bruce Almighty, he plays the Lord, who hands over his powers to ordinary guy Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) as a way of proving his job isn't as easy as it looks. Hilarity ensues.\n\nIt works because Freeman has a naturally commanding presence. He's well-regarded by everyone, has a diverse resume, and carries himself in a manner that indicates great intelligence and seriousness of purpose. Carrey might be the big laugh-getter - aside from one scene-taking moment courtesy of Steve Carell - but Freeman is the glue that holds Bruce Almighty together. He offers a portrait of God as a caring figure, looking out for every single one of his children on Earth and offering subtle, silent guidance to those in need.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “People want me to do everything for them. But what they don't realize is they have the power. You want to see a miracle, son? Be the miracle.”\n\nLean On Me is based on an uplifting true story. Freeman plays Joe Clark, the new principal at East Side High, the lowest-ranked high school in the state of New Jersey. He's been brought in to turn things around. Recognizing that education is difficult with so many organizations and illicit substances in the hallways, Clark starts the process of cleaning up - with the help of a baseball bat.\n\nThe role is a great fit for the actor, who brings his natural sense of authority to Clark. He conveys a no-nonsense determination to make the school better, but also a genuine sense of compassion for the students there. Through his efforts, the character sends a message to the pupils and the audience that change is possible, even when it seems unlikely.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “We call our East Side teams ‘Ghosts’, don't we? And what are ghosts? Ghosts are spirits that rise from the dead. I want you to be my ghosts. You are going to lead our resurrection, by defying the expectation that all of us are doomed to failure.”\n\nEdward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman) have something in common - terminal lung cancer. The men meet in a hospital room, form a connection, and then agree to make a “bucket list” of experiences they want to have before they pass. Together, they cross those things off one by one, from skydiving to racing on the California Speedway. That's the premise of the dark comedy The Bucket List.\n\nCarter is an inspiring character because, rather than letting grief over his diagnosis get him down, he opts for hope. In his remaining time, he performs a series of activities that bring him joy and make those final days meaningful. The optimism Freeman brings to the role is heartwarming, as well as a gentle reminder for the audience to make every day count.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “I believe that you measure yourself by the people who measured themselves by you.”\n\nKevin Costner plays the title character in 1991's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Freeman is Azeem, a Moor prisoner rescued by Robin. The two subsequently become trusted allies, joining together to fight the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, who is spreading his tyranny across the kingdom.\n\nThe key quality of Azeem is loyalty. Because Robin saved his life, he has devoted himself to helping his new friend until his debt is repaid. Knowing he has someone so faithful by his side allows Robin to push forward during the toughest moments. Other members of the “merry men” respond positively to him, too, making Azeem an influential part of the group.\n\nMost Inspirational Quote: “You have saved my life. Now I will stay with you until I have saved yours, that is my vow.”"
