        "text": "Starring Palm Springs: Part 2 of 5\n\nPalm Springs has historically been known as the playground to the stars. In the heyday of Hollywood film-making, there was something known as the “two-hour rule.”\n\nActors had to stay within two hours of Hollywood in case they were called in to work, so naturally Palm Springs, located within that boundary, fast became a popular destination.\n\nWhile the resort city still remains a hot vacation spot, it is steadily becoming a place for top filmmakers and actors to visit for work as well.\n\nA review of film permits since 2016 shows that 13 feature-length films have shot entire movies or scenes in Palm Springs.\n\nSTARRING PALM SPRINGS: Top locations | Music videos | TV shows | Fashion shoots\n\nFrom Bradley Cooper in his directorial debut using the Palm Springs Convention Center as a venue where his character in “A Star is Born” performs, to veteran director Ron Shelton, known for “Bull Durham,” sending a film crew to get footage of the city so his movie “Just Getting Started” with Morgan Freeman could appear to take place in Palm Springs.\n\nHere are the 13 films.
