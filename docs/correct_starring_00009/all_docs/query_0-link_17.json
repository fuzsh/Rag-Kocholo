        "text": "1995\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles, CA (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nHouse, Hotel, Cafe, Office\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmerican Art Deco, Dilapidated/Neglected, Desert, Craftsman, Hotel/Motel Style, Industrial Style\n\nAbout Seven\n\nSeven is a critically acclaimed psychological thriller released in 1995, deftly directed by David Fincher, and starring an ensemble cast of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey. Treading into the darkest underbelly of human vice, the movie spins a chilling tale of two detectives, portrayed by Pitt and Freeman, on a hunt for a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who draws morbid inspiration from the seven deadly sins.\n\nAs Kevin Spacey's terrifying portrayal of the mysterious killer John Doe draws the spectator deeper into his sick mind, the story delves into a complex web of sin, corruption, and criminal activity. Pitt and Freeman, in particular, received rave reviews for their outstanding performances, which contributed to the film's riveting plot and tense atmosphere. Pitt's onscreen wife, Tracy Mills, was brilliantly portrayed by Paltrow.\n\nAfter its debut, Seven received widespread praise and won multiple awards, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars. It continued to win Best Sound and Best Editing at the BAFTAs. It was also a financial success, topping the charts with $327.3 million globally and solidifying its place as a top-tier crime thriller.\n\nSeven became a landmark in the psychological thriller genre, inspiring many following films and television shows due to director Fincher's characteristic dark style and excellent narrative. The terrifying ending of the film left an indelible impression on audiences, and Brad Pitt's classic statement, \"What's in the box?\" became a cultural meme.\n\nSeven Locations\n\nDiscover the haunting noir settings used to film Seven, a groundbreaking thriller of the twentieth century, by visiting the filming sites where it was shot. Set chiefly in downtown Los Angeles, Seven infused the city with a gloomy, rainy vibe by eliminating any identifiable landmarks, much like New York or Philadelphia, to retain the city's anonymity.\n\nThe cinematography thrived in the unpolished, mazelike nooks and crannies of Los Angeles, not just any old portion of the city. The dramatic interiors of the Pacific Electric Building doubling as the 'Fourteenth Precinct' and the opening murder scene filmed among the little stores southeast of Downtown, near the old Fashion District, are the foundation of the picture.\n\nWhen John Doe finally gave up, the world could see it in the majestic old lobby of the historic Rosslyn Hotel. Simultaneously, the foreboding setting for the terrifying desert scenario was the desolate high-tension lines close to West Avenue I, and the towering faÃ§ade of the Alexandria Hotel was his haunting home.\n\nThose committed to the film may find that seeing Seven filming sites brings them face-to-face with the mysterious storyline. Curiously, you might discover the life-altering path some of these locations have taken since being famous in movies. The authentic charm is in experiencing firsthand the extraordinary fusion of art and reality that the Seven filmmakers painstakingly created in these settings.\n\nThe first time we see Detective Lieutenant William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) together is at a murder scene. Somerset, a seasoned detective on the brink of retirement, is paired with Mills, a hot-headed yet idealistic young detective who recently moved to the unnamed city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).\n\nThe scene takes place on a Sunday, where the two detectives meet amid the grim spectacle of their first case together. The meeting scene was filmed at 746 South San Pedro Street at Agatha Street, an area populated with small businesses southeast of Downtown, near the old Fashion District. The scriptwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, makes a cameo as the victim, adding an intriguing element to the scene.\n\nAs Somerset and Mills walk past the neighboring storefronts, viewers can observe the unique iron grillwork on the doors, which remains unchanged despite the general renovation of the buildings. This detail adds an atmospheric realism to the scene, blending the gritty narrative of the film with the tangible reality of the location.\n\nFor those wishing to visit this iconic location, it's relatively straightforward. The address is in the heart of Los Angeles. You can use public transportation, like the Metro Bus services, or drive yourself. If you're in Downtown LA, head southeast towards the old Fashion District. The exact spot is at South San Pedro Street and Agatha Street.\n\nDetective Somerset is growing increasingly irritated with Detective Mills's constant interruptions. On a rainy Monday, they are investigating a gruesome murder scene where an obese man was forced to eat until his stomach burst, causing his death. The man is found lying face-down in a bowl of spaghetti sauce. The word \"gluttony\" is ominously written on the wall, revealing the killer's motive and setting the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThis unsettling scene unfolds in a house teeming with cockroaches, situated at 720 Beacon Avenue, just south of 7th Street in the Westlake district, to the east of MacArthur Park. Contrary to its gloomy portrayal in the film, this neighborhood in Los Angeles isn't as bleak in reality as it is depicted on screen. However, it's important to note that this house is privately owned, so fans cannot enter the property. Exterior views are permitted, but respect for the residents' privacy is paramount.\n\nTo visit this iconic location, you need to head towards the Westlake district, located east of MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Using public transportation like LA Metro or driving yourself are both viable options. From downtown Los Angeles, it's a 10-minute drive via CA-110.\n\nDetectives Somerset and Mills utilize library records to identify a suspect, a man they later learn is named John Doe (Kevin Spacey). Earlier in the film, Mills jests that the suspect might have a library card, and this offhand comment becomes a crucial lead. Somerset prints a list of all books on the seven deadly sins and uses his FBI contacts to find out who has been reading them. This leads them to Doe's apartment, setting the stage for the film's chilling climax.\n\nThe scene where Somerset conducts his diligent research takes place in a gloomy library, which is the old, disused Bank of America building located at 650 South Spring Street. The imposing tower lends an air of gravitas to the scene, with its high ceilings and grand architecture. Completed in 1911, it was the tallest building in the city for five years.\n\nThis location has also been used in several other films, including Jim Carrey's comedy The Mask, Adam Sandler's rom-com The Wedding Singer, Whoopi Goldberg's romance Ghost, and John Schlesingerâs Marathon Man. In the latter, it is portrayed as a New York vault where Nazi Szell, played by Laurence Olivier, accesses a stash of diamonds.\n\nTo visit this iconic location, you need to head to the heart of Los Angeles. The old Bank of America building is centrally located on South Spring Street. You can reach it via public transportation, such as the LA Metro, or drive there directly. It's worth noting that while the interior may not be open to the public, the exterior of the building is still a sight to behold, carrying with it the weight of cinematic history.\n\nUpon Somerset and Mills's arrival at the police station, Doe surrenders himself unexpectedly, drenched in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to confess to his heinous crimes, but he places a condition: he will lead Somerset and Mills to a hidden location where the victims representing envy and wrath are presumably buried; if not, he will plead insanity.\n\nThis intense scene unfolds in the spacious lobby of the old Rosslyn Hotel, located at 112 West 5th Street. The scene is filled with tension and disbelief as Doe surrenders, throwing everyone off guard. The location adds a touch of grandeur and history to the scene, enhancing its impact.\n\nThe Rosslyn Hotel, built in 1914, and its annex constructed in 1923, were designed by John Parkinson in the popular Beaux Arts style. The hotel was once a celebrated establishment in the downtown hotel industry. However, as the neighborhood's character changed, so did the Rosslyn. It experienced a period of decline before being purchased by the Frontiera family in the late 1970s. By the time Seven was filmed, the hotel had seen better days, adding an aura of faded glory to the scene.\n\nTo visit this iconic location, head to the heart of Los Angeles. You can use public transportation, like the LA Metro, or drive yourself. The Rosslyn Hotel is located on West 5th Street, a stone's throw away from the city's bustling Downtown area. Standing in this historic lobby, you can almost feel the scene's tension as Doe turns himself in, a moment that remains one of the most memorable in the film's narrative.\n\nDetectives Mills and Somerset are led by Doe to an isolated, barren location. The tension escalates as a delivery van emerges on this desolate landscape. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint as Somerset stops the delivery driver, who has been directed to bring a box to their precise location.\n\nOpening the box, Somerset is filled with sudden panic and warns Mills to stay back. Doe chillingly reveals that he embodies the sin of envy and hints at the horrific contents of the box: Tracy's (Gwyneth Paltrow) severed head.\n\nThis harrowing sequence unfolds amidst the stark desert landscape north of Los Angeles. The scene was filmed on West Avenue H, west of Lancaster. This near-featureless expanse of desert, dotted with high-tension power lines, gives an eerie sense of isolation. Despite the 'street' numbers suggesting otherwise, this is undeveloped land, mapped out in a grid in anticipation of future development.\n\nTo reach this filming landmark, you would need to travel north from Los Angeles toward Lancaster. The journey, via San Francisquito Canyon Rd, typically takes about an hour and a half from the city center. Regrettably, there's no public transportation available for this route."
