        "text": "Waxwork Records in association with WaterTower Music is thrilled to present the debut vinyl release of SE7EN Original Motion Picture Score by Howard Shore. Directed by David Fincher, Se7en is a 1995 gritty neo-noir film starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey.\n\nPitt and Freeman star as Detectives Mills and Somerset as they search for the elusive serial killer John Doe (Spacey), who has been carrying out meticulously planned murders based on each of the Seven Deadly Sins. As the murders pile up, the detectives gain insight to John Doe’s twisted philosophy, leading to the grizzly end of his terrible crime spree.\n\nThe score by master composer Howard Shore brings a somber and menacing component to the movie. The dark and symphonic orchestrations undercut Fincher’s gruesome images with an unyielding tension throughout the film. Shore’s deep resonant brass and high eerie strings drag the listener deeper into the cruel and chaotic world of SE7EN.\n\nWaxwork Records is proud to release SE7EN Original Motion Picture Score by Howard Shore for the first time on vinyl as a deluxe 2xLP. Features include 150 gram colored vinyl, heavyweight gatefold jackets with matte satin coating, 11\"x11\" printed insert, and layout and design by Steve Reeves."
