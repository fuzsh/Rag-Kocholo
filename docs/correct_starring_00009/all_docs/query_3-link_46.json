        "text": "Whether the big screen, small screen or the stage, Freeman tends to stand out. One of his more notable television appearances came on the popular CBS political drama Madam Secretary. He was featured in three episodes of the series, playing the Chief Justice of the United States, who was also a former professor who taught Elizabeth McCord (Tea Leoni) at the University of Virginia. Freeman served as executive producer and even director during the show's run.\n\nAs we'll see, Freeman has no aversion to starring in disaster films. When it came to 1995's Outbreak, about a deadly ebolavirus-like (Motaba) outbreak that finds its way to California via a monkey. Ford isn't all that likable, notably because he's somewhat responsible for covering up the emergence of the virus for years. However, he tries to make up for his mistake in the present day — since things are already out of hand.\n\nIn this 2002, modern-day version of another Jack Ryan spy thriller courtesy of writer Tom Clancy, Freeman plays opposite star Ben Affleck. Freeman has taken on the role of law enforcement or government official quite often, and he never really disappoints. Freeman's Cabot and Ryan take on a new, potentially hard-line Russian government. When it comes to working with a partner, especially in the role of mentor, Freeman makes it look easy — and highly entertaining.\n\nIf there's an actor worthy of playing God, then Freeman would be a solid choice. While critics were mixed on 2003's Bruce Almighty, star Jim Carrey and Freeman were lauded for their performances. Though 2007's Evan Almighty focused on Steve Carell's supporting character from the first movie, Freeman still had his moments. Both pictures aren't to be taken seriously, and Freeman is amusing and entertaining enough for a spot on this list.\n\nFreeman and Tea Leoni teamed up again for this 1998, end-of-the-world, sci-fi disaster flick. Freeman played the role of POTUS Tom Beck, who tries to remain as calm and in control while hoping a team of astronauts can prevent a massive comet from hitting Earth. There isn't much substance to Freeman's character, but as far as film presidents go, he's more than serviceable, and someone we wouldn't mind running the United States.\n\nFreeman played alongside fellow screen legend Jack Nicholson in this comedically touching 2007 buddy flick — directed by another famed Hollywood force in Rob Reiner — that spawned a new way of thinking and trying to live life the fullest before your number is up. Naturally, Freeman's Carter is the more reserved of the two terminally ill friends, as well as the more grounded, though Freeman's character delivers most of the movie's most endearing and memorable comedy moments.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many big Hollywood names that Freeman works with — he can obviously hold his own (and then some) while always commanding respect in the process. That's certainly the case in this 2010 action comedy, when former CIA agents get the band back together. A mentor of sorts to former CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), in a movie that also stars John Malkovich and Helen Mirren, Joe Matheson is a retiree dealing with a terminal illness, who is still responsible for some of the movie's most memorable comedic sequences.\n\nYes, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) is certainly schlocky. And, star Kevin Costner was rightfully panned for his performance. However, when it came to salvaging the overall project and making it worth the time spent in watching, Freeman and the late, great Alan Rickman get the job done. While Rickman is deliciously evil as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Freeman's turn as an aggressive, yet charming Moor is quite the inspiration — and the true \"good guy\" of the film.\n\nKind of like his presence in the Bruce Almighty and Evan Almighty films, Freeman portrays a \"wise\" figure in one of the most popular films of this century. The same goes for his character from 2014's computer-animated action-adventure comedy hit The Lego Movie (2014). Vitruvius is a blind Master Builder, among the highest and most respected figures the Lego universe, who helps Emmet (Chris Pratt) on his unintended quest. It's a role that basically fits Freeman to perfection.\n\nSticking with that \"wisdom\" theme of Freeman roles. To the casual fan of the actor, this 2014 English-language French sci-fi picture might have flown below the radar. Scarlett Johansson, who takes on telekinetic powers after ingesting a psychedelic working as a drug mule, portrays Lucy in the starring role. Freeman's scientist tries to help the newly dangerous Lucy from a scholarly standpoint Johansson is the undisputed star, but Freeman is highly underrated in his performance.\n\nA stellar addition to this Netflix acclaimed comedy-drama starring Michael Douglas, Freeman's appearance playing himself is one of the great surprises of the show's third season. Freeman happens upon one of Sandy's classes, and the two, subtly, but rather hilariously, have it out about who is the better acting coach. Freeman was nominated for a 2021 Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award for his guest appearance.\n\nFreeman teams up with famed John Avildsen (Rocky; The Karate Kid franchise) for this inspiring biopic about Joe Louis Clark, the principal at Eastside High School in rugged Paterson, N.J. His unorthodox, and somewhat radical, changes made to improve test scores and the overall well-being and motivation of the student body were controversial, but have an effect. Freeman was honored as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Motion Picture at the 1989 NAACP Image Awards.\n\nWorking with the best in the business, Freeman was part of Steven Spielberg's 1997 historical drama about the 1839 slave revolt on the Spanish ship La Amistad. Freeman plays an associate to attorney Roger Sherman Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), who takes on the duties of representing the African slaves. When it comes to taking on historically-based roles, and even though not a lead character, Freeman makes it all seem effortless — while making his presence memorable.\n\nFreeman and Clint Eastwood have enjoyed a special working relationship that produced some of the most successful movies — and contributions — of each other's careers in Hollywood. The 1992 Academy Award winner for Best Picture Unforgiven is a prime example, though it would be easy for Freeman to have been overshadowed by Eastwood, who won the Academy Award for Best Director, and co-star Gene Hackman —who was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor — in this Western. Still, Freeman is solid as a retired outlaw buddy to Eastwood's fellow retired outlaw-turned-repentant farmer and widower William Munny, and proves he can be highly impactful.\n\nYes, Renée Zellweger was well worthy of her Golden Globe victory for starring in this 2000 black comedy-crime drama. But, don't sleep on Freeman's performance as an aging hitman who is looking to complete one last job before retirement. We actually feel for his character and his bittersweet storyline. Charlie's chemistry with partner Wesley (Chris Rock) is certainly one of the highlights of a movie that made nearly $30 million at the box office.\n\nWhen digging into Freeman's expansive acting resume, it still surprises some to learn that he was the beloved Easy Reader on the beloved 1970s PBS children's classic The Electric Company. A hipster poet of sorts, Easy Reader made reading cool, while delivering that heavy vibe associated with the era. His first appearance on the show came in 1971 alongside another acting legend in Rita Moreno. Other Freeman characters on the show included disc jockey Mel Mounds and Vincent the Vegetable Vampire.\n\nDecember 1989 proved to be a vital month for Freeman's acting career. Glory was one of Freeman's two widely popular movies released that month -— though in a rather limited release. Part of an ensemble cast that includes Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington, this historical piece offers a look at the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the Union Army's first all-Black regiments from the Civil War. Freeman manages to stand out, though not nearly as much as his other 1989 project (more on that later). But, notably for Rawlins' memorable confrontation with Washington's Private Silas Trip.\n\nIn many ways, Fox is Bruce Wayne's handler. An old friend of Wayne's late father Thomas, Lucius Fox is actually one of the few who knows about Wayne's alter ego as Batman. Holding various different jobs of many levels of importance, Fox is one of the most valuable figures in Bruce Wayne's orbit. Freeman seems perfect for the role, coming off as someone who is grounded, intelligent and commands respect from the first moment he appears or opens his mouth.\n\nIt's not often that Freeman plays a character in questionable standing. But, when he did during 2007's Gone Baby Gone, there's certainly reason to side with his crooked-type Captain Doyle. Sure, he's a little skeevy at times, but maybe his actions within the general plot of the critically acclaimed film that are meant in good faith — even if illegal. The performance is a testament to Freeman's talent, where he can make even a seemingly dislikable figure worthy of some sympathy and understanding.\n\nThe most recent of Freeman's five Academy Award nominations came for his portrayal of the iconic South African president, in this 2009 Clint Eastwood film adapted from the book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. The story follows Mandela's involvement before and during the 1995 Rugby World Cup held in South Africa. Nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, Freeman delivers a powerful performance that thoroughly does justice in capturing Mandela's spirit.\n\nNearing retirement, stoic and respected Detective Somerset finds himself in the most horrendous case of his career. Teamed with hot-tempered, young Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt), the duo is tasked with hunting down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. The by-the-book, professional, yet compassionate Somerset might be one of Freeman's most vulnerable characters. If he thought he's seen it all in this stressful and mentally relentless job, Somerset should think again in this devastatingly suspenseful David Fincher hit.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Freeman was already an established, well-respected actor. However, he reached true international stardom while receiving a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this classic from 1989, one of the nine Driving Miss Daisy received. Though he didn't win (the movie won Best Picture), his character's relationship with Best Actress-winner Jessica Tandy's Daisy Werthan, whom he chauffeurs, is one of the most unlikely, yet endearingly important friendships in the history of film.\n\nAfter falling short on three Academy Award-nomination occasions, Freeman was finally honored with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this celebrated role from the 2004 drama that also won for Best Picture, Best Director (Clint Eastwood) and Best Actress (Hilary Swank). Freeman's grizzled Eddie Dupris, aka \"Scrap-Iron,\" who also narrates the movie (which eventually becomes a key part of the story), is a former boxer and gym worker. He can't get enough of the \"sweet science,\" and initially helps train Swank's Maggie. Whether seen or heard, Freeman's presence is usually magical.\n\nWhen it came to Academy Award recognition, Freeman's first Oscar nomination — which was in the Best Supporting Actor category — was for his stellar effort in this 1987 crime thriller that was praised by professional critics, but struggled to generate any real commercial success. Also known as \"Fast Black,\" Freeman's Smalls, a dangerous pimp, outshined star Christopher Reeve. Freeman is disturbingly sensational as a character filled with urban intelligence. Dare we say there's even an Easy Reader-vibe going on. This role opened the door for his consistent award appeal.\n\nFreeman did not win the Best Actor Oscar for this instant classic that can be found daily to view on basic cable. It doesn't matter — it's arguably the role that he's most associated with, a longtime prisoner of the hardened and corrupt Shawshank State Prison. Freeman also serves as the movie's narrator (another legendary aspect of his career), telling the story of his friend Andy Dufresne during his time in prison. The two form a admirable friendship behind bars, and Red's story telling is even more impactful than the character's visual performance."
