        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n19 Dec 2022, 10:04\n\nCredit: Sky Cinema / IMDB\n\nMorgan Freeman and Florence Pugh have teamed for Zach Braff’s new movie, A Good Person, and a new trailer has just dropped.\n\nBraff - who first came to prominence as John \"J.D.\" Dorian in hit hospital comedy Scrubs, and went on to direct the likes of Garden State and Going In Style - has written, produced and directed the new film.\n\nA Good Person stars Allison (played by Pugh), who, years after being involved in a fatal accident, forms an unlikely relationship with her would-be father-in-law, Daniel (played by Freeman).\n\nThe official synopsis reads: “Daniel is brought together with Allison, the once thriving young woman with a bright future who was involved in an unimaginable tragedy that took his daughter’s life.\n\n“As grief-stricken Daniel navigates raising his teenage granddaughter and Allison seeks redemption, they discover that friendship, forgiveness, and hope can flourish in unlikely places.”\n\nThe trailer certainly suggests that the movie is going to be an emotional affair. It starts with Freeman narrating as we see scenes of the model train enthusiast’s happy family life, before a car accident completely changes things.\n\n“The woman who died was about to be my sister-in-law,” Pugh’s character reveals.\n\n“I want my life back, I want my child back,” Freeman’s character tells Allison in an emotionally-charged scene.\n\nLater in the trailer, Daniel tells Allison, “Don’t run away now because of me.”\n\nWe then see some tear-jerking scenes as the pair form an unlikely bond.\n\nWatch the trailer here:\n\nThe movie brings Freeman and Braff back together, having joined forces on 2017’s Going In Style.\n\nThe cast also includes Molly Shannon, Chinaza Uche and Celeste O’Connor.\n\nWe reckon you’ll need some tissues at hand for this one."
