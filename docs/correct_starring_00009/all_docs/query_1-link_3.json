I lived on this block my whole life. Most of these people have. When your job is to find people who were missing, it helps to know where they started. I find the people who started in the cracks and then fell through. This city can be hard.

If he were white and his enslavers were British, he wouldn't be standing, so heavy the weight of the medals and honors we would bestow upon him. Songs would be written about him. The great authors of our times would fill books about him. His story would be told and retold, in our classrooms. Our children, because we would make sure of it, would know his name as well as they know Patrick Henry’s. Yet, if the South is right, what are we to do with that embarrassing, annoying document, The Declaration of Independence? What of its conceits? ‘All men created equal,’ ‘inalienable rights,’ ‘life, liberty,’ and so on and so forth? What on Earth are we to do with this?” — John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins)\n\nWhere to watch: Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, Apple TV.\n\n1.
