        "text": "There may be spoilers ahead, and some unpleasant images…\n\nAfter the success of last week’s Tuesday review, I said to myself why not try it again. And here we are, dear reader. Enjoy!\n\nIt seems the logical next move – Brad Pitt and David Fincher, tying in with Kevin Spacey and the exciting genre of Neo-Noir. And that’s when I stumbled upon it – Seven.\n\nWhen I saw the description “neo-noir psychological crime thriller film” there was no way I wasn’t sitting down and watching this. And, as a nice little bonus, it has an all star cast of Morgan Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and more.\n\nThe story is even more enthralling than the cast, however – it is based around grizzled detective Somerset (Freeman), who is set to retire in a few days, but gets partnered with a new rookie in town, Mills (Pitt). Despite both their reluctance to work with one another, they are thrown in at the deep end when they have to investigate a trail of homicides, each one depicted as one of the seven deadly sins – gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust. But this isn’t just killing someone alongside those sins. Oh no. This is torture. This is bloody disturbing.\n\nOften stylised as Se7en, this film is a thriller in every sense of the word. In fact, would I go as far as to say it’s a horror? Quite possibly.\n\nOne of the most famed of that genre is Alien. A supernatural xenomorph is certainly a frightening prospect, and I wouldn’t fancy an invasion of Earth at this precise moment. However, that just doesn’t feel realistic to me. When we were younger, we were all scared of monsters under the bed and the unknown. But now, we’ve lost all our sense of belief and innocence, and are now cynical, repugnant, despicable humans. Note to self: get out the house more often.\n\nBut my point is, those things just fail to scare when there is so much worse going on in the world. Which is why Seven works really well. Humans kill 1,300 fellow humans every day. That’s the second highest murderer of our species daily, only behind mosquitoes, which kill 2,740 people every day.\n\nSo, admittedly, there should be a horror about psychotic mosquitoes, but unfortunately, that doesn’t look like it’s going to formulate anytime soon. So, just looking down the list… dum da dum da day… ah! Humans. Hopefully, you won’t have come into contact with serial killers in your life, but we have a lot of proof of a lot of very dangerous, very mad people. It’s estimated there are around 4,000 people in the world right now who are active serial killers. So, for every 19,185 people, one is a serial killer.\n\nI may have deviated a little off course, but what I’m trying to say is, I’m far more likely to keep the hall light on, or sleep with one eye open, or tuck a baseball bat under the bed if I’ve watched a man gruesomely – and without motive – kill a bunch of people to prove a point, or fulfil his own satisfaction, than watch an alien devour a ship’s crew.\n\nAnd this is why I will never forget John Doe (Spacey). He’s out of his mind. He’s sick, I tell you, SICK! One of the most creative, imaginative, symbolic and brutal serial killers I’ve ever seen on the silver screen. I still feel slightly queasy thinking about his crime. This is a film intended to shock, scare, seduce and then spit you right out again. This is one rollercoaster you’ll want to check you’re the right height for.\n\nPeople forget in this film that Spacey actually has a tiny part. It takes a good 40 minutes before we see him, and even then it’s under a facade. He is only really prominent is the last 30 or so minutes of the film. But he is the character that lives on in the memory and leaves a bloody stain on our conscience. Every single crime gets worse and worse after the last, which I can leave to your imagination when the first was force feeding a man to his death.\n\nBut it’s hard to feel that the Sloth edition of the killing wasn’t the worst. Tying a man to his bed for a whole year, slowly starving him and taking a picture each day. The worst part? He wasn’t even dead when they found him. The moment he coughs at the policemen closing in… you can’t turn back.\n\nHe eventually dies of a heart attack. This all shows our dear old friend Mr Doe was not as sane as we all presumed. The lust crime was almost equally bad.\n\nKeeping in tandem with Fight Club, David Fincher also continues the tradition of subliminal messaging. This film came out before its fellow psychological thriller, which shows Fincher must have been dying to use it more often with a little more context. At exactly seven minutes before the end of the film, slap in the middle of one of the most dramatic scenes, we see Mill’s wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) offering a little clue to the ending.\n\nIt was interesting to see Pitt play a rookie role. I had grown accustomed to the Tyler’s in Fight Club, or the Rusty’s in Ocean 11. He was very good at it. He played off the weary Morgan Freeman well, and not for one moment did I doubt his young, naive, hot blooded performance.\n\nWhich is what makes the ending all the better.\n\nI didn’t know where it was going. When driving down the road, the helicopter following, and John promising something that would go down in history, I was sitting there, twiddling my thumbs, enjoying this madman’s rant about the apathetic world we live in. The suspense is almost painful. We’re standing out in a field, waiting. And then the van comes pile driving down the road. Somerset goes over and receives a box.\n\nAnd I won’t spoil for you what’s inside. Sticking to the script, it’s haunting. Even after all his experience, Somerset is disgusted by it. But I will tell you that there were two remaining sins left before we find the box.\n\nSo my prediction would have been that Somerset and Mills were the final two, in some way. I like to think I wasn’t too far off, but had to swap one of the detectives out for… yes, that’s right… Mr John Doe.\n\nFunnily enough, that ending wasn’t going to happen. It was seen as too drab and dark (had they not been watching the whole film?!) but Freeman, Fincher and Pitt all threatened to walk away if it wasn’t included. It is an excellent denouement and smarting to watch.\n\nHowever, threats were made that something had to change, so the final line, “Ernest Hemingway once wrote, “The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.” I agree with the second part,” said by Somerset gives not an uplifting line, but a ‘not all hope is lost’ line, without losing the cynicism.\n\nBest character: Can I give to someone who’s only in the final half an hour? Yes. John Doe, it’s your lucky day. I’m not sure if it’s his character or his crimes that have left such an impression, but one of the only killers that we never see actually kill anyone.\n\nLeast favourite character: This film has a tiny cast, so this is incredibly difficult. I’ve never been Morgan Freeman’s biggest fan, but he is excellent in this. You could argue he’s been living off the credit of this performance for many years. Then I thought Tracy, but that seemed so harsh when this was probably one of Gwyneth Paltrow’s best performances – small but beautifully measured. But it also got me thinking about limited female roles. Tracy is basically the only woman in this with lines. Male writers create two types of female stereotypes – the innocent victim or the bawd. Tracy Mills falls under the victim category – in essence, she’s only written in for the ending. And, if you look back at my reviews, the only ones that have big female characters are Alien and Ozark. Unfortunately, it remains a very male led industry.\n\nFavourite scene: I love it when the train starts shaking the apartment, but the “WHAT’S IN THE BOX!?” scene – the raw emotion, the pain Mills feels, it’s all so tangible. What a film.\n\nBest quote: “Wanting people to listen, you can’t just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you’ll notice you’ve got their strict attention.” If he wasn’t a murder, perhaps he could have been a motivational speaker.\n\nSeven – 8.5 out of 10"
