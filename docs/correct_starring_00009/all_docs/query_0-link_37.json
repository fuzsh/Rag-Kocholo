        "text": "(Ro, AB, LLL, VVV, SSS, NNN) Romantic Film-Noir with strong anti-Christian elements; 99 obscenities & 12 profanities; gruesome violence including explicit lingering shots of murder victims who have been stuffed to death, a pound of flesh cut from their sides, had their face cut off, been starved and drugged to death, & been sexually mutilated with a bowie knife dildo, explicit photographs of murder victims, & shots of urine, vomit, intestines, entrails, as well as the normal shootings, beatings & criminal violence; Sex clubs and people in bondage; nude shots of several corpses showing genitalia & several bedroom shots of husband & wife with no nudity or explicit sex; drug use & alcohol use; and, many slightly derogatory references to Christian classics such as Milton's Paradise lost, Dante's Divine Comedy and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales\n\nSEVEN is another film noir cliche combining elements of NATURAL BORN KILLERS and CAPE FEAR to tell the story of a brilliant killer who is preaching against the seven deadly sins by performing gruesome executions of the people who represent each sin. Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all and is ready to retire. He is teamed up with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), an emotional young cop who wants to be a hero. They are called to a repugnant crime scene where an obese man has been executed by being force fed. When they next find a leading defense attorney executed by having a pound of his own flesh cut out and the word greed written in his blood, Somerset realizes that the killer is preaching a sermon against the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath.\n\nWhile there is a technical brilliance to this movie, it is another evil-Christian-villain example of virulent Hollywood religious bigotry. The mutilations of the victims are portrayed in pornographic detail while the language is repulsive. However aside from the artistic aspects of the movie, it is excessively violent and bleak. What is worse is the fact that this movie is trying to make money by promoting the seven deadly sins."
