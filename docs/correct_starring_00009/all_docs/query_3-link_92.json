        "text": "Among the memorials to Nelson Mandela put up across India is a billboard in Tamil Nadu that features a photo of actor Morgan Freeman, not the iconic anti-apartheid hero from South Africa who died earlier this month.\n\nThe businessman who paid for the sign says it will be replaced with one that has the right image.\n\nPerhaps the billboard's designer got confused because Freeman portrayed Mandela in the 2009 movie Invictus.\n\nAs you might expect, a photo of the botched billboard has been whipping around Twitter."
