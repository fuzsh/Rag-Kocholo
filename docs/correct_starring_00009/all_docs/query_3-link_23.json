        "text": "Morgan Freeman 1937–\n\nActor\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nGoodbye Air Force, Hello Hollywood\n\nFrom The Electric Company to Shakespeare\n\nTwo Academy Award Nominations\n\nSmooth Sailing in the Real World\n\nSources\n\nMorgan Freeman is a versatile actor who has performed in numerous roles from children’s television to Shakespearean drama. He is best known, however, for his appearances in a string of well-regarded motion pictures, including Driving Miss Daisy, Lean on Me, and Glory. Praise has been bestowed upon Freeman in the form of several awards and award nominations. Time correspondent Janice C. Simpson noted that his performances “are so finely calibrated that [the] characters emerge as men of true heft and substance.” A private man who says acting “comes easy” for him, Freeman does not care for the movie star label and all that it implies. The actor observed in Ebony that “once you become a movie star, people come to see you. You don’t have to act anymore. And, to me, that’s a danger.”\n\nThe big screen has brought Freeman to a wider audience, but he has long been a figure in New York City theater, appearing only in Broadway and off-Broadway plays that suit his very particular tastes. As early as 1967 he held a part in the Broadway cast of Hello, Dolly that starred Pearl Bailey, but the bulk of his work has come in nonmusical, intensely serious dramas that relate various aspects of the African-American experience. “I have a special affinity for seeing to it that our history is told,” Freeman declared in Ebony. “The Black legacy is as noble, is as heroic, is as filled with adventure and conquest and discovery as anybody else’s. It’s just that nobody knows it.”\n\nFreeman endured a tumultuous childhood, and he prefers not to reveal much in interviews about his early years. The fourth child in the family, he was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1937. While still an infant, he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother in Charleston, Mississippi. She died when Freeman was six years old, and he spent the next several years traveling with his mother from Chicago to Nashville, Tennessee, and finally to Greenwood, Mississippi, where they settled down.\n\nLike most youngsters of his generation, Freeman loved the movies. “When I was a kid, it cost 12 cents to go to the movies,” he related in a People interview with Susan Toepfer. “If you could find a milk bottle, you could sell it for a nickel. Soda and beer bottles were worth 2 cents. If you were diligent, you could come up with movie money every day.” The World War II-era films Freeman saw inspired him to be a fighter pilot. At first, drama served\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn June 1, 1937, in Memphis, TN; son of Grafton Curtis and Mayme Edna (Revere) Freeman; married Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, October 22, 1967 (divorced, 1979); married Myrna Colley-Lee (a costume designer), June 16,1984; children: Alphonse, Saifoulaye, Deena, Morgana; seven grandchildren.

I wanted to get her attention, so one day I pulled a chair out from under her. Sure enough, I got attention. The teacher grabbed me by the nape of the neck, lifted me onto my toes, and marched me down the hall. I thought for sure I was gonna be expelled.\n\n“But he opens this door and flings me into this room, and there’s this English teacher and he asks me, ‘You ever done any actin’?’ Well, under the circumstances, I’m quick to say yes. Turns out there’s these dramatic tournaments—every school does a play—and the winner goes to the state finals. Well, we do this play ’bout a family with a wounded son just home from the war—I play his kid brother. We win the district championship, we win the state championship, and dadgummit, I’m chosen as best actor. All’ cause I pull this chair out from under Barbara.”\n\nFreeman’s tale shows that he exhibited talent early but did not take acting seriously, even when others recognized his skill. After graduating from high school in Greenwood he entered the U.S. Air Force, hoping to become a pilot. Aptitude tests showed that he had the ability, but he was instead assigned duties as a mechanic and a radar technician. “I was aced out,” he explained in Esquire. “Racism, the southern old-boy network. I had a sergeant who interposed himself between me and the casual barracks [stockade]—I was insolent. I called a horse’s ass a horse’s ass, even if it was wearin’ brass. The whole thing in the service, you’re supposed to look down. Never could do that.”\n\nGoodbye Air Force, Hello Hollywood\n\nFreeman spent his spare time while in the Air Force contemplating other careers, and he ultimately decided to become an actor. He left the service in 1959 and headed straight for Hollywood. Once there, he looked up the address of Paramount Studios in the telephone book and went over to apply for a job. Only when he noticed that the questions on the application concerned familiarity with office machinery and typing did it dawn upon him that he would not be hired as an actor on the spot. He opted to follow a more conventional route, taking acting classes at Los Angeles City College while supporting himself as a clerk. He also took tap dancing lessons, becoming good enough to land a part-time job performing at the 1964 World’s Fair.\n\nBy his own admission, Freeman did not gain much insight from his acting classes. “I’m not much for talking about acting,” he noted in New York. ” I’ve been called an intuitive actor, and I guess that’s right. I go with what I feel. It doesn’t do me any good to intellectualize about it.” Freeman moved to New York City in the early 1960s and supported himself with a series of day jobs while auditioning for theatrical roles. At one point he even served as a counter man in a Penn Station doughnut stand. His first important part came in an off-Broadway play called The Nigger-Lovers, which opened and closed quickly in 1967.\n\nFrom The Electric Company to Shakespeare\n\nFreeman’s brief experience in The Nigger-Lovers was valuable, however, because it helped him land a role in the all-black cast of Hello, Dolly that opened on Broadway in 1967. When the show closed, he moved on to a series of off-Broadway and repertory plays in New York City and elsewhere. In 1971 he was cast in a television series produced by the Public Broadcasting Service, The Electric Company. On the air for five years, the educational show was aimed at school-aged children, and Freeman played a hip character called Easy Reader. The actor commented in People that he is still remembered for his role. “It’s like being known as Captain Kangaroo,” he said. “It irks me when I meet people who are parents now who talk about how they grew up with me.”\n\nFreeman drew his first major awards for his role in the play The Mighty Gents, produced at New York City’s Ambassador Theatre in 1978. Even though he won the Clarence Derwent Award, Drama Desk Award, and earned a Tony Award nomination, the play closed in nine days and Freeman was out of work. For a while he found himself scuffling for jobs. This experience taught him that awards do not guarantee future success, and he has been decidedly indifferent about them ever since.\n\nThe New York Shakespeare Festival ultimately proved fertile ground for Freeman. There he appeared as the lead in Coriolanus in 1979 and had principal roles in Julius Caesar and Mother Courage and Her Children. His work in Coriolanus and Mother Courage earned him yet more awards, this time Obies. The breakthrough play for Freeman was The Gospel at Colonus, first performed in 1983. The musical, based on the ancient Greek drama about Oedipus—a mythical character who kills his father and marries his mother—is set in a modern Pentecostal church. The Gospel at Colonus featured Freeman as the preacher, a charismatic Oedipus figure around which the frenzied action revolves. Freeman won yet another Obie Award as best actor in a drama, and the play eventually moved to Broadway in 1988 with Freeman still in the lead.\n\nTwo Academy Award Nominations\n\nFreeman’s success with the New York Shakespeare Festival helped him to land a starring role in the stage play Driving Miss Daisy, for which he won an additional Obie Award. The drama examines the close friendship that develops between a wealthy Jewish widow and her black chauffeur, Hoke, in the post-Civil War South. By the time he appeared in Driving Miss Daisy on stage, Freeman had also earned several film roles, most notably in the Robert Redford vehicle Brubaker, and in Harry and Son, starring Paul Newman. And because of Driving Miss Daisy’s success in the theater, Freeman was eager to portray Hoke in a film version of the play.\n\nThe actor almost missed his chance. In 1987 he took the part of a near-psychotic pimp in the movie Street Smart. Although the film was a box office flop, Freeman’s powerful performance earned him an Academy Award nomination. “Street Smart essentially serves as a backdrop for Freeman’s tour de force performance,” wrote Anthony DeCurtis in Rolling Stone. “As the Yoo-Hoo-swilling Fast Black, he alternates fierceness with irresistible charm, engaging intelligence with a bone-chilling capacity for evil. He is the epitome of knowingness.” The stage director of Driving Miss Daisy admitted that he never would have hired Freeman to play Hoke if he had seen the actor as the menacing Fast Black first.\n\nFreeman’s portrayal in the violent Street Smart, however, did not deter the makers of the critically acclaimed 1989 film version of Driving Miss Daisy from casting him in his original role of the kind-hearted Hoke. Once again Freeman was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor. That same year he took another important role, this time as a grave digger-turned-soldier in the Civil War epic Glory. The film, a poignant drama about an all-black regiment that was chosen to lead an assault on a Southern fort, received much praise and provided Freeman just the sort of work he relishes. “I’ve been offered Black quasi-heroes who get hanged at the end,” he pointed out in Essence. “I won’t do a part like that. If I do a hero, he’s going to live to the end of the movie.” Freeman’s character in Glory —eventually promoted and decorated—is indeed one of the last fighters to perish as his battalion storms the fort.\n\nSmooth Sailing in the Real World\n\nSuccess has allowed Freeman to indulge himself at length in his favorite hobby—sailing. One of his acquisitions is a 38-foot sailboat that he has piloted through the Caribbean and the North Atlantic. “When you live in the world of make-believe, you need something real,” he remarked in Time. “I go sailing, I’m in the real world.” Freeman is often accompanied on his trips by his second wife, costume designer Myrna Colley-Lee, and one of his seven grandchildren, E’Dena Hines.\n\nNoted for his subtle but scathing critiques of negative representations of African-Americans on stage and in films, Freeman is very careful about choosing roles. After ending the 1980s with a hectic spate of film and stage work, he took a brief breather before accepting work on a new project. Cast as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival’s production of The Taming of the Shrew in 1990, Freeman garnered lavish reviews, and he subsequently appeared as Azeem, a Moor, in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Explaining his philosophy of choosing roles that best suit his talents, the actor related in Ebony, “There’s a lot of stuff out there, a lot of people writing. So when the right thing comes along, I’ll know, and I’ll just tie the boat up, hop on a plane and go to work.”\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, Volume 6, Gale, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEbony, April 1990.\n\nEsquire, June 1988.\n\nEssence, December 1988.\n\nJet, March 6, 1989.\n\nNew York, March 14, 1988.\n\nPeople, April 4, 1988.\n\nRolling Stone, May 5, 1988.\n\nTime, January 8, 1990.\n\nVillage Voice, July 24, 1990.\n\n—Mark Kram\n\nMorgan Freeman 1937–\n\nActor, director\n\nNamed Best Actor in Junior High\n\nGoodbye Mechanic, Hello Actor\n\nFrom The Electric Company to Shakespeare\n\nNominated for Academy Awards\n\nMore Film Work\n\nSources\n\nMorgan Freeman is a versatile actor who has performed in numerous roles from children’s television to Shakespearean drama.

After ending the 1980s with a hectic spate of film and stage work, he took a brief breather before accepting work on a new project. Cast as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival’s production of The Taming of the Shrew in 1990, Freeman garnered lavish reviews, and he subsequently appeared as Azeem, a Moor, in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Robin Hood opened to mixed reviews. It was labeled a politically correct film.\n\nFreeman received another Academy award nomination for his portrayal of a prisoner, in The Shawshank Redemption. He also made his directorial debut in Bopha! with Danny Glover and Alfre Woodard. He will direct again but told Jerry Roberts of Variety, “…I’m going to shed the director’s hat and stick to acting. It’s more to my liking. For directing, you’ve got to really enjoy it. It’s time-consuming and it’s not lucrative. Call me an actor who has directed.”\n\nFreeman also turned in stellar performances in such films as Outbreak, Unforgiven, and Deep Impact. He also had an important role in Amistad, a historically-based film about slavery-bound Africans who revolted and fought for their freedom all the way to the Supreme Court. Freeman was given his first starring vehicle, Kiss The Girls, and another film, Seven, was his first top-grossing film. Known for playing good guys and everyday Joes, he portrayed the villain in Chain Reaction and Hard Rain. Freeman told Morgan Dean of WRIC-TV that he was “looking for characters to play and looking to have fun playing. I’m not drawn to any certain characters at all. I like playing what’s eclectic.”\n\nSuccess has allowed Freeman to indulge himself at length in his favorite hobby—sailing. One of his acquisitions is a 38-foot sailboat that he has piloted through the Caribbean and the North Atlantic. “When you live in the world of make-believe, you need something real,” he remarked in Time. “I go sailing, I’m in the real world.” Freeman is often accompanied on his trips by his second wife, costume designer Myrna Colley-Lee, and one of his seven grandchildren, E’Dena Hines.\n\nWhen not working, Freeman can also be found on his 44-acre farm in Mississippi. Though a bona fide star in Hollywood’s eyes, he does not share that view. “As you work, you realize that stardom is really not what you want. You want steadiness,” he told the Associated Press in Jet “Steady work is better than stardom. And for a character actor, stardom is anathema because once you become a star, it becomes you,” he continued. Being one the best character actors in show business, Morgan Freeman no longer needs to worry about steady work.\n\nSources\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEbony, April 1990.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, October 22, 1993.\n\nEsquire, June 1988.\n\nEssence, December 1988.\n\nJet, March 6, 1989; October 16, 1995.\n\nNew York, March 14, 1988.\n\nPeople, April 4, 1988.\n\nRolling Stone, May 5, 1988.\n\nTime, January 8, 1990.\n\nVariety, September 1, 1997.\n\nVillage Voice, July 24, 1990.\n\nOther\n\nInformation was also obtained online at the IAC Institute and www.wric.com/morganint.html\n\n—Mark Kram and Ashyia N. Henderson\n\nMorgan Freeman\n\n1937—\n\nActor\n\nMorgan Freeman is a versatile actor who has performed in numerous roles from children's television to Shakespearean drama. He is best known for his appearances in a string of well-regarded motion pictures, including Driving Miss Daisy, Lean on Me, Glory, and Million Dollar Baby. The latter won him an Academy Award in 2005 for best supporting actor. Freeman has won several other awards and award nominations. Time correspondent Janice C. Simpson said Freeman's performances \"are so finely calibrated that [the] characters emerge as men of true heft and substance.\" Freeman, a private man who says acting \"comes easy\" for him, does not care for the movie star label and all that it implies. The actor observed in Ebony that \"once you become a movie star, people come to see you. You don't have to act anymore. And, to me, that's a danger.\" Now in his eighth decade, the actor brings a gravity and sense of wisdom to every role he plays, whether it be a superhero's quiet aide in the ongoing Batman series, the South African hero Nelson Mandela, or God himself.\n\nThe big screen has brought Freeman to a wider audience, but he has long been a figure in New York theater, appearing only in Broadway and off-Broadway plays that suit his very particular tastes. As early as 1967 he held a part in the Broadway cast of Hello, Dolly, that starred Pearl Bailey, but the bulk of his work has come in nonmusical, intensely serious dramas that relate various aspects of the African-American experience. \"I have a special affinity for seeing to it that our history is told,\" Freeman said in Ebony. \"The black legacy is as noble, is as heroic, is as filled with adventure and conquest and discovery as anybody else's. It's just that nobody knows it.\"\n\nEndured Tumultuous Childhood\n\nFreeman endured a tumultuous childhood, and he prefers not to reveal much in interviews about his early years. The fourth child in the family, he was born on June 1, 1937, in Clarksdale, Mississippi. While still an infant, he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. She died when Freeman was six years old, and he spent the next several years traveling with his mother from Chicago to Nashville, Tennessee, and finally to Greenwood, Mississippi, where they settled down.\n\nLike most youngsters of his generation, Freeman loved the movies. \"When I was a kid, it cost 12 cents to go to the movies,\" he related in a People interview with Susan Toepfer. \"If you could find a milk bottle, you could sell it for a nickel. Soda and beer bottles were worth 2 cents. If you were diligent, you could come up with movie money every day.\" The World War II-era films Freeman saw inspired him to be a fighter pilot. At first, drama served mainly as a pastime until he could enter the armed services.\n\nFreeman's acting hobby began in junior high school. He was trying to gain the attention of a girl named Barbara by pulling her chair out from beneath her. His teacher grabbed him and took him to a room where they were preparing for a drama tournament. Freeman recalled to New York, \"Well, we do this play 'bout a family with a wounded son just home from the war—I play his kid brother. We win the district championship, we win the state championship, and dadgummit, I'm chosen as best actor. All 'cause I pull this chair out from under Barbara.\"\n\nFreeman's tale shows that he exhibited talent early but did not take acting seriously, even when others recognized his skill. After graduating from high school in Greenwood he entered the U.S. Air Force, hoping to become a pilot. Aptitude tests showed that he had the ability, but he was instead assigned duties as a mechanic and a radar technician. \"I was aced out,\" he explained in Esquire. \"Racism, the southern old-boy network. I had a sergeant who interposed himself between me and the casual barracks [stockade]—I was insolent. I called a horse's ass a horse's ass, even if it was wearin' brass. The whole thing in the service, you're supposed to look down. Never could do that.\"\n\nFirst Hollywood, Then Broadway\n\nFreeman spent his spare time while in the Air Force contemplating other careers, and he ultimately decided to become an actor. He left the service in 1959 and headed straight for Hollywood. Once there, he looked up the address of Paramount Studios in the telephone book and went over to apply for a job. Only when he noticed that the questions on the application concerned familiarity with office machinery and typing did it dawn upon him that he would not be hired as an actor on the spot. He opted to follow a more conventional route, taking acting classes at Los Angeles City College while supporting himself as a clerk. He also took dancing lessons, becoming good enough to land a part-time job performing at the 1964 World's Fair in New York.\n\nBy his own admission, Freeman did not gain much insight from his acting classes. \"I'm not much for talking about acting,\" he noted in New York. \"I've been called an intuitive actor, and I guess that's right. I go with what I feel. It doesn't do me any good to intellectualize about it.\" Freeman moved to New York in the early 1960s and supported himself with a series of day jobs while auditioning for theatrical roles. At one point he even served as a counter man in a Penn Station doughnut stand. His first important part came in an off-Broadway play called The Nigger-Lovers, which opened and closed quickly in 1967.\n\nFreeman's brief experience in The Nigger-Lovers was valuable, however, because it helped him land a role in the all-black cast of Hello, Dolly, that opened on Broadway in 1967. When the show closed, he moved on to a series of off-Broadway and repertory plays in New York and elsewhere. In 1971 he was cast in The Electric Company, a television series produced by the Public Broadcasting System. On the air for five years, the educational show was aimed at school-aged children, and Freeman played a hip character called Easy Reader. The actor commented in People that he is still remembered for his role. \"It's like being known as Captain Kangaroo,\" he said. \"It irks me when I meet people who are parents now who talk about how they grew up with me.\"\n\nAt a Glance …\n\nBorn on June 1, 1937, in Clarksdale, MS; son of Grafton Curtis and Mayme Edna (Revere) Freeman; married Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, October 22, 1967 (divorced, 1979); married Myrna Colley-Lee (a costume designer), June 16, 1984; children: Alphonse, Saifoulaye, Deena, Morgana; ten grandchildren. Education: Attended Los Angeles City College. Military: U.S. Air Force, 1955-59.\n\nCareer : Actor, 1959-. Ground Zero Blues Club, Clarksdale, MS, co-owner; Madidi Restaurant, Clarksdale, MS, co-owner.\n\nSelected awards : Clarence Derwent Award, Drama Desk Award, and Antoinette Perry Award nomination, 1978, The Mighty Gents; Obie Award, 1987, for stage version of Driving Miss Daisy; NYC Film Critics Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Award, Golden Globe nomination, and Academy Award nomination, 1987, Street Smart; Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nomination, 1989, Driving Miss Daisy; Academy Award nomination for The Shawshank Redemption, 1994; Academy Award winner for best supporting actor for Million Dollar Baby, 2005; Image Award, NAACP, for Million Dollar Baby, 2005; Guest of Honor, Cairo Film Festival, 2006; University of California-Los Angeles Spencer Tracy Award, 2006.\n\nAddresses: Home—Clarksdale, Mississippi. Agent—c/o WMA, 146 West 57th St., New York, NY 10019.\n\nFreeman drew his first major awards for his role in the play The Mighty Gents, produced at New York's Ambassador Theatre in 1978. Even though he won the Clarence Derwent Award, Drama Desk Award, and earned a Tony Award nomination, the play closed in nine days and Freeman was out of work. For a while he found himself scuffling for jobs. This experience taught him that awards do not guarantee success, and he has been decidedly indifferent about them ever since. Even when he won his Oscar in 2005 for Million Dollar Baby, his acceptance speech was brief.\n\nExcelled on the Stage\n\nThe New York Shakespeare Festival ultimately proved fertile ground for Freeman. There he appeared as the lead in Coriolanus in 1979 and had principal roles in Julius Caesar and Mother Courage and Her Children. His work in Coriolanus and Mother Courage earned him yet more awards, this time Obies. The breakthrough play for Freeman was The Gospel at Colonus, first performed in 1983. The musical, based on the ancient Greek drama about Oedipus—a mythical character who kills his father and marries his mother—is set in a modern Pentecostal church. The Gospel at Colonus featured Freeman as the preacher, a charismatic Oedipus figure around which the frenzied action revolved. Freeman won yet another Obie Award as best actor in a drama, and the play eventually moved to Broadway in 1988 with Freeman still in the lead.\n\nFreeman's success with the New York Shakespeare Festival helped him to land a starring role in the stage play Driving Miss Daisy, for which he won an additional Obie Award. The drama examines the close friendship that develops between a wealthy Jewish widow and her black chauffeur, Hoke, in the post-Civil War South. By the time he appeared in Driving Miss Daisy, on stage, Freeman had also earned several film roles, most notably in the Robert Redford vehicle Brubaker and Harry and Son, starring Paul Newman. And because of Driving Miss Daisy's success in the theater, Freeman was eager to portray Hoke in a film version.\n\nThe actor almost missed his chance. In 1987 he took the part of a near-psychotic pimp in the movie Street Smart. Although the film was a box-office flop, Freeman's powerful performance earned him an Academy Award nomination. \"Street Smart essentially serves as a backdrop for Freeman's tour de force performance,\" Anthony DeCurtis wrote in Rolling Stone. \"As the Yoo-Hoo-swilling Fast Black, he alternates fierceness with irresistible charm, engaging intelligence with a bone-chilling capacity for evil. He is the epitome of knowingness.\" The stage director of Driving Miss Daisy admitted that he never would have hired Freeman to play Hoke had he seen the actor as the menacing Fast Black first.\n\nDrove \"Miss Daisy\" to a Film Career\n\nFreeman's portrayal in the violent Street Smart, however, did not deter the makers of the critically acclaimed 1989 film version of Driving Miss Daisy from casting him in his original role of the kind-hearted Hoke. Once again Freeman was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor. That year he took another important role, this time as a grave digger-turned-soldier in the Civil War epic Glory. The film, a poignant drama about an all-black regiment that was chosen to lead an assault on a Southern fort, received much praise and provided Freeman just the sort of work he relished. \"I've been offered Black quasi-heroes who get hanged at the end,\" he said in Essence. \"I won't do a part like that. If I do a hero, he's going to live to the end of the movie.\" Freeman's character in Glory—eventually promoted and decorated—is indeed one of the last fighters to die as his battalion storms the fort.\n\nNoted for his subtle but scathing critiques of negative representations of African Americans on stage and in films, Freeman chooses his roles carefully. After ending the 1980s with a hectic spate of film and stage work, he took a brief breather before accepting work on a new project. Cast as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of The Taming of the Shrew in 1990, Freeman generated lavish reviews, and he subsequently appeared as Azeem, a Moor, in the 1991 Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Robin Hood opened to mixed reviews. It was labeled a politically correct film.\n\nFreeman received another Academy award nomination for his portrayal of a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption. He also made his debut as a director in Bopha! with Danny Glover and Alfre Woodard, but told Jerry Roberts of Variety, \"For directing, you've got to really enjoy it. It's time-consuming and it's not lucrative. Call me an actor who has directed.\"\n\nFreeman also turned in standout performances in such films as Outbreak, Unforgiven, and Deep Impact. He had an important role in Amistad, a historically based film about slavery-bound Africans who revolted and fought for their freedom all the way to the Supreme Court. Freeman was given his first starring vehicle, Kiss The Girls, and another film, Seven, was his first top-grossing film. Known for playing good guys and everyday Joes, he portrayed the villain in Chain Reaction and Hard Rain. Freeman told Morgan Dean of WRIC-TV that he was \"looking for characters to play and looking to have fun playing. I'm not drawn to any certain characters at all. I like playing what's eclectic.\"\n\nA Veteran Supporting Actor\n\nIn 2004, Freeman starred in The Big Bounce, an adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard. His best year came in 2005, when he won his Oscar for Million Dollar Baby. Freeman played Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, an ex-fighter who helps trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) develop waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) thrive in the ring. Swank won best actress, Eastwood best director, and the film itself took best picture. Freeman also earned an Image Award from the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 2006, Freeman starred in Lucky Number Slevin, a slick crime thriller, in which he plays a crime boss. In Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that the film is \"stylish as hell with sharp dialogue, a tongue-in-cheek plot and visual and editing razzle-dazzle.\" In that same year, he received the Spencer Tracy Award from the University of California-Los Angeles. The award ceremony included a video retrospective of Freeman's career, including his performance in Lucky Number Slevin.\n\nAs he passed his 70th birthday, Freeman continued to find a variety of roles that took advantage of his wry smile and his calm yet playful disposition. In 2007 Freeman played the role of God in 2007's Evan Almighty, a comedy that co-stars Steve Carrell, and was also cast as Jack Doyle in Gone Baby Gone, a crime thriller that marked the directorial debut of Ben Affleck. He was scheduled to appear in the next installment in the Batman franchise, The Dark Knight, in 2008, but Freeman's fans were most excited about his scheduled appearance as South African president Nelson Mandela in The Human Factor, scheduled for 2009. Freeman said: \"I have known Nelson Mandela personally for quite some time, and am continually in awe of his enormous presence in the world. The opportunity to portray him in this film is a great honor.\"\n\nSuccess has allowed Freeman to indulge himself at length in his favorite hobby—sailing. One of his acquisitions is a 38-foot sailboat that he has piloted through the Caribbean and the North Atlantic. \"When you live in the world of make-believe, you need something real,\" he remarked in Time. \"I go sailing, I'm in the real world.\" Freeman is often accompanied on his trips by his second wife, costume designer Myrna Colley-Lee, and one of his seven grandchildren, E'Dena Hines.\n\nWhen not working, Freeman can also be found on his 44-acre farm near Clarksdale, Mississippi. There, Freeman has opened a blues bar, the Ground Zero Blues Club, and a fine-dining restaurant, Madidi. Freeman loves being far away from the glamour and pressures of Hollywood, he explained to the Washington Post. \"The big question was, ‘My Lord, you can live anywhere in the world you want, why did you choose Mississippi?’ My glib answer was, because I can live anywhere. But the true answer is that of any place I've ever been, this feels most like home. When I come here, when I hit Mississippi, everything is right.\" Freeman does not see himself as a star. \"As you work, you realize that stardom is really not what you want. You want steadiness,\" he told the Associated Press in Jet. \"Steady work is better than stardom. And for a character actor, stardom is anathema because once you become a star, it becomes you.\" Being one of the best character actors in show business, Morgan Freeman no longer needs to worry about steady work.\n\nSelected works\n\nFilms\n\nBrubaker, 1980.\n\nEyewitness, 1980.\n\nHarry and Son, 1983.\n\nTeachers, 1984.\n\nStreet Smart, 1987.\n\nClean and Sober, 1988.\n\nJohnny Handsome, 1988.\n\nLean on Me, 1989.\n\nDriving Miss Daisy, 1989.\n\nGlory, 1989.\n\nThe Bonfire of the Vanities, 1990.\n\nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves, 1991.\n\nUnforgiven, 1992.\n\n(Director) Bopha!, 1993.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption, 1994.\n\nOutbreak, 1995.\n\nSeven, 1995.\n\nMoll Flanders, 1996.\n\nChain Reaction, 1996.\n\nKiss the Girls, 1997.\n\nAmistad, 1997.\n\nDeep Impact, 1998.\n\nHard Rain, 1998.\n\n(And executive producer) Under Suspicion, 2000.\n\nNurse Betty, 2000.\n\n(And producer) Along Came a Spider, 2001.\n\nHigh Crimes, 2002.\n\nThe Sum of All Fears, 2002.\n\n(And executive producer) Levity, 2003.\n\nDreamcatcher, 2003.\n\nBruce Almighty, 2003.\n\nGuilt by Association, 2004.\n\nThe Big Bounce, 2004.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby, 2004.\n\nDanny the Dog, 2005.\n\nBatman Begins, 2005.\n\nWar of the Worlds, 2005.\n\nEdison, 2005.\n\nAn Unfinished Life, 2005.\n\nLucky Number Slevin, 2006.\n\nThe Contract, 2006.\n\nEvan Almighty, 2007.\n\nGone Baby Gone, 2007.\n\nThe Dark Knight, scheduled 2008.\n\n(And producer) The Human Factor, scheduled 2009.\n\nPlays\n\nThe Nigger-Lovers, 1967.\n\nHello, Dolly, 1967.\n\nJungle of Cities, 1969.\n\nSisyphus and the Blue-Eyed Cyclops, 1975.\n\nCockfight, 1977.\n\nThe Mighty Gents, 1978.\n\nWhite Pelicans, 1978.\n\nCoriolanus, 1979.\n\nJulius Caesar, 1979.\n\nMother Courage and Her Children, 1980.\n\nBuck, 1982.\n\nThe Gospel at Colonus, 1983.\n\nMedea and the Doll, 1984.\n\nDriving Miss Daisy, 1987.\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew, 1990.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Electric Company, 1971-75.\n\nHollow Image, 1979.\n\nAttica, 1980.\n\nAnother World, 1982-84.\n\nThe Atlanta Child Murders, 1985.\n\nResting Place, 1986.\n\nFlight for Life, 1987.\n\nClinton and Nadine, 1988.\n\nThe Civil War, 1990.\n\nThe Promised Land, 1995.\n\n(Producer) Mutiny, 1999.\n\nSlavery and the Making of America, 2005.\n\nSources\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Vol. 3: Actors and Actresses, 4th ed., St. James Press, 2000.\n\nTracy, Kathleen, Morgan Freeman: A Biography, Barricade Books, 2006.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nChicago Defender, June 22-24, 2007, p. 22.\n\nEbony, April 1990.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, October 22, 1993; December 1, 2006, p. 31.\n\nEsquire, June 1988.\n\nEssence, December 1988.\n\nHollywood Reporter, January 23, 2006.\n\nJet, March 6, 1989; October 16, 1995; March 27, 2006, p. 32.\n\nNew York, March 14, 1988.\n\nNew York Times, June 22, 2007, p.

While he may have been a known quantity to discerning theatergoers, he was barely a name (if not a face) to the public at large: His greatest mass exposure had come during the 1970s, when he played \"Easy Reader\" on the PBS children's series The Electric Company. As late as 1983—even after winning two Obie Awards, Clarence Derwent and Drama Desk awards, and a Tony nomination—he seriously considered abandoning acting and becoming a taxi driver.\n\nFreeman's career went on the permanent upswing in 1987 when he riveted audiences as Fast Black, a vicious, slyly evil pimp, in the grade-B urban crime drama Street Smart. He was especially effective as his character segued from relaxed cordiality to menacing, frightening evil. Not all moviegoers immediately became aware of Freeman, because Street Smart is a genre film that appealed only to a narrow audience. Nevertheless, critics who otherwise might pass by such a film were taken by his memorable acting. Pauline Kael, one of the most influential of all American critics, asked point-blank in her review, \"Is Morgan Freeman the greatest American actor?\" As a result, Freeman earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, a rare feat for a performance in a film like Street Smart.\n\nOne of Freeman's most memorable characterizations came in a film that is strikingly dissimilar to Street Smart: Driving Miss Daisy, set in the pre-integration South, in which he plays Hoke Colburn, a modest, unpretentious black man hired as chauffeur to a petulant white lady (Jessica Tandy). Freeman, who also played the role on stage, makes Hoke likable and deeply sympathetic. His subtle performance also allows the viewer a peek into the soul of a black man who not only had come of age but had grown to maturity in a segregated Southern society. Freeman and Tandy's performances blend beautifully together, and both actors earned Oscar nominations. She, and not he, won the statuette, but his performance as Hoke nonetheless served as testimony that the actor was no Oscar nominee one-shot.\n\nFreeman is capable of creating a wide range of characters. If he played a bad guy who was tough and satanic in Street Smart, he also could play good guys who are tough and dynamic (real-life high school principal Joe Clark in Lean on Me); tough and thoughtful (the grave digger who becomes a Civil War infantry recruit in Glory, the ex-addict who conducts a therapy group in Clean and Sober); and tough and world-weary (the veteran cop on the trail of a serial killer in Se7en). In Deep Impact, a disaster epic about a comet set to crash into Earth, he is a commanding and reassuring presence as a U.S. President: yet another role that is the direct opposite of the one that earned him celluloid stardom.\n\nIn Driving Miss Daisy, Freeman shined in a starring role; yet he also has had the sense to accept quality roles in quality films even if those parts are satellites of the scenario's main character. This was the case in Unforgiven, in which Freeman plays Clint Eastwood's cowboy buddy; and The Shawshank Redemption, in which he is cast as the wizened veteran convict who befriends falsely convicted Tim Robbins. For the latter film, Freeman netted his third Oscar nomination. One major film in which he was sorely underused is Amistad, Steven Spielberg's pre-Civil War morality tale, in which Freeman plays a former slave/Boston abolitionist; Anthony Hopkins and Djimon Hounsou have the showy roles, and give the flashy performances. And he has emerged unscathed from his few unwise career choices, most notoriously his casting as the judge in the mega-bomb The Bonfire of the Vanities.\n\nIn 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut with Bopha!, a tense, politically savvy drama about Master Sergeant Micah Mangena (Danny Glover), a black policeman in a South African township. Mangena teaches his class of new recruits that their job is to \"uphold the law, and maintain the peace.\" To many, in particular South Africa's political radicals, Mangena is little more than an Uncle Tom, a tool of the white ruling class, a cog in a system in which blacks are oppressed. His world is destined to crumble, and he will undergo a crisis of conscience, when his son, whom he expects to become a police officer, takes part in a rebellion against the discipline and curriculum of the local white-run school. This choice of projects serves as evidence that Freeman is fully aware of his role as an African-American artist, and that he is concerned with examining black characters in all their flaws and contradictions.\n\n—Rob Edelman"
