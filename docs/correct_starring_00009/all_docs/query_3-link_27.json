Gen. William \"Billy\" Ford. The film, based on the 1994 nonfiction book \"The Hot Zone,\" is about a virus outbreak in Zaire and later in California.\n\nIn 1990, Freeman provided the voice of abolitionist Frederick Douglass in \"The Civil War,\" a TV miniseries about the Civil War.\n\nFreeman also narrated \"The True Story of Glory Continues,\" a 1991 documentary about the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.\n\nIn the 2002 military and spy thriller, \"The Sum of All Fears,\" Freeman plays William \"Bill\" Cabot, director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn the 2002 film, \"High Crimes,\" Freeman plays Charlie Grimes, a former military attorney.\n\nAmong Freeman's many accolades, are:\n\nAn Academy Award for \"Million Dollar Baby\" and a Golden Globe Award for best actor in \"Driving Miss Daisy.\"\n\nFreeman currently lives in Charleston, Mississippi."
