Gus Johnson Biography

Johnson called numerous sports for CBS Sports with his most recognized role as a play-by-play announcer for CBS' March Madness which he worked each year from 1996 to 2011. Johnson is particularly known for his calls at the end of several close NCAA Tournament games. On his first day of calling tournament games for CBS in 1996 he called Princeton's 43-41 win over UCLA. His other famous games include UCLA's 17-point comeback over Gonzaga in 2006 including double-overtime Xavier vs Kansas State game on March 25 2010 and George Mason's upset of Villanova in 2011. Johnson worked for the Madison Square Garden Network (MSG) from 1994â€“2010 where he was the radio play-by-play and backup television play-by-play announcer of the NBA's New York Knicks in addition to providing television play-by-play for MSG's coverage of the WNBA's New York Liberty. With the Knicks he was well known for some of his calls. For example one famous Gus line occurs after Knicks forward Al Harrington scores: My name is Al Harrington... And I get Buckets! Perhaps Johnson's most famous Knicks call was his yelling and screaming during Allan Houston's last second shot to knock off the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the 1999 playoffs en route to an unlikely NBA Finals appearance. Johnson has also provided commentary for MSG's coverage of the Golden Gloves Tournament and served as host of the Yankees ScoreCard and SportsDesk as well as the New York Rangers and Knicks GameNight.
