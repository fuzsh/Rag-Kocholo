        "text": "Fox Sports covers plenty of Ohio State football games during the year, and when they do, it's often Gus Johnson and Joel Klatt on the call. Johnson has become known for his emphatic calls on the broadcasts, often being considered one of the best at providing the energy on play-by-play.\n\nAnd when it's Ohio State providing the excitement, Johnson has picked up a unique way to refer to the team: the world famous Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nOhio State is certainly widely known in the United States. The Buckeyes' football program keeps them in the mainstream at all times, as does the school's massive alumni network.\n\nMORE: Will Michigan-Ohio State rematches in future be good for The Game?\n\nBut college football isn't huge outside of Columbus, so why does Johnson refer to the Buckeyes as \"world famous?\" The Sporting News takes a look.\n\nWhy Gus Johnson calls Ohio State 'world famous'\n\nThere certainly could be some people outside the United States who consider the Buckeyes' football program to be world famous, but that's not why Johnson has deemed them internationally significant. In fact, it has nothing to do with football at all.\n\nIt is because of Jesse Owens.\n\nJohnson spoke at Ohio State's campus on Nov. 10, two days before the team's game against Indiana, during which he spoke about his terming of the Buckeyes as \"world famous.\" He said that when Owens ran in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, claiming four gold medals, that he put Ohio State on the international map.\n\n\"The whole world knew about Jesse and Ohio State,\" Johnson said. \"So that's why when you see me call the game nowadays and you may hear me say, 'the world famous Ohio State University. The world famous Ohio State University.' That is an ode to him. And it's something that we can never forget.\"\n\nMORE: What is a buckeye? Explaining Ohio State's nickname\n\nJohnson elaborated further on the broadcast of the Indiana game.\n\n\"My father, he talked about Jesse almost from the time I could hear and what he did when the world was on the brink of war, how he won those four gold medals in Berlin in front of a bad man who was promoting a bad theory of racial superiorities,\" Johnson said.. \"Can never forget that. There's a whole world that found out about Jesse, about Ohio State during that time, showing us that we could beat that dude at his house.\"\n\nOwens, a Black track and field star at Ohio State, competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics at a point where Adolf Hitler was looking to put Aryan and German superiority on display on the biggest international sports stage. According to ESPN, a German official said Americans were letting \"non-humans, like Owens and other Negro athletes\" compete in the Olympics.\n\nIn what was supposed to be a display of German and Aryan athletic superiority in Berlin, Owens won all four events in which he competed, claiming gold in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and long jump. ESPN's Larry Schwartz wrote Owens \"single-handedly crushed Hitler's myth of Aryan supremacy.\"\n\nThe Buckeyes football team might be famous across the U.S. for being consistently one of the best teams in the nation. But as for international recognition, it doesn't get much bigger than what Owens did in Berlin in 1936."
