Some hero on Twitter reminded us of this fact by putting together a compilation of his best calls during the 2017-18 college football season.\n\n“Denzel Ward! You got barbecue back there, and you didn’t invite me? HURT MY FEELINGS!”\n\nI’m not quite sure what that means in the context of football but I do know this: The season cannot get here soon enough.\n\n[jwplayer JND3P7gh-t2dCqACG]"
