        "text": "Gus Johnson has one of the great American voices. When he announces a game, his commentary rumbles and rumbles and then, as the drama hits a peak, he POPS—or, EXPLODES. If you weren't so overcome with emotion, you might be concerned about his oxygen intake. As a lifetime basketball fan, he was a natural for calling the thrills of March Madness, which he announced for fifteen years. He's also done play-by-play for the NBA and football; in college, he played baseball. But a little over a year ago, he defected from the Big Three American Sports to... soccer. The most doctrinaire of Americanized sports fans might call it treachery. And come this Saturday, he'll be calling the final game of the world's most important professional soccer tournament, the Champions League (2:45 EST, on Fox), which might be up against a playoff game from his old orange-leather love. And so we asked him...\n\nESQUIRE.COM: Why do you think soccer is a better sport than basketball?\n\nGUS JOHNSON: Well, I'm not going to say it's a better sport, now. But it's a great sport. It's not a better—I can't, I can't say that, man. I'd get crucified. [Laughs] But it's a great sport. It's the world's sport! We love basketball. We love it. But over here, this is bigger than religion. I think that's what makes it special.\n\nWhere in the world are you? It sounds like you're outside.\n\nI'm sitting here in beautiful London on a great day. I'm having a Guinness. Extra, extra, extra cold, baby. [Laughs]\n\nFrom one of those big silver taps?\n\nYes. I'll take a picture and send it to you.\n\nPlease do.\n\nSo now that you've been watching more, what's something you've been picking up on that casual—or completely new—fans may not be looking for?\n\nI don't think people realize how physical this game is. This is a rough, rough game. Elbows. Head-butts. Knees to the thigh. Stepping on ankles—and feet. You've got really tiny bones in the top of your foot. And when these guys come down with their spikes on the top of one's foot or one's ankle—that looks like it really hurts. And, when you compare it to basketball, you see a set piece or a corner kick, and you see those guys crashing down in the six-yard box, elbows up, heads angling toward the ball where you could head-butt somebody. There's a lot of pushing and shoving and grabbing. I remember doing a [San Jose] Earthquakes game, and there was a corner kick, and a kid from the Earthquakes got grabbed by players from the Red Bulls—he broke his shoulder. There wasn't even a foul called on the play.\n\nDamn.\n\nI think that's the one thing that casual fans should pay attention to and have a sense of is that these guys, when they go on a run, sometimes it's 50, 60, 70 yards. It's a sprint. These athletes are in incredible shape. They're incredible specimens of man.\n\nSo how aware of soccer were you when you were growing up? I know you played the big three American sports: baseball, football, and basketball.\n\nI remember there was a kid named Larry Kuzniar that I played baseball with in high school, but he was also the best soccer player at my school. Larry was a rugged guy—kinda crazy. \"The Kuz,\" we used to call him. We were in the dugout one time, and we were playing a game, and right before the game, Larry came up to me and was like, \"Man, I'm not playing today,\" and I said, \"Why?\" And he was like, \"I just broke my hand.\" I was like \"How'd you break your hand?\" \"I just punched that pole.\" I was like, \"What? You punched the pole? Why did you punch the pole? Why didn't you kick the pole?\" He's like, \"I'm a soccer player. I can't mess my feet up.\" [Laughs]\n\nWhat about when you were in college?\n\nWell you know, my college, Howard University, when I was in school, we played for the national championship twice. We lost to Santa Clara, and I think Indiana. And I think, Dr. Joe, the official [who went on to become a FIFA match commissioner and U.S. national team assistant coach]—and I give him shit on this all the time—he called a penalty in the box, which was really a no-call. Some guy drove into the box and flopped, and we lost one-nil, on Dr. Joe's phantom penalty.\n\nBut in basketball, most of the time everyone calls that \"drawing a foul\"! There's such a gap in how Americans describe what happens constantly in basketball and what happens occasionally in soccer.\n\nWell I hated it when Reggie Miller would flop. I'm a Knicks fan. He is the poster child for flopping. I hated it then. I hate it now. But in football, if you dive and draw a foul in the penalty area it can change the game. That's the difference. Come on, man, don't be coming down on the National Basketball Association.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nYou've got to give us some love. This ain't about killing the NBA. That's my league.\n\nI love the playoffs. Not so sure about its regular season. Has it been hard for you to catch games during your international travels?\n\nNot really. I'm a member of the Playboy Club here in London, so last night we went there and watched the game—sat there, ate chicken wings, drinking beer—you've got to put on a suit—got Playboy bunnies right there, so it was pretty nice. There are some positives about this experience, now. [Laughs]\n\nIs it weird to have Playboy bunnies with British accents?\n\nIt's not weird, man. It's a beautiful thing. [Laughs]\n\nA couple minutes ago I heard you call soccer \"football.\"\n\nPeople over here give me crap, that's why I don't say \"soccer.\" I call it \"world football.\" I like saying football. And footballers. I like it—it's rugged.\n\nBetter than saying \"soccer players.\"\n\n\"He's a footballer.\"\n\nWorld Cup prediction?\n\nYou know, I know France is 25-to-1. If I was a betting man, I'd bet on France, just because of the odds and because of the talent.\n\nWho do you like?\n\nI love Karim Benzema. I love Franck Ribéry. I love this kid Paul Pogba. He's a hell of a scorer. So I just think they have quality. They're crazy. [Manchester City player] Samir Nasri was left off the team. His girlfriend wasn't too happy about that.\n\nShe and I agree—I'm a Manchester City fan.\n\nWell congratulations. Two titles in three years, baby.\n\nWe're like Howard University.\n\nHey—no, you won. We lost. Because of Dr. Joe."
