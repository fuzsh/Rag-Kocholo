        "text": "Ahead of the start to Big East conference play on New Year's Eve, Fox Sports 1 autotuned a selection of Bill Raftery and Gus Johnson's best calls.\n\nThe mashup came in advance of a marathon of Big East conference games that started at noon on Dec. 31.\n\nJohnson and Raftery are known for their boundless and inimitable enthusiasm. When accompanied by the driving beats of an autotune track, their commentary will leave you fired up, even if the games have already been played.\n\nOn Wednesday, Seton Hall beat St. John's, 78-67, Villanova beat Butler, 67-55, DePaul defeated Marquette, 61-58, Creighton lost to Providence, 65-53, and Xavier beat Georgetown, 70-53.\n\nLooking back on such a slate of games, and ahead to a season of Big East play, Gus Johnson no doubt put it best: \"Woo.\"\n\n- Christopher Woody"
