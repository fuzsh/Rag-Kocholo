Gus Johnson, who currently calls play-by-plays for Fox Sports, recently drove down $3.1 million for a posh, all-white affair located along Marina Del Rey’s Ballona Lagoon in an off-market deal.\n\nJohnson’s new purchase boasts three bedrooms and four bathrooms within 4,476 square feet. The exterior of the residence is covered in a smooth white stucco, has a modern, upscale beach house construction that’s commonly found throughout the area and a two-car garage with direct access to the street. Those ritzy beachy vibes can be found inside the home, too. Calacatta marble tiles, recessed lighting, floor-to-ceiling picture windows and pure white, Miami-esque walls can be found throughout its interiors.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nReese Witherspoon Buys $16 Million Brentwood Estate\n\nSports Agent Aidy Ward Sells $14.1 Million Bel Air Mansion\n\nSuperior Oil Heir Jonathan Sutton-Day Lists Uniquely Modified 1920s Tudor Revival\n\nStepping into the mansion, guests will find themselves facing the formal living area which features a small inset fireplace decorated with the same tiles that line the floor and a dramatic series of floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the languid lagoon. A large sliding glass door provides access to the residence’s large patio area that would be the perfect place to take in the scenery after a long day of narrating games.\n\nNot too far from the formal living area is the dining room, which is separated from the kitchen by a glassy, mirrored built-in buffet. In keeping with the home’s modern aesthetic, the kitchen has an almost futuristic feel to it. It sports a black quartz backsplash and matching countertops, parquet flooring, a large kitchen island with breakfast bar seating and an ample amount of cabinetry that’s been painted a chic shade of light gray. In addition to the formal sitting area, there’s a casual family area that lies adjacent to the kitchen, with lots of built-in book shelving and a fireplace with a black quartz mantle and hearth.\n\nInstead of just one master suite, it looks like Johnson’s new digs actually have two master bedrooms. The first master suite has carpeted floors, a small fireplace and a sliding glass that looks out over the lagoon and provides access to the suite’s private balcony. There’s also a master bathroom with a garden tub, dual sinks and a standalone walk-in shower. Despite being a bit dated in appearance, it is fairly large. The second master suite, which is located on the top floor of the estate, doesn’t have enjoy floor-to-ceiling windows, but it does have access to its own private balcony. This suite enjoys a fully fleshed out master bath that also has a walk-in closet area.\n\nUnlike some of Johnson’s neighbors, his new home boasts a sizable backyard covered with green grass. However, the place where the sportscaster will most likely want to entertain will be the property’s luxurious rooftop patio which features plenty of space to entertain in as well as an azure-tiled, triangular wading pool.\n\nLaunch Gallery: Inside Gus Johnson's New Marina Del Rey Home"
