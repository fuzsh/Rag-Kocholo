        "text": "Even the most experienced broadcasters have a slip-up during a game. Fox's Gus Johnson had one hilarious moment while calling a Caitlin Clark block on Brinae Alexander during Saturday's Big Ten battle between No. 3 Iowa and Maryland.\n\nMidway through the first quarter of Saturday's matchup in College Park, Alexander tried to make a move on Clark at the basket. But the Iowa star blocked the shot and quickly got the ball to the other end of the floor.\n\nDuring the play, Johnson had an NSFW Freudian slip, which got plenty of attention on social media.\n\nFollowing the block, Johnson said, \"Brinae Alexander had her s*** blocked.\" The veteran announcer then quickly corrected himself, saying \"shot blocked.\"\n\nHonestly, both phrases applied during that moment. But it was a really funny moment during the game, especially coming from such an experienced broadcaster like Johnson.\n\nJohnson called an entertaining contest in College Park on Saturday night. Maryland gave Iowa a great battle, but fell short of an upset. The Hawkeyes prevailed 93-85, getting 38 points and 12 assists from Clark. Molly Davis had 17 points and Kate Martin also had a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nMaryland was led by Jakia Brown-Turner, who scored 25 points and collected nine boards. Bri McDaniel added 22 points and Shyanne scored 14 points with eight assists.\n\nIowa improved to 21-2 on the season while Maryland dropped to 12-10.\n\nRelated Big Ten stories"
