        "text": "Gustav Emil \"Gus\" Johnson (born: June 20, 1995 (1995-06-20) [age 29]) is an American comedian and YouTuber from the small town of Grantsburg, Wisconsin. He is currently residing in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAbout[]\n\nHe is well known for videos such as Recording a Spotify Ad, Wipe it Like it's Hot, and various others, with Every Cat At 3AM (along with numerous other videos) being featured on YouTube's Trending page.\n\nHe has appeared on Smosh Pit several times. In videos such as \"2 TRUTHS 1 LIE w/ GUS JOHNSON\" and \"TRY NOT TO LAUGH CHALLENGE #5 w/ GUS JOHNSON\". In the past, he had also done pranks, though he mainly focuses on skits in the current age.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nGus Johnson was born to Debra Johnson (n√©e Allaman), a volleyball coach and former English teacher. His father, Pete Johnson, works for an electric utility company and is a baseball coach. Johnson grew up in Grantsburg, Wisconsin with three younger siblings, including his younger brothers and frequent collaborators Sven and Thor.\n\nIn middle school, Johnson filmed \"stupid sketches that kids would think are funny\". He was elected governor of Badger Boys State in 2013 and graduated from Grantsburg High School in 2014. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Stout with a degree in entertainment design concentrated on digital cinema. He later moved to Los Angeles with fellow YouTuber Eddy Burback.\n\nHistory[]\n\nJohnson started his YouTube channel in 2010 with his first video, \"Ian's Song\". He then went on to create meme videos starring himself and friends, which gradually became more popular. His first viral video was \"How To Get Free Food From Subway\".\n\nJohnson has also released music on YouTube since the beginning of his career. He released the album \"Lighting Rods and Leaky Roofs\" with hometown friend Joe Dumas in 2015, and the album \"Champagne Seats\" in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Johnson made a podcast with his friend and fellow YouTuber Eddy Burback titled OK I'll Talk. The two later moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles and created a new show, The Gus & Eddy Podcast. This podcast is similar to OK I'll Talk, and occasionally features guests. In late 2017, Johnson also branched into longform comedy, using Kickstarter to raise funds for a comedy series on a run-down golf course called \"Par 9\".\n\nIn January 2019, Johnson received a Shorty Awards nomination for \"Best YouTube Comedian\". On April 10, 2019, Johnson's channel hit 1 million subscribers on YouTube during his appearance on the H3 Podcast. He celebrated with a video titled \"Thank you for 1 million\", in which he thanked everyone who had helped him along the way. In 2019, he signed a talent deal with Viacom to create content for Comedy Central.\n\nControversy[]\n\nGus and Sabrina had been dating for years and he would often feature her in his videos, but in 2021, Gus announced that the couple had broken up.[1]\n\nLater, it came out years prior to their breakup, Sabrina was going through an ectopic surgery while she was pregnant, and Gus wanted her to abort and threatened to break up if she kept the baby. During the surgery, he chose to go out for beers instead of supporting her, despite the surgery having a high possibility of being fatal, and was also heavily verbally abusive towards her, telling her things like \"any other guy in this case would leave you\". When Sabrina was recounting the incident, she didn't mention Gus by name and instead said it was an \"unnamed boyfriend\", but it was quickly found to be Gus through an old Instagram post of his.[2]\n\nIn 2021, Sabrina had to go through rhinoplasty surgery, and Gus chose to not support her and instead play Pokemon cards on stream. Finally on October 22, 2021, she uploaded a video detailing the abuse Gus had put her through (although the video was more about the neglect she had suffered from the healthcare services). After Sabrina spoke out, Eddy Burback, Gus' long time best friend, roommate and podcast co-host announced that he would be cutting all ties with Gus. Later, Gus tweeted out an apology and announced he was stepping away from his podcast, cancelling/refunding all his scheduled shows and leaving YouTube for a while.[3][4][5][6][7] Many YouTubers such as Amanda The Jedi, Seamus Gorman, Illymation and Comic Drake amongst others gave her their condolences.\n\nThree weeks later, Gus suddenly returned with a new comedy sketch. It was also criticized for being extremely tone deaf as it was about someone who faked their medical conditions. Many people theorized that he returned due to YouTube banning dislikes, though according to browser extensions that show them, it was mass disliked.\n\nOn January 24, 2022, Gus would upload a 4-minute video where he explained his feelings towards the situation and how he was feeling at every turn. He spoke about his shortcomings and the impact he had on Sabrina, mentioning the two went to couple's therapy.[8] Even though the initial reception was positive, with the likes outweighing the dislikes by three times, many detractors slammed the video as Gus continued to downplay the effects of his abuse on Sabrina. Sabrina herself criticized the video and said they never went to couple's therapy.[9] Gus then attempted to debunk her by insisting they did go to a therapist, but it turned out that said \"therapist\" was a dating coach Tiktoker, and not a licensed professional.[10] Additionally, the sessions were not about couple's counselling, but actually about Gus expressing his desire to have sex with others while still being in a relationship with Sabrina.[11].On the 7th of February, Gus posted on his Instagram story alluding to a possible comeback, as he mentioned preparing some sketches and a return to streaming on Twitch.[12]\n\nOn April 6, 2022, Gus randomly joined PayMoneyWubby's stream for an interview about Gus' side of the story. In the interview, Gus explained that he was in no way trying to expose or rant about Sabrina and instead showed empathy for her pain during the situation. According to Gus, Sabrina and Gus were both unprepared for her pregnancy, both agreeing on her having an abortion, until she came out to Gus, regretting the decision of the abortion without informing Gus. According to Gus this caused him to \"have an inappropriate response\". After, Gus explained that he supported her when she was going through her later miscarriage, which allowed Wubby and Gus to talk about the ongoing meme of Gus going out for drinks while Sabrina was in serious pain. Johnson also commented on his \"stupidity\" in the situation and the pressure him and Sabrina had to go through. Soon after, they broke up after which Sabrina visited Gus' home to pick up her dog that Gus had been taking care of when Sabrina was out of town. She then surprised Gus with various gifts, wishing to get back together. When Gus rejected her after realizing it wouldn't work, Sabrina yelled at Gus, slammed the door and left, along with attempting to blackmail Gus that the rejection wasn't mutual. This eventually caused Sabrina to upload the video talking about Gus being abusive. Gus' side of the story, along with his empathetic tone and the fact that he wished to no longer address the situation, allowed various fans to forgive and feel bad for Gus.[13] Later, Sabrina started a stream explaining that mostly everything Gus said was false.[14]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe is of Norwegian and Swedish descent.\n\nHe was raised in a family of performers.\n\nHe is the older brother of Sven Johnson\n\nGus Johnson was nominated for the 2020 Tenth-Annual Streamy Awards in the Comedy category, which took place on December 13, 2020.\n\nGus has a hernia, as revealed in a Michael Reeves video[15].\n\nGus Johnson used to be a participant in the \"Gus & Eddy\" Podcast.\n\nIn 2020, on the Gus and Eddy Podcast, its said that he was found guilty by a jury of his peers of doing \"booger wall\" in 2008.\n\nGallery[]"
