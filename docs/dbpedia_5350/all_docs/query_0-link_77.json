        "text": "LONGTIME basketball commentator Gus Johnson has divided opinions after being caught vaping while working.\n\nThe Fox Sports sportscaster appeared to be working the Arizona Wildcats' 89-75 win over the Indiana Hoosiers back on December 10 when the footage was caught.\n\nWhile E-cigarettes aren't listed as prohibited at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, where the game took place, this hasn't stopped many from disapproving of Johnson's actions on social media.\n\nOne simply asked: \"How is this allowed\"\n\nAnother said: \"Rare Gus Johnson L [sad emoji]\"\n\nHowever, not everyone saw it this way, with one commenting: \"I hope he doesn’t get fired or suspended for this [skull emoji] everyone indulges in something, and if he ain’t hurting anybody else or bothering anyone, there should be no consequences for him. Bro needs to get his smoke on, I feel him!\"\n\nWhile one responded: \"Well he can’t go for a smoke break so he might as well do this.\"\n\nBut what a fair few fans took issue with wasn't his decision to vape, but the decision to capture his vaping on camera.\n\nOne fan commented: \"Dry snitching but don’t matter cause Gus Johnson the GOAT in fact this elevates his GOAT status another tier.\"\n\nAnd \"The GOAT\" was on hand to watch an exciting game in Nevada between the 10th-ranked Wildcats and 14th-ranked Hoosiers.\n\nSince their win in Vegas, Arizona has gone on to improve their record to 10-1, leaving them fifth in the Pac-12.\n\nIndiana, meanwhile, also lost their next game against Kansas and are now eighth in the Big Ten with an 8-3 record."
