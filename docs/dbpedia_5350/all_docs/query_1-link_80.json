        "text": "The legacy of Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Gus Johnson is alive and well during this high school basketball season.\n\nFour basketball players in Akron are family descendants of Johnson, a powerful star player at Central High School in the late 1950s. His career took him to the University of Idaho in the early 1960s, to the NBA with the Baltimore Bullets and Phoenix Suns from 1963-1972, and to the ABA with the Indiana Pacers in 1972-1973.\n\nJohnson, who stood 6-foot-6, died April 29, 1987, at age 48 from an inoperable brain tumor. He never met Janae Johnson, Perrion Johnson, Lunden McDay or Jayda Johnson, but family members feel that he would be proud of the teenagers.\n\n“Watching my grandpa Gus play on highlights, it inspires me more than anything,” said Janae Johnson, a 6-foot East senior who is the daughter of Raegan Johnson.\n\n“I want to carry on the name. I want everybody to be able to remember that Johnson name.”\n\nFirestone 5-11 senior Perrion Johnson and St. Vincent-St. Mary 6-3 junior Lunden McDay are Gus Johnson’s great-nephews, and Firestone 5-7 sophomore Jayda Johnson is a great-niece.\n\n“My family always talks about how they [Gus and his brother Perry] always came back to Akron and always showed love to Akron people,” said Lunden, the son of David and London McDay, and the grandson of Gus and Perry’s sister, Beulah Johnson McDay.\n\n“I have watched highlights of Gus from when he played in the NBA and he was great.”\n\nAdded Jayda: “They had good basketball IQ and they were very talented on the court.”\n\nPerrion Johnson said he has watched highlights of his grandfather, Perry Johnson, when he played at Robert Morris, and his great-uncle, Gus Johnson, when he played in the NBA for the Baltimore Bullets alongside Wes Unseld and Earl Monroe.\n\n“It feels good to be part of this family,” Perrion said. “It feels like I am part of their legacy, and I can help their legacy out and continue what Gus and Perry started back then. Now we are in the 2000s and I want to try and play pro basketball like Gus did one day. Another one of my goals is to try to break a backboard like him, too.”\n\nPerrion and Jayda are the children of Perry Jr. and Celeste, and Perry Sr.’s grandchildren.\n\n“Gus was an impact player with tremendous skills,” said Ron Linger, an East graduate and former Central-Hower football coach who now works in the Akron Public Schools athletic office. “It was always great to know that he was from our hometown.”\n\nStrong as a bull\n\nGus Johnson was born in Akron on Dec. 13, 1938, and became a basketball star known for his strength, passing and dunking abilities. He played with future Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond in high school, and later in life, Thurmond said he saw similarities between Johnson and LeBron James on the court.\n\n“My uncle Gus was real tough,” David McDay Jr. said. “My uncle Perry talked about Gus during the Hall of Fame speech in 2010 and said he never lifted a weight in his life, but he was built like a Greek god. If you go on YouTube, you can see and hear that.”\n\nJerome Lane, 51, met Gus Johnson when he was a young man. Lane was a basketball standout at St. V-M and the University of Pittsburgh, and later played in the NBA for the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and Cavaliers.\n\n“Gus was strong as a bull,” said Lane, an assistant coach with the Firestone boys basketball team. “He was athletic, he could run the floor and he could rebound. I once saw him grab a rebound off the backboard and throw the ball and hit the other backboard.”\n\nFirestone boys basketball head coach Dave Milo, 63, grew up in Cleveland and has fond memories of watching Gus Johnson play at the old Cleveland Arena and on television.\n\n“I loved watching Gus Johnson play basketball,” Milo said. “He was so athletic. This was before guys like Dr. J [Julius Erving] and Connie Hawkins. Gus’ athleticism was unbelievable. He had huge hands. Gus Johnson was the first man I ever saw do a tomahawk dunk. I swear he took off from the foul line extended and he just covered so much ground.\n\n“He is also the first man I saw break a backboard in an NBA exhibition game when he was playing for the Baltimore Bullets. He was very comparable to Elgin Baylor and to Dr. J.”\n\nEast girls basketball coach DA Anderson, 58, grew up in Warren, and said he loved watching NBA games, especially ones with Gus Johnson.\n\n“When I was 6 years old, my dad started getting Sports Illustrated and other sports magazines, so I actually have the Sports Illustrated [from October 1971] with Gus Johnson and Dave DeBusschere on the cover,” Anderson said. “I always watched the NBA on the weekends, and the New York Knicks were big rivals with the Bullets.\n\n“Gus was what they called back in the old days an ‘enforcer.’ He didn’t take any static in the paint. He was a tremendous rebounder and a tremendous defender, and in that sense, Janae embodies her grandfather because she can be relentless on the glass.”\n\nAnderson said the kids nowadays would refer to Gus Johnson as a “beast.” St. V-M boys basketball coach Dru Joyce II agrees.\n\n“Gus Johnson was super athletic,” said Joyce, 62, a native of East Liverpool. “I remember his length and athleticism in the NBA. He had a great career and was multidimensional. He didn’t just do one thing well, he did a lot of things well.\n\n“I think if there is any comparison of our guy Lunden McDay to him, that would be it. Lunden is multidimensional. He does a lot of things well just like Gus did during his playing career.”\n\nMichael Beaven can be reached at 330-996-3829 or mbeaven@thebeaconjournal.com.
