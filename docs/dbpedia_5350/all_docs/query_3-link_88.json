His unique voice and energetic style brought every game to life, making each play feel like a grand event. Linked here is some of those calls for those that want to travel down memory lane or simply get juiced up. However, the recent edition of the long awaited EA Sports College Football 2025 video game series cannot lack his iconic voice.\n\nGus Johnson has been a staple in sports broadcasting for over two decades. He's known for his enthusiastic delivery and ability to elevate any game he covers into an exciting spectacle. His absence from the video game will be deeply felt by many players who grew up listening to him.\n\nWe believe that including Gus Johnson as a commentator in the upcoming EA Sports College Football 2025 video game will not only enhance gameplay, but also pay homage to a beloved figure in sports broadcasting. We urge EA Sports, as well as other stakeholders involved in the production of these games, to consider our request seriously and not exclude an individual that would only heighten the gameplay experience due to his contract with a competitor.\n\nLet's bring back that nostalgic feeling and make our gaming experience even better! Please sign this petition if you want Gus Johnson back on your virtual football field!\n\nHe Could Go!"
