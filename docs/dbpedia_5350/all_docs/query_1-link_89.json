        "text": "If there wasn't enough excitement involved in Butler clinching a berth in the Final Four on Saturday, CBS announcer Gus Johnson helped make it even more memorable.\n\nJohnson, who also calls college basketball on the Big Ten Network and NFL action on CBS, has been a personal favorite of mine for the last few years and has developed a large fan base among college-aged sports fans.\n\nSome people might argue that Johnson is too over-the-top for their liking. But to me, he is a perfect fit for the action-packed NCAA tournament. I like to hear somebody who is passionate about sports and gets excited about game-changing plays just like the sports fans who are watching it on TV. Sports are meant to stir peoples' emotions and I like an announcer who lets those emotions loose on the microphone.\n\nOne sports call in particular has bothered me for the last few years. In Super Bowl XLII, the New York Giants' David Tyree somehow caught a pass by Eli Manning on one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history. Not only did the play help set up the game-winning touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress, but it also helped end the New England Patriots' chance at a historic undefeated season.\n\nBut in his play-by-play on FOX that night, Joe Buck delivered a rather boring, non-descriptive and unenthusiastic call of the Tyree catch. It has been something Buck has made a habit of throughout his announcing career. I think the most excited Buck ever got during a game was when he was outraged that Randy Moss \"fake mooned\" the crowd at Lambeau Field in a playoff game in 2005. I can only imagine how Johnson would have called the Tyree catch but I'm sure it would have been a lot more memorable than Buck's mediocre job.\n\nAs far as head CBS announcer Jim Nantz goes, I like and respect his work. However, I think his \"hello friends\" style is suited more for the Masters than the action-packed world of the NFL and the NCAA Tournament.\n\nBut as I watch Nantz work another Final Four this weekend, I hope it won't be too long before we hear Johnson saying \"rise and fire\" and \"haha\" on the biggest stage of college basketball."
