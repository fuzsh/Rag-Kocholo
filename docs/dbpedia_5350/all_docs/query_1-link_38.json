        "text": "Editor's note: This is the fourth in a series of profiles about members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2010.\n\nBefore LeBron James, Akron, Ohio, had another native son who went on to become an NBA star.\n\nGus Johnson went from the streets of the northeast Ohio city to an all-star career in professional basketball. He had his best years playing for the Baltimore Bullets, a franchise now known as the Washington Wizards.\n\nFour jerseys hang in the rafters at the Wizards' new home, the Verizon Center. They belong to Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes, Earl Monroe and Johnson. Prior to this year, only Johnson had not been chosen for the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"When you go back to that era, Gus Johnson was as complete a player as there was,\" former Utah Jazz coach Frank Layden said. \"He played with a fierceness.\"\n\nJohnson died of an inoperable brain tumor at age 48 on April 29, 1987, nearly four months after the Washington Bullets retired his jersey number 25.\n\nHis former teammates wonder what took so long because his credentials are right up there with others previously enshrined.\n\nJohnson was a five-time NBA All-Star (1965, '68-71) and a two-time member of the NBA's All-Defensive team (1970 and '71) who helped lead the Baltimore Bullets to five playoff appearances in nine seasons, including the 1971 NBA Finals. He played 10 years in the NBA and finished with totals of 9,944 points (17.1 per game) and 7,379 rebounds (12.7 per game). Johnson also played for the Phoenix Suns (1972-73) and was a member of the 1973 ABA Champion Indiana Pacers.\n\nHall of Fame Class of 2010 profiles\n\nMore Hall of Fame Links"
