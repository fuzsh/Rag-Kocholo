        "text": "Gus Johnson is a certified sports badass.\n\nGus Johnson is arguably one of the few sports broadcasters who has made his mark on multiple sports whether it be basketball, football, boxing, and even soccer. Gus Johnson is most famous for his plethora of exhilarating March Madness calls and can be considered, by many, one of the most exciting sports broadcasters of the modern-day crop. For many years, Gus Johnson was the backbone of CBS’ play-by-play commentary for the American phenomenon — March Madness along with Jim Nantz. Ever since Gus Johnson left to Fox because CBS Sports refused to match offers, March Madness has not had the same feeling as when Gus Johnson was a part of it. While some sports fans and viewers think his style is very overbearing and overdone, I think he is awesome.\n\nI think God sits in his Man Cave and says, “Which game is that Gus Johnson calling? I get a kick out of that guy. I think I’ll make his game exciting and see if he completely loses his mind.” — Bill Simmons"
