        "text": "Wilson went out with a concussion. That pretty tells you that it was forcible contact to his head from the defender’s helmet. In slow motion it doesn’t look bad, but you could hear Wilson’s helmet get smacked in regular speed. As far as the receiver putting his head down, like Klatt said, that doesn’t matter. It’s the rule.\n\nBut at least the officials were consistent and didn’t call targeting on Graham. That would have been a huge loss since he would have had to sit out the first half vs OSU.\n\nSo in the end, I’m OK with the non-targeting on Wilson…as long as he is able to play this Saturday.\n\nThis is my biggest annoyance with him!!! I can't stand when he refers to that program as that?!?!\n\nBut he just has a ton of energy and sometimes it comes across as over the top?!?! But I'm okay with him overall...\n\nI suspect Joel Klatt recognizes that could rub some Michigan fans the wrong way because he requested Gus clarify on-air why he says that. IIRC, Gus responded by mentioning Jessie Owens’ accomplishments on the global stage was the Olympic Games in Berlin.\n\nI don’t have anything against Gus in particular but I will say I don’t care for TV commentary and haven’t for a long time. I seize every opportunity I have to watch games through the Skycam with nothing but the sounds of the stadium serving as the audio. I’d watch every game that way if I could.\n\nOO’s memory on that is the same as mine. Gus of course followed with an obligatory Hitler reference. My grandfather literally fought in the Battle of Bulge, but I frankly don’t need to hear Hitler references with reference to Ohio St when calling a Michigan game not…wait for it…involving Ohio St.\n\nHonestly Gus strikes me as a cool dude. He’s just not my cup of tea as an announcer. But if we win Saturday, Gus can have his day for all I care!"
