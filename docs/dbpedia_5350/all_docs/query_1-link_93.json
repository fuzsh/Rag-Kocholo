        "text": "New York is a pro sports town, so for some it may difficult to understand Gus Johnson’s decision to leave CBS for FOX.\n\nThe only time college athletics has a great relevance in this city is during March Madness, and that’s when Johnson made his name as CBS’ loudest voice of the NCAA tournament. For most city dwellers, college football is simply a bridge to Sunday and the NFL.\n\nWe have two NFL teams and most places don’t even have one. And those are where college football is king. Now FOX has what it needed: a recognizable voice who appeals to younger viewers for their new college football coverage.\n\nFOX dips its toes in this year with coverage on FX, which Johnson will headline along with analyst Charles Davis. The pair will call either the Big Ten or Pac-12 championship game this year, which will be aired on FOX for the first time. Next year FOX will jump in with a full regular-season schedule. It’s not the first time FOX has tried to challenge ABC/ESPN in the college football arena.\n\nThe network, which like The Post is owned by News Corp., bought rights for the BCS games from 2007-2010. For such brief coverage, though, FOX simply plugged in their NFL announcers – with the exception of Davis as lead analyst — and tried to make it work. It did not, and ESPN/ABC, with their plethora of college football analysts and play-by-play men, took the rights back two seasons ago. This is FOX making amends, trying to show viewers that this time they are serious, and adding Johnson should lend credence to that.\n\nThe man does have critics, those who think he shouts too loud, makes the telecast about him and not the game, and shuts out the analyst sitting next to him. I am not one of those people. To me, a game Johnson calls instantly becomes more exciting. Even if his goal is to pump himself up, he gets the viewer involved in a way most fail to do.\n\nWhen The Post asked me to write a Top 10 broadcasters in sports list when John Madden retired, I included Johnson at No. 9. And Johnson, to whom I had never spoken, got my number from CBS, called me and thanked me.\n\nCBS is the second high-profile job Johnson has left in the past year, with his time with the Knicks on TV/radio ending over a contract dispute. This time the rumor is that some play-by-play men at CBS did not like the recognition Johnson was receiving for his work on the NCAA tournament. CBS chose not to match FOX’s offer.\n\nAnd though Johnson helps FOX, his departure may not hurt CBS. If the rumor is true, it will keep whoever was unhappy, happy. The hit to the NCAA tournament should not be significant because the event is larger than Johnson or any announcer, particularly with the new viewing format which allows for all the games to be shown at once on various networks.\n\nAt CBS, Johnson — for whatever reason — was never near the top of their NFL talent. He was often buried in their coverage.\n\nFOX sounds likely to use him there, too, filling in when college football season ends. But it doesn’t need Johnson for pros, it needs him for college, and CBS didn’t."
