        "text": "For whatever reason, Michigan fans can’t seem to comprehend that Fox Sports’ primary college play-by-play caller is a fan of the maize and blue.\n\nThe usual diatribe is that the announcers of any game are against whatever team you’re rooting for, but Johnson, a Detroit native, has been a longsuffering fan of the maize and blue. He has a dog named Bo, after the legendary Michigan football coach Bo Schembechler, wore ‘turnover buffs’ to the Big Ten Championship Game in December, and now he’s got some merch to celebrate his Wolverines’ national championship win.\n\nOn the official Fox College Hoops account, Johnson was on video accepting his new goodies from the national championship game and even gave some rivalry fodder for his co-host, former Ohio State basketball player Jim Jackson.\n\nOf course, Johnson has drawn the ire of many Michigan fans with his introduction of Ohio State as ‘the world famous Ohio State Buckeyes,’ but as he flatly says here, he is a Michigan fan."
