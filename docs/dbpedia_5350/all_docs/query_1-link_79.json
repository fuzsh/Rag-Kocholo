        "text": "A lifelong resident of Newton Falls, Dolores was the daughter of Martha Kidzinski Johnson and Gus Johnson.\n\nShe married John J. Prelac in 1949. John died in November of 1963 when they were both 33 years old, leaving two young children for Dolores to raise with the help of family and friends. She often referred to the Serenity Prayer to help her get through the challenging times.\n\nDolores enjoyed taking pictures and making scrapbooks for her children and grandchildren. She loved traveling, ballroom dancing, going to concerts, puzzles and spending time with family and friends. Her grandchildren loved coming to her house to get into the “cookie drawer” and play with the poker chips left over from their late grandfather’s poker-playing days.\n\nDolores was a member of St. Mary and St. Joseph Catholic Church in Newton Falls. She worked as a secretary and bookkeeper for Pullman Couch and later for the Luxaire Cushion Company in Newton Falls.\n\nDolores is survived by her daughter, Diane (Charles) Tobias of Parma Heights; and her son, John M. (Susan) Prelac of Canton; four grandchildren, Sarah (Joseph) Gaither, Andrew (Chelsea) Tobias, Tyler (Taylor) Prelac and Hayley (Jeffery) Willis; nine great-grandchildren; sister, Elaine (Melvyn) Shepard of Newton Falls; and fiance, Richard Ross of Conneaut.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff of the Anna Maria of Aurora and Gardens of the Western Reserve Hospice for their kind and compassionate care.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations may be sent to the National Kidney Foundation, 30 E. 33rd St., New York, NY 10016 in memory of Dolores.\n\nVisitation will be 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024, at the Borowski Memorial Home in Newton Falls.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be 11 a.m. Monday, Aug. 12, 2024, at St. Mary and St. Joseph Church in Newton Falls, with the Rev. David Merzweiler as celebrant.\n\nDolores will be laid to rest in Newton Township Cemetery.\n\nPlease visit www.borowskimemorialhome.com to send condolences to the family.\n\n(special notice)"
