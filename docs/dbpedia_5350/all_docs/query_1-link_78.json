Gus Johnson of Fox Sports will be on the call when Nebraska visits Oklahoma. The game will be live at 12pm on Fox. The Cornhuskers and Sooners used to play each season until Nebraska left the Big 12 Conference to join the Big Ten Conference in 2012. Interestingly enough Oklahoma just recently agreed to join the SEC Conference starting in 2025. Gus Johnson is one of the best College Football Announcers and lets the viewer feel as if he/she is right there at the game. He always comes impeccably prepared with knowledge of both teams playing and the history of the rivalry if applicable. Oklahoma should defeat Nebraska this Saturday 9/18 but it may be a closer game than most fans think it will be. Gus Johnson will be on the call with Joel Klatt along with sideline reporter Jenny Taft. The trio are coming off a fantastic performance last Saturday 9/11 as they saw Oregon upset Ohio State in Columbus. I am looking forward to this great game and hearing the always enthusiastic voice of Gus Johnson with the play-by-play."
