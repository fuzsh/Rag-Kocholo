        "text": "Perhaps not a household name to a good chunk of the country, Anderson is severely underappreciated. To folks in the Midwest, he's likely known for his work calling Milwaukee Brewers games, but has also been a strong postseason baseball presence Turner Sports. When it comes to college hoops, though, Anderson is an overlooked gem. A recent staple for NCAA Tournament coverage on CBS and Turner, Anderson is knowledgably reserved, has a conversational tone, but definitely rises to the occasion when the action warrants. He's also provided stellar college basketball play-by-play for the Big Ten Network and Fox Sports.\n\nOne of the busiest basketball analysts in the business — and certainly one of the best for three decades. Antonelli has provided color commentary, play-by-play and studio analysis for women's college hoops, and various men's games (including the NCAA Tournament), for the likes of ESPN, the Big Ten Network, CBS and Fox Sports. She's covered numerous conferences, notably the SEC, ACC and Big Ten. A three-year starter at North Carolina State, Antonelli's basketball acumen — regardless of gender — is second to none. Especially when it comes to breaking down player tendencies. Antonelli was inducted into the Women's College Basketball Hall of Fame in June 2022.\n\nWhether in the studio, pre-game or providing live commentary, Bilas should be considered the gold standard when it comes to college basketball analysts. A longtime presence on ESPN — and CBS during the NCAA Tournament — the Emmy-nominated former Duke standout knows the ins and outs of the game better than anybody currently on the job. And it's actually been that way for a while. Yes, he's not a \"character,\" or rely on schtick as other prominent in-game analysts, but there isn't anything about the game that Bilas can't break down or make the audience aware of to enhance their viewing experience. His dry humor and rapport with any play-by-play partner are underrated Bilas traits.\n\nA standout guard for the Providence Friars, Burke has been a staple of reporting, calling and analyzing both the college and NBA game. Burke began her broadcast career providing radio commentary for Providence women's basketball. In the early 2000s, she did play-by-play for men's college hoops on ESPN alongside the great Dıck Vitale (more on him later). In addition, Burke was the first woman to commentate on Big East men's basketball before taking her talents to NBA broadcasts on ESPN and ABC. Burke was the 2018 recipient of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award.\n\nThere's always one controversial figure on these types of lists. Consider the opinionated, unapologetic Dakich to be that guy. The former Indiana basketball standout, interim coach and head coach at Bowling Green, Dakich doesn't lack an entertaining quality that draws people to his voice. As a radio host, Dakich has often pushed the boundary of good taste, and paid a professional price at times. But, when it came to his days providing color commentary and analysis for ESPN's college basketball coverage, his blend of impeccable basketball knowledge and instinct, as well as love of the game, was quite refreshing. He could be over-the-top, and wasn't afraid to question on-court decisions by players and coaches. Dakich's commentary was, and is, not for everybody, but we found it hard to not tune in.\n\nEagle might not be flashy on the mic, and hardly ever draws attention to himself, which is the point of any good announcer. While serving as the dependable voice of the Brooklyn Nets since the mid-1990s, Eagle has also been a longtime fixture on the mic for CBS's coverage of the men's NCAA Tournament, often working with the underrated Jim Spanarkel. Starting with the 2024 Big Dance, Eagle will handle play-by-by duties on CBS's lead Final Four team , replacing the venerable Jim Nantz (more on him in a bit), who will step away from calling college games.\n\nOne of the more notable legends on this list. Enberg called just about any sport of relevance during his illustrious broadcast career of roughly 60 years. While Enberg was a recipient of the Rozelle Award for his NFL broadcast excellence and baseball's Ford C. Frick Award, he was equally as talented and eloquent calling college basketball games for NBC and CBS. In many ways, Enberg was college basketball play-by-play royalty. He called Indiana men's games in the late 1950s into the '60s', then was the voice of UCLA basketball (1966-'77) during its dynasty years before moving to NBC, where he was the main man for the Final Four from 1976-81. He was on the call for the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird title game of 1979, and even worked alongside fellow legend Curt Gowdy. \"Oh my!\"\n\nQuite the pioneer when it came to sports broadcasting. Flemming was the original voice of ABC's \"Wide World of Sports.\" However, he's probably best known to those of a certain age as the first play-by-play announcer for the men's NCAA Tournament Final Four on television, beginning in 1963 with Loyola Chicago's thrilling title-game victory over Cincinnati in overtime. Flemming was also on hand to call UCLA's first four championships under John Wooden before Curt Gowdy took over the Final Four play-by-play reigns in 1969.\n\nThere are countless former coaches and players who found second careers providing college basketball commentary and analysis, but not all stand out. Fraschilla is not part of the group though, and after his coaching days at Manhattan, St. John's and New Mexico ended in the early 2000s, he's been a popular analyst at ESPN. Perhaps best known for providing studio analysis and game color from Big 12 contests, as well as the Pac-12, Fraschilla falls back on his coaching experience to give insight to fans, while not getting too technical. He's also not afraid to poke fun at his own coaching days.\n\nOne of the more versatile play-by-play voices in the business. While Harlan, son of longtime Green Bay Packers executive Bob Harlan, has been calling NFL games for nearly 40 years, he's also excelled describing action on the hardcourt. One of his earliest announcing gigs during the 1980s was doing play-by-play for men's basketball at Kansas, his alma mater. Harlan also called University of Missouri basketball and has been a consistent play-by-play presence for the NCAA Tournament on CBS, TNT, TBS — and the likes. Harlan's excitement and passion when it comes to capturing the moment in a basketball game is among his greatest attributes.\n\nExuberant. Excitable. Over-the-top. Any of those describe Gus Johnson's play-by-play style. Johnson has covered myriad sports during his stellar career, but some of his best work has been calling college basketball games for CBS, the Big Ten Network, the Big East Network, Turner Sports and Fox. Some of Johnson's memorable most moments include UCLA's comeback win over Gonzaga in the 2006 Big Dance or the Xavier-Kansas State double-overtime thriller from the 2010 tournament. There are times when we actually fear for Johnson's health, or his voice at the least.\n\nAn All-Big Ten performer at Ohio State, Kellogg seemingly had no trouble transitioning to an above-average analyst and color commentator for the college game. Kellogg's broadcast career began in the early 1990s as analyst for ESPN and the Big East Network. He eventually worked his way over to CBS, where he's served as one of the network's most prominent and respected analysts — both in studio and courtside (including the Final Four). Kellogg's broadcast style is unassuming, thoroughly knowledgeable and quite good at taking viewers into the minds of the players. Plus, who can forget the time he played H.O.R.S.E. (P.O.T.U.S) against then-President Barack Obama?\n\nFor those fans of sports on radio, Kugler is a must-listen. Since 2008, he's been the No. 1 voice of the Final Four on Westwood One radio. However, Kugler can also be heard, and seen, delivering play-by-play for college hoops on the Big Ten Network and Fox Sports. Kugler, who also announces NFL action, has a steady and likable voice; clear and concise, and can ramp up his volume when the action calls for such a moment. Give a listen to how he called Kris Jenkins' winning 3-pointer for Villanova in the 2016 national championship contest.\n\nWhat hasn't the legendary Lundquist announced? He's excelled calling NFL games, SEC Saturday football and the action from Augusta National. And, of course, the courtside musings of college basketball, notably during the NCAA Tournament for decades on CBS. Always professional, Lundquist seems to sense when the excitement of the game is heating up. He was on the call for Christian Laettner's remarkable game-winner against Kentucky in the 1992 regional final and upstart No. 11-seed George Mason's stunning upset of top-seeded Connecticut in the 2006 Elite Eight. \"The Golden Throat\" has never disappointed.\n\nAnother versatile play-by-play star, McDonough is the No. 2 voice for college football on ESPN/ABC. But, when it comes to McDonough's college basketball calls, his work is quite underrated. He started calling college hoops for CBS in the early 1990s, and was among the network's best for a decade, notably working with the great Bill Raftery (we'll get to him). Starting in 2000, McDonough moved over ESPN, where his modest voice and spirited college basketball play-by-play has been on display. While McDonough is genuinely reserved in his calls, when the action heats up, his subtle excitement is impactful, usually allowing the atmosphere to tell the story.\n\nFollowing his Hall-of-Fame college basketball coaching career, McGuire was perhaps even more successful as an analyst, first with NBC and then on CBS. With his Queens' accent, the former national championship-winning coach with Marquette was a natural on the mic, and one of the first true characters when it came to announcing college hoops. His rapport with legendary partner Billy Packer (more about him soon) was much-watch television. McGuire, never shy about sporting his opinion or second-guessing in-game decisions, was part of the team with the aforementioned Dıck Enberg and Packer for the 1979 title game — still the highest-rated broadcast for an NCAA Tournament final.\n\nIt really doesn't matter the sport, as the veteran Mowins delivers with ease. Though she's probably best known for her play-by-play duties of women's basketball and college softball, Mowins was the first woman to do play-by-play for men's college basketball, as well as the NFL, NBA and Chicago Cubs baseball. Mowins, who played basketball at Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, is not flashy in her hoops play-by-play, but knows just the right time to generate excitement, while offering ample time for her analyst to contribute.\n\nBrent Musburger's voice is synonymous with the \"NFL Today\" and college football. However, during his time at CBS, Musburger also shined while doing play-by-play for the Final Four from 1985-1990 before he was dropped by the network in a still-considered controversial move. He called Villanova's stunning upset of Georgetown in the 1985 national final, Keith Smart's winning jumper for Indiana to beat Syracuse in '87 and \"Danny and the Miracles'\" shocking victory over Oklahoma for the 1988 championship. Following his departure from CBS, he continued to call college hoops for ESPN and ABC until 2017.\n\nArguably the premier sports play-by-play announcer currently in the business, though Nantz's successful run as the voice of the Final Four on CBS will come to an end after the 2023 NCAA Tournament. As noted earlier in this list, Nantz wants to spend more time with family, but plans to still call NFL games and golf for CBS. Nantz took over Final Four work and the No. 1 college basketball play-by-play voice announcer for the network in 1991, replacing Brent Musberger. A two-time Emmy Award winner, Nantz calls games with an almost prosaic approach. He's excellent at setting the mood, tapping into the moment's emotion, and treating every game like a story for which he serves as the qualified narrator.\n\nPacker is perhaps the most polarizing analyst in the history of college basketball — respected by his peers and colleagues, but traditionally hated by just about every major fan base in college basketball. OK, that might be an exaggeration. Or is it? Never shy about speaking his mind, the always-opinionated Packer once stated \"I say what I see.\" From 1974-2008, the Emmy Award-winning Packer provided mostly analysis and commentary for the biggest college basketball games in the nation, and was involved in coverage of the Final Four for all but the first three years of his network run. Packer's broadcast approach has described as everything from honest to condescending to controversial. He's also worked with the best: Curt Gowdy, Dıck Enberg, Verne Lundquist, Brent Musburger, Jim Nantz and Al McGuire. Truly one of a kind — for better or worse.\n\n\"Send it in Jerome.\" \"With a kiss.\" \"Man-to-Man.\" \"Onions!\" The best of Bill Raftery in just a few words. But this former college coach is so much more. A four-time Sports Emmy Award winner and 2006 recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award, Raftery has been providing stellar analysis and commentary on CBS since 1983, and since the 2014-15 campaign, has been part of the Final Four team that includes Jim Nantz and Grant Hill for CBS/Turner Sports. He's also called games for ESPN and Fox Sports 1. His conversational analysis, combined with an immaculate Xs-and-Os knowledge of the game, truly makes listening to Raftery an always entertaining experience.\n\nSimply put, Shulman is exceptional at any sport he does play-by-play. One of the all-time best voices for Major League Baseball, Shulman has taken over the lead announcing role for college basketball on ESPN, alongside partner Jay Bilas. However, Shulman has worked with just about all the marquee analysts over the past two decades. With a voice made for sports broadcasting, Shulman seems as if he's doing voiceover work for a game, never over-stepping the action or trying to draw attention to himself. Shulman is at his best when the crowd gets going, the excitement is elevated and the atmosphere calls for a perfect picture to be verbally painted.\n\nWe are about to conclude this list with a trio of true commentary \"characters\". We touched on Al McGuire, but \"Jimmy V\" was one as a national championship-winning coach at North Carolina State, and carried it over when he provided color commentary for college basketball on ESPN and ABC prior to his all-too early death from cancer in 1993 at age 47. While Valvano delivered his traditional brand of self-deprecating and timely humor, he was like a coach on the mic. Often predicting the action before it happened. He was recipient of a Cable ACE Award for his work.\n\nThere were times when Vitale and the aforementioned Jim Valvano teamed up on college basketball broadcasts for ESPN and ABC. Those were magical moments, but \"Dıckie V\" is a legend in his own time. Arguably the most recognizable and celebrated college basketball analyst and color commentator in the history of the game, he's an icon beyond the basketball. The catchphrases: \"Diaper Dandy\" \"PTPer.\" He's partnered with fellow broadcast stalwarts like Keith Jackson, Mike Tirico, Dan Shulman, Brent Musberger, Sean McDonough and Tim Brando. A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame who received a Lifetime Achievement Sports Emmy Award in 2019, Vitale is \"Awesome baby!\"\n\nWalton has always been an acquired taste for basketball fans for more than a half century — both as a player and broadcaster. Walton's official broadcast career started in the early 1990s after his playing days had finished. Some of Walton's best work as an analyst came during his NBA coverage. However, he seems most entertaining and controversial while commenting on the college game. An off-and-on fixture for ESPN's college hoops coverage over the years, Walton tends to drift during a game, goes off on tangents, tells stories that are not associated with anything at the moment and can be a bit confrontational. But that's what still makes him a popular analyst. He knows the game. Experiencing his calls is like watching a game in a friend's living room, and Walton is the guy you don't know who happens to stop by and is completely unforgettable. Just ask longtime broadcast partner Dave Pasch about the phenomenon that's Bill Walton."
