        "text": "Dick Vitale recently returned to the four letter network with much fanfare, though it wasn't until they had announced his comeback from throat surgery that I realized he had been gone.\n\nSuch is the state of television play-by-play for college basketball and the networks that cover them. Marquee games on ESPN/ABC include stirring names such as Ron Franklin and Brad Nessler.\n\nDick Enberg at CBS is doing the best he can do, but he is also 73 years old. I can do without \"Hello Friend\" Jim Nantz and Billy Packer.\n\nThough I may have omitted a few guys (Musberger notably) There are few, if any, legendary broadcasters on the tube announcing your NCAA Hoops.\n\nEnter Gus Johnson.\n\nNow in his 11th season calling the games for CBS, he has jumped ahead of the pack of has-beens and never-will-be's to become the most enjoyable and memorable announcer this sports junkie has seen in at least a decade.\n\nHis ability to be extraordinarily over the top is actually what keeps me watching his games. Watching Georgetown play Marquette Saturday afternoon, I found I couldn't change the channel. I could care less about the two teams playing and would ordinarily change the station, but Gus kept me in the game.\n\nThis is a trend with him, he gets really good games. My first recollection of Johnson was his call of the UCLA-Gonzaga tourney game in '06. I swear the guy screamed at the top of his voice at the very end of that game.\n\nHis style, though different, is refreshing.\n\nHe is a fan and draws you in with his passion and excitement. He is only 41 years old and has a lot of time left to become a true legend of the broadcast industry.\n\nLooking back, I wish Gus would have gotten hired by the Chicago Cubs after Chip Caray left in 2004. Remember Gus was the Detroit Tigers' play-by-play man in 1998-1999.\n\n\"Rise and Fire\" is a phrase Gus is well known for. He could do play-by-play for European women's figure skating and make it exciting. He is not everybody's cup of tea, and people have the right to their opinions."
