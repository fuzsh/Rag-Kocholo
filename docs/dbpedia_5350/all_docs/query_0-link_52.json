        "text": "College football broadcaster Gus Johnson has improved leaps and bounds and will be on the call for the Maryland at Michigan football game Saturdayafter leaving with an illness during the Oklahoma-Nebraska broadcast in Week 3. Joel Klatt pivoted from color commentator to play-by-play man for the entire second half of Oklahoma's 49-14 romp over the Huskers.\n\n\"Listen, I've never done play-by-play in my life — maybe, like, in my head,\" Klatt said on the Next Round Live. \"But yeah, that was interesting. But yeah, Gus is doing great. And it just happens, man. We're human. And he's going to be fine. He's going to be raring to go this week when we're up in Michigan. But yeah, that was — let's just say, I didn't wake up thinking to myself, like, 'Hey, I'm going to call the second half.'\"\n\nKlatt announced early in the third quarter that Johnson fell ill and would not call the remainder of the game. Brady Quinn— already on-site at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln for pre-game and halftime show duties — came to the booth to provide Klatt with a color commentator after Johnson exited. Urban Meyer, the former three-time national championship college football coach who returned to broadcasting this fall, also joined the broadcast later in the second half.\n\n\"We were, I guess, fortunate because of the style of game,\" Klatt said. \"And obviously, Brady and the guys were there and coach Meyer's there. So it kind of — in a weird way, in the fourth quarter, it was almost better to just have a big, overarching conversation about those programs and where they're at.\"\n\nAs Johnson gets back to work, Michigan looks to improve to 4-0 after blowing out Colorado State, Hawaii and UConn to start the season. It's the fourth consecutive home game for the Wolverines to start the year as they seek to defend the Big Ten title and return to the College Football Playoff this winter in year eight under head coach Jim Harbaugh. J.J. McCarthy emerged as Michigan's starting quarterback moving forward after Harbaugh gave both McCarthy and incumbent starter Cade McNamara starts over the first two games of the season.\n\nSubscribe to 247Sports YouTube for the latest college football, basketball and recruiting news including live college commitments.\n\n\"We're always competing with ourselves, and no matter who we're playing or when we're playing, we're always just gonna go out there and try to be the best version of ourselves every single week,\" McCarthy said when asked if Michigan is ready for Big Ten play. \"And yeah, every single game, it's like going out there and playing like you were in first grade again or fifth grade. Just playing football and just having a great time. And of course, we want to excel at it. So we just keep emphasizing getting better every single week and being the best versions of ourselves.\"\n\nDean Straka contributed to this report."
