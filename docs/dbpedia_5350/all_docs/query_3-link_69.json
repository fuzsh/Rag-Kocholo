        "text": "In his years as a broadcaster, Gus Johnson has become known for his boisterous and impassioned calls of some of the most thrilling and pivotal moments in recent memory in the college sports world.\n\nOn Sunday, sitting courtside at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, he was yet again a witness to history.\n\nCaitlin Clark sank a pair of technical free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining in the second quarter of No. 6 Iowa’s game against No. 2 Ohio State to pass former LSU star and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Pete Maravich as the all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I basketball history, men’s or women’s.\n\nThough the manner in which she set the record was a bit anti-climactic, at least compared to the deep 3-pointer she sank on Feb. 15 against Michigan to become the Division I women’s basketball career scoring leader, Johnson’s famed voice helped provide the soundtrack to the moment for those watching the game across the country.\n\n“She does it with a foul shot!” Johnson said after Clark swished the second of her two free throws. “Caitlin Clark becomes the all-time leading scorer in major college basketball history.”\n\nJohnson’s call can be heard here:"
