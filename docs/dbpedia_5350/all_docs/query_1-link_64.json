        "text": "Gus Johnson is stepping down as Fox's lead soccer announcer.\n\nBest known for his calls of college basketball and the NFL, Johnson knew little about soccer when he started calling games. He was frequently panned on social media for botching names and facts.\n\nFox now must find new lead announcers for next year's Women's World Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n\nJohnson and Fox Sports President Eric Shanks tell Sports Illustrated the announcer couldn't work enough soccer games to gain the experience he needed. He mainly calls college football and basketball for Fox.\n\nJohnson joined the network in 2011 from CBS. Fox executives had contended his style would draw more causal American fans.\n\nFox is taking over the U.S. English-language World Cup rights from ESPN, which found critical and ratings success after switching from American to British announcers for the 2010 tournament."
