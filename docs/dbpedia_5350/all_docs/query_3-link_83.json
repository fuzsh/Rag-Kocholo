        "text": "Gus Johnson left Saturday’s Oklahoma-Nebraska game after it was described that Johnson was “very much under the weather” by broadcast partner Joel Klatt, who took over the call, and was later joined by Brady Quinn on FOX Sports.\n\n“Gus is doing well and already looking forward to next week!! Can’t wait to have him back,” Klatt shared on social media.\n\nJohnson is known as being arguably the most exciting broadcaster in college sports. He has served as FOX Sports’ lead college football play-by-play voice since 2011, and of the network’s college basketball coverage since 2013, the first year FOX Sports carried national college basketball games.\n\nAlong with the Big Noon broadcasts of college football, Johnson pairs with legendary college basketball analyst Bill Raftery and former NBA veteran Jim Jackson for top games on FOX and FS1, including the Big East Tournament from New York’s Madison Square Garden."
