The FOX Sports and Coaches+ Media collaboration, BACK TO SCHOOL WITH GUS JOHNSON premieres Saturday, Feb. 18 at 7:00 PM ET on FOX, ahead of a highly anticipated Michigan State vs. Michigan college hoops matchup featuring Johnson on the call.\n\n\"FOX Sports is honored to shine a spotlight on Gus Johnson's story from becoming one of the most iconic voices in all of sports to his truly inspirational new journey through academia,\" said Charlie Dixon, Executive Vice President & Head of Content, FOX Sports. \"Gus is a one-of-a-kind talent, and we couldn't be more excited to give audiences a special look into his illustrious career and the impactful work he is doing at Harvard.\"\n\nFrom the broadcast booth to Harvard lecture room, BACK TO SCHOOL WITH GUS JOHNSON invites audiences along on Johnson's journey beginning with his childhood in Detroit, studies at Howard University, the rise of his broadcasting career, and his recent return to academia at Harvard to reveal the man behind the mic. The film peels back the layers on his life history, his motivations to give back to others, and his future aspirations.\n\n\"I was nervous about letting people into my life, but I thought if I could show kids through my journey that education is cool, it was worth it,\" said Johnson. \"I think this is a really good story and hope that it inspires. I also hope fans enjoy watching some fantastic folks at a great school, and get new insights into sports as well as the pursuit of lifelong learning.\"\n\nIn 2022, Johnson was recruited for Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative (ALI), an innovative academic program designed to unleash the potential of experienced leaders to help solve society's most pressing challenges. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allowed Johnson to rub elbows with a diverse group of global leaders and enabled the fan favorite sports personality to utilize his voice beyond the game to affect change in the lives of others and have a profound societal impact.\n\nFor one solid year, Gus held two full-time jobs: a student at Harvard during the week and FOX Sports' lead college football and basketball announcer on the weekends.\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL WITH GUS JOHNSON features special guest appearances from University of Michigan head football coach, Jim Harbaugh, and Harvard men's basketball head coach, Tommy Amaker, along with other sports luminaries from Johnson's past and present, all of whom have had an impact on his career. Viewers will also witness Johnson's interactions with his Harvard fellowship program cohort as they discuss some of the world's most critical problems. The film also takes viewers on the road to a football game at the University of Michigan for a first-hand look at Johnson in the booth and behind the scenes for FOX Sports.\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL WITH GUS JOHNSON is produced by Coaches+ Media, in association with Rise and Fire and TeamWorks Media. The film's executive producers are Gus Johnson, Craig Robinson and Jay Sharman, as well as FOX Sports' Eric Shanks, Mark Silverman, Charlie Dixon and Barry Nugent. Chris Weber serves as director and producer.\n\nFOX Sports Films is dedicated to presenting captivating global sports documentaries through an unconventional and entertaining lens.
