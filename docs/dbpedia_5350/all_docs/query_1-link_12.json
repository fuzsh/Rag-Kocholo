        "text": "Gus Johnson is widely regarded as the finest basketball player in Boise Junior College history. Johnson played one year for the Broncos (1961-62) and scored 790 points that season, averaging 28 points per game. He went on to play one season at the University of Idaho, before being picked in the second round of the NBA Draft by the Baltimore Bullets.\n\nJohnson played professionally for 10 seasons, including nine with the Bullets, who retired his No. 25 jersey. He was a five-time NBA All-Star, named to the All-NBA Second Team four times and was twice selected to the All-NBA Defense First Team. He was nicknamed 'Honeycomb' for his sweet style of play and lauded by teammates, opponents, coaches and front office members for being a groundbreaking presence in the game of basketball. Johnson was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nA member of the Boise State Athletics Hall of Fame, Johnson was inducted in 1987 - just months before he passed away at the age of 48, due to inoperable brain cancer."
