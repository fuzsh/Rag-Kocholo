        "text": "As you watch the NBA Finals there’s a name you should think about. He’s not on the court. He’s not one of the coaches. He didn’t build the teams. But if he ever got the chance, he’d make the league even more watchable than it already is. That’s because he’s better than almost anyone at his job.\n\nHis name is Gus Johnson.\n\nFirst, let’s back up one second.\n\nThese NBA playoffs have been staggeringly good. Overall, the league itself is at the beginning of a third epoch post Magic and Bird: there was Jordan, followed by LeBron and Steph, and now Luka and Joker.\n\nThis is the deepest and most talented the NBA has been in decades. I’d argue ever. The networks certainly love what they’re witnessing which is why you’re about to see the league sign some gargantuan broadcast deals. Everything is great for the league except one thing.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver: Hard foul on Caitlin Clark a 'welcome to the league' moment\n\nOne of the most vital components of the NBA is the national play-by-play announcer. In some ways, they are the pulse of the sport. They are the information conduits who shape how players are viewed.\n\nIn many of the cases these voices are white.\n\nOn the major networks like ESPN and TNT there are few play-by-play voices of color. Names like Mike Breen, Dave Pasch, Ian Eagle, and Kevin Harlan are talented but when you think about it, really think about it, it’s remarkable that such important voices are non-diverse talking about a league that’s majority Black.\n\nThis is where Gus Johnson comes in.\n\nIt’s not just that Johnson is needed to diversify the play-by-play universe, but he’d also instantly be one of the most entertaining voices covering the sport. The fact he isn’t a regular voice on some of these big networks is shameful. It’s also a waste.\n\nWho knows if Amazon will actually get the NBA but if it does Johnson should be at the top of its list for play-by-play voices.\n\nThere’s also a question these networks should constantly ask themselves. How can you fully and accurately tell the stories of a mostly Black league with almost exclusively white play-by-play voices?\n\nThere are play-by-play voices of color doing the NBA but not enough, and not on this kind of stage.\n\nJohnson has long been a cult figure in broadcasting. It’s easy to understand why. Few bring his level of energy or his unique voice. He’s cemented himself as one of the top voices for college football and he'll call basketball games on occasion. One moment in February was typical of Johnson in that his call went viral. He was working the Connecticut and Villanova game for Fox and what happened was viewed by 1.6 million people on X, formerly Twitter:\n\n\"There’s truly only one Gus Johnson,\" the site Awful Announcing wrote. \"And as this video shows – the energy, excitement, and love for college basketball certainly isn’t a performance act. It’s the real thing.\"\n\nJohnson has called NBA games before. He did Game 2 of the Bucks-Pacers series in April on NBA TV. Last year, he did games on TNT.\n\nNo, Johnson isn't for everyone. Though if you don't like him, you must also hate puppies and ice cream.\n\nThe landscape in broadcasting continues to evolve in a number of ways but one of the biggest is the financial impact. These leagues are making obscene amounts of money because their product is so good. We like to complain about how the leagues are run or the game officials or other things but in the end, the games we watch are good, and we will likely always watch in big numbers.\n\nThe networks know this and are willing to pay big money for one of the most stable products in our society.\n\nSometimes it seems the networks care about the racial diversity of its crews and sometimes it seems they don't. When it comes to the play-by-play broadcasters, they mostly don't.\n\nJohnson could help change all of that. Not just because it's ethically right but also because few do it better than Johnson."
