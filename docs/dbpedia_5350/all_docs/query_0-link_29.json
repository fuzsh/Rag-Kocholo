        "text": "Brent Musburger - ESPN, ABC, CBS\n\nSalary: $4 million per year\n\nIn 2017, the ESPN broadcaster who was enjoyed for decades by millions of Americans decided to call it quits and retire from broadcasting. We are talking of course about none other than Brent Musburger. Some of you might remember that the accomplished veteran broadcaster was also the lead voice for CBS Sports back in the '80s. In a recent interview just before his retirement, Musburger claimed he was excited to finally get a chance to use all the flight miles he racked up during his many years of broadcasting for some travel fun.\n\nMusburger was an absolute pioneer in his field and was truly the first network play-by-play announcer to change the norms of the time by expressing his opinions and predictions before and during matches. This was unheard of at the time and we can all thank (or accuse) Musburger of today's much more open and expressive style of broadcasting. Musburger called everything from the NBA Finals to NFL games. He is a big proponent of sports handicapping and part of his plan for retirement is to help his family start a sport handicapping business in Las Vegas.\n\nPeter Gammons - ESPN\n\nSalary: $250,000 per year\n\nPeter Gammons is one of the world's leading veterans in baseball writing, with almost 50 years of experience writing for The Boston Globe, Sports Illustrated, and ESPN and THe Athletic. The 74-year-old sportswriter received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing in 2004 and was also voted as National Sportswriter of the Year 3 times in the past few years.\n\nOriginally from Boston, Massachusetts, the city is proud of his work in sports and has proclaimed January 9, 2009 \"Peter Gammons day\" by the president of the Boston City Council. Gammons is also an avid fan of rock and blues and has released several albums whose proceeds went to charity. Gammons worked for ESPN from 1989 but ultimately quit the network 20 years later in order to free up his extremely demanding schedule to pursue other lifelong challenges. He currently works for the MLB Network as a TV analyst.\n\nHowie Long - Fox\n\nSalary: $16 million per year\n\nRetired professional NFL player, actor and sportscaster Howie Long spent his entire 13-season career with the Los Angeles Raiders. The almost 60-year-old former defense footballer was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000. After retiring from the NFL in 1993, Long took his bulky build and formidable personality and pursued a career in acting with a focus mainly towards action films. The actor played a few roles in films such as Broken Arrow with John Travolta and 3000 Miles to Graceland with Kurt Russel and Kevin Costner.\n\nThe actor even got his own lead role in the 1998 action thriller Firestorm. Long has also appeared in various TV shows and commercials for many companies from Coca-Cola to Hanes and even Chevrolet. He also wrote a book called \"Football For Dummies\" that was mostly aimed at fans of football who wanted a better understanding of the game. Long is currently a studio analyst for Fox Sports' NFL coverage.\n\nEleanor Oldroyd - BBC\n\nSalary: $200,000 per year\n\nBBC Radio Back in the mid-'80s, Eleanor Oldroyd began her career as journalist and broadcaster in local radio by covering cricket, paving the way for female sportscasters at a time when there were virtually no women in that field. She has been working for BBC Radio since 1986. Despite claiming to not be a very sporty person, she says that she fell in love with cricket and would watch it often with her dad.\n\nOldroyd is a very big activist for women's equality in sports and is proud of being one of the first female sports broadcasters. In a recent interview with \"The Set Pieces\", she claims to feel very lucky to be in her position and to live at a time when women are much more accepted and taken seriously in sports. She is also the author of the book \"Composers of Barnes - The Flow of Inspiration\" which is a biographical profile of eight of the leading composers from Barnes.\n\nMike Francesa - Mike’s On: Francesa on the FAN\n\nSalary: $3 million per year\n\nPopular talk show radio host Mike Francesa is the host of Mike and the Mad Dog radio show, one of the most famous and successful radio shows in America. Prior to starting his solo career, Mike was a sportscaster for CBS Sports and WFAN, covering various events, mostly related to the NFL.
