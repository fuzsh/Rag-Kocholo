        "text": "Ryan RudnanskySenior Writer I\n\nGus Johnson's Best Calls (With Video)\n\n0 of 15\n\nRenowned sportscaster \"Screaming\" Gus Johnson didn't get his nickname for nothing.\n\nHis enthusiasm for sports is already legendary in the world of broadcasting, most known for his coverage of CBS Sports' March Madness, the NFL, and as the former radio and backup TV play-by-play announcer for the New York Knicks.\n\nDon't have to turn the volume up too high for these videos folks, Screaming Gus Johnson will provide plenty of it for you.\n\n15. Al Harrington's Three-Pointer\n\n1 of 15\n\nWith the Knicks trailing by four points against Portland, Al Harrington hit a three-pointer in the corner.\n\nGus Johnson's call: \"My name is Al Harrington...and I get buckets!\"\n\nAs always, the way Gus said it (or yelled it) was just as important as what he said.\n\n14. Regular Season TD Sends Gus Into Hysteria\n\n2 of 15\n\nSure, this was a great run by Chris Johnson, but it wasn't a big-time game or anything.\n\nGus demonstrates in this one his ability to make even the most ordinary game exciting.\n\nBut he may have gone a little overboard, even by his standards, in this one. One of the great things about Gus is he is completely unscripted and his energy simply brings forth his words.\n\nBut the line, \"Watch out, he's got getting-away-from-cops speed,\" was probably not a smart remark when describing an African-American athlete. It was thought of by many as racist and got him in some trouble.\n\n13. UConn Vs. Gonzaga, 2008\n\n3 of 15\n\nGus really freaks out when UConn's A.J. Price hits a three-ball to send the game into overtime against Gonzaga.\n\nHis fellow announcer says something, but Gus keeps on freaking out, clearly immersed into the game.\n\n12. David Lee Tip-In\n\n4 of 15\n\nIn a game against Michael Jordan's Charlotte Bobcats, David Lee tipped in the game-winner for the Knicks in the final seconds.\n\nI have yet to ever hear an announcer be more excited by a tip-in.\n\n11. Brandon Stokley's Tipped Touchdown\n\n5 of 15\n\nWith the Denver Broncos down 7-6 at the end of the game and inside their own 10-yard line, Kyle Orton threw a ball that was tipped by a defender and landed neatly in Brandon Stokley's hands. He ran it all the way to the end zone in an unbelievable victory.\n\nGus was noticeably excited about the play: \"Stokley! Wow!\"\n\n10. NC State Vs. Vanderbilt, 2004\n\n6 of 15\n\nThis backdoor pass, put in and foul led to Vanderbilt going to the Sweet 16 in 2004.\n\nGus, as always, was beside himself.\n\nThe call is at 3:35.\n\n9. T.J. Sorrentine's Three-Pointer\n\n7 of 15\n\nT.J. Sorrentine's big three-pointer against Syracuse was a great shot.\n\nBut Gus, not to be outdone, exploded and responded with, \"Oh..my...goodness! Sorrantine hit that one from the parking lot!\"\n\nThis whole video is really entertaining.\n\n8. Xavier Vs. Kansas State, 2010\n\n8 of 15\n\nKansas State went ahead of Xavier on a big three-pointer with 30 seconds left in the game.\n\nGus' response: \"Bang! He's in shape!\"\n\nThe call is at 1:50.\n\n7. Ron Lewis, Ohio State Vs. Xavier, 2008\n\n9 of 15\n\nRon Lewis sent the game into overtime with this big-time long ball.\n\nI could make out Gus saying, \"Lewis has been awesome! Lets it go!\"\n\nThe next thing he said was indecipherable. It was all a blur from there on out.\n\n6. OSU Vs. Illinois\n\n10 of 15\n\nGus didn't say much in this one. He just yelled out in shock. But it's hilarious.\n\n5. Michigan State Vs. Kansas, 2009\n\n11 of 15\n\nAt 1:40, a bucket and foul sends Gus into a state of crazy.\n\nI have never heard anyone yell, \"And the foul!\" louder than I have heard Gus yell it.\n\n4. \"The Runner\"\n\n12 of 15\n\nGus' call of the running shot preceding a put-in has become a cult hit, nicknamed simply \"The Runner.\"\n\nThe fact that the runner didn't even make it in the hoop is irrelevant.\n\nThe call of \"Gonzaga, the slipper still fits,\" was a great call.\n\n3. Adam Morrison's Winner Vs. Oklahoma State\n\n13 of 15\n\n2. Allan Houston's Game-Winner Vs. Miami in the Playoffs\n\n14 of 15\n\n1. \"Screaming Gus Johnson\"\n\n15 of 15\n\nX"
