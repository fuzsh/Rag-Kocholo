        "text": "Gus Johnson was hungry after working out at the Athletic Performance Lab in Katy. He hopped into a car with his agent to go eat.\n\nHis agent took a call on the way to Pappasito's. The Cowboys wanted Johnson to join them in training camp. The charter for Oxnard was leaving in two days.\n\nThe running back from Stephen F. Austin had no idea what was happening as he sat in the passenger seat.\n\n\"I really wasn't paying attention,'' Johnson said. \"I'm a young kid, so anytime I can be on my phone, my head's down in my phone.\n\n\"I was just sitting there probably on Twitter. I don't know. Instagram. That's when he told me. I was just shocked.''\n\nEven more shocking is that Johnson is likely to find himself in the starting backfield later this evening when the Cowboys open the preseason against the San Diego Chargers.\n\n\"It's big, you know,'' Johnson said. \"All eyes are going to be on the preseason games to see who can play, who can't play.''\n\nJohnson gets this opportunity because injuries to Darren McFadden and Lance Dunbar have given him more carries in practice. With Joseph Randle nursing a slight oblique strain from three days ago, the door is open for Johnson to start.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 215-pound back is a physical runner who has done some nice things in practice. He's clearly ahead of former Baylor back Lache Seastrunk at this stage.\n\n\"I like to get the dirty yards, put my head down, not afraid of contact,'' Johnson said. \"I've always been a bigger kid so contact is something I kind of like.''\n\nTonight is his big chance. What does offensive coordinator Scott Linehan think of Johnson and Seastrunk?\n\n\"Johnson a big back,'' Linehan said. \"He seems like a guy in obvious running situations that might be something he can hang his hat on. But we'll see.\n\n\"It's a bigger change from a run style or system for Seastrunk, but he's learning.''\n\nImportant dates\n\nAug. 13: Dallas at San Diego, 9 p.m. (preseason)Aug. 23: Dallas at San Francisco, 7 p.m. (preseason)Aug. 28: Head back to DallasAug. 29: Dallas vs. Minnesota, 6 p.m. (preseason)Sept. 3: Dallas vs. Houston, 7 p.m. (preseason)Sept. 13: Dallas vs. New York Giants, 7:30 p.m. (Week 1)\n\nLatest from camp\n\nCowlishaw: Is Ray Rice worth trip down domestic violence path for Cowboys?\n\nMoore: Why preseason opener will do nothing to determine whether Cowboys need to add RB\n\nQB battles, key debuts among things to watch as Cowboys face Chargers\n\nA Tyler Clutts touchdown draws rare audible expletive from Cowboys coach Jason Garrett\n\nBefore preseason opener, Cowboys pay visit to Marines at Camp Pendleton\n\nBarry Church on what he tells young players, how to handle Dez's chirping and whether Ballers is the real thing\n\nMoore: Randle has talent to be lead back for Cowboys, but does he have these other requirements?\n\nRon Leary on what he does outside of football and whether Dez passes when he plays basketball\n\nJason Garrett eager to see Lucky Whitehead vs. Chargers: 'It will be fun to watch him play'\n\nBabe Laufenberg: The two Cowboys I'm most interested in seeing Thursday night\n\nBob Sturm: Here's why I like rookie running back Gus Johnson\n\nCowboys' Rod Marinelli: In Ben Gardner's first game since October 2013, he's 'got to go cash in'\n\nBob Sturm: Here's when to judge Greg Hardy's play; it's not now\n\nMoore: If Cowboys sign another RB, it'll happen at this time; here's a name to remember\n\nTop 40: The best quotes from Dallas Cowboys training camp\n\nBabe Laufenberg: QB should be Cowboys' top priority in every draft, even if they don't pick one\n\nCalifornia in pictures\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 12\n\nPhotos: SpongeBob backpack sighted as Cowboys hit train bound for San Diego\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 11\n\nPhotos: Cowboys practice as fire blazes near Oxnard workout facility\n\nSUNDAY, AUG. 9\n\nPhotos: Joseph Randle fumbles at goal line, Dez plays catch on sidelines in Cowboys' Blue-White scrimmage\n\nSATURDAY, AUG. 8\n\nPhotos: Actor Denzel Washington watches Cowboys practice, calls it a 'dream come true'\n\nPhotos: Denzel Washington, his son on hand at Cowboys practice; more scuffles; Tyler Clutts' kids wear the star\n\nTHURSDAY, AUG. 6\n\nPhotos: Cowboys Kenneth Boatright injures neck; Dez tweaks hamstring, put scare into Stephen Jones\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 5\n\nPhotos: Mo Claiborne can't stop smiling; Dez skies over Brandon Carr; off day for Romo in afternoon practice\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 4\n\nPhotos: Dez messes with ESPN cameraman, fields punts; Romo fist-bumps a fan; Jon Gruden tosses T-shirts\n\nPhotos: Cowboys' walk-through Tuesday includes visit from Jon Gruden, honor for Darren Woodson\n\nSUNDAY, AUG. 2\n\nPhotos: Dez Bryant, Tyler Patmon get into fight, then hug it out at Cowboys training camp\n\nPhotos: Fan shows off Texas Stadium tattoo, Dez Bryant talks with media after Tyler Patmon fight\n\nSATURDAY, AUG. 1\n\nPhotos: Witten catches tennis balls; Dez draws media crowd; Charlotte Anderson Jones gets a bear hug from Haley\n\nPhotos: Anthony Hitchens faces the media; Lance Dunbar makes funny face when returning kick\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 31\n\nPhotos: Charles Haley hugs Garrett, fans clamor for Dez, crazy medicine ball drills during Friday practice\n\nPhotos: Cowboys' lines face off, Dez Bryant makes tough catches in Friday's walk-through\n\nTHURSDAY, JULY 30\n\nPhotos: Smiling Dez Bryant is everywhere in Cowboys' first camp walk-through\n\nPhotos: Fans strike a pose, high-five with cheerleaders and turn out to see Dez at Cowboys first afternoon practice\n\nPhotos: Smiling Dez addresses media; Romo cools off; Tyler Clutts hits sled in afternoon workout\n\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 29\n\nPhotos: Opening comments made in the shades as Jerry Jones, Jason Garrett discuss Cowboys\n\nPhotos: What goes into preparing for a day of Cowboys training camp in Oxnard?\n\nPhotos: Selfie with Jason Witten; Greg Hardy and Ronald Reagan as Cowboys arrive at training camp\n\nThe best ofâ€¦\n\nBabe Laufenberg (Part 1): Cowboys are still the NFC East favorite, an unknown to watch at training camp\n\nBabe Laufenberg (Part 2): Trying to figure out the trash talking Eagles, possibility of cutting Rolando McClain\n\nBob Sturm (Part 1): The importance of Dez Bryant; why the Cowboys are the Lakers, Yankees of the NFL\n\nBob Sturm (Part 2): Why Jerry Jones deserves credit for sticking with Jason Garrett, his beef with Dez Bryant's no-catch\n\nRick Gosselin (Part 1): Why Eagles are 'vastly overrated,' Jerry Jones' best, worst draft picks\n\nRick Gosselin (Part 2): Suppressing any Darren McFadden judgement, biggest impact rookie\n\nTim Cowlishaw: Cowboys still NFC East's top team, which current Cowboys could make the Hall of Fame\n\nDavid Moore: Would DeMarcus Ware have helped in the NFC championship?
