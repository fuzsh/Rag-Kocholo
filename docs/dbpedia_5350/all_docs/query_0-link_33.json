        "text": "College football fans got so annoyed with announcer Gus Johnson on Saturday.\n\nJohnson was on the call for Ohio State’s 20-12 win over Penn State at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. The FOX announcer decided he would officially nickname Buckeyes stud receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. And he decided he was going to hit everyone over the head with the nickname.\n\nYes, Johnson called Harrison “Maserati Marv” in honor of the Italian luxury car brand.\n\nAnd Johnson wouldn’t stop referring to Harrison by that name.\n\nHarrison had 11 catches for 162 yards and a touchdown, which meant fans kept hearing that name over and over and over again. Many got sick of it.\n\nThere was even a joke that there would be a betting proposition over how often Johnson was saying the nickname.\n\nThough fans were annoyed by the repeated calls of the nickname by Johnson, we doubt the announcer will cease calling him by that name.\n\nThis was one of Harrison’s biggest statistical games so far this season. He’s now up to 42 catches for 766 yards and 6 touchdowns."
