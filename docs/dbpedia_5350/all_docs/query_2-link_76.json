        "text": "Those hoping that Gus Johnson's fruitless negotiation to remain with CBS Sports would also eliminate him from boxing and mixed martial arts broadcasts on the network will be disappointed to learn that Johnson will still be calling boxing and MMA for Showtime, and will be in the booth on Saturday night for the Ward vs Abraham show.\n\nFrom MMAFighting.com:\n\nSources told MMAFighting.com that Johnson's contract with CBS was for basketball and football, and that his deal to call fights (both MMA and boxing) for Showtime was a separate contract. That contract is still in effect, and Johnson will call Saturday night's Andre Ward-Arthur Abraham boxing match for Showtime. Although Showtime hasn't yet announced who will broadcast its next MMA show (a June 18 Strikeforce card), Johnson is expected to call that event as well.\n\nTwo things about this are bad news for me:\n\nI think Gus Johnson is a bad boxing commentator.\n\nI rejoiced ever so slightly on tomorrow's podcast that he was gone, which was recorded earlier today. Oh well."
