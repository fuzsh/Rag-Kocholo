        "text": "The biggest free agent in sports broadcasting has landed at FOX.\n\nFormer CBS broadcaster Gus Johnson has joined Fox Sports as a play-by-play voice for college football, college basketball, and the NFL.\n\nJohnson will be the lead voice of college football on FOX and FX, working alongside Charles Davis. During the upcoming 2011-12 season, the Johnson/Davis team will call regular season games on FX and Big Ten Network, one conference championship game and the Cotton Bowl.\n\nThe duo will call games on the FOX when the network begins its package of regular season Pac-12 games in the 2012-13 season.\n\nJohnson will also serve as the lead voice of college basketball on Big Ten Network, a position he already held. Starting in 2013, he will call the Pac-12 Menâ€™s Basketball Tournament on FOX and FX.\n\nFinally, Johnson will call NFL telecasts on FOX once the college football season ends. Johnson called NFL games for CBS since the network resumed airing games in the 1998-99 season."
