        "text": "Basketball fans who tuned in for Monday night's game between the 76ers and Raptors heard a familiar voice on the TNT broadcast.\n\nGus Johnson served as the play-by-play voice for that contest and will continue to be part of Turner Sports' NBA Playoff coverage. Johnson is Fox Sports' lead announcer for college basketball and football, but he does have previous NBA experience, including calling select games for the Bucks from 2015-18.\n\nThe 54-year-old has joined a TNT roster featuring some of the best NBA play-by-play announcers in the industry.\n\nNBA AWARDS 2022: List of winners for MVP, Rookie of the Year and more\n\nGus Johnson added to TNT's NBA Playoff coverage\n\nJohnson kicked off his NBA Playoff run with Monday's broadcast of Game 2 between Philadelphia and Toronto. Greg Anthony offered analysis during the Sixers' win, and Nabil Karim served as the sideline reporter.\n\nWith such a high volume of first-round games being played on a nightly basis, Turner Sports likely saw adding someone of Johnson's caliber as a huge boost to its programming, especially considering Johnson's popularity on social media.\n\nBrian Anderson, Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle and Spero Dedes will also call NBA Playoff games on TNT.\n\nGus Johnson learns about over/under lines during NBA Playoff game\n\nThe 76ers dominated the Raptors in Game 2, so Johnson didn't have many opportunities to deliver commentary with his usual over-the-top enthusiasm. However, there was one memorable moment in the fourth quarter when Johnson admitted that he wasn't a huge gambler.\n\n\"I have to be honest with you. I don't know what over/under stuff means,\" Johnson said, referring to the FanDuel Sportsbook numbers at the bottom of the screen.\n\nFortunately for Johnson, Anthony was there to explain how the over/under lines work.\n\n\"That UNLV education, I tell you what,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Ivy League of the desert,\" Anthony replied.\n\nGus Johnson's next NBA Playoff game on TNT\n\nJohnson will be on the call for Wednesday night's Game 2 between the Bucks and Bulls. He will once again be joined by Anthony, and Dennis Scott will be patrolling the sidelines.\n\nApril 20 schedule"
