        "text": "Reading Time: 7 minutes\n\nExploring several Islamic coins through the evolution of ages and the secret messages held within them.\n\nCoins come in all sizes, shapes, and designs. Some coins portray royalty, and others depict cultural groups or iconic monuments. Regardless of what is engraved in a coin, there is almost always a particular message being conveyed. What is the evolution of coinage in the early Islamic period and what are the hidden messages within them?\n\nOne of the main contributors that made the early Islamic conquests successful was the assimilation of Muslims into the local population. When Arab Muslims conquered Persia, the Levant, and North Africa, they integrated with the local population instead of forcefully imposing their culture onto them. This can be clearly seen through the study of coins from the early Islamic period.\n\nThe coin above was minted before Islam in 615 CE by the Sassanian (Persian) king, Khosrow II. On the front side is a depiction of Khosrow II with a winged crown surmounted by a star and crescent. The Islamic star and crescent symbol you find in most Muslim countries today were assimilated from the Sassanians. The reverse side is a fire altar with a similar star and crescent symbol in all four directions.\n\nThe coin above was minted in Kufa, a city in Iraq, 74 AH/694 CE under the Umayyad caliph, ‘Abd al-Malik (d. 86/705).[1] The Islamic caliphate defeated the Sassanian empire in Iraq some 58 years before this coin was minted. Notice the similarities between this coin and the coins minted before Islam. Many of the details remain the same, except the shahada (testimony of faith) written below and the fire altar’s transformation to three men standing in prayer.\n\nBy the end of ‘Abd al-Malik’s reign, the Islamic caliphate began to form its identity. Amongst other things, ‘Abd al-Malik’s is known for constructing the Dome of the Rock mosque in Palestine, the reformation of coins, and the Arabisation of the caliphate’s bureaucracy. The coin above was minted in the final years of ‘Abd al-Malik and became the standardized format of all following Islamic coins. The observe middle of the coin reads “There is no God except Allah, He is one without partner”. On the margin of the coin reads “Muhammad is the messenger of God who sent him with guidance and the religion of truth that he might make it supreme over all other religions” from Surat Tawba verse 33 in the Quran. On the reverse side of the coin at the center, it says “God is One, God is Eternal, He does not beget nor is He begotten” from surat al-Ikhlas verse 1-3. Notice the religious tone adopted in these new coins compared to others. At this time, the Muslims were still a minority in the caliphate, but they made up most of the ruling class. Because of that, the message on Allah’s Oneness was a reaffirmation of Islam’s supremacy over all others to the mostly non-Muslim population.\n\nMost coins throughout the Islamic caliphates followed a similar design to that of ‘Abd al-Malik’s dinar, but there are some exceptions. One of the most fascinating coins was minted by Abū Muslim in 130/748. Abū Muslim is well remembered as the person who led the Abbasid revolution that replaced the Umayyad caliphate in the year 132/750. Before the revolution, Abū Muslim minted numerous copper and silver coins throughout Khurasān (Eastern Iran and Afghanistan) which contained a secret message.\n\nThe coin above shares a similar format to the standard coin design following ‘Abd al-Maliks reformation. However, one discreet difference can be found on the obverse side of the coin around the margin. Rather than having the Quranic verse about Islam reigning supreme over all faiths, Abu Muslim uses a different verse. The verse in the coin reads “I do not ask you for any payment except the love among relatives” it is from surat al-Shuraa verse 23 in the Quran. The verse used discretely calls for people to support the Abbasid dynasty, who unlike the Umayyads, are direct relatives of the Prophet Muhammed. We thus find that Abū Muslim had already planned to gather support for the revolution, years before it actually took place.\n\nAnother interesting coin was minted by the authority of Zubayda bint Abī Ja’far, the wife of the caliph Harūn al-Rashīd (d. 193/809). The coin was minted in Baghdad in the year 184/800. While the design is similar to most standard coins, what makes it particularly interesting is found on the coin’s reverse center side. The text reads “by order of the Lady, mother of the heir, may God preserve her!”. In 175/792, the caliph Harūn al-Rashīd chose his second son, Muhammad al-Amīn, son of Zubayda, as his heir. However, in 183/799, Harūn changed his mind and chose his eldest son ‘Abd Allah al-Ma’mun, born to a slave woman, as his heir instead. Given that the coin was struck a year after the change, it’s clear that Zubayda was claiming her son’s right over the throne by asserting herself as the heir’s mother. This coin provides a subtle message on a son’s right to the throne over his half-brothers.\n\nThe above coin remains one of my favorite designs. It was minted 254/868 by the caliph al-Mu‘tazz bi-llah (d. 253/869). Given that it has no place of mint and weighs almost twice as much as a regular coin, it’s possible to have been a token rather than a coin. Nonetheless, the obverse side of the coin depicts a bird, possibly a quail. In contrast, the reverse side of the coin depicts a rabbit with foliage in its mouth. Both of these animals are known for their fertility and their ability to produce many offspring. It is believed that this token was given to certain wives of the caliphs whom he wished to bear an heir. Although we may never honestly know the real purpose of the coin, I consider it one of the most beautiful and elaborate coins in Islamic history.\n\nAlthough we may never know whether the messages in these coins ever played a crucial role in history, they portray the thought and detail that went into coin minting. By engraving a particular coin, one would ensure that their message traveled far and wide across time and space. Whether that message calls upon one’s faith, incites a revolution, or simply asserts one’s authority, coins carry an immense material and symbolic value. The next time you see a coin, be it modern or past, try to study its details and analyze what the coin producers are trying to portray about themselves or others.\n\nBelow is a list of websites that showcase coins from different regions and times.
