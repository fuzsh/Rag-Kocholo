        "text": "This silver coin, or dirham, dates from the end of the first century of the Islamic era. It bears script in an early form of kufic that emphasizes legibility and clarity. Coins minted before A.D. 697 depict figures of rulers and other symbols, in keeping with earlier minting traditions of the Byzantines and Sasanians. In contrast, those minted after the caliph ‘Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) instituted coinage reforms in the late seventh century are solely epigraphic, in Arabic. They include Qur’anic verses and religious phrases, in addition to information about the coin itself, such as its name, mint, and date. This dirham was struck in Wasit in Iraq, in the hijri year 93, which corresponds to 711-12 A.D."
