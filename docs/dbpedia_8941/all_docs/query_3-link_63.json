Les débuts de la production des dirhams à Samarkand au début des années 890 et la forte augmentation durant les deux décennies qui suivirent correspondent à la phase de croissance du commerce entre l’Europe du Nord et le Caucase qui débuta vers 900. La baisse catastrophique de la production monétaire à partir de la seconde moitié du xe siècle peut être attribuée au déclin général de l’économie samanide qui s’amorça dans les années 940.",

        "text": "1. A survey of numismatic data used in the study\n\n2. Mint output of Samanid Samarqand\n\n12Overall, our data shows that the mint in Samarqand was active during much of the Samanid era. Between 892-893, when the Samanid first began to systematically mint dirhams in their own names, and 1005, when the last Samanid amir was deposed, there were only thirteen years for which no dirhams from Samarqand are recorded in our sample – all occurring at the very end of the Samanid period. This data is presented below in Graph 1. While Samarqand was active as a mint during much of the late ninth and tenth centuries, there are some notable peaks and falls in its output. Thus, dirhams came to be struck at ever-increasing rates beginning with 892-8/93 and reached a production zenith in 909-910/914-915. The very next year, in 915-916, mint output in Samarqand suddenly dropped in production and continued to decline steadily for the rest of the tenth century. Until the mid-950s, while producing fewer dirhams, the decline was by no means catastrophic: 34% of all dirhams struck in Samarqand by the Samanids were issued between the mid-920s and mid-950s. Overall, 92.26% of all dirhams struck at the mint were issued before the mid-950s. From 956-957, there was another major drop in production which, in relative terms to the output prior to then, can be considered near catastrophic. This decline continued into the 970s (the exceptions were the years 977-978 and 979-980 which will be discussed below) and by the 980s the mint experienced another drop which signified the total collapse in the production of dirhams in Samarqand. In the 990s, few, if any, dirhams were struck at the mint and after 997-998 no Samarqand dirhams struck by the Samanids are recorded in our database.\n\n17In 956-957, or two years after Nuh i died and ’Abd al-Malik i (954-961) assumed power, Samarqand’s mint output plummeted to levels not seen since the early years of the Samanids. This fall in production continued for the remaining years of his reign. During his rule, only 2.24% of all Samarqand dirhams struck under the Samanids were issued. The mint output under the next amir – Mansur i (961-976) – saw new lows such that had not been witnessed since the first year of Samanid mint output in 892-893. Under Mansur i, Samarqand produced only 3.15% of all dirhams struck at the mint by the Samanids.\n\n19To better understand the intensity of Samarqand’s mint production under Samanid rulers, it is important to put the chronology of output in perspective of each individual armir’s length of office.\n\n20On examining Table 3 and Graph 3, it becomes evident that while Nakr ii issued almost half of all dirhams struck in Samarqand by the Samanids, during his long rule of 29 years, the intensity of his mint production ranks only second (223 per year on average) – following that of Ahmad ibn Isma’il ii. During his reign of only seven years, Ahmad ibn Isma’il ii produced almost 16% of all dirhams at 318 per year on average. Clearly, under the Samanids, the mint was most active from 907 to 914. However, it did continue to strike dirhams with relative intensity from 914 to 943. By the time Nakr ii left office in 943, 79.3% of all Samanid dirhams minted in Samarqand had been issued. His son, Nuh i, ranks third in his mint production intensity – by the end of his eleven-year reign in 954, another 12. 93% of all dirhams had been struck by the mint at 164 per year on average. Finally, ranking fourth, during his fifteen-year rule from 892 to 907, Isma’il ibn Ahmad i minted 17.04% of all Samanid dirhams struck in Samarqand at 158 per year on average. Thus, by 954, 92.26% of all dirhams minted in the city by the Samanids had been issued. Under the remaining three amirs who ruled from 954 to 997, the mint not only declined in output volume (only 7.74% of all Samarqand dirhams were struck during this period), but also in the intensity of dirham production (ranging from 12 to 52 dirhams per year on average). The decline in the volume and intensity in mint output was progressive during the second half of the tenth century.\n\n3. Samarqand vs. Balkh and Bukhara\n\n21The continuous production of dirhams in Samarqand during most of the tenth century stands in stark contrast to the mints of Balkh and Bukhara which struck dirhams very erratically during the same period. Graph 4 makes it is clear that Balkh produced the overwhelming majority of its dirhams between 902-03/912-13 and 924-925/937-938 while Bukharaexperiences its heyday as a mint in 945-946/966-967. Very few, if any, dirhams were minted between these peaks at the two mints. In this way, chronologically, dirham productions at Balkh and Bukhara were diametrically opposed to each other.\n\n22In retrospect, when compared to Samarqand, Balkh’s mint production seems to follow a somewhat similar pattern: both mints were particularly active during the first half of the tenth century. At the same time, while Balkh’s mint notably declined and became very irregular after 937-938, Samarqand continued to issue dirhams at regular and even slightly increasing rates until 956-957. When compared to Samarqand, Bukhara’s dirham output stands in nearly the same converse order as Balkh’s. When Samarqand was experiencing its heyday as a mint in the first half of the tenth century, Bukhara produced hardly any coins. It was only in the mid-940s when Bukhara became an active mint and continued to issue dirhams in relatively large volumes until the late 960s. As noted above, Balkh’s mint production plummeted by 937-938 and by the mid-950s Samarqand’s mint output had dramatically declined. In light of these falls in production at the two mints, it can be tentatively suggested that the dramatic upsurge and continued (albeit diminishing) mint output in Bukhara beginning with the mid-940 through the late 960s was an attempt by the Samanid amirs to supplement the declining production of dirhams in Balkh and Samarqand. After the examination of dirham output of al-Shash and the twenty or so secondary Samanid mints, this suggestion can be better tested for accuracy.\n\n25In conclusion, this study examined 14,865 (13,952 of which were datable) Samanid dirhams struck in Samarqand from 634 hoards found throughout western Eurasia dating from the tenth to the eleventh centuries. The overwhelming majority of these hoards (94%) and dirhams (97%) come from northern Europe. Thus, it is clear that dirhams struck in Samarqand were destined for trade with this region and that the Samanid dirham was primarily an export coin.\n\n26The above data was analyzed using the hoard-count approach to determine the relative dirham output of Samarqand under the Samanids. An analysis of this data had shown that Samarqand was a primary Samanid mint that issued dirhams during most of late ninth and tenth centuries. Albeit, there were some notable peaks and falls in production levels that occurred during this period.\n\n27In view of the above, an overall pattern of mint production for the late ninth and first half of the tenth century becomes quite clear. During this period, the first amir initiated a steady and increasing volume of dirham production which was not only matched by the subsequent amir but also escalated in volume and production intensity during his reign. Under the third amir, Samarqand continued to issue dirhams in great numbers, but beginning with 924-925 the rate of issue per year declined and continued to fall for the remaining years of his rule. Further decline took place under the fourth amir. Despite the decreasing mint output of Samarqand after the second quarter of the tenth century, the mint produced dirhams regularly and in relatively large numbers until the mid-950s. The real collapse of Samarqand as a mint occurred in the second half of the tenth century, particularly in its last two decades when dirham output declined precipitously in volume output and production intensity. The three amirs who ruled from 954 to 997 minted only 7.74% of all Samarqand dirhams struck by Samanid rulers.\n\n28The beginnings of dirham output in Samarqand in the early 890s and the sharp increase in production intensity in the following two decades closely corresponds with the rise of commerce between northern Europe and Central Asia. As noted above, the earliest mention of trade between these two regions comes from the last decade of the ninth century and the export of Samanid dirhams to northern Europe began in ca. 900. Since Rus’ merchants only accepted silver coins in exchange for their goods, the Samanids had to produce dirhams in large enough quantities to make commerce attractive to the northern merchants. By ca. 900, the mint of Samarqand had produced enough dirhams to begin trade with the Rus’ in earnest. As exchange continued to develop and intensify in the next decade, the mint issued dirhams at ever increasing quantities which peaked by the mid-910s. It would be too premature at this time to speculate on how, if at all, the decline in the production of dirhams in Samarqand between the mid-920s and the mid-950s can be linked to the Samanid trade relations with the north. At the same time, what is clear is that the catastrophic drop in mint output that occurred in the second half of the tenth century can be attributed to the general decline in the Samanid economy that began with the fifth decade of the same century. Overall, the degree to which Samanid mints attempted to accommodate enough dirhams for the amirate’s commerce with northern Europe during the tenth century is a topic that can be fully addressed only when the mint output of al-Shash – the other primary Samanid mint – has been studied. Such an inquiry will be carried out in the near future."
