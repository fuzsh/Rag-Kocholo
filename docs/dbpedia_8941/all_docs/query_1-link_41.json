        "text": "It is well known that the Sasanian empire operated on the basis of the silver standard, with copper playing the role of small change.Footnote 2 The mainstay of the Byzantine monetary system was gold, supplemented by copper as small changeFootnote 3 – with the minting of gold being, most of the time, a near-monopoly of the imperial capital, Constantinople.Footnote 4 When the Muslims took over Byzantine Syria and Egypt and the territories of the Sasanian empire, they initially followed the monetary practices of their predecessors: in the east, they simply perpetuated the silver, and the occasional copper, issues of the Sasanian kings of kings Khusraw II (r. 590–628 ce) and Yazdgird III (r. 632–651 ce); in Syria and Egypt, at some point after the conquest of the region, they started minting copper in imitation of Byzantine types,Footnote 5 and gold was imported, in substantial quantities, from Byzantium.Footnote 6 Thus, during the first few decades after the Muslim conquest of the eastern Mediterranean basin, the first Muslim empire was technically divided into two currency zones, each based on a different standard – one gold, and the other silver. Sometime in the first century of Islam, a local gold denomination was also introduced, but when exactly this occurred has long been subject to debate.\n\nIn a classic published in 1967, the pioneer of Islamic numismatics, George Miles, gave a comprehensive description of all the known series of the reform and early post-reform gold coinage of the early Islamic empire.Footnote 7 Despite the discovery of several further specimens, this description remains valid, as does the relative chronology Miles established for these emissions based on their iconography and legends. Miles's proposed absolute chronology for these issues, which attributed all of them to the reign of the caliph ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Marwān (r. 65–86 ah/685–705 ce) proved less durable, however. Following John Walker, he argued that the testimony of the Syriac and Arabic literary sources to issuance of a gold coinage under Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān (r. 41–60 ah/661–680 ce) does not hold water in the face of the numismatic evidence, and that the dateless issues would have been issued shortly before those dated 74–77 ah/693–697 ce, on the grounds of continuity and the evidence of Carthaginian comparanda from the Roman exarchate of Africa naturally dating from after the conquest of that region during the reign of ʿAbd al-Malik.Footnote 8\n\nIn the following decades, Miles's intellectual heir and successor at the American Numismatic Society, Michael Bates, made a more forceful case for this “short chronology”, ascribing almost all major monetary initiatives in Syria – be they reform of the coinage or introduction of new denominations, and whether copper, silver, or gold – to ʿAbd al-Malik.Footnote 9 Bates's studies were the high water mark of this short chronology, and thereafter numismatists began to formulate alternative, “longer” chronologies which allowed for some measure of experimentation under the Sufyanids, in particular Muʿāwiya, and during the earlier part of ʿAbd al-Malik's reign (the years 65–72 ah/685–691 ce, before the end of the Second Civil War, 60–73 ah/680–692 ce).Footnote 10\n\nThe first attempt to establish a longer chronology for the gold coinage actually predated Bates's publications. In an article published in 1972, Cécile Morrisson argued that a particular imitation of the solidi of Heraclius with three imperial figures but no crosses on the obverse and the cross-on-steps on the reverse transformed into a T-shaped object-on-steps is to be attributed to Muʿāwiya. She based this argument on the evidence of a fragmentary Syriac text, known as the Maronite Chronicle and composed in the seventh or eighth century, which states that Muʿāwiya issued gold and silver without crosses on them, but that his initiative fell on stony ground, apparently because the predominantly Christian population of Syria would not accept coinage that lacked the image of the cross.Footnote 11 In a later work, she elaborated further on her proposal:Footnote 12 these issues can be divided into two series, the first, which includes the above-mentioned imitative issue and which Morrisson aptly dubbed “dechristianized”,Footnote 13 bear imperial iconography on the obverse but have had the crosses on the obverse effaced, and the reverse bears a T-shaped object instead of the usual cross-on-steps.Footnote 14 The second series, called the shahāda solidus, similarly bears three imperial figures on the obverse, with the crosses removed, and on the reverse the Latin legends and the cross-bar of the cross-on-steps have been erased and instead the margins are ringed by the Islamic profession of faith, the shahāda.Footnote 15\n\nThe debate over the absolute chronology of the gold coinage of Syria took a new turn with the publication in 2002 of an article by Clive Foss, who, building on Morrisson's work, made a strong case for the ascription of the dechristianized solidi – but not the shahāda solidi – to Muʿāwiya. Foss's argument is based on several observations. Above all, he states, Muʿāwiya's regime was much more sophisticated than hitherto imagined, a fact borne out by his initiatives in the east and by the evidence of the Nessana papyri from Palestine. The existence of a rather complex building programme not only requires a much more monetized economy, but also encourages increased monetization and reform. His second piece of evidence is the aforementioned Maronite Chronicle. Third, hoard evidence suggests that these issues were already in circulation not long after 681 ce at the latest, that is, shortly after the death of Muʿāwiya in 680 ce.Footnote 16"
