        "text": "The gold Dinar is an Islamic medieval gold coin first issued in AH 77 (696–697 AD) by Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The weight of the dinar is 1 mithqal (4.25 grams or 0.137 troy ounces). The word Dinar comes from the Latin word Denarius, which was a Roman silver coin. The name Dinar is also used for Sasanid, Kushan, and Kidarite gold coins, because it is not known what the contemporary name for those coins was. The first Dinars were issued by the Umayyad Caliphate. Under the dynasties that followed the use of the Dinar spread from Islamic Spain to Central Asia.\n\nBuy online with UK and worldwide delivery available or contact our expert team to arrange a viewing or ask any questions."
