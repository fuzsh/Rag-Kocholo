He has no partner\" in the central field, \"In the name of Allah this dirhem was struck at al-Andalus in the year seven and sixty and one hundred in the margins, all within a double border with five annulets/ \"Allah is one, Allah is eternal. He begets not neither is he begotten\" in the central field, \"Mohamed is the prophet of Allah whom he sent with guidance and the religion of truth that he may make it victorious over every other religion\", all within a border with five annulets. Issued in 167 AH = 783 AD. Mint of al-Andalus (Spain). 27mm, 2.69 grams. Monedas Andalusies #587; Vives 65. The Umayyad conquest of Hispania (711-718) began as an army of the Umayyad Caliphate consisting largely of Berbers, inhabitants of Northwest Africa recently converted to Islam, invaded the Christian Visigothic Kingdom located on the Iberian peninsula (Hispania). Under the authority of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I of Damascus, and commanded by Tariq ibn Ziyad, they disembarked at Gibraltar on April 30, 711, and campaigned their way northward. Tariq's forces were reinforced the next year by those of his superior, the Emir Musa ibn Nusair. During the eight-year campaign, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim occupation, save for small areas in the northwest (Galicia and Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. The conquered territory, under the Arabic name al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad empire. Spain remained under the direct rule of the Caliphs for only a few decades, since in 756 Abd ar-Rahman I, a survivor of the recently overthrown Umayyad Dynasty, seized power in the province, founding an independent dynasty that survived until the 11th century. Muslim domination lasted longer: until the defeat of the Almohads in the 13th century, after which the Christian Reconquista became irresistible. Abd ar-Rahman I (known as \"the Immigrant\", also the \"Falcon of Andalus\" or \"The Falcon of the Quraysh\"; 731-788 AH) was the founder of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba (755), a Muslim dynasty that ruled the greater part of Iberia for nearly three centuries (including the succeeding Caliphate of Córdoba). The Muslims called the regions of Iberia under their dominion al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman's establishment of a government in al-Andalus represented a branching from the rest of the Islamic Empire, which had been usurped by the Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyads from Damascus in 750."
