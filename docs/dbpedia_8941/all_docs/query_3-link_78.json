        "text": "Couldn't help but have my appreciation for Arab-Byzantine coins rekindled when I took these two out and put them together. It helps that they are in better condition than most. As with my Khosrau II 12 nummi coin, I find particularly interesting coinage that reflect two fundamentally different cultures, such as with the Arab-Byzantine series.\n\nI'll link to my previous threads for the history, but I will mention that (as with other instances in history), the Muslims that conquered much of the Eastern Roman Empire and the whole of the Sassanian Empire needed to keep the native populations of these areas happy to cement their control. One way they did this was the continuation of the existing coinage styles (but with slight alterations to make them more Arab- and Muslim-friendly). The Romans kept their folles and the Persians kept their drachms (refered to as fals and dirham respectively by the Arabs). This situation lasted until the coinage reform enacted by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-malik ibn Marwan in 696-697 AD completely eliminated images from the coins and replaced them entirely with Arabic words and phrases.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering about part of the thread title. The photo of the reverses might give you a clue .\n\nAnonymous, Umayyad Caliphate\n\nAE fals\n\nObv: KA/L/ON in left field, \"bi-Hims\" (in Arabic) in right field,\n\nfacing bust, beardless, wearing crown and chlamys, holding globus cruciger in right hand\n\nRev: Large m, E/M/I in left field, two birds eyes above, C/H/C in right field, \"tayyib\" (Arabic for \"good\") in ex\n\nMint: Hims (Emessa)\n\nDate: 680-690 AD\n\nRef: Album 110; SICA I, 542\n\nIf you want to read a bit about early Islamic history of the 7th-8th centuries (even if you might not be into Islamic coins you might find some of this interesting):\n\nhttps://www.cointalk.com/threads/beware-of-weaponized-grapes.279057/#post-2427832\n\nhttps://www.cointalk.com/threads/slowly-expanding-into-a-new-field.254279/#post-2006023\n\nhttps://www.cointalk.com/threads/th...quisition-and-discussion.272659/#post-2310405\n\nhttps://www.cointalk.com/threads/a-coin-of-one-of-the-great-islamic-empires.263138/#post-2141681\n\nPlease post your Arab-Byzantines and/or your multicultural coins!\n\nAnonymous, Umayyad Caliphate\n\nAE fals\n\nObv: KA/L/ON in left field, \"bi-Hims\" (in Arabic) in right field,\n\nfacing bust, beardless, wearing crown and chlamys, holding globus cruciger in right hand\n\nRev: Large m, E/M/I in left field, two birds eyes above, C/H/C in right field, \"tayyib\" (Arabic for \"good\") in ex\n\nMint: Hims (Emessa)\n\nDate: 680-690 AD\n\nIn case it is not obvious to all, the unusual part of these bilingual coins is the split of Greek and Arabic on the two sides. Kalon on the obverse and tayyib both mean good while EMICHC and Hims are the city name of the mint. When I think of a bilingual coin I would expect a Greek side and an Arabic side but here we see the elements mixed with some on each side. Interesting coins!\n\nReviving this link, to share this bilingual Arab-Byzantine coin. Between the C.Foss catalog from DOC and this CT thread (thanks @ValiantKnight and @dougsmit), I have a little better understanding of this coin and where it came from.\n\nFoss describes it as from \"the most extensive issue of the whole of Arab-Byzantine series (at least 59 obverse and 63 reverse dies); coins of Emesa are more common that those of any other mint...\". This article, referenced, from W.A. Oddy 1985 on \"The Constans II Bust type of Arab Byzantine Coins of Hims\" is available on-line.\n\n\"good\" a statement that it is \"good\" for use as currency or of good weight standard...?\n\nAnonymous, Umayyad (=Mu'Awiya?) Caliphate AD 660-680 (date listed in C. Foss)\n\nObv: KA/Λ/ON (good or passes) in left field, \"bi-Hims\" (Emesa in Arabic) in right field with star below, facing bust, beardless, wearing cuirass and paludamentum (military cape), with cross on diadem, holding globus cruciger in right hand\n\nRev: Large m, E/M/I in left field, o*o above, C/H/C in right field, \"tayyib\" (Arabic for \"good\") in exergue\n\nMint: Hims (Emesa)\n\nSize: 20.5mm, 3.90g, die axis 6 (ref: C.Foss catalog #65 which is 21mm and 3.93g)\n\n@Marsyas Mike Although I found this book (also here) to have some gaps that I wish it filled in a bit better for the casual reader - it is well worth the ~$25.\n\nFor example your last coin is easy to find on p.27 labelled as a \"Close Imitation\" from the \"Early Caliphate\" AD 647-670:\n\nObv: Standing Imperial figure of Constan II type, with cross on crown, holding long cross in r.hand, globus cruciger in l. [EN] TɣTO NIKA\n\nRev: m, star above, l. AɸA, r: ONΔ; illegible inscription in ex.\n\nRef: C.Foss #8 p.124\n\nEdit: Actually, @Marsyas Mike - not sure - your second coin has an M - maybe the real thing and not a close imitation?"
