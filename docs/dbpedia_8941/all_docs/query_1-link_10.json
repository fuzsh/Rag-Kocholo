        "text": "Islamic\n\nThe earliest Arab invaders had reached India in the 8th century and founded a dynasty in Sind, which left numerous very small silver coins of the Umayyad type. The coinage of the Ghūrid dynasty of northwest Afghanistan and its successors from the 12th century onward is varied and extensive, mainly gold and silver tangas (or rupees) of 10.76 grams. Gold was hardly issued at all in the 15th and 16th centuries, and for a time the coinage was mainly billon. Shēr Shāh of Sūr (1540–45), of northern India, issued a large silver currency of a type carrying the profession of the faith and names of the four caliphs, that was imitated by the Mughal successor of the Sūİs.\n\nThe coinages of Bābur and Humāyūn, the first two of the Mughal conquerors of India, are not extensive and are of Central Asian character. With the next two emperors, Akbar and Jahāngīr, is found a series unrivaled for variety and, within limitations, beauty—the gold coins of Jahāngir are noble examples of Muslim calligraphy. In the 16th century the type that goes back to Shēr Shāh prevailed: the profession of the faith with the names of the first four caliphs and the emperor’s titles on the other side; Aurangzeb replaced the confession of faith by the mint and date, and this remained the usual type until the end of the dynasty. The emperor’s name is usually enshrined in a Persian couplet to the effect that the metal of the coins acquires added lustre from bearing the emperor’s name. Nearly 50 such verses are found on Jahāngīr’s coins. His reign is also remarkable for the series of coins bearing signs of the zodiac and for the set of portrait mohurs, one of which represents him holding a wine cup. From the beginning of the 18th century the coins become stereotyped, and the epigraphy loses its beauty. The European East India companies copied the native types from the local coinages and did not strike on European lines until the 19th century. A uniform coinage for territories under British administration was introduced in 1835. The right of native states to mint their own coinage was gradually curtailed by the British government. Since 1948, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have had their own coinages. Bangladesh commenced independent coinage on Jan. 1, 1972.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nMention should also be made of the extensive Nepalese coinage in gold and silver with Sanskrit legends; the coinage of Tibet, related to that of Nepal; and the long series of octagonal gold and silver coins of Assam, struck until about 1821.\n\nChina\n\nBefore coins were invented, cowrie shells were used as money in China. The earliest Chinese coins are small bronze hoes and knives, copies of the tools that previously had been used for barter. The knife coins (tao) were about six inches (15 centimetres) long and some bore inscriptions naming the issuer and giving the value. Hoe coins bore similar inscriptions. Both types circulated during the 4th and 3rd centuries bc. Round money with a hole in the centre was issued about the mid-3rd century, but it was not until 221 bc that the reforming emperor Shih huang-ti (221–210/209 bc) superseded all other currencies by the issue of round coins (pan-liang) of half an ounce. (There were 24 grains in the Chinese ounce, and in the Han period the ounce weighed 16 grams.) These pan-liang coins were continued by the Han dynasty. The official weight of this coin was gradually reduced until it was replaced in 118 bc by the emperor Wu-ti’s five-grain (chu) piece, which remained the standard coin of China for the next three centuries; a break in the monotony of the regular coinage occurred in the archaistic innovations of the usurper Wang Mang (ad 9–23), who issued a series of token coins based on the tao and on square Japanese pu coins and various new round coins."
