        "text": "Dirham (Umayyad silver coin). 711-712 CE. Place of Origin: Iraq, Wasit. Material: Silver. Dimensions: 2.7 cm diameter. 04.35.3343 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gift of Darius Ogden Mills, 1904. https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/444958?&searchField=All&sortBy=Relevance&when=A.D.+500-1000&ft=Coin%2c+Islam&offset=20&rpp=20&pos=24\n\nBy: Sean Downey\n\nThe monetization of the economy was a common feature of economies throughout Late Antiquity, so examining the varying designs on these coins can provide insight into different aspects of society. The designs inscribed on coins throughout history generally represent something of common importance to a majority of members of society. In the modern day, these designs often consist of famous leaders or prominent figures of other varieties, as well as other symbolism representing national identities or shared values. However, in the world of Late Antiquity, these symbols were often related not only to the social identity of their society but to the major religion of their society as well. From depictions of Sol Invictus to depictions of Christian crosses, coin designs often offer insight into the religious contexts of Late Antique society. However, one of the most interesting coin designs of Late Antiquity is that of the Islamic dirham of the early Umayyad caliphate. While coins are often considered to be relatively commonplace objects in most societies, this dirham and others like it represent a great deal about the time in which they were made.\n\nThe dirham was a type of silver coin used throughout the different Caliphates of early Islam. This particular dirham was manufactured in Iraq in A.H. 93/A.D. 711-712 during the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate. This dirham is 2.7cm in diameter and is made of silver.[i][D2] While no specific material analysis of this dirham has been performed, studies of other dirhams from the time period can provide some insight into the composition of this coin. Ben Abdelouahed et. al’s proton-induced X-Ray emission (PIXE) analysis of silver coins from Late Antique Islamic societies and other medieval societies shows that Umayyad dirhams consisted mainly of silver (~96.1%-98.7%) with varying amounts of secondary components such as copper (~0.45%-2.49%), lead (~0.12%-0.97%), and gold (~0.41%-0.67%).[ii]\n\nThe dirham is decorated with Arabic writing which is translated as follows:\n\nObverse:\n\nInscription in Arabic in field:\n\n“There is no god but God alone. He has no associate.\n\nInscription in Arabic in margin:\n\nIn the name of God, this dirham was struck in Wasit in the year A.H. 93.”\n\nReverse:\n\nInscription in Arabic in field:\n\n“God is one. ‘God, the Everlasting Refuge, who has not begotten, and has not been begotten, and equal to Him is not any one.’” (Qur’an 112)\n\nInscription in Arabic in margin:\n\n“Muhammad is the Messenger of God, who sent him ‘with the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may uplift it [Islam] above every religion, though the unbelievers be averse.”’ (variation of Qur’an 9:33)[iii]\n\nWhile most early Islamic coinage was very similar in design to coinage used in other nearby areas, this dirham and others like it from the time period represent a revolutionary design that influenced the design of Islamic coinage for centuries. Before coins like this dirham, Islamic coins were often made to mimic coins from other prevailing civilizations. For example, a symbol of a set of steps topped with a stand topped with a sphere was often used on coins. This symbol was reminiscent of the Christian cross used on Byzantine coins of the time period, but also served to reject the Christian values of the society through its replacement. Starting in 78 AH/697 CE monetary norms of pictures of rulers and other designs common in Late Antique coinage were replaced on Islamic coinage with Arabic calligraphy with very specific religious messages. In the case of this dirham and others like it, the obverse contains a shortened version of the shahāda, which affirms the oneness of God and is one of the five pillars of Islam. The reverse side of the coin contains a condensed version of the Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ (Qur’an 112) and the risāla, a shortened version of Qur’an 9:33 which proclaims Muhammad’s prophetic mission[iv]. The iconography on these new coin designs was significant in expressing the centrality of the Islamic faith to this newly developing society. The verse following the risāla specifically condemns the use of money by rabbis and monks, and extols the user of the money to use it in moral ways[v]. Additionally, the inclusion of the shahāda can be seen as a direct rebuke of the Christian concept of the Trinity[vi]. Overall, the new design of Islamic money boldly showed the power of Islam as the center of this new and powerful society. The inclusion of these specific inscriptions on the coins not only the affirmed centrality of Islam in society, but also specifically affirmed the central authority of the Qur’an in society as well. Through the design of the money that was central to the function of the economy of the Caliphate, the Umayyads introduced an encompassing symbol of Islam into the daily lives of their people. In this way, this dirham and its iconography are illustrative of the power of Islam as a Late Antique Religion.\n\nExamining Islam within the context of Late Antiquity can be challenging due to its rise very late in the period. However, many scholars argue that many aspects of Early Islam, including monetary trends, were very similar to aspects of other Late Antique societies. For example, a large part of the early Islamic Caliphates consisted of the former Sassanian Empire that was absorbed by the Caliphate. In many parts of the former Sassanian Empire, administrative structures were left intact, simply being placed under the control of Arab governors. As such, many of the influences the Sassanian Empire had from its Late Antique neighbors were in some capacity also absorbed into the new Islamic Caliphate. In fact, Morony says, “Thus, in terms of the monetization of the economy and the commercialization of agriculture, there is no boundary at all between Late Antiquity and the early Islamic world but a trend that begins in one and continues into the other”.[vii] These similarities between the new Islamic Caliphate and the rest of Late Antique society suggest that it may not be so difficult to compare Early Islam and other Late Antique religions. This coin represents the centrality of Islam to the governmental structures of this new society, and this can be compared and contrasted with the levels of influence between major religions and governmental structures in other Late Antique societies.\n\n[i]Marika Sardar, Dirham, (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2010).\n\n[ii] Ben Abdelouahed et. al., PIXE analysis of medieval silver coins, (Materials Characterization, 2009), 62.\n\n[iii] Sardar, Dirham.\n\n[iv] Stefan Heidemann, The Evolving Representation Of The Early Islamic Empire And Its Religion On Coin Imagery, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV, 2010), 186.\n\n[v] Luke Treadwell and ليوديرت كول, Qur’anic Inscriptions on the Coins of the ahl al-bayt from the Second to Fourth Century, (Journal of Qur'anic Studies 14, 2012), 51.\n\n[vi] Jere L.
