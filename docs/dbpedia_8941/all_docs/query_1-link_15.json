        "text": "Arab-Sassanian Coins From Year 20 (Assume Yazdgird Era, So 31 AH / 652 CE) Onwards.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: jayyid (\"Valid\" or \"Good\"). These are some of the earliest dated Islamic coins and believed to have been struck for about 15 years.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coins, Various Mints In Iran, From Year 20 (Assume Yazdgird Era, So 31 AH / 652 CE) Onwards.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh (\"In the name of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coins, Various Mints In Iran, Known With Years 23-39 (Assume Yazdgird Era, So 34-50 AH / 654-70 CE).\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: lillāh (\"Unto God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Muʿāwiya, Darabgird, Frozen In Year 43 AH / 663-664 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse field has Maawia amir i-wruishnikan (\"Muʿāwiya, commander of the faithful\") written in the Middle Persian. Obverse margin: bism Allāh (\"In the name of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin, Bīshāpūr, Minted In 47 AH / 667 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh al-malik (\"In the name of God, the King\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coins, Various Mints In Iran, From Year 35 (Assume Yazdgird Era, So 46 AH / 666 CE) Onwards.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh rabbī (\"In the name of God, my Lord\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of The Governor Ḥakam Ibn Abī l-ʿĀs, Fars and Khuzistan, 57 AH / 676-677 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. It comes with a hephtalite countermark and testmark. Obverse margin: bism Allāh rabb al-ḥukm (\"In the name of God, the Lord of judgement\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Yazīd Bin Muʿāwiya, 61 AH / 681 CE.\n\nTypical Arab-Sassanian bust, i.e., standing profile potrait of Khusraw II. The reverse field has a unique Middle Persian legend that says: ŠNT ’YWK Y YZYT (\"Year one of Yazīd\"). The dating \"Year one of Yazīd\" belongs to Sassanian system; the \"Year one\" being the first year of the current reign. There is no indication of the \"Islamic\" character of this coin.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coinage Of Ṭalha Ibn ʿAbd Allāh, 64 AH / 683 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: Ṭalha lillāh (\"Ṭalha, unto God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Salm Bin Ziyād, 65 AH / 684-685 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust. Obverse margin: In an unpointed Arabic script Bism Allāh, Allāhu / Akbar (\"In the name of God, God is / Great\"). This appears to be the earliest known Islamic coin to bear the famous slogan Allāhu Akbar.\n\nDrachm Of ʿAbd al-Malik Ibn ʿAbd Allāh, Zubayrid Governor Of Bīshāpūr, 66 AH / 685-686 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / Muḥammad rasūl / Allāh (\"In the name of God, Muḥammad is the messenger of God\"). This is the earliest occurance of the name \"Muḥammad\" in a dated Muslim text.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of The Governor, ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Ibn ʿAbd Allāh Ibn Āmir, Sistan, 66 AH / 685-86 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. It comes with a hephtalite countermark and testmark. Obverse margin: bism Allāh al-ʿazīz (\"In the name of God, the Great\").\n\nTransitional Fals Issue From The Time Of Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, 66 AH / 685 CE.\n\nTwo standing figures, facing, wearing long robes and Arab head-dress adorned with six-pointed stars. Their right hand is on their swords. Between them, on three steps, a pointed staff with globe. Obverse margin: bism Allāh ʿAbd Allāh ʿAbd al-Malik Amīr al-Muʾminīn (\"In the name of God. The slave of God ʿAbd al-Malik, Commander of the Faithful\"). Although the coins bears no mintmark, the kufic inscription leaves no doubt that it was an official issue of the Umayyad caliph. Clive Floss is of the opinion that this type apparently represents the caliph ʿAbd al-Malik and his brother ʿAbd al-Azīz, who were jointly proclaimed as successors to their father Marwan in 684/85 CE.\n\nAnonymous Arab-Sassanian Fals From Dārābjird, 67 AH / 686-87 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust with Pahlavi afzut before bust. Obverse margin: bism Allāh (\"In the name of God\") in the second quadrant of obverse margin. Reverse field: Fire altar between mint (Dārābjird) and date, in margin afzut (Pahlavi) and baraka (\"blessing\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of ʿUmar Ibn ʿUbayd Allāh Ibn Maʿmar, Fars, 68 AH / 687-688 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: lillāh al-ḥamd (\"Unto God be praise\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coins Of Muṣʿab Ibn Al-Zubayr, 69 AH / 688 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh (\"In the name of God\") BPRWY (in Middle Persian) with a countermark lillāh (\"Unto God\") in the fourth quadrant.\n\nAnonymous Arab-Sassanian Coin From Kirmān, 70 AH / 689 CE.\n\nObverse field: Typical late Arab-Sassanian bust without the name of governor. Instead it is occupied by Middle Persian legend MHMT PGTAMI Y DAT (\"Muhammad is the messenger of God\"). Obverse margin: bism Allāh walī / al-Amr (\"In the name of God, the Master / of affairs\"). The reverse field has typical Arab-Sassanian fire-altar with attendants with unidentified mint (GRM-KRMAN) in the Kirman province and the date. This is the second earliest known record where the name \"Muḥammad\" is mentioned in a dated Muslim text. Furthermore, this is the earliest mention of the name \"Muḥammad\" in Middle Persian (Pahlavi).\n\nTransitional Arab-Sassanian Coin Of Governor ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Ibn ʿAbd Allāh Ibn Āmir, 72 AH / 691-92 CE.\n\nObverse field: Typical late Arab-Sassanian bust. Middle Persian legend on the left of the bust: GDH ’pzwt' xwarrah abzūd (\"Increase in glory\") and on the right: ’pdwl ’cyc Y ’pdwl’ Y ’myl’n (\"ʿAbdul ʿAzīz ī ʿAbdullāh ī Āmirān\"), i.e., the name of the governor. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / al-ʿazīz (\"In the name of God / the Great\"). Reverse field: Absence of typical Arab-Sassanian fire-altar with attendants. Instead it contains the legend in Middle Persian in five line, three of which state full shahada in Middle Persian. This full shahada is perhaps the earliest surviving physical record of it in Pahlavi.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Maqātil Ibn Misma, 72 AH / 691 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / bakriyya (\"In the name of God. Bakriyya\"). This is the only known instance of appearance of the word bakriyya on any of the Arab-Sassanian coins. Bakriyya is a reference to the Bakr bin Wā’il tribe.\n\nAnonymous Arab-Sassanian Coinage Of Syrian Origin Under ʿAbd al-Malik, 72 AH / 691 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Written in Arabic to downwards to the right of the bust: Muḥammad rasūl Allāh (\"Muḥammad is the messenger of God\"). The conventional Pahlavi benediction formula khurra afzut is behind the bust. Obverse margin: bism Allāh (\"In the name of God\"). This is an extremely rare coin and marks the initial steps of ʿAbd al-Malik's monetary reforms in Damascus.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coinage Of The Kharijite ʿAtiya Ibn Al-Aswad, 72 AH / 691 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh walī al-Amr (\"In the name of God, the Master of affairs\"). This is a lesser known slogan of the Kharijites.\n\nThe Arab-Byzantine One And Two “Standing Imperial Figures” Dīnārs From The Time Of Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, 72-74 AH / 692-694 CE .\n\nThese Arab-Byzantine gold solidi imitations including the one which has \"three standing imperial figures\" bear no Kufic legends to identify themselves as Arab issues. They are recognized as such only by the defacement or elimination of the crosses. Another noticeable feature of these imitation coins is the clumsy arrangement of the legend on the margins of both obverse and reverse sides, with little attention paid to positioning of the letters. G. C. Miles is of the opinion that these coins are roughly contemporary to each other.\n\nThe Arab-Byzantine “Three Standing Imperial Figures” Dīnār From The Time Of Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, 72-74 AH / 692-694 CE.\n\nThis is the Umayyad imitation of the Byzantine prototype - both of them consist of three standing imperial figures on the obverse side. Reverse field: Staff ending in globe in steps. Reverse margin: bism Allāh lā-ilaha il-Allāh waḥdahu Muḥammad rasūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\"). This full shahada is perhaps the earliest surviving physical record of it in Arabic.\n\nAnonymous Arab-Sassanian Coinage Of Syrian Origin From The Time Of ʿAbd al-Malik, 73 AH / 692 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / lā-ilaha il-Allāh wa / ḥdahu Muḥammad ra / sūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Bishr Ibn Marwān - I, 73 AH / 692 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust. In the place of the usual Sassanian fire-altar and two attendants, three bearded figures standing, the central one facing with hands raised on either side of his head, in an attitude of prayer, with smaller figures left and right, respectively, having their heads turned toward him. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / lā-ilaha il-Allāh / waḥdahu Muḥammad / rasūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Bishr Ibn Marwān - II, 75 AH / 694-695 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust. In the place of the usual Sassanian fire-altar and two attendants, three bearded figures standing, the central one facing with hands raised on either side of his head, in an attitude of prayer, with smaller figures left and right, respectively, having their heads turned toward him. Obverse margin: bism Allāh Muḥammad / rasūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of The Kharijite Rebel Qatarī Ibn al-Fujā'a, Bīshāpūr, 75 AH / 694-695 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: lā ḥukm illā lillāh (\"Judgement belongs to God alone\"), the typical Kharijite slogan.\n\nA Mixed Arab-Sassanian And Arab-Byzantine Coin From The Time Of Caliph ʿAbd Al-Malik, 75 AH / 694-695 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust. In the place of the usual fire-altar and the two attendants, a standing figure of the caliph, bearded and with his right hand resting on his sword-hilt in the attitude of the imām delivering a khutba. Kufic legends on sides running downwards khalfat (sic) Allāh / amīr al-mu'minīn (\"khalifa of God, Commander of the Faithful\"). Obverse margin: bism Allāh / lā-ilaha il-Allāh / waḥdahu Muḥammad ra / sūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\").\n\nThe Arab-Byzantine “Standing Caliph” Dīnār From The Time Of Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, 76 AH / 695-696 CE.\n\nObverse field has an image of the caliph standing in the centre, bearing a sword in a scabbard. Obverse margin: bism Allāh lā-ilaha il-Allāh wa / ḥdahu Muḥammad rasūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the messenger of God\"). Reverse field shows a mutiliated cross on steps along with the date. The \"standing-caliph\" coin was only minted for three years (74-77 AH / 693-697 CE) before giving way to a wholly aniconic form, that is, engraved only with words and no images at all.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Al-Ḥajjāj Bin Yūsuf, 77 AH / 696-697 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust with the name \"al-Ḥajjāj bin Yūsuf\" written in Arabic on the right hand side of the bust. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / lā-ilaha il- / Allāh waḥdahu Muḥammad / rasūl Allāh (\"In the name of God. There is no god but God alone. Muḥammad is the Messenger of God\"). This is a very unique coin. The shahadah is arranged in striking fashion radially in the obverse margin. As far as we are aware, no other coin from 1st century of hijra which shows this feature. The Arab-Sassanian and Arab-Byzantine coins which show either full or partial shahadah, show its arrangement running along the obverse margin.\n\nAniconic Silver Coins (“Reformed Coinage”), Minted By The Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, From 77 AH / 696 CE.\n\nThe aniconic reformed silver coinage of ʿAbd al-Malik was different from its earlier predecessors in epigraphy as well as religious content.\n\nAniconic Gold Coins (“Reformed Coinage”), Minted By The Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, From 77 AH / 696 CE.\n\nThe differences between the reformed Umayyad gold and silver coins are quite subtle. The obverse margin in gold became the reverse margin in silver. The reverse margin in gold became obverse margin in silver. The silver also adds wa-lam yakun lahu kufūwan aḥad (\"And there is none like unto Him\") which is absent in the gold.\n\nExperimental Aniconic Silver Coins Minted By The Umayyad Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik, 78 AH / 697-698 CE.\n\nSince this was an exceptionally early issue it was struck before the precise format of the design had evolved. This might also explain why the legends are placed differently on this specimen. What was obverse margin in the experimental Umayyad dirham became reverse margin in the \"reformed\" dirham.\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Yazīd Ibn Al-Muhallab - I, 78 AH / 697 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: quwwat Yazīd billāh (\"Strength of Yazīd is from God\").\n\nArab-Armenian Coin Of Muḥammad Bin Marwān, c. 75-78 AH / 694-697 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: In an unpointed Arabic script Muḥammad (\"Muḥammad\"). Roman letter ‘T’ replaces star in crescent at 6 o'clock.\n\nArab-Sassanian Style Coins In The Era Of Reformed Coinage - From The Time Of Al-Ḥajjāj Bin Yūsuf, 79 AH / 698-699 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: lā-ilaha il-Allāh wahdahu Muḥammad rasūl Allāh (\"There is no god but God alone, Muḥammad is the messenger of God\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of ʿAbd Al-Raḥmān Ibn Muḥammad, 81 AH / 700 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / rabb ḥarasahu (\"In the name of God. May God protect him\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of ʿAbd Allāh Ibn Bastām, 82 AH / 701 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / baraka (\"In the name of God. Blessing\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of Yazīd Ibn Al-Muhallab - II, 82 AH / 701 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust, but with a new type of head-dress with a top like weather-vane. On the reverse side, in place of the usual Sassanian fire-altar and two attendents, a standing figure, facing, in armour, wearing helmet with \"weather-vane\" like that on the obverse side and holding in his left hand a spear, while grasping with his right hand a sword in its scabbard. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / al-ʿAẓīm (\"In the name of God, the Mighty\"). Reverse margin: Contains both Hephthalite (Greek) and kufic scripts. The kufic script says duriba jizya bi-al-Jūzjān (\"struck for tribute in al-Juzjan\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Fals From Veh-az-Āmid-Kavād (Arrajān), 82 AH / 701-702 CE.\n\nTypical Arab-Sassanian fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: Naṣr Allāh al-ḥaqq (\"May God give victory to the truth\").\n\nArab-Sassanian Coin Of The Governor ʿAmr Ibn Laqīt, Kirmān, 83 AH / 702 CE.\n\nTypical late Arab-Sassanian bust and fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: bism Allāh / ʿAmr lillāh (\"In the name of God. ʿAmr, unto God\").\n\nA Unique Arab-Sassanian Fals From Veh-az-Āmid-Kavād (Arrajān), 83 AH / 702-703 CE.\n\nTypical Arab-Sassanian fire-altar with attendants. Obverse margin: Muḥammadun rasūlu’llāhi wa’lladhīna yatlūna maʿahu ashiddāʾu ʿalā’l-kuffāri ruḥamāʾu baynahum (\"Muḥammad is the Messenger of God, those who recite with him are severe [in their dealings] with the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves\").\n\nArab-Latin Coinage - Half Solidus With Two Imperial Busts, c. 80-85 AH / 700-704 CE.\n\nObverse field: Bust of Emperor Heraclius on left and smaller bust of his son Heraclius Constantine on right, each wearing a crown.
