We are proud to present a varied selection of the most beautiful and historically interesting Islamic coins, in gold and silver, Dinars and Dirhams. Our earliest coins date from the Umayyad Caliphate, which was the second of four great Caliphates established after the death of prophet Muhammad. It was succeded by the Abbasid Caliphate, established by the dynasty that descends from the uncle of the prophet. They ruled as Caliphs from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 AD (AH 132).

We also feature the later Caliphates and rulers. We stock coins from the Fatimid Caliphate, coins of Durrani, coins of Seljuqks, Mamluks and later Qajar, all the way up to the Ottoman Empire and the 20th century.
