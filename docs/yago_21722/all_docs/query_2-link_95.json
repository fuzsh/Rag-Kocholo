        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2016\n\nVittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia, King of Italy\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy reigned from 1861 until 1878. He was born Prince Vittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso of Savoy on March 14, 1820, in Turin, the eldest son of Carlo Alberto, 7th Prince of Carignano, the future King of Sardinia, and Maria Theresa of Austria, Archduchess of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. He had two younger siblings:\n\nPrince Ferdinando of Savoy, Duke of Genoa (1822 – 1855) – married Princess Elisabeth of Saxony, had issue, including the future Queen Margherita of Italy\n\nPrincess Maria Cristina of Savoy (1826 – 1827) – died in childhood\n\nIn 1831, his father succeeded a distant cousin, becoming King of Sardinia. Vittorio Emanuele accompanied his father to Turin, where he underwent a very strict regimen of education and physical activities. Soon, he began his military career, attaining the rank of Colonel and commanding his own regiment. He later was elevated to the rank of General.\n\nOn April 12, 1842, at the Palazzina de caccia di Stupinigi, Vittorio was married to Archduchess Adelheid of Austria. She was the daughter of Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria and Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Vittorio and Adelheid were first cousins, as his father and her mother were siblings. They were also first cousins once removed through their mutual descent from Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. Adelheid died on January 20, 1855, just twelve days after giving birth to their youngest child.\n\nThe couple had eight children:\n\nMarie Clotilde (1843 – 1911) – married Prince Napoléon Joseph Bonaparte, had issue\n\nKing Umberto I of Italy (1844 – 1900) – married Princess Margherita of Savoy, had issue\n\nPrince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (1845 – 1890) – later King Amadeo I of Spain – married (1) Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo, had issue; (2) Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, had issue\n\nPrince Oddone, Duke of Montferrat (1846 – 1866) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Pia (1847 – 1911) – married King Luís I of Portugal, had issue\n\nPrince Carlo Alberto, Duke of Chablais (1851 – 1854) – died as a child\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (born and died 1852) – died at birth\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Geneva (born and died 1855) – died as an infant\n\nIn 1847, 27-year-old Vittorio Emanuele met 14-year-old Rose Vercellana when her father became the commander of the royal garrison at the Royal Castle of Racconigi, the hunting estate of the royal family of Sardinia. She soon became his mistress. At that time, Vittorio Emanuele had been married to his wife Adelheid of Austria for seven years and five of their eight children had been born.\n\nVittorio Emanuele’s many other relationships were brief but his relationship with Rosa lasted the rest of his life. Their early meetings were very secret because Vittorio Emanuele’s father Carlo Alberto, King of Sardinia was against the affair and because it was illegal to have sex with minors. Eventually, Rosa was given a home on the grounds of the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi (the hunting residence of Stupinigi), closer to Turin, the seat of government.\n\nRosa and Vittorio Emanuele had a daughter and a son, born when Rosa was fifteen and eighteen:\n\nVittoria Guerrieri (1848 – 1905), married (1) Giacomo Filippo Spinola, had three children (2) Luigi Domenico Spinola, brother of her first husband, had one daughter (3) Paolo de Simone, no children\n\nEmanuele Alberto Guerrieri, Count of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda (1851 – 1894), married Bianca Enrichetta de Lardere, had two sons\n\nFollowing a massive defeat by the Austrian forces, Vittorio Emanuele’s father abdicated on March 23, 1849, and he became King of Sardinia as Vittorio Emanuele II. He became a driving force behind the “Risorgimento”, the Italian unification movement.\n\nOver the next twelve years, Vittorio Emanuele led the drive toward a unified kingdom. Under the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a noted general and politician, the Sardinian forces soon gained Sicily and Naples. He then led his forces against the Papal army, driving the Pope into Vatican City. This resulted in the Pope excommunicating Vittorio Emanuele from the Roman Catholic church. Garibaldi soon conquered the Kingdom of Two Sicilies but was stopped from attacking Rome as it was under protection from the French. With all the newly acquired lands, on March 17, 1861, Vittorio Emanuele was proclaimed the first King of the new, united Kingdom of Italy.\n\nAfter the death of Vittorio Emanuele’s wife Adelheid in 1855, his relationship with Rosa Vercellana continued, despite his numerous other lovers, and became more public. Although the relationship caused much scandal and hostility at court, Vittorio Emanuele did not yield to any pressure. In 1858, Vittorio created Rosa Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, recognized their two children, and gave them the surname Guerrieri. A year later, Vittorio Emanuele purchased the Castle of Sommariva Perno (link in Italian) for Rosa. Although Rosa was despised by the nobles, she was loved by the common people for her peasant origins.\n\nWhen Vittorio Emanuele fell seriously ill in 1869 and feared he was dying, he married Rosa in a religious ceremony on October 18, 1869. However, Vittorio Emanuele did not die. The marriage was morganatic, a marriage between people of unequal social rank in which the position or privileges of the higher-ranked spouse are not passed on to the other spouse or any children. Rosa’s children had no succession rights and she did not become Queen of Italy, instead, she retained her titles Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, which the Vittorio Emanuele had given her in 1858. So that Rosa would have marriage civil rights, a civil marriage was held on October 7, 1877, just three months before Vittorio Emanuele’s death.\n\nIn 1870, allied with Prussia, the King capitalized on Prussia’s victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and captured Rome after the French forces withdrew. On September 20, 1870, Vittorio Emanuele entered Rome, established the city as the new capital of Italy, and took up residence at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy.\n\nThe remainder of his reign was more peaceful. The King focused on building up the new Kingdom, both financially and culturally, further cementing his legacy as ‘Father of the Fatherland’ (Padre Della Patria), a title given to him by the Italian people. King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy died at the Quirinal Palace on January 8, 1878. He is buried in the Pantheon in Rome.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
